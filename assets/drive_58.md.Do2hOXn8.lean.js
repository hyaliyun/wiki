Within most of the timeline of the series and movie, the existence of Reavers is officially denied by the Alliance, the ruling government of humanity in the Firefly franchise, but they are a harsh reality around the outer planets. The Reavers are mentioned several times during the course of the television show. A Reaver ship is seen in the pilot episode, and the episode \\"Bushwacked\\" shows someone becoming a Reaver. The movie Serenity featured Reavers and reveals their origin. ==Concept== Joss Whedon, creator of the Firefly series and director of Serenity, has said of Reavers, \\"Every story needs a monster. In the stories of the old west it was the Apaches\\". He explained how he removed the racial aspect of the Apache metaphor by using the Reavers. \\"I used that example by saying that anyone who goes out into space and goes mad can become a monster.\\" The purpose Reavers serve in the show has been compared to the Hollywood \\"Injuns\\" of the 1950s in western movies by outside sources. Comic book artist Bernie Wrightson, co- creator of Swamp Thing, contributed Reaver concept designs for the film Serenity. The \\"mythology\\" of the Reavers in Firefly and Serenity has been said to be different. ==Behavior== In Firefly, Reavers are readily recognized in any situation by both appearance and behavior. Whether ritually or in fits of rage, they are portrayed as self-mutilating creatures, peeling off parts of their own skins and shoving pieces of metal into the flesh. Reavers are savage, brutal, and primal, though they engage in some form of social behavior and cooperation within their own group. In the franchise, their contact with normal humans appears to be limited to combat, rape to death, torture, and cannibalism. These contacts are brief and survivors few. As a result, little is known of Reavers' social structure. Reavers growl and snarl like beasts; even radio transmissions within their flotilla seem to be little more than shrieks and moans. However, they presumably communicate on some level as they are still able to cooperate and act purposefully enough to use spaceships and set sophisticated technological traps. In Serenity, the Reavers only begin to closely inspect the disguised Serenity after it fails to respond to a red light pulse1:23:52 in the film Serenity from a Reaver ship. This suggests that Reavers have retained some level of higher intelligence and social structure, though they are guided solely by their impulse to capture and consume any humans they come in contact with. The Reavers live on the edge of the human- controlled binary solar systems, rarely venturing deep into occupied space. As a result, most of the inner worlds and many Alliance officials believe them to be myths made to cover for violent criminals. Reavers are known to capture ships and raid colonies on the edge of populated space – as Zoe puts it: > \\"If they take the ship, they'll rape us to death, eat our flesh, and sew our > skins into their clothing – and if we're very, very lucky, they'll do it in > that order.\\" They occasionally leave intentional survivors of their raids, apparently subjecting them to a form of brainwashing – forcing them to witness the torture of other Reaver victims – that may drive them into the same state of cannibalistic depravity. They travel in macabre ships stained with blood and decorated with corpses chained to the hulls. They appear to live their whole lives in space, only touching down on a planet or moon to carry out a raid. ==Technology and battle tactics== Reaver ships, captured from their victims, are instantly recognizable by the haphazard red stripes and bodies of victims adorning their hulls. They are also known for flying without proper safety measures such as nuclear engine radiation containment, a practice tantamount to suicide. This makes Reaver ships faster than their normal counterparts, but also makes it easier for their prey to detect their approach and to hide by powering down their ships rather than fleeing. Reavers' habit of ramming their victims with indifference to damaging their own hulls tends to leave their ships appearing battered or torn. Their craft possess a wide variety of exotic weaponry, many of which are designed to snare and capture other ships including EMP cannons, grappling lines, and energy nets. They use weapons that fire giant sharpened disks similar to buzzsaws or shuriken, in addition to more traditional anti-ship ordinance. They also fire long, lance-like metal rods. Rather than firearms, Reavers will use any sharp object as a weapon in personal combat. They also fire toxic darts to cripple their opponents but not kill them. The goal of their weaponry is most likely to increase the number of survivors on victim ships (since Reavers have no interest in victims who are already deadSerenity (2005); Captain Mal mercy-kills a man being dragged away by Reavers, who then abandon their victim). To cripple rescue ships, they have been known to leave a bait ship intact with a bomb planted on board, set to detonate when another ship docks to help, destroying the already-derelict ship and crippling the ship that tried to provide aid. The Reavers operate a variety of vessels, from Firefly-sized vessels to captured Alliance warships. In the movie Serenity, the most notable of the Reaver ships was a huge colony vessel orbiting Miranda, which is several times larger than any of the Alliance vessels it subsequently attacked. Even with its greater size, the Reavers used the same tactics as with smaller ships, ramming an Alliance flagship and splitting it in half due to the vast difference in mass. ==Human response== Reavers terrify most non-Reaver humans. Even the most battle- hardened will opt to leave any space where Reavers are present rather than risk capture. For instance, in the show, when Reavers are coming, Mal becomes very serious and escapes quickly. Reavers are also possibly the only thing that even Jayne fears, as the mere suggestion of traveling where there is a risk of encountering Reavers makes him extremely agitated; although he claims to fear no man, Jayne declares that \\"Reavers ain't men!\\". In the movie Serenity, the normally calm and collected Operative is visibly terrified as Reaver ships appear through an ion cloud. Reaver methods are so horrifying that, when faced with capture, victims have been known to attempt suicide. Survivors have been known to cut their own faces, act and think like Reavers, and eventually become Reavers themselves.Serenity (2005); playback of Dr. Caron's audiovisual log Mercy killings of people who are captured or who fall into the hands of Reavers are considered humane, as evidenced in one scene in the movie Serenity when Mal shoots and kills a man who is grabbed by a few Reavers, who respond by dropping the dead man to the ground. Because of their part in the unethical, if accidental, creation of the Reavers, the Alliance government denies their existence, even withholding information on them from Alliance commanders of patrol ships in or near Reaver-space. ==Origin== The original theory within the series is that Reavers are men who traveled to the edge of the star system and were driven mad by the open vastness of space. This theory is discussed among most of the crew members of Serenity. In \\"Bushwhacked\\", Shepherd Book states that he believes that they are \\"just men\\" who have been removed from civilization far too long—men who could be helped. Both Jayne and Mal strongly disagree with the Shepherd's opinion. The Reavers' true origin is revealed later in the movie Serenity. The crew of Serenity find evidence, in the form of an Alliance scientist's holographic message, that Reavers were originally humans from the planet Miranda. The Alliance government used Miranda as a testing ground for the chemical agent G-23 Paxilon Hydrochlorate, or simply \\"Pax\\" (Latin for \\"peace\\"). It was added to the planet's air processors in order to calm the population and weed out aggression. The agent worked, but too well: 99.9% of the population became so lethargic that they stopped working, talking and, eventually, eating and moving. They simply lay down where they were and allowed themselves to die. The remaining 0.1% of the planet's 30 million people (approximately 30,000 total) had the opposite reaction to the Pax, becoming mindlessly violent and extremely aggressive. In fact, the scientist is violently killed by one of these survivors, the original Reavers, while recording the message.Serenity (2005); playback of Dr. Caron's audiovisual log. (Relevant dialog excerpt transcribed on Wikiquote.) Following the events of Miranda, the Alliance sealed all records regarding the event and deemed the world unsuitable for colonization. When Reavers began attacking outer colonies, only a few officials within the Alliance knew the real cause. This changes, however, when the crew of Serenity arrange for what they have uncovered to be broadcast throughout the colonized system, what they refer to as \\"the 'verse\\". ==References== Category:Fictional cannibals Category:Fictional rapists Category:Fictional mass murderers Category:Science fiction film characters Category:Firefly (TV series) terminology Category:Firefly (TV series) characters Category:Human-derived fictional species Category:Television characters introduced in 2002 ","title":"Reaver (Firefly)"},{"id":"2543904","text":"A mixed threat attack is an attack that uses different tactics to infiltrate a computer user's environment. A mixed threat attack might include an infected file that comes in by way of spam or can be received by way of Internet download. The mixed threat attacks generally try to exploit multiple vulnerabilities to get into a system. By launching multiple diverse attacks in parallel, the attacker can exploit more entry points than with just a single attack. Because these threats are based on multiple single-attacks, they are much harder to detect. Because firewalls can help with these types of attacks, if configured correctly, they are somewhat effective against this type of attack. However, if the attack is embedded inside an application, it is no longer able to prevent the attack. Typical techniques employed are to define the multiple access threat with a signature that can represents identification for the virus removal software. These types of techniques need to be employed on the host machine, because sometimes the firewall or Intrusion Detection System is not able to detect the attack.

It was made in Los Angeles at the Majestic Studio and released in 1915. ==Plot== A well-to-do family of three is asleep on a park bench. The father (Charles Insley) is awakened when a pretty girl (Margie Reiger) trips over his outstretched feet. The father is an incorrigible womanizer and immediately follows the girl to another park bench while his wife (Marta Golden) and adult daughter (Edna Purviance) remain asleep. He briefly departs to buy himself and the girl drinks from a refreshment stand. As soon as he leaves, Charlie arrives at the park bench where the pretty girl is seated. Charlie attempts to flirt with her—and the girl seems to enjoy his company. The father returns with two bottled drinks and jealously smashes one over Charlie's head, knocking him senseless. The father escorts the girl away. The girl tells the father she wants to play hide-and-seek. He agrees. She blindfolds him and walks away. Charlie regains his senses and comes across the blindfolded father. He leads him to the edge of a pond with his cane. The father removes his blindfold moments before Charlie kicks him into the water. (A passing park policeman who tries to intervene gets kicked into the pond too.) Charlie comes across the father's wife and daughter and makes a favorable impression. They invite him to their house for refreshments. Meanwhile, the father befriends another man in the park whom Charlie has earlier annoyed (Billy Armstrong). Together they go to the father's home. When snacks are put on the table, Charlie demonstrates a unique way of serving doughnuts and is having a merry time when the father sees him. The other man, who is flirting with the father's wife in the kitchen, sees Charlie too. Both men try to corral Charlie, but he knocks them cold—but not before his trousers are ripped off his body. Charlie initially runs into the street without any pants, but the commotion he creates outside causes him to retreat back into the house. Charlie goes to an upstairs room where he conveniently sees a woman's dress suit on a mannequin. He changes into it and is seen in a hallway by the daughter. Instead of being angry, the daughter laughs at the spectacle and suggests Charlie continue with the charade of dressing as a female to fool her flirtatious father. She even offers him a pair of female shoes and a place to shave his mustache. The female Charlie is introduced as a college chum of the daughter, and succeeds in attracting the attention of both the father and his friend. The father resents the competition and angrily knocks his friend out of the house. Charlie's true gender is eventually revealed, however, when his skirt falls off. Another fight ensues. Charlie and the father seem to have made peace, but the father reacts angrily when Charlie wants to court his daughter. Charlie is thrown out of the house and lands alongside the other man where another battle begins. ==Notes== Censors initially refused permission for A Woman to be shown in Great Britain. The reason is not entirely clear, but it could have been because a married man is trying to seduce a much younger woman or because of the transvestitism hinted at by Charlie disguising himself as a female. The ban on the film was lifted in 1916. Margie Reiger, the youthful actress who played the pretty girl in the park, is a bit of a mystery. Her acting credits show 13 appearances in silent films—all in 1915. Why her career suddenly ended and what became of her is unknown. Furthermore, no researcher has been able to find a date of birth or death for her. A Woman is the third and final time that Chaplin played the role of a female on film. He played a woman in two Keystone films: The Masquerader and A Busy Day. left ==Cast== * Charles Chaplin - Gentleman/'Nora Nettlerash' * Edna Purviance - Daughter of the House * Charles Inslee - Her Father * Marta Golden - Her Mother * Margie Reiger - Father's Lady Friend * Billy Armstrong - Father's Friend * Leo White - Idler in the Park ==External links== * * * Category:1915 films Category:American silent short films Category:American films Category:American black-and-white films Category:Short films directed by Charlie Chaplin Category:American comedy films Category:1915 comedy films Category:Essanay Studios films Category:Cross-dressing in American films Category:1915 short films Category:Articles containing video clips Category:Comedy short films ","title":"A Woman (1915 film)"},{"id":"2543944","text":"Ulukhaktok/Holman Airport, located at Ulukhaktok, Northwest Territories, Canada was fully opened in December 1978 with the start of the Community Aerodrome Radio Station (CARS). However, aircraft had been using the runway prior to that as construction was completed in the summer of 1978. The airport is north of the town and a road was built to allow access from the community, which also included a short bridge to span the Okpilik River. ==Early years== Prior to the construction of the airport all aircraft either landed on an ice strip in the winter or in the middle of town. The old runway ran from the shore of \\"Jacks Bay\\" to the centre of the community. Besides limiting the size of the aircraft, Douglas DC-3 or De Havilland Canada Dash 7, able to land it also was a potentially dangerous situation. The only advantages were the fact that freight could be unloaded very easily and MEDIVAC aircraft could park right outside the nursing station. In the late winter, early spring a bulldozer would be used to create a runway on the ice that could be used by larger aircraft such as the C-130 Hercules. ==General== The original buildings at the airport included a two-story airport terminal, an emergency power generator building and the aircraft refueling station. The terminal has since been replaced and a three-bay garage to house the maintenance vehicles has been added. At the time of construction the non-directional beacon (NDB) and control building were left just south of the community. The NDB was later moved (approximately 1981) to its present location at the airport. At the same time the control building was relocated to the airport. The runway is the standard gravel strip that is seen in most Canadian Arctic communities and is with the centre above sea level (ASL). Due to a slight hump in the land it is not possible to see one end of the runway from the other. The taxiway was originally wide; however, this had to be widened, to later to accommodate the four-engined Lockheed Electra. Lighting consists of: * Runway identification lights of the uni-directional flashing strobe type * Red/green threshold/runway end lights * Medium intensity (three settings) runway edge lights * Precision Approach Path Indicator (PAPI) lights, type P1 for aircraft with eye to wheel height of up to There is also a Type K ARCAL (Aircraft Radio Control of Aerodrome Lighting) system. However, the PAPI are not available with this system and can only be operated manually by a person at the airport. Currently the only fuel available is turbine kerosene (Type JET A) and it is provided by a local contractor. METAR weather services are provided on a limited basis locally and a call out can be arranged for weather at other times. The radio station operates the same hours as the weather service and is in fact the same person. They use the standard CARS mandatory frequency of 122.1 MHz and they also monitor the emergency frequency of 121.5 MHz. The CARS also monitor the NDB which broadcasts the morse code identification \\"HI\\" on 361 kHz. ==Problems== During the initial planning stages community consultation was held and a major concern was expressed over the runway headings. The new runway was to be almost 90° from the old runway and some people felt that the prevailing winds would cause flights to be cancelled due to high crosswinds. However, this was not too much of a problem as the hills around the community funnelled the winds almost directly down the runway. When the airport was originally constructed there was no provision for dedicated maintenance vehicles and they had to be shared with the community. This meant that after a blizzard the bulldozer and grader had just enough time to clear the road and runway before they had to return to town. This left the runway with high snow banks on either side, which caused the runway to fill in quickly with snow due to the almost constant winds that blow in the arctic. This then resulted in a high cost snow removal operation. The maintenance equipment would be run for almost 24 hours as a team of operators would push the snow back from the runway. After a few years a snow blower and plow-truck were purchased and a garage built to house them. ==Runway construction== Construction of the runway and associated facilities had begun in 1976 by Fred H. Ross & Associates (now Kitnuna Corporation) of Cambridge Bay, Nunavut. Gravel for the runway was obtained from the north bank of the Okpilik River and the area was left untouched. This became known as the \\"sand-pit\\" and is used frequently in the summer months as a race track for 2, 3 and 4 wheel motorcycles. Due to the situation of the airport, the community and the surrounding hills there is a \\"wind line\\" about halfway to the airport. The funnelling effect of the hills may cause the airport to be in a blizzard while the community is enjoying clear weather or vice versa. By early 1979 the snow problem was so great that the runway was no longer a straight line. There was a slight curve in it that was quickly removed after an aircraft caught its wing on the snow bank that resulted in Holman Airport's first accident (no injuries). ==Airlines and destinations== ==References== ==External links== Category:Airports in the Arctic Category:Certified airports in the Inuvik Region ","title":"Ulukhaktok/Holman Airport"},{"id":"2543947","text":"Potaro-Siparuni (Region 8) is a region of Guyana.

The story centers on Charlie's Little Tramp character and how he gets into trouble trying to grab the attention of the ladies on the beach. Edna Purviance plays one of the wives in whom he shows interest. It is said to be the first film to incorporate the classic gag of a man slipping on a banana skin. ==Synopsis== Charlie is eating a banana while wandering along the seashore on the Crystal Pier. He nonchalantly throws the banana peel away and quickly slips on it. Shortly thereafter Charlie encounters a drunk. The two men argue over their hats which have blown off their heads in a heavy wind.

Holcome Moor, to the north of the Peel Monument, looking east. The village is located on the slopes of Holcombe Moor. Much of the moorland around the village is in the care of the National Trust and is popular with walkers, cyclists and bird watchers. The buildings in the area are made up predominantly of stone cottages and farms. There is a public house called the Shoulder of Mutton, a restaurant, church, and primary school. At one time the village also had a shop, post office, a lock-up, and a regular bus service linking it to Holcombe Brook, a neighbouring village in the valley bottom one mile to the south. Holcombe is the home of the Holcombe Hunt. This pack of Harrier's, which has been kennelled at Holcombe for over 200 years, is one of the oldest in the country.

At the beginning it was supposed that, these domains serve as a substrate for their target kinase. Protein-protein interactions play a major role in cellular growth and development. Modular domains, which are the subunits of a protein, moderate these protein interactions by identifying short peptide sequences. These peptide sequences determine the binding partners of each protein. One of the more prominent domains is the SH2 domain. SH2 domains play a vital role in cellular communication. Its length is approximately 100 amino acids long and it is found within 111 human proteins. Regarding its structure, it contains 2 alpha helices and 7 beta strands. Research has shown that it has a high affinity to phosphorylated tyrosine residues and it is known to identify a sequence of 3-6 amino acids within a peptide motif. ==Binding and phosphorylation== SH2 domains typically bind a phosphorylated tyrosine residue in the context of a longer peptide motif within a target protein, and SH2 domains represent the largest class of known pTyr-recognition domains. Phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in a protein occurs during signal transduction and is carried out by tyrosine kinases. In this way, phosphorylation of a substrate by tyrosine kinases acts as a switch to trigger binding to an SH2 domain-containing protein. Many tyrosine containing short linear motifs that bind to SH2 domains are conserved across a wide variety of higher Eukaryotes. The intimate relationship between tyrosine kinases and SH2 domains is supported by their coordinate emergence during eukaryotic evolution. ==Diversity== SH2 domains are not present in yeast and appear at the boundary between protozoa and animalia in organisms such as the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum. A detailed bioinformatic examination of SH2 domains of human and mouse reveals 120 SH2 domains contained within 115 proteins encoded by the human genome, representing a rapid rate of evolutionary expansion among the SH2 domains. A large number of SH2 domain structures have been solved and many SH2 proteins have been knocked out in mice. == Function == The function of SH2 domains is to specifically recognize the phosphorylated state of tyrosine residues, thereby allowing SH2 domain-containing proteins to localize to tyrosine- phosphorylated sites. This process constitutes the fundamental event of signal transduction through a membrane, in which a signal in the extracellular compartment is \\"sensed\\" by a receptor and is converted in the intracellular compartment to a different chemical form, i.e. that of a phosphorylated tyrosine. Tyrosine phosphorylation leads to activation of a cascade of protein-protein interactions whereby SH2 domain-containing proteins are recruited to tyrosine-phosphorylated sites. This process initiates a series of events which eventually result in altered patterns of gene expression or other cellular responses. The SH2 domain, which was first identified in the oncoproteins Src and Fps, is about 100 amino-acid residues long. It functions as a regulatory module of intracellular signaling cascades by interacting with high affinity to phosphotyrosine-containing target peptides in a sequence- specific and strictly phosphorylation-dependent manner. == Applications == SH2 domains, and other binding domains, have been used in protein engineering to create protein assemblies. Protein assemblies are formed when several proteins bind to one another to create a larger structure (called a supramolecular assembly). Using molecular biology techniques, fusion proteins of specific enzymes and SH2 domains have been created, which can bind to each other to form protein assemblies. Since SH2 domains require phosphorylation in order for binding to occur, the use of kinase and phosphatase enzymes gives researchers control over whether protein assemblies will form or not. High affinity engineered SH2 domains have been developed and utilized for protein assembly applications. The goal of most protein assembly formation is to increase the efficiency of metabolic pathways via enzymatic co-localization. Other applications of SH2 domain mediated protein assemblies have been in the formation of high density fractal-like structures, which have extensive molecular trapping properties.Hernández N.E., Hansen W.A., Zhu D., Shea M.E., Khalid M., Manichev V., Putnins M., Chen M., Dodge A.G., Yang L., Marrero- Berríos I., Banal M., Rechani P., Gustafsson T., Feldman L.C., Lee S-.H., Wackett L.P., Dai W., Khare S.D.

A collector (biographer, colleague, friend, etc.) records impromptu comments by some famous person (made generally at the dining table or in small get-togethers), in anticipation of their lasting value. The precedent in classical literature was the account of a symposium, such as the Table Talk (Symposiaka) of Plutarch, though this was a supposed memoir of an occasion, rather than a person. This classical genre itself derives from the more philosophical dialogues written by the followers of Socrates, and in particular the Symposia of Plato and Xenophon. \\"Table talk\\" may also refer to a similar informal conversation, more deliberately engaged in by the famous person, with the direct intent of publication (somewhat analogous to granting an interview). ==Collections== Collections of such table talks by royal persons, celebrities, and other important personalities dating back to the 3rd century exist. The phrase table talk has been in use in the English language since the 16th century. As examples, published table talks exist for: * Martin Luther (1483–1546), see Table Talk; * John Selden (1584–1654); * John Milton (1608–1674); * Samuel Johnson (1707–1784); * Frederick the Great (1712–1786); * Johann von Goethe (1749–1832); * Napoleon Bonaparte (1769–1821); * Ludwig van Beethoven (1770–1827); * Samuel Taylor Coleridge (1772–1834); * Amos Bronson Alcott (1799–1888); * George Bernard Shaw (1856–1950); * Adolf Hitler (1889–1945), see \\"Hitler's Table Talk\\"; * Orson Welles (1915–1985). Occasionally, comments are collected from others by a notable person as part of that person's working notes and may survive in the papers of that person. Ralph Waldo Emerson, for example, kept notes on the conversations of his family and friends, many of whom, of course, were noteworthy. ==See also== * Gespräche mit Goethe ==Notes== == Further reading== ;Table talks by various authors * Samuel Taylor Coleridge: * Abraham Lincoln: * Martin Luther: * Samuel Johnson: * John Selden: Category:Oral communication Category:Non-fiction genres ","title":"Table talk (literature)"},{"id":"2544050","text":":For the 1974 film adaptation, see The Odessa File (film) The Odessa File is a thriller by Frederick Forsyth, first published in 1972, about the adventures of a young German reporter attempting to discover the location of a former SS concentration-camp commander. The name ODESSA is an acronym for the German phrase \\"Organisation der ehemaligen SS-Angehörigen\\", which translates as \\"Organisation of Former Members of the SS\\". The novel alleges that ODESSA was an international Nazi organisation established before the defeat of Nazi Germany for the purpose of protecting former members of the SS after the war. ==Plot== In November 1963, shortly after the assassination of John F. Kennedy, Peter Miller, a German freelance crime reporter, follows an ambulance to the apartment of Salomon Tauber, a Holocaust survivor who has committed suicide. The next day, Miller is given the dead man's diary by a friend in the Bundespolizei. After reading Tauber's life story and learning that Tauber had been in the Riga Ghetto commanded by Eduard Roschmann, \\"The Butcher of Riga\\", Miller resolves to search for Roschmann whom Tauber recognised a few days earlier, alive and prosperous, in Hamburg. Miller's attention is especially drawn to one diary passage in which Tauber describes having seen Roschmann shoot a German Army captain who was wearing a distinctive military decoration. Miller pursues the story and visits the State Attorney General's office and other offices where he learns that no one is prepared to search for or prosecute former Nazis. But his investigations take him to famed war criminal investigator Simon Wiesenthal, who tells him about \\"ODESSA\\". Miller is approached by a group of Jewish vigilantes with ties to the Mossad, who have vowed to search for German war criminals and kill them and have been attempting to infiltrate ODESSA. At their request, Miller agrees to infiltrate ODESSA himself and is trained to pass for a former Waffen-SS sergeant by a repentant ex-member of the SS. Miller visits a lawyer working for ODESSA and after passing severe scrutiny is sent to meet a passport forger who supplies those members who wish to escape. Slowly Miller unravels the entire system, but his cover is compromised, in part by his insistence on using his own car, which is associated with the journalist Miller, not the SS man he is impersonating, and ODESSA sets its top hitman on Miller's trail. Miller escapes one trap by sheer luck: the hitman later installs a bomb in Miller's car, but the car's stiff suspension prevents it from going off. Eventually Miller confronts Roschmann at gunpoint and forces him to read from Tauber's diary. Roschmann attempts to justify his actions to his \\"fellow Aryan\\" but is taken aback when Miller says he has not tracked down Roschmann for being a mass murderer of Jews. Rather, Miller directs him to the passage describing Roschmann's murder of the army captain, who Miller reveals to have been his father Erwin. All of Roschmann's arrogance and bravado deserts him, and he is reduced to begging for his life. Instead of killing him, however, Miller handcuffs Roschmann to the fireplace and says he plans to have him arrested and prosecuted. Miller is caught off guard when Roschmann's bodyguard returns to the house, disarms him and knocks him unconscious. The bodyguard drives to the village in Miller's car to telephone for help, but is killed when he drives over a snow-covered pole, an impact hard enough to trigger the bomb. Roschmann manages to escape, eventually flying to Argentina. The hitman who has been sent to kill Miller is instead killed by an Israeli agent Josef. While Miller is recovering in hospital, he is told what happened while he was unconscious. Josef warns him not to tell anyone the story. He does disclose that with Roschmann (code-named \\"Vulkan\\") in Argentina, West German authorities (at the urging of the Israelis) will shut down his industrial facility that was producing missile guidance systems for the Egyptian Army. ODESSA's plan throughout the novel - to obliterate the State of Israel by combining German technological know-how with Egyptian biological weapons - has been thwarted. In addition, Miller's information reaches the public and badly embarrasses the West German authorities enough for them to arrest and prosecute a large number of ODESSA members, though the book notes that ODESSA continues to exist and usually succeeds in keeping former SS members from facing justice. Josef, in reality Major Uri Ben-Shaul, an Israeli Army officer - returns to Israel to be debriefed, and performs one final duty. He has taken Tauber's diary with him and per the last request in the diary, Uri visits Yad Vashem and says Kaddish for the soul of Salomon Tauber. ==Film adaptation and SS Captain Eduard Roschmann== The film adaptation The Odessa File was released in 1974 starring Jon Voight and Maximilian Schell. It was directed by Ronald Neame with a score by Andrew Lloyd Webber. It is based rather loosely on the book, but it brought about the exposure of the real-life \\"Butcher of Riga\\", Eduard Roschmann. After the film was released to the public, he was arrested by the Argentinian police, skipped bail, and fled to Asunción, Paraguay where he died on 10 August 1977. ==Real life SS Members in the Novel== In The Odessa File the head of ODESSA is given as SS General Richard Glücks who is determined to destroy the State of Israel nearly two decades after the end of World War II, while the head of ODESSA in Germany is a former SS Officer called the \\"Werewolf\\" who is implied to be SS General Hans-Adolf Prützmann. (If the real Glücks had still been alive he would have been 74 years old and Prützmann would have been 62 in 1963. The part of Glücks in 1974 movie was played by Hannes Messemer). ==External links== *The Odessa File at the Internet Movie Database Category:1972 British novels Category:British novels adapted into films Category:British thriller novels Category:Novels by Frederick Forsyth Category:Novels set in Germany Category:Novels about journalists Category:Fiction set in 1963 Category:Hutchinson (publisher) books Category:Fictional Mossad agents Category:Novels about Nazi hunters ","title":"The Odessa File"},{"id":"2544051","text":"Adıyaman () is a Kurdish-majority city in southeastern Turkey, and the capital of the Adıyaman Province. ==Etymology== The city officially had the Ottoman Turkish name Hısn-ı Mansur (\\"Castle of Mansur\\") until the year 1926, named after the fortified castle perched on a hill around which the city grew. As the official name was difficult for the locals to pronounce, people were referring the city as adı yaman since early 19th century, which means \\"its name is tough\\" or \\"(the place) whose name is tough\\" in Turkish. Another likely origin of the modern Turkish name is the bad reputation that the province enjoyed due to difficult terrain and widespread banditry, hence \\"adı yaman\\", which can also translate as \\"(the place) which has a bad name (reputation)\\". In 1926, this term was adopted as the official name of the city. Although the word yaman had very negative connotations in Ottoman Turkish, it has earned a strong positive connotation in modern Turkish, just like the English word \\"terrific\\". ==History== Ruins of Perre Yenipinar Mosque The area has been inhabited as far back as it is possible to discover. Research in the cave of Palanlı 10 km north of Adıyaman show occupation in 40,000 BC and other digs in Samsat reveal continuous occupation through the stone and Bronze Ages. From 900BC onwards came waves of invasions from Assyrians, Persians, and Macedonians until the Greco-Iranian Commagene kingdom was founded in 69BC. This was the civilisation that built the statues on top of nearby Mount Nemrut. The capital was in Samsat (Samosata) but the town of Adıyaman was a walled city of the Commagenes. The city walls of Adıyaman have been restored and replaced many times since. The Commagene kingdom lasted until the Romans came in 72AD. Yet more campaigns and invasions followed and Adıyaman was controlled by Byzantines 395–670, Ummayads from 670 and then Abbasids 758–926. Then the area returned to Byzantine control during 859–1114. The Arabs returned from 1114 to 1204 and finally came the arrival of the Turks. The Arabic name for the castle and town was Hısn-ı Mansur. Turks moved into the area from 1114 onwards and for most of the 13th century was settled by the Selçuk Turks often disrupted by Mongol invasions. From 1298 to 1516 the town was under the control of the Mameluks. Adıyaman was brought into the Ottoman Empire by Selim I in 1516, but local power often rested with the Dulkadiroğulları tribe of Turkmen people that settled here.

In geometry, the orientation, angular position, attitude, or direction of an object such as a line, plane or rigid body is part of the description of how it is placed in the space it occupies. More specifically, it refers to the imaginary rotation that is needed to move the object from a reference placement to its current placement. A rotation may not be enough to reach the current placement. It may be necessary to add an imaginary translation, called the object's location (or position, or linear position). The location and orientation together fully describe how the object is placed in space. The above-mentioned imaginary rotation and translation may be thought to occur in any order, as the orientation of an object does not change when it translates, and its location does not change when it rotates. Euler's rotation theorem shows that in three dimensions any orientation can be reached with a single rotation around a fixed axis. This gives one common way of representing the orientation using an axis–angle representation. Other widely used methods include rotation quaternions, Euler angles, or rotation matrices. More specialist uses include Miller indices in crystallography, strike and dip in geology and grade on maps and signs. Unit vector may also be used to represent an object's normal vector orientation. Typically, the orientation is given relative to a frame of reference, usually specified by a Cartesian coordinate system. ==Mathematical representations== === Three dimensions === In general the position and orientation in space of a rigid body are defined as the position and orientation, relative to the main reference frame, of another reference frame, which is fixed relative to the body, and hence translates and rotates with it (the body's local reference frame, or local coordinate system). At least three independent values are needed to describe the orientation of this local frame. Three other values describe the position of a point on the object. All the points of the body change their position during a rotation except for those lying on the rotation axis. If the rigid body has rotational symmetry not all orientations are distinguishable, except by observing how the orientation evolves in time from a known starting orientation. For example, the orientation in space of a line, line segment, or vector can be specified with only two values, for example two direction cosines. Another example is the position of a point on the earth, often described using the orientation of a line joining it with the earth's center, measured using the two angles of longitude and latitude. Likewise, the orientation of a plane can be described with two values as well, for instance by specifying the orientation of a line normal to that plane, or by using the strike and dip angles. Further details about the mathematical methods to represent the orientation of rigid bodies and planes in three dimensions are given in the following sections. === Two dimensions === In two dimensions the orientation of any object (line, vector, or plane figure) is given by a single value: the angle through which it has rotated. There is only one degree of freedom and only one fixed point about which the rotation takes place. == Rigid body in three dimensions == Several methods to describe orientations of a rigid body in three dimensions have been developed. They are summarized in the following sections. ===Euler angles=== Euler angles, one of the possible ways to describe an orientation The first attempt to represent an orientation was owed to Leonhard Euler. He imagined three reference frames that could rotate one around the other, and realized that by starting with a fixed reference frame and performing three rotations, he could get any other reference frame in the space (using two rotations to fix the vertical axis and another to fix the other two axes). The values of these three rotations are called Euler angles. ====Tait–Bryan angles==== Tait–Bryan angles. Other way for describing orientation These are three angles, also known as yaw, pitch and roll, Navigation angles and Cardan angles. Mathematically they constitute a set of six possibilities inside the twelve possible sets of Euler angles, the ordering being the one best used for describing the orientation of a vehicle such as an airplane. In aerospace engineering they are usually referred to as Euler angles. A rotation represented by an Euler axis and angle. ===Orientation vector === Euler also realized that the composition of two rotations is equivalent to a single rotation about a different fixed axis (Euler's rotation theorem). Therefore, the composition of the former three angles has to be equal to only one rotation, whose axis was complicated to calculate until matrices were developed. Based on this fact he introduced a vectorial way to describe any rotation, with a vector on the rotation axis and module equal to the value of the angle. Therefore, any orientation can be represented by a rotation vector (also called Euler vector) that leads to it from the reference frame. When used to represent an orientation, the rotation vector is commonly called orientation vector, or attitude vector. A similar method, called axis–angle representation, describes a rotation or orientation using a unit vector aligned with the rotation axis, and a separate value to indicate the angle (see figure). ===Orientation matrix=== With the introduction of matrices, the Euler theorems were rewritten. The rotations were described by orthogonal matrices referred to as rotation matrices or direction cosine matrices. When used to represent an orientation, a rotation matrix is commonly called orientation matrix, or attitude matrix. The above- mentioned Euler vector is the eigenvector of a rotation matrix (a rotation matrix has a unique real eigenvalue). The product of two rotation matrices is the composition of rotations. Therefore, as before, the orientation can be given as the rotation from the initial frame to achieve the frame that we want to describe. The configuration space of a non-symmetrical object in n-dimensional space is SO(n) × Rn. Orientation may be visualized by attaching a basis of tangent vectors to an object. The direction in which each vector points determines its orientation. ===Orientation quaternion=== Another way to describe rotations is using rotation quaternions, also called versors. They are equivalent to rotation matrices and rotation vectors. With respect to rotation vectors, they can be more easily converted to and from matrices. When used to represent orientations, rotation quaternions are typically called orientation quaternions or attitude quaternions. == Plane in three dimensions == ===Miller indices=== Planes with different Miller indices in cubic crystals The attitude of a lattice plane is the orientation of the line normal to the plane, and is described by the plane's Miller indices. In three-space a family of planes (a series of parallel planes) can be denoted by its Miller indices (hkl), so the family of planes has an attitude common to all its constituent planes. ===Strike and dip=== Strike line and dip of a plane describing attitude relative to a horizontal plane and a vertical plane perpendicular to the strike line Many features observed in geology are planes or lines, and their orientation is commonly referred to as their attitude. These attitudes are specified with two angles. For a line, these angles are called the trend and the plunge. The trend is the compass direction of the line, and the plunge is the downward angle it makes with a horizontal plane. For a plane, the two angles are called its strike (angle) and its dip (angle). A strike line is the intersection of a horizontal plane with the observed planar feature (and therefore a horizontal line), and the strike angle is the bearing of this line (that is, relative to geographic north or from magnetic north). The dip is the angle between a horizontal plane and the observed planar feature as observed in a third vertical plane perpendicular to the strike line. ==Usage examples== ===Rigid body=== The orientation of a rigid body is determined by three angles The attitude of a rigid body is its orientation as described, for example, by the orientation of a frame fixed in the body relative to a fixed reference frame. The attitude is described by attitude coordinates, and consists of at least three coordinates. One scheme for orienting a rigid body is based upon body-axes rotation; successive rotations three times about the axes of the body's fixed reference frame, thereby establishing the body's Euler angles. Another is based upon roll, pitch and yaw, although these terms also refer to incremental deviations from the nominal attitude ==See also== * Attitude control * Personal relative direction * Plane of rotation * Rotation formalisms in three dimensions * Triad Method ==References== ==External links== * Category:Euclidean geometry Category:Rigid bodies Category:Rotation in three dimensions ","title":"Orientation (geometry)"},{"id":"2544104","text":"Boom Boom Chi Boom Boom is a 1988 album by Tom Tom Club and included the band's cover of the Velvet Underground track \\"Femme Fatale\\" with David Byrne on backing vocals.

The film marks the last time Edna Purviance co-starred with Chaplin and the last film he made for First National. Purviance also starred in Chaplin's A Woman of Paris (1923), in which Chaplin had a brief cameo. It was Chaplin's second-shortest feature film, constructed more like a two-reeler from earlier in his career. It is also noted as the first film for Charles Reisner, who became a successful director. In 1959, Chaplin included The Pilgrim as one of three films comprising The Chaplin Revue. Slightly re-edited and fully re-scored, the film contained the song \\"I'm Bound For Texas\\", written and composed by Chaplin, and sung by Matt Monro. The Pilgrim is one of many works from 1923 that entered the public domain in the United States in 2019. ==Plot== The Pilgrim, an escaped convict, steals a minister's clothes to replace his prison uniform. At a train station, he encounters an eloping couple who want him to marry them. The woman's father shows up and takes her away. The convict then picks a destination at random and ends up in Devil's Gulch, Texas on a Sunday. A delegation is waiting to welcome their new parson. With the sheriff nearby, the Pilgrim has to keep playing his part. A large deacon takes him to the church, where he improvises a sermon about David and Goliath. It has been arranged for the parson to board with Mrs. Brown and her attractive daughter. The latter and the Pilgrim are attracted to each other. A complication arises when the crook, the Pilgrim's old cellmate, spots him. Curious, the man pretends to be the Pilgrim's old college friend and is invited to tea by Mrs. Brown. Among the other guests are a man and wife and their young boy, who proceeds to annoy everyone. Also present is the large deacon, who refuses to accept Mrs. Brown's mortgage payment on the Sabbath. Despite the Pilgrim's best efforts, the crook later steals the money and flees. The Pilgrim promises Miss Brown he will get the money back. After he leaves, however, the sheriff shows the young woman a wanted poster for her boarder. The crook heads to a casino. Despite a robbery in progress, the Pilgrim manages to retrieve the money. He gives it and the church collection to Miss Brown. When he is apprehended by the sheriff, Miss Brown comes to his defense, revealing what he has done. As a result, the sheriff takes his prisoner to the border and orders him to pick him some flowers on Mexican land. Not taking the hint, the Pilgrim returns. The sheriff has to literally kick him out of American jurisdiction before he recognizes the lawman's act of kindness. However, his enjoyment of the peace of a new land proves to be short-lived; several gunmen pop out of the undergrowth and start shooting at each other. The frightened Pilgrim hastens away, straddling the border as he ponders his options. ==Cast== * Charles Chaplin – The Pilgrim (Lefty Lombard according to a newspaper) * Edna Purviance – Miss Brown * Sydney Chaplin – Eloper / Train Conductor / Little Boy's Father * Mack Swain – Deacon Jones * Loyal Underwood – Small Deacon * Dean Riesner – Little Boy * Charles Reisner – Howard Huntington, alias Nitro Nick, alias Picking Pete * Tom Murray – Sheriff Bryan * Henry Bergman – Sheriff on Train / Man in Railroad Station * Marion Davies - Congregation member (uncredited) * Kitty Bradbury – Mrs. Brown * Mai Wells – Little Boy's Mother ==Reception== Chaplin biographer Jeffrey Vance considers The Pilgrim to be an important work and gives the film careful consideration in his 2003 book Chaplin: Genius of the Cinema in contrast to other Chaplin biographers.Vance, Jeffrey (2003). Chaplin: Genius of the Cinema. New York: Harry N. Abrams, pg. 128-133. Vance writes, \\"The Pilgrim is one of Chaplin's richest—and most neglected—films.\\"Vance, Jeffrey (2003). Chaplin: Genius of the Cinema. New York: Harry N. Abrams, pg. 128. . Vance praises the film's economy of action, classical theatrical roots (including Molière and the British music-hall), the sharp edge to the film's comedy, and the ironic ending with Chaplin's character straddling the international line between the U.S. and Mexico.Vance, Jeffrey (2003). Chaplin: Genius of the Cinema. New York: Harry N. Abrams, pg. 130-133. In its generally positive February 26, 1923 review, The New York Times said, \\"No, this picture is not the equal of The Kid. It lacks that comedy's subtleties, it isn't as sharply pointed with humanity, it isn't as finely characterized, but it's a genuine Chaplin, nevertheless.\\" In the 1952 Sight & Sound poll, the great French film critic Andre Bazin picked The Pilgrim as one of the 10 greatest movies of all time. ==References* * * The Pilgrim at Virtual History Category:1923 comedy films Category:1923 films Category:American films Category:American comedy films Category:American silent feature films Category:American black-and-white films Category:Short films directed by Charlie Chaplin Category:Films set in Texas Category:First National Pictures films ","title":"The Pilgrim (1923 film)"},{"id":"2544111","text":"Tara is the name of a fictional plantation in the state of Georgia, in the historical novel Gone with the Wind (1936) by Margaret Mitchell. In the story, Tara is located from Jonesboro (originally spelled Jonesborough), in Clayton County, on the east side of the Flint River about south of Atlanta. Mitchell modeled Tara after local plantations and antebellum establishments, particularly the Clayton County plantation on which her maternal grandmother, Annie Fitzgerald Stephens (1844–1934), the daughter of Irish immigrant Philip Fitzgerald (1798–1880) and his American wife, Eleanor Avaline \\"Ellen\\" McGhan (1818–1893), was born and raised. However, the original plantation house of the Fitzgeralds, which was known as \\"Rural Home,\\" a two-story wooden structure, was not as palatial and glamorous as the one described in the novel and/or depicted in the 1939 movie Gone with the Wind. Twelve Oaks, a neighboring plantation in the novel, is now the name of many businesses and a high school stadium in nearby Lovejoy, Georgia. ==In Gone with the Wind== In Gone with the Wind, Tara was founded by Irish immigrant Gerald O'Hara after he won or one square mile of land from its absentee owner during an all-night poker game. An Irish peasant farmer rather than the merchant his elder brothers (whose emigrations to Savannah had brought him to Georgia) wanted him to be, Gerald relished the thought of becoming a planter and gave his mostly wilderness and uncultivated new lands the grandiose name of Tara after the Hill of Tara, once the capital of the High King of ancient Ireland. He borrowed money from his brothers and bankers to buy slaves and turned the farm into a very successful cotton plantation. Gerald realized that the manor house needed a feminine touch and domestic servants. Consulting with his valet, Pork, whom he had won in a card game, he was told, \\"whut you needs is a wife, and a wife whut has got plen'y of house niggers.\\"Margaret Mitchell, Gone With The Wind (1936) So Gerald set off to Savannah to look for a wife meeting this qualification. At 43, Gerald married the 15-year-old Ellen Robillard, a wealthy Savannah-born girl of French descent, receiving as dowry twenty slaves (including Mammy, Ellen's nurse, who became nurse to Ellen's daughters and grandchildren as well). His young bride took a very real interest in the management of the plantation, being in some ways a more hands-on manager than her husband. With the injection of her dowry money and the rise of cotton prices, Tara grew to a plantation of more than and more than 100 slaves by the dawn of the Civil War. In the first quarter of the novel, the O'Haras are enthusiastically partisan in support of the Confederacy. Nevertheless, even before the tide has turned irreversibly against the Confederacy following Gettysburg and Vicksburg, the plantation (along with the other great land- holdings in the county) has already suffered major deprivation because of the war and has descended into disrepair. Shortages caused by the Union blockade and the Confederate requisitioning of supplies and slaves have turned the home from a house of plenty to one of mere subsistence, while the inability to sell their cotton to England has also greatly diminished the family's once-lavish income and lifestyle. The arrival of Sherman's troops in Clayton County terrifies those slaves who have not already departed or been conscripted into the labor force by the Confederacy. By the time Union troops arrive at Tara, only the house slaves remain. Unlike the homes of most of the O'Haras' neighbors, Tara is spared the torch during the Union's Scorched Earth Policy. The life-threatening illness, from typhoid, of Ellen O'Hara and her younger daughters, Suellen and Carreen, causes Gerald to stand firm in the doorway of his house, \\"as if he had an army behind him rather than before him\\", and earns the sympathy of a Union officer who orders his surgeon to treat the O'Hara women with laudanum and quinine. The officer commandeers the house for use as a Union field headquarters, but as a courtesy, it is spared. However, movable items of value (including Ellen's rosary, pictures, and china) are confiscated (or stolen), and larger items are vandalized by the withdrawing Union troops. Mammy hides the family silver in the well. The army also chops down the trees surrounding the home, destroys the outbuildings, uses much of the fencing for firewood, slaughters the livestock, and pillages the vegetable gardens and fruit orchards for its own use. Soldiers even destroy what is not yet ripe and unearth graves in the family and slave cemeteries to search for valuables buried under false headstones. The most expensive blow comes when the troops torch more than $158,331 worth of baled cotton (in 2014 currency ). (The O'Haras had been unable to sell the cotton to English merchants, owing to the blockade, and thus it was still awaiting transport.) Upon the army's withdrawal, the family and their loyal remaining slaves are left with a looted and dilapidated house, a ruined farm with no stock, work animals, or farm equipment, no food and no means to produce food. They are indigent and soon starving. Ellen O'Hara dies soon after the Union evacuation, and her widowed oldest daughter Scarlett returns a day later, initial delight at finding the house still standing soon turning to despair at its ruination. The loss of his wife, combined with hopelessness, poverty, age, and an increasing reliance on whiskey (when it is available) is destroying Gerald O'Hara's sanity, leaving him a demented echo of his former self. The plantation and house continue to be visited by both rebel and Union troops throughout the war, both sides taking any remnants of food and items of value left to the family. Scarlett, however, leads her complaining sister Suellen, and semi-stunned and emotionally numb sister Carreen, and the house slaves (all unaccustomed to hard manual labor), in harvesting the remaining cotton plants. She manages to salvage a few hundred pounds of the crop (enough to trade for food, perhaps) but sees her labor rendered useless when a small detachment of Union troops finds the cotton in a slave cabin and sets it ablaze. When one of the soldiers is prevented, by his commanding officer, from taking a gilded sword that once belonged to Scarlett's long-dead father-in-law and intended for her little boy Wade Hamilton (the officer is himself a veteran of the same campaigns as the sword's former owner), the thwarted Yankee soldier expresses his indignation by secretly setting a wing of the house on fire as the Yankees are leaving. The family (which at this point, includes the convalescent Melanie Wilkes, Scarlett's sister-in-law by her marriage to her first husband-Melanie's dead brother-Charles Hamilton) extinguishes the flames before they can spread, but the mansion is further damaged. When a Union deserter attempts to rob and rape Scarlett, she kills him in self-defense and vengeance. With the tiny windfall of money he was carrying, and with his horse and the aid of Will Benteen, a Confederate private and amputee nursed through a near-fatal fever by the O'Haras, the land is planted once again, on a subsistence scale. The family is able to eke out a very meager living, leaving them constantly hungry but at least not homeless or starving. Peace returns after the war, but not prosperity. Scarlett manages to save Tara from being seized and the family from dispossession only by deceitfully marrying her sister Suellen's fiance, Frank Kennedy, and using his savings to pay the $300 in taxes levied on the place. Though Scarlett returns to Atlanta where her fortunes rise as she takes over and expands her second husband Frank's business interests, she shares her new wealth with Tara. Tara never achieves anything like its antebellum grandeur, but it does become self-supporting as a \\"two horse\\" farm. While far from rich, the O'Haras are at least in better condition than most of their neighbors. While Scarlett is in Atlanta, Suellen, the sister whom Scarlett's husband truly loved, conspires with the hated carpetbaggers and scalawags to defraud the victorious United States government of $150,000 by having her senile father swear an oath that his family was pro-Union during the war; therefore, the cotton burned and the damages done to the place were not justified. The plan backfires and leads to the accidental death of Gerald. It also leads to the social ostracism of Suellen by her neighbors and even some of her relatives, though ironically it increases her worth (slightly) in the eyes of her pragmatic sister Scarlett, who privately believes the plan was brilliant. In 1868, Rhett and Scarlett get married. Rhett has Tara restored the way it was before the war. Rhett and Scarlett have a house built in Atlanta. Though Scarlett resides in Atlanta, she considers Tara her true home. The house is restored and refurnished, the outbuildings are rebuilt, the fields are again stocked with cattle, turkeys, and horses, the land is again planted with cotton (raised now by poor white and free black sharecroppers). By the end of the novel, Tara has come to resemble, as closely as it can, the beautiful red-earthed plantation it was before the war. Scarlett, however, is unable to find peace or happiness. Though she has come back from defeat and starvation to become one of the wealthiest women in the south and is even far richer and more spoiled than she ever expected to be, she feels miserable and empty. Most of this is due to, first her hopeless love for Ashley Wilkes, later her loss of Rhett's love (unfortunately, after realizing Rhett is the one she loves), and the death of their daughter Bonnie (and perhaps her loss of Melanie's friendship through her death, as well). After Rhett leaves Scarlett, she returns to Tara, declaring that she will win back his love one day. Many critics state that Tara ultimately symbolizes Scarlett's spirit or character. Initially, it is a thing of pompous but shallow beauty, then a place of desolation but nevertheless still standing when the neighboring homes are not, and finally as beautiful as ever but bereft of life and happiness. ==In Rhett Butler's People== In the 2007 novel by Donald McCaig, Rhett Butler's People, Tara stays virtually the same as in Gone With the Wind. However, at the end of this novel, which was the authorized Margaret Mitchell estate sequel to Gone With the Wind, the crazed Isaiah Watling sets fire to the main staircase of the mansion, which burns to the ground. ==The house== When Gerald first takes possession of the property, he and his slave valet Pork (also acquired by Gerald in a poker game) inhabit the small, four-room overseer's house that remained standing after the former mansion burned down. The enslaved population builds Tara on the site of the old house and add to it as is necessary. It is a large, rambling affair of whitewashed brick and timber \\"built according to no architectural plan whatever, with extra rooms added where and when it seemed convenient\\". Its charm comes from Ellen's grace and sophistication. According to the description in the novel, the house has at least two hallways, a full basement, front and back stairs, and an attic. ==Movie set== For the 1939 motion picture, the home was constructed by art director Lyle Wheeler. After filming concluded, the façade of Tara sat on the Forty Acres backlot owned by RKO Pictures and then Desilu Productions. The Tara house façade looks very similar to the home of Barbara Stanwyck's character Victoria Barkley in the CBS series The Big Valley. That set was built on the Republic studio lot in Encino for the John Wayne movie The Fighting Kentuckian. In 1959, Southern Attractions, Inc. purchased the façade, which was dismantled and shipped to Georgia with plans to relocate it to the Atlanta area as a tourist attraction.Los Angeles Times, May 17, 1959, p. G10.Jennifer W. Dickey, \\"A Tough Little Patch of History\\": Atlanta's Marketplace for Gone With the Wind Memory , Ph.D. dissertation, Georgia State University, 2007, pp. 85–89. Producer David O. Selznick commented at the time, > Nothing in Hollywood is permanent. Once photographed, life here is ended. It > is almost symbolic of Hollywood. Tara had no rooms inside. It was just a > façade. So much of Hollywood is a façade.Murray Schumach, \\"Hollywood Gives > Tara to Atlanta,\\" New York Times, May 25, 1959, p. 33. However, the Margaret Mitchell estate refused to license anything that sought to capitalize on the novel's fame and popularity, including the movie set, citing Mitchell's dismay at how little it resembled her description in her novel. In 1979, what remained of the set—doorway, windows, shutters, cornice, steps and breezeway to the kitchen, and elements of the kitchen itself—was purchased for $5,000 by Betty Talmadge, the former wife of former governor and U.S. Senator Herman Talmadge.Margalit Fox, \\"Betty Talmadge, Ex-Wife of Georgia Senator, Dies at 81,\\" New York Times, May 12, 2005. She had the front door of the Tara set restored. After a 1989 exhibit at the Atlanta History Center, she lent it for permanent display at the Margaret Mitchell House and Museum in Midtown Atlanta, Georgia.Tour Information , Margaret Mitchell House & Museum. A short time later, K. C. Bassham, an inn owner in Concord, Georgia, agreed to purchase the set from Mrs. Talmadge and actually took possession of a window and shutter from the set. Bassham set up her inn as a period piece and decorated it with reproduction mementos from the film. In spite of the restored front door and fanlight, she believed that the movie set, which she characterized as \\"plywood and papier-mâché,\\" was so deteriorated that it could never be resurrected again. Her vision was to cut up the set and sell rectangular sections along with a picture of Tara and a certificate of authenticity.Jennifer W. Dickey, \\"A Tough Little Patch of History\\": Atlanta's Marketplace for Gone With the Wind Memory, Ph.D. dissertation, Georgia State University, 2007, pp. 120–121. Talmadge eventually decided to keep the Tara set, and it remained in storage at the time of her death in 2005. For years the set was also thought to have existed on Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's backlot #2 in Culver City, CA. Bulldozing Southern mansion The Case of the Missing Mansion This urban myth was the result of former MGM tour guides who had been instructed to mislead tourists into thinking that a southern mansion set on backlot #2 was the famed Gone with the Wind set. In fact, years later an article in the Los Angeles Times chronicled the demolition of the mansion and relied on the false information given by the tour guides. This news report only furthered the confusion over the true whereabouts of the actual Tara set. Now the Tara facade is still located at Talmadge Farms in Lovejoy, Georgia and is being resurrected. ==Namesakes== *The section of US 41 and US 19 from Interstate 75 south through Jonesboro to the Clayton/Henry county line is called Tara Boulevard, in honor of the book and movie, and the placement of the fictitious plantation near the town.

Also working as an Audi Car salesman at the time, he later had a change of heart after the band's bass player Stove King played him a demo of their new song \\"Wide Open Space\\". Rathbone joined Mansun shortly before their debut album Attack of the Grey Lantern was finished. He was the third and final drummer in the band, brought in after the band had \\"internal conflict\\" with the previous members. Rathbone's initiation into the band wasn't without mishap; arriving for his first live gig with the band, flicking through a copy of the NME for details, Rathbone found he had got the wrong train and instead of the correct destination of Brighton, he had in fact arrived at Bristol Temple Meads. Shortly after, his first proper gig with the band was a televised appearance on Channel 4 show TFI Friday, where the band performed \\"Stripper Vicar\\". The band released three studio album before splitting in 2003 whilst recording their fourth. Material from those session was released in 2004 as part of the Kleptomania boxset.

Cilydd agrees, and Goleuddydd eventually dies. Goleuddydd orders her confessor to visit her grave every year and keep it well trimmed, lest anything should grow there. Cilydd sends an attendant to her grave every day, to look for the briar. After seven years of this, the confessor neglects his duties. One day whilst out hunting, apparently several years later, Cilydd happens upon the grave, and sees upon it a briar with two blossoms. He takes this as a sign to remarry. He kills King Doged at some point and marries his widow.

Since 1983, Freindlich has been a leading actress of the Bolshoi Drama in St. Petersburg, Russia. ==Biography== Alisa Freindlich was born into the family of Bruno Freindlich,Алиса Фрейндлих: «Наверное, я неправильная бабушка» a prominent actor and People's Artist of the USSR. She is of German and Russian ancestry. Her father and paternal relatives were ethnic Germans living in Russia for more than a century. In her childhood years, Alisa Freindlich attended the drama and music classes of the Leningrad Palace of Pioneers. During the Second World War she survived the 900-day-long Nazi siege of Leningrad and continued her school studies after the war. In the 1950s she studied acting at the Leningrad State Institute of Theatre, Music and Cinema, graduating in 1957 as actress. From 1957 to 1961 Alisa Freindlich was a member of the troupe at Komissarjevskaya Theatre in Leningrad. Then she joined the Lensovet Theatre company, but in 1982, she had to leave it following her divorce from the theatre's director, Igor Vladimirov. Thereupon director Georgy Tovstonogov invited her to join the troupe of BDT in which she works to this day. Although Freindlich put a premium on her stage career, she starred in several notable movies, including Eldar Ryazanov's enormously popular comedy Office Romance (1977), the long- banned epic Agony (1975) and Tarkovsky'sАлиса Фрейндлих.

They wrote their own music, and were described as synthpop and dance. They achieved mainly local success, but appeared as an opening band for Culture Club, Eurythmics, and Information Society. ==History== Kubiszewski and Freer in 1984 The band's first single, \\"Dance the Night Away,\\" was backed with an earlier recording, \\"Who Knows Why,\\" by Kubiszewski and Nick Capetanakis (who performed with Kubiszewski in a prior group.) The order of the songs was accidentally flipped on the record, so the older song appeared as the A side. \\"Who Knows Why\\" received moderate local radio play and became a surprise hit in Japan. The band eventually grew to five members. Adams left to do orchestral work, but Mark Best and Frank Vale signed on. Then by 1985, Trent Reznor (who later formed Nine Inch Nails) joined the band on keyboards, programming and backing vocals. Shortly after that, Freer departed the band for the Norrköping Symphony Orchestra and was replaced by Reznor's roommate, Chris Vrenna who would also later join Reznor in Nine Inch Nails. Still, this was clearly Kubiszewski's band as neither Reznor nor Vrenna wrote any of the songs. By 1988, the band had broken up. ===Reformation=== Kubiszewski reformed with a new line-up including Doug Beck and Richard Carpenter, and released the group's first CD Equilibrium. In 1990, Doug Beck left, and Nick Rushe joined on keyboards. The band signed to Alpha International Records out of Philadelphia, PA for what was to be their next album. Instead, Alpha repackaged Equilibrium, cutting several tracks, and adding the new song \\"Imagination\\" to lead off the disc. Alpha was bought out just days after \\"Imagination\\" was released as a single. After Rushe departed, Rodney Shields (keyboards) and Marty Step (guitar) joined, rounding out would be the final Exotic Birds' line-up. In 1993, Kubiszewski left to play drums with The The, but returned for one final gig on Saturday, January 22, 1994. Reznor, Vale and non-Exotic Birds member Mark Addison were the fictional band \\"The Problems\\" in Paul Schrader's 1987 Cleveland set movie Light of Day featuring Michael J. Fox and Joan Jett. One-time Exotic Birds manager John Malm was Reznor's long-time manager and co-founder of Nothing Records. Kubiszewski played percussion on some of Reznor's early Nine Inch Nails tracks and went on to drum for The The, Crowded House, Prick and Stabbing Westward. To this day, Freer, now with the Cleveland Orchestra, and Adams, with the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, remain close friends and often teach together. ==Discography== ===\\"Who Knows Why\\" / \\"Dance the Night Away\\" 7\\" (1983)=== # \\"Who Knows Why\\" (A.

The goal of the game is to guide a small submarine through a variety of undersea caverns, collecting pieces of a ruined space capsule. Like other games by The Learning Company, Operation Neptune is educational and was intended for players age nine to fourteen (grades three through ten).Operation Neptune User's Guide It was released as part of the Super Solvers series for a time. == The game == The back story of the game is as follows: A team of astronauts and scientists have begun a secret research project on a distant planet. The research team's results were sent back to Earth on the \\"Galaxy space capsule\\", which malfunctioned, crashed into the ocean, and broke into many pieces. The capsule included several data canisters, each of which contains small snippets of the scientists' story, which is revealed to the player as the game progresses and data canisters are found. The capsule also contained some toxic chemicals, which have begun to leak out and threaten the health of the world's sea life. A recovery mission, codenamed Operation Neptune, is sent to recover the pieces of the capsule. The game consists of two campaigns, called Voyager Game and Expert Game; the player selects one when creating a new save file. ==Gameplay== In both the Voyager Game and Expert Game campaigns, the player must complete sixteen levels, called Sectors, which are distributed across five Zones: Dragon Reef, Fossil Trench, Limestone Ridge, Sea Forest, and Hammerhead. ===Piloting the Neptune=== The game is action-oriented for the most part. In each Sector, the player's goal is to navigate a submarine (the Neptune) through maze-like passages, collect every data capsule, and reach the supply station at the end. The box cover illustration rendered by Marc Ericksen envisions the Neptune submarine recovery vehicle hovering above the basin of Fossil Trench recovering glowing toxic data capsules. The levels are presented in a flip-screen fashion. Along the way the player will encounter various aggressive and/or territorial sea creatures, which usually move about the level and perform actions in predictable and repeating patterns, as well as non-living hazards like sharp rocks and undersea volcanoes. If the Neptune makes contact with an enemy or hazard, it will lose Oxygen. The Neptune is capable of firing ink pellets to stun sea creatures and render them harmless to touch, in the manner of an octopus or squid.. However, the functionality of ink pellets is limited; enemies stunned in this way will recover and resume their dangerous behavior after a few seconds. Furthermore, the ink pellets are fired in a straight line from the nose of the Neptune, so the player must carefully aim their shots at their intended targets. Finally, the player is limited to only 21 ink pellets per Sector, with no way to replenish their supply during the level. Thus, the player cannot rely on ink pellets to keep the Neptune out of danger, and should only use them in desperate situations. In the Final Sector of either campaign, ink pellets are rendered entirely (or almost entirely) ineffective. To reliably avoid loss of Oxygen and conserve ink pellets, the player must exercise skill in avoiding enemy formations. Whenever the Neptune enters a new screen, the player is expected to stop and study the behavior of upcoming obstacles, plan their movements in advance, and then execute those movements successfully. ===Solving problems=== The game will frequently break away from the action-oriented gameplay to present the player with math problems to solve. In problem-solving mode, the game employs a distinctly different interface, presenting text on one side of the screen and an illustration on the other. The math challenge takes the form of a word problem, and it is up to the player to determine the order of operations involved and arrive at the correct solution. Inputting an incorrect solution causes the player to lose Oxygen. If the Neptune survives the problem, the game then returns to action- game mode, resuming precisely where the player left off. Each Sector contains three invisible and unavoidable trigger points; when the Neptune crosses one of these trigger points, a chime plays and a beacon on the Neptune flashes. These trigger points are generally placed a safe distance away from enemies and hazards, so that the player will not be distracted during a difficult maneuver. After a few seconds, the game switches to problem-solving mode, and presents a word problem randomly selected from a set of problems appropriate for the current difficulty setting. The word problems are themed after situations that might concern a submarine pilot on a scientific expedition. ====Types of math problems==== * Ballast Control Panel: Given a list of ten numbers and a sum S, the player must choose any combination of numbers from the list that add up exactly to S. This is framed in-story as the Neptune pilot needing to adjust the ballast in order to control the submarine's ascent or descent rate. In Voyager Game, the player typically selects from a list of numbers typically found in denominations of United States coin money (i.e. 1, 5, 10, 25). In Expert Game, the player typically selects from a list of powers of two (e.g. 1, 2, 4, 8, 16). * Sonar: The Neptune pilot is informed of an upcoming obstacle. Given the obstacle's current distance and rate of approach, the player must calculate the time to reach the obstacle, in the requested unit of time (either hours or minutes). * Search Grid: Given a partially filled grid, the player is asked to calculate the area of either the shaded or unshaded region. * Toxicity Graph: Given a bar chart, the player is asked to interpret two values and calculate the difference. This is framed in-story as the surface ship requesting data on the ecological impact of the Galaxy space capsule. * Scale: This problem may occur when the Neptune acquires certain normal capsule pieces. The player must round the exact mass to a less precise value. * Distance Traveled Chart: Given the average speed of the Neptune and a duration of time, the player must calculate the total distance traveled. * Window Crack: This problem may occur when the Neptune travels through certain tight corridors. In-story, the Neptune's window has cracked, and the exact length of the crack must be accurately reported in order for the window to be replaced at the next supply station. The game displays a black line aligned alongside a ruler, and the player must determine the length of the black line. In later versions of this problem, the player is expected to report the length as a mixed number. * Water Tank: In this problem's framing, the Neptune has a limited freshwater supply, and will not be able to replenish it at the next supply station. Given a volume of freshwater and a rate of usage per day, the player must calculate the number of days that the Neptune's pilot can survive on the current supply. * Temperature: In-story, a malfunction in the Neptune's onboard battery has reduced its electrical output, and the pilot must act to both conserve energy and preserve their food supply. The player must read an on-screen thermometer and calculate the appropriate temperature adjustment as requested in the problem. * Clock: The game shows an analog clock which displays the time in military format. The player must calculate either a time or duration, depending on what the problem requests. * Power Supply: The game displays a line chart, where the X-axis represents the Neptune's energy usage per hour and the Y-axis represents the Neptune's speed. Given that the Neptune will travel at S speed for T hours, the player must read the chart, determine the Neptune's energy usage per hour based on S, then multiply by T hours to calculate the Neptune's estimated energy usage over that duration. * Radio- Telephone Signals: In-story, the Neptune is required to communicate with the surface ship at regular intervals. Given that the surface ship expects N contacts per hour, the player must calculate the duration of the intervals in between contacts. * Oil Supply: Given a maximum oil supply and a gauge which displays remaining oil supply in ten equal increments, the player must read the gauge and accurately report the Neptune's remaining oil supply. * Capsule Piece Inventory: In this problem, the player must calculate the sum of five individual weights listed in ounces, and report the total weight in pounds. The player is expected to use a calculator to accomplish this task. * Speed Graph: Given a bar chart, the player is asked to interpret six values and calculate the arithmetic mean of those values. * Navigation Chart: Given a latitude-longitude chart with two markers, the player must calculate the latitudinal or longitudinal difference of those markers in degrees. In-story, the supply ship is requesting the Neptune's relative distance from the next supply station. * Speed Indicator: The game displays a speedometer. The player must read the speedometer and input a new speed as requested by the problem. For example, the Neptune is traveling at 18 MPH, and the problem requests that the pilot reduce their speed by 1/3 of the current value; in this case the player must input a value of 12. * Toxicity Level Graph: Not to be confused with the similarly-themed Toxicity Graph problem. In this problem, the game displays a line chart, where the X-axis represents time (with intervals marked in military time), and the Y-axis represents toxicity in PPM, with one Y-value being marked as \\"Normal\\". The player must read the graph and accurately report the number of minutes for which the region's toxicity was above \\"Normal\\". * Depth Gauge: The game displays a graphic indicating the Neptune's depth in feet, and the player must convert this reading into fathoms. The problem initially hides the conversion method from the player; after one wrong answer, the game reveals that 6 feet = 1 fathom. * Water Pressure: The game displays a line chart, where the X-axis is the Neptune's depth in feet and the Y-axis is the water pressure in PSI. Given a depth in feet, the player must use the chart to determine the current water pressure. * Data Canister: In every Sector, the player must collect one data canister. Upon making contact with the canister, the game instantly transitions to problem-solving mode. All data canister problems feature an arithmetic or geometric sequence five numbers long, with one of the numbers in the sequence removed; the player must calculate the missing number. Upon completing the sequence (or failing twice with enough surplus Oxygen), the player is rewarded with one part of a 15-part story. These data canisters are often found in hazardous locations, so the player must be prepared to move the Neptune to safety as soon as they are finished interacting with them. When the Neptune makes contact with a data canister. * Combination Lock: At the end of every Sector is a supply station, which the player can only access by first obtaining all collectible items in that Sector. When the Neptune touches the supply station's door with all items collected, the game instantly transitions to problem-solving mode. All supply station problems feature a combination lock which serves as a timing-based math puzzle. The game first rotates the inner lock to generate an arithmetic equation; the outer lock then begins to rotate, and the player must stop the lock at the right time, when the correct answer lines up with the arrow. The player is presented with two arithmetic equations, and if the Neptune survives through both, the player successfully completes the Sector. The Final Sector features no math problems. ===Managing oxygen=== At the start of a new game, the Neptune has four Oxygen units (health) and two Oxygen Tanks (lives). If the Neptune runs out of Oxygen at any point, the Neptune is destroyed. When the Neptune is destroyed, if the player has at least one Oxygen Tank available, they are sent back sent back to the last checkpoint; otherwise, the player loses all progress made in the current Sector, as the Neptune is sent back to the start of the current Sector, all collectible items are returned to their original positions, and all previously solved math problems have to be solved again. Touching any enemy or hazard causes the Neptune to lose one Oxygen unit. When Oxygen is lost this way, if the Neptune still has Oxygen remaining, the Neptune is granted temporary invulnerability, allowing them to escape immediate danger and prevent further loss of Oxygen. Giving an incorrect answer while in problem-solving mode also costs one Oxygen unit. While in problem-solving mode, if the Neptune has at least three Oxygen units to start with, and gives two incorrect answers, the game will display the correct solution to the problem and allow the player to continue as though the problem had been solved normally. In most Sectors, a dolphin named Zoom appears in one of the screens. If the Neptune touches Zoom, one of two beneficial effects happen: either the Neptune's Oxygen is restored to full, or (if the Neptune currently has full Oxygen) the Neptune gets one extra Tank. The player is limited to six Tanks. In many cases, when the player reaches the screen where Zoom is located, Zoom will immediately attempt to swim off- screen, and the player must catch him before he escapes; if Zoom escapes the player this way, he will not respawn unless the player loses a Tank or reloads the game. Zoom does not appear in the Third Sector of Fossil Trench, nor the Final Sector. In the Final Sector, all enemies and hazards destroy the Neptune in one hit, and there are no checkpoints. ===Differences between campaigns=== While the Neptune travels through the same five zones in each campaign, the level layouts found in Expert Game are quite different from those found in the Voyager Game. In the Expert Game, hazards are placed in more dangerous arrangements, the enemies move in trickier patterns and have new attacks, and some screens feature strong ocean currents which push and pull the Neptune in unexpected and undesirable ways. In the Voyager Game, the Final Sector features four slow but large sea creatures which destroy the Neptune in a single hit; ink pellets are completely ineffective against them. In the Expert Game, the stage is filled with many fast and aggressive sharks; ink pellets only stun these sharks for a fraction of a second, but this can be used to alter their patrol patterns and make screens safer to cross. ==ReferencesCategory:1991 video games Category:Atari ST games Category:DOS games Category:Children's educational video games Category:Life simulation games Category:Mac OS games Category:North America-exclusive video games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Windows games Category:The Learning Company games ","title":"Operation Neptune (video game)"},{"id":"2544271","text":"An oil painting of Lübeck, executed between 1724 and 1734.Apel 1972, 628. Vincent Lübeck (c. September 1654 – 9 February 1740) was a German composer and organist. He was born in Padingbüttel and worked as organist and composer at Stade's St. Cosmae et Damiani (1675–1702) and Hamburg's famous St. Nikolai (1702–1740), where he played one of the largest contemporary organs. He enjoyed a remarkably high reputation in his lifetime, and had numerous pupils, among which were two of his sons. Despite Lübeck's longevity and fame, very few compositions by him survive: a handful of organ praeludia and chorales in the North German style, a few cantatas and several pieces for harpsichord, some of which were published during the composer's lifetime. Of his works, the organ pieces are the most important: influenced by Dieterich Buxtehude and Johann Adam Reincken, Lübeck composed technically and artistically sophisticated works, with frequent virtuosic passages for pedal, five-voice polyphony, and other devices rarely used by most of the composers of the period. ==Life== The tower of St. Cosmae, Stade, where Lübeck worked for 18 years from 1675 to 1702. Lübeck was born in Padingbüttel, a small town situated some 70 km north of Bremen. His father (also named Vincent) worked as organist first at Glückstadt and then, from 1647, at the Marienkirche in Flensburg, where he was succeeded in 1654 by Caspar Förckelrath. Lübeck's father died that year, and Förckelrath married the widow; it follows that he must have been young Lübeck's first teacher.McLean, Grove. According to scholar Wolfram Syré, Lübeck may have also studied under Andreas Kneller, whose influence is palpable in Lübeck's surviving keyboard works.See Syré, 2000. In late 1675 Lübeck became organist of St. Cosmae et Damiani in Stade. The city had been a prominent member of the Hanseatic League, but by 1675 it was being slowly eclipsed by nearby Hamburg. Nevertheless, St. Cosmae had an organ built by the celebrated Arp Schnitger (which still survives, although it has been reconstructed). Upon accepting the post, Lübeck married, as was custom in some parts of North Germany, the daughter of his predecessor, one Susanne Becker. The only dated works by Lübeck are two cantatas composed in Stade in November 1693, both commissioned by the Swedish administration in Stade in memory of Ulrike Eleonora of Denmark. Aside from these pieces, we know very little about the composer's activities at Stade. His reputation as organist, organ consultant and teacher grew steadily, and finally landed him the position at St. Nikolai in Hamburg in 1702; he was succeeded in Stade by his son, Peter Paul (1680–1732). Hamburg was already one of the largest cities in Germany and had a long organ tradition associated first with pupils of Jan Pieterszoon Sweelinck: Heinrich Scheidemann, Jacob Praetorius, and others. A number of other important composers worked in Hamburg in the late 17th century: among them Matthias Weckmann, who helped organize the concert life of the city, and the aforementioned Reincken, one of the most celebrated organists of his time. However, by the time of Lübeck's arrival, only Reincken was still alive, and the musical life of the city, as well as its economic position, was in a slow decline. In 1720 Johann Sebastian Bach applied for a post at the Jacobikirche, but withdrew the application after acquainting himself with the local circumstances. Nevertheless, Lübeck's position in Hamburg was a prominent one. St. Nikolai was one of the city's most important churches, and the organ was not only another Schnitger but also one of the largest organs in the world: a four-manual instrument with 67 stops. Johann Mattheson, writing in 1721, named both the organ and the organist \\"extraordinary\\", alluding to Lübeck's apparently great fame: \\"But how to extol someone who is already greatly renowned? I need only give his name, Vincent Lübeck.\\" Unfortunately, Lübeck's St. Nikolai did not survive into the 20th century: the church was destroyed during the Great Fire of 1842. Example 1. An example of five-voice texture with double pedals from the first section of Prelude and Fugue in G minor (bars 17–18) Lübeck remained organist of St. Nikolai until his death in 1740. One of his sons (also named Vincent, 1684–1755) assisted him from 1735 and succeeded him. During much of his career, Lübeck was a renowned teacher and organ consultant (passing judgements on, among others, Schnitger instruments). But we know little about his teaching activities; his pupils, aside from the two sons, included Michael Johann Friedrich Wiedeburg, a renowned keyboard pedagogue. Although J.S. Bach may have been influenced by Lübeck, they almost certainly never met.Wolff, Grove. Lübeck's works were quickly forgotten with much of the rest of 17th and 18th century organ music. The first modern edition of the composer's work appeared in 1921 in Germany (G. Harms (Klecken, 1921)). A school in Stade was named in his honor, the Vincent Lübeck Gymnasium. ==Music== Only a few pieces by Lübeck survive: five preludes and fugues (one possibly incomplete, and there is also a spurious sixth prelude and fugue), two chorale settings (one incomplete), a single harpsichord suite published in 1728, and five cantatas. Lübeck's organ works, predictably enough, show the influence of Reincken, as well as that of Buxtehude. The preludes and fugues are remarkably varied, and each has a distinct structure: * Prelude and Fugue in C major: Toccata – Fugue 1 – Fugato manualiter – Fugue 2 * Prelude and Fugue in C minor: Toccata – Fugue (possibly incomplete) * Prelude and Fugue in D minor: Toccata – Fugue 1 – Toccata * Prelude and Fugue in E major: Toccata – Fugue 1 – Fugato – Fugue 2 – Toccata * Prelude and Fugue in G minor: Toccata – Fugue 1 – Fugue 2 – Toccata – Fugue 3 Buxtehude's impact is apparent in some of Lübeck's fugue subjects,Apel 1972, 628–9. as well as the five-section structure of the E major work. The free sections often feature virtuosic pedal solos, and the G minor work includes double-pedal passages (see Example 1) of a type which is to be found several times in Reincken's output but which is absent from Buxtehude's. Most of Lübeck's fugues have an obbligato countersubject, commonly introduced during the first statement of the subject: Example 2. Opening bars of the second fugue of Prelude and Fugue in E major. This is the manner in which Lübeck almost always treats countersubjects. The subject is highlighted in blue, the countersubject in orange. The F major and G major preludes and fugues are now attributed to Lübeck's son, whose name also was Vincent. Both have a simple two-section structure (i.e., Toccata and Fugue) and show no trace of the virtuosity apparent in the fully authenticated works. An organ fantasia on Ich ruf zu Dir, Herr Jesu Christ is the only existing complete chorale prelude definitely by Lübeck. At 271 bars, it is one of the largest known examples of the genre. There are twelve clearly defined sections, covering the entire first stanza of the chorale; numerous techniques are employed, including multiple instances of advanced hand-crossing, another feature periodically found in Reincken but not in Buxtehude. Lübeck's variations on Nun lasst uns Gott dem Herren survive incomplete, with only the first six verses set, although these are enough to indicate the composer's skill; his rich variation technique at times almost dispenses with the melody, elaborating only on the harmonic framework of the chorale. Lübeck's Clavier- Übung of 1728 consists of a single harpsichord suite, in which the traditional dances (allemande, courante, sarabande and gigue) are preceded by a prelude and fugue, and a chaconne, which is a simplistic two-voice piece, in which the chorale melody Lobt Gott, ihr Christen allzugleich by Nikolaus Herman is combined with an eight-bar ostinato.Apel 1972, 629. The suite, on the other hand, is much more advanced and exhibits some of the virtuosic qualities found in Lübeck's organ works. Of Lübeck's surviving cantatas, Gott wie dein Nahme, Hilff deinem Volck and Willkommen süsser Bräutigam are the less important ones, probably intended for small, average ensembles. The remaining two works, commissioned by the Swedish administration in Stade, include separate instrumental movements, choruses and ritornello arias; they also feature more advanced writing. ==List of works== ===Organ music=== * Prelude and Fugue in C major * Prelude and Fugue in C minor (possibly incomplete) * Prelude and Fugue in D minor * Prelude and Fugue in E major * Prelude and Fugue in F major (possibly by Lübeck's son, also named Vincent Lübeck) * Prelude and Fugue in G major (possibly by Lübeck's son, also named Vincent Lübeck) * Prelude and Fugue in G minor * Chorale fantasia Ich ruf zu Dir, Herr Jesu Christ * Chorale prelude Nun lasst uns Gott (incomplete, only the first 6 verses survive) ===Harpsichord music=== Title page of Lübeck's Clavier Übung * Clavier Übung bestehend im Praeludio, Fuga, Allemande, Courante, Sarabande und Gigue als auch einer Zugabe von dem Gesang Lobt Gott ihr Christen allzugleich in einer Chaconne (Hamburg, 1728): ** Prelude and Fugue in A minor ** Suite in G minor ** Chaconne on Lobt Gott ihr Christen, in F major * Works from Handschrift S.M.G. 1691, attributed to Lübeck and published in the recent Bärenreiter edition of his works: ** Praeludium (in D major) and Chaconne (in D minor) ** Chaconne in A major ** Suite in A minor ** March and Menuet in F major ===Sacred vocal music=== * Es ist ein grosser Gewinn, wer gottselig ist (4vv, 2 vn, 2 b viol, 2 ob, bn, bc; dated 10–14 November 1693) * Gott wie dein Nahme (3vv (ATB), 3 instruments, bc) * Hilff deinem Volck (4vv, 2 violins, 2 b viol, bc) * Ich hab hier wenig guter Tag (4vv, 2 vn, 2 b viol, 2 ob, bn, bc; dated 10–14 November 1693) * Willkommen süsser Bräutigam (2vv, 2 vn, bc) * 14 more cantatas and a Passion, known from titles and/or texts (all lost) ==Notes== ==References== *Apel, Willi. 1972.

In 1997, the software was re-branded to Microsoft Merchant Server, then Microsoft Site Server, eventually being renamed to Microsoft Commerce Server in 2000. Initially released in 2000, Commerce Server replaced Microsoft Site Server, expanding on the functionality and establishing a focus on e-commerce functionality (rather than concerning itself with document management or content metadata). It helped to create an e-commerce solution or web site with high-performance, familiar tools designed to simplify setup, management, and administration tasks. The last version of the Microsoft- developed product is Microsoft Commerce Server 2009 R2. Microsoft continued to honor extended support of Commerce Server 2009 through 2019. Sitecore now takes responsibility for developing, selling, and supporting the Commerce Server product. The latest release is Sitecore Commerce Server 11, released in 2014. ==History in the UK== Used extensively by a number of middle to large UK retailers, Commerce Server gained considerable traction in the early 2000s.

These features were introduced through the new Commerce Foundation - an abstraction layer that unifies calling patterns of the core systems (see below) and allows for different presentation and business logic to be easily added and represented as 'selling channels'; and SharePoint Commerce Services which includes integration with Microsoft SharePoint - a new default site with 30 new web parts and controls pre-assembled. The default site can be skinned through the new page templating technology, allowing for individual pages to be easily changed by selecting a different template. The product still retains its core systems of Catalog, Inventory, Orders, Profiles, and Marketing. ===Other components=== The server comes bundled with Data Warehouse Analytics, which offer sophisticated reporting functionality, dependent on the availability of Microsoft SQL Server Analytics module, in addition to the Commerce Server Staging (CSS) system. The Staging functionality automates the deployment of both dynamic and active content across a network infrastructure and can accommodate a wide variety of network configurations. (Some have remarked that the speed of CSS deployments is perhaps the most note-worthy aspect of this component.) Commerce Server also comes with BizTalk adaptors, which allow for integration with Microsoft BizTalk for enterprise data manipulation. ==Related technologies== The product requires the presence of Microsoft SQL Server 2005 or later. Commerce Server also can leverage a number of other Microsoft server products, including BizTalk Server 2006, R2, or 2009 and Microsoft Office SharePoint Server (MOSS). .NET Framework 3.5 and Microsoft's Component Object Model (COM) are also required, as the other components used by this product are dependent on these technologies. Recommended deployments are confined to Windows Server 2003 or higher. ==Microsoft release history== * 2000 - Commerce Server 2000 * 2002 - Commerce Server 2002 ** Service Pack 2 (2003) ** Service Pack 3 (2004) * 2004 - Commerce Server 2002 FP1 ** Service Pack 4 (2006) * 2006 - Commerce Server 2007 ** Service Pack 1 (2007) ** Service Pack 2 (2008) * 2009 - Commerce Server 2009 * 2011 - Commerce Server 2009 R2 **2013 - Service Pack 1 ==post-Microsoft Release History== *July 2012 - Ascentium Commerce Server 2009 *July 2012 - Ascentium Commerce Server 2009 R2 *December 2012 - CommerceServer.net Commerce Server 10.0 *May 2013 - CommerceServer.net Commerce Server 10.1 *May 2013 - Ascentium Commerce Server 2009 R2 Service Pack 1 *August 2014 - Sitecore Commerce Server 11.0 *October 2014 - Sitecore Commerce Server 11.1 ==Future development== The Microsoft Commerce Server business was outsourced to Cactus Commerce (Gatineau, Quebec, Canada) in 2007.

Initially he was a wool classer/shearing contractor, shearing team overseer and later owner of his own shearing team. He is characterised by his well-built stature and his shy and reserved demeanour. Jon is a close friend and mentor of fellow Western Australian solo-sailor David Dicks. == Accomplishments == Jon Sanders was the first man to circumnavigate Antarctica solo, circling the continent twice in 1981 – 1982. For this accomplishment, Gate 17 of the new Antarctica Cup Racetrack has been named after him, with sector 17 named after the S&S; 34 monohull Perie Banou, the yacht he had used during the circumnavigation.It is one of 18 gates and sectors within a circular race track bounded to the north by the Roaring Forties and the south by the Screaming Sixties latitudes. Sanders Gate is positioned mid-way round the Indian Ocean zone; the gate is close to where Sanders suffered a 180-degree knockdown. During the voyage, he passed south of the three great capes: Horn, Good Hope and Leeuwin, before rounding Cape Horn a second time. He turned north to Plymouth, UK and returning south around Good Hope and returning to Fremantle. This voyage was recognised in the Guinness Book of Records through the following records: *The first single-handed sailor to remain continuously at sea twice around the world *First single-handed sailor to round the five southernmost Capes twice on one voyage *First single-handed sailor to round the five southernmost Capes twice *Longest distance continuously sailed by any yacht: . *Longest period alone at sea during a continuous voyage: 419 days: 22 hours: 10 minutes In 1986 Sanders set out again from Fremantle, and this time completed three solo non-stop circumnavigations aboard his yacht Parry Endeavour, rounding Saint Peter and Saint Paul Archipelago just north of the Equator each time to ensure that his course covered both hemispheres. Bob Williams, the Chairman of Antarctica Cup Management and the Antarctica Cup Ocean Race, says: \\"What Jon achieved during his double circumnavigation in 1981/82 was truly remarkable, given the technology available at the time and size of his yacht. I have had the greatest respect for Jon ever since watching him set off in a full gale off Plymouth at the start of the Parmelia Race in 1979 and was very pleased to be a contributing sponsor for his next yacht Parry Endeavour in 1986/87. His achievement is an inspiration to all long distance ocean racing sailors and we are very happy to honour Jon now by naming this Gate 17 Sanders Gate and Sector 17 after his yacht Perie Banou\\" On 2 November 2016, Sanders set out from Carnarvon, Western Australia on his tenth circumnavigation, which he completed on 20 December 2017. A live tracker of his progress is available here Parry Endeavour is now in the WA Maritime Museum, in Fremantle, Western Australia. == Other recognitions == Sanders was made an Officer in the Order of the British Empire for sailing in the 1983 New Year's Honours. He was made an Officer of the Order of Australia (AO) in the 1989 Australia Day Honours for \\"service to sailing and to marine science\\". Sanders was inducted into the Single-Handed Sailor's Hall of Fame in Newport, Rhode Island, USA in 1991. Sanders' records include: (From S-HSoF website) * 1970 First solo circumnavigation trip east to west mostly sailing through tropics. * 1981–82 Double nonstop solo circumnavigation west to east via Southern Ocean. * Triple non-stop solo circumnavigation: ** 25 May 1986 left Fremantle headed east. ** 29 January 1987 Rendezvous off Fremantle to mark first circumnavigation. ** 13 March 1988 returned from 657 days 21 hours and 18 minutes at sea, completing three non-stop solo circumnavigations. : Guinness World Records cites this as \\"the longest distance sailed non-stop by any vessel\\". (71,023 nautical miles) A road in Osborne Park, Western Australia bears his name in honour of his sailing accomplishments.

DNIX here made its appearance, based on a UNIX System V license from AT&T.; DIAB was however an industrial automation company, and needed a real-time operating system, so the company replaced the AT&T-supplied; UNIX kernel with their own in-house developed, yet compatible real-time variant. Over time, the company also replaced several of the UNIX standard userspace tools with their own implementations, to the point where no code was derived from UNIX, and their machines could be deployed independently of any AT&T; UNIX license. Two years later and in cooperation with Luxor, a computer called ABC 1200 was developed for the office market, while in parallel, DIAB continue to produce enhanced versions of the DS90 computer using newer versions of the Motorola CPUs such as the Motorola 68010, 68020, 68030 and eventually 68040. In 1990, after DIAB was acquired by Groupe Bull, who continued to produce and support the DS machines under the brand name DIAB, with names such as DIAB 2320, DIAB 2340 etc., still running DIABs version of DNIX.Historien om DIAB - Dataindustrier AB * 1985: ABC 1600 a personal computer running ABCenix * 1985: ABC 9000 really a DS90 in disguise, running DNIX * 1985: beginning of the DS90-line ** DS90-00, DS90-10, DS90-11, Motorola 68010-based UNIX servers intended for use via terminals ** DS90-20, DS90-21, quad Motorola 68020-based computers ** DS90-30, DS90-30S, DS90-31, dual Motorola 68030-based computers ** DS101, actually a DS90-31 with exterior design by pop-artist Richard Hamilton ** DS90-41, DS90-45, DS90-47, Motorola 68040-based computers * the DIAB line; these are actually partly rebranded DSnn-computers: ** DIAB2320, DIAB2340, Motorola 68030-based sequels to the DS90-31 ** DIAB2420, DIAB2440, DIAB2450, Motorola 68040-based sequels to the DS90-47 ** DIAB9030, DIAB9031 – even later computers of unknown construction * OEM products based on DIAB UNIX computers: ** Dynatech Computer Systems (Cromemco) DCS-1/200: based on DS90-30.

It was originally intended for the benefit of the patients and to explain the practical operation of the institution to its patrons. Later, it was used to inform the friends and patrons of the hospital, state newspaper editors, and state legislators of the condition and purposes of the hospital. In 1873 the editors of the American Journal of Insanity noted that the Meteor was only the third paper edited and printed by patients in an insane asylum in the United States. The other two newspapers were The Opal, written and published by the patients of the New York State Lunatic Asylum at Utica and another entitled the Asylum Journal, published by the patients at the Vermont State Hospital in Brattleboro. Although Dr. Bryce boasted of the paper as his institution's \\"remarkable enterprise\\", he did not himself take part in it. The Meteors editor replied to accusations that the true editor of the paper was the superintendent by saying that although \\"as in the United States we have a troop of the craziest sane folks the world ever knew, so also we can boast some of the sanest crazy ones\\", who were responsible for the paper.

The Colonial Cup was Fiji's first attempt at a professional rugby competition, but it did not draw sufficient crowds and ceased after five seasons. ==History== In 2004, with the gap between provincial rugby in Fiji and test rugby at an unacceptable level, the Fiji Rugby Union introduced a brand new, streamlined competition to identify and prepare local players for the international stage. The 30-odd provincial unions were grouped into four franchises along geographical lines. Players not selected for one team could be picked up by one of the others. Players were paid £40 a week plus lodgings. The new competition started on the 3rd of April 2004 and finished the 22nd of May 2004 in time for the international test window. The four teams played a round-robin followed by semi-finals and a grand final. The Coastal Stallions held off a late rally from the Suva Highlanders to claim the inaugural Colonial Cup 26-21 In 2005 an extra team was added, Northern Sharks, made of players from Vanua Levu, Taveuni and Ovalau. Previously the Northern Division had belonged to the Suva franchise. Suva Highlanders won the Grand final with a 35-27 win over Western Crusaders. In 2006, with the introduction of a Super 14 style tournament called the Pacific Rugby Cup, the void in the Pacific Island competition pathway between club or provincial rugby in the respective islands and Test rugby was on its way to being filled. Coastal Stallions defeated Suva Highlanders 29-15 in a tough encounter to clinch the 2006 title. Bligh Roosters joined the 2007 competition, Western Crusaders gave up Tavua, Vatukoula, Ba and Ra to the new franchise. It was announced in 2008 that the competition would cease due to not achieving its player performance aims and low crowds. ==Structure== Fiji’s best 150 players are divided up into 6 professionally run franchises. These franchises play each other over 10 weeks culminating in a semi-final and final. The league uses 4 points for a win; 2 for a draw; 1 bonus point for scoring four or more tries in a match; 1 bonus point for losing by 7 points or less.

Coloured Petri nets preserve useful properties of Petri nets and at the same time extend the initial formalism to allow the distinction between tokens. Coloured Petri nets allow tokens to have a data value attached to them. This attached data value is called the token color. Although the color can be of arbitrarily complex type, places in coloured Petri nets usually contain tokens of one type. This type is called the color set of the place. Definition 1. A net is a tuple N = (P, T, A, Σ, C, N, E, G, I ) where: * P is a set of places. * T is a set of transitions. * A is a set of arcs In coloured Petri nets, sets of places, transitions and arcs are pairwise disjoint P ∩ T = P ∩ A = T ∩ A = ∅ * Σ is a set of color sets. This set contains all possible colors, operations and functions used within the coloured Petri net. * C is a color function. It maps places in P into colors in Σ. * N is a node function. It maps A into (P × T) ∪ (T × P). * E is an arc expression function. It maps each arc a ∈ A into the expression e. The input and output types of the arc expressions must correspond to the type of the nodes the arc is connected to. Use of node function and arc expression function allows multiple arcs connect the same pair of nodes with different arc expressions. * G is a guard function. It maps each transition t ∈ T to a guard expression g. The output of the guard expression should evaluate to Boolean value: true or false. * I is an initialization function.

Larry Ivie - who also was cover artist for several early issues - and Ken Beale edited the first three issues. Writer-artist Bhob Stewart edited the magazine from 1963 into the early 1970s. Although promoted and sold as a \\"monster magazine,\\" readers were aware that Castle of Frankenstein, at the time, was the only nationally distributed magazine devoted to a legitimate and serious coverage of B movies. In addition to its central focus on classic and current horror films, Castle of Frankenstein also devoted pages to amateur filmmakers and fanzines. Its advertising pages sold full-length silent feature films such as The Lost World and The Golem: How He Came into the World. Following employment as an editor for publisher Joe Weider, Calvin Beck (1929–1989) entered the monster magazine arena in 1959 with his one-shot issue Journal of Frankenstein, which had only a small circulation. As an experiment, Beck printed part of the run on slick paper. After a hiatus and a title change, Beck returned with the debut issue of Castle of Frankenstein in 1962. Beck claimed that since his magazine carried no outside advertising, a standardized schedule was unneeded. Issues were published whenever they were completed, leading to an erratic, irregular schedule. Distribution also varied; while many well-stocked periodical outlets did not carry the magazine, some less- likely outlets (such as grocery stores) did. The magazine ran 25 issues, plus one annual (the 1967 Fearbook); the final issue was published in 1975. Beck cancelled his magazine not because of poor sales, but to devote his energy to writing books. During its primary run, Castle of Frankenstein outlasted the majority of monster magazines that filled the market for two decades, with the notable exception of Famous Monsters of Filmland. In 1999, publisher Dennis Druktenis revived both Castle of Frankenstein (releasing 10 more issues) and the original title Journal of Frankenstein (releasing five more issues). ==Contributors== In addition to book reviews by Charles Collins and Lin Carter, contributors included Barry Brown, Richard A. Lupoff and William K. Everson. Inspired by the ratings and reviews of films in Cahiers du Cinéma, Stewart introduced a similar system with the \\"Comic Book Council\\", the first critical coverage of comic books to appear in a national magazine. Commentary and ratings of underground comics were juxtaposed with reviews of mainstream comics. Another key feature was the \\"Frankenstein Movieguide\\", an attempt to document all fantastic films seen on television with \\"mini-reviews\\" written by Joe Dante and Stewart. Unlike some genre commentators, these reviewers were not limited only to monster-style films. Instead, the many brief, tightly- written fantasy film reviews also covered experimental and foreign art films. The capsule review format enforced a brevity and economy that inspired many younger writers. With new art and reprints of vintage fantasy art, the magazine published such artists as Aubrey Beardsley, Hannes Bok, Harry Clarke, Virgil Finlay, Jim Steranko, Wally Wood and Weird Tales illustrator Matt Fox. To cut costs, color photos rather than paintings were used on the covers of issues six through 14. With issue 11's cover photo of Leonard Nimoy, Castle of Frankenstein was the first magazine to feature Star Trek as a major cover story. Other issues displayed cover paintings by Robert Adragna, Marcus Boas, Bok, Frank Brunner, Maelo Cintron, Larry Ivie, Russ Jones, Ken Kelly, Los Angeles painter Tom Maher and Lee Wanagiel. Interior art included graphic stories by Ivie, Brunner, Bernie Wrightson and the team of Marv Wolfman and Len Wein, plus the first published comics page by Marvel artist-writer-editor Larry Hama. Castle of Frankenstein also carried an unusual original comic strip, Baron von Bungle by Richard Bojarski, which gave a humorous twist to the world depicted in Universal horror films. ==Books== Calvin Beck edited this anthology for Ballantine Books in 1962. Beck, with an editorial assist by fantasy fiction scholar Haywood P. Norton, assembled the paperback anthology, The Frankenstein Reader (Ballantine Books, 1962). The two brought together a roster of vintage horror-fantasy tales by E. F. Benson, Ambrose Bierce, Robert W. Chambers, Ralph Adams Cram, Charles Dickens, Amelia B. Edwards, Katharine Fullerton Gerould, Richard Middleton, Sir Arthur Quiller-Couch, Robert Louis Stevenson and H. G. Wells. In Heroes of the Horrors (Macmillan, 1975), Beck wrote illustrated biographies of six leading horror film stars (Lon Chaney, Sr., Lon Chaney, Jr., Boris Karloff, Peter Lorre, Bela Lugosi, Vincent Price) and writers such as Robert Bloch and Richard Matheson. The book reworked information previously unearthed for Castle of Frankenstein articles. Bhob Stewart and Beck then collaborated on a companion volume, Scream Queens: Heroines of the Horrors (Macmillan, 1978), illustrated biographical profiles of 29 fantasy film actresses and directors. The book included an article by actor Barry Brown, plus research by Drew Simels, author of the TV movie entries in early editions of Leonard Maltin's Movie Guide series. With articles on Alice Guy-Blaché, Joan Crawford, Bette Davis, Veronica Lake, Elsa Lanchester, Agnes Moorehead, Mary Philbin, Barbara Steele, Vampira, Fay Wray and others, Scream Queens also incorporated material from the Castle of Frankenstein files of manuscripts and still photographs. Beck's fourth book, Sense of Wonder, about fantasy films of the 1940s, was never published. ==See also== * Science fiction magazine * Fantasy fiction magazine * Horror fiction magazine ==References== ==External links== * Castle of Frankenstein history and cover gallery * Gallery of CoF covers * Profile of Calvin Beck and his alleged connection to Robert Bloch's Psycho * Archived Castle of Frankenstein magazines on the Internet Archive Category:Film magazines published in the United States Category:Speculative fiction magazines published in the United States Category:Defunct science fiction magazines published in the United States Category:Magazines established in 1962 Category:Magazines disestablished in 1975 Category:Magazines published in New Jersey ","title":"Castle of Frankenstein"},{"id":"2544439","text":"Coherent control is a quantum mechanics-based method for controlling dynamical processes by light. The basic principle is to control quantum interference phenomena, typically by shaping the phase of laser pulses. The basic ideas have proliferated, finding vast application in spectroscopy mass spectra, quantum information processing, laser cooling, ultracold physics and more. ==Brief History== The initial idea was to control the outcome of chemical reactions. Two approaches were pursued: * in the time domain, a \\"pump-dump\\" scheme where the control is the time delay between pulses * in the frequency domain, interfering pathways controlled by one and three photons. The two basic methods eventually merged with the introduction of optimal control theory. Experimental realizations soon followed in the time domain and in the frequency domain. Two interlinked developments accelerated the field of coherent control: experimentally, it was the development of pulse shaping by a spatial light modulator Liquid Crystal Optically Addressed Spatial Light Modulator, *Slinger, C.; Cameron, C.; Stanley, M.; \\"Computer-Generated Holography as a Generic Display Technology\\" , IEEE Computer, Volume 38, Issue 8, Aug. 2005, pp 46–53 and its employment in coherent control. The second development was the idea of automatic feedback control and its experimental realization. ==Controllability== Coherent control aims to steer a quantum system from an initial state to a target state via an external field. For given initial and final (target) states, the coherent control is termed state- to-state control. A generalization is steering simultaneously an arbitrary set of initial pure states to an arbitrary set of final states i.e. controlling a unitary transformation. Such an application sets the foundation for a quantum gate operation. Controllability of a closed quantum system has been addressed by Tarn and Clark. Their theorem based in control theory states that for a finite-dimensional, closed-quantum system, the system is completely controllable, i.e. an arbitrary unitary transformation of the system can be realized by an appropriate application of the controls if the control operators and the unperturbed Hamiltonian generate the Lie algebra of all Hermitian operators. Complete controllability implies state-to-state controllability. The computational task of finding a control field for a particular state-to-state transformation is difficult and becomes more difficult with the increase in the size of the system. This task is in the class of hard inversion problems of high computational complexity. The algorithmic task of finding the field that generates a unitary transformation scales factorial more difficult with the size of the system. This is because a larger number of state-to-state control fields have to be found without interfering with the other control fields. Once constraints are imposed controllability can be degraded. For example, what is the minimum time required to achieve a control objective? This is termed the \\"quantum speed limit\\". ==Constructive approach to coherent control== The constructive approach uses a set of predetermined control fields for which the control outcome can be inferred. The pump dump scheme in the time domain and the three vs one photon interference scheme in the frequency domain are prime examples. Another constructive approach is based on adiabatic ideas. The most well studied method is Stimulated raman adiabatic passage STIRAP which employs an auxiliary state to achieve complete state-to-state population transfer. One of the most prolific generic pulse shapes is a chirped pulse a pulse with a varying frequency in time. ==Optimal control== Optimal control as applied in coherent control seeks the optimal control field for steering a quantum system to its objective. For state-to-state control the objective is defined as the maximum overlap at the final time T with the state \\\\phi_f \\\\rangle : :J= \\\\langle\\\\psi (T) \\\\phi_f\\\\rangle^2 where the initial state is  \\\\phi_i\\\\rangle. The time dependent control Hamiltonian has the typical form: : H(t) = H_0 + \\\\mu \\\\cdot \\\\epsilon(t) where \\\\epsilon (t) is the control field. Optimal control solves for the optimal field \\\\epsilon(t)using the calculus of variations introducing Lagrange multipliers. A new objective functional is defined : J' = J + \\\\int_0^{T} \\\\langle \\\\chi (t)\\\\left( i \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial t}-H(\\\\epsilon(t))\\\\right)\\\\psi(t) \\\\rangle dt +\\\\lambda \\\\int_o^T \\\\epsilon(t)^2 dt where \\\\chi\\\\rangle is a wave function like Lagrange multiplier and the \\\\lambda parameter regulates the integral intensity. Variation of J' with respect to \\\\delta \\\\epsilon and \\\\delta \\\\psi leads to two coupled Schrödinger equations. A forward equation for \\\\psi\\\\rangle with initial condition \\\\psi(0)\\\\rangle=\\\\phi_i\\\\rangleand a backward equation for the Lagrange multiplier \\\\chi\\\\rangle with final condition \\\\chi(T)\\\\rangle=\\\\phi_f\\\\rangle. Finding a solution requires an iterative approach. Different algorithms have been applied for obtaining the control field such as the Krotov method. A local in time alternative method has been developed, where at each time step, the field is calculated to direct the state to the target. A related method has been called tracking ==Experimental applications== Some applications of coherent control are * Unimolecular and bimolecular chemical reactions. * The biological photoisomerization of Retinal. * The field of nuclear magnetic resonance. * The field of ultracold matter for photoassociation. * Laser cooling of internal degrees of freedom. * Quantum information processing.Larsen, T. W., K. D. Petersson, F. Kuemmeth, T. S. Jespersen, P. Krogstrup, and C. M. Marcus. \\"Coherent control of a transmon qubit with a nanowire-based Josephson junction.\\" Bulletin of the American Physical Society 60 (2015). * Attosecond physics. Another important issue is the spectral selectivity of two photon coherent control. These concepts can be applied to single pulse Raman spectroscopy and microscopy. As one of the cornerstones for enabling quantum technologies, optimal quantum control keeps evolving and expanding into areas as diverse as quantum-enhanced sensing, manipulation of single spins, photons, or atoms, optical spectroscopy, photochemistry, magnetic resonance (spectroscopy as well as medical imaging), quantum information processing, and quantum simulation. ==References== ==Further reading== *Principles of the Quantum Control of Molecular Processes, by Moshe Shapiro, Paul Brumer, pp. 250\\\\. .

M. Robinson in 1950. It is usually denoted Q. Q is almost PA without the axiom schema of mathematical induction. Q is weaker than PA but it has the same language, and both theories are incomplete. Q is important and interesting because it is a finitely axiomatized fragment of PA that is recursively incompletable and essentially undecidable. ==Axioms== The background logic of Q is first-order logic with identity, denoted by infix '='. The individuals, called natural numbers, are members of a set called N with a distinguished member 0, called zero. There are three operations over N: *A unary operation called successor and denoted by prefix S; *Two binary operations, addition and multiplication, denoted by infix + and by concatenation, respectively. The following axioms for Q are Q1–Q7 in Burgess (2005: 42) (cf. also the axioms of first-order arithmetic). Variables not bound by an existential quantifier are bound by an implicit universal quantifier. # Sx ≠ 0 #*0 is not the successor of any number. # (Sx = Sy) → x = y #* If the successor of x is identical to the successor of y, then x and y are identical. (1) and (2) yield the minimum of facts about N (it is an infinite set bounded by 0) and S (it is an injective function whose domain is N) needed for non-triviality. The converse of (2) follows from the properties of identity. # y=0 ∨ ∃x (Sx = y) #* Every number is either 0 or the successor of some number. The axiom schema of mathematical induction present in arithmetics stronger than Q turns this axiom into a theorem. # x + 0 = x # x + Sy = S(x + y) #* (4) and (5) are the recursive definition of addition. # x·0 = 0 # x·Sy = (x·y) + x #* (6) and (7) are the recursive definition of multiplication. ===Variant axiomatizations=== The axioms in Robinson (1950) are (1)–(13) in Mendelson (1997: 201). The first 6 of Robinson's 13 axioms are required only when, unlike here, the background logic does not include identity. The usual strict total order on N, \\"less than\\" (denoted by \\"<\\"), can be defined in terms of addition via the rule . Equivalently, we get a definitional conservative extension of Q by taking \\"<\\" as primitive and adding this rule as an eighth axiom; this system is termed \\"Robinson arithmetic R\\" in Boolos et al. (2002: Sec 16.4). A different extension of Q, which we temporarily call Q+, is obtained if we take \\"<\\" as primitive and add (instead of the last definitional axiom) the following three axioms to axioms (1)–(7) of Q: * ¬(x < 0) * x < Sy ↔ (x < y ∨ x = y) * x < y ∨ x = y ∨ y < x Q+ is still a conservative extension of Q, in the sense that any formula provable in Q+ not containing the symbol \\"<\\" is already provable in Q. (Adding only the first two of the above three axioms to Q gives a conservative extension of Q that is equivalent to what Burgess 2005:56 calls Q*. See also Burgess 2005:230 fn. 24, but note that the second of the above three axioms cannot be deduced from \\"the pure definitional extension\\" of Q obtained by adding only the axiom .) Among the axioms (1)–(7) of Q, axiom (3) needs an inner existential quantifier. Shoenfield (1967:22) gives an axiomatization that has only (implicit) outer universal quantifiers, by dispensing with axiom (3) of Q but adding the above three axioms with < as primitive. That is, Shoenfield's system is Q+ minus axiom (3), and is strictly weaker than Q+, since axiom (3) is independent of the other axioms (for example, the ordinals less than \\\\omega^\\\\omega forms a model for all axioms except (3) when Sv is interpreted as v + 1). Shoenfield's system also appears in Boolos et al. (2002: Sec 16.2), where it is called the \\"minimal arithmetic\\" (also denoted by Q). A closely related axiomatization, that uses \\"≤\\" instead of \\"<\\", may be found in Machover (1996:256–57). ==Metamathematics== On the metamathematics of Q, see Boolos et al. (2002: chpt. 16), Tarski, Mostowski, and Robinson (1953), Smullyan (1991), Mendelson (1997: 201-03), and Burgess (2005: §§1.5a, 2.2). The intended interpretation of Q is the natural numbers and their usual arithmetic in which addition and multiplication have their customary meaning, identity is equality, and 0 is the natural number zero. Any model (structure) that satisfies all axioms of Q except possibly axiom (3) has a unique submodel (\\"the standard part\\") isomorphic to the standard natural numbers . (Axiom (3) need not be satisfied; for example the polynomials with non-negative integer coefficients forms a model that satisfies all axioms except (3).) Q, like Peano arithmetic, has nonstandard models of all infinite cardinalities. However, unlike Peano arithmetic, Tennenbaum's theorem does not apply to Q, and it has computable non-standard models. For instance, there is a computable model of Q consisting of integer-coefficient polynomials with positive leading coefficient, plus the zero polynomial, with their usual arithmetic. A notable characteristic of Q is the absence of the axiom scheme of induction. Hence it is often possible to prove in Q every specific instance of a fact about the natural numbers, but not the associated general theorem. For example, 5 + 7 = 7 + 5 is provable in Q, but the general statement x + y = y + x is not. Similarly, one cannot prove that Sx ≠ x (Burgess 2005:56). A model of Q that fails many of the standard facts is obtained by adjoining two distinct new elements a and b to the standard model of natural numbers and defining Sa = a, Sb = b, x + a = b and x + b = a for all x, a + n = a and b + n = b if n is a standard natural number, x·0 = 0 for all x, a·n = b and b·n = a if n is a non- zero standard natural number, x·a = a for all x except x = a, x·b = b for all x except x = b, a·a = b, and b·b = a (Boolos et al, 2002 Sec 16.4). Q is interpretable in a fragment of Zermelo's axiomatic set theory, consisting of extensionality, existence of the empty set, and the axiom of adjunction. This theory is S' in Tarski et al. (1953: 34) and ST in Burgess (2005: 90-91; 223). See general set theory for more details. Q is fascinating because it is a finitely axiomatized first-order theory that is considerably weaker than Peano arithmetic (PA), and whose axioms contain only one existential quantifier, yet like PA is incomplete and incompletable in the sense of Gödel's incompleteness theorems, and essentially undecidable. Robinson (1950) derived the Q axioms (1)–(7) above by noting just what PA axioms are required to prove (Mendelson 1997: Th. 3.24) that every computable function is representable in PA. The only use this proof makes of the PA axiom schema of induction is to prove a statement that is axiom (3) above, and so, all computable functions are representable in Q (Mendelson 1997: Th. 3.33, Rautenberg 2010: 246). The conclusion of Gödel's second incompleteness theorem also holds for Q: no consistent recursively axiomatized extension of Q can prove its own consistency, even if we additionally restrict Gödel numbers of proofs to a definable cut (Bezboruah and Shepherdson 1976; Pudlák 1985; Hájek & Pudlák 1993:387). The first incompleteness theorem applies only to axiomatic systems defining sufficient arithmetic to carry out the necessary coding constructions (of which Gödel numbering forms a part). The axioms of Q were chosen specifically to ensure they are strong enough for this purpose. Thus the usual proof of the first incompleteness theorem can be used to show that Q is incomplete and undecidable. This indicates that the incompleteness and undecidability of PA cannot be blamed on the only aspect of PA differentiating it from Q, namely the axiom schema of induction. Gödel's theorems do not hold when any one of the seven axioms above is dropped. These fragments of Q remain undecidable, but they are no longer essentially undecidable: they have consistent decidable extensions, as well as uninteresting models (i.e., models which are not end-extensions of the standard natural numbers). ==See also== * Gentzen's consistency proof * Gödel's incompleteness theorem * List of first- order theories * Peano axioms * Presburger arithmetic * Skolem arithmetic * Second-order arithmetic * Set-theoretic definition of natural numbers * General set theory ==References== *A.

It is a detailed fictional exploration of the effects of the Malayan Emergency and of Britain's final withdrawal from its Southeast Asian territories. The American title, decided on by Burgess himself, is taken from Alfred, Lord Tennyson's poem Ulysses: 'The lights begin to twinkle from the rocks:  The long day wanes: the slow moon climbs: the deep  Moans round with many voices. Come, my friends,  'Tis not too late to seek a newer world.' (ll. 55-57) The three volumes are: * Time for a Tiger (1956) * The Enemy in the Blanket (1958) * Beds in the East (1959) The trilogy tracks the fortunes of the history teacher Victor Crabbe, his professional difficulties, his marriage problems, and his attempt to do his duty in the war against the insurgents. ==Time for a Tiger== Time for a Tiger, the first part of the trilogy, is dedicated, in Jawi script on the first page of the book, \\"to all my Malayan friends\\" (\\"Kepada sahabat-sahabat saya di Tanah Melayu\\"). It was Burgess's first published work of fiction and appeared in 1956. The title alludes to an advertising slogan for Tiger beer, then, as now, popular in the Malay peninsula. The action centres on the vicissitudes of Victor Crabbe, a history teacher at an elite school for all the peninsula's ethnic groups – Malay, Chinese and Indian the Mansor School, in Kuala Hantu (modelled on the Malay College at Kuala Kangsar, Perak and Raffles Institution, Singapore). Malay College Kuala Kangsar, on which Mansor School is based. Victor Crabbe, a resident teacher at the Mansor School, seeks to tackle the threat posed by a boy Communist who appears to be conducting clandestine night-time indoctrination sessions with fellow students. But the headmaster, Boothby, scoffs at Crabbe's warnings. Nabby Adams, an alcoholic police lieutenant who prefers warm beer (\\"he could not abide it cold\\"), persuades Crabbe to buy a car, enabling Adams to make a commission as a middleman. This is despite the fact that Crabbe will not drive because of a traumatic car accident in which his first wife died and he was the driver. Crabbe's marriage to the blonde Fenella is crumbling, while he carries on an affair with a Malay divorcee employed at a nightclub. A junior police officer who works for Adams, Alladad Khan, (who has a secret crush on Fenella) moonlights as a driver for the couple. Ibrahim bin Mohamed Salleh, a (married) gay cook, works for the couple but is being pursued by the wife he has fled from after being forced to marry her by his family. The threads of the plot come together when Alladad Khan drives Crabbe, Fenella and Adams to a nearby village, along a route where they face possible ambush by Chinese terrorists. Due to unforeseen circumstances, they return late to the school's speech day and an unexpected chain of events follows that transforms the lives of all the main characters. ==The Enemy in the Blanket== The title is a literal translation of the Malay idiom \\"musuh dalam selimut\\", which means to be betrayed by an intimate (somewhat similar but not quite the same as the English \\"sleeping with the enemy\\"), alluding to the struggles of marriage but also other betrayals in the story. The novel charts the continuing adventures of Victor Crabbe, who becomes headmaster of a school in the imaginary sultanate of Dahaga (meaning thirst in Malay and identifiable with Kelantan) in the years and months leading up to Malayan independence. Crabbe is made headmaster of a school in Dahaga, in the east coast of Malaya (in an introduction to the trilogy, he identifies the sultanate as Kota Baharu in Kelantan). Burgess was dismayed by the design of the cover of the 1958 Heinemann edition of the novel, presumably designed in London. It shows a Sikh working as a ricksha-puller, something unheard of in Malaya or anywhere else. He wrote in his autobiography (Little Wilson and Big God, p. 416): \\"The design on [the] dust-jacket showed a Sikh pulling a white man and woman in a jinrickshaw. I, who had always looked up to publishers, was discovering that they could be as inept as authors. The reviewers would blame me, not the cover-designer, for that blatant display of ignorance.\\" ==Beds in the East== The title is taken from a line spoken by Mark Antony in Antony and Cleopatra II.vi.49–52: 'The beds i' the east are soft; and thanks to you,/That call'd me timelier than my purpose hither;/For I have gain'd by 't.' ==Characters== * Victor Crabbe, initially a resident teacher at the Mansor School, seeks to tackle the threat posed by a boy Communist who appears to be conducting clandestine night-time indoctrination sessions with fellow students. But the headmaster, Boothby, scoffs at Crabbe's warnings. Later, a headmaster. * Fenella, Crabbe's wife * Nabby Adams, an alcoholic police lieutenant who prefers warm beer (\\"he could not abide it cold\\"), persuades Crabbe to buy a car, enabling Adams to make a commission as a middleman. This is despite the fact that Crabbe will not drive because of a traumatic car accident in which his first wife died and he was the driver. * Abdul Kadir, Crabbe's hard-drinking and foul-mouthed teaching colleague at the school, whose every sentence includes the words \\"For fuck's sake!\\" * The hard- up lawyer Rupert Hardman, who converts to Islam in order to wed a domineering Muslim woman, 'Che Normah, for her money. He later bitterly regrets it and tries to return to the West in order to escape the marriage. * Talbot, the State Education Officer, a fat-buttocked gourmand whom Victor Crabbe cuckolds, and who cuckolded Crabbe years earlier himself * Anne Talbot, Talbot's wife, a wanton adulteress * The womanising Abang of Dahaga, who is also a devotee of chess and who aims both to seduce Crabbe's wife and to purloin his car * Father Laforgue, a priest who has spent most of his life in China and longs to return there but is prevented from doing so, having been banished by the Communist regime that came to power in Peking a decade earlier * Robert Loo, a brilliant boy composer whose musical career Crabbe seeks to further * Ah Wing, Crabbe's elderly Chinese cook who, it emerges, has been supplying the insurgents with provisions * Jaganathan, a fellow teacher who plots to supplant and ruin Crabbe * Mohinder Singh, a shopkeeper trying desperately, and failing, to compete with Chinese traders * Rosemary Michael, an 'eminently nubile' Tamil with 'quite considerable capacity for all kinds of sensuous pleasure' * Tommy Jones, a beer salesman. 'That's my line. I sell beer all over the East. Thirty years on the job. Three thousand a month and a car allowance and welcome wherever I go.' * Lim Cheng Po, an Anglophile lawyer * Liversedge, an Australian judge who harbours a secret resentment against the English * Moneypenny, an anthropologist studying the hill tribes and living in the Malayan jungle. He has lost touch with civilisation to the extent that he believes it is lethal to laugh at butterflies and \\"now regarded even a lavatory as supererogatory\\". ==Bibliography== ===Editions=== Initially published by Heinemann in discrete volumes, all known editions have since included all three novels in one volume.

Also according to the SKL: he was the successor of Išme-Dagān. Ur-Ninurta then succeeded Lipit-Ištar. Some documents and royal inscriptions from his time have survived, however; Lipit- Ištar is mostly known due to the Sumerian language hymns that were written in his honor, as well as a legal code written in his name (preceding the famed Code of Hammurabi by about 100 years)—which were used for school instruction for hundreds of years after Lipit-Ištar's death. The annals of Lipit-Ištar's reign recorded that he also repulsed the Amorites.Ferris J.

The text exists on several partial fragments. The following complete laws have been reconstructed: :§8 If a man gave bare ground to another man to set out as an orchard and the latter did not complete setting out that bare ground as an orchard, he shall give to the man who set out the orchard the bare ground which he neglected as part of his share. :§9 If a man entered the orchard of another man and was seized there for stealing, he shall pay ten shekels of silver. :§10 If a man cut down a tree in the garden of another man, he shall pay one-half mina of silver. :§11 If adjacent to the house of a man the bare ground of another man has been neglected and the owner of the house has said to the owner of the bare ground, \\"Because your ground has been neglected someone may break into my house: strengthen your house,\\" and this agreement has been confirmed by him, the owner of the bare ground shall restore to the owner of the house any of his property that is lost. :§12 If a slave-girl or slave of a man has fled into the heart of the city and it has been confirmed that he (or she) dwelt in the house of (another) man for one month, he shall give slave for slave. :§13 If he has no slave, he shall pay fifteen shekels of silver. :§14 If a man's slave has compensated his slave-ship to his master and it is confirmed (that he has compensated) his master two-fold, that slave shall be freed. :§15 If a miqtum [servant] is the grant of a king, he shall not be taken away. :§16 If a miqtum went to a man of his own free will, that man shall not hold him; he (the miqtum) may go where he desires. :§17 If a man without authorization bound another man to a matter of which he (the latter) had no knowledge, that man is not affirmed (i.e., legally obligated); he (the first man) shall bear the penalty in regard to the matter to which he had bound him. :§18 If the master of an estate or the mistress of an estate has defaulted on the tax of an estate and a stranger has borne it, for three years he (the owner) may not be evicted.

His first published brochures called for Emancipation of the Jews. Unlike some other contemporary writers on that subject, he vehemently held that granting equal right to Jews was not a special favor, but their natural right as human beings. In later writings he called for reform of the medical services in Prussia, attacked the judicial system which he considered oppressive as well as the state censorship, and upheld \\"The Right of the Prussian People for a Constitution\\". These writings got him prosecuted on charges of Lèse majesté, but he was eventually acquitted. His reputation as a man of fearless honesty was greatly enhanced during the revolutionary upheaval of 1848–1849. He was a delegate in both the Prussian National assembly and the All-German Frankfurt Parliament, and was reckoned among the conspicuous leaders of the Left in both of them. A particular event connected with his name was when King Frederick William IV of Prussia refused to listen to the criticism made by deputies of the Prussian National assembly during an audience in 1848. Jacoby, one of the deputies (some accounts described him as leader of the delegation) had the courage to say to the King: It is the misfortune of Kings that they will not listen to the truth!, a saying which got widely published and soon made him very popular in the public. After the Frankfurt Parliament was dissolved and its members driven out of Frankfurt, Jacoby was among the most radical members, who fled to Stuttgart and there set up a rump parliament with the aim of proclaiming a German republic – considered at the time a highly revolutionary idea. After this body was dissolved by the Württemberg military, Jacoby was prosecuted again for his membership in it, but was acquitted. Later, Jacoby distinguished himself as an outspoken opponent of Otto von Bismarck. As a member of the Prussian Legislature he was in the radical left of the German Progress Party. In 1864 he delivered, in the presence of the King, a strong anti-Bismarck speech calling for tax refusal. For that, he was prosecuted and served six months behind bars. Unlike other German Liberals, whose attitudes towards the \\"Iron Chancellor\\" were mollified after Bismarck's success in achieving the Unification of Germany, Jacoby remained steadfast in opposing Bismarck's warlike policies and was especially conspicuous in protesting against the annexation of Alsace-Lorraine, for which he was again imprisoned. After the creation of new German Second Reich he joined the German Social Democratic Party. In 1874, three years before his death, he was elected on its behalf to the Reichstag but demonstratively refused to take his seat as an act of political protest. Jacoby was also involved in internal Jewish affairs. Among other things, in 1838 he had been a member of a commission appointed by the Königsberg Jewish Community to look into reforms in public worship at the synagogue. However, his reputation is mainly as a Prussian and German political activist dealing with general German political and social issues. He died in Königsberg. == Jacoby on Direct Democracy == Jacoby's contributions to direct democracy are not well documented but several sources can be found. In general he had a positive view on direct democracy e.g. in his speeches (Gesammelten Reden und Schriften von 1872): * According to his view, final decisions must be made by the whole sovereign/population (Bd. 2, S. 25) * Citizens have a right to participate decisively in every aspect of lawmaking (Bd. 2, S. 56) * He wanted: selfgovernment, participation on all public affairs, generall and direct participation in lawmaking and government by the people (May, 28th 1868, Bd. 2, Sl 336–339) * Citizens are sovereign if the law and administration depends on the direct approval and decision (June, 17th 1868, Bd. 2, S. 340–342) * Self-government is not the discussion on each phrase of a law and its formulation but the right to adopt or repeal or revise a law!

This can be achieved in at least two ways. * An active circuit, using a device such as a transistor or operational amplifier * A passive circuit, using autotransformers. These are typically used for calibration standards. The General Radio / IET labs 1417 is one such example. Capacitor multipliers make low-frequency filter and long-duration timing circuits possible that would be impractical with actual capacitors. Another application is in DC power supplies where very low ripple voltage (under load) is of paramount importance, such as in class-A amplifiers. == Transistor based == A basic capacitance multiplier. Here the capacitance of capacitor C1 is multiplied by approximately the transistor's current gain (β). Without Q, R2 would be the load on the capacitor. With Q in place, the loading imposed upon C1 is simply the load current reduced by a factor of (β + 1). Consequently, C1 appears multiplied by a factor of (β + 1) when viewed by the load. Another way is to look at this circuit as emitter follower with capacitor C1 holding voltage at base constant with load of input impedance of Q1: R2 multiplied by (1 + β), so the output current is stabilized much more against power line voltage noise. == Operational amplifier based == A basic capacitance multiplier. Here, the capacitance of capacitor C1 is multiplied by the ratio of resistances C = C1 * ( 1+ (R1 / R2)), if looking into the Vi node. The synthesized capacitance also brings with it a series resistance approximately equal to R2. A negative capacitance multiplier can be created with a negative impedance converter. == Autotransformer based == These permit the synthesis of accurate values of large capacitance (e.g. 1 F), by multiplying the capacitance of a high-precision lower value capacitor by the use of two transformers.

It was released by Roadrunner Records on June 9, 1992. ==Background== Legion is one of Deicide's most musically ambitious releases, incorporating more technical riffing and song structures. The band considers this album to be its most difficult, and claims it is too chaotic. When the Hoffman brothers quit the band, Eric Hoffman stated that one of the main reasons was Glen Benton refusing to play longer sets and being unable to perform the technical bass guitar riffing required for Legion's material. Though the album is a favourite of fans, \\"Dead But Dreaming\\" is the only song from it to remain in the band's live set (though as recently as 2010 the band has begun playing \\"Trifixion\\" and \\"Holy Deception\\" as well). Unlike Deicide's first album, no pitch shifters or harmonizers were used on Benton's vocals. However, delay, reverb, and multi-tracking were among the studio manipulations used to achieve the vocal effects on the album. The first track, \\"Satan Spawn, the Caco-Daemon\\", features a backward message. At about twenty seconds, a voice can be heard repeating the song's title. Steve Asheim said of Legion, \\"For Legion, I was too busy worrying about how we were going to get a second album out to really think about what it meant, I was just trying to stay in the music business and stay brutal.\\" == Reviews == A reviewer for The Metal Storm said, \\"in general a good album, some songs are well executed and with complex musical writing, but there are others that are just very simple and repetitive\\".Deicide - Legion Review - Metal Storm Vincent Jeffries of Allmusic stated, \\"Legion stands out as a musically complex but familiar offering from the band. Live favorite 'Trifixion' is indeed one of the better cuts from the release, but it's easier to consider this disc (and most records like it) as a whole. Deicide's compositions and performances are solid and serious throughout\\".

It was also Starr's first release of unheard material in seven years. == Overview == After taking a hiatus from his solo career following 1983's Old Wave, Starr spent the next few years making TV appearances and guesting on other artists' recordings and gigs, as well as recording an album that would remain unissued. In 1988, however, he and wife Barbara Bach accepted that they both were suffering from alcoholism and took steps to rehabilitate themselves. Once Starr was sober, he felt the need to work again. Before delving into an album, he wanted to hit the road – but with a difference. Always one to include friends, Starr formed the All-Starr Band, an ever-changing live line-up of musicians that would back Starr up, in addition to each performing a song or two themselves. Booking himself on the road from July to September 1989, Starr was accompanied by Dr. John, Joe Walsh, Billy Preston, the Band's Levon Helm and Rick Danko, Nils Lofgren, Clarence Clemons, and session drummer Jim Keltner. The shows were often sold out and were well received. The performance contained here was recorded on the closing nights of the US tour at the Greek Theatre in Los Angeles. ==Release== Ringo Starr and His All-Starr Band was released through EMI on 8 October 1990 (Starr's first association with his first label since 1975). In the US however, Rykodisc assumed the distribution of the album, releasing it on 12 October 1990. Failing to chart, the release would be deleted some years later. The song \\"It Don't Come Easy\\" was released as a single from the album, backed with \\"The Weight\\" two non-album tracks \\"Rocky Mountain Way\\" (sung by Joe Walsh) and \\"Act Naturally\\" (sung by Ringo). A limited edition deluxe version of the album that included a bonus CD single was released only in the US. Another song from the same performances as the album, \\"With a Little Help from My Friends\\", was released on the compilation album Nobody's Child: Romanian Angel Appeal. ==Track listing== == Personnel == *Ringo Starr – drums, vocals *Joe Walsh – guitars, percussion, vocals *Nils Lofgren – guitars, accordion, vocals *Billy Preston – keyboards, vocals *Dr. John – piano, vocals *Garth Hudson – accordion *Rick Danko – bass guitar, vocals *Levon Helm – drums, harmonica, percussion, vocals *Jim Keltner – drums, percussion *Zak Starkey – drums *Clarence Clemons – saxophone, percussion, vocals ==References== ; Footnotes ; Citations ==External links== *http://www.ringostarr.com *JPGR's Ringo Starr and His All-Starr Band site Category:Albums produced by Joe Walsh Category:1990 live albums Category:Ringo Starr live albums Category:Rykodisc live albums Category:Albums recorded at the Greek Theatre (Los Angeles) Category:Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band ","title":"Ringo Starr and His All-Starr Band"},{"id":"2544563","text":"The Canelos-Quichua, also known as the Quichua of Pastaza, is an Indigenous people of Ecuador.

The formula was created by David Gleicher while he was working at Arthur D. Little in the early 1960s,Cady, S.H., Jacobs, J., Koller, R., & Spalding, J. (2014). The change formula: Myth, legend, or lore. OD Practitioner, 46(3), 32–39. and refined by Kathie Dannemiller in the 1980s.Wheatley, M. J., Tannebaum, R., Yardley, P. Y., & Quade, K. (2003). Organization development at work: Conversations on the values, applications, and future of OD (pp. 62–64). San Francisco, CA: John Wiley & Sons. ==Gleicher (original) version: C = A × B × D > X== The original formula, as created by Gleicher and published by Richard Beckhard (see below),Beckhard, R. (1975). Strategies for large system change. Sloan Management Review, 16(2), 43–55. is: :C = A × B × D > X where: ; C : is change; ; A : is the status quo dissatisfaction; ; B : is a desired clear state; ; D : is practical steps to the desired state; ; X : is the cost of the change. ==Dannemiller version: C = D × V × F > R== :C = D × V × F > R Three factors must be present for meaningful organizational change to take place. These factors are: ; C : is change; ; D : Dissatisfaction with how things are now; ; V : Vision of what is possible; ; F : First concrete steps that can be taken towards the vision. If the product of these three factors is greater than ; R : Resistance, then change is possible. Because D, V, and F are multiplied, if any one is absent (zero) or low, then the product will be zero or low and therefore not capable of overcoming the resistance. To ensure a successful change it is necessary to use influence and strategic thinking in order to create vision and identify those crucial, early steps towards it. In addition, the organization must recognize and accept the dissatisfaction that exists by listening to the employee voice while sharing industry trends, leadership ideas, best practices and competitor analysis to identify the necessity for change. ==Attribution confusion== It is often inaccurately attributed to Richard Beckhard because he published the formula in both versions of his widely read book Organizational Transitions. In the original 1977 version, Beckhard and Harris gave full credit to Gleicher.Beckhard, R., & Harris, R.T. (1977). Organizational transitions: Managing complex change (1st ed.). Addison-Wesley series on organization development. Reading, MA: Addison- Wesley Publishing. In the second edition from 1987, they did not even mention Gleicher's name once in the entire book, but did present the equation as a formula for overcoming resistance.Beckhard, R., & Harris, R.T. (1987). Organizational transitions: Managing complex change (2nd ed.). Addison-Wesley series on organization development. Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley Publishing. Elaine Dickson attributed the formula to Beckhard in 1971, via a National Training Laboratories Institute for Applied Behavioral Science professional OD training program (in Bethel, Massachusetts), in her 1982 book Say No, Say Yes to Change: Finding Growth Opportunities in Life's Changes (Broadman Press, p. 142). ==Popularization== It was Kathleen Dannemiller who dusted off the formula and simplified it, making it more accessible for consultants and managers. Dannemiller and Robert W. Jacobs first published the more common version of the formula in 1992.Dannemiller, K. D., & Jacobs, R. W. (1992). Changing the way organizations change: A revolution of common sense. The Journal of Applied Behavioral Science, 28(4), 480–498. Paula Griffin stated that Gleicher started it, Beckhard and Harris promoted it, but it really took off when Dannemiller changed the language to make it easier to remember and use. == Empirical research == Researchers have attempted to test the formula's effectiveness empirically. Čudanov et al. developed a quantitative measurement instrument, based on Beckhard and Harris's version of the formula, that can be utilized in change management practice. The instrument aims to support change readiness in all phases of the change management cycle, on the one hand, and to provide insights into change success factors, on the other. Post- implementation assessment can reveal key factors that cause change failure. The measurement instrument of Čudanov et al. is shown in the wikibook Handbook of Management Scales.See the following pages of the Handbook of Management Scales: * wikibooks:Handbook of Management Scales/Change initiation - Change success * wikibooks:Handbook of Management Scales/Change initiation - The degree of dissatisfaction with the status quo * wikibooks:Handbook of Management Scales/Change initiation - Clarity and strength of vision of change * wikibooks:Handbook of Management Scales/Change initiation - Clarity of actions towards preferred future state * wikibooks:Handbook of Management Scales/Change initiation - Resistance to change ==See also== * Decisional balance sheet * Force-field analysis * Immunity to change ==References== Category:Change management Category:Business terms ","title":"Formula for change"},{"id":"2544597","text":"\\"Kholstomer\\" () is a work by Leo Tolstoy that has been referred to as “one of the most striking stories in Russian literature”.

It was released June 10, 1986 on Black Dragon Records. On its release, the album had a significantly different sound than other European heavy metal bands of the time, because of their use of operatic vocals mixed over slow and heavy guitar riffs. The album did not sell well on its initial release, which led to the group being dropped from the label during the same year. Since then, the album has been re-issued in several different formats. The album title Epicus Doomicus Metallicus is a dog latin translation rendering of Epic Doom Metal — the genre which the band helped pioneer and with which it is most commonly identified. Although he was actually a guest musician at the time of its recording, this was the only Candlemass album to feature vocalist Johan Längqvist until he joined the band, officially, in 2018. ==Production== In 1985, the members of Candlemass began writing the songs \\"Under the Oak\\", \\"Crystal Ball\\", \\"Demons Gate\\" and \\"Dark Reflections\\" in Upplands Väsby. In November 1985, the group recorded a demo album at O.A.L Studios, which featured the songs \\"Demons Gate\\" and \\"Black Stone Wielder\\". The band did not have a regular lead singer at the time and Leif Edling performed vocals for the demo. The group sent the demo to Black Dragon Records in Paris, France, who offered Candlemass a one-record deal with a budget of $1,800. In February 1986, Epicus Doomicus Metallicus was recorded at Thunderload Studios in Stockholm, Sweden, with producer Ragne Wahlquist. Still without a regular vocalist, Johan Längqvist performed the vocals despite not hearing any of the music the band had performed beforehand. ==Musical style== Epicus Doomicus Metallicus' differs from other European metal bands who were known for \\"playing at breakneck speeds and screaming in a high-pitched frenzy\\". Candlemass' album features slower riffs and vocals delivered in a \\"baritone, operatic style\\". The opening song \\"Solitude\\" features lyrics revolving around themes of suicide and depression. ==Release== Epicus Doomicus Metallicus was released on June 10, 1986 on vinyl and compact disc. The band was dropped from Black Dragon Records due to disappointing album sales. Candlemass followed up the album with Nightfall (1987), after being signed to Axis Records. The album has been re-issued in several formats. These include a re-issue by Powerline Records in 2002 that included a bonus disc of a live performance recorded in Birmingham in 1988. In 2011, the album was re-issued by Peaceville Records with an expanded booklet and the same bonus disc. ==Reception== Upon release, Epicus Doomicus Metallicus was met with universal critical acclaim, and since its release it has been looked upon as a cornerstone of doom metal. Eduardo Rivadavia of the online music database AllMusic referred to the album as \\"a pillar of classic '80s metal\\" offering \\"the strongest, most consistent songwriting of the band's career\\", although it \\"was let down by vocalist Johan Längqvist, whose performance failed to deliver with the power and command of his immediate successor Messiah Marcolin.\\" Canadian reviewer Martin Popoff lauded the \\"new expression of doom as black as Black Sabbath\\" and the executions and mix of the six tracks of the album, but found them \\"too manic depressive too uniformly\\". ==Track listings== Leif Edling (pictured) wrote all the original songs for Epicus Doomicus Metallicus.

After being dropped from the label Black Dragon Records, Candlemass were the first band signed to Axis. The group had a new line-up from their previous album including vocalist Messiah Marcolin, whose decisions became instrumental during the production and release stages of the album. Two singles were released from Nightfall: \\"Samarithan\\" and \\"At the Gallows End\\". A music video was directed for the song \\"Bewitched\\" by Jonas Åkerlund. The album has been re-released in various formats and was followed up by Ancient Dreams in 1988. ==Production== After being dropped from Black Dragon Records due to the disappointing sales of their previous album Epicus Doomicus Metallicus (1986), Candlemass became the first band signed to David Constable's British label Axis Records. Constable had decided to sign the band after being impressed with their demo tape for \\"Bewitched\\". Thomas Cole's painting \\"Old Age\\" from The Voyage of Life was used for the album cover. The group's line-up had changed since their previous studio recording. Jan Lindh had replaced drummer Mats Ekström who had left the group because he could not find enough time for rehearsals. Lead guitarist Lars Johansson had also joined the band. During a tour in 1987 with King Diamond, Johansson broke his arm and was temporarily replaced by guitarist Mike Wead. The final new band member was vocalist Messiah Marcolin, who phoned Leif Edling to sing an a cappella version of \\"Solitude\\" as an audition. Like the previous album, Nightfall was recorded at Thunderload Studios in Stockholm with Ragne Wahlquist as engineer. Wead's brief membership in Candlemass lead to him allegedly recording rhythm guitar, harmony and acoustic guitars and keyboards on the album, although the only thing that is confirmed by the band as his is the recording of his song \\"Black Candles\\". Marcolin's influence was strong and included the recording of the song \\"Marche Funèbre\\" on his suggestion, the band's choice of the album cover based on Thomas Cole's paintings \\"The Voyage of Life\\", and the title Nightfall, rejecting Edling's original title for the album Gothic Stone. The song \\"Samarithan\\" was originally written during the recording sessions for Epicus Doomicus Metallicus, but was rejected by former group member Mats Ekström. After completing the sessions at Thunderload, which lasted from July to September 1987, the recordings were mixed by Mats Lindfors at Stockholm Recording Studio. ==Release== New vocalist for the group Messiah Marcolin came up with the album title for Nightfall Nightfall was released on 9 November 1987 by Axis Records on vinyl and compact disc. In 1988, the album was released in the USA by Metal Blade Records. Two singles were released from Nightfall in 1987. The first was for \\"Samaraithan\\" which was released on both 7-inch and 12-inch vinyl. Music for Nations and Metal Blade Records released \\"At the Gallows End\\" as a 12-inch single in 1988. A music video was directed by Jonas Åkerlund for the song \\"Bewitched\\" in 1988. \\"Bewitched\\" was the first music video by Åkerlund, who was previously a member of the Swedish black metal group Bathory. Åkerlund would go on to make music videos for other Swedish bands like Whale and Roxette, as well as international musicians such as Metallica, U2 and Lady Gaga. The music video also featured future Mayhem vocalist Pelle \\"Dead\\" Ohlin. In the 2000s, the album was re-released in Sweden by Powerline Records, including demo tracks, live versions of songs and a music video for the song \\"Bewitched\\". In 2007, the album was re-issued by Peaceville Records with similar bonus tracks. ==Reception== As like as the band's debut album, Nightfall was met with universal acclaim by both music critics and fans. In a contemporary review, Metal Forces editor Bernard Doe called the album \\"an essential buy for any true metal fan\\" and lauded Candlemass for mixing \\"some early Black Sabbath (circa Master of Reality), some early Rainbow (circa Rising) and some Metallica\\", and adding \\"plenty of their own original style to produce a unique sound.\\" Rock Hard reviewed positively the album, but recognized that the \\"sluggish\\" rhythms and Marcolin's \\"clean and high voice\\" could not please everyone. In a modern review, Metal Storm staff writer remarked the progress made by the band from their debut album in making \\"more complex and atmosphere/emotion-evoking\\" music and called Nightfall a \\"masterpiece.\\" AllMusic's Eduardo Rivadavia review compared the album favorably to the group's previous work, stating that it \\"managed to break even more new ground by introducing the operatic bellowing of new vocalist Messiah Marcolin, whose religious lyrics found the perfect match in the slow, grinding power chords written by bassist Leif Edling.\\" He found the work \\"cohesive\\", despite Candlemass \\"can't resist thrashing out just a tad\\" on the songs \\"At the Gallow's End\\" and \\"Dark Are the Veils of Death\\" Canadian critic Martin Popoff wrote that Nightfall sounds very similar to Candlemass' debut album and its style is a mix of \\"the slowest portions from Tony Iommi's first five years riffs\\", Trouble's \\"sleepiest moments\\" and St. Vitus' \\"downer ideas\\".

The series is set in a mystical world of elves, wizards and dragons. The series is released by Tor Books, and comprises Elvenbane (1991), Elvenblood (1995), Elvenborn (2002), and Elvenbred. Elvenbred, the fourth book in the series, has not yet been released. Due to the death of co-author Andre Norton it is stated that the series 4th book has been handed over to Mercedes Lackey as of March 17, 2017 and is intended to be started summer 2017, hopefully to have it finished by 2017's end. == Novels== ===The Elvenbane=== The world is dominated by elves, who came to the humans' world by a portal from their world, Evelon. The humans are treated as slaves and animals, but the elves have a good life. One thing mars their happiness, however - a prophecy spread by the dragons that a halfblood will come and bring about a revolution. Serina Daeth is the concubine of Elven-lord Dyran and pregnant with his child. Concubines bearing half-blood children to Elven- lords is not allowed, so concubines normally are given drugs in their food to prevent conception. Another of Dyran's concubines, vying for the top position, tampers with Serina's food, leading her to become pregnant. Serina escapes into the desert, where her child, Shana, is delivered by Alamarana, a dragon shaman who takes her home, where she is raised with Kemanorel, Alara's son. Further into the story, Shana is expelled from the dragons' clan and gets into Elven lands. There she discovers that \\"two leggers\\" still exist. However she also discovers the misery lived by some of the human slaves and is barely rescued by free halfbloods. Halfbloods have power of the mind (telekinesis, telepathy...etc.) as part of their human heritage and some power over matter as part of their elven heritage. They were known as \\"wizards\\". Shana is brought into a secret hideout of the remaining wizards and taught a bit about magic. She discovers on her own even more applications of her power. After she convinces a group of young wizard to steal some full-human kids that are to be \\"culled\\", she endangers the secret of the existence of wizards. Thereafter a war for survival pushes the wizards to fight some of the Elven Lords. === Elvenblood === Shana and her allies - other halfblood wizards, escaped human slaves and dragon shamans - have gained a small victory over the elves; however there is a long way to go. There is one band of people, however, who have escaped the elvenlords and remained hidden for all these years: the Iron People. The mystery of how they have survived for so long is great. The elven world is now changing with revolt a very close option for some, while this is happening Shana meets the ancient Iron People and discovers a secret which could help free her people or could break it down to nothing. She is helped by a pair running from their father's estate because of one dangerous reason- in their small group there is a halfblood and everyone is checking to see if they have halfbloods in their midst. Lady Sheyrena an Treves and her brother Lorryn help the wizards by giving the young Lords iron jewelry, since most of them are treated no better than slaves. === Elvenborn === This story moves away slightly from Shana and her band of rebels and focuses on Kyrtian, an elvenlord who becomes a hero in the war scarred world in which they live. When his cousin, Aelmarkin, tries to prove Kyrtian is unfit to run the estate, Kyrtian gets more power than he wants. Kyrtian is different from the other lords and keeps the humans as servants than as slaves. Thanks to his father's legacy he stumbles upon an ancient secret. This long forgotten secret elevates him to Commander of the Elven Army. The Young Lords have started rebelling against their fathers and are waging war. Kyrtian however has taken advantage of his new command and power, alongside some unexpected friends to embark on his own quest to find the Great Portal, through which the elvenlords entered this world. By finding this mystic gateway he hopes to find the reason for the disappearance of his own father and also unravel the secrets behind the origin of elvenkind. Once again the Great Portal is reopened only to hint at some strange transformation of the elves of Evelon. ==Reception== Kirkus Reviews criticized Elvenbane's \\"shallow characters and a lack of real tension\\", but stated that it was an overall entertaining book.The Elvenbane Kirkus Reviews Kirkus also reviewed Elvenblood and Elvenborn,Elvenborn Kirkus Reviews writing that Elvenblood was \\"modestly appealing and involving, if lacking real bite\\".Elvenblood Kirkus Reviews Publishers Weekly praised all three books, calling Elvenbane \\"one of the season's liveliest and most appealing fantasy epics\\".Elvenbane Publishers WeeklyElvenborn Publishers WeeklyElvenblood Publishers Weekly ==References== http://andre-norton-books.com/worlds-of- andre/andre-s-series/elvenbane The website has been reworked and the above address has changed.

According to Schnurbein (1995: 24), he became its president in 1967. The Armanen-Orden is a neopagan esoteric society and religious order reviving the occult teachings of Guido von List. Its internal structure is organized in nine grades, inspired by Freemasonry. The Order is openly ethnonationalist and racialist, and rejects race-mixing as a modern degeneration. ==History== Schleipfer had discovered some of List's works in an antique bookstore in the mid-1960s, and was inspired to found the runic and Armanist magazine IrminsulIrminsul in the German National Library. in hopes of attracting suitable people for a revived Listian order. He was appointed the new president and continued to publish Irminsul as the \\"Voice of the Guido von List Society.\\" Schleipfer also attended meetings of a related organisation, the Gode-Orden (Gothi-Order), which propagated a similar mixture of occult völkisch thinking. There he met his wife Sigrun Schleipfer, née Hammerbacher (1940–2009),Handbuch Deutscher Rechtsextremismus (1996). daughter of the völkisch writer and former NSDAP district leader, Dr. Hans Wilhelm Hammerbacher.Schnurbein (1995), p. 27ff.

They also revived the High Armanen Order (HAO) and brought it to \\"an unprecedented level of activity\\".Flowers (1988), p. 36. The Armanen-Orden celebrates seasonal festivities in a similar fashion as Odinist groups do and invites interested people to these events. The highlights are three 'Things' at Ostara (Easter), Midsummer and Fall (Wotan's sacrificial death), which are mostly celebrated at castles close to sacred places, such as the Externsteine. The author Stefanie von Schnurbein attended a Fall Thing in 1990 and gives the following report in Religion als Kulturkritik (Religion and Cultural Criticism): In 1977 Sigrun Schleipfer founded the Gemeinschaft zur Erhaltung der Burgen (Society for the Conservation of Castles), which proclaims castles to be among the \\"last paradises of the romantic era\\" in this cold modern age and had as its primary aim the purchase and restoration of a castle for the Order. In 1995, the society finally acquired the castle of Rothenhorn in Szlichtyngowa (Poland), a run-down structure dating back to the 12th century, though most of the complex dates from the 16th century. Over many years, Adolf and Sigrun have republished all of List's works (and many others relating to the Armanen runes) in their original German. Adolf Schleipfer has also contributed an article to The Secret King, a study of Karl Maria Wiligut by Stephen Flowers and Michael Moynihan, in which he points out the differences between Wiligut's beliefs and those which are accepted within Odinism or Armanism.Schleipfer (2007). ==Adolf Schleipfer== Adolf Schleipfer, born 1947 , is a German/Austrian occultist and Armanist who re-established the Guido von List Society and Armanen-Orden in 1967 and 1976, respectively.Religion als Kulturkritik, 1995.

The younger brother of Johnny Tyldesley and the leading batsman for Lancashire. He remains Lancashire's most prolific run-getter of all time. Tyldesley went on the 1928/29 Ashes Tour, where he played in one test, and played only four times in a home Ashes Test, but in 1921 he did very well in the last two games, scoring 78 at Old Trafford. ==Career== Tyldesley was born in Roe Green, Worsley, Lancashire. He had a slow start in county cricket in 1909, and though he played fairly regularly for Lancashire in the following three years – scoring his first century against Sussex in 1912 – but it was 1913 before he was firmly established in the team. That season he reached 1,000 runs for the first time and in 1914, the last season before war put a stop to cricket, he maintained this form. After war ended, 1919 saw Tyldesley jump into the ranks of the top English batsmen with some solid batting, which resulted in his nomination as a Cricketer of the Year by Wisden. Though 1920 was uneven despite a score of 244 against Warwickshire, Tyldesley was already among a large crop of top-class professional batsmen. Ernest Tyldesley 1921 1921 saw Tyldesley make his debut in Test cricket; though he was dropped after a poor performance on a damp pitch at Trent Bridge. 1922 saw him reach 2,000 runs for the first time. Tyldesley continued until injury kept him out of the last half of 1925. 1926, however, saw Tyldesley scoring 50 or better in 10 consecutive innings. Tyldesley maintained his form in 1927, and scored 3,024 runs in 1928. However, he was not at his best on his only tour of Australia in 1928/29 until injury weakened England's team at the end of the tour. Though never selected for the Test team again Tyldesley remained a prolific scorer for Lancashire right up to 1934, and in 1933 had the distinction of being granted a second benefit for his services to the county, though this only raised £802 as against £2,458 for his 1924 benefit. He scored his 100th first- class century in a game against Northamptonshire in July 1934. 1935, at the age of 46, saw him again affected by injury and playing only rarely – while the following year, playing as an amateur, he only played two matches before moving into business. Upon his finally appearance in Tests in 1929, Tyldesley's batting average of 55.00 was the highest of any player, at that time, to have completed a career of 20 innings or more. ==Name== Tyldesley was called 'George' at home, his given first name. However he signed autographs Ernest.Cricket Matches 1934 Jim Ledbetter (Limlow Books) p.121 ==Death and legacy== Tyldesley died in 1962 in Rhos-on-Sea, Denbighshire, Wales, where he lived for several years. Tyldesley's elder brother JT named the family home in Worsley, Lancashire, \\"Aigburth\\" to commemorate his younger brother's Lancashire debut at the Liverpool ground where Lancashire County Cricket Club occasionally play their matches. The home still stands today and a plaque telling the story has been erected by the Worsley Heritage Walks.

Cambridge Corn Exchange is a concert venue located in Cambridge, England with a capacity up to 1,681 people. ==Construction== The site, on the corner of Wheeler Street and Corn Exchange Street, was earmarked for a new Corn Exchange in 1868 to replace the existing corn exchange on St Andrew's Hill to the east. In the Middle Ages the Priory of Friars Hermits was located on the site, the remains of which were passed to a museum in New Zealand. Designed by Cambridge architect Richard Reynolds Rowe in the Florentine Gothic style, the foundation stone was laid by the Mayor in 1874 and the building was opened in 1875. A quarter of a million local bricks were used in various colours. The opening concert was a performance on 9 November by the Coldstream Guards and a local choral society. During the playing of the national anthem a mistake was made, and angry crowds subsequently attacked the Mayor's house. The resulting trial attracted the world's press and resulted in crowds of sightseers making visits to the building, interfering with the corn trading. ==History== Hank Van Sickle (background) and John Mayall (John Mayall & The Bluesbreakers at the Cambridge Corn Exchange, November 2006 The site was a popular location for events throughout the 19th and 20th centuries. The first Motor Show of many was held in 1898, the venue hosted the London Symphony Orchestra in 1925 and one thousand people were welcomed to a Tea For a Thousand in 1935. During the 1940s the venue was used to clean and repair rifles by local women. After the war, the venue was popular for boxing, wrestling and roller skating. The floor was usually marked out for badminton matches which were held in the building. A temporary wooden bridge across Wheeler Street was even constructed in the 1950s to join it to the neighbouring Guildhall for balls and other events. In 1965, the venue ceased being used for trading after the Cattle Market site was opened as an alternative. In the 1970s the building was used for pop concerts and one-day exhibitions. In 1972 Syd Barrett made his last public appearance at the venue supporting MC5. In 1974 1,000 fans caused a riot after The Drifters failed to appear onstage. The venue was closed in 1981 after the roof was found to be unsafe and following complaints from local residents about noise levels. The building was refitted following public pressure and various grants and donations, with the first concert taking place on 3 December 1986 starring Box Car Willie, though an official reopening occurred the following February with a performance by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra. ==Current status== The venue is presently owned and managed by Cambridge City Council. It is used for numerous touring events, including music groups, comedians and theatre groups. Performers who have played at the venue include The Who, Pink Floyd, Jethro Tull, My Bloody Valentine, Manic Street Preachers, Barenaked Ladies, Oasis, The Smiths, Iron Maiden (1980, 1981), David Bowie, Tin Machine, Queen, Paul Rodgers, Gary Moore, Lily Allen, James Bay, Steve Harley and Cockney Rebel (in 2005 and 2015 - the 2015 show was notable as it featured the surviving musicians from the original second line up, Jim Cregan, Stuart Elliott, and Duncan Mackay), Take That, NXT UK, and Shane Filan of Westlife. It is also used as an examination hall for students at the University of Cambridge, and hosts graduation ceremonies for Anglia Ruskin University. ==References== ==External links== * *Venue history Category:Commercial buildings completed in 1875 Category:1875 establishments in England Category:Music venues in Cambridgeshire Category:Theatres in Cambridge Category:Music in Cambridge Category:Culture of the University of Cambridge Category:Buildings and structures in Cambridge ","title":"Cambridge Corn Exchange"},{"id":"2544656","text":"Trevor Ashmore is a coin counterfeiter infamous for producing modern copies of ancient English coins in the 1960s.

Having been ordained in 1775, he for a short time held a cure at Misslitz, but was soon recalled to Bruck as professor of Oriental languages and Biblical hermeneutics. On the suppression of the convent by Joseph II in 1784, Jahn took up similar work in Olomouc, and in 1789 he was transferred to Vienna as professor of Oriental languages, biblical archaeology and dogmatics. In 1792 he published his Einleitung ins Alte Testament (2 vols.), which soon brought him into trouble; the cardinal-archbishop of Vienna laid a complaint against him for having departed from the traditional teaching of the Church, e.g. by asserting Job, Jonah, Tobit and Judith to be didactic poems, and the cases of demoniacal possession in the New Testament to be cases of dangerous disease. An ecclesiastical commission reported that the views themselves were not necessarily heretical, but that Jahn had erred in showing too little consideration for the views of German Catholic theologians in coming into conflict with his bishop, and in raising difficult problems by which the unlearned might be led astray. He was accordingly advised to modify his expressions in future. Although he appears honestly to have accepted this judgment, the hostility of his opponents did not cease until at last (1806) he was compelled to accept a canonry at St Stephens, Vienna, which involved the resignation of his chair. This step had been preceded by the condemnation of his Introductio in libros sacros veteris foederis in compendium redacta, published in 1804, and also of his Archaeologia biblica in compendium redacta (1805).

Therefore, most overseas Chinese banks in the United States adopted a different strategy than their Southeast Asian counterparts by serving a particular segment of the market. Most overseas Chinese banks are relatively small banks in terms of assets and they began as community banks catering to their local Chinese community in the United States.

As a city district, it has no headquarters or subdivisions. It, along with the Mumbai Suburban District, makes up the metropolis of Mumbai. The city area is called the \\"island city\\" or South Mumbai or Old Mumbai. It extends from Colaba in the south to Mahim and Sion in the north. The city has an area of 157 km² and a population of 3,085,411. ==History== The city of Mumbai came in light in the year 150 CE through the geographical work of renowned geographer, Ptolemy. The city, consisting of several islands, was then ruled by native Agris and Kolis. These natives ruled the islands up to 1345. Thereafter, Mumbai's rulers changed through history until Islamic rulers conquered what is now Maharashtra and conquered some of the islands in 1534. Subsequently, sultan of Gujarat took over all the islands, which were then conquered by the Portuguese. Following the continued support of England in the Anglo-Portuguese Alliance, stemming from the Anglo-Portuguese Treaty of 1373 and on the accession of a Catholic monarch in 1660, in 1661 the island of Mumbai was given to the British as part of a Royal Dowry, on the occasion of the marriage of King Charles II of England with the Portuguese Princess Infanta Catherine of Braganza. The island of Mumbai, was then to remain part of British Raj until 15 August 1947, the day India celebrates annually as Indian Independence day, when it became an autonomous dominion, experiencing the dawn of independence from foreign rule see History of the Republic of India. Initially, Charles II entrusted the administration of Mumbai to the East India Company. By a Royal Charter under the Regulation XIX of 1827, passed by the British Government, the Collector of Mumbai was made the Chief Controlling Authority of the Revenue Administration of Mumbai. The Collector of Mumbai enjoyed vast authority under the Mumbai Land Revenue Act 1876 which was repealed by the Maharashtra Land Revenue Code 1966. ==Demographics== According to the 2011 census Mumbai City district has a population of 3,085,411, roughly equal to the nation of Mongolia or the US state of Iowa.

The Duchess, formerly Lady Glencora Palliser, attempts to support her husband by hosting lavish parties at Gatherum Castle in Barsetshire, the family's largest country house, barely used until now. Palliser, initially unsure that he is fit to lead, grows to enjoy his high office, but becomes increasingly distressed when his government proves to be too weak and divided to accomplish anything. His own inflexible nature does not help. A significant sub-plot centres on Ferdinand Lopez, a financially overextended City adventurer of undisclosed parentage and doubtful ethnicity (possibly Jewish), who wins the favour of Emily Wharton. She marries him despite her father's objections in preference to Arthur Fletcher, who has always been in love with her. As in Trollope's earlier Palliser novel Can You Forgive Her?, in which the heroine also has to choose between two suitors, the enticing and charismatic suitor is revealed to have many unpleasant traits (here Lopez's ethnic background is also presented as a factor against him), and Emily soon has cause to regret her choice. Lopez meets the Duchess at one of her parties, and Glencora unwisely encourages him to stand for Parliament. He campaigns against Arthur Fletcher, but withdraws from the contest when he sees he has no chance of winning. Lopez writes to the Duke, insisting on being reimbursed for his election expenses since the Duchess had led him to believe that he would have the Duke's endorsement (despite having his expenses already paid in full by his father-in-law). The Duke is furious with Glencora, who disobeyed his explicit order not to interfere in the election, but his strong sense of personal honour forces him to give in to Lopez's desperate and unseemly demands. This causes a minor political scandal when it becomes known, as it appears to many people that Palliser used his great influence and wealth to try to buy a seat in Parliament for a supporter. This causes the Duke great unhappiness, but he is stoutly defended in the House of Commons by Phineas Finn, eponymous hero of Phineas Finn and Phineas Redux, two earlier books in the Palliser series. Lopez's high-risk gambles lead to his financial ruin and, after trying to persuade the wealthy Lizzie Eustace (protagonist of The Eustace Diamonds) to run away with him to Guatemala, a proposition she somewhat contemptuously rejects, he takes his own life by throwing himself in front of a train. After a period of mourning, Emily is persuaded, without too much difficulty, to marry Arthur Fletcher. Eventually the coalition government breaks apart and the Duke resigns, with both regret and relief, and withdraws into private life, hoping to be of use to his party again in the future. ==ReferencesCategory:1876 British novels Category:Novels by Anthony Trollope Category:Novels first published in serial form Category:British political novels Category:Chapman & Hall books ","title":"The Prime Minister (novel)"},{"id":"2544796","text":"Balerina Clown by Jonathan Borofsky Jonathan Borofsky (born December 24, 1942) is an American sculptor and printmaker who lives and works in Ogunquit, Maine.Hunter Drohojowska-Philp (October 24, 1999), Living Outside His Own Shell Los Angeles Times. ==Early life and education== Borofsky was born in Boston, Massachusetts.

It was created during the influx of interactive movies during the 1990s. The game is composed almost entirely of live-action full motion video, with sparse computer-generated graphics depicting external shots of the boat during torpedo attacks and atmospheric fly-bys. A version playable on DVD players was released in 1999, following from a DVD-ROM version in 1997. The DVD-ROM version was the first video game formatted for DVD. A sequel, Silent Steel 2, was announced by Tsunami for release in 1997, but it was cancelled. ==Gameplay== The gameplay consists of choosing from three options when the video pauses at certain points. Once the player chooses, the video resumes. This creates several possible plotlines and outcomes. Most of these result in the destruction of the player's submarine; only two distinct threads lead to victory. ==Plot== The player commands the USS Idaho, a fictional Ohio-class ballistic missile submarine. On a routine nuclear deterrence patrol, an encoded message is received from U.S. COMSUBLANT. The message reports that a stolen Libyan diesel sub has exited the Mediterranean Sea, possibly heading into Idahos area of operations. Idaho must evade the potentially hostile submarine, a problem that is quickly complicated by the fact that the enemy submarine is equipped with sound-generating equipment that allows her to mimic other classes of submarine, including those of American design. The rogue Kilo uses this tactic to launch a torpedo attack on the Idaho by pretending to be an allied Los Angeles-class sub, USS Biloxi. After escaping the initial battle, a radio consultation with an American carrier battle group commander confirms that there are no other allied submarines operating in the area, and that a second hostile sub, a Russian Akula-class attack boat that has also gone rogue, is approaching the area. In addition to this, Idaho's sonar officer notices that Idaho seems to be emitting a low-frequency sonar signal that he cannot account for. After a conference with Idahos executive officer and master chief, further engagements commence, where Idaho eventually triumphs through subterfuge and risk-taking. Taking advantage of the lull in combat before the Akula-class submarine comes into torpedo range, a search of Idahos outer hull reveals an act of sabotage instigated by one of the crew working for the enemy. Engaging the Akula in a torpedo battle, Idaho gains the upper hand by the timely interference of an American ASW helicopter tracking the battle and manages to win the fight.

An early two-chain version was patented by in 1869 by Barberon and Meunier. A single-chain version was patented in 1903 by the bicycle manufacturer Hirondelle. Some hobbyists have converted modern bicycles to use retro-direct gearing. ==Technical details== In the single-chain system, the chain runs from the top of a chainring attached to the cranks to the top of a sprocket attached to the rear wheel hub with a freewheel, as with most bicycle chain drives. The chain then, usually, wraps around the rear sprocket to an idler sprocket between the rear wheel and the cranks, then runs back to a second sprocket attached to the rear wheel with a second freewheel, and finally returns to the bottom of the chain ring. Other configurations are possible, including one chain for forward pedalling, and a second crossed-chain configuration for reverse pedalling. Only one freewheel is engaged at a time, while the other spins backward freely. Since the chain wraps around the second sprocket in the opposite direction to the first sprocket, the cyclist needs only to pedal backwards to engage it. The small amount of out-of-line required of the chain is easily accommodated. The rear wheel cannot rotate backwards because the two freewheels try to drive the pedals forward and backward at the same time. Usually the second sprocket is larger, which provides the cyclist a lower gear for climbing steep inclines simply by pedaling backwards. While most historical examples of retro-direct bicycles used the reverse gear for climbing, several modern retro-direct riders prefer pedalling forward when standing to accelerate from rest and climb, and engaging the higher cruising gear while pedalling backwards. ==References== == External links == *Pierre's retro-direct bicycle * Hirondelle rètro-direct *Hirondelle Retro-direct *Kent Peterson's retro-direct bicycle *Yahoo!

Anatoly Papanov documentary by Russia-K, 2007 (in Russian) His mother Elena Boleslavovna Roskovskaya (1901—1973) was a Polish milliner who secretly converted from Roman Catholicism to Russian Orthodoxy. Anatoli himself was raised in Orthodox traditions. In 1930 the family moved to Moscow. As a schoolboy Papanov attended drama courses, then went on to work as a caster at a factory, simultaneously performing in a popular theatre studio for factory workers organized by Vakhtangov Theatre actors led by Vasili Kuza whom Papanov later considered his first teacher. During the late 1930s he made a number of uncredited appearances in movies, such as a sailor in Lenin in October (1937) or a passerby in The Foundling (1939). In 1941, after the invasion of the Soviet Union, Papanov joined the Red Army and left for the front line. As a senior sergeant he headed an anti- aircraft warfare platoon. In June 1942, he was badly wounded by an explosion and lost two toes on his right foot. He spent six months in a military hospital and was sent home as disabled, and for the next several years he could only walk with a cane. In 1985 he was awarded the 1st class Order of the Patriotic War.Anatoli Papanov at the People's Deed website (in Russian) Despite his injury, in 1943 Papanov entrolled as a student in the acting faculty of the State Institute of Theatre Arts, taking courses with Vasili Orlov.

There, they founded a Klaipėda Russian Drama Theatre, where he performed for several years. In 1948 Andrey Goncharov suggested he join the Moscow Satire Theatre, where he continued to act up until his death, performing in about 50 plays.Theatre Roles at the website in the memory of Anantoli Papanov (in Russian) Among his popular roles were Alexander Koreiko in The Little Golden Calf (1958), Kisa Vorobyaninov in The Twelve Chairs (1960, both based on the novels by Ilf and Petrov), Vasily Tyorkin in Aleksandr Tvardovsky's Tyorkin in the Other World (1966), Anton Antonovich in Nikolai Gogol's The Government Inspector (1972), Nikolai Shubin in Grigori Gorin's and Arkady Arkanov's Little Comedies of the Big House (1973), Pavel Famusov in Alexander Griboyedov's Woe from Wit (1976), Roman Khludov in Mikhail Bulgakov's Flight (1977), Leonid Gayev in Anton Chekhov's The Cherry Orchard (1984), and others.Theatre history at the official Moscow Satire Theatre website (in Russian) Apart from performing, Papanov also taught acting at the State Institute of Theatre Arts, and in 1986 he staged his first and last play, The Last Ones by Maxim Gorky. Being a devout Christian, Papanov wanted to end it with a prayer. To avoid possible censorship, he used a radio record of Feodor Chaliapin performing a prayer. ===Cinema=== During the 1960s, Papanov began regularly appearing in films. He performed leading roles in the comedies Come Tomorrow, Please... (1962), directed by Yevgeny Tashkov, and Children of Don Quixote (1965), directed by Yevgeny Karelov, and appeared in several comedies by Eldar Ryazanov, including Nowhere Man (1961), where he played four roles at once. It didn't bring him any fame, though, as the movie was heavily criticized upon release and quickly banned for 25 years straight.Olga Afanasieva (2015). Eldar Ryazanov. Irony of Fate, or.... — Moscow: Algorythm, p. 26 Papanov became very famous, however, after his work as General Serpilin in Aleksandr Stolper's war drama The Alive and the Dead (1964). For this role he was awarded the Vasilyev Brothers State Prize of the RSFSR and the main prize at the First All-Union Film Festival, and Konstantin Simonov personally lauded his work.Cinema: Encyclopedia Dictionary, main ed.

Its popularity led Leonid Gaidai to cast them in his 1968 comedy The Diamond Arm as the main antagonists, a pair of smugglers who tried to get their hands on the hero's \\"diamond arm\\". The film was seen by 76.7 million people on the year of release, becoming the third most popular Soviet movie of all time.Soviet box office leaders at KinoPoisk In 1971, Gaidai also tried both actors for the leading parts in his adaptation of The Twelve Chairs, but decided otherwise.Anna Veligzhanina.

Papanov was also highly sought-after by animation directors. His distinguishing growling voice suited all kind of beasts such as Shere Khan from The Adventures of Mowgli (1967), a Soviet adaptation of The Jungle Book. His most popular characters, though, were wolves, especially after he voiced the Wolf character in the top-rated animated series Well, Just You Wait!

After work on the movie was finished, Papanov returned from Karelia to his Moscow flat and decided to take a shower although the hot water was off that day. He died in the bath from a heart attack. Just eleven days later, his long-time friend and co-star Andrei Mironov would die from a cerebral hemorrhage.

It was first formulated by Gregory Palamas (1296–1359) as part of his defense of the Athonite monastic practice of hesychasmos against the charge of heresy brought by the humanist scholar and theologian Barlaam of Calabria. In layman's terms, God's essence is distinct from God's energies in the same manner as the sun's essence and energies are distinct. The sun's essence is a ball of burning gas, while the Orthodox hold that God's essence is incomprehensible.St. John of Damascus, and see the Divine Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom As the sun's essence is certainly unapproachable and unendurable, so the Orthodox hold of God's essence.Exodux 33:20 As the sun's energies on Earth, however, can be experienced and are evidenced by changes they induce (ex. melting, hardening, growing, bleaching, etc.), the same is said of God's energies--though perhaps in a more spiritual sense (ex. melting of hearts or strength ,2 Kingdoms 17:10 (LXX) / 2 Samuel 17:10 (MT) hardening of hearts,Exodus 4:21 spiritual growth,Luke 2:52, 2 Peter 3:18 bleaching to be \\"white as snow,\\"Isaiah 1:18 though more physical and psychological manifestations occur as well as in miracles, and inspiration, etc.). The important points being made are that while God is unknowable in His essence, He can be known (i.e. experienced) in His energies, and such experience changes neither who or what God is nor who or what the one experiencing God is. Just like a plant does not become the sun simply because it soaked up the light and warmth and grew. Nor does a person who soaks up the warmth and light of God and spiritually grows ever become God--though such may be called a child of God or \\"a god.\\"Psalm 81:6 (LXX); or 82:6 (MT) Orthodox theologians generally regard this distinction as a real distinction, and not just a conceptual distinction. Historically, Western Christian thought, since the time of the Great Schism, has tended to reject the essence–energies distinction as real in the case of God, characterizing the view as a heretical introduction of an unacceptable division in the Trinity and suggestive of polytheism.John Meyendorff (editor), Gregory Palamas – The Triads, p. xi. Paulist Press, 1983, , although that attitude has never been universally prevalent in the Catholic Church and has been even more widely criticised in the catholic theology for the last century (see section 3 of this article).

Romanides, The Greek Orthodox Theological Review, Volume VI, Number 2, Winter, 1960–61. Published by the Holy Cross Greek Orthodox Theological School Press, Brookline, Massachusetts. According to catholic-church.org, The mystagogical teachings of hesychasm were approved in the Orthodox Church by a series of local Hesychast councils in the 14th century, and Gregory's commemoration during the liturgical season of Great Lent is seen as an extension of the Sunday of Orthodoxy.\\"No doubt the leaders of the party held aloof from these vulgar practices of the more ignorant monks, but on the other hand they scattered broadcast perilous theological theories. Palamas taught that by asceticism one could attain a corporal, i.e. a sense view, or perception, of the Divinity. He also held that in God there was a real distinction between the Divine Essence and Its attributes, and he identified grace as one of the Divine propria making it something uncreated and infinite. These monstrous errors were denounced by the Calabrian Barlaam, by Nicephorus Gregoras, and by Acthyndinus. The conflict began in 1338 and ended only in 1368, with the solemn canonization of Palamas and the official recognition of his heresies. He was declared the 'holy doctor' and 'one of the greatest among the Fathers of the Church', and his writings were proclaimed 'the infallible guide of the Christian Faith'. Thirty years of incessant controversy and discordant councils ended with a resurrection of polytheism\\" (Simon Vailhé, \\"Greek Church\\" in Catholic Encyclopedia (New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1909) ==Eastern Orthodox views== ===Essence and energy=== In Eastern Orthodox theology God's essence is called ousia, \\"all that subsists by itself and which has not its being in another\\", and is distinct from his energies (energeia in Greek, actus in Latin) or activities as actualized in the world.Aristotle East and West by David Bradshaw, pp. 91, 95 Cambridge University Press (27 December 2004) The ousia of God is God as God is. The essence, being, nature and substance of God as taught in Eastern Christianity is uncreated, and cannot be comprehended in words. According to Lossky, God's ousia is \\"that which finds no existence or subsistence in another or any other thing\\".The Mystical Theology of the Eastern Church, by Vladimir Lossky, SVS Press, 1997, pp. 50–55, , (James Clarke & Co. Ltd., 1991. ) God's ousia has no necessity or subsistence that needs or is dependent on anything other than itself. It is the energies of God that enable us to experience something of the Divine, at first through sensory perception and then later intuitively or noetically. As St John Damascene states, \\"all that we say positively of God manifests not his nature but the things about his nature.\\"The Mystical Theology of the Eastern Church, by Vladimir Lossky, SVS Press, 1997.

According to Vladimir Lossky of the neopatristic school, if we deny the real distinction between essence and energy, we cannot fix any clear borderline between the procession of the divine persons (as existences and/or realities of God) and the creation of the world: both the one and the other will be equally acts of the divine nature (strictly uncreated from uncreated). The being and the action(s) of God then would appear identical, leading to the teaching of pantheism.\\"If we deny the real distinction between essence and energy, we cannot fix any very clear borderline between the procession of the divine persons and the creation of the world: both the one and the other will be equally acts of divine nature. The being and the action of God would then appear to be identical and as having the same character of necessity, as is observed by St Mark of Ephesus (fifteenth century). We must then distinguish in God His nature, which is one; and three hypostases; and the uncreated energy which proceeds from and manifests forth the nature from which it is inseparable. If we participate in God in His energies, according to the measure of our capacity, this does not mean that in His procession ad extra God does not manifest Himself fully. God is in no way diminished in His energies; He is wholly present in each ray of His divinity.\\" The Mystical Theology of the Eastern Church, by Vladimir Lossky, SVS Press, 1997, pp. 73–75 () James Clarke & Co.

Aidan Nichols, Palamas's essence–energies distinction is not a mere \\"formal\\" distinction \\"demanded by the limited operating capacities of human minds\\". According to Anna N. Williams's study of Palamas, which is more recent than the assessments of Hart and Philips, in only two passages does Palamas state explicitly that God's energies are \\"as constitutively and ontologically distinct from the essence as are the three Hypostases,\\" and in one place he makes explicit his view, repeatedly implied elsewhere, that the essence and the energies are not the same; but Williams contends that not even in these passages did Palamas intend to argue for an \\"ontological or fully real distinction,\\" and that the interpretation of his teaching by certain polemical modern disciples of his is false. ===Orthodox criticism of Western theology=== Eastern Orthodox theologians have criticized Western theology, especially the traditional scholastic claim that God is actus purus, for its alleged incompatibility with the essence–energies distinction. Christos Yannaras writes, \\"The West confuses God's essence with his energy, regarding the energy as a property of the divine essence and interpreting the latter as \\"pure energy\\" (actus purus)\\"Christos Yannaras, Orthodoxy and the West: Hellenic Self-Identity in the Modern Age (Holy Cross Orthodox Press, 2006), p. 36. According to George C. Papademetriou, the essence–energies distinction \\"is contrary to the Western confusion of the uncreated essence with the uncreated energies and this is by the claim that God is Actus Purus\\".George C. Papademetriou, Introduction to St. Gregory Palamas (Holy Cross Orthodox Press, 2004), p. 61. ==Roman Catholic perspectives== The Roman Catholic Church distinguishes between doctrine, which is single and must be accepted by Roman Catholics, and theological elaborations of doctrine, about which Catholics may legitimately disagree. With respect to the Eastern and Western theological traditions, the Catholic Church recognizes that, at times, one tradition may \\"come nearer to a full appreciation of some aspects of a mystery of revelation than the other, or [express] it to better advantage.\\" In these situations, the Church views the various theological expressions \\"often as mutually complementary rather than conflicting.\\" A concrete example of the application of this principle is the separate presentation in the 1912 Catholic Encyclopedia article on the Blessed Trinity of the Church's doctrine on the Trinity as interpreted in Greek theology and in Latin theology, without denigrating either interpretation. According to Meyendorff, from Palamas's time until the twentieth century, Roman Catholic theologians generally rejected the idea that there is in God a real essence–energies distinction. In their view, a real distinction between the essence and the energies of God contradicted the teaching of the First Council of NicaeaJohn Meyendorff (editor), Gregory Palamas – The Triads, p. xi. Paulist Press, 1983, . Retrieved on 12 September 2014. on divine unity. Catholic theologian Ludwig Ott held that an absence of real distinction between the attributes of God and God's essence is a dogma of the Catholic Church.\\"In distinguishing between God and His attributes, one is going against a doctrine of the faith: 'The Divine Attributes are really identical among themselves and with the Divine Essence' (De fide). The reason lies in the absolute simplicity of God. The acceptance of a real distinction (distinctio realis) would lead to acceptance of a composition in God, and with that to a dissolution of the Godhead. In the year 1148, a Synod at Rheims, in the presence of Pope Eugene III, condemned, on the instance of St. Bernard of Clairvaux, the doctrine of Gilbert of Poitiers, who, according to the accusation of his opponents, posited a real difference between Deus and Divinitas, so that there would result a quaternity in God (Three Persons plus Godhead). This teaching, which is not obvious in Gilbert's writings, was rejected at the Council of Rheims (1148) in the presence of Pope Eugene III (D. 389 et seq.)\\" (James Bastible (editor)Dr Ludwig Ott, Fundamentals of Catholic Dogma, p. 28, Tan Books and Publishers, 1960, Retrieved 12 September 2014) In contrast, Jürgen Kuhlmann argues that the Roman Catholic Church never judged Palamism to be heretical, adding that Palamas did not consider that the distinction between essence and energies in God made God composite. According to Kuhlmann, \\"the denial of a real distinction between essence and energies is not an article of Catholic faith\\".Catherine Mowry LaCugna, God for Us: The Trinity and Christian Life, p. 200. HarperSanFrancisco, 1991, . Retrieved on 12 September 2014. According to Meyendorff, the later twentieth century saw a change in the attitude of Roman Catholic theologians to Palamas, a \\"rehabilitation\\" of him that has led to increasing parts of the Western Church considering him a saint, even if uncanonized. Some Western scholars maintain that there is no conflict between the teaching of Palamas and Roman Catholic thought on the distinction. According to G. Philips, the essence–energies distinction of Palamas is \\"a typical example of a perfectly admissible theological pluralism\\" that is compatible with the Roman Catholic magisterium. Jeffrey D. Finch claims that \\"the future of East-West rapprochement appears to be overcoming the modern polemics of neo-scholasticism and neo-Palamism\\". Some Western theologians have incorporated the essence–energies distinction into their own thinking.Kallistos Ware Oxford Companion to Christian Thought; (Oxford University Press 2000 ), p. 186. Retrieved on 21 January 2012. ==Protestant views== ===Kierkegaard and the relationship to existentialism=== The Danish Lutheran philosopher Søren Kierkegaard, widely considered the father of existentialism, expressed (pseudonymously as Anti-Climacus) in Concluding Unscientific Postscript to Philosophical Fragments an approach to God which holds that the Father's hypostasis (existence) has logical primacy over his ousia (essence or substance). Hence the teaching that the core of existentialist philosophy can be understood as the maxim, \\"existence precedes essence.\\" This has caused many Western observers to see Eastern Orthodox Christian theology as existentialistic (since the Essence–Energies distinction also somewhat holds the view).The encyclopedia of Christianity, Volume 5 By Erwin Fahlbusch p. 418. Eerdmans Publishing, 2008, . Retrieved on 21 January 2012. This also accounts for other existentialist works such as Fyodor Dostoevsky's Notes from Underground. In the case of Dostoevsky, his existentialist outlook would have drawn from his Russian Orthodox faith, but there is no record of Dostoevsky (and the Eastern Orthodox church in general) being exposed to or influenced by Kierkegaard's philosophical works. == See also == ;Orthodox theology * Deification (theosis) and synergy * Uncreated Light * Cappadocian Fathers * Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite * Byzantine philosophy ;Neo-Palamism *Vladimir Lossky *Archimandrite Sophrony *John Meyendorff ;Stochastics * Stochastics * Pavel Florensky ;Western philosophy * Plethon * Heidegger ;Asia * Bhedabheda * Essence-Function * Shakti ;Judaism * Atzmus and Ohr * Ein Sof ==Notes== ==References== ==Bibliography== * *Vladimir Lossky The Mystical Theology of the Eastern Church, SVS Press, 1997.

Saifuddin adapted the modernisation in Western and European ideas, and established its benefits for the Bohras, whilst still steeped in the traditions and the culture of the community's Fatimid heritage. Saifuddin laid substantial groundwork in terms of philanthropy, education, entrepreneurship, social outreach, political outreach, and community upliftment upon which his successors, Mohammed Burhanuddin and Mufaddal Saifuddin, continued to build, resulting in unprecedented era of prosperity among the Dawoodi Bohras. ==Early life== Taher Saifuddin was born to Mohammed Burhanuddin I and Amatullah Aaisaheba on 4 August 1888 in Surat, British India (present day the state of Gujarat). ==Da'i al-Mutlaq== Saifuddin confers honorary doctorate to King Saud in 1955 at Aligarh. Saifuddin became the 51st al-Dāʿī al-Mutlaq in the year 1915 at the age of 28. He rebuilt or repaired many monuments of Fatimi Imams, al-Dāʿī al-Mutlaq, and other structures, and artifacts. He was the Chancellor of the Aligarh Muslim University for four consecutive terms, which had only few Bohra students. ===The Chandabhoy Galla Case=== ==Contributions to Islamic Institutions== Saifuddin contributed vast sums of money towards the refurbishment of mosques and shrines. He along with the Nizam of Hyderabad were among the few Indian Muslims to contribute towards the renovation of Al Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem: :Sultan Taher Saif al-Din is said to have come from India with one hundred and fifty of his followers...At the Jerusalem station he was welcomed by the Mufti and other Sheikhs of the Supreme Moslem Council and a number of Arab notables including Ragheb Bey Nashashibi. A troop of Arab boy scouts paraded in his honour and there were two bands from Moslem institutions...The sultan was reputed to be a man of great wealth who had made substantial contributions to the religious and political funds of the Arabs of this country. Saifuddin also gifted the internal curtains which were kept in the Kaaba for decades to King Abdul Aziz of Saudi Arabia in 1354AH, with whom he kept warm relations. Saifuddin constructed Ghurrat-ul Masajid (), also known as Saifee Masjid, in Mumbai, Al-Mahal al-Saifee () for pilgrims in Mecca, the zarih of Ali Ibn Abi Talib in Najaf and Husayn ibn Ali in Karbala and Cairo, the mausoleum of Qutub Khan Qutub al-Din and Fakhr al-Din Shaheed. He also made and donated the kiswah for the Masjid al-Haram. ==Family== The 51st, 52nd, and 53rd Dai al-Mutlaq . Saifuddin married Husaina Aaisaheba, who was also from the family of Da'i al-Mutlaq. After her death, he then married Vazira Aaisaheba, Fatima Aaisaheba, and Amina Aaisaheba. Saifuddin fathered 12 sons and 8 daughters: His sons were Mohammed Burhanuddin, Husain Husamuddin, Abdut Taiyeb Zakiyuddin, Yusuf Najmuddin, Ismail Shehabuddin, Hatim Hamiduddin, Qasim Hakimuddin, Aliasgar Kalimuddin, Shabbir Nooruddin, Abbas Fakhruddin, Mohammed al-Baqir Jamaluddin, and Khuzaima Qutbuddin. His daughters were Asma, Maryam, Khadijah, Zahra, Shireen, Banu, Fatema, and Zainab. Taher Saifuddin belongs to family of Syedi Fakhruddin and Syedi Hakimuddin. ==Works== ===Rasāʾil Ramaḍāniyya (Epistles)=== Saifuddin's Risalah () are peculiarly titled gematrically equivalent to the Hijri year of its publication. { class=\\" sortable mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\\" + - !

Saifuddin was among the first people to be conferred Doctor of Laws by Karachi University . Saifuddin was voted among 100 Greatest Indian Muslims of the Twentieth Century in an opinion poll run by Milli Gazette. ==Death== Raudat Tahera in Mumbai, Saifuddin's final resting place, built by his son Mohammed Burhanuddin, inaugurated by Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed, the fifth President of India, in 1975. Saifuddin died on 12 November 1965 (19 Rajab al-Asab 1385H) at Matheran, a hill-station in Maharashtra, India. He is buried at Raudat Tahera, a mausoleum opposite Gurrat-ul Masajid in South Bombay, constructed by his successor, Mohammed Burhanuddin. ==Legacy== ===The Dandi Memorial=== Saifuddin donated his home Saifee Villa in Dandi, Navsari where Gandhi stayed for ten days during his historic march from Sabarmati Ashram against the English Salt Laws, to Nehru in 1961, which was later converted into a National Museum. It lies adjacent to the 15-acre National Salt Satyagraha Memorial in Dandi inaugurated by Narendra Modi in 2019. ===Education=== Saifuddin was instrumental in setting up over 350 co-ed institutes, some of which bear his name, including but not limited to: Aljamea-tus-Saifiyah in Surat, Saifee Hall in Calcutta, Saifiyah Girls School in Karachi, Saifi High in Mumbai, Saifee Nursery at Saifee Mahal in Mumbai, Saifee Eide Zahabi College in Karachi, Saifee Golden Jubilee Quaderia College in Burhanpur, Saifee Jubilee Arts and Commerce College in Sidhpur. Mohammed Burhanuddin later organized the schools under the banner of MSB Educational Institute (also known as Al Madrasa Tus Saifiya Tul Burhaniyah), which are affiliated with Indian Certificate of Secondary Education and, as of 2011, has branches in 22 cities across India, Pakistan, East Africa, and the Middle East. Burhanuddin organized the numerous religious schools world-wide known as Madrasas under the purview of the department of Attalim. ====Aljamea-tus- Saifiyah==== Saifuddin from his own personal wealth renovated Dars-e Saifee, an institution of Islamic studies, founded by his predecessor Abdeali Saifuddin in Surat, transformed it in to a University by introducing secular courses and establishing affiliations with international educational bodies, and consequently renamed it Aljamea-tus-Saifiyah (). Keeping in line with tradition of his predecessor, Ismail Badr al-Din I, the talabat al-ilm () of the institution were provided with lodging and meals at full cost to the office of Dai al-Mutlaq. To further inclusion and expansion, Saifuddin admitted to Aljamea its first female students. As is tradition, in his capacity as Dai al-Mutlaq, Saifuddin personally taught select classes at the newly renovated Academy. Saifuddin brought about a structural and functional change at Aljamea: He personally oversaw the standardization of the syllabus of each class and wrote numerous memoranda and treatises which were instilled into the curriculum. To this day, the treatises written by Saifuddin and his successors, Mohammed Burhanuddin and Mufaddal Saifuddin, are taught through the year and are central subjects of al-Imtihan al-Sanawi (), among other religious and secular subjects. After succeeding his father, Burhanuddin significantly expanded the reach of Aljamea: He added Mahad al-Zahra, an institute of Quranic studies , re-renovated the Surat campus , established campuses at Karachi , Nairobi , and Mumbai . Aljamea and its graduates have since become integral to spiritual and temporal aspects of the Dawoodi Bohra community. ====Aligarh Muslim University==== The Syedna Taher Saifuddin School at Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) is named after him in his honour. Saifuddin was the longest serving chancellor at AMU at 12 years, and was a patron of the Ali Society at AMU. ===Community service=== Saifuddin pictured with his successor Mohammed Burhanuddin . Saifuddin founded Bunaiyat-tul-Eidiz-Zahabi, a volunteer-run organisation of Dawoodi Bohra Women, in the 1950s which set a precedent that led to formation of Burhani Womens Association by his son Burhanuddin; Happy Threads and Supermums by Mufaddal Saifuddin's daughter Umme Haani in , and The Radiant Arts by Mufaddal Saifuddin's daughter-in-law Zaenab Imaduddin. In a similar vein, Saifuddin established an organisation of Dawoodi Bohra men, Shabab ul-Eid iz-Zahabi, during the Golden Jubilee celebrations of his 50 years in the office of Dai al-Mutlaq, exclusively for community service. Mohammed Burhanuddin would later found the Burhani Guards (for crowd- control at miqaats ), Tolaba ul-Kulliyat il-Mumenoon (of college and school students), Burhani Medical Idara (of medical professionals), Saifee Ambulance in India, and Burhani Ambulance in Pakistan (of paramedics and first responders). Mufaddal Saifuddin, on his first visit to North America, established Saifee Burhani Medical Association (America), on 14 March 2015. ===Rasm-e Saifee=== To subsidize costs and facilitate marriages among the close knit Dawoodi Bohra, Saifuddin initiated Rasm-e Saifee () in Jamnagar and later institutionalised it . Rasm-e Saifee is a singular occasion when multiple Nikah are solemnized at the hands of the Da'i al-Mutlaq and his representatives. Burhanuddin further organized it under International Taiyseer al-Nikah Committee (ITNC) (), which organizes Rasm-e Saifee throughout the year at various miqaats (). Burhanuddin's successor, Mufaddal Saifuddin, continues to uphold the tradition. ===Hospitals=== Saifee Hospital in Mumbai, inaugurated by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in 2005, was dedicated to Saifuddin by his successor, Mohammed Burhanuddin, who built the hospital in social service. Saifee Hospital was one of the first responders to 2008 Mumbai Terror Attacks. Another hospital of the same name was built by Mohammed Burhanuddin in Karachi and dedicated to his father. ===Housing=== In 2009 Mohammed Burhanuddin founded Saifee Burhani Upliftment Trust (SBUT), a large- scale cluster redevelopment project in Bhendi Bazaar and dedicated it to his father, Saifuddin. The Government of Maharashtra plans to develop Kamathipura, one of the oldest neighborhoods of South Mumbai, after the cluster redevelopment model pioneered by SBUT. ===Remembrance=== Saifuddin's urs () is commemorated annually by the Dai al-Mutlaq at Saifee Masjid, South Bombay. Since 2014, Aljamea-tus-Saifiyah's annual examinations are conducted at the conclusion of Saifuddin's urs. ===Memorials=== Shortly after Saifuddin's demise, on 18 March 1966 Mohammed Burhanuddin established His Holiness Dr. Syedna Taher Saifuddin Memorial Trust for educational and medicinal financial aid for institutions and individuals. In memory of his father Burhanuddin set up Matheran Memorial Hall, a museum and lodging facility in the hill station of Matheran, where Saifuddin breathed his last. ==Notes== ==References== ==Further reading== *Abdul Qaiyum Mulla Habibullah, His Holiness Syedna Taher Saifuddin Saheb, Dai-ul-Mutlaq of Dawoodi Bohra, Dawoodi Bohra Book Depot Publications, 1953. * *Life and Works of His Holiness Syedna Dr. Taher Saifuddin Saheb, Leader Press Pvt.

In many countries, resistance movements were sometimes also referred to as The Underground. The resistance movements in WWII can be broken down into two primary politically polarized camps: the internationalist and usually Communist Party-led anti-fascist resistance that existed in nearly every country in the world; and the various fascist/anti-communist nationalist resistance groups in Nazi- or Soviet-occupied countries that opposed the foreign fascists and the communists, often switching sides depending on the vicissitudes of the war and which side of the ever-moving military front lines they found themselves on. Among the most notable resistance movements were the Polish Resistance, including the Polish Home Army, Leśni, and the whole Polish Underground State; Yugoslav Partisans, the Soviet partisans, the Italian Resistenza led mainly by the Italian CLN; the French Resistance, the Belgian Resistance, the Norwegian Resistance, the Danish Resistance, the Greek Resistance, the Czech resistance, the Albanian resistance, the Dutch Resistance especially the \\"LO\\" (national hiding organisation) and the politically persecuted opposition in Germany itself (there were 16 main resistance groups and at least 27 failed attempts to assassinate Hitler with many more planned): in short, across German-occupied Europe. Many countries had resistance movements dedicated to fighting or undermining the Axis invaders, and Nazi Germany itself also had an anti-Nazi movement. Although Britain was not occupied during the war, the British made complex preparations for a British resistance movement. The main organisation was created by the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS, aka MI6) and is now known as Section VII. In addition there was a short-term secret commando force called the Auxiliary Units. Various organizations were also formed to establish foreign resistance cells or support existing resistance movements, like the British Special Operations Executive and the American Office of Strategic Services (the forerunner of the Central Intelligence Agency). There were also resistance movements fighting against the Allied invaders. In Italian East Africa, after the Italian forces were defeated during the East African Campaign, some Italians participated in a guerrilla war against the British (1941–1943). The German Nazi resistance movement (\\"Werwolf\\") never amounted to much. The \\"Forest Brothers\\" of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania included many fighters who operated against the Soviet occupation of the Baltic States into the 1960s. During or after the war, similar anti-Soviet resistance rose up in places like Romania, Poland, Bulgaria, Ukraine, and Chechnya. While historians and governments of some European countries have attempted to portray resistance to Nazi occupation as widespread among their populations,Rosbottom, Ronald C. (2014), When Paris Went Dark, New York: Little, Brown and Company, pp. 198-199 only a small minority of people participated in organized resistance, estimated at one to three percent of the population of countries in western Europe. In eastern Europe where Nazi rule was more oppressive, a larger percentage of people were in organized resistance movements, for example, an estimated 10-15 percent of the Polish population. Passive resistance by non- cooperation with the occupiers was much more common.Wieviorka, Olivier and Tebinka, Jacek, \\"Resisters: From Everyday Life to Counter-state,\\" in Surviving Hitler and Mussolini (2006), eds: Robert Gildea, Olvier Wieviorka, and Anette Warring, Oxford: Berg, p. 153 == Organization == After the first shock following the Blitzkrieg, people slowly started to get organized, both locally and on a larger scale, especially when Jews and other groups were starting to be deported and used for the Arbeitseinsatz (forced labor for the Germans). Organization was dangerous, so much resistance was done by individuals. The possibilities depended much on the terrain; where there were large tracts of uninhabited land, especially hills and forests, resistance could more easily get organised undetected. This favoured in particular the Soviet partisans in Eastern Europe. In the much more densely populated Netherlands, the Biesbosch wilderness could be used to go into hiding. In northern Italy, both the Alps and the Apennines offered shelter to partisan brigades, though many groups operated directly inside the major cities. There were many different types of groups, ranging in activity from humanitarian aid to armed resistance, and sometimes cooperating to a varying degree. Resistance usually arose spontaneously, but was encouraged and helped mainly from London and Moscow. ==Size== The five largest resistance movements in Europe were the Dutch, the French, the Polish, the Soviet, and the Yugoslav; overall their size can be seen as comparable, particularly in the years 1941–1944. A number of sources note that the Polish Home Army was the largest resistance movement in Nazi- occupied Europe. Norman Davies writes that the \\"Armia Krajowa (Home Army), the AK,... could fairly claim to be the largest of European resistance [organizations].\\" Gregor Dallas writes that the \\"Home Army (Armia Krajowa or AK) in late 1943 numbered around 400,000, making it the largest resistance organization in Europe.\\"Gregor Dallas, 1945: The War That Never Ended, Yale University Press, 2005, , Google Print, p.79 Mark Wyman writes that the \\"Armia Krajowa was considered the largest underground resistance unit in wartime Europe.\\"Mark Wyman, DPs: Europe's Displaced Persons, 1945–1951, Cornell University Press, 1998, , Google Print, p. 34 However, the numbers of Soviet partisans were very similar to those of the Polish resistance,See, for example, Leonid D.

For the French Resistance, François Marcot ventured an estimate of 200,000 activists and a further 300,000 with substantial involvement in Resistance operations. For the Resistance in Italy, Giovanni di Capua estimates that, by August 1944, the number of partisans reached around 100,000, and it escalated to more than 250,000 with the final insurrection in April 1945.Resistenzialismo versus resistenza == Forms of resistance == Various forms of resistance were: * Non- violent ** Sabotage – the Arbeiteseinsatz (\\"Work Contribution\\") forced locals to work for the Germans, but work was often done slowly or intentionally badly ** Strikes and demonstrations ** Based on existing organizations, such as the churches, students, communists and doctors (professional resistance) * Armed ** raids on distribution offices to get food coupons or various documents such as Ausweise or on birth registry offices to get rid of information about Jews and others to whom the Nazis paid special attention ** temporary liberation of areas, such as in Yugoslavia, Paris, and northern Italy, occasionally in cooperation with the Allied forces ** uprisings such as in Warsaw in 1943 and 1944, and in extermination camps such as in Sobibor in 1943 and Auschwitz in 1944 ** continuing battle and guerrilla warfare, such as the partisans in the USSR and Yugoslavia and the Maquis in France * Espionage, including sending reports of military importance (e.g. troop movements, weather reports etc.) * Illegal press to counter Nazi propaganda * Anti-Nazi propaganda including movies for example anti-Nazi color film Calling Mr. Smith (1943) about current Nazi crimes in German-occupied Poland. * Covert listening to BBC broadcasts for news bulletins and coded messages * Political resistance to prepare for the reorganization after the war * Helping people to go into hiding (e.g., to escape the Arbeitseinsatz or deportation)—this was one of the main activities in the Netherlands, due to the large number of Jews and the high level of administration, which made it easy for the Germans to identify Jews. * Escape and evasion lines to help Allied military personnel caught behind Axis lines * Helping POWs with illegal supplies, breakouts, communication, etc. * Forgery of documents == Resistance operations == === 1939–1940 === Hubal and his unit in Poland in winter 1939 On the 15th of September 1939, a member of the Czech resistance movement, Ctibor Novák, planted explosive devices in Berlin. His first bomb detonated in front of the Ministry of aeronautics, and the second detonated in front of police headquarters. Both buildings were damaged and many Germans were injured. On the 28th of October 1939 (anniversary of the establishing of Czechoslovakia in 1918) large demonstrations against Nazi occupation took place in Prague. Approximately 100 000 Czechs were concerned. Demonstrators crowded the streets in the city. German police had to disperse the demonstrators and began shooting in the evening. The first victim was baker Václav Sedláček, who was shot dead. The second victim was student Jan Opletal, who was seriously injured. He later died on the 11th of November. Another 15 people were badly injured and hundreds of people sustained minor injuries. Approximately 400 people were arrested. In March 1940, a partisan unit of the first guerilla organization of the Second World War in Europe, led by Major Henryk Dobrzański (Hubal) completely destroyed a battalion of German infantry in a skirmish near the Polish village of Huciska. A few days later in an ambush near the village of Szałasy it inflicted heavy casualties upon another German unit. As time progressed, resistance forces grew in size and number. To counter this threat, the German authorities formed a special 1,000 man-strong anti-partisan unit of combined SS-Wehrmacht forces, including a Panzer group. Although Dobrzański's unit never exceeded 300 men, the Germans fielded at least 8,000 men in the area to secure it.*Marek Szymanski: Oddzial majora Hubala, Warszawa 1999, *Aleksandra Ziolkowska-Boehm: Polish Hero Roman Rodziewicz Fate of a Hubal Soldier in Auschwitz, Buchenwald and Postwar England, Lexington Books, 2013, In 1940, Witold Pilecki, Polish resistance, presented to his superiors a plan to enter Germany's Auschwitz concentration camp, gather intelligence on the camp from the inside, and organize inmate resistance.Jozef Garlinski, Fighting Auschwitz: the Resistance Movement in the Concentration Camp, Fawcett, 1975, , reprinted by Time Life Education, 1993. The Home Army approved this plan, provided him with a false identity card, and on 19 September 1940, he deliberately went out during a street roundup in Warsaw-łapanka, and was caught by the Germans along with other civilians and sent to Auschwitz. In the camp he organized the underground organization Związek Organizacji Wojskowej (ZOW).Hershel Edelheit, History of the Holocaust: A Handbook and Dictionary, Westview Press, 1994, , Google Print, p.413 From October 1940, ZOW sent the first reports about the camp and its genocide to Home Army Headquarters in Warsaw through the resistance network organized in Auschwitz.Adam Cyra, Ochotnik do Auschwitz – Witold Pilecki 1901–1948 [\\"Volunteer for Auschwitz\\"], Oświęcim 2000. On the night of January 21–22, 1940, in the Soviet-occupied Podolian town of Czortków, the Czortków Uprising started. It was the first Polish uprising and the first anti-Soviet uprising of World War II. Anti-Soviet Poles, most of them teenagers from local high schools, stormed the local Red Army barracks and a prison, in order to release Polish soldiers kept there. 1940 was the year of establishing Warsaw Ghetto and infamous death camp Auschwitz-Birkenau by the German Nazis in occupied Poland. Among the many activities of Polish resistance and Polish people one was helping endangered Jews. Polish citizens have the world's highest count of individuals who have been recognized as Righteous Among the Nations by Yad Vashem as non-Jews who risked their lives to save Jews from extermination during the Holocaust. One of the events that helped the growth of the French Resistance was the targeting of the French Jews, Communists, Gypsies, homosexuals, Catholics, and others, forcing many into hiding. This in turn gave the French Resistance new people to incorporate into their political structures. Around May 1940, a resistance group formed around the Austrian priest Heinrich Maier, who until 1944 very successfully passed on the plans and production locations for V-2 rockets, Tiger tanks or airplanes (Messerschmitt Bf 109, Messerschmitt Me 163 Komet, etc.) to the Allies, so that they could destroy these important factories in a targeted manner and on the other hand, for the after the war Central European states planned. Very early on they passed on information about the mass murder of the Jews to the Allies.Elisabeth Boeckl-Klamper, Thomas Mang, Wolfgang Neugebauer: Gestapo- Leitstelle Wien 1938–1945.

The 'Special Operations Executive' SOE was a British World War II organisation. Following Cabinet approval, it was officially formed by Minister of Economic Warfare Hugh Dalton on 22 July 1940, to develop a spirit of resistance in the occupied countries and to prepare a fifth column of resistance fighters to engage in open opposition to the occupiers at such time that the United Kingdom was able to return to the continent. To aid in the transport of agents and the supply of the resistance fighters, a Royal Air Force Special Duty Service was developed. Whereas the SIS was primarily involved in espionage, the SOE and the resistance fighters were geared toward reconnaissance of German defenses and sabotage. In England the SOE was also involved in the formation of the Auxiliary Units, a top secret stay-behind resistance organisation which would have been activated in the event of a German invasion of Britain. The SOE operated in all countries or former countries occupied by or attacked by the Axis forces, except where demarcation lines were agreed with Britain's principal allies (the Soviet Union and the United States). After the war, the organisation was officially dissolved on 15 January 1946. === 1941 === In February 1941, the Dutch Communist Party organized a general strike in Amsterdam and surrounding cities, known as the February strike, in protest against anti-Jewish measures by the Nazi occupying force and violence by fascist street fighters against Jews. Several hundreds of thousands of people participated in the strike. The strike was put down by the Nazis and some participants were executed. In April 1941, the Liberation Front of the Slovene Nation was established in the Province of Ljubljana. Its armed wing were the Slovene Partisans. It represented both the working class and the Slovene ethnicity. From April 1941, Bureau of Information and Propaganda of the Union for Armed Struggle started in Poland Operation N headed by Tadeusz Żenczykowski. Action was complex of sabotage, subversion and black-propaganda activities carried out by the Polish resistance against Nazi German occupation forces during World War IIHalina Auderska, Zygmunt Ziółek, Akcja N. Wspomnienia 1939–1945 (Action N. Memoirs 1939–1945), Wydawnictwo Czytelnik, Warszawa, 1972 Beginning in March 1941, Witold Pilecki's reports were being forwarded via the Polish resistance to the Polish government in exile and through it, to the British government in London and other Allied governments. These reports were the first information about the Holocaust and the principal source of intelligence on Auschwitz for the Western Allies.Norman Davies, Europe: A History, Oxford University Presse, 1996, ISBN In May 1941, the Resistance Team \\"Elevtheria\\" (Freedom) was established in Thessaloniki by politicians Paraskevas Barbas, Apostolos Tzanis, Ioannis Passalidis, Simos Kerasidis, Athanasios Fidas, Ioannis Evthimiadis and military officer Dimitrios Psarros. Its armed wing concluded two armed forces; Athanasios Diakos with armed action in Kroussia, with Christodoulos Moschos (captain \\"Petros\\") as leader, and Odysseas Androutsos with armed action in Visaltia, with Athanasios Genios (captain \\"Lassanis\\") as leader.newspaper Αυγή (Avgi), article: 68 years from the liberation of Thessaloniki from the nazisnewspaper Πρώτη Σελίδα (Proti Selida), article: 11th Reunion of Kilkisiotes, The Kilkisiotes of Athens honored the Holocaust of Kroussia newspaper Ριζοσπάστης (Rizospastis), article: The murder of the members of the Macedonian Bureau of the Communist Party of Greece The first anti-soviet uprising during World War II began on June 22, 1941 (the start-date of Operation Barbarossa) in Lithuania. Also on June 22, 1941 as a reaction to Nazi invasion of USSR Sisak People's Liberation Partisan Detachment was formed in Croatia, near the town of Sisak. It was first armed Anti-Fascist partisan detachment in Croatia. Communist-initiated uprising against Axis started in Serbia on July 7, 1941., and six days later in Montenegro. The Republic of Užice (Ужичка република) was a short-lived liberated Yugoslav territory, the first part of occupied Europe to be liberated. Organized as a military mini- state it existed throughout the autumn of 1941 in the western part of Serbia. The Republic was established by the Partisan resistance movement and its administrative center was in the town of Užice. The government was made of \\"people's councils\\" ('), and the Communists opened schools and published a newspaper, Borba (meaning \\"Struggle\\"). They even managed to run a postal system and around of railway and operated an ammunition factory from the vaults beneath the bank in Užice. In July 1941 Mieczysław Słowikowski (using the codename \\"Rygor\\"—Polish for \\"Rigor\\") set up \\"Agency Africa,\\" one of World War II's most successful intelligence organizations.Tessa Stirling et al., Intelligence Co-operation between Poland and Great Britain during World War II, vol. I: The Report of the Anglo-Polish Historical Committee, London, Vallentine Mitchell, 2005 His Polish allies in these endeavors included Lt. Col. Gwido Langer and Major Maksymilian Ciężki. The information gathered by the Agency was used by the Americans and British in planning the amphibious November 1942 Operation TorchMajor General Rygor Slowikowski, \\"In the secret service – The lightning of the Torch\\", The Windrush Press, London 1988, s. 285 landings in North Africa. On 13 July 1941, in Italian-occupied Montenegro, Montenegrin separatist Sekula Drljević proclaimed an independent Kingdom of Montenegro as an Italian governorate, upon which a nationwide rebellion escalated raised by Partisans, Yugoslav Royal officers and various other armed personnel. It was the first organized armed uprising in then occupied Europe, and involved 32,000 people. Most of Montenegro was quickly liberated, except major cities where Italian forces were well fortified. On 12 August — after a major Italian offensive involving 5 divisions and 30,000 soldiers — the uprising collapsed as units were disintegrating; poor leadership occurred as well as collaboration. The final toll of July 13 uprising in Montenegro was 735 dead, 1120 wounded and 2070 captured Italians and 72 dead and 53 wounded Montenegrins. The Battle of Loznica, 31 August 1941, Chetniks attacked and freed the town of Loznica in Serbia from the Germans. Several Germans were killed and wounded; 93 were captured. On 11 October 1941, in Bulgarian- occupied Prilep, Macedonians attacked post of the Bulgarian occupation police, which was the start of Macedonian resistance against the fascists who occupied Macedonia: Germans, Italians, Bulgarians and Albanians. The resistance finished successfully in August–November 1944 when the independent Macedonian state was formed, which was later added to the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia. During the time within which Hitler gave his anti-resistance Nacht und Nebel decree – made on the very day of the Attack on Pearl Harbor in the Pacific – the planning for Britain's Operation Anthropoid was underway, as a resistance move during World War II to assassinate Reinhard Heydrich, the Deputy Protector of Bohemia and Moravia and the chief of the Final Solution, by the Czech resistance in Prague. Over fifteen thousand Czechs were killed in reprisals, with the most infamous incidents being the complete destruction of the towns of Lidice and Ležáky. === 1942 === On February 16, 1942, the Greek Communist Party (KKE)-led National Liberation Front gave permission to a communist veteran, Athanasios (Thanasis) Klaras (later known as Aris Velouchiotis) to examine the possibilities of an armed resistance movement, which led to the formation of the Greek People's Liberation Army (ELAS). ELAS initiated actions against the German and Italian forces of occupation in Greece on 7 June 1942. The ELAS grew to become the largest resistance movement against the fascists in Greece. The Luxembourgish general strike of 1942 was a passive resistance movement organised within a short time period to protest against a directive that incorporated the Luxembourg youth into the Wehrmacht. A national general strike, originating mainly in Wiltz, paralysed the country and forced the occupying German authorities to respond violently by sentencing 21 strikers to death. On 27 May 1942 Operation Anthropoid took place. Two armed Czechoslovak members of the army in exile ( Jan Kubiš and Jozef Gabčík ) attempted to assassinate the SS-obergruppenführer Reinhard Heydrich. Heydrich was not killed on the spot but died later at the hospital from his wounds. He is the highest ranked Nazi to have been assassinated during the war. In September 1942, \\"The Council to Aid Jews Żegota\\" was founded by Zofia Kossak- Szczucka and Wanda Krahelska-Filipowicz (\\"Alinka\\") and made up of Polish Democrats as well as other Catholic activists. Poland was the only country in occupied Europe where there existed such a dedicated secret organization. Half of the Jews who survived the war (thus over 50,000) were aided in some shape or form by Żegota. The most known activist of Żegota was Irena Sendler head of the children's division who saved 2,500 Jewish children by smuggling them out of the Warsaw Ghetto, providing them false documents, and sheltering them in individual and group children's homes outside the Ghetto. On the night of 7–8 October 1942, Operation Wieniec started. It targeted rail infrastructure near Warsaw. Similar operations aimed at disrupting German transport and communication in occupied Poland occurred in the coming months and years. It targeted railroads, bridges and supply depots, primarily near transport hubs such as Warsaw and Lublin. On 25 November, Greek guerrillas with the help of twelve British saboteursChristopher M. Woodhouse, \\"The struggle for Greece, 1941–1949\\", Hart-Davis Mc-Gibbon, 1977, Google print, p.37 carried out a successful operation which disrupted the German ammunition transportation to the German Africa Corps under Rommel—the destruction of Gorgopotamos bridge (Operation Harling).Richard Clogg, \\"A Short History of Modern Greece\\", Cambridge University Press, 1979 Google print, pp.142-143Procopis Papastratis, \\"British policy towards Greece during the Second World War, 1941-1944\\", Cambridge University Press, 1984 Google print, p.129 On 20 June 1942, the most spectacular escape from Auschwitz concentration camp took place.

They drove out the main gate in a stolen Rudolf Hoss automobile Steyr 220 with a smuggled report from Witold Pilecki about the Holocaust. The Germans never recaptured any of them.En.auschwitz.org The Zamość Uprising was an armed uprising of Armia Krajowa and Bataliony Chłopskie against the forced expulsion of Poles from the Zamość region (Zamość Lands, Zamojszczyzna) under the Nazi Generalplan Ost. Nazi Germans attempting to remove the local Poles from the Greater Zamosc area (through forced removal, transfer to forced labor camps, or, in rare cases, mass murder) to get it ready for German colonization. It lasted from 1942 to 1944, and despite heavy casualties suffered by the Underground, the Germans failed. === 1943 === Belorussia, 1943. A Jewish partisan group of the Chkalov Brigade. Soviet partisan fighters behind German front lines in Belarus, 1943. In early January 1943, the 20,000 strong main operational group of the Yugoslav Partisans, stationed in western Bosnia, came under ferocious attack by over 150,000 German and Axis troops, supported by about 200 Luftwaffe aircraft in what became known as the Battle of the Neretva (the German codename was \\"Fall Weiss\\" or \\"Case White\\").Operation WEISS – The Battle of Neretva The Axis rallied eleven divisions, six German, three Italian, and two divisions of the Independent State of Croatia (supported by Ustaše formations) as well as a number of Chetnik brigades.Battles & Campaigns during World War 2 in Yugoslavia The goal was to destroy the Partisan HQ and main field hospital (all Partisan wounded and prisoners faced certain execution), but this was thwarted by the diversion and retreat across the Neretva river, planned by the Partisan supreme command led by Marshal Josip Broz Tito. The main Partisan force escaped into Serbia. On 19 April 1943, three members of the Belgian resistance movement were able to stop the Twentieth convoy, which was the 20th prisoner transport in Belgium organised by the Germans during World War II. The exceptional action by members of the Belgian resistance occurred to free Jewish and Romani (\\"Gypsy\\") civilians who were being transported by train from the Dossin army base located in Mechelen, Belgium to the concentration camp Auschwitz. The 20th train convoy transported 1,631 Jews (men, women and children). Some of the prisoners were able to escape and marked this particular kind of liberation action by the Belgian resistance movement as unique in the European history of the Holocaust. In October 1943, the rescue of the Danish Jews meant that nearly all of the Danish Jews were saved from KZ camps by the Danish resistance. This action is considered one of the bravest and most significant displays of public defiance against the Nazis. However, the action was largely due to the personal intervention of German diplomat Georg Ferdinand Duckwitz, who both leaked news of the intended round up of the Jews to both the Danish opposition and Jewish groups and negotiated with the Swedes to ensure Danish Jews would be accepted in Sweden. The Battle of Sutjeska from 15 May-16 June 1943 was a joint attack of the Axis forces that once again attempted to destroy the main Yugoslav Partisan force, near the Sutjeska river in southeastern Bosnia. The Axis rallied 127,000 troops for the offensive, including German, Italian, NDH, Bulgarian and Cossack units, as well as over 300 airplanes (under German operational command), against 18,000 soldiers of the primary Yugoslav Partisans operational group organised in 16 brigades. Facing almost exclusively German troops in the final encirclement, the Yugoslav Partisans finally succeeded in breaking out across the Sutjeska river through the lines of the German 118th Jäger Division, 104th Jäger Division and 369th (Croatian) Infantry Division in the northwestern direction, towards eastern Bosnia. Three brigades and the central hospital with over 2,000 wounded remained surrounded and, following Hitler's instructions, German commander-in-chief General Alexander Löhr ordered and carried out their annihilation, including the wounded and unarmed medical personnel. In addition, Partisan troops suffered from a severe lack of food and medical supplies, and many were struck down by typhoid. However, the failure of the offensive marked a turning point for Yugoslavia during World War II. Operation Heads started—an action of serial assassinations of the Nazi personnel sentenced to death by the Special Courts for crimes against Polish citizens in occupied Poland. The Resistance fighters of Polish Home Army's unit Agat kill Franz Bürkl during Operation Bürkl in 1943, and Franz Kutschera during Operation Kutschera in 1944. Both men were high-ranking Nazi German SS and secret police officers responsible for the murder and brutal interrogation of thousands of Polish Jews and Polish resistance fighters and supporters. The Warsaw Ghetto Uprising lasted from 19 April-16 May, and cost the Nazi forces 17 dead and 93 wounded. On 30 September the German forces occupying the Italian city of Naples were forced out by the townsfolk and the Italian Resistance before the arrival of the first Allied forces in the city on 1 October. This popular uprising is known as the Four days of Naples.Barbagallo, Corrado, Napoli contro il terrore nazista. Maone, Naples. On October 9, 1943, the Kinabalu guerillas launched the Jesselton Revolt against the Japanese occupation of British Borneo. From November 1943, Operation Most III started. The Armia Krajowa provided the Allies with crucial intelligence on the German V-2 rocket. In effect, some of the most important parts of the captured V-2, as well as the final report, analyses, sketches and photos, were transported to Brindisi by a Royal Air Force Douglas Dakota aircraft. In late July 1944, the V-2 parts were delivered to London.Ordway, Frederick I., III. The Rocket Team.

The operation was led by Major Patrick Leigh Fermor, together with Captain W. Stanley Moss, Greek SOE agents and Cretan resistance fighters. However, Müller left the island before the plan could be carried out. Undeterred, Fermor decided to abduct General Heinrich Kreipe instead. On the night of 26 April, General Kreipe left his headquarters in Archanes and headed without escort to his well-guarded residence, \\"Villa Ariadni\\", approximately 25 km outside Heraklion. Major Fermor and Captain Moss, dressed as German military policemen, waited for him before his residence. They asked the driver to stop and asked for their papers. As soon as the car stopped, Fermor quickly opened Kreipe's door, rushed in and threatened him with his guns while Moss took the driver's seat. After driving some distance the British left the car, with suitable decoy material being planted that suggesting an escape off the island had been made by submarine, and with the General began a cross-country march. Hunted by German patrols, the group moved across the mountains to reach the southern side of the island, where a British Motor Launch (ML 842, commanded by Brian Coleman) was to pick them up. Eventually, on 14 May 1944, they were picked up (from Peristeres beach near Rhodakino) and transferred to Egypt. In April–May 1944, the SS launched the daring airborne Raid on Drvar aimed at capturing Marshal Josip Broz Tito, the commander-in-chief of the Yugoslav Partisans, as well as disrupting their leadership and command structure. The Partisan headquarters were in the hills near Drvar, Bosnia at the time. The representatives of the Allies, Britain's Randolph Churchill and Evelyn Waugh, were also present. Elite German SS parachute commando units fought their way to Tito's cave headquarters and exchanged heavy gunfire resulting in numerous casualties on both sides.pp. 343-376, Eyre Chetniks under Draža Mihailović also flocked to the firefight in their own attempt to capture Tito. By the time German forces had penetrated to the cave, however, Tito had already fled the scene. He had a train waiting for him that took him to the town of Jajce. It would appear that Tito and his staff were well prepared for emergencies. The commandos were only able to retrieve Tito’s marshal's uniform, which was later displayed in Vienna. After fierce fighting in and around the village cemetery, the Germans were able to link up with mountain troops. By that time, Tito, his British guests and Partisan survivors were fêted aboard the Royal Navy destroyer and her captain Lt. Carson, RN. An intricate series of resistance operations were launched in France prior to, and during, Operation Overlord. On June 5, 1944, the BBC broadcast a group of unusual sentences, which the Germans knew were code words—possibly for the invasion of Normandy. The BBC would regularly transmit hundreds of personal messages, of which only a few were really significant. A few days before D-Day, the commanding officers of the Resistance heard the first line of Verlaine's poem, \\"Chanson d'automne\\", \\"Les sanglots longs des violons de l'automne\\" (Long sobs of autumn violins) which meant that the \\"day\\" was imminent. When the second line \\"Blessent mon cœur d'une langueur monotone\\" (wound my heart with a monotonous langour) was heard, the Resistance knew that the invasion would take place within the next 48 hours. They then knew it was time to go about their respective pre-assigned missions. All over France resistance groups had been coordinated, and various groups throughout the country increased their sabotage. Communications were cut, trains derailed, roads, water towers and ammunition depots destroyed and German garrisons were attacked. Some relayed info about German defensive positions on the beaches of Normandy to American and British commanders by radio, just prior to 6 June. Victory did not come easily; in June and July, in the Vercors plateau a newly reinforced maquis group fought more than 10,000 German soldiers (no Waffen-SS) under General Karl Pflaum and was defeated, with 840 casualties (639 fighters and 201 civilians). Following the Tulle Murders, Major Otto Diekmann's Waffen- SS company wiped out the village of Oradour-sur-Glane on 10 June. The resistance also assisted the later Allied invasion in the south of France (Operation Dragoon). They started insurrections in cities such as Paris when allied forces came close. Operation Halyard, which took place between August and December 1944, was an Allied airlift operation behind enemy lines during World War II conducted by Chetniks in occupied Yugoslavia. In July 1944, the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) drew up plans to send a team to Chetniks led by General Draža Mihailović in the German-occupied Territory of the Military Commander in Serbia for the purpose of evacuating Allied airmen shot down over that area. This team, known as the Halyard team, was commanded by Lieutenant George Musulin, along with Master Sergeant Michael Rajacich, and Specialist Arthur Jibilian, the radio operator. The team was detailed to the United States Fifteenth Air Force and designated as the 1st Air Crew Rescue Unit.Ford (1992), p. 100 It was the largest rescue operation of American Airmen in history. According to historian Professor Jozo Tomasevich, a report submitted to the OSS showed that 417Tomasevich (1975), p. 378 Allied airmen who had been downed over occupied Yugoslavia were rescued by Mihailović's Chetniks,Leary (1995), p. 32 and airlifted out by the Fifteenth Air Force.Leary (1995), p. 30 According to Lt. Cmdr. Richard M. Kelly (OSS) grand total of 432 U.S. and 80 Allied personnel were airlifted during the Halyard Mission.Kelly (1946), p. 62 Operation Tempest launched in Poland in 1944 would lead to several major actions by Armia Krajowa, most notable of them being the Warsaw Uprising that took place in between August 1 and October 2, and failed due to the Soviet refusal, due to differences in ideology, to help; another one was Operation Ostra Brama: the Armia Krajowa or Home Army turned the weapons given to them by the Nazi Germans (in hope that they would fight the incoming Soviets) against the nazi Germans—in the end the Home Army together with the Soviet troops took over the Greater Vilnius area to the dismay of the Lithuanians. On 25 June 1944, the Battle of Osuchy started—one of the largest battles between the Polish resistance and Nazi Germany in occupied Poland during World War II, essentially a continuation of the Zamosc Uprising.Martin Gilbert, Second World War A Complete History, Holt Paperbacks, 2004, , Google Print, p.542 During Operation Most III, in 1944, the Polish Home Army or Armia Krajowa provided the British with the parts of the V-2 rocket. Norwegian sabotages of the German nuclear program drew to a close after three years on 20 February 1944, with the saboteur bombing of the ferry SF Hydro. The ferry was to carry railway cars with heavy water drums from the Vemork hydroelectric plant, where they were produced, across Lake Tinn so they could be shipped to Germany. Its sinking effectively ended Nazi nuclear ambitions. The series of raids on the plant was later dubbed by the British SOE as the most successful act of sabotage in all of World War II, and was used as a basis for the US war movie The Heroes of Telemark. As an initiation of their uprising, Slovakian rebels entered Banská Bystrica on the morning of 30 August 1944, the second day of the rebellion, and made it their headquarters. By 10 September, the insurgents gained control of large areas of central and eastern Slovakia. That included two captured airfields. As a result of the two-week-old insurgency, the Soviet Air Force was able to begin flying in equipment to Slovakian and Soviet partisans. == Resistance movements during World War II == * British

The confusion often stems from the fact that as war progressed, some resistance movements grew larger – and other diminished. In particular, Polish and Soviet territories were mostly freed from Nazi German control in the years 1944–1945, eliminating the need for their respective (anti-Nazi) partisan forces (in Poland, cursed soldiers continued to fight against the Soviets). Fighting in Yugoslavia, however, with Yugoslavian partisans fighting German units, continued till the end of the war. The numbers for each of those three movements can be roughly estimated as approaching 100,000 in 1941, and 200,000 in 1942, with Polish and Soviet partisan numbers peaking around 1944 at 350,000-400,000, and Yugoslavian, growing till the very end till they reached the 800,000. Several sources note that Polish Armia Krajowa was the largest resistance movement in Nazi-occupied Europe. For example, Norman Davies wrote \\"Armia Krajowa (Home Army), the AK, which could fairly claim to be the largest of European resistance\\";Norman Davies, God's Playground: A History of Poland, Columbia University Press, 2005, , Google Print p.344 Gregor Dallas wrote \\"Home Army (Armia Krajowa or AK) in late 1943 numbered around 400,000, making it the largest resistance organization in Europe\\"; Mark Wyman wrote \\"Armia Krajowa was considered the largest underground resistance unit in wartime Europe\\".Mark Wyman, DPs: Europe's Displaced Persons, 1945-1951, Cornell University Press, 1998, , Google Print, p.34 Certainly, Polish resistance was the largest resistance till German invasion of Yugoslavia and invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941. After that point, the numbers of Soviet partisans and Yugoslav partisans begun growing rapidly. The numbers of Soviet partisans quickly caught up and were very similar to that of the Polish resistance (a graph is also available here).See for example: Leonid D. Grenkevich in The Soviet Partisan Movement, 1941-44: A Critical Historiographical Analysis, p.229 or Walter Laqueur in The Guerilla Reader: A Historical Anthology, (New York, Charles Scribiner, 1990, p.233. The numbers of Tito's Yugoslav partisans were roughly similar to those of the Polish and Soviet partisans in the first years of the war (1941–1942), but grew rapidly in the latter years, outnumbering the Polish and Soviet partisans by 2:1 or more (estimates give Yugoslavian forces about 800,000 in 1945, to Polish and Soviet forces of 400,000 in 1944).Anna M. Cienciala, The coming of the War and Eastern Europe in World War II., History 557 Lecture Notes Some authors also call it the largest resistance movement in Nazi-occupied Europe, for example, Kathleen Malley-Morrison wrote: \\"The Yugoslav partisan guerrilla campaign, which developed into the largest resistance army in occupied Western and Central Europe...\\". The numbers of French resistance were smaller, around 10,000 in 1942, and swelling to 200,000 by 1944. ==References== == External links == *Jewish Armed Resistance and Rebellions on the Yad Vashem website * Home of the British Resistance Movement * European Resistance Archive * Interviews from the Underground Eyewitness accounts of Russia's Jewish resistance during World War II; website & documentary film. * Serials and Miscellaneous Publications of the Underground Movements in Europe During World War II, 1936-1945 From the Rare Book and Special Collections Division at the Library of Congress * Underground Movement Collection From the Rare Book and Special Collections Division at the Library of Congress * * ","title":"Resistance during World War II"},{"id":"2544875","text":"\\"Be My Love\\" is a popular song with lyrics by Sammy Cahn and music by Nicholas Brodszky.

Wamba (Medieval Latin: VVamba, Vamba, Wamba; 643 – 687/688) was the king of the Visigoths from 672 to 680. During his reign, the Visigothic kingdom encompassed all of Hispania and part of southern Gaul known as Septimania. According to Herwig Wolfram, Wamba means \\"big paunch\\" in Gothic (like German: \\"Wampe\\", cognate to English \\"womb\\") and may have been a nickname.History of the Goths, trans. Thomas J. Dunlap (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1988), p. 463 n. 326 Both Julian of Toledo in his Historia Wambae (History of Wamba) and the decisions of the eleventh Council of Toledo, held under Wamba's auspices, only refer to the king as Wamba. ==History== ===Military events=== Statue in Madrid (A. Carnicero, 1750–53). After ascending the throne on 1 September 672, Wamba faced a revolt from Hilderic, governor of Nîmes, who had himself aspired to the kingship. Hilderic was supported by Gunhild, Bishop of Maguelonne. Wamba sent the dux (general) Paul to put down the rebels, but upon his arrival at Narbonne, he induced his officers to renounce their loyalty to Wamba and elect him king as Flavius Paulus. He was joined by Hilderic and his followers, as well as Duke Ranosindus of Tarraconensis and the gardingatus (a palace official) Hildigisus. Paul recruited \\"multitudes\\" of Franks and Basques to bolster his forces.Historia Wambae Regis auctore Juliano episcopo Toletano, in Monumenta Germaniae Historica, Scriptorum rerum Merovingicarum tomus V, Passiones Vitaeque Sanctorum Aevi Merovingici, pp. 504–07. Following this the Visigothic cities in Gaul and a large part of northeastern Hispania came over to Paul's side.Bishop Julian of Toledo, in his History of King Wamba, accuses Paul of crowning himself with a votive crown King Reccared (the king who converted the Visigoths from Arianism to Catholicism) had dedicated to the body of St. Felix in Girona. Historia Wambae Regis in MGH, Scriptorum rerum Merovingicarum t. V, p. 522. During these events, Wamba was in Cantabria campaigning against the Basques.Historia Wambae Regis in MGH, Scriptorum rerum Merovingicarum t. V, p. 507. Roger Collins, The Basques (2nd ed., 1990, Blackwell: Cambridge, Mass.) points out that \\"there exists a measure of looseness about the use of the name of Cantabria\\" both before and after Wamba's time, so it could include a wider area than at present. See Collins, pp. 92–93, 138–39. In response, Wamba marched into the Tarraconensis region, and in a few days turned most of the cities back to his side. He then divided his forces into three groups, attacking over the Pyrenees by way of Llívia (then the capital of Cerdanya), Auch, and the coastal road, taking the fortresses of Collioure, Vulturaria, and Llívia, finding \\"much\\" gold and silver there.Historia Wambae Regis in MGH, Scriptorum rerum Merovingicarum t. V, pp. 509–11. As Wamba moved on Narbonne, Paul placed General Wittimer in charge of the city and retired to Nîmes. Wamba's forces quickly subdued Narbonne and then, after some difficulty, secured the surrender of Nîmes on September 3, 673. Paul and the other rebel leaders surrendered and, three days later, were brought to trial, scalped, and imprisoned for life. A period of peace followed and, in 674, Wamba rebuilt the Roman walls around Toledo. He also fortified other sites about this time, possibly Hondarribia (Fuenterrabia), Santiago Sanchez, Alberto Zulueta & Javier Barrallo: CAAD and Historical Buildings: The Importance of the Simulation of the Historical Process The University of the Basque Country, 2009 a small village in Spain facing the French border over the Txingurri bay, as a military thrust along the Bay of Biscay up to the Pyrenees is attested to in contemporary sources. Wamba brought the Astures and Ruccones (Luggones) under his control and incorporated them into a new province. They had been fighting for their independence since the Visigothic invasions of the 5th century but now finally relented. After the rebellion, the kingdom faced a new threat in the form of Saracen raiders. In the Chronicle of Alfonso III (written 200 years later) it stated, \\"In Wamba's time, 270 Saracen ships attacked the coast of Hispania and there all of them were burned.\\" A single attack of this size is doubtful, however, because no other source mentions it. The Chronicle of 754 declared Moors \\"had long been raiding\\" Andalusia \\"and simultaneously devastating many cities\\"; however, the Chronicle of 754s most recent English translator, Kenneth Baxter Wolf, holds that this refers to the year before the defeat of King Roderic by the Moors, over three decades after the removal of Wamba.Kenneth Baxter Wolf, tr., Conquerors and Chroniclers of Early Medieval Spain, 2nd edition, Liverpool University Press, 1999, p. 131. The Chronicle of 754 mentions Wamba's building projects in Toledo and the Eleventh Council of Toledo, but does not identify any Muslim raids in his time. The law books and decrees of the time reveal a substantial erosion of domestic tranquility and order within the kingdom. In the Visigothic law books, Wamba decrees that all the people, regardless of their religion, and even if they are clergy, are required to defend the kingdom if it is attacked by a foreign foe. This law was created to solve a problem of desertion: \\"For, whenever an enemy invades the provinces of our kingdom … [many of] those who inhabit the border … disappear so that, by this means, there is no mutual support in battle.\\" This rationale may imply a frequency of raids. That the people were often unwilling to defend the kingdom is further shown by another of Wamba's edicts, in which slaves were freed in order to the fill the ranks of the army. This suggests not only a shortage of volunteers from among the Hispano-Romans who made up the bulk of the population ruled by the Visigothic lords, but also an army heavy in conscripts and the coerced. ===Religious events=== In 675, the Third Council of Braga was held in Braga (Bracara), Hispania. This Catholic conclave promulgated eight decrees affecting ritual, the handling of sacred vessels, who may or may not live with a priest, unacceptable forms of punishment of clergy, and unacceptable forms of payment of clergy and rectors. In the same year, the Eleventh Council of Toledo was convened in November. Wamba renouncing the Crown. Oil on canvas by Juan Antonio de Ribera (1819) Wamba was a reformist king who, according to Charles Julian Bishko, \\"tried to set up at Aquis (Chaves) in Lusitania a monastic see of the same type as Dume–Braga, i. e., involving the sort of episcopus sub regula associated with early pactualism. This manoeuvre was successfully blocked by the metropolitan church of Emérita with the full support of the fathers of the XIIth Council of Toledo (681).\\"Charles Julian Bishko. Spanish and Portuguese Monastic History 600–1300. IV, Portuguese Pactual Monasticism in the Eleventh Century: The Case of Sao Salvador De Vacariça. (Published originally in Estudos de Història de Portugal: Homenagen a A.H. de Oliveira Margues (Lisbon: Editorial Estampa, 1982); reprinted with permission). The Library of Iberian Resources Online. Retrieved 11 September 2014. ===Succession=== In 680, Wamba fell ill or (according to the Chronicle of Alfonso III two hundred years later) was poisoned in Pampliega, near Burgos. He received the order of penance in anticipation of his death, and as a result was forced to step down as king upon his recovery. The Chronicle of Alfonso III blames Wamba's successor Erwig for this; some modern commentators have blamed Julian of Toledo, who was made primate of the Visigothic church by Erwig (in reward for his services?).See Wolf, tr., Conquerors and Chroniclers, pp. 162–63; Roger Collins, Early Medieval Spain; Unity in Diversity, 400–1000, 2nd edition, New York: St. Martin's Press, 1995, pp. 77–78, regards this as \\"quite unnecessarily Machiavellian.\\" But Julian perpetuated the memory of Wamba in his account of the revolt of Paul, Historia Wambae Regís. ==Legend== ===Birthplace=== According to one tradition, Wamba was born in Egitânia, a modest village surrounded by Roman walls that is today called Idanha-a-Velha, and located to the northeast of Castelo Branco in Portugal. A Spanish tradition has him born in Galicia in the parish of Santa María de Dozón in an old house with a shield. Manuel de Sousa da Silva, a seventeenth-century Portuguese genealogist, in his work Nobiliário das Gerações de Entre-Douro-e- Minho, refers to this possibility, adding that he was of the lineage of the Gothic kings, but so poor that he was a farmer. Modern genealogists make him a son of Tulga, a possibility sustained by the fact of his being a humble man of royal descent, since his father was deposed at a young age, and when his own sons were still infants. The most famous tradition, however, has him born and raised in Pujerra (or Buxarra as it was once called) in the Málaga Province, an Andalusian mountain village, nestled amid forests of chestnut trees, near the Genal river in southern Spain. The ruins of Molino de Capilla (Mill of the Chapel) are nearby, and close to which lay the village of Cenay, which some consider to be Wamba's actual birthplace. ===Kingship=== The Election of Wamba as King. Oil on canvas by Francisco de Paula Van Halen (1843) There are at least two legends associated with how Wamba became king. One begins with Wamba's father, king of the Visigoths, who in this story was also named Wamba. Two women of his court, a servant girl and a noble lady, became pregnant at the same time. To avoid a scandal that might implicate the king, both women fled the capital. They found their way to an Andalusian village that, because it was so well hidden in the forest, provided an ideal place for secret births. Both women brought forth boys, and they were placed in the care of a servant girl to be raised in the area. When the time came to groom a successor for the king, there seemed to be no suitable heir. Soldiers were dispatched to the village to find the illegitimate children. After their arrival, they overheard a peasant woman call to her son named Wamba, who was tending cattle with a stick. The soldiers knew they had come upon the youth they sought and declared: \\"You are the rightful king and we must ask you to come with us to the palace.\\" Wamba was unwilling, or at least pretended to be. He took his stick and thrust it into the ground, saying, \\"I will only accept the throne if this stick takes root.\\" The stick he carried was of chopo or black poplar, which easily takes root in fertile soil. When it began to grow, Wamba agreed to go with the soldiers to become the new king of the Visigoths, being elected and crowned in what is today the tiny village of Wamba in the region around Madrid. A second legend is related by Charles Morris in Historical Tales, the Romance of Reality: Spanish (\\"The Good King Wamba\\"). In this version, instead of being a boy, Wamba was an old man in the village, and owned land and possessions there. The year was 672. > In those days, when a king died and left no son, the Goths elected a new > one, seeking their best and worthiest, and holding the election in the place > where the old king had died. It was in the little village of Gerticos, some > eight miles from the city of Valladolid, that King Recesuinto [a.k.a. > Recceswinth] had sought health and found death. Hither came the electors—the > great nobles, the bishops, and the generals—and here they debated who should > be king. . . . Saint Leo, declaring he had been given divine guidance, instructed the electors to seek out a husbandman named Wamba. So scouts were dispersed throughout the land until, at length, Wamba was found tilling one of his fields. \\"Leave your plough in the furrow\\", they said to him; \\"nobler work awaits you. You have been elected king of Hispania.\\" \\"There is no nobler work\\", answered Wamba. \\"Seek elsewhere your monarch. I prefer to rule over my fields.\\" The astonished heralds knew not what to make of this. To them the man who would not be king must be a saint—or an idiot. They reasoned, begged, implored, until Wamba, anxious to get rid of them, said: \\"I will accept the crown when the dry rod in my hand grows green again—and not till then.\\" After he thrust it into the ground, all were astonished to see it suddenly become a green plant with leaves growing out of the top. Heaven had decided the matter. So Wamba \\"went with the heralds to the electoral congress\\". Once there, however, he again tried to refuse the throne. At this, one of the Visigothic chieftains drew his sword and threatened to behead Wamba if he did not accept the crown. Wamba relented and consented. The legend of the stick thrust into the ground is also associated with the town of Guimarães, southwest of Braga in the Costa Verde of Portugal (the northwest corner of the country). There, because Wamba never withdrew the stick afterwards, it is said it grew into an olive tree. Though the tree is now gone, the site is marked either by the monastery of Nossa Senhora da Oliveira (Our Lady of the Olive) or the Largo da Oliveira town square, each named for the legendary tree. ===Saint Giles=== In a 10th-century Life of Saint Giles, written for the benefit of pilgrims, a legend is recorded about how, one day, when King Wamba (also known as Flavius) was out hunting in the forest between Arles and Nîmes in Provence, he began to pursue a hind (deer). The animal fled, seeking refuge in the cave where Giles the hermit was quietly praying. (In some versions of the story, the hind, provided by God, was Giles' sole companion and sustained him on its milk.) Wamba shot his arrow into the opening. But he missed the hind, striking Giles instead, wounding him in the leg and causing a permanent disability. The king's hunting dogs then rushed in for the kill. But when Wamba arrived he found his dogs miraculously rooted to the spot. Discovering what he had done, he begged forgiveness and tried to make amends. But Giles continued his prayers, refusing all help or recompense. The king nonetheless had doctors care for the wound. He also offered Giles the land upon which to build a monastery. But Giles refused. Over time, however, because of the saint's fame as a sage and miracle worker, multitudes gathered at his cave. Around 674, Wamba built them a monastery. Giles became its first abbot. Soon a little town grew up there, known as Saint-Gilles-du-Gard. Because of this tradition, Giles became the patron saint of cripples, lepers, and nursing mothers. His emblem is an arrow. The Catholic Encyclopedia notes that the king in this story must have originally been a Frank, \\"since the Franks had expelled the Visigoths from the neighbourhood of Nîmes almost a century and a half earlier\\". ===Loss of the crown=== Charles Morris writes that, during Wamba's reign: The tonsuring of king Wamba by Joan Brull. Oil on canvas (1894) > One ambitious noble named Paul, who thought it would be an easy thing to > take the throne from an old man who had shown so plainly that he did not > want it, rose in rebellion. He soon learned his mistake. Wamba met him in > battle, routed his army, and took him prisoner. Paul expected nothing less > than to have his head stricken off, but Wamba simply ordered that it should > be shaved. A shaved or tonsured head was the mark of one who had assumed monastic orders, which meant the man \\"could not serve as king or chieftain, but must spend the remainder of his days in seclusion as a monk\\". Later an ambitious youth named Erwig, pursuing the overthrow of the king, administered a sleeping potion. While Wamba was under, Erwig shaved the crown of his head. As before, Gothic law was clear. Wamba could no longer be king. So he accepted this change and happily became a monk, abdicating the throne on October 14, 680, to live out the last seven years of his life in seclusion from the world (dying in 687). Erwig became king in his place. :Thus it was that Wamba the husbandman first became king and afterwards monk. In all his stations—farmer, king, and monk—he acquitted himself well and worthily, and his name has come down to us from the mists of time as one of those rare men of whom we know little, but all that little good. Ironically, it was Wamba's nephew, son of his sister Ariberga, Ergica, who married Erwig's daughter and became the new king at his father in law's death. == Bibliography == * Charles Julian Bishko, \\"Portuguese Pactual Monasticism in the Eleventh Century: The Case of São Salvador De Vacariça\\", Estudos de História de Portugal: Homenagen a A.H. de Oliveira Margues (Lisbon: Editorial Estampa, 1982). * Henry Bradley, The Goths: from the Earliest Times to the End of the Gothic Dominion in Spain, chapter 33.

ErwigAlso spelled Ervig, or Herwig. (;For the imperial tradition behind this name, see Flavius. after 642 – 687) was a king of the Visigoths in Hispania (680–687). ==Parentage== According to the 9th-century Chronicle of Alfonso III, Erwig was the son of Ardabast, who had journeyed from the Byzantine Empire to Hispania during the time of Chindasuinth, and married Chindasuinth's niece Goda.Collins, Visigothic Spain, 102. Ardabast (or Artavasdos), was probably an Armenian or Persian Christian exile in Constantinople or in Byzantine Africa. In Hispania he was made a count.Livermore, Twilight of the Goths, 76. 17th-century Spanish genealogist Luis de Salazar y Castro gave Ardabast's father as Athanagild, the son of Saint Hermenegild and Ingund, and his mother as Flavia Juliana, a daughter of Peter Augustus and niece of the Emperor Maurice.Luis de Salazar y Castro, Historia Genealógica de la Casa de Lara (Madrid, 1696) vol. I, p. 45. This imperial connection is disputed by Christian Settipani, who says that the only source for Athanagild's marriage to Flavia Julia is José Pellicer, who he claims to be a forger.Christian Settipani, Les ancêtres de Charlemagne, p. 431. == Succession == After his predecessor Wamba had taken the monastic habit while on the verge of death, he was forced to retire from the kingship on 14 October 680, even though he recovered, and enter a monastery. He appointed Erwig his successor and the latter was anointed in Toledo on 31 October 680. Later, 9th-century legends attributed to Erwig the poisoning of the king, who was made a penitent by his supporters while Erwig's supporters raised him to the throne. The bishops of the Twelfth Council of Toledo, which Erwig opened on 9 January 681, confirmed that the documents of abdication and confirmation of Erwig from Wamba were authentic and contained his own signature. Nonetheless, some historians have seen in the rapidity of Erwig's unction after the king had received the penitential sacrament evidence for a pre- planned palace coup.Collins, Visigothic Spain, 98. Erwig began his reign in a climate of uneasiness concerning the way in which he reached the throne. Probably feeling insecure himself, the nobles and bishops took advantage. Erwig restored to favour those who had been out of it in the time of Wamba. After the Twelfth Council, the Thirteenth (683) and Fourteenth (684) followed in quick succession. The councils confirmed Erwig's legitimacy for a second time and wrote many laws to protect the life and rule of the king and his family, including that of his queen, Liuvigoto.Collins, Visigothic Spain, 104. After falling seriously ill, Erwig proclaimed his son-in-law Ergica, the husband of his daughter Cixilo,Also spelled Cixilona, Cioxillo, or Cixila, she married around 670. She was Erwig's daughter by his wife Liuvigoto (born c.620), daughter of Suintila and Theodora. as his heir on 14 November 687 and retired to a monastery as a penitent the next day, after giving leave to his court to return to Toledo with Egica for the anointing and crowning.Collins, Visigothic Spain, 105. == Legislation == Erwig issued 28 laws condemning Jews with the support of the Twelfth Council. He himself stated to the council his desire to return to the legislation of the reign of Sisebut, though he was a little more lenient, dispensing with the death penalty.Murphy, Julian of Toledo, 13. These laws were part of a revised and expanded version of the Liber Iudiciorum which is attached to Erwig's name. All of the laws, which dealt with Jews, have been attributed to the influence of Julian of Toledo, the fanatically anti-Jewish archbishop of Toledo.Collins, Visigothic Spain, 236. When the Ervigian code was promulgated in November 681, Erwig had added six more of his own new laws and three laws of Wamba, as well as revised eighty laws of Recceswinth. There is no evidence, however, that the Ervigian code \\"superseded\\" the Recceswinthian and manuscripts of both continued to be produced and sold. Declaring them a plague on the kingdom, he called for the total removal of the Jews from the kingdom. Such a decree had been issued by Erwig's predecessor Wamba and much as that one Erwig's also failed. So in 681 he issued another decree, this time requiring that all Jews become Christians or leave the kingdom. Jews were officially discriminated against from henceforth as the monarchy attempted to restrict Jewish commercial activities. == Sources == * Collins, Roger. Visigothic Spain, 409–711.

It was the band's first major-label release. Music videos were filmed for the singles \\"On a Rope,\\" \\"Born in '69\\" and \\"Young Livers,\\" and the band embarked on extensive tours of the US, UK and Europe. They experienced a surge of popularity in the UK, where \\"On a Rope\\" entered the music charts at #12 and was a hit on MTV Europe, earning them rave reviews in New Musical Express and allowing them to play Top of the Pops. The album also made the band an alternative rock hit in the US, where their videos were featured on MTV and the album received many positive reviews in both mainstream and underground music presses. A large headlining tour in support of the album ensued in 1996, and there were supporting tours with Rancid and Soundgarden. During these tours the band gained a reputation for a series of interesting and, at times, seemingly ludicrous gimmicks and stage antics which included holding raffles during live performances, spinning a large game show wheel to determine set lists, onstage fire breathing, annual Halloween and New Year's shows, and the wearing of coordinated and progressively more ornate stage costumes. In Europe the band also hosted a German variety show, played children's shows and morning shows, and did interviews with fashion magazines. While unorthodox, these antics increased the band's reputation as an energetic live act and helped to increase album sales. Scream, Dracula, Scream! was the last of three releases by Rocket from the Crypt in 1995. The EP The State of Art is on Fire and LP Hot Charity had preceded the album that year, and singer/guitarist John Reis would later refer to these three records as a \\"trilogy\\". \\"Scream, Dracula, Scream!\\" also had different copies for Japan and Australia. Both of them had songs from the 'Hot Charity' recording. The Japan release just had the songs put on the CD, but the \\"Australian Bonus CD Tour Edition\\" had a bonus CD. The Australian copy had \\"Pushed\\", \\"My Arrow's Aim\\", \\"Lorna Doom\\", \\"Shucks\\", \\"Cloud Over Branson\\", and \\"Feathered Friends\\". The Japanese copy also had \\"Pushed\\", \\"My Arrow's Aim\\", and \\"Lorna Doom\\". But instead of \\"Shucks\\", \\"Cloud Over Branson\\", and \\"Feathered Friends\\", they had \\"Guilt Free\\", \\"Poison Eye\\", and \\"Pity Yr Paws\\". All together, the whole 'Hot Charity' recording was released on the two versions. ==Recording== Scream, Dracula, Scream! was Rocket from the Crypt's most ambitious recording to date. Using the extensive recording budget granted them by Interscope, the band employed numerous guest musicians, a string section, additional engineers and mixing sessions, and experimented with several instruments they had not used before. According to the album's liner notes the album was rehearsed and recorded over a 2-month period, with the basic tracks recorded live on a 4-track machine and overdubs of the backing vocals and orchestra recorded later. The album's title was taken from the lyrics of a Wesley Willis song. The album's liner notes also state that the band intended Scream, Dracula, Scream! to consist of one cohesive body of music, with traditional silence between track separations replaced with string, woodwind, and brass passages. However, Interscope demanded a more standardized album so the master tapes were cut and edited into traditional- length tracks. ==Legacy== The album was included in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die. ==Track listing== #\\"Middle\\" - 1:00 #\\"Born in '69\\" - 2:16 #\\"On a Rope\\" - 2:53 #\\"Young Livers\\" - 2:54 #\\"Drop Out\\" - 3:00 #\\"Used\\" - 2:39 #\\"Ball Lightning\\" - 3:50 #\\"Fat Lip\\" 2:42 #\\"Suit City\\" - 2:34 #\\"Heater Hands\\" - 3:36 #\\"Misbeaten\\" - 4:02 #\\"Come See, Come Saw\\" - 3:39 #\\"Salt Future\\" - 3:51 #\\"Burnt Alive\\" - 4:37 #\\"Pushed\\" (Japanese Bonus Track) - 2:25 #\\"My Arrows Aim\\" (Japanese Bonus Track) - 3:18 #\\"Lorna Doom\\" (Japanese Bonus Track) - 2:16 #\\"Guilt Free\\" (Japanese Bonus Track) - 3:41 #\\"Poison Eye\\" (Japanese Bonus Track) - 2:43 #\\"Pity Yr Paws\\" (Japanese Bonus Track) - 3:30 ==Bonus CD \\"Australian Bonus CD Tour Edition\\"== #\\"Pushed\\" - 2:25 #\\"My Arrows Aim\\" - 3:18 #\\"Lorna Doom\\" - 2:16 #\\"Shucks\\" - 2:14 #\\"Cloud Over Branson\\" - 2:52 #\\"Feathered Friends\\" - 4:21 ==Personnel== *Speedo (John Reis) - guitar, lead vocals *ND (Andy Stamets) - guitar, backing vocals *Petey X (Pete Reichert) - bass, backing vocals *Apollo 9 (Paul O'Beirne) - saxophone, backing vocals *JC 2000 (Jason Crane) - trumpet, backing vocals *Atom (Adam Willard) - drums *John Reis, Sr. - accordion on \\"Used\\" *Geoff Harrington - Hammond B3 organ on \\"Come See, Come Saw\\" *Eric Christian - guitar solo on \\"Come See, Come Saw\\" *Raymond Kelley - cello *Don Palmer - violin *Jay Rosen - violin *James Ross - viola *Mick Collins, Frank Daly - additional vocals *Diane Gordon, Natalie Burks, and Latina Webb - backing vocals on \\"Born in '69\\" and \\"Come See, Come Saw\\" *Roger Freeland, Gene Miller, and Joseph Pizzulo - backing vocals on \\"Used\\" and \\"Misbeaten\\" ===Technical=== *John Reis, Jr. - producer, conductor *Donnell Cameron - recording, engineer *Eddie Miller - recording, engineer *Andy Wallace - mixing (tracks: 2-5, 7, 8, 10, 12, 13) *Steve Cisco - mixing assistant *Mark Trombino - engineer, mixing (tracks: 1, 6, 9, 11, 14) *Kelle Musgrave - production coordination *Henry Kadinski - recording supervisor *Miki Vukovich - photography *Mike Nelson - layout, videograbs, type ==References== Category:1995 albums Category:Rocket from the Crypt albums Category:Interscope Records albums ","title":"Scream, Dracula, Scream!"},{"id":"2544931","text":"Margaret Timpson Park and Sentinel apartments, Belconnen Belconnen Town Centre is located in the suburb of Belconnen on the south-western shore of Lake Ginninderra in Canberra, Australia.

His first studio album since 1983's Old Wave, it followed a successful 1989–90 world tour with his All-Starr Band. Time Takes Time features several celebrity guests including Brian Wilson, Harry Nilsson and Electric Light Orchestra frontman Jeff Lynne. ==Background== In February 1987, Ringo Starr started work on his first new studio album in four years. Sessions began with producer Chips Moman in 3 Alarm Studios in Memphis, Tennessee. These sessions lasted for a few days then came to a halt before being resumed in April, with recording taking place at 3 Alarm Studios and Sun Studios. A month-long string of recording sessions were planned in August, for recording at Mayfair Recording Studios in London, before being halted shortly before recording had begun. These sessions were to have been handled by Elton John's manager, John Reid, and were intended to feature John. While on tour in July 1989 with the All-Starr Band, Starr was told that Moman was attempting to release the Memphis sessions as an album; Starr proceeded to sue Moman in August. An injunction was issued by the Fulton County Superior Courts to Starr in early January 1990, where he was to pay out costs of the sessions to Moman. It was announced at a National Association of Radio Merchandisers (NARM) convention that Starr signed a recording contract with Private Music in March 1991, who seemed to be the only label interested in him at the time. ==Recording== Starr had initially intended to try out four producers, and select the best to record the whole album with: \\"...because it's been so long for me that I didn't really know any producers I wanted to go with for the whole record. So I figured I'd try a few people.\\" Aligning himself with top producers Don Was, Peter Asher, Phil Ramone and Jeff Lynne, the album was recorded sporadically between March and September 1991, and finished in February 1992. Jim Horn, who plays all the saxophone parts on the album, had previously worked on Starr's Ringo (1973). The material was written predominantly by outside writers, with Starr co-writing three songs. Time Takes Time also marked Starr's first alliance with Mark Hudson, who assisted with the background vocals and arrangements on some of the Ramone-produced tracks. In April 1991, Starr recorded with fellow label artist, Taj Mahal, on his album. Lynne and Starr recorded four songs between 20 and 31 May: \\"Don't Go Where the Road Don't Go\\", \\"After All These Years\\", \\"Don't Be Cruel\\", and \\"Call Me\\".

Lynne later remixed \\"Don't Go Where the Road Don't Go\\" at Ocean Way Studios. Starr contributed the song \\"You'll Never Know\\", recorded on 14 September at the tail end of the album sessions, to the soundtrack of the film Curly Sue. \\"Weight of the World\\" was recorded in February 1992 in Los Angeles. Starr recorded \\"Runaways\\" and \\"All in the Name of Love\\", the latter written by Jerry Lynn Williams, with Ramone. With Asher, Starr recorded \\"Thank You for Being a Friend\\", written by Andrew Gold, The Posies' \\"Golden Blunders\\", and a Paul McCartney–Starr song, \\"Angel in Disguise\\". Was' sessions were backed by a group of musicians: Benmont Tench on keyboard, Mark Goldenberg on guitar and Bonnie Raitt on bass. With Was, Starr recorded the Diane Warren–written song \\"In a Heartbeat\\", \\"What Goes Around\\" written by Rick Suchow, and \\"Weight of the World\\", featuring Brian Wilson, and Jellyfish, on backing vocals respectively. Andy Sturmer and Roger Manning of Jellyfish also contributed the song \\"I Don't Believe You\\" and sang backing vocals on an arrangement basically mirroring their own version of the song. Several tracks were left off the album.Clayson, Alan \\"Ringo Starr: Straight Man Or Joker\\", Sanctuary Publishing, Ltd. 1998 p.334 The primarily McCartney-penned song \\"Angel in Disguise\\", to which Starr added a verse, has never been released.

Although Starr recorded and released another song entitled \\"Call Me\\", it bears no resemblance to the Lynne-produced number. ==Release== Starr released an announcement about the album, the single \\"Weight of the World\\", and an All-Starr tour, on 28 February 1992. On 2 April, Starr held a press conference, stating the same three things, and in addition, tour dates, at Radio City Music Hall in New York. From 3 April, onwards for a few days, Starr made TV appearances and radio broadcasts to promote the album and the tour. On the same day, promotional copies of the \\"Weight of the World\\" single were sent to radio stations in the US. Filming a music video for \\"Weight of the World\\" started on 16 May, and was finished the next day. CNN broadcast a behind-the-scenes report on making the video on 18 May. Starr performed the song, with his All- Starr band as backing musicians, on the TV show Arsenio. The \\"Weight of the World\\" single was released on 28 April in the US, and on 18 May in the UK. Time Takes Time was released in the US on 22 May, and in the UK on 29 June, by Private Music. Starr commented that he had not \\"been this happy with an album since Ringo in 1973. It's time I stretched.\\" However, the album failed to chart. While a planned single release on 3 July in the US of \\"Don't Go Where the Road Don't Go\\", backed with \\"Everyone Wins\\", was shelved, a CD edition of the single managed to get released in Germany on 21 September. The 7\\" vinyl edition of the single was also released in Germany and had \\"Don't Know a Thing About Love\\" as the B-side, released on the same day. Starr again appeared on Arsenio on 21 October, being interviewed and then performing \\"Don't Go Where the Road Don't Go\\" and \\"Act Naturally\\". Times Takes Time was released on vinyl only in Mexico, Brazil, Spain and Germany. Despite an All-Starr tour in 1992 to promote the album, Time Takes Time would be Starr's only album with Private Music before he was dropped from their roster. ==Reception== Well-received upon release, many critics considered Time Takes Time Starr's best album since 1973's Ringo. Rolling Stone magazine wrote, \\"The drummer's most consistent, wide-awake album since Ringo, from 1973\\". The release was met with some indifference by the public however, and thus failed to chart. Lead single \\"Weight of the World\\" managed to reach number 74 in the UK. ==Track listing== ==Personnel== Personnel per booklet. * Ringo Starr – lead vocals, drums, percussion * Jeff Lynne – guitars, bass, keyboards, backing vocals * Mark Goldenberg – guitars * Waddy Wachtel – guitars * Andrew Gold – guitars, backing vocals * Roger Manning – guitars, backing vocals * Andy Sturmer – guitars, backing vocals * Michael Landau – guitars * David Grissom – guitars * Michael Thompson – guitars * Jeff Baxter – guitars * Mark Hart – guitars, keyboards, backing vocals * Benmont Tench – keyboards * Robbie Buchanan – keyboards * Jeffrey Vanston – keyboards * Jamie Muhoberac – keyboards * James \\"Hutch\\" Hutchinson – bass * Bob Glaub – bass * Neil Stubenhaus – bass * Peter Asher – tambourine, backing vocals * Mark Hudson – percussion, backing vocals * Jim Horn – saxophone * Suzie Katayama – cello * Raven Kane – backing vocals * Rosemary Butler – backing vocals * Valerie Carter – backing vocals * Terri Wood – backing vocals * Carmen Twillie – backing vocals * Wendy Fraser – backing vocals * Stephanie Spruill – backing vocals * Andrea Robinson – backing vocals * Bobbi Page – backing vocals * Doug Fieger – backing vocals * Berton Averre – backing vocals * Mark Hart – backing vocals * Craig Copeland – backing vocals * Naomi Star – backing vocals * Darlene Koldenhoven – backing vocals * Harry Nilsson – vocals * Kathryn Cotter – backing vocals * Mark Warman – backing vocals * Brian Wilson – backing vocals * Brian O'Doherty – backing vocals ==References== ; Footnotes ; Citations ==External links== *Summary of Time Takes Time from \\"Complete U.K. Discography of John, Paul, George and Ringo\\" Category:Ringo Starr albums Category:Albums produced by Jeff Lynne Category:Albums produced by Don Was Category:1992 albums Category:Albums produced by Peter Asher Category:Albums produced by Phil Ramone Category:Private Music albums ","title":"Time Takes Time"},{"id":"2544948","text":"Showman can have a variety of meanings, usually by context and depending on the country. == Australia == Travelling showmen are people who run amusement and side show equipment at regional shows, state capital shows, events and festivals throughout Australia.

Most Showman’s Heritage goes back generations all following in the foot steps of their parents, showmen know each other all over the UK due to the nature of the business Travelling from one fair to the next over generations. The children often work alongside of their parents learning all aspects of the business, this has been like this for generations, close bonds are formed. Most Showmen marriages happen within the community, having their own language, traditions with most having generations of lineage of Showmen, Showmen are viewed as and self identify as a cultural group. They are not recognised as an ethnic group though due to Showmen being more of an occupation than an ethnicity, also as the group has drawn upon many other ethnicities and since many families are joining and leaving the group, it cannot be considered an ethnicity. Showman generally get along well with the UK’s other Traveller communities (Most notably Romanichal Travellers and Irish Travellers). Marriages between different Traveller communities aren’t uncommon. == United States == Showmen in the United States are also male dancers or performers in shows, usually alongside showgirls; an example would be Gene Kelly in the film Singin' in the Rain.

As a composer, his main musical influences were Grieg, August Söderman and Wagner as well as Swedish folk idiom.Percy G. Wilhelm Peterson-Berger, An Introduction. (Stockholm, Wilhelm Peterson-Berger Society) 1982. ==The composer== Peterson-Berger studied at the Stockholm Conservatory from 1886–89 and then in Dresden for a year.Haglund R. \\"Peterson-Berger\\" in The New Grove Dictionary of Opera ed Sadie S. Macmillan, London and New York, 1997. He is best known for three albums of national romantic piano pieces entitled Frösöblomster I, II and III (Flowers of Frösö), which includes the often performed Vid Frösö kyrka (At Frösö Church) and Sommarsång (Summer Song). The sets, which were composed over a period of 18 years (1896 - 1914) and brought together afterwards as a collection have gained a reputation of representing a quintessential \\"Swedishness\\" in the romantic, nationalistic vein of their time. The most famous of the pieces, Sommarsång (Summer Song) recalls the warm, calm, harmonious and bright pre-summer evenings where the sun in the north almost never goes down; they were the great breakthrough for Wilhelm. Sommarsång is still known to most Swedes, even to people generally uninterested in music: the majority of young piano students in the Nordic countries have been taught this piece. His songs for vocal ensemble are also still regularly performed, and are part of the core repertoire of Swedish choirs. His other works include the five symphonies - among them are no.2 Sunnanfärd and no.3 Same-Ätnam generally considered the best - as well as the operas Ran, Arnljot, Domedagsprofeterna (\\"The Doomsday Prophets\\") and Adils och Elisiv (\\"Adils and Elisiv\\"). His command of the larger forms, in both architecture and instrumentation, is disputed. He was stage manager at the Stockholm Opera from 1908-10. The opera Arnljot has nevertheless become something of a symbol for the province of Jämtland and is regularly performed there, as a \\"musical drama\\", at Arnljotlägden on Frösön, close to Peterson- Berger's former home, Sommarhagen. Domedagsprofeterna is the antithesis of Arnljot – a light festive musical comedy set in 17th century Uppsala, while the saga Adils och Elisiv where Swedish ‘talsång’ (speechsong) attained its purest expression is a work extolling Peterson-Berger's belief in humanism and the goodness of man. He also wrote about eighty songs, many of which set poems by Erik Axel Karlfeldt, for example Aspåkerspolska. ==Work list (partial)== ===Orchestral=== *Symphony No.1 in B flat major, Baneret (\\"The Banner\\"), 1889-1903, revised 1932-1933 Movements: \\"När vi först drogo ut\\", \\"Mellan fedjerna\\", \\"Vid hjältebåren\\", \\"Mot nya vårar\\" *Symphony No.2 in E flat major, Sunnanfärd (\\"The Journey of Southerly Winds\\"), 1910 Movements: \\"Stiltje - Seglats\\", \\"Rosenstaden: Dionysoståget - I Eros tempel - Symposion\\", \\"Hemlängtan - För sunnanvind\\" *Symphony No.3 in F minor, Same Ätnam (\\"Lappland Symphony\\"), 1913-1915 Movements: \\"Forntidsbilder\\", \\"Vinterkväll\\", \\"Sommarnatt\\", \\"Framtidsdrömmar\\" *Symphony No.4 in A major, Holmia (\\"Stockholm\\"), 1929 *Symphony No.5 in B major, Solitudo (\\"Solitude\\"), 1932-1933 *Orientalisk Dans (\\"Oriental Dance\\"), 1889-1890 *Violin concerto in F sharp minor, 1915-1928 *Romance in D minor for violin and orchestra, 1915 *Törnrosasagan (\\"The Story of the Sleeping Beauty\\"), 1934 *Symphony No.6, Hellas (\\"Greece\\"), 1935-1938 - unfinished ===Opera=== *Ran, 1899-1900 * Lyckan ('The Happiness'), 1903 *Arnljot, 1907-1909 *Domedagsprofeterna ('The Doomsday Prophets'), 1912-1917 *Adils and Elisiv, 1921-1924 ===Vocal=== *Sveagaldrar, cantata, 1897 *Part songs/music for choir: Tio sånger för blandad kör; Album, 8 sånger för blandad kör (including his settings of J.

Peterson-Berger in The New Grove Dictionary of Opera ed Sadie S. Macmillan, London and New York, 1997. He was conservative and fought the increasing influence of modernism in music, especially from Arnold Schoenberg and his followers. His progress was hindered by many enemies whom he made through his writings; he attacked showy virtuosity and dry academicism with satire but also with strict conscientiousness. For either composers or performers who did not conform to his taste (or who were young and insecure female musicians, to take one typical example), he was not above grave personal insults. Other writings include ‘Svensk musikkultur’ (Swedish musical culture, 1911) which includes clearsighted and satirical attacks on the prevailing musical establishment, ‘Richard Wagner som kulturföreteelse’ (Richard Wagner as a cultural phenomenon, 1913) as well as translations of Tristan und Isolde (for a 1909 production in Stockholm), and Friedrich Nietzsche’s The Birth of Tragedy (1902) and Thus Spoke Zarathustra (1919).Percy G. Wilhelm Peterson- Berger, An Introduction. Stockholm, Wilhelm Peterson-Berger Society, 1982. ==The man== One acquaintance later recalled his surprise when, on a journey by train from Stockholm to Östersund and Frösön, the big man and notorious critic suddenly burst into tears and felt soft like a child as the bucolic landscape of his beloved Jämtland began to unfold outside the window. Even this writer, however, noted that even Peterson-Berger's threatening and miserable physical appearance and demeanour conformed to the stereotype of the dour Scandinavian. His home on the island of Frösön near Östersund (where he spent his summers from 1914 and then lived permanently from 1930) is open to the public in the summer months and is much as the composer left it. The downstairs music hall has his grand piano (he was a competent pianist), a work room (with a ‘picture window’ looking out over Storsjön) and library (with his collection of books and scores), while upstairs the bedrooms may be viewed. He lived alone there with a butler and his cats. There is also a small café where books and CDs are sold. ==References== Nationalencyklopedin, band 15 (1994) (Swedish National Encyclopedia, in Swedish) Percy G.

Introduced in 1915 to meet British military requirements during World War I, it was used to power the Handley Page Type O bombers and a number of other military aircraft. The Eagle was the first engine to make a non-stop trans-Atlantic crossing by aeroplane when two Eagles powered the converted Vickers Vimy bomber on the Transatlantic flight of Alcock and Brown in June 1919. ==Background== At the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, the Royal Aircraft Factory asked Rolls-Royce to develop a new air-cooled engine. Despite initial reluctance they agreed on condition that it be cooled by water rather than air, as this was the company's area of expertise.Pugh 2001, p.71. ==Design and development== Development of the new 20 litre engine was led by Henry Royce from his home in Kent. Based initially on the 7.4 litre 40/50 Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost engine, and drawing also on the design of a 7.2 litre Daimler DF80 aero engine used in a 1913 Grand Prix Mercedes that had been acquired,Taulbut 2011, p.41. the power was increased by doubling the number of cylinders to twelve and increasing their stroke to , although their bore remained at of the 40/50. The engine was also run faster, and an epicyclic reduction gear was designed to keep the propeller speed below 1,100 rpm. To reduce inertia and improve performance the valvetrain design was changed from sidevalves to a SOHC design,Pugh 2001, p.72. closely following the original \\"side-slot\\" rocker arm design philosophy used on the contemporary German Mercedes D.I, Mercedes D.II and Mercedes D.III straight-six aviation powerplants. Rolls-Royce Eagle engines at Derby in 1919 On 3 January 1915 the Admiralty ordered twenty-five of the new engines. The Eagle first ran on a test bed at Rolls-Royce's Derby works in February 1915, producing at 1,600 rpm. This was quickly increased to 1,800, then in August 1915 to 2,000 rpm where it produced . After further testing, it was decided to approve the engine for production at 1,800 rpm and ; 1,900 rpm was allowed for short periods. The engine first flew on a Handley Page O/100 bomber in December 1915, the first flight of a Rolls-Royce aero engine. The Eagle was developed further during 1916 and 1917, with power being progressively increased from to , followed by , and then , and finally by February 1918 by which time eight Eagle variants had been produced.Note; all horsepower ratings are for continuous power at 1,800 rpm. Higher powers at 2,000 rpm were available for periods of five minutes. \\"World Encyclopedia of Aero Engines – 5th edition\\" by Bill Gunston, Sutton Publishing, 2006, P.186 Throughout World War I Rolls- Royce struggled to build Eagles in the quantities required by the War Office, but the company resisted pressure to license other manufacturers to produce it, fearing that the engine's much admired quality would risk being compromised.Pugh 2001, p.79-86. After the War, a Mark IX version of the Eagle was developed for civilian use. Production continued until 1928, and in total 4,681 Eagle engines were built.Lumsden 2003, p.183.

(1922). The City of Detroit, Michigan, 1701-1922, Vol. IV, pp. 308-313. The S. J. Clarke Publishing Company. His father owned a foundry and machine shop. Horace Dodge and his elder brother John Francis Dodge were inseparable as children and as adults. In 1886, the Dodge brothers moved to Detroit, Michigan, where they took jobs at a boilermaker plant. In 1894, they went to work as machinists at the Canadian Typograph Company across the Detroit River in Windsor, Ontario. In 1896, Horace Dodge married Anna Thompson, a Scottish immigrant born in Dundee. The couple had a son, Horace Jr., and a daughter, Delphine. Thompson later married actor Hugh Dillman after the death of Dodge. While brother John Dodge was the sales-oriented managerial type, Horace was a gifted mechanic and inveterate tinkerer. He invented the first dirt-proof ball bearing; in 1897, John arranged a deal for them to join with a third-party investor to manufacture bicycles. Within a few years, they sold the business and, in 1901, used the proceeds of the sale to set up their own machine shop in Detroit. During their first year in business, the Dodge brothers' company began making parts for the automobile industry. ==Automobiles== In 1902, they won a contract to build transmissions for the Olds Motor Vehicle Company upon which they built a solid reputation for quality and service. However, the following year they turned down a second contract from Olds (Oldsmobile) to retool their plant to build engines for Henry Ford in a deal that included a share position in the new Ford Motor Company. They had invested in Ford's business and eventually Ford would be in debt to the Dodge Brothers. By 1910, Horace Dodge and his brother were so successful they built a new plant in Hamtramck, Michigan. For ten years, the Dodge brothers' company was supplier to Ford, and John Dodge worked as vice president of the Ford company. In 1913 the Dodge brothers terminated their Ford contract and devoted their energies toward producing a Dodge automobile. They began building motor trucks, ambulances and other vehicles for the United States military during the arms buildup for World War I and in October 1917 they produced their first commercial car. At war's end, their company manufactured and marketed both cars and trucks. He was inducted into the Automotive Hall of Fame in 1981. ==Personal life== Despite their wealth and growing influence in the business community, the red-haired Early history of the Dodge brothers Dodge brothers' crude manners and aggressive conduct made them socially unacceptable to most of the wealthy Detroit elite. In 1912, Horace Dodge built a red sandstone mansion in Grosse Pointe called Rose Terrace. The huge home with formal gardens and boat dock overlooked Lake St. Clair. This was replaced by a second Rose Terrace, constructed in the 1930s by architect Horace Trumbauer, for Mrs. Dodge and her second husband. Architectural historian W. Hawkins Ferry described the mansion as \\"unquestionably Grosse Pointe's most regal residence\\". In addition to Rose Terrace, the Dodges acquired a large winter estate in Palm Beach, Florida. Horace's wife Anna had studied music, and this fact won them acceptance by the city's social order. Horace and Anna Dodge became major benefactors of the new Detroit Symphony Orchestra and would play a key role in the construction of Orchestra Hall. SS Delphine off the French Riviera, July 2008. A speedboat and yachting enthusiast, Horace Dodge's keen interest in the vessel's engines led him to establish a marine division as part of their automotive business. He purchased several steam yachts, each larger and more luxurious than the previous. The first two large yachts were named Nokomis, both being purchased by the government for World War I use, with the second being described as a \\"floating palace\\" even as it was being stripped for Navy use shortly after completion. The last, named the Delphine for his daughter after following the Nokomis tradition in the early phase of design, was a vessel. Construction commenced in 1920 and was completed in 1921, after his death. In the ensuing years the yacht experienced a sinking, a run onto rocks, and service as a United States Navy patrol boat during World War II. The Delphine passed through the hands of several owners and after major refurbishing it sails the Mediterranean today as a luxury charter. Horace Dodge's great-grandson is film producer Johnny Dodge. ==Death== Dodge Brothers Mausoleum In 1919, Henry Ford bought out the Dodge brothers' shareholdings in Ford Motor Company for $25 million. In January 1920, Horace's brother, John, died during the influenza epidemic. He was interred in the family's Egyptian-style mausoleum in Detroit's Woodlawn Cemetery guarded by two Sphinx statues.Hyde (2005), pp. 117-18. Having also contracted the flu that December following several relapses, Horace also died from complications of the disease resulting in pneumonia and cirrhosis of the liver at the age of 52 in Palm Beach, Florida. He was interred with his brother in the same mausoleum. His widow outlived him by fifty years. In 1925, Horace and John Dodge's widows sold their automobile business to Dillon Read investment bankers for $170 million. Upon her death in 1970, Anna Thompson Dodge left a sum to the City of Detroit for the construction of the Horace E. Dodge and Son Memorial Fountain. The fountain was designed by sculptor Isamu Noguchi and opened in 1978 as part of the city's Hart Plaza. Horace E.

The parish contains the hamlets of Barlake and Edford. It is within easy commuting distance of both Bristol and Bath. ==History== Its place name is derived from the Old English Hol, meaning deep or hollow and cumb meaning valley. The parish of Holcombe was part of the Kilmersdon Hundred. The original medieval village was buried at the time of the Great Plague of London, and the old parish church, which survives, is surrounded by the mounds that bear testimony to this burial. It is suggested that the rhyme 'Ring a Ring o' Roses' began there as a result. An alternative explanation relates to the drowning of five children from the village in an icy pond in 1899. The village has two pubs: The Duke of Cumberland, which can be found at the bottom of the village's hill, and the Holcombe Inn, which recently changed its name from The Ring O' Roses to its original 1960s name. It was named as a reminder of the plague that previously destroyed the village. Holcombe has four churches, two of which are still in use. Holcombe was the site of several mines on the Somerset coalfield; however these are all now closed. The importance of Somerset coalfield caused a branch canal from the main Dorset and Somerset Canal to be proposed, and construction began in 1786 following a route from Coleford, Somerset to Nettlebridge through Holcombe. This intersected the main road through Holcombe around 75 m north of the Duke of Cumberland inn. However, in 1803, the entire canal was abandoned without being completed. There is limited evidence of the canal remaining, including some masonry such as bridges and retaining walls near the Duke of Cumberland. Holcombe quarry is no longer in use and has been fenced off. However, although it is highly dangerous and despite various warnings, it remains a popular destination for teenagers to go swimming and \\"tombstoning\\" during the summer months, which have resulted in personal injuries and some deaths. ==Governance== The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council’s operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council. The village falls within the Non-metropolitan district of Mendip, which was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, having previously been part of Shepton Mallet Rural District, which is responsible for local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection and recycling, cemeteries and crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism. Somerset County Council is responsible for running the largest and most expensive local services such as education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, policing and fire services, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning. It is also part of a county constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election. ==Religious sites== Crossroads The old Church of St. Andrew has late Saxon-early Norman origins and was rebuilt in the 16th century. The church is in the care of the Churches Conservation Trust. It is in general now closed; but services are held at Christmas and on the first Sunday of June, July and August. The church was used as a location in the BBC production of Poldark.http://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol- news/heres-poldark-filmed-bristol-and-104539 The former priest's house later became a coach house to Holcombe House, and is Grade II listed. ==Notable residents== For a time Scott of the Antarctic's parents lived at and ran the brewery in Holcombe. Members of his family are buried in a family grave, and there is a memorial accrediting Scott's interment in the Antarctic, in the Holcombe old church. Bob Braham, a decorated airman, was born in the village. ==References== ==External links== Category:Villages in Mendip District Category:Somerset coalfield Category:Civil parishes in Somerset Category:Structures on the Heritage at Risk register in Somerset ","title":"Holcombe, Somerset"},{"id":"2545036","text":"A.C.

Along with Pearl S. Buck's The Good Earth (1931), it was the most influential book on Western understanding of China as well as the most influential book on Western sympathy for Red China in the 1930s.Harold Isaacs, Scratches on Our Minds, (New York: John Day, 1958; rpr. White Plains, 1989): 155 n. 71, 162-163. == Overview == In Red Star Over China, Edgar Snow recounts the months that he spent with the Chinese Red Army in 1936. Most of this time, he was at their then-capital Bao'an (Pao An). They moved to the famous Yan'an only after he left. Snow uses his extensive interviews with Mao and the other top leaders to present vivid descriptions of the Long March, as well as biographical accounts of leaders on both sides of the conflicts, including Zhou Enlai, Peng Dehuai, Lin Biao, He Long, and Mao Zedong's own account of his life. When Snow wrote, there were no reliable reports reaching the West about what was going on in the Communist-controlled areas. Other writers, such as Agnes Smedley, had written in some detail about the Chinese Communists before the Long March, but none of these writers had ever visited them or even conducted first hand interviews with them. Snow's status as an international journalist not previously identified with the communist movement gave his reports the stamp of authenticity. The glowing pictures of life in the communist areas contrasted with the gloom and corruption of the Kuomintang government. Many Chinese learned about Mao and the communist movement from the almost immediate translations of Mao's autobiography, and readers in North America and Europe, especially those with liberal views, were heartened to learn of a movement which they interpreted as being anti-fascist and progressive. Snow reported the new Second United Front which Mao said would leave violent class struggle behind. Although Snow made it clear that Mao's ultimate aim was control of China, many readers got the impression that the Chinese communists were \\"agrarian reformers.\\" Kenneth E. Shewmaker, \\"The \\"Agrarian Reformer\\" Myth,\\" The China Quarterly 34 (1968): 66-81. Snow's Preface to the revised edition in 1968 describes the book's original context: > The Western powers, in self-interest, were hoping for a miracle in China. > They dreamed of a new birth of nationalism that would keep Japan so bogged > down that she would never be able to turn upon the Western colonies—her true > objective. Red Star Over China tended to show that the Chinese Communists > could indeed provide that nationalist leadership needed for effective anti- > Japanese resistance. How dramatically the United States' policy-making > attitudes have altered since then [...] It provided not only for non-Chinese > readers, but also for the entire Chinese people—including all but the > Communist leaders themselves—the first authentic account of the Chinese > Communist Party and the first connected story of their long struggle to > carry through the most thoroughgoing social revolution in China's three > millenniums of history. Many editions were published in China ...Red Star > Over China, Preface to the Revised Edition 1968 .) == Publishing history == Snow was not available to read proofs of the initial London and New York editions, but he revised the text of the 1939 and 1944 editions. The Publisher's Note of the 1939 edition explains that Snow added a \\"substantial new section\\" of six chapters bringing the narrative up to July 1938 as well as \\"many textual changes.\\" Snow made the textual changes partly to polish but he also responded to friends and reviewers. Some of them felt Snow's account of party history had been too critical of Soviet policy, and others felt that he had given too much credit to Mao for independent Chinese strategies. Snow toned down but did not remove the implicit criticisms of Stalin.Snow's revisions are listed in Harvey Klehr, John Earl Haynes K. M. Anderson, The Soviet World of American Communism (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1998) pp. 347-341. The 1944 edition was allowed to go out of print in the 1950s, but Snow made substantial revisions and annotations for the Grove Press reprint of 1968.S.B.

Review in Foreign Affairs; Snow, White & Seven China Revolution Classics and it clearly played a role in swaying Western and Chinese opinion in favor of Mao. Indeed, Mao commented that the book \\"had merit no less than Great Yu controlling the floods.\\" According to Jung Chang and Jon Halliday, Snow probably believed what he was told to be true, and much of it is still of basic significance, especially the \\"Autobiography of Mao\\". They also wrote that Mao omitted key elements from his accounts of party history and Snow missed others.Jung, Chang; Halliday, Jon, 2006. Mao: The Unknown Story. Random House, London. , p. 192 According to Anne-Marie Brady, Snow submitted the transcripts of his interviews to be edited and approved by Party officials and changes in the American edition were made in response to the Communist Party of the United States. Snow’s account of the Long March has been criticised by some while others have maintained that it is basically valid.Shuyun Sun, The Long March: The True Story of China's Founding Myth (New York: Doubleday, 2007).

The village of Bolland, after which the family took their name, is nearby. He entered the Society of Jesus in 1612 at Mechelen. After his studies at the Jesuit colleges of Maastricht and Antwerp, Bolland taught humanities in Roermond, Den Bosch, Brussels and Antwerp. In 1620 Bolland was sent to study theology at the University of Leuven. Four years later he received holy orders and then became prefect of studies at the Jesuit college of Mechelen.De Smedt, Charles. \\"The Bollandists.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 2. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1907. 26 Mar. 2015 Bolland was ordained in 1625.\\"Jean Bolland, founder of the Bollandists\\", The Jesuits of the Province of Southern Belgium and Luxembourg In 1630 he was called to Antwerp by the superior of the Flemish province of the Society of Jesus to examine papers left by the hagiographer Heribert Rosweyde who had died shortly before, and report back his opinion as to what it was advisable to do with them. Bolland went to Antwerp, familiarized himself with the manuscripts, and, while admitting that the work was still merely a rough and faulty draft, gave reasons for believing that without an undue expenditure of labour it might be brought to a successful completion. He offered to oversee the work on two conditions: that he should be free to modify the plan of Rosweyde as he understood it, and that Rosweyde's materials should be set apart for his exclusive use. The Provincial Superior, Jacques van Straten, accepted the conditions and Bolland was transferred from the college of Mechelen to Antwerp, where he became director of the Latin Congregation, a congregation composed of the principal people of the city, and had charge of preparing the Acta Sanctorum for publication. Bolland began by outlining an even more ambitious plan. Rosweyde had confined his quest of original texts to libraries in the Flanders and neighbouring regions. Rosweyde had proposed to publish only the original texts, without commentaries or annotations, but Bolland decided to give all the information he could find for each saint and his cult, to preface each text with a study of its author and its historical value, and to append notes of explanation. He visited monastic libraries, collecting and copying a considerable number of documents. Shortly after arriving in Antwerp, Bolland had already succeeded in putting in good order the documents relating to the saints of January, and had found a publisher, Jan van Meurs. He decided to organize the entries according to the Roman Calendar. After working in Antwerp for five years, it became apparent that the task was too great for one man. Bolland asked for an assistant and this request was supported by the abbot of Liessies Abbey, Antoine de Wynghe, who provided a stipend. In 1635 he was joined by Godfrey Henschen, who started to work on the February saints, while Bolland prepared the material for January. After fourteen years of work, the two volumes for January were printed in Antwerp in 1643. The three volumes for February were released in 1658. Henschen continued to labor at the publication of the Acta Sanctorum up to the time of his death in 1681. In 1659 Bolland received assistance from a third Jesuit, Daniel van Papenbroek, who in the end did most of the work for the 18 volumes of the Acta Sanctorum. In 1660–1662 Van Papenbroek and Henschen traveled through Germany, France and Italy, searching for old documents in monasteries and libraries. Jean Bolland died in Antwerp, aged 69, in 1665. ==References== Category:1596 births Category:1665 deaths Category:People from Herve Category:Jesuit historiography Category:Christian hagiographers Category:Belgian Jesuits Category:Walloon people ","title":"Jean Bolland"},{"id":"2545148","text":"Logo for Metropolitan Community Church Jean White (1941-8 November 2010) was the founding pastor within the Metropolitan Community Church (MCC) in London.

It is the oldest gardening program produced for television in the United States, premiering April 16, 1975. ==History== The show was originally called Crockett's Victory Garden for its first host, James Underwood Crockett. On each episode, Crockett demonstrates and cares for a vegetable garden, shows you how to build a cold frame, and why salt marsh hay was useful as a mulch. At the end of each episode, Crockett was in the greenhouse, as he answered viewer questions about gardening, which is sent in by viewers. Following Crockett's death at the age of 63, Bob Thomson hosted the program from 1979 to 1991 and the show was renamed The Victory Garden. With Thomson at the helm, The Victory Garden began to broaden its scope. In addition to the regular demonstrations of planting, potting, pruning, and pest control, the show began to make room for more guests and travel features. Marian Morash, wife of series producer Russell Morash, appeared on the air to do her recipes on the program from 1979 to 2001. Roger Swain hosted the program from 1991 to 2002, Michael Weishan hosted the program from 2002 to 2007. Jamie Durie hosted the program from 2007 to 2010. In 2013, the show was relaunched in partnership with Edible Communities, and it became The Victory Garden's EdibleFeast.

The CCC is authorized to buy, sell, lend, make payments, and engage in other activities for the purpose of increasing production, stabilizing prices, assuring adequate supplies, and facilitating the efficient marketing of agricultural commodities. The CCC, which has no staff, is essentially a financing institution for the USDA's farm price and income support commodity programs, commodity export credit guarantees, and agricultural export subsidies. The programs funded through CCC are administered by employees of the Farm Service Agency and the Foreign Agricultural Service. The CCC has the authority to borrow up to $30 billion from the US Treasury to carry out its obligations. Net losses from its operations subsequently are restored by the Congressional appropriations process. It issues payments in the form of commodity certificates. ==History and charter== The CCC was incorporated October 17, 1933, under a Delaware charter pursuant to Executive Order 6340 issued the previous day by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt. It had a capitalization of $3 million subscribed by the Secretary of Agriculture and the Governor of the Farm Credit Administration. It was initially managed and operated in close affiliation with the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, which funded its operations. On July 1, 1939, the CCC was transferred to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). The Secretary of Agriculture was granted the authority to exercise all rights of ownership of the Corporation's by Executive Order 8219 of 1939. It was reincorporated on July 1, 1948, as a federal corporation within USDA by the Commodity Credit Corporation Charter Act (62 Stat.1070; 15 U.S.C. 714). The CCC was created to stabilize, support and protect farm income and prices. The CCC is also the Federal government's primary financing arm for many domestic and international agricultural programs. The CCC helps maintain balanced and adequate supplies of agricultural commodities and aids in their orderly distribution. The CCC helps America’s agricultural producers through commodity and farm storage facility loans, purchases, and income support payments. The CCC also works to make available materials and facilities required in the production and marketing of agricultural commodities. In addition, the CCC provides incentives and payments to landowners to establish conservation practices on their land. The CCC provides agricultural commodities to other Federal agencies and foreign governments. The CCC also donates commodities to domestic and international relief agencies as well as foreign countries. The CCC assists in the development of new domestic and foreign markets and marketing facilities for American agricultural commodities. The CCC operates numerous domestic programs such as income support, disaster, and conservation programs. It also extends direct credit and guarantees commodity sales to foreign countries throughout the world. The CCC has its own disbursing authority and utilizes the Federal Reserve Bank system and United States Treasury to make payments. This disbursing authority allows the CCC to make payments quickly and to provide financial support to America’s producers and farmers immediately. The CCC has multiple funding mechanisms. Most of the domestic programs are operated out of a revolving fund, in which the CCC has a permanent indefinite borrowing authority, as defined by Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-11, Preparation, Submission, and Execution of the Budget. Borrowing authority permits the Corporation to incur obligations and authorizes it to borrow funds to liquidate the obligations. This fund also receives money from appropriated funding for costs incurred (i.e., realized losses), loan repayments, inventory sales, interest income, and fees. Additionally, the CCC receives direct appropriations for specific programs such as its Credit Reform programs, foreign grant and donation programs, and disaster relief. The 1996 farm bill (P.L. 104-127) expanded the CCC mandate to include funding for several conservation programs (including the Conservation Reserve Program) and made conservation one of the purposes of the CCC. More recently, in the wake of an international retaliation to what are casually known as the Trump tariffs, the CCC was heavily invoked again. That is, In July 2018, Trump's administration announced that it would use the CCC, to pay farmers up to $12 billion. This aid was increased to $28 billion in May 2019. The CCC attempts to offset losses in the American agricultural sector resulting from retaliatory tariffs from the European Union, China, and other states. It was estimated by the USDA that in 2019 these and other aid payments constituted one third of total American farm income. ==Basic responsibilities== The CCC Charter Act, as amended, aids producers through loans, purchases, payments, and other operations, and makes available materials and facilities required in the production and marketing of agricultural commodities. The CCC Charter Act also authorizes the sale of agricultural commodities to other government agencies and to foreign governments and the donation of food to domestic, foreign, or international relief agencies. CCC also assists in the development of new domestic and foreign markets and marketing facilities for agricultural commodities. The CCC funds many programs that fall under multiple agencies within the USDA. Each CCC funded program helps achieve parts of both the CCC mission and the strategic plan of the agency under which the program falls. The CCC mission and strategic goals are achieved through the successful implementation of the following key programs areas: Income Support and Disaster Assistance – Income support and disaster assistance programs provide financial assistance to protect farmers and ranchers from fluctuations in market conditions and unexpected natural or man-made disasters. Assistance is provided through income support programs, disaster assistance programs, and the Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Program (NAP). FSA is responsible for administering income support and disaster assistance programs. Conservation – Supported by the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 (2008 Farm Bill), conservation programs offer farmers and ranchers a variety of financial and economic incentives to conserve natural resources on the nation’s privately owned farmlands. These programs focus on reducing erosion, protecting streams and rivers, restoring and establishing fish and wildlife habitats, and improving air quality through several conservation incentive payments, technical assistance, and cost-share programs. FSA and NRCS administer the CCC conservation programs. Commodity Operations and Food Aid – FSA personnel handle the procurement, acquisition, storage, disposition, and distribution of commodities, and the administration of the United States Warehouse Act (USWA). These programs help achieve domestic farm program price support objectives, produce a uniform regulatory system for storing agricultural products, and ensure the timely provision of food products for domestic and international food assistance programs and market development programs. Foreign Market Development – Expanding markets for agricultural products is critical to the long-term health and prosperity of the U.S. agricultural sector. With 95% of the world’s population living outside the United States, future growth in demand for food and agricultural products will occur primarily in overseas markets. The CCC funds used in the market development programs play a critical role in helping to open new markets and in facilitating U.S. competitiveness and by doing so, help to secure a more prosperous future for American agriculture. Support for economic development and trade capacity building reinforces these efforts by helping developing countries to become economically stable and improve their prospects to participate in and benefit from expanding global trade in agricultural products. FAS administers the CCC foreign market development programs. Export Credit – The CCC export credit guarantee and direct loan programs, administered by FAS in conjunction with FSA, provide payment guarantees for third party commercial financing and direct financing of U.S. agricultural exports. These programs facilitate exports to buyers in countries where credit is necessary to maintain or increase U.S. sales but where financing may not be available without CCC credit facilities. ==Organization== A Board of Directors manages the CCC and is subject to the general supervision and direction of the Secretary of Agriculture who is an ex officio director and chairperson of the Board. The Board consists of seven members in addition to the Secretary. The President of the United States, with the advice and consent of the Senate, appoints the board members to office. The members of the Board and the Corporation officers are officials of USDA. The CCC officers, directly or through officials of designated USDA agencies, maintain liaison with numerous other governmental and private trade operations. The CCC has no actual employees; it carries out the majority of its programs through the personnel and facilities of the Farm Service Agency (FSA), Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS), and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). Most of the CCC programs are delivered through an extensive nationwide network of FSA field offices, including approximately 2,100 USDA Service Centers and 51 state offices (including Puerto Rico). This network enables the CCC to maintain a close relationship with customers, successfully addressing their needs and continually improving program delivery. The FSA implements CCC funded programs for income support, disaster assistance, conservation, and international food procurement. Though FSA provides the staff for the CCC, several CCC funded programs fall under purview of the FAS or the NRCS. The FAS has primary responsibility for USDA international activities - market development, trade agreements and negotiations, and the collection and analysis of statistics and market information. It also administers the USDA export credit guarantee and food aid programs and helps increase income and food availability in developing nations by mobilizing expertise for agriculturally led economic growth. The NRCS provides leadership in a partnership effort to help American private landowners and managers conserve their soil, water, and other natural resources. It also provides financial assistance for many conservation activities. CCC reaches out to all segments of the agricultural community, including underserved and socially disadvantaged farmers and ranchers to ensure that CCC programs and services are accessible to everyone. == See also == * Ever-normal granary * Market Access Program * Quality Samples Program *Technical Assistance for Specialty Crops ==References== ==Further reading== * Executive Order 6340, from the Donnelly Collection, a project of The Conservative Caucus * Government Accountability Office reports on and audits of the Commodity Credit Corporation *CRS Report for Congress: Agriculture: A Glossary of Terms, Programs, and Laws *CRS Report for Congress: The Commodity Credit Corporation: In Brief ==External links== * USDA, Farm Service Agency, Commodity Credit Corporation * Commodity Credit Corporation in the Federal Register Category:Agricultural economics Category:Export credit agencies Category:Corporations chartered by the United States Congress Category:Government-owned companies of the United States Category:New Deal agencies Category:United States Department of Agriculture Category:Agricultural finance ","title":"Commodity Credit Corporation"},{"id":"2545307","text":" The Rolls-Royce Eagle Mk XXII https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1947/1947%20-%200625.html was a British 24-cylinder, sleeve valve, H-block aero engine of 46 litre (2,807 cubic inches) displacement. It was designed and built in the early-1940s by Rolls-Royce Limited and first ran in 1944. It was liquid-cooled, of flat H configuration with two crankshafts and was capable of 3,200 horsepower (2,387 kW) at 18 psi boost. ==Design and development== The Rolls-Royce design team realised that producing a scaled-up version of their Griffon V-12 engine would lead to excessively large combustion chambers and problems with detonation.Rubbra 1990, p. 91. The team concluded that a larger number of small cylinders would be the answer and considered an X-24 design. This layout had previously caused unreliability with the Rolls-Royce Vulture due to the need to fasten four connecting rods in a complicated arrangement to a common big end bearing. The designers finally settled on an 'H' layout with two crankshafts and 'blade and fork' connecting rod attachments, the crankshafts being connected through the propeller speed reduction unit. The new engine followed the layout of the Napier Sabre and similarly used sleeve valves but with a simplified drive system. A two-speed, two-stage supercharger and intercooler were used to compress then cool the air-fuel mixture, following Griffon and Merlin practice. Starting was by Coffman starter. An auxiliary shaft driven by the lower crankshaft operated the main coolant pump, intercooler coolant pump, pressure and scavenge oil pumps and a fuel injection pump. Piston ring failures and cylinder head sealing problems were experienced during early flight testing. ==Applications== The Eagle was never fitted to a production front-line fighter, as it was overshadowed by a new wave of turbojet engines, such as the Rolls-Royce Derwent and turboprops such as the Dart and Armstrong Siddeley Python. Fifteen Eagle 22s were produced to power prototypes of the Westland Wyvern fighter/torpedo bomber due to its intended powerplant, the AS Python being late in development. ==Variants== 46H Eagle I :(1944) - Compression ratio 6.5:1. 46H Eagle II :(1944) - Modified Eagle I. 46H Eagle (20 srs) 22 :(1946-1949) - Increased compression ratio (7:1), 3,500 hp at 3,500 rpm and 28 lb boost.Gunston 2006, p. 191.

(1982) Evolution and the Theory of Games. Cambridge University Press. This population as a whole can be either monomorphic or polymorphic. == History & connection to evolutionary stable strategy == While related to the concept of an evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS), evolutionarily stable states are not identical and the two terms cannot be used interchangeably. An ESS is a strategy that, if adopted by all individuals within a population, cannot be invaded by alternative or mutant strategies. This strategy becomes fixed in the population because alternatives provide no fitness benefit that would be selected for. In comparison, an evolutionarily stable state describes a population that returns as a whole to its previous composition even after being disturbed. In short: the ESS refers to the strategy itself, uninterrupted and supported through natural selection, while the evolutionarily stable state refers more broadly to a population-wide balance of one or more strategies that may be subjected to temporary change.Thomas, B. (1984). Evolutionary stability: States and strategies. Theoretical Population Biology, 26(1), 49-67. https://doi.org/10.1016/0040-5809(84)90023-6 The term ESS was first used by John Maynard Smith in an essay from the 1972 book On Evolution.Maynard Smith, J. (1972). Game Theory and the Evolution of Fighting. On Evolution. Edinburgh University Press. . Maynard Smith developed the ESS drawing in part from game theory and Hamilton’s work on the evolution of sex ratio.Maynard Smith, J., Price, G. R. (1973). The logic of animal conflict. Nature 246 (5427), 15-18. https://doi.org/10.1038/246015a0Maynard Smith, J. (1974). The theory of games and the evolution of animal conflicts. J Theor Biol. 47(1). 209-221.https://doi.org/10.1016/0022-5193(74)90110-6 The ESS was later expanded upon in his book Evolution and the Theory of Games in 1982, which also discussed the evolutionarily stable state. == Mixed v. single strategies == There has been variation in how the term is used and exploration of under what conditions an evolutionarily stable state might exist. In 1984, Benhard Thomas compared “discrete” models in which all individuals use only one strategy to “continuous” models in which individuals employ mixed strategies. While Maynard Smith had originally defined an ESS as being a single “uninvadable strategy,” Thomas generalized this to include a set of multiple strategies employed by individuals. In other words, a collection of simultaneously present strategies could be considered uninvadable as a group. Thomas noted that evolutionary stability can exist in either model, allowing for an evolutionarily stable state to exist even when multiple strategies are used within the population. == Mathematical formulation & evolutionary game theory == The strategy employed by individuals (or ESS) is thought to depend on fitness: the better the strategy is at supporting fitness, the more likely the strategy is to be used. When it comes to an evolutionarily stable state, all of the strategies used within the population must have equal fitness.Taylor, P. D, Jonker, L. B. (1978). Evolutionarily stable states and Game Dynamics. Mathematical Biosciences 40, 145-156. https://doi.org/10.1016/0025-5564(78)90077-9 While the equilibrium may be distrurbed by external factors, the population is considered to be in an evolutionarily stable state if it returns to the equilibrium state after the disturbance. One of the base mathematical models for identifying an evolutionarily stable state was outlined by Taylor & Jonker in 1978. Their base equilibrium model for ES states stipulates that > A state p is called an ESS (evolutionary stable state) if for every state q > ≠ p, if we let p̅ =(1-ε)p + εq (the perturbed state), then F(qp) < F(pp̅) > for sufficiently small ε>0. In greater detail, the Taylor & Jonker model can be understood this way > In a game of individuals in competition with each other there are (N) > possible strategies available. Thus each individual is using one of these > (N) strategies. If we denote each strategy as I we let S_i be the proportion > of individuals who are currently using strategy I. Then S=(S_1 -> S_n) is a > probability vector (i.e. S ≥ 0 and S_1 + S_2……+ S_n = 1) this is called the > state vector of the population. Using this the function F(is) can be made, > F(is) refers to the fitness of I in state S. The state vector of the > population (S) is not static. The idea behind it is that the more fit a > strategy at the moment the more likely it is to be employed in the future, > thus the state vector (S) will change. Using game theory we can look how (S) > changes over time and try to figure out in what state it has reached an > equilibrium. Let K be the set of all probability vectors of length N, this > is the state space of the population. Thus element P in K represents a > possible strategy mix. A state P in K is called an equilibrium state if > F(ip) is equal for all pure strategies i for which P_i > 0, That is, > supp(p) = {i :p,≠0}. If Q is in K: F(qp) + (ΣQ_1 x F(ip). We can see > F(qp) as the expected fitness of an individual using mixed strategy Q > against the population in state P. If P is an equilibrium state and the > supp(q) is contained in supp(p) then F(qp) = F(qp).(supp(p) are the I’s > for which P_i > 0). Thus a state p is called an ESS (evolutionary stable > state) if for every state Q ≠ P, if we let p̅=(1-ε)p + εq (the perturbed > state), then F(qp) < F(pp̅) for sufficiently small ε>0 In summary, a state P is evolutionarily stable whenever a small change from P to state p̅ the expected fitness in the perturbed state is less than the expected fitness of the remaining population. === Additional proposals === It has been suggested by Ross Cressman that criteria for evolutionary stability include strong stability, as it would describe evolution of both frequency and density (whereas Maynard Smith’s model focused on frequency).Cressman, R. (1990). Strong stability and density-dependent evolutionarily stable strategies. Journal of Theoretical Biology, 145(3), 319-330. https://doi.org/10.1016/S0022-5193(05)80112-2 Cressman further demonstrated that in habitat selection games modeling only a single species, the ideal free distribution (IFD) is itself an evolutionarily stable state containing mixed strategies.Cressman, R., & Křivan, V. (2010). The ideal free distribution as an evolutionarily stable state in density‐dependent population games. Oikos, 119(8), 1231-1242. https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0706.2010.17845.x === In evolutionary game theory === Evolutionary game theory as a whole provides a theoretical framework examining interactions of organisms in a system where individuals have repeated interactions within a population that persists on an evolutionarily relevant timescale.Cowden, C. C. (2012) Game Theory, Evolutionary Stable Strategies and the Evolution of Biological Interactions. Nature Education Knowledge 3(10):6. This framework can be used to better understand the evolution of interaction strategies and stable states, though many different specific models have been used under this framework. The Nash Equilibrium (NE) and folk theorem are closely related to the evolutionarily stable state. There are various potential refinements proposed to account for different theory games and behavioral models.Li, J., Kendall, G., and John, R. (2015). Computing Nash Equilibria and Evolutionarily Stable States of Evolutionary Games. IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, 20(3), 460-469.

In particular, the spirelets often built atop the crossings of major churches in mediaeval French Gothic architecture are called flèches. On the ridge of the roof on top of the crossing (the intersection of the nave and the transepts) of a church, flèches were typically light, delicate, timber-framed constructions with a metallic sheath of lead or copper. They are often richly decorated with architectural and sculptural embellishments: tracery, crockets, and miniature buttresses serve to adorn the flèche. Flèches are often very tall: the Gothic Revival spire of Notre-Dame de Paris (18582019) by Eugène Viollet-le-Duc was about before its destruction in the Notre-Dame de Paris fire, while the 16th century flèche of Amiens Cathedral is high. The highest flèche in the world was built at the end of the 19th century for Rouen Cathedral, high in total. A short spire or flèche surrounded by a parapet is common on churches in Hertfordshire; as a result this type of flèche is called a Hertfordshire spike. ==See also== * Flèche faîtière * Ridge turret ==Notes== Category:Architectural elements Category:Church architecture ","title":"Flèche"},{"id":"2545330","text":"Peter-Paul Pigmans (January 31, 1961 - August 27, 2003) was a Dutch gabber music producer, best known for his production under the pseudonym 3 Steps Ahead.

The band's signature sound as well as their prolific writing has been attributed to Billy Childish's love of simple, direct recording. The band has been on multiple labels including Billy's own Hangman Records, Damaged Goods and Sub Pop. The band played their final concert on 12 May 2000 at the Dirty Water Club. Childish went on to play with other bands including The Buff Medways (1999 to 2006) and The Musicians of The British Empire (2007 to 2011). == Lineup == The band was composed of Billy Childish (guitar and vocals), Bruce Brand (drums and backing vocals), and Johnny Johnson (bass). The band is the most prolific of Childish's many musical projects so far, releasing fourteen full-length albums. The group originally featured Allan Crockford (ex-The Prisoners) (credited as Krojack on the first LP, Headcoats Down), followed by John Agnew (ex-Thee Mighty Caesars) then Ollie Dolat (co-founder of The Squares and founder of Mr Zero) on bass before Johnson joined. Thee Headcoatees, an all-female vocal group consisting of Holly Golightly, Kyra LaRubia, Ludella Black, and (until leaving in 1999) Bongo Debbie, would often perform live with Thee Headcoats, and recorded several LPs with them as backing band. The band also recorded two albums as Thee Headcoats Sect, with members of The Downliners Sect. ==Repertoire and influence== Described in the New York Times as 'the king of garage rock', Thee Headcoats had their roots in the British punk scene of the 1970s (both Billy and Bruce playing in The Pop Rivets and The Milkshakes). The band recorded songs by The Clash under the pseudonym Thee Stash. The band also recorded tribute albums to Bo Diddley and Jimmy Reed. Their debut album featured new versions of songs recorded by Son House including \\"John the Revelator\\" and \\"Child's Death Letter\\", both of which were later covered by The White Stripes upon whom Billy and Thee Headcoats were a great influence. These influences give a good indication of the band's sound; punk mixed with pure rhythmic rock 'n' roll and blues. ==Discography== ===Studio albums=== *Headcoats Down!

It is located in the southern corner of the Town Of Poughkeepsie. ==History== ===Early history=== Adolph Brower House, c. 1844 Road records of 1770 show that there were shipping facilities in New Hamburg called “Hood Landing.” Rivermen called the rocky point of land in the angle between the Hudson and the mouth of Wappinger Creek \\"High Point\\" and the area which projected into the river a few miles south \\"Low Point\\" (Chelsea).\\"History\\", New Hamburg YachtClub Lime burning became an important industry. Dr. Benjamin Ely's map of 1797 shows a lime kiln in New Hamburg. By 1800 Ephraim DuBois had settled at High Point. In 1837 he sold his property, including a lime quarry and kiln, to Adolph Brower from New York. Brower's customers were local pig iron producers and farmers and builders as far away as New Jersey, supplied by river boat. He tore down the DuBois house and built his own on the same site about 1844. New Hamburg Yacht Club is now situated approximately where the \\"Old Lime Dock\\" was. The riverfront near the lime kilns was a favorite local bathing area called the \\"Sandy Bottom Shore.” When the railroad was built in the late 1840s, excess stone was tossed onto the naturally sandy beach area. In 1808 John Drake Jr. built a bridge across Wappingers Creek. In 1879 an iron swing-bridge was erected, and continued to be known as \\"Drake's Bridge\\". By 1810 John Drake had relocated to the hamlet where he had docks, a store, and 30 acres of land at High Point, then known as \\"Wappingers Landing\\".Platt, Edmund. \\"Town and City of Poughkeepsie\\", History of Dutchess County, New York, (ed. Frank Hasbrouck), S.A.Mathieu, Poughkeepsie, N.Y. (1909) In the early 1820s, lumber surpassed lime kilns as a business. Charles Millard, who owned a lumber business based in Ulster County, moved to the Landing in 1824 and opened a lumber yard. Since most of the lumber and log shipments were made by water, Millard's son, Walter, branched out into ship building and freighting. He and a partner, Uriah Mills, built the barge Lexington, which carried freight up and down the Hudson River and the steamer Splendid, which carried both freight and passengers. New Hamburg became a port community on the river, with ships loaded and unloaded along nearby Point Street and then taken to Poughkeepsie and Wappingers Falls via road. In 1837, the postmaster was Walter Millard.United States Official Postal Guide, United States. Post Office Department, 1837, p. 116 In 1848 construction began on the Hudson River Railroad in order to expand the Troy and Greenbush Railroad from the Albany area to New York City. In 1848–1849 a cholera epidemic swept through the community of railroad workers. It is recorded that Father J. Scollon, of St. Mary's in nearby Channingville, being called to High Point, labored unceasingly to relieve the sick and the dying. The outbreak caused a number of fatalities among the workers, and construction was delayed. An 800-foot (240 m) tunnel was built through a hillside north of town, and the work being done there triggered the development of Main Street as a commercial area. The river steamer Mary Powell used to stop at New Hamburg in the morning on her way to New York and in the afternoon on the return trip.Smith. James H., History of Dutchess County New York, D.Mason & Sons, Syracuse, 1882 Around 1860 William Shay operated a rag business on the corner of Main Street and Point Street. He would travel up Wappingers Creek to the mills in Wappingers Falls, and obtain rags and cotton waste for transshipment. The hamlet suffered a devastating fire on May 3, 1877, involving the loss of seven buildings. The New Hamburg Yacht Club was originally incorporated in 1869 as an ice boat club. In February 1871, on the railroad drawbridge over the Wappinger Creek along the Hudson between the towns of Poughkeepsie and Wappinger, a train traveling north collided with an oil tank train car heading south. The trains exploded upon impact instantly throwing people, luggage, and train parts into the water. 77 people were missing or unidentified. The number of confirmed deaths was 22. Some bodies were taken to Poughkeepsie for identification; many were never recovered. The area around New Hamburg was the location of a number of country estates such as that of New York City attorney, Francis Robert Rives, which was located on Rives Avenue,Hall, Henry. \\"Francis Robert Rives\\", America's Successful Men of Affairs, New York tribune, 1895, p. 541 as well as that of J. Fisher Sheefe.Transactions of the New-York State Agricultural Society, vol. 6, 1847,p. 681 In 1929 the Children's Aid Society of New York operated a farm school for older boys, at Bowdoin Farm in New Hamburg N.Y. in 1929 to train boys in farm work and give them a taste of what to expect, before placing them as paid laborers on farms in the country.\\"Children’s Aid Society of New York\\", The Social Welfare History Project ==Geography== The latitude of New Hamburg is 41.588N.

This treaty is named after the Byzantine fortress of Devol, modern Albania. Although the treaty was not immediately enforced, it was intended to make the Principality of Antioch a vassal state of the Byzantine Empire. During 1970 significant amounts of water from the river was diverted into the Small Prespa Lake with the intention to use it latter during the summer time for the irrigation purposes. Due to the high suspended solids in the river water significant siltation did occur on the Albanian side. The practice has recently stopped. == See also == * Geography of Albania * Rivers of Albania == References == Category:Rivers of Albania Category:Geography of Berat County Category:Geography of Elbasan County Category:Geography of Korçë County Category:Braided rivers in Albania ","title":"Devoll (river)"},{"id":"2545361","text":"Prettyboy Reservoir is a reservoir in northern Baltimore County, Maryland, also known as the Hereford Zone. Even though the reservoir is in the county, the City of Baltimore owns the reservoir and the surrounding land of forested watershed. The reservoir is one of three reservoirs created to supply the Metropolitan Baltimore municipal water system for Baltimore City, Baltimore County and northern Anne Arundel County constructed by the Baltimore City Department of Public Works. Prettyboy Reservoir, along with Loch Raven Reservoir that is downstream of the Gunpowder Falls, provide about 61% of the drinking water for the Baltimore Metropolitan system. For this reason, the Prettyboy is considered a \\"source water\\" or drinking water watershed. The reservoir on average contains about of water. The water from Prettyboy Reservoir is transferred to Loch Raven Reservoir via Gunpowder Falls rather than directly to Baltimore. It is then transferred via tunnel from Loch Raven to the Montebello Filtration Plants in Baltimore for treatment and distribution. Prettyboy Dam, completed in 1932, impounds the Gunpowder Falls to create the Reservoir. The dam has a spillway crest elevation of of MSL and covers about . Prettyboy Reservoir Dam Prettyboy Reservoir sits behind Prettyboy Dam on the Gunpowder River, which flows into the northwestern Chesapeake Bay. Parts of the Gunpowder River, along with those of its smaller, neighboring Chesapeake Bay tributary, the Little Gunpowder River, also serve as a State Park.

Kayak and tubing enthusiasts float or paddle the Lower Gunpowder Falls from the dam down to Falls Road or Masemore Road. The river between those two points contains mainly Flatwater to class II rapids but one section contains a class III when the water level is normal or higher. Heavy spring rains mean that both gates at the dam may be opened to allow excess water through.

She is a tomboy, and somewhat of a tattletale, often getting her siblings into trouble but still cares very much for them. She is the only monster who flies. * Two (Colin Mochrie): The most helpful of the monsters, Two has a prominent nose which he often \\"sticks in where it doesn't belong\\". In the second episode, \\"Good Night!\\", before Two and his family move to Centerville, he is very troublesome when he leads everyone into a forest full of fairy tales that almost causes them to lose their way home thanks to getting into \\"Snow White\\" and \\"Goldilocks & The Three Bears\\". * Three (Dwayne Hill): The most dramatic monster, Three takes on a new voice and personality in every episode which can often lead to trouble with his brothers and sisters. The only times his normal voice and personality is used are in the episodes \\"Good Night!\\", in a storybook, \\"Are You My Family?\\", the beginning of \\"All's Quiet on the Monster Front\\", and for a few portions of \\"And Baby Makes Eight\\". His normal voice is also heard very briefly in \\"Ahoy, Me Monsters!\\" when he opens up a letter. His normal personality can also be seen at the end of \\"Please Mr. Postman\\", although his normal voice is not heard. His normal personality also is seen in the opening sequence as well as at the end of \\"Good Morning!\\". * Four (Seán Cullen): The middle child who is the epitome of rambunctious angst in his family, he is often seen with his brother Five. Despite his grumpy personality, he deeply loves Five. He often would ask what is Three's new personality for the day and sometimes groans when peeved. * Five (Seán Cullen): The most childlike of the monsters, he speaks very few words and has a thick speech impediment when he does. Five has a voracious appetite and loves his brothers and sisters very much. Sometimes his silly antics annoy Four. He has an enormous tongue which he can control in various ways. He would usually say sorry for every mistake he makes. * Six (Michele Scarabelli): The resident ballerina of the group, Six thinks she is the most beautiful of the monsters. Unlike her sister One, she has more feminine interests. She wears a purple tutu and holds a star wand. She speaks with a Queens accent. * Seven (Seán Cullen): The youngest and tallest member of the family. Seven has the ability to unscrew his head. Despite his frightening appearance, he is the most gentle and timid monster and is afraid of bugs. He also loves cheese, he always asks for the definition of any vocabulary he has never heard before and speaks in a Boris Karloff-esque voice. Seven’s voice is very identical to Eton from George and Martha. * Mom (Debra McGrath): The mother of the seven monsters, she is a kindly, babushka-wearing witch. She is about half the size of her children and speaks with a Polish accent, often with poor sentence structure. * Mary (Tara Strong (uncredited)): The monsters' hippie neighbor and good friend.

His paternal great-grandfather, Ivan Ivanovich Utin, came from serfs and was raised in a wealthy peasant family under the Tabakov surname. His grandfather, Kondratiy Tabakov, worked as a locksmith in Saratov where he built himself a house and married a local commoner Anna Konstantinovna Matveeva. Oleg's father, Pavel Kondratievich Tabakov, worked at the State Regional Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology \\"Microbe\\" in Saratov.Oleg Tabakov, Anatoly Smelyanskiy (2000). My Real Life. — Moscow: Eksmo-Press, pp. 22—48 (Autobiography) His maternal grandfather, Andrei Frantzevich Piontkovsky, was a Polish nobleman who owned lands in the Podolia Governorate and married a local villager, Olga Terentievna (surname unknown) of Ukrainian originСолнечная система Олега Табакова. Oleg's mother, Maria Andreevna Berezovskaya (née Piontkovskaya), was a radiologist. She had a daughter Mirra from the previous marriage to Gugo Goldstern, a high-ranking Soviet functionary and intelligence officer killed in the line of duty.Interview at Echo of Moscow, 11 September 2004 (in Russian) During the Great Patriotic War, Oleg's father volunteered for the frontline and served aboard a hospital train while his mother was evacuated to Ural along with children where she also worked in a military hospital. After the war, the parents separated.Stage Worker interview from the Itogy magazine №36, 6 September 2010 (in Russian) ==Theatre career== Tabakov studied at the Moscow Art Theatre School. Upon graduating, he became one of the founding fathers of the Sovremennik Theatre. He administrated the Sovremennik until 1982, when he moved to the Moscow Art Theatre, where he has played Molière and Salieri for over 20 years. In 1986, Tabakov persuaded his students to form the Tabakov Studio attached to the Moscow Art Theatre. Several notable Russian actors, including Yevgeny Mironov, Sergey Bezrukov, Vladimir Mashkov, Andrey Smolyakov and Alexandre Marine, studied at the studio. Tabakov also worked in numerous foreign countries, spreading his theatre's ideals abroad. ==Film career== Tabakov's movie career paralleled the theatrical. He was featured in Grigori Chukhrai's Clear Skies (1961), Sergei Bondarchuk's War and Peace (1966–67), TV series Seventeen Moments of Spring (1973) and D'Artagnan and Three Musketeers (1978), the Academy Award-winning Moscow Does Not Believe In Tears (1980), Nikita Mikhalkov's Oblomov (1981) and Dark Eyes (1986), and the mock red western A Man from the Boulevard des Capuchines (1987), among others. ==Voice-over work== Tabakov has lent his distinctive, purr-like voice to a number of animated characters, including the talking cat Matroskin in Three from Prostokvashino and its sequels. After the Matroskin role, he dubbed the character of Garfield into Russian in the feature film Garfield. ==Political activism== During the 2012 Russian presidential election, Tabakov was registered as a \\"Trusted Representative\\" (Доверенное Лицо) of Vladimir Putin. In March 2014, he signed a letter in support of the position of the President of Russia Vladimir Putin on Russia's military intervention in Ukraine. In September 2014, Tabakov claimed that Crimea has no relation to Ukraine and upbraided Ukrainians for discussing it: \\"But all happened fairly. If our Ukrainian brothers were smarter, they would not discuss that topic. They had to say: \\"Forgive us for God's sake! We had encroached the gravy train.\\" Because Crimea has no relation to dependent, nor independent Ukraine.\\"Табаков ждет от «украинцев-халявщиков» извинений за Крым .

The law was introduced in 1973, and was last updated in 2003. While the law was never formally repealed, in 2008 a U.S. District Judge released a report declaring it to be \\"facially unconstitutional and unenforceable\\". ==History== In 1973, the Texas Legislature passed Section 43.21 of the Texas Penal Code, which, in part, prohibited the sale or promotion of \\"obscene devices\\"', being defined as \\"a device including a dildo or artificial vagina, designed or marketed as useful primarily for the stimulation of human genital organs.\\" The legislation was last updated in 2003, and Section 43.23 currently states \\"A person commits an offense if, knowing its content and character, he wholesale promotes or possesses with intent to wholesale promote any obscene material or obscene device.\\" ==Prosecuted cases== Prosecution under the statute is rare but has occasionally occurred. In Burleson in 2004, Joanne Webb, a mother of three and a former schoolteacher, faced up to one year in prison for selling a vibrator to two undercover police officers posing as a married couple at a private party. She was later acquitted, and the undercover officers were issued reprimands. In 2007, a lingerie shop in Lubbock was raided, and items \\"deemed to be illegal by the Texas Penal Code\\" were confiscated. The clerk on duty at the time was arrested and may have had to register as a sex offender. In 2001, attorneys Mary and Ted Roberts used the obscenity statute in an elaborate extortion scheme against a number of men who had engaged in extramarital relations with Mary Roberts. ==Appeals== Reliable Consultants, Inc., who operate four retail stores in Texas that carry a stock of sexual devices, and PHE, Inc., which is also engaged in the retail distribution of sexual devices through their website and catalogs, both filed lawsuits against the legislation, claiming that the statute is unconstitutional. In an appeal from the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas, a three-judge panel of the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals overturned the statute on February 12, 2008, by a vote of 2–1, holding that \\"the statute has provisions that violate the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution\\". The State of Texas filed a petition on February 22, 2008, for the Circuit Court to rehear the argument en banc.Print Untitled (55 pages) On July 3, 2008, the Texas 13th District Court of Appeals in Corpus Christi in the case of Villareal vs. State, addressed the ruling of the federal 5th Circuit Court of Appeals. The 13th District Court of Appeals ruled that until the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals rules that 43.23 is unconstitutional, the promotion of obscene devices remains illegal. Therefore, despite the actions of the federal courts and the Texas Attorney General described elsewhere in this article, section 43.23 remains in effect in the twenty-county area of Texas covered by the jurisdiction of the 13th District Court of Appeals. On August 1, 2008, the Fifth Circuit denied Texas's request to re-hear the case en banc. The refusal created a split between federal circuits: the 5th Circuit overturned the Texas law and the 11th Circuit upheld a nearly identical Alabama law. That would usually mean that the United States Supreme Court would grant a writ of certiorari and rule in order to clear up the disagreement between the two circuits. On November 4, 2008, U.S. District Judge Lee Yeakel released a two-page document dated October 29, 2008, in which he stated that the Texas Attorney General's Office notified him that they would not file a writ of certiorari with the Supreme Court. The next month, on November 13, Yeakel filed a \\"joint status report\\" that noted the parties had come to an agreement. \\"Texas Penal Code §§ 43.23, to the extent that it applies to \\"obscene devices\\" as defined in Texas Penal Code § 43.21(a)(7), is declared to be facially unconstitutional and unenforceable throughout the State of Texas\\".https://www.scribd.com/document/322594597/2008-11-13-Texas- Western-Court-Order-Obscenity-Law ==See also== *Anti-Obscenity Enforcement Act (Alabama statute) ==References== ==External links== * Texas statute * Texas Tech University Law School * Austin Chronicle article * PDF Version of Circuit Court Opinion (Rev Mar 10, 2008) * Statutes.legis.state.tx.us Category:Obscenity law Category:Sex toys Category:Texas statutes Category:Sex offender registration Category:1973 legislation Category:1973 in Texas ","title":"Texas obscenity statute"},{"id":"2545427","text":"Cynthia Love is an American entrepreneur and businessperson. She is former executive of publicly traded TORO, academic administrator, author, and ordained minister who has started eight companies, several non profits and served for four years as the Executive Director of the Metropolitan Community Church. During her tenure as MCC's chief operating officer and business manager, Love played a role in the advocacy for human rights around the world. She has also served on the Faith and Religion Council for the Human Rights Campaign. She was awarded the Bohnett Fellowship and attended an executive education program for local and state officials at Harvard's Kennedy School. She and her partner also acquired a new business in 2009, the Natural Food Center, in Abilene, Texas. ==Education and early career== A native of Abilene, Texas, Love holds a Master of Arts from Louisiana Tech, and a doctorate in educational administration from Texas Tech University. She applied her educational training to using technology in the classroom and to forming community-school partnerships; her efforts were recognized by the Texas legislature and by Governor Ann Richards.

Love also spent many years in the business sector, founding such companies as Ecommune, a business intended for advising Fortune 500 companies and technology ventures in Israel, School Vision of Texas, INC 500 member C.H. Love & Co., which was later bought by New Mexico Information Systems, and ICSS, Inc., which was acquired by The Toro Company, for which she guided a project that created a worldwide Intranet network, and served as both director of customer service systems and manager of global customer information systems. From Toro, Love moved to other projects, including being the CEO of Friendly Robotics. Her experience with technology was also called upon by NASA and by the Texas legislature. For her business work, she was named one of the \\"Top 50 Entrepreneurs\\" in North America by Inc. Magazine, MIT and YEO in 1990. She has served on numerous not- for-profit boards and committees for educational, business, and LGBT interests. Love has been the CEO and founder of a number of other corporations, including School Vision of Texas, Network in a Box, Apple Education Assistance Network, New Mexico Information Systems, and Integration Control Systems & Services. ==Ministry== Love grew up in the Church of Christ, was active in citywide ministry programs from a young age, married a minister from the church, but transferred to a Southern Baptist church after her divorce. She was also active in local advocacy groups on issues regarding rehabilitation and disability services, workplace discrimination and HIV/AIDS issues; for instance, she was a long-time director of one of the West Texas Rehabilitation Center's advocacy programs, and she and her spouse later founded the Abilene Community Advocacy Program. She later founded FAMLO, a non-profit organization addressing health issues around drug addiction and HIV/AIDS. and most recently they founded Uncommon Tribe, a non-profit located in Abilene, Texas.

Love was appointed Executive Director of the liberally-oriented (although still based on the Apostle's and Nicene Creeds) Metropolitan Community Church in January 2005. Love is also the author of Would Jesus Discriminate? The 21st Century Question. This book is part of a broader campaign to prompt churches to consider the ways that religious attitudes against homosexuality may contribute to wider discrimination against gays and lesbians. Although the campaign began in 2006, it continues to influence the discussion. News articles from 2009 show that churches are still hosting \\"town halls\\" on the issue in places like Anchorage, Alaska, and that people are still using the slogan at marriage-equality rallies in Bloomington, Indiana and in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. ==Personal== Love has two children from her first marriage. In 2005 she married Sue Jennings in Canada after the country introduced legislation permitting same-sex marriages. They later announced plans to marry under Californian law at a ceremony to be conducted in Los Angeles on June 24, 2008. ==References== ==External links== * Gay Religious Leader Addresses Congressional Summit on Katrina Relief * Would Jesus Discriminate? project website Category:LGBT Protestant clergy Category:LGBT rights activists from the United States Category:Living people Category:Metropolitan Community Church clergy Category:Abilene Christian University alumni Category:People from Abilene, Texas Category:Louisiana Tech University alumni Category:Texas Tech University alumni Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:American business executives Category:Activists from Texas ","title":"Cindi Love"},{"id":"2545433","text":"Ictonyx is a genus in the family Mustelidae (weasels).

It is still currently shown in syndication (depending on the area) and was regularly shown on Sprout until 2011. A total of 65 episodes were aired. A creation of the Kratt Brothers (Chris and Martin), it features a talking lemur (a Coquerel's sifaka) named Zoboomafoo, voiced by Ottawa-born puppeteer Gord Robertson (who had also puppeteered on Fraggle Rock), and mainly portrayed by a lemur named Jovian, along with a collection of repeat animal guests. Every episode begins with the Kratt brothers in Animal Junction, a peculiar place in which the rules of nature change and wild animals come to visit and play. After January 16, 2004, the series was pulled from its weekday airing on most PBS stations, though some PBS stations continue to air it. The show is/was broadcast in the US, Canada, Latin America, Brazil, Australia, Spain, the UK, Ireland, France, Germany, Portugal, Belgium, The Netherlands, the Middle East, India and Serbia, Montenegro, Bosnia & Herzegovina and the Republic of North Macedonia in the Serbian language. On November 10, 2014, Jovian died in his home at the Duke Lemur Center in Durham, North Carolina at the age of 20. ==Premise and structure== Upon their arrival at Animal Junction, the Kratt brothers (Chris and Martin Kratt) lean out the window and call Zoboomafoo (or \\"Zoboo\\" for short, and occasionally \\"Zob\\"), shown in a live-action segment as an actual lemur (Jovian) leaping across a field to reach them. When the lemur reaches Animal Junction, he won't talk to the Kratt brothers until they give him a snack, generally lemur appropriate food like garbanzo beans, sweet potato or mango slices. After he's done eating his snack, he promptly burps, saying, \\"Excuse me,\\" and then spins around on a turntable, shouting, \\"Zoboomafoo-oo- oo-oo!\\" at which point he becomes a talking lemur puppet (voiced by Robertson). He then leads into the main segment of the episode by describing a \\"Mangatsika!\\" (a Malagasy word literally meaning \\"cold\\", but used in the series to mean \\"cool\\") animal that he saw on his way to Animal Junction. As he describes the animal, a song is played, \\"Who Could It Be?\\", while a cartoon shows the characteristics of the \\"mystery animal\\". At the end of the song, Chris and Martin try to guess the animal Zoboo has described and the mystery is revealed when the animal or animals arrive at Animal Junction. Each episode has a theme. For example, baby animals, frightening animals or the importance of play. The arrival of the \\"mystery animal,\\" generally used as exposition, leads Zoboo, Chris and Martin into a conversation about the animal. At least once every episode (twice in most episodes), Zoboo says that some event in Animal Junction reminds him of a time in Zobooland, where he tell stories about his best friends in Zobooland, such as Narchi (an anteater-like creature), Gooble (a bear-like creature that eats goobleberries), Sensit (a lemur that typically plays around), Wiggy Waxwing (a bird-like creature who likes to sing and eat root noodles), Green Puppy (a green puppy as the name implies), Slimantha (a salamander-like creature), Noggin Drill (a mole-like creature that uses his drill-shaped horn), Snow Lemur (a lemur that lives on a mountain), Baby Zoboomafooasaurus and Mama Zoboomafooasaurus (dinosaurs, who appear in CGI, that the animals often play on), Buggly (a bug that Zoboo rides on), Fibby (a sea creature with several parts including a tentacle and a crab leg) and Cy (a levitating one-eyed squid introduced in the second season). These segments are animated, using clay animation and feature distinct voices for each character. After the first Zobooland story, Zoboo, Chris and Martin receive a letter from the Animal Helpers (Jackie in the first season and Amy in the second season), who show children how to help animals. This leads into Chris and Martin going out to visit creatures related to the theme, always beginning with the song \\"Going to the Closet\\" sung by Zoboo. At the end of each episode, Zoboo and the brothers sign off by singing \\"Animal Friends\\", a song that explains why animals are friends to everyone, despite being different species. Finally, Zoboo turns back into a normal lemur and returns to his home in Madagascar. Chris and Martin also leave Animal Junction to better demonstrate the theme of the day, traveling to a region, often in India or Africa, to visit the creatures there. Before the credits of each episode, kids show and tell the viewers about various animals and pets they have, and a disclaimer is played telling the viewers that they should be careful with the animals they meet. Then Chris and Martin mention animal facts that lead Zoboo to a joke. Example: \\"Knock knock. Who's there? Panther. Panther who? Panther no pants, I'm going swimming!\\". The disclaimer and joke were edited out for non-PBS airings (including On Demand viewings and PBS Kids Sprout). ==Cast== * Chris Kratt as himself * Martin Kratt as himself * Gord Robertson as Zoboomafoo (voice) ** Jovian as Zoboomafoo * Samantha Tolkacz as Jackie (Season 1) * Genevieve Farrell as Amy (Season 2) ==Episodes== ===Running gags=== The series has some forms of slapstick and situation comedy as well. It starts when Zoboo burps after eating a snack, saying, \\"Excuse me,\\" and then spins around on a turntable, shouting, \\"Zoboomafoo-oo-oo-oo!\\" Running gags of the series include Chris and Martin (and sometimes, Zoboo) falling into a swimming pool, a mud puddle and even simply falling down. The most prominent of these recurring jokes, the \\"closet\\" gag, involves a crammed closet that Chris and Martin open to gather needed items for an exploration. As Zoboo sings a song about the brothers' preparations for going on a trip, Chris and Martin open the door and an avalanche of outdoor items and clothes fall on them, knocking them over and resulting in laughter from them. Then they emerge from the pile of gear, fully equipped for their trip. In the episode \\"Running\\", Chris and Martin open the closet, expecting to be buried under its contents, only to find a clean and organized closet. A form of slapstick comedy shown in the series is when Zoboo or the brothers get hit by flying items, such as pies, balls and even yarn thrown by animals. Also, just before the trip, there is always a bird that flies down towards Animal Junction, making Chris and Martin yell, \\"Incoming! Duck!\\" Very rare in the show's history was the bird a real duck. It is often a peregrine falcon named Sticky Feet or an barn owl named Moon Face. Some of Zoboo's catchphrases include \\"Mangatsika!\\" (a malagasy phrase meaning \\"Cool!\\"), \\"I meant to do that!\\", \\"I can't believe my mind!\\", \\"I'm voky!\\" and \\"Hey! Hoo! Hubba hubba!\\". ===Animal Helpers=== Another segment of the series features a group of children known as the \\"Animal Helpers,\\" who send messages to the Kratt brothers at Animal Junction through a series of birds: a turkey vulture (named Tomatohead), an barn owl (named Moonface), a lanner falcon (named Sandstorm), a peregrine falcon (named Stickyfeet), a great horned owl (named Blink), a saker falcon, a golden eagle (named Talon), a duck, a snowy owl, a crow and several others. The letters lead into short stories illustrating the Animal Helpers' interactions with the animals in their environments, performing small tasks such as placing a baby bird back in its nest or leading a calf back to a mother cow. Samantha Tolkacz appeared on the series as Jackie from its debut on January 25, 1999 until April 27, 1999, at which point Genevieve Farrell replaced her, appearing as Amy for the rest of the series' run. Zoboomafoo would also give the animals interesting names that have to do with their appearance, behavior or personality. Examples include: A baby Indian elephant named \\"Toothbrush\\" because of his bristly hair; a young female chimpanzee named \\"Brainiac\\" because chimps are very intelligent; and two sloths named \\"Slow\\" and \\"Slower.\\" ==Production notes== Zoboomafoo was produced by PBS KIDS, Cinar Corporation (now Cookie Jar Entertainment), and the Kratt brothers' Earth Creatures Company. Partial filming for the series took place on location at the Duke Lemur Center in Durham, North Carolina. Although the last new episode aired on PBS KIDS in November 2001, most PBS stations continued to rerun Zoboomafoo episodes in syndication until January 2004. In addition, Sprout aired reruns until July 2011. In 2003, the Kratt Brothers began another series titled Be the Creature on the National Geographic Channel, then began a new children's animated series Wild Kratts in January 2011, which currently airs on PBS KIDS and TVOntario, among others. Jovian, a captive Coquerel's sifaka housed at the Duke Lemur Center, portrayed Zoboomafoo in the live- action segments (along with stand-ins). On November 10, 2014, Jovian died of kidney failure in his home at age 20. ==Awards and nominations== Zoboomafoo received the 2001 Emmy for Outstanding Directing in a Children's Series and a Parents' Choice Award for Spring 2001 and Silver Honor for Fall 2001. ==Other media== There are also several video games for the PC based on Zoboomafoo, where children learn the alphabet and animals that correlate to each letter. Some of the letters have interactive games to go with them, such as a coloring page. ==ReferencesCategory:1990s Canadian children's television series Category:1990s American children's comedy television series Category:1990s Canadian comedy television series Category:1999 American television series debuts Category:1999 Canadian television series debuts Category:2000s American children's comedy television series Category:2000s Canadian children's television series Category:2000s Canadian comedy television series Category:2001 American television series endings Category:2001 Canadian television series endings Category:American children's fantasy television series Category:Canadian children's comedy television series Category:Canadian children's fantasy television series Category:English-language television shows Category:Fictional primates Category:PBS Kids shows Category:PBS original programming Category:Treehouse TV original programming Category:TVOntario original programming Category:Nature educational television series Category:American preschool education television series Category:Canadian preschool education television series Category:American television shows featuring anthropomorphic characters Category:Canadian television shows featuring anthropomorphic characters Category:American television shows featuring puppetry Category:Canadian television shows featuring puppetry Category:Clay animation television series Category:Television series by Cookie Jar Entertainment Category:American television series with live action and animation Category:Canadian television series with live action and animation Category:Television series about brothers Category:Television shows about apes Category:Television series about bears Category:Television series about elephants Category:Television series about penguins Category:American television spin-offs Category:Canadian television spin-offs Category:Television series created by Chris Kratt Category:Television series created by Martin Kratt ","title":"Zoboomafoo"},{"id":"2545444","text":"{ +SS Red Oak Victory } SS Red Oak Victory is a U.S. military Victory ship of the used in the Second World War. She was preserved to serve as a museum ship in Richmond, California, and is part of the Rosie the Riveter/World War II Home Front National Historical Park. She was one of 534 Victories built during World War II, but one of only a few of these ships to be transferred from the Merchant Marine to the United States Navy. She was named after Red Oak, Iowa, which suffered a disproportionate number of casualties in early World War II battles. (Montgomery County ranked third among Iowa counties in World War II casualties per capita). The ship was active during World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War. ==History== Red Oak Victory was built by the Permanente Metals Corporation's Richmond Number 1 Yard in Richmond, California and launched on 9 November 1944. Victory ships were not intended to be long lasting, but the welds of the Red Oak Victory are still intact after 60 years. The ship is in length, and armed with one five-inch/38 caliber gun; one three-inch/50 caliber gun, and eight 20 mm guns. The ship was acquired by the United States Navy on 5 December 1944 and commissioned the same day as USS Red Oak Victory (AK-235). Following a fitting-out period, Red Oak Victory was loaded with cargo and departed San Francisco for Pearl Harbor on 10 January 1945. Red Oak Victory departed Hawaii on 10 February loaded with munitions needed in the Marshall and Caroline islands. Sent onward from Enewetak, she arrived in Ulithi on 28 February, and then began operating under Commander Service Squadron Ten. Operating out of the Philippines, she issued cargo and ammunition to various ships in the fleet through the end of the war in August 1945. During a hazardous tour of duty in the Pacific, Red Oak Victory handled many tons of ammunition, supplying the fleet without a single casualty. Red Oak Victory was decommissioned in 1946 and returned to the U.S. Maritime Commission. Red Oak Victory was used by the Luckenbach Steamship Company from 1947 through the 1950s, during which time the vessel went to Japan, Korea, Cuba, Pakistan, India, Singapore and Japan again. Red Oak Victory was operated by American Mail Lines for the Military Sea Transport Service from 1966 to 1968, making a dozen voyages to Vietnam, Japan and the Philippines carrying military supplies loaded at West Coast ports. From 1968 until 1998, she was laid up in the National Defense Reserve Fleet in Suisun Bay. Destined to be scrapped, Red Oak Victory came to the attention of the Richmond Museum Association in 1993. In 1996 Congress passed legislation authorizing the conveyance of the ship to the Museum Association. Red Oak Victory was turned over to the Richmond Museum of History and returned to a new home in Richmond on 20 September 1998. She is being restored and operated by the Richmond Museum of History, and is part of the Rosie the Riveter/World War II Home Front National Historical Park. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Contra Costa County, California ==References== * * ** ==External links== *http://www.redoakvictory.us} SS Red Oak Victory website *Red Oak Victory Historic Naval Ships Association * Category:Victory ships Category:Boulder Victory-class cargo ships Category:Ships built in Richmond, California Category:1944 ships Category:Ammunition ships of the United States Navy Category:United States Navy Iowa-related ships Category:World War II auxiliary ships of the United States Category:Museum ships in California Category:Ships on the National Register of Historic Places in California Category:National Register of Historic Places in Richmond, California Category:Military and war museums in California Category:Museums in Contra Costa County, California Category:Naval museums in the United States Category:History of Contra Costa County, California Category:Tourist attractions in Richmond, California Category:Rosie the Riveter/World War II Home Front National Historical Park Category:Historic American Engineering Record in California Category:World War II on the National Register of Historic Places in California Category:James River Reserve Fleet Category:Astoria Reserve Fleet Category:Suisun Bay Reserve Fleet ","title":"SS Red Oak Victory"},{"id":"2545455","text":"A geodesic on an American football illustrating the proof of Gromov's filling area conjecture in the hyperelliptic case (see explanation below). In mathematics, systolic geometry is the study of systolic invariants of manifolds and polyhedra, as initially conceived by Charles Loewner and developed by Mikhail Gromov, Michael Freedman, Peter Sarnak, Mikhail Katz, Larry Guth, and others, in its arithmetical, ergodic, and topological manifestations. See also a slower-paced Introduction to systolic geometry. ==The notion of systole== Shortest loop on a torus The systole of a compact metric space X is a metric invariant of X, defined to be the least length of a noncontractible loop in X (i.e. a loop that cannot be contracted to a point in the ambient space X). In more technical language, we minimize length over free loops representing nontrivial conjugacy classes in the fundamental group of X. When X is a graph, the invariant is usually referred to as the girth, ever since the 1947 article on girth by W. T. Tutte. Possibly inspired by Tutte's article, Loewner started thinking about systolic questions on surfaces in the late 1940s, resulting in a 1950 thesis by his student Pao Ming Pu. The actual term \\"systole\\" itself was not coined until a quarter century later, by Marcel Berger. This line of research was, apparently, given further impetus by a remark of René Thom, in a conversation with Berger in the library of Strasbourg University during the 1961-62 academic year, shortly after the publication of the papers of R. Accola and C. Blatter. Referring to these systolic inequalities, Thom reportedly exclaimed: Mais c'est fondamental! [These results are of fundamental importance!] Subsequently, Berger popularized the subject in a series of articles and books, most recently in the March 2008 issue of the Notices of the American Mathematical Society (see reference below). A bibliography at the Website for systolic geometry and topology currently contains over 160 articles. Systolic geometry is a rapidly developing field, featuring a number of recent publications in leading journals. Recently (see the 2006 paper by Katz and Rudyak below), the link with the Lusternik–Schnirelmann category has emerged. The existence of such a link can be thought of as a theorem in systolic topology. ==Property of a centrally symmetric polyhedron in 3-space== Every convex centrally symmetric polyhedron P in R3 admits a pair of opposite (antipodal) points and a path of length L joining them and lying on the boundary ∂P of P, satisfying : L^2 \\\\leq \\\\frac{\\\\pi}{4} \\\\mathrm{area}(\\\\partial P). An alternative formulation is as follows. Any centrally symmetric convex body of surface area A can be squeezed through a noose of length \\\\sqrt{\\\\pi A}, with the tightest fit achieved by a sphere. This property is equivalent to a special case of Pu's inequality (see below), one of the earliest systolic inequalities. ==Concepts== To give a preliminary idea of the flavor of the field, one could make the following observations. The main thrust of Thom's remark to Berger quoted above appears to be the following. Whenever one encounters an inequality relating geometric invariants, such a phenomenon in itself is interesting; all the more so when the inequality is sharp (i.e., optimal). The classical isoperimetric inequality is a good example. A torus In systolic questions about surfaces, integral-geometric identities play a particularly important role. Roughly speaking, there is an integral identity relating area on the one hand, and an average of energies of a suitable family of loops on the other. By the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality, energy is an upper bound for length squared; hence one obtains an inequality between area and the square of the systole. Such an approach works both for the Loewner inequality : \\\\mathrm{sys}^2 \\\\le \\\\frac{2}{\\\\sqrt{3}}\\\\cdot\\\\mathrm{area} for the torus, where the case of equality is attained by the flat torus whose deck transformations form the lattice of Eisenstein integers, An animation of the Roman surface representing P2(R) in R3 and for Pu's inequality for the real projective plane P2(R): : \\\\mathrm{sys}^2 \\\\le \\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2}\\\\cdot\\\\mathrm{area}, with equality characterizing a metric of constant Gaussian curvature. An application of the computational formula for the variance in fact yields the following version of Loewner's torus inequality with isosystolic defect: :\\\\mathrm{area}-\\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\\\mathrm{sys}^2\\\\geq \\\\mathrm{var}(f), where f is the conformal factor of the metric with respect to a unit area flat metric in its conformal class. This inequality can be thought of as analogous to Bonnesen's inequality with isoperimetric defect, a strengthening of the isoperimetric inequality. A number of new inequalities of this type have recently been discovered, including universal volume lower bounds. More details appear at systoles of surfaces. ==Gromov's systolic inequality== The deepest result in the field is Gromov's inequality for the homotopy 1-systole of an essential n-manifold M: : \\\\operatorname{sys\\\\pi}_1{}^n \\\\leq C_n \\\\operatorname{vol}(M), where Cn is a universal constant only depending on the dimension of M. Here the homotopy systole sysπ1 is by definition the least length of a noncontractible loop in M. A manifold is called essential if its fundamental class [M] represents a nontrivial class in the homology of its fundamental group. The proof involves a new invariant called the filling radius, introduced by Gromov, defined as follows. Denote by A the coefficient ring Z or Z2, depending on whether or not M is orientable. Then the fundamental class, denoted [M], of a compact n-dimensional manifold M is a generator of H_n(M;A)=A. Given an imbedding of M in Euclidean space E, we set : \\\\mathrm{FillRad}(M\\\\subset E) = \\\\inf \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\epsilon > 0 \\\\left\\\\;\\\\iota_\\\\epsilon([M])=0\\\\in H_n(U_\\\\epsilon M) \\\\right. \\\\right\\\\\\\\}, where ιε is the inclusion homomorphism induced by the inclusion of M in its ε-neighborhood Uε M in E. To define an absolute filling radius in a situation where M is equipped with a Riemannian metric g, Gromov proceeds as follows. One exploits an imbedding due to C. Kuratowski. One imbeds M in the Banach space L∞(M) of bounded Borel functions on M, equipped with the sup norm \\\\\\\\;\\\\. Namely, we map a point x ∈ M to the function fx ∈ L∞(M) defined by the formula fx(y) = d(x,y) for all y ∈ M, where d is the distance function defined by the metric. By the triangle inequality we have d(x,y) = \\\\ f_x - f_y \\\\, and therefore the imbedding is strongly isometric, in the precise sense that internal distance and ambient distance coincide. Such a strongly isometric imbedding is impossible if the ambient space is a Hilbert space, even when M is the Riemannian circle (the distance between opposite points must be π, not 2!). We then set E = L∞(M) in the formula above, and define :\\\\mathrm{FillRad}(M)=\\\\mathrm{FillRad} \\\\left( M\\\\subset L^{\\\\infty}(M) \\\\right). Namely, Gromov proved a sharp inequality relating the systole and the filling radius, :\\\\mathrm{sys\\\\pi}_1 \\\\leq 6\\\\; \\\\mathrm{FillRad}(M), valid for all essential manifolds M; as well as an inequality :\\\\mathrm{FillRad} \\\\leq C_n \\\\mathrm{vol}_n{}^{1/n}(M), valid for all closed manifolds M. A summary of a proof, based on recent results in geometric measure theory by S. Wenger, building upon earlier work by L. Ambrosio and B. Kirchheim, appears in Section 12.2 of the book \\"Systolic geometry and topology\\" referenced below. A completely different approach to the proof of Gromov's inequality was recently proposed by Larry Guth. ==Gromov's stable inequality== A significant difference between 1-systolic invariants (defined in terms of lengths of loops) and the higher, k-systolic invariants (defined in terms of areas of cycles, etc.) should be kept in mind. While a number of optimal systolic inequalities, involving the 1-systoles, have by now been obtained, just about the only optimal inequality involving purely the higher k-systoles is Gromov's optimal stable 2-systolic inequality : \\\\mathrm{stsys}_2{}^n \\\\leq n! \\\\;\\\\mathrm{vol}_{2n}(\\\\mathbb{CP}^n) for complex projective space, where the optimal bound is attained by the symmetric Fubini–Study metric, pointing to the link to quantum mechanics. Here the stable 2-systole of a Riemannian manifold M is defined by setting :\\\\mathrm{stsys}_2 = \\\\lambda_1\\\\left(H_2(M,\\\\mathbb{Z})_{\\\\mathbb{R}}, \\\\\\\\;\\\\\\\\right), where \\\\\\\\;\\\\ is the stable norm, while λ1 is the least norm of a nonzero element of the lattice. Just how exceptional Gromov's stable inequality is, only became clear recently. Namely, it was discovered that, contrary to expectation, the symmetric metric on the quaternionic projective plane is not its systolically optimal metric, in contrast with the 2-systole in the complex case. While the quaternionic projective plane with its symmetric metric has a middle- dimensional stable systolic ratio of 10/3, the analogous ratio for the symmetric metric of the complex projective 4-space gives the value 6, while the best available upper bound for such a ratio of an arbitrary metric on both of these spaces is 14. This upper bound is related to properties of the Lie algebra E7. If there exists an 8-manifold with exceptional Spin(7) holonomy and 4-th Betti number 1, then the value 14 is in fact optimal. Manifolds with Spin(7) holonomy have been studied intensively by Dominic Joyce. ==Lower bounds for 2-systoles== Similarly, just about the only nontrivial lower bound for a k-systole with k = 2, results from recent work in gauge theory and J-holomorphic curves. The study of lower bounds for the conformal 2-systole of 4-manifolds has led to a simplified proof of the density of the image of the period map, by Jake Solomon. ==Schottky problem== Perhaps one of the most striking applications of systoles is in the context of the Schottky problem, by P. Buser and P. Sarnak, who distinguished the Jacobians of Riemann surfaces among principally polarized abelian varieties, laying the foundation for systolic arithmetic. ==Lusternik–Schnirelmann category== Asking systolic questions often stimulates questions in related fields. Thus, a notion of systolic category of a manifold has been defined and investigated, exhibiting a connection to the Lusternik–Schnirelmann category (LS category). Note that the systolic category (as well as the LS category) is, by definition, an integer. The two categories have been shown to coincide for both surfaces and 3-manifolds. Moreover, for orientable 4-manifolds, systolic category is a lower bound for LS category. Once the connection is established, the influence is mutual: known results about LS category stimulate systolic questions, and vice versa. The new invariant was introduced by Katz and Rudyak (see below). Since the invariant turns out to be closely related to the Lusternik- Schnirelman category (LS category), it was called systolic category. Systolic category of a manifold M is defined in terms of the various k-systoles of M. Roughly speaking, the idea is as follows. Given a manifold M, one looks for the longest product of systoles which give a \\"curvature-free\\" lower bound for the total volume of M (with a constant independent of the metric). It is natural to include systolic invariants of the covers of M in the definition, as well. The number of factors in such a \\"longest product\\" is by definition the systolic category of M. For example, Gromov showed that an essential n-manifold admits a volume lower bound in terms of the n'th power of the homotopy 1-systole (see section above). It follows that the systolic category of an essential n-manifold is precisely n. In fact, for closed n-manifolds, the maximal value of both the LS category and the systolic category is attained simultaneously. Another hint at the existence of an intriguing relation between the two categories is the relation to the invariant called the cuplength. Thus, the real cuplength turns out to be a lower bound for both categories. Systolic category coincides with the LS category in a number of cases, including the case of manifolds of dimensions 2 and 3. In dimension 4, it was recently shown that the systolic category is a lower bound for the LS category. ==Systolic hyperbolic geometry== The study of the asymptotic behavior for large genus g of the systole of hyperbolic surfaces reveals some interesting constants. Thus, Hurwitz surfaces Σg defined by a tower of principal congruence subgroups of the (2,3,7) hyperbolic triangle group satisfy the bound : \\\\mathrm{sys}\\\\pi_1(\\\\Sigma_g) \\\\geq \\\\frac{4}{3} \\\\log g, and a similar bound holds for more general arithmetic Fuchsian groups. This 2007 result by Katz, Schaps, and Vishne generalizes the results of Peter Sarnak and Peter Buser in the case of arithmetic groups defined over Q, from their seminal 1994 paper (see below). A bibliography for systoles in hyperbolic geometry currently numbers forty articles. Interesting examples are provided by the Bolza surface, Klein quartic, Macbeath surface, First Hurwitz triplet. ==Relation to Abel-Jacobi maps== A family of optimal systolic inequalities is obtained as an application of the techniques of Burago and Ivanov, exploiting suitable Abel-Jacobi maps, defined as follows. Let M be a manifold, π = π1(M), its fundamental group and f: π → πab be its abelianisation map. Let tor be the torsion subgroup of πab. Let g: πab → πab/tor be the quotient by torsion. Clearly, πab/tor= Zb, where b = b1 (M). Let φ: π → Zb be the composed homomorphism. > Definition: The cover \\\\bar M of the manifold M corresponding the subgroup > Ker(φ) ⊂ π is called the universal (or maximal) free abelian cover. Now assume M has a Riemannian metric. Let E be the space of harmonic 1-forms on M, with dual E* canonically identified with H1(M,R). By integrating an integral harmonic 1-form along paths from a basepoint x0 ∈ M, we obtain a map to the circle R/Z = S1. Similarly, in order to define a map M → H1(M,R)/H1(M,Z)R without choosing a basis for cohomology, we argue as follows. Let x be a point in the universal cover \\\\tilde{M} of M. Thus x is represented by a point of M together with a path c from x0 to it. By integrating along the path c, we obtain a linear form, h\\\\to \\\\int_c h, on E. We thus obtain a map \\\\tilde{M}\\\\to E^* = H_1(M,\\\\mathbf{R}), which, furthermore, descends to a map : \\\\overline{A}_M: \\\\overline{M}\\\\to E^*,\\\\;\\\\; c\\\\mapsto \\\\left(h\\\\mapsto \\\\int_c h \\\\right), where \\\\overline{M} is the universal free abelian cover. > Definition: The Jacobi variety (Jacobi torus) of M is the torus J1(M)= > H1(M,R)/H1(M,Z)R > Definition: The Abel-Jacobi map A_M: M \\\\to J_1(M), is obtained from the map > above by passing to quotients. The Abel-Jacobi map is unique up to > translations of the Jacobi torus. As an example one can cite the following inequality, due to D. Burago, S. Ivanov and M. Gromov. Let M be an n-dimensional Riemannian manifold with first Betti number n, such that the map from M to its Jacobi torus has nonzero degree. Then M satisfies the optimal stable systolic inequality : \\\\mathrm{stsys}_1{}^{n} \\\\leq \\\\gamma_n \\\\mathrm{vol}_n(M), where \\\\gamma_n is the classical Hermite constant. ==Related fields, volume entropy== Asymptotic phenomena for the systole of surfaces of large genus have been shown to be related to interesting ergodic phenomena, and to properties of congruence subgroups of arithmetic groups. Gromov's 1983 inequality for the homotopy systole implies, in particular, a uniform lower bound for the area of an aspherical surface in terms of its systole. Such a bound generalizes the inequalities of Loewner and Pu, albeit in a non-optimal fashion. Gromov's seminal 1983 paper also contains asymptotic bounds relating the systole and the area, which improve the uniform bound (valid in all dimensions). It was discovered recently (see paper by Katz and Sabourau below) that the volume entropy h, together with A. Katok's optimal inequality for h, is the \\"right\\" intermediary in a transparent proof of M. Gromov's asymptotic bound for the systolic ratio of surfaces of large genus. The classical result of A. Katok states that every metric on a closed surface M with negative Euler characteristic satisfies an optimal inequality relating the entropy and the area. It turns out that the minimal entropy of a closed surface can be related to its optimal systolic ratio. Namely, there is an upper bound for the entropy of a systolically extremal surface, in terms of its systole. By combining this upper bound with Katok's optimal lower bound in terms of the volume, one obtains a simpler alternative proof of Gromov's asymptotic estimate for the optimal systolic ratio of surfaces of large genus. Furthermore, such an approach yields an improved multiplicative constant in Gromov's theorem. As an application, this method implies that every metric on a surface of genus at least 20 satisfies Loewner's torus inequality. This improves the best earlier estimate of 50 which followed from an estimate of Gromov's. ==Filling area conjecture== Gromov's filling area conjecture has been proved in a hyperelliptic setting (see reference by Bangert et al. below). The filling area conjecture asserts that among all possible fillings of the Riemannian circle of length 2π by a surface with the strongly isometric property, the round hemisphere has the least area. Here the Riemannian circle refers to the unique closed 1-dimensional Riemannian manifold of total 1-volume 2π and Riemannian diameter π. To explain the conjecture, we start with the observation that the equatorial circle of the unit 2-sphere, S2 ⊂ R3, is a Riemannian circle S1 of length 2π and diameter π. More precisely, the Riemannian distance function of S1 is the restriction of the ambient Riemannian distance on the sphere. This property is not satisfied by the standard imbedding of the unit circle in the Euclidean plane, where a pair of opposite points are at distance 2, not π. We consider all fillings of S1 by a surface, such that the restricted metric defined by the inclusion of the circle as the boundary of the surface is the Riemannian metric of a circle of length 2π. The inclusion of the circle as the boundary is then called a strongly isometric imbedding of the circle. In 1983 Gromov conjectured that the round hemisphere gives the \\"best\\" way of filling the circle among all filling surfaces. The case of simply-connected fillings is equivalent to Pu's inequality. Recently the case of genus-1 fillings was settled affirmatively, as well (see reference by Bangert et al. below). Namely, it turns out that one can exploit a half-century old formula by J. Hersch from integral geometry. Namely, consider the family of figure-8 loops on a football, with the self- intersection point at the equator (see figure at the beginning of the article). Hersch's formula expresses the area of a metric in the conformal class of the football, as an average of the energies of the figure-8 loops from the family. An application of Hersch's formula to the hyperelliptic quotient of the Riemann surface proves the filling area conjecture in this case. Other systolic ramifications of hyperellipticity have been identified in genus 2. ==Surveys== The surveys in the field include M. Berger's survey (1993), Gromov's survey (1996), Gromov's book (1999), Berger's panoramic book (2003), as well as Katz's book (2007). These references may help a beginner enter the field. They also contain open problems to work on. ==See also== *Systoles of surfaces *Loewner's torus inequality *Pu's inequality *Filling area conjecture *Gromov's inequality for complex projective space *Gromov's systolic inequality for essential manifolds *First Hurwitz triplet *List of differential geometry topics *Systolic freedom *Girth (functional analysis) ==Notes== ==References== * Bangert, V.; Croke, C.; Ivanov, S.; Katz, M.: Filling area conjecture and ovalless real hyperelliptic surfaces.

It resolves the long-running story arcs of the Goa'uld, the Replicators, and the Jaffa Rebellion, and are regarded as two of the most popular episodes of the series. This episode was nominated for an Emmy Award in the category \\"Outstanding Special Visual Effects for a Series\\" and a Leo Award in the category \\"Best Visual Effects\\".) ==Plot== ===Part 1=== The episode begins with an emissary of Ba'al demanding the surrender of Yu and the remaining Goa'uld System Lords. Unexpectedly, Samantha Carter is brought before them, revealing herself to be Replicator Carter as she stabs Yu and her Replicator ship advances on the Goa'uld space station. Elsewhere, SG-1 and Bra'tac are preparing for a rebel Jaffa mission when they come under attack by a Replicator-controlled Ha'tak. Their ship becomes infested, and Jackson is beamed away by the Replicators. At Stargate Command, Jacob Carter, host to the Tok'ra Selmak, brings grave news to General Jack O'Neill: the Replicators have begun a full-scale invasion of the Milky Way. Thor of the Asgard arrives to assist in modifying the Replicator disruptor so that it is once again effective. Although he and Carter successfully modify the disruptor, the Replicators adapt after only a single shot and infest Thor's ship. Meanwhile, Teal'c and Bra'tac are dismayed that, in the face of this unstoppable foe, the Jaffa are re-pledging their loyalty to the Goa'uld en masse and the future of the Jaffa rebellion is in doubt. They decide on an audacious, last-ditch plan: with Ba'al's forces occupied and fighting the Replicators, the entire rebel army will capture Dakara, the holiest of Jaffa planets, thus proving once and for all that the Goa'uld are not gods. The rebel Jaffa find the planet lightly guarded and quickly seize its temple. However, at the behest of a robed figure, Ba'al breaks off the battle with the Replicators and sends his entire fleet towards Dakara. On the Replicator ship, Replicator Carter probes Daniel's mind for buried knowledge from the time he was Ascended. After a ruse in which she pretends to be Oma Desala, she finds what she wants: the location of the only weapon in the galaxy capable of stopping her, hidden in the temple on Dakara. Ba'al contacts the SGC and tells them that they must destroy the weapon on Dakara before his fleet arrives, for the weapon is capable of destroying all life in the galaxy. Ba'al would not use such a weapon, but his new master would -- Anubis. ===Part 2=== Sam and Jacob discover the superweapon controls hidden behind a wall in the Dakara temple, and realize that it can be calibrated to emit a Replicator disruptor wave. However, to prevent the Replicators from adapting, the wave must strike all of them throughout the galaxy at the same time. The only way this is possible is to simultaneously dial every Stargate in the Milky Way from Dakara, and to accomplish this Sam and Jacob are forced to turn to Ba'al for help. Ba'al slows the advance of his fleet to buy them more time, and appears on Dakara in hologram form to lend his assistance. Back on the Replicator ship, Replicator Carter delves deeper into Daniel's Ascended memories, but finds it too immense even for the Replicator network to handle. Contrary to her assurances, she sends Replicators to attack Earth through the Stargate. O'Neill orders the evacuation of Stargate Command and the activation of the base's self-destruct. The fleets of Ba'al and Replicator Carter clash in a titanic battle over Dakara, with the small rebel Jaffa fleet caught in the middle. The Replicators land on the surface and charge the temple. On Earth, O'Neill and several other survivors are cut off from the surface and fight desperately to hold off the Replicators while attempting to dial the Stargate. At a crucial moment, Daniel manages to exploit his connection to Replicator Carter and freeze all the Replicators. Although Replicator Carter soon breaks free and stabs him, his actions give Sam and Jacob the few seconds needed to finish their work. The superweapon activates along with Stargates all over the galaxy; the disruptor wave disintegrates all the Replicators, including Replicator Carter. With the Replicators defeated, Ba'al suddenly finds himself surrounded by free Jaffa, and beams himself away. His escape inspires Jaffa everywhere to rebel, at last breaking Goa'uld's dominion over the galaxy. Despite the good news, Jack and Sam cannot help but wonder what happened to Daniel. ==Production== Both Amanda Tapping and Michael Shanks play dual roles in this episode. Tapping plays both Lt. Col. Samantha Carter and the RepliCarter. Shanks plays Dr. Daniel Jackson and provides the voice of Thor. Richard Dean Anderson and Michael Shanks do not share a scene in either episode. This episode is Michael Shanks' 150th episode. The images of Ba'al and Anubis' homeworld are stock footage of Delmak, Sokar's homeworld. Ne'tu is clearly visible in the sky. ==Reception== Fans regarded \\"Reckoning\\" as two of the most popular episodes of the series.GEOS - Stargate SG-1 Episode Guide This episode was nominated for an Emmy Award in the category \\"Outstanding Special Visual Effects for a Series\\" and a Leo Award in the category \\"Best Visual Effects\\".)

He also influenced Bolshevik and Left Oppositionist Leon Trotsky. ==Biography== Labriola was born in Cassino (then in the Papal States), the son a schoolteacher. In 1861, he entered the University of Naples. Upon graduating, he remained in Naples and became a schoolteacher. During this period, he pursued an interest in philosophy, history and ethnography. The early 1870s saw Labriola take up journalism and his writings from this time express liberal and anticlerical views. In 1874, Labriola was appointed as a professor in Rome, where he was to spend the rest of his life teaching, writing and debating. Although he had been critical of liberalism since 1873, his move towards Marxism was gradual, and he did not explicitly express a socialist viewpoint until 1889. He died in Rome on 2 February 1904. ==Philosophical work== Heavily influenced by Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel and Johann Friedrich Herbart, Labriola's approach to Marxist theory was more open-ended than that of theorists such as Karl Kautsky. He saw Marxism not as a final, self-sufficient schematisation of history, but rather as a collection of pointers to the understanding of human affairs. These pointers needed to be somewhat imprecise if Marxism was to take into account the complicated social processes and variety of forces at work in history. Marxist theory was to be understood as a theory critical of ideology,Jan Rehmann, Theories of Ideology: The Powers of Alienation and Subjection, BRILL, 2013, p. 62. in that it sees no truths as everlasting, and was ready to drop its own ideas if experience should so dictate. His description of Marxism as a \\"philosophy of praxis\\" would appear again in Gramsci's Prison Notebooks. ==References== ==External links== * Antonio Labriola Archive at Marxists Internet Archive * * Category:1843 births Category:1904 deaths Category:People from Cassino Category:19th-century philosophers Category:Italian Marxists Category:Italian philosophers Category:Italian socialists Category:Marxist theorists Category:University of Naples Federico II alumni Category:Burials in the Protestant Cemetery, Rome Category:Spinoza scholars ","title":"Antonio Labriola"},{"id":"2545477","text":"Robert E.

Instead of using chemical leavening, air is suspended in the batter during mixing to provide volume. Genoise should not be confused with pain de Gênes (\\"Genoa bread\\") which is made from almond paste, but it is similar to ' (\\"Spanish bread\\"), another Italian sponge cake.Carole Bloom, The Essential Baker: The Comprehensive Guide to Baking Page 601 2007 \\"American sponge cake traditionally has no fat and has a light, airy, delicate texture. It is a close relative of the classic French génoise cake, which is made with a small amount of butter. \\"Amy Brown Understanding Food: Principles and Preparation - Page 480 2010 \\"Unshortened cakes are also known as sponge or foam cakes and include angel food, sponge, meringue, dacquoise, génoise, and roulade. The term sponge in food preparation is frequently used to denote foods made with beaten egg whites.\\" It is a whole-egg cake, unlike some other sponge cakes for which yolks and whites are beaten separately. The eggs, and sometimes extra yolks, are beaten with sugar and heated at the same time, using a bain-marie or flame, to a stage known to patissiers as \\"ribbon stage\\". A genoise is generally a fairly lean cake, getting most of its fat from egg yolks, but some recipes also add in melted butter before baking. ==Use and preparation== Genoise is a basic building block of much French pâtisserie and is used for making several different types of cake. The batter usually is baked to form a thin sheet. An 1884 cookbook gives a simple recipe for a genoise: When finished baking, the sheet is rolled while still warm (to make jelly rolls or bûches de Noël), or cut and stacked into multiple layers or line a mold to be filled with a frozen dessert. A variety of fillings are used, such as jelly, chocolate, fruit, pastry cream, and whipped cream. The genoise can be piped in strips to make ladyfingers or into molds to make madeleines. It is the base for Jaffa Cakes. Genoise cake with buttercream frosting The cake is notable for its elastic and somewhat dry texture and is sometimes soaked with flavored syrups or liqueurs and often served with a buttercream frosting. The popular tiramisu cake may be made with ladyfingers or a genoise sheet. A chocolate genoise can be made by substituting cocoa powder for some of the flour, and is sometimes used as a substitute for the richer cake used in the standard Sacher torte recipe. ==See also== *Castella *Genoa cake *Lamington *Zuppa Inglese *Gâteau magique ==References== *Child, Julia, Julia's Kitchen Wisdom.

In comparison to other sciences, where Latin and Greek are the principal sources of vocabulary, computer science borrows more extensively from English. Due to the technical limitations of early computers, and the lack of international standards on the Internet, computer users were limited to using English and the Latin alphabet. However, this historical limitation is less present today. Most software products are localized in numerous languages and the use of the Unicode character encoding has resolved problems with non-Latin alphabets. Some limitations have only been changed recently, such as with domain names, which previously allowed only ASCII characters. English is seen as having this role due to the prominence of the United States and the United Kingdom, both English-speaking countries, in development and popularization of computer systems, computer networks, software and information technology. ==Influence on other languages== The computing terminology of many languages borrows from English. Some language communities resist actively to that trend, and in other cases English is used extensively and more directly. This section gives some examples for the use of English terminology in other languages, and also mentions any notable differences. ===Bulgarian=== Both English and Russian have influence over Bulgarian computing vocabulary. However, in many cases the borrowed terminology is translated, and not transcribed phonetically. Combined with the use of Cyrillic this can make it difficult to recognize loanwords. For example, the Bulgarian term for motherboard is (IPA or literally \\"bottom board\\"). * – computer * – hard disk * – floppy disk; like the French disquette * – (phonetic) web site; but also \\"\\" – internet page ===Faroese=== The Faroese language has a sparse scientific vocabulary based on the language itself. Many Faroese scientific words are borrowed and/or modified versions of especially Nordic and English equivalents. The vocabulary is constantly evolving and thus new words often die out, and only a few survive and become widely used. Examples of successful words include e.g. \\"telda\\" (computer), \\"kurla\\" (at sign) and \\"ambætari\\" (server). ===French=== In French, there are some generally accepted English loan-words, but there is also a distinct effort to avoid them. In France, the Académie française is responsible for the standardisation of the language and often coins new technological terms. Some of them are accepted in practice, in other cases the English loanwords remain predominant. In Quebec, the Office québécois de la langue française has a similar function. * email/mail (in Europe); courriel (mainly in French-speaking Canada, but increasingly used in French-speaking Europe); mél. (only used as an abbreviation, similar to \\"tél.\\"\\"Questions de langue\\" on the Académie Française's website); more formally courrier électronique * pourriel – spam * hameçonnage, phishing – phishing * télécharger – to download * site web – website * lien, hyperlien – website hyper-link * base de données – database * caméra web, webcaméra, short webcam – webcam * amorcer, démarrer, booter – to boot * redémarrer, rebooter – to reboot * arrêter, éteindre – to shut down * amorçable, bootable – bootable * surfréquençage, surcadençage, overclocking – overclocking * refroidissement à l'eau – watercooling * tuning PC – case modding === German === In German, English words are very often used as well: * nouns: Computer, Website, Software, E-Mail, Blog * verbs: downloaden, booten, crashen === Japanese === See also: Japanese input methods Japanese uses the katakana alphabet for foreign loan words, a wide variety of which are in use today. English computing terms are remain prevalent in modern Japanese vocabulary. * コンピューター (konpyuuta) - computer * コーダー (koodaa) - coder * コーデック (koddekku) - codec * リンク (rinku) - link Utilizing a keyboard layout suitable for romanization of Japanese, a user may type in the Latin script in order to display Japanese, inclusive of hiragana, katakana, and Japanese kanji. > Usually when writing in Japanese on a computer keyboard, the text is input > in roman transcription, optionally according to Hepburn, Kunrei, or Nippon > romanization; the common Japanese word processing programs allow for all > three. Long vowels are input according to how they are written in kana; for > example, a long o is input as ou, instead of an o with a circumflex or > macron (ô or ō). As letters are keyed in, they are automatically converted, > as specified, into either hiragana or katakana. And these kana phrases are > in turn converted, as desired, into kanji. === Icelandic === The Icelandic language has its own vocabulary of scientific terms, still English borrowings exist. English or Icelandicised words are mostly used in casual conversations, whereas the Icelandic words might be longer or not widespread. === Norwegian === It's quite common to use English words in regards to computing in all Scandinavian languages. nouns: , , mail, software, , spam verbs: å boote, å spamme, å blogge === Polish === Polish language words derived from English: * dżojstik: joystick * kartrydż, kartridż: cartridge * interfejs: interface * mejl: e-mail === Russian === * History of computer hardware in Soviet Bloc countries * Computer Russification === Spanish === The English influence on the software industry and the internet in Latin America has borrowed significantly from the Castilian lexicon. ;Frequently untranslated, and their Spanish equivalent *email: correo electrónico *mouse (only in Latin America): ratón (mainly in Spain) *messenger: mensajero *webcam: cámara web *website: página web, sitio web *blog: bitácora, 'blog' *ban/banned: vetar, vetado *web: red ;Not translated *flog ;Undecided Many computing terms in Spanish share a common root with their English counterpart. In these cases, both terms are understood, but the Spanish is preferred for formal use: *link vs enlace or vínculo *net vs red == Character encoding == The early computer software and hardware had very little support for alphabets other than the Latin. As a result of this it was difficult or impossible to represent languages based on other scripts. The ASCII character encoding, created in the 1960s, only supported 128 different characters. With the use of additional software it was possible to provide support for some languages, for instance those based on the Cyrillic alphabet. However, complex-script languages like Chinese or Japanese need more characters than the 256 limit imposed by 8-bit character encodings. Some computers created in the former USSR had native support for the Cyrillic alphabet. The wide adoption of Unicode, and UTF-8 on the web, resolved most of these historical limitations. ASCII remains the de facto standard for command interpreters, programming languages and text-based communication protocols. * Mojibake – Text presented as \\"unreadable\\" when software fails due to character encoding issues. == Programming language == The syntax of most programming languages uses English keywords, and therefore it could be argued some knowledge of English is required in order to use them. However, it is important to recognize all programming languages are in the class of formal languages. They are very different from any natural language, including English. Some examples of non-English programming languages: * Arabic: ARLOGO, قلب * Bengali: BangaBhasha * Chinese: Chinese BASIC * Dutch: Superlogo * French: LSE, WinDev, Pascal (although the English version is more widespread) * Hebrew: Hebrew Programming Language * Icelandic: Fjölnir * Indian Languages: Hindawi Programming System * Russian: Glagol * Spanish: Lexico == Communication protocols == Many application protocols use text strings for requests and parameters, rather than the binary values commonly used in lower layer protocols. The request strings are generally based on English words, although in some cases the strings are contractions or acronyms of English expressions, which renders them somewhat cryptic to anyone not familiar with the protocol, whatever their proficiency in English. Nevertheless, the use of word-like strings is a convenient mnemonic device that allows a person skilled in the art (and with sufficient knowledge of English) to execute the protocol manually from a keyboard, usually for the purpose of finding a problem with the service. Examples: * FTP: USER, PASS (password), PASV (passive), PORT, RETR (retrieve), STOR (store), QUIT * SMTP: HELO (hello), MAIL, RCPT (recipient), DATA, QUIT * HTTP: GET, PUT, POST, HEAD (headers), DELETE, TRACE, OPTIONS It is notable that response codes, that is, the strings sent back by the recipient of a request, are typically numeric: for instance, in HTTP (and some borrowed by other protocols) * 200 OK request succeeded * 301 Moved Permanently to redirect the request to a new address * 404 Not Found the requested page does not exist This is because response codes also need to convey unambiguous information, but can have various nuances that the requester may optionally use to vary its subsequent actions. To convey all such \\"sub-codes\\" with alphabetic words would be unwieldy, and negate the advantage of using pseudo-English words. Since responses are usually generated by software they do not need to be mnemonic. Numeric codes are also more easily analyzed and categorized when they are processed by software, instead of a human testing the protocol by manual input. == Localization == === BIOS === Many personal computers have a BIOS chip, displaying text in English during boot time. === Keyboard shortcut === Keyboard shortcuts are usually defined in terms of English keywords such as CTRL+F for find. == English on the World Wide Web == English is the largest language on the World Wide Web, with 27% of internet users. === English speakers === Web user percentages usually focus on raw comparisons of the first language of those who access the web. Just as important is a consideration of second- and foreign-language users; i.e., the first language of a user does not necessarily reflect which language he or she regularly employs when using the web. ==== Native speakers ==== English-language users appear to be a plurality of web users, consistently cited as around one-third of the overall (near one billion). This reflects the relative affluence of English-speaking countries and high Internet penetration rates in them. This lead may be eroding due mainly to a rapid increase of Chinese users.English grip on internet being eroded  Technology  Guardian Unlimited First-language users among other relatively affluent countries appear generally stable, the two largest being German and Japanese, which each have between 5% and 10% of the overall share. === World Wide Web content === One widely quoted figure for the amount of web content in English is 80%.What percentage of the internet is in English? Other sources show figures five to fifteen points lower, though still well over 50%.English could snowball on Net TRN 112101 There are two notable facts about these percentages: The English web content is greater than the number of first- language English users by as much as 2 to 1. Given the enormous lead it already enjoys and its increasing use as a lingua franca in other spheres, English web content may continue to dominate even as English first-language Internet users decline. This is a classic positive feedback loop: new Internet users find it helpful to learn English and employ it online, thus reinforcing the language's prestige and forcing subsequent new users to learn English as well. Certain other factors (some predating the medium's appearance) have propelled English into a majority web-content position. Most notable in this regard is the tendency for researchers and professionals to publish in English to ensure maximum exposure. The largest database of medical bibliographical information, for example, shows English was the majority language choice for the past forty years and its share has continually increased over the same period.Language and country preponderance trends in MEDLINE and its causes The fact that non-Anglophones regularly publish in English only reinforces the language's dominance. English has a rich technical vocabulary (largely because native and non-native speakers alike use it to communicate technical ideas) and many IT and technical professionals use English regardless of country of origin (Linus Torvalds, for instance, comments his code in English, despite being from Finland and having Swedish as his first language). ==Notes== Category:English language Category:Computing and society Category:Internet culture Category:Natural language and computing Category:English as a global language ","title":"English in computing"},{"id":"2545488","text":" The paddlewheeler Creole Queen is a 1,000 passenger riverboat operating out of the Port Of New Orleans.

The episodes were written by Joseph Mallozzi, Paul Mullie, Executive producers Brad Wright and Robert C. Cooper, the episodes were directed by Peter DeLuise. The episodes were the strongest episodes in the eighth season on the Nielsen household ratings with fellow Stargate SG-1 episode \\"New Order\\". The episode got strong reviews from major media publishers worldwide. \\"Moebius\\" is about the discovery of a Zero Point Module (ZPM) by SG-1, the only problem is that it was taken by Ra after the Earth revolt more than five thousand years ago. The team decides to travel back in time to get the ZPM and leave without changing history (based on the fact that Ra and company were most likely unaware of the ZPM's purpose), but they are unable to travel back to present time so they record a video for the United States government to find. In the alternate timeline, the government find the tape and subsequently the Stargate in Antarctica and decide to establish the Stargate Program but not to restore the original timeline. == Plot overview == === Part 1 === Samantha \\"Sam\\" Carter reveals the existence of the Daedalus: a new Earth-built battlecruiser which is capable of reaching the Pegasus Galaxy and is larger and more advanced than the Prometheus. Daniel Jackson learns of Catherine Langford's death and, after her funeral, receives Catherine's collection of documents and artifacts relating to the Stargate program. From one book in the collection, Daniel learns of the former location of a Zero Point Module (ZPM) in Ancient Egypt. Daniel and Carter persuade Jack O'Neill to use the time travel capabilities of the Puddle Jumper they found to travel back and take the ZPM, assuming that Ra never knew of its purpose. Once they arrive in 3000 B.C., they join in an offering to Ra and witness his cold-blooded murder of an Egyptian making the offering. Teal'c disguises himself as a Horus Jaffa and retrieves the ZPM from Ra's treasury. However, Ra's Jaffa discover the cloaked Jumper after a sandstorm covers it in sand. Unwilling to upset the future by fighting the Jaffa to get the Jumper back, SG-1 decides to live out the rest of their lives in the past, knowing that the rebellion that overthrew Ra will eventually happen. However, an alternate timeline is created in which the Stargate was never discovered and everything SG-1 have done for the last eight years never happened. In this timeline, alternate Daniel is teaching English as a second language, alternate Carter spends her time double-checking other scientists' work, alternate O'Neill is retired from the military and alternate Teal'c is still the First Prime of Apophis. Alternate Daniel and alternate Carter are contacted by the Air Force and brought to Cheyenne Mountain. At Cheyenne Mountain, George Hammond informs alternate Carter and alternate Daniel that archaeologists found a video camera in a vacuum-sealed canopic jar at a dig in Giza. The video contains a recording of the original SG-1, explaining who they are and what they were doing, as well as a number of things that are true in their timeline, such as recent political events, Presidents and personal details. Their plan is that if things have changed in the future, then SG-1's alternative selves will travel back in time and fix the past. An expedition team is sent to find the Giza Stargate, but find nothing. Instead, they discover that the original Daniel left a tablet where the gate should have been, inscribed with an obscure dialect of Egyptian that only alternate Daniel can read. It reveals that the original SG-1 instigated a successful rebellion against the Ra of 3000 BC. However, this caused him to leave Earth with the Stargate. However, they do find the Puddle Jumper, and alternate Daniel and alternate Carter figure out how to find the Antarctic Stargate. A team is assembled to go through the Stargate to recruit alternate Teal'c under the instruction of the Daniel and Carter on the tape. Alternate Daniel and alternate Carter are not going to be on this team. === Part 2 === The scientists working on the recovered Alternate-Puddle Jumper cannot make it work because they do not have the ATA gene. Alternate-O'Neill is called in to operate the Jumper and lead the team through the Stargate to find alternate Teal'c, and agrees that alternate Daniel and alternate Carter are to join the team through the Stargate. On Chulak, SG-1 are caught by Jaffa loyal to Apophis and imprisoned. Alternate Teal'c defects to their cause and helps them escape but alternate Daniel was made a Goa'uld spy by Apophis and is killed by Teal'c. They escape in the Puddle Jumper, but are chased and damaged by Death Gliders. Unaware of the jumper's cloaking capacity, they believe that only way they can survive is to time-travel. They travel back to 3000 B.C. and use the Stargate to pass from Chulak to Ancient Egypt where the original versions of SG-1 were stranded and where Ra is still alive and ruling. The original SG-1 attempted the rebellion because O'Neill and Teal'c did not want to stay and O'Neill, Carter and Teal'c were killed when it failed. Daniel, the only survivor, meets with alternate Carter, alternate O'Neill and alternate Teal'c. He has not yet made the tablet detailing the second successful rebellion attempt because it hasn't happened yet. This means that his current plans with the underground of the local populace are destined to succeed, however they lead to the Stargate being removed from Earth by Ra. The plan is to instigate the rebellion, thus diverting Ra's attention, and secure the Stargate to where it was originally buried, allowing the original timeline to evolve as it did. The rebellion ultimately succeeds, but not before alternate Carter and alternate-O'Neill show their feelings for each other with a kiss, uncertain if they will survive. Ra's Jaffa surrender, outnumbered by the staff- and zat- armed Egyptians. The alternate SG-1 bury the videotape, along with the ZPM, for the SG-1 of the future to find. The alternate-SG-1 and Daniel from the original SG-1 (of 3000 BC) live out the rest of their lives in Ancient Egypt. The original SG-1 of the present day receive the videotape and the ZPM left for them a few weeks before they were to go back in time. As the timeline has been restored, they have no reason to go back in time, and they've gained a ZPM free of charge. The episode ends with SG-1 at O'Neill's cabin, fishing, in a scene identical to the end of \\"Threads\\", except there are now fish in Jack's pond. ==Production== Jay Acovone's character Charles Kawalsky re-emerged after dying in \\"The Enemy Within\\" After production wrapped on season seven, the writers came together and pitched out ideas for the eighth and presumably final season. Season five through season seven had previously been expected to be the last, but the show got renewed each year.811 Audio Commentary \\"Gemini\\" by Will Waring (WW, Director) and Jim Menard (JM, Director of Photography) They ultimately agreed on about ten initial episodes, two of which should make a two-hour premiere to address left-open issues of the season seven finale. Stargate SG-1 was originally set to be replaced with a new series entitled Stargate Command, but the Sci Fi Channel decided to renew the series for another season. O'Neill's last line in \\"Moebius\\", \\"Close enough\\" is a homage to The Simpsons episode \\"Treehouse of Horror V\\" that involves Homer Simpson time traveling and unintentionally making numerous changes to history; upon returning to a timeline where his family has snake tongues but everything else is otherwise normal, he says \\"eh, close enough\\". In the same SG-1 episode, the name of O'Neill's boat is \\"Homer\\". This is one of several references to The Simpsons on Stargate SG-1, all centered around O'Neill. (However, Carter's line \\"I keep thinking I'm gonna step on a bug and change the future,\\" may be taken as a reference to The Simpsons, as Homer's stepping on a bug is what caused the changes in his universe. Alternatively, this line could be a reference to Ray Bradbury's A Sound of Thunder, the original science fiction story that involved changes in a timeline caused by stepping on an insect, which influenced the Simpsons episode.) Incidentally, in the brief shot of O'Neill boat showing the name, the font used is the same font used extensively in The Simpsons. \\"Moebius\\" was supposed to be the Stargate SG-1 series finale (like the two previous season finales), so many actors reprised their roles from past episodes: Don S. Davis as George Hammond, Peter Williams as Apophis, Colin Cunningham as Major Davis, and Jay Acovone as Charles Kawalsky. This is the last episode to feature Richard Dean Anderson character Brigadier General Jonathan \\"Jack\\" O'Neill as a main cast member of Stargate SG-1. The episode also marks the final appearances of recurring characters Charles Kawalsky, Apophis and Major Davis (who would re-appear in Stargate Atlantis series finale \\"Enemy at the Gate\\" (2009)). Alessandro Juliani (Katep) previously played Eliam in the Season 4 episode \\"Scorched Earth\\". This episode marks Ra's only appearance outside of the feature film and Stargate: Continuum. == Reception == \\"Moebius\\" earned a Nielsen household rating of 4.7, part one earned 2.3 and part two earned 2.4 in Nielsen household ratings. Christine Mooney won a Leo Award in the category \\"Dramatic Series - Best Costume Design\\" for \\"Moebius\\" (Part 2). Dan Houston from Digitally Obsessed said the episode was a \\"Must-see\\" for \\"Fans\\" of Stargate SG-1. Holly E. Ordway from DVDTalk said the episodes \\"story\\" was \\"entertaining\\" and \\"interesting\\" and different from the previous episodes in the franchise. ==References== ==External links== *Moebius Part 1 and Part 2 at mgm.com * * Category:Stargate SG-1 episodes Category:2005 American television episodes ","title":"Moebius (Stargate SG-1)"},{"id":"2545561","text":"The Flores Sea covers of water in Indonesia.

As a boy he moved to Warsaw, where he graduated from a non-classical secondary school. In 1902, he left for Paris to undertake studies, first at the École des Beaux-Arts in the studio of the aged master of academism Jean-Léon Gérôme, and then at Académie Colarossi in the studio of Albert Besnard. In 1903, he traveled to Italy and toward the end of the year to Munich, where he entered a private school run by the Slovenian Anton Ažbe. In 1904 he returned to Paris. In the same year his debut took place at the Autumn Salon and two years later he was accepted as a jury member in the drawing section of this institution. In the years 1906-1908 he made trips to Brittany (Pont l’Abbé, among other places). On the Seine he was involved in the life of the Polish colony, participating in the Society of Polish Artists in Paris, among other organizations. He befriended many Polish artists there, including Roman Kramsztyk, Wacław Borowski, Leopold Gottlieb, Jerzy Merkel, Elie Nadelman, Mela Muter, Tytus Czyżewski and Zygmunt Menkes. His reputation grew rapidly. The French government purchased of one of his paintings for the Musée du Luxembourg (1910), he organized a one-man show at Galerie Druet (1911), he was connected with important personalities of Parisian cultural life, including the critics Adolf Basler and André Salmon, and he became an exhibiting member of the Société Normande de Peinture Moderne. In 1912 he became a professor at the Académie de La Palette. In 1913 he married a beginning painter Jadwiga Kon, who managed the well-known Galerie Zak after his death. Between 1914 and 1916 he stayed in southern France (Nice, St Paul-de-Vence, and Vence), and also visited Lausanne in Switzerland. In 1916 he returned with his family to Poland, settling in his wife's hometown of Częstochowa. He associated with the Formists. Upon his frequent visits to Warsaw, he collaborated with the future members of Rhythm, a group he co- founded in 1921. In 1922 he left Poland for good. First, he went to Germany, where he had already been known and esteemed before the World War I. He visited Berlin and later Bonn, where he carried out a commission to decorate the interior of the villa of the architect Fritz August Breuhaus with paintings. He co-operated with the periodical Deutsche Kunst und Dekoration, publishing articles on certain artists who were close to him. In 1923 he settled once again in Paris, where he joined his friends Zygmunt Menkes and Marc Chagall. His growing artistic fame and financial successes ended suddenly when he died of a heart attack in Paris, aged 41. He did not live to take over the faculty of painting, which had been offered to him by the Academy of Fine Arts, Cologne, Germany. ==Work== Fisherman From the beginning, Żak expressed his artistic temperament through a sophisticated application of line, referring in his sanguine portraits to works by Leonardo, Botticelli, Holbein and Dürer. In the early stage of his career, he approached the style of the Nabis, through the manipulation of flat areas, enclosed within distinct contours and faded, slightly matte colors. For a brief period, he succumbed – like so many of his Parisian colleagues – to the exoticism and folk atmosphere of Brittany. He also borrowed certain motifs from Chinese porcelain and Persian miniatures. He painted views of Parisian back streets and boulevards on the Seine and, sporadically, took up New Testament themes. Even before World War I, some of his compositions were in line with the idyllic tradition represented by works of such artists as Nicolas Poussin, Claude Lorrain (called le Lorraine), Antoine Watteau, and most of all Puvis de Chavannes, whose Poor Fisherman at the Louvre inspired a number of Żak's paintings and drawings. The Polish artist began to intensify the stylization of his figural silhouettes and faces. Żak's Arcadia, inspired by original Italian and southern French landscapes as well as those by European art masters, was inhabited by people with a hermaphroditic beauty, undoubtedly linked to Żak's fascination with the Renaissance. Their physiognomies recall the profiles of ancient Greek art, with the nose angled straight from the forehead and distinctly outlined eyes, while the faces bear a languorous, nostalgic expression. Żak, like Modigliani, by means of sophisticated drawing and a poetic imagination with a romantic tint, created a very special \\"human race\\" found only in the figures of his pictures. Pastorale His cubified houses and masses of rocks were always composed with a decorative rhythm. Their refined combinations of broken colors and reserved expression distinguish these paintings. They enter an interesting dialogue with achievements of certain representatives of the German New Objectivity, and also some of the Italians from the Valori Plastici group, though by no means can we speak here of direct influences. Around 1917-1920 social outsiders, the nostalgic loners who spend their lives in saloons or interiors with scanty furniture, replaced the earlier fishermen and their families, sailors, and merchants. Here we have a clear connection with the \\"miserable\\" trend of the young Pablo Picasso, such as his Saltimbanques of the blue period. At the same time, these sad themes are counterbalanced by representations of happy families in various configurations: a mother playing with a smiling child, a family playing with a puppet-theatre, etc. The paintings from his last period gain more light and life, while the artist does not eschew dissonances. Contours dissolve on the edges of bordering color areas and spot-lighting melts the surfaces of stylized forms. Żak's repertoire of forms may not be rich, but it is characteristic enough due to make his works immediately recognizable. His style inspired many Polish artists gathered around \\"Rhythm\\", a group which co- created a Polish version of Art Deco. The important feature of Żak's grammar of forms was his treatment of the human silhouette, which the painter endowed with elongated proportions that had little in common with those of the real models, a mannerist over-emphasis on contrapposto, and dance-like postures usually ascribed to marionettes or dummies rather than to people. His late paintings seemed to open a new chapter in his oeuvre: he now began to draw on the color and painterly effects of the Impressionists (primarily those of Renoir) once so much despised by him. ==Exhibitions== During Zak's lifetime, his one-man shows were organized in Paris (1911, 1925) and Warsaw (1917). Apart from the Paris Salons (from 1904) and an exhibition of the Polish artists residing in Paris, which was organized in Barcelona (1912), his works appeared at the famous Armory Show in New York City, Chicago and Boston, where he was the only Pole besides Elie Nadelman (1913), at the Venice Biennale (1914), and at the Parisian exhibitions of the Association France-Pologne in Paris (1924). Moreover, he took part in exhibitions of the Society of Polish Artists \\"Sztuka\\" (\\"Art\\"), beginning in 1908, as well as those of the Polish Expressionists (later called Formists) before they formed an official group (Kraków 1913 and Zakopane 1916) and after (Kraków 1917 and Lwów 1918). He exhibited in Warsaw as a member of the Polish Art Club (1917–1919), the New Group (1918), and Association of Polish Artists \\"Rhythm\\" in Kraków (1923) and Warsaw (1924). The artist's posthumous exhibitions occurred at the three Paris Salons and at Parisian galleries as well as in Warsaw and Düsseldorf (all in 1926), New York (1927), Buffalo (1928), London (1929) and several more times in Paris, including at the Galerie Zak (1936, 1938). The last, run by the artist's widow, enjoyed the reputation of being one of the most interesting galleries on the left bank of the Seine: it sponsored, among other things, the first exhibition by members of the Paris Committee, known as the Kapists, several one-man shows of Polish and Jewish artists active in France, and Wassily Kandinsky's first Parisian one-man show. ==References== * Anna Król and Artur Tanikowski, Colors of Identity: Polish Art from the American Collection of Tom Podl, National Museum in Kraków: Kraków 2001. * Artur Tanikowski, Eugeniusz Zak, translated by Jarek Król, Pogranicze: Sejny 2003. ==External links== *Żak's artwork at malarze.com Category:Belarusian painters Category:Polish painters of Jewish descent Category:Polish Jews Category:Belarusian Jews Category:1884 births Category:1926 deaths Category:20th-century Belarusian painters Category:Académie Colarossi alumni Category:Alumni of the École des Beaux-Arts ","title":"Eugeniusz Zak"},{"id":"2545569","text":"Tun Datuk Patinggi Haji Abdul Rahman bin Ya'kub (3 January 1928 – 9 January 2015)Tun Datuk Patinggi Haji Abdul Rahman Ya'akub . arkib.gov.my was a Malaysian politician of Melanau descent from Mukah.

He even conducted free-religious classes for the public after leaving active politics in 1985.Truly memorable 80th birthday The Star ==Early life and career== Abdul Rahman bin Ya'kub was born in the village of Kampung Jepak, Bintulu, Sarawak on 3 January 1928 to a fisherman by the name of Tuan Wan Ya'kub bin Wan Yusuf and Siti Hajar binti Haji Mohd Tahir who was a housewife. Rahman's family left Bintulu and headed for Miri, hoping to gain access for better education. Rahman first attended a Malay school and then the Sekolah Anchi in Miri. His father, who wished that Abdul Rahman bin Ya'kub be given an Islamic education, attempted to send him to the Aljunied Arabic School in 1939, a decision that was opposed by his mother due to the outbreak of World War II. He then transferred to St. Joseph Miri, but his studies was cut short by the Japanese invasion. At a young age, he learnt the Japanese martial art Aikido and was able to also meet Morihei Ueshiba, the founder of Aikido. Due to financial constraints, Rahman had to leave school in 1947 and worked as an oil-tester for the Sarawak Shell Company in Lutong, earning RM 2 daily. Not satisfied with his earnings, Abdul Rahman went to Sarawak General Hospital, thinking that he would supervise other workers. However, he ended up sweeping the floor and helping patients instead. He left the hospital after working just one day. Abdul Rahman subsequently secured a job as a Student Native Officer. He was sent to Madrasah Melayu Kuching as a form 3 grader. In 1948, he was sent to Miri as a Probationary Native Officer and Fourth Class Magistrate. He stayed in Miri until 1952, mostly doing court works. In 1952, Rahman was promoted to first class magistrate. Rahman passed with a Grade Two Certificate at Senior Cambridge examination in the following year. Rahman was 26 years old when he was accepted into University of Southampton to study law in 1954. Five years later, he graduated from the university as a trained lawyer and was appointed as Cadet Legal Officer. He worked as the Deputy Public Prosecutor in the Sarawak Legal Department from 1959 to 1963. He was the first Bumiputera from Sarawak that graduated as a lawyer in 1958 from Lincoln's Inn. ==Early political career== Rahman played a part in the formation of Parti Negara Sarawak (PANAS) and Barisan Ra'ayat Jati Sarawak (BARJASA) by helping in the drafting of constitutions of both parties. However, Rahman decided to join BARJASA because he opposed Malay aristocrats in PANAS. Rahman contested in the 1963 local council elections of Sarawak but was defeated together with his party members such as Ustaz Abdul Kadir Hassan and Suut Haji Tahir. The Malaysian federal government nominated Abdul Rahman as the first Sarawak chief minister. However, his nomination was rejected by the Sarawak Alliance which was dominated by Sarawak National Party (SNAP) party that time. ===Minister in the federal cabinet=== Rahman was elected by Council Negri (now Sarawak State Legislative Assembly) to become a member of parliament in October 1963. He was later appointed as Assistant Federal Minister of National and Rural Development for Sarawak. The first Prime Minister of Malaysia, Tunku Abdul Rahman brought Abdul Rahman into politics while the second Prime Minister Tun Abdul Razak mentor him. Tunku was satisfied with Abdul Rahman performance as an assistant federal minister. Rahman was subsequently promoted to the full minister of Lands and Mines in 1965. Rahman began recommending the federal government of establishing a national oil company which would later be known as Petronas in 1974. He also recommended that Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah be appointed as chairman of Petronas. Rahman became an education minister in 1969. He made a bold move by changing the medium of instruction for all the schools and higher learning institutions from English to the Malay language. He is also credited for the creation of Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM) in 1970. He also did away with primary six common entrance examination, so that all the primary six students will be able to continue with their secondary education. Education minister was Rahman's last portfolio before he returned to Sarawak. ==Appointment to Chief Minister== Abdul Rahman won the Kuala Rajang state constituency during the resumption of 1969 state election in 1970, representing Parti Bumiputera Sarawak, which was part of the Sarawak Alliance. After the election, there was not any party holding a clear majority. Abdul Rahman planned to cooperate with PESAKA in order to form a government but PESAKA did not accept Rahman as their chief minister. Therefore, PESAKA negotiated with Sarawak National Party (SNAP) and Sarawak United Peoples' Party (SUPP) in order to form a government. However, without the knowledge of SNAP and PESAKA, SUPP was quietly negotiating with Parti Bumiputera to form a separate coalition. Rahman was able to convince SUPP to form a coalition government with him as the chief minister. As part of the deal in joining the coalition, SUPP demanded that Sarawak Chinese Association (SCA) be ejected from Sarawak Alliance and be dissolved later. In order to ensure Dayak participation in the Sarawak cabinet, Rahman offered Penghulu Abok from PESAKA a cabinet post. Simon Dembab Raja from PESAKA joined the cabinet a day later as a deputy chief minister. Soon after that, Temenggung Jugah, the president of PESAKA, announced his support for the Rahman's coalition government, thus leaving SNAP as the only opposition party in Sarawak. Rahman was called by Tun Abdul Razak to tackle the communist insurgency in Sarawak. ===UMNO membership=== Abdul Rahman was appointed an executive member of United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) on 16 May 1965 during the 1966 Sarawak constitutional crisis. He was the vice- president of UMNO Datu Keramat branch and was a central committee member of the party although he was also a PBB member. In 1970, Abdul Rahman was one of the candidates vying for UMNO's vice-presidency. Rahman drafted the PBB constitution by adapting from the UMNO's constitution. Similar to UMNO's party structure, PBB adopted four levels of bureaucracy namely General Assembly, Supreme Council, branches, and sub-branches. This is similar to UMNO's organisational structure of national, negeri liaison office, division, and branches. At every party levels, PBB has youth and women wings which is also similar to UMNO's set up. Abdul Rahman was able to influence party policies and party elections during his term as PBB president from 1977 to 1981. ===Sarawak oil and gas rights=== According to Sarawak Tribune (owned by Abdul Rahman)Weiss J (2001). In Tigers' Roar: Asia's Recovery and Its Impact. M. E. Sharpe. p. 261. . Google Book Search. Retrieved 19 January 2014. published during the 1987 Ming Court Affair, the federal government tried to obtain the Sarawak oil rights by holding several discussions with state leaders such as Abdul Rahman through Abdul Taib Mahmud in the early 1970s. Taib was the federal Primary Industry Minister who was responsible for all mining industry including petroleum and gas. Taib with his aide Adenan Satem tried to persuade Abdul Rahman to hand over Sarawak Continental shelf to the total control of federal government, thus depriving Sarawak of 10% oil royalty which it have been receiving from foreign oil companies. Although Abdul Rahman refused to accept the plan, Taib decided to introduce a hydrocarbon bill in 1974 which would give total dominance of Sarawak oil and gas to federal government, without consulting Abdul Rahman. However, in autobiography of Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah published in 1986, Taib was advocating the sharing of 10% oil royalty between the federal government and the state government. Abdul Rahman threatened to sue the federal government in court if the bill was not withdrawn. Abdul Rahman obtained three legal opinions from the former Attorney general of Australia, a public international law expert from Cambridge University and a former High Court judge to back Sarawak's claims that Sarawak territorial waters was not confined to three-nautical-miles limit for oil royalty. Abdul Razak then invited Abdul Rahman to Kuala Lumpur for a closed- door discussion. During the discussion, Rahman agreed to a smaller payout of oil royalty because the federal government was not wealthy at that time and the oil royalty will be revised in the future. The hydrocarbon bill was finally withdrawn with the persistent protests by the Sarawak government. According to Lukas Straumann, the conflict on the oil and gas rights was resolved as an internal family affair of the Abdul Rahman's family. The federal government decided to appoint Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah to negotiate new terms with Abdul Rahman. Abdul Rahman also claimed that in a meeting of final decision of oil royalty payments chaired by Tun Tan Siew Sin (Federal Finance Minister) and attended by deputy chief minister of Sarawak Tan Sri Stephen Yong, an agreement of 5% oil royalty was reached without consulting Abdul Rahman. However, according to autobiography of Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah published in 1986, Abdul Rahman agreed to the equal share of 10% oil royalty between the federal and the state government after a private discussion with Razaleigh. Abdul Rahman finally agreed to the 5% oil royalty given by the federal government. Petroleum Development Act was passed in parliament in 1974. This would allow Malaysian oil and gas company, Petronas to gain control over the oil and gas reserves in Sarawak. The revenues from oil and gas will be divided among oil-producing states (5 percent), federal government (5 percent), producer company (41 percent), and Petronas (49 percent). ===Tackling communist insurgency=== Communist insurgency in Sarawak was responsible for the killings of 12 Iban border scouts in the seventh divisions on 27 August 1970. The communists were also responsible for the killings of several villagers in first, second, and third divisions. Abdul Rahman finally succeeded in impairing the communist movement by signing a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the Director of Political Commissioner of Pasukan Rakyat Kalimantan Utara (PARAKU) led by Bong Kee Chok at Sri Aman on 21 October 1973. ===Development policy=== In order to safeguard national interests, Abdul Rahman declared that he denounced the slogan \\"Sarawak for Sarawakians\\" and replaced it with \\"Malaysia for Malaysians\\" a few weeks after he became the chief minister. Rahman argued that regional politics is not only divisive but could also harm the national solidarity. He also said that Sarawak should accept policies from the federal government because \\"Sarawak received a lot of money from the federal government. Without their assistance, we could never hope to progress so quickly.\\" Rahman also introduced a motion in the Council Negri to make Bahasa Melayu along with English language as Sarawak's official languages. The motion was passed unanimously on 26 March 1974. This motion prompted fierce criticism from Stephen Kalong Ningkan. Abdul Rahman also started to implement the national education policy on Sarawak. He changed the medium of instruction of all schools in Sarawak from English to Malay language. Sekolah Datuk Abdul Rahman was the first school in Sarawak to accept this change in 1970. By 1976, a total of 258 primary schools involving 36,267 students adopted Bahasa Melayu as their medium of instruction. Abdul Rahman started to appoint Muslim Bumiputera officers to important positions within the government. He appointed Abang Yusuf Puteh as the new state secretary, replacing Gerusin Lembat who was the first non-European Sarawak state secretary. Bujang Mohammad Nor was appointed as financial secretary, Safri Awang Zaidell was appointed as secretary of community service council, and Hamdan bin Sirat as Sarawak Commissioner of Police. Abdul Rahman set up the Sarawak foundation to provide scholarships and educational loans for the needy students. He also established several statutory bodies including State Planning Unit to speed up the development in Sarawak. Five administrative divisions in Sarawak has been increased to seven under his tenure of office. A bridge built in May 1975 which connects the two administrative divisions, namely Kuching North City Hall (DBKU) and Kuching South City Council (MBKS) was named after him. ===Timber politics and electoral patronage=== Abdul Rahman bin Ya'kub was known for using his chief minister power to distribute state resources to his clients. In return, the clients would finance his electoral campaign during state elections. This is to ensure the loyalty of his clients to his leadership. Zainuddin Satem, Salleh Jafaruddin (Rahman's nephew), Wan Habib Syed Mahmud (Rahman's nephew), Wan Madzihi Madzar (Rahman's nephew), Daniel Tajem were among the recipients of timber concessions. He also gave some timber concessions to his family members namely Norlia Abdul Rahman (daughter), Khadijah Abdul Rahman (daughter), and Jamil Abdullah (Rahman's brother-in-law). A case study in Belaga district revealed that the shares of the Lembahan Mewah timber licence was 70% owned by his daughters while the remaining 30% of shares was owned by the wife of Datuk Tajang Laing, the state assemblyman for Belaga district. Among the Rahman-linked companies that had received timber concessions were Baltim Timber Sdn Bhd, Syarikat Delapan Sdn Bhd, Barbet Sdn Bhd, and Lembahan Mewah Sdn Bhd. Abdul Rahman with the help of Malaysian federal government also distributed developmental projects, financial grants, and other handouts to voters in exchange for electoral support. The ministers would distribute developmental projects which was already under Malaysian Plan or pledge new projects under their respective ministries. For example, in 1978 Malaysian general election, seven new developmental projects totalling RM 189.9 million was allocated by federal and state leaders. Developmental project and financial grants were also taken from state assemblymen and member of parliament (MP) grants which was valued at RM 200,000 and RM 300,000 respectively. Financial grants would be given to voters to purchase essential goods. Subsidies in the form of fertilisers, and other specific needs such as water tanks, and land titles would also be given to the voters. In 1974 elections, 8 developmental projects and financial grant valuing RM 22.4 million were distributed. In 1978 election, 102 projects worth RM 200 million were distributed. Such rise in number of developmental projects were mainly due to intense challenge posed by the opposition namely Parti Anak Jati Sarawak (PAJAR), Parti Negara Rakyat Sarawak (PNRS), Sarawak People's Party (SAPO), and Parti Umat Sarawak (UMAT). Such granting of developmental projects slowly eroded the electoral support for the opposition. According to Alli Kawi, the leader of PAJAR: ===Maintaining the position of Islam=== In order to empower the position of Islam in Sarawak, Abdul Rahman was responsible for the revision of Articles 4(1) and (2) into \\"The Yang di- Pertuan Agong shall be the head of religion of Islam in Sarawak\\" and \\"the Council Negri is empowered to make provisions for regulating Islamic affairs through a Council to advise the Yang di-Pertuan Agong\\". Such provisions enabled Council Negri to pass ordinance regarding the Islamic religious affairs. Abdul Rahman also helped to established state sponsored Islamic NGOs such as Angkatan Nahdatul Islam Bersatu (BINA) which would later renamed to Harakah Islamiah (HIKMAH) in 1994. Through this NGO, Rahman was able to hold various Islamic activities without going through the state agencies. This NGO was responsible for the conversions of thousands of natives and Chinese and was publicised through newspapers. Between 1973 and 1980, at least 2,236 cases of conversions were reported in newspapers. The mass conversions would be attended by Abdul Rahman himself and other Muslim ministers at his residence. The total number of conversions made by Abdul Rahman however, was less than the number of conversions made by Tun Mustapha in the neighbouring state of Sabah where the latter was believed to have converted a total of 95,000 Sabahans. Although some conversions are due to genuine belief in Islam, others viewed this as a way to get to political office, employments, or contracts from the government. For example, after a conversion ceremony of Ibans in Kuching, Abdul Rahman announced that a 40-door longhouse would be built by BINA for the new converts. In December 1978, Majlis Islam Bill was amended to enable for the establishment of syariah courts in Sarawak consisting of Supreme Syariah Court, the Appeal Court, and several courts of Kadi. Supreme Syariah Court and Appeal court was enforced throughout Sarawak while Courts of Kadi was enforced only in Kuching, Sibu, and Miri. The Majlis Islam (Amendment) Act was only enforced in on 1 January 1983. ===1974 state election and aftermath=== Parti Pesaka Bumiputera Bersatu (PBB) was formed following the merger of Parti Bumiputera and PESAKA in 1973. In the same year, SCA was ejected out of the Sarawak Alliance which led to its demise. Meanwhile, Sarawak Alliance was succeeded by Barisan Nasional (BN) coalition which was inclusive of more parties. Abdul Rahman was able to lead his BN coalition to another victory in 1974 Sarawak state election, where the coalition secured a total of 30 seats out of 48 seats although the SNAP party won 18 seats for the opposition bench. The PBB party was able to increase its popular vote from 47.3 percent in 1970 to 70.3 percent in 1974. However, the secretary general of SUPP, Stephen Yong, who was also the deputy chief minister of Sarawak at that time, was defeated in the election. For the 1974 parliamentary election, Sarawak BN won 15 out of 24 seats while the remaining seats were won by SNAP. In order to neutralise the electoral threat by SNAP, Abdul Rahman decided to allow SNAP into the BN coalition on 1 November 1976. Therefore, there was an absence of opposition voice in Sarawak for a brief period. However, the relationship of Abdul Rahman with SUPP started to worsen after 1974 election. In May 1978, a delegation of SUPP leaders led by Stephen Yong tried to persuade the prime minister Hussein Onn to remove Abdul Rahman. However, the plan failed because 1978 election was around the corner. As a result, Abdul Rahman allowed the entry of peninsular-based Democratic Action Party (DAP) into Sarawak in 1978 in order to check the Chinese electoral support towards SUPP. On 28 March 1978, Parti Anak Jati Sarawak (PAJAR) was formed due to dissatisfaction of a number of Malays towards Abdul Rahman's increased tolerance to cronyism and his disregard of the welfare of Malay community. Abdul Rahman decided not to dissolve the Council Negeri of Sarawak during the 1978 Malaysian general election because he needed to tackle the opposition by the PAJAR party and solve the allocation of state assembly seats after the inclusion of SNAP into the BN coalition. However, Abdul Rahman's BN coalition put up a strong showing in the 1978 parliamentary election by winning 23 out of 24 parliamentary seats in Sarawak. The remaining one seat was won by Sarawak People's Party (SAPO). Abdul Rahman dissolved the Council Negri one year after the parliamentary election. This was the first time in the history of Sarawak that the state election was held separately from the national parliamentary election. Both elections continue to be held separately since then. The Sarawak BN coalition won 45 out of 48 state assembly seats with 61.23 percent of the popular vote in the 1979 Sarawak state election. ===Relationship with Malaysian federal government=== Prior to 1974 Sarawak state election, Rahman threatened to step down because of lack of support by the federal government to face the election. Sarawak secretary Abang Yusuf Puteh met the prime minister to resolve the allocation issue. Abdul Rahman subsequently changed his mind and continue his rule over Sarawak. He also went to into an argument with federal government because mal-treatment of Sarawak state agencies in a number of matters. Despite the occasional upheaval with the federal government, Abdul Rahman generally maintained a good relationship with the federal government especially during the administration of Tun Abdul Razak. ===Retirement=== Abdul Rahman underwent a successful heart surgery in London in October 1980. With his failing health, Rahman finally decided to step down from the chief minister post while appointing his nephew and successor Abdul Taib Mahmud on 26 March 1981. Upon announcing his retirement, Rahman said that: ==Appointment to Governor of Sarawak== In 1981, he resigned his post as the Chief Minister and became the Governor of Sarawak. However, Abdul Rahman bin Ya'kub retained his influence over the state's principal levers of patronage such as land development permits, government contracts, and timber licenses.Ross. M.L (2001). In Timber booms and institutional breakdown in Southeast Asia. Cambridge University Press. p. 148-149. . Google Book Search. Retrieved on 1 December 2009. He later quit his post as the governor of Sarawak in 1985 due to health reasons. ==1987 Ming Court Affair== This political crisis already started brewing when Abdul Rahman bin Ya'kub was the governor of Sarawak. He criticised his nephew in a speech at a ceremony of opening of Bintulu port in 1983. New Straits Times In 1985, Abdul Rahman was involved in a bitter dispute with his nephew, Abdul Taib Mahmud over allocation rights. In 1987, Abdul Rahman formed a new party named Parti Persatuan Rakyat Malaysia Sarawak (PERMAS) to challenge Taib Mahmud at the polls. He also formed an alliance with Sarawak Dayak People's Party (PBDS) to unseat Taib Mahmud. In March 1987, 27 of the 48 state assemblymen suddenly directed their support to Abdul Rahman bin Ya'kub while calling Taib Mahmud to resign as a chief minister. Among the defectors were Taib's 4 cabinet ministers and 3 assistant ministers. A war of accusations on timber concessionaires then broke out between Abdul Rahman bin Ya'kub and Taib Mahmud. Taib revoked 30 timber licenses held by his defectors and Abdul Rahman's clients. Taib then accused Abdul Rahman for awarding 1.25 million hectares of logging concessions worth RM 22.5 billion to Abdul Rahman himself and his relatives. Abdul Rahman bin Ya'kub, in return, revealed a list of timber concessions covering 1.6 million hectares held by Taib's clients and family.Politics, Law and the Logging Industry URL assessed on 1 December 2009 Despite the unsuccessful attempt at the 1987 Sarawak state election, Abdul Rahman continued his struggle with his allies, Sarawak Dayak People's Party against Taib's led Sarawak Barisan Nasional until 1991 Sarawak state election when Taib's coalition won an overwhelming majority of 49 out of 56 seats in the state assembly.Borneo anti-logging party loses election The Age ==Later life== Abdul Rahman celebrated his 80th birthday in Hilton Hotel, Kuching in 2008. During the grand ceremony, he hugged his nephew, Pehin Sri Abdul Taib Mahmud, marking the end of the 20-year-old strained relationship between an uncle and a nephew after the Ming Court Affair. He said that he stitched up his relationship with Taib because \\"blood is thicker than water\\". He was active in religious activities as he conducted free religious classes for the public at his residence, \\"Sri Bahagia\\", in Petra Jaya. ==Death== Abdul Rahman bin Ya'kub was admitted into the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of Normah Specialist Medical Centre, Kuching in early November 2014 due to health problems. He lost appetite and had to rely on ventilation equipments. He died peacefully at 9:40 pm on 9 January 2015, aged 87. He was accorded a state funeral by the Sarawak state government and laid to rest at Samariang Muslim Cemetery in Petra Jaya, Kuching. ==Honours== ===Honours of Malaysia=== * : ** 50px Commander of the Order of the Defender of the Realm (PMN) – Tan Sri (1977) ** 50px Grand Commander of the Order of the Defender of the Realm (SMN) – Tun (1982) * : ** 50px Knight Commander of the Order of the Star of Sarawak (PNBS) – Dato' Sri ** 50px Knight Grand Commander of the Order of the Star of Hornbill Sarawak (DP) – Datuk Patinggi * : ** Knight Grand Commander of the Order of the Crown of Johor Knight Grand Commander of the Order of the Crown of Johor (SPMJ) – Dato' * : ** 50px Knight Grand Commander of the Order of the Crown of Kelantan (SPMK) – Dato' * : ** 50px Grand Knight of the Order of the Crown of Pahang (SIMP) – Dato' Indera * : ** 50px Knight Grand Commander of the Order of the Crown of Selangor (SPMS) – Dato' Seri (1980) * : ** 50px Knight Grand Companion of the Order of Loyalty to the Royal House of Kedah (SSDK) – Dato' Seri * : ** 50px Knight Grand Commander of the Order of the Crown of Perlis (SPMP) – Dato' Seri * : ** 50px Grand Commander of the Order of Kinabalu (SPDK) – Datuk Seri Panglima ==See also== * Yang di-Pertua Negeri Sarawak * Chief Minister of Sarawak ==References== ==Further reading== * Suhaimi Mokhtar, Putera Kenyalang: Satu Dekad Penuh Cabaran, 1981. ==External links== * Abdul Rahman Ya'kub official religious blog Category:Yang di-Pertua Negeri of Sarawak Category:1928 births Category:2015 deaths Category:Chief Ministers of Sarawak Category:Sarawak state ministers Category:Government ministers of Malaysia Category:Melanau people Category:Malaysian Muslims Category:People from Sarawak Category:Sarawak Malaysian People's Association politicians Category:Parti Pesaka Bumiputera Bersatu politicians Category:Members of the Dewan Rakyat Category:Members of the Sarawak State Legislative Assembly Category:Malaysian lawyers Category:Members of Lincoln's Inn Category:Malaysian political party founders Category:Knights Commander of the Most Exalted Order of the Star of Sarawak Category:Commanders of the Order of the Defender of the Realm Category:Grand Commanders of the Order of the Defender of the Realm Category:People associated with the National University of Malaysia Category:Education ministers of Malaysia ","title":"Abdul Rahman Ya'kub"},{"id":"2545571","text":"XNUMBERS is a multi-precision floating point computing and numerical methods library for Microsoft Excel.

During World War II, she worked as a cryptographer at Bletchley Park. ==Early life== She was the only child of actress Dorothy Dickson and matinée idol Carl Constantine Hyson (né Heisen). Her mother was known for being the Toast of Broadway. Hyson made her acting debut at age three, playing her mother's daughter in a silent film shot by director George Fitzmaurice shot at New York's Paramount studios. Hyson moved to England with her parents who eventually divorced. Her mother had a successful run in Jerome Kern's musical Sally and became the highest-paid actress in London. Hyson was schooled in England and France, but \\"Little Dot\\", as she was nicknamed, made several West End appearances in children's roles including J.M. Barrie's Quality Street. After seeing her, aged 13, in the theatrical adaptation of Daisy Ashford's The Young Visiters, Sybil Thorndike told her mother, \\"She's going to be a star.\\" ==Career== After finishing school in Paris, Hyson appeared in Soldiers of the King with Cicely Courtneidge at age 19. Her professional theatrical debut was in Ivor Novello's play Flies in the Sun. She worked on films during the daytime and appeared on stage at night. Filming at Blackpool with Gracie Fields Sing As We Go and acting in the West End in Dodie Smiths Touch Wood led to a nervous breakdown. She continued to be in light West End comedies and had a big hit in an adaptation of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice in 1936. In 1938 she appeared as Titania in Tyrone Guthrie's Old Vic revival of A Midsummer Night's Dream. During the Second World War, Hyson made several more films including You Will Remember with Robert Morley and the musical comedy Spare a Copper with George Formby. She also acted in revue, musical comedy and plays like the thriller Pink String and Sealing Wax in 1943 and an adaptation from Trollope Scandal at Barchester in 1944. In 1945 she played Lady Windermere in Oscar Wilde's Lady Windermere's Fan. She worked at the secret codebreaking establishment Bletchley Park during World War II, and, although married to Robert Douglas, was visited there by Anthony Quayle, who became her second husband. Quayle recalled that: \\"She had gone to work as a cryptographer at Bletchley Park. I went to see her there and found her ill and exhausted with the long night shifts.\\" She was a \\"byword for theatrical West End glamour\\" and after the war returned to the West End, joining John Gielgud’s Haymarket Company in 1945. She was married twice—to actor Robert Douglas (1935–45) and then actor and director Sir Anthony Quayle (1947–89, his death). After marrying Quayle in 1947 she soon retired from the stage to concentrate on bringing up their three children.McKay, Sinclair The Secret Life of Bletchley Park (2010, Aurum Press, London) pp. 7,72,306 ==Death== She was widowed in 1989 and died from a stroke on May 23, 1996, aged 81, in England, a year after the death of her mother, who died at age 102.

It is also known as the Northern Rivers funnel-web spider or northern funnel-web spider. ==Taxonomy== A member of the genus Hadronyche, the northern tree-dwelling funnel-web spider was first described in 1914, by William Joseph Rainbow in the genus Atrax, having been collected from the vicinity of the Richmond River. Rainbow suspected it may have needed to be placed in a genus separate to Atrax at the time, but demurred due to the lack of male specimens. The species name is derived from the Latin formidabilis \\"terrifying\\". Within the genus Hadronyche, it is classified in the heterogeneous cerberea group, alongside the southern tree-dwelling funnel-web (H. cerberea), the Blue Mountains funnel-web (H. versuta) and 12 other species from southern New South Wales and Victoria. ==Description== The northern tree-dwelling funnel-web spider has a glossy black carapace, and matte black or dark brown chelicerae, legs and abdomen. The dorsolateral surface of the abdomen may have a plum- or purplish tinge. The carapace of both sexes is longer and thinner than other members of the genus Hadronyche. With a body length of 40-50 millimetres, it is the largest member of the funnel-web subfamily Atracinae. The species is very similar to the ground-dwelling Darling Downs funnel-web spider (Hadronyche infensa); the male northern tree-dwelling funnel-web spider distinguished by its knobby spur on the tibia of the second pair of legs, which the male Darling Downs funnel-web spider lacks. Trapdoor spiders are more brown overall in colour. Male and female northern tree-dwelling funnel- web spiders rear up and display their fangs when confronted, drops of venom appearing on the ends of their fangs. They are unable to jump. The venom of the species is potentially deadly to humans, and regarded as the most toxic of those in the family Atracidae. A high proportion of bites—five out of eight recorded cases—from the northern tree-dwelling funnel-web spider result in severe symptoms of envenomation. The venom can be successfully treated with the antivenom for the related Sydney funnel-web spider (Atrax robustus). Symptoms of envenomation can occur within 15 to 20 minutes. Applying pressure bandages and immobilising the patient can significantly delay the onset of symptoms and remains a critical part of the management of an Australian funnel-web spider bite. Despite the venom lacking the δ-atracotoxin or atraxin of A. robustus, the symptoms are very similar to those from a Sydney funnel- web spider bite. Common symptoms include diaphoresis, hypertension, sinus tachycardia, muscle spasm or fasciculation, nausea and vomiting, altered consciousness and local pain at the bite site. Pulmonary oedema occurs frequently and comes on early. As these spiders are larger than the Sydney funnel-web spider, it may be that they inject greater amounts of venom, making the northern tree-dwelling funnel-web spider possibly the deadliest venomous spider species in the world per volume. ==Distribution and habitat== The northern tree-dwelling funnel-web spider is found in eastern Australia from South East Queensland to the Hunter River in New South Wales. This and the southern tree-dwelling funnel-web spider (Hadronyche cerberea) are the only two species of Australian funnel-web spiders that live predominantly in trees. It lives in rotting logs, branches and hollow furrows and pipes of trees, particularly tallowwood (Eucalyptus microcorys), as well as in epiphytes. They have been recorded in trees 30 m (100 ft) above the ground. Roving males are encountered after rain and at night between late October and early February. They seek shelter during the day. ==Ecology== The arboreal habitat suggests that wood-boring beetles are a main prey item of the northern tree-dwelling funnel-web spider. ==References== ==External links== Category:Mygalomorphae Category:Spiders of Australia Category:Spiders described in 1914 Category:Taxa named by William Joseph Rainbow ","title":"Hadronyche formidabilis"},{"id":"2545601","text":"Aerial view of the old Supreme Court building (foreground left), new Supreme Court building (middle) and City Hall (foreground right). The City Hall in Singapore is a national monument gazetted on 14 February 1992. It can be found in front of the historical Padang and adjacent to the Supreme Court of Singapore, it was designed and built by the architects of the Singapore Municipal Commission, A. Gordans and F. D. Meadows from 1926 to 1929. A flight of stairs takes visitors from the Corinthian colonnade to the main building. The building was constructed to replace several houses designed by architect G.D. Coleman. It was first known as Municipal Building until 1951 when Singapore was granted city status by King George VI. ==History== A plaque installed on the facade of the City Hall after it was gazetted as National Monument in 1992. The Municipal Building was planned and designed by the municipal architect S. D. Meadows, and then by Alexander Gordon, who took over the position in 1925. The London construction firm Perry and Co. (Overseas) Ltd. began in 1926 and was completed in 1929. By April the municipality moved into its new home. The Governor Hugh Clifford then officially opened the new Municipal Building on 23 July 1929. During World War II, when the Japanese occupied Singapore, they managed civic issues from the Municipal Building. Political affairs were already being conducted in the building. In 1943, the leader of the Indian National Army, Subhas Chandra Bose, rallied for Japanese support to help India be independent of British rule at the Municipal Building. British prisoners-of-war were rounded up in front of the building to march to POW camps such as Changi Prison and Selarang. On 12 September 1945, the Japanese General Itagaki surrendered to Lord Mountbatten on the steps of the building to end World War II in Singapore. In 1951, it was renamed to its present name City Hall to mark Singapore as a city, after being granted city status. In 1959, then Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew declared self-governance at City Hall. It was also the first time that the people of Singapore heard the new national anthem and saw their national flag. Lee and his eight cabinet ministers were then sworn into political office in the chamber of City Hall before the first Yang di-Pertuan Negara, Yusof bin Ishak, whose oath was taken at the City Hall as well. Lee Kuan Yew read out the Malaysia Proclamation at the City Hall in 1963, and declared that Singapore was no longer under British rule. The people celebrated the first Malaysia Day at the Padang which was outside the City Hall. When Singapore was no longer a part of Malaysia, The first National Day Parade was held there in 1966. The steps of the City Hall are also used as a VIP seating area when National Day Parades were held there. Singapore has a unitary system of government. It has not had a mayor or a city council since the end of British rule. The ruling People's Action Party abolished the City Council and the Rural Board in 1959, and the mayor's role disappeared. However, there are five Community Development Councils (namely Central Singapore, Northeast, Northwest, Southeast and Southwest) which was established in 1997. The CDCs are not directly elected bodies, rather each of them consists of 12 to 80 members appointed by the People's Association Chairman or Deputy Chairman. Each of the five CDCs is headed by a mayor, which is usually an elected MP in the Parliament of Singapore. In 1987, the building underwent a massive upgrade to allow the building to house governmental offices. In 1988, twelve courtrooms of the City Hall were transferred to the Supreme Court. This restoration work earned a Good Effort Award in 1994 by the Urban Redevelopment Authority. The City Hall was the place where Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong had his inauguration ceremony and the swearing-in of his cabinet in 1990. The building was also used for many government events over the years, it was used as a venue for the Singapore Biennale, and for the IMF and World Bank Meetings when it was held in Singapore in 2006. In 2015, The City Hall, together with the adjacent Old Supreme Court Building, has been converted into the National Gallery Singapore. ==See also== * City Hall MRT station * Supreme Court of Singapore ==References== * National Heritage Board (2002), Singapore's 100 Historic Places, Archipelago Press, ==External links== * City Hall * Singapore civic politics * CDCs Category:Downtown Core (Singapore) Singapore Category:Places in Singapore Category:National monuments of Singapore Category:Tourist attractions in Singapore Category:Landmarks in Singapore Category:Government buildings in Singapore Category:Government buildings completed in 1929 ","title":"City Hall, Singapore"},{"id":"2545618","text":"Robert Douglas Finlayson (9 November 1909 - 11 January 1999), known professionally as Robert Douglas, was an English stage and film actor, a television director and producer. ==Early career and personal life== Douglas was born in Fenny Stratford, Buckinghamshire.

For the last 200 years, there has been only one pond, although, as the name of Tryokhprudny Pereulok (, lit. Three-Pond Lane) suggests, there used to be more. The area of the existing pond is ; the depth is about two meters. The Ponds area is accessible via the Moscow Metro Mayakovskaya (eastern exit) and Pushkinskaya stations. ==History== ===Origin=== The area is named after the seventeenth century Patriarch's Goat Sloboda (Патриаршая Козья слобода) located on the Goat Marsh (Козье болото). This marsh was once connected by a brook to the Presnya River west; by 1739, when the first topographic map was compiled, the brook disappeared and the marsh separated from Presnya. People considered the swamp as an anomalous zone; apparently this caused a proverb \\"Фома поспешил, да людей насмешил – увяз на Патриарших\\" (\\"Thomas has hastened, but made people laugh - he stuck in Patriarshy\\"). ===19th century=== Patriarch Ponds, Skating Ring Building in Spring The pond acquired its present shape and was cleaned up in 1830–31, a part of a plan to rebuild Moscow after the Fire of 1812. The buildings around the pond were wooden; stone construction proceeded slowly through the second part of nineteenth century. In winters, the Russian Gymnastic Society operated a skating rink on the frozen pond. At the turn of the century, cheap rental buildings around the pond were occupied by the University students. During the December 1905, the area was held by left-wing student militia and became a war zone. The Ponds also housed Moscow's first hospital for children (the Filatov Hospital, which later relocated to nearby Garden Ring). ===Soviet history=== After the revolution the spacious apartments in buildings occupied by wealthy merchants were converted to communal apartments with shared kitchens. Mikhail Bulgakov and his wife Yelena Shilovskaya lived in this area in the 1930s. From the later 1930s to the 1950s, the lowrise buildings were torn down. The two most important Soviet-era buildings constructed were The House of Lions, a luxurious residence for Red Army Marshals (1945, designed by Zholtovsky workshop) and the 1935 Aviazhilstroy Apartments, a yellow postconstructivist high-rise by Vladimir Vladimirov (the building, conceived by Panteleimon Golosov, was completed in part. See original design). The boathouse on the ponds was built in wood in 1946. It was not until the 1980s that it was rebuilt in stone. ===Modern history=== In 2000–2002, the controversial Patriarch Apartments were built (design by Sergei Tkachenko); this 13-story building, crowned with a 1/50 scale model of Tatlin's Tower is also known as Alla Pugacheva's home. As of 2016 the neighborhood had become gentrified. Owners of the communal apartments had been bought out and the apartments reconverted into luxury residences. Fashionable shops, restaurants and bars serve crowds. The area is so popular that the upscale residents of the neighborhood complain. ==Bulgakov legacy== The Pond is one of the main settings of Mikhail Bulgakov's novel The Master and Margarita. Monuments to Bulgakov and to Ivan Krylov have been erected near the pond. The Master and Margarita begins with a tram accident by the pond. Although there was never any regular tram service or permanent tram tracks around the pond, for a short time in 1930s, there was a temporary service track used for night storage. ==Gallery== Image:Patriarshy.JPGHouses and the pond.

He played a significant role in pre- and post- colonial Ghana, which was formerly the Gold Coast, and is credited with giving Ghana its name. During his political career, Danquah was one of the primary opposition leaders to Ghanaian president and independence leader Kwame Nkrumah. Danquah was described as the \\"doyen of Gold Coast politics\\" by the Watson Commission of Inquiry into the 1948 Accra riots. ==Biography== ===Early life and education=== Danquah was born on 18 December 1895 in the town of Bepong in Kwahu in the Eastern Region of Ghana (then the Gold Coast). He was descended from the royal family of Ofori Panin Fie, once the rulers of the Akyem states, and one of the most influential families in Ghanaian politics. His elder brother is Nana Sir Ofori Atta I and his son is actor Paul Danquah. At the age of six, Danquah began schooling at the Basel Mission School at Kyebi. He attended the Basel Mission Senior School at Begoro. On successful completion of his standard seven examinations in 1912, he was employed by Vidal J. Buckle, a barrister-at-law in Accra, as a clerk, a job that aroused his interest in law. After passing the Civil Service Examinations in 1914, Danquah became a clerk at the Supreme Court of the Gold Coast, which gave him the experience to be appointed by his brother, Nana Sir Ofori Atta I, who had become chief two years earlier, as secretary of the Omanhene's Tribunal in Kyebi. Following the influence of his brother, Danquah was appointed as the assistant secretary of the Conference of Paramount Chiefs of the Eastern Province, which was later given statutory recognition to become the Eastern Provincial Council of Chiefs. His brilliance influenced his brother to send him to Britain in 1921 to read law. ===London years=== After two unsuccessful attempts at the University of London matriculation, Danquah passed in 1922, enabling him to enter the University College of London as a philosophy student. He earned his B.A. degree in 1925, winning the John Stuart Mill Scholarship in the Philosophy of Mind and Logic. He then embarked on a Doctor of Philosophy degree, which he earned in two years with a thesis entitled \\"The Moral End as Moral Excellence\\". He became the first West African to obtain the Doctor of Philosophy degree from a British university. While he worked on his thesis, he entered the Inner Temple and was called to the Bar in 1926. During his student days, he had two sons and two daughters by two different women, neither of whom he married. In London, Danquah took time off his studies to participate in student politics, serving as editor of the West African Students' Union (WASU) magazine and becoming the Union's president. ===Return to the Gold Coast=== Danquah went into private legal practice upon his return to Ghana in 1927. In 1929 he helped J. E. Casely Hayford found the Gold Coast Youth Conference (GCYC) and was Secretary General from 1937 to 1947.Kwesi Atta Sakyi, \\"Tribute to J.B. Danquah\\", Vibe Ghana, 17 January 2013. In 1931, Danquah established The Times of West Africa, originally called the West Africa Times, which was the first daily newspaper in Ghana published between 1931 and 1935. A column called \\"Women's Corner\\" was pseudonymously written by Mabel Dove, daughter of prominent barrister Francis Dove. She became Danquah's first wife in 1933, bearing him a son. Danquah later married Elizabeth Vardon. In 1935, he became an executive member of the International African Friends of Ethiopia, a Pan-Africanist organization based in London. ===Path to Independence=== Danquah became a member of the Legislative Council in 1946 and actively pursued independence legislation for his country. In 1947 he helped to found the pro-independence United Gold Coast Convention (UGCC) as a combination of chiefs, academics and lawyers,Birmingham, David. Kwame Nkrumah: The Father of African Nationalism (revised edition), Ohio University Press, 1998, p. 13. including George Alfred Grant, Robert Benjamin Blay, R. A. Awoonor-Williams, Edward Akufo-Addo, and Emmanuel Obetsebi-Lamptey. Kwame Nkrumah was invited to be the new party's general secretary. In 1948, following a boycott of European imports and subsequent rioting in Accra, Danquah was one of \\"the big six\\" (the others being Nkrumah, Akufo-Addo, Obetsebi-Lamptey, Ebenezer Ako-Adjei and William Ofori Atta) who were detained for a month by the colonial authorities. Danquah's historical research led him to agree with Nkrumah's proposition that on independence the Gold Coast be renamed Ghana after the early African empire of that name.\\"Joseph B. Danquah\\", Encyclopaedia of World Biography. However, Danquah and Nkrumah subsequently disagreed over the direction of the independence movement and parted ways after two years. Nkrumah went on to form the Convention People's Party (CPP) and eventually became the first president of independent Ghana. ===Arrest, detention and death=== Danquah stood as a presidential candidate against Nkrumah in April 1960 but lost the election. On 3 October 1961, Danquah was arrested under the Preventive Detention Act, on the grounds of involvement with alleged plans to subvert the CPP government.\\"Dr. J. B. Danquah Profile:\\", GhanaWeb. He was released on 22 June 1962. He was later elected president of the Ghana Bar Association.Danquah\\", Encyclopædia Britannica. Danquah was again arrested on 8 January 1964, for allegedly being implicated in a plot against the President. He suffered a heart attack and died while in detention at Nsawam Medium Prison on 4 February 1965.Cameron Duodu, \\"Dr J B Danquah's death is sticking in the throats of some people like a dead rat\\", Daily Guide, 21 February 2015. After the overthrow of the CPP government in February 1966 by the National Liberation Council (NLC), Danquah was given a national funeral and his status was rehabilitated. ===Literary output=== Among his writings are Gold Coast: Akan Laws and Customs and the Akim Abuakwa Constitution (1928), a play entitled The Third Woman (1943), and The Akan Doctrine of God (1944). The latter book demonstrated the compatibility of African religion with Christianity, and is considered a \\"milestone\\"Kevin Ward, \\"Africa\\", in Adrian Hastings (ed.), A World History of Christianity, Cassell/Eerdmans, 1999, p. 232. for African Protestants looking for ways to reclaim their African heritage. ===Establishment of the University of Ghana=== Danquah played an important role in the establishment of the University of Ghana, the premier and the largest university in Ghana. He successfully advocated for its establishment in 1948 after a British report on higher education in West Africa recommended that only one university college, to be located in Nigeria, in association with the University of London, would be feasible for the whole of West Africa.\\"Establishment of The University\\", University of Ghana. ===Legacy=== The J. B. Danquah Memorial Lecture Series was inaugurated in 1968 in memory of Danquah, who was also a founding member of the Ghana Academy of Arts and Sciences (GAAS). The Danquah Institute was set up in commemoration of his work and to promote his ideas posthumously. Danquah Circle, a roundabout at Osu in Accra, was also named after him. ==References== Category:1895 births Category:1965 deaths Category:Akan people Category:Ghanaian MPs 1951–1954 Category:Alumni of the University of London Category:Ghanaian Christians Category:Ghanaian Freemasons Category:United Gold Coast Convention politicians Category:Ghanaian historians Category:Candidates for President of Ghana Category:Ghanaian pan-Africanists Category:Ghanaian lawyers Category:Members of the Inner Temple Category:Ofori-Atta family Category:20th-century historians Category:20th-century lawyers ","title":"J.

In 1990, as a tribute to his chancellorship, the department of family medicine’s building was named for Aycock. This honor was in keeping with his long-standing interest in the field of medicine, and his support of family medicine as a way to address the health-care needs of North Carolina's rural citizens. The William B. Aycock professorship in his name was established by his many friends and is held as an endowment at the Medical Foundation of North Carolina, Inc. Aycock died after a fall on June 20, 2015 at the age of 99.https://alumni.unc.edu/news/former-chancellor-william-b-aycock-37-dies- at-99/ Aycock was a cousin of North Carolina Governor Charles Brantley Aycock and is best known to sports fans as the man who hired legendary basketball coach Dean Smith. He forced head coach Frank McGuire to resign after the 1960-61 season in the face of major recruiting violations. McGuire decided to leave and coach Wilt Chamberlain and the Philadelphia Warriors, before later moving to the University of South Carolina. Aycock named Smith, who had been McGuire's top assistant, as his successor. Years later, Aycock recalled that McGuire came to his office on a Saturday and told him he was resigning. Smith was waiting in McGuire's car, so Aycock called him in and offered him the job.Huffman, Diane. UNC chancellor recalls bold decision to hire Dean Smith. WNCN, 2015-02-08. When the 30-year-old Smith accepted the job, Aycock told him that wins and losses didn't matter as much as running a clean program that represented UNC well.Chansky, Art. Blue Blood:Duke-Carolina: Inside the Most Storied Rivalry in College Hoops. New York City: St. Martin's Press, 2006. This charge is somewhat ironic, as Smith led the Tar Heels to 879 wins over 36 years. ==References== ==External links== * Office of Chancellor of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill: William Brantley Aycock Records, 1957-1964, in the University Archives, UNC-Chapel Hill. * William B.

G. Wells' 1895 novella The Time Machine Time travel is a common theme in fiction and has been depicted in a variety of media, such as literature, television, film, and advertisements. The concept of time travel by mechanical means was popularized in H. G. Wells' 1895 story, The Time Machine. In general, time travel stories focus on the consequences of traveling into the past or the future. The central premise for these stories oftentimes involves changing history, either intentionally or by accident, and the ways by which altering the past changes the future and creates an altered present or future for the time traveler when they return home. In other instances, the premise is that the past cannot be changed or that the future is predetermined, and the protagonist's actions turn out to be either inconsequential or intrinsic to events as they originally unfolded. Some stories focus solely on the paradoxes and alternate timelines that come with time travel, rather than time traveling itself. They often provide some sort of social commentary, as time travel provides a \\"necessary distancing effect\\" that allows science fiction to address contemporary issues in metaphorical ways. Time travel in modern fiction is sometimes achieved by space and time warps, stemming from the scientific theory of general relativity. Stories from antiquity often featured time travel into the future through a time slip brought on by traveling or sleeping, or in other cases, time travel into the past through supernatural means, for example brought on by angels or spirits. Some even consider teleportation as a subset of time travel, being that it is immediate travelling from point to another. ==Time travel themes== ===Changing the past=== The idea of changing the past is logically contradictory, and results in a grandfather paradox. Paul J. Nahin, who has written extensively on the topic of time travel in fiction, states that \\"[e]ven though the consensus today is that the past cannot be changed, science fiction writers have used the idea of changing the past for good story effect\\". Time travel to the past and precognition without the ability to change events may result in causal loops. The possibility of characters inadvertently or intentionally changing the past also gave rise to the idea of \\"time police\\", people tasked with preventing such changes from occurring by themselves engaging in time travel to rectify such changes. ====Alternative future, history, timelines, and dimensions==== An alternative future or alternate future is a possible future that never comes to pass, typically when someone travels back into the past and alters it so that the events of the alternative future cannot occur, or when a communication from the future to the past effected a change that alters the future. Alternative histories may exist \\"side by side\\", with the time traveller actually arriving at different dimensions as he changes time. ====Butterfly effect==== The butterfly effect is the notion that small events can have large, widespread consequences. The term describes events observed in chaos theory where a very small change in initial conditions results in vastly different outcomes. The term was coined by mathematician Edward Lorenz years after the phenomenon was first described. The butterfly effect has found its way into popular imagination. For example, in Ray Bradbury's 1952 short story A Sound of Thunder, the killing of a single insect millions of years in the past drastically changes the world, and in the 2004 film The Butterfly Effect, the protagonist's small changes to their past results in extreme changes. ===Communication from the future=== In literature, communication from the future as a plot device is encountered in various science fiction and fantasy stories. Forrest J. Ackerman noted in his 1973 anthology of the best fiction of the year that \\"[t]he theme of getting hold of tomorrow's newspaper is a recurrent one\\". An early example of this device can be found in the H.G. Wells 1932 short story \\"The Queer Story of Brownlow's Newspaper\\", which tells the tale of a man who receives such a paper from 40 years in the future. The 1944 film It Happened Tomorrow also employs this device, with the protagonist receiving the next day's newspaper from an elderly colleague (who is possibly a ghost). Ackerman's anthology also highlights a short story by Robert Silverberg, \\"What We Learned From This Morning's Newspaper\\". In that story, a block of homeowners wake to discover that on November 22, they have received the New York Times for the coming December 1. As characters learn of future events affecting them through a newspaper delivered a week early, the ultimate effect is that this \\"so upsets the future that spacetime is destroyed\\". The television series Early Edition, inspired by the film It Happened Tomorrow, also revolved around a character who daily received the next day's newspaper, and sought to change some event therein forecast to happen. A newspaper from the future can be a fictional edition of a real newspaper, or an entirely fictional newspaper. John Buchan's novel The Gap in the Curtain, is similarly premised on a group of people being enabled to see, for a moment, an item in Times newspaper from one year in the future. During the Swedish general election of 2006, the Swedish liberal party used election posters which looked like news items, called Framtidens nyheter (\\"News of the future\\"), featuring things that Sweden in the future had become what the party wanted. A communication from the future raises questions about the ability of humans to control their destiny. If the recipient is allowed to presume that the future is malleable, and if the future forecast affects them in some way, then this device serves as a convenient explanation of their motivations. In It Happened Tomorrow, the events that are described in the newspaper do come to pass, and the protagonist's efforts to avoid those events set up circumstances which instead cause them to come about. By contrast, in Early Edition, the protagonist is able to successfully prevent catastrophes predicted in the newspaper, although if the protagonist does nothing, these catastrophes do come about. The visual novel Steins;Gate features characters sending short text messages backwards in time to avert disaster, only to find their problems are exacerbated due to not knowing how individuals in the past will actually utilize the information. When used in film, this type of time travel will involve people from the past and future communicating with each other. Alenjandro Agresti’s romantic fantasy film The Lake House follows a man and a woman who live in the same house two years apart who begin to develop a relationship when they discover a mailbox that send their letters through time. This is also used in the sci-fi thriller Frequency which follows a cop in 1999 that finds that his ham radio in a cross-time link with his father in 1969 and saves his life by warning him, but must face the consequences of his altered history. Time Lapse takes a more standard approach to communication from the future, with roommates discovering a camera that can take pictures 24 hours into the future. Where such a device is used, the source of the future news may not be explained, leaving it open to the reader or watcher to imagine that it might be technology, magic, an act of a god etc. In the H.G. Wells story, \\"The Queer Story of Brownlow's Newspaper\\", the author writes of the newspaper that \\"apparently it had been delivered not by the postman, but by some other hand\\". As in It Happened Tomorrow and Early Edition, no explanation is offered for the source of the future news. Ackerman suggests that \\"[t]he longer that authors mush on with the tale of... the next-week's-newspaper-now, the more difficult it becomes to pull a new rarebit out of the hat\\". ===Precognition=== Precognition has been explored as a form of time travel in fiction. Author J. B. Priestley wrote of it both in fiction and non-fiction, analysing testimonials of precognition and other \\"temporal anomalies\\" in his book Man and Time. His books include time travel to the future through dreaming, which upon waking up results in memories from the future. Such memories, he writes, may also lead to the feeling of déjà vu, that the present events have already been experienced, and are now being re-experienced. Infallible precognition, which describes the future as it truly is, leads to causal loops, a form of which is explored in Newcomb's paradox. The film 12 Monkeys heavily deals with themes of predestination and the Cassandra complex, where the protagonist who travels back in time explains that he can't change the past. ===Time loop=== A \\"time loop\\" or \\"temporal loop\\" is a plot device in which periods of time are repeated and re-experienced by the characters, and there is often some hope of breaking out of the cycle of repetition. Time loops are sometimes referred to as causal loops, but these two concepts are distinct. Although similar, causal loops are unchanging and self-originating, whereas time loops are constantly resetting. In a time loop when a certain condition is met, such as a death of a character or a clock reaching a certain time, the loop starts again, with one or more characters retaining the memories from the previous loop. Stories with time loops commonly center on the character learning from each successive loop through time. A popular term for a time loop is \\"groundhog day\\", a reference to the eponymous movie. ===Time paradox=== Many time travel works explore the topic of disrupting causality leading to time paradoxes. One of the most commonly referred to in time travel literature is known as the grandfather paradox. Many works of fiction explore what would happen if a time traveller went back in time and changed the past, for example if they killed their own grandparents. ===Time slip=== A time slip is a plot device used in fantasy and science fiction in which a person, or group of people, seem to travel through time by unknown means for a period of time. The idea of a time slip has been utilized by a number of science fiction and fantasy writers popularized at the end of the 19th century by Mark Twain's A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, having considerable influence on later writers. This is one of the main plot devices of time travel stories, the other being a time machine. The difference is that in time slip stories, the protagonist typically has no control and no understanding of the process (which is often never explained at all) and is either left marooned in a past time and must make the best of it, or is eventually returned by a process as unpredictable and uncontrolled. The plot device is also popular in children's literature. Time slips featuring a child and a realistic depiction of an earlier period enjoyed a vogue in the UK in the mid-20th century. Successful examples include Alison Uttley's A Traveller in Time (1939) going back to the time of Mary, Queen of Scots; Philippa Pearce's Tom's Midnight Garden (1958) returning to the 1880s and 1890s; Barbara Sleigh's Jessamy (1967) and Penelope Farmer's Charlotte Sometimes, both slipping back to the period of the First World War; Ruth Park's Playing Beatie Bow (1980), where the slip in Sydney, Australia, is to the squalor of 1873; and Helen Cresswell's Moondial, where three time periods are involved (1988, also televised). ===Time dilation=== Time dilation is a method of time travel featured in fiction based on Albert Einstein's Theory of Relativity, which states that moving objects experience time slower than stationary ones. When this type of time travel is used in a story, the time traveler is usually in space or in a space-time distortion, and the time dilation is either due to warped gravity or travel close to the speed of light. This type of time travel is a good method of forwards time travel. It can also be used to make people experience time faster than everyone else, allowing someone to travel to a relative past as in Contact and Clockstoppers. Examples of time dilation in fiction include Christopher Nolan’s 2014 sci-fi film Interstellar, where a major plot point in the story consists of the main character landing on a planet where time passes slower than on the outside. Ben Foster’s and Mark Dennis’ 2017 sci-fi action adventure film Time Trap, where the entire plot focuses on the time dilation aspect of the story, which is caused by a time- warped field within a cave, Franklin J. Schaffer’s 1968 sci-fi adventure film Planet of the Apes, based on the 1963 novel La Planète des Singes, where astronauts arrive in the distant future after traveling at near lightspeed, and time dilation is the method of time travel used throughout Orson Scott Card’s Ender's Game franchise. ===Time tourism=== A \\"distinct subgenre\\" of stories explore the possibility that time travel might be used as a means of tourism, with travelers curious to visit periods or events such as the Victorian Era or the Crucifixion of Christ, or to meet historical figures such as Abraham Lincoln or Ludwig van Beethoven. This theme can be addressed from two directions. An early example of present-day tourists travelling back to the past is Ray Bradburys A Sound of Thunder (1952), in which the protagonists are big game hunters who travel to the distant past to hunt dinosaurs. An early example of the other type, in which tourists from the future visit the present, is Catherine L. Moore and Henry Kuttners Vintage Season (1946), a story which was selected for inclusion in Volume Two of The Science Fiction Hall of Fame collection. ===Time war=== The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction describes a time war as a fictional war that is \\"fought across time, usually with each side knowingly using time travel ... in an attempt to establish the ascendancy of one or another version of history\\". Time wars are also known as \\"change wars\\" and \\"temporal wars\\". P. Nahin compiles a variety of examples of fictional works that raise issues framed as arising in a time war: ===Hitler and World War II=== In Western fiction, one common use of time travel technology is to travel back in time and attempt to kill Adolf Hitler in an attempt to avoid World War II and the Holocaust. Fiction that applies the Novikov self-consistency principle that the past can't be changed results in plots where attempts to assassinate Hitler or avert the war are destined to fail, or where they actually result in the rise of Hitler as history records it. Fiction that does allow the past to be changed often explores the unintended consequences of time travel or the butterfly effect, which result in Germany and Japan winning World War II. This outcome is also explored in parallel world fiction such as The Man in the High Castle. ==See also== *Eternal return *Future history *List of games containing time travel *List of time travel works of fiction *Time viewer ==References== ==Further reading== * ==External links== *Timelinks - the big list of time travel video, film, and television - over 700 films and television programs featuring time travel. *Time-Travel Fiction - Big list of adventures in time travel. *Andy's Anachronisms - Exploring the themes of time travel and alternate universes in literature and entertainment. * Category:History of fiction Category:Multiple time paths in fiction ","title":"Time travel in fiction"},{"id":"2545651","text":"Peter Palumbo may refer to: *Peter Palumbo, Baron Palumbo (born 1935), British property developer, art collector, and former chairman of the Arts Council of Great Britain *Peter Palumbo (politician) (born 1961), American politician and a Democratic member of the Rhode Island House of Representatives ","title":"Peter Palumbo"},{"id":"2545654","text":"Location of the Balearic Sea Limits of the Balearic Sea The Balearic Sea (endotoponym: Mar Balear in Catalan and Spanish) is a body of water in the Mediterranean Sea near the Balearic Islands.C.Michael Hogan. 2011.

The brand has a cult-like following, and has been featured by National Geographic, the Food Network, the Travel Channel and Vice Media. Celebrity chefs such as Anthony Bourdain, Andrew Zimmern, Dominique Crenn, and Matty Matheson chose King of Donair for filming, documenting and indulging. In 2015, the donair was named the official food of Halifax, with December 8 being National Donair Day. In addition to the donair, KOD is also known for their pizza, garlic fingers and other donair offerings such as donair egg rolls, donair plates, and donair pizza. ==History== ===Origins=== Pizza Corner, July 2006 The first King of Donair opened in 1973 on Quinpool Rd. in Halifax, Nova Scotia. It was founded by Greek immigrant and restaurateur Peter Gamoulakos, who owned a pizza shop called Velo's Pizza. While on trip to Greece, he ate a lot of gyros and was inspired to bring the dish to Canada. After trying to sell them at his pizza shop, he realized that Nova Scotians of the 1970s didn't have a palate for lamb and the yogurt-based tzatziki. He substituted spicy beef for lamb and created a sweet sauce made with evaporated milk. This new dish was based on the Turkish doner; although the first mention of doner kebab was in Bursa, Turkey, it became popular in Halifax in the 1970s. After perfecting the recipe, King of Donair was opened in 1973. The original King of Donair is located in the same building on Quinpool Rd. The chain has four other locations in Nova Scotia. ===Western Canada expansion=== The 2010s saw an expansion into Western Canada, beginning with pop-up shops in Alberta to test for economic viability. A two-day event was planned for March 4 in Calgary and March 5 in Banff National Park's Sunshine Village. The latter event was cancelled due to concerns about crowd size, while the Calgary event continued and raised money for the Alberta Children's Hospital. In 2018, two restaurants were opened, in Edmonton and Grand Prairie, Alberta. 2019 saw further expansion with a third Alberta location in Sherwood Park and its first Saskatchewan location at University Heights Suburban Centre in Saskatoon. Other cities announced in the Western Canada expansion were Vancouver, Kelowna and Victoria in British Columbia, Regina, Saskatchewan, and Winnipeg, Manitoba. It was reported that KOD planned to have at least one location in British Columbia by the end of 2018 with a total of ten that were expected to open that year. ==Disputes== In May 2012, the KOD location that was on the aptly named \\"Pizza Corner\\" in Halifax was closed due to the disrepair of the rented building. Owner Sam Nahas notified landlord John Manolopoulos that the lease was not being renewed for this reason, and took Manolopoulos to small claims court to be reimbursed $25,000 on various repairs to the old building. The restaurant had been a staple of Pizza Corner since the early 1990s. In 2015, KOD alleged that the Vancouver restaurant Donair King was infringing on its trademarks such as name and logo. KOD filed documents with the Federal Court of Canada saying its name has been associated with donairs, donair meat and donair sauce since the 1970s. The claim asked the court to order them to destroy menus, signs, packaging, promotional material, and business cards with the Donair King name. It also asked for punitive and exemplary damages as well as the legal costs to be covered. Donair King denied the allegations in a statement of defence, and offered to stop using the Donair King name if King of Donair agreed to take no legal action. The statement of claim was filed Sept. 23 and Donair King filed its defence Oct. 26. Calgary was planned as one of the first cities to be included in KOD's Western Canada expansion in 2016. The company filed a statement of claim in April 2016 that stated donair establishments in Calgary such as King Donair and Shawrama, King Donair and King Shwarnae Donair, all registered under the numbered company 974819 Alberta Ltd., were active during this time and infringing on its trademark. Owner Norman Nahas cited that people would think KOD is already in Western Canada. 974819 Alberta Ltd. had yet to file a statement of defence during that time. King of Donair alleges that it previously wrote to King Donair, asking it to \\"cease and desist from its infringing and otherwise unlawful activities\\", to no effect, court documents state. ==Pop culture== *On April 18, 2004; King of Donair first appears in the season 4 episode of The Trailer Park Boys entitled \\"A Man's Gotta Eat\\". Randy (played by Patrick Roach) frequently visits for donairs where he prostitutes himself for coupons. *Rapper Quake Matthews released a single in 2015 entitled \\"Down With the King\\" which is a tribute to the donair and King of Donair. It features Randy and T from Trailer Park Boys. ==Awards and honours== Winner of The Coast's Best of Halifax Reader's Choice Award for Best Donair: 1998–2000, 2002–2003, 2006–2010, and 2013–2016 (14 of 19 years). ==References== == External links == * * King of Donair - Original Quinpool Rd. location * King of Donair - Clayton Park, Halifax Category:Companies based in Halifax, Nova Scotia Category:Pizza chains of Canada Category:Year of establishment missing Category:Restaurants established in 1973 Category:Fast-food chains of Canada ","title":"King of Donair"},{"id":"2545676","text":"Abang Muhammad Salahuddin bin Abang Barieng is the former Yang di-Pertua Negeri (Governor) of the Malaysian state of Sarawak from 1977 to 1981, and again from 2001 to 2014.

As the owner and manager of the record company Mariann Grammofon AB, Karlsson became a familiar face to the Swedish public as the man behind Carola Häggkvist. In 1984 he started Skara Sommarland, a theme park. In 1991, Karlsson and count Ian Wachtmeister started the populist political party New Democracy. Attracting major media attention, and with a patriotic platform, the party received 6.7 percent of the vote in the parliamentary election in September. With no previous political experience, Karlsson suddenly found himself elected to the Riksdag as a Member of Parliament. When New Democracy imploded due to internal struggles and failed in the 1994 general election Karlsson went back to being a full-time businessman. He has started the popular Swedish reality television show Fame Factory, (a programme somewhat similar to the British show Pop Idol), in which he played an important role. Many Mariann artists have entered Melodifestivalen, the Swedish qualifications for the Eurovision Song Contest. From 1978 to 2005, approximately 120 songs from Karlsson's record company competed, and 14 of these went on to represent Sweden in the Eurovision Song contest. Mariann artists include Herreys and Charlotte Perrelli, who went on to win the Eurovision Song Contest (1984 and 1999, respectively). In March 2005, Karlsson filled out an application for membership in the Liberal People's Party during a television interview. When the party immediately responded with criticism of him, calling the move a media stunt, he did not go through with his application. Karlsson was a judge in the first five seasons of the TV show \\"Talang\\" on TV4, the Swedish version of America's Got Talent, between 2007–2011. ==External links== * Mariann Grammofon - Official page * \\"Storskalig attack gör Bert Karlsson till vinnare\\"- 5 March 2005 Dagens Nyheter article on Karlsson and Melodifestivalen. * \\"Här blir Bert folkpartist\\" 30 March 2005 Aftonbladet article on Karlsson's membership application to the Liberal People's Party. * Liberal People's Party press release- 30 March 2005 press release from the Liberal People's Party following Karlsson's statements. * \\"Bert Karlsson ville bli folkpartist – men nekades\\" - 30 March 2005 Aftonbladet article on Karlsson's reaction to the party press release. */ This is the jury, Tv4.se Category:1945 births Category:Living people Category:People from Skövde Municipality Category:New Democracy (Sweden) politicians Category:Swedish businesspeople Category:Swedish record producers Category:Swedish entertainers Category:Swedish television personalities Category:Melodifestivalen Category:Political party founders ","title":"Bert Karlsson"},{"id":"2545679","text":"The National Archive of Computerized Data on Aging (NACDA) , located within ICPSR, is funded by the National Institute on Aging (NIA). NACDA's mission is to advance research on aging by helping researchers to profit from the under- exploited potential of a broad range of datasets. NACDA acquires and preserves data relevant to gerontological research, processing as needed to promote effective research use, disseminates them to researchers, and facilitates their use. By preserving and making available the largest library of electronic data on aging in the United States, NACDA offers opportunities for secondary analysis on major issues of scientific and policy relevance. ==Description== A program within the Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR) at the University of Michigan. The NACDA collection consists of over sixteen hundred datasets relevant to gerontological research and represents the world's largest collection of publicly available research data on the aging lifecourse. ==History== The NACDA Program on Aging began over 40 years ago under the sponsorship of the United States Administration on Aging (AoA). At that time NACDA was seen as a novel experiment - neither the concept of a research archive devoted to aging issues nor the idea of making research data freely available to the public were well established. Over the years, NACDA’s mission has changed both in scope and in direction. Originally conceived as a storehouse for data, NACDA has aggressively pursued a role of increasing involvement in the research community by actively promoting and distributing data. In 1984, the NIA became the sponsor of the National Archive of Computerized Data on Aging, and NACDA has flourished under its support. Over the years, NACDA has evolved and grown in response to changes in technology. In many instances, leading the pace of change in methodology related to the storage, protection, and distribution of data. NACDA was one of the first organizations to develop and release studies on CD-ROM. NACDA was also one of the first archives to experiment with the idea of offering electronic research data as a public good, free to all interested individuals at no charge. The initial collection of 28 public use datasets first offered on the internet in 1992 has now expanded to over 1,600 datasets that are freely available to any researcher. The entire collection is stored online at the NACDA website, offering immediate access to gerontological researchers. ==See also== *National Institute on Aging (NIA) *United States Administration on Aging (AoA) == External links == * NACDA * ICPSR Category:Databases in the United States Category:Gerontology ","title":"National Archive of Computerized Data on Aging"},{"id":"2545687","text":"Animation of heat-shrink tubing, before and after shrinking Heat-shrink tubing (or, commonly, heat shrink or heatshrink) is a shrinkable plastic tube used to insulate wires, providing abrasion resistance and environmental protection for stranded and solid wire conductors, connections, joints and terminals in electrical work. It can also be used to repair the insulation on wires or to bundle them together, to protect wires or small parts from minor abrasion, and to create cable entry seals, offering environmental sealing protection. Heat- shrink tubing is ordinarily made of polyolefin, which shrinks radially (but not longitudinally) when heated, to between one-half and one-sixth of its diameter. Heat-shrink tubing is manufactured in a multitude of varieties and chemical makeups with the exact composition of each type being dependent on the intended application.Heat Shrink Tubing Users Guide From near microscopically-thin-wall tubing to rigid, heavy-wall tubing, each type has precise design and chemical additives that make it suitable for meeting any of a wide variety of environmental demands. Heat-shrink tubing is rated by its expansion ratio, a comparison of the differences in expansion and recovery rate. ==Use== The unshrunk tubing is fitted on the wire before making the connection, then slid down to cover the joint after it is made. If the fit is tight, silicone lubricant can be applied without compromising the heat-shrink material. The tubing is then shrunk to wrap tightly around the joint by heating in an oven or with a hot air gun or other source of hot gas flow. Convenient but less consistent methods for shrinking the tube include a soldering iron held close to but not touching the tube, or the heat from a lighter. Uncontrolled heat can cause uneven shrinkage, physical damage and insulation failure, and these methods are not recommended by heatshrink suppliers. If overheated, heat-shrink tubing can melt, scorch or catch fire like any other plastic. Heating causes the tubing to contract to between half and one sixth of its original diameter, depending on the material used, providing a snug fit over irregularly shaped joints. There is also longitudinal shrinking, usually unwanted and to a lesser extent than narrowing, of typically around 6%.cableorganizer.com: How to Use Heat Shrink Tubing The tubing provides good electrical insulation, protection from dust, solvents and other foreign materials, and mechanical strain relief, and is mechanically held in place (unless incorrectly oversized or not properly shrunk) by its tight fit. Video of adhesive-lined heat-shrink tubing shrinking Some types of heat-shrink contain a layer of thermoplastic adhesive on the inside to help provide a good seal and better adhesion, while others rely on friction between the closely conforming materials. Heating non-adhesive shrink tube to very near the melting point may allow it to fuse to the underlying material as well. Heatshrink tubing is sometimes sold in pre-cut lengths, with a solder blob at the center of the length, as this configuration is specified by Daimler-Benz for automotive electrical repairs. One application that has used heatshrink in large quantities since the early 1970s is the covering of fibreglass helical antennas, used extensively for 27 MHz CB Radio. Many millions of these antennas have been coated this way. ==Manufacture== Heat- shrink tubing was invented by Raychem Corporation in 1962. It is manufactured from a thermoplastic material such as polyolefin, fluoropolymer (such as FEP, PTFE or Kynar), PVC, neoprene, silicone elastomer or Viton. The process for making heat-shrink tubing is as follows: First the material is chosen based on its properties. The material is often compounded with other additives (such as colorants, stabilizers, etc.) depending on the application. A starting tube is extruded from the raw material. Next, the tube is taken to a separate process where it is cross-linked, usually through radiation. The cross-linking creates a memory in the tube. Then the tube is heated to just above the polymer's crystalline melting point and expanded in diameter, often by placing it in a vacuum chamber. While in the expanded state it is rapidly cooled. Later, when heated (above the crystalline melting point of the material) by the end user, the tubing shrinks back to its original extruded size. The material is often cross-linked through the use of electron beams,Accelerator apps: heat-shrink tubing , Symmetry, Dimensions of Particle Physics. V. 7, Issue 2, Apr. 10 peroxides, or moisture. This cross-linking creates the memory in the tubing so that it is able to shrink back to its original extruded dimensions upon heating, producing a material called heat-shrink tubing. For outdoor use, heat-shrink tubing often has a UV stabiliser added. ==Materials== Different applications require different materials: * Elastomeric tubes maintain high flexibility even at low temperatures and meet stringent international specifications. Their operating temperature range is -75 to 150 °C. The material is resistant to many chemicals (including diesel and petrol) and has good resistance to abrasion, even in severe environmental conditions. A common shrink ratio is 2:1. * Fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP) is a lower-cost alternative to PTFE. It is a versatile electrical insulator and is inert to most chemicals and solvents. Additionally, it is highly resistant to extreme heat, cold, and Ultraviolet radiation, making it an excellent material for heat-shrink tubing applications. * Polyolefin tubes, the most common kind, have maximum continuous-use temperatures from -55 to 135 °C, and are used by the military, aerospace and railway industries. They are flexible and fast- shrinking, and manufactured in a wide range of colors (including clear), which can be used for color-coding wires. With the exception of black, they tend to have lower resistance to ultraviolet light; accordingly, only black is recommended for outdoor applications. Polyolefin tubing shrinks at 143°C. Polyolefin heat-shrink tubing typically shrinks 2:1 diametrically, but high- grade polyolefin heat-shrink is also available with a 3:1 ratio. Polyolefin tubing may withstand being touched with a soldering iron. * PVC tubes are usually lower cost than other materials. PVC takes colors exceptionally well and is available in nearly unlimited colors both opaque and transparent. PVC can be used outdoors with the addition of a UV stabilizer. PVC heat-shrink tends to burn if touched with a soldering iron. * Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) tubes are intended for high temperature applications. * Silicone rubber offers excellent resistance to scrape abrasion and high flexibility. Its operating temperature range is -50 to 200 °C * PTFE (fluoropolymer) tubes have a wide operating temperature range (-55 to 175 °C), a low coefficient of friction, and high resistance to chemicals and punctures. * Viton, another fluoropolymer with high chemical resistance, is widely used in hydraulic equipment. It is highly flexible, with a very wide operating temperature range of -55 to 220 °C, making it suitable for protecting sensitive devices against heat. Other special materials exist, offering qualities such as resistance to diesel and aviation fuels, and there is also woven fabric, providing increased abrasion resistance in harsh environments. ==Types== Heat-shrink tubing is available in a variety of colors for color-coding of wires and connections. In the early twenty-first century heat-shrink tubing started to be used for PC modding to tidy up the interior of computers and provide an appearance considered pleasing. In response to this opening market, manufacturers started producing heat-shrink tubing in luminous and UV reactive varieties. Although usually used for insulation, heat-shrink tubing with a conductive lining is also available, for use on joints which are not soldered. Specialty heat- shrink tubing, known as \\"solder sleeves\\", have a tube of solder inside of the heat-shrink tubing, allowing the heat source to electrically join the two wires by melting the solder and simultaneously insulate the junction with the tubing. Solder sleeves also commonly contain a ring of heat-activated sealant on the inside of each end of the tubing, allowing the connection to also be made waterproof. Heat-shrink end caps, closed at one end, are used to insulate the exposed cut ends of insulated wires. ==See also== *Cold shrink tubing *Electrical wiring *Heat-shrinkable sleeve *Electrical tape ==Main Standards and certificates== UL224-2010 SAE AS23053 ASTM D 2671 ASTM D3150 ==References== ==External links== *How heat shrink tubing works Category:Electronics work tools Category:Plastics applications Category:Articles containing video clips ","title":"Heat-shrink tubing"},{"id":"2545696","text":"Hot Springs is a census-designated place (CDP) in Bath County, Virginia, United States.

Kent Gemmell Douglas (February 6, 1936 – April 12, 2009) was a professional ice hockey defenceman and coach. ==Playing career== ===Early career=== Douglas started his career with the Kitchener Canucks in the Ontario Hockey Association. He spent two seasons with the Canucks and eight seasons in the American Hockey League and the Western Hockey League with the Springfield Indians, Winnipeg Warriors and the Vancouver Canucks. In Springfield, Douglas came under the tutelage of Hall of Famer Eddie Shore, the then owner of the Indians. There, Douglas learned Shore's tough defensive style of play which contributed to the Indians three consecutive Calder Cup championships from 1960–1962. ===Later years=== In 1962–63, Douglas made his first trip to the National Hockey League. He played with the Toronto Maple Leafs and continued his aggressive style of play during his rookie season in the NHL. In 70 games, Douglas recorded 22 points and 105 PIM. The Leafs, that year, made it to the Stanley Cup Finals, where they played the Detroit Red Wings. Toronto defeated the Red Wings in five games to win the Stanley Cup giving Douglas a Stanley Cup in his first season in the NHL. Douglas was also awarded the Calder Memorial Trophy as rookie of the year in the NHL - the first defenceman to do so. The following season, Douglas split his time between the Leafs and the Rochester Americans of the AHL. He played 41 games with the Leafs and 27 games with the Americans that season. His 41 games with the Leafs saw him record only one point. Douglas remained with the Leafs until 1966–67, when he was demoted to the minors despite having appeared in three NHL All-Star Games and having played on three Stanley Cup winners with the Maple Leafs. Although he was part of Toronto's three Stanley Cup wins, Douglas' name was engraved on the Cup only once, in 1962-63. In 1967–68, Douglas was claimed by the California Seals in the 1967 NHL Expansion Draft. The California Seals changed their name before the start of the 1967-68 season to the Oakland Seals. Douglas played 40 games with the Seals before being traded to the Detroit Red Wings. Douglas would play the remainder of the season and the 1968–69 season with the Red Wings. He was sent down to the AHL again the following year with the Rochester Americans. Douglas would stay in the AHL for the next three seasons, making the Calder Cup Finals with the Baltimore Clippers in 1971–72. In 1972–73 Douglas joined the New York Raiders in the World Hockey Association. Douglas played one season with the Raiders before returning to the minor leagues once again. He would play three more seasons before retiring. Douglas died of cancer in 2009 at the age of 73. == Awards and achievements == * Calder Cup Championships (1960, 1961, & 1962) * AHL First All-Star Team (1962) * Eddie Shore Award (1962) * Calder Memorial Trophy (1963) * Played in NHL All-Star Game (1962, 1963 & 1964) * Stanley Cup Championship (1963) * AHL Second All-Star Team (1971) ==Career statistics== ===Regular season and playoffs=== { border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"1\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"text-align:center; width:60em\\" - bgcolor=\\"#e0e0e0\\" ! colspan=\\"3\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\" ! rowspan=\\"100\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\" ! colspan=\\"5\\"Regular season ! rowspan=\\"100\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\" ! colspan=\\"5\\"Playoffs - bgcolor=\\"#e0e0e0\\" !

Gerhard Hanappi (16 February 1929 – 23 August 1980) was an Austrian football midfielder who is often regarded as one of the greatest Austrian footballers. He is also the father of Hardy Hanappi. ==Club career== A versatile midfielder, Hanappi started his career at SC Wacker Wien, where he made his Bundesliga debut in 1947. Deemed as Austria's biggest football talent, he then controversially moved to play for big city rivals Rapid Vienna from 1950 till 1965. His time at Rapid proved to be very successful, winning the Austrian Championship title 7 times. He also captained the side for seven years and was chosen in Rapid's Team of the Century in 1999. ==International career== He made his debut for Austria at only 19 years of age in November 1948 against Sweden and was a participant at the 1954 World Cup in Switzerland, where they reached 3rd place, and at the 1958 World Cup. He captained the national team from 1955 on. His last international was a September 1962 match against Czechoslovakia. He earned 93 caps, scoring 12 goals.Appearances for Austrian National Team – RSSSF He has held the national team appearances record until Anton Polster earned his 94th cap in June 1998. ==Playing style== One of the finest midfielders of his generation,Europe's best Player of the Century – IFFHS Hanappi was nominally a goalscoring wing half, however his versatility allowed him to successfully play in almost all positions. Hanappi's technical abilities and creativity allowed him to play as an effective play-maker. He was also very intelligent with an excellent sense of anticipation which made him very useful in defensive duties, and also enabled him to make well timed runs in the box.

The Molucca Sea has a total surface area of 77,000 square miles (200,000 square km). The Molucca Sea is rich in coral and has many diving sites due to the deepness of its waters. The deepness of the water explains the reasoning behind dividing the sea into three zones, which functions to transport water from the Pacific Ocean to the shallower seas surrounding it. The deepest hollow in the Molucca Sea is the 15,780-foot (4,810-meter) Batjan (Indonesian: Bacan) basin. This region is known for its periodic experiences of earthquakes, which stems from the sea itself being a micro plate, in which the Molucca Sea is being subducted in two opposite directions: one in the direction of the Eurasian Plate to the west and the other in the direction of the Philippines Sea Plate to the east.Celebes Sea, with the Molucca Sea to the southeast ==Location== The Molucca Sea borders the Banda Sea to the south and the Celebes Sea to the west.

In football, he was a 1995 SCHUTT All-American High School Football Team selection after being a three-year starter at both fullback and linebacker. As a senior, he rushed 120 times for 1,296 yards and 21 TDs from the fullback slot and averaged 18 tackles per game as a linebacker, while helping Oswego to 9-1 mark in 1995. He also averaged 42 yards per punt as a senior. He was named to Super 25 all-area team by Chicago Sun-Times for his efforts. As a junior, he was also an All-Conference pick in 1994 while carrying 123 times for 1,076 yards and 20 touchdowns. He'd been captain of the team as a junior and senior. In track & field, he was a state qualifier on both the shot put and the discus his junior year. == College career == Goodspeed was a four-year starter at Notre Dame where he rushed for 399 yards and scored two touchdowns – one on a 22-yard reception and another on a 33-yard blocked punt return.

As a junior, he played 12 games in 1998 as a backup to veteran Jamie Spencer at fullback. He ranked fourth in rushing with 202 yards, with his 7.0-yards-per-carry mark tops among Irish running backs and was on all the special teams. He was named ABC Sports/Chevrolet Notre Dame MVP vs. Arizona State. He was the Irish starter at fullback to begin the 1997 campaign, earning him the first-team assignment in the first three games of 1997. However, he separated his right shoulder on a fourth down fake-field goal attempt vs. Michigan State, which caused him to miss the last nine regular-season games as well as the Independence Bowl.http://www.und.com/sports/m-footbl/mtt/goodspeed_joey00.html As a freshman, he played in nine games as a rookie fullback in 1996, working behind Marc Edwards and Jamie Spencer. He made 85 appearances with the Irish special teams to help become one of six freshmen to earn monograms. He had one pass reception that produced a 22-yard touchdown play vs. Pittsburgh and scored a touchdown on 33-yard return of blocked punt vs. Rutgers. He graduated from Notre Dame with a degree in management. == Professional career == ===Pre- draft=== Goodspeed measured 5-11⅝ and 253 pounds and ran a 4.82 second forty- yard dash at the Notre Dame pro day. ===Pittsburgh Steelers=== Goodspeed was signed by the Pittsburgh Steelers following the 2000 draft, but was released during training camp in September.

His birth, death date and origins are all unknown. Upon Alan, Lord of Galloway's death in 1234, Galloway was left without a legitimate feudal heir. Alexander II had decided to partition the lordship between the Anglo-Norman husbands of Alan's three living daughters, Roger de Quincy (married to Ela), John de Balliol (married to Derborgaill) and William de Forz (married to Cairistiona). However, Alan had left an illegitimate son, Thomas. In Gaelic succession law, Thomas was a perfectly acceptable heir. Thus the native Galwegians and the Gaelic clergy of the province rose in revolt against the Scottish king. ==Leader of Galloway Revolt== The revolt of the Galwegians started in 1235, under Gille Ruadh's leadership. Matthew Paris says that Manx and Irish forces got involved too. Thomas received help from his father's father-in-law, Hugh de Lacy the Earl of Ulster, Hugh had his own problems which limited his participation. Thomas also seems to have gained support from Ruaidrí mac Ragnaill and the Uí Domnaill of Tír Conaill. Alexander soon invaded Galloway. Gille Ruadh ambushed the royal army, almost bringing it to disaster. However the Scottish King was saved by Fearchar, Mormaer of Ross. Gille Ruadh and Thomas escaped to Ireland, Alexander returned north, and Walter Comyn, Earl of Menteith, was left to subdue the province, ravaging the lands and monastic establishments (Glenluce Abbey and Tongland Abbey were both sacked, and their abbots punished). Soon afterwards, Gille Ruadh returned from Ireland with a new army. The royal forces fled the province. However, for an unknown set of reasons, Gille Ruadh abandoned Thomas and gave himself up on favorable conditions to Patrick II, Earl of Dunbar. Thomas followed suit. The failure of the revolt ensured the death of the Lordship of Galloway as a united and distinct sub-kingdom of northern Britain. ==Notes== ==References== * Oram, Richard, The Lordship of Galloway, (Edinburgh, 2000), pp. 141–6.

They marked the beginning of a \\"new\\" Stargate SG-1 that continued after the . Despite seeing the departure of Richard Dean Anderson's Jack O'Neill, it sees the introduction of Ben Browder as Lt. Colonel Cameron Mitchell, Beau Bridges as Major General Hank Landry, and Lexa Doig as Dr. Carolyn Lam. They also bring in Claudia Black's character Vala Mal Doran as a recurring character, later to become a regular in Season 10, and introduce entire new storylines including further information about the Ancients, their links to Arthurian legends, and their origins. == Plot overview == ===Part 1=== Lieutenant Colonel Cameron Mitchell is at Stargate Command (SGC) staring at the Stargate for the first time. He piloted an F-302 in the defense of Earth against the attack fleet of Anubis at the climax of season seven (\\"Lost City\\"). After his efforts and recovery from his injuries, Jack O'Neill offered him any job he liked, and he wished to join SG-1. However, when he arrives at the base, he finds that SG-1 has been disbanded, a new general is in control, and he is set to pick and lead the new team. The new general is Hank Landry, a friend of both George Hammond and O'Neill. Under his order, Mitchell begins the selection process for new members of SG-1, but can't stomach any of the \\"terrible candidates\\". He wanted to work with the best, and he's determined to get SG-1 back together. Teal'c is off on the planet Dakara, which has been established as the capital of the newly founded Free Jaffa Nation, the aftermath of the fall of the Goa'uld Empire at the end of season eight. Samantha Carter has been moved to Area 51, where she is aiding in research and development. O'Neill has been promoted out of the SGC (hence the new general), and Daniel Jackson is set to take a ride on board the Daedalus, to Atlantis, the now-found City of the Ancients. An unscheduled off- world activation admits to the SGC a character not seen since season eight - Vala Mal Doran - claiming to have something they want. They let her in and she immediately seeks out her \\"friend\\" Daniel to pester. She's got a tablet written in Ancient that leads to a trove of hidden Ancient treasures, and she needs Daniel to translate it. However, as soon as they are close together, she throws a pair of cuffs onto both his and her wrists. These are kor mak bracelets (Teal'c explains, on his return), which link the two of them together such that they cannot be greatly separated without feeling pain and eventually death. Thus Vala ensures that Daniel does what she says. This, of course, causes Daniel to miss his trip on the Daedalus to Atlantis, meaning that he won't make his much-desired trip there. Meanwhile, however, he translates the tablet and who wrote it: an Ancient fleeing Atlantis after the war with the Wraith, named Myrddin, who Daniel says is Merlin, the wizard associated with King Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table. After further research, Daniel concludes that the treasure is located beneath Glastonbury Tor in England. Arriving at the place on the Prometheus, they ring inside a hidden cavern where a hologram of Merlin tells them that only the true will gain access to the treasures of the Ancients. There is a sword in a stone, but Mitchell is unable to remove it. They decide to explore further; Daniel and Vala take a right passageway, and Mitchell and Teal'c take a left. Both parties find rooms which light up upon entry. In both rooms, the parties encounter puzzles, and the doors lock shut automatically. Just when they think it can't get any worse, the ceiling begins to lower to crush them, and they must solve the puzzles in time before they are crushed. ===Part 2=== Trapped along with Teal'c and Vala Mal Doran far beneath England's Glastonbury Tor, Daniel Jackson and Cameron Mitchell have only seconds to outwit the Ancient snares in which they're caught. Once they succeed, they have to handle only one or two more small details – such as a near-impossible sword fight with an inhuman knight – before they win access to the cave's vast treasure. Amid the standard-issue gold and jewels, Daniel uncovers a horde of books apparently written by the Ancients. They tell a fantastic tale: The highly advanced Ancients may have once called themselves the Altera, and may have evolved in a far distant galaxy. The crew excavating the treasure also finds a piece of Ancient equipment, which Daniel believes is a communications device. Daniel persuades Mitchell and Hank Landry to let him test the machine. Within seconds, he and Vala – whose lives are still bound to one another by the Jaffa bracelets – drop to the ground, unconscious. Already developing a keen sense of how things work at Stargate Command, Mitchell deduces that this is a bad sign and puts the two under medical supervision. Similarly worried, Teal'c skips a critical meeting of the new Jaffa High Council to stay by his friend Daniel's side. Meanwhile, Daniel and Vala find themselves inhabiting the bodies of two married villagers on a distant planet. Being married to Vala – in even the remotest possible sense – gives Daniel the creeps, even before he learns that the villagers are devout worshippers of all-powerful and unforgiving beings called the Ori. What's worse, the two people whose bodies Daniel and Vala are inhabiting are suspected of heresy against these mysterious gods. Before long, Vala ends up chained to a sacrificial altar, about to be burned to death by the village's Administrator and his fanatical followers. Restrained by the vehement villagers, there's nothing Daniel can do but watch in horror as the flames are lit. Back on Earth, Mitchell and the others are watching, too, as Vala slips toward death. As Daniel holds Vala's charred body, a man in robes, holding an ornate staff, approaches the altar. The staff begins to glow, and Daniel watches in amazement as he brings Vala back to life. Daniel thanks him, but he responds, \\"Thank the Ori\\". He then tells them to follow him out of the square, and they follow. ==Production== \\"Avalon (Part 2)\\" is the first episode of the series to feature only two members of the original cast: Michael Shanks (Daniel Jackson) and Christopher Judge (Teal'c). Richard Dean Anderson had left the main cast after Season 8 due to the personal wish to spend more time with his young daughter in Los Angeles. Despite being listed in the cast credits, Amanda Tapping as Samantha Carter only appears once in a video conference, as she was in the last stages of pregnancy at that time and in one other scene. Her empty spot was filled by guest star Claudia Black. Ben Browder and Beau Bridges join the main cast in this episode, as Cameron Mitchell and Hank Landry, respectively. With \\"Avalon (Part 2)\\", Christopher Judge (Teal'c) passed Amanda Tapping in the number of episode appearances and is the cast member with the most appearances on Stargate SG-1. Tapping would later pass Judge in number of overall appearances when she joined the cast of Stargate Atlantis. \\"Avalon\\" marked the first Stargate SG-1 episode where SCI FI Channel chose to cut the opening sequences to 10-seconds for the original broadcast, rather than the usual 60-seconds (this was paralleled to Stargate Atlantis). The sequence only displayed the \\"Stargate SG-1\\" logo and a \\"Created by\\" credit, main cast credits were displayed during the teaser. Fans had been very negative about this move. On Sky One in both Ireland and the United Kingdom however, the short opening sequence was only used for Part 1 but not Part 2, where a full length title sequence was restored, incorporating new cast credits. The full length title sequence was also used again when \\"Avalon\\" aired in US Syndication. Matthew Walker guest-starred as the hologram of Merlin, and previously portrayed another Ancient named Moros in the Stargate Atlantis episode \\"Before I Sleep\\". In the Season Ten episode \\"The Pegasus Project\\", it is revealed that they are indeed the same person. Walker also played King Roham in the Season Two episode \\"Touchstone\\". ==Reception== Stephen Graves said in a TV Zone review that Mitchell's introduction in this two-part episode was entertaining enough to distract what was deemed \\"a little too reminiscent of the production team's own efforts to turn around the season eight finale\\". It perceived the renewed encounter between former Farscape cast members Ben Browder and Claudia Black to be \\"oddly ... underplayed\\", but generally embraces Black's \\"sparky, sarky characterization of Vala\\" during Amanda Tapping's absence. The review notes the strong similarities of the last ten minutes of \\"Avalon\\" (Part 1) to Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, and the set of the beginning of Part 2 as a \\"god-awful Merrie Olde England pastiche straight out of Monty Python and the Holy Grail. Plotting and technobabble were mentioned as other detrimental facets of Part 2. ==References== ==External links== * Avalon Part 1 and Part 2 at mgm.com * Avalon Part 1 and Part 2 at the Internet Movie Database * Avalon Part 1 and Part 2 at scifi.com * Screenplay Part 1 and Part 2 (PDF).

The name was selected by the Toronto East Downtown Residents Association (TEDRA) in recognition of Allan Gardens, an indoor botanical garden located nearby at the intersection of Carlton and Jarvis Streets. The Garden District was officially designated by the Mayor and Toronto City Council in 2001, while TEDRA has since been renamed the Garden District Residents Association. Part of the neighbourhood is within official City of Toronto neighbourhood of Moss Park. As defined by the Association, the neighbourhood is bordered by Carlton Street to the north, Yonge Street to the west, Sherbourne Street to the east and Queen Street to the south. This area includes the southern part of Toronto’s Gay Village and heritage sites such as the Mackenzie House Museum, Gallery Arcturus and the Merchandise Building. ==Character == This neighbourhood consists of two distinct areas: View of the western portion of the Garden District and Massey Hall, looking southeast from Shuter Street. The western portion, from Yonge Street to Jarvis Street, was first subdivided at the time Toronto was incorporated as a city in 1834 from the McGill Estate (the owner John McGill died that year).The Estates of Old Toronto, Liz Lundell, 1997. , Pg 51 This area quickly filled with overflow from central Toronto and includes a number of early, mostly non-government (especially religious) institutions such as the Metropolitan Methodist Church (Metropolitan United Church after church union in the 1920s), St Michael's Roman Catholic Cathedral, the Roman Catholic Bishop's Palace, St. Michael's Choir School and St Michael's Hospital, places of entertainment such as Massey Hall, the Elgin and Winter Garden Theatres, the Canon Theatre (formerly Pantages Theatre) and Maple Leaf Gardens as well as the Ryerson Model School (now a part of Ryerson University) Ryerson's campus today stretches from Gerrard in the north, east to Mutual and south of Gould, west to Yonge, and includes the Ryerson Image Centre, a photographic museum which is home to The Black Star Collection and the yearly Scotiabank Contact Photography Festival.

Pg 65 with north-south streets based on the street grid of the original Town of York. This area is largely residential with two parks (Moss Park and Allan Gardens) and a large number of local churches. It was originally a very exclusive district and declined in time as the housing stock aged and smaller lots for workers were built. This area has seen a large replacement of older homes with residential, institutional and commercial development. Located in the eastern portion of the Garden District, Walnut Hall were four Georgian styled terraced homes. On May 18, 2007, local uproar arose over its demolition. Constructed in 1856 and designated as a heritage site in 1997, the building was nonetheless neglected and began to collapse. The Garden District includes a mix of housing, from million-dollar condos, renovated Victorian villas, and Edwardian row houses to apartment co-operatives, subsidized housing units, and many hostels and shelters. George Street, one block east of Jarvis has a blighted area around the Seaton House shelter. The City of Toronto government is planning to redevelop the site incorporating heritage homes now boarded up. ==Demographics== Le Collège français is a French- language public secondary school located directly across the Garden District's northern boundary. It serves Franco-Ontarian residents in the District and other parts of the city. There is a substantial Francophone presence because of the area’s French-language institutions near the neighbourhood, including Paroisse Sacré Cœur, a Roman Catholic parish, Le Collège français, and École élémentaire Gabrielle-Roy. Le Collège français and École élémentaire Gabrielle-Roy are both operated by Conseil scolaire Viamonde, a secular public school board. A separate neighbourhood association, the McGill-Granby Village Resident's Association, represents the residents of the area around those two streets. There are several institutions related to the Aboriginal community along Gerrard Street, the south of Allan Gardens. They include Miziwe Biik Aboriginal Employment and Training, Anishnawbe Health Toronto, and Native Women's Resource Centre of Toronto. According to 2011 National Household Survey, the population with Aboriginal Ancestry of census tract 5350032.00 grew from 105 in 2005 to 165 in 2010. This large increase (+57%) is significant when the total population of CT5350032.00 decreased by almost 4%. ==Transportation== The area is well served by public transit, with the 505 Dundas, 506 Carlton east-west streetcar routes. The 75 Sherbourne bus runs north-south along Sherbourne. The Yonge-University-Spadina subway Line 1 runs north-south along Yonge Street to the west. ==References== ==External links== * City of Toronto - Moss Park demographic profile * Historic sketches and photos of the Garden District Category:Neighbourhoods in Toronto ","title":"Garden District, Toronto"},{"id":"2545798","text":"Isaac Sears (1 July 1730 – 28 October 1786) was an American merchant, sailor, Freemason, and political figure who played an important role in the American Revolution. He was born July 1, 1730 at West Brewster, Massachusetts, the son of Joshua and Mary Sears.Dictionary of American Biography He was a descendant of Richard Sears, who emigrated to the colonies from Colchester, England, in 1630. While he was a child, the family moved to Norwalk, Connecticut. At the age of sixteen, he was apprenticed to the skipper of a coastal vessel. By 1752, he was in command of a sloop trading between New York and Canada. Sears established his reputation as a privateer during the French and Indian War, commanding a vessel from 1758 until 1761, when he lost his ship. He moved to New York City and had become successful enough to become a merchant investing in ships engaging in trade with the West Indies.Ketchum, pg. 152 == Early life == Born in July 1730 in West Brewster, Barnstable Massachusetts Bay Colony, the son of Joshua and Mary (Thacher) Sears. Isaac Sears was the sixth of nine children. He was a fifth generation of New Englander whose family left Cape Cod and settled in Norwalk, Connecticut. He had well established Religious ties, as he also had ancestors who were a Deacon and a Minister in the Congregational Church. He was baptized in the church in 1730, moreover, he would go on to be a member of the Congregation in Harwich Mass. He would later go on to become an Anglican and marry Sarah Drake at Trinity Church in New York, and raised his family in Manhattan. His Father-in-law was Jasper Drake who owned the Water Street Tavern. As a young boy he sold shellfish, and by sixteen had begun apprenticing to the Captain of a New England coastal vessel. After ample time learning the trade, he was commissioned as an officer. By his twenties he commanded small sloops that sailed the North American coast between Halifax and New York. Some of these sloops would see him travel as far as the West Indies, even during the winter. By 1752, he was in command of a sloop trading between New York and Canada. During the Seven Years' War he became a Captain of privateers and commanded The Decoy a six gun sloop, The Catherine, and The Belle Isle which had fourteen guns. Sears established a reputation during the French and Indian War and became Captain of several privateers. He was commissioned to prey on enemy ships from 1758 until 1761, when he ultimately lost his ship. He moved to New York City and had become successful enough to become a merchant investing in ships engaging in trade with the West Indies. By 1763 he underwent a career change in which he moved on from captaining ships, to settle as a merchant. He started first in vessels but The Sugar Act of 1764 affected his trade along the North American coast, and West Indies and ultimately forced him to stop trade with Madeira. ==Sons of Liberty== Sears and his fellow Sons of Liberty all gathered at a coffee house on October 31, 1765, the day before the Stamp Act was to take effect. They ultimately resolved to enforce the opposition to the distribution of the stamps and formed an association to stop the importation of British goods until the act was rescinded. Sears organized and was a known leader of the Sons of Liberty in 1765. They used violence and threats of violence to prevent the use of stamps, moreover, Sears issued a death threat to anyone breaking the non-importation agreement before the colonies agreed to do so. He was nicknamed \\"King Sears\\" by aristocrats who feared his power to mobilize people in the streets and for his influential role in organizing and leading the New York mob.Isaac Sears - Britannica Online Encyclopedia He was a most militant and influential agitator and earned a reputation for bravery and sought to limit the scope of Britain's authority in 1760.Shecter, Barnet. The Battle for New York: The City at the Heart of the American Revolution. New York: Walker and Company, 2002. Another nickname that was bestowed upon him by British military engineer and cartographer John Montresor·, was the “Spawn of Liberty and Inquisition” which Montresor both passionately and derisively called him and his posse of vigilantes. British Vice Admiral Samuel Graves lists Sears as the “most active leaders and agitators of the rebellion. He was at the head of nearly every demonstration of mob violence in New York City. He partnered with James DeLancey in opposition to the stamps and supported him in his 1768 election to the New York assembly. Sears and many of his followers were engaged in trade and demanded that trade continue without stamps. In 1766, Sears, John Lamb and three others formed a committee of correspondence to communicate with other Sons of Liberty groups in other provinces. After the Stamp Act was repealed the Sons of Liberty erected a Liberty pole to celebrate. The liberty pole was a galling sight to the redcoats and a symbol of pride and defiance to the townsfolk. When the British cut down the pole for the first time, Sears and Walter Quackenbos collared two redcoats posting broadsides, a fellow soldier drew his bayonet and threatened them, Sears had a rams horn in his hand and threw it at him and hit him in the head. In 1768, he and numerous New York merchants sent a petition to Parliament outlining their grievances on the state of trade. In 1769, when the New York assembly passed an appropriation for funding of the Quartering Act, he posted an inflammatory broadside entitled \\"To the betrayed inhabitants of the city and colony of New York\\". On January 19, 1770 the Battle of Golden Hill began when Sears took it upon himself to prevent a half dozen redcoats from posting broadsides at an outdoor market near the East River wharves, Sears seized the soldier fixing the paper by the collar and asked him what business he had to put up Libels against the inhabitants and carried him to the mayor. The fifth liberty pole was raised on February 6, 1770 on a plot of land owned by Sears. When the Tea Act was passed in 1773, he organized the city's captains into refusing to freight the East Indian tea. It was the first organized opposition to the tax. Broadsides, signed \\"The Mohawks\\", were posted warning against anyone trying to land tea. New York's opposition was partly responsible for Boston's decision to stop the landing of tea. Adams wrote, \\"we must venture, and unless we do, we shall be discarded by the sons of liberty in the other colonies\\".Ketchum, pg. 243 They were successful in preventing the landing of tea. In April 1774, they boarded the Nancy and destroyed its tea. During the Townsend Acts, Britain passed a Tea Act in 1773 to ship tea directly to North America to help the East India Company, saving it from being taxed so it can come out of bankruptcy. Sears and his companions believed that the ruin of their commerce was inevitable if they did not succeed in preventing the sale of India Company tea in America. They were convinced that this could only be effected by total prohibition of English tea, since the Company would find ways of importing its tea to America by way of private merchants regardless.Christen, pg. 298 He was also worried Britain would soon try to make a monopoly of other goods in the colonies, threatening the welfare of the Sons of Neptune. Before the tea was to be sent to the colonies, Captain Sears and McDougall decided an opposition was needed and sought to unite all the Sons of Neptune and Liberty with the merchants and tea-smugglers. The Sons of Liberty and the Dutch smugglers had come together and sparked the \\"New Flame\\" described by William Smith. As the tea approached the harbors of New York, Philadelphia, and Boston in early November the campaign began. The tea stood in the boats that were in the harbor and no one dared to remove them for fear of the tea being destroyed. Towards the end of November, McDougall from Sons of Liberty made a publication to be sent out to all harbors. \\"If any of the tea by any persons associated with the India Tea Company had accepted a commission to sell, land, or store the tea would be paid \\"an unwelcomed visit, in which they shall be treated as they deserve: by 'The Mohawks.'\\" Thus Sears and McDougall initiated the use of this distinctively American name to cover the identity of those who were ready to employ violence to block the operation of the Tea Act.\\"Christen, pg 282 Not long after, the Boston Tea Party took place and the tea ships in Philadelphia and New York turned back to England for fear of their cargo. When in May 1774 news of the Boston Port Act arrived, Sears and McDougall wrote a letter of support to Boston, without consulting anyone else, in addition to a British boycott, they proposed a ban on exports to the West Indies and called for a Continental Congress. Reaction in New York to the Boston Port Act was cautious and equivocal, there was a split with the DeLanceys on whether to proceed with nonimportantion. ==Committee of Sixty== On May 16, 1774 a meeting at the Fraunces Tavern was called of the various factions. The Committee of Fifty was elected with Isaac Low as its chairman. James DeLancey's faction was in the majority, with Sears and his Sons of Liberty in the minority. In 1774, he was a leading member of New York City's Committee of Sixty. In a letter to the Boston Committee of Correspondence he proposed a meeting of delegates from the principal towns. This proposal was initially disavowed by the Committee of Sixty, but later was ratified in a proposal for the meeting of the First Continental Congress. ==American Revolution== On April 15, 1775 he was arrested for his anti-British activities, but was rescued at the prison door by his supporters and paraded through the streets as a hero. When news of the Battle of Lexington arrived he and his followers seized the arsenal at the Custom House. He was the de facto commander of New York City until Washington's Army arrived in June, 1776. On November 20, 1775, Sears led a group of 80 citizens in apprehending Parson Seabury, Judge Fowler, and Lord Underhill.Moore, Frank. [1860] (2001). Diary of the American Revolution Vol. I.: 122-123 Edited by Jay Carper. Internet: Third Millennium Publishing. At some point the mob forced Fowler to write (or else they forged his name) an apology and a promise not to interfere with the Second Continental Congress. While some of the mob escorted the three prisoners to Connecticut, ·November 23, 1775 Sears and his men rode into New York at high noon with bayonets fixed and shut down James Rivington's Gazetteer by taking all of the type from his office at the foot of Wall Street where a large crowd gathered outside the Merchants coffee shop to cheer the raiders as they marched out of town to the tune of Yankee Doodle . However, this action was condemned by the Committee of Sixty, the New York Provincial Congress and the New York delegation to the Continental Congress, but public opinion was with him and no action and after the capture of New York, Sears returned to Massachusetts, where he grew rich by privateering and spending time at sea as a privateer from Boston from 1777 to 1783. He formed partnerships with other privateers, such as John Kendrick, with whom he owned in partnership the vessel Count d'Estaing, commanded by Kendrick. ==Post-war years== After the British left New York City in 1783, he returned to the city installing himself in a mansion on the Bowling Green and reviving the Sons of Liberty. By March, he was calling for the expulsion of any remaining Loyalists in the state by May 1. He and other members of the Sons of Liberty won enough seats in the New York State Assembly in December, 1784 to enact a set of harsh anti-Loyalist laws. He was exposed for buying up soldier's pay certificates at depressed prices and using them to speculate in forfeited Loyalist property. The public regarded this as the height of venality and cynicism. He was again elected to the assembly in 1786, but by then he was deeply in debt and he left the state to avoid arrest.Schecter, pg. 385 Sears died in October 1786 of fever and dysentery contracted in Batavia in the Dutch East Indies while on a great adventure to open American trade with China, where he would be buried on an island in Canton Harbor. ==Footnotes== ==References== * Isaac Sears.Dictionary of American Biography Base Set.

Spitfires shortly before World War II. This is a list of military engagements of World War II encompassing land, naval, and air engagements as well as campaigns, operations, defensive lines and sieges. Campaigns generally refer to broader strategic operations conducted over a large bit of territory and over a long period. Battles generally refer to short periods of intense combat localised to a specific area and over a specific period. However, use of the terms in naming such events is not consistent. For example, the Battle of the Atlantic was more or less an entire theatre of war, and the so-called battle lasted for the duration of the entire war. Another misnomer is the Battle of Britain, which by all rights should be considered a campaign, not a mere battle. == Battles == ===1939=== { style=\\"background:transparent; font-size:95%;\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" - valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"190px\\" • Invasion of Poland :: :: Battle of the Bzura :: Battle of Mława :: Battle of Tomaszów Lubelski :: Battle of Kock :: Siege of Warsaw  Poland invaded by Nazi Germany. : : : : : : -  • Soviet invasion of Poland :: Battle of Lwów :: Battle of Wilno :: Battle of Grodno :: Battle of Szack :: Battle of Wytyczno  Poland invaded by Soviet Union. : : : : : -  • Slovak invasion of Poland  Poland invaded by Slovakia -  • Saar Offensive  French attack on Saarland. - valign=\\"top\\"  • Winter War :: Battle of Tolvajärvi :: Battle of Suomussalmi  Finland invaded by the Soviet Union and, initially, resists successfully.  : : -  • First Battle of Changsha  First Japanese attempt to take Changsha in China during the Second Sino-Japanese War. -  • 1939–40 Winter Offensive  First large-scale Chinese counter-offensive operation. -  • Battle of the River Plate  The Admiral Graf Spee chased into Montevideo harbour and later scuttled. } ===1940=== { style=\\"background:transparent; font-size:95%;\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" - width=\\"190px\\" • Battle of the Atlantic  Name given to the conflicts in the Atlantic Ocean between 1940 and 1945. - valign=\\"top\\"  • Winter War :: Battle of Kollaa :: Battle of Honkaniemi  : : The only tank battle during the Winter War. -  • German invasion of Denmark -  • Battle of Drøbak Sound  Took place on the first day of the German invasion of Norway. -  • Battles of Narvik  Minor Allied victory in Norway. -  • Battle of Namsos  Failed Allied attempt to halt the Germans in Norway. -  • Invasion of Iceland -  • Battle of the Netherlands  Germany defeats the Dutch in Europe during the opening stages of the first operation of the Battle of France, \\"Case Yellow\\" (Fall Gelb). -  • Battle of Belgium  Germany defeats Belgium during the continuation of Fall Gelb. -  • Battle of France :: Battle of Dunkirk :: Battle of Arras :: Battle of Boulogne -  • Attack on Mers-el-Kébir  Operation \\"Catapult\\".

The episode earned a 2.4 Nielsen rating, a new record high for the show during its run on cable, which has since been tied, but never beaten. It also became the most-watched regular series episode ever for the Sci Fi Channel and the highest rated episode in the history of Stargate SG-1, drawing 3.22 million viewers. Part 2 was nominated for a Gemini Award in the category \\"Best Visual Effects\\".) ==Plot== ===Part 1=== At Stargate Command Dr. Jackson packs for Antarctica but Dr. Weir tells him that talks over the use of the outpost have stalled again. Meanwhile, Major Carter proposes using the modified Tel'tak to get to Othala to contact the Asgard, who could help Col. O'Neill. Weir denies the request on the grounds that the modified hyperdrive was too valuable to risk losing and because there was a chance engines could burn out on the flight. However, she relents when Carter implies that she would refuse to contribute to the study of the ship. Once Carter and Teal'c are under way, Earth receives a message from Camulus, a Goa'uld System Lord, who wants to arrange a meeting between Earth and the System Lords. Weir is authorized by the President to begin negotiations. Meanwhile, Carter and Teal'c reach Halla but find that the Halla sun has become a black hole and are rescued from its gravitational pull by Thor. He informs them that the Asgard collapsed the sun to create a black hole to permanently destroy the Replicators on Halla. The replicators nonetheless escape, and fire a projectile composed of replicator blocks at the ship, infesting it. Carter and Teal'c attempt to destroy the replicators, and Carter is beamed away by the replicator ship. On Earth the Goa'uld representatives, Camulus, Amaterasu, Yu, and Yu's First Prime Oshu arrive. To avoid open war, the System Lords agreed to divide Anubis's territories and armies equally, but Ba'al had taken control of the Kull warriors and begun conquering the other System Lords. Ba'al believes, correctly, that the Asgard can no longer exercise power in the Milky Way galaxy, and plans to attack the worlds protected by the Protected Planets Treaty. The Goa'uld seek to use the Ancient weapon against Baal. They offer hyperdrive engines, but Weir counters that if Earth defeats Ba'al, they should inherit all that is his. In the Asgard galaxy Thor follows the Replicators, which head towards Orilla, the new Asgard homeworld. Orilla is rich with neutronium, which would allow the construction of many Human-form Replicators. On the Replicator ship, Carter is confronted by Fifth, who is angry at her betrayal of him. He tortures her for some time, but eventually relents. Thor closes in on the replicator ship with the intention of using a self-destruct to destroy both vessels, but his ship abruptly loses power due to a replicator co-opting its systems. Teal'c destroys it, but the opportunity is lost, and Thor sends a warning to his people. On Earth Daniel decodes a message between the Systems Lords and deactivates the Stargate before they can leave, having learned that a ship has been dispatched to attack Earth, and Weir orders them taken prisoner. ===Part 2=== Penegal of the Asgard Council informs Thor that although the Replicator ship has been destroyed, a number of blocks made it to the planet's surface. They infest the technology used to save the minds and cloned bodies of the Asgard, which makes them unwilling to abandon Orilla. Thor travels to Earth. At SGC, Daniel informs the System Lords that their ship was destroyed by Ba'al. Suddenly, he is beamed aboard Thor's ship, the Daniel Jackson. Thor then beams O'Neill into a stasis pod, hoping to harness the Ancient knowledge in his mind to devise a means of defeating the replicators. Meanwhile, Carter wakes up in bed in a Montana farmhouse. Pete Shanahan greets her and maintains that what she is experiencing is reality, but Carter does not believe and it is revealed to be Fifth. Thor interfaces O'Neill's mind with his ship's computer and O'Neill creates a schematic for an unknown device. With O'Neill close to death, Thor erases the Ancient knowledge from his mind and revives him. After awakening, his memories of what has transpired since having the repository downloaded into his mind are clouded. Thor synthesizes the device which O'Neill designed, but even he does not know its function. Penegal contacts them to inform them that the Replicators on Orilla seem to be controlled by a human-form Replicator. This gives SG-1 hope that Sam may have survived, however the Asgard are unable to locate her life signs. During transmission, contact with Orilla is lost. At SGC, Oshu asks Weir to let them go to fight against Ba'al. Weir eventually agrees, but Camulus requests asylum, saying his forces had fallen. While Thor examines the Ancient device, he is contacted by Aegir, commander of the Valhalla, who tells him that they found the remains of a human-form Replicator in space. Thor beams him aboard, and begins to access the Replicator communication network. They are able to locate Carter, but the human-form Replicator wakes up and attacks. The human weapons are useless, but O'Neill then uses the Ancient device, the Replicator Disruptor, causing the replicator to disassociate into its constituent components. After observing its function, Thor begins development of a large-scale version of the weapon to destroy all Replicators on Orilla. In the meantime, SG-1 beams down on the planet to rescue Carter; they engage the replicators until Fifth appears and threatens to kill Carter. O'Neill is then contacted by Thor but suddenly all the Replicators start to move in one direction. They converge on a ship composed of Replicator blocks, which jumps to hyperspace. Thor deploys the weapon, destroying the remaining replicators. Afterward, SG-1 finds Carter. Later, O'Neill visits Weir who tells him that she will supervise the Ancient outpost. She also tell him that General Hammond will be promoted and made the new director of the new unofficial \\"Department of Homeworld Security\\", and the new commander of SGC will be Brigadier General Jack O'Neill. A large gathering is held in the gate room during which Weir says goodbye and presents Stargate Command with their commanding officer. As his first act as C.O., O'Neill promotes Major Samantha Carter to the rank of lieutenant colonel. On the Replicator ship Fifth greets a newly created human- form replicator, which is patterned after Carter. ==Production== * Michael Shanks plays three different characters in this episode: Dr. Daniel Jackson, Thor, and Penegal. * Torri Higginson replaced Jessica Steen as Dr. Weir beginning with this episode, and continuing into the spinoff series Stargate Atlantis. * Steve Bacic previously played Major Coburn, an SG Team leader, in \\"Maternal Instinct\\" and \\"The First Ones\\", and is known for playing Gaheris Rhade and Telemachus Rhade, his descendant, on Andromeda. * This episode marks the first appearance of Colonel Lionel Pendergast (Barclay Hope). ==Reception== The episode earned a 2.4 Nielsen rating, a new record high for the show during its run on cable, which has since been tied, but never beaten.

In particular, the law of the excluded middle does not hold in general, though the induction axiom can be used to prove many specific cases. For instance, one can prove that is a theorem (any two natural numbers are either equal to each other, or not equal to each other). In fact, since \\"=\\" is the only predicate symbol in Heyting arithmetic, it then follows that, for any quantifier-free formula p, is a theorem (where x, y, z… are the free variables in p). ==History== Kurt Gödel studied the relationship between Heyting arithmetic and Peano arithmetic. He used the Gödel–Gentzen negative translation to prove in 1933 that if HA is consistent, then PA is also consistent. ==Related concepts== Heyting arithmetic should not be confused with Heyting algebras, which are the intuitionistic analogue of Boolean algebras. ==See also== *Harrop formula *BHK interpretation *Realizability ==References== *Ulrich Kohlenbach (2008), Applied proof theory, Springer. *Anne S.

Davis was nominated for a Leo Award in the category \\"Dramatic Series: Best Supporting Performance - Male\\" for this episode. ==Plot== ===Part 1=== The President of the United States, nearing the end of his time in office, has grown concerned over how the public will react if the Stargate Program becomes public knowledge after he leaves office. Hoping that he will be able to put a positive spin on his association with the program, he has commissioned a reporter to create a documentary on the people within the SGC and their activities. However, few key SGC members demonstrate willingness to participate in the documentary, and the reporter seems to irritate the members of SG-1 and occasionally rants about censorship. (While he has been given complete access to all past mission reports, current activities of the SGC are off-limits since the Pentagon has yet to review and certify them safe for public viewing.) While Sam Carter and Daniel Jackson do participate in the interviews (unlike Teal'c, who simply stares silently at the camera, and Jack O'Neill, who goes to great pains to avoid the reporter completely), it is only Janet Fraiser who seems willing to tolerate the reporter's presence (and later jokes with him about his rather clumsy attempts to flirt with her). Meanwhile, SG-13 is exploring the planet P3X-666, and a Goa'uld probe (possibly inspired by the MALP) discovers the exploration team and opens fire. After a brief firefight, it is successfully disabled. Deeming the world to be safe, at least for the immediate future, the SGC allows SG-13 to continue to study the ruins they had found. Undiscovered by the SGC, the probe had dispatched a sub-space signal before it was destroyed, and a Goa'uld strike force appears soon afterwards to engage the explorers. With one team member wounded by a Jaffa staff blast and unable to move, the SGC is forced to send three SG teams as reinforcement to hold off the Jaffa until Dr. Fraiser can stabilise the wounded airman. ===Part 2=== SG-1 and other teams enter the combat and provide cover for Dr. Fraiser and the wounded airman. Shockingly, while providing cover for the wounded soldier, Colonel O'Neill takes a Jaffa staff blast to the torso and falls to the ground amid continued violence. The embattled SG teams return to Earth and, while the camera crews are forced out of the Gateroom due to the 'No current activity' prohibition, an unidentified individual stretched lifeless on a gurney is visible and gives concern to the reporter. Soon afterwards, reports that there was a KIA (i.e. a casualty) during the mission begin to filter through the SGC and piques the interest of the reporter. In addition, the formerly unknown NID agent Woolsey conducts an investigation into the SGC, with many of General Hammond's, Dr. Jackson's, and Major Carter's operational decisions questioned. During this, the reporter continues to try to determine exactly what happened, who was on that stretcher, and whether rumors of Colonel O'Neill's death are accurate. Bregman, the reporter, starts asking questions about who was shot and how. He makes a strong stand about the importance of the media in battle scenes, especially in a top secret program which is to be made public sooner or later anyway. He tells a poignant story highlighting the deep morality of documenting the sacrifice and loss associated with war. After continued pressure, Dr. Jackson allows the reporter to view the tape that he had made of the mission. Viewing the tape, we see Dr. Fraiser tending to the wounded airman and, almost immediately after stabilising him for travel, taking a fatal staff blast to her torso. Jack survived his own impact, and the wounded soldier was saved due to Dr. Fraiser's actions. Bregman's story, and his final documentary finally convince Hammond and Daniel that he's right. Towards the end of the episode a memorial service for Dr. Janet Fraiser is held, with Major Carter reading the names of those who, instead of having given their lives for their country, were still alive and serving due to the doctor's excellent care. Dr. Jackson's later visit to family of the saved wounded airman, revealed his newly born baby daughter named Janet, after Dr. Fraiser. The show ends with Colonel O'Neill finally agreeing to an interview. ==Production== Part 2 of the episode was the 150th episode of Stargate SG-1 to be aired.

The episode was written by producer Robert C. Cooper, and directed by Martin Wood. \\"Redemption\\" is the first episode where actor Corin Nemec had main cast status, his character Jonas Quinn replacing Daniel Jackson (played by Michael Shanks) who died at the end of season 5. The episode also marks the second appearance of David Hewlett's character Rodney McKay, who later became a main character on Stargate Atlantis. \\"Redemption Part 2\\" was nominated for a Gemini Award in the category \\"Best Visual Effects\\".\\"Stargate SG-1\\" (1997) - Awards ==Part 1== Major Carter invites Jonas Quinn, who left his home planet and has been living at Stargate Command (SGC) since Daniel Jackson's death (\\"Meridian\\"), to leave the base with SG-1. At Area 51, they see the newly built fighter jet X-302 for the first time, but O'Neill refuses to test-fly it (because of the X-301 incident in season 4's \\"Tangent\\"). Back at the SGC, O'Neill denies the proposal of General Hammond and Col. Chekov, who wants a Russian as the new fourth member of SG-1. Jonas admits to Carter that he wants to be a member of SG-1, and talks with Teal'c about O'Neill's mistrust in him. When Teal'c talks with his Colonel, O'Neill claims that Jonas is an alien. Bra'tac arrives at the SGC and informs Teal'c that Drey'auc (Teal'c wife) is ill. By the time they have reached Chulak, Drey'auc has died. Teal'c's teenage son Rya'c wants to take revenge on Teal'c and starts to beat him down, but Bra'tac intervenes. Teal'c talks with Rya'c during Drey'auc burial, and Ry'ac starts to cry. Meanwhile, at Earth, the SGC Stargate was dialed from off-world and has stayed open beyond its 38-minute limit, with energy of the gate rapidly rising. Carter presumes that the gate will eventually explode and potentially cause the destruction of Earth. Dr. Rodney McKay arrives at the SGC as ordered much to Carter's annoyance. Carter informs Col. Chekov that the X-302 will soon be ready so that Earth can contact the Asgard for help. As O'Neill and Carter start with X-302, Jonas and McKay inform Hammond of potential problems with the X-302's hyperspace engine due to the instability of the naqahdriah. Shortly before the X-302 enters hyperspace, they miss the window and the mission is cancelled. Back on Chulak, a Jaffa arrives with a Tel'tak and reveals that Anubis is going to attack Earth's Stargate. Through trial and error of dialing planets that belong to Anubis, they finally find out which world the weapon is on. Back at SGC, Carter can only assume what caused the problem. A hologram of Anubis appears in the gateroom, saying in a very dramatic way that they will all be destroyed soon, much to O'Neill's annoyance. ==Part 2== Dr. McKay talks with Major Carter about the situation, when McKay has the idea of using an EMP. General Hammond allows him to proceed, despite Carter's protest. She also presents the problems with that plan, but Hammond orders her to work with McKay. The plan is finally carried out, but it doesn't work. Suddenly lightning strikes from the machine. When Carter closes the iris, she is struck down. On the Jaffa world, they find out where Anubis has positioned the weapon and together with Rya'c they use a Tel'tak to go there. The planet is guarded by Ha'taks, who detect the cloaked cargo ship and thus Teal'c, Bra'tac and Rya'c ring down to the planet, where they attack the Jaffa. During the battle however Rya'c is wounded. They then hide because there are many guards and patrolling Death gliders. The three Jaffa then find the weapon (which is of Ancient origin) and while Rya'c has to stay hidden the two adults go to the weapon. However the weapon is protected by a force field. At SGC, Carter's wounds are treated in the infirmary and she is visited by McKay who apologizes to her and tells her about his past. It is also revealed that the time until the explosion is cut in half, as Carter had predicted. Later Carter visits Jonas who looks at the Stargate and asks her how they got the Stargate in the gate room. This gives Carter an idea. She tells the scientists there to use the X-302 to fling the Stargate into space, and all of them start working. Hammond later talks with Colonel Chekov about the use of their Stargate, but the Russians demand a lot in return. On Anubis' planet, Teal'c and Bra'tac are caught by Jaffa and questioned but they keep silent. They then ask for Rya'c, which makes Teal'c angry. Rya'c later overhears what will happen with Teal'c and Bra'tac. He then goes to a place with ships and steals a Death glider. Afterwards, he attacks the Jaffa guarding Teal'c and Bra'tac, who then free themselves. He then attacks the weapon, and despite being hit by another glider, he destroys the weapon. Back on Earth, Jonas suggests using the hyperspace engine, but they don't know what will happen if they are used inside the atmosphere. They nevertheless plan to do it and only open a hyperspace window for about one second, long enough to transport the X-302 far enough away from the Earth that the stargate's explosion is harmless. They carry out the plan successfully and O'Neill also ejects in time, much to the joy of the others. Later, McKay leaves and says goodbye to Carter while O'Neill talks with Hammond. They are then contacted by Teal'c, who informs them that the weapon was destroyed. Later, the gate from the Russians is installed and, although they want a Russian member at SG-1, O'Neill decides to take Jonas in, who then leaves with the team on his first mission. ==Production== * This episode features a brand new opening sequence, with various shots of the gate spinning, and Michael Shanks' name being removed to make way for Corin Nemec's in between Christopher Judge and Don S. Davis. * There was an intentional goof in the 18th minute of the episode: a monitor displayed the time that the wormhole had been active, but its reflection was not reflected mirror-inverted in the briefing room window, but displayed forwardly. This was done on purpose so that the viewer would have a concept of the time running out even when the timer wasn't in shot. * \\"Redemption\\" was not originally a two-parter, but Robert C. Cooper noticed during writing that while the script was already too long, there was still a huge hole in the story. He always wanted to do more with Teal'c and Rya'c but never had the story to fit those scenes into. * \\"Redemption\\" introduced the X-302, the first human-built fighter plane retro-engineered from Goa'uld technology. Andy Mikita came up with the idea to put the X-302 prop on a flatbed truck and drive it out of the hangar so that in the shot it looks like it taxies itself out. After Brad Wright and Robert C. Cooper, who have a passion for fighter jets, had flown in two T38 Airforce jets, Wright intended to write an episode with T38s in it, and bring the pilots from the US to Vancouver, Canada, where SG-1 was filmed. The T38s were put in the background of all shots. * There was a lot of night-shooting in \\"Redemption\\". * The scenes with O'Neill and Carter in masks in the X-302 were dubbed after filming. ===Introduction of Jonas Quinn=== At the end of season 5, Michael Shanks (Daniel Jackson) decided to leave Stargate SG-1 for concerns over being under-utilized. Some casting people from the SciFi Channel, who were looking to fill the void with a new character, happened to walk through the courtyard of MGM's Santa Monica offices where Corin Nemec was that day. They briefly mentioned Stargate to him, and the same afternoon Nemec's manager called Nemec to tell him they were interested in him. Since Nemec had never watched Stargate SG-1 up until that time (he was familiar with the Stargate film though), he was sent some videotapes of the show and had some more meetings until he was finally cast as Jonas Quinn for the penultimate season 5 episode \\"Meridian\\". Everyone agreed to wait and see how the character looked on film before deciding on long-term involvements, but MGM liked what they saw. Although \\"there's been quite a bit of ire directed by fans towards Daniel's replacement\\" after the airing of \\"Meridian\\", Robert C. Cooper hoped that they would like the character in the end. \\"Redemption\\" is meant to establish that the new character can contribute ideas and be a team player. Writer Robert C. Cooper also felt it was important to acknowledge and not \\"trivialize what the [Daniel Jackson] character meant to the team and to the show for five seasons\\". The producers based Jonas's motivation to join SG-1 on his former reluctance to shut off the machine that would indirectly kill Daniel, and his feelings of responsibility of Daniel's death. According to producer Joseph Mallozzi before the airing of season 6, \\"Jonas will bring a unique alien perspective and ability to the team. In particular, this 'ability' will allow him to contribute in areas of expertise usually owned by Sam and Daniel. ... Jonas will take a heat off Sam in particular, allowing her to open up a little more.\\", https://web.archive.org/web/20030104055657/http://www.sjhw.net/death/chat041302.html Producer Brad Wright said that \\"What Corin, as Jonas, will bring to the show is a renewed sense of amazement at the fact that we're crossing the galaxy in a single step [through a stargate]. It's still a profound and amazing thing that's happening, no matter how accustomed our characters are to it.\\"http://tv.zap2it.com/tveditorial/tve_main/1,1002,274740881,00.html Carter is the one of the three SG-1 members Jonas Quinn feels most comfortable around, and Jonas hopes that she and Teal'c can persuade O'Neill to give him a chance to prove himself worthy of a place on the team. However, according to Richard Dean Anderson, \\"O'Neill feels that Jonas is directly responsible for the demise or at least the damaging of Daniel Jackson. [...] As a result, he harbours some resentment towards Jonas. [At the end of \\"Redemption\\",] O'Neill has finally come to the point of accepting Jonas but not entirely. [...] O'Neill is suspicious of aliens in general. The only exception is Teal'c [...] and O'Neill refuses to or isn't able to forget that Jonas is an alien.\\" According to Amanda Tapping, \\"there is a hesitancy on [Carter]'s part to be too familiar with Jonas. [...] She is not to make this big emotional investment in Jonas because he's not Daniel. [...] In some ways, Jonas has inadvertently brought the three [remaining SG-1 members] closer together.\\" Corin Nemec thought that \\"the writers hit the nail on the head in starting the season off\\" with a prolonged transition stage, and Jonas's \\"easy-going nature\\" later \\"help[s] him establish relationships not only with his fellow teammates but also Dr Fraiser and General Hammond, who according to Nemec is \\"very much a father figure in Jonas's eyes\\". However, Anderson was convinced that \\"O'Neill is [nevertheless not] going to warm up to Jonas very much at all\\", something which Nemec felt \\"makes things much more interesting\\". ==Reception== Corin Nemec came on board amid controversy.https://web.archive.org/web/20020803120253/http://www.charlotte.com/mld/charlotte/news/local/3418043.htm At the beginning of season 6, producer Joseph Mallozzi admitted to still getting the \\"odd incoherent rambling death threat passed along to me from the [Save Daniel Jackson] site.\\" \\"Redemption Part 2\\" was nominated for a Gemini Award in the category \\"Best Visual Effects\\". ==References== ==External links== * Redemption Part 1 and Part 2 at mgm.com * Redemption Part 1 and Part 2 at the Internet Movie Database Category:Stargate SG-1 episodes Category:2002 American television episodes ","title":"Redemption (Stargate SG-1)"},{"id":"2545824","text":"In photometry, luminous energy is the perceived energy of light.

In this episode, offender profiler Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) investigates the initial outbreak of a deadly virus, and discovers that his employers, the Millennium Group may pose a danger to his safety. \\"The Fourth Horseman\\" was written under the belief that the series would soon be cancelled, and inspired in part by the outbreak of bovine spongiform encephalopathy in the United Kingdom. The episode has earned positive responses from critics, and was seen by approximately 4.61 million households during its initial broadcast. ==Plot== On a farm in Baraboo, Wisconsin in 1986, a farmer finds his entire warehouse of chickens dead, the floor soaked in blood. He attempts to run, but collapses dead, bleeding profusely and covered in dark lesions. Twelve years later, Millennium Group member Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) is visited by a retired Federal Bureau of Investigation agent, Richard Gilbert (Glenn Morshower). Gilbert hopes to headhunt Black for his new private security firm, The Trust. Their meeting abruptly ends when Black receives word that his father has died. At the funeral, Black explains the notion of death to his young daughter; later that day, he unsuccessfully tries to contact fellow Group member Lara Means (Kristen Cloke), with whom he has lost contact. Black meets with another Group member, Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn) to investigate the death of a man found surrounded by six pints of spilt blood, with no evidence of murder. A coroner determines that the man drowned when his lungs filled with his own blood, surmising the cause to be a viral infection. Everyone who came into contact with the corpse is isolated in quarantine, waiting to be tested for exposure to any pathogen. While quarantined, Black accuses Watts and the Millennium Group of knowing more about the virus than is apparent. Watts simply responds by quoting the Bible's Book of Revelation. The pair are examined by mysterious doctors in protective suits; shortly afterwards, they are cleared to leave quarantine. Black contacts Gilbert and expresses his wish to leave the Millennium Group and join The Trust—however, he first wishes to \\"rescue\\" his friends within the Group. Elsewhere, a family sit down to dinner together, before spontaneously collapsing and bleeding profusely; further victims of the virus. At home, Black learns that his daughter has been having vivid nightmares about the end of the world, in which she and her parents are isolated in a woodland cabin. Black admits to his wife that he has come to accept the Group as a cult, and wishes to leave. He arranges to see a doctor, wishing to be tested but wanting the results to remain secret. Gilbert surveils Watts, finding that the latter has been in contact with Means. Black travels to where Means is living, where he remotely observes a cult-like ceremony in which Means is ritually inducted into the Group. He contacts Watts, divulging the results of his tests—they were injected with a vaccine while quarantined. Black warns Watts that the Group is dangerous; Watts neither confirms nor denies this, but predicts the arrival of an earthquake, urging Black that should this prediction come to pass, he should accept full membership of the Group. That night, Black answers a telephone call from Means, who tells him that the Group mean no harm. The line suddenly cuts, and the tremors of an earthquake begin just as Watts had predicted. Black moves through his home, noticing that his pet bird is dead in its cage, covered in blood. ==Production== \\"The Fourth Horseman\\" was written by frequent collaborators Glen Morgan and James Wong. The duo would pen a total of fifteen episodes throughout the series' run. The pair had also taken the roles of co- executive producers for the season. The episode was the second of three to be directed by Dwight Little, who had previously helmed \\"Midnight of the Century\\", and would return in the third season for \\"Borrowed Time\\". Written simultaneously with the concluding episode, \\"The Time Is Now\\", the episode's script went through several different versions before a final plot was decided upon, as Morgan and Wong believed the series would not be renewed for a third season and wished to write a suitable ending. The idea of depicting an apocalyptic scenario as being the result of a virus came from Morgan's research into possible end-of-the-world scenarios, and was influenced by the outbreak of bovine spongiform encephalopathy in the United Kingdom. The build- up to, and depiction of, the viral outbreak was seen by the writing staff as conclusive proof that the series would be cancelled, leading to several writers beginning to look for work on other projects while still officially under contract to work on Millennium. Actress Brittany Tiplady, who portrays Black's young daughter Jordan, has cited \\"The Fourth Horseman\\" as one of the episodes which she considered to have caused her to grow as an actress. Tiplady described her role in the episode as not being \\"just the cute Jordan Black with easy scenes and lots of giggling\\", and added that the increased depth her character was given served to heighten her interest in acting. ==Broadcast and reception== \\"The Fourth Horseman\\" was first broadcast on the Fox network on May 8, 1998. The episode earned a Nielsen rating of 4.7 during its original broadcast, meaning that of households in the United States viewed the episode. This represented approximately households, and left the episode the eighty-fifth most-viewed broadcast that week. \\"The Time Is Now\\" received positive reviews from critics. The A.V. Club Emily VanDerWerff rated the episode an \\"A\\". VanDerWerff felt that the two-part finale was \\"at once haunting and terrifying\\", finding both \\"The Fourth Horseman\\" and \\"The Time Is Now\\" to be Millennium most frightening instalments. VanDerWerff noted that the episode's plotting and symbolism were not always subtle, but felt that this directness suited the series' tone. Bill Gibron, writing for DVD Talk, rated the episode 5 out of 5. Gibron felt that both Cloke and O'Quinn gave particularly strong performances in both this episode and its follow-up. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated \\"The Fourth Horseman\\" five stars out of five. ==Notes== ==Footnotes== ===References=== * * ==External links== * * Category:1998 American television episodes Category:Millennium (season 2) episodes Category:Fiction set in 1986 ","title":"The Fourth Horseman (Millennium)"},{"id":"2545833","text":":For Amtor, the fictionalized version of Planet Venus from the Venus series by Edgar Rice Burroughs, see Amtor. AMTOR (Amateur Teleprinting Over Radio) is a type of telecommunications system that consists of two or more electromechanical teleprinters in different locations that send and receive messages to one another. AMTOR is a specialized form of RTTY protocol. The term is an acronym for Amateur Teleprinting Over Radio and is derived from ITU-R recommendation 476-1 and is known commercially as SITOR (Simplex Telex Over radio) developed primarily for maritime use in the 1970s. AMTOR was developed in 1978 by Peter Martinez, G3PLX, with the first contact taking place in September 1978 with G3YYD on the 2m Amateur band. It was developed on homemade Motorola 6800-based microcomputers in assembler code. It was used extensively by amateur radio operators in the 1980s and 1990s but has now fallen out of use as improved PC-based data modes are now used and teleprinters became out of fashion. AMTOR improves on RTTY by incorporating error detection or error correction techniques. The protocol remains relatively uncomplicated and AMTOR performs well even in poor and noisy HF conditions. AMTOR operates in one of two modes: an error detection mode and an automatic repeat request (ARQ) mode. The AMTOR protocol utilizes a 7-bit code for each character, with each code-word having four mark and three space bits. If the received code does not match a four-to-three (4:3) ratio, the receiver assumes an error has occurred. In error detection mode, the code word will be dropped; in automatic repeat request mode, the receiver requests that the original data be resent. AMTOR also supports FEC in which simple bit-errors can be corrected. AMTOR utilizes FSK, with a frequency shift of 170 Hz, and a symbol rate of 100 Baud. AMTOR is rarely used today, as other protocols such as PSK31 are becoming favoured by amateur operators for real-time text communications. The ARRL has announced that as of August 17, 2009, it will be dropping AMTOR bulletin service in favor of the more popular MFSK16 and PSK31 modes. ==Further reading== * * ==Notes== Category:Quantized radio modulation modes ","title":"AMTOR"},{"id":"2545846","text":"In fluid dynamics, the enstrophy can be interpreted as another type of potential density; or, more concretely, the quantity directly related to the kinetic energy in the flow model that corresponds to dissipation effects in the fluid. It is particularly useful in the study of turbulent flows, and is often identified in the study of thrusters as well as the field of combustion theory. The enstrophy can be described as the integral of the square of the vorticity ω,Doering, C. R. and Gibbon, J. D. (1995).

Here, since the curl gives a scalar field in two dimensions (vortex) corresponding to the vector-valued velocity solving in the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations, we can integrate its square over a surface S to retrieve an operator on the space of possible velocity fields, known as a current. This equation is however somewhat misleading. Here we have chosen a simplified version of the enstrophy derived from the incompressibility condition, which is equivalent to vanishing divergence of the velocity field, : abla \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{u} = 0 \\\\,.

Its rulers belonged to the Swabian branch of the Hohenzollern dynasty. ==History== New Castle at Hechingen The County of Hohenzollern-Hechingen was created in 1576, upon the partition of the County of Hohenzollern, a fief of the Holy Roman Empire. When the last count of Hohenzollern, Charles I of Hohenzollern (1512–1579) died, the territory was to be divided up between his three sons: * Eitel Frederick IV of Hohenzollern-Hechingen (1545–1605) * Charles II of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen (1547–1606) * Christopher of Hohenzollern-Haigerloch (1552–1592) Unlike the Hohenzollerns of Brandenburg and Prussia, the Hohenzollerns of southwest Germany remained Roman Catholic. The County was raised to a principality in 1623. The principality joined the Confederation of the Rhine in 1806 and was a member state of the German Confederation between 1815 and 1850. The democratic Revolution of 1848 was relatively successful in Hohenzollern, and on 16 May 1848, the Prince was forced to accept the establishment of a constitution. However, the conflict between monarch and democrats continued, and on 6 August 1849, Hohenzollern was occupied by Prussian forces. On 7 December 1849, Prince Friedrich Wilhelm Konstantin sold the country to his relative, King Frederick William IV of Prussia. On 12 March 1850, Hohenzollern-Hechingen officially became part of Prussia, and formed together with Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen the Province of Hohenzollern. ==Rulers== Coat of arms of a prince of Hohenzollern-Hechingen ===Counts of Hohenzollern-Hechingen (1576–1623)=== * Eitel Friedrich IV, Count 1576–1605 (1545-1605), eldest surviving son of Karl I of Hohenzollern ** Johann Georg, Count 1605–1623 (1577-1623), created Reichsfürst von Hohenzollern-Hechingen 1623 ===Princes of Hohenzollern-Hechingen (1623–1850)=== * Johann Georg, 1st Prince Mar 23-Sep 28 1623 (1577-1623) ** ', 2nd Prince 1623–1661 (1601-1661) ** Philipp Christoph Friedrich, 3rd Prince 1661–1671 (1616-1671) *** Friedrich Wilhelm, 4th Prince 1671–1735 (1663-1735) **** Friedrich Ludwig, 5th Prince 1735–1750 (1688-1750) *** Prince Hermann Friedrich of Hohenzollern-Hechingen (1665-1733) **** Josef Friedrich Wilhelm, 6th Prince 1750–1798 (1717-1798) **** Prince Franz Xaver of Hohenzollern-Hechingen (1720-1765) ***** Hermann, 7th Prince 1798–1810 (1751-1810) ****** Frederick, 8th Prince 1810–1838 (1776-1838) ******* Constantine, 9th Prince 1838–1850 (1801-1869), sons were without dynastic rights, the Counts of Rothenburg :After cession of territory to Prussia, the Prince continued to use his title. :Line became extinct 1869 at Prince Constantine's death, and titles passed to the Hohenzollern- Sigmaringen line. ==References== ==External links== Category:1850 disestablishments Category:States and territories established in 1576 Category:Hechingen Category:States of the Confederation of the Rhine Category:Principalities of the Holy Roman Empire Category:States of the German Confederation Category:Former states and territories of Baden-Württemberg Category:Swabian Jura Category:Early Modern history of Germany ","title":"Hohenzollern-Hechingen"},{"id":"2545857","text":"2000 Mikhail Alexandrovich Ulyanov (; 20 November 1927 - 26 March 2007) was a Soviet and Russian actor who was one of the most recognized persons of the post-World War II Soviet theatre and cinema.

After two years of studies in the studio at Omsk Drama he went to Moscow and entered the Schukin Theatre School in 1946. Ulyanov worked in the Vakhtangov Theatre from 1950 and directed it from 1987. He played a wide range of characters on stage, with Rogozhin in Dostoevsky’s Idiot being the most remarkable of them. In 1979 he staged Vasily Shukshin’s epic novel I have come to give you freedom, where he starred as Stepan Razin. In 1985 Mikhail Ulyanov staged the satirical pamphlet The Child Buyer by the American playwright John Hersey. As regards movies, he was frequently cast in the parts of staunch Communist leaders like Vladimir Lenin and Marshal Zhukov. His well-known character Yegor Trubnikov in Predsedatel (Chairman) (1964) became a Soviet classic and his most emblematic role. The Brothers Karamazov, a 1969 film he co-directed, was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film and was entered into the 6th Moscow International Film Festival. He also starred in Tema (1979) and Private Life (1982), the films that won top awards at the Berlin Film Festival and Venice Film Festival, respectively. More recently, he was acclaimed for the roles of Julius Caesar in the screening of Shakespeare's play (1990), Pontius Pilate in the film adaptation of The Master and Margarita (1994), and an avenging veteran marksman in The Rifleman of the Voroshilov Regiment (1999), directed by Stanislav Govorukhin.

Showley May 12, 2002 His father owned a bakery where the young Spanos started working at the age of eight. According to his autobiography, Spanos was \\"born into conflict\\", since his parents were constantly fighting. Spanos's mother even left the family home for two years and attempted to take two children with her, but his parents reunited when he was a teenager and remained married until his death. Spanos, who played a large part in mediating the conflict between his parents, stated that his turbulent home life was the reason he strove to provide a stable environment for his own children. In 1942 he dropped out of college at the California Polytechnic School and joined the Army Air Force training as a pilot but left the program and instead served as a tail gunner during World War II. Spanos earned varsity letters in swimming and diving at the University of the Pacific in Stockton and later distinguished himself as an amateur golfer. ==Career== In 1951, he borrowed $800 from a local banker to buy a truck which he then used to sell sandwiches to migrant farm workers in the San Joaquin Valley. He invested his earnings in real estate and at the suggestion of his tax accountants, started to build apartments. In 1960, he founded A.G. Spanos Companies, which by 1977 had become the largest apartment builder in the United States. The corporation is based in Stockton and has 10 subsidiaries. In 1984, Spanos bought 60% of the San Diego Chargers (now Los Angeles Chargers) from majority owner Eugene Klein for $48.3 million. Over the next 10 years, he bought out the shares of several small co-owners, bringing his control of the team to 97%. The remaining 3% was held by San Diego restaurateur George Pernicano, an investor in the team since a few years after its inception, until Pernicano's death in October 2016; and Bill Fox, a local community leader, until his death in 2020.Remembering Bill Fox Since 1993, Spanos's son Dean has handled the daily operations of the franchise. According to Forbes, as of 2015 the Los Angeles Chargers are worth $995 million. ==Philanthropy and political contributions== Spanos donated $500,000 to renovate the Fox Theatre in downtown Stockton, and with the approval of the City of Stockton, renamed the facility the Fox California Bob Hope Theatre. The Alex G. Spanos Center in Stockton, the Alex G. Spanos Stadium for Lincoln High School in Stockton, the Alex G. Spanos Sports and Recreation Complex in Sacramento, the Alex G. Spanos Training Center at UCSD and the Alex G. Spanos Stadium at Cal Poly are named after him. Spanos was one of the largest contributors to George W. Bush's re-election campaign in 2004. By contributing $5 million to 527 groups that supported the Bush campaign in 2004, Spanos ranked among the top five GOP donors. President Bush appointed Spanos to the Kennedy Center board in 2004. Spanos was inducted into the California Building Industry Hall of Fame in 2005. Spanos also received the AHEPA Award, an award that recognizes members of the community for their contributions and achievements in their chosen field of endeavor. ==Personal life== In 1948, Spanos married Faye Papafaklis. They had four children: Dean Spanos, the Chargers' team president; Michael Spanos, the Chargers' executive vice president; Alexis Spanos Ruhl, a vice president of A.G.

Urquhart is the name of the parish. The parish of Urquhart is virtually the original Ferintosh barony and was part of Nairnshire until transferred to Ross and Cromary in 1892 under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1889. Its owner, Duncan Forbes (1644-1704) of Culloden, was also a major landowner in Nairnshire. In the 21st century, due to amalgamations a Ferintosh \\"Parish\\" Church is at nearby Conon Bridge. The former Urquhart Parish Church is close to the Ferintosh Burn (see below). During the 1688 Glorious Revolution in Scotland, Forbes was a prominent supporter of the new regime and the Ferintosh distillery was destroyed by the Jacobites. In 1690, he was granted the right to distil whisky in Ferintosh without being subject to the normal excise regulations. In the 1760s, his grandson John Forbes enlarged the existing distillery and built three more. In 1965, the Ben Wyvis distillery in nearby Dingwall changed its name to Ferintosh but ceased operations in 1977. A natural amphitheatre at the Ferintosh Burn was used for open-air gatherings during Presbyterian communion seasons in the 18th and 19th centuries. Ferintosh Free Church has a much closer link to Ferintosh, as this is where Dr John MacDonald (1779-1849) ministered. He was a notable minister of the parish.

After the death of his uncle Gille Brigte in 1185, Lochlann went about to seize the land of Gille Brigte's heirs. In this aim he had to defeat the men who would defy his authority in the name of Gille Brigte's heir. He seems to have done so, defeating the resistors, who were led by men called Gille Pátraic and Henric Cennédig. Yet resistance continued under a warrior called Gille Coluim of Galloway. Lochlann's aims moreover encouraged the wrath of a more important political figure than any of the above. King Henry II of England was outraged. A few years before Gille Brigte's death, Henry had taken his son and successor Donnchad as a hostage. Hence Henry was the patron and protector of the man Lochlann was trying to disinherit. When King William of Scotland was ordered to visit Henry in southern England, William was told that Lochlann must be stopped. However, William and Lochlann were friends, and so in the end Henry himself brought an army to Carlisle, and threatened to invade unless Lochlann would submit to his judgment. Lochlann did so. As it transpired, Lochlann kept most of Galloway, and Donnchad was given the new \\"Mormaerdom\\" of Carrick in compensation. More than any previous Lord of Galloway, he was the loyal man and vassal of the King of Scotland. After all, he owed his lands to the positive influence of King William. Whereas Lochlann's grandfather, Fergus had called himself King of Galloway, Lochlann's favorite title was \\"Constable of the King of Scots\\". Lochlann had led William's armies north into Moireabh against the pretender Domnall mac Uilleim, who claimed the Scottish throne as a grandson of King Donnchad II of Scotland. Lochlann defeated him in 1187 at the Battle of Mam Garvia, a mysterious location probably near Dingwall. Lochlann, unlike his uncle Gille Brigte, welcomed French and English colonization into his eastern lands. In this, he was following his overlord, King William I of Scotland. Of all the Lords of Galloway, Lochlann is the least mentioned in the Gaelic annals, suggesting that he had lost touch somewhat with his background in the world of greater Irish Sea Gaeldom. In 1200, he was in the company of King William in England, who was giving homage to the new king, John. Lochlann used the opportunity to make legal proceeding in Northampton regarding the property claims of his wife, Helena, daughter and heiress of Richard de Morville. It was here that he met his death and was buried. Lochlann and Helena had a son Alan, who succeeded to Galloway. In 1191/1192, Lochlann founded Glenluce Abbey.Stell (1991) p. 153. ==References== * * Oram, Richard, The Lordship of Galloway, (Edinburgh, 2000) Category:12th-century births Category:1200 deaths Category:Medieval Gaels from Scotland Category:People from Dumfries and Galloway Category:12th-century Scottish people Category:Lords of Galloway ","title":"Lochlann of Galloway"},{"id":"2545895","text":"A lone bugler plays Taps during a military funeral held at Arlington National Cemetery for former U.S. Secretary of Defense Caspar W.

The term is most commonly used by dentists, orthodontists, or maxillofacial specialists to refer to para-functional uses of the mouth, tongue and jaw. Oral para-functional habits may include bruxism (tooth-clenching and/or grinding), tongue tension (\\"tongue thrusting\\"), fingernail biting, pencil or pen chewing, mouth breathing, and any other habitual use of the mouth unrelated to eating, drinking, or speaking. Crenated tongue is a descriptive term for when scalloping develops on the lateral margins of the tongue as a result of habitual forcing of the tongue against the teeth. Contrary to common belief, functional activities such as chewing are not the main cause of tooth wear. Parafunctional habits are the most destructive forces for several reasons. Whereas teeth rarely come into contact during normal chewing, grinding of teeth may occur 1-4 hours in a 24-hour period, most often during sleep. The amount of pressure placed on teeth during functional habits is , but the pressure can range from during parafunctional habits. The direction of forces during functional habits is placed vertically along the long axis of teeth, which is the least harmful because of the anatomical structure of the attachment of teeth to the bone. On the other hand, parafunctional habits direct their forces horizontally. Normally, the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) acts as a class III lever, which helps to restrict the amount of force generated. Class I or class II levers may be created during bruxism, which generates more force from the same amount of muscle activity and subsequently delivers more force to the teeth. Extreme force upon the teeth can occur during some situations as a protective reflex. When a person senses the risk of an imminent car crash, for example, the teeth arches are normally firmly occluded. This over-clenching is still considered parafunctional, although it serves a functional purpose; the maxilo-mandibular complex is much less vulnerable to harm and dislocation because it is bonded by muscles and interposed teeth. When this kind of reflex acts, it is very important to have a good memory of one's \\"best bite\\" position in order to avoid fractures. It is one hypothesis for why military jet pilots crack more teeth than auxiliary crew. ==References== Category:Pathology of temporomandibular joints, muscles of mastication and associated structures ","title":"Parafunctional activity"},{"id":"2545914","text":"Tun Abang Openg bin Abang Sapiee (7 October 1905 – 28 March 1969)Profile of Abang Haji Openg was a Malaysian politician who served as the first Yang di- Pertua Negeri of Sarawak (Governor of Sarawak), upon the independence of Sarawak from Great Britain and formation of Malaysia in 1963.

The name of this group arises from the fact that all species within it have only nine easily visible primary feathers on each wing (in reality most, if not all, also have a 10th primary, but it is greatly reduced and largely concealed). These families (with the possible exception of the Fringillidae) appear to form a clade; the status of the peculiar olive warbler and the distinct bananaquit (Coereba flaveola) need to be clarified. In most bird classifications, this group is placed at the end of the taxonomic sequence. In the Sibley–Ahlquist classification, the nine- primaried oscines are treated as a single family (Fringillidae sensu Sibley & Ahlquist). As noted above, this is not correct as they defined it, and in any case has not found widespread support. A more common scheme, often used by American ornithologists, is to treat most of these groups in a vastly expanded Emberizidae, but this is also likely to be overlumping.

It was the first title to make use of the Games for Windows label. Company of Heroes is set during the Second World War and contains two playable factions. Players aim to capture strategic resource sectors located around the map, which they use to build base structures, produce new units, and defeat their enemies. In the single-player campaign the player commands two U.S. military units during the Battle of Normandy (Operation Overlord) and the liberation of France (Operation Cobra). Depending on the mission, the player controls either Able Company of the 29th Infantry Division's 116th Infantry, or Fox Company of the 101st Airborne Division's 506th PIR. Company of Heroes received widespread acclaim, winning multiple awards for the best strategy game of the year. Two expansions were released: Opposing Fronts in 2007 and Tales of Valor in 2009. A free-to-play massively multiplayer online version of the game, Company of Heroes Online, was briefly released as open beta in South Korea in April 2010, before being cancelled in March 2011. The success of the game led to a sequel, Company of Heroes 2, which was released in 2013. , the Company of Heroes series has sold more than 4 million copies. A film adaptation, also titled Company of Heroes, was released in 2013. An iPad version, developed and published by Feral Interactive, was released in February 2020. A version for Android and iOS mobile devices was released in September 2020. ==Gameplay== Gameplay screenshot ===Multiplayer=== Company of Heroes allows multiplayer matches of 1-8 players via LAN or the Internet. Company of Heroes allows players to fight as both the Allied and Axis forces in multiplayer matches. For Company of Heroes, developer Relic Entertainment used a new online matchmaking system called Relic Online. Previous Relic games had used GameSpy Arcade or World Opponent Network services. This system includes many features that the previous systems did not have, including a built in automatch and ranking system. Relic Online matchmaking has been shutdown. In order to play multiplayer users must transfer the game to Steam. The Steam version does not allow for LAN matches. ===Game modes=== ====Victory Point Control==== These games focus on controlling several victory points around the middle of the map. These victory points can be captured similarly to strategic points. When one side has more victory points under their control than another, the other side's \\"points\\" start to decrease. When one side's counter runs out of points, they lose. Alternatively, the player can simply destroy all enemy structures to win the game. Before the start of the game, the host can choose between 250, 500, or 1000 points. The point function in Company of Heroes works much like the ticket feature in the Battlefield series. ====Annihilation==== Annihilation games lack the victory points of the VPC game mode. To win, the player needs to destroy all enemy buildings excluding observation posts on points. ==Plot== The single-player campaign puts the player in some of the major American operations during the Battle of Normandy. ==Development== M10 Wolverine and American troops in the Essence Engine. Company of Heroes is Relic's first title to use its Essence Engine, which allows various graphical effects, including high dynamic range lighting, dynamic lighting and shadows, advanced shader effects, and normal mapping. Company of Heroes also uses the Havok physics engine, giving it a more realistic physics system than previous RTS games. Parts of buildings can be destroyed by grenades, satchels, or mortars, and tanks can drive through sections of walls or other barriers. Smoke created from explosions behaves realistically as possible, including its behavior in wind. Debris is also influenced by explosions; a blast can send barrels flying and shower troops in dirt, while leaving behind a large crater. When infantry are bombarded by artillery, body parts sometimes detach and are dispersed over, and some units are thrown about in the immediate area. Bridges and buildings can be destroyed by engineers using demolitions. On May 29, 2007, Relic released the Company of Heroes patch v1.70, which included a new DirectX 10 rendering mode with better terrain, more world objects, and improved shadows and lighting. This patch made Company of Heroes the first commercial video game to support Direct3D 10. ==Expansions== ===Opposing Fronts=== Company of Heroes: Opposing Fronts is a standalone expansion pack. It contains two factions; the British Second Army and the Panzer Lehr Division (German Panzer Elite). Owners of Opposing Fronts are able to play against owners of Company of Heroes and vice versa, although only using the armies from the game they own. Owners of both games are able to play all four armies in multiplayer. Opposing Fronts was announced on April 5, 2007 and was released on September 24, 2007.

The game features the USSR's Red Army as a new faction and takes the player on various stages of the Eastern Front campaign, from Operation Barbarossa to the Battle of Berlin. It uses the Essence 3.0 engine which includes environmental effects and the \\"True Sight\\" and \\"ColdTech\\" systems mimicking unit line of sight and weather effects such as snow and mud as well as blizzards. ==References== ==External links== * Category:2006 video games Category:Aspyr games Category:Games for Windows certified games Category:Lua (programming language)-scripted video games Category:MacOS games Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:Real-time strategy video games Category:Relic Entertainment games Category:THQ games Category:Video games scored by Jeremy Soule Category:Video games developed in Canada Category:Video games set in France Category:Video games using Havok Category:Video games with expansion packs Category:Windows games Category:World War II video games Category:Fiction about the United States Army Category:Works about the British Armed Forces ","title":"Company of Heroes"},{"id":"2545941","text":"Transrealism is a literary mode that mixes the techniques of incorporating fantastic elements used in science fiction with the techniques of describing immediate perceptions from naturalistic realism. While combining the strengths of the two approaches, it is largely a reaction to their perceived weaknesses. Transrealism addresses the escapism and disconnect with reality of science fiction by providing for superior characterization through autobiographical features and simulation of the author's acquaintances. It addresses the tiredness and boundaries of realism by using fantastic elements to create new metaphors for psychological change and to incorporate the author's perception of a higher reality in which life is embedded. One possible source for this higher reality is the increasingly strange models of the universe put forward in theoretical astrophysics. Its main proponent and prominent figure is science fiction author Rudy Rucker. Rucker coined the term \\"transrealism\\" after reading Philip K Dick's A Scanner Darkly described as \\"transcendental autobiography,\\" and expounded the principles of transrealism in a short essay titled \\"A Transrealist Manifesto\\" in 1983. Rucker applied many of these principles in his short stories and novels, notably White Light and Saucer Wisdom. Damien Broderick has identified some other authors that have at some time utilized transrealist tropes to include Martin Amis, Margaret Atwood, Iain Banks, John Barth, J.G. Ballard, John Calvin Batchelor, Jonathan Carroll, Philip K. Dick especially, Karen Joy Fowler, Lisa Goldstein, James Morrow, Thomas Pynchon, Joanna Russ and James Tiptree Jr. Damien Broderick argues that a state of perception (termed transreality) that is playfully contrary to consensus reality is a prerequisite for writing effective transrealist fiction. The necessary viewpoint is playful in the sense that the author does not need to literally believe the fantastic interpretation of the perception and may support and undermine it through reference to speculative science. An example of this can be seen in Rucker's blog, where he discusses an experience in an airport terminal. In a 2014 essay, Damien Walter argued that science fiction and other literature were increasingly converging, and that the refusal of plot and \\"archetypal\\" characters in transrealism is \\"meant to be uncomfortable, by telling us that our reality is at best constructed, at worst non-existent\\". Transrealism's stance against consensus reality identifies it as a postmodern literature akin to surrealism and covering much the same ground as slipstream literature. Transrealism may be considered a subset of slipstream, depending on how the latter term is defined, or as Broderick posits, slipstream may be very nearly the same thing as transrealism. Broderick also argues that the approach to literature offered by science fiction as a whole, including both transrealism and slipstream, becomes more crucial as society possibly approaches a technological singularity. == References == ==Sources== *Broderick, Damien (2000).

It was first performed in Copenhagen on 24 January 1922 with the composer conducting. It is one of two of Nielsen's six symphonies lacking a subtitle, the other being the first. The Fifth Symphony has a non-customary structure, comprising two movements instead of the common three or four. Written in a modern musical language, it draws on the theme of contrast and opposition. The post-World War I composition is also described as having elements of war. ==Composition== There is no documentation of what inspired Nielsen to write his Fifth Symphony or when he started to write it, but it is generally understood that the first movement was composed in Humlebæk during the winter and spring of 1921. He stayed at his summer house at Skagen in the early summer. At the end of July he moved to a friend's home at Damgaard to compose the cantata Springtime on Funen, and was therefore only able to resume working on the second movement of the symphony in September, during his free time from his conducting work in Gothenburg. The whole symphony was finished on 15 January 1922, as dated on the score. He dedicated the new symphony to his friends Vera and Carl Johan Michaelsen. Having insufficient rehearsal time, the premiere took place only nine days later, conducted by the composer himself at the music society Musikforening in Copenhagen. ==Score== A work from the early 20th century, the Fifth Symphony is regarded as a modernistic musical piece. The symphony draws on all of the \\"deformation procedures\\" suggested by James Hepokoski regarding musical modernism: breakthrough deformation, introduction-coda frame, episodes within developmental space, various strophic/sonata hybrids and multi-movement forms in a single movement. Its fragmented nature, unpredictable character and sudden synchronization at the ending also point towards a self-conscious modernist aesthetic, though as in most of Nielsen’s early and middle works, non-modernist devices, including organicism and diatonicism, play some essential roles. As written in the original 1926 edition of the score, the Fifth Symphony is scored for 3 flutes (third doubling piccolo), 2 oboes, 2 clarinets, 2 bassoons, 4 horns, 3 trumpets, 3 trombones, tuba, timpani, cymbals, triangle, tambourine, snare drum, celesta, and strings. Some optional doublings are added in the 1950 edition of the score revised by Emil Telmányi and Erik Tuxen; these include the third flute doubling flute in G and the second bassoon doubling contrabassoon. These optional doublings are discarded in the latest 1998 Carl Nielsen Edition score, which was produced as a co- operation between the Danish Royal Library and Edition Wilhelm Hansen. The Fifth Symphony has two movements instead of the usual four, which is the only time Nielsen used this structure. Nielsen explained jokingly in an interview that it was not difficult to write the first three movements of a symphony but by the finale most composers had run out of ideas. The work has a craggy profile as \\"it is littered with false climaxes at every turn\\". The first movement climaxes in a battle between the orchestra and a renegade snare- drummer, who can only be silenced by the full forces of his colleagues in the final bars. The second movement continues the struggle with shivers of anxiety, building through repetitions and detours to the final victorious grand explosion. ===Tempo giusto—Adagio non troppo=== The opening of the Tempo giusto section of the first movement The first movement begins with violas softly oscillating between the C and A notes; after four bars of the single, minimally-inflected line, a pair of bassoons enters with the initial theme. The beginning has been described by Nielsen scholar Robert Simpson as like being \\"in outer space\\"; the subsequent wave-like line \\"appears from nowhere, as if one were suddenly made aware of time as a dimension\\". The very first theme ends at b. 20 with a descending scale, followed by a fortissimo interruption from violas and a subsequent horn and flute dialogue. The prominent feature of instrumental pairing does not lead to any permanent thematic or textural stability, but contrarily grows into a persistent textural sparseness. After an emotionless string passage which encloses another brief warning from violas, woodwinds cry out amid a percussive background.; see also While the monotonous rhythm of snare drum continues, violins respond tortuously, only to be overwhelmed by the mood of the \\"savage and destructively egotistical\\" (Simpson’s description) clarinet and flute.; The turmoil continues as the bass struggles to rise from the tonic (C) to the dominant (G), invoking a new clash with the percussion; the attempt at struggle fails as the bass is foiled at G flat when the ominous violin melody is distorted and disintegrates.; The huge incongruity between harmonic and melodic parameters threatens the music with fracture and collapse. After gloomy phrases from various woodwinds, the music fades, leaving a feebly pulsing D with tiny hints of percussion sounds.; The opening of the Adagio non troppo section of the first movement An oboe triplet figure then reveals the warm theme in G major of the Adagio non troppo section, a contrast to the prior cold landscape. The texture expands contrapuntally for the first time; the tonality brightens to B major and, after a climax, wanes to G major again.; The full strings are soon disturbed by an \\"evil\\" motif on woodwinds, playing the shivering element from the work's opening; tension between wind and strings intensifies as tonality shifts within instrumental groups in their respective directions.; With a further clash, the music is menaced by the snare drum at a tempo (quarter note ♩=116) faster than that of the orchestra, and at its climax comes the composer's instruction to the snare drummer to improvise \\"as if at all costs he wants to stop the progress of the orchestra\\".; (This instruction is not included in the 1950 edition of the score, being replaced by a written rhythmic line and instruction \\"cad. ad lib.\\" after a few bars.) The warm theme eventually triumphs in a sustaining grandeur, as is affirmed by the snare drum actually joining the orchestral fanfare. When all subsides, echoes in woodwinds are heard and a solitary clarinet is left to mourn in a tragic atmosphere, recapturing ideas from the whole movement:; \\"Who would have thought that so much could have come out of a gently waving viola line in empty space?\\" ===Allegro—Presto—Andante un poco tranquillo—Allegro=== The opening theme on 1st violin of the second movement The second movement in four sections consists of an \\"exposition\\", a fast fugue, a slow fugue and a brief coda. The music bursts in (in B major, despite the A major key-signature), and continues with great conflicts between instruments, until a broad, calm theme is found in the slow fugue. At the close it pivots on B flat, the dominant of E flat major; various elements collide and “fall together” into an uplifting 23-bar conclusion. This movement was portrayed by Robert Simpson as arising from the ashes and ruins left by the conflict in the first movement.; In the first edition of his book he expressed hesitation over analysing this part, feeling that it either requires a very deep analysis, or should be described in the fewest possible words. Jack Lawson, founder and president of The Carl Nielsen Society of Great Britain, commented that in the second movement, the listener \\"inhabits a world reborn, at first calm but a world which produces new struggles and menacing dangers\\" and \\"transports the listener through the depths or above the heights of more standard musical perceptions\\". ==Interpretation== Though the Fifth Symphony bears no title, Nielsen affirmed that, like his previous symphonies, it presents \\"the only thing that music in the end can express: resting forces in contrast to active ones\\". In a statement to one of his students, Ludvig Dolleris, Nielsen described the symphony as \\"the division of dark and light, the battle between evil and good\\" and the opposition between \\"Dreams and Deeds\\". To Hugo Seligman he described the contrast between \\"vegetative\\" and \\"active\\" states of mind in the symphony. The symphony is widely stated to be a work about contrast and opposition.; The \\"evil\\" motif as it first appears in the Adagio non troppo section in the first movement. The motif borrows materials from the Tempo giusto section. The composer asserted that he was not conscious of the influence of World War I when he was composing the symphony, but added that \\"not one of us is the same as we were before the war\\". Simon Rattle also described the Fifth Symphony, rather than the Fourth as proclaimed by the composer, as being Nielsen's war symphony. In fact, the phrase \\"dark, resting forces, alert forces\\" can be found on the back cover of the pencil draft score. Nielsen may have considered it an encapsulation of the contrast both between and within the two movements of the symphony. Nielsen also wrote to Dolleris about the presence of the \\"evil\\" motif in the first movement of the symphony: > Then the \\"evil\\" motif intervenes — in the woodwind and strings — and the > side drum becomes more and more angry and aggressive; but the nature-theme > grows on, peaceful and unaffected, in the brass. Finally the evil has to > give way, a last attempt and then it flees — and with a strophe thereafter > in consoling major mode a solo clarinet ends this large idyll-movement, an > expression of vegetative (idle, thoughtless) Nature. Although Nielsen asserted that the symphony is non-programmatic, he once expressed his views on it thus: > I'm rolling a stone up a hill, I'm using the powers in me to bring the stone > to the top. The stone lies there so still, powers are wrapped in it, until I > give it a kick and the same powers are released and the stone rolls down > again. But you mustn't take that as a programme! ==Reception== The immediate reception of the press to the symphony was generally positive, especially the first movement. Axel Kjerulf wrote that in the Adagio section, he heard a Dream giving way to a \\"Dream about Deeds... Carl Nielsen has maybe never written more powerful, beautiful, fundamentally healthy and genuine music than here.\\" However, critics were more hesitant towards the second movement. In August Felsing's review, he commented that \\"Intellectual art is what the second part is, and it is a master who speaks. But the pact with the eternal in art which shines forth in the first part is broken here.\\" Musicians' opinions were divided. Victor Bendix, a long-time supporter and friend, wrote to Nielsen the day after the premiere, calling the work a \\"Sinfonie filmatique, this dirty trenches-music, this impudent fraud, this clenched fist in the face of a defenceless, novelty-snobbish, titillation-sick public, commonplace people en masse, who lovingly lick the hand stained with their own noses' blood!\\" A Swedish performance on 20 January 1924, under the baton of Georg Schnéevoigt, caused quite a scandal; the Berlingske Tidende reported that some in the audience could not take the modernism of the work: > Midway through the first part with its rattling drums and 'cacophonous' > effects a genuine panic broke out. Around a quarter of the audience rushed > for the exits with confusion and anger written over their faces, and those > who remained tried to hiss down the 'spectacle', while the conductor Georg > Schnéevoigt drove the orchestra to extremes of volume. This whole intermezzo > underlined the humoristic-burlesque element in the symphony in such a way > that Carl Nielsen could certainly never have dreamed of. His representation > of modern life with its confusion, brutality and struggle, all the > uncontrolled shouts of pain and ignorance—and behind it all the side drum's > harsh rhythm as the only disciplining force—as the public fled, made a touch > of almost diabolic humour. For decades, Nielsen's music did not win recognition outside Denmark. The first recording was in 1933: Georg Høeberg with the Danish Radio Symphony Orchestra for Dancord. The first live recording was produced in 1950 with Erik Tuxen conducting the same orchestra at the Edinburgh Festival. An international breakthrough was made only when Leonard Bernstein recorded the symphony with the New York Philharmonic Orchestra in 1962 for CBS. This recording helped Nielsen's music to achieve appreciation beyond his home country, and is considered one of the finest recorded accounts of the symphony. ==References== ==Sources== ===Books=== * * * See pages 84–104.

Chief Walkara (c. 1808 – 1855; also known as Wakara, Wahkara, Chief Walker or Colorow) was a Shoshone leader of the Utah Indians known as the Timpanogo and Sanpete Band. It is not completely clear what cultural group the Utah or Timpanogo Indians belonged to, but they are listed as Shoshone. He had a reputation as a diplomat, horseman and warrior, and a military leader of raiding parties, and in the Wakara War. He was the most prominent Native American chief in the Utah area when the Mormon Pioneers arrived in 1847. One observer described Walkara in 1843 as: \\"the principal ruling chief... owing his position to great wealth. He is a good trader, trafficking with the whites and reselling goods to such of his nation as are less skillful in striking a bargain.\\" In 1865, some ten years after his death, the Timpanogo agreed to go live on the Uintah Reservation under Chief Tabby-To-Kwanah and merged with the Northern Shoshone. Walkara is often referred to as Ute, but this is incorrect. Ute is a blanket name for many tribes. The Shoshone have cultural and linguistic heritage as part of the Numic branch of the Uto-Aztecan language family. Walkara is Shoshone and his name, Walkara, means Hawk, in Shoshone. == Timpanogos Chief == Walkara was born approximately 1808 along the Spanish Fork River in Utah. He was one of the five sons of a chief of the Timpanogos Tribe. He spent much time fishing along the Utah Lake shores in what is now Provo and Vineyard. Walkara could communicate in Spanish, English, and native languages. His brothers included Chief Arapeen, for whom the Arapeen Valley near Sterling, Utah was named; Chief San-Pitch, for whom Sanpete County is named; Chief Kanosh, for whom a town was named; and Chief Sowiette. He gathered a raiding band of warriors from Great Basin tribes, Ute, Paiute and Shoshone, and often rode with his brothers on raids. His band raided ranches and attacked travelers in the Great Basin and along the Old Spanish Trail between New Mexico and California. Small native bands and tribes in the area paid him tribute in return for protection and assistance. Walkara was often distinguished by the yellow face paint that he wore. Some people called him, 'The Greatest Horse thief in History.' In California, especially, Walkara was known as a great horse thief, due to his stealing around 3,000 horses in Southern California in the 1840s. In some of these raids, the band fought Cahuilla leader Juan Antonio. Mountain men James Beckwourth and Thomas \\"Pegleg\\" Smith were involved in this campaign and were known to trade with Walkara, providing the band with whiskey in return for horses. In 1845 Benjamin Davis Wilson, Justice of the Peace and assistant for Indian affairs in Riverside County, was commissioned to track down Walkara and his marauders and bring them to justice, but never succeeded. Their mission was interrupted by the discovery of the Big Bear Lake area. No additional account of the pursuit was ever reported. Horsethief Canyon and Little Horsethief Canyon in the Cajon Pass are named for Walkara's exploits. Several men were killed in both canyons. == Ambivalent relations with the Mormons and settlers == When Mormon pioneers arrived in what is today known as Utah, they were caught between the Shoshone and the Ute: both tribes claimed the Salt Lake Valley. The settlers refused to pay the Shoshone for the land, knowing that they would have to pay the Ute as well. Brigham Young, the president of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), recommended the Mormon settlers avoid trading with Native American tribes. At this time, the Ute bands of Indians were divided, but Walkara's band was one of the most influential. Walkara recognized that trading with the settlers would enable his band to become more powerful. However, the Ute were angered by the Mormons building a permanent settlement in the area, and Walkara favored driving them out by force. His brother, Sowiette, wanted to accommodate the Mormons. After initial disagreement, Walkara conceded to Sowiette. Instead of war, the Mormons initially had peace with the Timpanogo. The first act of violence between the Ute and the Mormon settlers occurred on March 5, 1849. Some Ute had disregarded their leaders' instruction not to steal from the Mormons, and had killed and stolen livestock from the settlers. In retaliation, the settlers set out to find those responsible. They ambushed some Ute, resulting in six killed, in an event known as the Battle Creek massacre. Later in April, Walkara supported Ute attacks on Fort Utah; nevertheless, Young and Walkara entered into a peaceful relationship by May. In late 1849, Walkara met with Young, asking him to send men to help settle Ute land, and with that request, settlers including Welcome Chapman went to the Sanpete Valley. Young dispatched a company of about 225 settlers, under the direction of Isaac Morley. The settlers arrived at the present location of Manti, Utah in November, and established a base camp for the winter, digging temporary shelters into the south side of the hill on which the LDS Church's Manti Utah Temple now stands. It was an isolated place, at least four days by wagon from the nearest Mormon settlement. Relations between the Mormon settlers and the local Ute Indians were helpful and cooperative. Morley and his settlers felt that part of their purpose was to bring the gospel to the Indians. Morley wrote, \\"Did we come here to enrich ourselves in the things of this world? No. We were sent to enrich the Natives and comfort the hearts of the long oppressed.\\" During the severe winter, a measles epidemic broke out. The Mormons used their limited medicine to nurse the Indians, and likewise when Mormon supplies ran low, the Ute shared their food supply. In 1850, Walkara agreed to be baptized into the LDS Church with his son. Walkara regularly traded women and children as slaves in order to trade for horses, guns, and ammunition. Mormon settlers tried to stop this practice, but their efforts only angered the tribe for interfering with their Indian slave trade. Relations with the Mormon settlers deteriorated rapidly. Walkara's raiding lifestyle was under pressure from an increasing number of federal troops in the Great Basin and Southwest and from the expansion of Latter-day Saint settlements. One conjecture holds that Mormon settlers also strongly objected to the profitable traditional trade in native slaves and interfered in many transactions. This is contradictory to the fact that Young was not, by his own account, an abolitionist. In addition, increasing numbers of non-Mormon trading expeditions and settlers were traveling through Central and Southern Utah, adding to the competition for water and resources. Some isolated natives were killed, and Walkara and other leaders became increasingly angry with both the Mormonees and the Mericats, designations used by local tribes to distinguish Mormon settlers from non-Mormon Americans. ==Walker War == Growing tension between the Mormon settlers and the Ute Indians resulted in the Walker War. The war was sparked on July 17, 1853 by a confrontation with James Anderson Ivie in Springville in Utah Valley. It resulted in the death of a band member, Shower-O-Cats, a relative of Walkara. The Indians wanted to trade goods near Ivie's home, when Ivie tried to intervene in an argument over a trade between a Ute and his wife. Ivie wounded several of the Indians and one died. When Ivie would not comply with Indian requests for compensation, believing that he acted in self-defense, tension between Mormon settlers and the Ute reached its peak. A militia unit went to Walkara's camp in Payson to work out a peaceful resolution; however, no arrangement was agreed upon. The Utes demanded retribution, seeking the death of a Euro-American. When the Mormons refused, the Ute shot and killed Alexander Keele on July 18, 1853 in Payson. This event was the tipping point in the relations between the two groups. Indians started attacks in nearby towns. By July 25, Walkara was reported to be gathering Ute for a war. Mormon colonels Peter Conover and Stephen Markham rounded up men and called for volunteers to pursue the Ute, and families were advised to fortify their houses, store their grains, and protect their livestock. In a defensive effort, Brigham Young directed settlers to move from outlying farms and ranches and establish centralized forts. His people began to heavily guard the travel routes between Mormon settlements. Walkara and his warriors conducted raids against Mormon outposts in central and southern Utah; in turn pioneer militias retaliated. In one case, four settlers driving oxen-drawn wagons to Salt Lake City from Manti were attacked and killed at Uintah Springs on the night of September 30, 1853. Historical accounts indicate that pioneers retaliated the next day, and intermittent fighting continued until early November. In December of that year, Young offered amnesty to all the Ute. They did not respond and continued to commit violent acts for several more weeks. On March 24, Young sent Major E.A. Bedell, the federal Indian agent, to meet with Walkara and other Ute leaders. Bedell was to inquire if they would make a treaty with Young for the sale of their land. During the meeting with Bedell, Walkara said that \\"he would prefer not to sell if he could live peacefully with the white people which he was anxious to do.\\" The Walker War ended through this understanding personally negotiated between Young and Walkara that was finalized in May 1854 in Levan, near Nephi, Utah. In his contemporary work Incidents of Travel and Adventure in the Far West (1857), photographer and artist Solomon N. Carvalho gives an account of the peace council held between Walkara, other native leaders in central Utah, and Brigham Young. Carvalho took the opportunity to persuade the Indian leader to pose for a portrait, now held by the Thomas Gilcrease Institute, Tulsa, Oklahoma. Although immediate hostilities ended, none of the underlying conflicts were resolved. Walkara died of \\"lung fever\\" on 29 January 1855 at Meadow Creek, Utah. At his funeral, fifteen horses, two wives, and two children were killed and buried along with him. However, tensions remained; together with some who refused to accept the peace, another incident precipitated the longer and more costly Ute Black Hawk War a decade later. In all, casualties during the war totaled twelve white settlers and an equally modest number of Indians. In addition, U.S. surveyor John Williams Gunnison and seven members of his party were attacked and killed, apparently by local tribesmen, along the lower Sevier River in 1853. An archaeological dig in 2007 examined seven bodies of Native American men and boys found in a relatively shallow grave near Nephi. Wounds on some of the remains suggest these Native Americans were executed rather than killed in combat. One skeleton appeared to have been bound by a leather strap at the time of his death. The bodies probably belonged to members of a Utah or Goshute tribe. A rock monument was built in Memorial Park in Payson to commemorate the death of a settler during the war. Another was built in Spanish Fork, Utah at the site of the Old Palmyra Fort. === Tribe joining the LDS Church by baptism=== After the Walker War had ended, on July 27, 1854, under the direction of stake president Welcome Chapman, 120 members (103 males, 17 females) of Walkara's tribe were baptized as members of the LDS Church in Manti's City Creek. Walkara was possibly re-baptized at this time. After his baptism, he was renamed Joseph Walker. ==Slavery== There is controversy over whether Chief Walkara was involved in slavery and human sacrifice. His descendants report that such activities were never cultural with them and would have been considered dishonorable. Walkara supposedly was involved with the slave trade in the Great Basin. The custom of the Ute tribes allowed for them to sell women and children in exchange for supplies and horses, which they ate. Some children were acquired for trading through war raids and then were sold to Mexican traders who sold them as slaves in California or Mexico. A boy could typically be sold for $100, and girls were for $150 to $200. At first, church leaders encouraged Walkara's slave trade. Apostle George A. Smith gave him talking papers that certified \\"it is my desire that they [Captain Walker and Peteetneet] should be treated as friends, and as they wish to Trade horses, Buckskins and Piede children, we hope them success and prosperity and good bargains.\\" Brigham Young encouraged the saints to \\"buy up the Lamanite children as fast as they could,\\" for the purpose of educating them and teach them the gospel of Jesus Christ. In 1906, Susa Young Gates accused Walkara of kidnapping Brigham Young's daughter, Sally Young Kanosh. However, there is little evidence that it occurred. ==Child sacrifice== Walkara was said to have been involved in human sacrifice. The Ute had a practice of burying children alive to serve as servants to the recently deceased and be their companion in the next life. Walkara may have had two captive children killed to relieve his own pain. When the Walker War ended, Walkara's daughter was sick; he said that if his child died, an Indian woman must be sacrificed so that his daughter's spirit did not travel alone in the spirit world. Upon Walkara's death, two Indian women, three deceased children, twenty horses, and one live boy were buried as formal sacrifices with him. == Death == Walkara died after a lingering illness, possibly pneumonia, on January 28, 1855, while at Meadow Creek, Utah Territory. As Chief of the Timpanogos Utes, he reportedly had a rather elaborate burial and was entombed in a small canyon in the mountains, along with animal and human sacrifices. This burial scene involved carrying his corpse to the rocky entombment site by binding his corpse so that it sat upright on a horse. Walkara's weapons and ammunition were laid beside him and his personal horses were killed to company him on his journey to the next life. He had a letter from Brigham Young in his hand. A live boy and girl were placed on top of the burial pit in order to watch over his grave until they joined Walkara in the afterlife. The boy broke free and cried for help. Although nearby settlers heard him, gunfire from the Indian tribe warned them not to interfere. Isaac Morley, his long time friend, had promised Walkara that he would speak at the entombment. Morley later described the terrible ordeal and reported that he dare not object to the ceremony for fear of causing an uprising in the already delicate relationship between Walkara's brothers and the white settlers. ==References== ==Sources== *Mueller, Max Perry.

Rogaining is an orienteering sport of long distance cross-country navigation, involving both route planning and navigation between checkpoints using a variety of map types. In a rogaine, teams of two to five people choose which checkpoints to visit within a time limit with the intent of maximizing their score. Teamwork, endurance, competition and an appreciation for the natural environment are features of the sport. Championship rogaines are 24 hours long, but rogaines can be as short as two hours. ==History== Rogaining can trace its roots back to 1947 when the first of many events with some of the features of rogaines was organized by the Melbourne University Mountaineering Club. The events from the 1940s eventually led to the birth of the sport of rogaining in April 1976, in Melbourne, Australia. The sport was named, rules were adopted and the world’s first rogaining association was formed (the Victorian Rogaining Association). Growth of the association and the sport occurred rapidly over the next decade. The word rogaining is derived from the names of three of the founders, Rod Phillips, Gail Davis (née Phillips) and Neil Phillips (RoGaiNe, hence \\"rogaining\\", \\"rogainer\\" etc.) who were all members of the Surrey-Thomas Rover Crew which organized the world's first rogaine. The name was formally adopted by the Victorian Rogaining Association at its inaugural annual general meeting in August 1976 and accepted by Scouts Australia and University bushwalking groups to give the new sport an identity in its own right. World Rogaining Championships were first held in 1992, and then every two years from 1996 to 2012. Since then they have been held annually, with the country chosen two years in advance by the International Rogaining Federation. As of 2017 this has changed back again to every two years. * 1st World Rogaining Championship (1992): Beechworth, Australia, about 200 teams * 2nd World Rogaining Championship (1996): Mt Singleton, Western Australia, 640 participants in 271 teams * 3rd World Rogaining Championship (1998): Kamloops, British Columbia, Canada * 4th World Rogaining Championship (2000): Christchurch, New Zealand * 5th World Rogaining Championship (2002): Lesna, Czech Republic, 202 teams * 6th World Rogaining Championship (2004): Arizona, USA, 380 participants from 15 countries and 33 U.S. states. * 7th World Rogaining Championships (2006): New South Wales, Australia; 691 participants (311 teams), 125 from overseas * 8th World Rogaining Championship (2008): Karula National Park, Estonia; 748 participants (339 teams) from 22 countries. * 9th World Rogaining Championship (2010): Cheviot, New Zealand; 522 participants (251 teams) * 10th World Rogaining Championship (2012): Přebuz, Czech Republic * 11th World Rogaining Championship (2013): Alol, Russian Federation * 12th World Rogaining Championship (2014): Black Hills, South Dakota, USA * 13th World Rogaining Championship (2015): Lapland, Finland * 14th World Rogaining Championship (2016): Alice Springs, Australia * 15th World Rogaining Championship (2017): Rāzna National Park, Latvia * 16th World Rogaining Championship (2019): La Molina, Catalonia, Spain ==Basic play== Teams of two to five members visit as many checkpoints as possible in the time allowed. Shorter duration rogaines often allow solo competitors. Checkpoints are scored differently depending on level of difficulty in reaching them; therefore teams choose a strategy (for example, to visit many low score checkpoints). Teams travel entirely on foot, navigating by map and compass between checkpoints in terrain that varies from open farmland to hilly forest. A central base camp known as a \\"hash house\\" provides hot meals throughout the event and teams may return at any time to eat, rest or sleep. Teams travel at their own pace and participants can practise cross-country navigation at their own level of competition and comfort. Team members stay within earshot of each other. The duration of a championship rogaine is 24 hours, but shorter variations such as 3-, 6-, 8-, 12- and 15-hour events are also held (sometimes concurrently with a 24-hour event). Depending on the terrain, experienced rogaining teams can cover more than over the 24-hour period. There have also been longer events (dubbed \\"Endurogaines\\") lasting 48 and 50 hours. In their native Australia, rogaines are usually held every month during weekends near full moons, with annual state championships and an annual national championship. They require dozens of volunteers to run, including course setters and caterers and are often attended by hundreds of participants. A competitive 24-hour rogaine requires a map area of around , for relatively flat terrain; terrain with significant climbs may require far less or far more area, depending on the placement of checkpoints. ==Variants== Rogaine control placed on a small knoll. While some controls can be relatively easy to spot, many require careful navigation to locate. Other forms of rogaining are popular, particularly in Australia during the months when normal rogaines are not held because of the weather. Popular variations include: * Metrogaine: An event of usually around six hours and held in predominantly urban areas. * Cyclogaine: Usually run for six hours in areas with trails suitable for mountainbiking. * Snogaine: Held in areas that are snowbound and participants may either snowshoe or ski to reach checkpoints. * Paddlogaine: A rogaine on a water covered area, such as a set of interconnected lakes. Participants can generally use any human-powered watercraft. * Motoorienteering: A rogaine with motorcycles. Event lasts 6h.

These securities are subordinated obligations, and fall at the very bottom of the operating insurance company's capital structure. They are issued primarily by mutual insurance companies, which are not public and owned instead by their policy holders. Surplus notes are debt- like in that they pay a coupon and have a finite maturity. However, in many cases, state insurance regulators have allowed insurance companies to classify the capital raised via surplus notes as “surplus” (which is the statutory equivalent of equity), because surplus note holders are last in line to make a claim on the company's assets in a default scenario, much like where equity holders reside in a public company. The motivation for mutual companies to issue these instruments was to raise surplus (or equity) in response to new risk-based capital guidelines developed in the early 1990s. Because mutual companies are owned by policyholders, not shareholders, there was no alternative method to raise surplus or equity. While surplus note holders have last claim on the assets of the operating insurance company, it is important to realize that this claim is at the operating company level, which is still ahead of holding company obligations. ==Further reading== *Laurent Condamin, Jean-Paul Louisot, Patrick Naïm.

In terms of rivers, Stapleton's nearest major river is the River Sence, but on a more local level, the River Tweed is the closest waterway, a tributary of which rises in the north of the village. The River Tweed's main source rises from Brick Kiln Hill, just north-east of Hinckley from where it flows north along the eastern edge of Barwell before turning west and continuing to travel in a north-easterly direction. The village is centred on St. Martins church (built in about 1300 according to Pevsner) which is to be found on Church Lane in the southern end of the village and was most probably established as a connection point for travellers journeying between Ashby-de-la-Zouch Castle and the areas around Coventry, Warwick and Kenilworth. The earliest known reference to the village appears in a charter from King of Mercia - Wiglaf to the Abbot of Crowland in Lincolnshire written in 833, making grants of \\"two ploughlands in Stapleton and Sutton\\". Stapleton is mentioned in the Domesday Book as having a population of five or six families and being owned by Hugh de Grandmesnil, who had been given most of West Leicester by William the Conqueror after the Conquest. There are very few historical incidents recorded around Stapleton, all except for one day in August 1485 when King Richard III arrived and camped at the Bradshaws just south of the village with his army in preparation for the momentous Battle of Bosworth Field. Present day Stapleton consists of several small residential roads centred on the junction of Dadlington Lane and Main Street (A447). These include Church Lane, Chapel Street, Beale's Close, St Martins, Manor Crescent, Green Lane, School Lane and Mill Close. There is no shop, there is the Nags Head Inn on Main Street.

Nicknamed Gâscanul (\\"The Gander\\") or Prințul din Trivale (\\"The Prince of Trivale\\"), he is considered one of Romania's greatest footballers. Renowned for his dribbling ability, Dobrin received the Romanian Footballer of the Year award on three occasions, in 1966, 1967, and 1971, and has a stadium in native Pitești named after him. ==Club career== Dobrin was born in Pitești, Argeș County, and he played for the first time in a First Division game when he was still 14, on 1 July 1962, in the match between Știința Cluj and Dinamo Pitești. He played for Argeș Pitești for 22 years, and only one year for another team, Târgoviște; Dobrin refused to play for any other First Division clubs, such as Dinamo Bucharest or Universitatea Craiova. Dobrin's contribution was essential to the 1979 Championship win for FC Argeș, when he scored in extra time to defeat Dinamo 4–3. Dobrin took the ball from the middle of the pitch, knocked off every player that tried to take the ball away from him and when he reached the penalty area he hit the ball so accurate that it went past the goalkeeper Aniței, hit the left post and entered the goal. The ball had a message attached to it from Dobrin to the Aniței. The message was:\\"Leave it there because there's nothing you can do about it.\\" This was just one of Dobrin's many ways of humiliating his opponents. Dobrin (left) with Ilie Balaci in 1988 During his whole career, Dobrin played 409 matches, scoring 111 goals in all. He was named Romanian Player of the Year in 1966, 1967 and 1971. He played his last game on 14 June 1983, when FC Argeș faced Bihor Oradea (the match ended 2–0 in favor of FC Argeș). In 2007, Dobrin was the technical director of FC Argeș. Dobrin is also known for famously missing out on a transfer to Real Madrid. After playing them in a European Cup game and scoring a goal, Santiago Bernabéu, their famous president was so impressed with Dobrin's skills that he wanted to transfer him to the Spanish team for a reported fee of $ 2 million, a huge amount of money for that time. Because of the communist regime in Romania in that period, Bernabéu had to hold talks with Nicolae Ceaușescu himself, but could not persuade him, because Dobrin was regarded as a \\"national treasure\\" and such values could not be \\"estranged\\", especially not playing in a team from the country of Francisco Franco's fascist dictatorship. It is said that this was the biggest regret of Dobrin's life, although he did eventually end up playing in Gento's testimonial, in the famous \\"blanco\\" shirt of Real Madrid. On this occasion Santiago Bernabéu made a last unsuccessful attempt to keep the Romanian player in Madrid. ==International career== Dobrin played 48 games for the Romanian national team, scoring six times, and contributed to Romania's qualification for the 1970 FIFA World Cup. However, he did not play in it even though he was in the finals squad. ==Death== Dobrin died on 26 October 2007 in the intensive care unit of the County Hospital in Piteşti. This came as a result of multiple organ failure, in turn caused by lung cancer. On 29 October 2007, his funeral ceremony, held at St. George's Cathedral and at St. George's Military Cemetery, was attended by more than 5,000 people (including Nicolae Dică and Adrian Neaga from Steaua Bucharest and Dănuț Coman from Rapid Bucharest who were coached by Dobrin in their youth years). ==Honours== ===Club=== Argeș Pitești *Divizia A: 1971–72, 1978–79 ===Individual=== *Romanian Footballer of the Year: 1966, 1967, 1971 ==References== ==External links== *Official website * * Category:1947 births Category:2007 deaths Category:Deaths from lung cancer Category:Deaths from cancer in Romania Category:Deaths from multiple organ failure Category:Sportspeople from Pitești Category:Romanian footballers Category:Association football midfielders Category:FC Argeș Pitești players Category:FCM Târgoviște players Category:Romania international footballers Category:1970 FIFA World Cup players Category:Romanian football managers Category:FC Argeș Pitești managers ","title":"Nicolae Dobrin"},{"id":"2546031","text":"Abraham Lincoln in May 1858 The House Divided Speech was an address given by Abraham Lincoln, later President of the United States, on June 16, 1858, at what was then the Illinois State Capitol in Springfield, after he had accepted the Illinois Republican Party's nomination as that state's US senator. The nomination of Lincoln was the final item of business at the convention, which then broke for dinner, meeting again at 8 PM. \\"The evening session was mainly devoted to speeches\\", but the only speaker was Lincoln, whose address closed the convention, save for resolutions of thanks to the city of Springfield and others. His address was immediately published in full by newspapers, as a pamphlet, and in the published Proceedings of the convention. It was the launching point of his unsuccessful campaign for the Senatorial seat held by Stephen A. Douglas; the campaign would climax with the Lincoln–Douglas debates. When Lincoln collected and published his debates with Douglas as part of his 1860 Presidential campaign, he prefixed them with relevant prior speeches. The \\"House Divided\\" speech opens the volume. Lincoln's remarks in Springfield depict the danger of slavery-based disunion, and it rallied Republicans across the North. Along with the Gettysburg Address and his Second Inaugural Address, the speech became one of the best-known of his career. It begins with the following words, which became the best-known passage of the speech: Lincoln's goals were to differentiate himself from Douglas — the incumbent — and to voice a prophecy publicly. Douglas had long advocated popular sovereignty, under which the settlers in each new territory would decide their own status as a slave or free state; he had repeatedly asserted that the proper application of popular sovereignty would prevent slavery- induced conflict and would allow Northern and Southern states to resume their peaceful coexistence. Lincoln, however, responded that the Dred Scott decision had closed the door on Douglas's preferred option, leaving the Union with only two remaining outcomes: the country would inevitably become either all slave or all free. Now that the North and the South had come to hold distinct opinions in the question of slavery, and now the issue had come to permeate every other political question, the Union would soon no longer be able to function. == Quotes == Reverse of 2009 Lincoln Penny, depicting him at what is now known as the Old State Capitol. Former Illinois House of Representatives chamber, the site of the speech. * \\"A house divided against itself cannot stand.\\" I believe this government cannot endure, permanently half slave and half free. I do not expect the Union to be dissolved—I do not expect the house to fall—but I do expect it will cease to be divided. It will become all one thing, or all the other. Either the opponents of slavery, will arrest the further spread of it, and place it where the public mind shall rest in the belief that it is in course of ultimate extinction; or its advocates will push it forward, till it shall become alike lawful in all the states, old as well as new—North as well as South. Have we no tendency to the latter condition? Let any one who doubts, carefully contemplate that now almost complete legal combination— piece of machinery so to speak—compounded of the Nebraska doctrine, and the Dred Scott decision. * The Kansas-Nebraska Act opened all the national territory to slavery .... This ... had been provided for ... in the notable argument of \\"squatter sovereignty,\\" otherwise called \\"sacred right of self government,\\" which latter phrase, though expressive of the only rightful basis of any government, was so perverted in this attempted use of it as to amount to just this: That if any one man, choose to enslave another, no third man shall be allowed to object. * While the Nebraska Bill was passing through Congress, a law case, involving the question of a negro's freedom ... was passing through the U.S. Circuit Court for the District of Missouri; and both Nebraska Bill and lawsuit were brought to a decision in the same month of May, 1854. The Negro's name was \\"Dred Scott\\" .... * [The points decided by the \\"Dred Scott\\" decision include] that whether the holding a negro in actual slavery in a free state, makes him free, as against the holder, the United States courts will not decide, but will leave to be decided by the courts of any slave state the negro may be forced into by the master. This point is made, not to be pressed immediately ... [that] the logical conclusion that what Dred Scott's master might lawfully do with Dred Scott, in the free state Illinois, every other master may lawfully do with any other one, or one thousand slaves, in Illinois, or in any other free state. * While the opinion of ... Chief Justice Taney, in the Dred Scott case ... expressly declare[s] that the Constitution of the United States neither permits congress nor a territorial legislature to exclude slavery from any United States territory, ... [Taney] omit[s] to declare whether or not the same constitution permits a state, or the people of a state, to exclude it. Possibly, this was a mere omission; but who can be quite sure .... The nearest approach to the point of declaring the power of a state over slavery, is made by Judge Nelson. He approaches it more than once, using the precise idea, and almost the language too, of the Nebraska Act. On one occasion his exact language is, \\"except in cases where the power is restrained by the Constitution of the United States, the law of the State is supreme over the subject of slavery within its jurisdiction.\\" In what cases the power of the states is so restrained by the U.S. Constitution, is left an open question, precisely as the same question, as to the restraint on the power of the territories was left open in the Nebraska Act. Put that and that together, and we have another nice little niche, which we may, ere long, see filled with another Supreme Court decision, declaring that the Constitution of the United States does not permit a state to exclude slavery from its limits. And this may especially be expected if the doctrine of \\"care not whether slavery be voted down or voted up\\" shall gain upon the public mind sufficiently to give promise that such a decision can be maintained when made. * Such a decision is all that slavery now lacks of being alike lawful in all the States. Welcome, or unwelcome, such decision is probably coming, and will soon be upon us, unless the power of the present political dynasty shall be met and overthrown. We shall lie down pleasantly dreaming that the people of Missouri are on the verge of making their State free, and we shall awake to the reality instead that the Supreme Court has made Illinois a slave state. ==Prior mentions of \\"a house divided\\"== Early Christians: * The expression \\"a house divided against itself\\" appears twice in the Bible. In the Gospel of Mark 3:25, Jesus states, \\"And if a house be divided against itself, that house cannot stand.\\" That is in response to the scribes' claim that \\"by the prince of the devils casteth he out devils.\\" In the Gospel of Matthew 12:25, \\"Jesus knew their thoughts, and said unto him, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand\\" (King James version). *Saint Augustine, in his Confessions (Book 8, Chapter 8) describes his conversion experience as being \\"a house divided against itself.\\" It also appears in widely-read English writers: * Thomas Hobbes, in his 1651 Leviathan (Chapter 18), states that \\"a kingdom divided in itself cannot stand.\\" * In Thomas Paine's 1776 Common Sense, he describes the composition of the English constitution \\"hath all the distinctions of a house divided against itself. ... \\" In the United States: *During the War of 1812 a line appeared in a letter from Abigail Adams to Mercy Otis Warren: \\"... A house divided upon itself - and upon that foundation do our enemies build their hopes of subduing us.\\"David Kennedy, Lizabeth Cohen, Thomas Bailey: The American Pageant: Volume I: To 1877, p. 253. *Felix Walker, in his speech for Buncombe, on the Missouri Compromise, said, \\"And we have the word of truth for it, that a house divided against itself cannot stand.\\"\\"Missouri Question: Speech of Mr. Walker, of N.C.\\" City of Washington Gazette, 5/11/1820, Vol. V, Iss. 759, p. [2]. *The \\"house divided\\" phrase had been used by Lincoln himself in another context in 1843.Address to the people of Illinois, in Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln, I, p. 315 *Famously, eight years before Lincoln's speech, during the Senate debate on the Compromise of 1850, Sam Houston had proclaimed: \\"A nation divided against itself cannot stand.\\" However and most relevantly, the expression was used repeatedly earlier in 1858 in discussions of the situation in Kansas, where slavery was the central issue. * It was used editorially in the Brooklyn Evening Star of January 8, the New York Daily Herald on January 12, and the Alton Weekly Telegraph of January 28. * It appeared, in quotation marks, in a letter to the editor published in The Liberator on April 23.

Concretely, given a finite abelian group G and a positive integer n, one asks for the smallest value of k such that every sequence of elements of G of size k contains n terms that sum to 0. The classic result in this area is the 1961 theorem of Paul Erdős, Abraham Ginzburg, and Abraham Ziv. They proved that for the group \\\\mathbb{Z}/n\\\\mathbb{Z} of integers modulo n, k = 2n - 1. Explicitly this says that any multiset of 2n − 1 integers has a subset of size n the sum of whose elements is a multiple of n, but that the same is not true of multisets of size 2n − 2. (Indeed, the lower bound is easy to see: the multiset containing n − 1 copies of 0 and n − 1 copies of 1 contains no n-subset summing to a multiple of n.) This result is known as the Erdős–Ginzburg–Ziv theorem after its discoverers. It may also be deduced from the Cauchy–Davenport theorem.Nathanson (1996) p.48 More general results than this theorem exist, such as Olson's theorem, Kemnitz's conjecture (proved by Christian Reiher in 2003.), and the weighted EGZ theorem (proved by David J.

The name derived from the words \\"Internet drive\\". ==History== Based in San Francisco, the company was founded in 1998 with seed investors and launched its first product, an online file storage service in August 1999. The idea originated from an early company Jeff Bonforte co-founded in 1996 called ShellServer.net, which provided 10 MB of space for IRC users. Bonforte compiled the founding team, which included Chris Lindland, Patrick Fenton, Tim Craycroft, Rich MacAlmon, John Reddig and Lou Perrelli (the last three were also the company's first angel investors). Originally presented as i-drive.com, the company acquired the domain idrive.com around October 1999. The initial product offered a limited amount of free file storage space, and later enhanced the offering with 'sideloading' – storing files such as MP3 files collected on the World Wide Web without the need for the user to download them to their individual computer. In January 2000, the company began offering unlimited storage space and an application called Filo. In 2001 the company transitioned from offering the free storage service and transformed the underlying software architecture into a middleware storage mechanism and product, seeking to sell into various markets including the 3G marketplace, targeting companies such as DoCoMo and Earthlink. In January 2002 the company name was changed to Anuvio Technologies. i-drive's assets were acquired by the EMC Corporation in 2002. Certain assets (including the idrive.com domain name) were acquired by Pro Softnet Corp which also offered online storage services. At its height, i-drive hosted over 10 million registered users, employed 110 people, and held partnerships with MP3.com, ZDnet.com, and 40 major universities. The service was rated as a \\"Top 5 Web Application\\" by CNET in 2000 and one of the \\"3 Top Technologies to Watch\\" by Fortune Magazine in 2000. The company raised over US$30 million from venture capitalists such as Draper Fisher Jurvetson, Information Technology Ventures, Global Retail Partners, Hikari (Japan), Philips (Netherlands), EMC, and Partners Group (Switzerland). ==References== *MP3.com and I-Drive.com Join Forces to Store and Manage MP3 Files Category:Online backup services Category:File hosting Category:Data synchronization Category:File sharing services Category:Cloud storage ","title":"I-drive"},{"id":"2546065","text":"Chromalveolata was a eukaryote supergroup present in a major classification of 2005, then regarded as one of the six major groups within the eukaryotes. It was a refinement of the kingdom Chromista, first proposed by Thomas Cavalier- Smith in 1981. Chromalveolata was proposed to represent the organisms descended from a single secondary endosymbiosis involving a red alga and a bikont. The plastids in these organisms are those that contain chlorophyll c. However, the monophyly of the Chromalveolata has been rejected. Thus, two papers published in 2008 have phylogenetic trees in which the chromalveolates are split up, and recent studies continue to support this view. ==Groups and classification== A Californian kelp forest. Historically, many chromalveolates were considered plants, because of their cell walls, photosynthetic ability, and in some cases their morphological resemblance to the land plants (Embryophyta). However, when the five-kingdom system (proposed in 1969) took prevalence over the animal–plant dichotomy, most of what we now call chromalveolates were put into the kingdom Protista, but the water molds and slime nets were put into the kingdom Fungi, while the brown algae stayed in the plant kingdom. These various organisms were later grouped together and given the name Chromalveolata by Cavalier-Smith. He believed them to be a monophyletic group, but this is not the case.Harper, J. T., Waanders, E. & Keeling, P. J. 2005. On the monophyly of chromalveolates using a six-protein phylogeny of eukaryotes. Int. J. System. Evol. Microbiol., 55, 487-496. In 2005, in a classification reflecting the consensus at the time, the Chromalveolata were regarded as one of the six major clades of eukaryotes. Although not given a formal taxonomic status in this classification, elsewhere the group had been treated as a Kingdom. The Chromalveolata were divided into four major subgroups: * Cryptophyta * Haptophyta * Stramenopiles (or Heterokontophyta) * Alveolata Other groups that may be included within, or related to, chromalveolates, are: *Centrohelids *Katablepharids *Telonemia Though several groups, such as the ciliates and the water molds, have lost the ability to photosynthesize, most are autotrophic. All photosynthetic chromalveolates use chlorophylls a and c, and many use accessory pigments. Chromalveolates share similar glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase proteins. However, as early as 2005, doubts were being expressed as to whether Chromalveolata was monophyletic, and a review in 2006 noted the lack of evidence for several of the supposed six major eukaryote groups, including the Chromalveolata. In 2012, consensus emerged that the group is not monophyletic. The four original subgroups fall into at least two categories: one comprises the Stramenopiles and the Alveolata, to which the Rhizaria are now usually added to form the SAR group; the other comprises the Cryptophyta and the Haptophyta. A 2010 paper splits the Cryptophyta and Haptophyta; the former are a sister group to the SAR group, the latter cluster with the Archaeplastida (plants in the broad sense). The katablepharids are closely related to the cryptophytes and the telonemids and centrohelids may be related to the haptophytes. A variety of names have been used for different combinations of the groups formerly thought to make up the Chromalveolata. * Halvaria Analyses in 2007 and 2008 agreed that the Stramenopiles and the Alveolata were related, forming a reduced chromalveolate clade, called Halvaria. * SAR group The Rhizaria, which were originally not considered to be chromalveolates, belong with the Stramenopiles and Alveolata in many analyses, forming the SAR group, i.e. Halvaria plus Rhizaria. * Hacrobia The other two groups originally included in Chromalveolata, the Haptophyta and the Cryptophyta, were related in some analyses, forming a clade which has been called Hacrobia. Alternatively, the Hacrobia appeared to be more closely related to the Archaeplastida (plants in the very broad sense), being a sister group in one analysis, and actually nested inside this group in another. (Earlier, Cavalier-Smith had suggested a clade called Corticata for the grouping of all the chromalveolates and the Archaeplastida.) More recently, as noted above, Hacrobia has been split, with the Haptophyta being sister to the SAR group and the Cryptophyta instead related to the Archaeplastida. ==Morphology== Chromalveolates, unlike other groups with multicellular representatives, do not have very many common morphological characteristics. Each major subgroup has certain unique features, including the alveoli of the Alveolata, the haptonema of the Haptophyta, the ejectisome of the Cryptophyta, and the two different flagella of the Heterokontophyta. However, none of these features are present in all of the groups. The only common chromalveolate features are these: *The shared origin of chloroplasts, as mentioned above *Presence of cellulose in most cell walls Since this is such a diverse group, it is difficult to summarize shared chromalveolate characteristics. ==Ecological role== A potato plant infected with Phytophthora infestans. Many chromalveolates affect our ecosystem in enormous ways. Some of these organisms can be very harmful. Dinoflagellates produce red tides, which can devastate fish populations and intoxicate oyster harvests. Apicomplexans are some of the most successful specific parasites to animals (including the genus Plasmodium, the malaria parasites). Water molds cause several plant diseases - it was the water mold Phytophthora infestans that caused the Irish potato blight that led to the Great Irish Famine. However, many others are vital members of our ecosystem. Diatoms are one of the major photosynthetic producers, and as such produce much of the oxygen that we breathe, and also take in much of the carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Brown algae, most specifically kelps, create underwater \\"forest\\" habitats for many marine creatures, and provide a large portion of the diet of coastal communities. Chromalveolates also provide many products that we use. The algin in brown algae is used as a food thickener, most famously in ice cream. The siliceous shells of diatoms have many uses, such as in reflective paint, in toothpaste, or as a filter, in what is known as diatomaceous earth. ==Chromalveolata viruses== Like other organisms, chromalveolata have viruses. In the case of Emiliania huxleyi (a common algal bloom chromalveolate), a virus believed to be specific to it causes mass death and the end of the bloom. ==See also== *Halvaria ==References== ==External links== * Tree of Life Eukaryotes Category:Algae Category:Obsolete eukaryote taxa Category:Bikont unranked clades ","title":"Chromalveolata"},{"id":"2546075","text":"Devils Back in Massachusetts, USA, is a very small and barren rock in the Atlantic Ocean located within the city limits of Boston.

At an early age his family moved to Brooklyn, New York. After two years, they moved to Cedar Rapids, Iowa, where McLaughlin finished high school. His parents returned to Canada, but he went on to study at Georgetown University in Washington, D. C., where he became involved in student plays. Adopting the stage name Willard Mack, after graduation he took minor acting jobs for a few years and did Shakespearian repertoire. However, writing scripts was what he was most interested in, and his second effort, about the North-West Mounted Police, In Wyoming, was a commercial success and was later the basis for his film Nanette of the Wilds. Throughout his life, Mack frequently returned to Canada. Some of his other plays, including Tiger Rose and The Scarlet Fox, were set in northern Alberta. In 1914 he made his acting debut on Broadway in a play he had written. Over the next fourteen years, he would write a further twenty-two Broadway productions, acting in ten of them and producing four. For a time, Willard Mack operated a stock company with actress Maude Leone. In the mid 1920s, he met an aspiring stage actress named Ruby Stevens hired as a chorus girl for his new play. Mack coached Stevens's acting and rewrote parts of the play to expand her role and then persuaded her to change her name to Barbara Stanwyck. During his time on Broadway, Mack began writing for motion pictures, and although he performed in fifteen films and directed four, he was primarily a writer. At first he remained on the east coast but later moved to Los Angeles. A number of his plays were made into motion pictures, and between 1916 and 1953 he was involved with the writing of more than seventy film scripts. Starting out in silent film, he made his talkie debut as actor, director, and co-writer of the 1929 film Voice of the City. In 1933 he directed What Price Innocence?. He then wrote and directed Broadway to Hollywood, a backstage musical that spanned nearly five decades recounting the struggles of a vaudeville family. He was married four times, to actresses Maude Leone, Marjorie Rambeau, Pauline Frederick, and Beatrice Banyard. His writing success made him a wealthy man. He died from heart disease at his homehttps://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/10995316 in Brentwood, Los Angeles, California in 1934.

The area is part of the greater Boundary Waters region along the border of Minnesota and the Canadian province of Ontario, a historic and important thoroughfare in the fur trading and exploring days of New France and British North America. Under the administration of the United States Forest Service, the Superior National Forest comprises over 3,900,000 acres (6,100 mi2 or 16,000 km2) of woods and waters. The majority of the forest is multiple-use, including both logging and recreational activities such as camping, boating, and fishing. Slightly over a quarter of the forest is set aside as a wilderness reserve known as the Boundary Waters Canoe Area (BWCA), where canoers can travel along interconnected fresh waters near land as well as over historic portages once used by Native American tribes and First Nations people, but later by European explorers and traders. ==Location== The forest is located in Cook, Lake, and Saint Louis counties in northeastern Minnesota. Forest headquarters are located in Duluth, Minnesota, outside the boundaries of the forest. There are local ranger district offices in Aurora, Cook, Ely, Grand Marais, and Tofte.USFS Ranger Districts by State ==Landforms== The forest covers 3.9 million acres (6,100 mi2 or 16,000 km2), and has over 445,000 acres (1,800 km2) of water. Its waters include some 2,000 lakes and rivers, more than 1,300 miles (2,100 km) of cold water streams, and 950 miles (1,530 km) of warm water streams. Many of the lakes are located in depressions formed by the differential erosion of tilted layers of bedded rock; these depressions were given their final form by glacial scouring during recent ice ages. The forest is located on part of the Canadian Shield. The area is on a low plateau which is part of the Superior Upland. High points include the Sawtooth Mountains, a range of hills along the shore of Lake Superior, the Misquah Hills including Eagle Mountain, the state's highest point, and other uplands along the Laurentian Divide separating the watershed of the Great Lakes and Atlantic Ocean from that of Hudson Bay and the Arctic Ocean. Despite the presence of dramatic cliffs and other local differences in elevation, the area is essentially flat, as it is part of an old peneplain eroded by weathering, water, and especially glaciers. The principal surficial result of recent glaciation is not the deposition of glacial drift (unlike most of the rest of Minnesota), but the remodeling of the landscape by the scraping away of softer surfaces down to bare hard rock. The land therefore is raw, with many outcroppings of ancient bedrock, overlain in places by thin layers of gravelly soil and, in the west, silts deposited by Glacial Lake Agassiz. Eagle Mountain, the highest natural point in Minnesota at 2,301 feet (701 m) is located in the Superior National Forest. ==Life forms== ===Flora=== The forest contains a small slice of true boreal forest (taiga), and a mixed conifer-hardwood forest known as the North Woods, a transition province between the northern boreal forest and deciduous forests to the south. (archive of original) Conifers include several varieties of pine, fir, and spruce trees, principal deciduous species are mountain ash, maple, aspen, oak, and paper birch are also common.. Characteristic aquatic plants include water lilies and wild rice. ===Fauna=== Fish species such as walleye, northern pike, smallmouth bass, lake trout, brook trout, rainbow trout, and brown trout can be found in abundance in the forest's waters. Larger wildlife species include white-tailed deer, moose, Canadian lynx, black bear, and wolf packs. Northern Minnesota has the largest population of gray wolves in the lower 48 states, with approximately 300-400 wolves within the boundaries of this forest. Ely's International Wolf Center protects all North American gray wolves from extinction. Located at the northern edge of the range of the hummingbird and near the southern edge of the range of the Canada jay, this forest has 163 nesting species of birds, the largest number of any national forest. Species include the bald eagle and other raptors, the ubiquitous common loon, and northern waterfowl. ==Recreation== The Superior National Forest maintains developed fee campgrounds with amenities like drinking water and garbage disposal, rustic campgrounds without drinking water or fees, and backcountry campsites with only a pit latrine and a fire grate, and no permits or fees.Camping, Forest Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture Additionally, dispersed camping is permitted anywhere on undeveloped public land without permit or fee.

(17 January 1929 – 6 July 2003) was a Venezuelan prelate of the Catholic Church who served as the Archbishop of Caracas from 27 May 1995 until his death. Velasco was born on 17 January 1929 in Acarigua, Venezuela. He was ordained a priest on 17 December 1955. On 23 October 1989, Pope John Paul II named him Apostolic Vicar of Puerto Ayacucho and titular bishop of Utimmira. He received his episcopal consecration on 27 January 1990. John Paul named him Archbishop of Caracas on 27 May 1994 and Velasco was installed there on 14 July. He made Velasco a cardinal on 21 February 2001 and assigned him as Cardinal-Priest to the titular church of Santa Maria Domenica Mazzarello. Velasco was known for his criticisms of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez. In 2001 he appealed to the government to take attacks on Catholic churches more seriously. After Chavez repeatedly attacked the Church, Velasco said: \\"Every day I turn another cheek. I have no cheeks left because every day there is a new insult.\\" During the 2002 Venezuelan coup d'état attempt, Velasco attended the swearing in of Chavez' replacement, signed the Carmona Decree that disestablished the Chavez regime, and visited Chavez in exile in Orchila. Velasco later disassociated himself from the coup and his role remains unclear, combining an attempt to get Chavez to resign, an effort to protect Chavez' life, and doubts about the leadership of the short-lived coup. His personal antagonistic relationship with Chavez divided the conservative Church hierarchy from clergy who supported the radical social programs of the Chavez government. Velasco died on 6 July 2003 after a long illness and treatment in Spain for cancer. After Velasco's death, Chávez drew fire for his controversial statement that the Cardinal was \\"burning in hell\\". ==References== ==External links== *Catholic Hierarchy Category:Venezuelan cardinals Category:20th-century Roman Catholic archbishops Category:21st-century Roman Catholic archbishops Category:Venezuelan Roman Catholic archbishops Category:People from Acarigua Category:1929 births Category:2003 deaths Category:Salesians of Don Bosco Category:Cardinals created by Pope John Paul II Category:Roman Catholic archbishops of Caracas Category:Salesian cardinals ","title":"Ignacio Velasco"},{"id":"2546125","text":"Sector is an unincorporated community in Hampshire County in the U.S. state of West Virginia.

A suspension bridge once connected the two communities via Fleming-Sector Road, but this was repeatedly demolished by a succession of serious floods, most recently in the late 1930s or early 1940s after which it was not rebuilt. == References == Category:Unincorporated communities in Hampshire County, West Virginia Category:Populated places on the South Branch Potomac River Category:Unincorporated communities in West Virginia Category:South Branch Valley Railroad ","title":"Sector, West Virginia"},{"id":"2546131","text":"El Palmillo is a Mesoamerican Classic Period archaeological site located in the Valley of Oaxaca, associated with the pre-Columbian Zapotec civilization which was centered in the valley and the surrounding highlands of the present- day state of Oaxaca, Mexico.

Thomas was born to Benjamin and Sarah (Harrison) Bullitt in 1730 in Prince William County, Province of Virginia. He became active in the militia when young, and became interested in western exploration and development. By 1754 he was a Captain in the County's militia, and participated in a number of attempts to secure western Virginia and Pennsylvania from the French. ==French and Indian War== Captain Bullitt led part his company with Colonel Washington's expedition in 1754 that ended with defeat in the Battle of Great Meadows. The next year he again marched against Fort Duquesne, this time with the Braddock Expedition, and again they failed at the Battle of Monogahela on July 9, 1755. The third try in 1758 also started badly, but ended in success. Bullitt led a militia company in the Forbes Expedition. In September he was part of the large advance party of regulars and militia commanded by Major James Grant. After Grant refused advice on wilderness fighting, his party was ambushed by the French and their Indian allies on September 21, 1758. They took heavy losses and Grant was captured. Bullitt took to the woods, but rallied the militia, and counterattacked their pursuers. He then led more than half of the original party back to their main force. The French were forced to abandon the fort in November. ==After the war== Bullitt kept his interest in the frontier. He began to speculate in land and invest in development. When a number of his militia company exercised their land grant bounties in what would become Bath County, Virginia, he bought land there and built an Inn at Hot Springs in 1766. Over the next few years his guests included Thomas Jefferson and George Washington. During the war, Andrew Lewis and Thomas Bullitt had surveyed part of the area and had heard stories from the Native Americans and colonists about the healing powers of the springs. In 1764, Captain Thomas Bullitt received a colonial land grant of 300 acres which contained seven hot and warm springs. \\"After receiving the award, Captain Bullitt moved his militia company and their families to the area. The land was cleared, and within two years, a wooden 18 room wooden hotel was constructed there, and in 1766 the \\"Homestead\\" was opened and named in honor of the homesteaders who built the resort and bathhouses.\\" The Omni Homestead Resort, as it is called today, continued to be operated by Thomas Bullitt's family after his death during the Revolution, until 1832, when it was sold to Dr. Thomas Goode (physician), who also purchased the Healing Springs, Virginia and the resort at Warm Springs, Virginia.\\"A Brief History of the Omni Homestead.\\" 2015. The Omni Homestead 250 Years. \\"America's First Resort.\\" 2 pages. He also continued his militia service, and at the war's end in 1763 he became adjutant general of the state militia, a post that he held through the early days of the Revolutionary War. ===Surveying Kentucky=== By 1773, Virginia was still searching for land to satisfy grants and bounties, and was still struggling with the details of the Proclamation of 1763. Settlers were pushing west into Kentucky, even without colonial authorization or control. In an effort to bring some order to the situation, Governor Dunmore, authorized Captain Bullitt to organize a party to survey northern and eastern Kentucky. Bullitt gathered about 40 men and set out from the Kanawha River Valley and generally followed the along the south side of the Valley of the Ohio. He made some excursions from his direct path, going as far north as Chillicothe to speak with Chief Cornstalk of the Shawnee. By July his party had reached the Falls of the Ohio, and Bullitt laid out a town site there that later became Louisville, Kentucky. Bullitt and his men tried to maintain peaceful relations with the Indians, but did lose one work party in an attack. The incursion was also one of the Indian complaints that caused Lord Dunmore's War the following year. As a reward for his service on this expedition and in the French and Indian War, Bullitt was granted in the newly surveyed territory. He chose a site he believed best for early development, in what is today downtown Charleston, West Virginia. ==The Revolutionary War== Bullitt still held the post of Adjutant General for the Virginia militia. As the Revolution became imminent his sympathies lay firmly in the rebel cause. When Governor Dunmore made his last stand in 1775, Captain Bullitt was a part of the forces that assembled for the Battle of Great Bridge. He took charge of engineering works for Colonel William Woodford who had overall command. His rapidly constructed defenses aided in the overwhelming American victory on December 9, 1775. Dunmore fell back into Norfolk, but was forced to abandon that as well when Bullitt began the construction of siege trenches and works. By the end of December, Virginia had no British forces on her land, and Bullitt was promoted to Colonel. Thomas Bullitt was elected several times to the House of Delegates (legislature) of the newly formed Virginia government. But he did not usually attend their meetings. He made an exception in November and December 1777 to help George Rogers Clark promote his plans for a western campaign. The delegates made Clark a Lieutenant Colonel and authorized him to defend the western frontiers. A second, and secret, set of orders allowed him to invade the Illinois Country. These were known only to Bullitt, Patrick Henry, Thomas Jefferson, George Mason and George Wythe. ==Death and Will== Bullitt died at his home in Fauquier County, Va., in February, 1778, at the comparatively early age of forty-eight years. His will, dated September 17, 1775, was probated February 23, 1778 (Will Book I, p. 321, Fauquier County). In his will, he left 400 acres and an annual allowance for support to his illegitimate daughter, Sarah Elizabeth Brounaunt, or Bronaugh, and most of the balance of his estate to his brother, Judge Cuthbert Bullitt.Estelle & King Abstracts of Wills, Administrations, and Marriages of Fauquier County, Virginia, 1759-1800: With Cemetery Inscriptions, Rent Rolls, and Other Data, by Junie Estelle and Stewart King; Genealogical Publishing Company; 1978, p. 12. ==Further reading== * ==References== Category:1734 births Category:1782 deaths Category:American surveyors Category:People of Virginia in the French and Indian War Category:History of Louisville, Kentucky Category:Virginia colonial people Category:Virginia militiamen in the American Revolution Thomas Category:People of pre-statehood Kentucky Category:People from Warm Springs, Virginia ","title":"Thomas Bullitt"},{"id":"2546158","text":"Grandma Prisbrey's Bottle Village, also known as Bottle Village, is an art environment, located in Simi Valley, California. It was created by Tressa \\"Grandma\\" Prisbrey (1896–1988) from the 1950s to the 1970s. Prisbey built a \\"village\\" of shrines, walkways, sculptures, and buildings from recycled items and discards from the local landfill. Bottle Village has been designated as a historical landmark by the City of Simi Valley, County of Ventura, and State of California (California Historical Landmark No. 939. It was also listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996. Bottle Village closed in 1984 and was severely damaged during the 1994 Northridge earthquake. ==Tressa \\"Grandma\\" Prisbrey== Tressa Luella Schaefer was born in Easton, Minnesota in 1896. She attended school until the age of twelve and studied mostly politics in North Dakota. At the age of 15, Prisbrey married the ex-husband of her sister, Theodore Grinolds who was 37 years her senior (52 years old). The marriage with Theodore only lasted 14 years and within those years she bore seven children. After Theodore's passing at age 72, Prisbrey and her seven children moved up to Seattle where she married an unnamed and unemployed man. Their marriage was very short lived. Over the course of her life, she had witnessed the passing of six out of her seven children (4 boys, 2 girls). In 1946, Prisbrey made the move to Santa Susana, now a neighborhood in Simi Valley, California. Ten years after the move, Prisbrey met her husband, Al Prisbrey who bought one-third of an acre located on Cochran Street. They brought in a trailer to live in, removed the tires, and hid them in an effort to stay grounded on the lot. When Prisbrey first moved to Santa Susana, she had a large collection of 17,000 pencils which had previously been her hobby. In an effort to find a place to put them, she decided she wanted to make a house for her pencils to stay. At the age of 60, she began looking around to buy cinder-blocks to build with but came to discover the prices were way out of her range. They had spent all their money paying for the property so she resorted to visiting a local dump where she found thousands of colored bottles. She began going to her sister, Hattie's house and made cement by hand and built her first bottle house. Prisbrey mentioned she did not begin this project to gain attention but as an outpost as well as a place to keep all of her things. She was interested in the fact that everything has a purpose and is special and unique and that is exactly what she brings to bottle village. Not just in the visuals but the overall feeling you receive from being present. The Village was very much established by 1961 but Prisbrey kept adding structures and tweaking into the 1980s. She moved away in 1972, but later came back to live in a trailer alongside the village where she continued adding sculptures and flower planters. In 1982 Prisbrey, in poor health, left Simi Valley to live with her daughter and son-in-law in San Francisco. In July 1986 the property was gift deeded to the Preserve Bottle Village committee. In October 1988, Prisbrey died from complications of a stroke at a convalescent hospital in San Francisco. ==Bottle Village== After starting with a wall, she continued to build until she had constructed 16 buildings and structures made of glass and assorted other materials, a mosaic sidewalk, the Leaning Tower of Bottle Village, the Dolls Head Shrine, Cleopatra's Bedroom, the Round House, and more. The Los Angeles Times described Bottle Village as an \\"eccentric folk-art wonderland.\\" Bottle Village is seen by art historians and folklorists as a complex work combining the desires of an elderly lady to provide simple shelter for her valued personal collections; memorialize family, friends, and important life events; grieve over the loss of family members; entertain visitors; and leave behind a testament to her very personal vision, exuberance, and inspiration. Bottle Village is a significant folk art environment created by an American folk artist of high acclaim. It is a rarity created out of actual mass consumer throwaway from everyday lives of Americans of the late 1950s and early 1960s. When building Bottle Village, no help was given and everything is made from hand and all recycled materials. One of the shrines is called The Headlight Garden. This garden was made for her then 35-year-old daughter who had been diagnosed with cancer. Her daughter loved flowers so Prisbrey decided to make her a rose garden made out of headlights and recycled materials. Before her daughter's passing, she would love to wake up every morning and sit by the garden in silence. According to Prisbrey, the day her daughter died, the roses died. There are heart, diamond, and spade stepping stones that symbolize when Prisbrey visited Las Vegas, Nevada. She made the forms out of cement but then filled them with random recycled things like scissors. Bottle Village also has wishing wells made from tiles, ground is paved with recyclables, a doll shrine, and a leaning tower of bottles. Each building has its own theme. A doll house was built to house Prisbrey's doll collection which held 600 dolls. Prisbrey mentioned every day she would go into that house and dress up some of the dolls. \\"Anyone can do something with a million dollars. Look at Disney,\\" Prisbrey once said. \\"But it takes more than money to make something out of nothing, and look at the fun I have doing it.\\" When visitors would come to Bottle Village when Prisbrey was still alive, she would first take them on a tour but then end in her meditation room where she would allow them to meditate as well as listen to her sing different songs. She would charge only 75 cents a visit but people would frequently give her more. ==Earthquake and funding== The 1994 Northridge earthquake struck eight miles away and badly damaged the Village. Because of the severe damage, the Preserve Bottle Village committee applied for Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) funding, receiving almost US$500,000. In 1997, when it appeared FEMA would award a $455,000 grant to help repair the village after the earthquake, the grant was lost after former Councilwoman Sandi Webb and U.S. Rep. Elton Gallegly, R-Simi Valley, opposed it. Gallegly called it a waste of taxpayers' money. Also, James Lee Witt, the director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, said his organization had determined that the site was not eligible for Federal disaster relief money because it had not been open to the general public since 1984. The Simi Valley Historical Society and Rancho Simi Recreation and Park District allocated about $150,000 to restore an apricot pitting shed. The City of Simi Valley also contributed at least $24,000 through Community Development Block Grant funds to restore the 1920s wood shed with concrete pillars, a remnant of the area's apricot industry. Ever since the 1994 Northridge earthquake, Bottle Village has been in need of support and funding. The late artist Joanne Johnson wrote that the “crumbling Bottle Village is an ironic paradox – built from castoffs, now cast aside,\\" who was one of the docents, on the board of directions and served for some time as the president on the board. This piece of Folk Art is the definition of the saying “one man's treasure is another man's junk,” because of the disrepair the site is in now, there is very little activity. There are very few people who can still give scheduled tours of the village so personal tours are difficult to book but there are monthly private tours people can sign up to attend at www.bottlevillage.com. Preserve Bottle village continues preservation efforts, speaking with private foundations. It has received a few generous grants in the past 15 years, from the Larry Janss – School of the Pacific Islands Foundation ($21,000), the Rothschild Foundation ($15,000), and the Gareth Evans - Golden Rule Foundation ($10,000 + $5,000). Bottle Village is a nonprofit group that owns and oversees the property. ==In popular culture== The Doll Head Shrine has created a cult following and was reproduced on the cover of Wall of Voodoo’s chart-topping single \\"Mexican Radio\\" in 1982. The Village inspired a 32-page children's book Bottle Houses: The Creative World of Grandma Prisbrey by Melissa Eskridge Slaymaker. She is commemorated every year during Halloween at the Simi Valley Strathearn Park Ghost Tour, which tells the history of Simi Valley.http://www.simihistory.com ==Exhibitions== 1974–1976 \\"Naives and Visionaries\\", sponsored by the National Endowment for the Arts and the Walker Art Center, Minneapolis, MN 1975 \\"America Now\\", sponsored by the U.S. Information Agency (traveling European exhibition) 1976 \\"Grandma Prisbrey\\", Woman's Building, Los Angeles, CA (solo exhibition) 1977 \\"In Celebration of Ourselves\\", Museum of Modern Art, San Francisco, CA 1979–1981 \\"A Look at the Art of the 70's\\", sponsored by the International Communication Agency (traveling exhibition) 1984 \\"Visions of Paradise\\", Beyond Baroque, Venice, CA \\"Bits and Pieces: The Dream-builders of California\\", Chevron Art Gallery, San Francisco, CA 1985 \\"Divine Disorder: Folk Art Environments of California\\", Triton Museum of Art, Santa Clara, CA (traveling exhibition) 1985–1986 \\"A Time to Reap\\", Co-sponsored by Seton Hall Univ.

He attended Moscow University under Fedor Buslaev from 1861 to 1865. After graduation he taught in the Moscow Art School. In 1870 he became a lecturer in the University of Novorossia, Odessa (now Odessa National University, Ukraine), and in 1877 a professor there. From 1888 he taught in St. Petersburg University. From 1893 he was a member of the Russian Academy of Fine Arts, and from 1898 a member of the Russian Academy of Sciences. In 1895 with Fyodor Uspensky he founded the Russian Archaeological Institute of Constantinople. During the Revolution of 1917 and the Civil War in Russia Kondakov lived in Odessa and Yalta. In 1920 he emigrated to Bulgaria, and then to Czechoslovakia, where he taught in Prague University until his death in 1925. In his first book, on Greek manuscript illumination, published in 1877, Kondakov approached stylistic evolution of eastern Romanesque art through the use of artistic ideal. He collaborated with Salomon Reinach in Antiquités de la Russie Méridionale (1891). His lectures influenced future historians, among others, Michael Rostovtzeff. Kondakov wrote numerous works on the history of Ancient Greek, Russian, Georgian and Eastern Roman art. He founded modern method in the history of the art of the Eastern Roman Empire. ==Further reading== *Klejn, Leo.

Helicopter parents are so named because, like helicopters, they \\"hover overhead\\", overseeing every aspect of their child's life constantly. A helicopter parent is also known to strictly supervise their children in all aspects of their lives, including in social interactions.Siste, Kristiana, et al. \\"Gaming Disorder and Parenting Style: A Case Series.\\" Addictive Disorders & Their Treatment 19.3 (2020): 185-190.

Foster Cline and Jim Fay coined the term \\"helicopter parent\\" in 1990.Cline and Fay. Parenting with Love and Logic: Teaching Children Responsibility. 1990. 23-25. As quoted by Julie Lythcott-Haims in How to Raise an Adult: Break Free of the Overparenting Trap and Prepare Your Kid for Success. 2015. 4. The term \\"helicopter parent\\" gained wide currency when American college administrators began using it in the early 2000s as the oldest Millennials began reaching college age. Their baby-boomer parents earned notoriety for practices such as calling their children each morning to wake them up for class and complaining to their professors about grades the children had received. Summer camp officials have also reported similar behavior from these parents. ==Roots== The Chronicle of Higher Education reported that helicopter parents continued advocating for their adult children at the graduate school level as well, such as advocating for their adult child's admission to law school or business school. As this cohort entered the workforce, Human Resource officials reported helicopter parents showing up in the workplace or phoning managers to advocate on their adult child's behalf or to negotiate salaries for their adult children. Generational demographer Neil Howe describes helicopter parenting as the parenting style of Baby Boomer parents of Millennial children. Howe describes the helicopter parenting of baby-boomers as a distinct parenting style from Generation X parents. He describes the latter as \\"stealth-fighter parents\\" due to a tendency of Gen X parents to let minor issues go, while striking without warning and vigorously in the event of serious issues. Howe contrasts this to the sustained participation of Boomer parents of Millennials in the educational setting, describing these parents as \\"sometimes helpful, sometimes annoying, yet always hovering over their children and making noise.\\" Howe describes baby boomers as incredibly close to their children, saying that in his opinion, this is a good thing. Helicopter parents attempt to \\"ensure their children are on a path to success by paving it for them.\\" The rise of helicopter parenting coincided with two social shifts. The first was the comparatively booming economy of the 1990s, with low unemployment and higher disposable income. The second was the public perception of increased child endangerment, a perception which free-range parenting advocate Lenore Skenazy described as \\"rooted in paranoia\\". Helicopter parenting is on occasion associated with societal or cultural norms which furnish or standardize themes related to vicariousness.Somers, Patricia, and Jim Settle. \\"The helicopter parent: Research toward a typology.\\" College and University 86.1 (2010): 18. ===China=== Tianjin University has been building \\"love tents\\" to accommodate parents who have traveled there with their matriculating freshmen, letting them sleep on mats laid out on the gym floor. Commentators on social media have argued that the one-child policy has been an aggravating factor in the rise of helicopter parenting (see Little Emperor Syndrome). ==Literature== Madeline Levine has written on helicopter parenting. Judith Warner recounts Levine's descriptions of parents who are physically \\"hyper-present\\" but psychologically absent. Katie Roiphe, commenting on Levine's work in Slate elaborates on myths about helicopter parenting: \\"[I]t is about too much presence, but it's also about the wrong kind of presence. In fact, it can be reasonably read by children as absence, as not caring about what is really going on with them ... As Levine points out, it is the confusion of overinvolvement with stability.\\" Similarly, she reminds readers that helicopter parenting is not the product of \\"bad or pathetic people with deranged values ... It is not necessarily a sign of parents who are ridiculous or unhappy or nastily controlling. It can be a product of good intentions gone awry, the play of culture on natural parental fears.\\" The Chinese parenting style depicted in the book Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother has been compared to western helicopter parenting. Nancy Gibbs writing for Time magazine described them both as \\"extreme parenting\\", although she noted key differences between the two. Gibbs describes Tiger Mothers as focused on success in precision-oriented fields such as music and math, while helicopter parents are \\"obsessed with failure and preventing it at all costs\\". Another difference she described was the Tiger Mother's emphasis on hard work with parents adopting an \\"extreme, rigid and authoritarian approach\\" toward their children, which she contrasts to western helicopter parents who she says \\"enshrine their children and crave their friendship\\". Former Stanford dean Julie Lythcott-Haims, drawing from her experiences seeing students come in academically prepared but not prepared to fend for themselves, wrote a book called How to Raise an Adult: Break Free of the Overparenting Trap and Prepare Your Kid for Success in which she urges parents to avoid \\"overhelping\\" their children. ==Effects== University of Georgia professor Richard Mullendore described the rise of the cell phone as a contributing factor for helicopter parenting—having called cell phones \\"the world's longest umbilical cord\\".Briggs, Sarah; Confessions of a 'Helicopter Parent' (PDF), retrieved May 1, 2006 Some parents, for their part, point to rising college tuition costs, saying they are just protecting their investment or acting like any other consumer. Inter-generational research published in \\"The Gerontologist\\" observed educators and popular media lament helicopter parents who hover over their grown children, but reported \\"complex economic and social demands make it difficult for the Baby Boomers’ children to gain a foothold in adulthood.\\" Clare Ashton-James, in a cross-national survey of parents, concluded \\"helicopter parents\\" reported higher levels of happiness. Some studies suggest overprotective, overbearing, or over-controlling parents cause long-term mental health problems for their offspring. The description of these mental health problems may be lifelong and its impact comparable in scale to individuals who have suffered bereavement, according to the University College London. According to the Medical Research Council \\"psychological control can limit a child’s independence and leave them less able to regulate their own behaviour\\". According to a 2019 national poll on children’s health by the C.S. Mott Children’s Hospital at the University of Michigan, one-quarter of parents surveyed say they are the main barrier to their teen’s independence by not taking the time or effort to give their teen more responsibility. The national survey of nearly 900 parents found most of those with kids between 14 and 18 who conceded to helicoptering said they did it because it was just easier to do things themselves. Although parents or proponents of helicopter parenting claim that such a restrictive and imposing parenting style may instill discipline, other analysts have claimed that there is evidence that such forms of parenting results in teenage rebellion, and may even extend into a vicenarian rebellion.Wallace, Michael, et al. \\"Over-involved parenting and competition in youth development programs.\\" (2015).

Primarily an enemy of Daredevil, he is also an enemy of the Punisher and Wolverine. ==Publication history== Created by Ann Nocenti and Rick Leonardi, the character made his first appearance in Daredevil #248 (November 1987). ==Fictional character biography== Originally a priest, Carl Burbank abandoned his vows following the drug-related deaths of young parishioners. He joined the C.I.A., which outfitted him with a cybernetic arm and made him an assassin under the codename \\"Bushwacker\\", but ultimately he became a freelancer. At some point, an event took place that compelled Bushwacker to begin a war against all mutants. Bushwacker began hunting and assassinating mutants, most often those mutants whose abilities Bushwacker perceived as making them especially talented in \\"the arts\\". Bushwacker also claimed that he was paid large sums of money to kill mutants, but this has yet to be verified. Wolverine learned of Bushwacker's activities and began to hunt the killer. At the same time, Bushwacker's wife Marilyn believed her husband was insane and needed to be placed in a hospital. She sought aid from lawyer Matt Murdock (secretly the hero Daredevil). Bushwacker was tracked down and defeated by the two heroes, which left the right side of his face horribly scarred, and he was placed in police custody.Daredevil #249 (December 1987) Later, Bushwacker joined with Typhoid Mary and other enemies of Daredevil in a plan to kill their common foe. After the completion of the plan, Bushwacker was left to his own activities.Daredevil #259-260 (October–November 1988) Entering the Kingpin's employ, Burbank attacked the Punisher, but was left for dead. It was during this time that his wife finally left him.The Punisher War Journal #12-13 (December 1989 – January 1990) He reappeared in the employ of drug lord Nick Lambert, who hired Bushwacker to kill reporter Ben Urich, who was about to run a story of his illegal activities. Instead, when Bushwacker learned the truth, he allowed Urich to live and to complete the exposé. However, the drug lord managed to bribe himself out of jail. Bushwacker then killed him.Daredevil Annual #5 (1989) Bushwacker was later freed by Deathlok from captivity by Mecha Doom.Deathlok #5 (November 1991) Subsequent activities brought him into conflict with Daredevil, Nomad, the Punisher, Boomerang, and Elektra. His clash with Nomad was over the life of a baby that Nomad had taken under his care whom Bushwacker believed to be the daughter of Troy Donohue, Burbank's ex-brother-in-law (she was in the fact the daughter of Nomad's foe, the drug lord Umberto Saffilios and a teenaged prostitute). Bushwacker hoped that his wife would approve of his \\"rescue\\" and welcome him back into her life.Nomad #4-5 (August–September 1992) Imprisoned in the super-villain holding facility the Raft, Burbank escaped during the mass breakout engineered by Electro. Burbank was subsequently employed by the Jackal to kill the Punisher, but was defeated once again by Daredevil.Daredevil vs. Punisher #3 (October 2005) Following this, Bushwacker created a disturbance in downtown Manhattan and took a woman hostage to lure the Punisher out of hiding and kill him. The Punisher showed up as expected. As it turns out, G.W. Bridge arranged the incident in Times Square with Bushwacker to ambush and capture The Punisher. Although complications arose by an on-site NYPD officer the incident fell through, the Punisher escaped, and Bushwacker was defeated by S.H.I.E.L.D. operative G. W. Bridge and put back in jail.Punisher War Journal vol. 2, #5 (May 2007) The Hood has hired him as part of his criminal organization to take advantage of the split in the superhero community caused by the Superhuman Registration Act.

On top of this he has been altered bionically so that his hands can function as a gun, sword or other such armament he can think of.Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z Vol 1 #2 Burbank can fire bullets from his index finger as if his hand were a pistol. With a thought, he can alter the configuration of his right or left arm, allowing either to function in several modes that replicate the effects of a number of weapons. Including a machine gun, shotgun or even energy based cannonry. He employs powerful gadgets and weapons, most notably a flamethrower, all of which can be created by the mechanical prostheses that have replaced his forearms. He manages to load the weapons by swallowing ammo, such as bullets or flamethrower fuel. There are some versions that take this a step further, having Bushwacker be able to use highly concussive energy weaponry (very similar to that of Iron Man or War Machine),Punisher War Journal Vol 2 #5 and even be able to morph his arm into blades as a last resort. Bushwacker's skin can liquefy to seal wounds,Nomad Vol 2 #5 he even boasts a kind of healing ability that can seemingly revive him even from fatal injury.X-Force: Sex and Violence #2 In the Daredevil vs. Punisher miniseries, it was implied that his powers are actually a natural mutation, making the assassin himself one of the mutants he hates so much.Daredevil vs. Punisher #3 However, this is contradicted by his other appearances which identify the origins of his powers as cybernetics. Bushwacker has been trained in CIA hand-to-hand combat techniques, and is trained in infiltration and assassination. He also has familiarity with the workings of international intelligence agencies and their methods. ==Other versions== ===House of M=== Bushwacker appeared in the House of M reality spin-off House of M: Masters of Evil.House of M: Masters of Evil #1-4 (October 2009 – January 2010) ==In other media== ===Video games=== * In the 1993 The Punisher arcade game, Bushwacker is working for the Kingpin. * Bushwacker is a boss in the 2004 video game The Punisher, voiced by Phil Hayes.

Former bassist Earl Pereira was also co-founder of Wide Mouth Mason. The band hails from Saskatoon, Saskatchewan and has been active since 1995. ==Career== Wide Mouth Mason took its name from the jar of the same name, and independently released its first album, The Nazarene in 1996. Although only 2,500 copies were pressed, it still drew interest from the major labels. The band would re-record much of The Nazarene at Greenhouse Studios. The re- recorded tracks and new material attracted the attention of Warner Music Canada, who signed the band to a record deal. The new album would be the band's eponymous major-label debut; it was released in 1997 in Canada and the U.S., and a year later in Japan. It established the group's fusion of pop/rock/blues, and yielded the hit singles \\"Midnight Rain\\", \\"My Old Self\\", and \\"This Mourning\\". The album went Gold in Canada, and the band was nominated for Best New Group at the 1998 Juno Awards.Juno Awards, past nominations Wide Mouth Mason released a new album in 1999 with Where I Started, a continuance of its prior sound, but adding elements of jazz and world music. The band returned to Greenhouse Studios to record and mix the album. The band performed at the Rivoli in Toronto in March that year to publicize the release of the album.[https://web.archive.org/web/19991007162713/http://www.chartattack.com:80/road/reviews/1999/19990317-wmm.html \\"Live Reviews: Wide Mouth Mason's Durex-sponsored CMW showcase March 6, 1999 The Rivoli, Toronto, ON\\"]. Chart Attack, review by Toko-pa Turner The album, like its predecessor, attained Gold status in Canada. Its lead single, \\"Why\\", backed with scratches and cuts from childhood friend and DJ Muchi Mambo, was a hit in Canada, and was followed by two other hits, \\"Companion (Lay Me Down)\\" and \\"Sugarcane\\". In 2000, the band quickly followed up with the album Stew. It was more pop-oriented than the band's previous efforts, but also eclectic, hence the title of the album. The single \\"Smile\\" charted well in Canada, the follow-up \\"Change\\" was popular on MuchMusic, and the album was nominated for Best Rock Album at the 2001 Junos. From March to May of 2001, Wide Mouth Mason opened for AC/DC on their Stiff Upper Lip World Tour. Wide Mouth Mason returned in 2002 with two albums. The first, Rained Out Parade, featured a heavier emphasis on the blues, a deliberate lo-fi production style, and the featured title track. It received a 2003 Juno nomination for Rock Album of the Year. The second album, Greatest Hits, was released exclusively in China. When its contract with Warner expired, the band signed a license agreement with Curve Music in 2004. The following year, the band would again release two albums, this time on the same day. One was The Essentials, a greatest-hits album, and the other was Shot Down Satellites, a new studio release featuring a hard rock-centred style and the single \\"I Love Not Loving You\\". The disc was produced by the band and their former co-manager, Ross Damude. In 2006, Shaun Verreault released his solo debut, The Daggerlip Sketches, focusing on acoustic-guitar-based material. It featured new songs and stripped-down versions of familiar material from his band. In early 2008, the Wide Mouth Mason's official website announced that Verreault was releasing a second solo album, titled Two Steel Strings, and that the full band was writing new material for a future release Since then, Earl Pereira left the band to concentrate on his own band, The Steadies (formally Mobadass), which he has fronted since 2005. In 2010, Wide Mouth Mason supported ZZ Top with Grady/Big Sugar front-man Gordie Johnson on bass. In March 2011, the band announced that Johnson would be joining the band full-time. Wide Mouth Mason recorded their first album in five years in late 2010 with Gordie Johnson producing. The band has been playing many of these unrecorded songs live over the last year. The album entitled \\"No Bad Days\\" was released on July 12, 2011. In 2019, the group release the heavily blues-influenced album \\"I Wanna Go With You\\". The record prominently features Verreault's \\"Tri-Slide\\" technique, using three slides on his fretting hand and playing more lap-steel and dobro-style instruments. ==Discography== * The Nazarene (1996) * Wide Mouth Mason (1997) * Where I Started (1999) * Stew (2000) * Rained Out Parade (2002) * Shot Down Satellites (2005) * No Bad Days (2011) * I Wanna Go With You (2019) ==See also== * Music of British Columbia * Music of Saskatchewan ==References== ==External links== * Wide Mouth Mason Official website * CanadianBands.com CanadianBands.com bio Category:Musical groups established in 1995 Category:Musical groups from Saskatoon Category:Canadian blues rock musical groups Category:1995 establishments in Saskatchewan ","title":"Wide Mouth Mason"},{"id":"2546210","text":"Chimaira is the third studio album by Chimaira, released on August 9, 2005.

During the reign of Ivan III, Beklemishev was sent on a number of important diplomatic missions. In 1490, he acted as a personal bodyguard for German ambassador Georg Delator, who had come to Moscow at the request of Maximilian I. The latter was seeking the hand of Ivan III’s daughter and an alliance against the Polish king. In 1492, Beklemishev was sent as an ambassador to Casimir IV. In 1502, he held negotiations with a Crimean khan Meñli I Giray. Ivan Beklemishev enjoyed a great amount of respect from Ivan III and had great influence over the royal court and Boyar Duma. A number of disgraced princes, such as Vasili Mikhailovich Udaliy (Prince of Vereya), used to turn to Beklemishev for mediation and protection in their dealings with the grand prince. During the reign of Vasili III, Beklemishev began to fall into disgrace as a man known for his stern disposition and oppositionary opinions (e.g., he believed that the right to discuss the affairs of the state was the most essential prerogative of the boyardom). A major confrontation between Beklemishev and Vasili III took place after he had dared to criticize him on a number of issues, such as his intention to divorce Solomonia Saburova, and his unwillingness to consult with the Duma (as opposed to Ivan III) over the affairs of the state. At one point during a debate in the Duma, Vasili III told Beklemishev: \\"Get out of my sight, you smerd, I don’t need you anymore!\\". After this incident, Ivan Beklemishev was constrained to retire from the royal court and the affairs of the state. Later, he began to express his dissatisfaction with the tsar’s policies in his discussions with Maximus the Greek, for which he would pay dearly. In 1525, Ivan Beklemishev was executed for his ties with Maximus the Greek. One of the Kremlin towers was named after Ivan Bersen-Beklemishev because his house had been adjacent to the tower from the Kremlin side. ==References== Category:People of the Grand Duchy of Moscow Category:Russian nobility Category:Imperial Russian diplomats Category:1525 deaths Category:Year of birth unknown ","title":"Ivan Bersen-Beklemishev"},{"id":"2546231","text":"Agrippa (; ) was a Greek astronomer.

The family name was taken from the town of Firenzuola, situated at the foot of the Apennines, its original home. Agnolo's grandfather had obtained the citizenship of Florence and transmitted it to his family. Agnolo was destined for the profession of the law, and pursued his studies first at Siena and afterwards at Perugia. There he became the associate of the notorious Pietro Aretino, whose foul life he was not ashamed to make the model of his own. They met again at Rome, where Agnolo practised for a time the profession of an advocate, but with little success. Firenzuola left Rome after the death of Pope Clement VII, and after spending some time at Florence, settled at Prato as abbot of San Salvatore. It is asserted by all his biographers that while still a young man he assumed the monastic dress at Vallombrosa, and that he afterwards held successively two abbacies. Girolamo Tiraboschi alone ventures to doubt this account, partly on the ground of Firenzuola's licentiousness, and partly on the ground of absence of evidence; but his arguments are not held to be conclusive. His writings, of which a collected edition was published in 1548, are partly in prose and partly in verse, and belong to the lighter classes of literature. Among the prose works are Discorsi degli animali, imitations of Oriental and Aesopian fables, of which there are two French translations; Dialogo delle bellezze delle donne, also translated into French; Ragionamenti amorosi, a series of short tales in the manner of Boccaccio, rivalling him in elegance and in licentiousness; Discacciamento delle nuove lettere, a controversial piece against Giangiorgio Trissino's proposal to introduce new letters into the Italian alphabet; a free version or adaptation of The Golden Ass of Apuleius, which became a favorite book and passed through many editions; and two comedies, I Lucidi, an imitation of the Menaechmi of Plautus, and La Trinuzia, which in some points resembles the Calandria of Cardinal Bibbiena. His poems are chiefly satirical and burlesque. All his works are esteemed as models of literary excellence, and are cited as authorities in the vocabulary of the Accademia della Crusca. The date of Firenzuola's death is only approximately ascertained. He had been dead several years when the first edition of his writings appeared (1548). ==References== ==Bibliography == *Agnolo Firenzuola, On the Beauty of Women, trans.

It began as a Committee on Higher Degrees, with a mandate to advise Senate on the University’s graduate policy and recommend the award of scholarship for approval. In 1992, the Committee on Higher Degrees was transformed to a Board of Graduate Studies. This Board, a sub-committee of Academic Board was entrusted with responsibility for administering graduate education in the University, until its status was elevated to a School on 1 August 2008. The School has the mandate to co-ordinate graduate-level academic programmes for all Colleges within the University. It also regulates and offers advice on graduate programmes of university colleges affiliated to the University of Cape Coast. To achieve its vision and mission, the School has four-fold functions: # Draft regulations for all higher degrees with a view to ensuring that acceptable academic standards are maintained. # Receive reports and consider recommendations pertaining to higher degrees and graduate diplomas from Departmental and Faculty Committee of Graduate Studies. # Determine the results of higher degrees and graduate diplomas. # Make recommendations to the Academic Board for the award of higher degrees and graduate diplomas. The University operates a two-semester system for its regular graduate programmes. The First Semester begins from August to December and Second Semester from January to May. The University awards Master of Arts (M.A.), Master of Science (M.Sc.), Master of Education (M.Ed.), Master of Business Administration (M.B.A.), Master of Philosophy (M.Phil.), Master of Commerce (M.Com.) and Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) degrees in the various disciplines. M.A./M.Ed./M.Sc. programmes will normally consist of two (2) semesters of course work (nine (9) months) followed by a project or dissertation (three (3) months). The Master of Philosophy (M.Phil.) programme will normally consist of two parts. Part I shall consist of two semesters of course work for full-time students and four semesters of course work for part- time students. Part II extends over 12-months and is for research and presentation of the thesis. The Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) programme is essentially by research. The duration is between 3 and 4 years for full-time students and 4 and 5 years for part-time students. ==Centre for International Education== The Centre for International Education (CIE), University of Cape Coast, was established to promote, support and coordinate all facets of international education activities in the University. These activities include international students and staff exchanges, research collaborations and publications, and information sharing, all aimed at enhancing the international image of the University. Over the years, the Centre had fostered links with institutions of higher learning from the USA, China, UK, Sweden, Germany, Liberia, Nigeria and Senegal, among others. The Centre offers specialized support services for inbound and outbound exchange students and staff on issues including, but not exclusive to, orientation, admission, enrollment, accommodation, pastoral care, pre-departure briefings and post- return debriefings for inbound and outbound exchange students and staff. FUNCTIONS \\\\----The Centre: # Manages all matters and programmes relating to international education. # Serves as an advisory unit to all academic departments on exchanges and collaborations. # Serves as a service provider on campus to all international and visiting students, faculty members and staff. # Is responsible for the development of Memorandum of Understanding or partnership agreements with institutions in and outside Ghana. # Facilitates the exchange of staff, faculty and students of partner institutions and vice versa. # Organizes international workshops, seminars and conferences. The University of Cape Coast runs an international student exchange programme with participants from Europe, North America, and other African countries. International students are fully integrated into student and campus life and receive full credit on successful completion of their studies at UCC. ==Halls of Residence== *Oguaa Hall *Atlantic Hall *Adehye Hall *Casely Hayford Hall(Casford) *Kwame Nkrumah Hall *Valco Hall *SRC Hall ==Notable alumni== * Edmund Abaka, a photographer[1] and historian of Africa at the University of Miami. *Rosina Acheampong, a Ghanaian educationist and former Headmistress of Wesley Girls High School. * Alfred P.

It is the third book in Baxter's Xeelee Sequence. ==Plot introduction== Dura and her fellow human beings live inside a neutron star, as they have for generations. As long as they can remember, \\"glitches\\" (instabilities of the magnetic field inside the star caused by changes in the star's rotation) have happened from time to time. As the novel starts, the worst glitch that anyone can remember threatens to destroy her home. To survive, Dura must travel to a far-off city, and eventually outside of the star itself. ===Explanation of the novel's title=== Flux is so called as the main race of the book, microscopic human- like beings who live within a neutron star, travel around using the magnetic field lines within that star. It also relates to a bigger element of the plot, dealing with instabilities in this field which affect many characters in different ways. ==Plot summary== As the novel begins, a glitch — an instability of the magnetic field inside the star caused by changes in the star's rotation — is about to destroy a net made of ropes, where a group of 50 humans live. During this several of the older humans are killed, and importantly the humans lose their main food source, a herd of \\"air pigs\\", animals indigenous to the star. To find more food, Dura, together with her young brother Farr, Adda (the eldest of the humans and one of the novel's main characters), Philas (wife of a man killed during the glitch; this man was also seeing Dura), and six other adults travel high into the top of the mantle of the star to find food in the forest. While there Adda is injured by a pregnant air pig. Soon the humans encounter Toba Mixxax, another human from Parz City. Parz is a massive wooden city where other star-humans live, with a functioning economy and upper and nether classes. As becomes apparent, the ancestors of Dura's group did originally live in Parz, but left when their belief that the Xeelee should ultimately be accepted as being for the good of humanity was not accepted by the rulers of Parz. A hospital, \\"The Hospital of the Common Good\\" in the heart of Parz City, is Adda's only chance for survival. While in Parz, we meet several other characters, including Muub, the head physician and advisor to Hork, the administrator of Parz. To pay for Adda's treatment, Dura's labour is sold to a mantle wheat farm, and Farr is sold to work in the underbelly of the city as a miner. Farr makes two friends while here: Toba Mixxax's son Criss, and Byza, a fellow miner. Criss teaches Farr to board (using a specially constructed plate to \\"surf\\" along the flux lines), an ability which allows him to escape from the eventual attack by the Xeelee. After various plot points, the characters realise the instabilities are actually being caused by the attack of the Xeelee, and the next instability could destroy both Parz and possibly the star itself. Hork calls for Muub, Dura (called due to her experience as a star-human), Adda, Farr and a scientist to go down into the uninhabitable centre of the star in a specially constructed vessel and try and retrieve ancient weapons, supposedly left by the humans who originally created the star-human race. When they get there however they discover that the neutron star had been turned into a missile aimed at The Ring that is being constructed by the Xeelee and so the Xeelee have been attacking it to stop it. They also discover that they were created by normal humans to ensure that the star remains on course but that would result in the destruction of the star and themselves. They decide to alter the course of the star so that it misses The Ring and so the Xeelee stop their attacks. ==Characters in Flux== ===Main characters=== *Dura: daughter of Logue, the leader of the small tribe of star humans and the story's main protagonist *Farr: younger brother to Dura *Adda: curmudgeonly elder of the tribe, with knowledge of the history, beliefs and stories that have been passed down through the generations *Hork: Vice Chair and leader of Parz City, son of Hork IV *Muub: Head Physician and administrator of the hospital in Parz *Toba Mixxax: Ceiling farmer who takes Dura, Adda, and Farr to Parz City *Ito Mixxax: Toba's wife *Cris Mixxax: Toba and Ito's son who becomes friends with Farr and introduces him to surfing *Hosch: hard nosed supervisor of the fishermen that plumb for corestuff bergs from the Parz City harbour *Bzya: pragmatic fisherman that takes Farr under his wing, and one of the few civilised men that Adda warms to ===Lesser characters=== *Logue: the leader of the small nomadic star human tribe, who is lost in the glitch in the opening pages of the book *Esk: another member of the tribe who lost his life in the initial glitch.

Initially, the settlers of such sloboda were freed from various taxes and levies for various reasons, hence the name. Freedom from taxes was an incentive for colonization.\\"Selitba\\" (Settlementing), Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary (1890-1906) By the first half of the 18th century, this privilege was abolished, and slobodas became ordinary villages, shtetls, townlets, suburbs. Some slobodas were suburban settlements, right behind the city wall. Many of them were subsequently incorporated into cities, and the corresponding toponyms indicate their origin, such as Ogorodnaya Sloboda Lane, Moscow (:ru:Переулок Огородная Слобода). The Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary writes that by the end of the 19th century a sloboda was a large village with more than one church, a marketplace, and volost administration, or a village-type settlement of industrial character, where the peasants have little involvement in agriculture. The term is preserved in names of various settlements and city quarters.

In 1971 he inherited Carlton Towers and the title Baron Beaumont on the death of his mother Mona Stapleton, 11th Baroness Beaumont, whose paternal ancestor had changed his surname from Errington on inheriting the estate from his uncle Miles Stapleton, 1st Baronet (1626–1707) of Carlton, a descendant by a distant female line of John Beaumont, 1st Viscount Beaumont, 6th Baron Beaumont (d.1460) Carlton Towers in the parish of Carlton, south-east of Selby,Coordinates 53.706589°N 1.017471°W North Yorkshire, England, is a very large Grade I listedListed 17 November 1966 Ref:1295955 country house, in the Victorian Gothic-revival style, and is surrounded by a 250-acre park.

His architect was Edward Welby Pugin, who \\"encased and incorporated\\"Listed building text the earlier manor house dating from 1614 into a larger structure. He sold much of the estate to finance the building work. The 9th Baron died of pneumonia, without issue, and it passed to his younger brother the 10th Baron.

Initials \\"HS\\", refer to Henry Stapleton, 9th Baron Beaumont (1848–1892), who was responsible for the extensive Victorian- Gothic enlargement 1873-5 of Carlton Towers. The French motto Mieux Sera signifies \\"It will be better\\" It is known that there has been a house on the site from at least the 14th century, but nothing visible remains and there is no documentary record. The manor of Carlton was acquired by Nicholas Stapleton (1280–1343), eldest son of Miles de Stapleton (d.1314), killed at the Battle of Bannockburn, who was Steward of the Household to King Edward II. The family originated at the manor of Stapleton-on-Tees near Darlington in North Yorkshire. Carlton passed to Nicholas's nephew Sir Bryan Stapleton (c.1321–1394), a Knight of the Garter and Warden of Calais, younger brother and heir of Sir Miles Stapleton (c.1320–1372), of Bedale, Yorkshire, a founder Knight of the Garter. The last in the male line of Stapleton of Carlton was Sir Miles Stapleton, 1st Baronet (1628–1707) who died childless and left his estates to his nephew Nicholas Errington (d.1716) of Ponteland, Northumberland, who in accordance with the bequest adopted the name and arms of Stapleton. Nicholas's grandson, Thomas Stapleton (d.1821), succeeded in 1750 and in 1765 improved the house and estate, commissioning Thomas White to landscape the park and Thomas Atkinson of York to add the long East Wing, the clock above which shows the date 1777.https://carltontowers.co.uk/home/history/ Thomas was a keen breeder and trainer of horses and with Sir Thomas Gascoigne, 8th Baronet won the St. Leger Stakes in 1778 with Hollandaise and in his own right the following year with Tommy. In 1795 he made an unsuccessful claim to the title Baron Beaumont, abeyant since 1507, which he was in remainder to through his great-grandmother Mrs Anne Errington, sister of Sir Miles Stapleton, 1st Baronet, both descendants via a distant female line of John Beaumont, 1st Viscount Beaumont, 6th Baron Beaumont (d.1460), himself a descendant in the male line of John de Brienne (d.1237), King of Jerusalem, by his third wife, Berengaria of Leon, and thus a second cousin of King Edward II of England. His son Miles died without issue, when the estate passed to his first-cousin Thomas Stapleton (d.1839), whose son Miles Stapleton, 8th Baron Beaumont (1805–1854) in 1840 successfully obtained the abeyant title Baron Beaumont. The house was re-built to its present form in 1873-5 by his son Henry Stapleton, 9th Baron Beaumont (1848–1892), an officer in the British Army, who married Violet Marie Louise Wootton Isaacson, daughter of Frederick Wootton Isaacson. As he had no children his heir was his younger brother Miles Stapleton, 10th Baron Beaumont (1850–1895), an officer in the British Army, who married Mary Ethel Tempest, daughter and heiress of Sir Charles Henry Tempest, 1st Baronet (1834–1894) of Heaton,\\"a township, in the parish of Deane, union of Bolton, hundred of Salford, S. division of Lancashire, 2½ miles (W. by N.) from Bolton...The property belongs exclusively to H.

Lady Beaumont owned Carlton until her death in 1971. During the Second World War the house was used as an auxiliary military hospital but was afterwards restored to its original condition. Her eldest son, Miles Francis Stapleton Fitzalan-Howard, 17th Duke of Norfolk, 12th Baron Beaumont (1915–2002), inherited both the Beaumont and Howard of Glossop baronies and in 1975 also succeeded his cousin as 17th Duke of Norfolk and Earl Marshal of England, with several other peerage titles and also inherited the Duke's estates including his principal seat of Arundel Castle in Sussex, which he made his home. After many years with no residents, Carlton Towers was re-occupied in 1990 by his second son Lord Gerald Fitzalan-Howard (born 1962) and his wife Lady Gerald Fitzalan-Howard. ==In popular culture== The house was used as the location of \\"Hetton Abbey\\" for the 1988 film version of Evelyn Waugh's novel A Handful of Dust. It (along with Lord Gerald Fitzalan-Howard and his young family) was featured on The Guest Wing, a television programme shown on Sky Atlantic in Great Britain in April and May 2012. The South Australian Film Corporation also used the house in the film Like Minds (2006), starring Toni Collette. The TV series Micawber starring David Jason used the house for filming. The TV show, The Darling Buds of May used the house in their show, (Carlton Towers appeared as Château Brest in one of the episodes where the family was on holiday in France). The character played by Bernard Cribbins in the 1967 film Casino Royale was named \\"Carlton Towers of the F.O.\\", playing off the name of an earlier British comedy, Carlton-Browne of the F.O. Carlton Towers was also the name of several blocks of highrise council flats in the Little London area of Leeds. The flats were demolished in February 2010 as part of a major housing regeneration project. ==See also== *Arundel Castle in Sussex, which is the main seat of the Dukes of Norfolk *Norfolk House, the former London residence of the Dukes of Norfolk *Thomas Atkinson (architect) added long East Wing in 1765 ==Bibliography== *Colvin, Howard (1995) Biographical Dictionary of British Architects, 1600–1840, New Haven: Yale University Press, *Sayer, Michael (1993) The Disintegration of a Heritage: Country Houses and their Collections, 1979–1992, Norfolk: Michael Russell (Publishing) ==References== ==External links== * *Sotheby’s London To Offer Property From Carlton Towers Auction was held in November 2009 Category:Country houses in North Yorkshire \\\\+ Category:Grade I listed buildings in North Yorkshire Category:Gothic Revival architecture in North Yorkshire Category:Grade I listed houses Category:Selby Category:Houses completed in 1875 ","title":"Carlton Towers"},{"id":"2546307","text":"The Ventura County Courthouse, known since 1974 as Ventura City Hall, is a historic building in Ventura, California. It is located on a hill at the top of California Street, overlooking the city's downtown district with views of the Santa Barbara Channel and Channel Islands. It was the first building in the City of Ventura to be listed on the National Register of Historic Places and has also received historic designations at the state, county, and city levels. Built from 1912 to 1913, the Neoclassical courthouse was designed by the noted Los Angeles architect Albert C. Martin Sr. in a Beaux Arts style. The building's facade includes white glazed terra cotta panels and decorations, including 24 whimsical faces of Franciscan friars, fluted Doric columns, a copper-sheathed dome and cupola, and Roman-arched windows. The second-floor city council chambers (previously the building's courtroom) include carved mahogany woodwork, stained glass skylights, and arched windows overlooking the city and ocean. The courthouse was expanded in the early 1930s with the construction of an annex off the building's west wing. In 1968, the building was declared structurally unsound and county workers relocated. The City of Ventura purchased the building from the County and renovated it at a cost of approximately $3.4 million. The building has served as Ventura City Hall since 1974. ==The building and historic designations== Terra cotta facade with friars' heads The building architecture has been described as Neoclassical Revival, Beaux Arts Classicisim, Roman Doric, and French Renaissance. The architect Albert C. Martin referred to it as \\"resembling Roman Doric\\". When the plans were unveiled in 1911, the Los Angeles Times reported that the \\"Roman Doric order\\" design would be \\"one of the most imposing public structures in California, and a credit to the seat of government of the prosperous lima bean section.\\" Notable design features of the facade include white glazed terra cotta panels and decorations, including 24 whimsical faces of Franciscan friars, fluted Doric columns, a copper- sheathed dome and cupola, Roman-arched windows, and ornate brass gates and double doors. The interior design features include extensive use of Italian marble, bronze balustrades, and a large, second-floor courtroom (now city council chambers) with carved mahogany woodwork, three domes with leaded, stained glass skylights, and arched windows overlooking the city and ocean. The building has been praised as one of Southern California's most beautiful government buildings. In 1926, the Ventura Star wrote: \\"She stands majestically upon the hill, this courthouse of ours, with her national colors fluttering in the harbor breezes, for all the world like a beautiful woman in a Paris gown.\\" In 1991, the Los Angeles Times said of the landmark structure: \\"Probably no local structure is more visually and symbolically dramatic, or as steeped in local legend. Perched like a lordly, lavish manor at the juncture of California and Poli streets, it overlooks the old town and the blue Pacific beyond – a constant reminder of the past.\\" The courthouse has been designated as a historic building at the federal, state, county, and city levels. In December 1970, it was designated as Ventura County Historic Landmark No. 12. Five months later, in May 1971, it was designated as California Historical Landmark No. 847. Three months after that, in August 1971, the building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the first building in the city (and the second in the county) to be so recognized. When the City of Ventura adopted its own historic landmark program in February 1974, the courthouse was one of the first buildings to be selected, receiving the designation as Ventura Historic Landmark No. 4. ==Construction and early history== ===1873 courthouse=== The original Ventura County Courthouse was built at a cost of $10,000 in 1873 by William Dewey Hobson, who had earlier in the year successfully lobbied the California Legislature to created Ventura County. The land, donated by Bishop Thaddeus Amat, was carved out of the gardens at the Mission San Buenaventura at a location between Santa Clara, Meta (now Thompson), Figueroa, and Junipero Streets. After the new courthouse opened in 1913, the old courthouse remained vacant, though it was used for a time as housing for indigent Mexican families. The old courthouse was ultimately demolished in 1921 by contractor A. Pefley who purchased the building from the County for $200 and salvaged 200,0000 bricks from the structure. A 2007 archaeological dig uncovered a portion of the mission era wall foundation built with 40 to 50 pound stones as expected from historical surveys and maps. The dig found artifacts from many periods besides the first courthouse, jail, and first hospital including signs of the long history of human settlement such as beads made of shells by Native Americans harvested from the nearby ocean. ===Design and construction (1910–1913)=== By 1910, the tower of the original courthouse was badly cracked and leaning over the front entrance. A bigger courthouse would also better serve the County's population which had grown from 5,073 in 1880 to 18,347 in 1910. Judge Felix Ewing recommended the site at the top of California Street for a new courthouse. The Board of Supervisors followed Judge Ewing's recommendation, deciding to acquire land totaling 400 feet by 400 feet along the north side of Poli Street, a site occupied by the homes of James Blackstock and Henry Neel.The Blackstock House was moved to 835 E. Main St. It remains at that location and was designated as Ventura Historic Landmark No. 51 in 1980. However, a bond measure to raise funds for the new courthouse was defeated in 1911. The following year, voters approved a $150,000 bond measure to build the courthouse. The noted Los Angeles architect Albert C. Martin was commissioned to design the new courthouse. Martin's Los Angeles works include Los Angeles City Hall, the May Company Building, and St. Vincent de Paul Church. His Ventura County works include St. Mary Magdalen Church in Camarillo and the Bella Maggiore Inn in downtown Ventura. The courthouse was built in 1912 and 1913 at a cost of $278,000. The July 1913 dedication of the courthouse was celebrated in two days of events with a crowd estimated at 20,000 attending the festivities. The festivities began on the first day with a lengthy parade featuring seven bands, four companies of seamen and marines from the USS South Dakota anchored at Ventura, decorated automobiles, and floats from every chamber of commerce and lodge in the county, including one built in the shape of a giant lima bean pod (then the County's biggest cash crop) and another bearing a local girl dressed as the \\"Goddess of Liberty\\". After the parade, speeches were given at Plaza Park, and horse races and fireworks followed at Seaside Park. On the second day, Adolfo Camarillo, chairman of the County Board of Supervisors, formally turned over the building, and a ball was held that evening under electric lights at the new courthouse. ===Operation as courthouse (1913–1968)=== Front of Ventura City Hall From 1913 to 1968, the building functioned as the Ventura County Courthouse. It also housed other offices of the county government and was the site of meetings of the County Board of Supervisors. One of the noted defense attorneys to practice at the courthouse in the 1920s and 1930s was Erle Stanley Gardner. Gardner maintained an office one block south of the courthouse from which he practiced law and also wrote the Perry Mason novels. Gardner published the first of 82 Perry Mason novels in 1933. ====Courthouse Annex==== Between 1930 and 1931, the Courthouse was expanded with the construction of a two-story annex at the western end of the building. The annex was designed by architect Harold E. Burkett and built at a cost of approximately $450,000. The annex was designed to mirror the architecture of the main courthouse with a terra cotta facade, copper roof, and bronze door.Historic Resources Inventory form for the Courthouse Annex dated 8/3/82 and prepared by Judy Triem of the Historical Preservation Commission. Copy found in the clippings file for \\"Ventura County Courthouse\\") It provided space for a jail and offices for, among others, the sheriff's department, motor patrol, county board of education, farm bureau, and health department. One of the most notorious individuals held at the annex's jail was Charles Manson. Manson was arrested in Ventura in April 1968 and held and arraigned there on a drunk driving charge. ====Elizabeth Duncan trial==== In 1958, the main courtroom at the Ventura Courthouse was the site of the nationally publicized murder trial of Elizabeth Duncan. Duncan was accused of hiring two men to kidnap and kill her daughter-in-law, a nurse named Olga Duncan. The daughter-in-law was six-and-a-half months pregnant and was beaten with a wrench, pistol-whipped, strangled and dumped in a shallow grave off Casitas Pass Road. The coverage of the trial was so extensive that an extra 150 seats were added to the 99 seats in the courtroom, and a table for dozens of reporters was set up along the front rail. After a five-week trial, which included evidence that Duncan had previously hired a man to pose as her son to seek an annulment of the marriage, Duncan was convicted. After appeals were denied, Duncan and her two co-defendants were executed in the gas chamber in August 1962. ==Renovation and latter history== ===Finding of structural unsoundness and renovation=== For nearly six decades, the building served as the center of county government. During that time, the county's population grew by 2,000 percent from 18,347 in 1910 to 376,430 in 1970. The need for a larger government center prompted the County in the early 1960s to acquire 81.7 acres in east Ventura at the northwest corner of Victoria Avenue and Telephone Road. The relocation of county government offices to east Ventura was accelerated by concerns about the seismic stability of the downtown courthouse. After a small earthquake in 1968, judges refused to hold court in the main courtroom, expressing concern that the stained-glass dome might crash down on them. (An earthquake in 1954 had caused pieces of plaster to fall from the ceiling in the courtroom and law library.) The County asked a structural engineer, W. D. Crouch Jr., to examine the building, and he concluded that the courthouse was structurally unsafe in the event of an earthquake. In November 1968, the County enacted an evacuation plan to relocate all workers from the building within 90 days. The evacuation was completed in January 1969. In 1970, the City of Ventura bought the structure for $145,000 with the intention of making it the City Hall. Over a 17-month period from mid-1972 to December 1973, the 45,284-square-foot building was renovated and strengthened at a cost of approximately $3.4 million. Ted Fisher was the architect for the renovation, and MacLeod Construction was the general contractor. Key elements of the renovation included the following: 1\\\\. More than 25 percent of the terra cotta tiles on the facade had deteriorated and were replaced. The company that created the original tiles, Gladding, McBean, was still in business though its name had changed to Interpace Co. Interpace still had the plans for the original tiles in its files and used those plans to create the replacement tiles. Each tile weighed 550 pounds and was fired in a kiln at 2,060 degrees. The cost of replacing the terra cotta tiles was $702,000. 2\\\\. The building lacked steel reinforcement when built in 1912. Structural reinforcement was achieved by using gunite sprayed concrete to replace an original layer of brick and mortar inside the walls. To attach the terra cotta facade to the new wall structure, small holes were bored, and a newly-developed expanding epoxy adhesive was injected inside the walls. Warner Construction Co. of Los Angeles injected approximately 3,000 gallons of the epoxy into the walls. 3\\\\. The electrical and plumbing systems were replaced, as were many doors and windows. 4\\\\. The large courtroom on the second floor was converted into chambers for Ventura's City Council. The city received more than $630,000 in federal grants to assist in funding the renovations, and another million dollars was to be obtained through federal revenue sharing funds. The new City Hall was dedicated in a ceremony held on December 29, 1973. It opened for business in early January 1974. ===Operation as Ventura City Hall (1974–present)=== The building became Ventura City Hall in January 1974 when the majority of the city's offices were relocated from the former city hall at 625 E. Santa Clara Street to the renovated courthouse. The old city hall had only 12,240 square feet of space, compared to approximately 49,000 square feet in the new city hall. The City has continued to incur substantial expense to maintain and replace the building's signature, glazed terra cotta tiles. In 1986, the City set aside $1 million for work on the structure, most of that being required to replace 547 damaged tiles on the building's western annex. The new expenditures brought the City's total renovation costs to $8 million. In 2001, the City faced a projected $6 million cost to replace yet more terra cotta panels that were found to be peeling and allowing moisture to seep in and black mold to proliferate. ==In popular culture== The building has been a popular shooting location. In 1997, three films were shot there. In June 1989, actor-director Jack Nicholson filmed \\"The Two Jakes\\" (sequel to \\"Chinatown\\") at the building. ==See also== * Father Serra statue – erected in front of Courthouse, the statue depicts Junípero Serra founder of Mission San Buenaventura * National Register of Historic Places listings in Ventura County, California * California Historical Landmarks in Ventura County, California * Ventura County Historic Landmarks & Points of Interest * City of Ventura Historic Landmarks and Districts ==External links== * Video prepared for the building's 100th anniversary ==References== Category:Buildings and structures in Ventura, California Category:County courthouses in California Category:California Historical Landmarks Category:Courthouses on the National Register of Historic Places in California Category:National Register of Historic Places in Ventura, California Category:Government buildings completed in 1913 Category:Terracotta Category:Beaux-Arts architecture in California Category:1913 establishments in California ","title":"Ventura County Courthouse"},{"id":"2546327","text":"The Punkles were a German band performing songs by The Beatles in punk style.

The Feast of the Circumcision of Christ is a Christian celebration of the circumcision of Jesus in accordance with Jewish tradition, eight days (according to the Semitic and southern European calculation of intervals of days)In the northern European calculation, which abstracts from the day from which the count begins, the interval was of seven days. after his birth, the occasion on which the child was formally given his name. (King James Version): \\"And when eight days were accomplished for the circumcising of the child, his name was called JESUS, which was so named of the angel before he was conceived in the womb.\\"Catholic Encyclopedia: Feast of the Circumcision The circumcision of Jesus has traditionally been seen, as explained in the popular 14th-century work the Golden Legend, as the first time the blood of Christ was shed, and thus the beginning of the process of the redemption of man, and a demonstration that Christ was fully human, and of his obedience to Biblical law. The feast day appears on 1 January in the liturgical calendar of the Byzantine Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Churches.Greek Orthodox Archdiocese calendar of Holy Days In the General Roman Calendar, the 1 January feast, which from 1568 to 1960 was called \\"The Circumcision of the Lord and the Octave of the Nativity\\", is now named the Solemnity of Mary, Mother of God, and the Octave Day of the Nativity of the Lord. It is celebrated by some churches of the Anglican Communion and virtually all Lutheran churches. In these latter Western Christian denominations, the Feast of the Naming and Circumcision of Jesus Christ marks the eighth day (octave day) of Christmastide. == Byzantine Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Churches == The feast is celebrated with an All-Night Vigil, beginning the evening of December 31. The hymns of the feast are combined with those for Saint Basil the Great. After the Divine Liturgy the next morning, Russian churches often celebrate a New Year Molieben (service of intercession) to pray for God's blessing for the beginning of the civil New Year (Byzantine Christians commemorate the Indiction, or Ecclesiastical New Year, on September 1). On the Julian calendar, 1 January will correspond, until 2100, to 14 January on the Gregorian Calendar. Accordingly, in Russia, 14 January in the civil calendar is known as \\"The Old New Year\\", since it corresponds to 1 January in the Julian Calendar, still used by the Church. The Circumcision by Luca Signorelli (16th century) ==Latin Catholic Church== At an early stage the Church in Rome celebrated on 1 January a feast that it called the anniversary (Natale) of the Mother of God. When this was overshadowed by the feasts of the Annunciation and the Assumption, adopted from Constantinople at the start of the 7th century, 1 January began to be celebrated simply as the octave day of Christmas, the \\"eighth day\\" on which, according to , the child was circumcised and given the name Jesus. In the 13th or 14th century 1 January began to be celebrated in Rome, as already in Spain and Gaul, as the feast of the Circumcision of the Lord and the Octave of the Nativity, while still oriented towards Mary and Christmas.Adolf Adam, The Liturgical Year (Liturgical Press 1990 ), pp. 139–140 The emphasis that Saint Bernardine of Siena (1380–1444) laid on the name of Jesus in his preaching led in 1721 to the institution of a separate Feast of the Holy Name of Jesus. Pope John XXIII's 1960 rubrical and calendrical revision called 1 January simply the Octave of the Nativity. (This 1960 calendar was incorporated into the 1962 Roman Missal, whose continued use is authorized by the motu proprio Summorum Pontificum.) The 1969 revision states: \\"1 January, the Octave Day of the Nativity of the Lord, is the Solemnity of Mary, the Holy Mother of God, and also the commemoration of the conferral of the Most Holy Name of Jesus.\\"Universal Norms on the Liturgical Year and the Calendar, 35 f However, this does not apply to traditionalists, who do not follow the majority, if any, of the post-Vatican II changes, where it remains a Holy Day of Obligation. ==Anglican Communion== The Anglican Communion's Book of Common Prayer liturgy celebrates this day as the Circumcision of Christ. Since 2000, the Common Worship of the Church of England has listed this day as \\"The Naming and Circumcision of Jesus Christ.\\" The Book of Common Prayer of the Anglican Church of Canada calls it \\"The Octave Day of Christmas, and the Circumcision of Our Lord, being New Year's Day\\". The 1979 Book of Common Prayer of the Episcopal Church (United States) names this day \\"The Holy Name of Our Lord Jesus Christ\\", a Feast of the Lord. ==Lutheran Church== Since it was a feast of Christ and related directly to Scriptural passages (notably Luke 2:21), the Feast of Circumcision was retained by churches of the Lutheran Reformation. It remains on most Lutheran liturgical calendars to this day, although there has been a general move to call it \\"The Name of Jesus.\\"As in the Lutheran Book of Worship, page 10. Copyright 1978, Augsburg Fortress., Martin Luther preached at least one notable sermon on this feast day which is still available in his Church Postils, and up until the late 1970s, Lutheran hymnbooks would contain several hymns relating to this subject. ==See also== *Circumcision in the Bible *Feast of the Holy Name of Jesus *Holy prepuce ==References== == External links == * Russia Orthodox explanation of The Circumcision (\\"Obrezanie\\") of the Lord * An essay on the feast of the circumcision from Anglicans Online Category:Eastern Orthodox liturgical days Category:Christmastide Category:January observances Category:Circumcision ","title":"Feast of the Circumcision of Christ"},{"id":"2546337","text":"Yuracaré (also called Yurujare, Yurucare) are South American indigenous people living on 2,500 square kilometres along the Chapare River watershed in Cochabamba Department and Beni Department, in the Bolivian Lowlands of the Amazon Basin. The Yuracaré reside not far from Santa Cruz de la Sierra and Cochabamba, among the forests and plains near the Andes. They are among the residents of the Yuracaré Native Community Land (TCO), the Yuqui TCO, the Isiboro Sécure National Park and Indigenous Territory, the Chiman Indigenous Territory, and the Multiethnic Indigenous Territory I. The Yuracare language is a language isolate, and is believed to be spoken in Bolivia by between 500 and 2,500 people. There are about 400 families in the Cochabamba Department and 62 Yuracare households in the Beni Department. The Yuracaré, who are one of approximately 35 Bolivian indigenous groups, traditionally bury their dead along with their bow and arrows, as it is a belief that the dead go to a place underground where game is plentiful. == Modern issues == Indiana University's IFRI, along with the Center for the Study of Economic and Social Reality (CERES), has done research among the Yuracaré regarding the way the Yuracaré manage their forests. The organization helped the Yuracaré develop a forest management plan and receive official land titles to their territory by 1996, and in 1998 the Bolivian government officially approved the management plan. This was the first time in Bolivian history that an indigenous group was granted concessionary forest management rights. Further, the IFRI said that the natives' forest management practices increase the amount and size of fruiting trees. The Yuracaré find it important to maintain the forest because certain trees bear the fruit that is necessary in attracting the game that they hunt and of which they live off. Like other indigenous groups in Bolivia, the Yuracaré have faced major problems stemming from cultural issues in recent years. Some background: Bolivia is South America's poorest nation, and the native populations there are the most financially deprived of all. Having remained isolated over the years, authentic native traditions have still survived, while evolving under Catholic (in this case, the Jesuits of Paraguayan Reductions) and Spanish influences. The proliferation of the Spanish language has led to disconnect and even friction between native tongues and Spanish-speakers. Globalization has been a major issue, as the Yuracaré have rejected privatization that has been implemented with encouragement from the U.S., to some amount of success. ==See also== * Yuracaré language ==References== ==External links== *DoBeS : General information about the Yuracaré people *Paradisec has a collection of open access materials that includes Yuracaré language materials *International Forestry Resources and Institutions *New Advent Catholic Encyclopedia Yuracaré Profile *Ceres Bolivia (in Spanish) Category:Ethnic groups in Bolivia Category:Beni Department Category:Cochabamba Department Category:Indigenous peoples in Bolivia Category:Indigenous peoples of the Amazon ","title":"Yuracaré"},{"id":"2546340","text":"The shipyards of Riva Trigoso seen from Punta Manara.

As recorded by The Weavers, the song reached the pop music charts in 1951. It is catalogued as Roud Folk Song Index No. 414. == History as folk song == Cecil Sharp around 1900 It is unclear when, where and by whom the song was first sung. In historical times folksongs were the informal property of the communities that sang them, passed down through generations. They were published only when a curious person took the trouble to visit singers and document their songs, an activity that in America began only around the turn of the 20th century.See Folk song. For a detailed history of how Appalachian folk song was \\"discovered\\" around this time by scholars and other urbanites, see . For this reason it is unlikely that an originator of \\"On Top of Old Smoky\\" could ever be identified. One of the earliest versions of \\"On Top of Old Smoky\\" to be recorded in fieldwork was written down by the English folklorist Cecil Sharp, who during the First World War made three summer field trips to the Appalachian Mountains seeking folk songs, accompanied and assisted by Maud Karpeles. Sharp and Karpeles found to their delight that the Appalachians, then geographically isolated, were a strong preserve of traditional music and that many of the people they met were naturally-gifted singers who knew a great number of songs.See Sharp's Preface to Sharps and Karpeles (1932). They were also intrigued to find that many of the songs the people sang to them were versions of songs Sharp had earlier collected from people in rural England, suggesting that the ancestors of the Appalachian residents had brought them over from the old country. In one version the first verse is the following; :On top of Old Smoky, :All covered with snow, :I lost my true lover :For courtin' too slow. The version of \\"On Top of Old Smoky\\" that Sharp and Karpeles collected was sung to them on 29 July 1916 by Miss Memory Shelton in Alleghany, Madison County, North Carolina.See . Miss Shelton was 23 years old,See Sharp and Karpeles (1916), and for full life dates (1892-1992) see . and was part of a family several of whose members sang for Sharp.See , as well as Sharp and Karpeles (1916) identifying Memory Shelton as daughter of Mrs. Noah Shelton. Memory Shelton's version differs in notes, rhythm, and wording from the version most people know today, but only modestly so; for instance the words of the first verse are as follows: :On top of Old Smoky, :All covered in snow, :I lost my true lover :By sparking too slow. where sparking is a now-rare word that means courting.Oxford English Dictionary, online edition, entry \\"spark\\". She also avoided the extreme prolongation of the syllables of Smoky and lover that are customary today, instead assigning just one musical beat to Smo- and lov- and two to -key and -er.Pete Seeger (1961:60-61) offered two versions of the song, one with prolonged notes, the other not. He commented on the difference, hinting that the prolonged-note version was his own: \\"The first version given here [prolonged notes] shows how some songs can be adapted slightly for group singing. At the bottom is the tune as it sounds better sung in the old solo way.\\" The version with prolonged notes has, in small print, a representation of the \\"lining out\\" (spoken cuing of the next line for the group) that Seeger performed in his influential recording (see below) with the Weavers. The version Miss Shelton sang has twelve verses. It was published twice; first in the preliminary volume of folk songs prepared by Sharp and Karpeles after their first summer of fieldwork (Sharp and Karpeles 1917), then in 1932 after Sharp's death, in the much larger compendium of Appalachian folk songs that Karpeles edited from the full notes of their three summers' fieldwork.Sharp and Karpeles (1932), vol. 2, song 64A American field workers were also active in the Appalachians. A (tuneless) text for \\"On Top of Old Smoky\\", similar to what Memory Shelton sang, was published by E. C. Perrow in 1915, slightly before Sharp's fieldwork.Perrow is not clear on where he got the text from; his label says: \\"From North Carolina; mountain whites; MS. written for E. N. Caldwell; 1913\\". E. C. Perrow (1915) Songs and Rhymes from the South. The Journal of American Folklore, Vol. 28, No. 108 (Apr. - Jun., 1915), pp. 129-190. Available on JSTOR (pay site), and currently posted online at . In the following decades, still further variants of \\"On Top of Old Smoky\\" were recorded by fieldworkers in North CarolinaSeven versions collected in North Carolina are given by Brown and White (1977:170-173). and Tennessee.A list (without words or music) of five versions is given in Edwin C. Kirkland (1946) A Check List of the Titles of Tennessee Folksongs. The Journal of American Folklore, Vol. 59, No. 234 (Oct. - Dec., 1946), pp. 423-476. Available on JSTOR. ===Alternative tunes and words=== The Appalachian tradition characteristically spawned multiple variants of the same song. In the extreme case, the same basic set of words could be sung to more than one tune, or the same tune could adopt a completely different set of words. The now-standard tune of \\"On Top of Old Smoky\\" competed with a completely different tune, which Sharp and Karpeles encountered when they returned to the Appalachians for further fieldwork in 1917, and versions of this tune were also found by later fieldworkers.Sharp and Karpeles version published in Sharp and Karpeles (1932), vol. 2, p. 127. Two further versions of this alternative tune, collected in the 1950s, were published Brown and White (1977).Indeed, it appears that in 1916 Memory Shelton first sang this alternative tune to Sharp and Karpeles, then thought better of it, because the alternative tune appears, crossed out, at the top of the page of field notes Sharp and Karpeles made (Sharp and Karpeles 1916) when they worked with Miss Shelton. The tune of \\"On Top of Old Smoky\\" familiar to most people today was also paired with a completely different set of words in a folk song called \\"The Little Mohee\\", about a frontiersman who falls in love with an Indian maiden (or, in some versions, a sailor who falls in love with a South Seas maiden).\\"The Little Mohee\\" can be perused in Richard Chase (2014) American Folk Tales and Songs. Courier Corporation. Extract online at Google Books: . This tune was collected by the American fieldworkers Loraine Wyman and Howard Brockway in Pine Mountain, KentuckyPine Mountain, KY is likewise in the Appalachians, 72 air miles (but a three hour drive) from Allegheny, N.C., where Memory Shelton sang. Data from Google Maps. from a singer named Mary Ann Bagley,Data from the Brown University archive of Wyman's field notes (p. 7), online at . The date of the field note entry is 8 May 1916. and published by them in 1916, hence a year before the Sharp/Karpeles version mentioned above.Loraine Wyman and Howard Brockway (1916) Lonesome tunes: Folk songs from the Kentucky mountains. New York: H. W. Gray. The tune varies slightly from what is familiar today. The song may be viewed at Google Books: . Because the versions gathered in fieldwork vary so much, there is no particular version of \\"On Top of Old Smoky\\" that can lay claim to being the \\"authentic\\" or \\"original\\" version. The version that Sharp and Karpeles collected from Memory Shelton can be read online (see Sharp and Karpeles (1917), in References below), and the version by Pete Seeger that greatly popularized the song in modern times (see below) is also online.See . ===Location of \\"Old Smoky\\"=== Old Smoky is plausibly a high mountain somewhere in the southern Appalachians, since so many versions recorded by fieldworkers were collected there. Possibilities include Clingmans Dome, named \\"Smoky Dome\\" by local Scots-Irish inhabitants, but exactly which mountain it is may be lost to antiquity. == Emergence of the song in popular music == Pete Seeger in 1955 Cecil Sharp collected Appalachian folksong just before the time when this music came to be \\"discovered\\" by the outside world and sold as a commercial product by the nascent recording industryWilliams (1995) gives 1923 as the first year that a folk musician was recorded for commercial purposes; this was a recording of the North Georgia fiddler John Carson by the Okeh Record Company. Williams, Michelle Ann (1995) Great Smoky Mountains Folk Life. Jackson: University Press of Mississippi, p. 58 (this development would ultimately create the modern genre of country music). The first to make a commercial recording of \\"On Top of Old Smoky\\" was George Reneau, \\"The Blind Musician of the Smoky Mountains,\\" who worked as a busker in Knoxville, Tennessee, just west of the Appalachians. Reneau made the trip to New York City to record the song, and others, for Vocalion (Vo 15366) in 1925.Liner notes from Pete Seeger American Favorite Ballads, Vol 1, Folkways SFW CD 40150 His version of \\"On Top of Old Smoky\\" used the alternative tune noted above.His recording is posted at the \\"Joop's Musical Flowers\\" site, cited below. In the 1940s through the mid 1960s, the United States experienced a folk music revival, in which Pete Seeger was a leading figure. His music—some of it drawn from scholarly sources like SharpSee John Morrish (2007) The Folk Handbook: Working with Songs from the English Tradition. Hal Leonard Corporation, p. 180.—was popular and was disseminated widely in commercial recordings. Seeger modified a version of \\"On Top of Old Smoky\\" that he had learned in the Appalachians,Seeger was himself a fieldworker as well as performer; see Thomas A. Adler (2011) Bean Blossom: The Brown County Jamboree and Bill Monroe's Bluegrass Festivals University of Illinois Press, p. 72. In Seeger (1961:60) he says \\"I learned it from someone in the [Great] Smoky Mountains,\\" though he does not say who or when. writing new words and banjo music. He said that he thought that \\"certain verses go back to Elizabethan times.\\"Seeger's view is not implausible, since many American and English folk songs have common ancestry (see above), and the words for some English ballads are indeed preserved (as broadside ballads) from Elizabethan times. The sheet music for the song credited Seeger for \\"new words and music arrangement\\". The Weavers, a folksong singing group that Seeger had co-founded, recorded a very popular version of the song using Seeger's arrangement on 21 February 1951. It was released by Decca Records as catalog number 27515. It reached No. 2 on the Billboard chart and No. 1 on the Cash Box chart, and sold over a million copies. The song also became one of Burl Ives' signature songs, with his recording reaching No. 10 on the Billboard chart in 1951. The enormous popularity of these recordings (and others following in their wake; see below) led to the curious situation of the song re-attaining folk status; it is one of the few songs that most Americans know from childhood, and many are unaware of the mid-century recordings that promulgated it so widely.See for example . The country music singer Kenny Rogers sometimes uses the first part of \\"On Top of Old Smoky\\" as a joke in concert. The opening bars to \\"Lucille\\" (one of his biggest hits) play, with Rogers saying to the crowd something along the lines of \\"None of you know what song this is\\", when the audience reply with \\"Yes, we do\\", Rogers then begins to sing \\"On Top of Old Smoky.\\" ==Other modern versions== Following its reintroduction to America by the Weavers, the song became a standard item of popular music, sung by luminaries such as Bing Crosby,See . Perry Como,See Percy Faith, Gene Autry,For Faith and Autry see . as well as (in a brief excerpt) Elvis Presley.See . A great many versions followed in the ensuing decades. The following list is ordered chronologically. Bruce Springsteen performed the song in Portland, Oregon a few months after the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens as a tribute during The River Tour. In 1951, Swedish revue group Flickery Flies with Brita Borg recorded a Swedish version. This was during a time of collaboration with showbiz impresario and songwriter Povel Ramel who in a revue paraphrased it as Högt uppe på berget, jag har till en vän, förlorat en femma, jag lär nog aldrig se den utigen (High up on the mountain, I have to a friend, lost a 5 kronor bill, I doubt I'll see it again) . Dave Van Ronk included the song on his album The Mayor of McDougal Street: Rarities 1957–1969. This version sounds much more Celtic in nature, with more vocal ornamentation and a looser rhythmic structure. Television host Jack Narz recorded the song for his album Sing the Folk Hits With Jack Narz in 1959. In The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis episode #3.13 \\"Blue-Tail Fly\\" (ca. 1961), Dobie, Zelda and Maynard use the tune and change the lyrics to \\"The Name's Dobie Gillis\\" to use as Dobie's campaign song for his student council election bid. Bing Crosby included the song in a medley on his album 101 Gang Songs (1961) Harry Belafonte recorded a version on his 1962 album The Midnight Special. On the sleeves notes it states; 'He wrote and tried out OLD SMOKEY during his 1961 summer tour'. Alvin and the Chipmunks covered the song for their 1962 album The Chipmunk Songbook. In Germany, the tune of the song was used as the chorus to singer Manuela's hit single \\"Ich geh' noch zur Schule\\" in 1963. The recording, though, had nothing to do with the traditional heritage of the original song: \\"Ich geh' noch zur Schule\\" (meaning \\"I Still Go to School\\") tells the story of a teenage girl denying the tempting offers of a talent scout, claiming she wants to finish school first, but she might agree to a recording contract the following year after her final exams. Little Eva, singer of \\"The Loco-Motion\\", recorded a version called \\"Old Smokey Locomotion\\" (1963), with lyrics describing how the residents of Old Smokey caught on to The Locomotion. In 1964 during Beatlemania, Al Fisher & Lou Marks had \\"Paul George John And Ringo (All The Way to the Bank)\\" sung to the \\"Old Smoky\\" tune (Swan LP-514). On the 1978 Sesame Street album, Bert & Ernie Sing-Along, Grover sings a version of the song, but changes the lyrics to something about him losing his clothes, lunch, various other belongings, and his way home, but eventually finding his way home and finding his mother with all the stuff he sang about losing. In 1978, \\"On Top of Old Smokey\\" was released by Swedish pop group ABBA (with lead vocals by Frida) as part of a medley that also included \\"Pick a Bale of Cotton\\" and \\"Midnight Special\\". The medley featured as the B-side to the group's single \\"Summer Night City\\". In a 1990 episode of the American television series Twin Peaks, \\"Big Ed\\" Hurley (Everett McGill) sings the song to his hospitalized wife, Nadine (Wendy Robie). Since about 1990 fans of the English football side Notts County FC have sung the song during games, to the words 'I had a wheelbarrow, the wheel fell off'. See The Wheelbarrow Song. In 1991,:sv:Grisen i säcken Swedish comedy group(s) Galenskaparna och After Shave performed a variant in their \\"Grisen i Säcken\\" revue. Alternative country band The Gourds gangstered the lyrics to \\"On Top of Old Smoky\\" in the song \\"I'm troubled\\" on their 1998 release Gogitchyershinebox.Gourds Chords Page (archived) == Parodies == The Mexican trio in the Goofy short For Whom the Bulls Toil made in 1953, attempted to sing \\"On Top of Old Popocatépetl\\". A hit song from in 1963, \\"On Top of Spaghetti\\" by Tom Glazer, begins with the quatrain > On top of spaghetti > All covered with cheese, > I lost my poor meatball > When somebody sneezed. This version, too, seems to have entered modern folklore and is widely known to children; one source writes of the original \\"On Top of Old Smoky\\", \\"if you can listen to it and not think about spaghetti, sneezing and meatballs, more power to you.\\"See http://soundbeat.org/episode/on-top-of-old-smokey/ Some of \\"On Top of Spaghetti\\" was sung by DJ & Stephanie in an episode of the American TV series Full House and the song was performed by Snuffy in an episode of Sesame Street. The Dutch version, with as first line \\"een bord met spaghetti\\" (\\"a plate with spaghetti\\") by Rijk de Gooijer came out in 1963 as well. In his medley \\"Schticks Of One And Half A Dozen Of The Other\\" (1963), Allen Sherman sings a modified version: \\"On top of Old Smokey, all covered with hair/Of course I'm referring to Smokey the Bear.\\" == Use in classical music == In 1953, Ernő Dohnányi used the tune (and also two other traditional American folktunes) in his final composition American Rhapsody. ==See also== * American folk music * Appalachian music == Notes== ==References== *Brown, Frank, and Newman Ivey White (1977) The Frank C.

Loyset Liédet, Bruges, 1462-1470 Maugis fighting the Saracen wizard Noiron in Aigremont, in Renaud de Montaubant. David Aubert, Bruges, 1462-1470 Maugris or Maugis was one of the heroes of the chansons de geste and romances of chivalry and the Matter of France that tell of the legendary court of King Charlemagne. Maugis was cousin to Renaud de Montauban and his brothers, son of Beuves of Aygremont and brother to Vivien de Monbranc. He was brought up by Oriande the fairy, and became a great enchanter. He won the magical horse Bayard and the sword Froberge which he later gave to Renaud. ==French texts== The oldest extant version of the story of Maugris was the anonymous Old French chanson de geste Quatre Fils Aymon dating from the late 12th century. It tells the tale of the four sons of Duke Aymon (Renaud de Montauban, Guichard, Allard and Richardet), their magical horse Bayard, and their adventures and revolt against the emperor Charlemagne. From the 13th century on, other texts concerning Maugris were created; together with the original, these are grouped as the \\"Renaud de Montauban cycle\\". These poems are: Maugis d'Aigremont (story of the youth of Maugis), Mort de Maugis (story of the death of Maugis), Vivien de Monbranc (story of the brother of Maugis), Bueve d'Aigremont (story of the father of Maugis, Bueve d'Aigremont, brother to Girart de Roussillon and Doon de Nanteuil).Hasenohr and Zink, 1257-8. ==Italian texts== Along with Renaud (as Rinaldo), Maugris, as Malagi or Malagigi, is an important character in Italian Renaissance epics, including Morgante by Luigi Pulci, Orlando Innamorato by Matteo Maria Boiardo and Orlando Furioso by Ludovico Ariosto. ==References== * Hasenohr, Geneviève and Michel Zink, eds.

Its toponym is said to be derived from a Celtic cross that stood in a field outside the village, in the townland of Aughnaglea and also from its distance of six Irish miles from Omagh. The original Irish name for Sixmilecross is Na Corracha Mora, this refers to marshy ground, probably the ground that runs along the Glusha river at the back of the village. Sixmilecross is one of the few villages in County Tyrone that lost all connection with its Irish root name. It is situated in the historic barony of Omagh East and the civil parish of Termonmaguirk. The village has a wide, tree lined main street and a population of 282 in the 2001 Census. Sixmilecross is in the Omagh District Council area about south-east of Omagh. ==History== The great O'Neill dynasty of Tyrone had some connection with the area because the hill above the village was known as Tulach Uí Neill, meaning O'Neill's Hill. It lies above the Presbyterian Church in the village and is still known as Tullyneil. Tullyneil hill is said to be the geographical centre of Ulster. Sixmilecross is believed to have been established in 1634. St Michael's Church of Ireland has a stained glass window commemorating the Dunlap family, one of whom, John Dunlap printed the United States Declaration of Independence. The Portadown, Dungannon and Omagh Junction Railway (PD&O;) opened Sixmilecross railway station in September 1861 and the Ulster Transport Authority closed the station and the PD&O; line in February 1965. ==People== * Willie Anderson (rugby coach), was born here. * Mic Christopher, singer-songwriter, has maternal roots here; his mother, Vaun (née Heaney), comes from Sixmilecross. * Sixmilecross was the home of the poet W.F.

(Session transcript.) in the East End of London made him very conscious of his Jewish identity, a subject he explored throughout his literary career. Litvinoff was born to Russian Jewish parents who emigrated from Odessa to Whitechapel, London, in 1915. His father was repatriated to Russia to fight for the czar and never returned: he is thought to have been killed in the Russian Revolution. Litvinoff was the second of nine children. One of his brothers was the historian Barnet Litvinoff and his half-brother was David Litvinoff who was born to his mother's second husband Solomon Levy.Conjuring the ghost: the \\"shape-shifting, queer, violent, hippie genuis\\" of David Litvinoff. Colin McCabe, New Statesman, 29 August 2016. Retrieved 29 August 2016 Litvinoff left school at fourteen and, after working in a number of unskilled factory jobs, found himself homeless within a year. Drifting between Soho and Fitzrovia during the Depression of the 1930s, he wrote hallucinatory materials, since destroyed, and used his wits to survive. Initially a conscientious objector, Litvinoff volunteered for military service in January 1940 on discovering the extent of the persecution suffered by Jews in Europe. He was commissioned into the Pioneer Corps in August 1942. Serving in Northern Ireland, West Africa and the Middle East, he rose through the ranks quickly, being promoted to major by the age of 27. In 1942, he met Cherry Marshall at a Catterick Camp dance and they married at a register office a few months later. They had three children together but divorced in 1970. ==Poems== Litvinoff became known as a war poet during his time in the Army. The anthology Poems from the Forces, published by Routledge in 1941, included some of his poems, as did the BBC radio feature of the same title. Conscripts: A Symphonic Declaration appeared in the same year, and his first collection, The Untried Soldier, followed in 1942. A Crown for Cain, published in 1948, included his poems from West Africa and Egypt. Over the years, he contributed poems to many anthologies and periodicals, including The Terrible Rain: War Poets 1939–1945 and Stand, a magazine edited by Jon Silkin. Litvinoff was a friend and mentor to many younger poets. His poems were collected in Notes for a Survivor (1973). ===To T. S. Eliot=== Litvinoff was one of the first to raise publicly the implications of T. S. Eliot's negative references to Jews in a number of his poems, in his own poem \\"To T. S. Eliot\\". Litvinoff, an admirer of Eliot, was appalled to find Eliot republishing lines he had written in the 1920s about \\"money in furs\\" and the \\"protozoic slime\\" of Bleistein's \\"lustreless, protrusive eye\\" only a few years after the Holocaust, in his Selected Poems of 1948. When Litvinoff got up to announce the poem at a poetry reading for the Institute of Contemporary Arts in 1951 the event's host, Sir Herbert Read, declared, \\"Oh Good, Tom's just come in,\\" referring to Eliot. Despite feeling \\"nervous\\",Hannah Burman, \\"Emanuel Litvinoff: Full Interview\\", London's Voices: Voices Online, Museum of London, conducted on 11 March 1998, accessed 7 July 2008. Litvinoff decided that \\"the poem was entitled to be read\\" and proceeded to recite it to the packed but silent room: > So shall I say it is not eminence chills > but the snigger from behind the covers of history, > the sly words and the cold heart > and footprints made with blood upon a continent? > Let your words > tread lightly on this earth of Europe > lest my people’s bones protest.Excerpt from \\"To T. S. Eliot\\", in Emanuel > Litvinoff, Journey Through A Small Planet (London: Penguin Classics, 2008). In the pandemonium after Litvinoff read the poem Eliot reportedly stated, \\"It's a good poem, it's a very good poem.\\"As quoted in Dannie Abse, A Poet in the Family (London: Hutchinson, 1974), p. 203. ===Struma=== Litvinoff is also known for his poem \\"Struma\\", written after the Struma disaster. Volunteering for military service in January 1940, Litvinoff saw his membership of the British Army as a straightforward matter of combating Nazi evil, but the sinking of the Struma in February 1942 complicated this. An old schooner with an unreliable second-hand engine, the Struma had left Romania in December 1941 crowded with nearly 800 Jewish refugees escaping the Nazis. After engine failure on the Black Sea she was towed into Istanbul harbour. Her passengers hoped to travel overland to Palestine, but Turkey forbade them to disembark unless Britain allowed them to settle in Palestine. British authorities rejected the refugees' request, and after weeks of deadlock Turkish authorities towed the Struma back into the Black Sea and set her adrift. The next day, 24 February 1942, she exploded and sank, leaving an estimated 791 dead and only one survivor. It emerged years later that the Struma had been torpedoed by a Soviet submarine. This was unknown at the time, and Litvinoff believed that the British were responsible. The disaster \\"blurred the frontiers of evil\\" in a way that left him reluctant to describe himself as \\"English\\" or to seek the kind of assimilation achieved by other Jewish writers in Britain. The poem contains the lines: > Today my khaki is a badge of shame, > Its duty meaningless; my name > Is Moses and I summon plague to Pharaoh. > Today my mantle is Sorrow and O > My crown is Thorn. I sit darkly with the years > And centuries of years, bowed by my heritage of tears. > ==Novels== After the war Litvinoff briefly worked as a ghostwriter for Louis Golding, writing most or all of The Bareknuckle Breed and To the Quayside, before going on to write his own novels. Litvinoff's novels explore the issue of Jewish identity across decades and in a variety of geographical contexts; Britain, Germany, the Soviet Union and Israel. ===The Lost Europeans=== Ten years after the war Litvinoff went to live in Berlin. He described it as \\"a strangely exhilarating experience, like being under fire\\".Back cover, first edition of The Lost Europeans, Vanguard Press 1960. The Lost Europeans (1960) was Litvinoff's first novel and was born out of this experience. Set in post- war Berlin, it follows the return of two Jews to Berlin after the Holocaust. One returns for both symbolic and material restitution, the other for revenge on the man who betrayed him. ===The Man Next Door=== The Man Next Door (1968), described by The New York Times as \\"the British answer to Portnoy's Complaint\\", tackles British suburban anti-Semitism. Set in the fictional Home Counties town of Maidenford, it features a despondent middle-aged vacuum cleaner salesman who sees his new neighbours, wealthy self-made Jews, as the root of his problems and wages an escalating campaign of hatred against them. === Journey Through A Small Planet=== Perhaps Litvinoff's best-known work is probably Journey Through a Small Planet (1972), in which he chronicled his working-class Jewish childhood and early adult years in the East End, a small cluster of streets that was right next to the City of London, but had more in common with the cities of Kiev, Kharkov and Odessa. Litvinoff describes the overcrowded tenements of Brick Lane and Whitechapel, the smells of pickled herring and onion bread, the rattle of sewing machines, and chatter in Yiddish. He also relates stories of his parents, who fled from Russia in 1914, his experiences at school and a brief flirtation with Communism. === The Faces of Terror Trilogy=== The trilogy Faces of Terror follows a pair of young revolutionaries from the streets of the East End and their political passage over the years to Stalinist Russia. The first novel, A Death Out of Season (1973), is set around the Siege of Sidney Street and the fermenting anarchism of East London. The novel describes youth seduced by revolution through the characters Peter the Painter and Lydia Alexandrova, a young aristocrat who rebels against her class. Blood on the Snow (1975), the sequel, finds Lydia and Peter now committed Bolsheviks, in the chaos of famine and civil war in the aftermath of the Russian Revolution. The final instalment of the trilogy, The Face of Terror (1978), is set under the regime of Stalin, where revolution has turned into repression, and the ideals of freedom that Peter and Lydia once had have crumbled under the weight of guilt and disillusion. === Falls the Shadow === Falls the Shadow (1983) was a controversial novel, written because Litvinoff had become concerned at how he considered Israel to be invoking the memory of the Holocaust to justify its own outrages. Its narrative concerns an apparently distinguished and benign Israeli citizen who is assassinated in the street, then found to have been a concentration camp officer who had escaped using the identity of one of his victims. ==Plays== During the 1960s and 1970s Litvinoff wrote plays prolifically for television, in particular Armchair Theatre. His play The World in a Room tackled the subject of interracial marriage. ==Campaign for Soviet Jewry== Emanuel Litvinoff (right) alongside \\"Nazi Hunter\\" Simon Wiesenthal (centre) and British MP Barnett Janner (left) at meeting in solidarity with Jews in Russia, Amsterdam, 1970 Although he was a successful poet, novelist and screenwriter, the majority of Litvinoff's career was spent spearheading a worldwide campaign for the liberation of Soviet Jewry. In the 1950s, on a visit to Russia with his first wife, Cherry Marshall, and her fashion show, Litvinoff became aware of the plight of persecuted Soviet Jews, and started a worldwide campaign against this persecution. One of his methods was editing the newsletter Jews in Eastern Europe and also lobbying eminent figures of the twentieth century such as Bertrand Russell, Jean-Paul Sartre, and others to join the campaign. Due to Litvinoff's efforts, prominent Jewish groups in the United States became aware of the issue, and the well-being of Soviet Jews became cause for a worldwide campaign, eventually leading to the mass migration of Jews from the Soviet Union to Israel and the United States. For this he has been described by Meir Rosenne, a former Israeli ambassador to the United States, as \\"one of the greatest unsung heroes of the twentieth century... who won in the fight against an evil empire\\" and that \\"thousands and thousands of Russian Jews owe him their freedom\\". ==Bibliography== *Conscripts (1941) *The Untried Soldier (1942) *A Crown for Cain (1948) poems *The Lost Europeans (1960) *The Man Next Door (1968) *Journey Through a Small Planet (1972) *A Death Out of Season (1973) *Notes for a Survivor (1973) *Soviet Anti-Semitism: The Paris Trial (1974) *Blood on the Snow (1975) *The Face of Terror (1978) *The Penguin Book of Jewish Short Stories (1979) editor *Falls the Shadow (1983) ==References== ==Sources== ;Interviews *Interview with Emanuel Litvinoff, 25 Jun 2011\\"; *Burman, Hannah. \\"Emanuel Litvinoff: Full Interview\\".

Graphplan takes as input a planning problem expressed in STRIPS and produces, if one is possible, a sequence of operations for reaching a goal state. The name graphplan is due to the use of a novel planning graph, to reduce the amount of search needed to find the solution from straightforward exploration of the state space graph. In the state space graph: * the nodes are possible states, * and the edges indicate reachability through a certain action. On the contrary, in Graphplan's planning graph: * the nodes are actions and atomic facts, arranged into alternate levels, * and the edges are of two kinds: *# from an atomic fact to the actions for which it is a condition, *# from an action to the atomic facts it makes true or false. the first level contains true atomic facts identifying the initial state. Lists of incompatible facts that cannot be true at the same time and incompatible actions that cannot be executed together are also maintained. The algorithm then iteratively extends the planning graph, proving that there are no solutions of length l-1 before looking for plans of length l by backward chaining: supposing the goals are true, Graphplan looks for the actions and previous states from which the goals can be reached, pruning as many of them as possible thanks to incompatibility information. A closely related approach to planning is the Planning as Satisfiability (Satplan). Both reduce the automated planning problem to search for plans of different fixed horizon lengths. ==References== *A. Blum and M. Furst (1997). Fast planning through planning graph analysis.

He was in Scotland in the King's service in June 1291. In April 1294 he had a writ of protection from the King when he travelled overseas with the King's daughter, Eleanor of Bar. He served in Gascony in 1295 and 1296, and was present at the action around Bordeaux on 28 March 1296, when his standard bearer was captured by the French. In 1297 he was summoned for service in the Franco-Flemish War, and attended Councils in Rochester and London in that year. ===War against the Scots=== He was summoned for service against the Scots in 1297-1313. He fought in the Vanguard at the Battle of Falkirk on 22 July 1298. King Edward's army at that battle consisted of 12,000 infantry, including 10,000 Welsh, and 2,000 cavalry. William Wallace, the Scottish leader accepted battle in a withdrawn defensive position. Wallace had few cavalry and few archers; but his solid \\"schiltrons\\" (circles) of spearmen were almost invincible. The armoured cavalry of the English vanguard were hurled back with severe losses. Edward brought up his Welsh archers in the intervals between the horsemen of the second line, concentrating their arrows on specific points in the Scottish schiltrons. It was into these gaps that the English knights forced their way, and once the Scottish order was broken the spearmen were quickly massacred. ===Siege of Caerlaverock=== Alan was at the siege of Caerlaverock Castle in July 1300. His presence is recorded in the contemporary \\"Caerlaverock Poem\\", being an early roll of arms: :Aleyn de la Souche tresor Signiioit ke fust brians Sa rouge baniere a besans Car bienscai ki a dependu Tresor plus ke en burce pendu \\"Sa rouge baniere a bezants\\" (as re-stated in modern French) \\"his red banner bezantée\\", is the description of the coat of arms he bore at the siege. ==Subsequent career== He was summoned to Edward II's coronation on 18 January 1307/08. In December of that year he had a protection to go on a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela. He was the Constable of Rockingham Castle and the Keeper of the forests between the bridges of Oxford and Stamford. ==Marriage and issue== He married Eleanor de Segrave, daughter of Nicholas de Segrave, 1st Baron Segrave. At his death he left no male progeny and the barony went into abeyance between his three daughters and co-heiresses: *Ellen la Zouche, married Alan de Charlton; also married Nicholas de St Maur, 1st Baron St Maur (d.1316)Burke, John, A General and Heraldic Dictionary of the Peerages of England, Ireland, and Scotland Extinct, Dormant and in Abeyance, London, 1831, pp.461-2, Baron St Maur *Maud la Zouche, married Robert de Holland, 1st Baron Holand; she was the mother of Thomas Holland, who married Joan of Kent. *Elizabeth la Zouche, married John Ingham (1320-12 Dec. 1365), son of Oliver de Ingham (1294–1344). ==References== Category:1267 births Category:1314 deaths Category:Barons in the Peerage of England ","title":"Alan la Zouche, 1st Baron Zouche of Ashby"},{"id":"2546404","text":"BLZ may mean: * Belize * IATA airport code for Chileka International Airport, Blantyre, Malawi * Bankleitzahl, a numbering system for German and Austrian banks ","title":"BLZ"},{"id":"2546405","text":"\\"Jezebel\\" is a 1951 popular song written by American songwriter Wayne Shanklin.

As Dionysius of Halicarnassus (Judicium de Thucydide, c. 23) distinctly states that the work current in his time under the name of Cadmus was a forgery, it is most probable that the two first are identical with the Phoenician Cadmus, who, as the reputed inventor of letters, was subsequently transformed into the Milesian and the author of an historical work. In this connection it should be observed that the old Milesian nobles traced their descent back to the Phoenician or one of his companions. The text of the notice of the third Cadmus of Miletus in the Suda is unsatisfactory; and it is uncertain whether he is to be explained in the same way, or whether he was an historical personage, of whom all further record is lost. == Attribution == * == External links == * Category:Creators of writing systems Category:Ancient Milesians Category:Early Greek historians ","title":"Cadmus of Miletus"},{"id":"2546419","text":"Margaret Hayes (born Florette Regina Ottenheimer; December 5, 1916 – January 26, 1977) was an American film, stage, and television actress. ==Early years== Hayes was born in Baltimore, Maryland (some sources say Pottsville, Pennsylvania). http://www.glamourgirlsofthesilverscreen.com/show/419/Margaret+Hayes/index.html Her father was Jack Lewis Ottenheimer, a \\"musician, theatrical man, and joke- book writer.\\" (Some sources say that he was a real estate broker.)

At the school, she joined \\"The Barnstormers\\", a theatrical organization, becoming the first female member of that group. ===Changing names=== Using the name \\"Dana Dale\\", Hayes found work as a model, \\"featured in the best cigarette, auto, and fashion advertisements\\". Her screen test for the role of Scarlett O'Hara in Gone with the Wind was unsuccessful, but she received a movie contract, anyway. Publicists at her studio recommended \\"Dana Edwards\\" as a better name for movies, so she began using it. Eventually, she changed to Margaret Hayes for public purposes, and was called Maggie by her friends. ==Film== Hayes' initial contract was with Warner Bros. Having little success there, she signed with Paramount Pictures. Hayes was often billed as Maggie Hayes in her film credits. She is perhaps best known for her role as Lois Judby Hammond in the 1955 film Blackboard Jungle, which starred Glenn Ford. In 1956, she guest- starred as Dora Hand in three episodes of The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp. She appeared in the episode \\"The San Saba Incident\\" (October 18, 1957) of Trackdown, playing a female convict, named Abby Lindon.Billy Hathorn, \\"Roy Bean, Temple Houston, Bill Longley, Ranald Mackenzie, Buffalo Bill, Jr., and the Texas Rangers: Depictions of West Texans in Series Television, 1955 to 1967\\", West Texas Historical Review, Vol. 89 (2013), pp. 105-06 Hayes' films included The Glass Key, Sullivan's Travels, and Good Day for a Hanging. In 1958, in the film Damn Citizen, Hayes appeared opposite Keith Andes in the role of a real person, Dorothy Maguire Grevemberg, the wife of the crusading Louisiana State Police superintendent Francis Grevemberg. She made four guest appearances on CBS's Perry Mason, including as defendant Sybil Granger in 1957 episode \\"The Case of the Nervous Accomplice\\". In 1961, she portrayed Mrs. North in the episode \\"Incident of the Night on the Town\\" on CBS\\"s Rawhide. In the same year, she also guest-starred in an episode of Bonanza, \\"The Countess\\", as Lady Linda Chadwick. ==Journalism== After marrying Herbert Bayard Swope in 1946, Hayes temporarily retired from acting and turned to journalism, eventually becoming assistant fashion editor for Life. ==Radio== In her later years, Hayes lived in Palm Beach, Florida, and was the host of a daily radio talk show on WPBR. ==Personal life== Hayes had her first child, a daughter Nan (born 1937), from her brief first marriage to Charles DeBuskey. The couple divorced in 1939, and Hayes subsequently married actor Leif Erickson on June 12, 1942, eloping with him to Minden, Nevada. They separated 28 days later, and Hayes received a divorce on October 2, 1942. She married a third time, to producer Herbert B. Swope, Jr. (son of three-time winner of the Pulitzer Prize for Reporting, journalist Herbert Swope), in 1947. The couple had a daughter, actress Tracy Brooks Swope (born 1953), and a son, Herbert Swope III. Swope and she divorced in 1973. ==Death== Hayes died January 25, 1977, aged 60, in Mount Sinai Medical Center in Miami Beach, Florida. ==Partial filmography== *The Man Who Talked Too Much (1940) - Governor's Secretary *Ladies Must Live (1940) - Chorus Girl *Money and the Woman (1940) - Depositor (uncredited) *City for Conquest (1940) - Sally - Irene's Friend (uncredited) *Tugboat Annie Sails Again (1940) - Rosie *In Old Colorado (1941) - Myra Woods *Henry Aldrich for President (1941) - Miss Patterson (uncredited) *New York Town (1941) - Lola Martin (uncredited) *Skylark (1941) - Blake's Receptionist (uncredited) *The Night of January 16th (1941) - Nancy Wakefield *Sullivan's Travels (1941) - Secretary *Louisiana Purchase (1941) - Louisiana Belle *The Lady Has Plans (1942) \\\\- Rita Lenox *Saboteur (1942) - Henry's Wife in Movie (uncredited) *Take a Letter, Darling (1942) - Sally French *The Glass Key (1942) - Eloise Matthews *Scattergood Survives a Murder (1943) \\\\- Gail Barclay * Stand By All Networks (1942) - Lela Cramer *One Dangerous Night (1943) - Patricia Blake Shannon *They Got Me Covered (1943) - Lucille *Blackboard Jungle (1955) - Lois Judby Hammond *Violent Saturday (1955) - Mrs. Emily Fairchild *The Bottom of the Bottle (1956) - Lil Breckinridge *From the Desk of Margaret Tyding (1956) *Omar Khayyam (1957) - Queen Zarada *Damn Citizen (1958) - Dorothy Grevemberg *The Case Against Brooklyn (1958) - Lil Polombo née Alexander *Girl in the Woods (1958) - Bell Cory *Fräulein (1958) - Lt.

Early experiments were done in 1708 by Ehrenfried Walther von Tschirnhaus. After his death that October, Johann Friedrich Böttger continued von Tschirnhaus's work and brought this type of porcelain to the market, financed by Augustus the Strong, King of Poland and Elector of Saxony. The production of porcelain in the royal factory at Meissen, near Dresden, started in 1710 and attracted artists and artisans to establish, arguably, the most famous porcelain manufacturer known throughout the world. Its signature logo, the crossed swords, was introduced in 1720 to protect its production; the mark of the swords is reportedly one of the oldest trademarks in existence. In English Dresden porcelain was once the usual term for these wares, especially the figures; this is because Meissen is geographically not far from Dresden which is the Saxon capital. Vittorio Amadeo II, King of Sardinia (1666–1732) by Augustus the Strong, owner of the Meissen factory Meissen remained the dominant European porcelain factory, and the leader of stylistic innovation, until somewhat overtaken by the new styles introduced by the French Sèvres factory in the 1760s, but has remained a leading factory to the present day. Among the developments pioneered by Meissen are the porcelain figurines, and the introduction of European decorative styles to replace the imitation of Asian decoration of its earliest wares. ==Beginnings== Albrechtsburg castle in Meissen Chinese porcelain had gradually developed over centuries, and by the seventeenth century both Chinese and Japanese export porcelain were imported to Europe on a large scale by the Dutch East India Company and its equivalents in other countries. It was a very expensive product by the time it reached European customers, and represented wealth, importance and refined taste in Europe. European attempts to produce porcelain, such as the brief experiment that produced Medici porcelain in Florence, had met with failure.Battie, 86-87 At the beginning of the eighteenth century Johann Friedrich Böttger pretended he had solved the dream of the alchemists, to produce gold from worthless materials. When King Augustus II of Poland heard of it, he kept him in protective custody and requested him to produce gold. For years Johann Friedrich Böttger was unsuccessful in this effort. At the same time, Ehrenfried Walther von Tschirnhaus, a mathematician and scientist, experimented with the manufacture of glass, trying to make porcelain as well. Crucially, his ingredients included kaolin, the vital ingredient of true porcelain, though he was unable to use it successfully.Battie, 88 Tschirnhaus supervised Böttger and by 1707 Böttger reluctantly started to help in the experiments by Tschirnhaus. When Tschirnhaus suddenly died, the recipe apparently was handed over to Böttger, who within one week announced to the King that he could make porcelain. Böttger refined the formula and with some Dutch co-workers, experienced in firing and painting tiles, the stage was set for the manufacturing of porcelain. In 1709, the King established the Royal- Polish and Electoral-Saxon Porcelain Manufactory (Königlich-Polnische und Kurfürstlich-Sächsische Porzellan- Manufaktur),http://www.starcookers.com/magazin/orte-zum-geniessen/meissner- porzellan/ (dead Link) placed Böttger's laboratory at Albrechtsburg castle in Meissen and production started officially in 1710. ==Early work== Böttger stoneware medal of 1935 for the 225th anniversary of the factory in Meissen; the obverse portrays the inventor of the stoneware, Johann Friedrich Böttger The first type of ware produced by Böttger was a refined and extremely hard red stoneware known as \\"Böttger ware\\" in English (in German Böttgersteinzeug). This copied Chinese Yixing ware, and like that was especially used for teapots, and now coffee pots. Similar wares had been made by the Dutch and the Elers brothers in England. Böttger's version was harder than any of these,Battie, 88 and retained very crisp definition in its cast or applied (\\"sprigged\\") details, on bodies that could be polished to a gloss before firing. Models were derived from Baroque silver shapes and Chinese ceramic examples. There was also a softer stoneware, which was glazed and decorated.Battie, 88 Meissen's production of a hard paste white porcelain that could be glazed and painted soon followed, and wares were put on the market in 1713. Dish with Chinese scene and laub- und bandelwerk surrounds, 1720s Böttger's experimental wares rapidly gained quality but never achieved successful painted and fired decor. The first successful ornaments were gold decorations applied upon the fired body and finely engraved before they received a second firing at a lower temperature. The lacy frameworks outside painted scenes known in German as Laub- und bandelwerk in red, gold or puce, were often used.Battie, 89 Augustus II charged first Johann Jakob Irminger with the design of new vessels. In 1720 Johann Gregor Herold became the director and in 1723 introduced brilliant overglaze colours that made Meissen porcelain famous, with an increasingly broad palette of colors that marked the beginning of the classic phase of Meissen porcelain. His enamel paints are still the basis for ceramic paints today. Initially painting mostly imitated the oriental designs known from Chinese and Japanese export porcelain, but some European landscape scenes were painted from early on.Battie, 89 The signature underglaze \\"Meissen Blue\\" was introduced by Friedrich August Köttig. Soon minutely detailed landscapes and port scenes, animals, flowers, galante courtly scenes and chinoiseries, fanciful Chinese-inspired decorations, were to be found on Meissen porcelain. The Kakiemon floral decoration of vases and tea wares in Japanese export porcelain were combined with Chinese famille verte to create a style known as Indianische Blume (\\"Indian Flowers\\"); Augustus had large collections of both Chinese and Japanese porcelain. Coloured grounds with decoration painted on white in panels appear in the 1730s.Battie, 89 Paintings by Watteau were copied. Wares were also sold with plain glazed colors, usually white, to be enamelled in private workshops (Hausmalerei), many in Augsburg and Bayreuth, and independently retailed.Battie, 93-94 The support of Augustus' patronage attracted to Meissen some of the finest painters and modellers of Europe as staff artists. ;Up to 1725 File:Cafetière Décor relief Meissen 1710 Kunstgewerbemuseum Berlin 05052018.jpgBöttger stoneware coffeepot, c. 1710-13 Augustus the Strong MET DT5148.jpgBöttger stoneware figure of Augustus the Strong, c. 1713 Pagoda Figure LACMA 87.5.2.jpgOriental figure, c. 1715 Meissen Teekanne KGM 27-17.jpgTeapot, 1718–20, with \\"Oriental\\" flowers Vase (one of a pair) MET DP155994.jpgOne of a pair of vases, 1720–25 Wine pot in the shape of a peach (cadogan type) MET DP149937 (cropped).jpgWine pot in the shape of a peach, c. 1725 Meissen Porcelain Manufactory - Teapot - Walters 482781 - Side A (cropped).jpgTeapot, Circa 1724-25, Walters Art Museum File:Johann Gregor Herold - Saki Bottle - 1989.173.2 - Cleveland Museum of Art.jpgSake bottle vase, painted by Johann Gregor Herold, 1725 ==Famous trademark== Meissen trademarks The Albrechtsburg was utilized to protect the secrets of the manufacture of the white gold. As a further precaution, very few workers knew the special secret (arcanum) of how to make porcelain, and then perhaps only part of the process. Thus, for a few years, Meissen retained its monopoly on the production of hard-paste porcelain in Europe. By 1717, however, a competing production was set up at Vienna, as Samuel Stöltzel, head of the craftsmen and arcanist at Meissen, sold the secret recipe, which involved the use of kaolin, also known as china clay. By 1760 about thirty porcelain manufacturers were operating in Europe, most of them, however, producing frit based soft-paste porcelain. In order to identify the original Meissen products, Meissen developed markings that initially were painted on, but were soon fired in underglaze blue. Early markings such as AR (Augustus Rex, the monogram of the King), K.P.M. (Königliche Porzellan-Manufaktur), M.P.M. (Meissener Porzellan-Manufaktur), and K.P.F. (\\"Königliche Porzellan-Fabrik) were eventually replaced by the crossed swords logo, based on the arms of the Elector of Saxony as Arch-Marshal of the Holy Roman Empire. Introduced in 1720, the logo was used consistently after 1731 by official decree. Variations in the logo allow approximate dating of the wares. However, in the 18th century, the mark was not considered important, and it was commonly painted on in a crude manner. It wasn't until the \\"dot period\\" when a gentleman asked that the mark be adjusted to look older that the factory got serious about mark control. ==Artistic development== Bowl with European harbour scene, c. 1735 Part of a table centrepiece, 1727-28 After Irminger, the next chief modeller, Johann Jakob Kirchner, was the first to make large-scale statues and figurines, especially of Baroque saints. His assistant was Johann Joachim Kaendler; in 1733 Kirchner resigned, and Kaendler took over as chief modeller, remaining in place until his death in 1775, and becoming the most famous of the Meissen modellers. Under his direction Meissen produced the series of small figurines, which brought out the best of the new material (see below). His menagerie of large-scale animals, left in the white, are some of the high points of European porcelain manufacture. His work resulted in the production of exquisite figurines in the rococo style that influenced porcelain making in all of Europe. He was supported by assistants like Johann Friedrich Eberlein and Peter Reinecke. In 1756, during the Seven Years' War, Prussian troops occupied Meissen, giving Frederick II of Prussia the opportunity to relocate some of the artisans to establish the Königliche Porzellan Manufaktur Berlin. With the changing tastes of the neoclassical period and the rise of Sèvres porcelain in the 1760s, Meissen had to readjust its production, and in the reorganization from 1763, C.W.E. Dietrich of the Dresden Academy became artistic director and Michel-Victor Acier from France became the modelmaster. The practice of impressing numerals that correspond to moulds in the inventory books began in 1763. ==Marcolini period== Sèvres styles and ventures into Neoclassicism, such as unglazed matte biscuit porcelain wares that had the effect of white marble, marked the manufactory's output under Count Camillo Marcolini, who ran the factory from 1774 to 1813, when after the Battle of Leipzig he followed Frederick Augustus I of Saxony into exile, dying in Prague the next year. Meissen wares were slightly reduced in quality, and considerably in quantity during this period, as both Austria and Prussia banned imports, and Britain, France and Russia placed high tariffs on imports - all now had their own industries to protect.Battie, 158-159 ==19th-century== In the nineteenth century Ernst August Leuteritz modernized many of the rococo figurines, and reissued them, creating a \\"Second Rococo\\" characterized by lacework details (made from actual lace dipped in slip and fired) and applied flowers. After about 1830 the fortunes of the factory revived, although with wares that appeal less to modern taste than the 18th-century ones. The factory had great commercial success with the lithophane technique, introduced in 1829, which produced a picture when held up to the light.Battie, 159-160 ==20th-century== Under Erich Hösel, who became head of the modelling department in 1903, old styles were revived and reinterpreted. Hösel also restored eighteenth century models. Some appealing work in the Art Nouveau style was produced, but Meissen's mainstay continued to be the constant production of revived eighteenth-century models. After 1933, the artistic freedom of the artists became restricted by the State of Saxony in accordance with the contemporary indoctrination process in Germany. Some artists (i.e. Ernst Barlach) who had contributed to progressive Meissen during the Weimar period were banned. After World War II and under Communist rule, the manufactory that had always catered to the rich and wealthy had some difficulty to find its way. The danger was that Meissen would become a factory merely producing for the masses. It was not until 1969, when Karl Petermann became the director, that Meissen went back to focus on its old traditions and was also allowed a freer artistic expression. ==Figures== Kändler \\"crinoline group\\", c. 1745 Figurines had been produced under Böttger, when a small white figure of Augustus II the Strong was produced. Johann Joachim Kändler modelled many of the most famous figures, which were initially made for decorating the tables at grand meals, usually in white, replacing sugar sculptures. However, they soon became very popular as ornaments for living rooms and were cheaper than an entire table service, so available to a rather wider market, both in terms of geography and social class. Kändler soon had them brightly painted, increasing their attraction. Human figures were mostly courtiers, shepherds and shepherdesses (Dresden shepherdess is a proverbial term), commedia dell'arte characters, animals, personifications or \\"allegorical figures\\" (such the seasons, virtues, or continents) and figures in Chinese and Turkish costumes. As well as the pastoral fantasy shepherdesses there were also some more realistic figures of urban workers, based on print series of the street cries of Paris, London and other cities. In the 1750s a large series of miners was produced. The Meissen repertoire had a huge influence on other European porcelain factories, and the porcelain figure is a defining object for the Rococo.Battie, 91-92 Kändler also produced a modello of Augustus III of Poland on a horse which was intended to be a life size statue for the city. There is an all white figure of the Triumph of Amphitrite in Berlin that is the only known figure signed by Kändler. A famous large group, or menagerie, of animal figures were ordered by Augustus for the Japanese Palace he was building in the 1720s. Kändler took the series over in 1733, and modelled most of the figures. These were often many times the size of most figures, and making them posed great technical problems. Nonetheless, when seen as a group they were a sight that astonished and impressed visitors.Battie, 91 Smaller figures of animals, especially birds, were also very popular. The \\"Monkey Band\\" (Affenkapelle or \\"ape orchestra\\" in German), are a comic group of figures of monkey musicians, and a larger excited conductor, all in fancy contemporary costumes. They were first modelled by Kändler and Reinicke in 1753-54, with a later set in the 1760s. They were copied by Chelsea porcelain and others.Battie, 91-92 Such singerie were popular in various media.

Initial services were plain, but Kaendler soon introduced matching decorations. Kaendler also produced the 1745 \\"New Cutout\\" pattern, characterized by a wavy edge cut, and is presumed to have designed the much- copied osier pattern of a relief border imitating a woven wicker or osier fence. Initially relatively small tea and coffee services were the most produced, but from the 1730s large armorial porcelain dinner services began to be made, initially for Augustus, but then other buyers in Germany and abroad.Battie, 90 They also became used for diplomatic gifts. Maria Amalia of Saxony, granddaughter of Augustus, married the King of the Three Sicilies, later Charles III of Spain, and her dowry is said to have included 17 Meissen table services, inspiring the couple to found the Capodimonte porcelain factoruy in Naples.Le Corbellier, 20 The most famous of these is the Swan Service (Schwanenservice) made in 1737-43, for the manufactory's director, Count Heinrich von Brühl;Battie, 90 It eventually numbered more than a thousand pieces. At the end of World War II, the pieces of the Swan Service were scattered amongst collectors and museums. Yet, with the moulds still available, the pattern continues to be made today. The Möllendorff Dinner Service of the 1760s is another huge service, also today divided between many collections. The Blue Onion pattern (in fact copying Chinese pomegranates) has been in production for close to three centuries. It was effectively designed by Höroldt in 1739 and is probably inspired by a Chinese bowl from the Kangxi period. Widely popular, the pattern has been copied extensively by over sixty companies; some of those competitors have even used the word Meissen as a marking. But the pattern became so popular and widespread that the German Supreme Court in 1926 ruled that the Meissen Zwiebelmuster was in the public domain. A series of \\"Court Dragon\\" and \\"Red Dragon\\" tableware patterns features Chinese dragons, generally in underglaze red with gilt details flying around the rim of the plate and with a medallion in the center of the cavetto. A version of this pattern was used in Hitler's Kehlsteinhaus retreat. Other popular patterns still in production include the Purple Rose pattern and the Vine-leaf pattern.

At the beginning the Meissen manufactory was owned by the King of Saxony; by 1830 it came to belong to the State of Saxony. After World War II, most of the equipment was sent to the Soviet Union as part of war reparations. However, already by 1946, the workers using traditional methods and the kilns that had not been dismantled were able to resume production. The company became a Soviet Joint Stock Company in Germany. Almost all of the production was sent to the Soviet Union, a crucial step that kept the artisan community alive. After the establishment of the German Democratic Republic, the company was handed over to German ownership in 1950 and became a people- owned company. VEB Meissen Porzellan turned out to be one of the few profitable companies in the economically troubled East German system, earning much needed foreign currency. After the German reunification in 1990, the company was restored to the State of Saxony which is the sole owner. While its products are expensive, the high quality and artistic value make Meissen porcelain desirable by collectors and connoisseurs. ==Meissen collections== The rarity and expense of Meissen porcelain meant that originally it could be bought only by the upper classes; this gradually changed over the 19th century. When a wealthy class emerged in the United States in the nineteenth century, such families as the Vanderbilts started their own collections. Many of these collections then found their way into the world's great museums.Meissen Encyclopaedia Laurence Mitchell.

On 16 May 2006, Draper announced that he had been diagnosed with cancer during fourth album sessions at Rockfield Studios. After a blister appeared on his left hand middle finger that kept bleeding, Draper visited a local doctor who took a sample of tissue from the finger. He was informed that it was a malignant tumour known as a \\"Bowenoid Malignancy\\", and responded positively to five cycles of chemotherapy. However, he was unable to play for several months after the tumour was cut out and his finger swelled up following treatment. === Musical influences === ==== The Beatles/ Prince ==== As a young man, Paul cited The Beatles as his favourite band and referenced Abbey Road as an influence with the song structures of their 1969 album (in particular tracks like 'She's So Heavy') - \\"It wasn't standard verse chorus, verse chorus and that really interested me\\". He also listened to his sister's copy of Pink Floyd's The Dark Side Of The Moon to which he affectionately described as 'odd'. Prince is his all time number one artist with Purple Rain being a particular favourite . \\"There is real elements of progressive rock in that\\" says Draper . 'Attack Of The Grey Lantern' and 'Six' would later come to reflect these influences. In 2018 he said \\"If you put my Dad's and my sisters' record collections together, well, I reckon that's how you get Mansun\\" ===Post-Mansun career=== ==== Production work==== In October 2005, \\"Alone in My Room\\", a single by Skin (Skunk Anansie), co-written and co-produced by Draper, was released; his first involvement in any musical project since Kleptomania. He worked on a version of the 2006 Ibiza anthem \\"Exceeder\\" by the Dutch DJ Mason, which was uploaded to his MySpace page, and in 2009 produced and appeared on a track by The Joy Formidable, which was made available as a free download from the band's official website. Draper performed a version of Mansun's \\"Wide Open Space\\" at London Astoria's last ever gig before it closed on 14 January 2009 with My Vitriol. The two acts had toured together previously in 2000, along with King Adora. In October 2013, Draper stated that he was considering releasing material from his abandoned unrecorded solo album \\"Spooky Action At A Distance\\" which only existed in demo form, if there was enough interest. After a petition was set up on Facebook, he responded that he was going to give the idea of releasing solo material some \\"very serious consideration\\". On 5 May 2014, the debut single \\"What Goes Around\\" by The Anchoress was released. A collaboration between Draper and singer-songwriter Catherine AD (Catherine Anne Davies), the duo have recorded an album's worth of material with Draper having co-written several of the songs and co-produced the whole album. A follow up to the single is due for release on 20 October in the form of EP \\"One For Sorrow\\". In 2017, Davies reciprocally co-wrote 5 tracks on Draper's solo album Spooky Action. ===Solo career=== Draper's first solo song \\"Feeling My Heart Run Slow\\" was premiered at a Mansun convention held at The Live Rooms in Chester on 23 August 2014. Recorded especially to play at the convention, Draper with the help of musicians from The Anchoress sessions, recorded five songs from his unrecorded solo album with a view to completing a whole album's worth. Draper announced his first solo single would be released via monthly subscription service 'The Too Pure Singles Club' in April 2016. It was announced that the official release of his EP One would be on Kscope on 10 June 2016. On 25 November 2016, Draper released EP Two featuring lead track ‘Friends Make The Worst Enemies ‘ which was met with more praise - \\"A sprightly, electro-infused solo single\\" - NME, Tracks of the Week\\" ...a significant step back into the spotlight from a generally underappreciated talent.\\" - Prog Magazine and \\"...an unmistakable voice and an ear for utterly addictive melody whatever the musical setting.\\" - Louder Than War . His full length album, Spooky Action, was released on 11 August 2017.With huge fan support, the album was nominated for Album of the Year at the annual Progressive Music Awards. Spooky Action emerged to rave reviews and Top 20 chart success with the response so strong that the singer/guitarist's label, Kscope, decided to embark on a major Mansun reissue campaign. EP Three was released as a digital download only on March 16, 2018 featuring a reworked single version of ‘Jealousy Is A Powerful Emotion’ backed with acoustic versions of ‘ Jealousy Is A Powerful Emotion’ and ‘Things People Want’ .A Public Service Broadcasting remix of ‘Friends Make The Worst Enemies’ completed the EP. === Touring : 2017 - present === Ben Sink/ Paul Draper Band / Steven Wilson Draper undertook his first sell-out UK solo tour in September 2017 including a triumphant headline show at London's Scala which was recorded for the Live At Scala album and subsequently released on 16 February 2018. The gigs were Paul's first live shows since Mansun stopped touring in 2002 featuring tracks from his debut solo album Spooky Action, his solo EPs along with Mansun's Attack of the Grey Lantern and Little Kix. A second solo tour in February/March 2018 saw Draper ambitiously take on doubleheader style gigs in which he performed his solo material and after a short interval, a second set playing Mansun's debut album Attack of the Grey Lantern in its entirety . Whilst the tour was a huge success ( even overcoming the chilling ‘Beast From The East’ weather ) there was some controversy at the Rescue Rooms in Nottingham where he appeared intoxicated, disoriented and forgot lyrics before exiting the stage . The following day, Draper issued a press release apologising for the show and claimed that a \\"personal issue raised its head just prior to the gig\\" that had upset him. Despite the difficulties with travel caused by the weather, the tour reached its conclusion in London in early March. In April 2018, Draper toured the U.S as support to Steven Wilson. His first dates in the U.S since Mansun toured in 1997. On 8 June 2018 to celebrate the 21st anniversary of the release of Mansun's debut album, Attack Of The Grey Lantern.

He was curate and then vicar of St Andrew the Great, Cambridge. His lectures were published as Of the proofs of the divine power and wisdom derived from the study of astronomy in 1835. That same year, Chevallier was invited to become Professor of Astronomy at the newly founded University of Durham. A chair of Mathematics and Astronomy existed at the University of Durham between 1841–1871; Chevallier was the one to hold this post. He also served as Reader in Hebrew from 1835–1871, Registrar from 1835–1865, and from 1834-1835 also assisted with lectures in Divinity.

The Killing Time was a period of conflict in Scottish history between the Presbyterian Covenanter movement, based largely in the south west of the country, and the government forces of Kings Charles II and James VII. The period, roughly from 1679 to the Glorious Revolution of 1688, was subsequently called The Killing Time by Robert Wodrow in his The History of the Sufferings of the Church of Scotland from the Restoration to the Revolution, published in 1721–22. It is an important episode in the martyrology of the Church of Scotland. ==Background== In the century following the Reformation Parliament of 1560, the question of church government had been one of growing tension between popular opinion and the Monarch. While the Church of Scotland was Presbyterian in its legal status according to various acts of Parliament,Papal Jurisdiction Act 1560, Confession of Faith Ratification Act 1560 (both not ratified until 1572), The Golden Act 1592, and the General Assembly passing The Second Book of Discipline 1578 King James VI had developed a compromise which tended towards an Episcopalian church government, but Calvinist theology. When King Charles I acceded the throne in 1625, his policy increasingly antagonised the nation by imposing High Church Anglicanism and Erastian state control over spiritual matters of the church. This culminated in the 1638 National Covenant which was a widespread popular expression of the nation's protest at the King's policy. Ultimately the Bishops' Wars resulted in the Wars of the Three Kingdoms. On 5 February 1649, six days after the English Parliament executed the King, the Covenanter Parliament of Scotland proclaimed Charles II \\"King of Great Britain, France and Ireland\\" at the Mercat Cross, Edinburgh, but refused to allow him to enter Scotland unless he accepted Presbyterianism throughout Britain and Ireland. In order to protect the Presbyterian polity and doctrine of the Church of Scotland, the pre-Restoration government of Scotland. signed the 1650 Treaty of Breda to crown him king and support him against the English Parliamentary forces. However, at his Restoration in 1660, the King renounced the terms of the Treaty and his Oath of Covenant, which the Scottish Covenanters saw as a betrayal. The Rescissory Act 1661 repealed all laws made since 1633, effectively ejecting 400 Ministers from their livings, removing patronage in the appointment of Ministers from congregations and allowing the King to proclaim the restoration of Bishops to the Church of Scotland. The Abjuration Act of 1662 …was a formal rejection of the National Covenant of 1638 and the Solemn League and Covenant of 1643. These were declared to be against the fundamental laws of the kingdom. The Act required all persons taking public office to take an oath of abjuration not to take arms against the king, and rejecting the Covenants. This excluded most Presbyterians from holding official positions of trust.. Essentially, this returned church governance to the situation that existed prior to the expulsion of the bishops by the Glasgow General Assembly in 1638 and overthrew the Presbyterian form of organisation favoured by the Covenanters. ==Situation== Church ministers were confronted with a stark choice: accept the new situation or lose their livings. Up to a third of the ministry refused. Many ministers chose voluntarily to abandon their own parishes rather than wait to be forced out by the government.. Most of the vacancies occurred in the south-west of Scotland, an area particularly strong in its Covenanting sympathies. Some of the ministers also took to preaching in the open fields in conventicles, often attracting thousands of worshippers. The Scottish Privy Council attempted to end the dissent in the form of the First Indulgence of 1669, followed by a Second in 1672. These allowed ministers to return to their churches on condition that they remained silent on the issues dividing the Kirk. The English writer Daniel Defoe, who studied the period, listed the reasons why the more intransigent clergy refused to countenance the offer: # They would not accept of our Indulgence for worshipping God by the licence of the bishops; because they said they had abjured Prelacy in the Covenant, and had declared the bishops to be anti-scriptural and anti-Christian; and to take licence from them was to homologate their authority as legal, which they detested and abhorred. # They would not take the Oath of Supremacy because they could not in conscience allow any king or head of the Church but Jesus Christ. # They would not pray for the king, or swear to him, because he was a persecutor of the Church, and thereby an enemy to God, because he had renounced the oath of God in the Covenant, and until he had repented, they would have nothing to do with him. # Being debarred all manner of liberty to worship God in public, and on the severest penalties forbidden to assemble themselves together, either in the churches or in private families; and believing it at the same time their duty according to the Scriptures, not to forsake assembling, they could not satisfy their consciences to obey man rather than God., quoted in . ==Reaction== The Stuart regime, worried about the possibility of disorder and rebellion and resentful of the Covenanters' having made their fighting for Charles II during the civil wars conditional upon the maintenance of Scottish Presbyterianism, attempted to stamp this movement out, with varying degrees of success. Fines were levied upon those who failed to attend the parish churches of the \\"King's curates\\", the death penalty was imposed for preaching at field conventicles, and torture of suspects using inventive punishments such as hanging people by the thumbs or using the boot or thumbscrews became a tactic of first resort. In 1678, some 3,000 Lowland militia and 6,000 Highlanders (the 'Highland Host') were billeted in the Covenanting shires and plundered their unwilling hosts.P. Hume Brown, History of Scotland, p. 406. These policies provoked armed rebellions in 1666 and 1679, which were quickly suppressed. The early summer of 1679 saw an escalation of civil unrest with the assassination of the Scottish Primate James Sharp, the Archbishop of St Andrews, the Battle of Drumclog and the Battle of Bothwell Bridge. The Sanquhar Declaration of 1680 effectively declared the people could not accept the authority of a King who would not recognise their religion, nor commit to his previous oaths. Read publicly at Sanquhar by a group of Covenanters led by the Reverend Richard Cameron, it renounced all allegiance to Charles II and opposed the succession of his brother James, Duke of York, a Roman Catholic. In February 1685 the King died and was succeeded by his brother as King James VII. In response to these shows of political sedition, the Scottish Privy Council authorised extrajudicial field executions of those caught in arms or those who refused to swear loyalty to the King and renounce the Covenant by an Abjuration Oath. This Oath of Abjuration was specifically designed to be repugnant to Covenanters and thereby act as a \\"sieve, the mesh of which would winnow the loyal from the disloyal.\\" John Graham, Laird of Claverhouse was commissioned to carry out the orders of the Privy Council and was responsible for various summary executions which earned him the name \\"Bluidy Clavers\\" by the Covenanters. Around 100 executions are recorded as a result of the Privy Council's orders, the majority being of radical Cameronians who were executed over a short period of several months in 1685.Lynch (ed.) The Oxford Companion to Scottish History, OUP, 2007, p.114 Despite the relatively short duration of this action and its limitation to a single faction of the broader Presbyterian community, it has since come to dominate the historiography of the period. Amid rising tensions in both Scotland and England, the Stuart regime descended into chaos and the Glorious Revolution of 1688 ended James's reign in England when he fled on 23 December to exile in France. The ensuing political crisis in Scotland, which, pre-empted by English events, left Scotland without a king and saw the members of the Scottish Privy Council swiftly ask William to take over the responsibilities of government in Scotland on 7 January 1689.Mackie et al. 1991 pp. 241–245 Having read the mood of the people that there was a lack of popular support for James' regime and that William's political support grew as the crisis unfolded in a similar way to England,T. Harris, Revolution: The Great Crisis of the British Monarchy 1685–1720 (London: Penguin, 2006), , pp. 380–390. the Scottish Parliament passed the Claim of Right Act, thereby establishing in Scots Law, that the throne was left vacant upon James' departure. The persecution ended with the accession of William of Orange as King William II of Scotland in 1688 and the acceptance of Scottish Presbyterianism by the Act of Settlement 1690.

This entire setting is typically covered, at least partially, by a large cylindrical (or bell-shaped) fabric shade which is fitted over the reflector bowl, an upturned, white-colored glass, hemispherical diffuser surrounding the center bulb. The top of the lamp is usually designed to sit just above eye- level of an average adult person standing next to it, to avoid unpleasant glare from unshaded bulbs. ==Etymology== The lamp is named after the Great Mogul. == Details == The bulb socket in the center has a larger diameter (an E39 or E40 mogul base) than a regular E26 or E27 Edison screw light socket, and is typically made of cast porcelain for the higher temperatures. Mogul- base lamps are available for industrial use in larger power ratings (250-1500) and in halogen, mercury vapor, high-pressure sodium and metal-halide lamp configurations. Compact fluorescent mogul-base bulbs are also available, as are adaptors to allow medium-base bulbs to be used in mogul sockets. There are usually two three-way switches near the top of the floor lamp to operate the bulbs. One controls the three-way center bulb, and the other turns on one, two, or all three (or four) of the peripheral bulbs. The center bulb may be very high power (often a three-way, 100-200-300 watt bulb), where the others are usually 60 watts or less. Some models have a night light in the base operated by a foot switch. This design allows sixteen different combinations of brightness to be obtained. The result is that one lamp can provide a very soft, diffuse glow or quickly adjusted to illuminate an entire room, and everything in between. Popular in the 1920s and 1930s, mogul lamps can be obtained in thrift or antique stores and can still be purchased new. ==Mogul lamps and mathematics== Mogul lamps are also the subject of a mathematics problem concerning the number of possible combinations of power that can be obtained. As it turns out, the name \\"Six Way Lamp\\" is somewhat deceiving since there are in fact 16 possible combinations (without the night-light), including combinations with all lamps of either switch off. The term probably comes from the fact that the design incorporates two \\"three-way\\" switches. ==See also== * Floor lamp Category:Light fixtures ","title":"Mogul lamp"},{"id":"2546506","text":"Fogo Island, Cape Verde, an example of a somma volcano.

In number theory, the Stern–Brocot tree is an infinite complete binary tree in which the vertices correspond one-for-one to the positive rational numbers, whose values are ordered from the left to the right as in a search tree. The Stern–Brocot tree was discovered independently by and . Stern was a German number theorist; Brocot was a French clockmaker who used the Stern–Brocot tree to design systems of gears with a gear ratio close to some desired value by finding a ratio of smooth numbers near that value. The root of the Stern–Brocot tree corresponds to the number 1. The parent-child relation between numbers in the Stern–Brocot tree may be defined in terms of continued fractions or mediants, and a path in the tree from the root to any other number q provides a sequence of approximations to q with smaller denominators than q. Because the tree contains each positive rational number exactly once, a breadth first search of the tree provides a method of listing all positive rationals that is closely related to Farey sequences. ==A tree of continued fractions== Every positive rational number q may be expressed as a continued fraction of the form :q = a_0 + \\\\cfrac{1}{a_1 + \\\\cfrac{1}{a_2 + \\\\cfrac{1}{a_3 + \\\\cfrac{1}{\\\\ddots+\\\\cfrac1{a_k}}}}}= [a_0; a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_k] where k and a0 are non-negative integers, and each subsequent coefficient ai is a positive integer. This representation is not unique because one has : [a_0; a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_{k-1}, 1] = [a_0; a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_{k-1}+1] for every sequence of coefficients a0, ..., ak−1. Using this identity to rewrite any representation of the former form into the latter form, one may obtain that the final coefficient satisfies (unless , in which case one obtains a0 ≥ 1); with this additional requirement the representation becomes unique. Then, unless , the number q has a parent in the Stern–Brocot tree given by the continued fraction expression : [a_0; a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_k-1], which in case one can rewrite as [a_0; a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_{k-1}+1]. For instance, the rational number has the continued fraction representation :\\\\frac{23}{16}=1+\\\\cfrac1{2+\\\\cfrac1{3+\\\\frac12}} = [1;2,3,2], so its parent in the Stern–Brocot tree is the number :[1;2,3,1]=[1;2,4]=1+\\\\cfrac1{2+\\\\frac14}=\\\\frac{13}{9}. This parent is formed by decreasing the denominator in the innermost term of the continued fraction by 1, and contracting with the previous term if the fraction becomes \\\\tfrac11. Conversely each number q in the Stern–Brocot tree has exactly two children: if : q = [a_0; a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_k] = [a_0; a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_k-1,1] then one child is the number represented by the continued fraction :\\\\displaystyle [a_0; a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_k+1] while the other child is represented by the continued fraction : [a_0; a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_k-1,2]. One of these children is less than q and this is the left child; the other is greater than q and it is the right child (in fact the former expression gives the left child if k is odd, and the right child if k is even). For instance, the continued fraction representation of is [1;2,4] and its two children are [1;2,5] = (the right child) and [1;2,3,2] = (the left child). It is clear that for each finite continued fraction expression one can repeatedly move to its parent, and reach the root [1;]= of the tree in finitely many steps (in steps to be precise). Therefore every positive rational number appears exactly once in this tree. Moreover all descendants of the left child of any number q are less than q, and all descendants of the right child of q are greater than q. The numbers at depth d in the tree are the numbers for which the sum of the continued fraction coefficients is . ==Mediants and binary search== The Stern–Brocot tree forms an infinite binary search tree with respect to the usual ordering of the rational numbers.. The set of rational numbers descending from a node q is defined by the open interval (Lq,Hq) where Lq is the ancestor of q that is smaller than q and closest to it in the tree (or Lq = 0 if q has no smaller ancestor) while Hq is the ancestor of q that is larger than q and closest to it in the tree (or Hq = +∞ if q has no larger ancestor). The path from the root 1 to a number q in the Stern–Brocot tree may be found by a binary search algorithm, which may be expressed in a simple way using mediants. Augment the non-negative rational numbers to including a value 1/0 (representing +∞) that is by definition greater than all other rationals. The binary search algorithm proceeds as follows: *Initialize two values L and H to 0/1 and 1/0, respectively. *Until q is found, repeat the following steps: **Let L = a/b and H = c/d; compute the mediant M = (a + c)/(b + d). **If M is less than q, then q is in the open interval (M,H); replace L by M and continue. **If M is greater than q, then q is in the open interval (L,M); replace H by M and continue. **In the remaining case, q = M; terminate the search algorithm. The sequence of values M computed by this search is exactly the sequence of values on the path from the root to q in the Stern–Brocot tree. Each open interval (L,H) occurring at some step in the search is the interval (LM,HM) representing the descendants of the mediant M. The parent of q in the Stern–Brocot tree is the last mediant found that is not equal to q. This binary search procedure can be used to convert floating-point numbers into rational numbers. By stopping once the desired precision is reached, floating- point numbers can be approximated to arbitrary precision.Sedgewick and Wayne, Introduction to Programming in Java. A Java implementation of this algorithm can be found here. If a real number x is approximated by any rational number a/b that is not in the sequence of mediants found by the algorithm above, then the sequence of mediants contains a closer approximation to x that has a denominator at most equal to b; in that sense, these mediants form the best rational approximations to x. The Stern–Brocot tree may itself be defined directly in terms of mediants: the left child of any number q is the mediant of q with its closest smaller ancestor, and the right child of q is the mediant of q with its closest larger ancestor. In this formula, q and its ancestor must both be taken in lowest terms, and if there is no smaller or larger ancestor then 0/1 or 1/0 should be used respectively. Again, using 7/5 as an example, its closest smaller ancestor is 4/3, so its left child is (4 + 7)/(3 + 5) = 11/8, and its closest larger ancestor is 3/2, so its right child is (7 + 3)/(5 + 2) = 10/7. ==Relation to Farey sequences== The Farey sequence of order n is the sorted sequence of fractions in the closed interval [0,1] that have denominator less than or equal to n. As in the binary search technique for generating the Stern–Brocot tree, the Farey sequences can be constructed using mediants: the Farey sequence of order n + 1 is formed from the Farey sequence of order n by computing the mediant of each two consecutive values in the Farey sequence of order n, keeping the subset of mediants that have denominator exactly equal to n + 1, and placing these mediants between the two values from which they were computed. A similar process of mediant insertion, starting with a different pair of interval endpoints [0/1,1/0], may also be seen to describe the construction of the vertices at each level of the Stern–Brocot tree. The Stern–Brocot sequence of order 0 is the sequence [0/1,1/0], and the Stern–Brocot sequence of order i is the sequence formed by inserting a mediant between each consecutive pair of values in the Stern–Brocot sequence of order i − 1\\\\. The Stern–Brocot sequence of order i consists of all values at the first i levels of the Stern–Brocot tree, together with the boundary values 0/1 and 1/0, in numerical order. Thus the Stern–Brocot sequences differ from the Farey sequences in two ways: they eventually include all positive rationals, not just the rationals within the interval [0,1], and at the nth step all mediants are included, not only the ones with denominator equal to n. The Farey sequence of order n may be found by an inorder traversal of the left subtree of the Stern–Brocot tree, backtracking whenever a number with denominator greater than n is reached. ==Additional properties== If { \\\\frac{p_1}{q_1}, \\\\frac{p_2}{q_2}, \\\\dots, \\\\frac{p_n}{q_n} } are all the rationals at the same depth in the Stern–Brocot tree, then : \\\\sum_{k=1}^n \\\\frac{1}{p_kq_k} = 1. Moreover, if {\\\\frac{p}{q} < \\\\frac{p'}{q'}} are two consecutive fractions at or above a certain level in the tree (in the sense that any fraction between them, must be in a lower level of the tree), then : p'q - pq' = 1.Bogomolny credits this property to Pierre Lamothe, a Canadian music theorist. Along with the definitions in terms of continued fractions and mediants described above, the Stern–Brocot tree may also be defined as a Cartesian tree for the rational numbers, prioritized by their denominators. In other words, it is the unique binary search tree of the rational numbers in which the parent of any vertex q has a smaller denominator than q (or if q and its parent are both integers, in which the parent is smaller than q). It follows from the theory of Cartesian trees that the lowest common ancestor of any two numbers q and r in the Stern–Brocot tree is the rational number in the closed interval [q, r] that has the smallest denominator among all numbers in this interval. Permuting the vertices on each level of the Stern–Brocot tree by a bit-reversal permutation produces a different tree, the Calkin–Wilf tree, in which the children of each number a/b are the two numbers a/(a + b) and (a + b)/b. Like the Stern–Brocot tree, the Calkin–Wilf tree contains each positive rational number exactly once, but it is not a binary search tree. ==See also== * Minkowski's question mark function, whose definition for rational arguments is closely related to the Stern–Brocot tree * Calkin–Wilf tree ==Notes== ==References== *. *. * ==External links== * * *. *. *. * * *Infinite fractions, Numberphile Category:Continued fractions Category:Number theory Category:Trees (data structures) ","title":"Stern–Brocot tree"},{"id":"2546523","text":"\\"Rose, Rose, I Love You\\" () is a 1940 Mandarin popular song composed by Chen Gexin and first recorded by Yao Lee. An English-language version whose lyrics have little in common with the original Mandarin was first recorded by Frankie Laine in 1951. The song was brought back to England by broadcaster Wilfrid Thomas in 1951 after doing commentary on the war in Malaya. When he played it on his BBC program he received a barrage of requests for a repeat and he played it again in several more programs. The song is also known under the titles \\"Shanghai Rose\\" and \\"China Rose.\\" ==History== Yao Lee collection album titled after her hit song Rose, Rose, I Love You (玫瑰玫瑰我愛你) The original Chinese lyrics were by Wu Cun (Ng Chuen; 吳村 Wú Cūn) and the music was credited to Lin Mei (林枚), a pen name of the popular songwriter Chen Gexin. The song was first recorded in 1940 by Yao Lee as an interlude for the movie Singing Girl and released as a single on Pathé Records (EMI) catalog number B. 597. Yao Lee's Mandarin version was also released in the US and UK in the early 1950s by Columbia Records, catalog numbers 39420 and 2837 respectively. Yao Lee was credited as \\"Miss Hue Lee\\" in this release. Other early releases have also credited her as \\"Yiu Lei.\\" The English-language lyrics were written by the British radio presenter Wilfrid Thomas. It was recorded by American singer Frankie Laine and the Norman Luboff Choir, with Paul Weston and his orchestra, on 6 April 1951, and released by Columbia Records as catalog number 39367. The song reached #3 on the Billboard magazine music chart. At this time Columbia also released Yao Lee's original Mandarin version in the US and UK under the English title, \\"Rose, Rose, I Love You.\\" When the songwriter Chen Gexin's youngest son went to the United States for advanced education, he was able to meet Laine and maintained a correspondence. The English lyrics have little in common with the original Mandarin, but they pay subtle tribute to the titular Mandarin phrase \\"méigui méigui\\" (lit. rose, rose) by including three times the similar-sounding English phrase \\"make way,\\" with its normal English meaning. ==Covers== Petula Clark covered the song in English with new lyrics under the title \\"May Kway\\". This lyric entered the UK sheet music charts on May 5, 1951 and peaked at number 16. The Japanese singer Kyu Sakamoto covered the original Mandarin versions in the 1960s. Gordon Jenkins released a cover of Frankie Laine's version on Decca Records catalog number 27594. Aneka also covered Frankie Laine's version in the early 1980s, also adding new original English lyrics. This single was released by Ariola Records but did not chart. Hong Kong singer Anita Mui sang the Cantonese cover of the song in 1989 and was featured as the theme soundtrack in Jackie Chan's film Miracles. The Malaysian girl group Four Golden Princess released an album of medleys (2006), each of which paired a popular Mandarin song with an English-language pop song. They covered the first two verses and chorus of the English-language version of Rose, Rose, I Love You, rather than the Chinese version. The original Mandarin version of this song was also covered by Taiwanese singer Joanna Wang in her 2009 album Joanna & Wang Ruo-lin. The Mandarin version also has reached a degree of popularity in Vietnam with various performers, such as Thu Ngọc and Thái Doanh Doanh, covering the song under the title \\"Cánh hồng Trung Quốc.\\" The Shanghai Restoration Project has recently covered the Mandarin version in their album \\"The Classics\\" (2014), featuring singer Le Zhang (張樂). The song has occasionally been covered in Hong Kong TV dramas, including House of Spirits and Glittering Days. ==Popular culture== The original Mandarin song was featured in the 1996 film The Pillow Book, both opening and closing the film and serving as a leitmotif representing the protagonist Nagiko's childhood. It was also featured in the 2005 film The White Countess (the film appears to be set in 1937, so the inclusion of the song would be anachronistic). Anita Mui sings this song in the 1989 Jackie Chan film Miracles. The Frankie Laine version was featured in Peter Bogdanovich's 1971 film The Last Picture Show. David Bowie references the song in the 1984 documentary Ricochet. While visiting Hong Kong on his Serious Moonlight Tour, Bowie is filmed having dinner with a group of local socialites. He asks if they know the song, and several of the guests begin to sing it. At another time, the song is heard as a backdrop to footage of Hong Kong street life. ==References== ==External links== *\\"A Rose Is a Rose ...\\" Time. 14 May 1951. Accessed 30 January 2007.

The fortress was the site of the signing of the Treaty of Fort McIntosh on January 21, 1785. It was occupied until it was abandoned in 1791. After the Revolution, the fort was the home of the First American Regiment, the oldest active unit in the United States Army. The fort was in the form of a trapezoid, about 150 feet on each side, with raised earthen bastions on each corner. Log palisades connected the bastions, and a 15 foot wide ditch protected three sides of the fort, with the 130 foot slope to the Ohio River protecting the other side. Inside were three barracks, warehouses, officer's quarters, a forge, kitchen, and powder magazines.

He goes over to the table and tries to pour himself a drink, but first he accidentally spins the table top around and then does not manage to pour the drinks inside a glass. He then unsuccessfully attempts to light a cigarette, and then tries to head up the stairs to his bedroom. He fails several times in climbing them; a large cuckoo clock on the upstairs landing also poses a problem, due to its pendulum's implausibly wide swing. He becomes increasingly creative with his attempts to climb the stairs, for example by using mountain climbing gear. When he finally reaches his bedroom, he struggles to open his Murphy bed and ends up wrecking it. He gives up on the idea of sleeping in his bed and goes to bathroom. He enters the shower and accidentally turns it on. Soaked, he then gets into the bathtub and falls asleep under a towel. ==Review== A reviewer for the Louisville Herald wrote, \\"Charlie, by himself, creates all the action that is necessary to produce the laughs for which he has become noted, and there is no doubt that this is the most exacting role the comedian has ever essayed.\\" ==Miscellany== Although the film's title suggests the action is supposed to occur at about one a.m., when Charlie arrives home in the taxi cab, it is quite bright outside. This is presumably due to the impracticality of night shooting at the time. Edna Purviance's absence from the cast was a rarity. Apart from Chaplin's first film after leaving Keystone Studios, His New Job, One A.M. was the only Chaplin film from 1915 to 1923 not to feature Purviance in some role. ==Cast== * Charles Chaplin - Drunk * Albert Austin - Taxi driver ==Sound version== In 1932, Amedee Van Beuren of Van Beuren Studios, purchased Chaplin's Mutual comedies for $10,000 each, added music by Gene Rodemich and Winston Sharples and sound effects, and re-released them through RKO Radio Pictures.

Dewey served in the Pacific through World War II. After escaping damage during the attack on Pearl Harbor, Dewey screened the aircraft carrier until the carrier was lost in the battle of the Coral Sea; then screened through the invasion of Guadalcanal and the battle of the Eastern Solomons. Following overhaul in San Francisco, Dewey spent 1943 in Alaskan waters supporting the invasions of Attu and Kiska. Dewey spent 1944 supporting raids in the Marshalls, Carolines, and Marianas, including screening carriers during the battle of the Philippine Sea. After being damaged by Typhoon Cobra during the recapture of the Philippines, Dewey supported the invasion of Iwo Jima and spent the remainder of the war screening replenishment oilers. ==History== The Dewey was launched on 28 July 1934 by Bath Iron Works, Bath, Maine, sponsored by Miss A. M. Dewey, great-grandniece of Admiral Dewey. She was commissioned on 4 October 1934, with Commander H. W. Hill in command. After two training cruises to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and Port-au-Prince, Haiti, the Dewey sailed from Norfolk, Virginia, on 1 April 1935 for San Diego, California, arriving on 14 April. Until 1938 she operated principally from this port on local operations as well as engaging in fleet tactics, battle practice, and scheduled exercises. She cruised along the West Coast as far north as Alaska and as far south as Callao, Peru, and made three cruises to the Hawaiian area. From 4 January to 12 April 1939 she returned to the Atlantic for a fleet problem. The Dewey arrived at Pearl Harbor 12 October 1939 and participated in tactical exercises, battle practice, fleet problems, and maneuvers until 1941. ==World War II== When Japan attacked Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941, the Dewey was undergoing tender overhaul. She opened fire on the enemy planes and that afternoon got underway to patrol in the Hawaiian area. On 15 December she joined TF 11 sailing to relieve the Navy and Marine garrison on Wake Island, which fell on 23 December. The Dewey returned to her patrol assignment. In February 1942 she rejoined TF 11 for a projected strike on Rabaul. The force was sighted by two enemy patrol planes and the strike was canceled after the Dewey aided in downing several of the 18 Japanese bombers directed to the force by the patrol plane' reports. She continued to screen the Lexington in the strikes on Lae and Salamaua, New Guinea, on 10 March and returned to Pearl Harbor on the 26th. TF 11 sortied from Pearl Harbor 15 April 1942 for operations in the Solomon Islands. On 5 May word came that the Japanese were advancing on Port Moresby, and the Deweys group joined the in the battle of the Coral Sea. When the Lexington came under intensive attack, the Dewey joined in with antiaircraft fire, having five of her crewmen wounded by enemy strafing. The Lexington was badly hit, and as fires raged out of control, she was abandoned, with the Dewey rescuing 112 of the carrier's survivors. She screened the Yorktown into Noumea 12 May, and then returned to Pearl Harbor 25 May in the screen for the . The Dewey sailed three days later in the Enterprise task force. The Battle of Midway was joined 2 to 6 June, and throughout this action the Dewey screened the . Returning to Pearl Harbor 9 June, The Dewey escorted the as the carrier brought an air squadron to Midway between 22 and 29 June. On 7 July she cleared for the initial landings on Guadalcanal, which she bombarded 7 August. On that day of the first assault, the Dewey fired on attacking dive bombers, suffering one crewman wounded. She went to the rescue of two ships, aiding the to regain power, and towing the until her damage made it necessary to abandon her. The Dewey rescued 40 of the transport's survivors. The Dewey remained in the Solomons to protect supply and communication lines, and screened the Saratoga during the battle of the Eastern Solomons on 24 August 1942. She escorted the Saratoga, damaged by submarine torpedo 31 August, to Pearl Harbor, arriving 23 September, and 6 days later sailed for overhaul at San Francisco. On 27 December 1942 she got underway for duty in Alaskan waters. When the ran aground at Amchitka, the Dewey attempted to tow her off the rocks, then aided in rescuing her survivors when stormy weather forced her abandonment. On 7 April 1943, the Dewey sailed for San Pedro to escort an assault group to Attu for the invasion 11 May. She also took part in the landings at Kiska 15 August, before escorting a group of LSTs to San Francisco, arriving 19 September. ===1944=== Sailing from San Diego 13 January 1944, the Dewey arrived off Kwajalein 31 January and served as escort during the carrier strike on Majuro of 11 February and the invasion landings on Eniwetok on 18 February. She escorted convoys between Eniwetok, Roi, and Majuro, and bombarded Mille Atoll on 17–18 March. From 22 March to 6 June, she operated in the screen of TF 58, taking part in raids on Palau, Yap, Ulithi and Woleai; the invasion of Hollandia on 21 and 22 April; and the strike on Truk of 29 April to 1 May. On 6 June, she sailed to screen carriers in fighter sweeps against Tinian and Saipan on 11 June, then bombarded of Saipan and Tinian on 13 and 14 June, when she fired on enemy barges and started a fire in an oil dump. During the Marianas landings, Dewey screened the carriers during the resulting battle of the Philippine Sea on 19 and 20 June, and rescued several pilots and crew members who were forced to ditch. Dewey joined the transport screen 1 July 1944 for the invasion of Guam. She furnished close fire support for reconnaissance groups, covered the work of underwater demolition teams, conducted night harassing fire, and patrolled off the island until 28 July, when she sailed for a brief overhaul at Puget Sound Navy Yard. Dewey put to sea 30 September 1944 to join the logistics group for the 3rd Fleet on 10 October. She screened this group in its refueling operations for the Philippines invasion until the typhoon of 18 December, which heavily damaged the units of the 3rd Fleet. Dewey had lost all power by noon, and was rolling more than 75 degrees; her number one stack was torn and thrown against the boat deck. She rejoined her group 8 February 1945, after repairs had been completed at Ulithi, and arrived at Iwo Jima 17 February, where she assisted in putting out fires on . Aiding the Marines who assaulted the island 19 February, she helped break up a Japanese counter-attack by firing star shell illumination on 23 February. After escorting a convoy to Leyte from 4 to 6 March 1945, Dewey rejoined the logistics group for the Okinawa operation, screening the oilers as they refueled the carriers in preinvasion air strikes and the raids in the Far East, which continued until the end of the war. ==Fate== On 21 August, she got underway for San Diego, arriving 7 September. She continued to the east coast, arriving at Brooklyn Navy Yard 25 September. Dewey was decommissioned 19 October 1945 and sold 20 December 1946. ==Awards== Dewey received 13 battle stars for World War II service. ==References== * ==External links== *USS Dewey website at Destroyer History Foundation Category:Farragut-class destroyers (1934) Category:World War II destroyers of the United States Category:Ships built in Bath, Maine Category:Ships present during the attack on Pearl Harbor Category:Ships of the Aleutian Islands campaign Category:1934 ships ","title":"USS Dewey (DD-349)"},{"id":"2546639","text":"Via Caecilia, an ancient highroad of Italy, which diverged from the Via Salaria at the 35th mile (56 km) from Rome, and ran by Amiternum to the Adriatic coast, passing probably by Hadria (Atri).

His tomb was found empty not because he was resurrected, but because the body had been hidden somewhere else by the apostles or unknown persons. Both the stolen body hypothesis and the debate over it presume the basic historicity of the gospel accounts of the tomb discovery. The stolen body hypothesis finds the idea that the body was not in the tomb plausible - such a claim could be checked if early Christians made it - but considers it more likely that early Christians had been misled into believing the resurrection by the theft of Jesus's body. The hypothesis has existed since the days of Early Christianity; it is discussed in the Gospel of Matthew, generally agreed to have been written between AD 70 and 100. Matthew's gospel raises the hypothesis only to refute it; according to it, the claim that the body was stolen is a lie spread by the Jewish high priests. ==Historicity and gospel account== The primary sources of details about Jesus are the Gospels. Roman records are spottier - there is no extant contemporary record of the execution of Jesus, for example, not that such a thing would be expected, and thus no details about what was done with the body afterward. As such, accounts of the days between Jesus's execution and the discovery of the empty tomb are almost exclusively based on the Gospel accounts and knowledge of society at the time, and it is difficult to say more than scenarios such as the stolen body hypothesis are \\"plausible\\" or \\"unlikely,\\" rather than \\"proven\\" or \\"disproven\\".Carrier, \\"The Plausibility of Theft\\", p. 349. \\"...[this work] demonstrates the plausibility (but by no means the certainty) of the hypothesis that the body of Jesus was stolen.\\" According to the Gospel of Mark, generally thought to be the oldest of the gospels, Joseph of Arimathea asked Pontius Pilate for the body of Jesus. Afterward, a group of women went to the tomb, and found the stone rolled away, an angel there, and no body. The Gospel of Luke largely concurs with this account, though the list of women slightly differs. See and . According to the Gospel of John, Nicodemus helped Joseph of Arimathea with the burial of Jesus. It also notes that Jesus was buried in a garden near the site of the crucifixion, and that no body had lain there before. In John, Simon Peter and the beloved disciple also come to the tomb to verify Mary Magdalene's claim of an empty tomb; there is no direct reference to this in Mark and Luke, where it is implied that the apostles only believe upon seeing the resurrected Jesus. The Gospel of Matthew includes a distinct account of the period between Jesus's death and the discovery of the empty tomb not in the other gospels, and directly addresses skepticism about the resurrection. In Matthew's account, the chief priests and the Pharisees know of prophecies that Jesus will return in three days, and fear that his disciples will steal the body to make it appear that he has been resurrected. They ask Pilate to secure the tomb, and Pilate sends a guard to watch the tomb. When Mary Magdalene arrives at the tomb, unlike the accounts in the other gospels, there is an earthquake and the tomb rolls open in front of her. An angel appears and scares away the guards, and the empty tomb is revealed. When the guards report this to the chief priests, the priests bribe the guards to lie about the events: This is the chief reference to the stolen body hypothesis in the New Testament. ==Potential culprits== ===The disciples=== According to this version of the stolen body hypothesis, some of the disciples stole away Jesus's body. Potential reasons include wishing to bury Jesus themselves; believing that Jesus would soon return and wanting his body in their possession; a \\"pious deceit\\" to restore Jesus's good name after being crucified as a criminal; or an outright plot to fake a resurrection.Carrier. \\"The Plausibility of Theft\\", p. 352. In the pious deceit theory, the proposed motive is that if people believed God had taken Jesus's body up to heaven, this would \\"prove\\" Jesus was a true holy man and vindicate his name. The \\"faked resurrection\\" theory is the only scenario discussed in the gospels, although Matthew brings it up solely to refute it and claim that the tale was a concoction of Jerusalem's high priests. According to proponents of this theory, the fact that Matthew raises the issue makes it likely that such an anti-Christian narrative already existed at the time. Jesus's entourage may have been at least as many as seventy (the Seventy Disciples), so it is not improbable according to proponents that at least one or two of them might have been willing to undertake such a plot. This theory also obviates the need for a miraculous resurrection. A Jewish anti-Christian work dating from the 5th- century, the Toledoth Yeshu, contains the claim that the disciples planned to steal Jesus's body from his tomb. In this account, the body had already been moved, and when the disciples arrived at the empty tomb they came to the incorrect conclusion that he had risen from the dead. Later, the corpse was sold to the Jewish leaders for thirty pieces of silver, who confirmed Jesus's death; Jesus's corpse was then dragged through the streets of Jerusalem.Gary R. Habermas, The Historical Jesus: Ancient Evidence for the Life of Christ, page 205 (Thomas Nelson, Inc., 2008). Another variant comes from a record of a 2nd-century debate between a Christian and a Jew, Justin Martyr's Dialogue with Trypho: \\"his disciples stole him by night from the tomb, where he was laid when unfastened from the cross, and now deceive men by asserting that he has risen from the dead and ascended to heaven.\\"Martyr, Justin. Dialogue with Trypho, Chapter CVIII. Later works suggesting this include some of the \\"form critics\\" and the predecessors in Germany. One early example is Hermann Samuel Reimarus, who wrote in the 1700s. According to Reimarus, Jesus himself never imagined a religion like Christianity, and both he and his followers had been revolutionaries working for an earthly Kingdom of God after an overthrow of Roman rule. After Jesus's death, his devastated followers who had expected important roles in a coming government still wished to wield power, and transformed Jesus's political message into a spiritual one. In order for the switch in focus to work, they stole the body and left an empty tomb so that they could be respected leaders of a new religion, chosen by a resurrected prophet. ====Sincerity of the disciples==== Christian apologists find the idea that the disciples stole the body unconvincing. Both Eusebius and church tradition hold that a large number of apostles were martyred for their faith. Therefore, it is unlikely that any conspirators would preach and ultimately die for something they knew to be false. J.N.D. Anderson, dean of the faculty of law at the University of London and Christian apologist, said \\"This [the stolen body theory] would run totally contrary to all we know of them [the apostles]: their ethical teaching, the quality of their lives. Nor would it begin to explain their dramatic transformation from dejected and dispirited escapists into witnesses whom no opposition could muzzle.\\"McDowell, Josh. More than a carpenter. p. 95. E.P. Sanders agrees with apologists that it is unlikely that the disciples would create a fraud but looks at it differently. He claims: > \\"It is difficult to accuse these sources, or the first believers, of > deliberate fraud. A plot to foster belief in the Resurrection would probably > have resulted in a more consistent story. Instead, there seems to have been > a competition: 'I saw him,' 'so did I,' 'the women saw him first,' 'no, I > did; they didn't see him at all,' and so on. Moreover, some of the witnesses > of the Resurrection would give their lives for their belief. This also makes > fraud unlikely.\\"\\"Jesus Christ.\\" Encyclopædia Britannica. 2007. Encyclopædia > Britannica Online. 10 January 2007 ===Graverobbers=== Graverobbing was a known problem in 1st century Judaea; the famous Nazareth Inscription details an edict of Caesar that mandates capital punishment for meddling with tombs. Several other pieces of evidence exist as well, such as a decree of Emperor Septimius Severus reasserting the existing law, implying that its violation continued to be a problem in the 2nd century AD.Carrier. \\"The Plausibility of Theft\\", p. 365. It is thus possible that Jesus's body was taken by graverobbers. Gary Habermas finds this unlikely; he writes: \\"Robbing a tomb for valuables is one thing - taking the body with you is something else! Why take a male body with you when you are trying to escape?\\"Gary Habermas; http://www.garyhabermas.com/qa/qa_index.htm Nevertheless, it appears some ancient graverobbers did steal bodies. A possible motive for such would be the usage of Jesus's body in necromancy; several rites of the time required \\"one untimely dead\\" or the body of a holy person. For example, a person could insert a scroll into a corpse's mouth and ask questions of the dead according to one belief of the time.Carrier. \\"The Plausibility of Theft\\", p. 350. Tacitus notes that \\"the remains of human bodies\\" were found along with curse paraphernalia in the quarters of Germanicus. William Lane Craig dismisses these cases from elsewhere in the Roman Empire as too remote as they are \\"non-Jewish, non-Palestinian, and non- contemporary -- in other words, irrelevant to Jesus.\\" ===Removal by Jewish leadership=== Historian Charles Freeman posits that Caiaphas and members of the Sanhedrin removed Jesus's body to stave off possible civil disorder from Jesus's followers. By emptying the tomb, the Sanhedrin hoped to prevent it from becoming a shrine. Also, he noted that the gospels of Matthew and Mark both record that one or more young men (or angels) dressed in white appeared to the myrrhbearers and told them to seek Jesus in Galilee. Freeman argued that these young men/angels could have been priests from the Temple in Jerusalem, as their Gospel description matches that of temple priests (white clothes). By encouraging Jesus's followers to return to Galilee, then, the priests were trying to get them to leave Jerusalem and avoid unrest.Charles Freeman, A New History of Early Christianity , pp. 31-33(Yale University Press, 2009). ===Jesus's family, or unknown thieves=== According to this version of the stolen body hypothesis, there was no conspiracy; Jesus's body was moved from the tomb for unknown or irrelevant reasons. The apostles then found an empty tomb and became genuinely convinced that Jesus had been resurrected, which would explain their later fervor in the spread of Christianity. Author and textual critic Bart Ehrman contends that while the stolen body hypothesis is unlikely, from a historical perspective it is still far more probable than the resurrection. Ehrman also says that there are plenty of motives for stealing the body, for instance, his family desiring to rebury his remains in a family tomb of some kind.Is there historical evidence for the resurrection of Jesus? A debate between William Lane Craig and Bart D. Ehrman. Another possibility, if a rather bizarre one, is the gardener. Tertullian, in De Spectaculis 30, mentions that in addition to the theory that the disciples stole the body the theory that the gardener did the deed such that \\"his lettuces might come to no harm from the crowds of visitants [to the body].\\"Tertullian. De Spectaculis, Chapter 30. Tertullian, an early Christian polemicist, may have merely meant to mock those who doubted the resurrection by putting the petty gardener theory in their mouths. The passage also perhaps only references a joke at the time or other non-serious accusation. However, the gospel of John possibly addresses the issue, as does Tatian's Diatessaron. In and the Diatessaron Section 53, Mary, after supposing the resurrected Jesus to be the gardener, asks him what he had done with the body - implying that the gardener may in fact have had a motive to move the body. In addition, in the Toledoth Yeshu, it is a gardener named Juda who originally moves the body, and then later sells the body of Jesus to the Jewish leadership. Even if this all only attests to a Jewish polemic against Christianity, it implies that people at that time found the gardener having a motive to steal the body plausible, even if this motive is unknown to us today.Carrier. \\"The Plausibility of Theft\\", p. 351. ==Other issues== ===The guard at the tomb=== According to the Gospel of Matthew, a guard was sent to the tomb: \\"Pilate said to them, 'You have a guard of soldiers; go, make it as secure as you can.' So they went with the guard and made the tomb secure by sealing the stone.\\" () It is unclear whether Roman soldiers were used, or if the priests were to use their own temple guard. Nevertheless, Christian tradition has generally claimed that Roman guards were used. Apologists consider it implausible that grave robbers would risk robbing a guarded tomb when surely many unguarded ones existed. Furthermore, while traditionally depicted as only two guards, Matthew does not specify how many there were; since \\"some\\" guards report the tale to the chief priests, it's plausible to assume there may have been more than two, which would render a raid even chancier.Anthony Horvath; How many guards at Jesus’ tomb? Horvath also argues that both Roman and temple guards were present. Apologists also doubt that the disciples could possibly have sneaked past a Roman guard at a sealed tomb, and that attacking the guards would be even more implausible. In response, it could be hypothesized that the guard was not on duty at night, and thus the thieves would be able to have struck then. A bribe to the soldiers is also possible, although most of the disciples were of modest means. Alternatively, the entire account of the guard and the chief priests can be discounted as likely to be an ahistorical addition written by Matthew to make the stolen body hypothesis appear implausible. Among scholars, it \\"is widely regarded as an apologetic legend\\"; L. Michael White and Helmut Koester argue the story was probably added as an attempt to refute the Jewish claims that the disciples stole the body which were circulating at the time.Ancient Christian Gospels Koster, Helmut; Trinity Press, (1992) pg 237.https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/religion/symposium/historical.html Atheist and historian Richard Carrier writes: William Lane Craig considers the historicity of the guards plausible, although he suspects it was more likely Jewish temple guards, especially considering the chief priests' promises to keep them \\"out of trouble\\" would mean little to Roman soldiers who might be executed for claiming to have slept on duty. The best objection to Matthew's version, to Craig, is that Matthew's account \\"presupposes not only that Jesus predicted his resurrection in three days, but also that the Jews understood this clearly while the disciples remained in ignorance.\\" While the gospel accounts give good reason to believe that the disciples would not understand the resurrection until it happened, Craig grants that it is indeed harder to explain the chief priest's actions, although far from impossible - perhaps it was simply an attempt to ensure no trouble started. In favor of the existence of the guards being historical, however, Craig notes that the non-canonical Gospel of Peter also includes a story of guards being placed at the tomb, yet one that is quite different, suggesting that the guards are less likely to have been invented entirely by Matthew. Additionally, Matthew's account isn't as foolproof as an invented or exaggerated account could be - the Gospel of Peter has an explicitly Roman guard guarding the tomb sent immediately on Good Friday (rather than Matthew's Saturday), the tomb is sealed seven times, and the Jewish elders keep watch the entire time. On Easter Sunday, Jesus rises, flanked by two angels, in front of the Jews and a crowd from Jerusalem out to see him. This account, given credence by neither Christians nor historians, clearly makes a secret theft of the body impossible. Additionally, Craig writes that the polemic mentioned by Matthew suggests that Jews didn't contest the existence of a guard at the time. In other words, if the guard didn't exist, the logical Jewish counterargument would be to argue against that Christian claim; instead, Matthew's story has the Jewish side using the weak \\"but the guards were asleep when the theft occurred\\" argument, suggesting the Jews of the time knew guards had been placed. ===Burial cloths=== The gospels of Luke and John record that the burial wrappings of Jesus were left inside the tomb. The head wrapping was folded and placed separate from the other linens (). Christian apologists contend that a grave robber would probably have stolen everything, especially since Joseph of Arimathea was a man of means and the wrappings were likely to have been valuable. Further, carefully removing, then wrapping and folding the linens would be difficult and serve no useful purpose.Wiersbe, Warren W. The Wiersbe Bible Commentary: The Complete New Testament Thus these claims in the gospel are also brought into contention by the theory, especially if a grave robber is proposed as the culprit. Replies from proponents include noting that if the motive of the graverobbers was body parts for necromancy, the cloths might be irrelevant; and if the culprit was a conspirator out to \\"prove\\" Jesus's holiness, then the wrappings might have been deliberately left behind to foster the notion of the body miraculously disappearing. Richard Carrier also considers the mention of the cloths \\"a natural embellishment to such a narrative and thus cannot be trusted to be historical,\\"Carrier. \\"The Plausibility of Theft\\", p. 353. since historians of the era would often illustrate such scenes with plausible minor details that lack a source, similar to military historians describing specific sword interplay. ===Ritual purity=== Some apologists note that the disciples, as practicing Jews, could not come near a dead body without breaking ritual purity regulations. Exceptions included the nearest male relative could claim a dead body and women. Thus, the fact that women discovered the empty tomb first is seen as very plausible, and the (presumably devout) disciples taking the body is seen as a less likely explanation. However, if a genuine conspiracy was afoot, breaking purity is unlikely to have stopped the conspirators, and grave robbers violate this law constantly by profession. If Jesus's family reclaimed the body, this would not apply either. It does, however, make it less plausible other Jews would have stolen the body. ==See also== * Crucifixion and Resurrection of Jesus * Vision hypothesis * Swoon hypothesis * Historical Jesus * Historicity of Jesus * Empty tomb * Religious perspectives on Jesus ==References== * * Category:Historicity and origin of the Resurrection of Jesus Category:Death conspiracy theories Category:Fringe theories ","title":"Stolen body hypothesis"},{"id":"2546657","text":"Mental Notes is the 1975 debut album by New Zealand art rock band Split Enz.

He is best known for his time in the professional wrestling promotions World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment. ==Biography== Sahadi attended college and earned a degree in mathematics, but had grown disenchanted with mathematics by the time he graduated. He spent the summer following his graduation painting houses before his father obtained him a Sunday job working for NBC Sports as a \\"logger\\", a job which required him to watch football games broadcast on NBC and take a detailed record of the events of the game in order to help with the production of highlight reels. After the football season ended, Sahadi began working in the sports promotions department as a production assistant. Two years later, he was made Highlight Supervisor, producing packages which would be sent to Bob Costas, who would add a voiceover. Sahadi was eventually promoted to the position of Manager of On-Air Promotions for NBC Sports, and produced advertising campaigns for the NFL, NBA and the 1992 Summer Olympics. It was then that Sahadi began to come into conflict with his employees, as, while he wanted to create fast-paced video packages, NBC favored a more sedate editing style. When he was approached by the World Wrestling Federation (a national professional wrestling promotion) before the 1992 Olympics, Sahadi accepted their job offer. ===World Wrestling Federation / Entertainment (1992–2003)=== Sahadi began working for the WWF on October 19, 1992, and was appointed Creative Director of On-air Promotions. In 1995, he headed the production of an opening video for Raw, the flagship television program of the WWF. The ambitious video featured a band playing atop Titan Towers, the corporate headquarters of the WWF, and a helicopter circling the roof. Sahadi would go on to head a team of seven technicians who produced video packages and vignettes designed to promote and advertise wrestlers, television programs, pay-per-views and merchandise. Prior to WrestleMania XIV on March 29, 1998, Sahadi produced a video featuring Pat Patterson, Gorilla Monsoon, Ernie Ladd, Killer Kowalski and Sahadi's close friend \\"Classy\\" Freddie Blassie which reduced WWF owner Vince McMahon to tears. At the 2001 Promax & BDA award ceremony in Miami Beach, Florida, Sahadi, along with two members of his team, Kevin Sullivan and Barry Bross, received seven awards for promotional material. Throughout 2002 and 2003, Sahadi began to grow unhappy which hindered his creative ability with the WWF (now renamed World Wrestling Entertainment, or WWE) product. He objected to the controversial and almost universally unpopular \\"Katie Vick\\" storyline (which culminated in a vignette in which Triple H, dressed as Kane, simulated necrophilia with a mannequin), but was informed that any dissenters would be released from the company. In addition to his creative objections, Sahadi became disillusioned with his executive position and high salary, claiming that \\"I had reached a point in my life where this illusory world had lost all its appeal. I wanted something deeper, more profound in life.\\" In June 2003 Sahadi decided to leave WWE, and negotiated a release with his superior, the WWE Executive Vice President of Television Production, Kevin Dunn. He left WWE one month later. ===Total Nonstop Action Wrestling / Impact Wrestling / Global Force Wrestling (2004–2017)=== Sahadi sold his house, he then proceeded to spend a year hiking through several American national parks before settling in the mountains of North Carolina, where he wrote a novel, Last Call of the Gods. In the summer of 2004, CDHM, an advertising agency based in Connecticut, asked Sahadi to arrange a meeting with Jeff Jarrett, the vice president of TNA Entertainment, LLC, the parent company of Total Nonstop Action Wrestling, the second biggest professional wrestling promotion in the United States. In the course of setting up the meeting, Sahadi befriended Jarrett, and eventually agreed to join TNA as a producer for three months, starting in August 2004. After joining TNA, Sahadi quickly made his presence felt, with a near unanimous consensus that the production values of TNA rose sharply after he joined the promotion. His first major piece of work was the production of the introductory video to Victory Road, the first monthly pay-per-view held by TNA, which was broadcast on November 7, 2004. After the three months had expired, Sahadi decided to remain with TNA. In November 2004, Sahadi discovered that WWE was filming an advertisement for the 2005 Royal Rumble in the Orlando, Florida-based Universal Studios, not far from SoundStage 21, where TNA recorded pay-per-views and episodes of TNA Impact!. TNA decided to send wrestlers Abyss, Traci, Shane Douglas and the 3Live Kru, along with backstage personnel Jeremy Borash, Bill Banks, and Tim Welch, to welcome the WWE employees, bringing them milk, cookies and balloons. The TNA employees confronted their WWE contemporaries outside of the studio in which the commercial was being filmed and handed out their balloons. 3Live Kru member B.G. James commented on the opulence of the WWE buffet, asking if he could have some mahi-mahi, and then asked to speak with Vince McMahon as \\"I made him a bunch of money back in the day\\" (as one-half of the New Age Outlaws and a member of D-Generation X, James was partly responsible for large merchandise sales throughout 1998 and 1999), while fellow 3Live Kru member Konnan commented that McMahon \\"...is a stand up guy, but sometimes he has to sit down to aim\\". Following the event, WWE filed a complaint with Universal Studios and ordered TNA to hand over the footage or face a lawsuit, while several WWE employees contacted and harassed Sahadi, with some threatening physical violence. Possibly as a form of retaliation against Sahadi, Sahadi's father, Lou Sahadi, a long term WWE employee working in the public relations department (and the proposed ghostwriter for Mick Foley's autobiography, Have a Nice Day: A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks) was fired. In addition, Kevin Dunn allegedly threatened to fire any WWE employee who contacted Sahadi. TNA aired the footage at their December 2004 pay-per-view, Turning Point, albeit with the faces of all WWE employees and all instances of the WWE logo blurred. In May 2005 Sahadi began writing a column for TNA called \\"The Spirit of Wrestling\\". The May 24, 2007 column was written in honor of Jeff Jarrett's wife Jill, who died the day prior. Sahadi left Impact Wrestling on December 12, 2017.https://www.pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=114177 === Major League Wrestling (2019) === In early April 2019, Sahadi signed to Major League Wrestling in a backstage role.https://411mania.com/wrestling/fury- road-2019-press-release-konnans-podcast-returning-mlw-radio-network/ === Return to Impact Wrestling (2019-present) === In November 2019, Sahadi announced he would be returning to Impact Wrestling as producer on full time.https://www.wrestlinginc.com/news/2019/11/impact-wrestling-brings-back- director-david-sahadi-662905/ ==References== ==External links== * Category:1961 births Category:21st-century American novelists Category:American columnists Category:American male novelists Category:Living people Category:People from Brooklyn Category:People from Nashville, Tennessee Category:Professional wrestling executives Category:Journalists from New York City Category:21st-century American male writers Category:Novelists from New York (state) Category:21st-century American non-fiction writers Category:American male non-fiction writers ","title":"David Sahadi"},{"id":"2546671","text":"Julio E.

The organization is controversial in Denmark, where it runs a number of schools primarily for troubled youth. Some former students and employees have described the organization and its controlling body, the Teachers Group, as a political cult. Investigations by journalists and law- enforcement agencies have suggested the presence of an extensive money- laundering network within the group's commercial and non-profit ventures, wherein charitable funds are diverted to private businesses and individuals, including several of the group's leaders. In 2013, several of Tvind's senior members were sentenced in absentia to prison in Denmark for suspected tax evasion and embezzlement, after an earlier acquittal. , the defendants, who are wanted by Interpol, are believed to be hiding in Mexico. ==Overview== Following a provision of the Danish constitution that allows any group to form a school and receive government funding, Tvind has founded numerous private schools across Denmark. According to The Copenhagen Post, Over time, the group's financial dealings grew to encompass various non-profit and commercial enterprises such as African AIDS work, South American plantations and second- hand clothing dealers. Some former members of the group have made allegations that Tvind is run as an authoritarian cult, controlled by an inner circle known as the \\"Teachers Group\\". Its purported leader, Mogens Amdi Petersen, born 9 January 1939 in Tønder, had been in hiding since the 1970s and reappeared in 2002 when apprehended on charges of fraud and tax evasion. , Petersen and a group of the organization's leaders are facing charges of fraud in Denmark. ==History== Tvind School Center in Ulfborg seen from a hot air balloon. Tvind was founded c. 1970 by Petersen, then a young, radical idealist. Petersen is said to have collected about 40 followers and established a government-funded alternative school system for troubled youth in Denmark. In 1972 the Tvind base was founded in West Jutland on a plot of farming land called Tvind, where several schools were built as well as a teachers training college. At that time, all of Tvind's schools received public subsidies in accordance with the very liberal education laws in Denmark. It is located in the countryside near Ulfborg in Western Jutland, Denmark - 12 km from the North Sea. ===1970s and 1980s=== More 'Tvind Schools' began to emerge and after 25 years more than 30 schools have been established all over Denmark and some abroad. An estimated 40,000 children and adults have attended Tvind Schools since the first school was established in 1970. Tvind soon became a popular center for youth counter culture in the 1970s and 1980s. The world's largest electricity producing turbine, known as Tvindkraft or Tvind Power, was constructed on the school grounds in Tvind in the mid 1970s in a collaboration between volunteers, teachers and students. In 2008, The European Association for Renewable Energy awarded Tvind the European Solar Prize for education, in recognition of the effort of planning and building the turbine in the 1970s.\\"Appreciation Tvind School\\". eurosolar.de. Retrieved October 2015. The wind turbine at Tvind Tvindkraft has since supplied the energy needed for the schools in Tvind. The building of Tvindkraft inspired and gave rise to a growing wind mill industry in Denmark. ===Danish government subsidies, Special Act and Danish Supreme Court decision=== From 1970 to 1996, the Tvind schools received government financial support and supervision in accordance with Danish laws for private schools. Official support of The Necessary Teacher Training College, Tvind's volunteer training school in Denmark, had ended four years earlier, in 1992.Explanatory note to Bill No. 506 (Official report of Parliamentary Proceedings 1995/1996) read by Danish Parliament Folketinget, under the heading \\"Økonomiske og administrative konsekvenser\\" shows a grant of 103 million DKK (app. 17 million USD) from the Ministry of Education to 31 Tvind Schools for the year of 1995 only. A Special Act passed in 1996 by the Danish Parliament discontinued the official support beginning January 1, 1997. This act prevented the Tvind schools from receiving such support under the general rules, which they otherwise would have been entitled to.The Supreme Courts Judgement of 19 of February 1999 in . A summary can be found in the Venice Commissions database CODICES: DEN-1999-2-005 In 1999, the Danish Supreme Court — in a unanimous, 11 judge ruling — set aside the Special Act on the grounds that it had circumvented the Danish Constitution. The controversial decision was the first time in the history of Denmark's Constitution that the Supreme Court had ever discarded an act as being unconstitutional. Despite the Court's ruling, the Tvind schools never regained financial support from the Danish government.\\"Tvinds socialpædagogik\\" (7 October 1999) Aktuelt (Copenhagen). p. 10.Dahlin, Ulrik (21 March 2002). \\"Tvinds 'fodringsmaskine'\\".

In the schools for children and youngsters the student base was shifted so that the focus is now on students who have been subjected to abuse, involved with alcohol abuse or other drug abuse, being from immigrant or refugee families with conflict ridden background or being orphans, etc. Financial support for training and education of such young people are available from the social services of the municipalities in Denmark, which are now providing the funds for the school fees and boarding fees. Those schools were named \\"The Small Schools\\" because of many smaller units with different programs.\\"Tvind trives\\" (2 February 1998).

Now collectively known as the \\"DRH Movement\\" (Den Rejsende Højskole in Danish), these schools train volunteers for humanitarian work overseas. Some former DRH Movement students say that even after paying tuition of several thousand dollars, they were required to spend much of their time trying to raise yet more money by what some of them call begging in the streets. Students also complain that the training they received is not recognised by governments or aid agencies.Murphy, Paul (22 August 2008). \\"Concerns raised over college\\", Look North (BBC).

Special programs were established in the late 1970s and the beginning 1980s for young people from the so-called Frontline States in Southern Africa. The programs emphasized on vocational skills. Students from Zimbabwe, South Africa, Mozambique, Angola, Namibia and Guinea Bissau completed such programs. ===Necessary Teachers Training College=== The Necessary Teachers Training College (Det Nødvendige Seminarium or DNS) was established in 1972. The training leads to a diploma in primary and secondary school teaching. ===The Continuation Schools and the Free Schools=== The first Continuation School for students from 14–18 years old was established in Tvind in 1974 and was followed by 6 other continuation schools and 6 international continuation schools with government financial support and supervision. The first International Continuation School received financial support from the EU Commission as well. The First Free School for pupils from 7–16 years old was established in 1976 and was followed by 6 other Free Schools, 5 of them boarding schools. These two school types were discontinued after the Government withdrew its financial support from 1997. ===The Small Schools and The Second Generation School Cooperation=== In 1979, the Small Schools started operations. Many of the students have experienced neglect and other difficult circumstances such as physical abuse and parental alcoholism. Many are \\"runaways\\".Tvinds småskoler—redningsplanke eller skraldespand?\\" (20 March 1996). Ritzaus (Denmark). The Small School at Red House near Buxton operated from 1984 to 1998 with local councils paying 700 pounds a week for the school to house troubled youngsters. More than a dozen former pupils have alleged that they were sexually and physically abused at the school and have even provided photographic evidence. A former Tvind head teacher described the English Small Schools as a “money machine” and alleged that Tvind used the schools to funnel money out of the UK to fund the extravagant lifestyles of Tvind’s leaders. The English Small Schools were closed by inspectors after a 1997 Charity Commission report exposed the financial malfeasance that was taking place. In 2001 a former student successfully sued his child services department for sending him to a Small School and another abusive children’s home. ==Humana People to People== In 1977, Tvind members founded the International Humana People to People Movement to oversee several self- described humanitarian aid projects in the Third World. In Scandinavia the group is known as \\"Ulandshjælp fra Folk til Folk\\" (UFF). Headquartered in Zimbabwe, Humana People to People claims on its website to be a \\"network of non-profit aid organizations in Europe, North America, Africa, Asia and Latin America, all working in the field of international solidarity, cooperation and development.\\"\\"About Us\\"., Humana People to People.

Humana People-to- People's donation bins can be found in many European countries except in Scandinavia, where clothes are collected under the name UFF. In the UK, clothes collection organisations said to be tied to Tvind include the for- profit companies Green World Recycling, Planet Aid UK and Development Aid from People to People UK (DAPP-UK).Durham, Michael (17 December 2000). \\"Charity's recycling claims mislead public\\", The Independent (UK).

Vig was advised by the National Audit Office and the Parliament’s Barrister (Kammeradvokaten) to raise the case accusing Tvind School Center of fraud. Around two years later, the Public Prosecutor in Aalborg dismissed the case - the materials did not contain sufficient evidence for prosecution. According to a 2001 case summary by Danish police and Denmark's Public Prosecutor for Serious Economic Crime, Tvind's scope had by 1992 \\"expanded far beyond pure school activities\\". Such activities were said to include the ownership of Third World fruit plantations, farms, shoe factories and sawmills, aid agencies, used clothing shops as well as the leasing of property, ships and containers.The Chief Constable in Holstebro and The Public Prosecutor for Serious Economic Crime (Denmark) (1 November 2001). \\"Case Summary: The Public Prosecutor v.

The clothes are recycled and sold in third world countries. The proceeds are sent to charitable trust funds established in off shore tax havens. [...] In each of these organizations the funds are ultimately controlled by captioned subjects who divert the money for personal use. Little to no money goes to the charities\\". Danish media begun to air stories accusing Tvind of fraud as early as the late 1970s. Petersen, claiming to be a target for the SIS and the CIA, disappeared in 1979, and was not seen again for the next 22 years. He is alleged to have continued to covertly run his organisation from various locations, subverting Tvind's original humanitarian mission to create a lucrative financial web by diverting charitable funds into private coffers. Petersen's network soon became a business empire based on property and used clothes collection. Tvind has since then grown into a global conglomerate with numerous profit-motivated enterprises reportedly worth hundreds of millions of dollars. Its interests range from farming and timber to property, retail clothing and furniture, with businesses in Europe, the United States, Brazil, Belize, Ecuador, Malaysia and China. Mogens Amdi Petersen in 2002 In February 2002, FBI agents in the U.S. arrested Amdi Petersen between international flights at Los Angeles International Airport. An arrest warrant for Petersen had been issued in 2000 by the international police agency Interpol. A federal judge extradited Petersen to Denmark, where he and his top assistants would face trial for a multimillion-dollar tax fraud and embezzlement scheme.\\"Tvind boss comes home to face the music\\". (19 September 2002). Copenhagen Post (Denmark). Retrieved December 2011. The trial began in 2003. Three years later, on August 31, 2006, Petersen, Tvind spokesperson Poul Jørgensen, top aides Kirsten Larsen and Ruth Sejerøe-Olsen, former chairperson for Tvind's 'Humanitarian Foundation' Bodil Ross Sørensen, financial director Marlene Gunst, and lawyer Kirsten Fuglsbjerg (aka 'Christie Pipps') were all acquitted of charges. However, another former chairperson of Tvind's Humanitarian Foundation, Sten Byrner, was found guilty of fraud and given a one-year conditional sentence. The Public Prosecutor in Denmark immediately appealed the verdict to a higher court. Petersen and four of his co-defendants fled Denmark shortly after being acquitted by the lower court. Poul Jørgensen, who had remained in Denmark for the appeal trial, was found guilty of tax fraud and embezzlement in January 2009, and sentenced to two and a half years imprisonment. According to Danish prosecutors, Jørgensen diverted millions of dollars earmarked for charitable use into private businesses owned by Tvind leaders. In 2013, Petersen and four others were sentenced in absentia to a year in prison for their suspected role in embezzling millions of Danish kroner from the Tvind Humanitarian Fund, an outgrowth of the Tvind schools.

Gilla Brigte was one of two sons of the great Fergus, the builder of the \\"Kingdom\\" of Galloway. ==Background, marriage and family== In the struggle that arose after the death of Fergus between Gille Brigte and Uchtred, Gille Brigte emerged the stronger. The partitioning of Galloway left Gille Brigte with the western part, the part less exposed to the armies of the Scottish and English Kings.Robert the Bruce and the Community of the Realm of Scotland vol. 4, p. 430. Roger Howden calls Uctred, son of Fergus of Galloway, a cousin of King Henry II (gestahenrici secundi benedicici abbatis ed. stubbs rolls ser.i 80), a relationship which is best explained on the supposition that Fergus married a bastard daughter of Henry I. The suggestion in the Scots peerage, s.v. Galloway, that Gilbert, Uctred's brother, had a different mother is contradicted by cal.docs.scoti no.480, where King John calls Duncan, grandson of Fergus, cousin of Uctred, of Carrick his cousin, making Uctred and Gilbert brothers by the same mother We do not know for certain to whom Gille Brigte was married. Richard Oram suggests the strong likelihood that his main wife was a daughter of Donnchad II, Mormaer or Earl of Fife and the most important native lord in Scotland. The introduction of the name Donnchad (or Duncan) into the family naming pattern is some evidence of this, as is the later marriage of Gille Brigte's great-granddaughter Marjorie to the Fife petty-lord Adam de Kilconquhar. Gille Brigte had two known children: *Donnchad *Máel Coluim ==Events of 1174 & approach to England== From 1161 until 1174, Gille Brigte and Uchtred shared the lordship, with Gille Brigte in the west, and Uchtred in the east. In 1174, King William le Lion of Scotland invaded England in an attempt to regain Northumberland. He brought with him the two meic Fergusa, Gille Brigte and Uchtred. During the invasion, William was caught off-guard, and captured while besieging the castle at Alnwick. Benedict of Peterborough reported that: Despite the implications that both brothers were involved, it is clear that only Gilla Brigte was, and that Uchtred opposed him. For Benedict goes on to tell us that, in relation to the same year, Gille Brigte's son Máel Coluim was besieging Uchtred on an island in Galloway. Máel Coluim mac Gille Brigte captured Uchtred. Uchtred was blinded, castrated and had his tongue cut out. What Gille Brigte did at this time might have changed British history for ever. Gille Brigte sent a messenger, and asked King Henry II for direct lordship (i.e. without the Scottish king as a middle man). Henry sent a delegation to investigate. This delegation consisted of Roger de Hoveden and Robert de Vaux. Thanks to the former, we have a record of the embassy. It is reported by Benedict of Peterborough that Gille Brigte offered the King of England a one-off payment of 2000 marks, and a yearly tribute of 500 cows and 500 swine, if the King would \\"remove them [the Galwegians] from the servitude of the king of Scotland\\" (Anderson, p. 258). However, when the delegation discovered the fate of Uchtred, Henry's cousin, they rejected the request. Gille Brigte's fratricide effectively prevented any deal. Gille Brigte's bad fortune was compounded later in the year, when Henry and William signed the Treaty of Falaise. Gille Brigte was forced to come to terms with the two kings. In 1176, Gille Brigte travelled into England, was fined 1000 marks by Henry, and handed over his son Donnchad into Henry's custody as a hostage to ensure good behaviour. ==The Lordship of Gille Brigte== Gille Brigte's reign is characterized by a large degree of hostility towards the Scottish kings. Unlike his brother Uchtred, he was no friend to incoming Normans. He maintained a Gaelic following. Such a policy made him popular in the province, but alienated him from his nominal Franco-Gaelic overlords, King Máel Coluim IV and then King William. William cultivated the loyalty of Uchtred's son Lochlann (Roland), using him as a card in the game for control over the Galwegian lordship. In the 1180s, tension between Gille Brigte and William was high, with Gilla Brigte being known to have made frequent raids into the Scottish controlled territory of eastern Galloway. When Gille Brigte died in 1185, he was at war with William. Gille Brigte's timely death, with Donnchad still in Henry II's custody, eased the way for William to install Lochlann as Gille Brigte's successor. == Footnotes == ==References== * Anderson, A.O., Scottish Annals from English Chroniclers: AD 500 to 1286, (London, 1908) * Oram, Richard, The Lordship of Galloway', (Edinburgh, 2000) Category:1185 deaths Category:12th-century Scottish people Category:History of Galloway Category:Medieval Gaels from Scotland Category:People from Dumfries and Galloway Category:Year of birth unknown Category:Mormaers of Carrick Category:Lords of Galloway ","title":"Gille Brigte of Galloway"},{"id":"2546679","text":"Volvo FM VGT diesel engine with EGR emissions technology Variable-geometry turbochargers (VGTs), occasionally known as variable-nozzle turbines (VNTs), are a type of turbochargers, usually designed to allow the effective aspect ratio of the turbocharger to be altered as conditions change. This is done because the optimum aspect ratio at low engine speeds is very different from that at high engine speeds. If the aspect ratio is too large, the turbo will fail to create boost at low speeds; if the aspect ratio is too small, the turbo will choke the engine at high speeds, leading to high exhaust manifold pressures, high pumping losses, and ultimately lower power output. By altering the geometry of the turbine housing as the engine accelerates, the turbo's aspect ratio can be maintained at its optimum. Because of this, VGTs have a minimal amount of lag, a low boost threshold, and high efficiency at higher engine speeds. ==History== The rotating-vane VGT was first developed under Garrett and patented in 1953. One of the first production cars to use these turbochargers was the 1988 Honda Legend; it used a water-cooled VGT installed on its 2.0-litre V6 engine. The limited-production 1989 Shelby CSX-VNT, with only 500 examples produced, was equipped with a 2.2-litre Chrysler K engine with a Garrett turbo called the VNT-25 (because it used the same compressor and shaft as the fixed-geometry Garrett T-25). In 1991, Fiat incorporated a VGT into the Croma's direct-injected turbodiesel. The Peugeot 405 T16, launched in 1992, used a Garrett VAT25 variable-geometry turbocharger on its 2.0-litre 16-valve engine. The 2007 Porsche 911 Turbo has twin variable- geometry turbochargers on its 3.6-litre horizontally-opposed six-cylinder gasoline engine. The 2015 Koenigsegg One:1 (named after its power-to-weight ratio of 1:1) uses twin variable-geometry turbochargers on its 5.0-litre V8 engine, allowing it to produce 1361 horsepower. == Common designs == The two most common implementations of VGTs are as follows: For light-duty engines (passenger cars, race cars, and light commercial vehicles), the turbine's vanes rotate in unison, relative to its hub, to vary its pitch and cross- sectional area. For heavy-duty engines, the vanes do not rotate, but instead, their effective width is changed. This is usually done by moving the turbine along its axis, partially retracting the vanes within the housing. Alternatively, a partition within the housing may slide back and forth. The area between the edges of the vanes changes, leading to a variable-aspect- ratio system with fewer moving parts. VGTs may be controlled by a membrane vacuum actuator, electric servo, 3-phase electric actuation, hydraulic actuator, or pneumatic actuator using air brake pressure. Unlike fixed- geometry turbines, VGTs do not require a wastegate. == Use == VGTs tend to be much more common on diesel engines, as lower exhaust temperatures mean they are less prone to failure. Early gasoline-engine VGTs required significant pre-charge cooling to extend the turbocharger life to reasonable levels, but advances in technology have improved their resistance to high-temperature gasoline exhaust, and they have started to appear increasingly in gasoline- engined cars. Typically, VGTs are only found in OEM applications due to the level of coordination required to keep the vanes in the most optimal position for whatever state the engine is in. However, there are aftermarket VGT control units available, and some high-end aftermarket engine management systems can control VGTs as well. In trucks, VGTs are also used to control the ratio of exhaust recirculated back to the engine inlet (they can be controlled to selectively increase the exhaust manifold pressure until it exceeds the inlet manifold pressure, which promotes exhaust gas recirculation). Although excessive engine backpressure is detrimental to overall fuel efficiency, ensuring a sufficient EGR rate even during transient events (such as gear changes) can be sufficient to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions down to that required by emissions legislation (e.g., Euro 5 for Europe and EPA 10 for the USA). Another use for sliding-vane turbochargers is as a downstream exhaust brake, so that an extra exhaust throttle valve is not needed. The mechanism can also be deliberately modified to reduce the turbine efficiency in a pre- defined position. This mode can be selected to sustain a raised exhaust temperature to promote \\"light-off\\" and \\"regeneration\\" of a diesel particulate filter (this involves heating the carbon particles stuck in the filter until they oxidize away in a semi-self-sustaining reaction - rather like the self- cleaning process some ovens offer). Actuation of a VGT for EGR flow control, or to implement braking or regeneration modes in general, requires hydraulic actuators or electric servos. == Manufacturers == Several companies manufacture and supply rotating-vane variable-geometry turbochargers, including Garrett, BorgWarner, and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. This design is mostly limited to small engines and light-duty applications (passenger cars, race cars and light commercial vehicles). The main supplier of sliding-vane VGTs is Holset Engineering. == References == == External links == * How does Variable Turbine Geometry Work? * Variable Turbine Geometry (VTG) explanation with pictures * Cummins Turbochargers & Air Handling Category:Turbochargers ","title":"Variable-geometry turbocharger"},{"id":"2546701","text":"The Count The Count is Charlie Chaplin's fifth film for Mutual Film Corporation in 1916.

He was considered to be the first \\"modern\\" artist from Indonesia (then Dutch East Indies), and his paintings corresponded with nineteenth- century romanticism which was popular in Europe at the time. He also expressed his cultural roots and inventiveness in his work. ==Early life== Raden Saleh Syarif Bustaman was born in 1807 in Semarang on the island of Java in the Dutch East Indies (present-day Indonesia). He was born into a noble Hadhrami family where his father was Sayyid Husen bin Alwi bin Awal bin Yahya, an Indonesian of Arab descent. He was the grandson of Sayyid Abdullah Bustaman maternally. Raden Saleh was connected to Habib Ali Kwitang through his sister, Roqayah, who was married to Ali Kwitang's father Abdurrahman but had no children. ==Travel to Europe== Raden Saleh, c. 1840, credited to Friedrich Carl Albert Schreuel Young Raden Saleh was first taught in Bogor by the Belgian artist A.J. Payen. Payen acknowledged the youth's talent, and persuaded the colonial government of the Netherlands to send Raden Saleh to the Netherlands to study art. He arrived in Europe in 1829 and began to study under Cornelius Kruseman and Andreas Schelfhout. It was from Kruseman that Raden Saleh studied his skills in portraiture, and later was accepted at various European courts where he was assigned to do portraits. While in Europe, in 1836 Saleh became the first indigenous Indonesian to be initiated into Freemasonry. From 1839, he spent five years at the court of Ernest I, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, who became an important patron.Art Daily- Rare Work by Javanese Artist Raden Saleh to be Offered at Christie's Retrieved February 17, 2015 From Schelfhout, Raden Saleh furthered his skills as a landscape painter. Raden Saleh visited several European cities, as well as Algiers. In The Hague, a lion tamer allowed Raden Saleh to study his lion, and from that his most famous painting of animal fights was created, which subsequently brought fame to the artist. Many of his paintings were exhibited at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam. Several of his paintings were destroyed when the Colonial Dutch pavilion in Paris was burnt in 1931. ==Return to Dutch East Indies== Raden Saleh's house in Cikini in 1875–1885 Raden Saleh in 1872 Raden Saleh returned to Dutch East Indies in 1852,\\"Pioneer Between Worlds\\", National Geographic Indonesia, 2012. after living in Europe for 20 years. He worked as conservator for the colonial collection of government art and continued painting portraits of the Javanese aristocracy, and many more landscape paintings. Returning to Java, he expressed his uneasiness of living in the colonies, stating that \\"here, people only talks about coffee and sugar, then sugar and coffee\\" in one of his letters. Upon returning, Saleh built a house in Cikini (now Cikini Hospital), based on the Callenberg Castle where he had stayed during his European travels 1844. Surrounded by vast grounds, most of them were converted into public gardens in 1862, and were closed in the turn of the century. In 1960, the Taman Ismail Marzuki was built in the former gardens. The house itself is still used today as a hospital. He married a young aristocratic woman of Yogyakarta Sultanate, Raden Ayu Danudirdja, in 1867 and subsequently moved to Bogor, where he rented a house near the Bogor Botanical Gardens with a view of Mount Salak. He later took his wife to travel in Europe, visiting countries such as the Netherlands, France, Germany, and Italy. His wife however contracted an illness while in Paris, the exact illness is still not known, and was so severe that they both immediately returned to Bogor. She died on 31 July 1880, following her husband's death three months earlier. ==Death== On Friday morning, 23 April 1880, Saleh suddenly fell sick. He claimed that he was poisoned by one of his servants, but later examination showed that his blood flow was disrupted due to a clot near his heart. Saleh was buried two days later in Kampung Empang, Bogor. As reported in Javanese Bode newspaper, 28 April 1880, his funeral was \\"attended by various land lords and Dutch officials, and even by curious students from nearby school.\\" ==Painting== During his stay in Paris, Saleh met Horace Vernet whose painting frequently took themes of African wildlife. Compared to Vernet, Saleh's painting seems to be more influenced by the romantic painter Eugène Delacroix. This could be seen in one of Saleh's work, Hunting Lion, 1840, which has similar composition to Delacroix's Liberty Leading the People. However, Werner Kraus, a researcher in the Southeast-Asian Art Center of Passau, Germany, said that Saleh \\"never mentioned Delacroix. Perhaps he saw Delacroix's, and possibly Vernet's, works during an exhibition.\\" ===The Arrest of Pangeran Diponegoro=== The Arrest of Pangeran Diponegoro, 1857, Merdeka Palace Museum, Jakarta. Raden Saleh is particularly remembered for his historical painting, The Arrest of Pangeran Diponegoro, which depicted the betrayal of the rebel leader Prince Diponegoro by the colonial government, thus ending the Java War in 1830. The Prince was tricked into entering Dutch custody near Magelang, believing he was there for negotiations of a possible cease-fire. He was captured through treachery and later deported. The event had been previously painted by a Dutch painter Nicolaas Pieneman, commissioned by Lieutenant General Hendrik Merkus de Kock. It is thought that Saleh saw this painting during his stay in Europe. Saleh made significant changes in his version of the painting; Pieneman painted the scene from the right, Saleh from the left. Pieneman depicts Diponegoro with resigned expression, while in Saleh's he appears to be outraged. Pieneman gave his painting the title Submission of Prince Diponegoro, while Saleh gave The Arrest of Pangeran Diponegoro. It is known that Saleh deliberately painted Diponegoro's Dutch captors with large heads to make them appear monstrous, as opposed to the more proportionally depicted Javanese. Raden Saleh’s work has been regarded as a sign of incipient nationalism in what was then the Dutch East Indies. This can also be seen it the depiction of Diponegoro's men. Pieneman had never been to the Indies, and so depicted Diponegoro's men in a more Arabic fashion. Saleh's version has a more accurate depiction of native Javanese clothing, with some figures wearing batik and blangkon. Saleh finished this painting in 1857 and presented it to Willem III of Netherlands in The Hague. It was returned to Indonesia in 1978 as a realization of a cultural agreement between the two countries in 1969, regarding the return of cultural items which were taken, lent, or exchanged to the Dutch in the previous eras. Even though the painting did not fall under any of those categories, because Saleh presented it to the King of the Netherlands and it was never in the possession of Indonesia, it was nevertheless returned as a gift from the Royal Palace of Amsterdam, and is currently displayed at the Merdeka Palace Museum in Jakarta. ===Works=== Raden Saleh Bustaman Winterlandschaft.jpgWinter Scenery (1830) JeanChrétienBaud.jpg Portrait of Jean Chrétien Baud (1835) Raden Sarief Bastaman Saleh - Johannes Graaf van den Bosch.jpg Portrait of Johannes van den Bosch (1836) Posthumous Portrait of Herman Willem Daendels, Governor- General of the Dutch East Indies - Rd Saleh.jpgPortrait of Herman Willem Daendels (1838) Raden Sarief Bustaman Saleh - Lion attacking a horse.jpgLion attacking a horse (1840) Raden Saleh - Self Portrait.jpgSelf-portrait (1841) File:Raden Saleh Last Resort 1842.jpgLast Resort (1842) Raden Saleh - hunt.jpgDeer Hunt (1846) Raden Saleh - Javanese Landscape, with Tigers Listening to the Sound of a Travelling Group.jpgJavanese Landscape, with Tigers Listening to the Sound of a Travelling Group (1849) Raden Saleh - Six Horsemen Chasing Deer, 1860.jpgSix Horsemen Chasing Deer (1860) COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Een overstroming op Java TMnr 3728-464.jpgA Flood in Java (1865-1875) Raden Saleh - Javanese Mail Station, 1876.jpgJavanese Mail Station (1876) Raden Saleh - Study of walking tiger.jpgWatercolor study of a walking tiger Raden Saleh, circle of - A landscape in the Dutch East Indies.jpgA landscape in the Dutch East Indie ==See also== *Habib Ali Kwitang ==References== ==Further reading== *Karnadi, Koes (editor) 2006) Modern Indonesian art : from Raden Saleh to the present day introduction by Suwarno Wisetrotomo; with contributions by Agung Hujatnikajennong ...

Pudney published several collections of poetry during the war, including Dispersal Point (1942) and South of Forty (1943), the latter describing his experiences in North Africa. Both collections sold over 250,000 copies between them.White, Michael. 'Johnny Head-in-Air', in The Guardian, 6 April, 1972, p 10 One contemporary reviewer noted that the poems were \\"immediately topical and intended to reach a less poetically sophisticated audience\\", and that they showed \\"how completely he has succeeded in combining the journalist and the poet. That is no easy matter, for the one usually swamps the other\\".The Listener, 23 September 1943, p 357 ==Later career== In the general election of July 1945, Pudney stood as the Labour Party candidate for Sevenoaks, polling 14,947 votes, or 36%.The International Who's Who (Europa Publications Limited, 1963) p. 857UK General Election results July 1945 at keele.ac.uk, accessed 10 January 2009 (The sitting Conservative MP Charles Ponsonby was re-elected, with 46% of the vote). After the war, he continued to write and worked as a journalist and editor. He was the book critic for the Daily Express from 1945 and with the News Review from 1948 to 1950. He then shifted into publishing, as a director and literary adviser to Evans Brothers, Ltd (1950-1953) and Putnam & Co Ltd (1953-1963). At Evans, Pudney bolstered the company's long- standing children's catalogue with his own boys adventures, the 11 volume 'Fred and I' series (Monday Adventure, Spring Adventure etc). One of them, Thursday Adventure (1955) was filmed as The Stolen Airliner (1955).'John Pudney' in The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction They featured classic front cover and internal illustrations by artists such as Ley Kenyon (1913-1990) and Douglas Relf.Aces High: Aviation Gallery The later six volumes of Hartwarp adventures for younger children were published by Hamish Hamilton. Both series were popular and sold well in the 1950s and 1960s, but they have gone out of print. More significantly, at Evans, Pudney commissioned the Australian fighter pilot and prisoner-of-war Paul Brickhill to come to England and write The Great Escape, which Evans published in 1950; it attracted much attention. He had suggested to the Air Historical Branch of the British Air Ministry that Brickhill should be considered as the author of a history of 617 Squadron. After the success of The Great Escape, it was also published by Evans as The Dam Busters (1951), which sold over one million copies in its first 50 years.Dando-Collins, Stephen. The Hero Maker: A Biography of Paul Brickhill (2016) Of his novels, The Net (1952, set in an aeronautical research station) and Thin Air (1961) were well received. The Net was filmed by director Anthony Asquith in 1953.Pendo, Stephen. Aviation in the Cinema. Lanham, Maryland: Scarecrow Press, 1985. . The same year Pudney wrote the script for the documentary Elizabeth is Queen for Associated British Pathé, which received a BAFTA award. Between 1949 and 1963, he edited an annual anthology called Pick of Today's Short Stories. Commissioned non-fiction (particularly aeronautical) became an important source of income for Pudney in his later years. Among these works were a history of the British state airline B.O.A.C. (The Seven Skies, 1959), and of Courage Brewery (A Draught of Contentment (1971).Text based on A Draught of Contentment at Courage & Co However, poetry remained the most important to him. His later work, from the collection Spill Out (1967) onward, took on a more ironic stance but was still vernacular, rather than academic, a period reflected in his second Selected Poems collection of 1973. One of his book blurbs describes him as \\"a poet who just missed being an intellectual\\". His final two poems appeared in the Times Literary Supplement a few days after his death. ==Private life== On 30 October 1934 Pudney married the Fabian feminist Crystal Selwyn Herbert (1915-1999), the daughter of A. P. Herbert, a writer and independent Member of Parliament. They first lived in Cornwall in a converted lifeboat, then took a farm in Essex.Crystal Hale obituary in The Guardian, 8 December 1999, p 24 There were two daughters and a son. They divorced in 1955, and Pudney immediately married his second wife, Monica Forbes Curtis of the Forbes family. She helped him recover from his alcoholism, to which he publicly confessed in 1965 and emerged cured in 1967 - despite a hit-and-run accident in the middle that broke both his legs and dislocated his shoulder. The recovery process became a subject for his writing. According to Michael White Spill Out was written \\"half of it on the booze and half off, and he didn't remember which half was which\\". In 1976 Pudney developed cancer of the throat from which he died nearly two years later in much pain. He wrote about his illness unflinchingly in his autobiographical Thank Goodness for Cake, posthumously published in 1978. John Pudney's daughter Tessa (1942-2004) was an academic best known for her work in media studies at Sheffield Hallam University. She married the film critic Victor Perkins in the 1960s.Tessa Perkins obituary in The Guardian, 4 November 2004 Their son, Toby Perkins, is the Labour Member of Parliament for Chesterfield. ==Works== ===Poetry=== *Spring Encounter (1933) *Open the Sky (Boriswood 1934) *Dispersal Point and other Air Poems (1942) *The Grass Grew All Round (1942) *Beyond This Disregard (1943) *South of Forty (1943) *Ten Summers: Poems 1933-1943 (1944) *Almanack of Hope: Sonnets (1944) *Air Force Poetry (1944) (anthology, edited with Henry Treece) *Flight above Cloud (1944) *World Still There (1945) *Selected Poems (1946) *Low Life (1947) *Commemorations (1948) *Sixpenny Songs (1953) *Collected Poems (1957) *The Trampoline (1959) *Spill Out: Poems and Ballads (1967) *Spandrels: Poems and Ballads (1969) *Take This Orange: Poems and Ballads (1971) *Selected Poems 1967-1973 (1973) *Living in a One-Sided House (1976) *Writers' Workshop, poetry anthology publication, editor with Norman Hidden and Michael Johnson (from 1967)Durham University.

High-performance integrated circuits have traditionally been characterized by the clock frequency at which they operate. Measuring the ability of a circuit to operate at the specified speed requires an ability to measure, during the design process, its delay at numerous steps. Moreover, delay calculation must be incorporated into the inner loop of timing optimizers at various phases of design, such as logic synthesis, layout (placement and routing), and in in-place optimizations performed late in the design cycle. While such timing measurements can theoretically be performed using a rigorous circuit simulation, such an approach is liable to be too slow to be practical. Static timing analysis plays a vital role in facilitating the fast and reasonably accurate measurement of circuit timing. The speedup comes from the use of simplified timing models and by mostly ignoring logical interactions in circuits. This has become a mainstay of design over the last few decades. One of the earliest descriptions of a static timing approach was based on the Program Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT), in 1966. More modern versions and algorithms appeared in the early 1980s. == Purpose == In a synchronous digital system, data is supposed to move in lockstep, advancing one stage on each tick of the clock signal. This is enforced by synchronizing elements such as flip-flops or latches, which copy their input to their output when instructed to do so by the clock. Only two kinds of timing errors are possible in such a system: *A Max time violation, when a signal arrives too late, and misses the time when it should advance.These are more commonly known as setup violations/checks which actually are a subset of max time violations involving a cycle shift on synchronous paths. *A Min time violation, when an input signal changes too soon after the clock's active transition. These are more commonly known as hold violations/checks which actually are a subset of min time violations in synchronous path. The time when a signal arrives can vary due to many reasons. The input data may vary, the circuit may perform different operations, the temperature and voltage may change, and there are manufacturing differences in the exact construction of each part. The main goal of static timing analysis is to verify that despite these possible variations, all signals will arrive neither too early nor too late, and hence proper circuit operation can be assured. Since STA is capable of verifying every path, it can detect other problems like glitches, slow paths and clock skew. == Definitions == * The critical path is defined as the path between an input and an output with the maximum delay. Once the circuit timing has been computed by one of the techniques listed below, the critical path can easily be found by using a traceback method. * The arrival time of a signal is the time elapsed for a signal to arrive at a certain point. The reference, or time 0.0, is often taken as the arrival time of a clock signal. To calculate the arrival time, delay calculation of all the components in the path will be required. Arrival times, and indeed almost all times in timing analysis, are normally kept as a pair of values - the earliest possible time at which a signal can change, and the latest. * Another useful concept is required time. This is the latest time at which a signal can arrive without making the clock cycle longer than desired. The computation of the required time proceeds as follows: at each primary output, the required times for rise/fall are set according to the specifications provided to the circuit. Next, a backward topological traversal is carried out, processing each gate when the required times at all of its fanouts are known. * The slack associated with each connection is the difference between the required time and the arrival time. A positive slack s at some node implies that the arrival time at that node may be increased by s, without affecting the overall delay of the circuit. Conversely, negative slack implies that a path is too slow, and the path must be sped up (or the reference signal delayed) if the whole circuit is to work at the desired speed. ==Corners and STA== Quite often, designers will want to qualify their design across many conditions. Behavior of an electronic circuit is often dependent on various factors in its environment like temperature or local voltage variations. In such a case either STA needs to be performed for more than one such set of conditions, or STA must be prepared to work with a range of possible delays for each component, as opposed to a single value. With proper techniques, the patterns of condition variations are characterized and their extremes are recorded. Each extreme condition can be termed as a corner. Extremes in cell characteristics can be considered as ‘process, voltage and temperature (PVT) corners’ and extremes in net characteristics can be considered as ‘extraction corners’. Then each combination pattern of PVT extraction corners is referred to as a ‘timing corner’ as it represents a point where timing will be extreme. If the design works at each extreme condition, then under the assumption of monotonic behavior, the design is also qualified for all intermediate points. The use of corners in static timing analysis has several limitations. It may be overly optimistic, since it assumes perfect tracking: if one gate is fast, all gates are assumed fast, or if the voltage is low for one gate, it is also low for all others. Corners may also be overly pessimistic, for the worst case corner may seldom occur. In an IC, for example, it may not be rare to have one metal layer at the thin or thick end of its allowed range, but it would be very rare for all 10 layers to be at the same limit, since they are manufactured independently. Statistical STA, which replaces delays with distributions, and tracking with correlation, offers a more sophisticated approach to the same problem. ==The most prominent techniques for STA == In static timing analysis, the word static alludes to the fact that this timing analysis is carried out in an input-independent manner, and purports to find the worst-case delay of the circuit over all possible input combinations. The computational efficiency (linear in the number of edges in the graph) of such an approach has resulted in its widespread use, even though it has some limitations. A method that is commonly referred to as PERT is popularly used in STA. However, PERT is a misnomer, and the so-called PERT method discussed in most of the literature on timing analysis refers to the critical path method (CPM) that is widely used in project management. While the CPM-based methods are the dominant ones in use today, other methods for traversing circuit graphs, such as depth-first search, have been used by various timing analyzers. == Interface Timing Analysis == Many of the common problems in chip designing are related to interface timing between different components of the design. These can arise because of many factors including incomplete simulation models, lack of test cases to properly verify interface timing, requirements for synchronization, incorrect interface specifications, and lack of designer understanding of a component supplied as a 'black box'. There are specialized CAD tools designed explicitly to analyze interface timing, just as there are specific CAD tools to verify that an implementation of an interface conforms to the functional specification (using techniques such as model checking). ==Statistical static timing analysis (SSTA) == Statistical static timing analysis (SSTA) is a procedure that is becoming increasingly necessary to handle the complexities of process and environmental variations in integrated circuits. ==See also== * Dynamic timing verification * Electronic design automation * Integrated circuit design * Logic analyzer—for verification of STA * Logic simulation * Simulation * Timing margin * Worst-case execution time * Signoff (electronic design automation) == Notes == == References == *Electronic Design Automation For Integrated Circuits Handbook, by Lavagno, Martin, and Scheffer, A survey of the field.

It was the home of Ygnacio del Valle, a Californio alcalde of the Pueblo de Los Angeles in the 19th century and later elected member of the California State Assembly. The ranch was known as the Home of Ramona because it was widely believed to have been the setting of the popular 1884 novel Ramona by Helen Hunt Jackson. The novel helped to raise awareness about the Californio lifestyle and romanticized \\"the mission and rancho era of California history.\\" The working ranch is a prime example of an early California rancho in its original rural setting. It was the source of the first commercially grown oranges in Ventura County. It is one of the few remaining citrus growers in Southern California. State Route 126 bisects the property, with most of the main buildings located south of the highway, and a few buildings on the north. The main adobe is one of the few extant Spanish Colonial buildings left in the state. Most of the other buildings are done in Mission Revival or Spanish Colonial Revival styles, both of which are derivatives of the original. Rancho Camulos is designated a National Historic Landmark, listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and has also been designated as a California Historical Landmark. Many of the buildings and grounds are open to the public as a museum of this period in California history. ==History== Aerial view of the rancho in the Santa Clara River Valley in 1888, with vineyards on the left and the Santa Clara River in the background. In 1769, the Spanish Portola expedition, the first Europeans known to see inland areas of California, traveled downriver by boat and camped by the Santa Clara River on August 10. Their exact location is unknown but this area was later included in the territory of Rancho Camulos. Fray Juan Crespi, a Franciscan missionary traveling with the expedition, named the valley Cañada de Santa Clara. The indigenous Tataviam people had a village here named Kamulus (meaning \\"juniper\\".) The area was used as early as 1804 by Mission San Fernando Rey de España for growing crops and as a grazing area for livestock. The population of this relatively isolated area (only traversed by the El Camino Real), as recorded by William Edward Petty Hartnell during his inspection of the mission in 1839, was 416. It was included in the Rancho San Francisco granted to Del Valle's father, Antonio del Valle, administrator of Mission San Fernando, by Governor Juan B. Alvarado on January 22, 1839, after the secularization of the missions. Ygnacio del Valle After Antonio's death in 1841, his son Ygnacio inherited Rancho San Francisco. This action was challenged in court by his father's second wife. Nevertheless, by 1853 Del Valle constructed a four-room adobe house and a corral at Camulos. By 1857, the land title dispute was settled. Ygnacio got the western portion and the remainder was split among Antonio's children and his second wife. Del Valle bought back some of the other portions from his family, as well as the neighboring Rancho Temescal to the north, and began livestock operations on the expanded area. The younger Del Valle and his family did not live on the ranch initially, instead settling in a house on what is now Olvera Street in Los Angeles. The Del Valle family did not move back to Camulos, which he had expanded, until 1861. During this time, the ranch was overseen by José Antonio Salazar, Del Valle's majordomo. Although the rancho was associated with Ramona and Mexican California, the house was not constructed until after the United States acquired the territory and California was admitted as a state. The Del Valle family never lived there under Mexican rule. In the 1860s, a drought forced Del Valle to sell off much of his land, but he retained Camulos and prospered there. By the time of his death in 1880, he had expanded the house to twenty rooms, and the compound had become a self-sustaining ranch, complete with a brick winery, chapel, barn and workers' housing. Records indicate that in 1870 the ranch was largest vintner in the area. A stagecoach line opened in 1874 and in 1887, Southern Pacific ran a rail line past the ranch, including a depot at Camulos, ending the ranch's isolation. In 1908, the Del Valle Company was incorporated by Ygnacio's children, but by 1924, they had sold the property to August Rübel, a native of Zürich, Switzerland. Upon its sale, the Los Angeles Times lamented that: > An era in the history of California closed yesterday. The Del Valles of > Camulos bade farewell to the homestead where they have lived in successive > generations since Antonio del Valle. It was the passing of the old regime. > They are said to be the last of the old Spanish families who held in > unbroken succession to the ancestral acres. –Los Angeles Times, August 11, > 1924 Rübel continued operating the ranch in the same manner as the Del Valles, employing many of same workers. He had served in the American Field Service during World War I and when World War II broke out, he volunteered for active duty again. He died while serving in Tunisia in 1943. After his death, his widow Mary married a man named Edwin Burger, who was not as interested in maintaining the rancho. After Mary's death in 1968, Burger closed the ranch entirely. The buildings and grounds were left untended for years. Rübel's heirs regained control of the property after the 1994 Northridge earthquake, which had damaged a number of buildings on the rancho. The Rübel family restored commercial citrus production and set about repairing the earthquake damage. They successfully lobbied to have Camulos listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996. In 2000, it was further designated a National Historic Landmark. and Although the main house was restored in 1996, funding was not available to restore the smaller buildings until 2006, with construction completed in spring 2007. The rancho is on State Route 126, but little is visible from the highway. The driveway/parking lot and grounds immediate to the highway were used as a filming location for the 1970 science- fiction television movie The Love War. ===Agricultural development=== Del Valle acquired his first Valencia orange seedlings in 1857 from his friend William Wolfskill. The fruit from these trees was the first to be commercially grown in what is now Ventura County, although this was relatively small scale because the crops had to be taken by wagon to Los Angeles. A Southern Pacific line opened in 1876 seventeen miles (27 km) to the east in Saugus, providing a more convenient form of transport. However, the primary agricultural product from Rancho Camulos was wine. Ninety acres (360,000 m²) of vineyards were planted in the 1860s and Camulos wines and brandies were known throughout Los Angeles and Santa Barbara. In 1870, records indicate Camulos was largest of the four vintners in the San Buenaventura Township of Santa Barbara County, with 45 tons (40,900 kg) of grapes grown, making 6,000 US gallons (23,000 L) of wine and 800 US gallons (3,000 L) of brandy. In addition to oranges and grapes, the ranch produced almonds, walnuts, apricots, wheat, corn and barley. Flower petals from roses grown at Camulos were shipped to Europe to make perfume. Over the years, the vineyards were replaced by other fruits. Today, about are under cultivation, most of it oranges, but lemons, grapefruit, and avocados are grown too. This makes Camulos a rare instance of a surviving citrus operation. During the years 1920-45, the citrus industry underwent a period of great growth. In contrast to the natural desert-like conditions of the area, photographs of \\"citrus belts\\" were publicized that helped establish the image of Southern California for the nation as an idyllic farmland. After World War II, urban and suburban development displaced much of the Southern California citrus production, with the notable exception of the Santa Clara River Valley. ===Ramona=== Ramona, published in 1884, was based in part on experiences that Helen Hunt Jackson had had during her visit to Rancho Camulos in 1882. Jackson spent only two hours on the ranch and did not meet Ysabel del Valle, but she had a keen eye for details and used many of her observations in the novel. For example, the altar cloth in the rancho's chapel had a small tear in it which had been mended. In the novel, the character Margarita accidentally tears the altar cloth, and Ramona sews it back together.DeLyser, p. 70 The book became extremely popular and inspired a great deal of tourism, which was stimulated by the improved access possible due to the opening of Southern Pacific railroad lines in Southern California. With all of the interest generated by the book, a number of communities declared that they were the setting for the novel in order to cash in on the boom, most notably Rancho Guajome in San Diego County, which Jackson had also visited prior to writing her book. However, the location of the fictional Moreno Ranch, \\"midway in the valley [between lands] to the east and west, which had once belonged to the Missions of San Fernando and San Bonaventura\\" corresponds to the location of Rancho Camulos, and the physical description of some of the buildings on the fictional ranch accurately describe buildings at Camulos. On the other hand, relative to the other locations in the novel (Ramona's having been married in San Diego and Alessandro's family being from the Temecula area), Camulos seems too distant to be the real location.DeLyser, p. 89 Jackson died in 1885, never having publicly disclosed what locations she drew from for the book. Historians today are unsure whether Moreno Ranch represented a historic site. Postcard from 1906, where the rancho is called the \\"Home of Ramona\\" By 1886, many readers and observers already considered Camulos to be the setting of the novel. Edward Roberts published an article entitled, \\"Ramona's Home: A Visit to the Camulos Ranch, and to the Scenes Described by 'H.H.'\\" in the May 13, 1886 edition of the San Francisco Chronicle. Significantly, he was one of the first to publish an account that blended fact and fiction. The inclusion of his article as an appendix to later versions of the novel only served to cement that association. The first book solely devoted to Ramona and the ranch was published in 1888 by Charles Fletcher Lummis, a close friend of the Del Valles and an admirer of their daughter, the teenage Susana Carmen (nicknamed \\"Susanita\\") del Valle. Lummis took photographs of the buildings and published them in his own book, Home of Ramona: Photographs of Camulos, the Fine Old Spanish Estate Described by Mrs. Helen Hunt Jackson as the Home of \\"Ramona\\". He emphasized that the Del Valles were nothing like the fictional Morenos, who treated Ramona poorly, but he too would mix fact with fiction. For instance, he wrote, \\"[the veranda] is about a hundred feet in length and runs from the door of Father Salvierderra's room to that of Ramona's room.\\"Lummis (1888), as quoted in DeLyser, p. 74 Lummis's goal was to discourage the novel's association with other properties. For the same purpose, Adam Clark Vroman's Ramona Illustrated: The Genesis of the Story of Ramona compared photographs of the rancho's buildings and environs with text from the novel, as well as photographs from competing locations. By 1909, George Wharton James could confidently declare that Camulos was the \\"avowed and accepted home of the heroine\\". Despite the lack of easy access to the ranch and any lodging in the area, tourists flocked to this site. The 1887 completion of the Southern Pacific line increased the number of visitors, as the railroad featured the ranch in its advertisements in order to distinguish the line from its competitors. Although the ranch was not developed for tourism, the Del Valles, with their Californio sense of hospitality, would lodge the visitors. By October 1888, housing visitors was getting to be so expensive for the family that Reginaldo del Valle pressed his mother to stop being so hospitable.DeLyser, p. 77 The tourists could be quite a nuisance, and unscrupulous visitors would steal items from the house as souvenirs, or help themselves to fruit from the orchards.DeLyser, p. 79 Naturally, the name Camulos became so tied to the novel that many people began to use it instead of the original \\"Moreno Ranch\\" when referring to the novel. An 1897 play based on the book was called, \\"Ramona, or the Bells of Camulos\\". In Virginia Calhoun's 1905 stage adaptation, characters in the play called the ranch Camulos as well.DeLyser, p. 80 Given the general belief that Camulos was the original setting of the novel, D. W. Griffith shot portions of his 1910 silent film adaptation at the rancho, using the chapel, the adobe and patio, and the nearby mountains as backdrops. Paintings and photographs of the rancho by noted artists such as Adam Clark Vroman, Henry Sandham (who had accompanied Jackson on her initial tour), Henry Chapman Ford, and Alexander Harmer also illustrated later versions of the novel. Home of Ramona branding label Although tourism brought much difficulty to the Del Valles, they were not above capitalizing upon their newfound fame, branding their wine and oranges as the \\"Home of Ramona Brand\\". Their label used the same view of the veranda that had been popularized in postcards. One Tataviam servant girl was said to make quite a bit of money by pretending to be the \\"real Ramona\\" and charging tourists for a photograph.DeLyser, p. 82 Tourists continued to arrive even after the SP relocated its main line in 1903 through the Santa Susana Pass, bypassing Camulos. Two daily trains made stops at Camulos until the service was discontinued in the 1940s, with tourism by automobile having become the preferred method of travel. After the Rübels took ownership in 1924, they continued to welcome visitors in small numbers, converting the second floor of the winery into a small museum with artifacts from the Del Valle family. Today, the rancho hosts an annual \\"Ramona Days\\" festival in October. ==Grounds== Map of the main buildings of Rancho Camulos (map not to scale) Fifteen buildings are open to the public as part of the Rancho Camulos Museum, all of which were built before 1930 and are still in their original locations. They were built mostly in Spanish Colonial or Mission Revival styles (the latter is derived from the former). Later buildings were designed in differing architectural styles, more representative of their period of construction. Landscaping features, such as lawns, flower gardens, ornamental trees, and walkways, separate the residential areas from the working portions of the ranch. The main adobe, also called the Ygnacio del Valle adobe, is a 10,000-square foot (929 m²), twenty-room, U-shaped structure. When initially constructed in 1853, it was an L-shaped four-room house connected with an external corredor (as opposed to an interior hallway), as is typical of the Spanish Colonial style. It is unusual for its time period because around this time, the Monterey style was in vogue, as is evidenced by contemporaneous buildings in Santa Barbara. Los Alamos Ranch House in Santa Barbara County, and Rancho Guajome Adobe and Las Flores Adobe in San Diego County, all National Historic Landmarks, are built in a similar style. The house expanded in several phases. In 1861, before the Del Valle family moved here permanently, they added three additional rooms as well as a free-standing cocina (kitchen). This was to keep fire away from the main building, as well as to keep it cooler. A basement was dug out as the foundation of the new rooms. In the 1870s, another wing was added perpendicular to the 1861 addition. Finally, some time after 1895, one more room was added to the new wing, as well as a breezeway to the kitchen, completing the current shape. Remodeling completed after this time was to the interior only. The basement of the house initially served as the wine storage area. In 1867, the family had a one-and-a-half-story brick winery constructed. After 1900, when wine grapes were no longer grown commercially, this building served as a storage room. Rübel later converted it to a museum for Ramona visitors, complete with Del Valle family artifacts. In the 21st century it is used for storage of farm equipment and automobiles. California Black Walnut (Juglans californica) tree, planted circa 1860s. To the west of the main house is a large California Black Walnut (Juglans californica) tree that was most likely planted by Juventino del Valle in the 1860s. It measures in circumference and its branches spread out almost half an acre (2,000 m²). It is believed to be the largest Black Walnut tree in the area. The wooden chapel was constructed around 1867, replacing a makeshift chapel that had been set up in 1861. After the secularization of the missions, this chapel became known as the \\"lost mission\\", the only place of worship between Mission San Fernando and Mission San Buenaventura. Directly to the northwest of the chapel is a bell structure. It originally contained three bells on a freestanding frame, which were used to call worshipers to Mass. The largest and a second, slightly smaller bell were cast at Kodiak, Alaska. The smaller one had previously been used at Mission San Fernando and may have been relocated to Camulos by Antonio del Valle when he was administrator at San Fernando. The third, and smallest bell, is missing. The exact dates of construction of the barn, gas station, and bunkhouse are unknown, but the American Craftsman style of architecture indicates it was between 1910 to 1916, when this was popular. The barn is located to the northwest of the living quarters, in the main work area. The gas station and bunkhouse are not depicted on the map. The small adobe, next to the highway, was built by Nachito del Valle. This Spanish Colonial Revival house was constructed around 1920. It was damaged severely in the 1994 earthquake. Since its reconstruction, it has served as the museum's visitor center. The ranch foreman’s house, an adobe that serves as the visitor center. The schoolhouse, constructed in 1930, was the last structure to be built on the property. It was built by Rübel for his and his bookkeeper's families and designed to match the main adobe. Few buildings are left on the north side of the highway. The most notable are the wooden Southern Pacific saltbox-style section house and workers' bunkhouse, both built in 1887. A train depot and post office both stood in this area, but have been torn down. Three extant farmworkers' bungalows, built by the Del Valle family in 1916, are located west of the section house. ==Historic designations== *United States National Historic Landmarkadded February 16, 2000 *United States National Register of Historic Placesreference number 96001137, added November 1, 1996 *California Historical Landmarknumber 553 ==See also== *List of Registered Historic Places in Ventura County, California *Ventura County Historic Landmarks & Points of Interest *List of ranchos of California ==Notes== ==References== ===Citations=== ===Sources=== * ==External links== *Rancho Camulos Museum web site *Rancho Camulos, Santa Clarita Valley Historical Society *NRHP Registration form, San Buenaventura Research Associates Category:Adobe buildings and structures in California Camulos, Rancho Category:History of Ventura County, California Category:Museums in Ventura County, California Category:Parks in Ventura County, California Category:Open-air museums in California Category:Historic house museums in California Category:Houses in Ventura County, California Camulos, Rancho Category:California Historical Landmarks Category:Santa Clara River (California) Category:National Historic Landmarks in California Category:Ranches on the National Register of Historic Places in California Category:Houses completed in 1853 Category:Mission Revival architecture in California Category:Spanish Colonial Revival architecture in California Category:National Register of Historic Places in Ventura County, California ","title":"Rancho Camulos"},{"id":"2546770","text":"The Church of St Mary Magdalene in Hucknall, Nottinghamshire, is a parish church in the Church of England. The church is Grade II* listed as it is a particularly significant building of more than local interest. ==Background== It is set in a peaceful churchyard overlooking the market place in the centre of the town. The building itself is of great architectural interest and is built on the site of an old Saxon church. The church tower which stands high above the town was constructed in stages between the 12th and 14th century whilst the porch was built in 1320. The medieval church consisted only of a chancel, nave, north aisle and tower but it was considerably enlarged in the Victorian period. The top stage of the tower is 14th century as is the south porch.Pevsner, N. (1951) Nottinghamshire. Harmondsworth: Penguin; p. 85 The rest of the building is the result of extensive restoration work which began in 1872. The south aisle was added by Evans and Jolly between 1872 and 1874, and the transepts by Robert Charles Clarke in 1887 and 1888. In 1888 the Lady Chapel was re-built, a beautiful example of nineteenth century craftsmanship. The Victorian baptistery which used to contain the 14th century font has now been converted into a Visitor Centre where display boards and wall panels give visitors a chance to find out a little more about the Church. There are also many beautiful carvings and wall mosaics around the church. In 2004, there was a carved stone cross, a Khatchkar, given to the church in memory of the work that the rector had done for Armenia. Hucknall - the only two khatchkar town in Western Europe , St Mary Armenian Church, Toronto, accessed 25 September 2008 The stone which had been at Holgate School was given in thanks for the British people's contributions which enable the rebuilding of Lord Byron School in Gyumri which had been destroyed by an earthquake in 1988.

The son of the poet Geoffrey Chaucer and his wife Philippa Roet, Thomas was linked socially and by family to senior members of the English nobility, though he was himself a commoner. Elected fifteen times to the Parliament of England, he was Speaker of the House of Commons for five parliaments in the early 15th century. ==Parental connections== Arms of Chaucer: Argent, a chief gules overall a lion rampant double queued or, as later quartered by de la Pole, Duke of Suffolk Thomas Chaucer was a relative by marriage of John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster, through his aunt Katherine Swynford. Katherine (born Roet) was the sister of his mother, Philippa Roet. Swynford was first Gaunt's mistress, and then his third wife. Their four children, John Beaufort, Henry Beaufort, Thomas Beaufort and Joan Beaufort, were first cousins to Thomas Chaucer, and all prospered: John's family became Earls and subsequently Dukes of Somerset, Henry a Cardinal, Thomas became Duke of Exeter, Joan became Countess of Westmorland and was grandmother of Kings Edward IV and Richard III. King Henry IV - son of John of Gaunt by his first marriage to Blanche of Lancaster - was half-brother to Thomas Chaucer's Beaufort first cousins. Thomas was able to buy Donnington Castle for his only daughter Alice. ==Marriage== differenced version of these arms, with alteration to the field, in lieu of his paternal arms of Per pale argent and gules, a bend counterchanged, as used by his father the poet Early in life, Thomas Chaucer married Matilda (or Maud) Burghersh, second daughter and coheiress of Sir John Burghersh, nephew of Henry Burghersh (1292-1340), Bishop of Lincoln (1320-1340) and Lord Chancellor of England (1328–1330), younger son of Robert de Burghersh, 1st Baron Burghersh (died 1305), and a nephew of Bartholomew de Badlesmere, 1st Baron Badlesmere. The marriage brought him large estates, including the manor of Ewelme, Oxfordshire. ==Career== He was Chief Butler of England for almost thirty years, first appointed by Richard II, and on 20 March 1399 received a pension of twenty marks a year in exchange for offices granted him by the Duke, paying at the same time five marks for the confirmation of two annuities of charges on the Duchy of Lancaster and also granted by the Duke. These annuities were confirmed to him by Henry IV, who appointed him constable of Wallingford Castle, and steward of the honours of Wallingford and St. Valery and of the Chiltern Hundreds. About the same time he succeeded Geoffrey Chaucer as forester of North Petherton Park, Somerset. On 5 November 1402, he received a grant of the chief butlership for life. Chaucer served as High Sheriff of Berkshire and Oxfordshire during 1400 and 1403 and as High Sheriff of Hampshire in 1413. He attended fifteen parliaments as knight of the shire for Oxfordshire (1400–1401, 1402, 1405–1406, 1407, 1409–1410, 1411, 1413, 1414, 1421, 1422, 1425–1426, 1427, 1429, 1430–1431) and was Speaker of the House five times, a feat not surpassed until the 18th century. He was chosen speaker in the parliament that met at Gloucester in 1407, and on 9 November reminded the king that the accounts of the expenditure of the last subsidy had not been rendered. The chancellor interrupted him, declaring that they were not ready, and that for the future the lords would not promise them. He was chosen again in 1410 and in 1411, when, on making his 'protestation' and claiming the usual permission of free speech, he was answered by the king that he might speak as other speakers had done, but that no novelties would be allowed. He asked for a day's grace, and then made an apology. He was again chosen in 1414. On 23 February 1411 the queen gave him the manor of Woodstock and other estates during her life, and on 15 March the king assigned them to him after her death. In 1414 he also received a commission, in which he is called domicellus, to treat about the marriage of Henry V, and to take the homage of the Duke of Burgundy. A year later he served with the king in France, bringing into the field 12 men-at-arms and 37 archers. He was not present at the Battle of Agincourt, being sent back to England ill after the siege of Harfluer. It is unknown if he was really sick, or used it as an excuse to return to England. His retinue did march on to Agincourt. In 1417, he was employed to treat for peace with France. On the accession of Henry VI he appears to have been superseded in the chief butlership, and to have regained it shortly afterwards. In January 1424, he was appointed a member of the council, and the next year was one of the commissioners to decide a dispute between the Earl Marshal and the Earl of Warwick about precedence. In 1430–1431, he was appointed one of the executors of the will of the Duchess of York, and was by then very wealthy. Thomas Chaucer died at Ewelme Palace in the village of Ewelme, Oxfordshire on 18 November 1434 and is buried in St Mary's church in the village. ==Family== Thomas' only daughter Alice married William de la Pole, 1st Duke of Suffolk and her grandson John de la Pole, Earl of Lincoln was the designated heir of Richard III. John was killed in battle and several of his brothers were later executed after Richard lost power. They left descendants however, including the Earls of Rutland and Portmore, William Parker, 4th Baron Monteagle, who foiled the Gunpowder Plot and Sir Francis Sacheverel Darwin (through his mother, Elizabeth Collier, natural daughter of the Earl of Portmore). ==References== ;Attribution ==External links== *CHAUCER, Thomas (c1367-1434) of Ewelme, Oxon *Ewelme – The rise of the Chaucer and de la Pole families *Royal Berkshire History: Thomas Chaucer (1367–1434) Category:1367 births Category:1434 deaths Category:People from Wallingford, Oxfordshire Category:High Sheriffs of Berkshire Category:High Sheriffs of Oxfordshire Category:High Sheriffs of Hampshire Category:Speakers of the House of Commons of England Category:Geoffrey Chaucer Category:English MPs 1401 Category:English Roman Catholics Category:Holders of the Honour of Wallingford Category:English MPs 1402 Category:English MPs 1406 Category:English MPs 1407 Category:English MPs 1410 Category:English MPs 1411 Category:English MPs February 1413 Category:English MPs April 1414 Category:English MPs December 1421 Category:English MPs 1422 Category:English MPs 1425 Category:English MPs 1427 Category:English MPs 1429 Category:English MPs 1431 ","title":"Thomas Chaucer"},{"id":"2546776","text":"Georgi Andreev Iliev () (July 22, 1966 – August 25, 2005) was a Bulgarian businessman, best known for his ownership of two Bulgarian football teams, Lokomotiv Plovdiv and Levski Kyustendil. == Biography == In his early years he won several wrestling competitions and a few gold medals, but had to stop his sports career because of a criminal conviction due to his involvement in a group rape.

Lin was born in 1960 to a Hakka family in Hsinchu, then a quiet college town south of Taipei, a research center where his father worked as a nuclear physicist. He began playing violin at the age of five. Recognizing that he needed to pursue his violin studies abroad, he made his way to Australia by himself when he was only 12 years old; he spent three years in Sydney. His commanding technique and precocious abilities then led him to Juilliard School, where he studied with the eminent Dorothy DeLay, teacher to several renowned soloists such as Itzhak Perlman, Gil Shaham, Midori Goto, et al. He made his public debut in New York City at the age of 19, playing Mozart's Violin Concerto No. 3 at Avery Fisher Hall. Since his début at Lincoln Center's Mostly Mozart Festival at the age of nineteen, he has appeared with virtually every major orchestra in the world, including the Boston Symphony Orchestra, Cleveland Orchestra, Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra, London Symphony Orchestra, Philadelphia Orchestra and New York Philharmonic.

Austin, an eminent engraver himself, had become Chaplin's tutor at the Royal College of Art in September 1947. Chaplin, a mature student, was a printer's commercial engraver; he was also an amateur artist whose prints had already received some recognition and had been hung at the Royal Academy summer exhibitions. He had, however, had little formal education or art training. Austin's encouragement was a major influence on Chaplin's subsequent career as an artist. The years before World War II cover Chaplin's birth into a large working-class family, his early love of drawing, the accident which left him with only one eye, and his apprenticeship in a large printing works. After the war, he enrolled as a Saturday student at the Royal College of Art and, thereafter, his style developed significantly.

As a young man, he joined a monastery, but left in 1962 in order to study the forces that shaped African history. He studied in Louvain (PhD, 1970), came back to Congo and flew to the United States in 1979 for political reasons.

His work has had a major impact on many disciplines including Philosophy, Sociology, Anthropology, Linguistics, Literature, and History. ==Work== He is generally considered to be the Edward Saïd of African studies, notably for his major book The Invention of Africa (1988), a work widely regarded to be as significant to the field of African studies as Saïd's Orientalism (1978) has been to postcolonial studies . A considerable body of work has been devoted to Mudimbe's publications. Mudimbe focuses most closely on phenomenology, structuralism, mythical narratives, and the practice and use of language.

An appetizing store, typically in reference to Jewish cuisine, is best understood as a store that sells \\"the foods one eats with bagels.\\" \\"Appetizing\\" is used as a noun by itself to refer to these type of foods. Appetizing includes both dairy and \\"parve\\" (neither dairy nor meat) food items such as lox (smoked salmon), whitefish, and cream cheese spreads. The foods are typically eaten for breakfast or lunch and, based on Jewish kashrut dietary laws, include no meat products (kosher fish products are not considered meat). The simplest distinction is that an appetizing store is a place that sells fish and dairy products, whereas a delicatessen sells meats (but not any dairy products, if it is a kosher deli). The term is used typically among American Jews, especially those in the New York City area, where \\"appetizing shops\\" sell cooked fish and dairy products in some neighborhoods with large Jewish populations. Pareve and dairy restaurants in Toronto also have \\"appetizers\\" as part of their name that are both kosher and kosher style. ==Name== Also, it can be called 'appy table', 'appetizing table', or just 'appy', the last short for 'an appetizing store' or 'appetizing' in the way deli is short for delicatessen (the meat or the store). ==See also== * Jewish cuisine * Bagel and cream cheese * Delicatessen * Kosher * Kosher restaurant * Salumeria * Cuisine of New York City ==References== ==External links== * Appetizing published on 19 January 2010 in Vanishing New York * Article Gentile's Guide to Jewish Food Part I: The Appetizing Store by Milton Glaser and Jerome Snyder in New York Magazine of 22 July 1968 on page 36.

Popol Vuh began as an electronic music project, but under Fricke's leadership they soon abandoned synthesizers for organic instrumentation and world music influences. They developed a productive working partnership with director Werner Herzog, contributing scores to films such as Aguirre, The Wrath of God (1972), Nosferatu the Vampyre (1979), and Fitzcarraldo (1982). The group are associated with West Germany's 1970s krautrock movement and are considered progenitors of ambient music. Today, Popol Vuh's best-reviewed works are In den Gärten Pharaos (1971) and Hosianna Mantra (1972). ==History== The first album, Affenstunde, released in 1970, can be regarded as one of the earliest space music works, featuring the then new sounds of the Moog synthesizer together with ethnic percussion. This continued for only one more album, In den Gärten Pharaos, and material later to be released on the soundtrack to Aguirre, the Wrath of God, before Fricke largely abandoned electronic instruments in favour of piano-led compositions from 1972's Hosianna Mantra forward. This album also marked the start of exploring overtly religious themes rather than a more generally spiritual feeling within the music. The group evolved to include a range of instruments: wind and strings, electric and acoustic alike, combined to convey a mystical aura that made their music spiritual and introspective. Popol Vuh influenced many other European bands with their uniquely soft but elaborate instrumentation, which took inspiration from the music of Tibet, Africa, and pre-Columbian America. With music sometimes described as \\"ethereal\\", they created soundscapes through psychedelic walls of sound, and are regarded as precursors of contemporary world music, as well as of new age and ambient. The band contributed soundtracks to the films of Werner Herzog, including the aforementioned Aguirre, the Wrath of God, as well as Nosferatu, Fitzcarraldo, Cobra Verde, Heart of Glass and The Enigma of Kaspar Hauser, in which Fricke appeared. Florian Fricke died in Munich on 29 December 2001 and the group disbanded. In October 2003 Klaus Schulze wrote: :\\"Florian was and remains an important forerunner of contemporary ethnic and religious music. He chose electronic music and his big Moog to free himself from the restraints of traditional music, but soon discovered that he didn't get a lot out of it and opted for the acoustic path instead. Here, he went on to create a new world, which Werner Herzog loves so much, transforming the thought patterns of electronic music into the language of acoustic ethno music.\\"Klaus Schulze, Oldau, October 7, 2003: Booklet to CD re-issue of \\"Hosianna Mantra\\", SPV recordings, 2004 ==Discography== *Affenstunde (1970) *In den Gärten Pharaos (1971) *Hosianna Mantra (1972) *Seligpreisung (1973) *Einsjäger und Siebenjäger (1974) *Das Hohelied Salomos (1975) *Aguirre (1975) *Letzte Tage – Letzte Nächte (1976) *Herz aus Glas (1977) *Brüder des Schattens – Söhne des Lichts (1978) *Nosferatu (1978) *Die Nacht der Seele (1979) *Sei still, wisse ICH BIN (1981) *Agape – Agape (1983) *Spirit of Peace (1985) *Cobra Verde (1987) *For You and Me (1991) *Sing, for Song Drives Away the Wolves (1993) *City Raga (1995) *Shepherd's Symphony – Hirtensymphonie (1997) *Messa di Orfeo (1999) ===Florian Fricke solo albums=== *Die Erde und ich sind Eins (1983) – limited private pressing *Florian Fricke Plays Mozart (1992) – featuring Fricke on piano playing Mozart compositions ===Compilations=== Note: there are two distinct issues of the compilation Best of Popol Vuh – Werner Herzog.

In April 2009, Stirton started a discussion forum named BBLounge (short for broadband lounge) to complement the site. Hellkom and BBLounge communities represent South African telecommunication consumers who want to see South Africa benefit from full liberalisation of the telecommunications sector in South Africa by educating the public and the media.

Currently, 1.7 million South Africans have Internet access, from a population of 44 million people. 0.2% of the population have ADSL broadband access. (Source: INTUG) South African ADSL broadband usage is currently being hampered by the 3 GB monthly traffic limit (equivalent to less than a day of moderately sustained usage, after which access is cut off for the rest of the month), by the cost of the service, and by the heavy port prioritization and bandwidth throttling/traffic shaping of international traffic at exchanges. The reason, speculates the Communications Users Association of South Africa (CUASA), is that incumbent Telkom makes more from leased line solutions than it ever will from providing ADSL. Technical professionals seeking acceptable telecommunications infrastructure to support their work often find emigration an attractive option; in this way Telkom is at least partly responsible for the continuing exodus of much-needed skilled workers. \\"The whole country is being hamstrung by Telkom and restrictive legislation.

It existed from 1680 to 1826 but its name and borders are currently used by the District of Hildburghausen. Hildburghausen Castle ==History== After the Duke of Saxe-Gotha, Ernest the Pious, died on 26 March 1675 in Gotha, the Principality was divided on 24 February 1680 among his seven surviving sons. The lands of Saxe-Hildburghausen went to the sixth son, who became Ernest II, the first Duke of Saxe- Hildburghausen. But the new Principality did not have complete independence. It had to depend on the higher authorities in Gotha for the matters of administration of its districts – the so-called “Nexus Gothanus” – because Gotha was the residence of Ernest II's oldest brother, who ruled as Frederick I, Duke of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg. Saxe-Hildburghausen did not become fully sovereign until 1702. In the beginning, the Principality had the District and city of Hildburghausen, the District and city of Heldburg, the District and city of Eisfeld, the District of Veilsdorf and the half of the District of Schalkau. Two more districts were added – Königsberg in 1683 and Sonnefeld in 1705. When Albert V, the Duke of Saxe-Coburg, died in 1699 without any surviving descendants, disputes arose over the inheritance but, eventually, in 1714, Saxe-Hildburghausen agreed to exchange the District of Schalkau for parts of Saxony – a piece of the former Duchy of Saxe-Römhild, the District of Behrungen, including the winery, and the monastery estate of Milz as well as the former properties of the Echter family of Mespelbrunn. In 1684 the city of Hildburghausen became the residence of the Duke so it was developed to reflect its new status. However, the elaborate buildings and courtyards of the princes strained the finances of the Principality so much that, in 1769, a forced management of debts by an Imperial Debit Commission had to be ordered. It was placed under the direction of the Regent, Charlotte Amalie of Saxe-Meiningen. With the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, Saxe-Hildburghausen gained its full sovereignty as the Duchy of Saxe-Hildburghausen. A few months later, on 15 December 1806, it, along with the other Ernestine duchies, entered the Confederation of the Rhine. In 1815, it joined the German Confederation. In 1818, it was one of the first German states to receive a constitution. At the City Hall of Hildburghausen, two coats of arms are presented – for the Duchy of Saxe-Hilburghausen on the left and the City of Hildburghausen on the right. The City's shield is quartered with the striped lion of Thuringia and the black lion of the Margraviate of Meissen. The top row of the Duchy's shield is Thüringia, Duchy of Saxe-Lauenburg (golden eagle on blue field), Meissen. The second row has the Counties of Weimar-Orlamünde (black lion with hearts) and Pleißen (white lion with golden head), flanking the heart-shield of Saxony. The third row represents the Electorate of Saxe- Wittenberg (three red hearts), Margraviate of Landsberg (gold and blue stripes) and the Palatinate County of Saxony (golden eagle on black field). The fourth row is lined with the Regalia shield (“the blood flag” of royalty), the Burgraviate of Altenburg (red rose) and the 'Herrschaft of Eisenberg (silver and blue stripes). The last row is divided between the Herrschaft of Wildberg (white tower on red field) and Grafschaft of Henneberg (black hen). The extinction of the oldest line, Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg in 1825 again led to inheritance disputes among the other lines of the Ernestine family. On 12 November 1826 the decision, from the arbitration of the supreme head of the family, King Frederick Augustus I of Saxony, resulted in the extensive rearrangement of the Ernestine duchies. Saxe-Hildburghausen lost the Districts of Königsberg and Sonnefeld to the new Duchy of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha and the rest of its territories to the Duchy of Saxe-Meiningen. But the last Duke of Saxe-Hildburghausen, Frederick, became the new Duke of Saxe-Altenburg. In 1868, four districts were established in the Duchy of Saxe-Meiningen. One of them was Hildburghausen, with boundaries very similar to those of the former duchy. It remained almost unchanged until 1993, when the District of Suhl was dissolved and most of its municipalities joined the District of Hildburghausen. ==Dukes of Saxe-Hildburghausen== * 1680–1715 Ernest II * 1715–1724 Ernest Frederick I * 1724–1745 Ernest Frederick II, from 1724 to 1728 under the Regency of his mother, Countess Sophia Albertine of Erbach- Erbach * 1745–1780 Ernest Frederick III Carl, from 1745 to 1748 under the Regency of his mother, Countess Caroline of Erbach-Fürstenau * 1780–1826 Frederick, since 1826 Duke of Saxe-Altenburg; from 1780 to 1787 under the Regency of his great granduncle Prince Joseph Frederick ==Notable residents== * Sophie Henriette of Waldeck (1662–1702), Duchess of Saxe-Hildburghausen * Eugene of Saxe-Hildburghausen (1730–1795), Prince of Saxe-Hildburghausen * Louis Frederick of Saxe-Hildburghausen (1710–1759), Prince of Saxe- Hildburghausen * Prince Joseph Frederick (1702–1787), Prince of Saxe- Hildburghausen * Christiane Sophie Charlotte of Brandenburg-Bayreuth (1733–1757), Duchess of Saxe-Hildburghausen * Ernestine Auguste Sophie of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach (1740–1786), Duchess of Saxe-Hildburghausen * Charlotte Georgine Luise of Mecklenburg-Strelitz (1769–1818), Duchess of Saxe- Hildburghausen * Charlotte of Saxe-Hildburghausen (1787–1847), by marriage Princess of Württemberg, known as “Princess Paul of Württemberg” since then * Therese of Saxe-Hildburghausen (1792–1854), by marriage Queen of Bavaria (who gave her name to a park in Munich, Theresienwiese and inspired, with her marriage, the Oktoberfest) * Louise of Saxe-Hildburghausen (1794–1825), by marriage the Duchess of Nassau ==Bibliography== * Johann Werner Krauß, Kirchen–, Schul– und Landeshistorie von Hildburghausen [Church, School and State History of Hildburghausen] (Greiz, 1780) ==External links== * Sachsen- Hildburghausen in: Meyers Konversations-Lexikon, 4.

Established in 1699, the Saxe-Coburg-Saalfield line lasted until the reshuffle of the Ernestine territories that occurred following the extinction of the Saxe-Gotha line in 1825, Harold Sandner, Das Haus von Sachsen-Coburg und Gotha 1826 bis 2001 [The House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha 1826 to 2001], with a preface from Andreas, the Prince of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha (Coburg: Neue Presse GmbH, 2004). , page 32 in which the Saxe- Coburg-Saalfeld line received Gotha, but lost Saalfeld to Saxe-Meiningen. ==Saxe-Saalfeld 1680 to 1735== Schloss Saalfeld, built after 1677 as the ducal residence After the Duke of Saxe-Gotha, Ernest the Pious, died on 26 March 1675 in Gotha, the Principality was divided on 24 February 1680 among his seven surviving sons. The lands of Saxe-Saalfeld went to the youngest of them, who became John Ernest IV (1658–1729), the Duke of Saxe-Saalfeld. But the new Principality did not have complete independence. It had to depend on the higher authorities in Gotha for the matters of administration of its three districts, Saalfeld, Grafenthal and Probstzella – the so-called “Nexus Gothanus” – because that was the residence of John Ernest's oldest brother, who ruled as Frederick I, Duke of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg. Saalfeld was the residence of the Dukes of Saxe-Saalfeld from 1680 to 1735. When Albert V, the Duke of Saxe-Coburg, died in 1699 without any surviving descendants, disputes arose over the inheritance, especially with Bernhard I of Saxe-Meiningen, and they were not settled until 1735. Most of the Saxe-Coburg properties were given to the new Ernestine line of Saxe-Saalfeld and the Principality of Saxe- Coburg-Saalfeld was born with John Ernest as its Duke (not Prince). However, the Districts of Sonneberg and Neuhaus am Rennweg had to be handed over to Saxe-Meiningen and the District of Sonnefeld had to be given to Saxe- Hildburghausen. One-third of the District of Römhild and five-twelfths of the District of Themar remained with Saxe-Coburg. ==Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld 1735 to 1826== After the death of John Ernest IV in 1729, his sons Christian Ernest II and Francis Josias ruled the country, consisting of two distinct and separate areas, together, but at different residences. Christian Ernst remained in Saalfeld, while Franz Josias chose Coburg as his residence. In 1745, when Christian Ernest II died childless, his domains were inherited by his brother, Duke Francis Josias. In 1747 Francis Josias was able to anchor his birthright (primogeniture) in the Line of Succession laws and confer it on his rapidly growing family for the long-term survival of the House of Saxe-Coburg- Saalfeld. His youngest son Prince Frederick Josias made himself and the Duchy famous with his sieges and victories as an Imperial general and field marshal in the Austro-Turkish War and the War of the First Coalition against France. His brother and Regent Duke Ernest Frederick was known more for the perilous finances of his Duchy, which underwent from 1773 onwards a forced management of debts by an Imperial Debit Commission until 1802 and affected the fortunes of his successors. The Duchy of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld (orange) in 1820 Duke Francis Frederick Anton, who ruled for only six years (from 1800 to 1806), was forced in 1805, especially by his minister Theodor Konrad von Kretschmann, for the renewal of the ailing Duchy to make a contract between the two duchies, Coburg and Saalfeld, for a uniform state system with a state administration of the Principality, which regained its full independence in 1806 with the fall of the Holy Roman Empire. It was the children of Duke Francis Frederick Anton who assured the dynastic success and survival of the House of Saxe-Coburg. The fame of Prince Frederick Josias led to the wedding of his daughter, Princess Juliane (later Grand Duchess Anna Feodorovna), with Grand Duke Constantine Pavlovich of Russia. Another daughter, Princess Marie Luise Victoire, married Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn, in 1818, and became the mother of Queen Victoria. The youngest surviving son, Prince Leopold, was elected in 1831 as Leopold I, King of the Belgians. In 1816, his elder brother, Prince Ferdinand, married Maria Antonia Koháry de Csábrág, who came from one of the wealthiest aristocratic families in Hungary, and founded the Catholic line of Saxe-Coburg-Koháry. Their namesake son, Prince Ferdinand, became in 1837 Dom Fernando II, King of Portugal and the other son, Prince August, was the father of Ferdinand I, who became the Sovereign Prince of Bulgaria in 1887 and the Tsar in 1908. In addition, the heir to the throne of Saxe-Coburg was Prince Ernst, who became Duke Ernest III in 1806. He was the father of Prince Albert, who married his cousin, Queen Victoria, in 1840 and became The Prince Consort of Great Britain and Ireland. On 15 December 1806, Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, along with the other Ernestine duchies, entered the Confederation of the Rhine. From November 1806 until the Peace of Tilsit in July 1807, the Principality was occupied by the French. Only then Duke Ernst I was able to return from his exile in Königsberg in East Prussia. A border treaty with the Kingdom of Bavaria in 1811 led to a territorial swap of the disputed territories. The towns of Fürth am Berg, Hof an der Steinach, Niederfüllbach and Triebsdorf came to Saxe-Coburg; Gleußen, the Schleifenhan mill, Buch am Forst and Herreth went to Bavaria. In 1815, as the reward for fighting in 1813 on the Allied side against Napoleon, the Congress of Vienna sent an area left of the Rhine River, later called the Principality of Lichtenberg, a territorial gain as well as membership in the German Confederation for the sovereign. On 8 August 1821, the Duchy received a constitution. The extinction of the oldest line, Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg in 1825 again led to inheritance disputes among the other lines of the Ernestine family. On 12 November 1826 the decision, from the arbitration of the supreme head of the family, King Frederick Augustus I of Saxony, resulted in the extensive rearrangement of the Ernestine duchies.

But Saxe- Coburg gained from Saxe-Hildburghausen the two Districts – Königsberg and Sonnefeld. The new duchy of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha was born as a personal union of the two duchies of Saxe-Coburg and Saxe-Gotha.

Charlie plays an ex-convict who finds life on the outside not to his liking and leads him to breaking into a home with another thief (Wesley Ruggles). Edna Purviance plays the girl living in the home who tries to change him. ==Synopsis== Charlie is released from prison and is immediately swindled by a fake parson. The parson advises Charlie to go straight, but the phony man of the cloth pockets the money Charlie has been given upon being discharged. Broke, Charlie encounters a fellow ex-convict. He convinces Charlie to help him burglarize a house. When they have trouble breaking into the house they have chosen, Charlie simply opens the front door. Edna lives in the house that is being robbed and has called the police. However, Edna is so taken with Charlie's manners that by the time the police arrive to investigate the crime, she lies to them, stating that Charlie is her husband. The police believe her. She gives Charlie a dollar and sends him happily on his way. However, Charlie soon encounters another policeman who recognizes him.

They will be disillusioned. They will see a touch of heart interest just at the end of the subject, and they will see that Charlie's stock pantomime includes pathos as well as fooling.

Written by Shawn Slovo, it is based on the lives of Slovo's parents, Ruth First and Joe Slovo. The film was a co-production between companies from the UK and Zimbabwe, where it was filmed. It features Hans Zimmer's first non-collaborative film score. ==Plot== Set in Johannesburg in 1963, the film examines the abrupt ending of 13-year-old Molly's blithe childhood when her father, a member of the South African Communist Party, flees into exile. Ostracised by her peers, Molly draws closer to her mother who is part of the campaign against apartheid. Their relationship is challenged by hardship, political intimidation, and the mother's eventual arrest. The film title references both the gap between the mother and her teenage girl, who fails to grasp why their family is so fixated with events beyond their comfortable white suburb, and another separating this world from that of South Africa's poverty-stricken black townships. Essentially, the film is a tribute to Ruth First by her daughter and concludes in a moment of epiphany as Molly comes to terms with her mother's activism and understands that she too must play a part in the struggle against racial injustice. ==Cast== *Jodhi May – Molly Roth *Jeroen Krabbé – Gus Roth *Barbara Hershey – Diana Roth *Linda Mvusi – Elsie *Nadine Chalmers – Yvonne Abelson *Kate Fitzpatrick – June Abelson *Tim Roth – Harold *Carolyn Clayton-Cragg – Myriam Roth *Yvonne Bryceland – Bertha *Merav Gruer – Jude Roth *Paul Freeman – Kruger *Rosalie Crutchley – Mrs. Harris *Adrian Dunbar – Le Roux *David Suchet – Muller *Jude Akuwudike – Priest *Nomaziko Zondo – Thandile ==Reception== A World Apart has an overall approval rating of 89% on Rotten Tomatoes from 9 critics.

Based on the lamb shawarma brought by Lebanese immigrants to Mexico,David Sterling, \\"The Lebanese Connection,\\" Yucatan: A Culinary Expedition. http://www.los-dos.com/culinary- expedition/verarticulo.php?IdArticulo=258 al pastor features a flavor palate that combines traditional Middle Eastern spices with those indigenous to central Mexico. It is a popular street food that has spread to the United States. In some places of northern Mexico, as in Baja California, it is known as taco de adobada. A similar dish from Puebla with different spices is tacos árabes. ==History== During the 19th century, variations of a vertically- grilled meat dish, now known by several names, started to spread throughout the Ottoman Empire. A wave of Lebanese immigrants to Mexico, mainly Christians such as the Maronites who have no religious dietary restrictions on eating pork, arrived in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and introduced the Arab version, shawarma. In the 1960s, Mexican-born progeny of these immigrants began opening their own restaurants and combining their heritage with Mexican cuisine. Being derived from shawarma, it is also similar to the Turkish döner kebab and the Greek gyros. ==Preparation== Pork is marinated in a combination of dried chilies, spices, pineapple, and typically achiote paste, then slowly cooked with charcoal or gas flame on a vertical rotisserie called a trompo (lit: spinning top). Guajillo chile, garlic, cumin, clove, bay leaf, and vinegar are common ingredients, with cinnamon, dried Mexican oregano, coriander, and black peppercorns found in many variants. A slice of fresh onion and a pineapple are characteristically placed on top the rotisserie. Meat is thinly sliced off the spit with a large knife into a small corn tortilla and served with finely chopped onions, cilantro, and diced pineapple. A wedge of lemon or lime and a salsa are optional condiments. This meat is also a common ingredient in gringas, alambres, huaraches, tortas, and pizza. ==Varieties== Plate of tacos al pastor In some places of northern Mexico, such as Nuevo León, Durango and Chihuahua, these are usually called tacos de trompo if served on corn tortillas, and gringas if they are served with cheese on flour tortillas. A similar dish is called tacos árabes, which originated in Puebla in the 1930s from Arab Mexicans cuisine. Tacos árabes use shawarma- style meat carved from a spit, but are served in a pita-style bread called pan árabe. These tacos have been brought by Mexican immigrants to the United States in the past few years and have become popular in cities such as Chicago and Los Angeles, two of the largest Mexican/Mexican-American population centers in the United States.David Hammond, \\"Perfection on a Spit,\\" Chicago Reader, November 8, 2007.http://www.chicagoreader.com/features/stories/restaurants/071108/ A chicken version marinated in the \\"al pastor\\" style was brought back to the Middle East in the early 2000s, and sold as \\"shawarma mexici\\". It is typically served in the Middle Eastern style, wrapped with garlic mayonnaise, dill pickle, and french fries in a thin flatbread. ==See also== * Dürüm * List of Mexican dishes * List of spit-roasted foods * Sandwich * Street food ==References== Category:Mexican cuisine Category:Meat Category:Sandwiches Category:Spit-cooked foods Category:Pork ","title":"Al pastor"},{"id":"2546917","text":"Caleb Atwater (December 1778 – March 13, 1867) was an American politician, historian, and early archaeologist in the state of Ohio. He served several terms as a state politician and was appointed as United States postmaster of Circleville, Ohio. He was known best during the 19th century for his publication History of the State of Ohio (1838), the first book-length history of the new state. It also included much natural lore. Atwater was recognized by contemporaries as a pioneer of the study of the mounds or massive earthworks in the Ohio Valley; he published an account during 1820. These are now known to have been constructed by ancient Native Americans of the United States. At the time, Atwater and other scholars developed various theories of origin; he thought a culture other than ancestors of Native Americans created such monuments. He helped publicize a theory by John D. Clifford, an amateur of Lexington, Kentucky, who suggested that people related to Hindus of India had migrated by sea and built the mounds, to be replaced by ancestors of contemporary Native Americans. ==Early years== Caleb Atwater was born in North Adams, Massachusetts during 1778 during the American Revolutionary War. He was the son of a carpenter and his wife, and educated at local schools. He graduated from Williams College. After failing as a schoolmaster in New York City, he studied theology and became a Presbyterian minister. His first wife Diana Lawrence died after the birth of their first child. Dissatisfied with the ministry, the widower Atwater studied law, studying and working with a judge in Marcellus, New York. He was admitted to the state bar. Instead of practicing, he entered into business and soon became bankrupt. As a result of this failure, during 1815 he moved with his new wife (Belinda Butler) to Circleville in Ohio, founded during 1810. They had nine children together. ==Career== Atwater practiced law for six years, and gained an assured income when appointed as United States postmaster of the town. He was elected to the state legislature during 1821. Circleville was developed at a site of circular earthworks built by the ancient Hopewell culture. Initially, it was planned with streets of concentric circles to fit into the remains of the monument. The county courthouse was erected in the center circle. During the late 1830s, people decided they wanted an ordinary town with a grid pattern, and the remnants of the circular works were destroyed. Elected to the state’s house of representatives during 1821, Atwater endorsed internal improvements, including legislation that authorized the Ohio and Erie Canal. It was intended to improve the waterways for connection to the Erie Canal in New York State and thereby to the major market of New York City. Atwater promoted tax-funded public schools, equal education for boys and girls, and better teachers’ pay. After several terms, he was not re-elected during 1828. An enthusiastic Jacksonian Democrat, Atwater was appointed by President Andrew Jackson during 1829 as one of three federal commissioners to negotiate the Third Treaty of Prairie du Chien with the Winnebago Indians in Wisconsin. His journey to the western frontier stimulated his interest in Native American issues and history, and he began to study them. Atwater wrote and published books after this period. His journey to Wisconsin and meeting with Native Americans stimulated him to write about his experiences in the west: Remarks Made on a Tour to Prairie du Chien (1831), which includes an interview with the noted Sauk leader Quashquame. A decade later he wrote An Essay on Education (1841), which contained his most mature thoughts on the subject. During the nineteenth century, Atwater was known best for his publication History of the State of Ohio (1838), the first book-length history of the new state.Salmon P. Chase during 1833 included a 40-page history of Ohio in his compendium Both Atwater's Tour to Prairie du Chien and his History contained much natural history lore as well as civil history. He also contributed articles on this topic to the American Journal of Science. ==Archaeological career== Atwater is known as one of the first researchers to undertake a serious study of the prehistoric Adena and Hopewell culture earthworks, and their associated artisan artifacts found throughout the Ohio Valley. He was fascinated by the ancient circular works found in Circleville, and studied others in the area. The Hopewell culture is now known to have flourished from BCE200 to CE500. During 1820 Atwater published Description of the Antiquities Discovered in the State of Ohio and Other Western States, a 160-page report in the first volume of the Transactions of the American Antiquarian Society. This account, considered the first scientific treatment of the monuments, is illustrated with woodcuts of artifacts and with engraved maps of prehistoric sites. Included is one of Circleville (Plate v), where some earthworks had been plowed under, but the city's plan had been made to conform to Hopewell circles. This circular plan was later changed during the late 1830s, and all traces of the Hopewell works were destroyed. Although the maps were stylized and likely not too accurate, they preserve all that is known today of some other prehistoric sites since destroyed by development. Atwater’s acquaintances contributed some of the maps and their descriptions in this book. Additionally, Atwater speculated about who had built the elaborate, complex earthworks and what had happened to them. Contemporary Indians in the area did not have direct knowledge of the mounds’ origins. Americans tended to consider the Indian societies as primitive and did not believe the builders of the mounds could have been part of the same culture. Atwater had learned that John D. Clifford, a Lexington, Kentucky merchant, and his naturalist friend C.S. Rafinesque, a polymath and professor at Transylvania University, were also working on these topics. Clifford found documentation in the university library and town archives from which he built a theory about builders of the earthworks. Rafinesque identified, measured and mapped many of these sites in the Ohio Valley and developed his own theories; his manuscripts contained identification of 148 sites in Kentucky, all of which were later featured in E. G. Squier and Davis in their 1848 work on the monuments. Clifford published \\"Indian Antiquities,” eight long letters in Lexington’s short-lived Western Review and Miscellaneous Magazine (1819-1820), with material from Rafinesque.John D. Clifford, Constantine Samuel Rafinesque, John D. Clifford's Indian Antiquities, edited and annotated by Charles E. Boewe, Univ. of Tennessee Press, 2000 He proposed a theory, circulated more widely by Atwater, that the mounds were the work of ancient people related to the Hindus of India, who had reached North America by sea. He proposed that they had built the mounds and an elaborate culture but were driven south into Mexico by the more warlike Indians who followed them (and who became known to Europeans). He died soon after publishing this material. Rafinesque had contributed to Clifford's letters, adding that the warring Indians were ancestors to such contemporary tribes as the Lenape. He theorized that the later Indian ancestors had crossed to North America over the frozen Bering Strait from Asia. During 1819 Atwater published a memoir of his archaeological career to date in the journal Archaeologia Americana. ==Controversy== When a tepid and anonymous review of Atwater's 1820 work in the American Antiquarian Society’s Transactions appeared in the magazine Western Review, Atwater guessed correctly that Rafinesque was its author. He was angered by what he thought was unjustified criticism, and the two exchanged statements. Atwater’s adaptation of the Clifford thesis was promulgated in Europe when Vicomte François René de Chateaubriand appended a translation of Atwater’s report to his Voyage en Amérique et en Italie (1828). ==See also== * Atwater Township, Ohio ==References== == Sources == *Boewe, Charles. 1987. “The Fall from Grace of that ‘Base Wretch’ Rafinesque,” Kentucky Review 7: 39-53. *Boewe, Charles (Ed.). 2000.

Through the help of a mysterious character named Carapace Clavicle Moundshroud, they pursue their friend across time and space through Ancient Egyptian, Ancient Greek, and Ancient Roman cultures, Celtic Druidism, the Notre Dame Cathedral in Medieval Paris, and The Day of the Dead in Mexico. Along the way, they learn the origins of the holiday that they celebrate, and the role that the fear of death, ghosts, and the haunts has played in shaping civilization. The Halloween Tree itself, with its many branches laden with jack-o'-lanterns, serves as a metaphor for the historical confluence of these traditions. ==Background== The novel originated in 1967 as the screenplay for an unproduced collaboration with animator Chuck Jones. Bradbury later wrote and narrated Hanna-Barbera's 1993 feature-length animated version of the novel for television, for which he won an Emmy Award. A longer 2005 limited-edition \\"author's preferred text\\" of the novel was compiled and edited by Donn Albright. This edition also included both the 1967 and 1992 screenplays. Bradbury dedicated The Halloween Tree to Man'ha Garreau-Dombasle (1898–1999), a French writer and translator who was the maternal grandmother of the actress and singer Arielle Dombasle and the wife of Maurice Garreau- Dombasle, a French ambassador to Mexico. ==Illustrations== The Halloween Tree is illustrated by Joe Mugnaini, one of Bradbury's many collaborators over the years. Mugnaini illustrated many novels with Bradbury, and Bradbury owned many examples of Mugnaini's artwork. ==Adaptations== *Bradbury wrote the script based upon the book.

WJMK broadcasts with a power of 5000 watts daytime, 1100 watts at night, directed towards the north. ==History== ===As WKNX AM 1210=== WJMK's history can be traced back as early as April 17, 1947, when the station first signed on the air as AM 1210 WKNX, owned by Lake Huron Broadcasting. The station was like many of its day, programming a full-service format of music, news, and talk. For many years, it was also a leading Top 40 hit music station in Saginaw, competing with WSAM (1400 AM) and Flint's WTAC (600 AM, now WSNL). Among the station's history was the acquisition of a sister television station in the 1950s, and was also the radio home of 1950s country music artist \\"Little\\" Jimmy Dickens. WKNX's resident \\"legend\\" would take form of University of Cincinnati graduate Robert Dyer, who joined the station in 1950 and remained a part of its staff for more than half a century. In 1977, Lake Huron Broadcasting acquired an FM station in the Tampa Bay region of Florida -- WQYK-FM, a station that also carried a country format. ===Move to Frankenmuth=== The following year, in 1978, WKNX underwent a major change when it was purchased by Radiocom Limited, a company headed by Robert Dana McVay. WKNX's city of license was immediately changed to Frankenmuth, and the station's studios and offices were moved to 306 West Genesee Avenue in Frankenmuth, where it was later joined by a Tuscola-licensed sister FM station, WGMZ-FM (now WWBN), which programmed beautiful music. (The WGMZ calls and format moved from 107.9 FM, which became WCRZ \\"Cars 108\\" in 1984.) By the early 1990s, WKNX-AM was programming big band music and adult standards. Radiocom owned WKNX and leased out WGMZ (which would later become country- formatted WKMF and move its operations to Flint) until 1994, when WKNX was purchased by Detroit-based Bell Broadcasting Company in a frequency swap involving another AM station in Bay City (1250 WXOX) which had been silent since the early 1990s. ===Sale to Bell Broadcasting and frequency swap=== Bell Broadcasting owned WCHB, an AM station licensed to Taylor, which operated at a daytime signal of 25,000 watts and a nighttime signal of 1,000 watts. WCHB was a talk station targeted to an African-American audience. The company's intent was to acquire WKNX's dial position at 1210 and silence it in order to provide WCHB with a 50,000 watt daytime signal. WKNX would then acquire the license of WXOX, which had first signed on in 1956 as a station first licensed to Essexville. Over time, the 1,000 watt station, operating at 1250 kHz, began broadcasting from Bay City with its co-owned Pinconning-licensed FM sister at 100.9. By the end of the 1980s, both stations had separated ownership, ran into financial trouble and fell silent. 100.9 was spun off to a new owner in 1991, but WXOX remained silent. Bell would then have WKNX assume WXOX's 1250 AM dial position and its abandoned three-tower directional transmitter site in Bridgeport. In January 1997, WKNX signed on at AM 1250, and AM 1210 was placed at WXOX and assigned the new call letters WJZZ, though it did not sign back on from Frankenmuth or the surrounding area. (The former WXOX calls have since been recycled for a Cleveland low-powered TV station, now WLFM-LP.) The FCC then granted WJZZ a request to change its city of license to Kingsley, a village near Traverse City, located on the other side of Michigan. The move allowed WJZZ to increase its power from 10,000 to 50,000 watts, as it was no longer in the path of WCHB. WJZZ was later sold and later became WLDR (now WJNL). ===Sale to Frankenmuth Broadcasting=== WKNX continued its format of middle-of-the-road music under the moniker \\"Memories 1250\\". Six months after the frequency change, WKNX was sold by Bell Broadcasting to Frankenmuth Broadcasting, a company owned by WKNX announcer John Blehm and his wife Kathy, who were committed to keeping the radio station in Frankenmuth. Four years later, the music became more rock-and-roll oldies-based and also added religious-based talk programming during the daytime hours. WKNX was granted permission to broadcast at night two years later with a power output of 129 watts, directional. Concurrent with the application, WKNX moved its studio and office operations from Frankenmuth to its transmitter facility at 2850 Gabel Road in Bridgeport Township. In January 2004, Frankenmuth Broadcasting applied for a power increase from 1,000 to 5,000 watts. Two months later, Frankenmuth Broadcasting entered into an agreement to sell WKNX to the Meredith Corporation for $1.1 million. ===WNEM-AM=== In the Summer of 2004, the parent company of WNEM-TV, Meredith Corporation, purchased WKNX. Soon after the purchase, the call sign was changed to \\"WNEM\\" and shifted its studios to the television studio building in downtown Saginaw at 107 N. Franklin Street. Unlike its TV counterpart, however, the AM station does not serve Flint or areas south of Saginaw County, due to the directional antenna array beamed towards the north. The station was also simulcasted via the Internet on WNEM's website, except for sports coverage. In a coincidental situation, WNEM-TV rival WEYI-TV was founded as WKNX-TV, a sister station to WKNX radio; it was sold off in 1972. This also once again gave WNEM-TV a radio sister, which they lost in 1969 when Gerity Broadcasting, which owned WNEM-FM 102.5 (now WIOG), sold WNEM-TV to Meredith. The FCC granted WNEM permission in January 2006 to operate at the new power levels with the addition of a fourth tower in its directional antenna pattern. At one point programmed as an all-news station, WNEM's primary programming later consisted of simulcasts of channel 5's newscasts, syndicated talk shows (including Michael Patrick Shiels in the Morning, The Neal Boortz Show, and The Dave Ramsey Show), and syndicated regional sports and additional programming. WNEM picked up Detroit Red Wings ice hockey coverage in late 2005, making it mid-Michigan's only source of NHL hockey. Following the station's sale and format change, coverage of Red Wings games moved to WSGW 790 AM. The station was not profitable as it had a poor signal in which it would drop from a day time high of about 5,000 to 1,000 watts at night. Meredith looked for a buyer to no avail, thus look to donate the station. By May 1, 2013, with Meredith giving up ownership, the station went dark. ===WHHQ=== On May 30, 2013, Meredith had donated WNEM radio, equipment, tower and land to Ave Maria Communications, which currently brokers all its Catholic-related programming on WMAX AM 1440 in Bay City. The station changed is call sign to WHHQ on June 18, 2013. The two stations were to be complementary programmed. WHHQ simulcasted WMAX's programming, despite its considerable overlap of the parent station's coverage area. Ave Maria Radio later moved the studios to A-M Church Supply at 3535 Bay Road in Saginaw Township. ===WJMK=== On April 4, 2018, WHHQ/1250 had been sold for $175,000 to Northern States Broadcasting Corporation. The station changed call letters to WJMK (last used by 104.3 FM in Chicago) on April 3, 2018, and picked up the MeTV FM easy oldies format originating on WRME-LP 87.7 FM Chicago run by Weigel Broadcasting. ==References== ==External links== *WNEM History JMK (AM) Category:Radio stations established in 1956 Category:1956 establishments in Michigan Category:Oldies radio stations in the United States ","title":"WJMK (AM)"},{"id":"2546983","text":"A flèche is a type of church spire.

It was named after Trpimir I, the first member and founder. The most prominent rulers of the Trpimirović Dynasty include Tomislav (first king of Croatia), Petar Krešimir IV and Demetrius Zvonimir. The house gave four dukes, thirteen kings and a queen. Since its mid-9th century foundation, the house reached independent rule at some later point and dissolved at the end of 11th century. During that time, the state had slight territorial changes, most notably in Bosnia and southern Dalmatia, where the wars against Venetians and others were waged. == Dukes and Kings of Croatia == The Trpimirović dynasty was a ruling dynasty of Croatia from the 9th to the 11th century. The ruling estate () of the Trpimirović dynasty was located in the area between Trogir and Split (today Kaštela, Solin area and Klis from where they ruled), and Split and Omiš and later in other parts of the land. After the death of Duke Trpimir I, the power was temporarily assumed by Domagoj, a member of the Domagojević dynasty (most likely). In 878, Trpimir I's son Zdeslav overthrew Domagoj, and then around 892, Zdeslav's brother Muncimir became duke. The rulers of the dynasty initially ruled as vassals of the Franks. They fought with the Venetian Republic and Byzantine Empire for control of the coast, and at the end of the 9th century achieved greater autonomy. In the first half of the 10th century, the first King of Croatia, Tomislav united Pannonia (Pannonian Croatia) and Dalmatian Croatia and created the Kingdom of Croatia. According to scarce and disputed historical sources, Croatia was a powerful state under his rule. King Tomislav maintained an alliance with the pope and successfully defended Croatia from the invading Hungarians, while at the local level he participated at the Church Councils of Split in 925 and 928. The struggle with the Byzantines and the Venetians over Dalmatian coastal cities continued after his death. Tomislav's successors failed to maintain a stable kingship and the country was affected by a dynastic crisis in the middle of the 10th century. Even Pribina, the Croatian ban (viceroy), got involved in the dispute between brothers Miroslav and Michael Krešimir II. Pribina took the side of Michael Krešimir which resulted in the murder of King Miroslav in 949. Political and social recovery of Croatia occurred during the reign of King Stephen Držislav. Split chronicler Thomas the Archdeacon (1200–1268) wrote that Stephen Držislav had received royal honours and that since then, Croatian rulers were verifiably referred to as the \\"Kings of Dalmatia and Croatia\\". After the death of King Stephen Držislav in 997, he was succeeded by three sons: Svetoslav Suronja, Krešimir III and Gojslav. The two younger brothers rebelled against Svetoslav Suronja, which started a new dynastic conflict that ended with the dethroning of Svetoslav. On thus the rulership was jointly taken over by Krešimir III and Gojslav. From Svetoslav and his offspring the Svetoslavić branch was created. The descendants of Krešimir III were part of the Krešimirović branch that continued to rule Croatia. The dynasty reached its peak during the reign of King Petar Krešimir IV, who consolidated and expanded the kingdom. The dynasty ended in 1091 with the death of Petar Krešimir IV's nephew Stephen II, the successor to King Demetrius Zvonimir who did not leave a male heir. == Rulers == === Dukes of Croatia === * Trpimir I (845–864) * Zdeslav (878–879) * Muncimir (892–910) * Tomislav (910–925) === Kings of Croatia === * Tomislav (925–928) * Trpimir II (928–935) * Krešimir I (935–945) * Miroslav (945–949) * Michael Krešimir II (949–969) * Stephen Držislav (969–997) * Svetoslav Suronja (997–1000) * Krešimir III (1000–c. 1030) * Gojslav (1000–c. 1020) * Stephen I (c. 1030–1058) * Peter Krešimir IV (1058–1074) * Demetrius Zvonimir (1075–1089) * Stephen II (1089–1091) == See also == * List of rulers of Croatia * History of Croatia * House of Domagojević * House of Kotromanić * Trpimirović Royal Family Tree == References == * Hrvatski leksikon (1997, A-Ž, 2 volume, in Croatian == External links == * The Earliest Croatian Dukes and Kings Category:Medieval Croatian nobility Category:Kings of Croatia Category:Croatian royal families Category:History of Dalmatia ","title":"Trpimirović dynasty"},{"id":"2547041","text":"Aerostar S.A. is an aeronautical manufacturing company based in Bacău, Romania. ==History== Aerostar Festival Since its establishment in 1953, the company's name has changed numerous times in turn from U.R.A. to I.R.Av, I.Av. and finally Aerostar. It has been a subsidiary of the Ministry of Armed Forces, Air Defence Headquarters, General Industrial Direction of the Army, the Ministry of Machine Building Industry as part of the Central Department for Fine Mechanics and Aeronautical Industry, of Bucharest Aeronautical Group or of the National Centre of the Romanian Aeronautical industry. Iak-52TW trainer aircraft Aerostar has been a major provider of maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) services for all aircraft types used by the Romanian military. The company also developed the IAR-93 twin-engine, tactical ground- attack and reconnaissance aircraft, which was the first fighter aircraft produced in Romania following the end of the Second World War. Furthermore, the company has also produced more than 1,800 Yak-52 trainer aircraft; it was manufactured in Romania in three versions: the Iak-52, Iak-52W, and Iak-52TW. Aerostar developed its own range of light civil aircraft for aerobatics and sport aviation, such as the Festival light-sport aircraft. During the 1990s and 2000s, upgrade programs for the both MiG-21 (MiG-21 LanceR) and MiG-29 were developed by Aerostar in cooperation with the Israeli defense electronics specialist Elbit Systems. Aerostar has implemented these upgrades to produce the Romanian Air Force's MiG-21 LanceR fleet from its existing inventory of MiG-21 and MiG-21 bis fighters. The firm has also supplied similarly-upgraded MiG-21s to international operators, such as the Mozambique Air Force. However, the MiG-29 SNIPER upgrade never progressed being a technological demonstrator as the service opted to concentrate its limited resources upon the MiG-21 instead. Around the same time, a modernisation program was also carried out on the Iak-52W and Iak-52TW trainers. The firm was also involved in the LAROM modernization program, which upgraded the 40 APRA 122 FMC multiple rocket launchers belonging to the Romanian Army. During the 1990s and 2000s, the company became engaged in numerous international projects, regularly in partnership with various other aerospace companies, including Elbit Systems, Thales Group (Thomson-CSF), EADS (DaimlerChrysler Aerospace) and Textron Marine & Land Systems. On separate occasions, Aerostar's management has stated that such partnerships are a deliberate element of the company's long term strategy. One major sector of work for the firm has been the aerostructures sector. Throughout the 2010s, Aerostar has continued to restructure its operations in pursuit of international customers, intending to achieve a decreased level of reliance upon domestic consumers such as the Romanian military. Starting in the 1990s, the Romanian government launched efforts to privatise many of its state-owned assets, including Aerostar. According to aerospace periodical Flight International, various international companies, including the German aerospace conglomerate DASA, reportedly took an interest in acquiring the company. In February 2000, it was announced that the Romanian government's 69.99 percent stake in the firm would be acquired by a private consortium of Aerostar management and employees (PAS) and IAROM; the nation maintained a golden share to potentially veto decisions that would seriously impact the firm's defense capabilities. That same year, Aerostar was restructured as a limited liability company, reportedly for tax purposes as well as to increase its appeal to potential investors, which were actively sought to fund the firm's expansion plans. In the mid-2000s, Aerostar was contracted to produce Southern Condor powered parachute airframes for the American company Southern Powered Parachutes, which were sold to consumers in the North American market.Bertrand, Noel; Rene Coulon; et al: World Directory of Leisure Aviation 2003-04. Pagefast Ltd, Lancaster UK, 2003. page 81. ISSN 1368-485X. During the late 2000s, the company started manufacturing a new line of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with Israeli assistance; multiple deals were arranged with foreign militaries for Aerostar-built UAVs. In 2011, the firm received work from an agreement between Elbit and the Romanian Air Force to upgrade the latter's fleet of Lockheed Martin C-130 Hercules cargo planes. In recent decades, Aerostar has sought to provide its MRO services to various commercial and international operators; since 2003, the servicing and heavy maintenance of civilian Boeing 737s has been one such undertaking. In 2012, to provide increased capacity for this work, a new hangar was completed at the company's Bacau facility. During May 2015, Russian low-cost airline Utair arranged for its 737 fleet to be serviced by the firm; by this point, upwards of 50 737s per year were receiving C-checks alone at Aerostar's facilities. Similarly, the company has also provided MRO services for operators of the Airbus A320 family. ==See also== * Aviation in Romania ==References== ==External links== * Aerostar programmes Category:Aircraft manufacturers of Romania Category:Manufacturing companies established in 1953 Category:Romanian brands Category:Companies listed on the Bucharest Stock Exchange Category:1953 establishments in Romania ","title":"Aerostar"},{"id":"2547043","text":"Al-Huda Institute is a Salafist organization which runs chain of religious schools with campuses in Islamabad and Karachi, Pakistan as well as in Missisauga, Ontario, Canada. ==Ideology== Al-Huda's founder, Farhat Hashimi, has stated that they do not follow any particular sect of contemporary Islam and refer to themselves simply as Muslims as was done during the time of early Islam .

As of 2015 it offers two main fields of study. There were about 160 female students in kindergarten to Grade 6 attending daily classes. On evenings and weekends the school offers seminars for teenagers and adults. ==Students linked to terror groups== Tashfeen Malik, the Pakistani co-perpetrator of a shooting attack in San Bernardino on December 2, 2015, was a student of al-Huda before marrying and moving to California. There she and her husband executed the worst Islamic terror attack in the U.S. since the September 11 attacks in 2001, killing 14, and seriously injuring, 22 people. Four Canadian female students ranging from 16 to early 20s, attended seminars at the Mississauga branch between about 2013–2015. They then traveled to the Middle East to join ISIL in Syria. The oldest woman attended the school for three months in 2012, and according to an interview her sister gave CBC News, she has been living in Syria since summer of 2014. In July 2014 the three younger girls were intercepted by security personal in Turkey and sent back to Canada before they reached ISIL territory. ==Notable alumni== * Tashfeen Malik – Islamic terrorist who was one of the perpetrators of the 2015 San Bernardino attack in which 14 people were murdered ==References== Category:Islamic universities and colleges in Canada Category:Religious schools in Pakistan Category:Terrorism in Pakistan Category:Salafism in Pakistan ","title":"Al-Huda International"},{"id":"2547060","text":"Wassily Hoeffding (June 12, 1914 – February 28, 1991) was a Finnish statistician and probabilist.

(JSTOR) == Personal life == Hoeffding was born in Mustamäki, Finland, (Gorkovskoye, Russia since 1940), although his place of birth is registered as St. Petersburg on his birth certificate. His father was an economist and a disciple of Peter Struve, the Russian social scientist and public figure. His paternal grandparents were Danish and his father's uncle was the Danish philosopher Harald Høffding. His mother, née Wedensky, had studied medicine. Both grandfathers had been engineers. In 1918 the family left Tsarskoye Selo for Ukraine and, after traveling through scenes of civil war, finally left Russia for Denmark in 1920, where Wassily entered school. In 1924 the family settled in Berlin. Hoeffding obtained his PhD in 1940 at the University of Berlin. He migrated with his mother to the United States in 1946. His younger brother, Oleg, became a military historian in the United States. Hoeffding's ashes were buried in a small cemetery on land owned by George E. Nicholson, Jr.'s family in Chatham County, NC about 11 miles south of Chapel Hill, NC. == Work == In 1948, he introduced the concept of U-statistics.

The band recorded an LP for Columbia Records in 1980 and began to tour, but their momentum was curtailed when producer/performer Quincy Jones saw the name 'Quincy' on the marquee at the Whiskey A Go-Go in Los Angeles, CA. He sent the band a trademark infringement 'cease-and-desist' order and Quincy were no longer allowed to use the name and broke up soon afterward. Quincy did record one more EP for Columbia records but under the new name Lulu Temple. Stephen and Brian became unhappy with the direction that the band was taking and quit while the record was being recorded. The Lulu Temple EP was released in 1983. ==Smash Palace== The Butler brothers quickly formed a new band, Smash Palace, and signed with Epic Records in 1985. The new line-up included Brian Butler (lead vocals), Stephen Butler (lead guitar and vocals), Phil Rizzo (bass guitar), Harry Lewis (drums) and Greg Persun (rhythm guitar). The band's first self-titled LP was released in the fall of 1985 along with an MTV video of the first single, \\"Living on the Borderline\\" (directed by Nigel Dick). Smash Palace then toured extensively throughout the United States and Canada with Mr. Mister and the Cruzados. Greg DiDonato (keyboards) joined the lineup for the tour. When Smash Palace's A&R; man, Dick Wingate, left Epic Records in 1985 he asked the band to come on over to his new label, Polygram Records. Unfortunately, once the band left Epic, the offer from Polygram melted away. The band recorded demos for tracks that were intended for their second album, including \\"Cold Wind\\", \\"Girl with the Stars in Her Eyes\\", \\"Stranger Than Strange\\" and \\"I'll Be There\\" (which was later reworked and recorded on the band's Over the Top CD release in 2004) and these tracks were played on Philadelphia radio station WMMR-FM's local music program Street Beat, but never officially released. ==Inactive years== Disillusioned and broke, Stephen and Brian took staff songwriter jobs at CBS Songs, EMI, and then with BMG. Greg DiDonato remained active with Brian and Steve in the studio providing keys, drums, and later, engineering services. Not finding much happiness or success in the hit song writing business, the brothers left the music business altogether for a while. Stephen was the first to return in 1997, working as a co-writer and guitarist with the band Mary Lee's Corvette. This has been a lasting relationship that Stephen has maintained for the past 10 years and he has produced the most recent Mary Lee's Corvette album Love, Loss and Lunacy which was released in 2006. ==Fast, Long, Loud== In 1999, the Butler brothers reunited to record a new Smash Palace CD, Fast, Long, Loud, the follow-up recording to their 1985 LP with a 14-year gap in between. The new album was recorded by just the brothers themselves at Stephen's house using recording equipment he had just recently purchased. Once the tracks were completed, Smash Palace signed with the indie label Imagine Records. The first single \\"Another Man\\" was a top 100 rock radio track for the summer of 1999. Smash Palace then re-formed to play out live with a new line-up which included Stephen Butler (lead vocals and lead guitar), Brian Butler (drums and vocals), DyAnne DiSalvo (rhythm guitar and vocals), Phil Rizzo (bass guitar) and Greg DiDonato (keyboards). ==Unlocked, Over the Top, and more== In 2001 the next Smash Palace album released was titled Unlocked, followed by 2004's Over the Top. The Best Of '99-06 came out in 2006 on Zip Records. Anthony Bezich took over drumming for the band in 2004 with the retirement from live performing by Brian Butler. Brian is still active in writing and recording aspects but spends his time these days pursuing other passions such as art and photography. Smash Palace have currently been touring the east coast of the United States and also the United Kingdom. Their album Everybody Comes and Goes was released in January 2008. Since 2012, Smash Palace has a new line up. Stephen Butler, lead vocals and lead guitar, Cliff Hillis, rhythm guitar and vocals, David Uosikkinen, drums, Wally Smith, keyboards and Fran Smith Jr on bass and vocals. In 2010, Smash Palace released 7, a full length CD. In 2012, the band released Do It Again and with the current line up, recorded Live at the Auction House in 2013, Extended Play in 2014, Some Kind of Magic in 2016 and the most recent release was Right As Rain released in 2018. All of the CD's were released on Zip Records owned by Arthur Herman. Brian Butler writes, records and co produces the CD's along with brother Steve Butler and on occasion, appears live with the band. ==Band members== ===Original 1985 line-up=== *Brian Butler - lead vocals *Stephen Butler - lead guitar & vocals *Don Merlino - guitar & vocals *Greg Persun - guitar *Phil Rizzo - bass *Harry Lewis - drums *Greg DiDonato - keyboards (Joined band in Feb. 1986) ===1999 line-up=== *Stephen Butler - lead vocals & lead guitar *Brian Butler - drums & vocals *DyAnne DiSalvo - rhythm guitar & vocals *Phil Rizzo - bass *Greg DiDonato - keyboards ===2004 line- up=== *Stephen Butler - lead vocals & lead guitar *Anthony Bezich - drums *DyAnne DiSalvo - rhythm guitar & vocals *Phil Rizzo - bass *Greg DiDonato - keyboards ===2012 line-up=== *Stephen Butler - lead vocals & guitar *Phil Rizzo - rhythm guitar *Fran Smith - bass *Greg Didonato - drums *Wally Smith - keyboards ===2014 line-up=== *Stephen Butler - lead vocals & guitar *Cliff Hillis - rhythm guitar *Fran Smith - bass *David Uosikkinen - drums *Wally Smith - keyboards ===Current line-up=== *Stephen Butler - lead vocals & guitar *Cliff Hillis - rhythm guitar *David Uosikkinen - drums *Wally Smith - keyboards *Greg Maragos - bass ==Discography== *Smash Palace (1985 - Epic Records) Note: This album was never released on CD, only on LP & cassette. *Fast, Long, Loud (1999 - Imagine Records) *Unlocked (2001 - Back Porch Records) *Over the Top (2004 - Smash Palace Studios) *The Best Of '99-06 (2006 - Zip Records) *Everybody Comes and Goes (2008 - Zip Records) *7 ( 2010 - Zip Records) *Do It Again (2012 - Zip Records) *Live at the Auction House ( 2012 Zip Records) *Extended Play (2014 Zip Records) *Some Kind of Magic (2015 - Zip Records) *Right as Rain (2018 - Zip Records) ==External links== * *Smash Palace at Zip Records website *1 of 4 originally released album covers for their 1st release.

It operated for two seasons. The creation of the league was announced in February 1926, with teams in Regina, Moose Jaw, Brandon, and Winnipeg. By the time the first season began, Brandon and Winnipeg had dropped out. Five WHL teams—the Calgary Tigers, Edmonton Eskimos, Saskatoon Sheiks, Regina Capitals, and the Moose Jaw Warriors—played in the league's first season. Leading the PHL was president E.W. Seaborn of Moose Jaw. In the first season, the Calgary Tigers were declared the league champions when the Saskatoon Sheiks refused to continue their playoff series after complaining about the officiating in the first game. The Tigers won the game 2-1. The Tigers played the Winnipeg Maroons of the American Hockey Association for the Merchants Casualty Cup, presented to the top professional team in the west. During the season, there had been rumours that games in the PHL had been fixed, but Seaborn believed the league had the confidence of the public by the end of the year. At a meeting in May 1927, Seaborn said that he expected all five teams to return for the next season, and that the league might expand into Brandon, Manitoba. But, as it turned out, Calgary and Edmonton dropped out after one year and no new team was admitted to the league.

Approximately by road from Port Angeles, the ridge is open to hiking, skiing, and snowboarding and is one of the two most visited sites in the national park (along with the Hoh Rain Forest Visitor Center). At an elevation of , Hurricane Ridge is a year-round destination. In summer, visitors come for views of the Olympic Mountains, as well as for hiking. During the winter months the small, family oriented Hurricane Ridge Ski and Snowboard Area offers lift-serviced downhill skiing and snowboarding. Panoramic view of the Olympic National Park. The Hurricane Ridge visitor center is on the right of the image. The road leading west from the Hurricane Ridge visitor center has a number of picnic areas and trail heads. A paved trail called the Hurricane hill trail is about long (one-way) with an elevation gain of about . It is not uncommon to find snow on the trails even as late as July. Several other dirt trails of varying distances and difficulty levels branch off of the Hurricane hill trail. The picnic areas are open only in the summer, and have restrooms, water and paved access to picnic tables. The Hurricane Ridge visitors center offers several conveniences, including an information desk, gift-shop, restrooms, and a snack bar. The exhibits in the visitor center are open year-round, but limited to Friday through Sunday during the winter months. Hurricane Ridge is named for its intense gales and winds. The weather in the Olympic Mountains is unpredictable, and visitors should be prepared for snow at any time of year. The area receives of snowfall annually. Obstruction Point Road ==History== The Hurricane Ridge Lodge and Hurricane Ridge Road were built in the 1950s as part of a plan by Fred Overly, Olympic National Park's second superintendent, to increase park visitation. The lodge was dedicated by Congressman Henry M. Jackson in September 1952. The lodge's role as a concession facility was replaced in the 1980s with more interpretative uses, focusing on Olympic National Park topics including as geology and wildlife. Skiing facilities established at Hurricane Ridge were intended to replace those at Deer Park in the 1950s, however in the following decades skiing in national parks was criticized. The Olympic National Park began restricting winter access to Hurricane Ridge in the late 1990s, which was followed by a decline in visitor numbers. Park officials restricted winter access to Friday through Sunday in 2005. In 2011 and 2012, the park agreed to return to its original winter schedule for a trial period after the local community raised $75,000 to bridge the estimated budget gap. Despite a 35% visitor increase, Olympic National Park officials declared the trial unsuccessful and returned to three-day-a- week access during the winter months. ==References== * ==External links== *Hurricane Ridge Ski and Snowboard Area *National Park Service: Visiting Hurricane Ridge *Hurricane Ridge info - outdoorplaces.com Category:Olympic Mountains Category:Landforms of Olympic National Park Category:Ridges of Washington (state) ","title":"Hurricane Ridge"},{"id":"2547135","text":"Sorry Ma, Forgot to Take Out the Trash is the first studio album by the American punk rock band The Replacements.

Since Nicomedes and Etazeta's children were still very young, the king sought to strengthen his family's hold on the Bithynian throne by offering the guardianship of the infants to the sovereigns Ptolemy II of Egypt and Antigonus II of Macedonia; also the city-states of Byzantium, Heraclea and Cius were added to the guardianship. On the death of Nicomedes I in around 255 BC, Etazeta ruled on behalf of her infant sons.

During his life he took part in a failed attempt to assassinate tsar Alexander III of Russia, served a lifetime sentence in Shlisselburg prison, was a professor at numerous universities, headed the Petersburg Institute of Geography and a chair in the Stefan Batory University of Wilno. == Life == Józef Łukaszewicz was born on 13 December 1863 in his family's manor of Bikiškė () near Vilnius (currently in the Elderate of Medininkai, at the border with Belarus). After graduating from the local gymnasium he joined the Mathematic Division of the University of St. Petersburg. There he became friends with Aleksandr Ulyanov and Petr Shevyrev, two young revolutionaries that were preparing an assassination attempt on the life of Alexander III of Russia. Łukaszewicz became one of the members of the Terrorist Faction of Narodnaya Volya and invited to the circle one of his friends, Bronisław Piłsudski, also a student at the local university. Ulyanov's brother, later to be known as Lenin, became the first leader of the Soviet Union, while Bronisław's brother Józef Piłsudski would later become the leader of Poland. ===Assassination plans=== As a skilled chemist, Łukaszewicz was chosen as the person to build three bombs that were to kill the tsar. To make it easier to hide the bomb, he concealed it in a copy of Grunberg's Medical Dictionary. The inside was filled with shrapnel and dynamite, while the fuse was made of a tube filled with mercury fulminate. Two additional bombs were prepared in case the main did not detonate as planned. To make the explosion more lethal, Łukaszewicz decided to fill all three bombs with capsules filled with strychnine. However, before the attempt was ready, on 1 March 1887 all the revolutionaries were arrested by the police. After a short trial on 8 May, Ulyanov and his comrades Pakhomiy Andreyushkin, Vasili Generalov, Vasili Osipanov and Petr Shevyrev were sentenced to death and hanged at Shlisselburg. Most of the Polish accomplices (including Lukaszewicz, but also the future marshal of Poland Józef Piłsudski and Tytus Paszkowski) were also sentenced to death, but their sentence was later exchanged to that of katorga, or forced resettlement to a prison camp. According to trial records, Łukasiewicz appealed for the tsar's mercy. ===Life in prison=== Łukaszewicz was sent to the Peter and Paul Fortress and then, on 17 May 1887, to the Shlisselburg Fortress. There he started working on his first geological maps and studies on mineralogy. According to his long-time friend Vera Figner, for his first sketches Łukaszewicz used the soot of his lamp and a blue paint from the walls of his cell. With time he became a member of an informal circle of natural scientists serving their sentences in the fortress and exchanging knowledge. Finally in early 20th century Łukaszewicz was allowed to receive books and newspapers from the outside, which allowed him to continue his studies. ===Life after the Revolution of 1905=== The Revolution of 1905 and the thaw that ensued resulted in Łukaszewicz's release from the prison and return home. In 1906 he was allowed to return to St. Petersburg and in 1907, at the age of 44, he graduated from the St. Petersburg University. By that time he already started writing his opus magnum, a 3-volume monograph on dynamic geology and geophysics. The work, published five years later, brought him limited fame and fortune and was awarded by the Russian Geographic Society and the Russian Academy of Sciences. In the following years he travelled to Italy, Egypt, Turkey and Greece. He also continued his work as a professor at various universities in the Russian Empire. During World War I, in 1916, Łukaszewicz became the dean of the Faculty of Geomorphology at the Higher Course of Geography, later to be transformed into the Petersburg Institute of Geography. Following the February Revolution he also joined the Petrograd Soviet and became one of its deputies. Because of that in 1918 he was elected the first rector of the newly created Geographic Institute. However, he was disappointed with the course of the Russian Revolution of 1917 and in 1919 he returned to Lithuania. Initially serving as a supervisor of colleges at the General Commissariat of the Eastern Lands (an agenda of the Ober-Ost), he settled in Vilna and on 1 January 1920 he became a deputy professor in the Chair of Geology of the Stefan Batory University. On 1 July that year he was promoted to the rank of professor and became the head of the Chair of Physical Geology, a post he held until his death. He died on 19 October 1928 and was buried in the Rasos Cemetery in Vilnius. The largest collection of his memorabilia is preserved in the Polish Secondary School of Medininkai. == Works == Łukaszewicz authored a large number of works on geology, most of them published in Russian language.

Loudon Road, known as Old Plank Road in the early 19th century, is lined with several historic Jeffersonian mansions. See also: Loudonville started as a hamlet on Loudon Road (originally a plank road), at the intersection of Crumitie Road. Ireland's Corners was a separate hamlet to the north at the intersection of Loudon Road and Menand/Osborne Road, with a post office. Ireland's Corners is named for Elias H. Ireland who in 1832 bought the heavily wooded area from the Patroon, Stephen Van Rensselaer. In 1871 the post office at Ireland's Corners was renamed Loudonville. ==Geography== The community is located directly north of Albany, New York and south of Newtonville. The hamlet is centered on the original Ireland's Corners, the intersection of U.S. Route 9 with Osborne Road (County Route 154)/Menand Road (NY Route 378) (west bound name/east bound names respectively), with the northwest corner bisected by Old Niskayuna Road (County Route 152).

He was an advocate of accelerated education for academically gifted children. He founded the Johns Hopkins University Center for Talented Youth (CTY), as well as a related research project, the Study of Mathematically Precocious Youth (SMPY), whose work has, since 1980, been supplemented by the Julian C. Stanley Study of Exceptional Talent (SET), which provides academic assistance to gifted children. Stanley was also widely known for his classic book, coauthored with Donald Campbell, on the design of educational and psychological research - Experimental and Quasi-experimental Designs for Research. ==Biography== Julian Cecil Stanley Jr. was born in Macon, Georgia, on July 9, 1918.Stanley, J. C. (2004). International Who’s Who (p. 1599). London: Europa Publications. After finishing high school he attended West Georgia Junior College (1936) - now the State University of West Georgia - and at age 19 years, after attending the Georgia Teacher's College (1937) - now the Georgia Southern University - he became a high school math and chemistry teacher. During the Second World War he served in the Army Air Corps' chemical warfare service (1942–1945). Upon his return, he entered Harvard University where he completed his doctorate in education (Ed.D) in 1950. ==Academic career== Stanley's first academic teaching position was as an associate professor in educational psychology at the George Peabody College for Teachers (1949) - now Peabody College of Vanderbilt University. In 1951 he became President of the Tennessee Psychological Association before moving onto the University of Wisconsin in 1953. It was here that he became famous for his work in experimental designs and psychometrics; his most cited work, Experimental and Quasi-experimental Designs for Research, was produced with co-author Donald T. Campbell (1963). In 1965, he moved to Stanford University, becoming a fellow of Stanford's Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences, and then onto the final chapter of his career, at Johns Hopkins University. It was here that he began his work with intellectually gifted youth, creating in 1971 the Study of Mathematically Precocious Youth (SMPY), which would eventually lead to a revolution in how gifted children were to be identified and treated within the education system. He retired as Professor Emeritus in the Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences (1992), although reportedly worked up until one week before his death in 2005 at age 87 years.Benbow, C. P. & Lubinski D. (2006) Julian C. Stanley Jr. (1918-2005). American Psychologist, 61(3), 251-252. retrieved from on June 9, 2010 ==Study of Mathematically Precocious Youth== When Stanley was a young math/science teacher he became fascinated with intellectual talent while taking a \\"tests and measurements\\" course at the University of Georgia.Benbow, C. P. & Stanley, J. C. (1983). Academic Precocity: Aspects of its Development. Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins University Press. But, it was in 1969 that Stanley's interest with intellectually gifted youth was reignited when he was introduced to Joseph Bates, a 13-year-old boy from Baltimore, Maryland. Joseph was outperforming all of his classmates in mathematics. Stanley decided to test him using the SAT and found that it was a much more effective and reliable way to test for both advanced math and verbal skills and reasoned that such a method could be used to identify more of these high ability students, especially if a systematic approach was taken. Seeing a need for more research and development in mathematical reasoning ability, Stanley submitted a proposal to the Spencer Foundation of Chicago, which also had an interest in intellectual talent, to help fund his study. On September 1, 1971, the Study of Mathematically Precocious Youth (SMPY) was formed at Johns Hopkins University.Kirschenbaum, R. J. (1992). An Interview with Julian C. Stanley. Gifted Child Today, 15, 34-37, doi:10.1177/107621759201500611 It began as a project designed to model the longitudinal study by Lewis M. Terman in the \\"Genetic Studies of Genius\\" series. The project primarily included holding talent searches with the intent of identifying gifted youth, particularly in the area of mathematics. The study then proceeded to examine both short- and long-term results of the students identified through this method. But, it didn't stop there. Stanley was also invested in helping them to further their education by devising and offering many different acceleration programs and classes. At the time, there was very little research to support acceleration, with educators often pushing gifted youths and their parents towards enrichment instead, as it seemed best to avoid attracting too much attention to the unusual abilities of these students and thereby make it easier for educators within the current system at the time to deal with their intellectual capabilities. It should also be noted that up until the time of Stanley's study, there was the prevalent idea that cultural assimilation, stemming from the melting pot ideology featured prominently within the United States’ immigration policies, was also a factor in educators veering away from providing acceleration opportunities for gifted students.Cohn, S. J., George, W. C. & Stanley, J. C. (1979). Educating the Gifted: Acceleration and Enrichment. Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins University Press. The very first talent search was held in March 1972; 450 Baltimore grade 7 and 8 students took the SAT-M (School Aptitude Test-Math), which had previously only been taken by students in grades 11 and 12. This out of level testing method proved to be so successful in identifying intellectual talent and furthering the education of youths in ways that were deemed not to detract from social and emotional development, that the program continued with great achievement. Eventually verbal capabilities were added to the searches (SAT-V) and the program expanded to other universities (Duke, Northwestern, Iowa, and Denver). The program was also deemed to have predictive validity, reasons for which this type of testing has now become a standardized method of identifying early intellectually precocious youth, both within the United States and internationally. To date, the program has identified and provided acceleration for millions of gifted youth. At Johns Hopkins University, the program is now called the Julian C. Stanley Study of Exceptional Talent (SET). The Study of Mathematically Precocious Youth (SMPY) continues at Vanderbilt University today, with former colleagues of Stanley working to complete a fifty-year longitudinal study of gifted individuals. Currently there are 5000 previous students involved who are now nearing mid-life. In 1994, Stanley was one of 52 signatories on \\"Mainstream Science on Intelligence,Gottfredson, L. (December 13, 1994). Mainstream Science on Intelligence. Wall Street Journal, p A18.\\" an editorial written by Linda Gottfredson and published in the Wall Street Journal, which declared the consensus of the signing scholars on intelligence research. == Other achievements == Julian Stanley wrote or edited 13 books, produced over 500 professional articles, received two honorary doctorates and numerous awards, including: *Fellow of the American Statistical Association (1967)View/Search Fellows of the ASA, accessed 2016-08-20. *APA's E.L.

The word evangelism is borrowed from the context of religious evangelism due to the similarity of sharing information about a particular concept with the intention of having others adopt that concept. This is typically accomplished by showcasing the potential uses and benefits of a technology to help others understand how they can use it for themselves. ==Target areas== Platform evangelism is one target of technology evangelism, in which the vendor of a two-sided platform attempts to accelerate the production of complementary goods by independent developers (e.g., Facebook encourages developers to create games or develop mobile apps that can enhance users' experiences with Facebook.). Professional technology evangelists are often employed by firms seeking to establish their technologies as de facto standards. Their work could also entail the training of personnel, including top managers so that they acquire skills and competencies necessary to adopt new technology or new technological initiative. There are even instances when technology evangelism becomes an aspect of a managerial position. Open-source evangelists, on the other hand, operate independently. Evangelists also participate in defining open standards. Non-professional technology evangelists may act out of altruism or self-interest (e.g., to gain the benefits of early adoption or network effect). ==History of term== In Christianity, the word evangelist comes from the Koine Greek word εὐαγγέλιον (transliterated as euangelion) via Latinised evangelium as used in the canonical titles of the Four Gospels, authored by (or attributed to) Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John (also known as the Four Evangelists). The concept that sharing particular established standards to help others to adopt them is similar in the technology-related field. The term \\"software evangelist\\" was coined by Mike Murray of Apple Computer's Macintosh computer division.Guy Kawasaki, The Macintosh Way, p2. It was part of Apple's drive to compete with IBM and it specifically described the initiative to win over third-party developers rhetorically to persuade them to develop software and applications for the Macintosh platform. In Guy Kawasaki's own words, it meant \\"using fervor and zeal (but never money) to convince software developers to create products for a computer with no installed base, 128K of RAM, no hard disk, no documentation, and no technical support, made by a flaky company that IBM was about to snuff out.\\"Guy Kawasaki, The Macintosh Way, loc 167. The first so-identified technology evangelist was Mike Boich — who promoted the Macintosh computer.Guy Kawasaki, The Macintosh Way, p100. The job is often closely related to both sales and training but requires specific technology marketing skills. For example, convincing a potential buyer or user to change from older methods to new ones. There is also the case of adopting new products such as green IT. The marketing aspect involved in technology evangelism was strongly influenced by Geoffrey Moore and his books concerning the technology adoption lifecycle. One of his positions maintain that the role of the evangelist becomes critical when addressing what he identified as the \\"chasm\\" that exists between early and mainstream adoption. Technology evangelism is sometimes associated with an internal employee assigned to encourage new practices within an organization. Methods of evangelism available include a modified STREET process (Scope, Track, Rank, Evaluate, Evangelize, Transfer) and the process that takes advantage of the hype cycle. Evangelism can also assume the form of a learning process and employ tools such as the Learning Management Systems (LMS). == The role of technology evangelists == Technology evangelists usually take a leadership role in organizations. They are the respective leader ensuring the success of others. Their action needs to be taken in a legitimate manner. The purpose of objective that technology evangelists attached to usually generate positive effects to help people feel better or impressed. To promote the technology product or idea, technology evangelists usually requires a commitment to the management of the corporation. Different fields of skills can be used by technology evangelists, includes but not limited to technology, marketing, psychology. A specialized understanding of technology is required, being a generalist will reduce evangelist's credibility. Steve Jobs sharing his technology on Apple event == Six major characteristics of technology evangelists == From study by Frederic Lucas-Conwell, a technology evangelist usually includes typical characteristics: # Be able to build a connection with others to achieve objectives. # Be able to persuade other people during clear communication. # Willing to work with others. # Having an outgoing communication style to attract others during conversations # Interested in forging a team # Focused on their goals instead of a detailed plan ==Notable technology evangelists== Notable technology evangelists in the commercial arena include Steve Jobs (Apple Inc.), Vint Cerf (Internet), Don Box, Guy Kawasaki, Alex St. John, Robert Scoble, Myriam Joire (Pebble), Mudasser Zaheer (Hewlett Packard Enterprise) and Dan Martin (MasterCard). Court recordsPlaintiff's Exhibit 3096, Comes vs. Microsoft, 2007.Plaintiff's Exhibit 2456, Comes vs. Microsoft, 2007. indicate that James Plamondon was a leading theorist, strategist, and practitioner of technology evangelism at Microsoft during its establishment of Microsoft Windows as the de facto standard PC operating system. Kawasaki with Macintosh product Kawasaki, on the other hand, was credited for the remarkable growth of the software developed for the Macintosh, jumping from a few dozen products to more than 600 in less than a year of spreading the so-called Macintosh gospel.

A recorded version appeared on their 1972 album Foxtrot, and the band performed the song regularly on stage for several years following this. Live versions appear on the albums Live at the Rainbow recorded in 1973, Seconds Out recorded in 1977, the compilation Genesis Archive 1967–75, and the box set Genesis Live 1973–2007. A reworked version also appears on Steve Hackett's 2012 album Genesis Revisited II and its accompanying live albums Genesis Revisited: Live at Hammersmith and Genesis Revisited: Live at Royal Albert Hall. In an interview, Peter Gabriel summed up \\"Supper's Ready\\" as \\"a personal journey which ends up walking through scenes from Revelation in the Bible... I'll leave it at that\\". He was also quoted in the book I Know What I Like by Armando Gallo as saying that the song was influenced by an experience his wife had of sleeping in a purple room, and the nightmares it gave her.Peter Gabriel in radio interview on the programme \\"Rockline\\", 92.3FM KROCK, NYC, 16 June 1986. AllMusic has described the song as the band's \\"undisputed masterpiece\\". == Structure == : See below for further details on each section of the song. Nearly 23 minutes in length, the song is divided into seven sections. A number of musical and lyrical themes do re-appear throughout. The melody of the verse in section I reappears as a flute melody between sections II and III. The melody of the chorus in section I reappears with new lyrics in the coda to section VI. The song that comprises the majority of section II reappears briefly in instrumental form at the beginning of section VI, and then returns to form the body of section VII, with new lyrics. One commentator regarded the structure of \\"Supper's Ready\\" as a variation of sonata form—a musicological analysis by Nors Josephson proposes that \\"section VII may be viewed as a Lisztian, symphonic apotheosis\\" of the \\"cyclical fanfares that originated in section II\\".Nors S. Josephson, \\"Bach Meets Liszt: Traditional Formal Structures and Performance Practices in Progressive Rock\\", The Musical Quarterly, vol. 76, no. 1 (Spring 1992), pages 84–85. On the other hand, the individual components of \\"Supper's Ready\\" are much closer to traditional rock songs than they are to classical pieces, even if they contain elements of both. The song undergoes multiple changes in time signature, key signature, Leitmotif, instrumentation, and mood. == Authorship == The song's writing is credited to the whole band (Banks/Collins/Gabriel/Hackett/Rutherford). In various interviews, Banks mentioned that he composed several of the musical progressions whilst still a university student; Gabriel authored most or all of the lyrical content, as well as the \\"Willow Farm\\" section; Collins apparently contributed much to the arrangements and segues from one section to another. In Olivier Lecart's book Genesis, Mike Rutherford hints that he was responsible for the rhythm of \\"Apocalypse in 9/8\\". == Sections == === I: \\"Lover's Leap\\" (0:00 – 3:47) === This section features a gentle arpeggiated guitar backing (with Hackett, Banks and Rutherford all playing 12-string guitars), soft electric piano (Hohner pianet), bass pedals, cello and flute, and a section with folky three part vocal harmonies sung by Gabriel and Collins (which omit the third note of the chord). The only percussion used and played by Collins is triangle, cymbals, and bells. Lyrically it tells of a man returning home after a long time to be greeted by his lover, and mentions supernatural imagery (\\"six saintly shrouded men\\"), which Gabriel claims relate to a genuine spiritual experience which occurred with himself, his wife Jill and producer John Anthony. According to Gabriel, during a late-night conversation, his wife began speaking with a completely different voice. Gabriel held up a makeshift cross out of a candlestick and another household item, and Jill reacted violently; (in Armando Gallo's book, I Know What I Like, Gabriel mentions that his wife had reacted badly to sleeping in a room with purple walls, purple being 'very high in the colour spectrum'). Jill was eventually calmed down and taken to bed, but neither Peter nor John Anthony slept that night. On another occasion, also late at night, Gabriel looked out of the window of his wife's parents' house to see what he perceived to be an entirely different lawn, across which seven shrouded men were walking. Gabriel recounted that these experiences led him to contemplate notions of good, evil, and the supernatural, and eventually inspired the lyrics to \\"Supper's Ready\\". Hackett, however, has a different explanation: \\"I believe there’d been some drug taking going on. I believe she [Jill] was having a bad trip at one point, and that Pete and a friend managed to talk her around and get her out of the horrors or whatever it was. So that’s a part of what the song was about, but in a way there’s a kind of redemption implication that goes with that.\\" In the programme given out at Genesis concerts at the time, \\"Lover's Leap\\" was explained as: \\"In which two lovers are lost in each other's eyes, and found again transformed in the bodies of another male and female.\\" This segment was performed as part of an acoustic medley on the group's 1998 Calling All Stations tour with Ray Wilson on vocals. === II: \\"The Guaranteed Eternal Sanctuary Man\\" (3:48 – 5:43) === Banks composed the chord progression whilst still at University. When performing the song live, Gabriel would don a \\"crown of thorns\\" headpiece at this point. The piece segues into the next with a \\"Lover's Leap\\" reprise. The programme describes this section as follows: \\"The lovers come across a town dominated by two characters; one a benevolent farmer and the other the head of a highly disciplined scientific religion. The latter likes to be known as 'The Guaranteed Eternal Sanctuary Man' and claims to contain a secret new ingredient capable of fighting fire. This is a falsehood, an untruth, a whopper, and a taradiddle, or to put it in clearer terms; a lie.\\" === III: \\"Ikhnaton and Itsacon and Their Band of Merry Men\\" (5:44 – 9:42) === This section is much more dynamic than the previous two, with lively drumming from Collins, an elegiac electric guitar solo played by Hackett, and a lot of interplay between Hackett’s guitar and Banks’ organ (including a section with fast organ and guitar arpeggios, Hackett employing the \\"tapping\\" style of playing). The lyrics refer to a battle of some sort, presumably involving Ikhnaton. The programme spells \\"Itsacon\\" as \\"Its-a-con\\". It describes this section as follows: \\"Who the lovers see clad in greys and purples, awaiting to be summoned out of the ground. At the G.E.S.M's command, they put forth from the bowels of the earth, to attack all those without an up-to-date 'Eternal Life Licence', which were obtainable at the head office of the G.E.S.M.'s religion.\\" === IV: \\"How Dare I Be So Beautiful?\\" (9:43 – 11:04) === This is a slow and gentle section, the only instrumentation being treated acoustic piano chords, each chord being faded-in on the recording, thus losing the piano's characteristic attack and sounding more like an organ (it was done on Hammond organ live). The title is a catchphrase used by the band's early music- business contact, Jonathan King. The lyrics deal with the aftermath of the preceding battle, and referring to the Greek myth of Narcissus, who turned into a flower. The programme describes this section as follows: \\"In which our intrepid heroes investigate the aftermath of the battle and discover a solitary figure, obsessed by his own image. They witness an unusual transmutation, and are pulled into their own reflections in the water.\\" === V: \\"Willow Farm\\" (11:05 – 15:36) === Live in concert, Gabriel would appear in his \\"flower mask\\" (by Gabriel's own admission, partly inspired by the BBC children's programme The Flower Pot Men). This section features vaudeville- style sections, the Mellotron Mark II's \\"combined brass\\" tape set, sped-up vocals, and musique concrète noises of trains and explosions. Lyrically, it has a Python-esque quality, dealing with elements of the absurd in the English psyche, \\"there's Winston Churchill, dressed in drag, he used to be a British flag, plastic bag, what a drag!\\" and numerous elements of word play, boarding schools, agricultural depravity and social conformity. The lyrics also reference Foxtrot's cover artwork (\\"the fox on the rocks\\") and a song from Nursery Cryme, Genesis' previous album (\\"The Musical Box\\"). The programme describes \\"Willow Farm\\" as follows: \\"Climbing out of the pool, they are once again in a different existence. They're right in the middle of a myriad of bright colours, filled with all manner of objects, plants, animals and humans. Life flows freely and everything is mindlessly busy. At random, a whistle blows and every single thing is instantly changed into another.\\" \\"Willow Farm\\" was originally a stand-alone song, with music and lyrics by Gabriel. At one point, while \\"Supper's Ready\\" was being written and assembled, Banks or Gabriel had the idea of including \\"Willow Farm\\" in the middle of it. Banks commented that this jarring, fast-paced piece prevented \\"Supper's Ready\\" from seeming too much like a repeat of their earlier epic \\"Stagnation\\". After the vocal section of \\"Willow Farm\\" ends, there is a reflective interlude, not definitely belonging to either \\"Willow Farm\\" or the following \\"Apocalypse In 9/8\\". It starts with bass pedal, electric guitar, organ and Mellotron drones, then proceeds with soft guitar and flute. === VI: \\"Apocalypse in 9/8 (Co- Starring the Delicious Talents of Gabble Ratchet)\\" (15:36 – 20:50) === At this point, the drums enter, with the rhythm section striking out a pattern using the unusual metre of 9 beats to the bar (expressed as 3+2+4).Seconds Out Songbook 1978 Wise Publications The lyrics employ stereotypical apocalyptic imagery, alternating with an organ solo from Banks (played in and time signatures against the rhythm section), then switching to a climactic vocal from Gabriel, and the Mellotron \\"three violins\\" tape set. Banks has said that his approach to writing the solo was to parody the style that Keith Emerson had developed with Emerson, Lake & Palmer. In live performances, during the organ solo, Gabriel would don a bizarre \\"Magog\\" outfit with geometrical headdress which can be seen on the cover of the band's Genesis Live (1973) album. \\"Gabble Ratchet\\" is a reference to the Hounds of Hell;Brewer, Dictionary of Phrase & Fable, 1898 they are usually portrayed as geese, which explains the sound effect heard during this section (18:48–18:53 on Foxtrot). They are also known as \\"Gabriel's Hounds\\". The programme for the 1972/3 tour refers to this section as \\"co-starring the delicious talents of wild geese\\".Genesis Programmes – Gabriel Years The programme describes this section as follows: \\"At one whistle the lovers become seeds in the soil, where they recognise other seeds to be people from the world in which they had originated. While they wait for Spring, they are returned to their old world to see Apocalypse of St John in full progress. The seven trumpeters cause a sensation, the fox keeps throwing sixes, and Pythagoras (a Greek extra) is deliriously happy as he manages to put exactly the right amount of milk and honey on his corn flakes.\\" This segment was performed as a standalone once in 1978 and on the first leg of the 1986 Invisible Touch Tour as part of the \\"In the Cage\\"/\\"...In That Quiet Earth\\"/\\"Supper's Ready\\" medley. === VII: \\"As Sure As Eggs Is Eggs (Aching Men's Feet)\\" (20:51 – 22:54) === \\"As Sure As Eggs Is Eggs\\" is a folklore variation of the logical tautology that \\"X = X\\"Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase & Fable and in this context is a reference to certainty and faith—being absolutely convinced of the ultimate victory of good over evil and that God and Heaven do indeed exist. \\"Aching Men's Feet\\" is a play on \\"making ends meet\\". \\"Apocalypse\\" segues into this part via a slower section that reprises the lyrics from \\"Lover's Leap\\" in combination with the chord progression from \\"The Guaranteed Eternal Sanctuary Man\\", backed by a pressed snare drum roll and tubular bells. During live shows, a flash charge would be fired and Gabriel would discard his Magog costume to reveal himself in shining white apparel that glowed when exposed to black light. During one gig, he attempted flying on a Kirby wire, and was nearly strangled. From this point to the end, drums, deep bass pedals and Mellotron brass are present, as are Blakean lyrics which reference The New Jerusalem (The Crystal City of God that is established after the death of the Anti-Christ) and the Second Coming of Christ with reference to the biblical Revelation 19:17: \\"There's an angel standing in the sun. He cried with a loud voice, saying to all the birds that fly in the sky, Come! Be gathered together to the great supper of God.\\" After completing the lyrics in this section, Gabriel would pick up and raise an active blacklight tube, holding it near himself, upraised with both hands, as though it were a sword. Gabriel would be the only one lit onstage at this point and would actually appear to be glowing from the combination of blacklight, his reflective white costume and fluorescent makeup. Gabriel considered this effect to be a theatrical way of symbolizing the victory of good/light over evil/darkness. The piece fades out on overdubbing cascading electric guitar parts. On the original recording this section is in the key of A, but because of Gabriel's inability to properly recreate the vocal performance onstage from either hoarseness or tiredness, the band regularly had to change the key to G. The programme describes this section as follows: \\"Above all else an egg is an egg. 'And did those feet ............' making ends meet. Jerusalem = place of peace.\\" This segment was performed as a standalone twice in 1978 and on the first leg of the 1986 Invisible Touch Tour as part of the \\"In the Cage\\"/\\"...In That Quiet Earth\\"/\\"Supper's Ready\\" medley. The final song on A Trick of the Tail, entitled \\"Los Endos\\", quotes from this segment near the very end. As the band fades out, Collins can be heard singing \\"there's an angel standing in the sun\\" twice in succession, followed by \\"free to get back home\\" as the last notes disappear. These are the only lyrics heard in the song, which is otherwise instrumental; this quote has generally been omitted from live versions (except for Steve Hackett's Genesis Revisited: Live at the Royal Albert Hall and Genesis Revisited: Live at Hammersmith in 2012). == Live introduction == Live performances of \\"Supper's Ready\\" were preceded by Peter Gabriel telling a story. At the Rainbow Theatre on 20 October 1973 (as released on the Genesis Archive 1967–75 set), Gabriel told a story about \\"Old Henry\\" (which sometimes changed to \\"Old Michael\\") taking off his clothes and rubbing his flesh into the grass in a park, which attracts a colony of earthworms. The story featured both Gabriel and Phil Collins whistling \\"Jerusalem\\" before announcing, \\"'Jerusalem boogie' to us perhaps, but to the birds, it meant that supper was ready\\". On the 1976 tour for A Trick of the Tail, Mike Rutherford told a story to introduce the song. On the following year's tour for Wind & Wuthering, Phil Collins would tell Peter Gabriel's \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" story from \\"The Cinema Show\\" to introduce the song. In these stories, Juliet wore an \\"I Love Gary Gilmore\\" T-shirt and instead of saying \\"time for 'The Cinema Show'\\", Juliet said: \\"I want to go because I'm hungry and 'Supper's Ready'\\". During the 1982 tour, Collins told a story before the song. Often this story would tie in to the song itself, but on some occasions he told a Romeo and Juliet story instead. At the 1982 Genesis reunion show, Gabriel told a story about a woman on a subway train (which he had told during the Foxtrot tour, and which had appeared on the Genesis Live album cover), slightly altered to segue into \\"Supper's Ready\\". After 1982, only fragments of this song were played live by Genesis. During the first leg of the Invisible Touch tour in 1986, the band played the last two parts (\\"Apocalypse in 9/8\\", \\"As Sure As Eggs Is Eggs\\"). During the We Can't Dance tour in 1992, Collins suggested they play \\"Supper's Ready\\" in its entirety, but was voted down by Rutherford and Banks. Finally, on the Calling All Stations tour in 1998, Genesis performed an acoustic medley containing the first section. The song was played live during the Foxtrot, Selling England by the Pound, A Trick of the Tail, Wind & Wuthering, ...And Then There Were Three..., Three Sides Live encore, Invisible Touch, and Calling All Stations tours. == Musicians == * Peter Gabriel – lead vocals, flute, bass drum, tambourine, oboe * Phil Collins – drums, backing vocals, triangle, tubular bells, percussion, whistles * Tony Banks – piano, Hohner Pianet, Hammond organ, Mellotron, treated piano, 12-string acoustic guitar * Steve Hackett – electric guitar, 12-string acoustic guitar, classical guitar, guitar effects * Mike Rutherford – bass, 12-string acoustic guitar, cello, backing vocals, Dewtron \\"Mister Bassman\\" bass pedals == References == == External links == * * Category:Genesis (band) songs Category:1972 songs Category:Songs written by Peter Gabriel Category:Songs written by Tony Banks (musician) Category:Songs written by Phil Collins Category:Songs written by Steve Hackett Category:Songs written by Mike Rutherford Category:Book of Revelation Category:Music based on the Bible ","title":"Supper's Ready"},{"id":"2547284","text":"Abune Theophilos, also known as Abune Tewophilos, (24 April 1910 – 14 August 1979) was the second Patriarch of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahido Church. He officially succeeded Abuna Basilios in 1971, having assumed the role of acting patriarch upon Abuna Basilios' death in 1970. ==Early life== Abune Theophilos was born as Meliktu Jenbere on 24 April 1910 in the Parish of Debre Elias, district of Debre Marqos, in Gojjam. His parents were Ato Jenbere Wube and Woizero Zeritu Adelahu. After serving and studying at the Monastery of Debre Elias and at the Addis Alem St. Mary of Zion Monastery, Meliktu Jenbere received monastic orders at the Monastery of Debre Libanos in 1937 and received ordination as a priest from Abuna Abraham, Archbishop of Gojjam. In 1942, not long after Emperor Haile Selassie returned from exile, Abba Meliktu was made administrating priest with the title of Memher of the Mekane Selassie (\\"House of the Trinity\\") Monastery in Addis Ababa. Later, with the completion of the Cathedral at this monastery, he was made Dean of this new Holy Trinity Cathedral with the title of Lique Siltanat (\\"Arch-hierarch\\"). Then in 1947, Lique Siltanat Abba Meliktu traveled to Cairo with other high clerics to be made bishops by the Coptic Pope Yusab, the Patriarch of Alexandria. At the same time that Abuna Basilios became Ethiopia's first native-born Metropolitan Archbishop, Abba Meliktu was anointed as bishop of Harar with the name Abune Theophilos. He was also appointed as the personal representative of Pope Yusab to the Synod of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church. After Abune Basilios was made Patriarch of Ethiopia by the Coptic Pope Kyrillos, Abune Theophilos was elevated by the first Patriarch of Ethiopia to Archbishop of Harrar. Between 1951 and 1970, Theophilos served as regent and deputy for the ailing Patriarch Abune Basilios, and towards the end of this period was performing the role of acting Patriarch. Theophilos attended the Congress of the World Council of Churches which was held at Upsala in July 1968. Upon the death of Abune Basilios in 1970, Abune Theophilos was elected on 7 April 1971 and enthroned in Addis Ababa 9 May 1971 as the second Patriarch of Ethiopia. ==Second Patriarch of Ethiopia== Theophilos presided over a period of administrative reform in the Ethiopian Orthodox Church. Attempts were made to bring the church into the 20th century by introducing modern educational methods both in the theological schools and in the churches themselves. Theophilos encouraged ecumenical ties with other Oriental and Eastern Orthodox Churches, and began the process of rapprochement with the Roman Catholic Church. In October 1971 Tewophilos, at the invitation of the Patriarchs of Constantinople and Alexandria, paid a two-week-long visit to Egypt, Greece, and Turkey. In early 1973 he visited the United States. Also in 1973, he was visited by Pope Shenouda III of the Coptic Orthodox Church, Archbishop Makarios, President and Greek Orthodox Primate of Cyprus, and Patriarch Pimen of All Russia. Theophilos at various times visited the Holy Land, several Orthodox sees in Eastern Europe, and also toured the new Ethiopian Orthodox parishes in the Caribbean basin. In February 1972 Theophilos consecrated six new bishops at Holy Trinity Cathedral, the first of two consecrations he carried out during his brief incumbency. In 1974 revolution toppled the monarchy in Ethiopia, and the Marxist-Leninist Derg regime replaced Emperor Haile Selassie in government. The government was officially atheist, but equality of religions was proclaimed, and the Ethiopian Church ceased to be the state church. While at first staying out of politics, Theophilos became disillusioned with the Derg's ideology, and was horrified by the massacre of 60 ex-officials of the Emperor's government in November 1974. He was refused permission to receive the remains of Emperor Haile Selassie after his death in unclear circumstances in August 1975 and was warned not to conduct public memorial services in his name. With the disestablishment of the church and the severing of ties between church and state, Theophilos believed that he was entitled to make all decisions concerning the church independent of the authorities, and appointed and consecrated three new bishops without consulting the Derg. These bishops were Abuna Paulos, (who would eventually become the fifth Patriarch of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahido Church), Bishop Abune Basilios, and Bishop Abune Petros. The Derg then arrested Theophilos in May 1976, along with the three newly consecrated bishops. The Synod of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church was ordered by the Derg to elect a new leader, and Patriarch Abuna Tekle Haymanot was elected to lead the church. The Coptic Patriarchate in Egypt, however, denounced the imprisonment of Theophilos, and refused to recognize the election and enthronement of the new Abuna. The Coptic Church argued that the removal of Theophilos was not canonical as it was done by the government and not by the Synod of the Orthodox Church, nor had Theophilos abdicated. As a result, ties between the Coptic and Ethiopian Orthodox Churches were severed. ==Imprisonment and death== Theophilos was seized at the Patriarchal Palace in the precincts of the Saint of Saint's St. Mary's Patriarchal Monastery, and taken to the Emperor's former residence, the Jubilee Palace (renamed the National Palace by the Derg regime) on 17 February 1976. He was placed under solitary confinement in rooms formerly reserved for the use of Rear Admiral Prince Eskinder Desta, the Emperor's grandson who had been executed with the 60 Imperial ex-officials in November 1974. One afternoon of uncertain date Theophilos managed to escape from the palace disguised as a layman while soldiers guarding the palace were distracted by a broadcast soccer match. Theophilos later told fellow-prisoners that he had thought to head to the Greek Embassy, but then decided to make his way to the Asebot monastery in his former diocese of Harrar in the east of the country. He made his way to the Gofa St. Gabriel's Church to hide and prepare for his journey to Asebot, counting on the loyalty of the clergy at this church, but his location was reported to the Derg by someone at the church, and he was taken back into custody. Theophilos was escorted barefoot to the old Menelik (Grand) Palace and again placed in solitary confinement, chained to his bed, his hands and feet cuffed. Four days later, he was taken to join Ward 1 of the Menelik Palace prison where the highest ranking surviving officials of the Imperial government were being held. Theophilos is believed to have entered into a severe fast (essentially a hunger strike) for 40 days and only broke it on Easter Monday after two imprisoned elder noblemen, Bitwoded Zewde Gebre- Hiwot (former mayor of Addis Ababa and President of the Imperial Senate) and Dejazmach Haregot Abay (former Crown Councilor and noble and parliamentarian of Eritrea) pleaded with him on their knees. Theophilos was subjected to numerous indignities while imprisoned. The gold handcross he had been given by the Emperor upon his enthronement was taken from him, along with an icon of the crucifixion that he kept by his bed. He was also ordered to sign papers as \\"Abba Meliktu\\" his pre-episcopal name, which he steadfastly refused to do, signing his name always as \\"Abune Tewophilos\\". He asked repeatedly that he be imprisoned in a monastery such as Asebot or elsewhere, but was refused. Theophilos conducted prayer services for his fellow prisoners twice daily and said the Holy Liturgy of the Mass every Sunday, assisted by the imprisoned Nebre-Id Ermias of Axum. In July 1979, the Derg ordered the immediate execution of several more high officials of the Emperor's government. On 10 July 1979, nobleman and the Emperor's close aide, Tsehafi Taezaz Teferrawork, and former minister Seifu Mahteme Selassie were summoned and removed from the Palace prison and did not return. On 12 July 1979, former ministers Yohannes Kidane Mariam, Abebe Kebede and Assefa Defaye were similarly taken away. It became obvious to the other prisoners that the men had been executed, and in preparation, many of them approached imprisoned clergy for absolution of their sins. Finally, on Saturday, 14 July 1979 on the feast day of the Holy Trinity, Dejazmatch Kassa Wolde Mariam and General Samuel were summoned. Dejazmatch Kassa Wolde Mariam, heir to the old Oromo Kingdom of Leqa Qellam, former President of Haile Selassie University, and grandson-in-law to Emperor Haile Selassie, was on his knees before the Theophilos receiving his final absolution before going to his death, when Theophilos himself was called. He turned and asked Nebre-Id Ermias to absolve him, and he left the prison together with Dejazmatch Kassa. Theophilos and his fellow prisoners were taken to the former palace of Prince Asrate Kassa and were executed and buried there. On 14 August 1979, Theophilos was killed by being strangled by electrical wire, and buried face-down in a deep trench grave. His remains would later be identified by long black clerical robes and monk's cap. Following the fall of the Derg regime, Theophilos' remains were disinterred from the grounds of the former palace of Prince Asrate Kassa, and reburied in full ceremonial state at the Gofa St. Gabriel church which he himself had built in southern Addis Ababa and was canonized. ==See also== *List of Abunas of Ethiopia ==References== Category:1910 births Category:1979 deaths Category:Patriarchs of Ethiopia Category:Executed priests Category:Executed Ethiopian people Category:People executed by Ethiopia Category:Ethiopian anti- communists Category:20th-century Oriental Orthodox archbishops ","title":"Abuna Theophilos"},{"id":"2547301","text":"Gerald Harrison (24 June 1942 – 3 January 1986), who performed under the name Dustin Gee, was an English impressionist and comedian, best known for his double act with fellow comic Les Dennis. ==Life== Born Gerald Harrison in York, Gee left school at 15 and studied at art college. He took a job as an artist, working mainly with stained glass and for a while worked on the stained glass windows at York Minster.The Times obituary, 6 January 1986 He played in a rock band in the evenings called the Dare Devils and later 'Gerry B and the Hornets' before they altered the name to 'Gerry B and the Rockafellas'. When the group disbanded, Gee became a compere, then later a comedian. In 1975, Gee met his future comedy partner, Les Dennis. After 20 years in showbusiness, Gee got his television break on Who Do You Do?, an ITV showcase. The show gave the opportunity for up and coming entertainers and impressionists to impersonate stars. Les Dennis also appeared on this show. From April 1980 to July 1985, Gee was star guest on Russ Abbot's Madhouse. Les Dennis became one of the cast in 1982; it was during this year that Gee and Dennis formed a comedy double act. By this time, Gee was a cabaret star in the UK, selling out theatres and nightclubs somehow by word of mouth alone, despite being on weekly television. This was the show that included his most famous impression, as Coronation Street's Vera Duckworth in two-handers with Mavis Riley (played by Les Dennis). In 1982, Gee appeared on ITV's talent show Success, alongside a sixteen-year-old Lisa Stansfield, who was making her TV debut. His take on John Cleese as eccentric hotel owner Basil Fawlty was acclaimed by Cleese as the \\"best he'd seen\\". Billy Connolly told his partner Les Dennis that he always wanted to meet Gee and regretted that he never did so. When Gee perfected his imitation of Larry Grayson, Grayson thought so highly of it that he praised Gee in public and on television for it. The pair became close friends and remained so until Gee's death. On Saturday 7 April 1984, Gee and Dennis began their own TV comedy show, The Laughter Show (retitled, Les & Dustin's Laughter Show for the third series). The first episode of a third and final series aired on Saturday 28 December 1985. The second episode had already been planned to be postponed for a fortnight, but it was during this time that Gee died. Soon after Gee's death, the BBC decided to cancel the rest of the series, but it was resumed upon the request of Gee's family. In the summer of 1986, the third series of the Laughter Show was repeated uninterrupted as a tribute to Gee. On Sunday 15 April 1984, when Tommy Cooper suffered a massive heart attack whilst appearing on ITV's Live From Her Majesty's, Gee and Dennis were the act that was billed to follow him. They performed onstage whilst attempts were being made, backstage, to revive Cooper. ==Illness and death== On 24 May 1985, Gee felt ill whilst on stage at the opening night of a summer season at the North Pier in Blackpool. He carried on but after the show he was taken to Blackpool Victoria Hospital where a minor heart attack was diagnosed. News was put out that he'd suffered a chest infection. Gee was also told that he had dilated cardiomyopathy. He was discharged on 30 May and returned on his birthday, to complete the run until the end of September, thus ignoring the doctors at the hospital who told him to not work at all for six months. That autumn, Gee and Dennis recorded the third series of their Laughter Show– the first episode aired on 28 December 1985. From 20 December 1985, Gee and Dennis appeared in pantomime at the Southport Theatre, Merseyside but on 1 January 1986, Gee suffered a massive heart attack. They were playing the ugly sisters in Cinderella, a role they had played two years before in Bradford, when they appeared with Russ Abbot. At the end of a scene, Gee suddenly clutched his left arm. When they reached their dressing room he said to Dennis \\"I think I am dying.\\" He collapsed and lost consciousness shortly after. Basil Soper, the show's company manager, was successful in reviving him.Les Dennis (2008). Must The Show Go On? Orion. . Roger Edwards (his PA) accompanied him to Southport General Hospital. On arrival at the hospital, Gee collapsed and fell unconscious again. The following day Dennis and Edwards were by his bedside. Gee was still unconscious but they both urged him to keep fighting and he raised a finger. Gee suddenly woke up at 8 a.m. the following day. He asked for a cup of tea and some ice cream. According to his family members who were with him, he was \\"quite chatty\\". He thanked them for coming and said that they must see him in pantomime when he recovered – he also asked where his watch was. He was sitting up for a while and it appeared as if he was going to survive and recover. However, later that morning Gee lost consciousness again and died at 12:45 p.m. Jim Bowen replaced Gee in the pantomime. Gee's funeral was held on 9 January 1986, at St Oswald's Church, at Fulford, York. Three hundred people attended, amongst them Elizabeth Dawn, Bill Tarmey, Thelma Barlow, Sherrie Hewson, Dana, John Hamp, The Krankies, John Birt and Les Dennis.

After leaving school at fifteen he took various jobs, before returning, as a mature student, to Keele University, where he achieved first class honours in English and Philosophy, and University of London, which awarded him his PhD. ==Career== As a Reader at the University of Sussex, he co-founded with his then-partner Alan Sinfield the Centre for the Study of Sexual Dissidence, which, as he remembers in Sex, Literature and Censorship, 'attracted some notoriety for being the first of its kind in the country'. He later became Professor of English and Related Literature at the University of York. Dollimore is credited with making major interventions in debates on sexuality and desire, Renaissance literary culture, art and censorship, and cultural theory. ===Work=== Radical Tragedy (1984, 2nd edition 1989, 3rd edition 2004) In his first book, Dollimore argues that the humanist critical tradition has distorted for modern readers the actual radical function of Early Modern English drama, which had to do with 'a critique of ideology, the demystification of political and power relations and the decentring of \\"man\\"'. Political Shakespeare: Essays in Cultural Materialism, edited with Alan Sinfield (1985, 2nd edition 1994) Treading the same path as Radical Tragedy, this compendium of essays by leading writers on Shakespeare has as its goal to replace our idea of a timeless, humane and civilising Shakespeare with a Shakespeare anchored in the social, political and ideological conflicts of his historical moment. Included are essays by Stephen Greenblatt and Kathleen McLuskie. Sexual Dissidence (1991) In Sexual Dissidence, Dollimore sets out “to retrieve lost histories of perversion”, in part by tracing the term “perverse” back to its etymological origins in Latin and its epistemological origins in Augustine. A second theoretical section places Freud and Foucault in dialogue on the subject of perversion, followed by a second historical section, this time, on homophobia. Death, Desire, and Loss (1998) In a wide- ranging survey from Anaximander to AIDS, Dollimore presses his case that the drive to relinquish the self has always lurked within Western notions of identity and can be found above all, ‘perversely, lethally, ecstatically’ in sexuality. Sex, Literature, and Censorship (2001) Dollimore explores the relationship between ethics and aesthetics, centring his discussion on literature’s “dangerous knowledge”. He calls for a shift in critical values from theoretical learning to experiential knowledge, endorsing a criticism capable of “being historically imaginative inside a perspective which one is also critically resisting” (p. 45). Jonathan Dollimore in Conversation (2013) This interview with David Jonathan Bayot introduces Dollimore's critical view on aesthetics, ethics, and politics and on how to mobilize them alongside desire and spirituality for a radical materialist practice. Some of the questions addressed by Dollimore in the interview include: What is cultural materialism and how does it foreground itself vis-a-vis humanism and postmodernism? what is the task of criticism and literary pedagogy in the context of literature and the canon under fire? Stephen Greenblatt writes: \\"Not only a valuable introduction to the work of a vital theorist and critic, Jonathan Dollimore in Conversation is also an important cultural document: it captures what it felt like to be alive intellectually in a particular, intensely contentious and creative historical moment.\\" ===Ideas=== “The perverse dynamic”, is one of Dollimore’s most crucial theoretical concepts, first described in Sexual Dissidence, and later applied in Sex, Literature, and Censorship. The “perverse dynamic” is the production of perversion from within the very social structures that are offended by it and often enforce against it. The perverse “other” turns out not to be the remote alien thing it is supposed to be, enabling a “tracking-back of the ‘other’ into the ‘same’” (33). This return of the suppressed via the proximate Dollimore calls “transgressive reinscription.” ===Recent writings=== Dollimore’s essay \\"On Leaving\\" (2011) is biographical, dealing with its author’s teenage years, his arrival at university, then his departure from that place later in his life, but it also includes a more abstract discussion of the modern university and its function in society. Dollimore discusses the modern professionalised academy, and argues that it promotes mediocrity: 'the professionally defended arts academic is only half alive'; 'professional success – the successful career – is one of the most compromised, complicit and corrupt kinds of success available today.' Dollimore claims that, even if it has always been true that 'you have to find your way through or around formal education in search for what really matters,' it is also true that '[n]ever before… has the project of creating value inside of, and against, educational institutions been so necessary.' In \\"A Civilization and its Darkness\\" (2012) Dollimore examines Joseph Conrad's novel Heart of Darkness, and explores the relationship between civilisation and the forces that subvert and destroy it. Civilization, Dollimore writes, 'is, at some level, profoundly and necessarily limited, focused and exclusionary, built on repressions which remain constitutive.' The repressed forces, however, re-emerge intensified, which means that 'only the most highly civilised can become truly daemonic.' Dollimore also reiterates, from Sex, Literature and Censorship, his belief that 'to take art seriously is to recognise that it has the power to compromise both our morality and our humanity.' Dollimore, in his extended \\"Foreword\\" to Ewan Fernie's book The Demonic (2012), discusses centrally the modern state of literary criticism. He dislikes the 'obscurantist' tendencies of a lot of so-called \\"theory,\\" but he also deplores the fact that 'historicism in one newish form or another, has become a new orthodoxy.' The most committed historicism, Dollimore claims, 'tends towards a policing of the play [or whatever else] against interpretation. It doesn't just avoid questions of value, but represses them; in other words it's a contextualising which is also, and more fundamentally, a containment.' A call for a new sort of spiritually intense living runs through Dollimore's recent writings. For example, in his \\"Foreword\\", he counsels that 'authenticity is more often than not outside the doxa,' and states: 'almost everything that is done, including what we ourselves do, be it at the macro or the micro level, could and should be done more authentically, more honestly, more meaningfully, more truthfully.' Dollimore's most recent book is his new autobiography Desire: A Memoir published by Bloomsbury Academic in July 2017.https://www.bloomsbury.com/au/desire-a-memoir-9781350023109/ Lynne Segal writing about the book says: All the mystery, miseries, and delights of lust and longing are exquisitely laid bare, in a memoir so riveting you will return to it again and again. ==Personal life== In the 1970s and 1980s, Dollimore owned a cottage in Shropshire with his partner, Alan Sinfield. == Selected publications == * Dollimore, Jonathan (1983) (with Alan Sinfield).

He is ranked alongside William James and Wilhelm Wundt as one of the founding fathers of psychology.Graham F. Reed, 'Janet, Pierre', in Richard Gregory ed., The Oxford Companion to the Mind (1987) p. 397 ==Biography== Janet studied under Jean-Martin Charcot at the Psychological Laboratory in the Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital in Paris. He first published the results of his research in his philosophy thesis in 1889 and in his medical thesis, L'état mental des hystériques, in 1892. He earned a degree in medicine the following year in 1893. In 1898, Janet was appointed lecturer in psychology at the Sorbonne, and in 1902 he attained the chair of experimental and comparative psychology at the Collège de France, a position he held until 1936. He was a member of the Institut de France from 1913, and was a central figure in French psychology in the first half of the 20th century.E. Roudinesco, Jacques Lacan (2005) p.16–21. ==Theories== Janet was one of the first people to allege a connection between events in a subject's past life and his or her present-day trauma, and coined the words \\"dissociation\\"O. L. Zangwill, 'Hypnotism, history of', in Gregory ed., p. 332 and \\"subconscious\\".Henri F. Ellenberger, The Discovery of the Unconscious (1970) p. 147 and p. 406. His study of the \\"magnetic passion\\" or \\"rapport\\" between the patient and the hypnotist anticipated later accounts of the transference phenomenon.Peter Gay, Freud: A Life for Our Time (1988) p. 50. The 20th century saw Janet developing a grand model of the mind in terms of levels of energy, efficiency and social competence, which he set out in publications including Obsessions and Psychasthenia (1903) and From Anguish to Ecstasy (1926), among others.Ellenberger, p. 386 In its concern for the construction of the personality in social terms, this model has been compared to the social behaviorism of George Herbert MeadEllenberger, p. 405–406. something which explains Lacan's early praise of \\"Janet, who demonstrated so admirably the signification of feelings of persecution as phenomenological moments in social behaviour\\".Jacques Lacan, Écrits: A Selection (1997) p. 17. ===Developmental hierarchy=== Janet established a developmental model of the mind in terms of a hierarchy of nine \\"tendencies\\" of increasingly complex organisational levels.Reed, p. 398. He detailed four \\"lower tendencies\\", rising from the \\"reflexive\\" to the \\"elementary intellectual\\"; two \\"middle tendencies\\", involving language and the social world; and three \\"higher tendencies\\", the \\"rational-ergotic\\" world of work, and the \\"experimental and progressive tendencies\\".Ellenberger, p. 387–394. According to Janet, neurosis could be seen as a failure to integrate, or a regression to earlier tendencies,Red, p. 398 and he defined subconsciousness as \\"an act which has kept an inferior form amidst acts of a higher level\\".Quoted in Ellenberger, p. 387. ==Influence on depth psychology== Pierre Janet, by Dornac. ===William James=== In his 1890 essay The Hidden Self, William James wrote of P. Janet's observations of \\"hysterical somnambulist\\" patients at Havre Hospital, detailed in Janet's 1889 doctorate of letters thesis, De l'Automatisme Psychologique. James made note of various aspects of automatism and the apparent multiple personalities (\\"two selves\\") of patients variously exhibiting \\"trances, subconscious states\\" or alcoholic delirium tremens. James was apparently fascinated by these manifestations and said, \\"How far the splitting of the mind into separate conciousnesses may obtain in each one of us is a problem. P. Janet holds that it is only possible where there is an abnormal weakness, and consequently a defect of unifying or coordinating power.\\" ===Freud=== Controversy over whose ideas came first, Janet's or Sigmund Freud's, emerged at the 1913 Congress of Medicine in London.Ellenberger, p. 817 Prior to that date, Freud had freely acknowledged his debt to Janet, particularly in his work with Josef Breuer, writing for example of \\"the theory of hysterical phenomena first put forward by P. Janet and elaborated by Breuer and myself\\".Sigmund Freud, On Metapsychology (PFL 11) p. 52. He stated further that \\"we followed his example when we took the splitting of the mind and dissociation of the personality as the centre of our position\\", but he was also careful to point out where \\"the difference lies between our view and Janet's\\".Sigmund Freud, Five Lectures on Psycho-Analysis (1995) p. 25–33. Writing in 1911 of the neurotic's withdrawal from reality, Freud stated: \\"Nor could a fact like this escape the observation of Pierre Janet; he spoke of a loss of 'the function of reality'\\",Freud, Metapsychology, p. 35. and as late as 1930, Freud drew on Janet's expression \\"psychological poverty\\" in his work on civilisation.Sigmund Freud, Civilization, Society and Religion (PFL 12) p. 306–307. However, in his report on psychoanalysis in 1913, Janet argued that many of the novel terms of psychoanalysis were only old concepts renamed, even down to the way in which his own \\"psychological analysis\\" preceded Freud's \\"psychoanalysis\\".Ellenberger, p. 817 This provoked angry attacks from Freud's followers, and thereafter Freud's own attitude towards Janet cooled. In his lectures of 1915-16, Freud said that \\"for a long time I was prepared to give Janet very great credit for throwing light on neurotic symptoms, because he regarded them as expressions of idées inconscientes which dominated the patients\\". However, after what Freud saw as his backpedalling in 1913, he said, \\"I think he has unnecessarily forfeited much credit\\".Sigmund Freud, Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis (PFL 1) p. 296. The charge of plagiarism stung Freud especially. In his autobiographical sketch of 1925, he denied firmly that he had plagiarized Janet,Freud, Sigmund An Autobiographical Study WW Norton and Company 1989 page 11 and as late as 1937, he refused to meet Janet on the grounds that \\"when the libel was spread by French writers that I had listened to his lectures and stolen his ideas he could with a word have put an end to such talk\\"Quoted in Ernest Jones, The Life and Work of Sigmund Freud (1964) p. 633 but did not. A balanced judgement might be that Janet's ideas, as published, did indeed form part of Freud's starting point, but that Freud subsequently developed them substantively in his own fashion.Ellenberger, p.539–540. ===Jung=== Carl Jung studied with Janet in Paris in 1902Gay, p. 198 and was much influenced by him, for example equating what he called a complex with Janet's idée fixe subconsciente.Ellenberger, p. 149. Jung's view of the mind as \\"consisting of an indefinite, because unknown, number of complexes or fragmentary personalities\\"Quoted in Neville Symington, Narcissism: A New Theory (1993) p. 20 built upon what Janet in Psychological Automatism called \\"simultaneous psychological existences\\".Ellenberger, p. 406. Jung wrote of the debt owed to \\"Janet for a deeper and more exact knowledge of hysterical symptoms\\", and talked of \\"the achievements of Janet, Flournoy, Freud and others\\"C. Jung, The Practice of Psychotherapy (1993) p. 112 and p. 139. in exploring the unconscious. ===Adler=== Alfred Adler openly derived his inferiority complex concept from Janet's Sentiment d'incomplétude,Reed, p. 398 and the two men cited each other's work on the issue in their writings.O. Brachfeld, Inferiority Feeling in the Individual and the Group (2000) p. 53 ==Publications== In 1923, Janet wrote a definitive text on suggestion, La médecine psychologique, and in 1928-32 published several definitive papers on memory. While Janet did not publish much in English, the 15 lectures that he gave to the Harvard Medical School between 15 October and the end of November 1906 were published in 1907 as The Major Symptoms of Hysteria. He received an honorary doctorate from Harvard in 1936. Of his great synthesis of human psychology, Henri Ellenberger wrote that \\"this requires about twenty books and several dozen of articles\\".Ellenberger, p. 387. ==See also== == References == ==Further reading== * Brooks III, J.

Kodee's plight was detailed in letters published in the Daily Egyptian, a student newspaper for Southern Illinois University in Carbondale, Illinois, beginning in 2003. ==Hoax== The story was concocted by Jaimie Reynolds, a woman who claimed to be Colleen Hastings, caregiver of the fictional Kodee. Reynolds allegedly passed a letter supposedly written by \\"Kodee,\\" to Michael Brenner, who was then a sports editor at the Egyptian which prompted a feature story published May 6, 2003. In the article, \\"Kodee\\" told how upset she was by an anti-war protest at the university campus, and of her worries about her father \\"Dan\\" who was shipping off to Iraq with the 101st Airborne. Kodee's mother was said to be dead. Over the next year, the Egyptian would publish, unedited, notes and letters from \\"Kodee\\", liberally strewn with misspellings and phonetic English, to update their readers about Dan's Iraq service or Kodee's daily life. A young friend of Reynolds, Caitlin Hadley, the daughter of a Nazarene minister, was recruited to play the part of Kodee for photographs, and a nurse, Patrick Trovillion, played Dan. Both believed that they were playing parts in a movie. \\"Kodee\\" was taken to the Egyptian newsroom and other Carbondale locations. \\"Dan\\" was photographed wearing camouflage, sitting on a tank, and meeting with school children in Michigan. \\"Dan\\" also called the newsroom and maintained an e-mail address at Yahoo! \\"Dan\\" was even portrayed as having been injured in a December, 2004 explosion in a mess hall at a base near Mosul, Iraq. He reportedly returned to duty just weeks later, and was later injured by a roadside bomb which struck a Humvee in which he was traveling. Reynolds also apparently penned a guest editorial published in the name of a real war widow, wherein the author claimed that her late husband had been a war buddy of Kennings'. To further attempt to turn her hoax into reality, Jaimie Reynolds would dial the Daily Egyptian newsroom and – unbeknown to DE staff – allegedly disguise her voice to pretend to be the fictional girl \\"Kodee Kennings\\" wanting to talk to staff. Throughout the hoax, Jaimie Reynolds also passed herself off as the twin sister of the fictional \\"Colleen Hastings\\" and visited the Daily Egyptian newsroom alternating as either Jaimie or \\"Colleen.\\" Reynolds was a broadcast-journalism student at Southern Illinois University and graduated in 2004, putting her in classes alongside Daily Egyptian staff. ==Exposure== The hoax unraveled when Reynolds claimed in August 2005 that Kennings had died in Iraq. This news was published in the Egyptian, leading reporters from the Tribune to seek an interview with \\"Hastings.\\" These reporters became suspicious when Reynolds routed interview requests through Brenner, who had become a close friend of hers. Reynolds and Hadley (as \\"Hastings\\" and \\"Kodee\\"), along with members of the Egyptian staff, attended a memorial service arranged at the local American Legion outpost. After openly weeping at the service, Reynolds and Hadley met with Tribune reporters briefly at a restaurant, where they were told that media liaisons at The Pentagon were unable to confirm the existence of Kennings. Reynolds refused to provide any proof of Kennings' existence. Days later, reporters located her at her mother's home in Marion, Illinois, where she admitted to participating in the hoax. Brenner was duped by Reynolds. After numerous articles in the Chicago Tribune, the Associated Press, the St. Louis Post- Dispatch and the Daily Egyptian itself, it appeared no crime was committed. The parents of Hadley were particularly upset, however and considered a restraining order against Reynolds. Subsequent attempts to contact Reynolds after news of her hoax broke were unsuccessful. Reynolds went so far as to change the identity of her cell-phone voicemail from the fictional \\"Colleen Hastings\\" to \\"Blank Blank.\\" ==Investigation== The Daily Egyptian subsequently investigated the hoax that had been perpetrated on its own paper. In part due to that investigation, the Egyptian won the Illinois College Press Association's General Excellence Award in 2006, as well as first place in the Investigative Reporting category. == References == * You Can Fool All of the People Some of the Time, Chicago Reader, September 2, 2005.

He competed in the men's individual road race at the 1996 Summer Olympics. == Cycling career == Tchmil was born in Khabarovsk, Russia. His family moved to Ukraine during the days of the Soviet Union. He started cycling and showed enough talent to be moved to a cycling school in Moldova. The glasnost in the Soviet Union allowed him to try a professional career with the Italian Alfa Lum team in 1989.Andrei Tchmil By Tomas Nilsson After the collapse of the Soviet Union he became a Ukrainian citizen, although he eventually moved to Belgium early in his professional career. \\"People are cynical when I talk about Belgium. They think I'm only Belgian on paper. That is not true. Yes, I was a Russian, even a proud one.... Now I am proud to be Belgian. The first thing I did was learn French. Now there are some books in my suitcase to learn Flemish. It's not easy,\\" Tchmil said in an interview with Cycle Sport. Tchmil rode the Tour de France five times, but only finished twice and never won a stage. Tchmil was most famous as a classic cobbled race specialist, thriving in races such as Tour of Flanders, Gent–Wevelgem, Omloop \\"Het Volk\\", and Paris–Roubaix. His first UCI Road World Cup win was in Paris–Roubaix in 1994. He also won the Paris–Tours in 1997 (earning the Ruban Jaune in so doing) and Milan–San Remo in 1999. His last celebrated victory was in the Tour of Flanders in 2000 when he overpowered rival Johan Museeuw in the finale. He was easily recognizable in the races, with his signature grimace, old-style helmet, and his powerful riding style. He won the UCI Road World Cup in 1999. Tchmil retired in 2002, after having been forced to end his spring classics campaign due to a bad fall during the Three Days of De Panne in which his thigh was crushed. == Post- cycling career == After his professional cycling career, Tchmil joined Chocolade Jacques as a consultant, but he left because according to Tchmil the riders would not listen to him. In 2004, he was approached by the UCI to set up a cycling centre, which he did.Tchmil managing Moldavian sport In August 2006, Tchmil was appointed Minister of Sport in Moldova.Minister of sport

It was produced by Brad Wyman and Chris Hanley and features a large ensemble cast of actors, including Buscemi, Anthony LaPaglia, Chloë Sevigny, and Samuel L. Jackson. The film's black humor is based on examination of characters' self-destructive behavior, centered around their shared hangout of the titular bar and lounge. Critical reception was mostly positive. Trees Lounge has also been cited as an influence by The Sopranos creator David Chase, who later hired Buscemi to direct \\"Pine Barrens\\" and three other episodes of the show, and to star as Tony Soprano's cousin Tony Blundetto during the show's fifth season. It was filmed in Glendale, Queens; Brooklyn; and Valley Stream, New York. ==Plot== Tommy Basilio is an alcoholic and fixture at a local bar, the Trees Lounge, who loses his girlfriend of eight years and his job as a mechanic. After his Uncle Al dies while driving his ice cream truck, Tommy goes to his wake and indulges in cocaine with his brother and cousins. Tommy takes them to the Trees Lounge to carry on drinking, but a brawl breaks out between his cousin and Mike, another regular. After buying more beer at a late night convenience store, Mike and Tommy discuss how Tommy stole money from Rob, the owner of the garage where he lost his job. They discuss how Rob is seeing Tommy's ex-girlfriend, Theresa, who may or may not be bearing his child. Mike turns out to be the owner of the moving company across the street from the Trees Lounge. Tommy asks for work, but Mike says he doesn't need a mechanic. Tommy takes on Uncle Al's ice-cream round, but children initially do not buy from him. Theresa's flirtatious seventeen-year-old niece, Debbie, joins Tommy on his round, saying she had a dream about him. Mike's wife and daughter have left him because of his drinking, and tell him they plan to move upstate. Debbie and friend Kelly go to the Trees Lounge but are unable to prove they are of legal drinking age. Debbie claims her \\"boyfriend\\" Tommy will vouch for her. Mike, Tommy and the two girls are at Mike's house drinking, but the latter three are thrown out when Mike's wife calls. Tommy and Debbie spend the night together, though nothing happens between them more than a drunken kiss. The following morning, Tommy runs into Debbie's father Jerry, who was looking for her the night before. When Jerry finds out his daughter was with Tommy, he assaults him with a baseball bat and wrecks the ice-cream truck. After Theresa has her baby, Tommy tries and fails to make amends. When Tommy returns to the Trees Lounge, he hears that an elderly regular named Bill collapsed has been taken to hospital gravely ill. The barmaid and other regulars discuss how someone ought to visit Bill in the hospital, but they forget about him as they carry on drinking. Tommy sits in Bill's regular seat and stares at the glass of beer, realizing what he has become. ==Cast== *Steve Buscemi as Tommy *Chloë Sevigny as Debbie *Mark Boone Junior as Mike *Anthony LaPaglia as Rob *Elizabeth Bracco as Theresa *Eszter Balint as Marie *Carol Kane as Connie *Daniel Baldwin as Jerry *Mimi Rogers as Patty *Debi Mazar as Crystal *Seymour Cassel as Uncle Al *Samuel L.

Roger Ebert gave the film 3½ stars out of 4, stating \\"Steve Buscemi, who plays Tommy and also wrote and directed the film, knows about alcoholism from the inside out and backward, and his movie is the most accurate portrait of the daily saloon drinker I have ever seen.\\" === Accolades === Trees Lounge earned Buscemi nominations for Best First Screenplay as well as Best First Feature (along with producers Brad Wyman and Chris Wyman) at the 1997 Independent Spirit Awards, though it didn't win. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1996 films Category:American black comedy films Category:American films Category:American comedy-drama films Category:Artisan Entertainment films Category:Films set in New York (state) Category:Films directed by Steve Buscemi Category:Films about alcoholism Category:Geneon USA Category:1996 directorial debut films ","title":"Trees Lounge"},{"id":"2547390","text":"Setske de Haan (24 November 1889 – 31 October 1948), better known by her pen name Cissy van Marxveldt, was a Dutch writer of children's books. She is best known for her series of Joop ter Heul novels. ==Biography== Setske de Haan was born on 24 November 1889 in Oranjewoud, a village in the northern province of Friesland in the Netherlands. She was the daughter of IJnze de Haan, a headmaster and history teacher, and Froukje de Groot. In 1914, she met Leon Beek, a jewish reserve infantry officer who became a department store manager. De Haan and Beek married on 2 February 1916 and had two sons, Ynze and Leo. During the German occupation of the Netherlands, Beek was a member of the Dutch resistance. After a failed attempt to escape from the Westerbork transit camp he was executed in 1944 in Overveen.Leon Beek, Eerebegraafplaats Bloemendaal It was 1946 before De Haan learned of his fate. She died in Bussum on 31 October 1948. ==Career in writing== Cover of the first Joop ter Heul novel De Haan embarked on her literary career by writing articles and stories for Dutch magazines, using the pseudonyms Cissy van Marxveldt, Betty Bierema en Ans Woud. In the year she married (1916), she published the first book in what was to become a series of novels about a headstrong girl, Joop ter Heul. The books, similar in theme to Louisa May Alcott's Little Women, contain many diary entries and letters. They chart the fortunes of Joop, her sister and her school friends, from girlhood through marriage. The series consists of five volumes: * The High School Years of Joop ter Heul (1919) * Joop ter Heul's Problems (1921) * Joop ter Heul Gets Married (1923) * Joop and Her Boys (1925) * Joop ter Heul's Daughter (1946) Van Marxvelt's Joop ter Heul novels for teenage girls had a notable influence on the writings of Anne Frank, who addressed her diary letters to an imaginary friend named Kitty. Anne Frank scholars, as well as Anne's friend Kitty Egyedi, are united in their belief that Frank's Kitty was based on a character created by Van Marxveldt: Kitty Francken, a friend of Joop's and a frequent recipient of her letters. Van Marxveldt also wrote many other young-adult books, of which Een zomerzotheid (\\"A Summer Folly\\") was a particular good seller, that made her affluent. She dedicated her last book She Suffered Too to her husband, after she learned of his execution by the Nazi-occupant forces, because he had been a resistance fighter. ==Bibliography== During her lifetime, Cissy van Marxveldt published 27 books.

He is best remembered for having recruited Latvian-American communist Nicholas Dozenberg to work for the GRU late in 1927. == Early life == Alfred Tilton was born March 4, 1897, in Mežotne parish, Latvia, then part of the Russian empire. Tilton was the son of peasants of ethnic Latvian descent.\\"Al'fred Matisovich Tyltyn',\\" Khronos website, Hrono.ru/ (In Russian). Retrieved August 23, 2010. A well-educated individual, Tilton eventually learned Russian, German, French, and English as well as his native Latvian. == Education == Tilton graduated from the Alexseev Military College in 1916. == Career == Tilton was a company commander in the Latvian 3rd Infantry Regiment, attaining the rank of Lieutenant. He also underwent machine gun training in 1917. Tilton joined the Russian Communist Party in 1918 and was a Brigade Commander in the Red Army during the Russian Civil War. Tilton was captured by the Poles during the 1920 invasion of Poland and held as a prisoner of war, eventually gaining his repatriation to Soviet Russia in a February 1921 prisoner exchange. Upon his return, Tilton was enrolled in the Military Academy of the Red Army, where he studied until 1922. Leaving the Military Academy in 1922, Tilton became an active participant in Soviet military intelligence operations abroad. Tilton acted as the GRU's underground rezident (station head) in Paris from 1922 to 1926. During this interval Tilton also took courses at the Polytechnic Institute of Air and Motors in Paris. Tilton worked for military intelligence in Germany during 1926 and 1927 before being transferred to New York City, where he became the GRU's rezident. While in New York, Tilton and his wife, Maria, made use of a cover story that they were Mr. and Mrs. Joseph Paquett, from Canada.Nicholas Dozenberg, Executive Session Testimony of May 21, 1940, in House Committee on Un-American Activities, Investigation of Un-American Propaganda Activities in the United States: Executive Hearings, Volume 2. Washington: US Government Printing Office, 1941; pg. 571. The pair also used the name Mr. and Mrs. Alfred Martin during this time. As part of his job in America, late in 1927 Tilton made the acquaintance of Workers (Communist) Party functionary Nicholas Dozenberg, convincing him to drop out from organized party activity and to go to work for the GRU. Tilton was recalled to the USSR in the summer of 1930. He served as the Assistant Commander of a mechanized brigade from July 1930 to March 1931 and was the head of Belorussian mechanized troops from March 1931 to March 1932. From March 1932 to June 1936, Tilton served as the Commander and Commissar of the 5th Detached Mechanized Brigade in the town of Borisov. From June 1936 to November 1937, Tilton served in the Spanish Civil War fighting in the defense of the Spanish Republic. ===Arrest, death, and legacy=== Tilton was arrested on November 27, 1937, during the height of the Great Terror. He did not immediately plead guilty to alleged crimes, however, only being sentenced on December 15, 1940, well after the fall of Secret Police head Nikolai Ezhov. Tilton was sentenced to a term of 15 years imprisonment in a labor camp of the Gulag, a sentence which ultimately proved fatal due to the starvation-level of provisions allowed prisoners during World War II. == Personal life == Tilton died on February 11, 1942. Tilton was posthumously rehabilitated by the Khrushchev government on March 26, 1957. == Awards == Tilton was recipient of the Order of the Red Banner on three separate occasions (1920, 1922, and 1928) and the Order of Lenin in 1936. == References == ==Further reading== * John Earl Haynes and Harvey Klehr, Venona: Decoding Soviet Espionage in America.

The San Gabriel River is formed in Georgetown, Texas by the confluence of the North Fork San Gabriel and the South Fork San Gabriel, both of which originate in Burnet County. There are two major impoundments of the river: Lake Georgetown along the North Fork, and Granger Lake, about 25 miles (40 km) below the confluence. Both are U.S. Army Corps of Engineers impoundments. The San Gabriel River joins the Little River five miles south of Cameron which then meets the Brazos River northwest of College Station. There is a city park in Georgetown at the confluence of the North and South Forks, with a well-known local swimming spot (the \\"Blue Hole\\") located just upriver from the confluence on the South Fork. Like most Texas Hill Country rivers, the San Gabriel west of the Balcones Fault is characterized by limestone river bottoms, some moderate rapids, small canyons, and muddy bottoms along slower-moving stretches; east of the Balcones Fault, the San Gabriel flows through the Blackland Prairie where rock features at the surface are more rare and the deep, clay soils are rolling to level and support dryland farms and more lush pastures than the thin soils to the west. Given the past tendency toward periodic large-scale but short-lived floods before construction of the large impoundments, much of the bottomland along the river banks east of Georgetown is forested with a mix of native oak and pecan plus other varieties, though in some locations pecan orchards with grafted varieties have been established as commercial enterprises. Recreational activities include canoeing, kayaking, and fishing. Typical fish species found in the river are catfish, largemouth bass, sunfish, carp, longnose gar, and various species of bait fish. However, many game fish and introduced species are found in the impoundments at Lake Georgetown and Granger Lake. The river runs through the Apache Pass Amphitheater and Festival Grounds near Thorndale, south of the town of San Gabriel. Apache Pass features a cantilevered stage that projects out over the river and is used for major concerts and other events.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on November 6, 1994. The plot of the episode follows the secret romance of Bart and Jessica Lovejoy, Reverend Lovejoy's daughter. Bart tries to end the romance when he discovers that, behind her innocent façade as a preacher's kid, she is an even bigger troublemaker than he is. Jessica then steals the money from the church collection plate, leaving Bart to take the blame until Lisa exposes the truth. The episode was written by Jonathan Collier and directed by Susie Dietter. Show runner David Mirkin originally came up with the idea of Bart having a girlfriend that was more evil than he was. Meryl Streep guest stars in the episode as Jessica Lovejoy. It features cultural references to films such as Planet of the Apes and The Silence of the Lambs. Since airing, the episode has received acclaim from both critics and fans, and Entertainment Weekly named Meryl Streep's role as one of the best guest appearances on The Simpsons. ==Plot== During a church sermon, Bart falls in love with Reverend Lovejoy's daughter, Jessica. When he approaches her, she ignores him. Bart attends Sunday school the next week to convince Jessica that he is a saint, but she still ignores him. Frustrated, Bart plays a prank on Groundskeeper Willie and is punished with detention. Jessica expresses sympathy for Bart and invites him to her house for dinner. During dinner with the Lovejoys, Bart's crude manner and foul language cause Reverend Lovejoy to forbid him from ever seeing Jessica again. She and Bart secretly date, bonding over their shared love of mischief while vandalizing the town. When Bart realizes that Jessica is more badly behaved than he is, he tries to reform her at the next church service. Undeterred, Jessica empties the money from the collection plate into her purse and abruptly leaves after forcing the empty plate into Bart's lap. The congregation mistakenly believes that Bart took the money when Helen Lovejoy calls their attention to the empty plate. Homer assumes Bart is guilty, but Marge believes he is innocent. Reluctant to implicate Jessica, Bart visits her the next day and admits he does not like her after she refuses to confess. Upon learning the truth, Lisa is determined not to allow her brother to be blamed for something he did not do. She tells the congregation that Jessica is the guilty party. The townspeople search Jessica's room and find the money hidden under her bed. Jessica is punished by being forced to scrub the church steps, and Bart receives an apology from the congregation. Later, Bart approaches Jessica at church and tells her what lesson he has learned. Jessica replies she has learned that she can make boys do whatever she wants. Bart agrees to finish scrubbing the steps for her as she leaves with her new boyfriend, but he vows to do a poor job to get even with her. ==Production== \\"Bart's Girlfriend\\" was written by Jonathan Collier and directed by Susie Dietter. David Mirkin, who was show runner at the time, originally had the idea of Bart having a girlfriend that was more evil than he was. Mirkin gave the idea to Collier to write it with the help of the show's executive producer James L. Brooks. Collier said later that he thought it was a case of Brooks coming up with good ideas and him \\"giggling obsequiously\\". The idea for the ending of the episode was to have none of the characters learn anything from the experience. Meryl Streep guest starred in the episode as Jessica Lovejoy. Matt Groening, the creator of The Simpsons, felt that Jessica Lovejoy was hard to draw in his own style but at the same time make her attractive. Julie Kavner, who provides the voice of Marge Simpson on the show, was particularly impressed by the eyes. Jessica was made the Reverend's daughter to give the impression that she was good at first and then to show that she was rebelling against the righteousness of her family. In the scene where Bart talks to Jessica outside her house, her baton playing was in the script but the exact choreography was not. Dietter liked its incorporation because it gave Jessica something else, other than Bart, to pay attention to. This was also done in the final scene when Jessica scrubs the church steps and plays with the scrub brush. Academy Award winning actress Meryl Streep was called in to do the voice of Jessica. Nancy Cartwright, who provides the voice of Bart Simpson on the show, was a huge fan of Streep and she assumed that Streep would record her lines individually, but all of their recordings were done together. Streep showed up alone with no entourage at the Village Recorder in West Los Angeles at 2:30 p.m., where she recorded her parts with Cartwright. Streep was continually doing many different versions of her lines. Mirkin felt she was easy to work with because she was versatile and keen to do a lot of different things, and as Mirkin expressed it, \\"easily evil\\". Cartwright said in an interview with The Pantagraph that she really wanted Streep's autograph, but was afraid to ask for it. After the recording session, Streep tapped Cartwright on the shoulder, and said her kids were big The Simpsons fans and that she would be in \\"big trouble\\" if she did not get Cartwright's autograph. When Homer is musing over Bart's first date, he begins to sing \\"Sunrise, Sunset\\" from Fiddler on the Roof, before moving on to \\"Cat's in the Cradle\\", and then \\"Yes, We Have No Bananas\\". The joke was very expensive for the writers to put in because they had to pay thousands of dollars for the rights to use the songs on the show. \\"Bart's Girlfriend\\" originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on November 6, 1994. The episode was selected for release in a 2001 video collection of selected episodes titled: The Simpsons – Love, Springfield Style. Other episodes included in the collection set were \\"It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad Marge\\", \\"The Two Mrs. Nahasapeemapetilons\\", and \\"I'm with Cupid\\". The episode was included in The Simpsons season 6 DVD set, which was released on August 16, 2005, as The Simpsons – The Complete Sixth Season. ==Cultural references== In the beginning of the episode, the parents chase the children in a cornfield to eventually round them up for church, which parodies a similar scene from the 1968 film Planet of the Apes, where the humans are rounded up by apes. As Bart sits in church playing with his Troll Doll, he sings a parodied version of Soul Man (popularised by Sam & Dave). After Bart is accused of stealing from the church collection plate, he is forced to wear a straitjacket in church, which is a reference to Hannibal Lecter's straitjacket in The Silence of the Lambs. \\"Misirlou\\", the theme song of the 1994 film Pulp Fiction, plays during Bart and Jessica's date. Bart calls Jessica \\"smart, beautiful and a liar...\\" and then claims she is \\"...so much better than that Sarah, plain and tall\\". The scene then cuts to a shot of a plain and tall girl named Sarah that overhears Bart and begins to cry. The Lovejoy family has a replica of Leonardo da Vinci's painting The Last Supper hanging on the wall in their dining room. The sign on the Springfield Church marquee reads: \\"Evil Women in History: From Jezebel to Janet Reno\\". ==Reception== In its original broadcast, \\"Bart's Girlfriend\\" finished 53rd in the ratings for the week of October 31 to November 6, 1994, with a Nielsen rating of 9.6. Retrieved on October 17, 2008. The episode was the third highest rated show on the Fox network that week, beaten only by Beverly Hills, 90210, and Married... with Children. Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, the authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, said: \\"Poor Bart gets picked on very cruelly by Jessica in a cleverly drawn study of pre-pubescent love. We're very fond of the scene in which Bart leaps out of the window at the church, after which Homer cries: He's heading for the window!\\" Colin Jacobson at DVD Movie Guide said in a review of the sixth season DVD: \\"We don’t often see Bart in a sympathetic light, so shows like this one are fun. [The episode] reminds me of season four’s \\"New Kid on the Block\\" since it also featured Bart in love, though the programs differ since here the girl reciprocates. Streep does nicely as the bad kid and we get many fine moments in this memorable program.\\" TV Squad's Adam Finley said: \\"Homer and Marge remained in the background for most of this episode, with Bart and Lisa becoming the main focus. Earlier episodes seemed to focus more on the dynamics between the two siblings, and it's always a nice change of pace when the show examines their love for one another as opposed to constant rivalries. Lisa really wants to help Bart in this episode, and it's actually quite touching.\\" In a 2008 article, Entertainment Weekly named Meryl Streep's role as Jessica Lovejoy as one of the sixteen best guest appearances on The Simpsons. Total Films Nathan Ditum ranked Streep's performance as the fifth best guest appearance in the show's history, commenting that she is \\"the perfect mix of beguiling and devilish as Reverend Lovejoy’s rebellious daughter\\". David Mirkin told the Daily News of Los Angeles that \\"Bart's Girlfriend\\" and \\"Homer the Great\\" are his favorite episodes of the season. Mirkin liked the scene where Bart is punched by Nelson at the playground because Bart takes a while to recover, which made the scene more realistic. In 1995, Nancy Cartwright told the Chicago Tribune that this episode, and \\"Lisa's Substitute\\" from season two, are her two favorite The Simpsons episodes. ==References== ==External links== *\\"Bart's Girlfriend\\" at The Simpsons.com * *\\"Bart's Girlfriend\\" at TV.com *\\"Bart's Girlfriend\\" at the Internet Movie Database Category:The Simpsons (season 6) episodes Category:1994 American television episodes ","title":"Bart's Girlfriend"},{"id":"2547451","text":"Animal Factory is a 2000 crime drama film directed by Steve Buscemi and starring Willem Dafoe, Edward Furlong, Danny Trejo, John Heard, Mickey Rourke, Tom Arnold, Seymour Cassel, Shell Galloway and Mark Boone, Jr. Set in San Quentin, the film is about life in prison. It is based on the novel of the same name by Eddie Bunker who plays the part of Buzzard in the film. ==Plot== Ron Decker, a young man convicted for drug possession, is sent to prison where veteran con Earl Copen takes Decker under his wing and introduces him into his own gang. Copen first helps out Decker when three Puerto Ricans attempt to lure him into a cell block to rape him, however Copen sees through their plans and talks to the Puerto Ricans, who quickly abandon interest in Decker. Over the next few days, Copen helps Decker out by getting him better jobs, food, and even transferring him to his own cell block. Mainly however Copen helps Decker's case and points out that under a new article passed by the legislature, a judge can modify a sentence in the first 90 days if he sees fit, so Copen (who is the assistant to the Captain of the Guards) helps write false reports and gives Decker advice to stay out of trouble, which will make Decker appear as a \\"very small threat to society\\". However, after large inmate Buck Rowan attempts to rape Decker in the bathroom, Decker stabs Rowan in a fight involving Copen, paralyzing Rowan. Rowan signs a statement claiming Decker and Copen are responsible and their cells are stripped and they are restricted to them. Because of the stabbing, Decker's attempt at a modified sentence is denied and his sentence remains five years. Meanwhile, Copen manages to get word out Rowan is \\"snitching\\", and an inmate working at the infirmary poisons Rowan's IV with cleaning fluid. The case against Copen and Decker is thrown out as the victim and main witness is dead. Shortly after their release, Copen tells Decker he plans to escape, and they plot to hide in a garbage truck and avoid being crushed by the compressor by using a bar to stop it.

The album received positive reviews from critics. ==Recording and release== Hootenanny was mostly recorded from October 1982 to January 1983 at the Stark/Mudge Mobile Unit warehouse in Brooklyn Center, Minnesota, which was described in the liner notes as \\"a warehouse in some godawful suburb north of Mpls\\". The tracks \\"Run It\\" and \\"Within Your Reach\\" were recorded at Blackberry Way, while the song \\"Treatment Bound\\" was recorded \\"in the basement\\". The album was released on April 29, 1983 by Twin/Tone Records. According to the record label, Hootenanny sold more than 38,000 vinyl copies. In 2008, The album was remastered and reissued by Rhino Entertainment, containing seven additional tracks. ==Music and lyrics== Hootenanny is often regarded as the first release on which The Replacements began to branch out from the \\"breakneck punk\\" that characterized their earlier work, through the incorporation of various genres such as blues, country, rockabilly, and boogie. The opening track \\"Hootenanny\\" features a rearranged lineup of Chris Mars on lead guitar, Tommy Stinson on rhythm guitar, Bob Stinson on bass guitar, and Paul Westerberg on drums and vocals, while \\"Within Your Reach\\" features Westerberg on all instruments and vocals. The lyrics for the song \\"Lovelines\\" were largely taken verbatim from the classifieds section of an issue of City Pages, a Minneapolis newspaper. The surf-instrumental \\"Buck Hill\\" takes its name from a small skiing area in Burnsville, Minnesota, just a few miles south of Minneapolis. \\"Mr. Whirly\\" is a parody of the Beatles track \\"Oh! Darling\\" (with the opening bars of \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\") and bears the writing credit \\"mostly stolen\\" on the record label. ==Critical reception== Hootenanny received positive reviews from critics. The album was ranked number 30 in The Village Voices 1983 Pazz & Jop critics' poll. In a retrospective review, Noel Murray of The A.V. Club felt that Hootenanny \\"brims with personality, and though The Replacements' real masterpieces were ahead of them, their second LP was a deck-clearer that gave Westerberg the confidence to mature.

Ignite actively supports, and has given proceeds to, organizations such as Earth First, Doctors Without Borders, Sea Shepherd, and Pacific Wildlife. Lead singer Zoltán \\"Zoli\\" Téglás has taken account of such issues as environmental concerns and vegetarianism—common topics found on A Place Called Home.

It is located 42 kilometers north of Munnar on SH 17 connecting Munnar with Udumalpet, Tamil Nadu. Marayur is the only place in Kerala that has natural sandalwood forests. Ancient dolmens and rock paintings in Marayur date back to the Stone Age. In 1991 Marayur had a population of 9,590. ==History== Marayur claims to be a part of a Stone Age civilization that is as old as 10,000 B.C. It is also home to a later period of large-scale dolmen-building. People migrated from Tamil Nadu to this area when the Madurai king Thirumalainaicker was defeated by Tippu Sultan, in the eighteenth century CE. The migrants created five villages, being Kanthalloor, Keezhanthur, Karayur, Marayur and Kottakudi. These villages were called the \\"Anju nadu\\", literally meaning \\"five lands\\". ===Megalithic Dolmens=== Dolmens of Marayur Also called Muniyaras, these dolmens belong to the Iron Age. These dolmenoids were burial chambers made of four stones placed on edge and covered by a fifth stone called the cap stone. Some of these Dolmenoids contain several burial chambers, while others have a quadrangle scooped out in laterite and lined on the sides with granite slabs. These are also covered with cap stones. Dozens of Dolmens around the area of old Siva temple (Thenkasinathan Temple) at Kovilkadavu on the banks of the River Pambar and also around the area called Pius nagar, and rock paintings on the south-western slope of the plateau overlooking the river have attracted visitors. Apart from the dolmens of Stone Age, several dolmens of Iron Age exist in this region especially on the left side of river Pambar as is evident from the usage of neatly dressed granite slabs for the dolmens. At least one of them has a perfectly circular hole of 28 cm diameter inside the underground chamber. This region has several types of dolmens. Large number of them are overground with about 70–90 cm height. Another type has a height 140–170 cm. There is an overground dolmen with double length up to 350 cm. Fragments of burial urns are also available in the region near the dolmens. This indicates that the dolmens with 70–90 cm height were used for burial of the remains of people of high social status. Burial urns were used for the burial of the remains of commoners. The dolmens with raised roofs might have been used for habitation of people. Why some people lived in the cemeteries has not been satisfactorily explained. ===Rock paintings=== A rock painting at Marayoor Ancient rock paintings are part of Marayur heritage at Attala, Ezhuthu Guha (literally means \\"cave of writing\\"), Kovilkadavu and Manala in Marayur panchayat. Attala is situated in the west part of Marayur Township and more than 90 painted motifs can be seen here. The rock paintings of Attala are situated in a colossal east facing rock shelter 1500 meters above mean sea level. Most of the paintings at Attala are abstract designs except for a few human and animal figures. Ezhuthu Guha rock paintings are sited in the Koodakavu Sandalwood Reserve Forest at Marayur in the Marayur Panchayat at an elevation of 1000 meters above mean sea level. More or less 90 painted motifs can be seen here. However, as the place is the most famous rock art site in Kerala, it attracts a large number of visitors and has been extensively vandalized since it was brought to wide public attention. Kovilkadavu is less than five kilometers from Marayur town and the place is famous for Neolithic dolmens and rock paintings. Ten 10 painted motifs are located on the south- western slope of the plateau overlooking the Pambar river. There is a rock painting at Manala in Chinnar Wildlife Sanctuary of Marayur near the Alampetty tribal settlement. Here, a picture of a deer and a man can be seen. In close proximity to this art site, a new rock painting has been newly discovered. ==Topography and Climate== Karimutty waterfalls near Marayoor The terrain is highly undulating with altitudes ranging from 500 m at Chinnar to over 2300 m at Nandala malai, and the same varying topography of Marayur can be observed in Marayur with mountains, rain forests, deciduous forests, riparian forests, scrub forests, brooks, Paddy Fields, river, waterfalls, rocky hills, sholas and hamlets. Natural vegetation includes tropical evergreen forests and grasslands. Soil type is forest loam with a high organic matter content. The climate in Marayur is characterized by mild wet winters and hot dry summers. Temperature in winter (November to January) may go down to 20 degrees Celsius and in summer it may go up to 36.2 degrees Celsius. Marayur winter is not frigid cold as considerable sunshine is also characteristic to this region even during rainy winter. Summer is humid and hot with blazing sun. Generally Marayur experience a moderate climate, temperatures varying 21 °C to 27 °C with minimum seasonal variation except in winter. The plains are generally warm but the higher altitudes are cool. The annual rainfall in Idukki district varies from 250 to 425 cm. However, it is also recorded that the annual rainfall had gone up to 700 cm in certain years. The Eastern and North-Eastern regions of the district get very low rainfall in contrast to other areas. This may go up to 150 cm at Marayur, Kanthalloor, Vattavada and Thalayar regions. Marayur and Kanthalloor are virtually rain shadow areas, lying in the eastern side of the Western Ghats. ==Flora and fauna== Walkway through the sandalwood forest Marayur has more than 1000 species of flowering plants and is a well known repository of medicinal plants. There are 114 endemic species and the sighting of Aibizia lathamii, a critically endangered tree, was recently reported from the dry forests. Chinnar - the wildlife sanctuary in Marayur - has recorded the largest number of reptilian species, including the mugger crocodile, in Kerala. With 225 recorded species of birds, it is one of the richest areas of south India in avian diversity. The forests in Marayur preserve a population of the endangered Grizzled Giant Squirrel. The rare white bison has been recently reported in Chinnar wildlife sanctuary. Other important mammals found are elephant, tiger, leopard, guar, sambar, spotted deer, Nilgiri thar, common langur, bonnet macaque etc. The phenomenon of butterfly migration occurs in between the monsoons. Maryoor contains a number of sandalwood forests, and is the only place in Kerala where natural sandalwood forest is present. Processing of sandalwood and its associated oil forms part of local economy, a depot near Marayur town supporting this industry. Sandal wood or Santalum album is a parasitic tree having a fragrant and close-grained yellowish heartwood. Sandalwood oil, also known as 'liquid gold,’ is extracted from the roots and wood of sandalwood. This oil is a costly item marketed at a few choosy outlets all over the state. A climate with low rainfall is suitable for the growth of choice sandalwood trees from which good quality oil can be extracted. The 93 km² Marayur reserve forest is believed to have about sixty thousand naturally grown sandalwood trees, of which nearly 2,000 trees had been allegedly plundered in just one year since January 2004, when the last survey was conducted. The auction rate for first quality Marayur sandal is quoted at per kg, according to forest department sources (2004). == References == Category:Cities and towns in Idukki district Category:Hill stations in Kerala Category:Tourist attractions in Idukki district Category:Mountains of Kerala ","title":"Marayur"},{"id":"2547492","text":"Bois d'arc (Maclura pomifera) is a species of small tree also known as the Osage-orange.

The film is about a jazz saxophone player whose life is transformed after being shot. After discovering a mysterious stone, he meets and falls in love with a beautiful aspiring actress, but their happiness is cut short by a series of strange, dreamlike events. The film was screened in the Un Certain Regard section at the 1998 Cannes Film Festival. ==Plot== Jazz saxophone player Izzy Maurer (Harvey Keitel) is shot in the chest during a performance at a jazz club by a deranged man. Izzy survives the seven-hour operation, but loses his left lung, ending his music career. A young aspiring actress named Celia Burns (Mira Sorvino) walks into the Chez Pierre restaurant in New York City where she works as a waitress. She and her boss talk about the shooting. Later she purchases Izzy's latest CD. Following his recovery, Izzy stays to himself and avoids his friends. Gradually he ventures outside and adapts to his new life. His former girlfriend Hannah (Gina Gershon) invites him to a dinner attended by a retired famous actress, Catherine Moore (Vanessa Redgrave), who is now a successful film director, and her film producer friend, Philip Kleinman (Mandy Patinkin). For the first time in a long time he has a good time. Catherine is looking for a young actress to play the part of \\"Lula\\" in her upcoming film version of Pandora's Box. Walking home that night Izzy discovers a dead body, finds a bag lying nearby, and rushes home in fear. Later he examines the contents of the bag and finds a small box containing a stone with a red mark. As he examines the stone he hears voices speaking in foreign tongues. That night, as he lay awake in bed, the stone emits a strange blue light and elevates above the nightstand. The next morning he calls the number written on a napkin he found in the bag and Celia picks up the phone just as she's listening to Izzy's CD. He asks to meet, and she invites him over. When he arrives he demands to know what she knows about the dead man, Stanley Mar (Greg Johnson), and the strange rock. He turns out the lights and shows her the rock's mysterious blue light. Drawn to the rock, Celia touches it and encourages him to touch it too. \\"It's the best thing, it really is. It's like nothing else,\\" she says. They feel elated by the experience, which makes them feel more connected to everything around them. He tells her, \\"The way I feel now, I could spend the rest of my life with you.\\" After he leaves, Celia runs after him and invites him back to her apartment where they make love. In the coming days, they fall deeply in love. She gets him a job at her restaurant, but when a customer comes on to her, Izzy causes a scene and they both get fired. Celia is up for a part in Catherine's film, Pandorah's Box, and with Izzy's help and connections, she gets the part of Lulu. Izzy plans to meet Celia in Dublin, where the film is being shot. Shortly after she leaves, Izzy is attacked by men in his apartment demanding to know why he killed Stanley Mar. He is taken away and held prisoner. He meets a mysterious Dr. Van Horn (Willem Dafoe) who tells Izzy how disappointed he is in him. Izzy has no idea what he's talking about, but Van Horn seems to know details about Izzy's past—his real name, childhood incidents, and catching fireflies with his brother at their summer house on Echo Lake. When Van Horn begins to delve into Izzy's relationships with his father and brother, Izzy responds, \\"Don't do this to me.\\" When reminded that he refused to play music at his father's funeral, he breaks down in tears. One night, Van Horn storms into Izzy's cell and tell him, \\"You're not worthy. You've lived a bad dishonest life.\\" Having learned about Celia, Van horn now demands that Izzy reveal her whereabouts. Izzy refuses to acknowledge that he even knows her. As he leaves, Van Horn says, \\"May God have mercy on your soul.\\" Meanwhile, Celia is unable to reach Izzy and she suspects that something is very wrong. She fears that Izzy has abandoned her. One night she takes out the rock and the blue light appears, but now it only produces in her an overwhelming sadness. Distressed, Lulu takes the rock and walks to Ha'penny Bridge, where she drops the stone into the dark river below. The following day, Van Horn and his men find Celia in Dublin and attempt to kidnap her. They chase her through the streets to Ha'penny Bridge where she had dropped the stone. As they close in, she jumps into the river. Back in New York, Izzy finally manages to escape his prison. He learns from the producer of Celia's disappearance and nearly collapses. The producer gives him a videotape of some of Celia's scenes. Later at a jazz club, he asks his friends, \\"Am I a good person or a bad person?\\" Back at his apartment he watches the videotape of Celia and weeps. After being shot at the jazz club by the deranged man, Izzy is taken away in an ambulance. On the way to the hospital, his heart stops and Izzy Maurer dies, just as the ambulance passes a young aspiring actress named Celia Burns. She sees the ambulance pass and makes the sign of the cross. ==Cast== * Harvey Keitel as Izzy Maurer * Mira Sorvino as Celia Burns * Willem Dafoe as Dr. Van Horn * Gina Gershon as Hannah * Vanessa Redgrave as Catherine Moore * Mandy Patinkin as Philip Kleinman * Richard Edson as Dave Reilly * Don Byron as Tyrone Lord * Kevin Corrigan as Man With Gun * Victor Argo as Pierre * Peggy Gormley as Dr. Fisher * Harold Perrineau as Bobby Perez * Sophie Auster as Sonia Kleinman * Greg Johnson as Stanley Mar * David Byrne as 'Laughing Man' Escort * Lou Reed as 'Not Lou Reed' * Holly Buczek as Dying Girl * Slava Schoot as Russian Thug * Henry Yuk as Chinese Thug * Fred Norris as German Thug * Brian McGuinness as Pursuer #1 * Neil Donovan as Pursuer #2 * Socorro Santiago as Paramedic #1 * O.L.

The villages lies to the east of Downpatrick and has strong links with Saint Patrick. It is claimed that when Saint Patrick arrived in Ireland in 432, strong currents swept his boat through the Strangford Lough tidal narrows and he landed where the Slaney River flows into the lough. The local chieftain, Dichu, was converted and gave him a barn for holding services. Allegedly, Saint Patrick died in Saul on 17 March 461 and is buried in nearby Downpatrick. The modern \\"Saint Patrick's Memorial Church\\" is built on the reputed spot of this building and includes a replica round tower. Saint Patrick's church is currently used for Protestant Anglican services. To the east of the parish is Saint Patrick's Catholic Church and graveyard. In the nearby Townland of Ballee, which shares a civil parish with Saul, there is a Non-Subscribing Presbyterian church and another Anglican Church. The Non-Subscribing Presbyterian Church Hall is also often used for cross-community youth groups such as Cappa Autism. Close by, on the crest of Slieve Patrick is a massive statue of Saint Patrick with bronze panels showing scenes from his life. Many local families are named on crosses leading towards the statue who have donated to the cause, both Catholic and Protestant. The Barn is a long established pub and restaurant which has had a number of owners and names including the Countryside Inn and Saul Tavern. Saul has expanded closer into Downpatrick with new estates being built such as Saul Meadows, Saul Acres and Saul Manor.

The Epitome is a brief and concise presentation of the Formula's twelve articles; the Solid Declaration a detailed exposition. Approved doctrine is presented in \\"theses\\"; rejected doctrine in \\"antitheses.\\" As the original document was written in German, a Latin translation was prepared for the Latin edition of the Book of Concord published in 1584. == Significance and composition == The promulgation and subscription of this document was a major factor in the unification and preservation of Lutheranism. It was instigated at the behest of the Elector August of Saxony, and it was the joint work of a group of Lutheran theologians and churchmen of the latter sixteenth century. They met from April 9 to June 7, 1576 in Torgau, the seat of government of the Electorate of Saxony at the time. They were Jakob Andreä (1528-90), Martin Chemnitz (1522-86), Nikolaus Selnecker (1528-92), David Chytraeus (1531-1600), Andreas Musculus (1514-81), Christoph Körner (1518-94), Caspar Heyderich (1517-86), Paul Crell (1532-79), Maximilian Mörlin (1516-84), Wolfgang Harder (1522-1602), Daniel Gräser, Nicholas Jagenteufel (1520-83), Johannes Cornicaelius, John Schütz (1531-84), Martin Mirus (1532-93), Georg Listenius (d. 1596), and Peter Glaser (1528-83). A smaller set of this group (Andreä, Chemnitz, Selnecker, Chytraeus, Musculus, and Körner) worked on the document a year later in Bergen Abbey, near Magdeburg, both from March 1-14, and in May, 1577. The most important formulators of the Formula of Concord were Jakob Andreä and Martin Chemnitz. Having before them two earlier documents (the Swabian-Saxon Concord, drafted by Andreä in 1574 and the so-called Maulbron Formula of 1576) the first group of theologians produced the Torgau Book. Andreä condensed this into what would become known as the Epitome, the first part of the Formula of Concord. Its title as found in the 1576 first printing ran as follows: [A] Brief Summary of the articles which, controverted among the theologians of the Augsburg Confession for many years, were settled in a Christian manner at Torgau in the month of June, 1576, by the theologians which there met and subscribed. Over the eleven months following the publication of the Torgau Book, suggested emendations were sent to Andreä and Chemnitz, and further revision was deemed necessary, so the second group (Andreä, Chemnitz, Selnecker, Chytraeus, Musculus, and Körner) revised the Torgau Book into its final form, known as the Bergic Book or the Solid Declaration of the Formula of Concord. (Depending on the translation, the Solid Declaration is also known as the Thorough Declaration of the Formula of Concord.) It was presented to Elector August of Saxony on May 28, 1577. Subsequently, it was signed (subscribed to) by three electors of the Holy Roman Empire, twenty dukes and princes, twenty-four counts, four barons, thirty-five free imperial cities, and over 8,000 pastors. These constituted two-thirds of the Lutheran Church in Germany at the time. Every clergyman in the Electorate of Saxony had to either subscribe or write his objections with respect to the Formula of Concord. A rhyme was circulated [at the time]: \\"Write, dear Sir, write, that you might remain at the parish\\" (schreibt, lieber Herre, schreibt, dass Ihr bei der Pfarre bleibt). The Formula of Concord was not accepted by Lutherans in Hesse, Zweibrücken, Anhalt, Pommerania, Holstein, Denmark, Sweden, Nuremberg, Strassburg, and Magdeburg, and the government of Queen Elizabeth I of England lobbied in its German embassies to prevent acceptance of it among the German estates. == Articles of the Formula of Concord == *I.

Set on the Alaska North Slope, it features a young Inuk girl experiencing the changes forced upon her culture from outside.Honoring Alaska's Indigenous Literature. George wrote two sequels that were originally illustrated by Wendell Minor: Julie (1994), which starts 10 minutes after the first book ends, and Julie's Wolf Pack (1997), which is told from the viewpoint of the wolves. ==Background== In 1971, Jean Craighead George and her son Luke went on a trip to Barrow, Alaska, to do research on wolves for an article for Reader's Digest. As they flew into the Barrow airport, she and her son spotted a young Inuk girl on the tundra, whom her son said \\"looked awfully little to be out there by herself\\". At the Barrow Arctic Research Lab, George observed scientists who were studying wolves and attempting to break their communication code. She allegedly witnessed a man bite the wolf on the top of its nose and communicate with it in soft whimpers, and \\"the incident stayed with George\\". George herself successfully communicated with a female wolf. Upon remembering the Inuk girl walking by herself on the tundra that she and her son Luke saw on their way to Barrow, she decided to write a book about a young girl surviving on her own in the tundra by communicating with wolves. The character of Miyax/Julie is based on an Inuk woman named Julia Sebevan, who taught George \\"about the old ways of the \\". In the process of writing the novel, George went through three drafts, and used numerous titles including \\"The Voice of the Wolf\\"; \\"Wolf! Wolf?\\"; \\"Wolf Girl\\"; \\"The Cry of the Wolf\\"; and \\"Wolf Song\\". Readers and students communicated to George their desire to read more about Julie \\"several years ago\\", but George felt that she \\"did not know enough about the Eskimo culture\\". It was only after her son, Craig, moved to Alaska that George \\"felt ready\\" to write the sequel Julie. Julie's Wolf Pack was written only after George had learned more about the relationships of wolves in a pack. The story has three parts: first her present situation (Amaroq, the Wolf), then a flashback (Miyax, the Girl), and finally a return to the present (Kapugen, the Hunter). ==Plot summary== Julie/Miyax (My-yax) is an Inuk girl torn between modern Alaska and the old Inuit tradition. After her mother's death, she is raised by her father Kapugen (Kah-Pue-Jen). In his care, Miyax becomes an intelligent and observant girl at one with the Arctic tundra. Life is good until one day when Miyax is sent to live with Aunt Martha, a distant and cold woman. Soon after, her father goes out on a seal hunt and does not return. Search parties find four pieces of his boat washed ashore, but there is no sign of him. He is presumed dead. As an orphan, Miyax is never more than an unwanted guest in Aunt Martha's house. So at the age of 13, she accepts a marriage to a boy named Daniel as it will allow her to leave her aunt's house. However, she soon realizes that life with Daniel is no better if not worse than her life with Martha. Daniel has an unspecified type of intellectual disability. After being mercilessly teased by other young people about it, he becomes abusive towards Miyax and sexually assaults her. Caught in an unbearable situation, she runs away in the hope of being able to stay with her pen-pal in San Francisco, California. Miyax realizes she has no way of reaching her friend and finds herself lost in the Arctic wild with only her own strength and knowledge between her and death. She happens upon a wolf pack and is able to coexist with them. She learns to communicate with the wolves to receive food and water and over time, they become like family. When she finds a way to return to her old Inuit way of life, she is torn between the choice of staying with the wolves or going back to her home. ==Reception== The book was awarded the Newbery Medal in 1973, and was a nominee under the Children's Books category in the 1973 National Book Awards. Mary Ellen Halvorson describes the book as \\"uniquely sensitive\\" and \\"wonderfully educational\\" in a review for The Prescott Courier. The book also won the 1975 Deutscher Jugendliteraturpreis. In a retrospective essay about the Newbery Medal-winning books from 1966 to 1975, children's author John Rowe Townsend wrote, \\"The details of the girl's relationship with the wolves are totally absorbing, but as a story the book seems to me to be slightly deficient.\\" The inclusion of Julie of the Wolves in elementary school reading lists has been challenged several times due to parental concerns regarding the attempted rape of the main character. One of these incidents occurred in March 1996, when the book was removed from the sixth grade reading list in Pulaski Township, Pennsylvania, at the behest of parents who \\"complained of a graphic marital rape scene in the book\\". It is number 32 on the American Library Association list of the 100 Most Frequently Challenged Books of 1990–1999. The book has additionally been criticized for its stereotypical depiction of Inuit culture. 2003 edition cover ==Publication history== *1972, USA, Harper and Row, , Pub date 1972, Hardcover *1974, USA, HarperCollins, , Pub date February 10, 1974, Paperback *1985, USA, HarperTrophy , Pub date 1985, Paperback *1977, Canada, Fitzhenry & Whiteside, 0-88-902374-3, Pub date 1977, Paperback *1997, USA, HarperTrophy , Pub date June 6, 1997, Paperback *2003, USA, HarperTeen , Pub date September 16, 2003, Paperback Since its first publication, Julie of the Wolves has also been published in at least thirteen other languages, including Spanish, French, Arabic, Turkish, Chinese, and Japanese. ==Film, TV or theatrical adaptations== Julie of the Wolves has been adapted into a musical play, directed by Peter Dalto and written by Barbara Dana, with music by Chris Kubie and choreography by Fay Simpson. The musical stars Briana Sakamoto as Julie, and a workshop production was held on May 16, 2004, at The Northern Westchester Center for the Arts' Kaufman Theater. As of November 2005, Kubie notes on his website that \\"the journey of Julie Of The Wolves (the musical) continues as the writer Barbara Dana, prepares yet another rewrite.\\" Jean Craighead George announced in November 2007 that the book is being adapted into a film by Robert and Andy Young Productions Inc. Andy Young traveled to Nunavut in 2008 with the intention of finding a young Inuk or Inupiat to play the role of Julie, but stated in April 2008 that he was in discussion with a non-Inuk to play the role because they \\"didn't find the person that we felt was going to breathe the right kind of feeling into the story\\", and because they had resistance from would-be investors to using a first-time actress for the film. Young had also intended to shoot the film in Nunavut, but is considering shooting in Alaska because of the lack of roads joining Nunavut to Southern Canada as well as the area's \\"limited financial incentives for filmmakers from outside the territory\\". ==Notes== ==References== ==External links== * Jean Craighead George: Lesson plans for Julie of the Wolves and other books at WebEnglishTeacher.com * Jean George's Arctic Pastoral: A Reading of Julie of the Wolves Category:1972 American novels Category:American children's novels Category:Newbery Medal-winning works Category:Novels set in Alaska Category:Wolves in literature Category:Child characters in literature Category:Children's novels about animals Category:Harper & Row books Category:Inupiat Category:1972 children's books ","title":"Julie of the Wolves"},{"id":"2547529","text":"Williams Lake Indian Reserve, also called the Williams Lake Band Reservation and commonly referred to locally as the Sugarcane Reserve, aka Sugarcane or The Cane or SCB, is an Indian Reserve in British Columbia, Canada, located at the east end of Williams Lake and 12 km (~7 miles) east of the city of the same name, on the right bank of the San Jose River. and is home to the Williams Lake Indian Band.

The stress intensity factor, K, is used in fracture mechanics to predict the stress state (\\"stress intensity\\") near the tip of a crack or notch caused by a remote load or residual stresses. It is a theoretical construct usually applied to a homogeneous, linear elastic material and is useful for providing a failure criterion for brittle materials, and is a critical technique in the discipline of damage tolerance. The concept can also be applied to materials that exhibit small-scale yielding at a crack tip. The magnitude of K depends on specimen geometry, the size and location of the crack or notch, and the magnitude and the distribution of loads on the material. It can be written as: K = \\\\sigma \\\\sqrt{\\\\pi a} \\\\, f(a/W) where f(a/W) is a specimen geometry dependent function of the crack length, a, and the specimen width, W, and \\\\sigma is the applied stress. Linear elastic theory predicts that the stress distribution (\\\\sigma_{ij}) near the crack tip, in polar coordinates (r,\\\\theta) with origin at the crack tip, has the form : \\\\sigma_{ij}(r, \\\\theta) = \\\\frac {K} {\\\\sqrt{2 \\\\pi r}}\\\\,f_{ij} ( \\\\theta) + \\\\,\\\\,\\\\rm{higher\\\\, order\\\\, terms} where K is the stress intensity factor (with units of stress \\\\times length1/2) and f_{ij} is a dimensionless quantity that varies with the load and geometry. Theoretically, as r goes to 0, the stress \\\\sigma_{ij} goes to \\\\infty resulting in a stress singularity. Practically however, this relation breaks down very close to the tip (small r) because plasticity typically occurs at stresses exceeding the material's yield strength and the linear elastic solution is no longer applicable. Nonetheless, if the crack-tip plastic zone is small in comparison to the crack length, the asymptotic stress distribution near the crack tip is still applicable. == Stress intensity factors for various modes == Mode I, Mode II, and Mode III crack loading. In 1957, G. Irwin found that the stresses around a crack could be expressed in terms of a scaling factor called the stress intensity factor. He found that a crack subjected to any arbitrary loading could be resolved into three types of linearly independent cracking modes. These load types are categorized as Mode I, II, or III as shown in the figure. Mode I is an opening (tensile) mode where the crack surfaces move directly apart. Mode II is a sliding (in-plane shear) mode where the crack surfaces slide over one another in a direction perpendicular to the leading edge of the crack. Mode III is a tearing (antiplane shear) mode where the crack surfaces move relative to one another and parallel to the leading edge of the crack. Mode I is the most common load type encountered in engineering design. Different subscripts are used to designate the stress intensity factor for the three different modes. The stress intensity factor for mode I is designated K_{\\\\rm I} and applied to the crack opening mode. The mode II stress intensity factor, K_{\\\\rm II}, applies to the crack sliding mode and the mode III stress intensity factor, K_{\\\\rm III}, applies to the tearing mode.

The material is assumed to be an isotropic, homogeneous, and linear elastic. The crack has been assumed to extend along the direction of the initial crack For plane strain conditions, the equivalent relation is a little more complicated: : G_{\\\\rm I} = K_{\\\\rm I}^2\\\\left(\\\\frac{1- u^2}{E}\\\\right)\\\\, : G_{\\\\rm II} = K_{\\\\rm II}^2\\\\left(\\\\frac{1- u^2}{E}\\\\right)\\\\,. For pure mode III loading, : G_{\\\\rm III} = K_{\\\\rm III}^2\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{2\\\\mu}\\\\right) = K_{\\\\rm III}^2\\\\left(\\\\frac{1+ u}{E}\\\\right) where \\\\mu is the shear modulus. For general loading in plane strain, the linear combination holds: : G = G_{\\\\rm I} + G_{\\\\rm II} + G_{\\\\rm III}\\\\,. A similar relation is obtained for plane stress by adding the contributions for the three modes. The above relations can also be used to connect the J-integral to the stress intensity factor because : G = J = \\\\int_\\\\Gamma \\\\left(W~dx_2 - \\\\mathbf{t}\\\\cdot\\\\cfrac{\\\\partial\\\\mathbf{u}}{\\\\partial x_1}~ds\\\\right) \\\\,. ==Critical stress intensity factor == The stress intensity factor, K, is a parameter that amplifies the magnitude of the applied stress that includes the geometrical parameter Y (load type). Stress intensity in any mode situation is directly proportional to the applied load on the material. If a very sharp crack, or a V-notch can be made in a material, the minimum value of K_\\\\mathrm{I} can be empirically determined, which is the critical value of stress intensity required to propagate the crack. This critical value determined for mode I loading in plane strain is referred to as the critical fracture toughness (K_\\\\mathrm{Ic}) of the material. K_\\\\mathrm{Ic} has units of stress times the root of a distance (e.g. MN/m3/2). The units of K_\\\\mathrm{Ic} imply that the fracture stress of the material must be reached over some critical distance in order for K_\\\\mathrm{Ic} to be reached and crack propagation to occur. The Mode I critical stress intensity factor, K_\\\\mathrm{Ic}, is the most often used engineering design parameter in fracture mechanics and hence must be understood if we are to design fracture tolerant materials used in bridges, buildings, aircraft, or even bells. Polishing cannot detect a crack. Typically, if a crack can be seen it is very close to the critical stress state predicted by the stress intensity factor. === G–criterion === The G-criterion is a fracture criterion that relates the critical stress intensity factor (or fracture toughness) to the stress intensity factors for the three modes. This failure criterion is written as : K_{\\\\rm c}^2 = K_{\\\\rm I}^2 + K_{\\\\rm II}^2 + \\\\frac{E'}{2\\\\mu}\\\\,K_{\\\\rm III}^2 where K_{\\\\rm c} is the fracture toughness, E' = E/(1- u^2) for plane strain and E' = E for plane stress. The critical stress intensity factor for plane stress is often written as K_{\\\\rm c}. == Examples == === Infinite plate: Uniform uniaxial stress === { - align = \\"left\\" valign = \\"top\\"  The stress intensity factor for an assumed straight crack of length 2a perpendicular to the loading direction, in an infinite plane, having a uniform stress field \\\\sigma is : K_\\\\mathrm{I}=\\\\sigma \\\\sqrt{\\\\pi a} Crack in an infinite plate under mode I loading. } === Penny-shaped crack in an infinite domain === { - align = \\"left\\" valign = \\"top\\"  The stress intensity factor at the tip of a penny-shaped crack of radius a in an infinite domain under uniaxial tension \\\\sigma is : K_{\\\\rm I} = \\\\frac{2}{\\\\pi}\\\\sigma\\\\sqrt{\\\\pi a} \\\\,.

DNA is most commonly extracted from blood, but can also be obtained from saliva and other tissues. DNA banks allow for conservation of genetic material and comparative analysis of an individual's genetic information. Analyzing an individual's DNA can allow scientists to predict genetic disorders, as used in preventive genetics or gene therapy, and prove that person's identity, as used in the criminal justice system. There are multiple methods for testing and analyzing genetic information including restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and polymerase chain reactions (PCR). ==Uses== DNA banking is used to conserve genetic material, especially that of organisms that face extinction. This is a more prominent issue today due to deforestation and climate change, which serve as a threat to biodiversity. The genetic information can be stored within lambda phage and plasma vectors. The National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences (NIAS) DNA Bank, for example, collects the DNA of agricultural organisms, such as rice and fish, for scientific research. Most DNA provided by DNA banks is used for studies to attempt to develop more productive or more environmentally friendly agricultural species. Some DNA banks also store the DNA of rare or endangered species to ensure their survival.Meurant, Gerard (2012). Conservation of Plant Genes : Dna Banking and in Vitro Biotechnology. The DNA bank can be used to compare and analyze DNA samples. Comparison of DNA samples allowed scientists to work on the Human Genome Project, which maps out many of the genes on human DNA. It has also led to the development of preventive genetics. Samples from the DNA bank have been used to identify patterns and determine which genes lead to specific disorders. Once people know which genes lead to disorders, people can take steps to lessen the effects of that disorder. This can occur through adjustments in lifestyle, as demonstrated in preventive healthcare, or even through gene therapy. DNA can be banked at any time during a person's life.Stewart, A. (2007). Genetics, health care, and public policy: An introduction to public health genetics. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press. DNA banks were introduced to the criminal justice system in the 1980s. This system makes it possible to rule out or confirm the verdict of a suspect based on their personal genetic code. Once an individual’s DNA is stored, it remains in the system permanently; allowing law enforcement to identify and track criminals more easily. There is some controversy about this topic as some individuals believe the storage of citizen's DNA is an invasion of privacy.Krimsky, S., & Simoncelli, T. (2011). Genetic justice: DNA data banks, criminal investigations, and civil liberties. New York: Columbia University Press. DNA banking capsules are also starting to be used for retaining the DNA of the deceased, a service offered by some funeral homes. ==Processes== Scientists are capable of retrieving genetic information from hair, skin, blood, sperm, tissue, and saliva as long as the sample contains intact DNA. Nucleotide sequences between humans differ by only 0.1%. Even so, this 0.1% includes approximately three million bases. DNA can be analyzed through restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and Polymerase chain reactions (PCR). The RFLP process was introduced in 1988. Restriction enzymes digest portions of the DNA, leaving short fragments. These fragments are sorted through gel electrophoresis. The gel demonstrates the length of the fragments allowing specialists to determine whether the fragments came from the same person. PCR is more commonly used today because it more efficient and requires smaller samples of genetic samples.Stewart, A. (2007). Genetics, health care, and public policy: An introduction to public health genetics. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press. ==Organizations== There are various organizations founded for the purpose of storing and analyzing DNA sample. For example; The UK Biobank contains DNA samples of 500,000 individuals aged between 40 and 69 when their samples were taken in the years 2006-2010 . The Human DNA Bank India at Lucknow city, the Asia's first Human DNA Bank takes the DNA of common public, stores it for 50 years, takes their biometrics as well and provide them a UID DNA card. This system is an absolute mean of identity and is very helpful for the concerned associations in many conditions like identification at any mass gathering, identification at any massive calamity, identification at terrorist attacks, identification of any individual even if he/she is hiding his/her real identity. The director Dr. Saeed Ahmad has established Asia's first human DNA bank in India and has been well known throughout the world for his work on DNA. Under IQRA Biotech Services this human DNA bank which is in public-privet-partnership with Biotech Park, Lucknow under the Department of Biotechnology and the Ministry of Science and Technology. IQRA Biotech Services has also established a cord blood and stem cell bank that stores the stem cells of their clients and in future it is possible that these stem cells may be used for genetic treatments of diseases like spinal cord injuries, neuralgic palsy, leukemia, Parkinson's disease, anemia, SCIA, and cancer. ==See also== * DNA database ==References== ==External links== * List of DNA banks by Global Genome Biodiversity Network * NIAS DNA bank * RBG Kew DNA bank * DNA Bank Network * DNA Stewardship Category:Conservation biology Category:Molecular biology Category:Biorepositories ","title":"DNA bank"},{"id":"2547565","text":"Salem Willows Park Salem Neck is a peninsula in northeastern Salem, Massachusetts, in the United States.

Eulenburg played an important role in the rise of Bernhard von Bülow, but fell from power in 1907 due to the Harden–Eulenburg affair when he was accused of homosexuality. ==Early life== Eulenburg was born at Königsberg, Province of Prussia, the eldest son of Philipp Konrad, Count zu Eulenburg (Königsberg, 24 April 1820 – Berlin, 5 March 1889) and his wife, Baroness Alexandrine von Rothkirch und Panthen (Glogau, 20 June 1824 – Meran, 11 April 1902).Röhl, John The Kaiser and His Court, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994 page 29. The Eulenburgs were a Junker family which belonged to Germany's Uradel (ancient nobility) class as they were first recorded as Ministeriales of Saxony in the service of the Margraves of Meissen in 1181, they acquired lordships in Meissen, Bohemia and Lusatia before migrating to Prussia in the 14th century, there being recognized as barons in 1709 and counts by 1786.Genealogisches Handbuch des Adels, Fürstliche Häuser VI. \\"Eulenburg\\". C.A. Starke Verlag, 1961, pp. 433-435. (French). For generations the family had served the House of Hohenzollern; Philipp's uncle Friedrich Albrecht zu Eulenburg served as Interior Minister of Prussia, as did his cousin Botho zu Eulenburg. The Eulenburgs, though \\"Junkers\\", were impoverished aristocracy and until 1867 depended entirely upon Philipp von Eulenburg's salary as a captain in the Prussian Army.Röhl, John The Kaiser and His Court, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994 page 30. In 1867 Baron Karl von Hertefeld died without any children or surviving siblings, and in his will left his entire fortune and two gigantic estates at Liebenberg and Hertefeld to his favorite niece, Eulenburg's mother. At one stroke, the Eulenburgs become one of the richest families in Prussia, but Captain von Eulenburg was unable to overcome his long years in poverty, and he had a miserly attitude to spending money. Eulenburg had difficult relations with his father, but was extremely close to his artistic mother. She was a great piano-player, and frequently invited over Cosima von Bülow to play the piano for her.Röhl, John The Kaiser and His Court, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994 page 33. Cosima von Bülow in turn became first the mistress and then the wife of the composer Richard Wagner. Through this family connection, Eulenburg was close to the Wagner family and a member of the Bayreuth Circle that existed to further the Wagner cult. Eulenburg was educated at a French grammar school in Berlin before being educated by a tutor from 1859 onwards. Starting in 1863, he attended the Vitzhumsches Gymnasium in Dresden, Saxony. In 1866 the Austro-Prussian War forced him to leave Saxony, which was now enemy territory. Though he did not relish a military career, he joined the Prussian Gardes du Corps as an officer cadet in accordance with his father's wishes. He then attended the War Academy at Kassel from which he graduated in 1868. During his time at the War Academy, Eulenburg become very close to Count Kuno von Moltke, who would also be exposed as homosexual in the 1907 scandal. In 1867 Eulenburg was promoted to the rank of lieutenant before resigning his commission in 1869 in order to pursue an education in the law. When France declared war on Prussia in July 1870, Eulenburg rejoined the Prussian Army.Röhl, John The Kaiser and His Court, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994 page 31. During the Franco- German War of 1870-1871 he served under the German military governor of Strasbourg and received the Iron Cross. In October 1871, Eulenburg again resigned from the army to resume his legal studies. After the Franco-Prussian War, Eulenburg travelled for a year in the Orient as the Middle East was then called, a trip which ended when Eulenburg contracted typhus in Egypt. From 1872 to 1875, he attended the University of Leipzig and the University of Strasbourg studying the law. While a student at Leipzig, Eulenburg befriended Baron Axel \\"Dachs\\" von Varnbüler, who was to become one of Eulenburg's most important friends. Varnbüler would later recall that Eulenburg was one of the most accomplished students at the university, being “the most versatile, easily the most brilliant and therefore the leading spirit” on the campus. In 1875 Eulenburg received a Doctor of Jurisprudence degree from the University of Giessen. After graduating magna cum laude, Eulenburg went to Stockholm to marry a wealthy Swedish aristocrat, Augusta Sandels, whom he had been courting via a series of love letters for some time. During this time, Eulenburg became very close to the French diplomat, writer and racist Count Arthur de Gobineau, whom Eulenburg was later to call his “unforgettable friend”.Röhl, John The Kaiser and His Court, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994 pages 33 & 54. Eulenburg, who was fluent in French, was deeply impressed by Gobineau's book An Essay on the Inequality of the Human Races, where Gobineau expounded the theory of an Aryan master-race and maintained that the people who had best preserved Aryan blood were the Germans. A snob who held commoners in contempt, Gobineau believed that French aristocrats like himself were descendants of the Germanic Franks who had conquered the Roman province of Gaul in the 5th century, whereas ordinary French people were descendants of Latin and Celtic peoples. Though domestic French political considerations led Gobineau to claim that the Germans were the best Aryans, this thesis ensured that the book had a favorable reception in Germany. Eulenburg sought out Gobineau to personally thank him for his book, and a friendship between the two men blossomed as a result. Eulenburg first met Gobineau in Stockholm in 1874, and the two immediately struck it off.Domeier, Norman The Eulenburg Affair: A Cultural History of Politics in the German Empire, Rochester: Boydell & Brewer, 2015 page 171. Eulenburg was later to fondly recall how he and Gobineau had spent hours during their time in Sweden under the \\"Nordic sky, where the old world of the gods lived on in the customs and habits of the people as well in their hearts.\\" Gobineau in turn was later to write that only two people in the entire world had ever properly understood his racist philosophy, namely Richard Wagner and Eulenburg. Gobineau encouraged Eulenburg to promote his theory of an Aryan master-race, telling him: \\"In this way you will help many people understand things sooner\\". The American historian Gregory Blue wrote of an \\"Eulenburg connection\\" in promoting anti-Asian racism, observing much of Eulenburg's \\"Yellow Peril\\" seemed to be taken straight from Gobineau's anti- Asian writings.Blue, Gregory \\"Gobineau on China: Race Theory, the \\"Yellow Peril,\\" and the Critique of Modernity\\" pages 93–139 from Journal of World History Volume 10, Issue No. 1, (Spring 1999) pages 128–129 Eulenburg needed no encouragement and spent the rest of his life promoting racist and anti- Semitic views, writing in his 1906 book Eine Erinneruung an Graf Arthur de Gobineau (A Memoir of Count Arthur de Gobineau) that Gobineau was a prophet who showed Germany the way forward to national greatness in the 20th century. In 1885, when the editor of the Bayreuther Blätter, the official newspaper of the Wagner cult, wrote to Eulenburg asking that he allow his letters to Gobineau to be published in the newspaper, Eulenburg wrote back to say that he could not publish his correspondence with Gobineau as their letters “…touch on so many intimate matters that I cannot extract much from them which is of general interest”.Röhl, John The Kaiser and His Court, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994 page 54. Later, Eulenburg was to complain that all of his letters to Gobineau had been destroyed because “They contain too much of an intimately personal nature”. The British historian John C. G. Röhl has written that we cannot know for certain what the Eulenburg-Gobineau letters had to say since both of them burned almost all of their correspondence, but it is possible that they had a sexual relationship that was documented in the letters and motivated their destruction. Eulenbug's politics veered to the extreme right. An ardent racist and anti-Semite, he was fascinated by the racial theories not just of Gobineau but also of Wagner and Houston Stewart Chamberlain. Like many other Prussian conservatives of his generation, Eulenburg always saw the unification of Germany in 1871 under the leadership of Prussia as a fragile achievement, and he was haunted by the prospect that German unification might be undone. Accordingly, he always argued that the Prussian state had to be ruthless when dealing with any sort of internal or external threat, and therefore Eulenburg completely rejected democracy. Eulenburg was quite open in his contempt for the “open” political systems of France and Britain, stating that a “closed” political system was much to be preferred. ==Diplomat and artist== Eulenburg joined the Prussian civil service. He served first as a judge at a lower court in Lindow, Brandenburg, before being promoted to a higher court at Neuruppin.Röhl, John The Kaiser and His Court, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994 pages 31-32. After only two years as a judge he transferred to the Auswärtiges Amt (Foreign Office). In January 1881 Eulenburg was appointed Third Secretary at the German embassy in Paris, serving under Bernhard von Bülow who was Second Secretary at the Paris embassy, who was to become another of Eulenburg's friends.Röhl, John The Kaiser and His Court, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994 page 32. Eulenburg—by all accounts an extremely sensitive man—was devastated by the death of his two-year-old daughter Astrid from diabetes on 23 March 1881, and asked to leave Paris, stating that he could not stand living in the city where his daughter had died. After only six months in Paris he was transferred to the Prussian embassy in Munich where he served seven years. Eulenburg had little interest in his job, and spent most of his time absorbed in the cultural scene in Munich. During his time in Munich, Eulenburg become convinced that he was too sensitive for a career in politics, and increasingly become interested in the arts.Röhl, John The Kaiser and His Court, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994 pages 32–33. In 1884, Eulenburg published an autobiographical story entitled “Aus der Art Eine märkische Geschichte” concerning a sensitive, artistic young man with a loving mother and a cold father who pushes the young man to pursue a military career when he really wants a career in the arts, something that his mother understands. In his letters to his mother, Eulenburg always identified his “real self” with her, whom he stated could understand him in a way that his father never could.Röhl, John The Kaiser and His Court, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994 pages 33–34. Eulenburg was later to write that of his father: “He was suffused with the prosaic ethos of Prussia, and inevitably he sought to steer me in a similar direction, when so much inspiration lay dormant in my imagination”.Röhl, John The Kaiser and His Court, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994 page 34. Of his mother, Eulenburg wrote: “My mother, whom I deeply adored, the ideal figure who filled my whole being with boundless love, fired my inspiration. Music, painting, poetry occupied her thoughts and she practised the arts with talent and with understanding, and they took full possession of me as well”. Keenly interested in music, Eulenburg enjoyed considerable success as a writer of ballads. Eulenburg wrote a series of “Nordic-mystical” ballads such as Atlantis, Gorm, Frühlinsmacht, Altnordisches Wiegendlied, Märchen von der Freiheit and Skaldengsänge. The most successful of Eulenburg's musical works were the Rose songs, what the German historian Norman Domier called a series of \\"saccharine and kitschy\\" sentimental love songs which were extremely popular with the public and sold over 500,000 copies.Domeier, Norman The Eulenburg Affair: A Cultural History of Politics in the German Empire, Rochester: Boydell & Brewer, 2015 page 170. Besides writing music, Eulenburg also worked as a playwright. His first play Margot was a success when it premiered in Munich in 1885 and his second play, Der Seestern was an even bigger success when it premiered in Berlin in 1887. === The Kaiser's great friend === On 19 April 1886, Eulenburg was invited on a hunting trip with Prince Wilhelm of Prussia (the future Wilhelm II), the eldest son of Germany's Crown Prince Friedrich, a meeting that was to change his life. Eulenburg soon became best friends with the prince (who was twelve years his junior) prior to Wilhelm's accession to the imperial throne, and were to remain so for the next 22 years. After meeting him, Eulenburg declared his “boundless love” for the prince.Röhl, John The Kaiser and His Court, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994 page 36. During this period, Eulenburg started to share his love of the occult with his new best friend. In August 1887, Eulenburg wrote to Prince Wilhelm about a séance he had recently organized, that \\"I was overjoyed that we find ourselves in agreement in this area as well, and it has shown me clearly yet again how very lucky I have been to meet Your Royal Highness! To be understood in all things so well, that is true happiness!\\".Röhl, John The Kaiser and His Court, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994 page 66. In the same letter, Eulenburg warned Wilhelm never to speak in public about their shared interest in the occult as most people would not understand it.Röhl, John The Kaiser and His Court, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994 page 67. In 1888, the old Emperor Wilhelm I died and was succeeded by his son and heir apparent. But Friedrich was already dying of throat cancer and after a reign of 99 days died, to be succeeded by his eldest, Wilhelm II. As the Emperor Friedrich III lay in his bed dying, Wilhelm demanded that he be appointed regent, a request his mother the Empress Victoria refused.Buruma, Ian Anglomania A European Love Affair, New York: Vintage Books, 1998 page 211. Wilhelm, who had always hated his parents, especially his British mother, wrote to Eulenburg that \\"the royal escutcheon had been besmirched and the Reich brought to ruin by the English princess who is my mother, that is the most horrible of all!\\". In March 1888, Eulenburg wrote to his mother: “I am very aware of the fact that it is, and always will be, a question of [for me] of either state service or art”. Upon the accession of Wilhelm to the thrones of Prussia and Germany, Eulenburg assumed an unofficial position of immense influence, and among other things, was instrumental in the appointment of Bernhard von Bülow as head of the foreign office in 1897. Wilhelm II had long desired the appointment of \\"his own Bismarck\\" – a powerful chancellor who would enact the Kaiser's will – and Eulenburg was the first to suggest Bülow for this role. In October 1888, when Wilhelm had decided to appoint Eulenburg the Prussian Ambassador to Bavaria, Eulenburg viewed the appointment as a chance to better pursue his artistic interests. In a letter to his mother, Eulenburg wrote: > “I do not let go of the thought expressed here, and in my fairly regular > letters to him [Wilhelm II] I return to it! It would be a very wonderful > thing for my future to get such an appointment. For apart from the agreeable > material aspects, I would hope that no-one would then ask more of me than > this, and I could devote myself in peace to the things to which I am really > attached.” The German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck blocked the planned appointment, writing about Eulenburg that “I like him personally; he is amiable, but politically he was little sense of what is important and what is not; he allows himself to be influenced by carping gossip, passes it on and this way needlessly puts people’s backs up”. Bismarck stated Eulenburg was acceptable as ambassador to a small, unimportant state like Oldenburg, but was “impossible” for a major state like Bavaria. Thanks to Bismarck, in November 1888 Eulenburg was appointed the Prussian ambassador to the Grand Duchy of Oldenburg instead of Bavaria as he wanted. In the fall of 1888, Bismarck wrote in a letter to his son that there were aspects to the Eulenburg-Wilhelm relationship that he did \\"not wish to commit to paper. I will not write down very much that I want to talk to you about\\".Röhl, John The Kaiser and His Court, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994 page 62. In 1888, Herbert von Bismarck wrote \\"that H.M [His Majesty] loves Ph. Eulenburg more than any other living being\\".Röhl, John The Kaiser and His Court, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994 page 61. Despite liking Eulenburg to a certain extent, Bismarck wrote with contempt that: \\"Eulenburg's projects were those of an average dilettantism. His diplomatic activities were \\"operetta politics\\" with the hastily changing plans of the romantic. What else can one expect from someone who sings?\\".Mancini, Elena Magnus Hirschfeld and the Quest for Sexual Freedom: A History of the First International Sexual Freedom Movement, London: Macmillan, 2010 page 97 Bismarck was referring to Eulenburg's love of Italianate bel canto singing; Eulenburg had by all accounts a fine singing voice, and he often entertained guests at the parties he hosted at Liebenberg with his singing. Eulenburg's distaste for politics was for openly holding political power, and he much preferred to operate behind-the-scenes to achieve his goals. Eulenburg's cultural work served as a way of promoting his brand of \\"aesthetic anti-Semitism\\" to the German middle class, a set of values and assumptions about Germans and Jews that Eulenburg wanted to see ordinary people accept. === Spiritist and conspiracy theorist === A convinced anti- Catholic bigot who saw the Catholic Church as a sinister force plotting the ruin of Protestant Prussia, Eulenburg had developed an elaborate conspiracy theory that the Archduke Franz Ferdinand was plotting to start a war against Germany when he succeeded to the Austrian throne in alliance with Russia and France. Ever since the Archduke Rudolf shot his mistress Baroness Mary Vetsera and then himself in the Mayerling Incident of 1889, Franz Ferdinand was the next in line to the Austrian throne once the old Emperor Franz Josef died. Eulenburg believed that the Mayerling incident was not a murder-suicide pact, but was rather murders by agents of the Vatican to remove Rudolf from the line of succession in favor of Franz Ferdinand, whom Eulenburg personally disliked. Eulenburg believed that the devoutly Catholic Franz Ferdinand was in his turn merely the puppet of the Vatican, and the purpose of this planned religious war was to break up Germany, and establish the supremacy of a Catholic league led by Austria and Bavaria over Prussia. Eulenburg further believed that elements of the Bavarian government and the Zentrum were also involved in this Catholic conspiracy to undo German unification. Since Germany had been unified under the leadership of Protestant Prussia in 1871, Eulenburg like many other Prussian Protestant conservatives was convinced that the Catholic Church was a malign force out to break up the unified Reich and to return Germany back to a collection of independent states as it had been before the wars of German unification. To block this alleged Catholic plot to make Bavaria “the Catholic hegemonial power”, Eulenburg required that the pro-Prussian Liberal government in Munich never fall, that the Reich government never co-operate with the Zentrum in any way or form, and that Prussian government pursue moderate conservative policies as reactionary policies would alienate the Bavarian Liberals. The paradox of Eulenburg, a man whose leanings were towards the extreme right, but who advocated moderate conservative policies were captured in an 1896 essay in which he complained that the “sorest spot of the new German Reich” was that unfortunately the “old Prussian tradition” had to adjust to “the liberalism of the German Philistine” (i.e. the middle class).Röhl, John The Kaiser and His Court, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994 page 35. Aside from the arts, Eulenburg's major interest was the occult.Röhl, John The Kaiser and His Court, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994 pages 64-65. Eulenburg—while nominally Lutheran—genuinely believed in the reality of ghosts and spirits, and spent much of his time consulting clairvoyants, mediums and spiritists in attempts to contact the spirit world.Röhl, John The Kaiser and His Court, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994 page 65. After Eulenburg moved from Munich to Oldenburg in 1888, Count Kuno Rantzau wrote: \\"I wish Eulenburg all the best, but I am heartily glad that he can now play his spiritist mumbo-jumbo in a different settling\\". In February 1889, when Eulenburg's sister wrote to him complaining his spiritualist activities were likely to embarrass the Kaiser, Eulenburg wrote back to say: \\"Your concern about the Kaiser's spiritism is quite unnecessary. When he was still Prince Wilhelm, we spoke about these matters -- just as you speak about everything to the person who is your friend. How can the Kaiser now suddenly stop talking about them?..I cannot help the fact that, by the time I got to know him, Prince Wilhelm already firmly believed in ghosts and other such things; it is a part of his mystical inclination\\". As the best friend of the new emperor and his closest advisor, many people started to court Eulenburg as a man who could bring access to the Kaiser, most importantly Friedrich von Holstein, the director of the Political Department at the Auswärtiges Amt who was determined to depose Bismarck as chancellor, and saw Eulenburg as a useful conduit to Wilhelm II. Despite his distaste for politics and his love of the arts, Eulenburg's role as Wilhelm's best friend ensured that he played a leading political role, most notably in the intrigues that brought down Bismarck in 1890. Even though Eulenburg felt he was too fragile for the world of politics, he felt obliged to become a political player out of his love for Wilhelm II. In response to a letter from Wilhelm in 1890, Eulenburg wrote: \\"Your Majesty has thrown me into transports of joy with his gracious letter with its rich contents, and I must take the greatest care to control myself so that I do not write four pages expressing my gratitude! Your Majesty knows very well -- without my saying it -- what feelings gripped me when I saw the beloved handwriting!\\". In the summer of 1889, the anti- Bismarck faction learned that the Chancellor was planning to permit the return of the Catholic Redemptorist order of monks who had been banished from Germany during the Kulturkampf. The return of the \\"Redemptorists\\" was seen as an attempt by Bismarck to break up the “Kartell” of the anti-clerical National Liberals and the Conservative parties, which would make it impossible for the government to pass bills in the Reichstag, and thereby place Wilhelm in a “position of constraint” by making Bismarck indispensable to resolve the crisis that would have been caused by the collapse of the Kartell. In fall 1889, Holstein attempted to frustrate this maneuver by having Eulenburg arrange for Wilhelm to issue a press statement in favour of the Kartell.Röhl, John The Kaiser and His Court, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994 p.37. When Bismarck ignored the press statement, Holstein had Eulenburg send two telegrams to the Kaiser, who was visiting Constantinople, which led in turn to Wilhlem sending a telegram to Bismarck on 6 November 1889 saying that “under no circumstances and in no way whatsoever can and will His Imperial Majesty permit the return of the Redemptorists to Germany”. Checked in this maneuver, Bismarck proceed to destroy the Kartell by bringing a new Anti- Socialist Bill, which led to the moderate right-of-the-center parties suffering heavy losses in the elections of 20 February 1890. With the government unable to have bills passed by the Reichstag, Bismarck then launched plans for a coup d’état with the aim of making himself dictator. Bismarck's plans threw the anti-Bismarck faction into feverish plans of their own, and on 11 March 1890 Holstein telegraphed Eulenburg that he was needed in Berlin immediately. On 14 March, Eulenburg passed on a message to Wilhelm warning him of Bismarck's plans, which led to Bismarck being replaced as chancellor on the following day. Röhl wrote that in the great crisis of March 1890, Eulenburg played the role of an emissary more than as a planner, but nonetheless he did play a key role in Bismarck's dismissal. In March 1890 Eulenburg was sent to Stuttgart as Prussian ambassador to the Kingdom of Württemberg. ==The Power Broker== In the chancellorship of General Leo von Caprivi, Eulenburg came more into his own as a political player.Röhl, John The Kaiser and His Court, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994 page 39. In April 1891 Eulenburg returned to Munich, this time as Prussian ambassador to the Kingdom of Bavaria. On 15 February 1891, Baron Karl von Dörnberg, one of Eulenburg's friends, died.Röhl, John The Kaiser and His Court, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994 page 57. After his death, Count Kuno von Moltke wrote to Axel \\"Dachs\\" von Varnbüler on 31 March 1891: > \\"My old Dachs! I am just getting ready for the journey to Stuttgart. I'm > longing for old Philine...have to see her [Eulenburg; his gay friends always > used the terms \\"her\\" and \\"she\\" to describe him] because of the feeling that > now this gap [Dörnberg's death] has opened up in our beloved circle, we must > hold on to each other doubly, more firmly...Then I'll move over to Munich > with P. on the 8th -- the family will not follow till later\\". The \\"Philine\\" of this letter is clearly Eulenburg because on 8 April 1891, Eulenburg accompanied by Moltke took a train trip from Stuttgart to Munich and on 10 April 1891 he appeared at the Bavarian court as the new Prussian envoy. After arriving in Munich, Eulenburg and Moltke went to see a clairvoyant to learn the future and improve Eulenburg's health. Moltke wrote to Varnbüler afterwards: \\"Philine writes to me that he feels absolutely dreadful -- in spite of the clairvoyante who felt him in the rectum and gave him such helpful guidelines for his behavior\\". At the same time, Eulenburg continued his efforts to involve the Kaiser in his spiritism and his attempts to contact the spirit world. On 18 November 1891, Field Marshal Alfred von Waldersee wrote in his diary: > \\"In the highest place it is believed that it is possible to rule alone, to > understand everything, to know everything best, while in reality no aim is > clearly understood, nothing is properly understood...Is that really too > bleak a view? Only today I have the learned the following for the first > time. Philipp Eulenburg was earlier strongly urged not to strengthen the > Kaiser in his spiritist leanings. During the first North Sea cruise he kept > to this, as I was able to observe in detail. Apparently things had already > changed by the time of the second cruise. During his last visit to Munich > the monarch was brought into direct contact with a female spiritist by > Eulenburg, I guess in the Legation hotel. While she was in a trance she was > asked by the Kaiser, of whose presence she was allegedly unaware, what he > was to make of a friend in Russia -- obviously an allusion to the Tsar. If > the lord can be influenced in this way, the well-being of the Fatherland > lies irretrievably in the hands of swindlers. Friedrich Wilhelm II and > Bischoffwerder!\\"Röhl, John The Kaiser and His Court, Cambridge: Cambridge > University Press, 1994 page 68. In December 1891, Eulenburg was delighted when a spiritist was apparently able to tell him of what Wilhelm had written to him in his last letter, which confirmed his belief in the power of the ghosts and spirits whose aid he sought. In January 1892, the Zentrum announced that they would vote for an Army Bill in the Reichstag, and in exchange they wanted Wilhelm as King of Prussia to bring in a School bill in Prussia favorable to Catholic education. A deal was made by Caprivi to that effect, which led to Eulenburg writing to Wilhelm on 21 January 1892 warning that relying upon a “black-blue” alliance (i.e. Zentrum-Conservative) was dangerous to the Reich, which led to Wilhelm doing a U-turn on the bargain, saying he would “never consent” to a School bill being passed in the Prussian Landtag by a “black-blue” alliance. Afterwards, Eulenburg advised Wilhelm to have the Prussian School Bill amended so it could be passed by a Conservative-National Liberal alliance by removing the clauses favourable to Catholic education it would appeal to the anti- clerical National Liberals.Röhl, John The Kaiser and His Court, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994 page 40. Eulenburg's role as the “backseat driver” of German politics led Caprivi to submit his resignation on 17 March 1892, complaining it was impossible to govern when the Kaiser's best friend had more influence on policy-making than did the Chancellor; Caprivi's resignation was refused. In July 1892, Wilhelm received a report from the American journalist-cum-German spy Poultney Bigelow that the majority of Polish aristocrats in Russian Poland would welcome a German invasion and the establishment of a German protectorate in Congress Poland.Röhl, John \\"A Document of 1892 on Germany, Prussia and Poland\\" pages 143-149 from The Historical Journal Volume 7, Issue # 1, 1964 page 147. Wilhelm welcomed Bigelow's report, which led him to comment to Eulenburg on the correctness of Caprivi's policy of allowing German Poles to study in Polish-language schools, which he believed was winning opinion in Russian Poland towards Germany. Wilhelm was then persuaded by Eulenburg that any sort of Polish state—even a German protectorate—was bound to trigger Polish nationalist feelings amongst Germany's Polish minority, and as such, not only should the Reich decline to support anti-Russian Polish nationalists, but it was best to Germanize the Polish minority within Germany.Röhl, John \\"A Document of 1892 on Germany, Prussia and Poland\\" pages 143-149 from The Historical Journal Volume 7, Issue # 1, 1964 page 148. In 1893, when the Zentrum threatened to vote against the Army Bill in the Reichstag, Holstein devised a plan where the German government would pay a bribe to Pope Leo XIII in exchange for which the Pope would order the Zentrum to vote for the Army Bill under the pain of excommunication. As Caprivi was opposed to this plan, saying it was highly dishonorable for the Reich government to engage in bribery to achieve its goals, Holstein had Eulenburg contact Wilhelm to order Caprivi to offer the bribe. Within two days, Eulenburg reported to Holstein that his efforts had paid off and the Kaiser had ordered a deeply reluctant Caprivi to offer the bribe. In December 1893 there appeared in Kladderadatsch a series of satirical poems attacking the dominant figures at the Auswärtiges Amt as \\"Oyster friend\\" (Holstein), \\"Späzle\\" (Alfred von Kiderlen-Waechter), \\"the Troubadour\\" (Eulenburg) and the mysterious \\"fourth man\\" (Varnbüler) provoked much media speculation about just who were these figures meant to be.Röhl, John The Kaiser and His Court, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994 page 42. The poems were the work of two diplomats, Bothmer and Raschdau who did not belong to the dominant faction and were frustrated that their careers were going nowhere.Röhl, John The Kaiser and His Court, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994 page 160. By early 1894, Eulenburg's power had grown to such an extent that he was no longer acting just as an ally to Holstein, but had sufficient power to start acting as a power broker on his own who could overrule Holstein when he felt fit.Röhl, John The Kaiser and His Court, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994 page 41. Eulenburg and Holstein had been allies in the intrigues against Bismarck in 1889-1890, had co- operated afterwards in the early 1890s, but by 1894 Eulenburg and Holstein were starting to disagree more and more. Eulenburg had one of his cousins, August von Eulenburg, appointed High Marshal of the Court in 1890 and another cousin, Botho zu Eulenburg, appointed Prussian Minister-President in 1892. Eulenburg's old friend Count Kuno von Moltke was appointed military aide-de- camp to the Kaiser in 1893 while another old friend from university, Axel von Varnbüler, become Federal Council Plenipotentiary in 1894.Röhl, John The Kaiser and His Court, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994 page 41 Finally, Eulenburg's old friend from his days in Paris in 1881, Bernhard von Bülow, was appointed ambassador to Italy. In 1893, Eulenburg had himself appointed ambassador to Austria-Hungary.Röhl, John The Kaiser and His Court, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994 pages 43-45 Eulenburg and Bülow developed a secret code for communicating with one another, so that those diplomats loyal to Holstein would not be able to read their correspondence. The most prestigious positions in the Auswärtiges Amt in the 19th century were the \\"grand embassies\\" in London, Paris, Madrid, Rome, Vienna, St. Petersburg and Constantinople. Since Germany was allied to Austria in the Dual Alliance and to both Austria and Italy in the Triple Alliance, the embassies in Vienna and Rome were considered to be the most important of the \\"grand embassies\\". With Bülow as ambassador to Italy and Eulenburg the ambassador to Austria, the Bülow-Eulenburg clique had a strong position in the Auswärtiges Amt. As the power of the Bülow-Eulenburg clique grew, they came into increasing conflict with the Holstein group.Röhl, John The Kaiser and His Court, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994 pages 45 & 159-160. The differences in Eulenburg's relations between Bülow and Holstein were well illustrated by their tone; cold and formal in the Holstein-Eulenburg letters while warm and full of extravagant praise for each other in the Bülow-Eulenburg letters.Röhl, John The Kaiser and His Court, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994 page 45. For example, on 1 January 1894 Bülow wrote to Eulenburg that: \\"My innermost thoughts hasten towards you...We must surely have already known and loved each other somewhere in the endless stream of time, for in my soul there is only affinity and friendship for you\\". Bülow and Eulenburg both had strong mystical-romantic tendencies and had developed the belief that they had once been the same spiritual being, but had now been split into two with Eulenburg being the more feminine, artistic side of this being while Bülow was the more masculine, practical side of this being. Bülow explained this theory to Eulenburg in a letter where he declared: > \\"As sisters our souls once arose from the mysterious spring of Being; we > were simply given different shells and differently colored wings. As the > heavenly beings have granted you the magic gift of a rich and brilliant > artistic talent, I cannot stand productively by your side in this regard, > though I can certainly be gladdened when experiencing what you can give, > enjoying your spirit and marveling at you. I, by inclination and upbringing > more dependent on historical, legal, economic studies, may be able to pass > over to you from the storeroom which I am slowly stocking up, many a piece > for the edifice which you, having been thrown into the political struggle > against your own inclinations, are nevertheless constructing with a > felicitous and certain touch for the benefit of our Kaiser and country\\". Bülow's nickname was \\"Bernard the Obliging\\", as he was a man who almost never disagreed with Wilhelm even if he believed him to be wrong, and in the words of the German historian Ragnild von Fiebig-von Hase his \\"...mostly charming, often also ridiculous flatteries were essentially the result of falseness and a shallow, but also extremely ambitious character\\".Fiebig-von Hase, Ragnhld \\"The Uses of 'friendship': The 'personal regime' of Wilhelm II and Theodore Roosevelt\\" pages 143-175 from The Kaiser edited by Annika Mommbauer and Wilhelm Deist, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2003 page 156 Bülow was widely regarded as a man who would say and do literally anything if he thought it would help his career. Additionally, both Bülow and even more so Eulenburg were strong believers that the egoistical Wilhelm II was indeed correct in his self-estimation of himself as an almost godlike being chosen by fate to make Germany the greatest nation in the world.Röhl, John The Kaiser and His Court, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994 page 46. Bülow's letters to Eulenburg often contained statements such as \\"The leading ideas of Our Imperial Master are mostly undoubtedly correct; all that is needed is that they should in the future be defended and executed with greater tact\\" or \\"The grand aims of Our Most Gracious Master can only be attained if those who have the task of executing the Kaiser's plans possess the ability to do so\\". To a certain extent, the cynical, ultra-ambitious Bülow—who was obsessed with becoming chancellor—was manipulating Eulenburg with these letters since he knew that gaining Eulenburg's friendship was the best way of gaining the Kaiser's favour, but the mystical Eulenburg genuinely believed that Wilhelm II was an almost flawless character being chosen by some higher supernatural force to make Germany great.Röhl, John The Kaiser and His Court, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994 pages 46-48. Eulenburg wrote about the Kaiser that his important character trait was that he was \\"the knightly -- reminiscent of the finest time of the Middle Ages, with all its piety and mysticism\\".Röhl, John The Kaiser and His Court, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994 page 47. Eulenburg added that the Kaiser was also a man of the 20th century, but with him, his modern values were fortunately subordinate to his medieval values.Röhl, John The Kaiser and His Court, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994 page 48. Those attitudes promoted about the Emperor greatly offended Holstein. Holstein was a conservative who in no way wanted to change the existing system, but he also believed that Germany should be a Rechtsstaat (\\"law state\\") that should function according to the laws laid down, and not according to the imperial whim. Holstein wrote in December 1894 in a letter to Eulenburg that Germany was now faced with a choice between a \\"système de Louis XIV\\" and the coming 20th century.Röhl, John The Kaiser and His Court, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994 pages 46-47. Holstein wrote that thanks to advisors like Eulenburg Wilhelm was behaving like an absolute monarch who at the current rate would be \\"far more of an autocrat\\" than the Russian emperor, and that if things continued on their current course Germany would to have become either a dictatorship or a republic because the current system was \\"an operetta government, but not one that a European people at the end of the nineteenth century will put up with\\". Holstein wrote he wanted \\"a moderate use of a practicable system of constitutional co-operative government, which with the exceptions of St. Petersburg and Constantinople, is in operation in the rest of the European and civilised world\\". Holstein accused Eulenburg of believing \\"instinctively...to an autocratic regime no matter whether it be Russian patriarchal or despotisme éclairé on the French model\\" and that \\"every political, military and legal question is best decided directly by the Kaiser\\". Holstein ended his letter with the warning :\\" See to it that world history does not some day picture you as the evil spirit who was at the side of the imperial traveler when he chose the false path\\". In response, Eulenburg wrote to Holstein a mystical letter saying: \\"I am convinced that the Guiding Hand of Providence lies behind this elemental and natural drive of the Kaiser's to direct the affairs of the Kingdom in person. Whether it will ruin us or save us I cannot say. But I find it difficult to believe in the decline of Prussia's star\\". In 1896, Eulenburg wrote to Bülow saying he would go \\"through thick and thin\\" with Wilhelm, and would never betray his master. About Holstein, Eulenburg stated: \\"The Holstein of 1888, with his old-Prussian loyalty to the monarch, has certainly not turned in 1896 into an anti-monarchist, but he has become a parliamentarian...Sympathy and that feeling that a friend has when his friend encounters misfortune...was something that played no part for him.\\" === A new diplomat in Vienna === In 1893 Eulenburg was appointed Germany's ambassador to Austria-Hungary, a position he held until 1902. On 20 March 1894, Eulenburg wrote to Wilhelm advising him to sack Caprivi as chancellor and to make his friend Bülow foreign secretary with the ultimate aim of making him chancellor. In October 1894 a meeting at Eulenburg's estate in Liebenberg ended with the Kaiser issuing a telegram announcing to Germany that Caprivi was now dismissed as chancellor.Röhl, John The Kaiser and His Court, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994 page 49. The Dutch journalist Ian Buruma described the sacking of Caprivi—who turned out to be too liberal for Eulenburg's taste—as largely Eulenburg's work, when he turned Wilhelm against Caprivi. Eulenburg wanted his cousin Botho zu Eulenburg to be Caprivi's replacement, but Holstein was able to persuade Wilhelm not to appoint a Eulenburg as chancellor. However, Eulenburg managed to convince Wilhelm to appoint the aged Prince Chlodwig zu Hohenlohe-Schillingsfürst, who was the German ambassador to France in 1881 when Eulenburg served in the Paris embassy, as the new chancellor. During this time, Eulenburg repeatedly advised Wilhelm that the best man to be chancellor was Bülow, whom Eulenburg painted in the most glowing terms; he wrote in February 1895 to Wilhelm saying that \\"Bernhard is the most valuable servant Your Imperial Majesty possesses, the predestined Reich Chancellor of the future\\". In 1895-97, Eulenburg was at the height of his political power, and devised with Wilhelm a set of far-reaching plans intended to neutralize all opposition from those remaining followers of Caprivi within the Reich and Prussian governments, while at the same time intending to give Bülow enough political experience to take over as chancellor within a few years' time.Röhl, John The Kaiser and His Court, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994 pages 49- 50. In the summer of 1896 on the annual summer cruise in the North Sea on board the royal yacht Hohenzollern, Eulenburg and Wilhelm worked out what Röhl called \\"an astonishingly detailed plan\\" to assert the \\"personal rule\\" of the Kaiser.Röhl, John The Kaiser and His Court, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994 pages 51. The Eulenburg-Wilhelm plan went as follows: *The three ministers in the Reich and Prussian governments who offered the most resistance to Wilhelm's plans for \\"personal rule, namely General Walther Bronsart von Schellendorff, Karl Heinrich von Boetticher and Baron Adolf Marschall von Bieberstein should all be quietly fired while Hohenlohe could stay on as a 'shadow Chancellor'\\". Bülow would be appointed foreign secretary and would be the man really running the government. After a few years' time, the diplomat Bülow—who did not know much about domestic policy—would gain political experience and be appointed chancellor. In the meantime, having Hohenlohe as the \\"shadow Chancellor\\" would ensure that any mistakes Bülow made in domestic policy could always be blamed on Hohenlohe. *If Hohenlohe refused the first option, then he would be fired as well, and Botho zu Eulenburg would be appointed Chancellor with Bülow as Foreign Secretary. After a few years' time, Eulenburg would be replaced as chancellor with Bülow. *If Hohenlohe and his followers went public with their complaints against the Kaiser for dismissing them, Wilhelm would declare martial law and appoint Field Marshal Alfred von Waldersee as chancellor with Bülow again as foreign secretary. After some years of military dictatorship, Bülow would be appointed chancellor in a revived \\"constitutional\\" regime. As it were, the first option of the plan proved successful. All those associated with Caprivi had been quietly fired by early 1897 while Bülow was appointed foreign secretary and effective chancellor. Prince Hohenlohe-Schillingsfürst stayed on as chancellor until he resigned in favor of Bülow in October 1900, but Hohenlohe-Schillingsfürst was in his own words a \\"straw doll\\" and a \\"façade\\" starting in 1897; Bülow was the man who effectively ran the government from 1897 onwards and his assuming the chancellorship in 1900 was a mere formality. Bülow wrote to Eulenburg in December 1897 saying: \\"I say, write, do nothing political without thinking of you. Everything which happens for the dear, dear Kaiser, happens as you would wish, and he stands constantly before me, he is for me the motive and the aim, the raison d'être in all things.\\"Röhl, John The Kaiser and His Court, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994 pages 53. After Eulenburg started to work as an unofficial political advisor to Wilhelm in 1888, he displayed a marked fear of publicity and tried to remain within the shadows as much as possible; Eulenburg, who regarded Bülow as his alter-ego, preferred that Bülow take the spotlight.Röhl, John The Kaiser and His Court, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994 pages 46. ==“Byzantinism”: The Courtier at his Court== The botched birth that left Wilhelm II with a withered left arm had almost certainly caused brain damage as well, which Röhl argued explains much of Wilhelm's erratic personality.Röhl, John The Kaiser and His Court, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994 pages 25-26. Wilhelm's mother, the Crown Princess Victoria tried, but failed to hide her horror at her son's withered arm when he was growing up, which Röhl argued explains much of Wilhelm's narcissism as an attempt to make up for the love that he never received as a child and his damaged self-esteem caused by his withered arm.Röhl, John The Kaiser and His Court, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994 page 26. Wilhelm's parents, the Crown Prince Friedrich and Crown Princess Victoria were both classical liberals who were strongly opposed to anti-Semitism; in 1880 when the anti-Semitic historian Heinrich von Treitschke was leading a popular campaign to disemancipate German Jews, the Crown Prince and Crown Princess pointedly attended a service at a synagogue to show their support for the threatened German Jewish community and to show their disapproval of Treitschke's \\"disgraceful\\" attacks on those Germans who happened to be Jewish.Röhl, John The Kaiser and His Court, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994 page 198. In an act of rebellion, Wilhelm became an ardent anti- Semite and embraced everything that his parents hated, becoming, as Archduke Rudolf commented in 1883, \\"a dyed-in-the-wool Junker and reactionary\\" who hated democracy.Röhl, John The Kaiser and His Court, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994 pages 198-199. To compensate for feelings of inferiority caused by his withered arm, Wilhelm had in the words of Röhl a tendency to engage in \\"sadistic\\" behavior such as having the rings on his right hand inwards, squeezing especially hard when shaking hands (as result of having the use of only one arm, Wilhelm had an abnormally strong right arm), and watching with pleasure as the other party grimaced in pain.Röhl, John The Kaiser and His Court, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994 page 15. Other antics of the Kaiser included attacking his guests with his field marshal's baton and making his elderly ministers do a vigorous round of physical exercises, sometimes cutting off their braces first so that they would have trouble keeping their pants up during the exercises.Röhl, John The Kaiser and His Court, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994 pages 15-16. On board the royal yacht Hohenzollern on the annual North Sea summer cruise in 1894, Eulenburg was alarmed to be woken up at midnight by the “loud, laughing, shouting, pealing voice of the Kaiser outside my door; he was chasing the old excellencies Heintze, Kessel, Scholl, etc, through the corridors of the ship to bed!”.Röhl, John The Kaiser and His Court Cambridge: Cambridge, 1994 page 16. After one especially strenuous session of physical exercises under the midday sun on the deck of the Hohenzollern presided over by a laughing Wilhelm, Eulenburg wrote: \\"It is a curious sight: all those old military fogeys having to do their knee-jerks with strained faces! The Kaiser sometimes laughs out loud and eggs them on with a dig to the ribs. The old boys then pretend that they are particularly delighted over such a favour, but in fact they clench their fists in their pockets and afterwards grumble among themselves about the Kaiser like a lot of old women\\". The system Wilhelm created around him was known at the time as “Byzantinism” as the strange atmosphere at his court full of material opulence, factionalism, sycophancy and intrigue was so redolent of the courts of the Eastern Roman Emperors.Röhl, John The Kaiser and His Court Cambridge: Cambridge, 1994 page 158. Wilhelm often made his courtiers dance before him and the rest of the court dressed as ballerinas or poodles while blowing kisses to him. Perhaps the most infamous case of \\"Byzantinism\\" occurred in 1908 when General Dietrich von Hülsen- Haeseler danced before the Kaiser and the court dressed while wearing a pink ballerina dress, and then felt so humiliated by what he had been forced to do that he promptly died of a heart attack. Others at the court rather enjoyed participating in these homo-erotic spectacles that Wilhelm enjoyed so much. In 1892, the courtier Georg von Hülsen wrote to Count Emil von Schlitz gennant von Görtz that: > \\"You must be paraded by me as a circus poodle!-that will be a 'hit' like > nothing else. Just think: behind shaved (tights), in front long bangs out of > black or white wool, at the back a genuine poodle tail a marked rectal > opening and, when you 'beg', in front a fig-leaf. Just think how wonderful > when you bark, howl to music, shoot off a pistol or do other tricks. It is > simply splendid!...In my mind's eye I can already see H.M [His Majesty] > laughing with us...I am applying myself with real relish to this 'work' in > order to forget that my beloved sister -- the dearest thing I have on earth > -- is at this moment dying in Breslau...I feel like the clown in Knaus's > picture 'Behind the Scenes'. No matter!-H.M shall be satisfied!\\".Buruma, Ian > Anglomania A European Love Affair, New York: Vintage Books, 1998 page 205. The Kaiser very much enjoyed seeing Count Görtz dance before him wearing the poodle's costume with the \\"marked rectal opening\\". In this court, Eulenburg found his place as a sycophantic courtier always singing the praises of his master, a role he played very well since in his case the praise was sincere. Eulenburg was an absolute believer in the Führerprinzip and believed in unconditional loyalty to Wilhelm. Eulenburg was one of the few friends of the Kaiser not forced to cross-dress or wear ridiculous costumes at his parties as Wilhelm did not wish to humiliate him; instead Eulenburg—an accomplished piano player with an excellent singing voice—would play the piano and sing one of the songs he had written while Wilhelm would turn the pages of the music sheet in front of Eulenburg. Eulenburg always affectionately called Wilhelm Liebchen (\\"Darling\\") and was one of the few who did not address Wilhelm as \\"Your Majesty\\". The exact nature of the relationship between Eulenburg and Wilhelm has been the subject of much speculation. Wilhelm often called Eulenburg \\"my bosom friend, the only one I have\\".Mondimore, Francis Mark A Natural History of Homosexuality Baltimore: JHU Press, 2010 page 207. There is no evidence that Wilhelm and Eulenburg were anything other than best friends. Since Eulenburg was quite open about being gay in the company of his closest friends, and he had been Wilhelm's best friend for twenty-two years, Röhl argued that it is extremely unlikely that Wilhelm knew nothing of Eulenburg's homosexuality as he later claimed.Röhl, John The Kaiser and His Court Cambridge: Cambridge, 1994 pages 61-62. In 2005, Röhl wrote \\"This view of Wilhelm II as a repressed homosexual is gathering growing support as the Eulenburg correspondence and similar new evidence is studied and digested.\\"Röhl, John & Sombart, Nicolaus Kaiser Wilhelm II New Interpretations: The Corfu Papers, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005 page 48. The American historian Isabel V. Hull wrote: \\"Wilhelm never resolved his feelings for Eulenburg, never understood them, and certainly never labelled them...He seems to have remained unconscious of the homoerotic basis of his closest friendship, and, by extension of the homosexual aspects of his own character.\\" After coming to the throne, Wilhelm largely avoided female company and had a marked preference for surrounding himself with handsome young soldiers, which led the British historian Alan Sked to conclude that Wilhelm had at very least homosexual tendencies. In a letter written in slightly broken English (despite having a British mother, the Kaiser never quite entirely mastered English), Wilhelm told Eulenburg how he detested women, and that: \\"I never feel happy, really happy in Berlin...Only Potsdam is 'my el dorado'...where one feels free with the beautiful nature around you and soldiers as much you like, for I love my dear Regiment very much, those such nice young men in it\\".Röhl, John The Kaiser and His Court Cambridge: Cambridge, 1994 page 19. Wilhelm went on to tell Eulenburg that he preferred the company of soldiers to his family for only in the all-male world of the Potsdam garrison could he really be himself. Eulenburg himself speculated on these lines, writing in an essay for the benefit of the \\"Liebenberg Round Table\\" as his social circle came to be known that a disproportionate number of the men of the House of Hohenzollern over the centuries had been gay, and there was something within Wilhelm's blood that made him inclined to same-sex relationships. Eulenburg's own sexuality has been the subject of debate as well, with many asking if a man who was married with eight children and had affairs with women could really be a homosexual. Eulenburg was close to his children whom he adored, but was extremely cold to his wife.Aldrich, Robert \\"Eulenburg, Philip von\\" pages 181-182 from Who's who in Gay and Lesbian History: From Antiquity to World War II edited by Robert Aldrich, Garry Wotherspoon, New York: Psychology Press, 2002 page 181. Eulenburg's major emotional bonds were with the \\"Liebenberg Round Table\\", which celebrated intimately close male friendship as the ideal basis for a perfect society; there was far more warmth to Eulenburg's letters to Moltke and Varnbüler than ever was in his letters to his wife. Röhl wrote that Eulenburg was not a homosexual in the sense that most people would understand the term—namely someone who has relationships only with people of the same sex—but was rather a bisexual with a strong preference for men over women.Röhl, John The Kaiser and His Court Cambridge: Cambridge, 1994 page 61. In this regard, it is noteworthy that shortly before his death, Eulenburg wrote that the only woman he ever really loved was his mother. Röhl wrote: \\"It is now generally recognised that people cannot be classified as either hetero- or homosexual...Instead there were various intermediate stages between these extremes into which Philipp Eulenburg and some of his friends surely fitted...Such fine distinctions perished, however in an intellectual climate in which, following the teachings of the Heidelberg psychiatry professor, Emil Kraepelin, 'contrary sexual proclivities' were classified along with 'idiocy', 'cretinism', and 'congenital feeblemindedness' as a form of 'lunacy'\\". ==\\"Aesthetic anti-Semitism\\": Art, Race and Politics in Eulenburg's worldview== During his time as ambassador to Austria, Eulenburg who was a passionate Wagnerite befriended one of the world's leading Wagnerites, Houston Stewart Chamberlain who was living in Vienna at the time.Buruma, Ian Anglopmania A European Love Affair London: Vintage Books, 2000 page 219 Besides for their shared love of Richard Wagner, Eulenburg, who was an anti-Semite, Anglophobe and an opponent of democracy found much to admire in Chamberlain's anti- Semitic, Anglophobic and anti-democratic writings. Eulenburg was a völkisch anti-Semite who believed Jews to be an alien race from Asia who were \\"poisoning\\" the European Aryan race in all sorts of ways. In 1895, when Wilhelm had a famous painting done by Hermann Knackfuss popularly known as \\"The Yellow Peril\\" depicting a nightmare he had with a Buddha wreathed in fire being carried by an Asian-style dragon threatening Europe meant to symbolize the \\"Yellow Peril\\" as the alleged Asian threat to Europe was known, Eulenburg who shared Wilhelm's hatred of Asians was enthralled with the painting. On 29 September 1895, Eulenburg wrote to the Empress saying about the Yellow Peril painting: \\"I am quite under the spell of this truly magnificent work. The idea is uplifting and the execution masterly. When I immerse myself in the contemplation of the picture I am filled with the feeling that all Europe must indeed answer the call of the beloved Kaiser to unite in peaceful harmony for the sake of the cross and the dearest goods, but then the uneasy feeling steals over me that the evil in those men who oppose as an enemy power the good which manifests itself in the Kaiser's being will now cause them to tear down and attack with their ingenious criticism that which has sprung from the high-mindedness and noble heart of the Kaiser\\".Röhl, John Wilhelm II The Kaiser's Personal Monarchy, 1888-1900, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2004 page 756. To his mother Eulenburg wrote about the Yellow Peril painting: \\"The Kaiser has given me a magnificent engraving of the wonderful allegorical picture executed by Prof. Knackfuss from His Imperial Majesty's sketch: the peoples of Europe are represented as female figures, are called upon by St. Michael to defend the cross against unbelief, heathenism, etc. You will like it...It is a beautiful idea in a beautiful form\\". Eulenburg's \\"unforgettable friend\\" Gobineau had been obsessed with the fear of the \\"Yellow Peril\\" which he had expressed in his epic 1881 poem Amadis where the European civilization is destroyed by a Chinese invasion.Blue, Gregory \\"Gobineau on China: Race Theory, the \\"Yellow Peril,\\" and the Critique of Modernity\\" pages 93–139 from Journal of World History Volume 10, Issue No. 1, (Spring 1999) page 117. Much of Wilhelm's anti-Asian racism and warnings of the \\"Yellow Peril\\" very closely resembles Gobineau's writings on the Chinese, which is not surprising given that Eulenburg had introduced the Kaiser to Gobineau's theories.Blue, Gregory \\"Gobineau on China: Race Theory, the \\"Yellow Peril,\\" and the Critique of Modernity\\" pages 93–139 from Journal of World History Volume 10, Issue No. 1, (Spring 1999) pages 128–129. The American historian Gregory Blue wrote about the \\"Eulenburg connection\\" where Eulenburg played a key role in introducing the Kaiser to Gobineau's anti-Asian writings. Furthermore, Blue noted that the sketch that Wilhelm had drawn of his nightmare in April 1895 looks very different than The Yellow Peril painting that Knackfuss finished in September 1895, being considerably more disturbing and nightmarish than the finished product, and as much of the imagery in the painting appears to be drawn from Amadis, he argued that the \\"Eulenburg connection\\" at work here with Eulenburg playing a major, if uncredited role in creating The Yellow Peril painting. Völker Europas, wahrt eure heiligsten Güter (\\"Peoples of Europe, guard your dearest goods,\\" 1895) The \\"Yellow Peril\\" painting that so impressed Eulenburg in 1895. Wilhelm II always saw himself as a great artist with an intense interest in painting (especially warships) and sculpture.Röhl, John Wilhelm II The Kaiser's Personal Monarchy, 1888-1900, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2004 pages 908-909 & 915. Wilhelm was so interested in the arts and culture that on 18 December 1901 he gave the so-called \\"gutter art\\" speech in which he denounced French Impressionist painting, modernist architecture, German Expressionism and the Jugendstil as all \\"gutter art\\" that was dragging the world down, and called for Germany to assume cultural leadership of the world by producing the sort of art that he approved of to save humanity from the degrading cultural effects of \\"gutter art\\".Röhl, John Wilhelm II The Kaiser's Personal Monarchy, 1888-1900, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2004 pages 920–923. Eulenburg's status as a cultured, artistic man meant he served as both as a political and cultural adviser to the Kaiser. For Wilhelm, politics and culture were one and the same. For him, the popularity of Impressionist paintings was a sign of the \\"degeneracy\\" of the French while his paintings of warships were a sign of the spiritual strength of the Germans. Like many other völkisch nationalists, Eulenburg believed in the unity of race, language, religion, culture, ethnicity, and nationality. Thus for Eulenburg, art and politics were one and the same, both being expressions of one's \\"race\\".Domeier, Norman The Eulenburg Affair: A Cultural History of Politics in the German Empire, Rochester: Boydell & Brewer, 2015 pages 170-174. Domeier described Eulenburg as the chief promoter of \\"aesthetic anti- Semitism\\", a type of anti-Semitism concerned with glorying on one hand a romantic, reactionary and racist understanding of German national identity that expressly rejected the values of the Enlightenment while on the other hand depicting Jews as a \\"racial other\\", the antithesis of the \\"Aryan race\\", a people who formed another \\"race\\" that simply did not belong in Germany and were the principal cause of Germany's problems.Domeier, Norman The Eulenburg Affair: A Cultural History of Politics in the German Empire, Rochester: Boydell & Brewer, 2015 pages 171–174. In the words of Domeier, Eulenburg's cultural worldview pitted a \\"racially laden romanticism against the modern avant-garde\\".Domeier, Norman The Eulenburg Affair: A Cultural History of Politics in the German Empire, Rochester: Boydell & Brewer, 2015 page 172. Eulenburg's cultural works such as his songs and poems, in which he often expressed his \\"aesthetic anti-Semitism,\\" were just another means of promoting his values, as was political work. For an example, Eulenburg's popular poem Sang an Aegir (Song to Aegir) while being a love poem also contains many racist and Pan-German themes.Domeier, Norman The Eulenburg Affair: A Cultural History of Politics in the German Empire, Rochester: Boydell & Brewer, 2015 page 170 As such, Domeier argued that Eulenburg's cultural activities cannot be treated separately from his political activities as both were concerned with \\"aesthetic anti-Semitism\\".Domeier, Norman The Eulenburg Affair: A Cultural History of Politics in the German Empire, Rochester: Boydell & Brewer, 2015 pages 172-174. About the impact of Eulenburg's \\"aesthetic anti- Semitism\\", Domeier wrote: > \\"In fact, the political, cultural and symbolic capital of Wilhelm II's > favorite had contributed to making an aesthetic anti-Semitism socially > acceptable decades before the scandal broke. At the same time, he did his > utmost to further anti-Semitism in classic political areas like diplomacy, > foreign policy and culture.

Eulenburg let it be known that Wilhelm—who was also the King of Prussia—was willing to subsidize the Bayreuth festival, and rather than see the Prussian king intervene in Bavarian affairs, the Bavarian government agreed to subsidize Bayreuth.Domeier, Norman The Eulenburg Affair: A Cultural History of Politics in the German Empire, Rochester: Boydell & Brewer, 2015 page 174. Eulenburg in his turn saw the Bayreuth festival as the \\"cultural founding\\" of the empire that had failed to take place in 1871, and Eulenburg believed in time that the Bayreuth festival would become the \\"cultural center\\" of the \\"Germanic race\\". The Wagnerite Eulenburg saw the Bayreuth festival as a way of promoting not only Wagner's music, but also his anti-Semitic politics to the German public. A vivid display of Eulenburg's anti-Semitism occurred in October 1895 when he reluctantly attended a Jewish charity concert in Vienna. In a dispatch back to the Kaiser, Eulenburg complained that he was the \\"sole Aryan\\" in the entire concert hall and stated his ears were pained to hear of \\"the indescribable mishmash of German spoken with Austrian, Bohemian and Hungarian accents with international cliquishness\\".\\" Eulenburg went on to write of his disgust of the \\"drooping and enormously crooked noses\\", \\"bandy knees\\", \\"noses like tapirs\\", \\"fat lips\\", \\"prominent cheekbones\\", \\"eye teeth like a walrus's\\", \\"slanted eyes like slits\\", \\"gaping jaws with hollow teeth\\", and the \\"exposed and sweaty shoulders\\" of the Jewish women in their evening night-gowns.Domeier, Norman The Eulenburg Affair: A Cultural History of Politics in the German Empire, Rochester: Boydell & Brewer, 2015 page 175. Eulenburg wrote that since the Jews all paid their respects to a \\"Jewish greybeard\\" that this proved the old Jew \\"must had slaughtered and eaten many Christian children, since two dozen long yellow teeth protruded from his ghastly maw\\" (it is not clear in repeating the blood libel if Eulenburg was making an anti-Semitic joke or if he really believed in the blood libel). Finally, Eulenburg concluded his report to the Kaiser that the \\"badly behaved\\" Jewish children at the concert were all repulsively ugly and that the only attractive Jew he saw at the concert was the lead singer, a young woman whom Eulenburg stated was more animal than human, albeit one who could sing very well for a Jew. Despite his anti-Semitism, during his time as Ambassador to Austria, Eulenburg engaged in a homosexual relationship with the Austrian banker Nathaniel Meyer von Rothschild who liked Eulenburg so much that when he died in 1905 he left Eulenburg one million krones in his will.Domeier, Norman The Eulenburg Affair: A Cultural History of Politics in the German Empire, Rochester: Boydell & Brewer, 2015 page 176. Rothschild, who possessed great wealth was ostracized by the Austrian aristocracy because he was a Jew (the fact that he was also gay contributed to his feeling like an outsider), and he often paid aristocrats to be his friends, which is how he met Eulenburg. Eulenburg often proclaimed his hatred of Jews, but he was prepared to socialize with wealthy Jews provided that they were willing to pay well for the social prestige that they accrued by having such an illustrious man as Eulenburg in their social circle. The relative penury of his youth left Eulenburg with an insatiable desire for money, and despite his wealth, he was always on the lookout for chances to make more money. In 1897, Eulenburg's younger brother, Friedrich von Eulenburg, an army officer was charged with being a homosexual.Röhl, John The Kaiser and His Court, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994 page 55. His older brother tried his best to have the Kaiser stop the court-martial, but the Army was unwilling to do so.Röhl, John The Kaiser and His Court, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994 pages 55–56. In 1900, Eulenburg wrote a long memo for the benefit of his social circle about the court-martial of his brother, writing that men like himself and his brother were always threatened with public disgrace, which ended with Eulenburg writing: > \\"Farewell, my friend! Are you certain that you have understood the story > correctly? Please read it once again I beg you! So that you understand > completely that the path of our lives is crossed by terrible demons, and > that we should raise our hands to God in supplication, begging him, begging > him fervently to defend us from them, to defend our loved ones from > them!\\".Röhl, John The Kaiser and His Court, Cambridge: Cambridge University > Press, 1994 pages 56. In 1898, scandal threatened Eulenburg when the wife of Kuno von Moltke, in a sealed deposition, filed for divorce on the grounds that her husband was more interested in having sex with Eulenburg than with her.Röhl, John The Kaiser and His Court, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994 pages 57. Moltke promptly instructed his lawyer to settle the divorce in his wife's favor in exchange for her not making these accusations public. Axel \\"Dachs\\" von Varnbüler wrote to Moltke telling him not to worry about losing the favor of \\"the One\\" [Wilhelm II] saying: > \\"I'm sure I am not mistaken in thinking that your pain is sharpened because > you cannot hide, keep at bay, all this ugliness from him, from the Liebchen > [\\"Darling\\"-Wilhelm II]. But do not torment yourself unnecessarily about this > -- he is man enough to put a stop to nasty gossip -- and he knows and loves > you too well in your peculiarity to allow even the shadow of blame to fall > upon you\\".Röhl, John The Kaiser and His Court, Cambridge: Cambridge > University Press, 1994 page 58. After learning of Moltke's divorce, Wilhelm confronted Varnbüler, and demanded to know what was happening. According to Varnbüler in a letter written on 4 June 1898 to Moltke: \\"The Liebchen accosted me in the Tiergarten the day before yesterday. After he duly admired my yellow boots and colour co- ordinated riding costume, he asked me \\"Don't you know anything about Kuno? I can't get anything out of either him or Philly\\"\\". Varnbüler went on to write that Wilhelm used \\"unrepeatably energetic expressions\\" which indicated to Varnbüler \\"that he was extremely well-informed and no longer retained any illusions\\".\\" After 1897 with Bülow in effective charge of the government, Eulenburg's role as a political trouble-shooter largely came to an end with Eulenburg himself writing that the \\"great turning point\\" was the summer of 1897 because with the \\"personal rule\\" of Wilhelm in place, the Kaiser was now firmly in charge after struggling to assert his authority since coming to the throne in 1888.Röhl, John The Kaiser and His Court, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994 pages 52–53. Eulenburg himself happily wrote: \\"No more bomb-like despatches, no more wild letters from Holstein, no more lamentations from Marschall!!!\\".Röhl, John The Kaiser and His Court, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994 page 53. Eulenburg had a broader vision beyond helping Wilhelm establish his \\"personal regime\\". Eulenburg was a convinced opponent of democracy and was threatened by growing demand for democracy in Germany. Germany in the 1890s was nowhere close to a revolution, but Eulenburg could see that in the long run the demand for democracy would continue to grow. Eulenburg was opposed to proclaiming martial law and ruling via terror as he argued that a regime based only on fear could not command popular legitimacy or respect, and would not last in the long run. Instead Eulenburg argued for Wilhelm's personal regime\\" to be based upon the Roman formula of \\"bread and circus\\". The \\"bread\\" in this case would be a greatly expanded welfare state while the \\"circus\\" would be Weltpolitik (\\"World politics\\"). Thus, the growth of the welfare state from 1897 onwards and the introduction of navalist politics represented by the Tirpitz Plan intended to win Germany \\"world power status\\" were closely connected as part of the effort to stabilise the regime. For Eulenburg, Weltpolitik together with the related politics of navalism were initially more of a means for stabilizing the political system by gathering popular support for the regime than a goal in and of themselves.Röhl, John The Kaiser and His Court, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994 pages 29 & 45. In this respect, the German historian Michael Epkenhans wrote that it was no accident that in 1897 Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz was appointed naval state secretary.Epkenhas, Michael \\"Wilhelm II and 'his' Navy, 1888-1918\\" pages 12-36 from The Kaiser, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2003 page 23. The charismatic Tirpitz was a born showman who quickly managed to convert much of the German public over to navalism, arguing for the formula that sea power equals world power or whoever rules the seas also rules the world; even through Tirpitz saw his efforts as primarily directed towards making Germany the world's greater power, there was an element of domestic stabilization involved in his campaign for greater spending on the navy.Epkenhas, Michael \\"Wilhelm II and 'his' Navy, 1888-1918\\" pages 12-36 from The Kaiser, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2003 pages 23-24. On 7 October 1898, Eulenburg summoned the leader of the Zionist movement, the Hungarian journalist Theodor Herzl to Liebenberg to announce that his master Wilhelm II wanted to see a Jewish state established in Palestine (which would be a German protectorate) in order to \\"drain\\" the Jews away from Europe, and thus \\"purify the German race\\".Domeier, Norman The Eulenburg Affair: A Cultural History of Politics in the German Empire, Rochester: Boydell & Brewer, 2015 page 177. Herzl recalled that Eulenburg was a \\"perfect gentleman\\" during his visit to Liebenberg, but he made no attempt to hide his anti-Semitism, saying to Herzl's face that he believed that the Jews did not belong in Europe and that he only supported Zionism as the best way of removing the Jews humanely from Europe.Domeier, Norman The Eulenburg Affair: A Cultural History of Politics in the German Empire, Rochester: Boydell & Brewer, 2015 pages 177-178. Eulenburg told Herzl that he had a special relationship with the Kaiser that allowed him to \\"speak freely\\" to Wilhelm in a way no-one else could.Domeier, Norman The Eulenburg Affair: A Cultural History of Politics in the German Empire, Rochester: Boydell & Brewer, 2015 page 178. The plan for establishing a Jewish state in Palestine came to nought when the Ottoman Sultan Abdul Hamid II rejected the plan, saying that Palestine was Muslim land that he would never cede to the Jews and more importantly, he had no intention of giving up any part of his empire. In 1900, Eulenburg was created the first hereditary Prince (Fürst) zu Eulenburg und Hertefeld and Count von Sandels. The princely title was entailed to the family's perpetual possession of the Hertefeld estate. The second title was in honour of the family of his wife, whose father was the last Swedish Count af Sandels. Simultaneously, Eulenburg was accorded the honorific of Serene Highness, the same style (manner of address) used to the German Empire's still reigning princes, such as the rulers of Lippe, Reuss and Waldeck and Pyrmont. In 1900, the Boxer Rebellion broke out in China. The German minister to China, Baron Clemens von Ketteler, had murdered in public view a 14-year-old Chinese boy, who had nothing to do with Boxers, as a way of a reaction to the Boxer threat. This abuse of diplomatic immunity made Ketteler very unpopular in China, and led to him being murdered by the Chinese soldiers who were supposed to be protecting him as he travelled to the Forbidden City. Wilhelm-the man who popularized the phrase \\"the Yellow Peril\\" and who had always hated Asians with a passion-was enraged by the news that his minister in China had been murdered, and he was determined to wreck bloody vengeance on the Chinese.Mombauer, Annika \\"Wilhelm, Waldersee and the Boxer Rebellion\\" pages 91-118 from The Kaiser edited by Annika Mombauer, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2003 pages 94-95 Eulenburg was with Wilhelm on aboard the Hohenzollern on the annual North Sea summer cruise in 1900 and saw first-hand Wilhelm's viscerally hate-filled rage against the Chinese.Mombauer, Annika \\"Wilhelm, Waldersee and the Boxer Rebellion\\" pages 91-118 from The Kaiser edited by Annika Mombauer, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2003 page 101 Eulenburg wrote that Wilhelm regarded Kettler's murder as a \\"personal insult\\" and he was going \\"send troops to take revenge!!!\\".Röhl, John The Kaiser and His Court, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994 page 13. At the height of the Boxer crisis, Eulenburg wrote to Bülow that he was utterly terrified of Wilhelm-whom Eulenburg stated was not entirely sane-and that Bülow should be careful when reporting the news from China out of the fear of what Wilhelm might do. Eulenburg wrote to Bülow: > \\"H.M [His Majesty] is no longer in control of himself when He is seized by > rage. I regard the situation as highly dangerous and I am at a loss as to > know what to do...These things cut me to the quick. I have had so much faith > in the Kaiser's abilities-and in the passage of time!-Now both have failed, > and one sees a person suffering whom one loves dearly but cannot help...I > have the impression that I am sitting on a powder keg and I am extremely > careful. Please limit your political reports as much as possible and request > decisions only where they are unavoidable.\\"Röhl, John The Kaiser and His > Court, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994 page 23. Eulenburg added that he sent a doctor to try calm Wilhelm down as he was trapped in a seemingly permanent state of rage-spending every waking moment violently ranting and raving nonstop about his hatred of the Chinese and the bloody revenge he was planning to take on them-but to no avail. Wilhelm II was not the only member of the House of Hohenzollern to have a meltdown in 1900. In October 1900, there were what Eulenburg called \\"appalling scenes\\" as the Empress behaved \\"like a madwoman\\" as she started to scream and cry uncontrollably, complaining that the Emperor did not love her, did not help with raising their children and spent all of his time with Eulenburg.Vovk, Justin Imperial Requiem Bloomington: iUniverse Inc, 201 page 137. The Kaiserin also accused her husband of having an affair with Eulenburg.Vovk, Justin Imperial Requiem Bloomington: iUniverse Inc, 201 page 136. In 1901, Eulenburg introduced Houston Stewart Chamberlain to Wilhelm II, who first met at Eulenburg's Liebenberg estate. The next day Eulenburg wrote the Emperor \\"stood completely under the spell of this man [Chamberlain], whom he understood better than any of the other guests because of his thorough study of The Foundations\\".Field, Geoffrey The Evangelist of Race The Germanic Vision of Houston Stewart Chamberlain, New York: Columbia University Press, 1981 page 250 The German journalist Theodor Wolff wrote in 1906 that: \\"I bet you ten to one that it was that skald, the friend and admirer of Gobineau, who first pointed his other friend, the Kaiser towards the racial prophet's most eager disciple, Houston Stewart Chamberlain. The mystical notion of the 'race that will bring order to the world' found its way from Gobineau via Eulenburg and Chamberlain to the Kaiser, and this notion in turn gave rise to the thought that 'the world should be healed by the German spirit.'\\" ==Scandal== Although he was married, Eulenburg was connected in homosexual liaisons with members of the Kaiser's inner circle, including Count Kuno von Moltke, the military commander of Berlin. Sources say that he continued to have homosexual relationships even after the marriage. The public exposure of these liaisons in 1906 led to the Harden-Eulenburg Affair. The scandal was caused by the growing power of the Bülow-Eulenburg clique within the Auswärtiges Amt at the expense of the Holstein faction. Holstein was known as the \\"Monster of the Labyrinth\\", a master of the dark arts of political intrigue with an impressive private intelligence network who had made himself indispensable to successive governments over the years.Mondimore, Francis Mark A Natural History of Homosexuality Baltimore: JHU Press, 2010 page 207 To get his way, Holstein had often threatened to resign, believing that no government could do without his services, a threat that had always worked in the past. After the debacle of Algeciras Conference, Holstein had quarreled with Bülow and submitted his resignation to Wilhelm; much to his intense shock, it was accepted. After learning from one of his spies that Eulenburg had over the course of a lunch with the Kaiser told him to accept Holstein's resignation, an extremely embittered Holstein decided to seek revenge on Eulenburg. In May 1906, Holstein sent Eulenburg a libelous and very rude letter insulting him, and challenging him to a duel to the death.Röhl, John The Kaiser and His Court, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994 page 59. Eulenburg wrote to Varnbüler soon after saying that: \\"I had a long, very heated discussion with H.M about Hol[stein] and disagreeable it was for me. He will not forgive me, if he should later hear anything concerning my affairs, that I have said not a word to him about what has taken place\\". After Eulenburg declined to fight the duel, Holstein decided to destroy Eulenburg by attacking him in his Achilles heel, namely by exposing his homosexuality.Röhl, John The Kaiser and His Court, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994 page 69. To that end, Holstein contacted the crusading journalist Maximilian Harden to inform him that Eulenburg was gay. Holstein had known Eulenburg since June 1886, and had on some point along the line learned of Eulenburg's sexual orientation. After being tipped off by Holstein, Harden started to run a series of articles in his newspaper Die Zukunft charging the \\"Liebenberg Round Table\\", a clique of homosexuals obsessed with the occult headed by Eulenburg, were dominating the Imperial court.Röhl, John The Kaiser and His Court, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994 pages 58 & 68–69. Röhl wrote that Harden used terribly homophobic language in his attacks on Eulenburg, but the essence of his articles alleging the existence of a \\"Liebenberg Round Table\\" at the court was indeed correct. In the aftermath of the First Moroccan Crisis which ended with the Reich humiliated at the Algeciras Conference, Harden's accusations that German foreign policy was being run by a clique of homosexuals who were too \\"soft\\" to make the necessary decisions to go to war had a wide resonance. The belligerent ultra-nationalist Harden believed that Germany should have attacked France in 1905, even if meant war with Britain and possibly the United States as well; in his mind, the only reason why Wilhelm chose to attend the Algeciras conference rather than go to war was because he was being advised by the Liebenberg Round Table. In November 1906, Harden ran an article about an unnamed senior German diplomat being gay who was clearly meant to be Eulenburg whom Harden called \\"the Harpist\\", and accused him of having a relationship with an unnamed senior French diplomat, stating the two frequently went on hunting trips together. Raymond Lecomte, the First Secretary at the French embassy in Berlin—who was a close associate of Eulenburg, whom he frequently went hunting with—promptly burned all of his papers relating to Eulenburg after Harden's article. Harden made much of the Eulenburg-Lecomte relationship to suggest that Eulenburg was being blackmailed into working as a French spy; Eulenburg and Lecomte were lovers, but there is no evidence to suggest that Eulenburg ever provided intelligence to France.Mancini, Elena Magnus Hirschfeld and the Quest for Sexual Freedom: A History of the First International Sexual Freedom Movement, London: Macmillan, 2010 pages 96–97 Beyond that, Harden made much of Eulenburg's effeminate ways and love of singing to suggest that Eulenburg was simply not manly enough to properly direct the affairs of the Reich; Harden's hero was Bismarck, whom Harden admiringly presented as an ideal Prussian man: tough, militaristic, ruthless, hard, decisive, and certainly not someone who liked to sing as Eulenburg did. In his articles Harden claimed that to direct the affairs of state required \\"hard men\\" like Bismarck who could make the necessary decisions such as taking the nation to war (Harden saw war-making as the principal purpose of the state), and Harden charged that women were simply too soft to be leaders, that women would rather submit to force than fight.Mancini, Elena Magnus Hirschfeld and the Quest for Sexual Freedom: A History of the First International Sexual Freedom Movement, London: Macmillan, 2010 pages 97–98 Harden thus argued that someone effeminate like Eulenburg was too \\"womanly\\" to be guiding the German state, and suggested that Germany's diplomatic defeat in the First Moroccan Crisis of 1905–06 was due to Eulenburg's influence on the Kaiser.Mancini, Elena Magnus Hirschfeld and the Quest for Sexual Freedom: A History of the First International Sexual Freedom Movement, London: Macmillan, 2010 page 98 Harden's initial target was not Wilhelm, but Eulenburg; Harden believed that the Kaiser would have gone to war with France in 1905 on his own, and it was Eulenburg who had supposedly held him back. The American historian Elena Mancini argued that the relentless way that Harden pursued Eulenburg despite constant harassment from the Prussian authorities was due to more than his ultra-nationalism, and that the root reason was Harden's \\"...thoroughly masculine idea of politics, which was distilled in images of decisiveness and a readiness for war\\". Mancini further suggested that Harden himself was gay, and that as a repressed homosexual, attacking another homosexual was his way of validating himself as heterosexual. Despite his homophobic attacks on the Liebenberg Round Table as a degenerate gay clique mismanaging foreign policy, Harden had surprisingly liberal views on homosexuality and often called for the repeal of Paragraph 175.Beachy, Robert Gay Berlin: Birthplace of a Modern Identity, New York: Knopf, 2014 page 124. In 1907 Moltke sued Harden for libel after the latter ran an article accusing him and Eulenburg of having a sexual relationship and lost.Aldrich, Robert \\"Eulenburg, Philip von\\" pages 181–182 from Who's who in Gay and Lesbian History: From Antiquity to World War II edited by Robert Aldrich, Garry Wotherspoon, New York: Psychology Press, 2002 page 182. At the trial, the sexologist and early gay rights advocate Magnus Hirschfeld testified for Harden, stating that Moltke was gay.Mancini, Elena Magnus Hirschfeld and the Quest for Sexual Freedom: A History of the First International Sexual Freedom Movement, London: Macmillan, 2010 page 100 The homosexual Hirschfeld-who passionately wanted to make homosexuality legal in Germany-believed that proving that Army officers like Moltke were gay would help his case for legalization, and as such he also testified that he believed there was nothing wrong with Moltke. Hirschfeld's testimony caused outrage all over Germany; the Die Vossische Zeitung newspaper condemned Hirschfeld in an editorial as \\"a freak who acted for freaks in the name of pseudoscience\\" while the Die Mūnchener Neuesten Nachrichten declared in an editorial: \\"Dr. Hirschfeld makes public propaganda under the cover of science which does nothing but poison our people. Real science should fight against this!\\". After the jury ruled in favor of Harden, Judge Hugo Isenbiel was enraged by the jury's decision, which he saw as expressing approval for Hirschfeld, and overturned the verdict under the grounds that homosexuals \\"have the morals of dogs\\". After that verdict was overturned, a second trial found Harden guilty of libel. Harden appealed and was again found guilty and agreed to an out-of-court settlement. At the same time the much publicized Moltke-Harden-Eulenburg case played out to banner headlines all around the world, the gay rights campaigner Adolf Brand-who believed that the public would accept homosexuality as normal if only enough high-profile gays were outed-published a pamphlet alleging that Chancellor Bülow was gay.Beachy, Robert Gay Berlin: Birthplace of a Modern Identity, New York: Knopf, 2014 page 130. Bülow then sued Brand for libel, and during the course of this trial, Eulenburg testified as a character witness, during which he denied under oath that he had ever committed any \\"depravities\\" with Bülow or any other men.Beachy, Robert Gay Berlin: Birthplace of a Modern Identity, New York: Knopf, 2014 page 131. Eulenburg also testified that he was appalled by the attempts of Brand and Hirschfeld to legalize homosexuality, saying that he believed that homosexuality was a disgusting evil that should be stamped out without any mercy.Beachy, Robert Gay Berlin: Birthplace of a Modern Identity, New York: Knopf, 2014 pages 131–132. The anti-Semitic Eulenburg saw himself as the victim of a Jewish plot to ruin him for his role in promoting his type of \\"aesthetic anti-Semitism\\", and called Hardan a \\"rascally Jew\\".Domeier, Norman The Eulenburg Affair: A Cultural History of Politics in the German Empire, Rochester: Boydell & Brewer, 2015 page 169 In late 1907 during the course of the second Moltke-Harden libel trial, Eulenburg had been subpoenaed by Harden's lawyers and testified that he never engaged in homosexual acts with Moltke or any other men. Harden-who had realized to his cost-that it as hard to win a case in Prussia, came up with a new strategy. Harden had a friend in Munich, Anton Städele, run a false article in his newspaper Neue Frie Volkszeitung saying that Eulenburg had bribed Harden; Harden then sued Städele for libel.Beachy, Robert Gay Berlin: Birthplace of a Modern Identity, New York: Knopf, 2014 page 134. During this trial, on 22 April 1908, two Bavarian lake fishermen named Jakob Ernst and Georg Riedel testified under oath in a Munich courtroom that they both been sodomized by Eulenburg when he had vacationed on the Starnbergersee in the 1880s, which led to Eulenburg being indicted for perjury. Harden won his libel case against Städele, and then secretly paid him back the sum he had just won against him in court.Beachy, Robert Gay Berlin: Birthplace of a Modern Identity, New York: Knopf, 2014 page 133. On 30 April 1908, Eulenburg was interviewed by three detectives from the Berlin police department during a visit to Liebenberg about the revelations from the Munich trial; in their report one of the detectives wrote that Eulenburg was the greatest liar he had ever met during his career as a policeman and should definitely be indicted for perjury. In 1908, Eulenburg was placed on trial for perjury due to his denial of his homosexuality; the trial was repeatedly postponed due to Eulenburg's claim of poor health. After Eulenburg was arrested on 8 May 1908 at his Liebenberg estate, the Prussian police seized and burned all of his papers while on 27 May 1908, the Bavarian police raided the estate of Baron Jan von Wendelstadt—who was yet another of Eulenburg's gay friends-to seize and burn all of his papers relating to Eulenburg. Eulenburg, who had been expecting this move from the authorities for some time, had copied certain of his letters and had them hidden all over Germany; the last known of these caches of letters were discovered in 1971 hidden in the wine cellar of the Hemmingen castle.Röhl, John 1914: Delusion or Design?, New York: St. Martin's Press, 1973 page 17. None of the surviving Eulenburg letters indicate that Wilhelm II was gay, but they do mention that Jakob Ernst, the fisherman on the Starnbergersee-whom Eulenburg had a relationship with in the late 1880s-was a friend of Wilhelm II at the same time, being employed to row the Kaiser and Eulenburg around the Starnbergersee when the two vacationed there in the 1880s.Röhl, John The Kaiser and His Court, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994 page 63. Since the Kaiser did not normally associate with Bavarian lake fishermen, people in 1908 would have suspected something very unusual in this friendship, and given the relationship between Ernst and Eulenburg, many people would have concluded that Wilhelm was also having sex with Ernst, though the surviving Eulenburg letters give no such indication. After Eulenburg's arrest, Wilhelm wrote him a very cold letter saying he wanted no homosexuals at his court, as such their friendship was now over and he never wanted to see or hear from Eulenburg again.Röhl, John 1914: Delusion or Design?, New York: London: Elek, 1973 page 57. Eulenburg was utterly heart- broken that Wilhelm had turned against him.Röhl, John 1914: Delusion or Design?, London: Elek, 1973 page 57. Varnbüler wrote, but did not send Eulenburg a letter suggesting that he commit suicide to save the honour of the Kaiser.Röhl, John The Kaiser and His Court, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994 page 60. Varnbüler later wrote in 1912 that he changed his mind on whether Eulenburg should take his life after considering how Wilhelm had abandoned Eulenburg, when \\"all members of the court and military circles avoided Eulenburg as though he were a criminal and a leper\\", when even Bülow \\"failed the test of friendship\\", when Moltke refused to answer Eulenburg's letters and members of the Eulenburg family \\"shamefully distanced themselves from Liebenberg\\", that he could not turn against his friend Eulenburg and decided to stand by him. During his time in jail (Eulenburg had been denied bail) while he was taken back and forth to his trial, a deeply depressed Eulenburg so often spoke of taking his own life that he was put under suicide watch.Mondimore, Francis Mark A Natural History of Homosexuality Baltimore: JHU Press, 2010 page 209 During the trial, the major prosecution witness was Ernst as Riedel had a \\"typically Bavarian\\" criminal record for drunken brawling as he had been convicted of assault 32 times, all under the influence of alcohol, and thus was not seen as the most credible of witnesses.Domeier, Norman The Eulenburg Affair: A Cultural History of Politics in the German Empire, Rochester: Boydell & Brewer, 2015 page 186. Eulenburg testified that Ernst's daily beer consumption was \\"excessive, even by Bavarian standards\\" and claimed that his accounts of sexual encounters between himself and him were unreliable, coming from someone who spent so much of his time in a drunken daze. Eulenburg explained the trial as part of a Catholic plot to destroy him, as he was a leading defender of the \\"Protestant empire\\" and so he claimed that the Jesuits wanted to discredit him in order to enable Bavaria to break away, a remark that sparked enormous controversy as it suggested that Germany was and should be a Protestant-dominated state.Domeier, Norman The Eulenburg Affair: A Cultural History of Politics in the German Empire, Rochester: Boydell & Brewer, 2015 page 188. During the trial, it was revealed that Eulenburg had engaged in witness tampering for he had sent his servant Georg Kistler with a letter he had written to meet Riedel telling not to mention what they had done together in the 1880s and that he was safe from prosecution for the statute of limitations for violating Paragraph 175 had expired.Beachy, Robert Gay Berlin: Birthplace of a Modern Identity, New York: Knopf, 2014 page 136. Eulenburg's trial was for perjury, but effectively it was homosexuality as the prosecution presented a long list of witnesses, mostly working-class young men who testified that Eulenburg had tried to engage them in sex, or had made inappropriate remarks. Eulenburg did not help his cause when he testified that he had never broken Paragraph 175 in the narrow, technical sense that Paragraph 175 had specifically prohibited only anal sex-thereby implying that he engaged in sexual acts other than sodomy with Moltke and other men. Finally, it was revealed that despite Eulenburg's claim he was stoutly opposed to efforts of Brand and Hirschfeld to legalize homosexuality that the police search of Liebenberg after his arrest had discovered that he owned numerous pamphlets produced by the gay rights group the Scientific-Humanitarian Committee calling for the legalization of homosexuality.Beachy, Robert Gay Berlin: Birthplace of a Modern Identity, New York: Knopf, 2014 page 135. On 13 July 1908, Eulenburg collapsed in court, and the judge ruled that the trial was over as Eulenburg was medically unfit. Right until his death in 1921, Eulenburg was examined by doctors twice every year to see if he was fit to stand trial and was always found to be unfit. Harden wrote to Holstein on 15 November 1908 stating that believed that the \\"united fairies\\" at the court as he called Eulenburg and his friends had such power because they could blackmail the Emperor, who he strongly suggested was also one of the \\"fairies\\" at the court. By this time, Harden had become convinced that the problem was not Eulenburg, but rather Wilhelm. Harden went on to write: \\"To clear ourselves of shame and ridicule, we will have to go to war soon, or face the sad necessity of making a change of imperial personnel on our own account, even if the strongest personal pressure had to be brought to bear. (Or I could say: even if we had do things in 'Earnest').\\" ==After the fall== Before and during World War I, Prince Eulenburg was strongly in favor of German expansionism.Röhl, John 1914: Delusion or Design? Elek: London, 1973 page 57. As he aged, Eulenburg had come to embrace the goal of Weltpolitik as a goal in and of itself while at the same time as the Anglo-German naval race continued to express concern about how the Tirpitz Plan was destroying the German budget as the state continued to pour and pour more money into building warships. In an essay he wrote in April 1912 entitled \\"The German Fleet\\", Eulenburg wrote that he believed \\"that the Kaiser nor the German government want the war\\" (emphasis in the original), which he held to be inevitable.Röhl, John 1914: Delusion or Design? Elek: London, 1973 page 59. But he wrote that Germany was the principal cause of international tensions, writing that: Eulenburg concluded that the naval build-up advocated by Grand Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz known as the Tirpitz Plan was wasteful in the extreme, arguing that Germany would have been better served by a small cruiser fleet capable of protecting the German merchant marine and coastlines, and allowing the billions of marks spent on the Navy to go to social reforms and the Army instead. Eulenburg argued that the great expansion of the German Navy was unnecessary as Germany was \\"neither an island nor a boat, but a beautiful green field on the Continent in which the sheep, guarded by the military sheepdogs, get fat while the oxen engage in politics.\\"Röhl, John 1914: Delusion or Design?, Elek: London, 1973 pages 59–60. (\\"Schaf\\" (sheep) and \\"Ochse\\" (ox) can be used to describe a lack of intelligence in German.) But at the same time, Eulenburg's rejection of navalism was based on the idea that it was the wrong way to pursue German ambitions. Eulenburg wrote: Eulenburg wrote that the best way of pursuing German power politics was \\"The unification of the Powers of the European Continent\\". Eulenburg stated that the \\"great Napoleon\\" thought the unification of all Europe under French leadership was the only way of \\"breaking England's domination of the sea\\". Eulenburg wrote that Napoleon had failed because Russia was unwilling and because \\"military communications were totally inadequate at the time.\\" By contrast, Eulenburg wrote: Eulenburg argued that the money saved by cutting back on the Navy would allow every German town to have an Army garrison \\"which would act as an ever- alert military police force against the excesses of Social Democracy\\". Eulenburg ended his essay by arguing that his proposals were not meant to prevent a war, but to ensure that Germany would win a war against Britain, which Eulenburg claimed was inevitable. Eulenburg ended by writing: In 1914, Eulenburg welcomed and supported World War I, and was particularly proud of the way the German government made it appear that Russian mobilization had forced war on Germany.Röhl, John 1914: Delusion or Design? Elek: London, 1973 page 63. In a letter, Eulenburg wrote: > \\"'We were forced into the War by Russia'; so people think-and so they are > supposed to think. The manner in which this \\"fact\\" was demonstrated to us by > means of documents had a Bismarckian touch that appealed to me; was it > Bethmann? Jagow? Zimmermann? I do not know. My guess is Zimmermann plus > Jagow.\\" Eulenburg felt that the Austrian ultimatum to Serbia was \\"Prussian to the marrow\\" since its terms were cleanly meant to inspire rejection and he believed that nobody in the Austrian government was capable of writing such an ultimatum without German prompting. Eulenburg wrote that: > \\"It was officially maintained in Berlin that \\"the German Government was not > aware of the content of the note\\". That may be so. > > But who, in such case is the Government? Certainly it includes the Kaiser, > the Reich Chancellor and the ministers. But the Government is not, for > example Privy Councilor Zimmermann, the Chief of the General Staff and other > gentlemen-who are even in a position to correct such a note. > > What is undeniable, however, is that the note was a provocation... > > All this, after our provocative move, was no more than a charade-it > gratified me and brought back old memories\\"Röhl, John 1914: Delusion or > Design? Elek: London, 1973 page 64. Despite his disgrace, Eulenburg had many friends in the government, especially the military, and so was very well informed about German decision-making behind the scenes during the July Crisis. In reply to a letter, Eulenburg wrote his friend, General Helmuth von Moltke, the Chief of the General Staff, told him that he had \\"arrived at the conviction that-if it were still at all possible for us to win-we had to attack this year.\\" On 2 June 1915, Eulenburg's favorite son Botho Sigwart zu Eulenburg was killed in action while fighting against the Russians in Galicia. Eulenburg—who had so welcomed the war in 1914-was emotionally devastated by the loss of Sigwart, and first began to develop some doubts about the war. Eulenburg was to spend the rest of his life attempting to contact the ghost of Sigwart via séances and other occult practices. In a December 1917 letter, Eulenburg wrote > \\"One can be in two minds about our foreign position, but not about the > situation at home. Prussia leads Europe, but has herself fallen into the > hands of foreigners, among whom I count the Kaiser and the Jews. For the > Bethmanns too are nothing, but internationalist chatterboxes.\\"Röhl, John > 1914: Delusion or Design? Elek: London, 1973 page 58. In a letter of 21 March 1918 about the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, Eulenburg wrote: > \\"In whatever way we win, our victory must and will engender the most > dreadful hatred of us, so that, with our great-grandchildren in mind, we > must fashion frontiers which can provide a certain guarantee of safety in > the military as well as the economic sphere. Of course we shall be able to > use admiration-but the hatred will be greater and our geographically > unfortunate position must be corrected if that well deserved admiration is > not to be weakened by the accusation of stupidity. But who is to undertake > the correction of unfortunate geographical position? Surely only the > military genius of our Army leaders-or were you perhaps thinking of leaving > it to our politicians? If the latter had not dug their grave long ago, we > would now be calling it Brest-Litovsk.\\" After World War I, Eulenburg changed his mind about the war, and then claimed in his letters that, had he remained Ambassador to Austria during the July Crisis, he would have prevented the war.Röhl, John 1914: Delusion or Design? Elek: London, 1973 page 67. In a letter, Eulenburg asked whether one should \\"lay the blame on the Austrian Government alone because they followed the incitements of their stronger and therefore in military matters absolutely dominant ally?\\"Röhl, John 1914: Delusion or Design? Elek: London, 1973 page 66. Eulenburg argued that: > \\"Germany is the stronger of the Allies. Without her consent, Austria cannot > go to war with Russia-Serbia. The stronger partner is in a position to > propose a conference and the weaker is compelled to accept.\\" Eulenburg went on to write: > \\"Serbia is Russia. If Austria marches against Serbia and if Berlin does not > prevent Austria's belligerent action, then the great breaking wave of World > War rolls irresistibly towards us. I repeat: Berlin must know that, > otherwise idiots live in the Wilhelmstrasse. Kaiser Wilhelm must know that. > > If Austria takes the step upon which she has decided at the Cabinet meeting > of July 7th and if Kaiser Wilhelm assures Austria of his loyalty to the > Alliance under any circumstances, then he also shares Count Berchtold's > policy with regard to war with Russia-and Russia is the ally of France. > > The situation which I have briefly described here is an established fact > that cannot be masked.\\" In a letter to his friend Wolfgang Putlitz, Eulenburg stated that his views about the truth of 1914 were \\"dangerous\\", and \\"this letter must be destroyed for the sake of the Fatherland.\\"Röhl, John 1914: Delusion or Design? Elek: London, 1973 page 69. Eulenburg died in Liebenberg in 1921, aged 74. In 1932, Eulenburg's friend Professor Kurt Breysig, with whom Eulenburg shared many secrets, published the book The German Spirit and its Essence, which stated that Germany could have avoided World War I by taking up the \\"excellent\\" British offer of an international conference. When the book was republished later in 1932 by the German Book Society, the passages critical of German actions in the July Crisis were removed without Breysig's knowledge or permission.Röhl, John 1914: Delusion or Design? Elek: London, 1973 pages 68–69. In Nazi Germany, Eulenburg was remembered as a martyr, a straight Aryan hero framed on false charges of homosexuality by the gay Jewish sexologist Magnus Hirschfeld. However, on 6 October 1942, the film Die Entlassung (\\"The Dismissal\\") was released in Germany dealing with Bismarck's downfall in 1890, which features a scene where Wilhelm II is portrayed as a homosexual who makes \\"coy advances\\" to another homosexual playing the piano.Hull, David Stewart Film in the Third Reich, New York: Simon & Schuster, 1973 page 185. The piano- playing homosexual who sings as well as he plays the piano is not named, but the character is evidently meant to be Eulenburg, who often entertained Wilhelm with his piano playing and singing. ==Marriage and family== On 20 November 1875, at Stockholm, Eulenburg married Augusta Sandels (Stockholm, 12 May 1853 – Liebenberg, 14 December 1941), daughter of Samuel August, the last Count Sandels, and of his wife, Hedvig Henrietta Emilie Augusta Tersmeden. Count Johan August Sandels was her grandfather. They had eight children: * Philipp Graf zu Eulenburg (Wulkow, 16 November 1876 – Berlin, 28 June 1878) * Astrid Gräfin zu Eulenburg (Berlin, 25 March 1879 – Paris, 23 March 1881) * Alexandrine (Adine) Elise Klara Antonia Gräfin zu Eulenburg (Liebenberg, 1 July 1880 – Friedelhausen, 3 February 1957), married at Liebenberg, 15 June 1910 Eberhard Graf von Schwerin (Weilburg, 11 July 1882 – Giessen, 4 April 1954) * Friedrich Wend 2.

Seoul: Ilchokak, 1984. pp. 212 ==History== During the Joseon Dynasty the navy and maritime operations fell into disuse, while fishing ships continued to operate and prosper. Because of the relative peace during the Joseon dynasty, the entire military itself weakened and was ignored. Also, with the policy of Korean kings that emphasized agriculture and Confucian ideals, the Korean navy along with the rest of the Korean military weakened steadily. However, in 1419, King Sejong sent Yi Jongmu to raid the Japanese on Tsushima Island in the Oei Invasion as a response to Japanese Wokou raids on Korean coastal cities. Yi took 227 Korean ships and approximately 17,000 soldiers, landed, attacked, and plundered Japanese pirate settlements on Tsushima Island. The So clan, the ruling family of Tsushima requested negotiations. In the diplomatic exchanges that followed, Korea permitted the So clan to continue trade with Korean coastal harbors under the condition that the activities of Japanese pirates be suppressed. Korea eventually developed strong wooden ships called panokseons that made up the backbone of the Joseon navy. In the 15th century, under the decree of King Sejong, more powerful cannons were developed and tested. Used on battleships, the cannons proved to be a great success during actions against Japanese pirate ships. Panokseons and the Korean navy were most widely used during the Japanese invasions of Korea (1592-1598), particularly under the leadership of Admiral Yi Sun-sin. Admiral Yi also developed the turtle ship, based upon an older design.The Kobukson, or Turtle Ship, was the world’s first armor plated warship. By the end of 19th century, the Joseon Navy had no significant naval force\\"The First US Naval Attaché to Korea\\". _Central Intelligence Agency Official Website_. Retrieved May 6, 2007. other than coast defense fortresses. Although there was an attempt to modernize the navy by establishing a royal naval school, the Joseon Navy was brought to an end in 1895. In 1903, the government of the Korean Empire purchased its first modern war ship, the Yangmu.\\"제3장 군사학교의 설립과 사관양성 (PDF Format)\\" . _Ministry of National Defense - Institution for Military History Compilation Official Website_. Retrieved May 1, 2007. Korean naval tradition was disrupted after Korea was annexed by the Empire of Japan in 1910 until 1945. ==Ships== Besides the turtle ship and the panokseon, the Joseon Navy used many other ships: *Hyeopseon () was used primarily for reconnaissance. *Bigeodo () small and fast. It almost completely disappeared after the Imjin War. *Geomseon () evolved from the Goryeo-era gwaseon (과선; 戈船). There were iron spikes on the roof like the turtle ship, but the geomseon was smaller, and usually had a complement of about 15 people. They also used fishing boats for reconnaissance and sometimes in battle. ==See also== *Joseon Dynasty *Joseon naval campaigns of 1592 *List of naval battles during the Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–1598) *Yi Sun-sin *Won Gyun *Turtle Ship *Panokseon ==References== * Stephen Turnbull, \\"Samurai Invasion - Japan's Korean War 1592-1598\\", Cassel & Co, 2002 ==External links== * Yi Sun- sin - EnCyber (in Korean) Category:Naval history of Korea Category:Joseon dynasty ","title":"Joseon Navy"},{"id":"2547591","text":"Cospaia is an Italian hamlet (frazione) of the comune of San Giustino in the Province of Perugia, Umbria. ==History== The village was an independent republic from 1440 to 1826, when it was divided between the Grand Duchy of Tuscany and the Papal States. ==Geography== Cospaia is located in the northern suburbs of San Giustino, by a lake and next to the borders of Umbria with Tuscany.

(РЕЙТАРИ). Encyclopedia of History of Ukraine Contemporary to the Cuirassier and Lancer cavalry, they used smaller horses, for which reason they were also known as Ringerpferde (corresponding to the French Argoulets). They were originally recruited in the North German Plain west of the Oder at the time of the Schmalkaldic War of 1546/7. The Reiter raised firearms to the status of primary weapons for cavalry, as opposed to earlier Western European heavy cavalry which primarily relied upon melee weapons. A Reiter's main weapons were two or more pistols and a sword; most Reiters wore helmets and cuirasses and often additional armor for the arms and legs; sometimes they also carried a long cavalry firearm known as an arquebus or a carbine (although this type of horsemen soon became regarded as a separate class of cavalry—the arquebusier or in Britain harquebusier). In general, commanders expected Reiters to be able to engage their opponents both with firearms and with swords. In the 16th century and up to about 1620, Reiters often formed up in deep blocks and used their firearms in a caracole attack in the hopes of disordering enemy infantry before charging home and engaging in hand-to-hand combat. However, enterprising commanders such as Henry IV (died 1610) and Gustavus Adolphus (died 1632) preferred to employ their Reiters and other heavy cavalry in a more aggressive manner, ordering them to press the charge and fire their pistols at point-blank range (especially against well-armored enemies) or to use their swords instead. Using either or both of these tactics, Reiters could be incredibly effective when properly employed. A particular case in point is the Battle of Turnhout in 1597, where a force of Dutch Reiters under Maurice of Nassau defeated the opposing Spanish cavalry and then successfully engaged the Spanish infantry with a combination of pistol volleys and sword-in-hand charges. The Reiters mostly consisted of Germans and served in the armies of the German states, in Sweden as \\"ryttare\\", in Poland as Polish: \\"rajtaria\\", and elsewhere. Reiter regiments () also operated in Russian armies between the 1630s and the early 18th century (see Regiments of the new order). In the later 17th century the Reiters gradually merged into generic cavalry regiments and were no longer seen as a distinct class of horseman. ==References== Category:Cavalry Category:Military units and formations of the Early Modern era Category:Military history of the Holy Roman Empire ","title":"Reiter"},{"id":"2547617","text":"{ +T-class ferry } BC Ferries operates two T-class ferries for use on small inter-island routes. They have raised bows, which make it easier for the ships to travel in the rough seas often found on British Columbia's central coast. The ferries carry 30 cars and 150 passengers. Both were built in 1969. They were originally owned and operated by BC's Ministry of Transportation and Highways until 1985, when the Ministry's saltwater ferries and routes were transferred to BC Ferries, including the T class. The two T-class ferries are Tachek and Quadra Queen II. == Ships in class == MV Tachek was built in 1969 in Vancouver, British Columbia by Allied Shipbuilders. She was originally named Texada Queen and was used on the Powell River-Blubber Bay route, serving her namesake Texada Island. She was renamed Tachek in 1977, and continued serving Texada Island until 1979 when the larger North Island Princess replaced her. Since then, she has served as an auxiliary vessel, providing additional capacity where demand is needed and serving as a backup ferry when other ferries are out of service. As of 2013, she is used on the route between Denman Island and Hornby Island from mid-fall to mid-spring, and serves as a backup vessel for the rest of the year, tied up at Blubber Bay when not in use. On 15 December 2012, Tachek was removed from service to undergo a nine- month life-extension project. Since then, Tachekhas been used on the Heriot Bay (Quadra) to Whaletown (Cortes). MV Quadra Queen II was built in 1969, also by Allied Shipbuilders in Vancouver, British Columbia. She replaced the original Quadra Queen on the Campbell River–Quathiaski Cove (Quadra Island) route. Quadra Queen was renamed Cortes Queen and later . In the late-1980s or early-1990s, Quadra Queen II was relocated to the Port McNeill-Alert Bay- Sointula route. As of April 2013, the ferry still serves this route. From April 2010 to May 2011, Quadra Queen II underwent a life extension project meant to prepare the vessel for another 20 years of service. ==References== Category:Ferry classes Category:1960s ships ","title":"T-class ferry"},{"id":"2547626","text":"Example of a nipple ring having migrated over a four-year period Piercing migration is the process that occurs when a body piercing moves from its initial location. This process can be painful or go unnoticed, until it has progressed. Given enough time, a ring may migrate entirely outside of the skin, although it may only migrate a small amount and come to rest. ==Potential causes and effects of migration== The effects of migration can vary widely. The most common form of migration is the way that heavy small gauge earrings will migrate downwards out of the earlobe, as is common in older women who have worn earrings most of their lives. This is known as the \\"cheesecutter effect\\", as its action is easily compared to the method of cutting cheese with a fine wire. Contemporary body and ear piercing jewelry is much more balanced in its weight to gauge ratio, although migration is still possible with heavy jewelry, even if it is of large gauge. Play or movement of the area pierced or implanted can also lead to migration, but it's not likely. Sometimes this can occur without an open wound being created, as the fistula stretches in one direction, and tissue fills in behind it. This is not uncommon with tongue piercings, although the migration usually stops before the jewelry would exit the body. Damage to the tissue surrounding the piercing can also cause migration. A damaged piercing, much like a fresh piercing, must heal the fistula that it passes through, and the jewelry may start migrating in the direction of the wound, further damaging the fistula as it moves. Should the fistula heal, the migration may stop, although it may be inclined to continue migrating, as the re-healed area of tissue may not be as strong as the original fistula was. Migration may also be caused by the body rejecting the material that the jewelry is made of. Like a splinter or other foreign object, the body will try to push out foreign material, especially if it irritates the surrounding tissue. Contemporary body jewelry is made from surgical grade implant materials, so with proper aftercare during the healing phase and good hygiene, this is rare. Pressure, especially the pressure caused by improperly performed surface, navel, and eyebrow piercings often leads to migration. Proper, custom made jewelry can reduce the risk of migration associated with these piercings, although it cannot eliminate it. This type of migration is sometimes accompanied by rejection due to improper drainage due to the length of piercing, as dead tissue builds up in the healing fistula. ==Rejection rate== Rejection rate is a term used by the piercing industry. It applies to the chance of a piercing being forced out by the body. This is a body's natural reaction to a foreign object being inserted into the skin. This behavior can be witnessed with other objects such as splinters, road rash, or infections. With surface piercings being closer to the surface of the skin, the tendency to reject is higher, as it is easier for the body to force the jewelry out. ===Surface piercing rejection rates=== Surface piercings, such as a navel piercing, Christina piercing, eyebrow piercing, or a nape piercing, tend to have a higher rejection rate than piercings that pass through a deeper area of flesh or have holes on the opposite side of each other. Thus surface piercings stand in contrast to piercings such as tongue piercing, earrings, or nose piercings. ==References== Category:Body piercing ","title":"Piercing migration"},{"id":"2547645","text":"The Mount Suhora Observatory () is an astronomical observatory owned and operated by the Astronomy department of the Pedagogical University of Cracow.

He presided over a pivotal election in the 1990s. ==Life== Andrews was born in Cape Palmas, Liberia in 1926., His father, Lawrence Andrews, had impregnated a native girl and felt too ashamed to admit being the father of the child. Lawrence condemned the girl as a liar and left the area. He would not see his son again for nearly 40 years. Andrews grew up in abject poverty, but as a descendant of Americo-Liberian, being fair skinned through the blood of his father, he managed to use the perceived social status to get a scholarship to high school. Andrews excelled in school. Perhaps because he felt the need to nullify his father's complete rejection, he pushed himself and was valedictorian of every academic class he ever entered. His mother died in 1941 and he later said he was ashamed because part of him had always been embarrassed by the fact that his mother was an uneducated member of the ethnic and social underclass. In 1945 Andrews entered journalism school and graduated to become Liberia's most popular sports announcer. His play-by-play was so popular that there are still Liberians today who talk admiringly about his quips and speaking style. By 1949, Andrews was tired of sports casting. He felt that Liberia did not present enough opportunities for an ambitious young man, so he applied to attend university in the USA and was accepted to the University of Cincinnati, Ohio where he studied journalism. In the United States he excelled at school but was a bit of a playboy. By the end of his studies in 1954, he had gotten a son by a young African-American fellow student. Despite vowing to never do what his father had done, George denied being the father of the child and left the U.S. so that the mother could not force him to support the child. Esther Urey in formal dress at 1958 Back in Liberia, Andrews started an advertising business with the money he had saved while working in America. The business soon died from lack of prospects in the small backward African country, but through it he met R.D. Urey, the father of the woman who would later become his wife. Urey was a man of small stature but great power. He was mayor of what was at the time Liberia's second city, Careysburg. He also owned huge tracts of rubber trees leased out to the Firestone Rubber Company. The young George impressed the older Urey with his desire for learning and his drive. Soon, Andrews, with Urey, was attending meetings of Liberia's one and only political party, the True Whigs. Andrews was an excellent speaker, having been trained as a radio announcer, and impressed the big boys of the party. He was hired in 1958 as news anchor for the then fledgling government TV station. His style and the exposure of TV brought young Andrews fame. He married Esther Urey, the 4th of R.D. Ureys seven daughters in 1960. Some say the bride was already pregnant at the wedding, but Andrews always insisted that the child was born two months premature. Now married and respectable in Liberia's conservative society, George moved up the ranks at the Ministry of Information. On the election of William R. Tolbert in 1973, Andrews was appointed to the cabinet of the president as Minister of Information, Cultural Affairs, and Tourism. He now had eight children, not all of them by his wife. His infidelity brought a souring of relations between him and his wife's powerful family. But his wife loved him and protected him after Urey had decided the brash playboy should be brought down a notch. Andrews was now a powerful man in his own right. He built a three-story mansion in a fashionable part of Monrovia, the capital city, and moved in with his wife and all eight of his children. This was the beginning of the talk that George might be presidential material. Andrews himself made no bones that he was capable of holding any position in the government. R.D. Urey in 1947. ==The turning point== In 1976, at the prompting of his wife, Andrews contacted his father who was now an American citizen living in Pennsylvania, U.S.A. That episode made him desire to find his roots, so he made sort of a pilgrimage to his birthplace in Liberia, Cape Palmas. The experience left him changed forever. He saw people who had not progressed in all the time he had been gone. They lived in constant and backbreaking poverty. He would later tell his wife that all his sins came back to him then, especially how he had treated the American mother of his first child. As minister of Tourism and Cultural Affairs he was able to help his hometown, and was soon diverting government projects and aid their way. He apologized to the mother of his first child, and sent for his son in the U.S. to come and live with him in Liberia. Andrews was now preoccupied with the poverty of his hometown. He wrote in a letter to his father, :It's like I have only just awakened and am seeing all this poverty and suffering for the first time. I cannot believe people live like this, or that others allow them to. He felt uncomfortable with his part and place in the cabinet of a political system he now thought of as evil. But with 8 children and a wife, he was torn between following his new ideals and the reality of having to support his family. In January 1980, Andrews gave an interview to Johnathan Raffle, a young man he had recruited into the ministry's broadcasting wing. The young man, knowing of Andrews' new thinking on the situation in the country, asked him point blank what he felt about the fact that the economy of the country was controlled by Lebanese traders who had settled in Liberia after fleeing war in Lebanon. It was common knowledge in the country that the Lebanese community paid off the President to keep their favored position. Andrews felt that he could not dodge the question. He expounded a startlingly frank diatribe against the evils of a government that oppressed its own people and kept foreign parasites protected so that they could continue to \\"suck the blood of the people.\\" The interview caused a sensation in the country. For the Lebanese community and the ruling class, he was a Judas, a turncoat seeking personal fame and power. To the indigenous masses, he was an instant hero, the rare man in Africa who is willing to speak the truth in public. The president, under pressure from the Lebanese, demanded a retraction and apology from his Information Minister. Andrews refused, and in a second interview, said that \\"it would be as evil to apologize for truth, as it would be to lie.\\" President Tolbert was incensed, and fired him the next day. He was blacklisted in the tiny nation and had to leave the country to find employment. In June 1980 his entire family moved to neighboring Côte d'Ivoire where he took a job as head of the secretariat for the African Development Bank. Writing to his son at this time, Andrews said what hurt him most was that through it all, not one of the friends in the cabinet he had known since his teenage years stood up to back him or support him. Less than 7 months later, the president was dead, tortured and assassinated in his own bedroom, and the 13 ministers of his cabinet lined up and shot by a group of military men led by Samuel K. Doe, a master sergeant in the Liberian Army. A delegation from the coup leaders who had taken control of the government went to Côte d'Ivoire to offer the former minister the position as Liberian Ambassador to the United States, but Andrews declined, not wanting to work with people he believed were as oppressive as the ones they removed. The country slowly degenerated into civil war, and Doe was himself killed in the same mansion in which he killed Tolbert. A peace deal was signed in Liberia in 1992. With that, Andrews returned home to find that his stature as an honest speaker of truth had grown. When the country decided to hold elections, it was near unanimous that he was the only person viewed by the people as having both the intelligence and the integrity to run the elections. Most historians attribute Liberia's peaceful transition into democracy to his leadership. Andrews died on September 3, 1997, of a heart attack right after returning excess money to the Nigerian government which had partly financed the Liberian election. His decision to return the money was not viewed favorably by many in positions of power and rumors persist today that his death was not natural. Andrews will be remembered as a man who rose above his faults to become a champion of his people. He was buried at Palm Grove Cemetery in Monrovia. ==References== Category:1926 births Category:1997 deaths Category:Americo-Liberian people Category:People of Americo-Liberian descent Category:People from Montserrado County Category:Government ministers of Liberia ","title":"George Henry Andrews"},{"id":"2547688","text":"Dmitriyev (), also known as Dmitriyev-Lgovsky (), is a town and the administrative center of Dmitriyevsky District of Kursk Oblast, Russia, located on the Svapa River (Dnieper's basin), on the Moscow–Kiev highway, northwest of Kursk, the administrative center of the oblast.

Moltke was forced to leave the military service. == Biography == In 1896 Moltke, a 'confirmed bachelor', married Nathalie von Hayden ('Lilly'), a woman more than twenty years his junior. The couple soon became estranged, with Moltke's physician later alleging that Lilly had physically attacked Moltke several times. The couple were eventually divorced in 1902 (the formal divorce proceedings took several years to conclude). == The Harden–Eulenburg affair == In 1907 the journalist Maximilian Harden publicly accused Moltke and Philipp, Prince of Eulenburg-Hertefeld of a homosexual relationship. At this time, homosexual acts between men were illegal per Paragraph 175 of the German Criminal Code. Accusations and counter-accusations quickly multiplied. Later that year, Moltke sued Harden for libel. His ex-wife Lilly (who had since remarried and was now called Lilly von Elbe) voluntarily testified against him. Magnus Hirschfeld, a physician and sexologist who supported the legalization of homosexuality in Germany, also testified that he believed Moltke to be homosexual. The court sensationally acquitted Harden and concluded that he had been telling the truth about Moltke's sexuality. However, the verdict was voided due to faulty procedure. In 1908 Harden was retried, and this time he was found guilty of libel against Moltke. == German Press reaction == After the first trial, the German press were sympathetic to Moltke.

When his mentor died, Ferrata and another pupil, Domenico Guidi, completed Algardi's unfinished Vision of Saint Nicholas at San Nicola da Tolentino; ultimately, the innovative arrangement of two independent but interactive groups derives from the original design by Algardi. While Ferrata's initial work still owes much to Algardi, Ferrata distanced himself from the classical serenity found in the work of his mentor and Francois Duquesnoy, and moved towards the expressive emotionalism of Gian Lorenzo Bernini. He is best known for two works in Sant'Agnese in Agone in Rome, the Bernini-inspired The Death of St. AgnesLa Scultura Italiana - Ercole Ferrata (1660–64) as well as the marble relief Stoning of St EmerenzianaWeb Gallery of Art, image collection, virtual museum, searchable database of European fine arts (1100-1850) (1660). The latter has a restraint influenced by his mentor, Algardi, although the superior half was completed by one of his pupils, Leonardo Retti in 1689-1709.Wittkower R. p.310 Under the leadership of Bernini, he sculpted the Angel with a Cross for the Ponte Sant'Angelo and reportedly completed the elephant statue holding the obelisk in front of Santa Maria sopra Minerva. Early in his career he worked with Cosimo Fanzago and Giuliano Finelli in Naples. He also made the statue of Saint Catherine of Siena for the Chigi Chapel in the Duomo di Siena. With Francesco Aprile he sculpted Sant'Anastasia in Santa Anastasia in Rome, another statue resembling Bernini's famous dying Beata Ludovica Albertoni. In 1673, when Cosimo III, Grand Duke of Tuscany established an informal academy in the Villa Madama in Rome, to give promising students an opportunity to study from antiquities, he placed it under the direction of Ercole Ferrata and the painter Ciro Ferri, who had been collaborating with Pietro da Cortona in frescoes for Palazzo Pitti.Haskell & Penny, p. 55 In 1677, when the Grand Duke arranged to get his antique sculptures released from Rome, Ercole Ferrata was recalled to Florence to unpack and see to them. \\"A rather colourless, plodding sculptor whose gifts were best displayed in executing or imitating the conceptions of more imaginative artists, Ferrata nonetheless enjoyed a deserved reputation as an authority on the antique\\".Haskell & Penny 1981:57 When a headless torso had been discovered a few years previously, during the opening of a new road to the Santa Maria in Vallicella, the order of the Oratorians who owned the torso sent it to be \\"restored\\" by Ercole Ferrata, who essentially created the Faun Carrying a Kid, which after purchase by Queen Christina, was sold in 1724 to Philip V of Spain.Today in the Prado Ferrata is less known for the documented fact that he provided the elegant arms for the Venus de' Medici.Haskell & Penny 1981:326. \\"He showed remarkable flair in making just the kind of attractive additions to a mutilated statue which most appealed to connoisseurs\\", according to Francis Haskell and Nicholas Penny.Haskell & Penny, cat. 37, p. 211 He worked along with Bernini creating a much admired fountain for the gardens palace of the Count of Ericeira in Lisbon - unfortunately lost along with the palace, great library and art collection due to the great Lisbon earthquake of 1755.Angela Delaforce, Jennifer Montagu, Paulo Varela Gomes and Miguel Soromenho, \\"A Fountain by Gianlorenzo Bernini and Ercole Ferrata in Portugal\\", The Burlington Magazine 140 No. 1149 (December 1998), pp. 804-811. Of the generation after Bernini and Algardi, which included Domenico Guidi and Antonio Raggi, Ferrata led the most successful studio for training sculptors. Ferrata's pupils included the Florentine Foggini as well as Caffà, who acted as Ercole's studio assistant. In addition he trained Leonardo Retti, Francesco Aprile, Michele Maglia, Filippo Carcani, Giuseppe Mazzuoli, Lorenzo Ottoni, and Giuseppe Rusnati.Wittkower, R. pp. 315-316 Among his last pupils was Camillo Rusconi, who moved to Rome in 1686 to work briefly in Ferrata's studio.

It is used in the Indian subcontinent for all sizes of gatherings and can be religious, commercial, cultural or sport-related.

This led to their export around the world by South Asian diaspora communities wishing to bring something of that tradition to their new countries.

One can find a Nepalese mela in the USA, or a Bengali mela in London, such as the Boishakhi Mela. The Boishakhi Mela is the largest open-air Asian festival in Europe and the largest Bengali festival outside of Bangladesh. After the Notting Hill Carnival, it is the second- largest street festival in the United Kingdom attracting over 80,000 visitors from across the country. For many melas are a wider intercultural (though mainly Asian) festival incorporating music, dance, food and other aspects of mainstream culture. Since the 1980s an increasing number of melas have regularly been held in larger towns outside south Asia, especially in the UK and North America. The larger melas tend to be those with larger ethnic minority populations, but many melas are held in communities with small South Asian diasporas. Community ownership of these melas is important to the south Asian communities who see them as opportunities to share their cultural heritage with the mainstream. They are opportunities for bridge building and community building and can perform a strong socially cohesive function. More successful outside-of-Asia melas tend to have a strongly diversified funding base with private/public/third sector collaboration. Public money is often spent on the melas.

They can thus rebound with an appreciable fraction of their original force. ==Spaldeens== a modern-day Spaldeen Rubber balls such as the Spaldeen (a corruption of Spalding, the manufacturer), about the size of a tennis ball and often colored pink, have been manufactured since the 1930s and remain so into the 21st century. They were fundamental to the development of American street games such as stickball, in addition to other uses in play. Other manufacturers have made similar balls, such as the Pensie Pinkie. ==Superballs== A superball A superball or power ball is a bouncy ball composed of a type of synthetic rubber (originally a hard elastomer Polybutadiene alloy named Zectron) invented in 1964, which has a higher coefficient of restitution (0.92) than older balls such as the Spaldeen so that when dropped from a moderate height onto a level hard surface, it will bounce nearly all the way back up. They were first sold by the Wham-O toy company under the name Super Ball, which remains their trademark. Superballs are often smaller than a Spaldeen. ==Other bouncy balls== Skyball is a brand of hollow medium-sized bouncy ball filled with a mix of helium and compressed air, claimed by the manufacturer to have particularly good bounce characteristics. Nerf balls, introduced in 1970, are also small balls that bounce, but they have a lower coefficient of restitution than a typical bouncy ball. Balls similar in size and composition to Spaldeens, but featuring a plethora of designs (such as a baseball pattern, miniature basketball and soccer ball patterns, and so forth) are offered by many companies. Due to their low cost per unit, bouncy balls with logos or other designs are sometimes used as promotional merchandise. Bouncy balls may, by means of fluorescence, chemiluminescence, or motion- activated LEDs, emit light; such balls are called glow balls. Balls composed of many rubber bands, or bouncy balls made of borax, glue, and cornstarch, are sometimes homemade. Bouncy balls are often used in juggling. ==See also== *Physics of a bouncing ball ==References== * ==Further reading== * * ==External links== * History of the Superball Category:Physical activity and dexterity toys Category:Balls Category:Rubber toys ","title":"Bouncy ball"},{"id":"2547806","text":"WHQT (105.1 MHz \\"Hot 105 FM\\") is a commercial FM radio station owned by Cox Media Group and airing an urban adult contemporary radio format. The station is licensed to Coral Gables and it serves South Florida including the Miami- Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood radio market. WHQT's studios and offices are located in Hollywood along with its sister stations WEDR, WFLC, and WFEZ. It is licensed as a Class C0 station with an effective radiated power (ERP) of 100,000 watts, broadcasting from a transmitter site in Miami Gardens, which also serves as the site for eleven other FM radio stations and five TV stations. The station uses HD Radio technology and offers contemporary Gospel music, branded as \\"Joy 105,\\" on the HD2 channel. Hot 105 airs the nationally syndicated Rickey Smiley Morning Show from 6 to 10 a.m. ==History== ===Early Years=== On November 15, 1958, 105.1 FM signed on as WVCG-FM.Broadcasting Yearbook 1960 page A-130 It simulcast its AM sister station, 1070 WVCG (now 1080 WQOS), the \\"Voice of Coral Gables.\\" WVCG was the first classical music station in Florida and WVCG-FM was the first FM station in Florida to broadcast in stereo. In 1968, the station became WYOR, \\"YOuR beautiful music station,\\" airing mostly instrumental versions of popular songs and music from Broadway and Hollywood. WYOR promoted itself using an FM radio dial card, listing WYOR at 105.1 along with the dial positions of other FM stations in the Miami radio market. The card was updated each year. The station enjoyed a grandfathered license, allowing it to transmit with an effective radiated power (ERP) of 160,000 watts while most Miami FM stations ran with much less power. Its signal really wasn't much stronger than other stations because its antenna was under sixty meters (200 feet) height above average terrain (HAAT). The grandfathered power ended when the transmitter was relocated to a 600-foot tower in downtown Miami in the early 1970s. The station's power then dropped to 100,000 watts, similar to other Miami FM outlets. In 1983, the station was sold to EZ Communications which changed its call sign to WEZI as \\"E-Z 105.\\" The station continued with its easy listening sound, although it began making the transition to a soft adult contemporary format by reducing the instrumentals and adding more vocals. But by the mid 1980s, the audience for the easy listening format was aging, while advertisers prefer younger to middle-aged listeners. ===Hot 105=== On January 10, 1985, at 6 a.m., the station changed to a hybrid CHR/Urban Contemporary (or \\"CHUrban\\") format as WHQT under their new moniker \\"Hot 105\\". \\"Yo Little Brother\\" by Nolan Thomas was the first song for WHQT. The station's initial musical slant was described as \\"triethnic,\\" playing a mix of R&B;, Freestyle Dance, Hip-Hop, and Pop hits, all targeted at Miami's young black, white, and Hispanic audience, but by 1987, WHQT moved a bit closer to Mainstream Top 40, playing a larger dose of contemporary artists popular at the time such as Rick Astley, Madonna and Def Leppard. Another notable feature of the station during this era was a no DJ music intensive daypart from 9am to 5pm, predating the current trend in automated jockless radio. But with fierce competition from Y-100 and Power 96, Hot 105 dropped their highly successful Mainstream Top 40/CHUrban format and went into a full-fledged Urban Contemporary format in late 1988 with the new slogan The fresh new sound of Hot 105. The main competitor was soon to be future sister station, WEDR (99 Jamz). The two stations competed for the 18-49 African-American demographic until 1992, when WHQT evolved to Urban Adult Contemporary. Around that time, Cox purchased both stations which led to the end of their competition. For some time, Hot 105 was the only Adult R&B;/Soul station in the market until October 2006, when it gained competition from WMIB, a former Hip Hop station that moved to Urban AC under the ownership of Clear Channel Communications (now iHeartMedia, Inc.). WMIB returned to Urban Contemporary in late 2008. ===Tom Joyner=== Hot 105 was one of the original affiliates of the nationally syndicated Tom Joyner Morning Show when it debuted in 1994. The show now has about 100 affiliates around the U.S. Joyner has announced he will be retiring from the show in 2019. ===NAB Radio Award=== WHQT has been committed to public service and excellence in the Miami community for over three decades. In 2014, WHQT won the prestigious NAB Marconi Radio Award for \\"Urban Station of the Year\\" under Director of Branding and Programming Phil Michaels-Trueba, and then again in 2017 and recently in 2019. Michaels-Trueba has been associated with Hot 105 on and off since 1991 when he started as an intern and rose through the ranks thru 1999 and returned as Program Director in March 2006. ===Former Program Directors=== Previous program directors include Jeff Tyson, Bob McKay, Bill Tanner, Keith Isley, Hector Hannibal, Tony Kidd, Derrick Brown, Tony Fields and Duff Lindsey. ==References== ==External links== *Hot 105 FM Website * HQT Category:Urban adult contemporary radio stations in the United States Category:Cox Media Group Category:Radio stations established in 1958 Category:Coral Gables, Florida Category:1958 establishments in Florida ","title":"WHQT"},{"id":"2547812","text":"Flowers blooming at the Horticulture Gardens spring 2005 The Purdue University Horticulture Gardens are botanical gardens at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana in the United States. ==History== The gardens were founded in 1982.

Tennis on covered courts was agreed initially for the 1912 Games, with competitions run for gentlemen's singles and doubles, ladies' singles and mixed doubles.Official Report (1913): p. 616. The outdoor tournament was confirmed once the Östermalm Athletic Grounds were completed in late 1911, with the plans modified to have both indoor and outdoor tournaments.Official Report (1913): p. 617. Six countries sent players for the covered court competitions, with representatives from Sweden, Great Britain, Denmark, France, Australasia and Bohemia appearing. Included in this lineup was Australasia's only competitor, the New Zealander Anthony Wilding, who was also the reigning Wimbledon gentlemen's champion.Official Report (1913): p. 618. The indoor knockout competition started on 5 May, and continued as expected until the semi final round where Wilding was beaten by Britain's Charles P. Dixon.Official Report (1913): p. 620. The British player met Frenchman André Gobert in the final, but Gobert was victorious over the Englishman in straight sets. Wilding took the bronze medal in a playoff against another British player, Arthur Lowe.Official Report (1913): p. 621. The outdoors tennis competition saw seventy players enter from twelve nations. However, Great Britain did not enter any competitors as the dates of the outdoor competition clashed with the 1912 Wimbledon Championships despite attempts by the British authorities to convince the Olympic organizing committee to change the dates. Other noted tennis players including Anthony Wilding, André Gobert and Arthur Gore refused to compete at the Olympics and instead attended Wimbledon.Official Report (1913): p. 630. The gold and silver medals in the gentlemen's singles ended up being decided between two South Africans, with Charles Winslow and Harold Kitson playing each other. Winslow won the match and the gold medal, 7–5, 4–6, 10–8, 8–6.Official Report (1913): p. 633.

Kehoe of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis Deflation and Depression: Is There an Empirical Link? This had a positive effect on the economy in general, as the purchasing power improved. There were several so called depressions during the period that were actually profit recessions. Many businesses suffered, such as warehousing, especially in the London area, due to improvements in transportation, like efficient steam shipping and the opening of the Suez Canal, and also because of the international telegraph network. Displaced workers found new employment in the expanding economy as real incomes grew. By contrast to the mild deflation of the so-called Great Deflation, the deflation of the 1930s Great Depression was so severe that deflation today is associated with depressions, although economic data are not quite as clear on the matter. ==Productivity caused deflation== The Great Deflation occurred at the beginning of the period sometimes called the Second Industrial Revolution. It was characterized by dramatic increases in productivity made possible by the transition from agriculture to industrialization in the leading economies. The new leading industries were Bessemer and open hearth steel, railroads, the machinery industry, efficient steam shipping and animal powered agricultural mechanization. The prices of most basic commodities and mass-produced goods fell almost continuously; however, nominal wages remained steady, resulting in a pronounced and prolonged rise in real wages, disposable income and savings - essentially giving birth to the middle class. Goods produced by craftsmen, as opposed to in factories, did not decrease in price. ==Deflation with increasing gold supply== The Great Deflation occurred despite an increase in the world's gold supply, which William Stanley Jevons predicted would result in inflation. ==See also== *Long Depression *Productivity improving technologies (historical) == References == Category:1870s economic history Category:1880s economic history Category:1890s economic history Category:Economic history of the United States de:Große Deflation ","title":"The Great Deflation"},{"id":"2547892","text":"Scarlett Chorvat (born August 25, 1972 in Bratislava, Slovakia) is a Slovak American actress.

Wells campaigned aggressively against incumbent Shelley Moore Capito, claiming that she was hypocritical in only agreeing to one debate when, in the 2000 Congressional Campaign, she had urged her opponent to debate in every county in the Congressional district. Despite a stronger than expected showing by Wells, Capito maintained her seat. In 2006, Wells was elected to the West Virginia Senate, representing the 8th district.

OutFront Minnesota also assisted the PFund Foundation with the 2012 Twin Cities LGBT Aging Needs and Assessment Survey Report. == Notable Movement and Actions == === Marriage === OutFront Minnesota, with the support of Sen. Allan Spear and Rep. Karen Clark, led the effort to amend the state's Human Rights Act to include sexual orientation and gender identity, a change which was achieved in 1993.Preston, Joshua. \\"Allan Spear and the Minnesota Human Rights Act.\\" Minnesota History 65 (2016): 76-87. OutFront Minnesota also led a successful three-year campaign to defeat an anti-equality constitutional amendment to bar Minnesota's same-sex couples from marrying. On May 14, 2013, there was a 37-30 bipartisan vote to allow same-sex couples to marry Executive Director Monica Meyer stated on the matter, \\"We want to thank House Speaker Thissen, Senate Majority Leader Bakk and all of the legislators who voted yes -- and, of course, Governor Dayton who has been so supportive of LGBT equality. We also want to thank each and every person who dedicated their time and energy to make this happen.\\" OutFront Minnesota worked with individuals to use personal stories to lobby the Minnesota legislature. OutFront Minnesota helped Minnesota become the twelfth state to legalize same-sex marriage. === Safe Schools === Youth at Mark Dayton Safe Schools Act signing Before the Safe School Act was signed into law 2014, Minnesota had relatively weak anti-bullying policies. The \\"Safe and Supportive school Act\\" was passed on April 4, 2014 with a 36-31 vote after hours of long debate in the Minnesota Senate. OutFront Minnesota lobbied the state of Minnesota legislature for education reform. Anti-bullying legislation became a larger issue within the state of Minnesota, as a result of a string of bullying incidents within Anoka County. The bullying incidents became so severe within the county that the United States Judicial department became involved. The Safe and Support School Act protected from; religious, racial, gender identity, and sexual orientation discrimination. The act does not mandate private or home school to follow the law. After hours of debate the Safe and Supportive Act was passed. A compromise that occurred that the law no longer required school to report and collect date about these bullying cases. Additionally under the compromise, school districts did not have train volunteers. Much of the opposition toward the legislation came from the Minnesota Republican Party. This contention spurred from the cost of the law, and inclusion of sexual orientation. The estimated cost of the Safe and Support Schools Act was to around $19 billion. === Transgender Rights === The American Civil Liberties Union represented OutFront Minnesota and Evan Thomas in a case deciding whether Medical Assistance (MA), Minnesota's Medicaid program, covers gender affirmation surgeries for transgender individuals. A judge in the U.S. District Court in Minnesota ruled in their favor on November 14, 2016, that MA covers gender affirmation surgeries in the state of Minnesota. ==See also== * LGBT rights in Minnesota * List of LGBT rights organizations * Same-sex marriage in Minnesota ==References== ==External links== *Outfront Minnesota Online Category:1987 establishments in Minnesota Category:Equality Federation Category:LGBT political advocacy groups in Minnesota Category:Non-profit organizations based in Minnesota Category:Organizations based in Minnesota Category:Organizations established in 1987 Category:Organizations that support same-sex marriage ","title":"OutFront Minnesota"},{"id":"2547911","text":"Peter Willey (born 6 December 1949) is a former English cricketer, who played as a right-handed batsman and right-arm offbreak bowler. In and out of the England team, he interrupted his international career for three years by taking part in the first of the England players' South African rebel tours in 1982. After his playing career ended, he became a Test umpire. ==Playing career== As his career developed, Willey became a leading exponent of the \\"open stance\\" style of batting, where the batsman looks squarely at the bowler, rather than the traditional \\"side-on\\" style, looking past his own shoulder at the bowler. Known for his intimidating and moody image, and his ability to score runs off fast bowlers, he was constantly picked against the formidable West Indian pace attack, only to be dropped again for games against more gentle opposition.https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2009/feb/03/cricket-england- west-indies-2009-cricket He scored two hundreds against the West Indies, although his overall Test batting average ended at under 27. ==Umpiring career== Upon his retirement from playing cricket, Willey became an umpire, becoming responsible for international Test Matches in 1996. However, he declined an offer to join the Elite Panel of ICC Umpires in 2001 when it was established, citing family reasons.https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/cricket/international/3019922/Willey- refuses-to-join-elite-umpire.html Willey continued to umpire Test matches in England until 2015, when he turned 65.

While Wisden stated that there is no record of Johnston or anyone else actually saying this,Wisden archive Johnston's co-commentator, Henry Blofeld, recalled the incident as having taken place at The Oval in 1976.Test Match Special The comment is also attributed to Richie Benaud in a Television commentary in 1980 The story is sometimes told the other way around, with Willey bowling to Holding: however, Willey did not bowl to Holding in that particular match.

Born in Zaragoza, he obtained his degree in chemistry from the University of Zaragoza and received his doctorate in Madrid in 1917 for his thesis about spectrochemistry. In 1920, he began work as a researcher at Imperial College London. Examining the spectrum of the arc of manganese, he determined that the optical spectra of complex atoms consisted of groups of lines –which he called \\"multipletes\\"- between which existed certain characteristic regularities. Catalán demonstrated that study of the multipletes led to further understanding of the states of energy of atomic electrons. On the invitation of Arnold Sommerfeld, he worked at the University of Munich, and on the creation by the Rockefeller Foundation of the Institute of Physics and Chemistry (Madrid), in 1930 he was named head of the Spectroscopy Section. He was invited numerous times to work in the laboratories of the National Bureau of Standards (Washington, D.C.), Princeton University, and MIT. He published more than 70 scientific articles in specialized journals. In 1926, he received a prize from the Real Academia de Ciencias (Spain) and in 1930, the international Pelfort prize. He married Jimena Menéndez Pidal, the daughter of Royal Spanish Academy director Ramón Menéndez Pidal. Because of the military coup by General Francisco Franco in July 1936, he and his father in law were the subject of numerous misdemeanours. From 1950 onwards, he served as director of the Departamento de Espectros del Instituto de Óptica de Madrid (C.S.I.C.). In 1952, he served as advisor to the Joint Commission for Spectroscopy, the head body for this field. In 1954, he became a member of the Real Academia de Ciencias (Madrid). Catalán died in Madrid. The lunar crater Catalán is named after him. Based on certain conjectures of Miguel Catalan about rotational dynamics, his disciple and biographer Gabriel Barceló, years later, developed the Theory of Dynamic Interactions. The Government of the Comunidad de Madrid (Autonomous Region of Madrid) awards the Miguel Catalán Investigation Award in Science since 2005, to honor Catalán's memory. The award recognizes outstanding life accomplishments in research and science. The award winners each receive a medal, a citation and 42,000 Euros. Winners of this award are: José Elguero Bertolini (2005, chemist), Antonio Hernando Grande (2006, physicist), Amable Liñán Martínez (2007, aeronautical engineer), José Luis García Fierro (2008, chemist) and Miguel Francisco Sánchez Madrid (2009, biologist). Since 2008, a Miguel Catalán Investigation Award in Science for researchers under forty years is also given. The awards winners also receive a medal, a citation and 21,000 Euros. 50,000 Euros are also given to their institutions to fund their future work.

Kevin Sullivan is best known for detailed period movies such as the Anne of Green Gables series of films, his movie adaptation of Timothy Findley's novel The Piano Man's Daughter, feature films and TV-movies such as Under the Piano, Butter Box Babies, Sleeping Dogs Lie and the CBS mini-series Seasons of Love, as well as long-running television series such as Road to Avonlea and Wind at My Back. His films have been broadcast in over 150 countries. His production company Sullivan Entertainment has produced movies, mini-series and specials for CBS, PBS, Disney, Lifetime, Ion, INSP, Channel 4, BBC, ITV, ZDF and NHK. ==Early life== Sullivan began his film-making career at the early age of 24. His father, Glenn A. Sullivan, was a successful attorney and his uncle, Sen. Joseph A. Sullivan, was a prominent doctor with a seat in the Canadian senate. Sullivan strayed from following in either of their footsteps. His first foray into film-making was with a half-hour Hans Christian Andersen Christmas special, titled The Fir Tree (1979), of which he edited and also had a small acting role. From there Sullivan wrote, produced and directed Krieghoff (1979), a widely acclaimed docu-drama in French and English on the life of the prominent German artist and illustrator of 19th century Quebec. Sullivan graduated from the University of Toronto in 1979 with a Bachelor of Science in Biology. That year, he founded Sullivan Entertainment with Trudy Grant (to whom he is now married) and they created a successful international production and distribution company that has been operating for over thirty years. ==Career== In 1980 Sullivan wrote, produced, and directed Megan Carey (1980), a film about a young Irish immigrant indentured on a farm in 19th century Canada. His first feature film was The Wild Pony (1982), which he co-wrote, co-produced and directed, it became a turning point for Sullivan due to it having been the first feature-length movie to be made exclusively for pay-TV in Canada. In 1984 he purchased the rights to Anne of Green Gables, completing the screenplay for the four-hour miniseries in 1985 with co-writer Joe Wiesenfeld. He directed the production for CBC, Disney and PBS in 1985. Anne of Green Gables and its sequel were the highest rated dramatic productions to air in Canadian TV history.https://www.cbc.ca/archives/entry/anne-of-green-gables-tv- phenomenon Cinematic feature versions played in theatres in Japan for five years straight. Anne of Green Gables has been studied in US film schools as a model of TV Drama with a wide appeal to a wide variety of viewers. Part of Anne of Green Gables' immense attraction was its rich look, featuring painstakingly recreated sets and detailed costumes that imbued it with a magical reality. That look, or a variation on its theme, has become the hallmark of every Sullivan production since. The tremendous success of Anne of Green Gables, starring Megan Follows, Richard Farnsworth and Colleen Dewhurst led to three sequels: Anne of Green Gables – The Sequel (1987 aka Anne of Avonlea – US release) starring Follows, Dewhurst and Wendy Hiller, Anne of Green Gables: The Continuing Story (1998) and most recently Anne of Green Gables: A New Beginning (2009) starring Barbara Hershey and Shirley MacLaine. Sullivan penned all three sequel screenplays as well as the novel for Anne of Green Gables: A New Beginning. An educational, animated series Anne of Green Gables: The Animated Series produced for PBS Kids and Road to Avonlea produced for CBC and Disney, were each successful spin offs from the Anne of Green Gables franchise. Set in early 1900s Prince Edward Island, Road to Avonlea was the most popular and most lucrative drama series in Canadian TV history. Co- produced with a strong influence by Disney, Road to Avonlea was filmed on a 300-acre farm and in Sullivan's studio and back-lot in Toronto. In recent years, Road to Avonlea fans from around the world have organized Avonlea Conventions (Avcon) in Toronto to meet with stars of the show, tour filming locations and celebrate their love of the show. With Wind at My Back, the 67 episode depression-era series produced as a follow-up to Road to Avonlea, Sullivan created an entire 1930s town on his company's 1.5 acre studio backlot, one of the largest in Canada, located at Sullivan Entertainment's 60,000 square foot studio and sound-stages in Toronto, which the company continues to operate. Sullivan also has an accumulated thousands of items of period costumes, sets and props ranging from the 1860s to the 1960s. Inspired by a lifelong interest in Baroque Architecture and the beauty of Mozart's hometown of Salzburg, in 2006 (the \\"Mozart-Jahre\\") Sullivan decided to create a contemporary, English-language feature film of the composer's classic opera The Magic Flute, entitled Magic Flute Diaries. The film was a full-scale CGI production created like a variation of Sin City and 300 with elaborate studio green-screen production design. Special choreography sequences and backdrops were shot on location in palaces, monasteries and gardens in Austria and Germany. Sullivan also produced a companion documentary to Magic Flute Diaries titled Mozart Decoded, which takes a historical look at Mozart's involvement with the Freemasons and his genius as a composer. Sullivan productions have been seen in over 140 countries, starring such award-winning actors such as Colleen Dewhurst, Christopher Reeve, Meg Tilly, Eugene Levy, Treat Williams, Michael York, Madeline Kahn, Peter Coyote, Robby Benson, Bruce Greenwood, Maureen Stapleton, Faye Dunaway, Dianne Wiest, Diana Rigg, Kate Nelligan, Ryan Gosling, Zoe Caldwell, Peter Strauss, Rachel Ward, Hume Cronyn, Christopher Lloyd, Sam Waterston and Stockard Channing. Sullivan Entertainment's 1999 efforts to transition to a publicly traded company triggered a dispute with Lucy Maud Montgomery's heirs. Its prospectus informed potential investors that the shows based on Montgomery's work had been profitable, generating $35.7 million CAD in 1997 alone. However Montgomery's heirs had been told the shows had failed to turn a profit, so they sued. Sullivan counter-sued, for damage to his reputation. Sullivan successfully provided evidence that the Heirs of Montgomery had no reversionary copyright claims to the dramatic rights to the original novel they had sold him. The matter was eventually settled between the parties. Sullivan is a licensee of the Anne of Green Gables trademarks.Anne of Green Gables (1985 film)#Lawsuits Sullivan is currently writing and producing an adaptation of Timothy Findley's Famous Last Words (novel) about the kidnapping of the Duke and Duchess of Windsor in Lisbon in 1936, known as Operation Willi. He is also developing a film adaptation of \\"The Ballad of Blind Tom\\" based on the book by Deirdre O'Connell about the life of musical prodigy Blind Tom Wiggins.RJ Smith (February 1, 2009) https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-ca-blind-tom1-2009feb01-story.html ==Books== As a writer and art-enthusiast Sullivan is the author of Beyond Green Gables, a behind-the-scenes look at the production design and inspiration for his films. Sullivan's Publishing Division, Davenport Press, has released over 50 books. These titles are available as hard books and ebooks. They include novels Anne of Green Gables ~A New Beginning, a children's book series based on Anne of Green Gables: The Animated Series and an assortment of specialty coffee table books. == Other endeavors == Sullivan Entertainment owns and operates a four-acre studio/backlot facility in Toronto which holds and rents an assortment of props, set pieces and costumes that were used in Sullivan productions. Sullivan is also an art collector. This interest compelled him to produce the documentary Out of the Shadows. Narrated by Donald Sutherland, the documentary shows how new types of x-rays and digital imaging are allowing scientists to see beneath layers of paint to reveal and authenticate paintings by masters such as Rembrandt, Goya, Caravaggio and Van Gogh. Out of the Shadows closely follows the scientific journey of a group of material physicists and art historians during the attribution of Rembrandt's painting Old Man with a Beard at the Brookhaven National Synchrotron in Long Island, New York. The film premiered at The Metropolitan Museum in New York in June 2012. ==Awards and recognition== Having produced over 500 hours of movies and television in his thirty-year career he has also won hundreds of international awards, including three Emmy Awards, a Peabody Award for outstanding contribution to television, Gemini, Cable-Ace & Prix Jeunesse Awards. ===List of awards=== *George Foster Peabody Award *3 Emmy Awards *6 Emmy Award Nominations *5 Gemini Awards *8 Gemini Award Nominations *3 CableACE Awards *2 CableACE Nominations *Prix Jeunesse *TV Guide Parent's Choice Award *American TV Critics Award *3 Golden Apple Awards from the National Educational Media Competition *1 Ollie Award *European Jury Prize at the Umbriafiction TV Festival *Gold World Medal – New York Film Festival *Golden Gate Award *Gold Medal – New York International Film and Television Festival *ACT Award *Best Children's Production – Television Movie Awards ==Selected filmography== ===Director=== * Out of the Shadows (film, 2010) * Anne of Green Gables: A New Beginning (film, 2008) * Mozart Decoded (film, 2008) * Magic Flute Diaries (film, 2008) * Anne, Journey to Green Gables (animated film, 2005) * The Piano Man's Daughter (film, 2003) * Lantern Hill (film, 1990) * Looking for Miracles (film, 1989) * Anne of Avonlea (film 1987) * Anne of Green Gables (film, 1985) * The Wild Pony (film, 1982) * Krieghoff (film, 1981) * The Fir Tree (film 1980) ===Executive producer=== * Anne of Green Gables: A New Beginning (film, 2008) * Mozart Decoded (film, 2008) * Magic Flute Diaries (film, 2008) * Anne, Journey to Green Gables (animated film, 2005) * The Piano Man's Daughter (film, 2003) * Wind at My Back Christmas (film, 2001) * P.R.

As a result, there was a time when Cambodia was often referred to as Longvek by foreign travellers. After Ang Chan I defeated Sdach Kon he changed the capital city from Chaktomuk to Longvek in 1528. This new city was the capital of the Kingdom of Cambodia from 1528 to 1594. This city was sacked by the Siamese (Thai) in 1594 and then the Thai king chose his son to reign over Cambodia in 1594. Longvek was one of the greatest cities in Cambodia. ==History== During the 14th and 15th centuries Cambodia was in a state of eclipse. Following the almost total destruction of Angkor, Longvek was chosen as the new capital of the now minor state of Cambodia. Longvek was located halfway between Phnom Penh and the southern end of the Tonle Sap and it was chosen by King Ang Chan (1516–66) as his official capital. King Ang Chan ordered his palace to be built in Longvek in 1553. Longvek became the nation's capital in the 16th century after the civil war between Ney Khan and Ang Chan I. After Ponhea Chan's victory, he became the new king of Cambodia. Spanish and Portuguese adventurers and missionaries, like Blas Ruiz de Hernán González from Ciudad Real, first visited the kingdom during this period. Blas became a friend of King Satha of Longvek, who was well-disposed towards foreigners,Trudy Jacobsen, Lost goddesses and while in the kingdom got to know Portuguese adventurer Diogo Beloso from Amarante. The Iberians referred to Phnom Penh as \\"Churdumuco\\" and to Srei Santhor as \\"Sistor\\".The Philippine islands, 1493-1803 Not long thereafter Longvek was invaded by the Siamese ruler of Ayutthaya.Miguel de Jaque de los Rios Manzanedo Viaje de las Indias Orientales y Occidentales (Año 1606) King Naresuan of Siam conquered Longvek in 1593.Rajanubhab, D., 2001, Our Wars With the Burmese, Bangkok: White Lotus Co.

Situated a kilometre from the River Graney which flows into Lough Derg, it is an ancient settlement, noted for St Cronán's Church, said to be the oldest church in constant use in Ireland ==Location== The parish is in the barony of Tulla Upper and contains the villages of Scarriff and Tomgraney. It is and covers . The parish is rugged, with heights ranging from above sea level. It contains the Scariff river from its headstreams through Lough O'Grady to its mouth in Scarriff bay, Lough Derg. The village of Tuamgraney lies in such close proximity to the town of Scarriff that today the two are often considered to be one single settlement. There is a holy well dedicated to St. Cronán in the Currakyle townland. The nearby castle of Tuamgraney is still in a good state of preservation. ==History== According to legend,Information board \\"The Tuamgraney Heritage Trail\\" near St. Cronan's Church, viewed 25 June 2018 \\"Tuamgraney, or Tuam Greine, refers to both the mound of the sun and the tomb of Grian (Grian is Irish for sun). It is part of the ancient territory of Ui Dhanghaile, which incorporated neighbouring Scariff (Maynoe), Tuamgraney, Inis Cealtra (Holy Island) and Clonrush. Its geographic location by Lough Derg combined with its rich visual heritage makes Tuamgraney a most attractive location on the Lough Derg Way. Grian’s mound just outside the village marks the site of the first recorded suicide in Irish history. She ‘of the bright cheeks’ was a princess in pre-Christian Ireland, the daughter of a king who lived in the Sliabh Aughty mountains of East Clare. She was famous for her beauty but was of unnatural origin, ‘begotten by a human being on a sunbeam.’ Oh what imagination those ancients had! When told this she became depressed and drowned herself in a lake since called Lough Graney. Her body floated down the Graney River and was found near Lough Derg at a place known as Derrygraney – the wood of Grian. She was buried under a mound and the place became known as Tuamgraney or Tuam Greine, the tomb of Grian. Pillar stones today stand sentinel beside her mound. The Memorial Park honours those who fell during the Irish War of Independence. Dr Edward MacLysaght, Ireland’s foremost family historian, is also commemorated there.\\" Tuamgraney parish was founded by a saint named Cronán or Chronain, possibly the same Crónán Abbot and bishop who founded Roscrea. The place is mentioned in the annals from as early as 735 AD. There was a round tower, which was repaired by Brian Boru, and the castles of Tuamgraney and Scarriff. In 1560 both castles belonged to Edmond O'Grady. In 1633 Richard Boyle, 1st Earl of Cork, bought ten quarters of land north of the Graney River, including the castle and ironworks of Scarriff. These lands were combined with the old Moynoe parish to form the Scariff parish. Today the village of Scarriff is in the Roman Catholic parish of Scariff and Moynoe, part of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Killaloe. The southern part of Tuamgraney parish was combined with the medieval parish of Kilnoe early in the 18th century to form the parish of Bodyke. The Roman Catholic parish of Bodyke encompasses Bodyke, Kilnoe and Tuamgraney, also in the Killaloe Diocese. The Ó Cillín family were coarbs of Tuamgraney. The novelist Edna O'Brien was born in Tuamgraney in 1930. Noted genealogist Edward MacLysaght is buried at St. Cronan's Church. ===Annalistic references=== See Annals of Inisfallen (AI) * AI749 Kl.

It is the tallest completed building in Nevada. Designed by the Dallas based HKS, Inc., the hotel offers luxury in an Italian Renaissance ambiance. The hotel and casino are part of a larger complex (operated as one hotel) comprising the adjoining Venetian Resort and Casino and the Sands Convention Center, all of which are owned and operated by the Las Vegas Sands Corporation. This all-suite hotel offers the largest standard accommodations on the Las Vegas Strip at per guest room. The hotel complex is the second largest hotel in the world. In its first year of eligibility, The Palazzo was awarded the AAA Five Diamond Award for 2009, and has been awarded the honor every year since. After 2014, The Venetian and The Palazzo no longer receive AAA Diamond awards, as the management has refused further AAA inspections. ==History== ===Early history=== By 1949, the property was occupied by the Ottilia Villa Motel, the eight-room Park Lane Motel, and a restaurant named Maggie's. The Carousel Motel opened on the property in 1953, and the adjacent Park Lane Motel was incorporated into the Carousel around 1954. The Ottilia Villa was renamed as the Spanish Trail Motel in 1957. The Tam O'Shanter motel was built and opened in 1959, on of the land. The motel was owned by Bernie Zeldin, and was named after Illinois' Tam O'Shanter Golf Course, where Zeldin frequently played. The motel had 100 rooms, and featured a distinctive neon sign resembling a tam o' shanter cap. The sign was later donated to the city's Neon Museum. The Spanish Trail Motel went out of business around 1960. In 1962, it reopened as the Imperial 400 Motel. Zeldin declined numerous offers to purchase the Tam O'Shanter. Billionaire Howard Hughes attempted to purchase the Tam O'Shanter at some point, initially offering $3 million. However, Hughes was late in delivering the money, and Zeldin subsequently raised the price to $6 million. When Hughes was late again in delivering the money, Zeldin called off negotiations. The Carousel Motel became the Sand Dunes Motel in 1973, and was demolished in 1998. In 1990, the Imperial 400 became a Days Inn. In 1996, it became the Vagabond Inn. Before his death in June 1997, Zeldin finalized a $12.5 million deal to sell the Tam O'Shanter to Sheldon Adelson's Las Vegas Sands, which later opened the adjacent Venetian resort in 1999. Adelson was a friend of Zeldin. Venetian officials purchased of land, including the Tam O'Shanter, in October 1998. Bernie Zeldin's daughter, Leah Zeldin, operated the Tam O'Shanter until its closure. In December 2003, the Zeldin family was informed of the Venetian's plans to demolish the motel for a future resort. While there were no specific plans for the new resort's theme or construction date, company officials wanted the motel demolished so the land could be prepared for the future project, known as The Venetian Phase II, which would consist of a $1 billion resort with 3,000 rooms. Tam O'Shanter closed on January 12, 2004. An asbestos-removal project for the motel took 19 days to complete. Tam O'Shanter was subsequently demolished on February 6, 2004, to make room for The Palazzo. The Vagabond Inn, which contained asbestos as well, was also demolished in February 2004. The asbestos-removal project cost between $500,000 and $1 million. The land had also been occupied by the Las Vegas Kosher Deli, as well as several small stores that were owned by the Venetian and were expected to close to make room for The Palazzo. ===Construction=== The Palazzo during construction (March 2007) Foundation work on the $1.6 billion Palazzo began in September 2004, without a groundbreaking ceremony. As of February 27, 2006, the project had been under construction for over a year. Most of that time was spent digging the 4-story-deep hole to put in the underground parking structure. Then the building itself began to gradually rise upwards. The steel fabrication and erection was supplied by Schuff Steel Company. By November 2006, the hotel tower had reached the 35th floor. Construction of the ground floors, including the parking garage and shopping center, were well under way. As of March 2007, the hotel tower's elevator core was complete, and the rooms area was rising to the top. The façade and windows were being installed on the lower floors. As of August 2007, the lettering on the side of the tower was finished and topped out. ===Opening=== As of December 20, 2007, the Palazzo was scheduled to open at least 1,000 rooms by December 28 in preparation for the Las Vegas New Year's celebration, America's Party. The casino and other areas of the Palazzo opened at 7pm on Sunday, December 30, 2007, after a delay of several days due to the Clark County permitting process. Upon its completion, The Palazzo ‒ its total floor area covering ‒ displaced the Pentagon as the largest building in the United States in terms of floor space by a margin of about . The structural engineering was done by Walter P Moore Engineers and Consultants. Parts of the resort were opened to the general public on December 30, 2007. The official grand opening took place on January 17, 2008. in 2010, it was announced that it will be affiliated with InterContinental Hotels Group. ==St. Regis Residences at the Venetian Palazzo, Las Vegas== The St. Regis Residences at the Venetian Palazzo, Las Vegas is an unfinished condominium tower located at 3355 South Las Vegas Boulevard, between the Palazzo and the Venetian. In November 2006, Las Vegas Sands sought approval from the Clark County Commission to construct a 632-foot condominium tower on a portion of the Palazzo land. Construction of the $465 million tower began in early 2007, with pre-sales of the condominium units expected to begin by September. The tower was built atop a retail building that was part of the Palazzo project. The retail building and the condominium tower were constructed on less than an acre of land which had previously been occupied by the Rosewood Grille restaurant. In September 2008, Las Vegas Sands and Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide announced a partnership to open the tower as \\"The St. Regis Residences at the Venetian Palazzo, Las Vegas\\", named after Starwood's St. Regis brand. The tower would include 398 units, and was expected to cost $600 million at that time. Under the deal, Starwood would manage the tower upon its opening, which was scheduled for March 2010. St. Regis in 2020 In November 2008, Las Vegas Sands indefinitely suspended construction of the St. Regis because of the Great Recession. An additional 18 months of construction was needed to finish the project, which was to stand 50 stories high upon completion. In November 2009, Las Vegas Sands stated that work would remain suspended until the economy improved. In June 2011, Las Vegas Sands covered the unfinished building with a $1 million wrap made of giant cloth sheets that were printed to resemble a finished building. A company spokesman said that until a decision was made regarding the project, \\"We thought it was appropriate to improve it aesthetically in the meantime. We wanted it to look a little more like it belongs between a pair of five-diamond resorts like The Venetian and Palazzo.\\" Michael Leven, president of Las Vegas Sands, had a view of the unfinished tower from his third-floor office, and later stated: \\"I couldn't stand looking at that steel. One day I was out at the pool and I realized our guests were looking up and staring at the steel. We put the cover on it and it's held up well. You sometimes forget it is there if you walk by.\\" In April 2014, Leven said that money was no longer an issue in completing the project, stating, \\"It's not a financial decision anymore, but we want to do the right thing,\\" referring to the ultimate use of the building. Because of the uncertainty in the high-end, high-rise residential market, Leven stated that it was unlikely the tower would be completed as condominiums. Up to that time, Las Vegas Sands had considered finishing and opening the tower as timeshares, but Leven stated that \\"the numbers didn't work out.\\" Leven further stated that finishing the tower as a third hotel- casino with its own entrance was unlikely. Also considered was finishing the tower as a hotel expansion for the Palazzo and Venetian. ==Design== Hanging lanterns in the Palazzo Atrium in the Palazzo The $1.8 billion resort features a lobby where guests from the street arrive beneath a glass dome with a two- story fountain. Those approaching from The Venetian make the transition through a towering octagonal structure and garden, itself topped by a glass- and-iron dome. Visitors to The Palazzo using the underground parking structure can take elevators or escalators from the underground garage and arrive in the center of the property's casino. The Palazzo Casino, like some other casinos on the Strip, operates under the license of a related casino—in this case The Venetian's license. The resort's high hotel tower features 3,068 all-suite rooms and 375 concierge-level suites. The Palazzo is LEED Silver Certified—the largest LEED certified building in the nation. The Palazzo is reported to be the eleventh largest building in the world in terms of available floor space and is also currently the second-largest building in the Western Hemisphere. ==Attractions== ===Dal Toro Las Vegas=== The Las Vegas Car Museum is inside the multi-story Dal Toro restaurant, and features displays of automobiles from automakers including Bugatti, Spyker, Saleen, and Koenigsegg. The showroom is decorated with marble and tile flooring, leather wall coverings, and artwork. The space was originally a Lamborghini Las Vegas dealership. The restaurant stopped using the automaker's trademark after a lawsuit was filed. ===Grand Canal Shoppes at The Venetian and The Palazzo=== Features boutique stores from the likes of Ralph Lauren, Jimmy Choo, Fendi, Cole Haan, Piaget, Diane von Furstenberg, Chloè, Bottega Veneta, Bulgari, Michael Kors, Burberry, Christian Louboutin, Catherine Malandrino, Anya Hindmarch, Charriol, and others.

He came to agree with Albert Goldman and Felix Morrows' criticism of the SWP and Fourth International management. With Goldman, he ended his participation with the group in 1946 to join the Workers' Party. Within the Workers' Party, Goldman and Farrell worked closely. In 1948, they developed criticisms of its policies, claiming that the party should endorse the Marshall Plan and also Norman Thomas' presidential candidacy. Having come to believe that only capitalism could defeat Stalinism, they left to join the Socialist Party of America. During the late 1960s, disenchanted with the political \\"center\\", while impressed with the SWP's involvement in the Civil Rights and US anti- Vietnam War movements, he reestablished communication with his former comrades of two decades earlier. Farrell attended one or more SWP-sponsored Militant Forum events (probably in NYC), but never rejoined the Trotskyist movement. ==Marriages== Farrell was married three times, to two women.

It is a Flash animation featuring the music of Lebanese musician Azar Habib; the name of the song playing is \\"Miin Ma Kenti\\". The animation prominently features a hat, Swedish text, and an assortment of bizarre imagery. ==Origin== In 1981, Habib recorded \\"Miin Ma Kenti\\" (Whoever you are), also known as \\"Habbaytek\\"/\\"Habbeetik\\" (I Loved You, or I Fell In Love With You) in Arabic for his Ya Malaki album; the tape eventually made its way to Sweden. Nineteen years later, Swedes Patrik Nyberg, Johan Gröndahl and Pet Bagge noticed that the lyrics sounded like Swedish. With this in mind, they published an mp3 file and a text file with the \\"misheard\\" lyrics on their website. Shortly after this, another Swede, Martin Holmström, decided to make a flash video of the song, which he published on his site. It has been seen by millions of people around the world. ==Details== The Swedish \\"subtitles\\" are not a translation of the Arabic, but rather a homophonic translation of the lyrics into Swedish, resulting in outlandish non sequiturs such as Limma skinkbit, cooligt (glue piece of ham, cool-ish) and Man kan knarka och hamna i TV (You can do drugs and end up on TV). From the contents of these lyrics the deadpan site presented a Swedish drinking game involving the passing around of hats, which was sometimes taken at face value by viewers. The accompanying images of the animation are ostensibly Middle Eastern men in hats; one of those hats floating among a party of people, who appear to be dressed in traditional Turkish or Middle Eastern clothing; and visualizations of the Swedish lyrics such as \\"cool guy with soda in hand\\" and \\"borrow the LP 'Hatten är din' \\". ==Reception== The song became famous in Scandinavia and, according to Nyberg, was often played at drinking parties. Copies were made and sold without the creators' permission. (in Swedish) The Metro newspaper of Stockholm even sent a journalist to get an interview with Azar Habib. Habib was apparently surprised by this mutilation of his song and the craze that followed, but liked the idea.

The city was originally settled by Azorean descendants and later received a contingent of German and Italian immigrants. Gramado is one of the cities along the scenic route known as Rota Romântica (Romantic Route). ==History== National Archives of Brazil. Gramado was originally settled in 1875 by Portuguese immigrants. Five years later, the first German immigrants arrived and these were followed shortly after by Italian immigrants from the Italian settlements in Caxias do Sul. In 1913, the city seat was moved to Linha Nova, the location of the present-day city center. At this time, Gramado was an unincorporated city within the city of Taquara. A railway, brought by Gramado's founder and first administrator, José Nicoletti Filho, arrived in the city in 1921, boosting the local economy. Gramado officially became a city in 1937, when Gramado was already known as a summer holiday resort. Gramado became a city on December 15, 1954 by force of State Act 2,522.\\"Lei Nº 2.522, de 15 de Dezembro de 1954.\\" Estado do Rio Grande do Sul - Assembleia Legislativa. 1 May 2009 . ==Politics and Government== Gramado Government is in a strong mayor-council government model, as set forth by the Brazilian Constitution of 1988.

John Haugeland proposes an analogy with simulated diamonds and synthetic diamonds—only the synthetic diamond is truly a diamond. Synthetic means that which is produced by synthesis; combining parts to form a whole, colloquially, a man-made version of that which has arisen naturally. As defined, a \\"synthetic intelligence\\" would therefore be man-made, but not a simulation. ==Definition== The term was used by Haugeland in 1986 to describe artificial intelligence research up to that point, which he called \\"good old fashioned artificial intelligence\\" or \\"GOFAI\\". AI's first generation of researchers firmly believed their techniques would lead to real, human-like intelligence in machines. After the AI winter, many AI researchers chose to focus on finding solutions for specific individual problems, such as machine learning, rather than artificial general intelligence. This approach to AI is referred to by some popular sources as \\"weak AI\\" or \\"applied AI\\". The term \\"synthetic AI\\" is now sometimes used by researchers in the field to separate their work using subsymbolism, emergence, Psi-Theory, or other relatively new methods to define and create \\"true\\" intelligence from previous attempts, particularly those of GOFAI or weak AI.Imagination Engines, Inc., Home of the Creativity MachinePrinciples of Synthetic Intelligence: PSI : an Architecture of Motivated ... - Joscha Bach - Google Books Sources disagree about exactly what constitutes \\"real\\" intelligence as opposed to \\"simulated\\" intelligence and therefore whether there is a meaningful distinction between artificial intelligence and synthetic intelligence. Russell and Norvig present this example: # \\"Can machines fly?\\" The answer is yes, because airplanes fly. # \\"Can machines swim?\\" The answer is no, because submarines don't swim. # \\"Can machines think?\\" Is this question like the first, or like the second? Drew McDermott firmly believes that \\"thinking\\" should be construed like \\"flying\\". While discussing the electronic chess champion Deep Blue, he argues \\"Saying Deep Blue doesn't really think about chess is like saying an airplane doesn't really fly because it doesn't flap its wings.\\" Edsger Dijkstra agrees that some find \\"the question whether machines can think as relevant as the question whether submarines can swim.\\" John Searle, on the other hand, suggests that a thinking machine is, at best, a simulation, and writes \\"No one supposes that computer simulations of a five-alarm fire will burn the neighborhood down or that a computer simulation of a rainstorm will leave us all drenched.\\" The essential difference between a simulated mind and a real mind is one of the key points of his Chinese room argument. Daniel Dennett believes that this is basically a disagreement about semantics and that it is peripheral to the central questions of the philosophy of artificial intelligence. He notes that even a chemically perfect imitation of a Chateau Latour is still a fake, but that any Vodka is real, no matter who made it. Similarly, a perfect, molecule- by-molecule recreation of an original Picasso would be considered a \\"forgery\\", but any image of the Coca-Cola logo is completely real and subject to trademark laws. Russell and Norvig comment \\"we can conclude that in some cases, the behavior of an artifact is important, while in others it is the artifact's pedigree that matters. Which one is important in which case seems to be a matter of convention. But for artificial minds, there is no convention.\\" ==See also== * SI-complete * Simulated reality * Synthetic biology == Notes == == References == * . * * . * . * . * . * . * . == External links == * What Is AI? – An introduction to artificial intelligence by John McCarthy—a co-founder of the field, and the person who coined the term. * The Handbook of Artificial Intelligence Volume Ⅰ by Avron Barr and Edward A.

Unlike thrill rides, funhouses are participatory attractions, where visitors enter and move around under their own power. Incorporating aspects of a playful obstacle course, funhouses seek to distort conventional perceptions and startle people with unstable and unpredictable physical circumstances within an atmosphere of wacky whimsicality. ==Common features== The funhouse at Malton fair. The entire building folds onto one trailer for hauling. Appearing originally in the early 1900s at Coney Island, the funhouse is so called because in its initial form it was just that: a house or larger building containing a number of amusement devices. At first these were mainly mechanical devices. Some could be described as enlarged, motorized versions of what might be found on a children's playground. The most common were: *A slide, usually much taller and steeper than one would find on a playground. Some were as much as two stories high. Slides of comparable size can be seen today on carnival midways as separate attractions. Most were made of polished hardwood, and riders would sit on burlap mats to protect themselves from friction burns and to ensure that rubber-soled shoes didn't slow the slider down. *A large spinning disk. While the disk was stationary patrons would get on and sit in the center, then the operator would start the disk spinning, and people would be thrown off by centrifugal force, ending up against a padded wall. A variation was a disk with a raised center, shaped much like a Bundt cake mold; as the device sped up, people would slide downhill as well as outward. *A horizontal revolving cylinder or \\"barrel\\" called \\"barrel of love\\" or \\"barrel of fun\\" to try to walk through without falling down. *Sections of floor that undulated up and down, tipped from side to side or moved forward and back, either motorized or activated by the person's weight. Stairs that moved up and down, tipped from side to side, or slid side-to-side alternating directions between steps. The industry refers to these and similar devices as floor tricks. *Compressed air jets shooting air up from the floor, originally designed to blow up women's skirts, but effective at startling almost anyone and making them jump and scream. *An array of distorting mirrors. *A very large ball pit Notwithstanding the images in movies and comic books, fun houses did not drop patrons through trapdoors, which would be far too dangerous. One type of floor trick plays on this image: it consists of a section of floor that suddenly drops just a few inches, making victims think they are falling into a trapdoor. Some fun houses would bring new arrivals through a short series of dark corridors or a mirror maze or a door maze (many identical doors forming squares, only one of which would open outward in each square), often leading onto a small stage where they had to negotiate a series of rocking floors, airjets and other obstacles while people already inside the funhouse could watch and laugh at them. A few places even provided bench seats for the watchers. Once patrons were inside they could stay as long as they wanted, moving from one attraction to another, repeating each one as many times as they chose. This type of fun house resembled a miniature version of Steeplechase Park at Coney Island, whose 'Pavilion of Fun' — a building resembling a huge airplane hangar — included, in addition to rides, a gigantic slide, a spinning disk probably across, and a lighted stage called the \\"Insanitarium\\" where patrons emerging from the Steeplechase ride were harassed by a clown carrying an electric wand, while women in skirts were at the mercy of air-jet bursts.Kyriazi, G.: The Great American Amusement Parks, page 89. Castle Books, 1978 Through the first half of the 20th century most amusement parks had this type of fun house, but its free-form design was its undoing. It was labor-intensive, needing an attendant at almost every device, and when people spent two hours in the fun house they weren’t out on the midway buying tickets to other rides and attractions. Traditional fun houses gave way to walk-throughs, where patrons followed a set path all the way through and emerged back on the midway a few minutes later. These preserved some of the traditional fun house features, including various kinds of moving floors, sometimes a revolving barrel and a small slide. They added such things as crooked rooms, where a combination of tilt and optical illusion made it hard to know which way was up, and dark corridors with various popup and jumpout surprises, optical illusions and sound effects. Although some walkthroughs were given unique names, like Aladdin’s Castle (Riverview Park in Chicago), Magic Carpet (Crystal Beach, Ontario) or Riverboat (Palisades Park, New Jersey), many were still labelled Fun House, and regardless of the official name the public generally referred to them that way. Many traditional fun houses were removed after parks created walk-throughs. Some became dilapidated and were torn down. A few burned down; they were nearly all wood-frame buildings with extensive electrical wiring. Those that remained were all at traditional local amusement parks and died when those parks closed due to competition from new theme parks. No theme park ever created a traditional free-form stay-all-day fun house, but theme parks sometimes developed the walk-through attraction to new, high-tech heights. A few traditional fun houses are still operating in Europe and Australia. Related, but with somewhat different history, are walk-through haunted houses and mirror mazes, although the latter are sometimes labelled fun houses. ==In popular culture== ===Books=== John Barth's experimental short story collection Lost in the Funhouse, and the short story of same title. Robert Heinlein has Lazarus Long and his mother Maureen Long visit a funhouse with his younger self in the novel Time Enough for Love. '' ===Movies=== Hollywood sometimes built elaborate funhouse sets with devices never seen in a real funhouse, as in the 1937 Fred Astaire musical, A Damsel in Distress, and the 1939 Joe E. Brown film, Beware Spooks!. Other funhouses depicted onscreen include: * The silent films It (1927), The Crowd (1928), and Speedy (1928), in which scenes in traditional fun houses can be seen. * In the film Pinocchio (1940), Pinocchio and Lampwick visit a funhouse in Pleasure Island. * I Love a Soldier (1944), has a brief scene shot in the funhouse at Playland-at-the-Beach in San Francisco. * In the film noir classic Lady from Shanghai (1947), Orson Welles' famous final shootout takes place in a funhouse hall of mirrors, as O'Hara learns the truth in a place that trades on deception. * The Judy Canova film Carolina Cannonball (1955), concludes with an elaborate chase scene filmed at a large funhouse in Venice, California. * A funhouse is used by the villain Francisco Scaramanga in the James Bond film The Man with the Golden Gun (1974), wherein a series of animatronics, obstacles and illuminated mannequins are used to distract and frighten the victim before the victim is shot by Scaramanga. * In Grease (1978), the end number, \\"You're the One That I Want\\", takes place in a real carnival funhouse built by the Hollingsworth company of Florida. The performers actually move through the funhouse backwards, entering at what should be the exit and emerging at the entrance. *The 1981 horror film The Funhouse is about four teenagers who encounter a serial killer while spending the night in a traveling carnival's \\"funhouse.\\" The attraction shown in the movie is actually a dark ride. *The horror film 'Us (2019 film), directed by Jordan Peele, has a funhouse at a carnival in Santa Cruz, where a young Adelaide runs into her tethered counterpart, Red. ===Music=== *Funhouse is a 2008 album and song by American singer P!nk. *Fun House is the second studio album by American rock band The Stooges. *Funhouse is an alternative rock band from Parkersburg, West Virginia. ===Television=== * HBO's hit cable TV series The Sopranos, made numerous references to funhouses and funhouse rides. For example, the episode, \\"Funhouse\\", prominently features Palace Amusements' now-empty indoor arcade, wide-eyed clown mural called \\"Tillie\\", boardwalk, tower viewer, and Atlantic Ocean view in Tony Soprano's fever- induced dream. Moreover, in another scene in that episode, Tony's mother calls his home for help about stolen airline tickets. Carmela Soprano answers the telephone and remarks as she hands it to Tony: \\"Here, the fun never stops\\". * The children's game show Fun House used a carnival funhouse filled with strange obstacles in its grand prize round. The two members on each day's winning team took turns running through the house to collect tags representing cash and prizes. * In Phineas and Ferb, in the episode \\"Misperceived Monotreme\\", Phineas and Ferb redesigned the interior of their house and turned it into a funhouse. In this episode, there is also a song titled \\"Livin' in a Funhouse\\". * In MacGyver, in the episode \\"Brainwashed\\" (S4E16), Jack Dalton is mentally reprogrammed in a defunct funhouse to be used as a device for assassination. * In Scream, in the episode, \\"Village of the Damned\\", the killer uses the location of the Lakewood Carnival to lure a group of students in an attempt to kill them. ===Video games=== * A funhouse based on the fictional television series Address Unknown which imitates a mental institute is prominently featured in the noir thriller Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne. * In the game Bully, a funhouse features in the mission Funhouse Fun, where Jimmy Hopkins has to rescue the nerds from the jocks inside. * Pac-Man World contains four funhouse/carnival-themed levels named Clowning Around, Barrel Blast, Spin Dizzy, and Clown Prix. ** Pac-Man World Rally features Funhouse of Terror including its dark clown theme, split pathways, and a road reminiscent of Rainbow Road from the Mario Kart series. It is the third track in the Watermelon Cup and the eleventh track overall in the game. * Weekend Warrior from Pangea Software includes a funhouse-themed arena, in which the player has eight minutes to reach the exit. Some doors require a respective key to pass. * The second arena in the vehicular combat game Twisted Metal: Small Brawl is a funhouse named Carn-O-Maul, which imitates a horror/slasher theme and includes a spinning barrel, a secret mirror door, and a rotating disc, the latter of which increases its speed if stood on too long. * The second level of the 2005 Spy vs. Spy game, Kooky Carnival, features a funhouse with rotating walls, tunnels, and clowns. ==Carnival fun houses== Traveling carnivals have long included small walk-through fun houses in addition to their thrill rides. The typical carnival fun house is built entirely in a semi-trailer, usually about long by wide, allowing limited space for elaborate scenes or effects. Common features are dark corridors, light-up skulls, gravity-powered tipping floors, and airjets at the exit. A few include motorized devices like moving floors and stairways or downscaled revolving barrels. A few attractions traveling on two or more trailers are more elaborate. Beginning in the late 1980s a few American operators acquired European-built attractions that unfold into multi-storied walkthroughs with dozens of tricks. Such funhouses are ubiquitous in Europe, but the falling value of the U.S. dollar and the high cost of fuel to transport multiple trailers over the long distances carnivals travel in the United States has made them expensive to buy and operate, so they are seen only at the largest American fairs. ==See also== *Mystery Fun House *Obstacle course ==References== ==External links== * Laff In The Dark Information and history of the dark ride and funhouse amusement industry * The Darkride and Funhouse Enthusiasts (DAFE) Category:Amusement park attractions ","title":"Funhouse"},{"id":"2548088","text":"Markus Pröll (born 28 August 1979) is a German former professional football goalkeeper.

It focuses on music from the 1970s, being the third decade- oriented channel in the Now portfolio, along with Now 80s and Now 90s. ==History== ===As Channel U=== Channel U: 3 March 2003 - 16 March 2009 Channel U was a significant outlet not only for established artists, but also for those who are just starting out, helping the breakthrough for acts such as Tinchy Stryder, Tinie Tempah, Dizzee Rascal, Chip, Wretch 32, Devlin, Giggs, Skepta and N-Dubz. Its material \\"includes crude productions shot with handheld digital video cameras,\\" and helps new musicians attract attention and build a fan base. According to its website, \\"the aim of the channel was to highlight to the public, the raw and unsigned talent we have in the UK, and give them a platform from which they could perform,\\" and it has been successful in this mission, as suggested by the production and popularity of such compilation CDs as Channel U: The Album. Many artists have expressed their loyalty to the channel in their lyrics; for example, in Lady Sovereign's \\"9 to 5\\", \\"Channel who? Oh Channel U, the ones who made me huge, like Katie Price's boobs!\\". Other artists to comment on Channel U include Kano, Ironik, Lethal Bizzle, Sway, Remi Nicole, Mr Wong, and Dizzee Rascal. Dan le sac vs Scroobius Pip criticised Channel U in their song \\"Fixed\\", as did Lowkey, who cited the absence of any innovation and the channel's lack of desire to take risks. Channel U commissioned the first 'grime comedy', an animated adult sitcom named The Booo Krooo. The TV series ran for six episodes and focused on the misadventures of three young MCs trying to break into the music game, but often ending up worse off than when they started. The Booo Krooo was originally a cult classic to readers of RWD Magazine and came got the attention of the Channel U after being co-signed by Missy Elliott. The animation series was developed by Matt Mason and Alex Donne Johnson with illustrations by Julian Johnson, aka Art Jaz. Music publication Ransom Note said: > \\"Boo Kroo were essentially a proto version of People Just Do Nothing. After > proving a popular feature in the magazine, Boo Kroo were given their own > show on Channel U – which is how this video for the track (by a peak form > Sticky) came about.\\" In October 2005, the first annual Channel U Awards were held in London with live performances from its underground playlist. Before he joined MTV to host the British version of Pimp My Ride, Tim Westwood had a show on Channel AKA, along with his other media activity. Following the success of the Westwood show the channel further developed its programming by licensing a lifestyle TV series, The Ballers Show, in 2006. The 30-minute show gave its audience the unique opportunity to see the real lives of footballers off the pitch and featured Premier League football stars including Jermain Defoe and Jermaine Pennant. On 14 July 2016, the channel's founder, Darren Platt, died. In his obituary in The Guardian the newspaper stated that Channel U \\"forged a place for a genre that began its life ignored by the mainstream\\". On 25 September 2020, it was confirmed that Channel U would be returning to TV on 13 November 2020 to promote the film Against All Odds. ===As Channel AKA=== Channel AKA: 16 March 2009 - 11 April 2014 Channel AKA: 11 April 2014 - 1 June 2018 The parent company of Fizz TV and Channel U went into voluntary liquidation at the beginning of February, 2009, before being purchased by Mushroom TV. When purchasing the two channels, Mushroom TV agreed that Channel U and Fizz TV should be rebranded. The two channels were rebranded as Channel AKA and Starz TV on 16 March 2009. On 22 June 2012, Mushroom TV entered liquidation.

While in Bombay, he was restricted from all military areas (cantonments) and was forbidden to preach to military personnel. In April 1852, he moved on to Poona (now Pune), 90 miles distant, where he was eventually granted permission to proselyte. The local cantonment commander reasoned that \\"the less these people are opposed the less harm they would do.\\" Findlay was eventually able to organize a branch of twelve members in Poona by mid-September 1852, a mixture of \\"European, Eurasian, and native.\\"Millennial Star (London, England), Vol. XIV, pp. 635-36.

One of the first aircraft designed for aerial topdressing, the Fletcher has also been used for other aerial applications as a utility aircraft, and for sky diving. ==Design and development== The FU-24 was loosely based on the Fletcher FD-25 Defender, designed by US aeronautical engineer and light aircraft enthusiast John W. Thorp, and originally conceived in 1951 as an STOL light attack aircraft. The prototype Defender was built by Fletcher Aviation in California and first flew in 1953. A few Defenders were later built in Japan. At the time New Zealand top dressing operators were in the U.S. seeking a replacement for war surplus De Havilland Tiger Moths which formed the backbone of the industry. Thorp and Wendell Fletcher incorporated many elements of the Defender into a new design, the FU-24. A group of New Zealand top dressing operators gathered a hundred options for the design off the drawing board, and founded a company, Air Parts, to assemble the type in New Zealand, while a New Zealand farming company, Cable Price Corporation, funded the construction of two prototypes in the U.S. with the New Zealand Meat Producers Board acting as financial guarantor. The first prototype FU-24 flew on 14 June 1954 in the United States, then was disassembled for shipment to New Zealand, together with the (unflown) second prototype. The original prototype had a engine and open cockpit. Prior to production commencing, this design was altered to add an enclosed cockpit and more powerful 260 to Continental engines. The next 70 aircraft were delivered to New Zealand in kit form and assembled at Hamilton airport. From 1961 full production was undertaken locally, by Air Parts, which later became part of AESL and detail improvements and the option of dual controls were added, becoming the Mark II. The Fletcher is a conventional low- wing monoplane with tricycle undercarriage, side-by-side seating in front of the wing and hopper and pronounced dihedral on the outer wing panels. A door aft of the wing's trailing edge on the port side allows access to a cargo compartment. The Fletcher's airframe is constructed entirely of aluminium, heavily treated to prevent corrosion. Fletcher FU-24-950M of Fieldair at Thames airfield New Zealand in 1992 After the 257th aircraft the engine was changed to a Lycoming IO-720 horizontally-opposed eight-cylinder engine (over a hundred earlier aircraft were re-built and re-engined by the factory). Some Fletchers have also flown with V-8 truck engines. In 1967 a PT6 turboprop version was built by James Aviation as ZK-CTZ, a Garrett TPE 331-powered version followed in 1968 and a Garrett-powered version in 1971, both for Robertson Air Service. Several others were converted aftermarket with these or Walter turbines, (including the first prototype, which flew until recently with a Walter). Two aircraft were also converted to Garrett TPE 331-10 engines by the Scone (NSW Australia) operator Airpasture. These aircraft have since flown many thousands of hours without incident. In the mid 1970s, Pacific Aerospace decided the Fletcher design was reaching the limits of redevelopment and introduced the larger and stronger PAC Cresco. Despite the similar appearance this is a new aircraft, though sharing a few components. For several years production of the two continued side by side, but the type is now effectively out of production, (new Fletchers remain nominally available from the manufacturer, but no new aircraft have been built since a batch of five for Syria was completed in 1992). Although Fletcher was the name of the manufacturer in the U.S. and the aircraft was called the FU-24, over time the type has become colloquially known as the Fletcher. Fletchers have been sold to most parts of the world, although they are rare in Europe and the US. Government orders came from many developing countries including Thailand, Syria, Iraq and Sudan. ==Variants== * FU-24 : Single-seat agricultural top dressing aircraft. * FU-24A Utility : Six-seat utility transport aircraft.

He is best known as the former lead guitarist of Megadeth and King Diamond, along with his brother Shawn Drover who also performed with Megadeth. ==History== Glen Drover began playing guitar as a child, and was joined at age 10 by his brother Shawn on drums. The Drover brothers formed the band Eidolon in 1994, releasing seven albums to date. ===King Diamond (1998–2001)=== In 1998, Drover joined King Diamond, completed two North American tours, and appeared on the House of God album. ===Megadeth (2004–2008)=== In October 2004, Drover joined the heavy metal band Megadeth, bringing along his brother Shawn. Following an extensive world tour, Drover contributed to Megadeth's 2007 release, United Abominations as the lead guitarist and with co-writing credits for one song. In January 2008 Drover left Megadeth to focus on family life; the constant touring was starting to have a negative effect on him. His last show with Megadeth was on November 18, 2007 in Brisbane, Australia. Commenting on leaving the band, Drover said \\"I am aware of the rumors that I left Megadeth to focus on family life and my family life has always been my priority. In the end, I was unhappy with the situation, which magnified me wanting to spend more time with my family and realizing that it's time for me to move on to the next chapter in my musical career, I have a lot of great memories and met a ton of great people along the way, both fans and people in the industry.\\" ===Metalusion (2008-2011)=== Drover recorded a ten-track instrumental CD. The album, titled Metalusion, was recorded sporadically over a 2-plus-year period. It was released on April 5, 2011. The album contained cover versions of songs from Al Dimeola, Jean Luc Ponty, Frank Zappa, as well as original material written by members Jim Gilmour and Paul Yee. ===Testament (2008, 2010)=== On October 22, 2008, Testament announced that they had recruited guitarist Glen Drover to fill in on their upcoming Mexican tour dates with Judas Priest, due to Alex Skolnick's prior commitment to the Trans-Siberian Orchestra.

The B21 and all derived engines are often referred to as red block engines for the red paint applied to the block. The primary differences when compared to the B20 was the switch to a SOHC in place of the older pushrod configuration, and an aluminum crossflow cylinder head versus the iron head of the B20. ==History== Initially the overhead camshaft versions were offered as optional equipment on the 240, becoming standard in all markets by the 1976 model year. The overhead camshaft motors were available in displacements of 2.0 (B19 and B200), 2.1 (B21), and eventually 2.3 (B23 and B230) litres. The B21 featured an stroke, and bore. In the US, the B21's power output ranged anywhere between and , based on variations in the compression ratio and was typically supplied with a B or M camshaft. The engines are tilted approx 15 degrees to left (exhaust side) to make room for the more complicated injection systems. B19 and B21 blocks can be identified by water plugs on one side of the block. The B23 blocks have them on both sides. The camshaft is driven by a toothed belt that is driven off the front of the crankshaft. The belt turns the intermediate shaft as well, which in turn drives the oil pump, distributor (on 240 engines and BXX 700/900 series engines) and the fuel pump of carburetor models. All single camshaft versions of the engine with the exception of the K series (B200K, B230K) are of 'non-interference' design, meaning that failure of the toothed belt will not result in engine damage. In 1981 the B21FT (a B21F with a turbo) was introduced with a compression ratio of 7.5:1 mated with a Garrett T3 turbocharger and a T camshaft. Additional turbo variants, not offered in the US market, were the B19ET and the B21ET, based on the B19E and B21E respectively. The turbocharger increased power output to for the B21FT, and for the B21ET. boost on the B21FT and boost on the B21ET. Also new for the 1981 model year in Canada (previously introduced in 1979 outside of North America) was the B23, with a displacement of 2.3 litres ( stroke and bore). Aside from the increased bore size, the engine is identical to the B21. Volvo used a slightly different mold for the turbo engines to cast a boss for the turbo oil return line. Because a turbocharged engine has a higher operating temperature they used sodium filled exhaust valves and a thermostat controlled oil cooler (air/oil model). In 1983 the B23 was introduced to the United States market as a B23F engine. Also introduced in 1983, the \\"intercooler boost system\\" (IBS) was introduced for the B21FT motors. The IBS kit consisted of an intercooler, appropriate ducting, a new fan shroud, new oil cooler lines and mounting brackets, and optionally an automatic transmission kit. IBS raised the output of the B21FT to , slightly more than the non intercooled European market B21ET's . Canada also received the B21FT, along with a detuned B23E in 1983. Midway through the 1984 model year, the \\"intercooler boost system\\" became standard on North American 240 Turbos. Additionally a bigger clutch and a stepped flywheel were included. Combined with changes to the fuel system in 1984 that boosted the B21FT's non-intercooled horsepower to , the factory intercooled 1984.5 model horsepower rating increased to . Volvo 360. In 1985 a revised, \\"low friction\\" design was introduced, dubbed the B200 and B230 (depending on displacement). Several components had design changes, longer rods ( c-c, longer), pistons with a lower compression height, lower friction bearings (smaller in size), a crankshaft with 8 counterweights (instead of 4 on the older Bxx engines) and a heavy harmonic balancer (aka damper) in the crank pulley. 1989 saw an upgrade to the crankshaft, with a relocated axial thrust bearing back to the number 5 journal, bigger main bearings, rods were enlarged to from in 1990. Also introduced in 1989 were 16 valve, twin-cam variants of the B200 and B230, dubbed the B204 and B234 respectively. The B204 was also available in turbo form in some markets (such as Italy) where large displacement motors were taxed heavily. It came in two versions: The B204GT turbo motor operates with a lead resistant lambda probe and generates approximately . The B204FT has a catalytic converter and generates . Both were the first redblocks standard equipped with oil squirters for piston cooling. Crankshaft, connecting rods and pistons were all forged. Exhaust valves were sodium filled for cooler operation. It has smaller valves and stiffer valve springs than n/a 16V. Crank torque is at 2950 rpm for the GT, and for the FT. Other differences from the normal 16V redblock engine are that it uses a remote mounted oil filter (Away from block on exhaust side engine mount) and a windage tray. For the B230 engines 1993, piston cooling, oil squirting jets were added to help alleviate piston slap problems on the turbo motors. Another modification was to go from a square toothed timing belt set up to a round toothed timing belt setup which made for quieter belt running. Although availability of the redblock was phased out in 1995 in North America, production continued in Europe until 1998 when the 940 model was discontinued. ==Nomenclature== The B21, and related red block motors, were named using the following convention: B##X or B##VX. Where B stands for \\"bensin\\" (gasoline), ## stands for the displacement in decilitres, and X is an appropriate suffix. On the later low-friction motors, V denotes SOHC configuration (0) or DOHC configuration (4, for 4 valves per cylinder). i.e. B230 (SOHC, 2.3 litres), B234 (2.3 litres, DOHC * 4 valves per cylinder * 4 cylinders = 16 valves) The following suffixes were commonly used by Volvo: * A - single constant-pressure type carburetor (such as the Pierburg 175 CDUS), typically with manual choke * B - high compression, with twin carburetor's, either twin Zenith-Stromberg carburettors or twin SU's. * E - high compression, no catalyst, mechanical fuel injection K-Jetronic * BxxET - K-Jetronic turbo * B2xxET - Motronic controlled electronic fuel injection, turbo. * F - low compression (9.8:1 on B230F, 9.5:1 on B280F, 10.0:1 on B234F and 10.7:1 on B2304F), US/Europe version (F for Federal) with catalytic converter. Europe/APAC version, fuel injected (usually LH Jetronic or Bendix Regina) * K - single jet type carburetor (such as the Solex-Cisac carbs), typically with automatic choke * G - LH2.4 Jetronic but without cat. converter, CO adjustment on the AMM (similar to LH2.2 Jetronic). Some models without O2 sensor, others with O2 sensor which requires regular replacement at intervals due to lead fouling. For markets which unleaded fuel was rare in the early 1990s, e.g. Eastern Europe * FB - low compression version of B230F (9.3:1) with the \\"531\\" cylinder head and VX3 camshaft, power output and more than B230F. LH2.4 Jetronic fuel injection, for the European and Australian markets. * FX - same as the FB but with the distributor mounted on the block (instead of the head) for use in the 240. * FD - essentially a B230F fitted with exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) and Pulse air system for cleaner emissions * T - turbocharged, after E or F suffix (example: B21ET, B230FT) * FK - low pressure turbo, 1995 onward, not supplied in North America. Identical to the B230FT engine of that time but lowered boost level at * FT - LH- jetronic 2.2/2.4 Turbo, 8.7:1 Static CR achieved by dished pistons. * FTX - Higher power output B230FT (approx. ) ==Special versions== ===B17=== Special version for certain European export markets (e.g. Greece, Israel) with shorter stroke than the B19, bore and stroke for displacement. ===B19 Turbo=== The B19ET was sold in certain markets where engines of over 2-litre displacement were heavily taxed, such as Italy. The engine has the same stroke as all other redblocks, the smaller displacement is the result of a smaller bore at . It is a very robust engine with forged pistons (made by Kolbenschmidt). The B19 later turned into the B200 low friction engine. ===B23 Turbo=== The B23ET and B23FT motors were offered for two years only in the 1983 and 1984 Volvo 700 series. Both the B23ET and B23FT are somewhat unusual in the 700 series, as they were the only turbo motors offered in the 700 series with a block mounted distributor, forged pistons and a forged crankshaft. The B23ET was the only redblock known to be equipped with a small coolant passage version of the higher flowing 405 cylinder head, the FT had to make do with normal 398 head. As these motors predate the low-friction B200 and B230 turbos and are equipped with forged pistons and crank, they are often considered one of the most robust Volvo turbo motors. === 16 Valve Variants=== B204GT in a Volvo 960 Introduced in 1989 for the 740 GLE (and later used in the 940/960), The 16-Valve Redblock motors were offered in both a 2.0-litre Turbo (B204FT/GT) and a 2.3-litre Naturally aspirated version (B234F). The head was designed for Volvo by either Cosworth or Porsche. In addition to the 16 Valve head, these motors were equipped with twin counter rotating external balance shafts and the engine block itself differs from the 8V redblock. The block differed from the standard B230 in that the auxiliary shaft (used to drive the oil pump and distributor on models that had block mounted distributors) was replaced with an external oil pump. The 16-Valve head was itself a completely new design for Volvo: The head was of a multi-piece design featuring a separate cam carrier and lower section. The later \\"white block\\" motors can trace their head design back to the two-piece setup found in the B204 and B234. The 2.0 litre turbo variant was introduced for European markets with tax structures tied to engine displacement such as Italy. Unique to the B204 turbo was an exhaust gas pyrometer which was used to detect excessively high exhaust temperatures. When excessively high exhaust temperatures were detected, the fuel injection computer would richen the mixture. It has a forged crankshaft, cast pistons, and connecting rods. Although a powerful engine for its time, the 16 Valve engine can experience some problems that can be solved easily. One of the few problems is oil pump gear problems leading to broken timing belts. The oil pump gear itself can fail around the mounting flange, or, more often, the weak 8.8 (grade 5) grade bolt holding the gear can break. It is strongly recommended to use a 10.9 (grade 8) grade bolt when replacing the oil pump gear. Another cause for timing belt failure is improperly adjusting the timing belt on engines with a manual tensioner (1989 to very early 1990 models only) or improperly adjusting the balance shaft belt. Because this is an interference engine, damage will occur if the timing belt fails. Another common occurrence is that the balance shaft's oil seals are prone to leak on older engines. New replacement sealings tend to start leaking again due to 'worn in irregularities' on the shaft itself. Many people have removed the balance shaft belt or the balance shaft assemblies altogether to prevent belt failure and/or leakage. The balance shafts are only there to lessen high rpm second order vibrations, and removing them will only affect high rpm vibrations. Once all the common problems are solved, the 16 Valve engines are just as reliable as their SOHC counterparts. The recommended timing belt interval for these engines is every , or earlier if the engine is modified. It is also recommended to replace the crank and camshaft seals at every interval and to thoroughly inspect the tensioner and idler pulleys for wear. ===Volvo Penta=== Volvo Penta sold the OHC redblocks as marine engines as well, just like the older OHV engines. Depending on the model the displacement was (as B21), (same as B23/B230 automotive) or . The engines with displacement, identified as the Volvo Penta AQ151 (8 valve) and AQ171 (dohc 16 valve) models, got a forged crankshaft with a longer stroke of together with pistons with a lower compression height. The blocks still had B230 cast in the block. Penta used both the 8 valve and 16 valve cylinder heads. Both the 8V and 16V variants used the same engine block series, the 16V versions didn't use the different block like the automotive B2x4 with balance shafts. ==See also== * List of Volvo engines ==References== * ==External links== * Volvo Cars of N.A.

It is also used as a Japanese postal code mark since the introduction of the latter in 1968. Historically, it was used by the , which operated the postal service. The mark is a stylized katakana syllable te (テ), from the word . The mark was introduced on February 8th, 1887 (Meiji 20.2.8). ==Usage== To indicate a postal code, the mark is written first, and the postal code is written after. For example, one area of Meguro, Tokyo, would have \`〒153-0061\` written on any mail, in order to direct mail to that location. This usage has resulted in the inclusion of the mark into the Japanese character sets for computers, and thus eventually their inclusion into Unicode, where it can also be found on the Japanese Post Office emoji. In most keyboard-based Japanese input systems, it can be created by typing \\"yuubin\\" and then doing a kanji conversion. Of the versions shown to the right, the one on the far right (〒) is the standard mark used in addressing. A circled yūbin mark 16px is often used on maps to denote post offices, and a similar circled mark 16px was used for electrical certification of Category B appliances under a precursor to the Act on Product Safety of Electrical Appliances and Materials. The Unicode code chart, as of version 13.0, labels the \\"Circled Postal Mark\\" character (〶, U+3036) as \\"symbol for type B electronics\\".

Before the introduction of Unicode, the simple postal mark was encoded for Japanese use in JIS X 0208 (including the Shift JIS encoding). A mascot-stylised was additionally included in some vendor extensions of Shift JIS, including the KanjiTalk 7 variant of MacJapanese, and become part of a standardised Shift JIS variant (at a different location) with the 2000 publication of JIS X 0213. The ARIB extensions for JIS X 0208, specified by the Japanese broadcasting standards ARIB STD-B24 and ARIB STD-B62, includes a duplicate of the simple mark for use as a map symbol for a post office, as well as a circled variant. Earlier editions of the North Korean standard KPS 9566, such as the 1997 edition, included both the simple postal mark and a version in a downward-pointing triangle, which was proposed by the North Korean national body for addition to Unicode in 2001. In response to this proposal, the South Korean national body requested evidence for the symbol's use in North Korea, noting that the Japanese-style postal mark is not used in South Korea, which uses a circled 우 (i.e. ㉾) for a similar purpose. A report from a subsequent meeting between North and South Korean representatives from ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 2/WG 2 notes that the North Korean body had decided to review the character before discussing it further, and it was subsequently removed from KPS 9566 in 2003, leaving only the simple mark. The version with an enclosing triangle was eventually added to Unicode in version 13.0, on the basis of established usage of both the circled and triangular versions in certification for electrical appliances in Japan, but also intended to correspond to the KPS 9566-97 character. Emoji sets from Japanese cellular carriers included a building with a prominently displayed postal mark (in the simplest case, a postal mark enclosed within a building outline) as a pictograph for a post office; this was also adopted into Unicode in version 6.0. Although the most recent versions of Microsoft's Segoe UI Emoji also show a building, earlier versions from prior to Windows 10 Anniversary Update showed this emoji as a simple postal mark, appearing red in colour presentation. == See also == * * History of Japanese postal services * Japanese addressing system * Japanese typographic symbols * Japanese map symbols * Kazakhstani tenge (uses an almost identical symbol) ==References== ==External links== * Official Postal Site Category:Communications in Japan Category:Typographical symbols Category:Emoji ","title":"Japanese postal mark"},{"id":"2548148","text":"Fernando Tavares Sabino (October 12, 1923 – October 11, 2004) was a Brazilian writer and journalist. ==Life== Sabino was born in Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, the son of Dominic Sabino and D.

Serving grades five through twelve (though previously having a 4th grade pre-form), the school has a population of about 350 boys. Each grade is assigned a priest or a dedicated teacher as a \\"Form Master,\\" who follows the class over the years and is responsible for building a feeling of community. The school's roots lie with a group of Cistercians who came to Texas in 1956 to help found the University of Dallas, located adjacent to what would become the Cistercian campus. Later that year, an uprising in communist Hungary allowed a group from Zirc Abbey in western Hungary to escape, and they joined their colleagues in Texas, founding a new abbey near the University of Dallas campus. The monks of Zirc had a long tradition of teaching in the abbey's college preparatory schools, so in 1962 they started Cistercian Preparatory School to continue their work in secondary education. Noted for its academic rigor, Cistercian has been rated one of the most prestigious private schools in the Dallas-Fort Worth region, and was ranked #50 in Business Insider's 2015 ranking of the \\"smartest private high schools in the United States,\\" and as the second-best Catholic high school in the country by Niche in 2016. One distinguishing feature of the school is that many of its classes are taught by monks of the Cistercian Order from the adjacent Abbey of Our Lady of Dallas, who comprise 25% of the school's faculty. == Athletics == Students are encouraged to participate in sports in every season. Cistercian fields teams in eight varsity sports in three athletic seasons: football and cross country (fall); basketball, soccer, and swimming (winter); baseball, track & field, and tennis (spring). The school is a member of the Southwest Preparatory Conference, which hosts championship tournaments and meets at the end of every season. The school's mascot is the Hawk. Its colors are black and white. ==Notable alumni== *Will Ford Hartnett '74, former member of the Texas House of Representatives (1993–2013) *Geoff Marslett '92, independent filmmaker and professor *Ryan Sitton '93, member of the Texas Railroad Commission (2015– ) ==References== ==External links== * Category:Irving, Texas Category:Independent Schools Association of the Southwest Category:Catholic secondary schools in Texas Category:Educational institutions established in 1962 Category:Boys' schools in Texas Category:Private high schools in Dallas County, Texas ","title":"Cistercian Preparatory School"},{"id":"2548152","text":"Tewksbury Rock is a small, subsurface rock pinnacle located in Massachusetts Bay, within the city limits of Boston.

Noted for his unique Tigrinya- based compositions and lyrics, he was one of the most recognized figures among Eritrean musicians and celebrities and also the world. ==Early life== Abraham Afewerki was born in 1966 in Asmara, Eritrea. During the Eritrean War of Independence, Afewerki and his family fled the fighting and lived as refugees in Sudan. He was interested in music from an early age, taking up the harmonica. Afewerki joined the Eritrean People's Liberation Front (EPLF) at the age of 12, as a member of a cultural troupe which toured areas controlled by the EPLF. He began writing his own songs and music regarding the war, performing them from 1979 onwards. Abraham moved to Italy, where he learnt to play the krar and continued to write songs in the theme of Eritrean nationalism. After several years, he moved to the United States where he studied for a bachelor's degree with honours. ==Music career== Abraham’s first release, Wegahta (Sunrise), was released in 1991. During the following 15 years, Abraham released two more albums which further propelled his popularity among Eritreans. His songs were popular because his lyrics expressed strong and poetic images of Eritrea’s culture. His song \\"Abzelena Alina\\" (\\"Wherever We Are\\") became greatly popular in Eritrea and the world; his socially conscious words and evocative lyrics talked of the bravery of the nation. In his final release, entitled Semai (\\"Sky\\" in Tigrinya), Abraham collaborates with several Eritrean musicians, the result of which was an exquisite sound. Abraham continued to blend his music with jazz, R&B;, and Reggae rhythms at the same time maintaining his music’s originality and authenticity. One song from the album, \\"Semay Iyu Deretey\\" (\\"The Sky Is My Limit\\"), has become one of the popular songs in Eritrea. ==Death== In 2006, Abraham drowned when he tried to save a friend in the Red Sea near Massawa. The official Eritrean government version of the tragedy is that both men were in Massawa that day to film a video clip. They asked for a break from production and went out to swim. Abraham’s friend allegedly got his foot stuck in quick sand underwater & was drowning when Abraham came to rescue him. He had returned to Eritrea to produce a film musical. Abraham had been very vocal and critical of the current regime in Eritrea, which does not allow any opposition. Posthumously, Abraham continues to be held in high regard by his fellow Eritrean artists, who bear much appreciation and respect. His musical influence has also spread to Ethiopia where his music is reproduced by other musicians singing in a different language other than his native Tigrinya. ==Discography== He released the following albums in Eritrea: *1991: Wegahta (Sunrise) *1994: Tesfa'iya snqey (Hope is my supply/kit) *1998: MsTir fQri (Secret of Love) *2000: Hadera (Promise) *2006: Semai (Sky) ==Notes== ==References== * ==External links== * Category:1966 births Category:2006 deaths Category:People from Asmara Category:Eritrean singers Category:Deaths by drowning Category:Accidental deaths in Eritrea Category:20th-century singers Category:21st-century singers Category:Krar players ","title":"Abraham Afewerki"},{"id":"2548202","text":"Lawrence Stenhouse (29 March 1926-5 September 1982) was a British educational thinker who sought to promote an active role for teachers in educational research and curriculum development.

The festival has been held every August since 2003,GlobalFest - About GlobalFest and is organized by The Calgary Fireworks Festival Society. GlobalFest consists of different components: the OneWorld Festival (with up to 24 Cultural Pavilions, 14 ethnic food kiosks, and a 12 vendor Night Market) and the International Fireworks Festival (with up to 6 fireworks presentations from up to 5 international teams). ==Human Rights Forum== The GlobalFest Human Rights Forum presented by TD Bank Financial Group is a Calgary-based, week- long event that invites various speakers, guests, and experts to discuss pertinent issues relating to human rights and diversity. The Human Rights Forum seeks to build community dialogue by addressing various topics of racism and discrimination. Informed by the aims of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and its International Coalition of Cities Against Racism Initiative, the Human Rights Forum aims to highlight the Canadian Coalition of Municipalities Against Racism and Discrimination's (CCMARD) ten common commitments.More information can be found in the CCMARD handbook The 2010 Human Rights Forum took place from May 3 to 7 at the John Dutton Theatre within the Calgary Central Public Library. The theme topic for the 2010 Human Rights Forum focused on Youth addressing the following commitments: *Increase vigilance against systemic and individual racism and discrimination. *Support policing services in their efforts to be exemplary institutions in combating racism and discrimination. *Inform and support individuals who experience racism and discrimination. *Support measures to challenge racism and discrimination and promote diversity and equal opportunity in the education sector and in other forms of learning. *Promote respect, understanding and appreciation of cultural diversity and the inclusion of Aboriginal and racialized communities into the cultural fabric of the municipality. ==Youth Forum== The Human Rights Forum extended its programming in 2010 to include the GlobalFest Youth Forum, an additional program that includes youth directly. The 2010 GlobalFest Youth Forum featured UNITY Charity Presenting their \\"Hip Hop Away From Violence\\" program to five high schools in Calgary from April 26 to 30. UNITY Charity is a youth led and artist driven anti-violence group from Toronto that specializes in urban performance assemblies and artistic workshops. UNITY seeks to provide positive artistic outlets for youth to express themselves instead of expressing themselves through violence, drug use, stereotyping, bullying and other negative forms of self-expression. ==Fireworks Festival== The International Fireworks Festival is held at Elliston Park in Southeast Calgary and is presented by Trico Homes. Each night of the festival showcases a different nation. Participants attend by invitation of the organizers. Pyrotechnic displays take place over Elliston Park and are synchronized to music. Thus, these choreographed pyrotechnical arrangements are referred to as 'pyro- musicals'. In 2009 the organizers introduced a variety of artistic requirements that all fireworks designers must incorporate into their designs. In past years the fireworks were presented in the style of a competition with a competitor being limited to winning two years in a row before a mandatory year-long break would be implemented. As of 2009, the pyro-musical presentations have been presented in a festival process rather than as a competition. This new process has been introduced to better meet artistic and funding criteria set forward by various backing partners as well as to help better fulfill GlobalFest's mandate of promoting cultural diversity. Over the years several countries have participated in the pyro-musical aspect of GlobalFest: Canada, USA, Mexico, India, South Africa, Germany, Portugal, Hong Kong, China, Spain, Italy and Japan. New artistic requirements included a compulsory piece of music that must be incorporated by each competitor and a 25% minimum of each competitor's music that must be native to the representing country. This was done to challenge the designers, provide a better pyro- musical experience to the audience, and better meet the mandate of GlobalFest as a Multi-Cultural Festival. From 2012–2017, the compulsory piece was composed by local, Calgarian composer Donovan Seidle.

The pavilions would often include ethnic food, displays and entertainment. Cultural Pavilions included themes from Africa, Hispanic America, Middle East, Caribbean, Francophone, India, Italy, Mexico, Scotland, Ukraine and Vietnam. The OneWorld festival was originally co-organized with the International Avenue Arts and Culture Centre. In 2007, the pavilions were grouped together for the first time at Penbrooke Meadows Community Association and was visited by over 10,000 GlobalFest patrons. In 2008, a previously protected area of Elliston Park was opened up to the organizers and the move was made to transfer the cultural pavilions to Elliston Park and re-launch the OneWorld Village. The cultural organizations are also provided the opportunity to present their nations' foods in separate food kiosks, located adjacent to the OneWorld Village. GlobalFest patrons can now enjoy the OneWorld Festival in conjunction with the International Fireworks Festival each evening at the same location in Elliston Park. Cultural stages will feature music, dance and other artists presented by the cultural pavilion organizers within the OneWorld Village. The Calgary Foundation Centennial stage will also be presenting various artists to those patrons on the south side of Elliston Park. A third stage has been added to the site located in the OneWorld Cafe and International Bar. The Cafe stage will provide entertainment nightly prior to the fireworks as well as for an hour following the fireworks presentation. ==History== The idea for the festival started in 1994, when the newly established Calgary Fireworks Festival Society started looking for a safe firework launch site. It took until 2001 to discover Elliston Park and its lake. At the same time, the International Avenue Arts and Culture Centre was making plans for a multicultural festival in Forest Lawn. The two non-profit societies presented plans for a joint festival at Calgary's International Avenue Business Revitalisation Zone (a city department), and the festival began in 2003, with an audience of almost 100,000, including city residents and tourists. The site chosen for the fireworks display, Elliston Lake, is the second largest lake in Calgary (after Glenmore Reservoir), and was created close to a landfill site in 1978.FFWD article - GlobalFest may prove to be a boon for east Calgary’s Elliston Park The land has been owned by the city of Calgary since 1960 The area was used for agriculture for ten years, and Elliston Park opened in 1994. Over the years the park has been expanded by reclaiming land from the nearby landfill, bringing the total area to over 410 hectares, making it the city's second largest park (after Nose Hill). ==See also== *List of festivals in Calgary *Festivals in Alberta ==References== ==External links== * GlobalFest website Category:Festivals in Calgary Category:Fireworks in Canada Category:Recurring events established in 2003 Category:Festivals of multiculturalism Category:Multiculturalism in Canada Category:2003 establishments in Alberta Category:Annual events in Canada ","title":"GlobalFest"},{"id":"2548264","text":"Abeba Haile (born August 2, 1970) is a prominent Eritrean singer.

Upon hearing that Pusan had been captured, Yi immediately set out on an east course to Pusan, hoping to block Japanese naval advances along the coast to aid their land forces. His first encounter at Okpo (1 May 1592) was a decisive victory, destroying almost half of the ships of the docking Japanese fleet. Prior to the Okpo Campaign, Yi mainly patrolled the seas near his Jeolla Province, to fortify its position before he began moving westward, due to the call for help from Admiral Won Gyun. A number of battles were fought around the area, mainly minor skirmishes. However, Yi treated each battle with extreme care and made certain that he suffered few serious casualties. From his Okpo battle, the only casualty was a minor gunshot wound on an oarsman from stray musket fire. After the battle, Admiral Yi also destroyed few enemy skirmish ships at Happo and Jeokjinpo. == Second Campaign == Around the end of May, Admiral Yi set out again eastward and encountered another force around the Sacheon-Dangpo area, where he again engaged in minor skirmishes against the Japanese fleet. At Danghangpo, however, Yi met his first significant force of Japanese and forced the Japanese to withdraw, with heavy casualties. After securing this area (the last in the series of Jeolla coastal defenses), Admiral Yi decided to press the advantage of his enemy's inactivity and moved out to the Noryang-Hansando area. == Third Campaign == Around July, the Japanese forces had already reached Pyongyang and were laying siege to the city as the Yi court continued to flee northward to the border city of Uiju. At this time, the Japanese commanders sent out another massive fleet of 100 ships, consisting of their best warships, including the heavy Atakebune, under highly renowned commanders, to reinforce their troops near Pyongyang and to defeat Admiral Yi's \\"ravaging fleet\\". The two fleets met at Hansan Island - where the Japanese had been organizing - on the morning of July 3. What followed was a complete disgrace to the Japanese martial command. The Japanese war fleet was nearly annihilated while Koreans suffered virtually no losses. They also lost most of their reinforcements, many of whom were stranded on the island and met the fury of local residents. After this battle, Yi set up his headquarters on Hansan Island itself and began plans to attack the main Japanese base at Pusan harbor while the Japanese fleet commanders were ordered to avoid direct engagement with the Koreans. == Fourth Campaign == In September, Yi left his base at Hansan Island and went out against all odds to attack Busan harbor. While considered a great victory, Yi's principal purpose was to demoralize the Japanese. He was rather pragmatic, knowing that he could not win the war on his own merit. But he knew that by attacking at places where the Japanese were comfortable would not only demoralize them, it would also instill a great fear in them - a fear that persisted even into the Meiji restoration. Yi managed to leave with all of his ships intact, while inflicting damage on several hundred enemy ships still in their docks. == Aftermath == After attacking Busan, Yi retired to his Hansan Island base. For the rest of the year, he remained relatively inactive, letting the progress of Ming Chinese assistance on the land take its effect. He still controlled all of the naval routes leading to the northern lines, which forced the Japanese to take the less dependable and more hazardous routes on the eastern coast. This proved ineffective in stopping the Chinese and Korean advances, and eventually Hanseong was recaptured, while the Japanese retreated to their bases around Busan. Of course, the most obvious result was the devastating consequences of the Hansan Island Battle on the Japanese navy. In every future engagement, the Japanese commanders were afraid for their safety, considering Yi's manipulative use of the sea terrain, battle tactics, and frightening weapons as well as his innovative Geobukson. Principally because of this, Yi won every single naval engagement in his entire naval career. And after his temporary imprisonment due to a false charge against him, Yi returned with a small fleet of 13 ships and shattered an entire fleet of Japanese ships at Battle of Myeongnyang in 1597. Afterwards, Yi led his campaign to the final Battle of Noryang in 1598, where he was killed in the battle. == Progress of Battles during the Four Imjin Campaigns of Admiral Yi Sun-sin== Map of Admiral Yi Sun-Shin's Naval Campaigns - 1592 ===First Campaign (May 1592)=== #Okpo Battle (Hangul : 옥포해전, Hanja : 玉浦海戰) #Battle of Happo (Hangul : 합포해전, Hanja : 合浦海戰) #Battle of Jeokjinpo (Hangul : 적진포해전, Hanja : 赤珍浦海戰) ===Second Campaign (June 1592)=== #Battle of Sacheon (Hangul : 사천포해전, Hanja : 泗川浦海戰) #Battle of Dangpo (Hangul : 당포해전, Hanja : 唐浦海戰) #1st Battle of Danghangpo (Hangul : 제1차 당항포해전, Hanja : 唐項浦海戰) #Battle of Yulpo (Hangul : 율포해전, Hanja : 栗浦海戰) ===Third Campaign (July 1592)=== #Battle of Hansan Island (Hangul : 한산도대첩, Hanja : 閑山島大捷) #Battle of Angolpo (Hangul : 안골포해전, Hanja : 安骨浦海戰) ===Fourth Campaign (November 1592)=== #Battle of Jangnimpo (Hangul : 장림포해전, Hanja : 長林浦海戰) #Battle of Hwajungumi (Hangul : 화준구미해전, Hanja : 花樽龜尾海戰) #Battle of Dadaepo (Hangul : 다대포해전, Hanja : 多大浦海戰) #Battle of Seopyeongpo (Hangul : 서평포해전, Hanja :西平浦海戰) #Battle of Jeolyeong Island (Hangul :절영도해전, Hanja : 絶影島海戰) #Battle of Busan (Hangul : 부산포해전, Hanja : 釜山浦海戰) == See also == *List of Korea-related topics *History of Korea *Japanese invasions of Korea (1592-1598) *List of naval battles during the Japanese invasions of Korea (1592-1598) *Joseon Navy *Yi Sun-sin == References == *Nanjung Ilgi (Hangul : 난중일기; Hanja : 亂中日記) ; 89-344-0141-9 *Admiral Yi Campaigns during the Japanese Invasions of Korea (in Korean) *Maps of Naval Battles during the Japanese Invasions of Korea (in Korean) *https://web.archive.org/web/20061005122642/http://www.boseong51.net/user/ftp/free/LeeSS/IMJIN-1OKPO.html Category:1592 in Asia Category:Conflicts in 1592 ","title":"Joseon naval campaigns of 1592"},{"id":"2548300","text":"The Handle-o-Meter is a testing machine developed by Johnson & Johnson and now manufactured by Thwing-Albert that measures the \\"handle\\", i.e. a combination of surface friction and flexibility of sheeted materials.

Copeland later managed Sting's musical and acting career. In 1979, Copeland founded the I.R.S. Records label, producing R.E.M., The Bangles, Berlin, The Cramps, Dead Kennedys, The Alarm, The Go-Go's, and others. ==Background== Copeland was born in London, England, to Miles Axe Copeland, Jr., a CIA officer from Birmingham, Alabama, United States, and Lorraine Adie, a Scot who worked in British intelligence. The family lived throughout the Middle East, in particular Syria, Egypt, and Lebanon. At an early age, Copeland and his brothers were fluent in Arabic. Copeland attended Birmingham-Southern College in Birmingham, Alabama, in 1962. He graduated with a degree in history and political science. From 1966 to 1969, Copeland attended the American University of Beirut, earning a degree in economics. This was also where he promoted his first concert. After college, he moved to London, met two progressive rock musicians at a club, and helped them form Wishbone Ash. ===BTM and Illegal Records=== In 1974, Copeland founded the management agency and record label BTM (British Talent Management) and signed a number of progressive rock acts such as Squeeze, Renaissance and Curved Air. In the summer of 1975, he organized a multi-band tour of European music festivals, named Star-Trucking, which featured several BTM bands as well as Soft Machine, the Mahavishnu Orchestra and Lou Reed. However, Reed's failure to appear at any of the shows and other logistical issues resulted in significant losses for Star-Trucking, and ultimately to the failure of BTM.Sutcliffe, Phil & Fielder, Hugh (1981). L'Historia Bandido. London and New York: Proteus Books. . Pages 15–16. In 1976, BTM closed down. BTM's end coincided with the beginning of the UK's Punk/New Wave movement and led Copeland to co-found Illegal Records, Deptford Fun City Records, New Bristol Records, and to sign the Cortinas, Chelsea, and the Models to Step Forward Records in 1977. ===The Police=== In 1978, Copeland became manager of his brother Stewart's band, The Police. Copeland shepherded the group to become one of the biggest bands of the 1980s, peaking with a concert for 70,000 people at Shea Stadium and the number one single for 1983, \\"Every Breath You Take\\". He continued to manage Sting through seven solo albums. Copeland was not, however, included in the reunion era of The Police, leading to a 2007 interview in which Copeland lamented that money was the issue. ===I.R.S. Records=== The success of The Police and the novel methods used to popularize them enabled Copeland to found I.R.S. Records through a deal with A&M; Records. Copeland's I.R.S. label had hits with the Buzzcocks, R.E.M., The Cramps, Fine Young Cannibals, The Bangles and many others, including a number one album with his label's group The Go-Go's. ===Copeland International Arts=== Copeland owns and operates CIA (Copeland International Arts), which includes the Bellydance Superstars, Celtic Crossroads, Otros Aires, Zohar, and Beats Antique. Much of the CIA catalog initially included Middle Eastern, world music, Irish, tango, flamenco, and Polynesian styles. The label later signed mainstream artists. ==Personal life== Another of Copeland's brothers, Ian Copeland, was a booking agent who described much of the New Wave adventures of Miles, Stewart and himself in his book Wild Thing. ==See also== * Bellydance Superstars * Ark 21 ==References== ==External links== * Transcript of Miles Copeland III on Politically Incorrect with Bill Maher * Official website Category:Birmingham–Southern College alumni Category:American record producers Category:American music industry executives Category:1944 births Category:Living people Category:The Police Category:I.R.S.

Salesforce Tower, 110 Bishopsgate (formerly Heron Tower) is a commercial skyscraper in London. It stands tallProject description including its mast making it the tallest building in the City of London financial district and the third tallest in Greater London and the United Kingdom, after the Shard in Southwark and One Canada Square at Canary Wharf. 110 Bishopsgate is located on Bishopsgate and is bordered by Camomile Street, Outwich Street and Houndsditch. Construction of the building started in 2007 and was completed in 2011. It is owned by Heron International and is still popularly known as Heron Tower, though following a naming dispute in 2014 involving the tenant Salesforce.com the City of London planning committee made it clear they would rule in favour of the property being officially named 110 Bishopsgate, although the application was withdrawn before it went to committee. The tower initially struggled to attract tenants in the depths of the Great Recession, but is now fully let. ==Design and planning== Designed by architects Kohn Pedersen Fox, the height of 110 Bishopsgate was planned to be only , identical to that of Tower 42, the City of London's then tallest building since 1980. It attracted some controversy when first announced due to its proximity to St Paul's Cathedral when viewed from Waterloo Bridge. English Heritage was notably vocal in expressing concerns. A public inquiry was subsequently held, the outcome of which was decided by deputy prime minister John Prescott, who ruled in the developers' favour. The tower was given final approval for construction in July 2002. Three years later, the project had yet to begin construction. In September 2005 the Heron Property Corporation submitted a planning application to increase the height of its approved building. Heron's revised plans now proposed a tall tower topped by a mast, giving it a total height of . Although the design was largely identical to the previous scheme, the tower's crown and southern façades were refined. In January 2006, the revised project was approved by the City of London Corporation. In February 2013 it was revealed in The Times that backers of the tower included Prince Abdul Aziz bin Fahd, a son of the late King Fahd of Saudi Arabia.The Times, page 37, headline Fish in the foyer but not enough tenants to keep investors in Heron Tower happy ===Interior=== 110 Bishopsgate was designed to feature a concierge-style entrance and reception area, incorporating a aquarium containing around 1,200 fish. The aquarium is the largest privately owned example in the United Kingdom and contains over 60 species of fish in an entirely sustainable ecosystem; the species were selected by expert biologists and animal curators to ensure compatibility and adaptability to the environment. The tank is attended to by a team of two full-time fish attendants, who feed the fish a diet rich in natural ingredients according to their requirements and monitor the tank for water chemistry and fish health, and two to three part-time divers who clean the rockwork and glass regularly. A bar-restaurant called The Drift occupies part of the ground and first floors. There is a restaurant and \\"sky bar\\" leased to Sushi Samba and Duck & Waffle, both open to the public, on floors 38–40. Situated above the City and accessed by scenic lifts from a dedicated entrance on Bishopsgate, the restaurant and bar also have external terraces. ===Environment=== The building uses photovoltaic cells to generate renewable energy, allowing it to achieve a BREEAM rating of 'excellent' in January 2010. ==Construction== In March 2007, it was confirmed that Heron had signed a funding deal with the State General Reserve Fund of Oman to provide the equity for the development. The works were carried out by Skanska and completed in January 2011. ===Gallery=== File:HeronTower, Bishopsgate.

However, in a difficult lettings market the building struggled to find enough tenants to fill it and in September 2013 only 59% of the available office space had been let. As a result, the project required refinancing, with Starwood Capital Group stepping in to provide a £288 million refinancing facility to avoid the project going into receivership. Subsequent agreed tenants included the pensions company Partnership Assurance, investment fund manager Securis Investment Partners, stockbroker Westhouse Securities, POWA, recruitment firm Harvey Nash, Openwork, and Salesforce.com, the software firm. As part of Salesforce's deal to take an additional 50,000 sq ft on levels 28-31 on a 15-year lease, it reportedly purchased naming rights to the tower, just as it had for its headquarters building in San Francisco. After much deliberation with the City of London planners, the building's official name was confirmed as 110 Bishopsgate, with Salesforce Tower able to be used as an informal name. Landmark has offered serviced office space from floors 17-19 of the tower since 2011, achieving above-average occupancy rates for London.Business Centre of the Month: Landmark’s Heron Tower, searchofficespace.com, 13 December 2013 The top floors of the building are occupied by the Sushi Samba and Duck & Waffle restaurants. Proskauer Rose, another law firm, moved into the building in 2015, taking out an 18,000 sq ft lease. The London office of the U.S. publicly listed low cost online brokerage platform with clients in two hundred countries, Interactive Brokers (S&P; 400 Component) is also present on level 20. In January 2016, it was confirmed that the building was fully let. == Heron Plaza == The tower was designed to form the centrepiece of a larger Heron Plaza development, incorporating new public spaces and a network of squares and gardens. In July 2009, Heron International confirmed that it had signed heads of terms with Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts to develop a mixed-use project adjacent to 110 Bishopsgate. In January 2011, Heron announced that planning permission for the development had been secured. In August 2014, Heron sold the site, with planning permission, to UOL Group, who said it would push ahead with the scheme and operate the hotel under its 'Pan Pacific' brand. ==See also== * List of tallest buildings and structures in London * 100 Bishopsgate * City of London landmarks * The Heron * Double-deck elevator * Tower 42 ==References== ==External links== *Official Heron Tower website *Project page of Skanska *Video of Heron Tower on YouTube * * https://www.commerciallistings.cbre.co.uk/uk/en- GB/listings/property/details/GB-Plus-437870/salesforce-tower-110-bishopsgate- ec2n-4ay?view=isLetting Category:Skyscrapers in the City of London Category:Kohn Pedersen Fox buildings Category:Office buildings completed in 2011 Category:Skyscraper office buildings in London ","title":"Heron Tower"},{"id":"2548327","text":"KCPW-FM (88.3 MHz) is a public radio station in Salt Lake City, Utah. It airs local news and music programming, as well as network shows from American Public Media, Public Radio International, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and the BBC. It broadcasts from studios at the Salt Lake City Public Library in Downtown Salt Lake City at Library Square. KCPW-FM is owned by Wasatch Public Media. Its previous transmitter was located atop the Wells Fargo Center in downtown Salt Lake City for much of its history. It is currently located in the Oquirrh Mountains Range southwest of West Valley City. The 88.3 FM frequency does not broadcast in stereo audio, to improve reception in marginal signal areas. Due to other stations on 88.3 FM and adjacent frequencies in nearby cities, KCPW-FM has an effective radiated power of 450 watts. It cannot use as much power as most of the other Salt Lake City FM stations. ==History== On August 9, 1991, Community Wireless of Park City, Inc., received a construction permit to build a new FM non-commercial station in Salt Lake City from the Federal Communications Commission. The FCC assigned it the call sign KBQA.Broadcasting Yearbook 1992 page A-357 Community Wireless already had an FM station on 91.9 MHz in Park City, Utah, a ski resort community about 50 miles east of Salt Lake City. It later added other stations around Utah simulcasting its programming. On November 1, 1992, the Salt Lake City station officially signed on the air, with the new call letters KCPW-FM. In 2005, Community Wireless acquired an AM radio station licensed to Tooele, Utah, at 1010 kHz, which also took the call sign KCPW.Broadcasting & Cable Yearbook 2006 page D-512 The AM station is powered in the daytime at 50,000 watts, giving the station a much wider coverage area. But in January 2008, Community Wireless decided to sell the 1010 AM frequency. Programming was switched to airing the BBC World Service around the clock until a Catholic organization agreed to acquire the station for religious programming. On March 28, 2008, Wasatch Public Media signed a letter of intent to purchase KCPW-FM. A sales contract was signed in June 2008. Had this not occurred, KCPW-FM would have instead been sold to the Educational Media Foundation for a national Christian contemporary format. KCPW's AM 1010 facility was separately sold to Immaculate Heart Radio. It became KIHU that August. KCPW-FM ended its longtime National Public Radio (NPR) membership on June 24, 2013, allowing the station to reduce expenses as well as decrease duplication with the area's primary NPR network affiliate, 90.1 KUER-FM. KCPW continues to carry national programming supplied by Public Radio International, American Public Media, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and the BBC. The station also continues to produce its local programming. In June 2014, the station announced that it would need to raise $42,000 by July 3 in order to pay for its American Public Media programming; if the goal was not met, KCPW would have closed down and the money donated during the fund drive would be returned to the contributors. The goal was reached on July 2, 2014. ==Local Programs== On Fridays at 9 a.m., KCPW airs Behind The Headlines, hosted by Roger McDonough, featuring reporters from the Salt Lake Tribune.

Frenchburg is located along the Northwestern Turnpike (U.S. Route 50) where the Little Cacapon River is formed by the confluence of the North and South forks of the Little Cacapon east of Shanks. Frenchburg is also the location of the southern terminus of Little Cacapon River Road (County Route 50/9) on U.S. Route 50. Frenchburg is primarily known for the events that took place there during the American Civil War. ==History== The community most likely was named after the local French family. ===American Civil War=== In its earliest days, Frenchburg consisted of a general store and a wagon repair shop. During the American Civil War, Frenchburg was a village consisting of a cluster of houses and a mill, operated by the Cummins family, along the Northwestern Turnpike. The town was burned by Union troops in late 1861. It was believed by the Union troops that Frenchburg's residents were aiding Confederate bushwhackers. Sergeant John C. Leps, along with seven men, departed the Confederate camp near Blue's Gap and fired upon a detachment of Union soldiers in the vicinity of Frenchburg. The ambush wounded and killed several men. Afterwards, Union General Frederick Lander and other officers sent out word to the residents of Frencburg and the surrounding area that if bushwhacking were to occur again against Union troops in the district, its residents would face punishment. While Frenchburg's residents were most likely not responsible for aiding bushwhackers in the area, General Lander gave orders that the town be burned. Confederate troops and partisans used a \\"back road\\", which presently consists of parts of Little Cacapon River Road (CR 50/9), Three Churches Hollow Road (CR 5/4), and Don McCauley Road (CR 28/1), that ran from Frenchburg to Buffalo Hollow near Hanging Rocks. After the war, Frenchburg's Camp Walker served as a site for reunions of Confederate veterans and their families until the 1930s. ==References== Category:Unincorporated communities in Hampshire County, West Virginia Category:Unincorporated communities in West Virginia Category:Northwestern Turnpike Category:Hampshire County, West Virginia, in the American Civil War ","title":"Frenchburg, West Virginia"},{"id":"2548379","text":"High View is an unincorporated community in Hampshire County, West Virginia, United States.

Francesco Robortello. ==As scholar== Robortello, who was born in Udine, was an editor of rediscovered works of Antiquity, who taught philosophy and rhetoric, as well as ethics (following Aristotle), and Latin and Greek, roving from Padua through universities at Lucca, Pisa, Venice, Padua, and Bologna before finally returning to Padua in 1560. Robortello's scientific approach to textual emendations laid the groundwork for modern Hermeneutics. His commentary on Aristotle's Poetics formed the basis for Renaissance and 17th century theories of comedy, influential in writing for the theatre everywhere save in England. At the same time he was the conservative Aristotelian philosopher who urged woman to submit her will to that of her husband on the basis of her moral weakness, in his libro politicos: Aristotelis disputatio (Venice, 1552, p. 175, quoted Comensoli 1989). He followed his In librum Aristotelis de arte poetica explicationes (1548), in which he emended the Latin version of Alessandro de’ Pazzi (published 1536), with a paraphrase of Horace's Ars poetica and with explications of genres missing in the surviving text of Aristotle: De Satyra, De Epigrammate, De Comoedia, De Salibus, De Elegia. In the fields of philology and history he sustained controversies in print with Carolus Sigonius and Vincenzo Maggi in the form of essay-like orations, correcting the editions published in Venice by Aldus Manutius, and even philological missteps of Erasmus. These brief essays were collected and published at intervals. A convention of surveys of Italian linguistics (Gensini 1993) is to start with Robortello. Robortello died at Padua, where, in the 1550s, one of his pupils was Giacomo Zabarella. Another pupil was Jan Kochanowski, a poet who wrote both in Polish and Latin and introduced the ideas, forms and spirit of the Renaissance into Polish literature. ==Main works== *De historica facultate disputatio (alternatively as De arte historica), 1548; 1567.

The grenade was composed of three separate pieces that were stored in different crates until use: the warhead and sleeve, spring-loaded handle, and fuze tube. They were assembled and issued only before combat. The warhead and handle were screwed together and carried in a grenade pouch and the fuzes were wrapped in waxed paper and carried separately in the pouch's internal pocket. There was a hole in the outer handle to the right of the thumb catch that lined up with bars of paint on the inner handle, making a colored dot - a white dot meant safe and a red dot meant the handle assembly was cocked. It would not be armed unless the fuze tube had been inserted, which would be done only before throwing. ==Use== Before arming, a locking catch on the outer handle must be released by flipping it to the left, exposing the white dot in the cutout. (This unlocks the inner and outer handles; the inner handle remains fixed and the outer handle rotates.) The operator then grasps the warhead with their offhand and grips the handle with their throwing hand. The handle is then pulled back, rotated clockwise to the right and pushed in; a red dot will appear in the window to indicate it was now cocked. The thumb safety is now pushed to the right to cover the red dot in the cutout, making it safe. The top of the warhead had a metal cover over the fuze well that was pushed aside, allowing the fuse to be inserted; it is disarmed by pushing the catch open, causing the fuze to pop out and be retrieved. The operator arms the fuze by flipping the switch to the left, exposing the red dot. The operator then throws the grenade; a good throw could send the grenade 30 to 40 metres. The forward momentum of the head and the spring-loaded handle cause the fuze clip to drop back and then move forward, striking the fuze and beginning the time delay. Upon detonation the shell fragments in rectangular, thin fragments, which, along with the casing and detonator fragments, decelerate rapidly in air. Due to the fragments' rapid loss of velocity, the kill radius is small, making this grenade an \\"offensive\\" type. The fragmentation kill radius was approximately 15 metres with the sleeve and 10 metres without. As with most grenades of this era, there is potential for large fragment projection a great distance further than the throw. The grenade was unusual but not unique, in that it had an optional \\"jacket\\" – a thick metal fragmentation sleeve weighing an average of 270 grams. When fitted over the grenade the sleeve improves the kill radius by producing a number of diamond-shaped, heavier fragments. With the jacket installed the grenade was said to be in \\"defensive\\" mode. ==History== It was designed to replace the ageing Model 1914 grenade and was used during World War II. The grenade was complicated to use and manufacture. After the German invasion of the USSR, the simple and crude RG-42 was developed to slowly replace it. Axis forces used captured stores as the HG 337(r), or Handgranate 337 (russische). ==See also== * Model 24 grenade * List of Russian weaponry ==External links== * Finnish Junkyard * Soviet Hand Grenades (Intelligence Bulletin, 1946) Category:Hand grenades of the Soviet Union Category:World War II infantry weapons of the Soviet Union Category:Fragmentation grenades ","title":"RGD-33 grenade"},{"id":"2548440","text":"\\"Threads\\" is an episode from Season 8 of the science fiction television series Stargate SG-1.

Teal'c and Bra'tac are awarded the title Bloodkin by the new Free Jaffa Nation, following the defeat of the Replicators and the Goa'uld. Jack O'Neill refuses to accept that Daniel Jackson is dead, believing that Daniel has managed to Ascend. Daniel finds himself in a strange ethereal diner full of people, Daniel recognizes Oma Desala. He learns that this place is a projection of a meeting place for Ascended beings. The diner is full of other Ascended Ancients, who refuse to speak with Daniel because of the rules of the Ascended. One other man, Jim, seems to be arguing with Oma, and shows Daniel a newspaper detailing Anubis' plan to retake Dakara and use the Dakara Superweapon to kill all life in the galaxy. Luring most of the Jaffa away, Anubis regains the weapon when he recaptures Dakara. Back in the Ascended Diner, Oma explains she has been punished for helping people, like Daniel, Ascend. Daniel then realizes that Anubis is half-Ascended, and Oma helped him Ascend. The other Ancients refused to completely de-ascend Anubis as part of Oma's punishment for breaking the rules, despite the fact that he is still a threat to the galaxy. Daniel then realizes Jim is Anubis - Anubis' chosen manifested form in his half-protrusion into the Ascended realm. Back on Earth, the gate dials when Anubis activates the weapon on every gate in the galaxy. However, back in the Ascended realm, Daniel has persuaded Oma to take responsibility for Anubis. She stands up to fight Anubis, and all of the other ancients turn in surprise. Anubis laughs, saying that she cannot possibly defeat him, as he is kept alive as punishment, and Oma takes Anubis into the Ascended realm to fight him there and prevent him from acting in the galaxy. Daniel is returned to the SGC from the Ascended Realm. SG-1 celebrates with a fishing trip to Jack's cottage. ==Production== The episode originally aired as a 63-minute piece, but an edited 45-minute version exists for syndication. When the season was initially released on DVD, the release contained the shortened 45-minute version. Due to complaints, MGM offered a rebate, whereby people could send in a proof of purchase from the DVD with the shortened episode to receive a DVD with the original episode. When the season was re- released in the slimline cases, it contained the full 63-minute episode as did the standard Region 2 version of the Season 8 boxset.

The episode features known voice actor Dan Castellaneta, who voices Homer Simpson in The Simpsons. The episode was written by executive producer Robert C. Cooper, the episode was directed by Andy Mikita. The episode received a below average Nielsen household rating and received no syndication rating to compare. The episode got strong reviews from major media publishers worldwide. \\"Citizen Joe\\" follows an Indiana barber (portrayed by Dan Castellaneta) who carries the Ancient Technology Activation gene (ATA Gene) and has his life ruined when, through an Ancient device, he begins to have visions of SG-1's missions from season one to season eight. His life is given back to him when Jack O'Neill informs his nearly divorced wife of what had been going on. This episode is a clip show. ==Plot== The episode opens with Jack O'Neill walking into his kitchen, talking on the phone to Samantha Carter about his \\"world famous omelette\\", when a man O'Neill has never met bursts in with a gun claiming that O'Neill has ruined his life. The viewer is then taken to a flashback 7 years earlier where Joe, the man in O'Neill's house, is at a garage sale and picks up a mysterious black stone. When he does, he receives a vision of SG-1 going through the Stargate against orders in the season 1 episode \\"Within the Serpent's Grasp\\". He buys the stone and, as the episode progresses, continuously receives more and more visions of the exploration team. Joe, unable to create or tell amusing jokes or stories of his own, tells of the visions he sees as if they were stories he had conjured out of thin air. To start with, he tells these visions to his son and the customers in his barbershop, entertaining them where he had previously been nothing but a bore. Later, at the suggestion of his wife, he starts to write them down and send them in to various magazines (all of which reject them) instead of telling each and every individual the tiniest of details relating to SG-1. As the episode goes on, skipping ahead in years, the people he tells start to get tired of the tales of SG-1 and, eventually, they stop coming to his barbershop. Despite his wife's urging, telling him to stop writing the episodes down, he continues to type and becomes convinced that the visions are actually happening. After years of too-intense focus on SG-1, long since passed into obsession, his wife leaves with their son. At this point he tries to find evidence that what he has been seeing is real, collecting data on mysterious stellar phenomenon and unexplained deaths, but is unable to contact Colonel O'Neill. Eventually, he tracks down where O'Neill lives, bringing the viewer to the opening scene. It is then discovered that the reason Joe has been seeing the visions, flashes of the life of Jack O'Neill, is because of an Ancient long-range communication device brought back from P3R-233. The device, which was activated by O'Neill when he touched a mysterious black stone in Daniel Jackson's lab, connects two minds together telepathically and Joe, who possesses the same Ancient gene as O'Neill, activated the companion device when he touched the stone at the garage sale. That stone, we find out, was discovered by the grandfather of the garage sales operator and had been found at a dig in Egypt. When Jack had been on the base, writing his mission-reports of their off-world adventures, the stone in Daniel's lab transmitted his thoughts to Joe. Conversely, O'Neill had been seeing visions of Joe's everyday life periodically, as the two devices could work in either direction; Jack never said anything because he found the visions \\"relaxing.\\" At the close of the episode O'Neill helps Joe start to piece his life back together by personally talking to Joe's wife. Just as the camera pans out, O'Neill begins by telling Joe and his wife that \\"it's all true\\". ==Production== Dan Castellaneta, who guest stars as Joe Spencer, is the voice of Homer Simpson on The Simpsons, which has been established as O'Neill's favorite television program. Joe also mentions that he sees O'Neill's analogy of Montgomery Burns as Goa'uld. Richard Dean Anderson would guest star on The Simpsons episode \\"Kiss Kiss, Bang Bangalore\\" the following year written by Castellaneta. On the European and Australian DVD releases of Season 8, this is the 18th episode, not the 15th. The previous episode to \\"Citizen Joe\\" is \\"Full Alert\\" and the next episode is \\"Moebius Part 1\\" on those DVDs. Only the Region 1 DVD set has a commentary for this episode. Jonas Quinn (portrayed by Corin Nemec) is mentioned in this episode for the first time since \\"Death Knell\\". Bruce Woloshyn (digital effects supervisor) appears in a cameo as the garage sale homeowner who sells Joe Spencer the Ancient stone device. == References == ==External links== * Citizen Joe at mgm.com * Category:Stargate SG-1 episodes Category:2005 American television episodes Category:Clip shows ","title":"Citizen Joe"},{"id":"2548448","text":"Full Alert may refer to: * Full Alert (film), 1997 Hong Kong film * An episode of Stargate SG-1 (season 8) ","title":"Full Alert"},{"id":"2548454","text":"Map highlighting the Midland–Odessa Combined Statistical Area Midland–Odessa is a metropolitan area located in West Texas approximately half-way between El Paso and Fort Worth, Texas. This combined statistical area (CSA) is made up of two metropolitan statistical areas (the Midland MSA and the Odessa MSA), and comprises three counties: Martin, Midland and Ector counties. The Midland–Odessa CSA is informally known as The Petroplex. In the past, the cities of Midland and Odessa experienced a rivalry of bitter competition and political intrigue. Since the early 1990s, the nature of the rivalry has changed into one of friendly competition and economic cooperation. The Midland–Odessa area today is marketed as \\"Two Cities, no Limits.\\" ==Communities== ===Cities=== *Ackerly *Goldsmith *Midland *Odessa *Stanton ===Census-designated places=== *Gardendale *West Odessa ===Unincorporated communities=== * Greenwood * Lenorah * Notrees * Penwell * Tarzan ==Geography and climate== The Midland–Odessa combined statistical area, informally known as The Petroplex, akin to the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex, is located along Interstate 20 in West Texas in a petroleum rich area called the Permian Basin. The Permian Basin extends into the South Plains region just south of Lubbock, Texas, extending westward into southeastern New Mexico. Midland–Odessa enjoys a climate typical of the resort cities of the Southwest United States. The terrain type is described as semi-arid mesquite-mixed grassland subtropical steppe. Winters are typically mild with a few seasonable cold spells. In the spring the wind is quite strong and the summer can bring extended heat waves with many consecutive days with highs of 100 degrees or more. The average rainfall of Midland–Odessa is 14.96 inches. Midland–Odessa is located in zone 8 according to the USDA 2003 Plant Hardiness Map. On average the area experiences 316 days of sunshine a year. ==Combined statistical area== The Midland–Odessa, Texas, combined statistical area (CSA) is made up of two metropolitan statistical areas (MSA) encompassing three counties. The CSA includes Martin and Midland counties in the Midland MSA, and Ector County in the Odessa MSA. The Midland–Odessa CSA encompasses 2,720 sq mi (7,044 km) of area, of which 2,713 sq mi (7,027 km) is land and 6.6 sq mi (18 km) is water. ===Demographics=== As of the census of 2000, there were 237,132 people, 86,591 households, and 62,647 families residing within the CSA. The racial makeup of the CSA was 75.47% White, 5.77% African American, 0.74% Native American, 0.78% Asian, 0.04% Pacific Islander, 14.83% from other races, and 2.38% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 35.84% of the population. The median income for a household in the CSA was $35,117, and the median income for a family was $41,819. Males had a median income of $33,778 versus $23,013 for females. The per capita income for the CSA was $17,700. ==Economy== An industrial area of Midland–Odessa as seen from Interstate 20 The economy of the area is heavily dependent on the petroleum industry and has experienced a series of booms and busts as the price of crude oil has fluctuated. The Permian Basin is the source of the New York Mercantile Exchange's benchmark West Texas Intermediate Crude. Traditionally, the core cities of Midland and Odessa have played very distinct roles in the petroleum industry. Midland is home to most of the corporate offices and has a predominantly white-collar population. Odessa by contrast is home to mostly blue-collar workers and industrial facilities. In 2003 Family Dollar constructed its seventh distribution center, in its industrial complex, since then Telvista, an incoming call center, and Coca-Cola Enterprises have relocated to this complex located on Interstate 20. In even-numbered years, Odessa hosts the Permian Basin International Oil Show--the world's largest inland petroleum exposition --at the Ector County Coliseum. In recent years, both cities have made efforts to diversify into additional industries to reduce their dependence on the petroleum industry. Midland–Odessa is well positioned to become an energy nexus for the region and for the United States as a whole. The metropolitan area is home to two major natural gas powerplants and in July 2006 it was announced that Odessa was one of four possible sites for a FutureGen zero- emissions coal-fired powerplant (which eventually was awarded to Mattoon, Illinois). The Permian Basin is also home to several windfarms and the city of Andrews is a candidate site for an experimental high temperature nuclear reactor. This focus on new sources of alternative energy in addition to petroleum has led some to refer to the Permian Basin as the Energy Basin. The recent high price of crude oil has led to a significant economic boom in the area. ==Transportation== Midland–Odessa is served by Midland International Air and Space Port (MAF), located between the core cities in Terminal and has since been annexed into Midland proper. This airport serves as a regional hub for cities and towns throughout the Permian Basin and as a gateway to Big Bend National Park. Odessa Schlemeyer Airport and Midland Air Park also serve as an option for smaller jets. The spirit of cooperation can be seen in the Midland Odessa Transportation Alliance (MOTRAN) and its centerpiece project \\"La Entrada al Pacifico\\" or \\"Entrance to the Pacific\\". La Entrada al Pacifico is an official trade corridor that connects the Mexican port city of Topolobampo on the west coast of Mexico with major markets in the Eastern and North Eastern United States and includes an inland port facility to be located in Midland–Odessa. ===2019 shooting=== Main article: 2019 West Texas shooting Eight people were killed, including the perpetrator, and 25 others were injured on the Interstate 20 between Midland and Odessa.

The episode was written by Joseph Mallozzi and Paul Mullie, and directed by Will Waring. This was the only episode in the eighth season to receive a syndication rating, but was also one of the lowest rated of the season on the Nielsen household ratings. The episode got strong reviews from major media publishers worldwide. \\"Lockdown\\" is about the discovery of an outbreak of disease which first occurred in the Russian Federation, but later on infects personnel of Stargate Command. The outbreak is later revealed to be the ethereal remains of Anubis. At the same time, Jack O'Neill stops the recruiting process for SG-1 leaving Samantha Carter as the new leader of SG-1 throughout season 8. Anubis tries to take new hosts but is eventually defeated and forced to a destination chosen by Carter, a frozen, barren planet. ==Plot== Several months after the destruction of Anubis' fleet, Stargate Command gets a new member in the form of Russian Air Force Colonel Alexi Vaselov (Russian: Алексей Вaсильев) who promptly asks General O'Neill for a place in SG-1. After the general rejects this request, Daniel talks to Vaselov about it, but the colonel suddenly collapses. When he wakes up again, he doesn't remember anything since he was in Russia, and his body shows signs of extensive viral damage. Gen O'Neill is concerned that there may be a contagion on the base, and orders Daniel to the infirmary just as he is about to leave on a mission with SG-11. Daniel suddenly pulls out his gun and injures several people, yelling for the gate to be opened, before he is stopped by O'Neill and Teal'c. O'Neill orders for no one to enter or leave the base to avoid spreading possible disease. Meanwhile, Vaselov begins to remember what happened—that he felt like being trapped in his own body—and he blames himself for what has happened. It is also discovered that a Russian cosmonaut from the International Space Station died a week after returning to Russia, exhibiting the same symptoms as Vaselov, and that Vaselov was with him when he died. Later, Daniel wakes up and quickly remembers that he was taken over by Anubis. It turns out that the former System Lord, thanks to his half-ascended form as a dark specter, can easily travel between hosts. He got into the cosmonaut's body from space debris, and is moving from person to person to get to the stargate. The members of SGC conclude that Anubis plans to leave through the stargate rather than use his ascended powers, since that would draw attention from the Ancients. However, he needs a body in order to get through the stargate. In the meantime, Anubis is easily eluding capture, so the SGC must execute a bold plan to stop him. This plan involves splitting the base into three zones. Power to the stargate is shut off, and is only accessible from Zone 1. The gate itself, and its surrounding areas, is in Zone 2. Hallways between the zones and into the gateroom are blocked using drop-down steel doors, and these can only be opened from Zone 3. All staff are restricted to one section only—no movement between sections is allowed. However, Anubis takes over Carter (who is in the section controlling the \\"lockdown\\"), and makes her schedule a program to open the doors temporarily. She goes into the new control room and begins dialing the gate. O'Neill tries to stop her. With no other options, Jack and Major Kearney trigger the self-destruct, only for Jack to zat Kearney, revealing that Anubis is now possessing Jack's body. With the Stargate now active, Anubis now controlling Jack attempts to walk through the Stargate but Carter gets to the control room and ends the self-destruct sequence. She doesn't, however, manage to stop the gate from dialing, and it activates. Just as O'Neill is about to step through the gate, Col Vaselov, who has escaped from the infirmary, stops him. He holds O'Neill/Anubis at gunpoint and tells the Goa'uld to take his body instead. Anubis accepts, and steps through the stargate in Vaselov's body. Afterwards, Carter reveals that Anubis did not actually escape, as she did manage to override the dialing process to send him to an alternate address. The planet she chose to send him to was extremely cold, so Vaselov's body froze, leaving Anubis unable to dial a new address. == Production == Aaron Pearl who portrayed Major Kearney in the episode, previously played the younger version of George Hammond in the season two episode \\"1969\\". \\"Lockdown\\" was the first shot episode for season eight, but became the third to air so that they could continue the cliffhanger after previous season episode, \\"Lost City\\". Writer Joseph Mallozzi wanted to have an episode centered around the Jack O'Neill new job in Stargate Command, to \\"Test him early\\" on \\"as the new [...] commander.\\" In the first script draft, Anubis was set to appear in a fiery planet at the end of the episode, but when the script was finished he ended up in a frozen planet. Mallozzi when commenting on the episode, said it was an \\"Image I'd been dying to use\\". When Samantha Carter told Jack O'Neill in the original draft where she had sent Anubis, O'Neill responded \\"Well, I hope he wore his warm socks.\\" The line was dropped since producers felt it was \\"too callous\\" for the character. One of the early scenes featuring Alexi Vaselov, where he awakens to find Teal'c in the observation room, was originally scripted to take place in the infirmary. Originally Teal'c was set to appear at Daniel Jackson's bedsite with Vaselov engaging in the conversation. == Reception == \\"Lockdown\\" received 2.0 in Nielsen household rating and 1.7 in syndication ratings becoming the only episode in season eight to receive a syndication rating. The episode debuted on the Sci Fi Channel in the United States on July 23, 2004, with Stargate Atlantis episode \\"Hide and Seek\\". It was the top-rated show on the Sci Fi Channel that week. \\"Lockdown\\" drew close to 2.7 million viewers in the United States, this was down four-tenths from the previous episode \\"New Order\\". While the viewership was higher than the previous season which averaged a 1.8 in Nielsen household ratings, \\"Lockdown\\" was surpassed by sister show Stargate Atlantis episode \\"Hide and Seek\\" in ratings and viewership. The episode was noted as the first Stargate SG-1 episode which was not the top-rated show on the Sci Fi Channel in the week in two years. == References == ==External links== * Lockdown at mgm.com * * Episode guide from Skyone.

It was written by producer Robert C. Cooper and directed by Peter Woeste. Clips of the episode were shown on Late Night with Conan O'Brien before Season 8 began, with Late Night graphic designer Pierre Bernard making a cameo appearance in the episode. The first airing of \\"Zero Hour\\" on July 30, 2004 on the American Sci Fi Channel was viewed by 3 million people. The episode received mixed reviews. \\"Zero Hour\\" takes place shortly after the promotion of main character Jack O'Neill from Colonel to Brigadier General. With O'Neill being the new leader of Stargate Command (SGC), Lt. Col. Samantha Carter has assumed O'Neill's old position as leader of the SG-1 unit. The idea to have the episode focus on General O'Neill solving various problems at his new job came from the writers' wondering what the general of the SGC does while his teams are on missions. == Plot == The episode takes place over the course of five days, counting down to an at first unrevealed event named \\"Zero Hour\\". Five days to Zero Hour, General O'Neill is introduced to his new administrative aide, Mark Gilmor, who makes a suspicious phone call. Meanwhile, O'Neill's new position as a general is twofold. He needs to decide decorations for an upcoming official visit, and prepare SG-1 for its next offworld trip. A quickly growing alien plant and the arrival of two brawly Amrans, possible trade partners from another world, lead O'Neill to write a letter to General Hammond, his predecessor. At four days to Zero Hour, the alien plant has grown to cover many areas of the base. After SG-1 go missing on their off-world mission, a Goa'uld named Ba'al contacts Stargate Command and suggests an exchange of the captured SG-1 against Camulus, another Goa'uld who requested asylum on Earth several episodes before. With the help of Camulus, a potent power source is found and brought back to Stargate Command, only to find it tainted by Camulus (powering it up could result in the destruction of the Solar system). With the SGC suffering from a temporary electricity failure caused by the alien plants, Ba'al's renewed contacting only results in O'Neill's mocking. Exhausted by sleep deprivation two days to Zero Hour, O'Neill finishes his letter to General Hammond to inform him of his resignation. Although Camulus leaves Earth, Ba'al does not send back SG-1. When all SG teams announce their trust and support for the general, SG-1 dial the Stargate from offworld, revealing that they were never captured by Ba'al but instead were trapped in a secret base. After their safe return, O'Neill attests new SG-1 leader Samantha Carter's positive leadership skills. It is revealed that the ZPM Camulus was given to supposedly kill Ba'al (which Ba'al would use to destroy Earth) was actually the dead one from Antarctica. Zero Hour makes up the last minutes of the episode. The President is about to arrive, and Gilmor announces that his special assignment, initiated by the President's order, will end the next day. Gilmor expresses his respect, and as they leave to greet the President, the camera zooms in on the resignation letter on O'Neill's desk, with the last words, \\"Never mind\\". == Production == Despite being fourth in the airing order, \\"Zero Hour\\" was filmed as the seventh out of the twenty episodes of Season 8. The limited availability of Richard Dean Anderson (Jack O'Neill), who only worked 3.5 days out of five working days a week during the eighth season, extended the seven-day filming period to four weeks. With \\"Zero Hour\\" being a bottle episode to save money, director Peter Woeste filmed the majority of the episode on the standing SGC sets at The Bridge Studios, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. The labs of Dr. Lee and Carter were filmed in the same room of the standing set, and a storage room for filming equipment was remodeled into the office of Gilmor. Second unit director Andy Mikita was responsible for the off-world scenes of the SG teams, filmed in Tynehead Park, one of the few undeveloped Vancouver locations that still allows filming. O'Neill in his sleeping quarters was the episode's last filmed scene, shot in two takes to allow Anderson to catch his flight home to Los Angeles. The inspiration for the episode came from the SG-1 writers wondering for years what George Hammond, the SGC leader from seasons one through seven, does while SG-1 is away on missions. Imagined scenarios ranged from the general dealing with minor decisions like bunting and lunch buffet, to averting major emergencies and threats. The episode's working title was \\"A Day in the Life of General O'Neill\\", but writer Robert C. Cooper felt \\"Zero Hour\\" was more appropriate, referring to the President's visit at the end of the episode. The subplot of the SGC being overrun with plant life originates in a Season 4 idea by writer and producer Brad Wright. To not interrupt the shooting process, the set was decorated with various plants and vines overnight. Some plants were plastic, but real plants were used for the torching scenes, sprayed to be flame retardant so as not to burn the whole set. Jim Menard as the director of photography was responsible for the green lighting when the emergency lighting goes off. He achieved depth by using differently-colored lights in the control room and near the gate. \\"Zero Hour\\" features several guest stars. Los Angeles actor David Kaufman was brought in to play the part of Mark Gilmor, a red herring to the story. Cliff Simon, flown in from L.A. for a day's work, filmed most of his scenes as Ba'al against green-screen in the gateroom for a \\"hologram feel\\". Bill Dow (Dr. Lee) was doing theater work in Vancouver during the filming of this episode, necessitating the producers to schedule around his availability. Gary Jones's character, an SG-1 semi-regular technician who sported the name \\"Norman Davis\\" on his uniform for years, received a new name in this episode: \\"Walter Harriman\\". After O'Neill had referred to him as \\"Walter\\" in the Season 4 episode \\"2010\\", the producers could not get clearance for a renaming into \\"Walter Davis\\". The new name is based on General Hammond referring to Jones's character as \\"Airman\\" (sounding like \\"Harriman\\") in the pilot episode, and SG-1 writer Joseph Mallozzi explained the resulting incongruity as a married- name issue. One scene in \\"Zero Hour\\" features Pierre Bernard, a graphic designer for the NBC show Late Night with Conan O'Brien, as technician O'Brien. The SG-1 producers saw Bernard ranting on Late Night about Stargate SG-1 being better without Daniel Jackson (actor Michael Shanks was not part of SG-1 during Season 6), and gave him a cameo spot. == Reception == Producer Robert C. Cooper was satisfied with \\"Zero Hour\\", claiming that Richard Dean Anderson \\"is fantastic in this episode. It's new-yet-classic O'Neill and fans of the character will be forever pleased with this.\\" When \\"Zero Hour\\" first aired on the Sci Fi Channel on July 30, 2004, it achieved a 2.2 Household rating, equaling approximately 3 million viewers. Tied with \\"Icon\\", this marked the sixth-highest rating for any Season 8 episode of Stargate SG-1. DVD Talk called \\"Zero Hour\\" \\"a playful episode\\" with a \\"funny sub-plot involving an alien plant\\", but recognized the episode's contribution to the overall story arc. TV Zone considered the plant threat \\"a nice change\\" but regretted that it was only a red herring for a later plot revelation. Bringing the plants to the SGC at all was regarded irritating, as the \\"obvious move [to build a secure lab on an uninhabited planet] doesn't make for such good drama.\\" O'Neill acting as the new leader made \\"the Goa'uld threat [...] a laugh\\" and \\"an amazing change from the events from the series' early days\\" where O'Neill took this race more seriously. The actual zero hour plot concerning the \\"harassed\\" O'Neill was considered \\"a nice touch\\". Conan O'Brien, who had shown a clip of Pierre Bernard's scene in his late night show before the first airing, congratulated Bernard for doing a good job, and Bernard would be invited back to the Stargate SG-1 set for a scene in the 200th episode of the show. == References == == External links == * * Zero Hour at scifi.com * Zero Hour at mgm.com * Category:Stargate SG-1 episodes Category:2004 American television episodes ","title":"Zero Hour (Stargate SG-1)"},{"id":"2548507","text":"Baranof Warm Springs is a small, primarily seasonally-occupied community located in the city and borough of Sitka, Alaska, on the eastern side of Baranof Island, from which it likely derives its name, in the Alexander Archipelago. It is occasionally referred to simply as Baranof. Baranof Warm Springs is located at . ==Geography== Baranof Warm Springs is located on Warm Springs Bay which is just off of Chatham Strait. Just about a half mile up from the settlement is Baranof Lake, a large glacially-fed freshwater lake. Baranof Lake is fed from small unnamed glacial run-off streams as well as the relatively large Baranof River. Between the half mile outlet between Baranof Lake and Warm Springs Bay there are a series of rapids and waterfalls that have proven to be lethal when run. Baranof Warm Springs is located on the southern part of a , exposure of a biotite-quartz diorite batholith that crosses northern Baranof Island. ==Community== Baranof Warm Springs Baranof Warm Springs is a very small community, having only caretakers in the winter and intermittent visitors in the summer. There are around 15 seasonal homes. The community lies inside the jurisdiction of the City and Borough of Sitka. Other than property taxes and any dock fees from the new dock (2016) there is only one tax-paying commercial enterprise, the Baranof Wilderness Lodge and Resort. The city, in return, funds maintenance of a boardwalk which serves as the main thoroughfare as well as the dock for transient vessels. The community of property owners (BPOA- Baranof Property Owners Association) pools money together to pay for a seasonal (winter) caretaker for seasonally-inhabited residences, the city-owned picnic shelter (possible shelter for those needing it), the public bath house (which features three separate tubs), and the communal warm springs pools. Another caretaker is hired to tend to the Baranof Lodge from October 1 to May 1 when the owners of the Lodge return. ==History== Baranof Warm Springs was used frequently by the Tlingit of Angoon. People of western descent did not find the springs until 1891. It was serviced by a post office from 1907 through 1912, under the name of Baranoff. ==Demographics== Baranof Warm Springs appeared on the U.S. Census twice as an unincorporated village. First in 1930https://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/00476569ch2.pdf as Baranof with 25 residents and as \\"Baronof\\" in 1940https://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/33973538v1ch11.pdf with 10 residents. It was later annexed into the City and Borough of Sitka. ==Transportation== Baranof Warm Springs is accessible via floatplane with regularly scheduled flights leaving Sitka. The trans-island flight is 30 minutes on a clear day and an hour on an overcast one. The Alaska Marine Highway does not service Baranof Warm Springs and there is no scheduled ferry/marine passenger services to the community. Baranof Warm Springs itself does not feature any roads, and the boardwalk does not accommodate ATVs. ==Attractions== The primary attraction is the warm springs. There are a total of nine separate hot springs with temperatures from lukewarm to 120 degrees F. Only one is developed in a natural state and is located right up against the white water of the Baranof River. The community built a public bathhouse at the waterfront to provide an option for visitors not wanting to bathe communally and/or make the 1/4 mile hike up the trail to the natural springs. Small tour boats come in frequently in the summer, but also fishermen, and employees of the Hidden Falls Hatchery visit as well. The warm springs is also the terminus (or occasionally the trailhead) of the Baranof Cross-Island Trail. On the northern end of Baranof Lake there is also a Forest Service cabin that is quite popular. The cabin can only be reached by boat or float plane. The terrain is too steep to hike. Baranof Warm Springs is home to the Coastal Research and Education Center, a research base and educational facility operated seasonally by the Alaska Whale Foundation. ==See also== *Baranof Cross-Island Trail *Baranof Warm Springs (thermal mineral springs) ==References== Category:Geography of Sitka, Alaska Category:Hot springs of Alaska Category:Bodies of water of Sitka, Alaska ","title":"Baranof Warm Springs, Alaska"},{"id":"2548512","text":"Hot Tamales Small Box Hot Tamales is a chewy, cinnamon flavored, oblong-shaped candy introduced in 1950.

It was originally part of Teletext's \\"Fun & Games\\" category, though the rest of the category had been discontinued for some years before Bamboozle! ended (due to the general discontinuation of all Teletext news and editorial content in December 2009). The last edition, themed around 'Ends and Lasts', appeared on Monday 14 December 2009. The Boozler 'family' appeared one last time on Tuesday 15 December 2009 saying farewell to the Teletext audience. On 9 August 2010 Bamboozle! was given a new home by Teletext on the iPhone complete with all the retro graphics (no longer available). On 11 July 2019, Teletext Holidays launched a version of the Bamboozle quiz on their 404 error page. Bamboozle! was originally intended as a real-time game that could be played in conjunction with a broadcast TV programme using a similar multiple choice format as Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?. The decision by the new broadcast teletext franchise holders (Teletext UK) in 1993 to opt for X.25 packet switching meant that it was impossible to adequately synchronise the broadcast of teletext content in the context of a TV programme. The format thus fell back to the form it had operated in largely unchanged since 1994. ==The game== The game used Fastext keys (different coloured buttons on the TV remote control) to select the desired answer from a choice of four, and was \\"presented\\" by virtual host Bamber Boozler, who derived his name from the word \\"bamboozle\\" and the name of University Challenge host, Bamber Gascoigne. Bamber Boozler's appearance was constrained by the limitations of the Level 1 World System Teletext alpha mosaic display format. From 1993–2005, Teletext competitions editor Julian Edwards created the quiz \\"Bamber Boozler\\" and the character \\"Bamber Boozler\\". In later years, journalists Charlie Ghagan and, latterly, Roger Wilkinson oversaw the quiz. Roger Wilkinson also provides content for the Teletext iPhone app. A new set of questions was originally given each week, but this soon became more regular, eventually becoming daily. Each game originally had 25 questions, later reduced to 20, then 15 and eventually 12. The player was required to answer all questions correctly in order to complete the quiz, but was allowed multiple attempts to do so. Initially, if a question was answered incorrectly, the player would have to start again from Question 1, However this was later amended so that a maximum of three questions would need to be answered again. After completing the quiz, there was a score table with themed responses, for example: {  12  Super star -  10-11  Martian master -  8-9  Clever comet -  6-7  Middling meteor -  3-5  Plodding Pluto -  0-2  Total eclipse } according to how many questions were answered correctly at the first attempt. ==Themes== On particular dates the quiz was themed: for example Halloween featured related questions and images of skeletons and spiders, whilst Guy Fawkes Night featured firework-based questions, and there were numerous Christmas-themed versions. There were also special \\"name the picture/person\\" graphical editions. Other Boozler family members were introduced over the game's first few years – Bamber's wife, Bambette, who normally appeared when a question was answered incorrectly; while Saturday's quizzes were generally easier than the weekday editions and were presented by Bamber's son, Buster, with Bambette's role filled by Bonnie, his daughter. At one point in the quiz's history the red, yellow and green keys were sensible answers and the blue was mostly reserved for a comical response (which was occasionally the correct one). This was later changed and all the keys would have sensible answers. The quiz started off at 20 questions, then it went down to 15 and then 12. On very few special occasions it was 30, however one question wrong and contestants had to start from the very beginning. The \\"Bad Luck\\" pages appeared when questions were answered incorrectly; they used to feature little trivial messages at first and then mainly birthday announcements. This was scrapped to introduce \\"Bambette's Bonus\\" (or Bonnie's Bonus in Junior Bamboozle) where contestants could score again with a question from her. This was not a multiple-choice question and contestants could get the answer by pressing the reveal button. ==Weekly competition== The makers of Bamboozle! introduced a weekly competition whereby a viewer could contribute the questions to Bamboozle! As well as having their questions used, names mentioned and their image appear on screen (the viewer could supply a photograph, which was converted to a Teletext-style cartoon); the winning contributors also received a £20 WHSmith gift voucher. Even before this, viewer-submitted questions were readily used in various forms ever since the early days of the quiz. ==Spin offs== Back in the early days of Bamboozle!, on a number of occasions the quiz would be put on hold and in its place was an adventure game (a different one each time), based on the popular children's fantasy programme \\"Knightmare\\". Viewers had to use the fastext keys to navigate their way through the quest. \\"Ten to One\\", was a sports version of Bamboozle! with the host Brian Boozler. The quiz was so called because it presented ten sports questions and players had to get from the ten down to one. It is a double meaning as Ten to One also relates to bookies popular odds on betting in many sports. This quiz ran concurrently with Bamboozle! for sometime until late 1998 where Brian said \\"I'm putting down the mic for a bit, I'm back in 1999...\\", however it never returned. He was however, during the period that the quiz was \\"rested\\", a guest quizmaster on Bamboozle! asking the contestants sports questions like before, with Bamber saying at the end \\"Thanks Brian..... check your score below!\\". Junior Bamboozle! was a version run on Saturdays for children. It was hosted by Buster Boozler and the bad luck pages were hosted by Bonnie Boozler. ==Trivia== * Bamber occasionally made reference to the different people that have written the quiz over the years, referring to \\"the different people that have played me\\". * Bamber proved to be so popular with Bamboozle! that he was also used for a brief period to host a few of the other games on the \\"Fun and Games\\" menu before they were all discontinued. * Bamboozle was mentioned in Peter Kay's stand up act (at the Comedy Store), when he quipped that you know your relationship is failing when you're playing Bamboozle together in bed. ==Further reading== * Television and the Second Screen: Interactive TV in the Age of Social Participation by James Blake, Taylor & Francis (2016) * \\"The life and death of teletext, and what happened next\\" by Chris Allcock, Den of Geek (June 28, 2018) * \\"Ceefax and Teletext: From Bamboozle to Mega-Zine, 12 reasons they were way better than the internet\\" by Catriona Wightman, Digital Spy (March 24, 2016) * The Post-broadcasting Age: New Technologies, New Communities : Papers from the 25th and 26th University of Manchester Broadcasting Symposia, University of Manchester (1995) * Computer Games and Digital Cultures: Conference Proceedings, Tampere University Press (2002) ==See also== * Digitiser * Park Avenue * List of teletext services ==References== ==External links== * Category:Teletext Category:1993 in British television Category:Television articles with incorrect naming style ","title":"Bamboozle!"},{"id":"2548547","text":"Maryland Route 175 is a state highway in the U.S. state of Maryland. The highway runs from Little Patuxent Parkway in Columbia east to MD 3 in Millersville. MD 175 is a major highway through the large unincorporated community of Columbia; the highway connects U.S. Route 29 (US 29) next to Columbia Town Center with Interstate 95 (I-95) and an industrial area on the eastern side of Howard County. MD 175 also connects Fort Meade with Jessup and Odenton in western Anne Arundel County, where it links MD 295 and MD 32 with the eastern part of the U.S. Army base. MD 175 was constructed from Ellicott City to Millersville in the late 1920s and early 1930s as part of three routes: MD 531 from MD 103 near Ellicott City to US 1 near Jessup, MD 175 from there to Fort Meade and north to Hanover, and MD 180 from Odenton to Millersville. The highway did not originally extend through Fort Meade; MD 175 was constructed through the military installation in the early 1940s as part of major upgrades to the highway from Jessup to Odenton due to its strategic importance. By 1946, MD 175 extended from Ellicott City to Millersville. The highway was widened from Odenton to Millersville in the late 1940s and from Ellicott City to Odenton in the mid-1950s. MD 175 was relocated at I-95 around 1970 and as a major highway through the newly constructed community of Columbia in the mid-1970s. The old portion of the highway from Ellicott City to the new highway became MD 108 and MD 104. There are plans to expand MD 175 to a multi-lane divided highway through Fort Meade due to increased activity at the Army post. ==Route description== View east along MD 175 at MD 713 near Fort Meade MD 175 begins just west of its bridges over the Little Patuxent River. The highway continues southwest as Little Patuxent Parkway, the county- maintained six-lane divided highway that forms the main street of Columbia Town Center. MD 175 heads east as Rouse Parkway, a four-lane divided controlled access highway; the highway was renamed from Little Patuxent Parkway to honor Columbia founder James Rouse and his wife Patty in 2006. The highway immediately has a cloverleaf interchange with US 29 (Columbia Pike). MD 175 heads southeast through intersections with Thunder Hill Road, Tamar Drive, and Dobbin Road as it passes between the Columbia villages of Oakland Mills to the southwest and Long Reach to the northeast. The state highway expands to six lanes at Dobbin Road and has a partial cloverleaf interchange with Snowden River Parkway that provides access to a park and ride lot serving MTA Maryland commuter buses and a trumpet interchange with Columbia Gateway Drive. Access from eastbound MD 175 to Columbia Gateway Drive requires using the Snowden River Parkway interchange. MD 175 widens to eight lanes at Columbia Gateway Drive, a width the highway carries through its intersection with the eastern end of MD 108 (Waterloo Road) to the highway's partial cloverleaf interchange with I-95. The highway's name changes from Rouse Parkway to Waterloo Road at the MD 108 junction. MD 175 has six lanes from I-95 to east of its junction with US 1 (Washington Boulevard), which was the site of a tavern called Waterloo and before that Spurrier's Tavern. MD 175 narrows to a two-lane undivided road as it passes between the Maryland Wholesale Produce Distribution Center to the southwest and the Patuxent Institution on the northeast and enters Jessup. East of Dorsey Run Road, which leads to the Jessup Auto Distribution Center, the state highway crosses over CSX's Capital Subdivision and enters Anne Arundel County, where the highway's name changes to Jessup Road. East of the tracks, MD 175 meets the eastern end of unsigned MD 723 (Old Jessup Road), which accesses the Jessup station on MARC's Camden Line, which uses the Capital Subdivision tracks. The highway continues east past the former Maryland House of Correction and has a cloverleaf interchange with MD 295 (Baltimore-Washington Parkway), where the highway's name becomes Annapolis Road. MD 175 temporarily expands to four lanes at its intersection with MD 713, which heads south as Rockenbach Road into Fort Meade and north as Ridge Road toward Hanover. The highway passes through the eastern part of Fort Meade and expands to a four-lane road with a center left-turn lane at Reece Road, which becomes MD 174 on the eastern boundary of the military installation. At the southeastern corner of the fort, MD 175 has a partial cloverleaf interchange with MD 32 (Patuxent Freeway) and enters Odenton. The highway crosses over Amtrak's Northeast Corridor and meets the southern end of MD 170 (Telegraph Road); the south leg of the intersection, Piney Orchard Parkway, leads to the Odenton station on MARC's Penn Line, which uses the Amtrak tracks. MD 175 continues as a four-lane undivided highway to a five-legged roundabout at the eastern end of Odenton where the highway meets Odenton Road, Higgins Drive, and Sappington Station Road, which is unsigned MD 32AA. The highway continues as a two-lane undivided road past Arundel High School and through the village of Gambrills before reaching its eastern terminus at MD 3 (Robert Crain Highway) west of Millersville. MD 175 has separate intersections with southbound and northbound MD 3; Millersville Road continues east from the northbound intersection through the eponymous village and past the historic Childs Residence. MD 175 is a part of the National Highway System as an intermodal freight transport connector from I-95 to Dorsey Run Road in Jessup and as a principal arterial from US 29 to I-95 through Columbia. ==History== The first section of MD 175 was constructed between 1924 and 1926 as a macadam road from US 1 southeast to the entrance of the Maryland House of Correction east of the B&O; Railroad (now CSX) in Jessup. MD 175 was extended as a concrete road east to its modern intersection with MD 713, then northeast along what later became MD 713 to MD 176 in Hanover in 1929. The easternmost portion of MD 175, which was originally MD 180, was constructed as a concrete road starting in 1930 from MD 3 to the Pennsylvania Railroad (now Amtrak) in Odenton; the highway was complete west to Gambrills by the end of 1930. The original western part of MD 175, from US 1 in Jessup to MD 103 in Ellicott City, was constructed as MD 531 in 1932. The portion of the highway through Fort Meade was a public highway maintained by Anne Arundel County or the federal government through World War II. MD 175 eastbound approaching I-95 in Columbia MD 180's crossing of the Pennsylvania Railroad was constructed in 1938. The highway was relocated through Odenton using the new bridge in 1938 and 1939; the old road became MD 677. MD 175's bridge over the B&O; Railroad in Jessup was completed in 1942. The highway was widened to a wide road with a concrete base and asphalt surface from Jessup to the MD 713 intersection in 1942. MD 175 was also extended as a road through Fort Meade from MD 713 to west of Odenton between 1942 and 1944. By 1946, MD 175 had been extended east over MD 180 to Millersville and west over MD 531 to Ellicott City; the portion of MD 175 from Fort Meade to MD 176 became MD 713. MD 175 was widened from from Odenton to Millersville starting in 1948. The highway was widened and resurfaced from Odenton to the newly constructed Baltimore-Washington Expressway interchange in 1954. MD 175 was also widened with curve amelioration from US 1 to MD 103 between 1954 and 1956. MD 175's first divided highway section was created when the highway was relocated from US 1 to just north of the modern MD 108 intersection in conjunction with the construction of the I-95 interchange in 1969 and 1970. The state highway's interchange with US 29 in Columbia was built in several stages. The westbound and eastbound bridges across the Little Patuxent River were built in 1970 and 1974, respectively. The first parts of the interchange to open were the ramps between county-maintained Little Patuxent Parkway and southbound US 29. MD 175's bridges over US 29 were built in 1974. The interchange fully opened when the new Little Patuxent Parkway was completed from the existing highway at the present MD 108 interchange west to US 29 in 1977. The portion of MD 175 north of the new highway was replaced by an eastward extension of MD 108 and MD 104. The highway's trumpet interchange with Columbia Gateway Drive opened with Little Patuxent Parkway. MD 175 was two lanes from US 29 to Columbia Gateway Drive until the road was expanded to a divided highway in 1987. The highway's interchange with Snowden River Parkway was constructed in 2001. MD 175's roundabout in Odenton was installed in 2004. The Maryland State Highway Administration plans to upgrade MD 175 from MD 295 in Jessup east to MD 170 in Odenton in response to the greatly increased traffic destined for Fort Meade due to the Base Realignment and Closure process. The state plans to expand MD 175 to a six-lane divided highway along the stretch, construct intersection improvements at MD 713, Reece Road, Mapes Road, and Charter Oaks Boulevard, and reconstruct the MD 295 interchange. One of the first projects to begin construction is improvements at the MD 713 intersection, which started in 2011 and are expected to be completed in 2013. ==Junction list== ==Auxiliary routes== *MD 175AA is the designation for the section of Max Blob Park Road from the intersection of MD 175 and Clark Road south to the portion of Max Blob Park Road designated MD 917 just east of the MD 175-MD 295 interchange in Jessup. *MD 175HC is the designation for the eastbound collector/distributor roadway from Snowden River Parkway east to MD 175's bridge over Columbia Gateway Drive, where MD 175HC merges with eastbound MD 175, in Columbia. The highway allows eastbound MD 175 and Snowden River Parkway traffic to access Columbia Gateway Drive. Prior to the completion of the interchange between MD 175 and Snowden River Parkway, MD 175HC began just east of the intersection of the two roads. ==See also== * ==References== ==External links== *MDRoads: MD 175 175 Category:Roads in Howard County, Maryland Category:Roads in Anne Arundel County, Maryland ","title":"Maryland Route 175"},{"id":"2548550","text":"Sutton Park is one of the constituent residential areas which make up the suburb of Bayside Irish: Cois Bá on the coastline of Dublin Bay, Ireland.

Additions include partial support for UCS-2 (but not Unicode) strings, implicit handles, and complex calculations in the variable-length string and structure paradigms already present in DCE/RPC. == Example == The DCE 1.0 reference implementation only allows such constructs as \\"size_is(len)\\", or possibly \\"size_is(len-1)\\". MSRPC allows much more complex constructs such as \\"size_is(len / 2 - 1)\\" and even \\"length_is ((max & ~0x7) + 0x7)\\", a common expression in DCOM IDL files. == Use == MSRPC was used by Microsoft to seamlessly create a client/server model in Windows NT, with very little effort. For example, the Windows Server domains protocols are entirely MSRPC based, as is Microsoft's DNS administrative tool. Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5's administrative front-ends are all MSRPC client/server applications, and its MAPI was made more secure by \\"proxying\\" MAPI over a set of simple MSRPC functions that enable encryption at the MSRPC layer without involving the MAPI protocol. ==History== MSRPC is derived from the Distributed Computing Environment 1.2 reference implementation from the Open Software Foundation, but has been copyrighted by Microsoft. DCE/RPC was originally commissioned by the Open Software Foundation, an industry consortium to set vendor- and technology-neutral open standards for computing infrastructure. None of the Unix vendors (now represented by the Open Group), wanted to use the complex DCE or such components as DCE/RPC at the time. Microsoft's Component Object Model is based heavily on MSRPC, adding interfaces and inheritance. The marshalling semantics of DCE/RPC are used to serialize method calls and results between processes with separate address spaces, albeit COM did not initially allow network calls between different machines. With Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM), COM was extended to software components distributed across several networked computers. DCOM, which originally was called \\"Network OLE\\", extends Microsoft's COM, and provides the communication substrate under Microsoft's COM+ application server infrastructure. Microsoft donated DCOM to the Open Group. == References == * * ==External links== *MSRPC at TechNet *, a chapter on MSRPC from a technical article by Jean-Baptiste Marchand.

It is in the diocesan chancery that, under the direction of the bishop or his representative (the local ordinary), all documents which concern the diocese are drawn up, copied, forwarded, and a record kept of all official writings expedited or received. The official charged with the execution of these duties is known as the diocesan chancellor. ==Anglican dioceses== Diocesan chanceries may be universal, but there is nothing in the common ecclesiastical law concerning their creation and equipment. The explanation lies in the very nature of this law, which provides only for what is general and common, and takes no account of local means of administration, which it abandons to the proper authority in each diocese, the concrete circumstances offering always great variety and calling for all possible freedom of action. Although, as above described, the methods of diocesan administration exhibit no little variety, there exists on the other hand a certain uniformity. Each diocese, after all, is bound to observe the common law, has an identical range of freedom, and identical limits to its authority. Each diocese, therefore, is likely, a priori, to develop its administration along similar lines, but does so regularly in harmony with others, particularly neighbouring dioceses. In this way the dioceses of a given country come to have similar official administration. ==Roman Catholic dioceses== In many dioceses, the chancellor exercises some of the faculties which in other dioceses are exclusively reserved to the vicar-general. This happens more frequently in smaller dioceses, administered directly by the bishop himself, and in which the vicar- general (often not resident in the episcopal city) is called on only when the bishop is absent or hindered. In such cases the chancellor is also the confidential secretary of the bishop. A similar system obtains even in many extensive dioceses which are administered by the bishop with the aid of one or more vicars-general and the diocesan chancery. There are, however, some large dioceses in which all matters personally reserved to the bishop are executed by him with the aid of a secretary or chancellor, usually a priest or deacon, while the greater part of the diocesan administration is handed over to a body of officials under the direction of the bishop or his vicar-general. For the correspondence, registration, and care of the archives, such administrative bureaus are provided with a secretariat or chancery. The chancery is a necessary element of administration in every diocese. Some provision for its duties must be made, even in missionary dioceses, apostolic prefectures, and apostolic vicariates. Unless the official correspondence were properly cared for, there would be no tradition in diocesan management, important documents would be lost, and the written evidence necessary in lawsuits and trials would be lacking. The famous Apostolic Chancery (Cancellaria Apostolica) developed in time from the chancery of the primitive Bishop of Rome. By reason of the latter's primacy in the Church, his chancery naturally had far wider relations than that of any other Christian diocese. The Apostolic See had never legislated concerning diocesan chanceries until the 1983 Code of Canon Law under its canons on the diocesan curia (cc. 469-494). The diocesan system was generally introduced in many countries whose churches had hitherto been under a more or less provisional government (e.g. United States, England, Scotland, India). Archdiocesan Chancery in San Fernando, Pampanga, Philippines National and provincial synods laid much stress on the creation of diocesan chanceries. In the United States, the First Plenary Council of Baltimore (1852) expressed the wish that in every diocese there should be a chancery, to facilitate ecclesiastical administration and establish for its conduct a more or less identical system. In Ireland, the National Synod of Thurles (1850) made provision for the establishment and preservation of diocesan archives. Similarly for England the Provincial Synod of Westminster (1852). In keeping with these recommendations, the diocesan chancery consists of a certain number of officials named by the bishop. In the United States, England, and Australia, there are usually, besides the vicar-general, a diocesan chancellor and a secretary. In European dioceses the chancery is organized variously, according to the extent of the diocese. There is generally in each diocese a chancellor or secretary with the necessary personnel. In the dioceses of Germany much of the administration is carried on by an official bureau (Ordinariat) as described above, i.e., the vicariate-general, to which are adjoined a secretariat, a registry office, and a chancery. In the Diocese of Breslau there existed an institution known as the \\"Secret Chancery\\" (Geheimkanzlei), which expedited only matters decided by the prince-bishop personally or with the advice of this body. The prince-bishop presided over its sessions with the help of the vicar-general. Its members were three priests and one lay counsellor to whom were added a secretary, a chief of the chancery, two private secretaries, a registrar, etc. The ordinary diocesan administration were carried on by two other bureaus, the vicariate-general and the diocesan consistory, mutually independent, but both acting in the name of the prince-bishop. For the office of diocesan chancellor in the United States, see \\"Acta et Decreta\\" of the Third Plenary Council of Baltimore, in index, p. 303, and of the Synod of Maynooth (1900), s. v. \\"Archiva\\". ==See also== * Chancellor (ecclesiastical) * Moderator of the Curia ==References== Category:Types of Roman Catholic organization Category:Episcopacy in the Catholic Church Category:Catholic ecclesiastical titles Category:Episcopacy in Anglicanism Category:Christian terminology ","title":"Diocesan chancery"},{"id":"2548562","text":"alpha Kappa Delta Phi (αΚΔΦ), also known as aKDPhi, Kappa Delta Phi, KDPhi, is an Asian sorority founded at the University of California, Berkeley.aKDPhi General Information alpha Kappa Delta Phi is part of the National APIDA Panhellenic Association (NAPA), which it helped charter in 2006. alpha Kappa Delta Phi currently has 60 chapters in North America, and is the only Asian- American interest sorority in the United States and Canada. ==History== alpha Kappa Delta Phi was established at the University of California in the Fall of 1989 and recognized by the College Panhellenic Association on February 7, 1990. There were fourteen founding sisters: Betty Chu, Karin Co, Susan Kim, Nancy Lee, Sherri Leung, Annie Loo, Belinda Ma, Anita Ng, Serene Ngin, Fannie Pon, Josie Sun, Daisy Wu, Jill Yoshimura and Reina Yuan, and they dedicated themselves \\"to establishing a sorority which would offer Asian American women the opportunity to participate in the Greek system while also establishing an organization which would last as a strong tradition. \\". During the fall of 2002, the National Alumnae Board was established under the guidance of the National Board Alumnae Chair, Sophia Yen, to oversee the expansion and growth of the sorority’s alumnae. The 2002-2003 National Alumnae Board strongly desired a working organization that would provide programs and services to all alumnae. This idea later blossomed into the formation of the National Alumnae Association. With a true grassroots beginning, the National Alumnae Board’s initial activity focused on creating a mentoring program that would drive rich learning and development for both mentees and mentors. The success of the mentorship initiative led to the addition of a scholarship program that would award financial aid to sisters looking to further their education. Over the years, the National Alumnae Board has proudly sponsored many programs to edify our alumnae in helping them pursue their dreams, passions, and legacies. To date, the National Alumnae Association is still holding fast to its purpose: to continue the sisterhood after graduation. As such, it remains the leading avenue for our alumnae to connect with one another and express their timeless affection and everlasting devotion to alpha Kappa Delta Phi. ==Asian Awareness== alpha Kappa Delta Phi promotes Asian Awareness, one of its founding principles, by encouraging its members to be constantly aware of and involved in Asian American issues in their communities.

Originally in Fresno County, until 1909 when Fresno County lands in the vicinity, south of Kings river were transferred to Kings County, California. It was located on the south bank of the Kings River northwest of Hanford at Whitmore's Ferry. L. A. Whitmore established the ferry in 1854. It was founded in 1856 by Lucious A. Whitmore who operated the first ferry to cross the Kings River. The town of Kingston grew up around the ferry at the place where an old Spanish road called El Camino Viejo á Los Angeles (The Old Road to Los Angeles) crossed the river. Kingston became a stopping place on the Butterfield Overland Mail route from 1858 to 1861 and a stage route between Stockton and Visalia after 1858. A post office operated at Kingston from 1859 to 1862, and from 1866 to 1890, when the service transferred to Lillis.Durham, California's Geographic Names, p.1060 Until at least 1872, the only store between Millerton and Visalia was in Kingston. The first school in the area was probably the one established as early as 1860 in Kingston.Gibson, Harold, History of Kings County Public Schools, Hanford, CA, 2004 Oliver H. Bliss operated the Kingston ferry after Whitmore, beginning in 1859. Bliss built a temporary toll bridge with two boats and planking in 1872. In 1873, John Sutherland purchased Bliss's interest in both the ferry and the bridge and built a permanent bridge that year. On December 26, 1873, Tiburcio Vásquez and his bandit gang made a bold raid, robbing the entire village. Reportedly 35 or more men were tied up and over $2,000 in loot was hauled away. Subsequently, the town declined and by the 1890s Kingston was abandoned. Oliver Bliss' livery stable was the last remaining building and stood until 1930.

Plants could produce a breathable atmosphere within hollow spaces in the comet (or even within the plants themselves), utilising solar energy for photosynthesis and cometary materials for nutrients, thus providing self-sustaining habitats for humanity in the outer solar system analogous to a greenhouse in space or a shell grown by a mollusc. A Dyson tree might consist of a few main trunk structures growing out from a comet nucleus, branching into limbs and foliage that intertwine, forming a spherical structure possibly dozens of kilometers across. ==Dyson trees in science fiction== Dyson trees are mentioned a number of times in science fiction, beginning in the 1980s: *One of the first adoptions of the trope is Rachel Pollack's Tree House (1984). *The concept is discussed in Carl Sagan and Ann Druyan's 1985 non-fiction book Comet, and several paintings of Dyson trees around Saturn and in interstellar space are provided in the book by Jon Lomberg. * In Michael Swanwick's 1987 transhumanist novel Vacuum Flowers, \\"dysonsworlders\\" have established tree settlements in the Oort Cloud. * Under the name of \\"Space Poplars\\", Dyson trees are described in Donald Moffitt's two science fiction novels, The Genesis Quest and Second Genesis.

At least this is the definition that would apply to the auto of the time of Calderón. It does not so well fit, however, those of the preceding century, many of which were sacramental in character only because they were presented during the feast of Corpus Christi. They are usually allegorical, the characters representing, for example, Faith, Hope, Air, Sin, Death, etc. There were some indeed, in which not a single human character appeared, but personifications of the Virtues, the Vices, the Elements, etc. The auto sacramental was always presented in the streets in connection with the celebration of the feast of Corpus Christi. It was preceded by a solemn procession through the principal streets of the city, the houses along the route being decorated in honor of the occasion. In the procession appeared the priests bearing the Host under a splendid canopy, followed by a devout throng, in which, in Madrid, often appeared the king and his court without distinction of rank, and last of all, in beautiful cars, came the actors from the public theatres who were to take part in the performance. The procession usually halted before the house of some dignitary while the priests performed certain religious ceremonies, the multitude kneeling meanwhile as if in church. At the conclusion of these, the auto was given. These performances, and the procession as well, were given with much splendor and at great expense, being limited only by the resources of the particular town in which they took place. === Early religious drama === Religious exhibitions were popular with the public in Spain as early as the 13th century. These typically consisted of simple dialogue, presented at Christmas, Carnival, Good Friday, or Easter during religious festivals. As time progressed, the celebration of the feast day of Corpus Christi became larger and with that came the desire for drama surrounding the feast day and honoring the Eucharist became apparent.Oberlander, Barbara Joyce, \\"The 'Autos Sacramentales' of Jose Valdivielso: Their Dramatic Theory.\\" (1969). LSU Historical Dissertations and Theses. 1609. http://digitalcommons.lsu.edu/gradschool_disstheses/1609 The first autos were derived from religious material that already existed, but by the beginning of the 16th century, the first true auto sacramental, meaning the theme of the play was the mystery of the Eucharist, was presented. It was El Auto de San Martin, by Gil Vicente. === Height of popularity === During the 16th and 17th centuries these autos continued to appear, being gradually improved and elaborated until brought to their highest state of development by Calderón. He has left about seventy autos, the best known of which are The Divine Orpheus, a work of considerable poetic merit, The Devotion to the Mass, and The Captivity of the Ark. His autos were the most popular and were the only autos performed in Madrid from 1647 to 1681. These autos sacramentales produced a great effect on the people. From time immemorial, allegory of every kind had powerfully appealed to them, and these autos took a strong hold on the popular favor, coming as they did during religious festivals, with their music and their splendor, coupled with the fact that they were given at public expense and with the sanction of the Catholic church. === Prohibited === Citing disrespect of the Eucharist, Charles III declared the presentation and performance of autos prohibited by royal decree in 1765. == Playwrights == Gil Vicente (c.1465 – 1536/1537): wrote in Portuguese and Spanish; considered joint-father of Spanish Drama with Juan de la Encina; wrote very early autos Juan de la Encina (1468 – 1529): considered joint-father of Spanish Drama with Gil Vicente; in 1496 published book called Cancionero of eight églogas, the precursor for the auto sacramental. ' (c.1520 – 1583): wrote six autos, including La Oveja Perdida; author of the only autos written in Catalan. Lope de Vega (1562 –1635): wrote around 400 autos; 42 surviving text including “The Harvest” and “The Wolf Turned Shepherd”Morley, Griswold; Bruerton, C. (1968). Cronologia de las Comedias de Lope de Vega. Madrid. ' (1565 – 1638): author of the book Doce autos sacramentales y dos comedias divinas, published in 1622; precursor of Calderón de la Barca in the use of allegory. Pedro Calderón de la Barca (1600 – 1681): considered most prolific of the writers of autos; two well-known autos are La cena del rey Baltaza, or Belshazzar's Feast and El gran teatro del Mundo, or The Great Theater of the World == Calderón's Belshazzar's Feast == Photo from the Auto Sacramental de la Resusrrección, known to the locals in Hinojos where it is performed, as \\"Los Abrazos,\\" or, The Hugs.One of Calderón's autos that is a popular English translation is Belshazzar's Feast. It relates directly to the Eucharist, sacrilegious behavior, and punishment exacted on Belshazzar for his sinful behavior.Barca, Pedro Calderón de la, and Denis Florence MacCarthy. “Mysteries of Corpus Christi: from the Spanish.” Mysteries of Corpus Christi: from the Spanish, James Duffy, 1867, pp. 68–210. https://archive.org/details/mysteriescorpus00lorigoog. Accessed 20 November 2017. === Characters === Belshazzar – based on the biblical character, but allegorical for humanity Daniel – Biblical historic character, allegoric personification of Wisdom and God's Judgement Idolatry – second wife of Belshazzar Vanity – first wife of Belshazzar Death – allegoric personification of death; carries out judgement; key player/most important Thought – sometimes Belshazzar's inner thoughts, sometimes general Human Thought === Action of Belshazzar's Feast === The Thought and Daniel meet in Belshazzar's palace gardens. The Thought informs Daniel that Belshazzar has married Idolatry, even though he is already married to Vanity. Daniel cries woe for God's people. Belshazzar enters with Vanity and his new bride, Idolatry. He wants them to embrace each other. They do so and ask him what is on his mind. He relates the story of the Great Flood and also the Tower of Babel. After he tells his stories, his two wives decree that he is their king and god. Belshazzar asks what can break their bond, and Daniel informs him that “The Hand of God,” can break up Belshazzar, Vanity, and Idolatry. Belshazzar gets upset with Daniel and threatens his life. Daniel says that God will save him. Vanity and Idolatry tell Belshazzar that Daniel is annoying them and they want to leave. As they leave, Belshazzar tells Daniel he owes his life to the two queens, not to God. The Thought tells Daniel that he has learned a valuable lesson – by invoking the hand of God, his life can be spared in future situations. Death and Daniel enter and discuss Belshazzar and his sins of vanity and idolatry. Death offers to kill Belshazzar for Daniel, as an agent of an angry God. Daniel gives Death permission to visit Belshazzar and scare him, but not kill him. Daniel wants to save his soul. Death is upset about only being allowed to show himself to and warn Belshazzar and not take his soul. He calls for Thought. Thought joins Death and is scared of him. Death asks Thought where Belshazzar is. Thought tells Death that Belshazzar is with his two wives in the garden. Death asks Thought to take him there. Thought does because he doesn't have the courage to say no. Belshazzar, Idolatry, and Vanity enter. The ask Belshazzar why he looks so sad and stops talking so suddenly. Belshazzar says he doesn't know the source of the intense pain he feels. It is Death approaching that none of the trio can see. Death shows himself to Belshazzar who is shocked and terrified. He asks Death who he is; Death tells Belshazzar that he is a creditor here to collect a debt that Belshazzar owes. Thought rethinks his decision to lead Death to Belshazzar. Belshazzar asks what he owes. Death shows him a book that has the debt listed, but Belshazzar states that the book is one he lost. Death says the debt was written down by Belshazzar himself. He reads back what Belshazzar wrote about owing his life to Death. Death tells Belshazzar that today is not the day that he has come to collect the debt, but that the day is coming. Death exits. Belshazzar, Idolatry, Vanity, and Thought are still together. The two queens want to know what is troubling Belshazzar. He says he is not sure – some phantom visited him. To please Belshazzar, the queens take turns complimenting each other. They all sit down and Idolatry fans Belshazzar with the feather from her hat while Vanity sings to him about his greatness to continue to soothe him. Death is angry because the queens have soothed Belshazzar into a sleep. Death says he will haunt Belshazzar in his dream. The queens leave the garden and Thought also falls asleep. Death sees Belshazzar asleep and decides to kill him. He draws his sword, but Daniel enters and says, “No,” while holding back the arms of Death. Death inquires why he cannot kill the king. Daniel says Belshazzar has not lived his whole life and it is not time yet for him to die. Death argues that Belshazzar's life is a mockery to both God and Death. While Belshazzar is asleep, in his dream the queens enter with a Statue – it is Belshazzar as a god. The queens praise Belshazzar and build him up. The Statue warns Belshazzar in his sleep that he needs to leave Idolatry and Vanity behind or else he will suffer because of them. The Statue tells the dream queens that the great God decrees them gone. Belshazzar wakes up and is troubled by what he saw and felt in his sleep. He starts to question keeping so much stock in Idolatry and Vanity. However, Idolatry seduces him again and he returns to his former self. Thought suggests Belshazzar throw a feast to shake off all of the melancholy. Belshazzar calls for the gold wine glasses and wine reserved for presenting the Eucharist to be used, because he deserves the best. Idolatry and Vanity set the table for the feast while Thought sings. Death comes to the feast in a disguise and makes a plea to God to loose his hand in order to kill Belshazzar due to his sacrilegious behavior against the Eucharist on top of his sins of Idolatry and Vanity. Belshazzar demands wine, and Death, being mistaken for a servant, brings him a golden cup of poisoned wine declaring that in the cup is both Life and Death. Belshazzar toasts himself, drinks the wine, and then there are several increasingly loud thunder claps. A hand appears in the clouds and writes nonsense words that neither Idolatry, Vanity, Belshazzar, nor Thought can decipher. Idolatry says Daniel can read them and calls him to do it. Daniel comes and interrupts the words that translate to mean that: One, God has numbered Belshazzar's days on earth. Two, Belshazzar has been weighed in the balance and been found wanting. Three, Belshazzar's kingdom will be a wasteland ravaged by his enemies when Belshazzar dies. All this because Belshazzar has profaned the sacred golden sacramental cups meant only to be used for the Eucharist. Death tells Belshazzar know that there was “death,” or poison, in the cups. Belshazzar cries out for Idolatry to save him, but she cannot. He calls out to Vanity to help him, but she cannot. Belshazzar asks Thought to help him, but Thought reminds him that he did not take heed of the warnings he received. Belshazzar finally calls on Daniel. Daniels says he is God's agent and Belshazzar must take his punishment. Belshazzar wonders who could save him – Death says no one. Death says “Die, thou sinner,” draws his sword, and stabs Belshazzar in the heart. As Death and Belshazzar wrestle, Belshazzar calls out a warning to all men. Idolatry lays down her worship of all other gods for God Himself, asks for forgiveness for Calderón's faults, and says that his intentions as the playwright was to point back to God. == See also == *Corpus Christi (feast) *Spanish Golden Age theatre == References == == External links == * Category:Spanish literature Category:Medieval drama Category:Medieval Spain Category:Spanish Golden Age Category:Catholic Church in Spain et:Auto (žanr) pt:Auto ","title":"Autos sacramentales"},{"id":"2548681","text":"Angelica Rock is a small barren rock island emerging from Buzzards Bay, within the town limits of Fairhaven, Massachusetts.

The first people that are known of here are the Seres, so famous for the wool that is found in their forests (...) and the nation of the Attacori on the gulf of that name, a people protected by their sunny hills from all noxious blasts (...)After the Attacori, we find the nations of the Phruri and the Tochari, and, in the interior, the Casiri, a people of India, who look toward the Scythians, and feed on human flesh.\\" (Pliny the Elder, Natural History, 6-20) Category:Bactrian and Indian Hellenistic period Category:Ancient peoples of China Category:Tocharians ","title":"Phryni"},{"id":"2548707","text":"Liberator, DC Comics''Liberator is an arcade game released by Atari, Inc. in 1982. It is based on the Atari Force comic book series published by DC Comics from 1982 to 1986. Liberator has been described as the opposite of Missile Command, in that the player destroys cities from space instead of defending them from the ground. Only 762 arcade machines were ever made. The story \\"Code Name: Liberator\\" describes the premise of the arcade game in detail and was included as a special insert in two comic books cover dated January 1983.DC Comics Presents #53 and The New Teen Titans #27 at the Grand Comics Database Characters and concepts from the comic exist throughout the game. In the opening screen of the arcade game, Commander Champion of the \\"Atari Force\\" asks the player to help free the galaxy from the evil Malaglon Army. == Gameplay == Cabinet side art The Liberator controls consist of a trackball, fire button, and shield button. The player controls a coordinated attack from four star ships at the corners of the screen. The primary target of the attack are enemy bases on a rotating planet in the center of the screen. The trackball is used to move a cross-shaped cursor. The fire button fires a missile at the cursor's location from the closest ship. The shield button is used to activate force fields around the ships. The shield can only take four hits each round, and the count is shared between all ships. At the beginning of each level, the player is flying through outer space and spaceships fly on screen from the left and right and leave in an arc. They try to ram into the player's ships. Shields do not work during this stage. After this stage, the player is taken to a view of a rotating planet. The most prominent enemies are red flashing missile bases. They shoot missiles, fireballs, and star balls at the player's ships. The enemy bases can also detach from the planet, turn into satellites, and orbit the planet while shooting missiles. Once all missile bases are destroyed, the player moves on to the next level. At higher levels, there is the white master base. It is very intelligent, and it can change the direction or speed of the planet rotation to avoid getting hit. At the end of each stage, the player is awarded a bonus ship for every 20,000 points. Missiles can be destroyed, although some split into four smaller particles when destroyed. Fireballs take four hits to destroy, but they slow down on each hit. Star balls also take four hits to destroy, but return to normal speed soon after being hit. Flying saucers sometimes appear from the planet. Flying saucers shoot a large, deadly laser which cannot be stopped. A level select menu allows the player to start at any third level (1, 4, 7... up to 22). ==Legacy== Liberator was released for Microsoft Windows, Xbox, and PlayStation 2 in 2003 as part of Atari Anthology, a collection of Atari arcade and 2600 games. == References == ==External links== * *Liberator at the Arcade History database *Atari Force Headquarters Liberator Section - an Atari Force fan site that discusses Liberator.

The birlinn () was a wooden vessel propelled by sail and oar, used extensively in the Hebrides and West Highlands of Scotland from the Middle Ages on. Variants of the name in English and Lowland Scots include \\"berlin\\" and \\"birling\\". The Gallo-Norse term may derive from the Norse byrðingr (ship of boards). It has been suggested that a local design lineage might also be traceable to vessels similar to the Broighter- type boat (first century BC), equipped with oars and a square sail, without the need to assume a specific Viking design influence.Leslie Alcock, Kings and Warriors, Craftsmen and Priests in Northern Britain AD 550–850 (Edinburgh: Society of Antiquaries of Scotland Monograph Series, 2003), p. 130, It is uncertain, however, whether the Broighter model represents a wooden vessel or a skin-covered boat of the currach type.'Broighter boat, circa 100 BC,' 5 May 2011, Irish Times: http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/weekend/2011/0528/1224297912869.html The majority of scholars emphasise the Viking influence on the birlinn.See, for example, Caldwell, p. 145 The birlinn was clinker-built and could be sailed or rowed. It had a single mast with a square sail. Smaller vessels of this type might have had as few as twelve oars, with the larger West Highland galley having as many as forty. For over four hundred years, down to the seventeenth century, the birlinn was the dominant vessel in the Hebrides. In 1310, King Robert the Bruce granted Thomas Randolph, 1st Earl of Moray a reddendo or charter making him Lord of the Isle of Man in exchange for six birlinns of 26 oars. A 1615 report to the Scottish Privy Council made a distinction between galleys, having between 18 and 20 oars, and birlinns, with between 12 and 18 oars. There was no suggestion of structural differences. The report stated that there were three men per oar.Caldwell, p. 148 The birlinn appears in Scottish heraldry as the \\"lymphad\\", from the Scottish Gaelic long fhada. == Use == In terms of design and function, there was considerable similarity between the local birlinn and the ships used by Norse incomers to the Isles. In an island environment ships were essential for the warfare which was endemic in the area, and local lords used the birlinn extensively from at least the thirteenth century.Rixson, p. 16 The strongest of the regional naval powers were the MacDonalds of Islay.Rixson, p. 20 The Lords of the Isles of the Late Middle Ages maintained the largest fleet in the Hebrides. It is possible that vessels of the birlinn type were used in the 1156 sea battle in which Somerled, Lord of Argyll, the ancestor of the lords, firmly established himself in the Hebrides by confronting his brother-in-law, Godred Olafsson, King of the Isles. In 1608 Andrew Stewart, Lord Ochiltree was sent by James VI of Scotland to quell feuds in the Western Isles. His orders included the destruction of shipping, named in his commissions as lymphads, galleys, and birlinns belonging to rebellious subjects.HMC 6th Report: Duke of Argyll (London, 1877), p. 623 \\"lumfaddis\\" and \\"birlinges\\". Though the surviving evidence has mostly to do with the birlinn in a naval context, there is independent evidence of mercantile activity for which such shipping would have been essential. There is some evidence for mercantile centres in Islay, Gigha, Kintyre and Knapdale, and in the fourteenth century there was constant trade between the Isles, Ireland and England under the patronage of local lords.Rixson, p. 32 Otherwise the chief uses of the birlinn would have been troop-carrying, fishing and cattle transport.Rixson, p. 35 ==Construction and maintenance== In some ways the birlinn paralleled the more robust ocean-going craft of Norse design. Viking ships were double-ended, with a keel scarfed to stems fore and aft. A shell of thin planking (strake) was constructed on the basis of the keel, the planks being edge-joined and clenched with iron nails. Symmetrical ribs or frames were then lashed to the strakes or secured with trenails. Over most of the ribs was laid a slender crossbeam and a thwart. The mast was stepped amidships or nearly so, and oars, including a steering oar, were also used.Greenhill, p. 234 The stem and stern post sometimes had carefully carved notches for plank ends, with knees securing the thwarts to the strakes and beams joining the heads of the frames.Greenhill, p. 219-220 Western Scotland, with the Inner Hebrides shown in dark blue. It was there and on the mainland that timber was most readily obtainable. The hull bore a general resemblance to the Norse pattern, but stem and stern may have been more steeply pitched (though allowance must be paid for distortion in representation). Surviving images show a rudder. Nineteenth-century boat- building practices in the Highlands are likely to have applied also to the birlinn: examples are the use of dried moss, steeped in tar, for caulking, and the use of stocks in construction.Rixson, pp. 158, 160 Oak was the wood favoured both in Western Scotland and in Scandinavia, being tough and resistant to decay. Other types of timber were less often used. It is likely that the Outer Isles of Western Scotland had always been short of timber, but birch, oak and pine abounded in the Inner Isles and on the mainland.Rixson, pp. 104–109 The abundance of timber at Lochaber was proverbial: \\"B'e sin fiodh a chur do Loch Abar\\" (\\"Bringing wood to Lochaber\\") was said of any superfluous undertaking. The tools used are likely to have included adzes, axes, augers and spoon bits, auls, planes, draw knives and moulding irons, together with other tools typical of the Northern European carpenter's kit.Greenhill, p. 247 As in traditional shipbuilding, generally, measurements were largely by eye.Greenhill, p. 245 The traditional practice of sheltering boats in bank- cuttings (\\"nausts\\") – small artificial harbours – was probably also employed with the birlinn. There is evidence in fortified sites of constructed harbours, boat-landings and sea-gates.Rixson pp. 167–168 The influence of Norse shipbuilding techniques, though plausible, is conjectural, since to date no substantial remnants of a birlinn have been found. Traditional boat- building techniques and terms, however, may furnish a guide as to the vessel's construction.See \\"bìrlinn\\" in the on-line edition of Edward Dwelly's Illustrated Gaelic-English Dictionary: http://www.dwelly.org/ Dwelly-d Dwelly air loighne. This gives a comprehensive list of traditional Gaelic words and terms to do with boats. == Rigging and sails == Carved images of the birlinn from the sixteenth century and earlier show the typical rigging: braces, forestay and backstay, shrouds (fore and aft), halyard and a parrel (a movable loop used to secure a yard or gaff to a mast). There is a rudder with pintles on the leading edge, inserted into gudgeons.Rixson, p. 138 It is possible that use was made of a wooden bowline or reaching spar (called a beitass by the Norse). This was used to push the luff of the sail out into the wind.Greenhill, p. 213 Traditional Highland practice was to make sails of tough, thick-threaded wool, with ropes being made of moss-fir or heather.Rixson, pp. 158–159 Medieval sails, in the Highlands as elsewhere, are shown as being sewn out of many small squares, and there is possible evidence of reef points.Rixson, pp. 128–130 ==Aileach: a reconstruction== A reproduction of a 16-oar Highland galley, the Aileach, was built in 1991 at Moville in Donegal. It was based on representations of such vessels in West Highland sculpture. Despite the good seagoing performance of the vessel, its design has been described as misleading because of an over-reliance in the plan on cramped sculptural images. The vessel was designed with a high, almost vertical, stern and stem. It proved difficult to fit in more than one rower per oar and the thwarts were too close together. Less constricted images from the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries show vessels which are longer and larger.Caldwell, pp. 148–49 == Ireland == The Irish long fhada seems, from contemporary sources, to have resembled its West Highland equivalent, though there is as yet no archaeological confirmation.The Irish equivalent of the name bìrlinn is birling, but this refers only to a commander's vessel. The Annals of the Four Masters record the use of fleets in an Irish context, often with a Scottish connection. In 1413 Tuathal Ó Máille, returning from Ulster to Connacht with seven ships, encountered a severe storm (anfadh na mara) which drove them northwards to Scotland: only one of the ships survived. In 1433 Macdonald of the Isles arrived in Ulster with a large fleet (co c-cobhlach mór) to assist the O'Neills in a war with the O'Donnells. In Ireland oared vessels were employed extensively for warfare and piracy by the O'Malleys and the O'Flathertys, western lords whose base was in Connacht. English officials found it necessary to counter them with similar vessels.Rixson, p. 42 The most famous of these local rulers was Gráinne Ní Mháille, of whom Sir Richard Bingham reported in 1591 that she had twenty vessels at her command.Rixson, p. 44 She, like her father, was engaged in extensive seaborne trade.1593 Petition of Gráinne Ní Mháille to Queen Elizabeth, State Papers Relating to Ireland (on microfilm, originals in the Public Record Office, London) SP 63/171/18 There was constant maritime traffic between Ireland and Scotland, and Highland mercenaries were commonly transported by birlinn to Ireland.Rixson, pp. 101–102 == Naval technology == The birlinn, when rowed, was distinguished by its speed, and could often evade pursuers as a result. No cannon were mounted even in the later period: the birlinn was too lightly built and its freeboard was too low.Rixson, p. 49 It was highly suitable for raiding, however, and with experienced marksmen on board, could mount a formidable defence against small craft. Vessels of this type were at their most vulnerable when beached or when cornered by a heavier vessel carrying cannon.Rixson, p. 50 == Possible changes in design == seal of John Moidartach (from 1572). It shows a birlinn with raised decks. There is some evidence that by the end of the sixteenth century new influences were affecting birlinn design. A carving made at Arasaig in 1641 shows a vessel with a lowered stem and stern. An English map of north-east Ireland made no later than 1603 shows \\"fleetes of the Redshanks [Highlanders] of Cantyre\\" with vessels one-masted as before but with a square sail mounted on a sloping yard arm and a small cabin at the stern projecting backwards.From the Dartmouth Collection of the British National Maritime Museum. Two Clanranald seals attached to documents dated 1572 show a birlinn with raised decks at stem and stern, a motif repeated in later heraldic devices. If such changes occurred, they would reflect influences from the south-east and ultimately from the Mediterranean. The supporting evidence has been criticised for being slight and unconvincing,Caldwell, p. 146 but there is pictorial evidence for similar developments in the Irish galley. ==See also== *Irish galley == Notes == == References == * Caldwell, David H.

In many parts of the US and other countries, Botts' dots are used, along with reflective raised pavement markers, to mark lanes on highways and arterial roads. They provide tactile and auditory feedback to drivers when moving across designated travel lanes, and are analogous to rumble strips. Botts' dots are named after Elbert Dysart Botts, a California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) engineer credited with overseeing the research that led to the development of the markers. Botts' dots are most commonly white but may be yellow when used to substitute for the yellow lines that divide opposing directions of traffic in North America. The dots are made of various ceramic materials or plastics such as polyester. On some roads, lanes are marked only with a mix of Botts' dots and conventional reflective markers, eliminating the need to repaint lane divider lines. Botts' dots are rarely used in regions with substantial snowfall, because snow plows damage or dislodge them. ==History== Botts' dots replace the painted median stripes. Reflective Stimsonite (darker orange) markers are spaced at regular intervals for increased visibility at night. Valencia, California Caltrans engineers may have studied the concept of raised pavement markers as early as 1936. However, the department did not commence research in earnest until 1953, when the postwar economic boom resulted in an alarming increase in the number of cars and car accidents in California. Painted lines tended to become invisible during rain. The initial dots were made of glass and were attached to the road by nails or tacks, as suggested by Botts. The nails were soon abandoned: his team discovered that when the dots popped loose under stress, the nails punctured tires. Contrary to a common myth, the published record does not make clear whether Botts invented the famous epoxy that solved the problem; some sources indicate that one of his protégés was responsible for the epoxy. In September 1966, the California State Legislature mandated that Botts' dots be used for lane markings for all state highways in all non-snowfall areas. ==Usage== Today, there are more than 25 million Botts' dots in use in California, though they have started falling out of favor. In 2017, Caltrans announced that it would stop using Botts' dots as the sole indicator of lane division, due to cost and worker safety, and in order to make roadways more compatible with self-driving cars. Reflective lane markings will be wider and thicker, providing some of the tactile feedback the Botts' dots provided. In California, highway lanes may be marked either solely by Botts' dots, or dots placed over painted lines. Four dots are used for broken lines on freeways, and broken lines on surface streets may use only three dots. Reflective pavement markers are placed at regular intervals between Botts' dots to increase the visibility of lane markings at night. In the Las Vegas area of southern Nevada, roads with multiple lanes use four pavement markers for each broken white line, a reflective marker followed by three Botts' dots. More recently, Botts' dots have been used in the snow-free areas of Alabama, Florida, Hawaii, Louisiana, Mississippi, Nevada, Georgia, Washington, and Texas. Some states that do experience snow, particularly Pennsylvania and Massachusetts, use Botts' dots only during the summer months for temporary lane markings in construction zones. Typically, the dots are installed when construction starts in the spring, and they are removed when work stops for the winter. In New Mexico, where snow is common in most locations during the winter, Botts' dots are used along with Reflective markers to outline gore areas at interchanges, but the state does not use either for regular lane markings on state highways. Some local jurisdictions (notably Alamogordo and Las Cruces) use Botts' dots and reflective markers for regular lane markings on local streets. Botts' dots had also been employed previously in Albuquerque, but the city has since discontinued their use in favor of reflective paint for pavement markings. Until the late 1990s, Botts' dots were also used extensively in the snow-free areas of Arizona, however, ADOT has since ended this practice, opting for painted stripes with reflective markers instead. However, they can still be found on US Route 95 south of Yuma, as well as on some local streets in Yuma and Tucson. Many states in snow-prone areas of the Midwest and Northeastern United States use reflectors placed into protective metal castings, which allow them to be plowed over without being dislodged from the road surface. These pavement markers are usually augmented with reflective paint and delineators placed on plastic or metal posts at regular intervals along the edges of the road. In California and other locations in the Southwest United States that experience occasional but significant snowfall, the reflectors are placed into recessed pockets in the roadway, which allows visibility during dry weather but permits a plow blade to travel across the reflector without dislodging it, with no special protective castings needed. ==See also== *Cat's eye (road) *Raised pavement marker *Rumble strip ==References== ==External links== *Caltrans Botts' dots fact sheet Category:Road surface markings ","title":"Botts' dots"},{"id":"2548739","text":"Itarsi is a city and municipality in Madhya Pradesh, India in Hoshangabad District.

An itinerarium (plural: itineraria) was an Ancient Roman road map in the form of a listing of cities, villages (vici) and other stops, with the intervening distances. One surviving example is the Peutinger Table (Tabula Peutingeriana); another is the Antonine Itinerary. The Romans and ancient travelers in general did not use maps. They may have existed as specialty items in some of the libraries, but they were hard to copy and were not in general use. On the Roman road system, however, the traveller needed some idea of where he or she was going, how to get there, and how long it would take. The itinerarium filled this need. In origin it was simply a list of cities along a road: \\"at their most basic, itineraria involve the transposition of information given on milestones, which were an integral feature of the major Roman roads, to a written script.\\"Jaś Elsner, \\"The Itinerarium Burdigalense: politics and salvation in the geography of Constantine's Empire\\" The Journal of Roman Studies (2000), pp. 181–195, p. 184. It was only a short step from lists to a master list. To sort out the lists, the Romans drew diagrams of parallel lines showing the branches of the roads. Parts of these were copied and sold on the streets. The very best featured symbols for cities, way stations, water courses, and so on. The maps did not represent landforms but they served the purpose of a simple schematic diagram for the user. The Roman government from time to time undertook to produce a master itinerary of all Roman roads. Julius Caesar and Mark Antony commissioned the first known such effort in 44 BC. Zenodoxus, Theodotus, and Polyclitus, three Greek geographers, were hired to survey the system and compile a master itinerary. This task required over 25 years. The result was a stone engraved master itinerarium set up near the Pantheon, from which travelers and itinerary sellers could make copies. Archaeology has turned up some itinerary material in unexpected places. The Cups of Cadiz, four silver cups found by workmen excavating a foundation at Bracciano in 1852, are engraved with the names and distances of stations between Cadiz and Rome. The term itinerary changed meaning over the centuries. In the Itinerarium Burdigalense (Bordeaux Pilgrim, 333 AD), the itinerary is a description of what route to take to the Holy Land. The Itinerarium Alexandri is a list of the conquests of Alexander the Great. Today it means either a travel journal or a list of recommended stops. The term also refers to medieval guide-books written by travellers: most of these are accounts of pilgrimages to the Holy Land. ==See also== * Antonine Itinerary * Itinerarium Burdigalense * Tabula Peutingeriana * Periplus ==References== Category:Roman itineraries Category:Map types Category:Maps ","title":"Itinerarium"},{"id":"2548773","text":"The House of Israel is a Jewish community located in Sefwi Wiawso in southwestern Ghana.

The Itsekiri presently number just under 1 million people and live mainly in the Warri South, Warri North and Warri South West local government districts of Delta State on the Atlantic coast of Nigeria. Significant communities of Itsekiris can be found in parts of Edo and Ondo states and in various other Nigerian cities including Lagos, Sapele, Benin City, Port Harcourt and Abuja. Many people of Itsekiri descent also reside in the United Kingdom, the United States and Canada.The Itsekiris are closely related to the Yoruba of South Western Nigeria and more widely to the Urhobo (especially the Okpe) and Edo peoples. The Itsekiris traditionally refer to their land as the Kingdom of Warri or 'Iwerre' as its proper name – which is geographically contiguous to the area covered by the three Warri local government districts. The area is a key centre of Nigeria's crude oil and natural gas production and petroleum refining and the main town Warri (a multi-ethnic metropolis) forms the industrial and commercial nucleus of the Delta State region. ==Ethnography== The Itsekiri are a people of very mixed ethnic origins who speak a language very closely related to the Yoruba of south western Nigeria and the Igala language of central Nigeriahttp://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/61232/Benue-Congo- languages/214891/Defoid?anchor=ref708824 but which has also borrowed some cultural practice from the Edo people of Benin City, given the hegemony that the Benin Empire once exercised over the area, Portuguese in trade terminologies, as the Itsekiri were the first people in Nigeria to establish contact with the Portuguese who were exploring the West African coast, and also more recently, English. Although linguistically related to the Yoruba and Igala ethnic groups, however, through centuries of intermingling modern day Itsekiris are of mixed ethnic origins. They are most closely related to the South-Eastern Yorubaland sub-groups - Ijebu, Akure, Ikale, Ondo and Owo), but also Edo, Urhobo, Ijaw are today mainly Christian (Protestant and Roman Catholic) by religion. Thus having had six centuries of direct cultural exposure to Western Christianity and other African influences, contemporary Itsekiri language and culture has successfully evolved into a hybrid of the many cultures that have influenced its development. Similarly owing to the complex genetic mix of most Itsekiris over the centuries, many individuals self-identifying as Itsekiri would usually be a complex mix of any of the aforementioned ethnic and racial groups. Thus modern day Itsekiris may be the only southern Nigerian ethnic group to be almost totally heterogeneous (mixed) in its genetic composition. The total absence of any dialectal variation in the Itsekiri language is also unique for the region and is most likely the result of the early coalescing of the Itsekiri people into a small and highly centralised nation state from the 15th century onward. ==History== In the 15th century, the early Itsekiris adopted a prince Ginuwa (also called \\"Iginuwa\\" in Bini Language) from the Kingdom of Benin as a monarch, and quickly coalesced into a kingdom under his rule.Merchant prince of the Niger delta, Prof Obaro Ikime, Heinemann Educational 1968 Traditionally fishermen and traders, the Itsekiri were among the first in the region to make contact with Portuguese traders.journal of the Anthropological Institute, Old Series Vol. XXVIII by Messrs. R.K. Granville and F.N. Roth These interactions in the 16th century led the Itsekiri to become primarily Roman Catholic. The Itsekiri monarchy has continued to the present day, with the coronation of Ogiame Ikenwoli on 12 December in 2015. The Itsekiri's historical capital is Ode-Itsekiri (also called \\"big warri\\" or \\"Ale iwerre\\"), though the monarch's main palace is in Warri town the largest city in the area and home to diverse other communities including the Urhobos, Ijaws, Isoko, and many other Nigerian and expatriate groups working in the oil and gas industry. ==Itsekiris today== The Itsekiri, though a minority group within Nigeria, are considered to be a highly educated and affluent ethnic group with a very high rate of literacy and a rich cultural heritage. The Itsekiris have one of the oldest histories of western education in West Africa, and are noted for producing one of its earliest university graduates – the Olu of Warri Kingdom, Olu Atuwatse I, Dom Domingo a 17th-century graduate of Coimbra University in Portugal. Today, many Itsekiris can be found working in the professions particularly medicine, law and the academic professions and in business, trade and industry and were among the pioneers that led the development of the professions in Nigeria during the early-to-mid 20th century . ==Culture== The Itsekiris traditionally lived in a society that was governed by a monarchy (the Olu) and council of chiefsProf P.C. Lloyd Ethnographic Survey of Africa, Western Africa, Part XIII (1957) who form the nobility or aristocracy. Itsekiri society itself was organised along the lines of an upper class made up of the royal family and the aristocracy – the 'Oloyes and Olareajas' these were mainly drawn from noble houses including the Royal Houses and the Houses of Olgbotsere (Prime Minister or king maker) and Iyatsere (defence minister). The middle class or Omajaja were free-born Itsekiris or burghers. As a result of the institution of slavery and the slave trade there was a third class 'Oton-Eru' or those descended from the slave class whose ancestors had come from elsewhere and settled in Itsekiriland as indentured or slave labourers.A History of Itsekiri, William A Moore In modern-day Itsekiri society the slave class no longer exists as all are considered free-born. Traditionally, Itsekiri men wear a long sleeved shirt called a Kemeje, tie a George wrapper around their waist and wear a hat with a feather stuck to it. The women wear a blouse and also tie a George wrapper around their waist. They wear colourful head gears known as Nes (scarf) or coral beads. Itsekiris are also famed for their traditional fishing skills, melodious songs, gracefully fluid traditional dances and colourful masquerades and boat regattas.Merchant Prince of the Niger Delta by Prof Obaro Ikime, Heinemann 1968 ==Religion== Before the introduction of Christianity in the 16th century, like many other African groups, the Itsekiris largely followed a traditional form of religion known as Ebura-tsitse (based on ancestral worship) which has become embedded in modern-day traditional Itsekiri culture. Once the dominant form of western Christianity in Itsekiriland for centuries, only a minority of Itsekiris are Roman Catholics today whilst the majority are Protestants notably Baptist and Anglican. ==Itsekiri language== Whilst genetically, the Itsekiris are a complex mixture of the many different ethnicities and races that have settled in their area, however, the Itsekiri language is very closely related to the Ilaje and other south-eastern Yoruba dialects and to the Igala.http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/61232/Benue-Congo- languages/214891/Defoid?anchor=ref708824 It has also been influenced significantly by the Bini, Portuguese and English languages due to centuries of interaction with people from those nations. However, it remains a key branch of the Yoruboid familyEthnologue Languages of the World Sixteenth edition 2009 of languages even retaining archaic or lost elements of the proto Yoruba language due to its relative isolation in the Niger-Delta where it developed away from the main cluster of Yoruba language dialects. Unlike nearly all key Nigerian Languages, the Itsekiri language does not have dialects and is uniformly spoken with little or no variance in pronunciation apart from the use of 'ch' for the regular 'ts' (sh) in the pronunciation of some individual Itsekiris, e.g. Chekiri instead of the standard Shekiri but these are individual pronunciation traits rather than dialectal differences. This may be a relic of past dialectal differences. The English language continues to exert a strong influence on the Itsekiri language both in influencing its development and in its widespread usage as a first language amongst the younger generation. Modern standard Yoruba (the variety spoken in Lagos) also appears to be influencing the Itsekiri language partly due to the similarity between both languages and the ease of absorbing colloquial Yoruba terms by the large Itsekiri population living in Western Nigerian cities. Itsekiri is now taught in local schools up to university degree level in Nigeria. There are a number of semi-autonomous Itsekiri communities such as Ugborodo, koko, Omadino and Obodo whose history predates the 15th-century establishment of the Warri Kingdom. The Ugborodo community claims direct descent from the Ijebu a major Yoruba sub-ethnic group ==Notable people== *Ikenwoli Godfrey Emiko (The Olu of Warri Kingdom) *Festus Okotie-Eboh (Politician/ The first Nigeria finance Minister) *Alfred Rewane (Business Man and a financier of NADECO) *Sunday Tuoyo (Retired Nigerian Brigadier General & Military Governor of Ondo State between July 1978 - October 1979) *Misan Sagay (Screenwriter) *Emmanuel Uduaghan (Politician/ Former Governor Delta State) * Omawumi Megbele (Musician) * Oritse Femi (Musician) * Florence Omagbemi - Nigeria U20 Female football team coacah and former player for the super falcons. * Pastor Ayo Oritsejafor *Grace Alele-Williams (first female Vice Chancellor of a Nigerian University). * Ayiri Emami (The Prime Minister of Warri Kingdom) * Amaju Pinnick (Nigeria Football Federation Chairman) *Tuedon Morgan (Nigerian Marathon runner - 2 Guinness world records) * Sam Oritsetimeyin Omatseye * Dudu Omagbemi ==References== == External links == *Iwe Iṣẹ ti Egwari Ṣẹkiri The Book of Common Prayer in Isekiri *Urhobo Historical Society article *Africana Digitization Project article, \\"The Slave Trade in Niger Delta Oral Tradition\\" *Itsekiri US Category:Indigenous peoples of the Niger Delta Category:Ethnic groups in Nigeria ","title":"Itsekiri people"},{"id":"2548788","text":"Location of Ituiutaba in the state of Minas Gerais Ituiutaba is a municipality in the western part of Minas Gerais state, Brazil.

The first name was Arraial de São José do Tijuco. In 1890 there were 5,000 inhabitants. In 1901 it became a municipality with the name Vila Platina, later changed in 1917 to Ituiutaba. Unveiling the congado history in Ituiutaba-MG In Ituiutaba reportedly some Congadeiros, the festivities took place on farms outside the city where they also raised their suits. With the becoming of time, the festival has become known, was brought to the city. However, the parish priest of the time did not accept that Congadeiros walk into the church, prohibiting the holding of the festival site. This ban was because the Congadeiros, did not follow the Catholic religion, but others of African origin. Meanwhile, around Ituiutaba, to honor his wife Geralda Ramos da Silva on his birthday on April 2, 1951, Mr. Demetrio Silva da Costa (Cyzicus) invited his father Marciano Silvestre da Costa, his brother Gerard Clarimundo Coast and several other friends to play Mozambique and commemorate the date. Upon learning of the incident, Ana Carolina Ribeiro (Dona Rosa), cousin of Cyzicus, invited the group to work together to bring the suit in Mozambique Ituiutaba and rekindle the devotion to St. Benedict with much dancing, partying and devotion. So they went to the parish priest of the time, Father John Ave, to communicate it and ask him to leave, next to the church, making the feast of St. Benedict and Our Lady of the Rosary. The pastor, not allowed, claiming that the Church had problems previously with the suits Congado that formerly existed in Ituiutaba, and that because of these clashes, had already fragmentado. In 1952, the newly created suit, decided to rehearse in order placing the group properly uniformed street in protest against the attitude of the priest. They walked down the street 22 at 5 am. They made a dawn with fireworks in front of the Forum site getting the consent of justice to conduct the celebrations in the city. They went to St. Joseph Church, where he entered the enclosure and attended the morning mass. After the Congadeiros went visiting various residences singing, dancing saints protectors streets. In the following years the party happened without the existence of a fellowship or church support. Still, Congadeiros insisted on having the recognition of the celebration by the church, performing each year the festivities in honor of St. Benedict and Our Lady of the Rosary, with the support of the devotees and supporters. Years later, restructures itself in the Congado Ituiutaba. The group now organized, lock arms with a drop of the pastor of the church, which is to make a series of these requirements to concede to the same space at the site. One of those requirements was that the Congadeiros really embrace the Catholic faith. Accepting the request of the priest they baptized, received first Eucharist, crismaram and those who were cohabiting, married in the Church. Another requirement was that the Congadeiros had active participation in religious ceremonies, just like that, the party would have some relationship with the Church. Thus the Catholic Church tried to erase their black African religious heritage, yet the Congadeiros although \\"Catholics\\" did not fail to keep their ancestral practices, even if secretly. Before the completion of all requirements made by him, Father John Ave, in 1956, asked the Congadeiros to choose twelve couples among themselves who knew well the Catholic doctrines. Of these couples, men appointed by the priest as \\"The Twelve Apostles\\" (Marciano Silvestre da Costa, Clarimundo Geraldo da Costa, Demetrius Silva da Costa - Cyzicus, Antonio Belchior, Baldwin Anthony da Costa - Antonio Goat, Agenor Prudêncio do Nascimento, Andira Alves, Max Avelino da Costa, Jerome Ventura Keys-Dunga, Aristides da Silva, Antônio Manoel Gomes and Lord Edmund) founded the Brotherhood of St. Benedict according to the instructions of the pastor, who authorized, in 1957, the operation of the Brotherhood, by blaming it suits founded between the years 1951 to 1954 and by others who supposedly were to arise. From the creation of the Brotherhood of St. Benedict groups Congado also now have their own religious group within the Church, which is replaced by function not only religious but also cultural, organizing and coordinating suits Congado of Ituiutaba. As listed in the Small History of the Brotherhood of St. Benedict, it was founded on 13 May 1957 with \\"special service\\" and \\"First Communion Benedictines of several young children and adults.\\" It was through the creation of the Brotherhood of St. Benedict that Congadeiros won permission to celebrate in the Church. It was through her that they also raised capital to later buy the land and erect the Church of St. Benedict. The Brotherhood was originally formed by just over 100 people; today it includes over 600 individuals. She has become the guarantee of Congadeiros \\"law of the Church\\"; their creation and foundation opened the doors to the consolidation of suits and became the foundation for what emerged. The feast in honor of St. Benedict is composed of seven suits Congado the participation of several others from the surrounding cities that participate in the celebrations for several years. ==See also== * List of municipalities in Minas Gerais ==References== Category:Municipalities in Minas Gerais ","title":"Ituiutaba"},{"id":"2548789","text":"Masterson may refer to: Places: *United States: ** Masterson, community, Carson County, Texas () ** Masterson, community, Moore County, Texas () ** Masterson Lake, reservoir, Tyler County, Texas () ** Masterson Lake Dam, dam, Tyler County, Texas () ** Masterson Mill, community, Lawrence County, Alabama () ** Masterson Mill Lake Dam, dam, Lawrence County, Alabama () ** Masterson Oil Field, oilfield, Pecos County, Texas () ** Mastersonville, community, Lancaster County, Pennsylvania () ** The Masterson Institute For Psychoanalytic Psychotherapy, New York City Other: * Masterson (surname) ","title":"Masterson"},{"id":"2548795","text":"Cedar Pond is a small oval-shaped pond in the town of Lakeville, Massachusetts.

The Open Group had to make a decision about what to stick with, and unfortunately the final POSIX threads were different from their selection. POSIX Draft 4 threads were limited to begin with (the final standard fixed these). Microsoft adopted DCE/RPC wholesale in Windows NT as MSRPC and also in DCOM. Most of the stability and reliability problems that programmers associate with DCOM services - especially memory leaks, exception handling problems and thread cancellation stability issues - can be traced back to the use of POSIX Draft 4 threads. DCE/RPC is sufficiently complex that the issue of updating it to solve and modernise the POSIX Draft 4 threading problem requires highly skilled and highly specific programming knowledge. Consequently, for all that it can accomplish, the reference implementation of DCE/RPC languishes due to a lack of information and resources. The key difference between POSIX Draft 4 threads and the final POSIX threads specification, aside from a number of functions being interruptible where others are not, is thread cancellation. DCE/RPC utilises thread cancellation to propagate signals across the \\"Remote\\" of RPC, such that for example a client application terminating a thread results in its corresponding thread on the server also being terminated in the same way. Unfortunately, the final POSIX specification does not include such sophisticated cancellation methodology, and, given the difficulties that the Unix vendors had in correctly implementing the POSIX threads specification, it is not surprising that it was removed. ==Recent developments== Linux, since the introduction of NPTL and the Linux 2.6 kernel, has proper support for thread cancellation. ==Current use== DCEThreads now only realistically exists as an emulation layer.

The society was founded chiefly to combat existing class separation among literary societies; prior to 1768, Yale freshmen were not \\"received into any Society\\", and junior society members were forced into the servitude of seniors \\"under dread of the severest penalties\\".Quoted remarks are the opinions of the Brothers in Unity Society of 1841, on page 2 of its catalogue Humphreys, a freshman of the class of 1771, persuaded two members of the senior class, three junior class members, two sophomores, and 14 freshmen to support the society's founding. ===Early activity=== Immediately after its conception, the society's unorthodox class composition was allegedly challenged by other literary groups at Yale College. According to its catalogue, Brothers in Unity only became an independent institution after persevering \\"an incessant war\\" waged by multiple traditional societies who did not support the concept of a four-year debating community. It is speculated that this struggle initiated the Brothers' near 250-year rivalry with Linonia, which previously did not initiate freshman members. Within a year, however, Brothers in Unity became fully independent, its popularity influencing other societies to reconsider their exclusion of first year students. The Yale College freshman class of 1771 yielded 15 members of Brothers in Unity, while Linonia accepted four; the first noted point in which underclassmen were publicly accepted into a Yale society. The Brothers adopted the motto between 1768 and 1769. ===1768-1841=== Between its founding and 1841, the society is said to have followed the template of other debating societies, although operating under \\"Masonic secrecy,\\" according to 19th century Yale historian Ebenezer Baldwin.History of Yale College: From Its Foundation, A.D. 1700, to the Year 1838. Ebenezer Baldwin, Esq. Page 235. In conjunction with Linonia and the Calliopean Society, Brothers in Unity was noted by Baldwin to discuss \\"scientific questions\\" and gravitate towards \\"literary pursuits.\\" This is substantiated by the Brother's own public documentation, which denotes that the society sought \\"lofty places in science, literature, and oratory\\" fields, as well as general \\"intellectual improvement.\\" The Brotherhood, between the years of 1768 and 1841, claims membership of 15 Supreme Court Justices (seven of which Chief Justices), 6 United States Governors, 13 Senators, 45 Congressional representatives, 14 presidents of colleges and universities, two United States Attorney Generals, and a United States Vice President. In its catalogue, the Brotherhood also asserts: \\"Every President of the United States, with the exception of two, has had in his cabinet one of our members, and the governor's chair of our own state has been filled for twenty years with Brothers in Unity.\\" 26 Yale valedictorians after the position's 1798 founding are attributed to the Society. Membership to the Brothers and the Linonian Society divided the students of Yale College beginning in the turn of the 19th century. Both held expansive literary collections, which they used to compete against each other. Between 1780 and 1841, the Brothers claimed right to more volumes than Linonia, although these assertions are disputedSee also: History of Yale College: From Its Foundation, A.D. 1700, to the Year 1838. Ebenezer Baldwin, Esq. Page 235-236 The two societies' rivalry extended to their membership. Brothers in Unity claims membership of John C. Calhoun, who was alphabetically assigned to Linonia, but had \\"undiminished attachment\\" to the Brothers. However, while publications released by both societies repeatedly assert superiority amongst each other, they also express positive sentiment; denoting each other as \\"ornaments\\" of Yale and \\"generous rivals.\\"The Linonian Society Library of Yale College: The First Years, 1768—1790Kathy M. Umbricht Straka The Yale University Library Gazette, Vol. 54, No. 4 (April 1980), pp. 183-192 At the time of the formation of Yale's central library, Linonia and 'Brothers in Unity donated their respective libraries to the university. The donation is commemorated in the Linonia and Brothers Reading Room of Yale's Sterling Memorial Library. The reading room contains the Linonia and Brothers (L&B;) collection, a travel collection, a collection devoted to medieval history, and a selection of new books recently added to Sterling’s collections. ==Actions as a secret society== Following the transformation of Yale's debating societies into the Yale Union, and later, the Yale Political Union, Brothers in Unity and the Linonian Society ceased function as literary and debating societies. Both societies continued their existence in secrecy, recanting their roles as intellectual colloquiums and instead prioritizing power and social influence as paramount. Linonia morphed into the template of other Yale secret societies, although its current existence is still questioned and its membership is not disclosed to the public as of 2012. While unsubstantiated, Linonia is said to participate in Yale's April \\"tap night,\\" along with the college's senior societies. Unlike Linonia, Brothers in Unity refrained from association with the customs of Yale's senior societies. The society is rumored to tap a small cohort of members from each class during the fall semester, a notion in line with the organization's 1768 constitution and 1841 catalogue. Internally, the society is referenced as the \\"Brotherhood,\\" a community stressing unilateral action amongst members to acquire power in the realms of business, politics, and philanthropy. The society is said to have implemented methods of deterrence stemming from its 1768 constitution that prevent brothers from unearthing the identities of fellow members or disclosing internal actions of the brotherhood. However, public knowledge of specific traditions, discussions, and society regulations of Brothers in Unity ended after its 19th-century turn to secrecy, rendering most modern rumor as conjecture. It is rumored that the society maintains \\"taplines\\" into several of Yale's most prestigious senior societies, including Skull and Bones, Scroll and Key, Book and Snake, Myth and Sword, Elihu, and Mace and Chain. Though the society no longer discloses the names of its members, its presence on campus continued through the 19th and 20th centuries, with reported activity spanning into the turn of the 21st century. It is unknown whether men exclusively fill current membership of the Brothers, due to the integration of women into Yale's societal web. ==Prominent members== ===Note=== ===List=== *John C.

ASCII Media Works published 26 novels from November 2002 to November 2012 under their Dengeki Bunko imprint. The story focuses on Yuji Sakai, a high school boy who inadvertently becomes involved in an age-old conflict between forces of balance and imbalance in existence. In the process, he befriends a fighter for the balancing force and names her \\"Shana\\". The series incorporates fantasy and slice of life elements into its tale. Two manga adaptations were published by ASCII Media Works in Dengeki Daioh and Dengeki Maoh. Between 2005 and 2012, the series was adapted by J.C.Staff into three 24-episode anime television series, a four-episode original video animation (OVA) series, an animated film and an additional stand alone OVA episode. A PlayStation 2 video game was released in March 2006, and it was ported to the Nintendo DS in March 2007. Viz Media licensed the novels and the first manga series for release in North America, but stopped publishing both prematurely. Geneon originally licensed the first television series for release in North America, but the license later transferred to Funimation, who also licensed the remaining anime properties. Critics praised the series for its execution of typical story elements. ==Plot and characters== Shakugan no Shana details an age-old conflict between those who inhabit the , a parallel universe to the human world. The Crimson Realm is populated by who are able to manipulate the , a fundamental power within any biological entity and functions as \\"fuel\\" for one's existence. Denizens whose power stands out among their peers are known as , and Lords that are even more powerful are known as . Denizens who do not care about the balance between the Crimson Realm and the human world collect Power of Existence from humans to use for their own purposes. It is the duty of , humans who have formed contracts with a Crimson Lord, to maintain the two worlds' balance by killing any Denizens disrupting it. Denizens and Flame Haze fight with the use of powerful magic spells called , which are also known as Unrestricted Spells or Unrestricted Methods. One such spell is the , which creates a space where the Crimson Realm and the human world intermingle and all sorts of causalities, including time, are stopped for ordinary living beings. The story largely takes place in Misaki City in Japan and begins when high school student Yuji Sakai is thrown into the middle of this conflict and encounters a Flame Haze girl with flaming red eyes and hair dressed in all black wielding a katana. The girl informs him that he died some time ago, and that he is a , a human with greatly diminished Power of Existence, and whose remaining Power of Existence will slowly run out. In addition, Yuji is a , a special kind of Torch who contains a , a magical object created by Denizens that can provide special abilities or even Powers of Unrestraint; additionally, Mystes can move within Seals. Unfazed by his apparent death, Yuji befriends the girl and names her \\"Shana\\" after her sword. They later discover that the Treasure Tool within Yuji is the , which restores his Power of Existence every night at midnight. As time goes on, Shana and Yuji encounter several more Flame Haze, such as Margery Daw and Wilhelmina Carmel, and Denizens in Misaki City. An organization of Denizens called Bal Masqué discovers that Yuji possesses the Reiji Maigo and attempt to use the Treasure Tool on two separate occasions. Bal Masqué is led by three Lords called the Trinity: Hecate, Sydonay, and Bel Peol. They serve under a Crimson God known as the , who resides within the Reiji Maigo. When the Snake of the Festival emerges, it merges its consciousness with Yuji's, assuming command over Bal Masqué, and together they formulate an elaborate plan to create a parallel world called Xanadu, which will serve as a paradise for Denizens with unlimited Power of Existence. Shana, and all of the other Flame Haze around the world, oppose the creation of Xanadu, which would eventually cause a large-scale disruption in the human world, the Crimson Realm and Xanadu itself. Shana formulates a countermeasure and is ultimately successful in adding a single law to Xanadu where the Denizens are not allowed to eat humans anymore. With Xanadu created, the Denizens depart to the new world, soon followed by hundreds of Flame Haze determined to help enforce order on it. Yuji intends to go to Xanadu alone and make sure humans and Denizens can eventually learn to coexist, but Shana refuses to be left behind. In the end, Yuji accepts Shana's feelings and the two kiss, which activates a spell left to Yuji by Crimson Lord Lamia that restores his existence, so Yuji is no longer a Torch. With the help of another spell from Lamia, Yuji successfully restores all humans in Misaki City whose existence was absorbed by the Denizens before he and Shana depart for Xanadu together. ==Production== In an early draft of what would later become Shakugan no Shana, Yashichiro Takahashi set the story in a different dimension and described the main character as having the initial personality of Shana, but the appearance of an older woman similar to Margery Daw. However, after talking with an editor, Takahashi rewrote the character to have the appearance of a young girl. In doing so, he used Shana's small build to symbolize a story of growth and to emphasize the physical conflict between her and her opponents. Noizi Ito was contacted in early August 2002 to be the illustrator for the series, and she was very excited to work on the project after she read the manuscript for the first novel; this was the first time Ito drew illustrations for a book. Shortly before writing Shakugan no Shana, Takahashi made his debut as an author with A/B Extreme, which was awarded an honorable mention in the eighth Dengeki Novel Prize by MediaWorks (now ASCII Media Works) in 2001. By his own admission, A/B Extreme was too difficult for readers to understand, so for his next work, he set out to write something easier to grasp. As such, the initial premise of Shakugan no Shana was to write a boy meets girl story in a school setting, though initially love was not one of the themes included. He was given the freedom to write as he pleased based on this premise after showing it to his editor. ==Media== ===Light novels and books=== Shakugan no Shana began as a light novel series written by Yashichiro Takahashi, with illustrations drawn by Noizi Ito. ASCII Media Works published 26 volumes between November 9, 2002 and November 10, 2012 under their Dengeki Bunko imprint; 22 comprise the main story, while the other four are side story collections. A short story was later published in the September 2017 issue of ASCII Media Works' Dengeki Bunko Magazine. Viz Media licensed the novels for English distribution in North America, but they only released two volumes in 2007. The novels are also licensed in South Korea by Daewon C.I., and in Taiwan and Hong Kong by Kadokawa Media. A 160-page guide book titled was published on December 10, 2005 by ASCII Media Works. Two more guide books were published by ASCII Media Works for the anime adaptations: on October 27, 2006 with 176 pages, and on October 19, 2009 with 168 pages. Four 128-page art books illustrated by Ito were published by ASCII Media Works: on February 25, 2005, on August 9, 2007, on August 10, 2009, and on August 9, 2013. ===Manga=== A manga adaptation, illustrated by Ayato Sasakura, was serialized in ASCII Media Works' manga magazine Dengeki Daioh between the April 2005 and October 2011 issues.

A second manga illustrated by Shii Kiya, titled , is based on the events of the tenth novel and began serialization in ASCII Media Works' manga magazine Dengeki Black Maoh on September 19, 2007. The manga was later transferred to Dengeki Maoh and ran in that magazine between the December 2009 and September 2012 issues. Five volumes were released between January 27, 2009 and September 27, 2012. The manga is licensed in South Korea by Daewon C.I., and in Taiwan and Hong Kong by Kadokawa Media. ===Anime=== A 24-episode anime television series adaptation of Shakugan no Shana aired in Japan between October 6, 2005 and March 23, 2006 on TV Kanagawa.

Geneon licensed the first TV series for North American distribution, but after Geneon withdrew from the North American market, Funimation Entertainment took up the manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution rights, though Geneon still retained the license. A DVD box set was released by Funimation in September 2008, and was re-released in September 2009 under Funimation's \\"Viridian Collection\\". Funimation later re- licensed the first series and re-released it in a BD/DVD combo pack on August 21, 2012.

A 36-page A4-sized art book titled featuring illustrations by Ito was available to those who pre-ordered the game. The game was re-released as a \\"Best\\" version on February 7, 2008. The story was written by Takahashi, and features character designs by Ito. The opening theme song is \\"Exist\\" by Rie Kugimiya, which was released on volume one of the Assorted Shana albums. The player assumes the role of Yuji Sakai during the visual novel aspect, where much of the game's duration is spent on reading the text that appears on the screen, which represents the story's narrative and dialogue. The game follows a branching plot line through eight chapters with five possible endings, and depending on the decisions that the player makes during the game, the plot will progress in a specific direction. Every so often, the player will come to a point where he or she is given the chance to choose from multiple options. Text progression pauses at these points until a choice is made. To view all plot lines in their entirety, the player will have to replay the game multiple times and choose different choices to further the plot to an alternate direction. Sometimes during text progression, an \\"active countdown\\" minigame appears, which requires the player to press the game buttons in a specific order in a set time limit. Success or failure in these minigames influence which endings are viewed. During the turn-based battle sequences, the player assumes the role of Shana. The player uses a combination of fire, powers of unrestraint, and treasure tools to battle Crimson Denizens; and Shana is also able to use a special attack and defend. A Nintendo DS port of the game titled Shakugan no Shana DS, developed by Vridge and published by MediaWorks, was released on March 29, 2007. Those who pre-ordered the game received a calendar spanning April 2007 to March 2008, and an art book of rough sketches by Ito titled was available for a limited time with the purchase of the game. A new story for the DS version was written by Takahashi. The game also contains an image gallery that allows the player to see what Shana and Yoshida Kazumi look like in different clothes, and a battle mode that lets the player fight against the computer with a character other than Shana. Shana appears as a playable character in the crossover RPG Dengeki Gakuen RPG: Cross of Venus for the Nintendo DS, and other characters from Shakugan no Shana also appear in the game. Shana appears in the 2014 fighting game Dengeki Bunko: Fighting Climax, which features various Dengeki Bunko characters. ==Reception== In October 2014, the novels were reported to have sold over 8.6 million copies. As reported on the obi strip on volume 4 of the Shakugan no Shana manga released in January 2008, 1.2 million copies of the manga had been sold. Theron Martin from Anime News Network reviewed the manga and called it \\"inferior\\" to the anime, and notes the anime develops characters better than the manga. Martin also critiques the art, saying the background art has little detail, and while the action scenes are handled well enough, they are still sub-par compared to the same scenes in the anime. Martin concludes the review by warning the readers that \\"[if] this is your first exposure to the franchise, look to the anime version to see it done right.\\" When reviewing the anime, Martin thought the first Shakugan no Shana always manages to slightly exceed expectations, and while its story elements may be typical, its execution is not. Martin noted that Shana's Flame Haze transformation is a visual highlight of the series, and other details are shown equal care. Reviewer Chris Beveridge of Mania.com felt uncomfortable about the morbid nature of the series. While Beveridge did not think the series is \\"groundbreaking\\", it proves to be a \\"solid title\\" that continuously gets better. The pacing in the middle of the first season was criticized for quickly ending an arc before \\"going into a storyline that feels out of character for the show.\\" Martin's review of Shakugan no Shana Final was less positive; he described Yuji as having been made into a different character (though his complexity was praised), criticized the addition of a large number of prominent characters without sufficient development, and described some things as not making sense, although he praised Shana's development over the course of the third series. ==References== * ==External links== *Shakugan no Shana official website * *Shakugan no Shana at Funimation Entertainment * Category:2002 Japanese novels Category:2005 anime television series Category:2005 manga Category:2006 anime OVAs Category:2006 video games Category:2007 anime films Category:2007 anime television series Category:2007 manga Category:2009 anime OVAs Category:2011 anime television series Category:Anime and manga based on light novels Category:ASCII Media Works manga Category:Kadokawa Dwango franchises Category:Dengeki Bunko Category:Dengeki Comics Category:Dengeki Daioh Category:Funimation Category:Geneon USA Category:Japan-exclusive video games Category:J.C.Staff Category:Light novels Category:Mainichi Broadcasting System original programming Category:NBCUniversal Entertainment Japan Category:Nintendo DS games Category:Odex Category:PlayStation 2 games Category:School life in anime and manga Category:Films with screenplays by Yasuko Kobayashi Category:Seinen manga Category:Shōnen manga Category:Television shows based on light novels Category:Tokyo MX original programming Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Visual novels Category:Viz Media manga Category:Viz Media novels ","title":"Shakugan no Shana"},{"id":"2548839","text":"The Ute Wars were a series of conflicts between the Ute people and the United States which began in 1849 and ended in 1923.Decker, 190-193 ==Wars== *Jicarilla War (1849-1855) *Battle at Fort Utah (1850) *Walker War (1853-1854) *Tintic War (1856) *Black Hawk War (1865-1872) *White River War (1879) * Pinhook Massacre (June 15, 1881) - started when renegade Paiute Indians killed a number of ranchers and stole horses in Colorado.

As the Paiutes moved north, the posse broke into two parts, a small group to follow them and the greater number to take a route around them and meet them from the front. A running battle between the Indians and the smaller posse seemed to indicate the plan was working as the Paiutes kept ahead of them.

When Zengi, the atabeg of Aleppo, besieged Damascus in 1135, Mu'in ad-Din was at the head of army defending the city. That year the Burid Shihab ad-Din Mahmud took control of Damascus after the assassination of his brother; when Zengi gave up the siege and instead besieged Homs, Shihab ad-Din sent Yusuf ibn Firuz and Mu'in ad-Din to govern it, with Yusuf acting as Mu'in ad- Din's lieutenant. In 1137 Mu'in ad-Din was still governor of Homs when the city was briefly besieged again by Zengi. In 1138, Shihab ad-Din appointed Mu'in ad-Din atabeg of Damascus and gave him the title Isfahsaller. Later in 1138, Zengi negotiated a marriage between himself and Shihab ad-Din's mother Khatun Safwat al-Mulk, and as part of the settlement Zengi received Homs. Mu'in ad-Din was given the castle of Barin in place of Homs. On June 22, 1139, Shihab ad-Din was assassinated in Damascus; Jamal ad-Din, emir of Baalbek, was chosen as his successor, and Mu'in ad-Din was chosen to govern Baalbek in his absence. He was in charge of the defenses of Baalbek when Zengi arrived to avenge the murder of his stepson. Zengi besieged it with 14 catapults and the city surrendered to him. ==Governor of Damascus== In 1140 Jamal ad-Din died, and Mu'in ad-Din continued to rule as regent for Jamal ad-Din's son Mujir ad- Din. That year, Mu'in ad-Din besieged Banias with help from King Fulk of Jerusalem and Prince Raymond of Antioch; Mu'in ad-Din offered 20 000 pieces of gold per month to pay for their expenses. When it was captured, Mu'in ad-Din handed it over to Fulk and returned to Damascus. A more thorough alliance, to protect Damascus against Zengi, was negotiated during a visit by Mu'in ad-Din to Jerusalem, accompanied by the future chronicler Usamah ibn Munqidh. King Fulk died in 1143, and Zengi was assassinated in 1146. Zengi was succeeded by his sons Saif ad-Din Ghazi I in Mosul and Nur ad-Din in Aleppo, and Mu'in ad- Din took the opportunity to besiege Baalbek; the governor, Najm ad-Din Ayyub, father of Saladin, quickly surrendered to him. Mu'in ad-Din also asserted control over Homs and Hama, and sent Yarankash, the assassin of Zengi, to Nur ad-Din, after Yarankash sought refuge in Damascus. Mu'in ad-Din was always suspicious of Nur ad-Din's power, but it was his policy to remain on friendly terms with his neighbours wherever possible, whether they were Christian or Muslim. In 1147 Nur ad-Din and Mu'in ad-Din negotiated an alliance, in which Nur ad-Din married Mu'in ad-Din's daughter Ismat ad-Din Khatun. Having established peace with Aleppo, Mu'in ad-Din set out to besiege Salkhad and Bosra, after their governor, Altuntash, allied with Jerusalem against him. This broke Jerusalem's treaty with Damascus, forcing Mu'in ad-Din to turn to Nur ad-Din for assistance. Nur ad-Din arrived with the army of Aleppo, and the crusaders were forced to withdraw; both Bosra and Sarkhad then surrendered to Mu'in ad-Din. In August 1147 Mu'in ad-Din was formally recognized as governor of Damascus by the Caliph of Baghdad Al-Muqtafi and the Seljuk Sultan Mas'ud, and he was also recognized formally by the Fatimid Caliph in Egypt, al-Hafiz. ==Second Crusade== In 1148 news reached Damascus of a new crusade, called in response to Zengi's capture of Edessa in 1145. Mu'in ad-Din prepared for the inevitable siege, although he had hoped his former alliance with Jerusalem could be restored and that the crusade would attack some other city. When the crusaders arrived in July, according to Ibn al-Qalanisi, Mu'in ad-Din \\"distinguished himself in combat with them, and displayed a valour, steadfastness and gallantry such as was never seen in any other, never wearying in repelling them nor taking respite from the struggle against them.\\" Mu'in ad-Din reluctantly sent for help from Nur ad-Din and Saif-ad Din Ghazi, whose power he did not wish to see extend as far south as Damascus, and the crusaders besieged the city for only four days before withdrawing. It is possible that Mu'in ad-Din had bribed the crusaders to leave before Nur ad-Din arrived. After this success, the three emirs besieged the castle of Araima in the County of Tripoli, but Mu'in ad-Din was forced to acknowledge Nur ad-Din as his overlord. In 1149 Mu'in ad-Din led raids against crusader territory, in response to their raids against the territory of Damascus which they continued to make after the failure of their siege. He agreed to a two-year truce with King Baldwin III, and then joined with Nur ad-Din against the Principality of Antioch. Mu’in ad-Din patrolled the Hauran with his army while Nur ad-Din defeated Antioch at the Battle of Inab that year, in which Prince Raymond was killed. ==Death== After returning to Damascus in July 1149, Mu'in ad-Din \\"ate a hearty meal, as was his usual custom, and was seized thereafter by a loosening of the bowels...From this resulted in the disease known as dysentery...\\" The emir died on August 28 and was buried in the university he had established in the city. As he had been acting as regent for Mujir ad-Din, the latter took his place as the rightful heir of Damascus. Mujir ad-Din was a weak ruler, however, and by 1154 Nur ad-Din was fully in control of the city and all of Syria. Mu'in ad-Din had three daughters, who married Nur ad-Din, Mujir ad-Din, and a soldier named Margar respectively. In addition to Ibn al- Qalanisi's favourable depiction of him, the Christian chronicler William of Tyre also speaks very highly of Mu'in ad-Din: he showed \\"sincere fidelity\\" in his negotiations with the Kingdom of Jerusalem, and was \\"a man of much wisdom and a lover of our people.\\" William of Tyre rendered his names in Latin as Meheneddin for Mu'in ad-Din and Anardus for Unur. ==Sources== *Steven Runciman, A History of the Crusades, vol.

The state highway runs from MD 175 in Odenton north to MD 2 in Brooklyn Park. MD 170 connects the western Anne Arundel County communities of Odenton and Severn and the North County communities of Linthicum, Pumphrey, and Brooklyn Park with Baltimore/Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport (BWI Airport). The highway connects BWI Airport with Interstate 695 (I-695) and MD 100 and forms part of the Airport Loop, a circumferential highway that connects the airport and I-195 with many airport-related services. MD 170 originally served as the main highway between Baltimore and Fort George G. Meade. This highway, which included part of modern MD 174 west of Severn, was mostly constructed shortly after Camp Meade was established during World War I in the late 1910s. The Odenton-Severn portion of MD 170 was originally built as MD 554 in the 1930s, but became part of MD 170 in the mid-1940s. MD 170 went through another round of upgrades in the early 1940s due to its strategic importance during World War II. The highway originally passed through the area now occupied by BWI Airport. MD 170 was relocated north of MD 176 in the late 1940s during the construction of the airport and south of MD 176 in the late 1950s. The highway has been expanded to four lanes around its interchanges with I-195, I-695, MD 32, and MD 100 and along the perimeter of BWI Airport since the 1960s. ==Route description== MD 170 begins at an intersection with MD 175 (Annapolis Road) in Odenton. The highway continues south as county- maintained Piney Orchard Parkway, which leads to the Odenton station on MARC's Penn Line and the Piney Orchard community. MD 170 heads north on Telegraph Road, which begins as a four-lane divided highway but reduces to a two-lane undivided road and passes through an industrial area. The state highway expands to a four-lane divided highway again shortly before its diamond interchange with MD 32 (Patuxent Freeway). MD 170 continues north as a two- lane road with a center left-turn lane that crosses Severn Run. The center turn lane ends as the highway approaches the center of Severn. There, the highway intersects MD 174, which heads west as Reece Road and east as Donaldson Avenue. MD 170 expands to a four-lane divided highway as it approaches its single-point urban interchange with MD 100 (Paul T. Pitcher Memorial Highway). The highway becomes an undivided four-lane road between MD 100 and its intersection with MD 176 (Dorsey Road) at Harmans. The long ramp from westbound MD 176 to northbound MD 100 is unsigned MD 170A. MD 170 continues north as Aviation Boulevard and joins the Airport Loop. The highway parallels the Amtrak's Northeast Corridor, which carries MARC's Penn Line, and the hiker-biker BWI Trail. MD 170 meets the eastern end of Stoney Run Road, which heads east and immediately loops back west and crosses over the state highway and the railroad on its way to the BWI Car Rental Facility. The highway intersects unsigned MD 995 (Amtrak Way), which leads to the BWI Rail Station serving Amtrak and MARC trains, as it gradually curves to the east. MD 170 crosses Kitten Branch immediately before its partial cloverleaf interchange with the eastern terminus of I-195 and the northern terminus of MD 995A (Metropolitan Boulevard). The highway passes under the BWI Trail and expands to a divided highway before its intersection with Terminal Road and an at-grade intersection with MTA Maryland's Baltimore Light RailLink. Access to the rail line's BWI Business District station is via Elkridge Landing Road at the next intersection. MD 170 leaves the Airport Loop at its intersection with MD 162 (Aviation Boulevard), where the highway turns north onto Camp Meade Road. View south from the north end of MD 170 at MD 2 in Brooklyn Park MD 170 intersects the Baltimore Light Rail again and begins to parallel it as a two- lane road with a center turn lane. The light rail veers away to the east shortly before the highway's intersection with MD 762 (Andover Road), where the center turn lane ends. MD 170 enters Linthicum and intersects the light rail line a third time and begins to parallel it again shortly before the Linthicum station in the center of the community. The highway intersects MD 169 (Maple Road) and expands to a four-lane divided highway shortly before its partial cloverleaf interchange with I-695 (Baltimore Beltway). There is no access from MD 170 to eastbound I-695 or from westbound I-695 to MD 170. The highway reduces to a two-lane road again and passes the North Linthicum station just south of MD 648 (Baltimore-Annapolis Boulevard) in the center of Pumphrey. MD 170 continues northeast as Belle Grove Road, which veers away from the light rail line. The highway parallels the Patapsco River and passes under I-895 Spur (Harbor Tunnel Thruway) before entering Brooklyn Park. There, MD 170 reaches its northern terminus at a five-way intersection with MD 2, Jack Street, and Hanover Street at the Baltimore city limits. MD 2 heads south as Governor Ritchie Highway toward Glen Burnie and north into the city as Potee Street. MD 170 is a part of the National Highway System from its southern terminus in Odenton to I-695 in Linthicum. Within that stretch, there are two sections that serve as intermodal passenger transport links: from its southern terminus to MD 32 in Odenton, and from MD 176 to MD 162 along the perimeter of BWI Airport. The portions from MD 32 in Odenton to MD 176 in Severn and from MD 162 to I-695 within Linthicum are National Highway System principal arterials. ==History== When the Maryland State Roads Commission applied numbers to state highways, they assigned MD 170 to its current corridor from Severn to Brooklyn Park and to what is now MD 174 from Severn to Fort Meade. The portion of the modern highway from Odenton to Severn was originally MD 554. Much of what was to become MD 170 was constructed along the Old Annapolis Road between Pumphrey and Severn. A portion of this road ran through the hamlet of Wellham Crossroads in the middle of what is now BWI Airport. The highway was paved in macadam from the Baltimore-Annapolis Boulevard in Pumphrey to Hammonds Ferry Road in Linthicum by 1910. A second section of improved highway was planned by 1910 from Linthicum south to Wellham Crossroads. A section of highway from the current MD 170-MD 174 intersection in Severn west to the Pennsylvania Railroad (now Amtrak's Northeast Corridor) was built as a concrete road by 1915. Construction on the highway from Severn to Linthicum became a high priority with the United States' entrance into World War I; the remainder of the Severn-Linthicum highway and the highway from the railroad at Severn southwest to newly established Camp Meade, now collectively called the Camp Meade Road, were paved in concrete between 1916 and 1919. Belle Grove Road from Pumphrey to Brooklyn Park was also paved in concrete in this period of time. A poorly constructed portion of the Camp Meade Road between Wellham Crossroads and Dorsey Road was repaved with asphalt in 1919. MD 170 was relocated at the railroad crossing when the highway's overpass of the Pennsylvania Railroad was completed in 1931. The old road, which is now Severn Station Road west of the tracks and Old Camp Meade Road to the east, became MD 483. MD 170 southbound past MD 648 in Pumphrey Telegraph Road from Severn to Odenton was built as a concrete road in three sections. The highway was constructed from the right- angle turn in the Camp Meade Road in Severn south to Evergreen Road in 1932 and 1933. Another section of MD 554 was completed from Odenton Road (then MD 180 and later MD 677) in Odenton to a point north of Old Mill Road in 1936. The gap in MD 554 was filled in or shortly after 1940. MD 170 was widened to from Brooklyn Park to Pumphrey in 1940. With the outbreak of World War II, MD 170 was designated a road of strategic importance to connect Baltimore with Fort Meade; the highway was reconstructed as a asphalt-surfaced concrete road in 1942. By 1946, MD 170 and MD 554 had swapped numbers, with the former now the road from Severn to Odenton. MD 170 was relocated as a road from MD 176 north to what is now the MD 170-MD 162 junction in 1947 and 1948 to make way for the construction of Friendship International Airport. The highway's interchange with the Friendship International Airport Access Road, which was designated MD 46 and later became I-195, was started in 1950, the same year the airport opened, and completed in 1954. South of the airport, MD 170 ran concurrently with MD 176 from the current MD 176-MD 652 intersection west to current MD 170A, which the highway used to connect with the modern alignment of MD 170. The stub of MD 170 north from MD 176 to Friendship Cemetery on the airport reservation became MD 652. MD 170 assumed its present alignment west of MD 170A when the highway was relocated from MD 176 south to the site of the MD 100 interchange as the first carriageway of an ultimate divided highway between 1958 and 1960. The old alignment became much of current MD 652 and the portion of MD 652 north of MD 176 was transferred to county maintenance. When the expressway spur between MD 168 and U.S. Route 301 (now MD 648) was built between 1951 and 1954, the expressway, which became part of the Baltimore Beltway, included an at-grade intersection with MD 170 between Linthicum and Pumphrey. This junction was replaced with the present interchange in 1967; MD 170 was expanded to a divided highway on either side of the interchange in 1968. MD 170's grade separation with Stoney Run Road on the west side of the airport was built in 1982. The state highway was expanded to a four-lane divided highway from north of I-195 to MD 162 when the adjacent east-west portion of MD 162 was built in 1988. MD 170 was expanded to a four-lane divided highway through its interchange with MD 100 when the single-point urban interchange was built in 1995. MD 170 had been expanded to four lanes through its interchange with MD 32 and from MD 176 through the I-195 interchange, and had its southern terminus rolled back from MD 677 to MD 175, by 1999. ==Junction list== ==Auxiliary route== MD 170A is the designation for the one-way ramp from westbound MD 176 to northbound MD 170 southwest of BWI Airport. The ramp is included in the clockwise direction of the Airport Loop and has a spur near its southern end. MD 170A, which has the official designation of MD 170 Spur, was assigned by 1999. ==See also== * ==References== ==External links== *MDRoads: MD 170 170 Category:Roads in Anne Arundel County, Maryland ","title":"Maryland Route 170"},{"id":"2548897","text":"Stuart A.

They sold the business to a company in Spain in 1971, and Weitzman continued to design shoes for the company. In 1994, he bought back the business, but he continues to manufacture his shoe designs in Spain. Weitzman is known for providing one-of- a-kind, \\"million dollar\\" shoes to an Oscar nominee to wear at the Academy Awards, including a pair of platinum sandals adorned with 464 diamonds that actress Laura Harring wore to the 2002 ceremony. For the 2007 Oscars, shoes were designed for and provided to Diablo Cody, who subsequently declined to wear them, stating that she was not aware of nor interested in the publicity attendant with wearing the shoes. Weitzman uses unique materials including cork, vinyl, lucite, wallpaper, and 24-karat gold. His shoes are sold in over 70 countries. The eponymous company that Weitzman founded has changed hands a number of times.

Lambie made over 200 appearances for Falkirk and also had a successful time with St Johnstone. After retiring as a player, Lambie had four spells as manager of Partick Thistle. In his third spell, he guided them to consecutive promotions and entry to the Scottish Premier League in 2002, while also leading them to the semi-finals of the Scottish Cup in the same year. He also had spells as manager of Hamilton Academical (twice, winning the First Division in 1986) and Falkirk. Lambie was known for his eccentricity, cigar smoking and fondness for pigeons. An occasion when he instructed for a concussed player to be told he was Pelé and sent back onto the pitch is one of the most famous quotes in British football. == Playing career == Born in Whitburn, Lambie played for his hometown junior team Whitburn before signing for Falkirk in 1958, where he turned professional and switched position from inside forward to full back. In August 1969 he joined St Johnstone, where he played in the October 1969 Scottish League Cup Final (1–0 loss to Celtic) and took part in the Perth-based club's first European campaign (reaching the third round of the 1971–72 UEFA Cup). == Coaching career == After retiring as a player in 1974, Lambie joined the St Johnstone coaching staff, and later moved to Hibernian. He became assistant manager at Hamilton Academical to his former Hibs colleague Bertie Auld, and succeeded him as manager in 1984. He led the Accies to the First Division title in 1985–86 and won away at Rangers in the next season's Scottish Cup. === Partick Thistle === In 1988, Lambie was appointed manager for the first time at Partick Thistle, but a year later returned to Hamilton, before going back to Partick in 1990. He led the Jags to promotion to the top flight in 1992. Lambie subsequently kept Thistle, in the top flight for a following three seasons, and qualifying for the 1995 UEFA Intertoto Cup, the first time The Jags had been in European Competition since, the 1970s. Lambie, however, left in 1995 for his former club Falkirk, but quit his post in March 1996. The Herald wrote in 2002 that \\"It is odd how, despite Lambie playing over 200 games for Falkirk, and scoring a decent haul of goals as a defender, he is only remembered for his disastrous managerial reign\\". Lambie returned for a third spell at Partick in 1999, with the club now in the third tier, the club had only just managed to save its existence through the Save the Jags campaign, run by the Thistle fans to save their club, which also attracted support from fans across Scottish Football, on an incredibly low budget, following a brush with potential liquidation, Lambie got them into the Scottish Premier League in 2002 via back-to-back promotions, having rebuilt the team, by signing the likes of Stephen Craigan, Martin Hardie and Danny Lennon, as well as bringing on the youth players, such as Alan Archibald and Kenny Arthur Also in 2002, he guided the club to the Scottish Cup semi- finals, where they lost 3–0 to Rangers at Hampden Park. The final stages of the season were chronicled in the BBC Scotland fly on the wall documentary Grasping the Thistle, known for Lambie's use of profanity. In January 2003, Lambie announced that he would retire at the end of the season as he did not agree with new regulations in football; he had attempted to sign Nathan Lowndes and Steven Ferguson on loan from English clubs but was barred by FIFA as they had both recently played in Scotland for other teams. On 17 May 2003 he made his farewell in his last game at Firhill Stadium, a 1–0 loss to Dundee United, having already guaranteed survival in the SPL on a considerably lower budget than their competitors. He became a member of the club's board. In 2004, Lambie returned as manager for a fourth spell, this time as Caretaker, briefly around the end of 2004 and beginning of 2005, in a bid to help the team's struggles on the pitch under the new management foil of Derek Whyte and Gerry Britton, who were later dismissed from their roles, as Dick Campbell took over reign at Firhill. Lambie is remembered for his reaction when Partick player Colin McGlashan suffered a concussion; he ordered his assistant Gerry Collins to \\"Tell him he's Pelé and get him back on\\". A book of football quotes titled Tell Him He's Pelé was released in 2010. He is also remembered for taming Chic Charnley, a player sent off 17 times in his career, whom he signed once for Hamilton and three times for Partick. In 2018, Partick Thistle, renamed the old North Stand at Firhill, after Lambie, which was unofficially opened in April 2018, after a 2-1 win at Firhill over Lambie's former club Hamilton Academical, a result, which Thistle manager Alan Archibald and veteran striker Kris Doolan, who equalised for the Jags in the match, dedicated to the late Mr Lambie. == Personal life and death == Lambie was known for his love of pigeon racing and cigars. He spoke of the importance of his Christian faith in his life. He was a member and activist for the Scottish National Party but said that he was not a suitable candidate to seek elected office. He was awarded the position of Honorary Vice President of Partick Thistle F.C. in August 2006.John Lambie appointed as Honorary Vice President , Partick Thistle F.C. official website, 14 August 2006.

Originally, Psyclon Nine's music was Terror EBM with melancholic Darkwave/Gothic atmospheres and Black Metal style vocals. However, the band has since evolved a more industrial/black metal sound. Psyclon Nine's main music contributor is lead vocalist, lyricist, multi-instrumentalist, and producer Nero Bellum, who is the only remaining original member. In 2009, Psyclon Nine's fourth album We the Fallen was the band's first and only album to appear on the Billboard Charts. ==History== ===Early days (1999–2003)=== Psyclon Nine began in 1999 when roommates, Marshall Goppert and Josef Heresy created an industrial metal music project called \\"Defkon Sodomy\\", influenced by bands like KMFDM and Ministry. The band only performed under that name twice before changing it to Psyclon Nine. The name was a malapropism of Zyklon B, the trade name of hydrogen cyanide used in the gas chambers during the Holocaust. The “Nine” was used because of the number's significance in Aleister Crowley’s numerological writings. Around this time, Marshall and Josef took on their stage names as Josef Heresy, and Nero Bellum. Nero's name was taken from the Roman emperor, and Bellum is Latin for war. ===Divine Infekt (2003–2004)=== Bellum met with European NoiTekk record label executive Marco Gruhn at a San Francisco Grendel show, and persuaded him to sign Psyclon Nine. The band's first album Divine Infekt was recorded shortly thereafter, produced and engineered by Da5id Din of Informatik. The title track was remixed by Tactical Sekt and the album was released on September 15th, 2003. Psyclon Nine toured lightly on the west coast in the United States and in Europe. They supported acts such as Dismantled, Nocturne, and Martin Atkins. Bellum later said in an interview for Vampirefreaks about the Divine Infect remix, \\"Tactical Sekt's remix left a bad taste in my mouth\\", and attributed that to Anthony Mathers of Tactical Sekt in which his philosophical beliefs made him not want to collaborate with anyone outside of Psyclon Nine again. ===I.N.R.I. (2004–2005)=== In 2004, Psyclon Nine signed with the American industrial record label Metropolis and returned to Da5id Din's studio for mixing. INRI was released on April 26, 2005 on both Metropolis and NoiTekk Records. The album featured thirteen tracks of dark, aggressive electro focused on religious themes. The album also featured a cover of the Ministry song “You Know What You Are.” In 2005, Nero Bellum met Rotny Ford of the industrial metal band Nocturne on the social networking site LiveJournal. The two discussed musical ideas which led to the band using guitars and drums in their live performances. Ford joined the band on keyboard and guitar. Psyclon Nine made several major live appearances following the album's release, including several dates opening for Mindless Self Indulgence. The tour gained the band a fan base. Psyclon Nine returned to Europe for another tour that included a spot on the world's largest Gothic festival, Wave-Gotik-Treffen. It was around this time when drummer Abby Nex, who was also from Nocturne, joined the band as a live drummer. ===Crwn Thy Frnicatr (2005–2008)=== At the end of 2005, the band had dropped from their European label NoiTekk and Eric Gottesman quit the band. Gottesman was replaced by members of the industrial rock band Columbine: keyboardist VII and bassist Daniel Columbine. With the release of Crwn Thy Frnicatr in 2006, Psyclon Nine began to stray from their early aggrotech sound into a darker black metal / industrial metal approach. In late 2006, the band was featured on the cover of the German Gothic magazine Orkus. Psyclon Nine went on their first headlining US tour, which eventually led to creative differences between the band and Columbine bassist Daniel. Daniel decided to leave the band at the end of the tour. Abbey Nex replaced him on bass, and Mushroomhead drummer Daniel Fox was used as a live fill-in drummer. In early 2007, the band opened for Mushroomhead's 'Savor Sorrow' North American tour which gained the band huge attention among the underground extreme metal / industrial dance scene. In May 2007, Psyclon Nine did a European tour that included a spot again at Wave Gotik Treffen. After the European tour, Rotny Ford decided to leave the band for personal reasons. In October, the band opened for Mushroomhead again on their second North American tour with Josef on guitar and keys, Abbey on bass, VII on synth, and Daniel on drums. In early 2008, the band released its first music video of the fan favorite track 'Parasitic' directed by Mushroomhead's Richard Thomas. After the tour with Mushroomhead, Josef Heresy decided to leave the band to go back to college, and VII left to return to his band Columbine. Daniel Fox continued with Mushroomhead. At this time, Nero Bellum decided to move to Los Angeles, California, to begin writing a new album. ===We the Fallen and first hiatus (2008–2010)=== Nero Bellum appeared on the internet channel NoisescapeTV in 2008 and said that he was in the studio working on an album entitled We the Fallen, and has decided to stray away from the harsh EBM music style and incorporate a more black metal meets dark ambient sound. In the fall of 2008, Nero's mother committed suicide which delayed the album for several months. In early 2009, a MySpace blog Q&A; video announced that Rotny Ford had rejoined the band, after reconciling at the funeral for Nero's mother. Nero and Rotny began the recording process for We the Fallen that included several guest spots including Brandan Schieppati from Bleeding Through, Gary Zon of Dismantled, Jamison Boaz of Epsilon Zero, and Johan van Roy of Suicide Commando. The album was produced by Jason Miller of Godhead and was released on September 9, 2009. It reached the top Billboard 500 sales and was sold in every Hot Topic store in the United States, which gave the band huge exposure across the nation. In late 2009, Psyclon Nine embarked on a co-headlined tour with Imperative Reaction. Jon Siren of Mankind is Obsolete became the band's new full-time drummer, and Vlixx Vaden of HellTrash was on synth. The tour was very hard on Nero, and at the end of the tour Nero and his then girlfriend separated. On October 31, 2011, Psyclon Nine played their first show in over two years in New York City. Psyclon Nine played a few off dates together in 2012. In 2011, Nero Bellum went on tour with Dismantled as a live guitarist supporting their album The War Inside Me. He joined Dismantled again in 2012 for another tour of the United States with Accessory and Cyanide Regime as support. In mid 2013, Nero Bellum recorded guest vocals on extreme metal / aggrotech band Dawn of Ashes's new album, Anathema, and was featured in their music video for \\"Poisoning the Steps of Babel\\". In late 2013, Nero Bellum, Eric Gottesman, and Jon Heresy (the original members) played a one night show in San Francisco at the DNA Lounge, a venue that the band frequently performed at when first getting started. They played their first album Divine Infekt in its entirety for the album's 10 year anniversary. Around the same time, Nero Bellum announced on Psyclon Nine's Facebook page that the band's new album would be titled Order of the Shadow: Act 1, and would be released in November 2013 with the help of the band's Bandcamp website page that allowed fans to donate to help raise funds for the album's production. In return, fans would receive different sorts of merchandise. Chris Vrenna of Marilyn Manson and Nine Inch Nails helped produce a few tracks on the album. After a long hiatus, Psyclon Nine went on their first US tour in over four years co-headlined with Dawn of Ashes. Both Rotny Ford and Jon Siren returned, along with two musicians who were new to the band. They were Glitch Nix on synth, and Merritt Goodwin, on Bass. On November 12, 2013, Psyclon Nine released Order of the Shadow: Act I through Metropolis Records. The album continued the industrial black metal fusion previously heard on We the Fallen, but was heavily influenced by industrial rock, notably Marilyn Manson's Antichrist Superstar and Nine Inch Nails's The Downward Spiral. In February 2014, the band released a music video for the track 'Use Once and Destroy' on YouTube. On March 11, 2014, Psyclon Nine released a remix album entitled Disorder : The Shadow Sessions. It featured remixes of Order of the Shadow: Act I from Falling Skies, Die Sektor, Alien Vampires, Dismantled, Misfit Toys, Modern Weapons, and Life Cried. ===Second hiatus (2014)=== The band had booked a European tour for May 2014, however the merchandise from Bandcamp was never shipped to the people who donated. This left many fans to believe that Nero had stolen from them once again. After the Bandcamp controversy, Rotny and Jon posted on the official Psyclon Nine Facebook page that both had quit the band due to Nero disappearing again, stating they felt he was irresponsible. Jon left a very apologetic letter to the fans on his personal Facebook page, explaining again how he and Rotny had nothing to do with the Bandcamp donations. On March 30, 2014, Nero Bellum explained on his personal Facebook page that he was in therapy and was unable to send out the Bandcamp orders. Due to Rotny and Jon quitting the band and other misunderstandings, Nero felt it was time to put an end to Psyclon Nine, canceling their European tour. Nero Bellum announced on his personal Facebook page that he wanted to perform one last series of concerts before putting an end to the band. Live band members Dorian Starchild (guitar), Brent Ashley (bass), and Kriz Dk (drums) joined Psyclon Nine for their final performances. A remix for the band Limnus entitled \\"The Devils Are Inside the Walls\\" (Psyclon Nine remix) was released in August 2014, followed by a second hiatus that lasted 8 months. === Reformed live band and Divine Infekt reissue (2015-2017) === On April 13, 2015, Psyclon Nine created a new official Facebook page and announced a live performance at the L.A. Dark United Underground in Los Angeles, CA on May 2, 2015. The reformed lineup featured Nero Bellum (vocals), Dorian Starchild (guitars), Ashes (guitars), and Raanen Bozzio (drums). They went on to do a few more shows (including a show at Bar Sinister in May 2015), resulting in Psyclon Nine returning as a live band. Raanen Bozzio was subsequently replaced by Anthem on electronic drums. During mid to late 2015 and throughout 2016, Psyclon Nine resolved their former Bandcamp and Kickstarter merchandise controversies by partnering with merchandise management company Black Umbrella based in Las Vegas, NV. Psyclon Nine's Bandcamp page was also given a major graphical update in late 2015 and continues to carry older legacy merchandise along with signed albums and new apparel designs for fans to purchase. All merchandise shipments to fans have returned to a normal schedule of being sent out every Saturday. On October 30, 2016, Psyclon Nine performed a special live set featuring songs exclusively from Divine Infekt, INRI and Crwn Thy Frnicatr. They played alongside label mates Dawn of Ashes for the first time in 3 years. Nero Bellum was also brought on stage during Dawn of Ashes' song \\"Poisoning The Steps of Babel\\" to provide vocals during his verse featured on the album. Nero also provided backing vocals during the chorus. On December 22, 2016 via Psyclon Nine's Facebook and Instagram pages, they announced the reissuing of their first album entitled \\"Divine Infekt\\". It has been remastered by Nero Bellum and is being made available in CD format and, for the first time ever, 12\\" Vinyl format. The album will be re-released via Metropolis Records on March 24, 2017. During Spring of 2017, Psyclon Nine embarked on a small West Coast and East Coast tour entitled \\"Infektion Divinum\\". The tour was scheduled in tandem with the re-release of the band's first album \\"Divine Infekt\\". Psyclon Nine kept this tour exclusively \\"electronic\\" based sets in that it was performing songs from the albums \\"Divine Infekt\\", \\"INRI\\" and \\"Crwn Thy Frnicatr\\". This tour also marked the first time the band had ever played in Las Vegas, NV. Support acts for the tour included The Vile Augury, Lennon Midnight and Echo Black. === Icon of the Adversary: Act 2 (2018-present) === Through mid to late 2017 via Nero Bellum's official Facebook page, he hinted of a new album in the works. In early 2018, the new album was officially confirmed and is entitled \\"Icon of the Adversary: Act 2\\". The band debuted the first new single from the upcoming album called \\"Crown of the Worm\\" during a live performance in Downey, CA on February 24 as well as a teaser via Nero Bellum's official YouTube channel. The new album is tentatively planned for release in August 2018. The band also released a new shirt design via their Bandcamp page based on one of the songs entitled \\"Beware the Wolves\\". In June 2018, via the band's official Facebook page, tour dates for \\"Tour of the Worm\\" were announced. Icon Of The Adversary was released on August 24, 2018 through Metropolis Records.

It was a one-off special spin-off of Australia's Funniest Home Video Show, depicting videos of sexual situations and other sexually explicit content. The programme was notably taken off the air partway through the broadcast of its first and only episode on the order of network owner Kerry Packer. == Background == Australia's Funniest Home Video Show premiered in 1990, and was similar in concept to the 1989 American special (and later series) America's Funniest Home Videos: viewers would send in amateur-shot videos that were unintentionally humorous, and the video deemed the \\"funniest\\" by the studio audience was awarded a prize at the end of the show. The producers often received racy or risqué videos that couldn't be included into the programme due to its family-friendly nature, and since the show's policy stated that videos sent in by viewers couldn't be sent back, videos that didn't make it to the program were still kept by the station. The producers decided to compile these videos into a one-off special aimed at an adult audience. It differed from Australia's Funniest Home Video Show in more than just the content of the videos. It had a different opening, a modified version of the Australia's Funniest Home Video Show's theme song, and a slightly modified set. It was hosted by Australian radio personality Doug Mulray. Due to the difference in content, the show aired at 8:30 PM and was preceded by a short message warning viewers of the show's content, and informing them that it was a one-off special that was different from Australia's Funniest Home Video Show. == Content == A child grabbing a kangaroo's scrotum in one of the videos featured in the special. The show followed the same structure of Australia's Funniest Home Video Show, in which the videos were shown in short blocks, interspersed with humorous monologues written and delivered by Mulray. Mulray often poked fun at the content of the videos, which he described as \\"The most sensational collection of home videos since Rodney King nicked out for a pizza recently.\\" Mulray also did humorous voice overs as the videos were shown, similar to Lisa Patrick's on Australia's Funniest Home Video Show. The content of the videos included shots of animal genitalia, humans or animals humorously engaging in sexual intercourse, people who get accidentally and humorously disrobed, and other situations that often relied on ribald humour, including a child grabbing a kangaroo's testicles, a man lifting a barbell with his penis, a man getting his head squeezed between an erotic dancer's large breasts, an elderly woman removing an envelope from a stripper's undergarments with her dentures, two people running into water with flaming pieces of toilet paper hanging from their buttocks, and two people filmed having sex in the middle of a park. == Cancellation == Kerry Packer, the owner of the Nine Network at the time, was informed of the show's content by friends while having dinner. He tuned in to watch the show, which was being transmitted on TCN-9, and was so offended by its content that he phoned the studio operators and angrily shouted, \\"Get that shit off the air!\\" Within minutes, the series was pulled. After the break, the Nine Network announced that it failed to continue airing the show, purportedly due to technical difficulties, and aired reruns of the American sitcom Cheers immediately afterwards to fill in the remaining airtime. In 2008, Bert Newton justified the broadcast explanation: \\"It's technically very difficult to keep a show on air with Mr. Packer on the phone, yelling at you.\\" Although the same bumper and announcement interrupted the show during every broadcast across Australia, it occurred in different parts of the programme depending on the area it was airing in, due to time differences: In the eastern states, the station simply started airing an episode of Cheers after a scheduled commercial break, but in other areas, the last part of the show broadcast was of Mulray giving a monologue about \\"bosoms\\" or the aforementioned clip of a child grabbing a kangaroo's scrotum. The show was cancelled before it was scheduled to air in Perth, and thus its Nine Network affiliate showed a brief message mentioning that the special wouldn't be aired before beginning an episode of Cheers. Despite Packer's objections to the series' content, it was popular among viewers. The special was recorded to a record studio audience. After the announcement, Nine reportedly received \\"thousands\\" of phone calls from viewers, with 65 percent of callers upset with the programme being pulled, in contrast to the 60 callers who called in during the show's broadcast, complaining about the show. Viewers were generally bewildered by the sudden interruption and the cut to Cheers, not knowing about the show's cancellation until it was widely reported by the Australian media outlets the next day. The day after the special aired, a furious Packer showed up at Nine's headquarters and held meetings in which he loudly berated Nine's managers and censors, referring to the program as \\"disgusting and offensive shit.\\" After these meetings, Mulray and many of the staff who were involved with the creation of the special were fired, with Mulray being banned for life from Channel Nine. Kris Noble, the network's drama and entertainment chief hid the original tape in the archives of the network's Willoughby studio. On his radio show the next day, Mulray commented, \\"I am the first man in Australian history to be pulled off by Kerry Packer.\\" Mulray returned to Nine to be a judge on the 2005 series StarStruck shortly after Packer's death on 26 December of that year. == Rebroadcast == In 2008, the original tape of the show hidden by Noble was located by Nine's head of factual television. It was aired in its entirety at 8:30 PM on 28 August 2008, one week short of sixteen years after the original special, and at the same time. Promoted as \\"the show Kerry Packer didn't want you to see\\", it featured commentary from Bert Newton; Packer had died in December 2005, and Mulray refused Nine's request to host the special. The special was interrupted by the Channel Nine bumper and \\"technical difficulties\\" announcement 36 minutes in, cutting to the Cheers opening credits before resuming to a monologue by Newton, who referenced the incident by saying \\"The stated reason was 'technical difficulties' which was accurate... since it is TECHNICALLY very DIFFICULT to keep a show on air...with Mr. Packer on the phone YELLING at you!\\" The latter part of the special that never aired was then broadcast. The re-airing was censored, with portions of Mulray's monologues (including jibes about \\"fat kids\\") being cut from the special as they were deemed to be \\"no longer acceptable\\". == See also == * Turn-On, an American TV series that was also pulled from broadcast during its first and only episode. * Videos After Dark, an American adaptation of the concept that debuted in 2019 and likewise was canceled after only one airing. == References == Category:Nine Network original programming Category:1992 Australian television series debuts Category:1992 Australian television series endings Category:Australian comedy television series Category:Television shows set in Sydney Category:Television controversies in Australia Category:Video clip television series Category:English-language television shows Category:Parody television series Category:Television series canceled after one episode ","title":"Australia's Naughtiest Home Videos"},{"id":"2548936","text":"The Rick and Bubba Show is an American comedy radio show based in Birmingham, Alabama.

In 2010, he was given the Hamilton King Award, which is considered to be one of the most prestigious awards in illustration. His highly detailed work is described as containing a rich language of symbols and archetypes, which are left open to interpretation by the viewer. == Early Life == Palencar was born in Fairview Park, Ohio. He developed an interest in the subject matter of horror and science fiction early in life; dressing up as an alien with a homemade custom latex masks and exhibiting a fascination in both scaring others and being scared himself. In the third grade, his family would move to Middleburg Heights, Ohio.He would win his first award in art in fifth grade with a three- colour block print for the Cleveland’s Plain Dealer newspaper calendar contest. He went on to attended Midpark High School. It was in high school that the artist came under the art training of Frederick C. Graff, who up until today is a established award winning artist, primarily in watercolor. After winning numerous art awards and selling a few paintings in high school, Palencar decided to pursue a career in art. He attended the Columbus College of Art and Design (CCAD) on scholarship, receiving a BFA degree in 1980. During his college years he worked for the American Greetings Card Company and freelanced, establishing a list of regional and national clients in editorial, advertising and corporate art. As a senior at CCAD he won the top cash award at the Society of Illustrators Student Exhibition and was also presented with a scholarship to the Illustrators Workshop held in Paris, France. == Illustration Career == While still in college at Columbus College of Art and Design, Palencar exhibited work at the Society of Illustrators and the work on display attracted the attention of Byron Preiss. The result would be an early and prominent assignment for the artist in 1982 with the commission to illustrate The Secret, a puzzle book produced by Byron Preiss and published by Bantam Books. The illustrations for the book depict the visual components of 12 puzzles, each of which lead the reader on a treasure hunt. Preiss had hidden ceramic boxes, each redeemable for a jewel, in twelve cities and to date only three of the puzzles have been solved and the jewels recovered. Palencar's first introduction to illustrating for fantasy and speculative fiction came shortly after college when working for Time-Life Books on The Enchanted World Series.. The young artist would contribute to many books in the series, including Legends of Valor(1984), Ghosts(1984) and Night Creatures (1985) His work has since appeared on hundreds of book covers for just about every major publisher in the U.S., and in over thirty countries around the world. The artist has created cover art for such authors as H. P. Lovecraft, Ursula LeGuin, Marion Zimmer Bradley, P.D. James, Charles de Lint, R.L. Stine, Octavia Butler, David Brin and Stephen King. New York Times Best Selling author, Christopher Paolini, a fan of John's work, named the lead character's birthplace \\"Palancar Valley\\", after John in his NY Times Bestseller, Eragon for which John also painted the cover, as well as creating the type treatment that would be used for the remaining three books in the series. Stephen King owns three works by the artist from the Dark Tower series. Palancar has also created editorial illustrations for Time Magazine, Smithsonian Magazine, National Geographic, and Nat. Geo. Television as well as worked on entertainment projects for Lucas Arts, Paramount Pictures, and Vivendi Universal. In 2004, Palencar became the Artist in Residence at the Cill Rialaig Arts Centre, in County Kerry Ireland. In 2007, Underwood Books would publish Origins:The Art of John Jude Palencar, a 128 page tribute to the artists work up until that time with a foreword by Christopher Paolini In 2008, Palencar was awarded the Spectrum Award for Grand Master, which is an annual award presented to an artist who has worked for at least twenty years at a consistently high level of quality and has left his or her mark on the field of contemporary science fiction, fantasy and horror artwork. In 2012, Tor Books editor David Hartwell was passing by the Tor art department and noticed a painting by Palancar leaning against the wall, Hartwell asked art director Irene Gallo what the painting was for and was told that the work had no specific commission. Hartwell used the work to initiate The Palencar Project, in which five writers, L.E. Modesitt, Jr, Gene Wolf, Michael Swanwick, Gregory Benford and James Morrow all wrote short stories based on the painting. The same painting would later be used as the cover for The One- Eyed Man by L. E. Modesitt Jr. The George R.R. Martin 2019 A Song of Fire and Ice wall calendar would be illustrated by Palencar. == Working Process == Initial ideas are sketched quickly, to provide an art director with a general idea of how a finished work might appear. Once an approval for an idea is in hand, the artist creates a detailed rendering in pencil with subtle shading on a plate finish board. The final Palencar paintings are executed in acrylic, but in a watercolor fashion, in which initial thin layers are laid down as a wash first. Multiple layers and subtle colors are then woven together and then the artists begins to introduce opaque and semi opaque washes. Working in this manner borrows technical approaches from oil, watercolor and egg tempera mediums. == Personal Life == Palencar lives in Medina Township, Ohio with his wife Lee who is an art teacher at Highland High School in Medina. The couple have two boys, Ian and Kit. Kit, also an artist teaches drawing and painting at the University of Akron. Palencar maintains a personal collection of skulls and articulated skeletons that serve as inspiration and reference for many paintings. == Bibliography == == Exhibitions == Palencar has exhibited in numerous group shows in galleries, colleges and universities throughout the United States. === Solo === *Between Worlds, Canton Museum of Art, 2019 *Images of Ireland, National Museum, Dublin *University of the Arts, Richard C. von Hess Gallery, 2008 === Group === *La Mars Art Center, Exhibition of the American Watercolor Society, 2020 *Society of Illustrators, Masters of The Fantastic, 2019 *Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, Unveiling Visions: The Alchemy of the Black Imagination, curated by John Jennings and Reynaldo Anderson, 2015 *Kosart Studios & Gallery, Maleficium: Dark Art Exhibition, 2015 *Butler Institute of American Art, 2013 *Allentown Art Museum, At the Edge: Art of the Fantastic,curated by Patrick and Jeannie Wilshire, 2012 *Nucleus Gallery, At the Mountains of Madness:A Tribute to the Writings of Lovecraft, 2010 == Awards == *Gold Medal, American Water Color Society, for The Dark Line, 2020 * Gold Medal (Institutional), Spectrum 27, 2020, for The Stranger: The Seventh Faith * Silver Medal (Institutional), Spectrum 26, 2019, for The Nights Watch * Hamilton King Award, Society of Illustrators, 2010, for cover of Muse and Reverie by Charles de Lint *Gold Medal, Society of Illustrators, 2010 * Spectrum Grand Master Award, 2008 * Gold Medal (book), Spectrum Awards 1996, for Blood Debt *Gold Medal (book), Spectrum Awards 1995, for Becoming Human * Chesley Awards Winner 2006, 2001, 2000, 1999, 1995 == References == Category:1957 births Category:Living people Category:American speculative fiction artists Category:People from Fairview Park, Ohio Category:American illustrators Category:20th-century American painters Category:American male painters Category:21st-century American painters Category:Fantasy artists Category:Horror artists Category:Artists from Ohio Category:Science fiction artists Category:Columbus College of Art and Design alumni ","title":"John Jude Palencar"},{"id":"2548940","text":"Belmont was a station in Belmont, north-west London on the Stanmore branch line. It was opened on 12 September 1932 by the London, Midland and Scottish Railway as the only intermediate station on a short branch line (opened in 1890) running north from Harrow & Wealdstone to Stanmore, in anticipation of the Metropolitan Railway opening its own branch line to a new Stanmore station (now served by the Jubilee line) the same year. Belmont station was rebuilt with a central island platform and a passing loop. The rebuilt station opened on 5 July 1937. The station was located on the north side of Kenton Lane to the west of Belmont Circle. From the perspective of the branch line, the connection to the main line was north-facing, i.e. away from central London. Hence the branch line could not take direct commuter services from the city, limiting its operation to a shuttle service. The direct service provided by the Metropolitan offered strong competition to the L&NWR; station at Stanmore and passenger services beyond Belmont were ended on 15 September 1952, though a daily freight train served the goods yard at Stanmore. The passing loop was removed in 1955. The line to Stanmore was closed completely on 6 July 1964, as part of the railway cuts implemented under the Beeching Axe. Passenger services from Belmont to Harrow were withdrawn on 5 October 1964. The track was lifted in 1966 and the station site is now occupied by a car park.

The licensor or seller of a business opportunity usually declares that it will secure or assist the buyer in finding a suitable location or provide the product to the purchaser-licensee. This is different from the sale of an independent business, in which there is no continued relationship required by the seller. Eckhardt and Shane (2003) Eckhardt, J.T. and Shane, S.A., 2003. Opportunities and entrepreneurship. Journal of management, 29(3), pp.333-349. argue that when taking the path of entrepreneurship, one of the most important indictors for future entrepreneurship is the skill of finding the business opportunity. This is seen as the lynchpin around which the promise of entrepreneurial venture is to be built.Shane, S. and Venkataraman, S., 2000. The promise of entrepreneurship as a field of research. Academy of management review, 25(1), pp.217-226. Shane and Venkataraman state that individuals must possess prior knowledge and the cognitive properties necessary to value such knowledge in order to identify the new opportunity. This normally allows a triggering of the opportunity which can then move forward to scoping and validation. Napoleon Hill provided advice on achievement as necessary for success and within anyone's reach; \\"The starting point of all achievement is desire. Keep this constantly in mind. Weak desires bring weak results, just as a small amount of fire makes a small amount of heat.\\" and Winston Churchill suggested similarly with a piece of inspiration; \\"Attitude is a little thing that makes a big difference.\\". == Concept == A common type of business opportunity involves a company that sells bulk vending machines and promises to secure suitable locations for the machines. The purchaser is counting on the company to find locations where sales will be high enough to enable him to recoup his expenses and make a profit. Because of the many cases of fraudulent biz-ops in which companies have not followed through on their promises, or in which profits were much less than what the company led the investor to believe, governments closely regulate these operations. In the United States, the Federal Trade Commission receives complaints and helps coordinate enforcement action against fraudulent business opportunities.What We Do, Federal Trade Commission, retrieved 11 July 2014 == Makeup of a business opportunity == A business opportunity consists of four elements all of which are to be present within the same timeframe (window of opportunity) and most often within the same domain or geographical location, before it can be claimed as a business opportunity.

He was Bangladesh's senior-most diplomat both during the 'Liberation War' period of its Mujibnagar administration as well as in peacetime. A former Carnegie Fellow in International Peace and Rockefeller Foundation Scholar and Research Fellow, he has been described as \\"soft-spoken and scholarly\\" and \\"a lesson for all diplomats\\". Exceptionally for a Bengali-born diplomat, he rose to the most senior ranks of public service in Pakistan. Then at the time Bangladesh began seeking independence, he spectacularly defected and changed sides to support the fledgling country of Bangladesh – a major propaganda coup and morale boost for the cause of Bangladeshi liberation given his stature in Pakistan's hierarchy. Fateh was automatically the highest-ranked and most senior foreign service officer in the new country. His story was later documented in a National Geographic documentary, Running for Freedom. Following his death he was described by a former colleague and successor Foreign Secretary as \\"a great and brave freedom fighter\\" who was at the same time \\"remarkably reticent about his contributions\\", a \\"soft-spoken and scholarly diplomat\\" whose service to the Bangladeshi independence cause at a critical period was \\"invaluable\\" and \\"a lesson for all diplomats. His outstanding professional skill and deep sense of patriotism should be a shining example\\". The Foreign Minister of Bangladesh Dipu Moni talked about his \\"contribution to self-right movements of people, country's independence struggle and managing assistance to war-ravaged country after independence.\\" She also cited his \\"outstanding career\\", stating that he would be \\"always remembered for his contribution to the country's liberation\\" war. Although rarely in the public eye, Fateh was a distinguished figure in the history of post-Second World War, post-colonial diplomacy, a public servant who was a leading light behind the scenes within the Developing World and Non Aligned Conference, including the Commonwealth, with a significant tour of duty in Washington D.C. at the height of the Cold War. In the West too Fateh came to be held in the highest regard, a rare joint U.S.A./U.K. intelligence assessment remarking in 1977 that he was: “very able, highly intelligent, moderate, easy to deal with, and well informed”. At the launch of his university's South Asia Centre in 2015, the President and Director of the London School of Economics Professor Craig Calhoun included Fateh in a list of a dozen public figures of the 20th century who he felt represented \\"the greatest fruits\\" of the \\"close mutual relations between South Asia and the LSE\\". ==Biography== ===Early life and education=== Fateh was born in Kishoreganj on 16 May 1924 in a landowning family, to Abdul Gafur and his second wife Zohra Khatun. Fateh was a middle child, in a large family of a dozen children who survived to adulthood, while two other siblings died young. His father Abdul Gafur had attended Presidency College, Calcutta, and was one of the first Muslim daroga (sheriffs) in the British Raj. Fateh's mother Zohra was the daughter of a local nobleman. Fateh passed his matriculation exams from Ramkrishna High English School in Kishorganj in 1941. After passing his Intermediate exams from Ananda Mohan College in Mymensingh in 1943, he undertook higher studies in English Literature at Dhaka University (BA Honours in 1946 and MA in 1947) where he also excelled in sport, for a time captaining the cricket team and becoming the table tennis champion. ===Pakistani diplomat=== While teaching English Literature at Brindaban College in Sylhet, he took the first Foreign Service exams of Pakistan (1948), before teaching English Literature for a few months at Michael Madhusudhan Datta College in Jessore. He joined the first batch of Pakistan Foreign Service trainees in 1949, moving to Karachi. Soon after he left for training in London, which included taking a special course at the London School of Economics, before he moved in 1950 to Paris to complete his training. Returning briefly to Karachi, he was sent back (1951) to Paris as Third Secretary in the Pakistan Embassy. Abul Fateh (right) with Austrian Foreign Minister Bruno Kreisky, Vienna, 1962A further posting as Third Secretary followed in Calcutta (1953–1956). During this time he married, at Rangpur on 5 January 1956, Mahfuza Banu of Dhubri, Assam daughter of Shahabuddin Ahmed, a respected lawyer and Mashudaa Banu a well known social campaigner. Then promoted to Second Secretary, he served in the Pakistan Embassy in Washington, D.C. from 1956 to 1960, during which time he and his wife had their two sons, one of whom, Aladin, is a strategy consultant, academic, artist and Editor Emeritus of the Bangladeshi news organisation Bdnews24. Fateh was a Director attached to the Foreign Ministry in Karachi from 1960 to 1963, during which time he was founding Director of Pakistan's Foreign Service Academy in Lahore and also went for a year and a half (1962–1963) to Geneva as a Fellow of the Graduate Institute of International Studies (Institut Universitaire de Hautes Etudes Internationales) under a Carnegie fellowship. Further foreign postings followed. He was First Secretary (and latterly acting chief of mission) in Prague from 1965 to 1966, Counsellor in New Delhi from 1966 to 1967, and Deputy High Commissioner in Calcutta from 1968 to 1970. He received his first posting as ambassador, at the Pakistan Embassy in Baghdad, in 1970. ===Bangladeshi independence=== Abul Fateh with family (from left to right; Anatul Fateh, Abul Fateh, Mahfuza Fateh, Eenasul Fateh) in London in 1977 After the Pakistani military crackdown in March 1971, Fateh received a request from a former university dormitory mate, Syed Nazrul Islam, now Acting President in the Bangladesh government-in-exile, to join the liberation struggle. At about the same time, in July 1971, Fateh received a summons from the Pakistan Foreign Ministry to attend a conference in Tehran of regional Pakistani ambassadors. He chose to take his official car ostensibly to drive to Tehran but, as he and his driver approached the Iran–Iraq border, he feigned chest pains and ordered the driver to return him home, where he arrived that evening. Saying that he would take a plane the next day, he dismissed the driver. That night, he fled with his wife and sons across the border into Kuwait, where they were assisted by officials attached to the local Indian Embassy to take a plane to London. The announcement of Fateh's defection to the Bangladesh cause marked the first time a full ambassador had joined the fledgling Bangladesh diplomatic service. The news was received with fury by the military regime in Islamabad, duped by what was later described as a \\"cool and calculated James Bond-type adventure\\" and a calculated plunge into danger. It was a dramatic defection which created sensation in diplomatic circles and greatly boosted the morale of those engaged in the war of liberation. The Yahya Khan military regime in Pakistan was furious and requested the British Government to extradite Fateh from London, but the requests were rebuffed by the British Government. These events were chronicled in a 2003 National Geographic Channel television documentary, Running for Freedom. Abul and Mahfuza Fateh in 1976 The Mujibnagar government made him ambassador-at-large, followed in August 1971 by the concurrent position of Advisor to the Acting President, a position he was to resign in January 1972 after the return to Bangladesh of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. He had a key role managing relations with the United States and India whilst heading the nascent country's diplomatic service. As the senior-most diplomat of the Bangladesh movement in the United Nations delegation under Justice Abu Sayed Choudhury which was in New York in September 1971 to lobby for the Bangladesh cause at the General Assembly, he played a vital role in the delegation's lobbying efforts. He was also in communication with other governments, such as the Nixon administration in the United States and also with Senators, Congressmen, and high officials in the US Administration, World Bank, and IMF; he had the advantage as well of being familiar with decision-makers and the decision-making process having served as a diplomat in Washington 20 years earlier. Former colleague Syed Muazzem Ali described him as a \\"soft-spoken and scholarly diplomat\\" who was exceptional in articulating the cause and whose contributions were invaluable. He was one of the first high officials to reach Dhaka after its liberation, and was quartered with other senior officials in Bangabhaban until January 1972. He was also the highest Bangladeshi official in Dhaka until the acting president and cabinet arrived after independence; on his arrival in Dhaka he was driven under escort from the airport, becoming the first civilian official to lay a wreath at the ruins of the Shaheed Minar, an act planned to mark the first presence of the government in Dhaka. Already the effective head of the incipient foreign service, he became Foreign Secretary at the end of 1971, playing a key role in formulating Bangladesh's foreign policy.The Bangladesh Liberation War, Mujibnagar Government Documents 1971, edited by Sukumar Biswas (Dhaka: Mowla Brothers, 2005) ===Bangladeshi ambassador=== He then took up the position of Bangladesh's first Ambassador in Paris (1972–1976). The early part of this posting involved extensive travel in Africa to persuade African governments to recognise the independence of Bangladesh. In 1973 he represented Bangladesh at a Commonwealth conference for Youth Ministers in Lusaka. In 1975 he went to Morocco and, at a time of a shortage in supply of phosphates, managed to secure a substantial phosphate shipment for Bangladesh. In mid-1975 he was selected to be High Commissioner in the UK, which post he took up in early 1976. His two years in London (1976–1977) saw him Chairing the Commonwealth Conference on Human Ecology and Development and the Bangladesh government approved his recommendation that dual citizenship be permitted. Many people from Bangladesh were settled in the UK, whose remittances into Bangladesh were an important source of foreign exchange. He pointed out that to oblige them to forgo Bangladesh citizenship if they took up the benefits of British nationality was not conducive to the continued maintenance of their ties to the mother country. His last post was as ambassador in Algiers (1977–1982). He represented the Bangladesh government at conferences on Namibia in Algiers of the United Nations (1980) and the Non Aligned Conference (1981). He retired from that post in 1982. Fateh became a casualty of Bangladesh's complex and shifting political landscape towards the end of his career. As he was closely identified with Bangladesh's initial, Liberation War era administration Fateh was not favoured by the military- backed regimes which followed it. Contemporary historians have characterised his Ambassadorial assignment to Algeria as a premature transfer and a virtual exile in a diplomatic post which was a relative back-water. One commentator voicing the widely held belief that Fateh was \\"a victim of conspiracy hatched against him by anti-liberation forces. ===Retirement=== Abul Fateh in 2007, at the age of 83Retiring in 1982, he lived with his wife Mahfuza Fateh in Dhaka for ten years before they settled in London to be near their sons. ===Death and honours at funeral=== Fateh died in London of natural causes at 0745 on 4 December 2010. A Sufi, he once cited a few of the axioms according to which he led his life: \\"Do not speak anything that you do not yourself know to be true.\\" \\"Speak in the spirit of offering, without the need to draw attention to yourself.\\" \\"You should stand up when it matters.\\" Fateh was buried with Bangladesh State Honours at Hendon Cemetery, London on 7 December 2010 The Bangladesh Government was represented by His Excellency the Bangladesh High Commissioner Professor Mohammad Sayeedur Rahman Khan Khan who delivered a homily which spoke of the Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's devastation at the news of Ambassador Fateh's death, conveyed the condolences of Foreign Minister Dipu Moni and spoke of the highest standard of public service that Mr. Fateh's conduct and career represented. In consideration of the esteem of the Bangladesh government and its people for Ambassador Fateh, the High Commissioner had personally brought the flag of Bangladesh to be draped over the coffin so that Mr. Fateh could briefly lie in state before his interring. Justice of the Supreme Court the Right Honorable Syed Refaat Ahmed also spoke at the event about Fateh's humility and self-effacement in all contexts, against the backdrop of an enormous contribution to the public and civic life of the country. A few days later at the Qul Khwani and non-denominational Sufi service on 11 December 2010, Murad Qureshi, Member of the London Assembly at London's City Hall, spoke, reminding those gathered that Fateh father chose to stand and be counted during the 1971 war in quite fraught circumstances. The Sufi Order established by Inayat Khan, whose son Vilayat Inayat Khan was a friend of Abul, arranged a non-denominational Sufi Service. Pir Vilayat Khan's son Pir Zia Khan sent a personal message, which also stated: \\"Abul Fateh Sahib has lived a life of honour and service and is a mystic in spirit\\" All media in Bangladesh carried extensive notices about the death of the country's most distinguished diplomat. ==Honours== *Carnegie Foundation Fellow in International Peace. *Rockefeller Foundation Scholar *Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II's Silver Jubilee Medal, 1975 *Bangladesh Government State Honours at Funeral ==See also== * History of Bangladesh * List of Bangladeshis * British Bangladeshi * List of British Bangladeshis ==References== ==References == * Government of Bangladesh, Ministry of Foreign Affairs: Foreign Secretaries.

It lies in the areas of Harrow and Kenton. ==Route and landmarks== Its eastern end is the border of Kenton in Middlesex and Kingsbury (in NW9) in London. Kenton Road is the A4006, apart from a short stretch west of Northwick Park roundabout, which is a small part of the A404. The road east of the Kenton Methodist Church originally followed the route of what is now Woodgrange Avenue and was a continuation of Kenton Lane before being upgraded, re-positioned and renamed in the early 20th century as an eastward extension of the original Kenton Road. On the north side of the road, almost opposite Kenton station is the Traveller's Rest pub. Approximately further along the A4006, also on the north side of the road, at the junction with St Leonard's Avenue, is the parish church of St Mary-the-Virgin, Kenton, built in 1935-1936 by the architect Harold Gibbons and a local firm of builders, Melsom & Rosier. Approximately further on, on the south side of the Kenton Road is All Saints Catholic Church, built in 1963. About another further on is the Greek Orthodox Church of St Panteleimon. Originally a mission church of the Church of England parish, it was acquired in recent years by the Greek community, which has replaced it with a traditional Greek Basilica complete with bronze dome (2011).

He was familiarly known in the professional comics community as Ray Van Buren. == Biography == Born in Pueblo, Colorado, Van Buren, a distant relative of US President Martin Van Buren, grew up in Kansas City, Missouri. At the Kansas City Star, he learned cartooning from comic strip artist Harry Wood. In 1913, Van Buren moved to New York, where he illustrated for Puck, Life and The Saturday Evening Post.\\"Raeburn Van Buren; Drew Daily Comic Strip\\". The New York Times, January 01, 1988. Van Buren served in the old Seventh Regiment (107th Infantry) of the 27th New York Empire Division in World War I. He was art editor of the division's magazine, Gas Attack. An artistry and illustrative flair were evident in his cartoons, and The New York Times compared his artwork in the magazine with that of the famous British illustrator Bruce Bairnsfather. After military service, he drew cartoons for The Saturday Evening Post, The New Yorker and Esquire. As a freelance illustrator, he contributed to numerous magazines, including Collier's, Redbook and McCall's. He was a founder of the National Society of Magazine Illustrators. ===Abbie an' Slats=== He began drawing Abbie an' Slats in 1937. The strip followed the experiences of a rural spinster raising her young cousin, a streetwise urban child. It was the idea of Al Capp, who intended to start a second strip to build upon the success of his popular Li'l Abner. Instead of drawing it himself, Capp recruited Van Buren. Initially, Van Buren turned him down, but he was soon lured by the prospect of steady work, as he had just had his first and only child with his wife, Fern. The strip was carried in 400 newspapers but did not equal the popularity of Li'l Abner. Capp abandoned the strip in 1945, turning the writing chores over to his brother, Elliot Caplin. Van Buren stayed on the strip, and it ended with his retirement in 1971. === Later life and death === Van Buren lived in Great Neck, Long Island. He died in 1987 at North Shore Community Hospital in Manhasset, Long Island, after suffering an injury in a fall. He was 96 years old. ==Raeburn Van Buren and Abigail Van Buren== In 1984, When Van Buren sent a gift to \\"Dear Abby\\" columnist Abigail Van Buren (Pauline Phillips), she wrote back on November 30, 1984, thanking him and commenting on the name similarity: :Yes, I remember our meeting very well. I also recall that every once in a while we'd get our mail mixed up... I at one time (when I first began, I spelled my name \\"ABBIE\\"... Then it became even more confusing because of the VAN BUREN... remember?) Abbie and Slats... and the Van Buren. I selected my own name... so perhaps it was an unconscious choice, with you in mind all the while. Be well, Darling One... and stay well. And I hope to heaven you're dangerous! ==Awards== Letter to Raeburn van Buren about name confusion (November 30, 1984). With the Gold Key Award, he was honored in 1979 as a member of the National Cartoonists Society Hall of Fame. In 1958, he was named \\"Cartoonist of the Year\\" by the Quaker City Lodge of the B'nai B'rith in ceremonies at Philadelphia Pa. Previous winners were Al Capp, Milton Caniff, and George Wunder.Yesterday's Papers ==Books== Van Buren's wartime experiences are chronicled in the book Duty, Honor, Privilege: New York's Silk Stocking Regiment the Breaking of the Hindenburg Line by his grandnephew Stephen L.

By his retirement, the evangelical Pentecostal denomination had grown from 29,000 members in 410 churches to 1.2 million members in more than 19,000 churches located in 63 countries. == Personal background == Rolf McPherson was born on March 23, 1913 in Providence, Rhode Island. He was the son of Harold Stewart McPherson and Aimee Semple McPherson, founder of the International Church of the Foursquare Gospel. He was the half-brother of Roberta Star Semple, the daughter of Aimee and her first husband Robert James Semple, who had died of malaria one month before the birth of his daughter. Rolf and his sister Roberta were part of many services and revivals when young. McPherson attended college, first studying engineering. He switched to religion in 1930 after his mother became ill, and also completed divinity school, earning a doctorate. McPherson began his career as a preacher. His mother groomed him to take over Foursquare after a management dispute resulted in Roberta being ousted from church leadership. After his mother's death in 1944, and for the next 44 years, McPherson led the denomination, headquartered at Angelus Temple, and brought it into the evangelical mainstream, which supported its tremendous development in the United States and expansion internationally. He retired in 1988. After retirement, he continued to attend church every week, serving in congregational ministry. He resigned from all church duties in 1997.

The season had ten tropical cyclones. Seven of these became hurricanes; one becoming a major Category 3 hurricane. Because there were no modern satellite or other remote-sensing technologies, only cyclones that affected populated land areas or that encountered ships at sea are currently known, so the true total could be higher. For the years 1886 through 1910, an undercount bias of zero to four tropical cyclones per year has been estimated. The tracks of four of the ten cyclones were revised in 1996 by Jose Fernandez- Partagas. Following re-analysis in 2003, two storms previously considered distinct are now regarded as a single system, Tropical Storm 8. A number of other storms from 1891 were considered for inclusion in the Atlantic hurricane database, HURDAT, but are currently excluded due to a lack of evidence of tropical storm intensity. __TOC__ ==Timeline== ImageSize = width:800 height:200 PlotArea = top:10 bottom:80 right:20 left:20 Legend = columns:3 left:30 top:58 columnwidth:270 AlignBars = early DateFormat = dd/mm/yyyy Period = from:01/07/1891 till:01/12/1891 TimeAxis = orientation:horizontal ScaleMinor = grid:black unit:month increment:1 start:01/07/1891 Colors = id:canvas value:gray(0.88) id:GP value:red id:TD value:rgb(0.38,0.73,1) legend:Tropical_Depression_(TD)_=_<39_mph_(0–62_km/h) id:TS value:rgb(0,0.98,0.96) legend:Tropical_Storm_=_39–73_mph_(63–117 km/h) id:C1 value:rgb(1,1,0.80) legend:Category_1_=_74–95_mph_(119–153_km/h) id:C2 value:rgb(1,0.91,0.46) legend:Category_2_=_96–110_mph_(154–177_km/h) id:C3 value:rgb(1,0.76,0.25) legend:Category_3_=_111–130_mph_(178–209-km/h) id:C4 value:rgb(1,0.56,0.13) legend:Category_4_=_131–155_mph_(210–249_km/h) id:C5 value:rgb(1,0.38,0.38) legend:Category_5_=_>=156_mph_(>=250_km/h) Backgroundcolors = canvas:canvas BarData = barset:Hurricane bar:Month PlotData= barset:Hurricane width:10 align:left fontsize:S shift:(4,-4) anchor:till from:01/07/1891 till:08/07/1891 color:C1 text:\\"One (C1)\\" from:17/08/1891 till:26/08/1891 color:C1 text:\\"Two (C1)\\" from:18/08/1891 till:25/08/1891 color:C3 text:\\"Three (C3)\\" from:02/09/1891 till:08/09/1891 color:C2 text:\\"Four (C2)\\" from:16/09/1891 till:26/09/1891 color:C2 text:\\"Five (C2)\\" from:29/09/1891 till:05/10/1891 color:C2 text:\\"Six (C2)\\" from:04/10/1891 till:08/10/1891 color:TS text:\\"Seven (TS)\\" barset:break from:07/10/1891 till:09/10/1891 color:TS text:\\"Eight (TS)\\" from:12/10/1891 till:20/10/1891 color:C1 text:\\"Nine (C1)\\" from:03/11/1891 till:11/11/1891 color:TS text:\\"Ten (TS)\\" bar:Month width:15 align:center fontsize:S shift:(0,-20) anchor:middle color:canvas from:01/07/1891 till:01/08/1891 text:July from:01/08/1891 till:01/09/1891 text:August from:01/09/1891 till:01/10/1891 text:September from:01/10/1891 till:01/11/1891 text:October from:01/11/1891 till:01/12/1891 text:November TextData = pos:(570,30) text:\\"(From the\\" pos:(617,30) text:\\"Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale)\\" ==Systems== ===Hurricane One=== A tropical storm formed in the Gulf of Mexico northwest of Campeche on 3 July.

The hurricane tracked northwestward at and grew to a major Category 3 hurricane. That night, the hurricane passed over Martinique, lashing the island for four hours. The hurricane killed more than 700 people in Martinique. After reaching its peak intensity with winds of and a minimum central pressure of 961 mb, the storm began to weaken, becoming a Category 2 storm early on 20 August. That evening, it passed to the south of Puerto Rico where sustained winds were measured at 100-105 mph. As it began to turn northward, it made landfall on the extreme eastern edge of the Dominican Republic with winds of . Around midnight on 21 August, the cyclone passed north of Grand Turk. During the late afternoon and into the evening hours there, frequent rain squalls occurred, and at 10:15 pm a strong gust of wind was reported. After that gust, the winds decreased in intensity, until around midnight when winds picked up from the west. By 8:00 am the next morning, the wind was blowing southerly, and steady rain was falling on the island. The hurricane continued to weaken while traveling northeastward through the Bahamas on 22 August. The center of the storm passed directly over Crooked Island, Bahamas. On 23 August, a ridge of high pressure situated off the southeast coast of the United States prevented the storm, which had become a Category 1 hurricane, from curving back to the north. Instead, it passed over the Florida peninsula as a tropical storm, making landfall near Homestead on 24 August. Subsequently, it moved into the Gulf of Mexico, where it dissipated on 25 August. On Martinique, the storm destroyed houses, crops and trees across the entire island. Fifty boats in harbours around Martinque were damaged or destroyed. At Ducos, only four homes remained following the storm, and at St. Pierre, at least 34 people lost their lives. At Fort de France, twenty people were killed. A military camp at Balata was destroyed, with a number of soldiers there sustaining injuries from airborne debris. In total, the death toll from this hurricane was put at 700. In South Florida, the cyclone also produced hurricane-force winds that blew boats ashore near present-day Cutler. ===Hurricane Four=== On 2 September a tropical storm formed northeast of the Leeward Islands. It began moving northwestward and reached category 2 hurricane strength by 4 September. By 7 September the cyclone was off the coast of New England and was bringing heavy rain to that area. When the hurricane made landfall in Nova Scotia and Newfoundland on 8 September, it destroyed a number of small vessels but then quickly weakened and dissipated north of Newfoundland in the Labrador Sea on 10 September. ===Hurricane Five=== A tropical storm formed in the open Atlantic near 19°N 47°W on 16 September before developing into a Category 2 hurricane on 20 September. This hurricane never made landfall but did pass within 100 km of Bermuda on the night of 21 September. A ship was reported wrecked on the coast of the island that night. The hurricane became an extratropical storm on 26 September in the mid-Atlantic off the coast of Nova Scotia. ===Hurricane Six=== A tropical storm formed in the open Atlantic near 21°N 54°W on 29 September. It moved northwestward becoming first a Category 1 hurricane then, on 3 October, a Category 2 hurricane. At this strength it passed to the south then to the west of Bermuda on 4 October. It quickly weakened as it continued heading north and was already an extratropical storm when it made landfall in Nova Scotia on 6 October. It also struck Newfoundland before dissipating in the Labrador Sea on 8 October. ===Tropical Storm Seven=== A moderate tropical storm formed in the Caribbean Sea south of Jamaica on 4 October and passed to the west of both Jamaica and the Cayman Islands before striking the Isla de la Juventud and Cuba on 6 October. The next day it passed across southern Florida before travelling northeastward off the east coast of the United States and then dissipating in the open Atlantic on 8 October. The storm drove some vessels on the coast of Cuba ashore, and two people drowned in flooding on the island. ===Tropical Storm Eight=== A tropical depression formed north of Honduras on 7 October and strengthened into a tropical storm the next day. On 9 October it passed across Cuba and quickly weakened to become an extratropical storm. It made landfall in Florida on 10 October and, five days later, in Nova Scotia and Newfoundland where it dissipated. ===Hurricane Nine=== A tropical storm formed north of Grenada on 12 October and made landfall on Saint Croix and the main Virgin Islands on 14 October. The system strengthened to a Category 1 hurricane as it proceeded north. The hurricane's storm centre passed west of Bermuda on 18 October but weakened to a tropical storm just before reaching the southern tip of Newfoundland on 20 October. ===Tropical Storm Ten=== On 3 November, a tropical storm formed northeast of present-day Nassau, Bahamas. It travelled north, passing east of Bermuda on 5 November. The storm never made landfall before dissipating in the open Atlantic off of Nova Scotia on 6 November. ==See also== *List of tropical cyclones *Atlantic hurricane season ==References== ===Bibliography=== * * ==External links== *Monthly Weather Review *HURDAT Data for the 1891 Atlantic hurricane season Category:Articles which contain graphical timelines Category:1891 meteorology Category:1891 natural disasters ","title":"1891 Atlantic hurricane season"},{"id":"2549023","text":"Eugene Maximillian, 1st Prince of Hornes (October 1, 1631 – March 10, 1709) was the son of Ambroise de Hornes, 2nd Count of Bassignies and Marie Marguerite de Bailleul de Lesdaing.

Every couple of hours, the Prometheus has to drop out of hyperspace to cool down the Al'kesh hyperdrive. The Prometheus comes near a nebula that Samantha Carter thinks doesn't conform to nebulae she has previously studied. When they drop out of hyperspace, the Prometheus is attacked by an unknown vessel. They can't jump into hyperspace because the engines need to cool down. The Prometheus is chased into a gas cloud by the alien ship. Samantha Carter is knocked out when she tries to convert power from auxiliary to the hyperdrive to make a small hyperspace jump into the cloud. When she wakes up, all the crew members other than her have disappeared and Carter is suffering from a worsening concussion. She alone must get herself and them to safety. She has visions of a little girl running around the ship, playing with bubbles and of her friends, who vocalize her worries and theories about her predicament. Teal'c at one point grabs Carter by the arm and warns her that if she falls asleep she will die. The hallucination of Daniel Jackson frankly confesses that he is unreal but he is present because there is something she has overlooked. The hallucination of Teal'c warns her that this whole scenario could be a result of the hostile alien species mind-probing, with a view to her inadvertently surrendering information about the Prometheus engine technology. Daniel then reappears and tells her that the 'nebula' may be a living being which is why she and the alien ship are stuck inside. The hallucinations of Jacob Carter and of Jack O'Neill serve as a means by which Carter confronts her personal life and her relationships (in particular when talking to 'Jack', her feelings for him). 'Jack' tells her he will always be there for her, no matter what. After an encounter with the small girl who is playing with bubbles Carter hits on a solution. She engages the hyperdrive with only a fraction of the usual amount of power. This has the effect of rendering the ship partially intangible. She contacts the alien ship, also trapped inside of the cloud and offers them the solution to escaping the nebula in exchange for the return of the crew and safe passage. After a confused crew are beamed back in to the Prometheus, Carter creates a hyperspace bubble large enough to encompass both the Prometheus and the alien ship and they both exit the nebula safely. The aliens keep their end of the bargain and jet away. Carter relieves herself of duty and is escorted to the infirmary for treatment. ==Production== ==Reception== According to the DVD commentary for Inauguration, Grace received the highest ratings of any television show on the Sci-Fi network, including all previous Stargate episodes.

Based on a screenplay by Robert Buckner, the film is about a Union officer who escapes from a Confederate prison and is sent to Virginia City from where his former prison commander is planning to send five million dollars in gold to Virginia to save the Confederacy. The film premiered in its namesake, Virginia City, Nevada. The film was shot in black and white (sepiatone). ==Plot== Union officer Kerry Bradford (Errol Flynn) stages a daring escape from Confederate Libby Prison run by the commandant, Vance Irby (Randolph Scott). Bradford reports to Union headquarters and is immediately sent to Virginia City, a Nevada mining town, to find out where $5,000,000 in gold that Southern sympathizers plan to ship to the tottering Confederacy is being kept. On the westbound stagecoach, he meets and falls in love with the elegant Julia Hayne (Miriam Hopkins), who unbeknownst to him is in fact a dance-hall entertainer — and a rebel spy, sent by Jefferson Davis (Charles Middleton) to assist in the transfer of the gold by wagon train. Also on the stagecoach is the legendary John Murrell (Humphrey Bogart), leader of a gang of \\"banditos\\", traveling as a gun salesman. Before he and his gang can rob the stage, Bradford gets the drop on Murrell, who is forced to send his men away. When the stage reaches Virginia City, Julia gives Bradford the slip and heads off to warn Captain Irby, who is now managing the gold-smuggling operation, that Bradford is in town. Bradford follows Irby to the rebels' hideout behind a false wall in a blacksmith's shop, but the gold is moved before he arrives. The Union garrison is called out to patrol the roads to prevent any wagons from leaving town. While Irby is meeting with the sympathetic town doctor, Murrell shows up looking for someone to set his broken arm. Irby offers Murrell $10,000 to have his banditos attack the garrison, which will force the Union soldiers guarding the roads to come to its defense. While the soldiers are busy, Irby's rebels will smuggle the gold out in the false bottoms of their wagons. First Irby needs to take care of Bradford. He uses Julia to arrange a meeting between the two men, and then takes Bradford prisoner, intending to return him to prison. The rebels' caravan is stopped at a small Union outpost. At first, they are allowed to proceed, but after watching the bullion-laden wagons have difficulty moving through the soft dirt, the soldiers become suspicious and attempt to inspect the wagons. The Southerners start a firefight, killing the soldiers. In the confusion, Bradford escapes. Pursued closely by Irby and his men, he rides his horse down a steep incline and ends up somersaulting down the hill. The rebels, believing him dead, continue toward Texas. Bradford returns to the outpost and sends a telegraph to the garrison. Major Drewery (Douglass Dumbrille), the garrison commander, arrives with a contingent of cavalry. Drewery, who is scornful of Bradford as a soldier, does not take his advice and ends up following a false trail, causing the pursuit to fall ever further behind the rebels, who are themselves fighting thirst, privation, and the unforgiving terrain. Bradford is able to persuade Drewery to allow him to take a small detachment to follow his hunch. Bradford and his men catch up with the caravan which is trapped in a canyon and being attacked by Murrell's banditos who are attempting to take the gold. Irby is wounded in the gunfight, but Bradford's superior military skills and the rebels' long guns eventually drive off the banditos. Before he dies, Irby delegates command of the caravan and its gold to Bradford. During the night, knowing that in the morning both Murrell's men and Drewery's command will arrive, Bradford takes the gold from the wagons and buries it in the canyon to prevent its capture. Drewery and his men arrive in the morning in time to crush the outlaws' renewed attack, and Murell is killed. Bradford refuses to disclose the gold's location and is brought up on charges in a court-martial. He defends his action in that, \\"as a soldier\\", he knew the gold might have been used to win the war for the South and prevented that, but \\"as a man\\" he knows it belongs to the South and he would prefer that it be used to rebuild the South's shattered economy and wounded pride after the war. The court finds him guilty of high treason and sentences him to death on April 9, 1865. The day before Bradford's scheduled execution, Julia meets with Abraham Lincoln (Victor Kilian, seen only in silhouette) and pleads for Bradford's life. Lincoln reveals that at that very moment, Generals Lee and Grant are meeting at Appomattox Courthouse to end the war. As the war is over, and in a symbol of the reconciliation between North and South, Lincoln pardons Bradford in the spirit of his second inaugural address, \\"With malice toward none; with charity for all...\\" ==Cast== * Errol Flynn as Captain Kerry Bradford * Miriam Hopkins as Julia Hayne * Randolph Scott as Captain Vance Irby * Humphrey Bogart as John Murrell * Frank McHugh as Mr. Upjohn * Alan Hale as Olaf \\"Moose\\" Swenson * Guinn \\"Big Boy\\" Williams as \\"Marblehead\\" * John Litel as Thomas Marshall * Douglass Dumbrille as Major Drewery * Moroni Olsen as Dr. Robert Cameron * Russell Hicks as John Armistead * Dickie Jones as Cobby Gill * Frank Wilcox as Union Outpost Soldier * Russell Simpson as Frank Gaylord * Victor Kilian as Abraham Lincoln * Charles Middleton as Jefferson Davis * Ward Bond as Confederate Sergeant (uncredited) * Roy Gordon as Maj.

It was originally called Nevada and was to star basically the same director and cast as Dodge City: Flynn, Olivia de Havilland, Ann Sheridan, Donald Crisp, Guinn Williams, and Alan Hale. The title was eventually changed to Virginia City, which had been owned by RKO, but they agreed to give it to Warners. De Havilland dropped out and was replaced by Brenda Marshall. However, within a few weeks, Miriam Hopkins replaced her. Randolph Scott was hired to play Flynn's antagonist. Victor Jory was going to play the main villain, but had a scheduling conflict due to his appearance in Light of Western Stars. He was replaced by Humphrey Bogart, requiring It All Came True to be pushed back. There was six weeks' filming based in Flagstaff, Arizona. ==Release and reception== The film was given a gala premiere in Reno and Virginia City. ===Critical Reception=== Frank Nugent of The New York Times, despite criticizing the acting talents of Flynn and Hopkins, wrote that \\"there is enough concentrated action in [Virginia City], enough of the old-time Western sweep, to make it lively entertainment\\". Filmink magazine called it \\"a big, expensive, noisy movie which aims for size and spectacle over, say, suspense and thrills – I don’t think director Michael Curtiz was any more excited by Westerns than Flynn, but both do professional jobs, as does Scott.\\" ===Box office=== According to Warner Bros records, the film earned $1,518,000 domestically and $602,000 foreign. When the film was released in France in 1947, it became one of the most popular movies of the year. ==References* * Virginia City on Lux Radio Theater: May 26, 1941 Category:1940 films Category:1940s action drama films Category:1940s Western (genre) drama films Category:American action drama films Category:American films Category:American Western (genre) drama films Category:American black-and-white films Category:English-language films Category:Films scored by Max Steiner Category:Films directed by Michael Curtiz Category:Films set in Nevada Category:Warner Bros. films Category:1940 drama films ","title":"Virginia City (film)"},{"id":"2549115","text":"Irving Vendig (October 11, 1902 – January 7, 1995) was an American soap opera writer best known for creating The Edge of Night. ==Career== Born in the Mississippi city of Holly Springs, Vendig created The Edge of Night for Procter and Gamble Productions and CBS Daytime in 1956.

A variable capacitor is a capacitor whose capacitance may be intentionally and repeatedly changed mechanically or electronically. Variable capacitors are often used in L/C circuits to set the resonance frequency, e.g. to tune a radio (therefore it is sometimes called a tuning capacitor or tuning condenser), or as a variable reactance, e.g. for impedance matching in antenna tuners. ==Mechanically controlled capacitance== Principle of the rotary variable capacitor In mechanically controlled variable capacitors, the distance between the plates, or the amount of plate surface area which overlaps, can be changed. The most common form arranges a group of semicircular metal plates on a rotary axis (\\"rotor\\") that are positioned in the gaps between a set of stationary plates (\\"stator\\") so that the area of overlap can be changed by rotating the axis. Air or plastic foils can be used as dielectric material. By choosing the shape of the rotary plates, various functions of capacitance vs. angle can be created, e.g. to obtain a linear frequency scale. Various forms of reduction gear mechanisms are often used to achieve finer tuning control, i.e. to spread the variation of capacity over a larger angle, often several turns. File:Forgokondenzator1.jpg Cmin = 29 pF File:Forgokondenzator2.jpg C = 269 pF File:Forgokondenzator3.jpg Cmax = 520 pF A vacuum variable capacitor uses a set of plates made from concentric cylinders that can be slid in or out of an opposing set of cylinders (sleeve and plunger). These plates are then sealed inside of a non-conductive envelope such as glass or ceramic and placed under a high vacuum. The movable part (plunger) is mounted on a flexible metal membrane that seals and maintains the vacuum. A screw shaft is attached to the plunger, when the shaft is turned the plunger moves in or out of the sleeve and the value of the capacitor changes. The vacuum not only increases the working voltage and current handling capacity of the capacitor, it also greatly reduces the chance of arcing across the plates. The most common usage for vacuum variables are in high-powered transmitters such as those used for broadcasting, military and amateur radio, as well as high-powered RF tuning networks. Vacuum variables can also be more convenient; since the elements are under a vacuum, the working voltage can be higher than an air variable the same size, allowing the size of the vacuum capacitor to be reduced. Very cheap variable capacitors are constructed from layered aluminium and plastic foils that are variably pressed together using a screw. These so-called squeezers cannot provide a stable and reproducible capacitance, however. A variant of this structure that allows for linear movement of one set of plates to change the plate overlap area is also used and might be called a slider. This has practical advantages for makeshift or home construction, and may be found in resonant-loop antennas or crystal radios. Small variable capacitors operated by screwdriver (for instance, to precisely set a resonant frequency at the factory and then never be adjusted again) are called trimmer capacitors. In addition to air and plastic, trimmers can also be made using a ceramic dielectric, such as mica. ==Special forms of mechanically variable capacitors== Various forms of variable capacitors ===Multiple sections=== Very often, multiple stator/rotor sections are arranged behind one another on the same axis, allowing for several tuned circuits to be adjusted using the same control, e.g. a preselector, an input filter and the corresponding oscillator in a receiver circuit. The sections can have identical or different nominal capacitances, e.g. 2 × 330 pF for AM filter and oscillator, plus 3 × 45 pF for two filters and an oscillator in the FM section of the same receiver. Capacitors with multiple sections often include trimmer capacitors in parallel to the variable sections, used to adjust all tuned circuits to the same frequency. ===Butterfly=== A butterfly capacitor is a form of rotary variable capacitor with two independent sets of stator plates opposing each other, and a butterfly-shaped rotor arranged so that turning the rotor will vary the capacitances between the rotor and either stator equally. Butterfly capacitors are used in symmetrical tuned circuits, e.g. RF power amplifier stages in push-pull configuration or symmetrical antenna tuners where the rotor needs to be \\"cold\\", i.e. connected to RF (but not necessarily DC) ground potential. Since the peak RF current normally flows from one stator to the other without going through wiper contacts, butterfly capacitors can handle large resonance RF currents, e.g. in magnetic loop antennas. In a butterfly capacitor, the stators and each half of the rotor can only cover a maximum angle of 90° since there must be a position without rotor/stator overlap corresponding to minimum capacity, therefore a turn of only 90° covers the entire capacitance range.G3NPF and M1AIM Home Page Technical Section (Capacitors) ===Split stator=== The closely related split stator variable capacitor does not have the limitation of 90° angle since it uses two separate packs of rotor electrodes arranged axially behind one another. Unlike in a capacitor with several sections, the rotor plates in a split stator capacitor are mounted on opposite sides of the rotor axis. While the split stator capacitor benefits from larger electrodes compared to the butterfly capacitor, as well as a rotation angle of up to 180°, the separation of rotor plates incurs some losses since RF current has to pass the rotor axis instead of flowing straight through each rotor vane. ===Differential=== Differential variable capacitors also have two independent stators, but unlike in the butterfly capacitor where capacities on both sides increase equally as the rotor is turned, in a differential variable capacitor one section's capacity will increase while the other section's decreases, keeping the sum of the two stator capacitances constant. Differential variable capacitors can therefore be used in capacitive potentiometric circuits. ==History== The variable capacitor with air dielectric was invented by the Hungarian engineer Dezső Korda. He received a German patent for the invention on 13 December 1893. George Washington Pierce: Principles of wireless telegraphy, McGraw-Hill book company, New York, 1910, p. 114. (Photo of rotary capacitor of Korda). == Electronically controlled capacitance== === Voltage tuned capacitance === The thickness of the depletion layer of a reverse-biased semiconductor diode varies with the DC voltage applied across the diode. Any diode exhibits this effect (including p/n junctions in transistors), but devices specifically sold as variable capacitance diodes (also called varactors or varicaps) are designed with a large junction area and a doping profile specifically designed to maximize capacitance. Their use is limited to low signal amplitudes to avoid obvious distortions as the capacitance would be affected by the change of signal voltage, precluding their use in the input stages of high-quality RF communications receivers, where they would add unacceptable levels of intermodulation. At VHF/UHF frequencies, e.g. in FM Radio or TV tuners, dynamic range is limited by noise rather than large signal handling requirements, and varicaps are commonly used in the signal path. Varicaps are used for frequency modulation of oscillators, and to make high-frequency voltage controlled oscillators (VCOs), the core component in phase-locked loop (PLL) frequency synthesizers that are ubiquitous in modern communications equipment. BST device are based on Barium Strontium Titanate and vary the capacitance by applying high voltage to the device. They have a dedicated analogue control input and therefore introduce less non-linearities than varactor diodes, especially for higher signal voltages. The limitations for BST are stability over temperature and linearity in demanding applications. === Digitally tuned capacitance === A digitally tuned capacitor is an IC variable capacitor based on several technologies. MEMS, BST and SOI/SOS devices are available from a number of suppliers and vary in capacitance range, quality factor and resolution for different RF tuning applications. MEMS devices have the highest quality factor and are highly linear, and therefore are suitable for antenna aperture tuning, dynamic impedance matching, power amplifier load matching and adjustable filters. RF tuning MEMS are still a relatively new technology and has not yet been accepted broadly. SOI/SOS tuning devices are constructed as solid state FET switches built on insulated CMOS wafers and use MIM caps arranged in binary-weighted values to achieve different capacitance values. SOI/SOS switches have high linearity and are well suited to low power applications where high voltages are not present. High voltage endurance requires multiple FET devices in series which adds series resistance and lowers the quality factor. The capacitance values are designed for antenna impedance matching in multi-band LTE GSM/WCDMA cellular handsets and mobile TV receivers that operate over wide frequency ranges, such as the European DVB-H and Japanese ISDB-T mobile TV systems. ==Transducers== Variable capacitance is sometimes used to convert physical phenomena into electrical signals. * In a capacitor microphone (commonly known as a condenser microphone), the diaphragm acts as one plate of a capacitor, and vibrations produce changes in the distance between the diaphragm and a fixed plate, changing the voltage maintained across the capacitor plates. * Some types of industrial sensors use a capacitor element to convert physical quantities such as pressure, displacement or relative humidity to an electrical signal for measurement purposes. * Capacitive sensors can also be used in the place of switches, e.g. in computer keyboards or \\"touch buttons\\" for elevators that have no user-movable parts. ==Notes== # A makeshift version of this design, using two tin cans with slightly different diameter isolated by cardboard, has been used to make variable capacitors in emergencies, e.g. by concentration camp inmates. # While mechanical variable capacitors have been used and are still used extensively in electronics, their use in radios is diminishing. Radios now often use digital frequency synthesizers for tuning rather than analog (tank) oscillators. ==References== ==External links== * Build your own air variable capacitor * High-res images of historical variable capacitors * Introduction to capacitors * Introduction to Variable Vacuum Capacitor Category:Capacitors Category:Wireless tuning and filtering Category:Hungarian inventions Category:19th-century inventions pt:Capacitor#Capacitores variáveis ","title":"Variable capacitor"},{"id":"2549120","text":"__NOTOC__ Darrington may refer to: ==Places== *Darrington, West Yorkshire, England *Darrington, Washington, United States ==People with the surname== *Denton Darrington (born 1940), American politician *Michael Darrington, British businessman *Mike Darrington (born 1931), English snooker player ==People with the given name== *Darrington Sentimore (born 1990), American football player ==See also== *Darrington Unit, a prison in Texas, United States ","title":"Darrington"},{"id":"2549125","text":"Several measures of light are commonly known as intensity: *Radiant intensity, a radiometric quantity measured in watts per steradian (W/sr) *Luminous intensity, a photometric quantity measured in lumens per steradian (lm/sr), or candela (cd) *Irradiance, a radiometric quantity, measured in watts per meter squared (W/m2) **Intensity (physics), the name for irradiance used in other branches of physics (W/m2) *Radiance, commonly called \\"intensity\\" in astronomy and astrophysics (W·sr−1·m−2) ==See also== *Brightness, the subjective perception elicited by the luminance of a source *Luminance, the photometric equivalent of radiance (lm·sr−1·m−2) *Photometry (optics), measurement of light, in terms of its perceived brightness to the human eye *Radiometry, measurement of light, in absolute power units ","title":"Light intensity"},{"id":"2549127","text":"Professor Johann Georg Bühler (July 19, 1837 – April 8, 1898) was a scholar of ancient Indian languages and law. ==Early life and education== Bühler was born to Rev. Johann G. Bühler in Borstel, Hanover, attended grammar school in Hanover, where he mastered Greek and Latin, then university as a student of theology and philosophy at Göttingen, where he studied classical philology, Sanskrit, Zend, Persian, Armenian, and Arabic. In 1858 he received his doctorate in eastern languages and archaeology; his thesis explored the suffix -tês in Greek grammar. That same year he went to Paris to study Sanskrit manuscripts, and in 1859 onwards to London, where he remained until October 1862. This time was used mainly for the study of the Vedic manuscripts at the India Office and the Bodleian Library at Oxford University. While in England, Bühler was first a private teacher and later (from May 1861) assistant to the Queen's librarian in Windsor Castle. ==Academic career== In Fall 1862 Bühler was appointed assistant at the Göttingen library; he moved there in October. While settling in, he received an invitation via Prof. Max Müller to join the Benares Sanskrit College in India. Before this could be settled, he also received (again via Prof. Müller) an offer of Professor of Oriental Languages at the Elphinstone College, Bombay (now Mumbai). Bühler responded immediately and arrived on February 10, 1863 in Bombay. Noted Sanskrit and legal scholar Kashinath Trimbak Telang was then a student at the college. In the next year Bühler became a Fellow of Bombay University and member of the Bombay Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society. He was to remain in India until 1880. During this time he collected a remarkable number of texts for the Indian government and the libraries of Berlin, Cambridge University, and Oxford University. In the year 1878 he published his translations of the Paiyalachchhi, the oldest Prakrit dictionary, with glossary and translation. He also took responsibility for the translation of the Apastamba, Dharmasutra etc. in Professor Max Müller's monumental compilation and translation, the Sacred Books of the East, vols. 2, 14, and 25. On 8 April 1898 Bühler drowned in Lake Constance, under somewhat mysterious circumstances. Contemporary accounts mostly attributed it to an accident, but it has been speculated that it was a suicide motivated by Bühler's connections to a scandal involving his former student Alois Anton Führer. ==Selected publications== * Prakrit dictionary Paiyalacchinamamala (\\"Beiträge zur kunde der indogermanischen sprachen\\", Göttingen 1878) * Erklärung der Ashokainschriften (\\"Zeitschrift der deutschen morgenländischen gesellschaft\\", 1883–1893) * The roots of the Dhatupatha not found in literature (\\"Wiener zeitschrift für die kunde des morgenlandes\\", 1894) * On the origin of the Kharosthi alphabet (ibid. 1895) * Digest of Hindu law cases (1867–1869; 1883) * Panchatantra with English notes (\\"The Bombay sanscrit series\\", 1868; 1891) * Apastambiya Dharmasutra (1868–1871; 1892–1894) * Catalogue of Sanskrit manuscripts from Gujarat (4 vol., 1871–1873) * Dachakumaracharita, with English notes (\\"Sanscrit series\\" no. 10, 1873, 1887; II, with P.

It was originally intended to be the last episode of Stargate SG-1. The episode was written by executive producer Robert C. Cooper and directed by Martin Wood. The episodes received an average Nielsen household rating and a low syndication rating compared to other season six episodes. The episode got strong reviews from major media publishers worldwide. \\"Full Circle\\" follows the Ascended Daniel Jackson contacting Jack O'Neill and tells him that Anubis has located The Eye of Ra, an enormously powerful weapon that can defeat the combined forces of the Goa'uld System Lords. SG-1 then travels to Abydos to create a defensive position against the Goa'uld Army, Anubis then appears over the planet and threatens to destroy it if they don't give him The Eye of Ra. == Plot == On Abydos, Skaara speaks with the Abydonian elders about Anubis, who will attack soon. In the middle of their council, Daniel appears, telling them that they will not fight alone. At the SGC, Col. O'Neill steps on an elevator, which malfunctions in the middle of the ride. Just as he tries to use the emergency phone, Daniel appears behind him and updates him on the situation with Anubis, who plans to get the \\"Eye of Ra\\" from Abydos, a key (along with five others) to using a super weapon. Jack demands to know why Daniel, with all the powers of the Ascended, can't stop Anubis himself, and Daniel tries to explain again what he is and is not allowed to do. Jack relays Daniel's intel to General Hammond and SG-1. When they ask where he got that kind of information, he reluctantly admits to seeing Daniel, and that it isn't the first time. No one seems terribly surprised to hear it, and Teal'c mentions that he, too, has seen Daniel. Hammond approves the mission, and SG-1 goes to Abydos where they meet up with Skaara, who brings them into an underground chamber, where they hope to find the Eye. While Sam and Jonas explore the chamber, Jack asks Skaara if he's seeing anyone, and Skaara tells him that he's betrothed. In the meantime, Anubis' mothership appears out of hyperspace and several ships fly to the pyramid, which is defended by Teal'c and a number of Abydonians. When the ships and ground troops attack, Teal'c radios Jack, who, irked by Daniel's absence, starts yelling for Daniel. Daniel appears and tries to say he still can't help, but Jack pushes him. Giving in, Daniel agrees to help Sam and Jonas figure out how to find the chamber while Jack and Ska'ara go above to assist Teal'c. Daniel, Major Carter, and Jonas open the chamber, full of artifacts, but not the Eye. In the pyramid, Skaara is mortally wounded while Jack and Teal'c fight valiantly to hold their ground. They are finally forced retreat to the underground chamber where Daniel concludes that the other ascended beings are Ancients. They discover a tablet, written in the language of the Ancients, which reveals information about a lost city of the Ancients. Daniel instructs Jonas to guard it with his life, then departs. Carter and Jonas find another secret chamber, which Sam shoots open, revealing the Eye. Jack and Teal'c, with Skaara, appear, bedraggled from the Jaffa onslaught. Their leader, Herak, confronts SG-1, demanding the Eye. Jack simply threatens to destroy the Eye. Herak returns to the ship and informs Anubis. As Herak departs, Daniel confronts Anubis, who reveals what he truly is, a partially ascended being. In space, a fleet of Ha'tak vessels appears and Yu contacts Anubis, threatening to destroy him. Daniel, on the other hand, offers Anubis a deal: he will bring him the Eye if Anubis promises to leave Abydos unharmed forever. The Goa'uld agrees. Daniel goes to SG-1, where he hears to his surprise that Skaara has died and ascended, realizing that Oma must be present. He advises the team of Anubis' partially ascended state: stuck between the mortal world and the ascended one. Anubis was thought dead but actually ascended. The Ancients, only accepting pure of heart among their ranks, de-ascended him but not completely. The shimmering energy that hides his true face keeps his form intact. He also informs them about his deal with Anubis because he wants SG-1 to find the lost city of the Ancients before Anubis can. O'Neill surrenders the Eye to Herak and the Jaffa leave. On the ship, Herak gives Anubis the Eye, and Anubis powers up a large weapon. It fires on Yu's ships and destroys many of them. The few left retreat, unable to penetrate Anubis' shields, with Lord Yu, also still alive. Anubis plans to destroy Abydos but Daniel appears and demands that Anubis stop. Anubis refuses, and goads Daniel into attacking him. Daniel attempts to use his ascended powers to destroy him. However, his attack is cut short, and he is spirited away by Oma Desala. Anubis, rid of his last obstacle, fires the superweapon at the pyramid on Abydos, where Jack is, and Jack slips through the event horizon of the Abydos Stargate and back to the SGC just in time. The planet Abydos is then destroyed. Back at SGC, SGC personnel attempt to dial back to Abydos, but they are unable to connect, and fear that Abydos has been obliterated by Anubis's superweapon. SG-1 continue to brief General Hammond about the situation and everything that transpired on Abydos. Carter and Walter continue dialing Abydos, as Carter refuses to believe that the planet is gone. Suddenly, after dozens of attempts, the Stargate establishes a wormhole to Abydos. Hammond allows SG-1 to return to Abydos to find out what has happened. SG-1 goes through the gate and discovers Skaara and his people. Astonished and yet relieved, SG-1 ask Skaara what happened. Skaara tells them that Oma helped all the Abydonian people around the planet ascend and that the people and the Stargate are only an illusion. Skaara sadly informs them that he has not heard anything about Daniel's fate. Suddenly, all the people disappear. Relieved that the Abydonians had not perished during Anubis's attack, SG-1 then returns to Earth. == Production == \\"Full Circle\\" was written with the intention of being the last Stargate SG-1 television episode, since the producers were already planning to release a Stargate film. When creating the Jaffa underlings for Anubis, the producers wanted to have something different. So, according to Joseph Mallozzi, they created \\"Ninja\\"-like Jaffa. \\"Full Circle\\" was originally intended to be the last episode of Stargate SG-1. It is also the last episode to feature Corin Nemec (who portrayed Jonas Quinn) as a main cast member. It is also the last episode where Alexis Cruz (who portrayed Skaara) appears. Nemec was open to continue playing Jonas Quinn after season 6 or in a feature film or a spin-off series, but a new contract was reached with Michael Shanks for Daniel to return in season 7. The role of Jonas was therefore reduced to recurring status in season 7. Nemec welcomed the producers' openness for story pitches and offered several story ideas. He wrote the mid-season-7 episode \\"Fallout\\" and considered pitching more stories afterwards, but he became busy with other projects. Jonas is seldom mentioned in the series after this point but after Season 10's \\"Counterstrike\\" stated that the Ori conquered Jonas's homeworld, * Carter: \\"Meanwhile, we received word that five more planets have fallen to the Ori, including Hebridan and Langara.\\" Stargate producer Joseph Mallozzi said in his blog that \\"in [his] mind, Jonas went underground and is still alive somewhere, resisting the Ori army.\\" == References == == External links == * Full Circle at mgm.com * * Full Circle at scifi.com Category:Stargate SG-1 episodes Category:2003 American television episodes ","title":"Full Circle (Stargate SG-1)"},{"id":"2549161","text":"Scatterville is an unincorporated community in Clay County, Arkansas, United States, approximately 2 mi (3 km) northwest of Rector. All that is left of the community today is a cemetery. The community occupied a strategic location along Crowley's Ridge and was often referred to in the reports of Union and Confederate forces vying for control of Northeast Arkansas during the American Civil War. ==History== Scatterville was one of the first Clay County communities, defined by having five or six families settled in a five-mile (8 km) area.Webb, Robert T., History & Traditions of Clay County, 1933 Scatterville received its name because:Webb, Robert T., History & Traditions of Clay County, 1933 > . . . one man put a store at the foot of a hill, another put one at the > peak, still another put one at the foot on the other side. The few stores > and cabins were scattered about over the hills in a careless way.Webb, > Robert T., History & Traditions of Clay County, 1933 The first families to locate in the Scatterville community were the McNiels, Allens, Copelands, Mobleys, Snowdens, Waddells, Nortens, Mitchells, Golbys, Whites, Bradshaws, Deans, Rayburns, Whitakers, and Simmons. They were mainly subsistence farmers; however, the Allen, Knight, Simmon, Bradshaw, McNiel, and Mobley families brought a few slaves with them when they emigrated from Kentucky and Tennessee. Cotton was grown during the antebellum period, but it was only used to make clothing for personal use. A gin in Scatterville eased this task somewhat by removing the seeds from the boll. After the war, cotton was raised as a cash crop. In 1855, the first horse-powered sawmill was brought to Scatterville, and a frame school building was erected in 1859. In that same year the town welcomed Major Rayburn's new steam-powered sawmill. Other industries in Scatterville included a tanyard for shoe making and a hand-powered sorghum mill.Webb, Robert T., History & Traditions of Clay County, 1933 The community remained stable until the arrival of the St. Louis and Texas Railroad about two miles (3 km) to the south in 1881. The railroad company laid out a new town named Rector, and the population of Scatterville gradually migrated to the new and booming town. ===Civil War=== During the American Civil War, both Union and Confederate forces operated in the area.

The cemetery is surrounded on three sides by a barbed-wire fence of indeterminate age, and is further designated by a large cast-iron marker erected at the entrance by the Arkansas History Commission in 1973. Most of the markers are small, narrow marble slabs, many of which have fallen and/or possibly moved. The inscriptions on many gravestones have been obscured by age and the elements while others were never inscribed. There are a few styled markers, including two four-sided family monuments with obelisks belonging to the Allen and McNiel families. Both were damaged by vandals; the Allen monument has been repaired, while the McNiel obelisk is lying in two parts beside its base. Nearby, the largest gravestone in the cemetery, the square-based, shaft and capital monument to Nancy McNiel, is in worse condition with its shaft lying on the ground and its capital broken into several pieces. There is also a multiple gravestone for three members of the Cook family. It is a tall rectangular monument with an upper-sloped face featuring a sculpted open Bible. Other interesting stones include H. W. Granade's 1870 horizontal cylindrical marker and Captain W. T. Morris's 1902 rectangular monument on base with an open Bible and a knotted stole draped down one side.Dalton, O. L.; \\"Scatterville Cemetery Gravestones.\\" Clay County Democrat, August 15, 1963.

According to legend, the god Vahagn stole some straw from the Assyrian king Barsham and brought it to Armenia during a cold winter. When he fled across the heavens, he spilled some of the straw along the way. === Khoisan === The Khoisan people of the Kalahari desert in southern Africa say that long ago there were no stars and the night was pitch black. A girl, who was lonely and wanted to visit other people, threw the embers from a fire into the sky and created the Milky Way. === Cherokee === A Cherokee folktale tells of a dog who stole some cornmeal and was chased away. He ran away to the north, spilling the cornmeal along the way. The Milky Way is thus called ᎩᎵ ᎤᎵᏒᏍᏓᏅᏱ (Gili Ulisvsdanvyi) \\"Where the dog ran\\". === Eastern Asia === The creation of the River of Heaven (Milky Way) across the sky, associated with the myth of The Cowherd and the Weaver Girl Peoples in Eastern Asia believed that the hazy band of stars was the \\"Silvery River\\" of Heaven (, and ). In one story, the stars Altair and Vega were said to be two lovers who were allowed to meet only once a year on the seventh day of the seventh month, when a flock of magpies and crows formed a bridge over the galactic river. That day is celebrated as Qi Xi, the Seventh Night (, and ). === Egyptian === In Egyptian mythology, the Milky Way was considered a pool of cow's milk. The Milky Way was deified as a fertility cow-goddess by the name of Bat (later on syncretized with the sky goddess Hathor). === Finno- Ugric === Among the Finns, Estonians and related peoples, the Milky Way was and is called \\"The Pathway of the Birds\\" (, ). The Finns observed that migratory birds used the galaxy as a guideline to travel south, where they believed Lintukoto (bird home) was. In Estonian folklore it is believed that the birds are led by a white bird with the head of a maiden who chases birds of prey away. The maiden, the goddess Lindu, was the Queen of the Birds and the daughter of Ukko, the King of the Sky. After refusing the suits of the Sun and Moon for being too predictable in their routes and the Pole Star for being fixed, she fell in love with the Light of North for its beauty. They became engaged, but the inconstant Light of North left her soon afterward. The tears of the broken-hearted Lindu fell on her wedding veil, which became the Milky Way when her father brought her to heaven so she could reign by his side and guide the migrating birds, who followed the trail of stars in her veil. Only later did scientists indeed confirm this observation; the migratory birds use the Milky Way as a guide to travel to warmer, southern lands during the winter. The name in the Indo-European Baltic languages has the same meaning (, ). Jacopo Tintoretto's The Origin of the Milky Way === Mesopotamian === In the Babylonian epic poem Enûma Eliš, the Milky Way is created from the severed tail of the primeval salt water dragoness Tiamat, set in the sky by Marduk, the Babylonian national god, after slaying her. This story was once thought to have been based on an older Sumerian version in which Tiamat is instead slain by Enlil of Nippur, but is now though to be purely an invention of Babylonian propagandists with the intention to show Marduk as superior to the Sumerian deities. Another myth about Labbu is similarly interpreted. === Greek and Roman === The Greek name for the Milky Way (Γαλαξίας Galaxias) is derived from the Greek word for milk (γάλα, gala). One legend explains how the Milky Way was created by Heracles when he was a baby. His father, Zeus, was fond of his son, who was born of the mortal woman Alcmene. He decided to let the infant Heracles suckle on his divine wife Hera's milk when she was asleep, an act which would endow the baby with godlike qualities. When Hera woke and realized that she was breastfeeding an unknown infant, she pushed him away and the spurting milk became the Milky Way. Another version of the myth is that Heracles (Roman Hercules) was abandoned in the woods by his mortal parents, Amphitryon and Alcmene. Heracles, son of Zeus and Alcmene, was naturally favored by his father, who sent Athena, Greek goddess of wisdom, to retrieve him. Athena, not being so motherly, decided to take him to Hera to suckle. Hera agreed to suckle Heracles. As Heracles drinks the milk, he bites down, and Hera pushes him away in pain. The milk that squirts out forms the Milky Way. A story told by the Roman Hyginus in the Poeticon astronomicon (ultimately based on Greek myth) says that the milk came from the goddess Ops (Greek Rhea), the wife of Saturn (Greek Cronus). Saturn swallowed his children to ensure his position as head of the Pantheon and sky god, and so Ops conceived a plan to save her newborn son Jupiter (Greek Zeus): She wrapped a stone in infant's clothes and gave it to Saturn to swallow. Saturn asked her to nurse the child once more before he swallowed it, and the milk that spurted when she pressed her nipple against the rock eventually became the Milky Way. === Hindu === In the Hindu collection of stories called Bhagavata Purana, all the visible stars and planets moving through space are likened to a dolphin that swims through the water, and the heavens are called śiśumãra cakra, the dolphin disc. The Milky Way forms the abdomen of the dolphin and is called Akasaganga which means \\"The Ganges River of the Sky\\". According to Hindu mythology, Vishnu lies meditating on Shesha with his consort Lakshmi, in the Kshira Sagara (Sea of Milk). === Irish === Altar Wedge Tomb (c. 2500–2000 BC), Ireland, under the Milky Way. In Irish mythology, the main name of the Milky Way was Bealach na Bó Finne — Way of the White Cow. It was regarded as a heavenly reflection of the sacred River Boyne, which is described as \\"the Great Silver Yoke\\" and the \\"White Marrow of Fedlimid,\\" names which could equally apply to the Milky Way. (Mór-Chuing Argait, Smir Find Fedlimthi).http://theses.univ- lyon2.fr/documents/getpart.php?id=lyon2.2009.beck_n∂=159207 Other names include: *Ceann Síne—\\"chief chain\\" *Síog na Spéire—\\"stripe of the sky\\" *Earball na Lárach Báine—the White Mare's Tail. The Láir Bhán (white mare) is believed to a relic of a sovereignty goddess, and processions featuring a white hobby horse formerly took place in County Kerry around Samhain (Hallowe'en). *Claí Mór na Réaltaí—\\"Great Ditch/Fence of the Stars\\" *Sgríob Chlann Uisnich—\\"Track of the children of Uisneach.\\" This name derives from a legend: after the sons of Uisneach fell in battle, Deirdre threw herself into their grave. Angered, the king Conchobar mac Nessa exhumed the bodies and buried them separately, but a tree grew from each grave and the branches entwined. Again he had them dug up and buried on opposite sides of a lake; but then the great cluster of stars appeared across the sky, connecting the two graves. === Hungarian === In Hungarian mythology, Csaba, the mythical son of Attila the Hun and ancestor of the Hungarians, is supposed to ride down the Milky Way when the Székelys (ethnic Hungarians living in Transylvania) are threatened. Thus the Milky Way is called \\"The Road of the Warriors\\" (lit. \\"Road of Armies\\") . The stars are sparks from their horseshoes. === Māori === To the Māori the Milky Way is the waka (canoe) of Tama-rereti. The front and back of the canoe are Orion and Scorpius, while the Southern Cross and the Pointers are the anchor and rope. According to legend, when Tama-rereti took his canoe out onto a lake, he found himself far from home as night was falling. There were no stars at this time and in the darkness the Taniwha would attack and eat people. So Tama-rereti sailed his canoe along the river that emptied into the heavens (to cause rain) and scattered shiny pebbles from the lakeshore into the sky. The sky god, Ranginui, was pleased by this action and placed the canoe into the sky as well as a reminder of how the stars were made. === Australian Aboriginal === Aboriginal Australian peoples had a well- developed astronomy, with much of their mythology and cultural practices relating to the stars, planets and their motion through the sky, as well as using the stars to navigate the continent. The Kaurna people of the Adelaide Plains in South Australia see the band of the Milky Way as a river in the sky world. They called it Wodliparri (wodli = hut, house, parri = river) and believe that positioned along the river are a number of campfires. In addition, the dark patches mark the dwelling place of a dangerous creature known as a yura; the Kaurna call these patches Yurakauwe, which literally means \\"monster water\\". Aboriginal groups from the Cape York region of Queensland see the band of light as termites that had been blown into the sky by the ancestral hero Burbuk Boon. Further south, the band of stars that comprise the Milky Way are seen as thousands of flying foxes carrying away a dancer known as Purupriggie. The Aranda or Arrernte people, who come from Central Australia, see the band of the Milky Way as a river or creek in the sky world. This stellar river separates the two great camps of the Aranda and Luritja people. The stars to the east of this river represent the camps of the Aranda and the stars to the west represent Luritja encampments and some stars closer to the band represent a mixture of both. In the Kimberley region of Western Australia, the Aboriginal people called the Milky Way \\"Iowara\\" and see in it the presence of a giant emu elongated. == See also == * List of names for the Milky Way == References == == Further reading == *Rick Riordan, John Rocco, Disney Hyperion (2015) Hercules does twelve stupid things.

Dynkin systems are sometimes referred to as λ-systems (Dynkin himself used this term) or d-system. These set families have applications in measure theory and probability. A major application of λ-systems is the π-λ theorem, see below. == Definitions == Let Ω be a nonempty set, and let D be a collection of subsets of Ω (i.e., D is a subset of the power set of Ω). Then D is a Dynkin system if # Ω ∈ D, # if A, B ∈ D and A ⊆ B, then B \\\\ A ∈ D, # if A1, A2, A3, ... is a sequence of subsets in D and An ⊆ An+1 for all n ≥ 1, then \\\\bigcup_{n=1}^\\\\infty A_n\\\\in D. Equivalently, D is a Dynkin system if # Ω ∈ D, # if A ∈ D, then Ac ∈ D, # if A1, A2, A3, ... is a sequence of subsets in D such that Ai ∩ Aj = Ø for all i ≠ j, then \\\\bigcup_{n=1}^\\\\infty A_n\\\\in D. The second definition is generally preferred as it usually is easier to check. An important fact is that a Dynkin system which is also a π-system (i.e., closed under finite intersections) is a σ-algebra. This can be verified by noting that conditions 2 and 3 together with closure under finite intersections imply closure under countable unions. Given any collection \\\\mathcal{J} of subsets of \\\\Omega, there exists a unique Dynkin system denoted D\\\\\\\\{\\\\mathcal J\\\\\\\\} which is minimal with respect to containing \\\\mathcal J. That is, if \\\\tilde D is any Dynkin system containing \\\\mathcal J, then D\\\\\\\\{\\\\mathcal J\\\\\\\\}\\\\subseteq\\\\tilde D. D\\\\\\\\{\\\\mathcal J\\\\\\\\} is called the Dynkin system generated by \\\\mathcal{J}. Note D\\\\\\\\{\\\\emptyset\\\\\\\\}=\\\\\\\\{\\\\emptyset,\\\\Omega\\\\\\\\}. For another example, let \\\\Omega=\\\\\\\\{1,2,3,4\\\\\\\\} and \\\\mathcal J=\\\\\\\\{1\\\\\\\\}; then D\\\\\\\\{\\\\mathcal J\\\\\\\\}=\\\\\\\\{\\\\emptyset,\\\\\\\\{1\\\\\\\\},\\\\\\\\{2,3,4\\\\\\\\},\\\\Omega\\\\\\\\}. == Dynkin's π-λ theorem == If P is a π-system and D is a Dynkin system with P\\\\subseteq D, then \\\\sigma\\\\\\\\{P\\\\\\\\}\\\\subseteq D. In other words, the σ-algebra generated by P is contained in D. One application of Dynkin's π-λ theorem is the uniqueness of a measure that evaluates the length of an interval (known as the Lebesgue measure): Let (Ω, B, λ) be the unit interval [0,1] with the Lebesgue measure on Borel sets. Let μ be another measure on Ω satisfying μ[(a,b)] = b − a, and let D be the family of sets S such that μ[S] = λ[S]. Let I = { (a,b),[a,b),(a,b],[a,b] : 0 < a ≤ b < 1 }, and observe that I is closed under finite intersections, that I ⊂ D, and that B is the σ-algebra generated by I. It may be shown that D satisfies the above conditions for a Dynkin-system. From Dynkin's π-λ Theorem it follows that D in fact includes all of B, which is equivalent to showing that the Lebesgue measure is unique on B. === Application to probability distributions === == See also == * Algebra of sets * δ-ring * Field of sets * π-system * Ring of sets * σ-algebra * σ-ring == Notes == == References == * * * Category:Set families Category:Probability theory Category:Lemmas ","title":"Dynkin system"},{"id":"2549194","text":"NGC 1300 is a barred spiral galaxy located about 61 million light-years away in the constellation Eridanus.

She is one of the first ordained lesbian women in the church and became a pastor before the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA) changed its policy on LGBT ministers. ==Early life and education== Hill was born in 1951 and was raised in the Roman Catholic faith in Shreveport, Louisiana. As a young adult, she lived in Crystal Springs, Mississippi, and became involved in the United Methodist Church. Hill attended Mississippi State University where she earned a bachelor's degree in science. Hill went on to gain a master's degree in religious studies and a master of divinity degree from United Theological Seminary of the Twin Cities and studied at Luther Seminary in St. Paul, Minnesota. ==Career== In the 1980s, Hill started out as a lay minister in the Saint Paul-Reformation Lutheran Church. By the 1990s, her congregation wanted her to be ordained despite rules against lesbian pastors in the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA) at the time. The church's head pastor, Paul Tidemann, created the goal for his church that it would have a non-celibate, openly gay minister by 1993. Hill was an open lesbian in a committed relationship. She was ordained on April 28, 2001, within the Extraordinary Lutheran Ministries but was later censured for her ordainment as an LGBT person. On September 18, 2010, she was formally inducted into the ELCA Clergy Roster. She left working at the church in 2012 and went on to fight a state constitutional amendment in her state which banned gay marriage. In 2012 Hill joined ReconcilingWorks as regional director for the St. Paul area and later became its deputy director. Hill was the subject of the 2003 documentary This Obedience, by filmmakers Jamie Lee and Dawn Mikkelson; the film chronicled Hill's openly gay status and the controversy it ignited within the church.

Note how it is upside down: this aids in the reading of the book when it is strung around the neck. This particular player is AS10 (Alto saxophone 10) A dot book (also dotbook or dot-book or drill book) is a small notebook utilized by marching bands (especially high school show bands and drum corps) in order to aid the learning of formations on a field. The dot book was invented by Leslie Allard, a prominent high school band instructor and all-star percussionist. The name is derived from the use of dots on drill sheets which symbolize players on the field: a dot book focuses on the owner's particular dots and other marchers the player may have to guide (use to determine an adjusted location). The general layout of a dot book contains the \\"longitudes\\" and \\"latitudes\\" of an American football field. However, a cartesian coordinate system (x/y) is rarely used, rather an alternative system of plotting players as dots on a grid and some jargon is used. For instance, a player may write: \\"3 inside 45R and 5 in front BH.\\" This would mean that the player is 3 steps inside (towards the 50 yard line) from the 45th yard line from the right side (facing the press box) and is five steps in front of the back hash (see Field and players of American football for an explanation of terms). Many times, however, a person's own dot book will contain their own specialized shorthand to represent their location on the field. Dot books can vary from simple (providing only the location of the marcher) to complex (also providing the location of nearby marchers whom you are guiding). This poses problems when players are switched between positions on the field: switching dot books is often difficult and many times players end up rewriting their dot books. Dot books are considered essential by many high school band instructors to the progress of drill. Severe penalties can be incurred for forgetting or losing one's dot book. Dot books also become irreplaceable as a season moves on: whenever drill is changed or a visual is added, the dot book becomes the sole record of this change. Loss of a dot book can result in the need for the band to readjust something that had been handled several months prior. ==From drill sheet to dot book== This is a sample page of a pack of drill sheets. The owner of this page is AS10, and their dot on the field has been circled accordingly. After looking at this page, AS10 wrote in their page on the dot book at the top of this article. Several notable features: * Reversal of field - This is because all players face the \\"box\\" or \\"Director Viewpoint\\" of a field. Therefore, a player facing the correct direction will normally never view the field in this way (which is backwards). * Smallness of dot book - Drill sheets are unwieldy to handle because of their size. The dot book overcomes this limitation through loss of data: by only focusing on your dot, and the dots that are around it, you can eliminate most of the other dots. In many ways, a dot book is simply a magnification of a small area of a drill sheet. * Division of five yards into eight steps: this is called an eight to five step. ==Coordinate Sheets== An alternative to the dot book is the coordinate sheet. Like dot books, coordinate sheets are small and meant to be worn around the neck on a lanyard. Coordinate sheets are set up as a list of the member's places on the field, given in coordinates (such as 5 steps inside the right 45 yard line and 2.25 steps in front of the Home hash), each \\"set\\" numbered. Also on the sheet is the number of steps it takes to go from one set to another, but this isn't written plainly. Set 1 always has a \\"0\\" by it. If it should take sixteen counts to move to the next set, a \\"16\\" will be placed next to Set 2's coordinates. If it should take eight counts to move to the third set, a \\"24\\" is next to Set 3's coordinates. ==External links== * My Dot Book - Order custom, fill-in-the-blank dot books for your band or drum corps * Google search - Information on dot books on the web is generally sparse because it is an internal feature of most marching band programs.

He previously served as a front- office assistant for the Cleveland Indians, Oakland Athletics, and New York Mets. DePodesta was also general manager of the Los Angeles Dodgers. The year after leading the Dodgers to their first playoff win in 16 years, he was fired after the 2005 club finished with its worst record in 11 years. He was the ninth general manager in the club's history since its move to Los Angeles. He is also known for his appearance in the book and movie Moneyball about his time with the Athletics. == Early life == DePodesta is a native of Alexandria, Virginia, where he grew up with Thad Levine. He attended Episcopal High School ('91) and then Harvard University, where he played baseball and football and graduated in 1995 with a degree in economics. He has worked for the Baltimore Stallions of the Canadian Football League and the Baltimore Bandits of the American Hockey League. ==Executive career== ===Major League Baseball=== ====Early career==== In 1996, DePodesta got his first baseball job with the Cleveland Indians, where he spent three seasons. He served as an advance scout for two years and in his final month with the club was appointed special assistant to general manager John Hart. In 1999, he joined the Oakland Athletics organization as an assistant to general manager Billy Beane. DePodesta was a key figure in Michael Lewis's book Moneyball. The book thrust the analytical principles of sabermetrics into the mainstream. ====Los Angeles Dodgers==== At the age of 31, DePodesta was named general manager of the Los Angeles Dodgers on February 16, 2004, making him the fifth-youngest general manager in baseball history, behind Jon Daniels (28) of the Texas Rangers, Theo Epstein (28) of the Boston Red Sox, Andrew Friedman (28) of the Tampa Bay Rays, and Randy Smith (29) of the San Diego Padres. DePodesta's reliance on sabermetric principles has been somewhat controversial. He is often considered part of a new breed of front-office executives whose personnel decisions depend heavily on analysis of performance data, often at the perceived expense of more traditional methods of scouting and observation. One of DePodesta's most notable moves was made at the 2004 trading deadline. He traded catcher Paul Lo Duca, relief pitcher Guillermo Mota and outfielder Juan Encarnación to the Florida Marlins in exchange for pitcher Brad Penny, first baseman Hee Seop Choi and pitcher Bill Murphy, in what was reportedly an attempt to pick up pieces to acquire pitcher Randy Johnson from the Arizona Diamondbacks. DePodesta was heavily criticized in the local and national baseball media for this trade, because Lo Duca was thought to be the \\"heart and soul\\" of the team. The Dodgers made the playoffs anyway, with Penny developing into one of the better pitchers in the National League during his stint with the Dodgers, which lasted until the end of the 2008 season. Choi, however, was a disappointment, batting just .161 in 2004 and .253 in 2005, and striking out 80 times in 320 at bats. Bill Murphy was traded that year to acquire Steve Finley, who hit 13 homers in 58 games, including a memorable grand slam that clinched the division title. Lo Duca played through 2005 with the Marlins and then went to the New York Mets, the Washington Nationals and back to the Marlins, making his final Major League appearance in September 2008. During the 2004 off-season, Adrián Beltré, who had hit 48 home runs in 2004, signed with Seattle as a free agent, spurning DePodesta's offer of 3 years for $30 million for Seattle's offer of 5 years for $64 million. DePodesta signed J. D. Drew, Jeff Kent, and Derek Lowe. Drew enjoyed two productive seasons as a Dodger and then used an opt-out clause in his contract to sign a new 5-year deal with the Boston Red Sox. Both Kent and Lowe put in four productive seasons for the Dodgers and cut ties with the franchise at the end of the 2008 season with Kent retiring and Lowe signing a contract with the Atlanta Braves. Coming off the successes of 2004, the 2005 season saw the Dodgers lose a number of players to significant stints on the disabled list. Many of the players lost to injury were expected to produce heavily for the team, including J. D. Drew, Milton Bradley, Éric Gagné, Jayson Werth, César Izturis and Odalis Pérez. The 2005 season resulted in the team's worst record since 1992 and second worst since moving to Los Angeles in 1958. On October 29, 2005, Dodgers owner Frank McCourt fired DePodesta, citing his desire to see the club win and that DePodesta had not met those expectations. Reports surfaced that the real reason McCourt had fired DePodesta was his inability to find satisfactory managerial candidates to replace Jim Tracy. He was later replaced by Ned Colletti, who hired Grady Little as manager. Some have speculated that McCourt fired DePodesta in response to media criticism from Los Angeles Times sports columnists T.J. Simers and Bill Plaschke, who were vehemently \\"anti-Moneyball\\" and referred to DePodesta pejoratively as \\"Google Boy.\\" ====San Diego Padres and New York Mets==== DePodesta with the San Diego Padres in 2008 On June 30, 2006, DePodesta was hired as the Special Assistant for Baseball Operations for the San Diego Padres and was promoted to Executive Vice President on November 10, 2008. On November 8, 2010, DePodesta was hired as the vice president of player development and scouting for the New York Mets by general manager Sandy Alderson, with whom DePodesta worked when Alderson was CEO of the Padres. ===National Football League=== ====Cleveland Browns==== On January 5, 2016, DePodesta was hired by the Cleveland Browns of the National Football League (NFL) as their chief strategy officer. ==Other ventures== ===Moneyball=== In 2003, author Michael Lewis was interested in how Oakland Athletics general manager (GM) Billy Beane tried to find quality players to improve the team while struggling with one of the smallest payrolls in Major League Baseball. He first wanted to write an article on the subject, but the idea eventually blossomed into a book named Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game. Lewis's interests included how Beane hired DePodesta as his assistant to incorporate sabermetrics, an approach that consists of more sophisticated analyses of baseball statistics, which is at least partially credited for their 2002 20-game winning streak which set an American League record. Lewis's book examines the lives and careers of various baseball personalities and explains the art of sabermetrics. Bill James, who coined the term sabermetrics for the Society for American Baseball Research (SABR), is also a major focus. James published The Bill James Baseball Abstract from 1977 to 1988 and wrote several sabermetrics books. Beane and DePodesta had studied James's work and were inspired by his knowledge of baseball analysis. DePodesta did not feel comfortable in the spotlight after the book's release, nor did he care for the secrets revealed about his scouting methods. The book earned DePodesta a reputation as a cold calculator, choosing players based only on their numbers. In addition, he was thought of as a guy who knew nothing of \\"real baseball.\\" In reality, DePodesta played football in college and wanted to be a football coach, seen in a photo wearing number 17. After graduating from Harvard with a degree in economics, he became an intern for the Canadian Football League's Baltimore Stallions in 1995. In early 1996, he got his first baseball job with the Cleveland Indians, where he worked as a scout. In October 1996, at age 24, he was promoted to the position of advance scout. In October 1998, he became assistant to the General Manager for the team. Those experiences led to him being hired by Beane as his assistant with the Oakland A's in November 1998. When the movie Moneyball was adapted from the book, DePodesta did not approve of the way his character was portrayed. \\"There were a handful of things. Some were factual, others were more ephemeral.\\" He had no objection to Jonah Hill's performance. \\"Jonah was awesome. He was so respectful of me and my time. It would have been flattering to be portrayed by someone of his expertise. It had nothing to do with the casting,\\" DePodesta said in 2010. \\"I just could never get comfortable with the idea of somebody else portraying me to the rest of the world. Like any movie, to make it interesting, there has to be some conflict there. In some respects, a lot of the conflict is going to revolve around my character, and that was never really the case in reality,\\" he said in 2011. He also talked about the focus that was brought on him, first in 2003 and again in 2011. \\"The other problem was I wasn't all that interested in the attention. It had already happened from the book. And I didn't necessarily need to relive it.\\" The role was originally going to be given DePodesta's name and portrayed by Demetri Martin, but DePodesta did not want his name or likeness to be used in the movie, so the character was named Peter Brand. Brand is a composite of Beane's assistants in Oakland, not an accurate representation of any specific person. But Moneyballs director, Bennett Miller, has credited DePodesta for being generous and helpful in the making of the film. Hill was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance. == Personal life == DePodesta is married to artist and philanthropist Karen Deicas and has three sons and a daughter. In 2016, Deicas launched the Sports Mind Institute, which seeks to connect lessons learned from figures in professional sports, athletes, team executives, and coaches, to help others apply them to life and the business sector. The family resides in the La Jolla neighborhood of San Diego, California. On December 13, 2012, DePodesta was elected to the Board of Directors of Sears Holdings Corporation. He has also served as a keynote speaker at numerous business conventions and been recognized by several publications, including Baseball Prospectus and Fortune Magazine, which named him one of the Top 10 innovators under the age of 40. He appeared uncredited on several episodes of Homicide: Life on the Street. == References == == External links == *Official Padres biography *The Genesis, Implementation, and Management of New Systems Category:1972 births Category:Living people Category:American football wide receivers Category:Baltimore Bandits Category:Cleveland Browns executives Category:Episcopal High School (Alexandria, Virginia) alumni Category:Harvard University alumni Category:Harvard Crimson football players Category:Los Angeles Dodgers executives Category:Major League Baseball executives Category:Major League Baseball general managers Category:New York Mets executives Category:Oakland Athletics executives Category:San Diego Padres executives ","title":"Paul DePodesta"},{"id":"2549242","text":"Jacques Joseph Champollion-Figeac (), also known as Champollion l'aîné ('the Elder'; 5 October 1778 – 9 May 1867) was a French archaeologist, elder brother of Jean-François Champollion (decipherer of the Rosetta Stone). ==Biography== He was born at Figeac in the département of Lot.

Written by ornithologist James Bond, the book was first published in 1936 by the Academy of Natural Sciences as part of the International Series. It was reprinted in 1947 by Macmillan as Field Guide of Birds of the West Indies and has been reprinted several times since then, including as one of the Peterson Field Guides series (PFG 18), a September 1, 1999, edition from Houghton Mifflin and a March 4, 2002 edition from Collins. The book contains approximately 256 pages. The book was the only text exclusively devoted to the avifauna of the region for many decades until A Guide to the Birds of the West Indies (), by Herbert Raffaele et al.., was published in 1998. ==Inspiration for Ian Fleming== Birds of the West Indies was a book owned by novelist Ian Fleming, who used the ornithologist's name for his own fictional British secret agent character, Commander James Bond.* Fleming, a keen bird watcher while living at his estate in Jamaica, owned this book. He later explained that the author's name was \\"brief, unromantic, Anglo- Saxon, and yet very masculine – just what I needed.\\" Fleming once said in a Reader's Digest interview: \\"I wanted the simplest, dullest, plainest-sounding name I could find, and 'James Bond' was much better than something more interesting, like 'Peregrine Carruthers.' Exotic things would happen to and around him, but he would be a neutral figure — an anonymous, blunt instrument wielded by a government department.\\" The book has since become a collector's item amongst Bond fans and was featured as an homage in the twentieth James Bond film, Die Another Day, when Bond poses as an ornithologist while in Cuba. The final shot of the miniseries Fleming: The Man Who Would Be Bond is of a copy of Birds of the West Indies next to Ian Fleming's typewriter. ==See also== *Inspirations for James Bond ==References== ==External links== *A Field Guide to the Birds of the West Indies by James Bond, published by HMCo Field Guides, 1999 (Limited view) Category:1936 non-fiction books Category:1999 non- fiction books Category:2002 non-fiction books Category:Bird field guides Category:Books about the Caribbean Category:Ornithological handbooks ","title":"Birds of the West Indies"},{"id":"2549274","text":"thumb Large format lenses are photographic optics that provide an image circle large enough to cover large format film or plates. Large format lenses are typically used in large format cameras and view cameras. Photographic optics generally project a circular image behind the lens. On smaller format cameras the image circle generally covers only the intended film size with little room to spare. Large format lenses are an exception. For large format use the circular patch of image light usually extends beyond the minimum size circle needed to fully cover the rectangle of the film. The extra image offers room to spare to make use of camera movements that re-align the lens away from dead center on the film. ==Lens designs== Lenses of the same general construction are often given a name implying this design. For example, a Tessar always has four elements in three groups as described below, although Tessars have been produced with different focal lengths and maximum apertures for many decades. Sometimes a name does not identify a specific design; Kodak's Ektar lens brand name encompasses many different types. Sometimes different manufacturers use different names for lenses of the same type; for example the Voigtländer Skopar is of Tessar design. And sometimes identical lenses are sold under different names and at different prices; for example, lenses branded as Rodenstock and Caltar. Early lenses suffered from flare and low contrast, worsening as the number of lens-air interfaces increased. The introduction of and improvements in anti-reflective coatings vastly reduced flare; some many- element lens designs which had been abandoned due to low contrast in spite of otherwise excellent performance became practical. Lenses designed for use with monochromatic film, first orthochromatic, then panchromatic, had less exacting requirements regarding chromatic aberrations than when colour film is used. When using older lenses today one should check that chromatic aberrations and flare are acceptable for the application. ===Wide-angle lens designs=== *The Hypergon is a wide angle lens that covers a flat field. It is constructed symmetrically consisting of two deep meniscus elements that almost form a sphere. The aperture is limited to f/20 due to spherical and chromatic aberrations. *The Topogon is a double Gauss design arranged in a symmetrical design. Due to its wide angle coverage, and the small distortion, it and the Metrogon became the standard aerial lens until it was displaced in 1952. *The Hologon is a modification of the Biogon lens design. It contains a rear element that is close to film plane for better contrast, but interferes with mirror for SLR. There is significant light falloff at edges, so it is frequently used with ND center graduated filters. *The Biogon is an ultra- wide-angle design by Ludwig Bertele based on a double-ended reversed-telephoto objective. It was made by Zeiss for their 35mm Contax and the medium-format Hasselblad cameras. The design was physically large, being two focal lengths in length and one focal length in diameter. There are two menisci at the front, and a single strong meniscus element at the rear. The rear element is close to the film plane for low distortion and better contrast, but interferes with the mirror on a single-lens reflex camera. *The Goerz Dagor has two symmetrical, cemented triplets (6 elements in 2 groups). The two outer elements are positive, one of the inner elements is used to correct spherical aberration, and the other to flatten the field. There are only 4 glass-to-air interfaces, giving better flare and contrast than lenses with more elements, particularly important before the introduction of coated lenses. Reputed to have good sharpness and a large image circle, although there is softness at the edges. File:Hypergon.pngHypergon File:Topogon.pngTopogon File:Hologon.pngHologon File:Biogon21.pngBiogon File:Dagor.pngDagor ===Normal lens designs=== *Anastigmat is an achromatic lens used to reduce or eliminate astigmatism designed specifically for photographic applications. All modern lenses are anastigmatic; lenses produced in the early days when this was a new feature often had the word Anastigmat in their name: Voigtländer Anastigmat Skopar. *A Tessar comprises four elements in three groups, one positive crown glass element on the front, one negative flint glass element at the center and a negative plano-concave flint glass element cemented with a positive convex crown glass element at the rear. Many manufacturers have produced lenses of this type under their own names. The Tessar design is suitable for front-element focussing, but unit focussing is used on large format cameras. *The Heliar design consists of 5 elements in three groups with cemented doublets, allowing correction of spherical, chromatic, and astigmatic aberrations. * A Planar design is one with 4 groups of 6 elements, and a flat field design. Its symmetrical optical configuration produces low spherical aberration and astigmatism. The design was not widely used until coating processes were available, due to the very low contrast caused by light loss from the large number of transmission surfaces. *The Sonnar design originally had six elements, later seven, in three groups. The design uses fewer elements than the Planar design and is smaller and less expensive. It has more aberrations but better contrast and less flare than the Planar, a larger maximum aperture and lower chromatic aberration than the Tessar. Large format Sonnars have good sharpness and contrast at large apertures, but are large and heavy, and coverage does not allow much use of movements. The Sonnar has good edge contrast at all apertures, but some softness at wide apertures. *The Artar is a true apochromatic 4-element in 4 groups symmetrical process lens for the graphic arts, very well corrected for other aberrations. It was designed by Walter Zschokke of Goerz in 1904, based on Emile Von Hoegh's dialyte. If uncoated it is subject to flare due to the 8 air-to-glass surfaces.

The Festival has an education focus. All ensembles receive either a Gold, Silver, Bronze, Merit or Participation shield. The Melbourne School Band festival is the brain child of Barry Croll and Douglas Heywood who created the idea and event under the Music Junction Blackburn Banner in 1989 to support the ongoing development of music education in schools. The festival was produced and sponsored by Billy Hyde Music Foundation, until their parent company Billy Hyde went into liquidation in 2012. In 2008, the Festival's 20th anniversary, over 300 concert bands, jazz ensembles and string ensembles performed at the Robert Blackwood Concert Hall and School of Music Auditorium, Monash University. Since the inception of the festival in 1989 the number of students electing to learn an instrument through their school music program has increased substantially. The festival is now one of Australia's most prestigious musical events for school musicians. The festival is designed to support and develop instrumental music education. Not only do students have the opportunity to perform at Australia's finest venues (acoustic-wise), but they receive adjudication from an outstanding panel of adjudicators. The festival runs for two weeks until the Festival Finale on the last Saturday of August. The Finale showcases the most outstanding ensembles from the Festival and features the distribution of the awards.

The Sledmere Monument is about south-east of the village, along the B1252 road, on top of Garton Hill. It is tall and is a tribute to Sir Tatton Sykes, 4th Baronet, built by his friends in 1865. The Wagoners' Memorial in the village, designed by Sir Mark Sykes, 6th Baronet, is dedicated to the Wolds Wagoners Reserve, a corps that Sir Mark raised from the local population to fight in the First World War. It is noted for its unusual shape and its graphic scenes of war and country life. The memorial was designated a Grade II listed building in September 1966, but upgraded to Grade I in March 2016. Sledmere is also the site of the Eleanor Cross, Sledmere, a replica Eleanor cross designated a Grade II listed building in September 1966, but upgraded to Grade I in March 2016. Sledmere Cross The 'Sledmere Cross' takes the form of an Eleanor Cross and is a true 'folly' that was 'converted' in 1919 to a War Memorial by Sir Mark Sykes (of the Sykes–Picot Agreement) who added a series of brass portraits in commemoration of his friends and the local men who fell in the war and also notably himself in crusader armour with the inscription “Laetare Jerusalem (Rejoice Jerusalem)”. East of the village is Sledmere Castle, a folly built around 1790 by John Carr for Sir Christopher Sykes, the 2nd baronet, to enhance the view from Sledmere House. The church of St Mary is one of the churches on the Sykes Churches Trail. In 1966 the church was designated a Grade II* listed building. Sledmere was served by Sledmere and Fimber railway station on the Malton and Driffield Railway between 1853 and 1950. == Images of Sledmere == File:Sledmere, Waggoners' Monument.JPGWolds Wagoners Reserve war memorial File:Sledmere_Castle.jpgSledmere Castle File:Sledmere House - geograph.org.uk - 1393059.jpgSledmere House File:Butchers shop, Sledmere - geograph.org.uk - 1012129.jpgButchers shop File:Estate Cottages near Warren Farm - geograph.org.uk - 253096.jpg File:Dew Pond. - geograph.org.uk - 1035914.jpg ==References== * == External links == * * Yorkshire Wolds Villages * Sledmore estate papers - University of Hull. * Yorkshire Wolds Wagoners. * - Radio4 programme presented by Melvyn Bragg on the Wolds Wagoners.

It was founded on the shores of Lake Biscotasi on the Spanish River in 1884 by Canadian Pacific Railway as a railway construction town, and the first divisional point west of Sudbury. The rails of westward track laying gangs reached this area in October 1884. Biscotasing is an access point for canoeists, fishermen, and back-country campers to the area including Biscotasi Lake Provincial Park. It has one general store that functions as the post office, tackle shop, grocery store and Liquor Control Board of Ontario (LCBO) outlet; a community centre; a church; and the one-room Biscotasing railway station served by Via Rail. The town also is accessible by floatplane and by a long drive on the Sultan Industrial Road. Although the year-round population is only 22, during the summer season, the population swells to around 300, mostly tourists. ==History== The early development of Biscotasing was dictated solely by the needs of the railway. The CPR acquired a parcel of land at Biscotasing in 1884 and by November had cleared . A frame station the size of 30 × , was constructed, with offices upstairs, a large freight shed 40 × , a telegraph office, several residences for company officials and a number of boarding houses were completed before the end of that year. A wye track had also been installed to allow work trains to turn around prior to returning to the east. Later a roundhouse was built to service the locomotives. In his book The Last Spike historian Pierre Berton wrote about Biscotasing, as it was 1885-04-01, when the first soldiers on their way to the North-West Rebellion passed through. See page 368. As a divisional point, Biscotasing did not last much beyond the era of construction, as Chapleau, about midway between Sudbury and Lake Superior, was selected to replace it. Soon after, the town lost its importance as a railroad town but still existed as a quiet fur trading town. The railway provided an inland access point to waterways flowing south to Lake Huron and north to James Bay, and the town subsequently developed as a centre for Indian trade in the region. The local water routes also helped to develop Biscotasing as a major centre for lumbering. In 1884, Public Lands Surveyor James Allan noted that timber in the area had been overrun by fires and was of very little value, consisting mostly of scrubby spruce and small pitch pine. The same year a sawmill was in operation at Biscotasing, mostly to serve the requirements of CPR construction. The first permanent sawmill was established by Sadler and O'Neil in the early 1890s. Robert Booth and Patrick Shannon, were also actively logging this region from 1895. Booth and Shannon produced square timber, which was taken by CPR to Papineauville for export to Britain, from the Port of Quebec in Quebec. By 1903 Booth and Shannon were the only lumber producers in Biscotasing, possibly having taken over and expanding the O'Neil mill which closed in 1898. The original Booth and Shannon mill was destroyed by fire 1913-06-13. It was subsequently rebuilt, at which time Robert Booth left the partnership, with Patrick's son, the firm was reorganized as P. & G. Shannon. In 1923 the mill was sold to Midland lumbermen Pratt and Shanacy. The mill closed in 1927 for lack of timber. The mill was dismantled and removed by 1938. Many of the old buildings in Biscotasing that survive today are from the sawmill era. A small steam locomotive, once used to switch cars of lumber from the mill to the lumber piling grounds, sat for many years, derelict on the mill property, across the tracks, opposite the Pratt and Shanacy company store. In 1958, David L. Pratt, of Toronto donated his father's steam engine for display at the Algonquin Provincial Park Logging Museum. From railway construction camp, to fur trade depot and lumbering centre, in 1922 Biscotasing became the first place in Northern Ontario to use aircraft (Curtiss NC) for forest fire surveillance. ==References== * * ==External links== Category:Communities in Sudbury District Category:Hudson's Bay Company trading posts ","title":"Biscotasing, Ontario"},{"id":"2549312","text":"In number theory, a provable prime is an integer that has been calculated to be prime using a primality-proving algorithm.

For use by search engines and other crawlers, there is a structured format, the XML Sitemap, which lists the pages in a site, their relative importance, and how often they are updated. This is pointed to from the robots.txt file and is typically called sitemap.xml .

The Sitemap files contains URLs to these pages so that web crawlers can find them. Bing, Google, Yahoo and Ask now jointly support the Sitemaps protocol.

They were one of Australia's most well-known ska bands and one of the most popular Christian bands in the country.Robinson, Rowan (2005-11-24), \\"Sounds Like Chicken - Fowl Play\\", X Press Magazine, Columbia Press (980):26 They were signed to Boomtown Records. Sounds Like Chicken's musical style included a blend of Ska, Hardcore, Reggae and Rock. The band placed a high emphasis on touring and were known for their \\"high energy\\" live performances. Sounds Like Chicken shared stages and toured with such bands, including Reel Big Fish, Mad Caddies, Crowned King, Hilltop Hoods, Kisschasy, Area-7, Gyroscope, Bodyjar, 28 Days, Killing Heidi, The O.C. Supertones, and Antiskeptic. Sounds like Chicken also had rotation on the radio station Triple J, mainly with their double A-side single \\"Take a Bullet to the Grave\\"/\\"El Chupanebre\\" and their other single \\"Global Domination\\". After their breakup, SLC released all their previous recordings under Creative Commons (by-nc-sa), for free online distribution. The band reformed for a once-off show on 11 May 2014 as a benefit for independent record store Fist2face. ==History== Sounds Like Chicken playing at the Blackstump Christian Musical Festival 2006 ===Early band history=== Sounds Like Chicken began in 1999 when Nathanael Kitingan (Nat Kitingan) met Nyall Dawson at Monash University in Melbourne. Nat and Nyall attempted to start an unnamed musical project with Hugh Ogilvy (also from Monash University) featuring Nyall on electric violin, Hugh on guitar and Nat on drums. This trio did not get off the ground and so brothers Joel and Elliot Dawson joined to form Sounds Like Chicken, a ska project taking influences from Voodoo Glow Skulls, The O.C. Supertones, The Insyderz and Five Iron Frenzy. This early lineup was Nyall (vocals), Nat (bass/vocals), Elliot (drums), Joel (sax) and Hugh (guitar). Sounds Like Chicken's first show was at Joel's 21st birthday party in mid-2000. Hugh left the band at the end of 2000 due to other commitments and was replaced by Tom Dowding on guitar. Tom was an extremely accomplished bass player and so Nat decided to swap to playing guitar so that Tom's talent could be fully utilised. The band decided they needed another horn and so after a number of unsuccessful audition attempts, in 2001 Nat met Natalie Parker at university and invited her to a practice. Natalie was initially apprehensive but was eventually convinced by the boys to join the band. During her second practice she was already laying down trumpet tracks on their first demo recording which ended up becoming the band's self-made demo EP, Slowly Going the Way of the Chicken. Sounds Like Chicken toured interstate for the first time under this lineup in September 2001, playing in Sydney and Canberra and also at the Black Stump Music Festival. In 2002, Tom Dowding departed from Sounds like Chicken to be replaced by Joshua Diemar on bass. It was in this year that Sounds Like Chicken released their first studio EP, I Am Gibbon, Hear Me Roar, produced by David Carr (Antiskeptic, Taxiride). The EP gave the band airplay on community radio, Christian radio, and Triple J. ===Boomtown Records era and lineup changes=== In early 2004, the band were signed to Boomtown Records, a Melbourne-based indie record label distributing through Shock Records and MGM. Deciding that a bigger ensemble was required, Sounds Like Chicken asked long-time friend Dave Powys (ex Staff Discount and Never in Doubt) to join on second guitar, making them a 7-piece band. Dave moved down from Canberra and recorded on the single Global Domination, their first release with Boomtown and distributed through MGM. The single received national airplay and spot airplay on Triple J and was sold out within 2 months of its limited pressing.Chapman, Stephanie (2005-11-30), \\"Sounds Like Chicken\\", Base.ad 1(11):4 It was noted that producer Dave Carr's production was a big step up from previous releases,.\\"CD Reviews, Sounds Like Chicken - Global Domination\\", page 23. Bizoo (19), June/July 2004 It was shortly after this that the band decided it was time to move on and the band was without a bass-player. They were booked in to record an album and so asked if Carlos Echeverria (ex Know Exit and Wishful Thinking) would fill in and record bass for them. Their first full-length album, ...Like a Cannonball to the Ocean Floor was released late that year through Boomtown, also doing well on the airwaves. The album drew acclaim from reviewers as a \\"brilliantly released debut album\\",Clements, Jaymz (2004-12-01), \\"Albums\\", Beat Magazine (939) although the length of 17 tracks drew some criticism. Sounds Like Chicken did a joint national tour with label-mates Wishful Thinking to launch the album. Carlos officially joined shortly after the album's release. In early 2005 founding member and manager, Elliot, decided to part ways with the band. Mike \\"Carcass\\" Haydon (of Melbourne band The Knockabouts), only 17 at the time, was able to fill the role of drummer. Mike had been a tour roadie for the band for the past 3 years and so was already well-acquainted with their songs. That year Sounds Like Chicken released the second double-A side single off the album, Take a Bullet to the Grave/El Chupanebre through Boomtown Records, and completed a national tour over 3 months to launch it. On 3 November 2006, founding member, Nyall Dawson, announced his decision to depart the band early in 2007. Sounds Like Chicken have played and toured with numerous well-known Australian and international acts and have been featured on various international and Australian compilations and soundtracks such as Turn the Other Cheek Volume 1. ==Break up== On 18 December 2006 Sounds Like Chicken announced they were calling it a day in a bulletin released on the band's MySpace. The main factors in the breakup was the future departure of Nyall Dawson and other key members of the band, the band stated: \\"We guess it’s time for some of us to move on. There was other plans for our lives and with the impending departure of some key members, we felt that SLC would simply not be SLC if we went on without them. We all feel at peace about this decision.\\" Shortly after, the band announced plans for an Australia wide farewell tour to take place in February–March 2007, along with the release of a final limited- edition compilation disk titled Death to the Crow to coincide with the tour.(2007-03-07)\\"Backline Independent Music News - Expired Chicken\\", Inpress Magazine (958): 104 Sounds Like Chicken's final show was held at TLC Bayswater, Victoria on Saturday 17 March 2007.

In April 2007, former SLC members Mike Haydon, Dave Powys, Ben Hobson, Nat Kitingan and Joel Dawson together with new addition Paul McCasker formed reggae band San Salvador. They released an EP How To Hear, two singles \\"Like a Train\\" and \\"Spark the Fire\\" and later the mini-album \\"Rugged Are The Mountains\\". Former members Mike Haydon and Joe Ireland later joined indie band The Middle East which featured two tracks in Triple J's hottest 100 in 2010. Dave Powys also went on to join indie folk band The Paper Kites. ==Reunion show== On 31 March 2014 it was announced on the band's fan- run Facebook page that they were reforming for a once off show on 11 May 2014 as a benefit for Fist2face record store.

This was followed by a second EP, White Arrows in August. There was a brief line-up change; Tee left the band, being replaced by Tristan Ross for about six months. Under the management of Kaay, the band toured the east coast extensively. According to Allmusic's reviewer, Johnny Loftus, \\"the band's hard-hitting, gristly sound – led by Ox's vocal seethe – caught the interest of American majors\\". By the end of the year, Tee rejoined and the band moved to Los Angeles where they were signed to Columbia Records (SonyBMG) and released their self-titled album, Full Scale, on 8 March 2005.

It is named after Bishop Silas Chatard, who was the first Bishop of Indianapolis, and oversaw the movement of the diocese from Vincennes to Indianapolis in 1898. ==School history== The increase in Indiana's Catholic population that triggered the splitting of the Indianapolis diocese in 1944 also caused an increase in the need for Catholic schools. It was clear that one high school would not be sufficient to provide for Indianapolis' massively expanding Catholic population. To this end, the Archbishop of Indianapolis, Paul Clarence Schulte, ordered the construction of three new Catholic high schools in the city. The first of these, Bishop Chatard, would serve the north side of Indianapolis. The two other new schools, Roncalli High School and Cardinal Ritter High School, would serve the south and west sides of Indianapolis respectively. Scecina would continue to serve the east side of the city. Ground was broken for the first of the schools, Bishop Chatard, in the fall of 1960 on diocese property at the corner of Crittenden and Kessler Avenues. Construction of the school and an adjacent convent was completed in less than a year, and the first students were admitted in September 1961. Each year a class of students was added to the school, and the first graduating class was the class of 1964-65. Over the years, many improvements were made to the school facility as the number of students rose. Initially, classes were taught almost entirely by priests from the Archdiocese of Indianapolis and Benedictine Sisters of Beech Grove. Many sisters were housed in the convent on-site, but their numbers declined to the point that in the 1970s, their convent was converted to an annex of the school. The annex has served as classroom, office and storage space for thirty years, and was recently rededicated to the Sisters as the St. Benedict Center. By 1997, the school was showing its age. Paint was peeling, windows and roofs were leaky, and facilities sorely needed an upgrade. To remedy the situation and remodel the 35-year-old building, school administrators embarked on a $2 million capital campaign to pay for new windows, a new roof, electrical improvements, and other needed renovations. These were undertaken over the summer, and when students arrived to begin the 1997-1998 school year, they were in what was virtually a whole new building. In 1999, improvements continued with the opening of the new fine arts addition. A new band room, art studio, and library were added, as were six new classrooms and an elevator to make the building handicap-accessible. This was paid for by a $1.5 million building drive made possible by alumni donations. In the summer of 2005, and completed over the 2007-08 school year, a campaign involved the construction of an additional elevator to allow better access to classrooms for handicapped students and a remodeling of the cafeteria and several hallways. A new auxiliary gymnasium was paid for by alumni donations and a slight tuition increase. In 2011, President Bill Sahm announced the “Golden Opportunities Campaign,” to address several issues including the creation of a tuition assistance endowment and a teacher compensation endowment. The Campaign also addressed improvements to the academic environment including the addition of robust wireless network throughout the two buildings, new servers and expanded student and teacher access to 21st century computers in the classrooms and labs. The Campaign also addressed the needs of the athletic community with the addition of a competition track and fields including a new turf field and all- weather track with bleacher seating for 900, stadium lighting and a concession/restroom facility, as well as a turf baseball field and a one-mile walk/run trail. ==Academics== Bishop Chatard has been accredited by AdvancED or its predecessors since April 2004. ==Demographics== The demographic breakdown of the 691 students enrolled in 2015-2016 was: *Asian/Pacific islanders - 0.9% *Black - 11.7% *Hispanic - 3.3% *White - 80.6% *Multiracial - 3.5% ==Athletics== The Bishop Chatard Trojans compete in the Circle City Conference. School colors are royal blue and white. The following Indiana High School Athletic Association (IHSAA) sanctioned sports are offered: *Baseball (boys) *Basketball (girls and boys) **Boys state championships - 2003 *Cross country (girls and boys) *Football (boys) **State championships - 1983, 1984, 1997, 1998, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2006, 2007, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2015, 2019 *Golf (girls and boys) *Soccer (girls and boys) *Softball (girls) *Swimming (girls and boys) *Tennis - (girls and boys) *Track - (girls and boys) *Volleyball (girls) **State championships - 2004, 2012 *Wrestling (boys) ==Student activities== Chatard competes annually in the Brain Game, a quiz bowl program broadcast on local television.

He is the founder and artistic director of Garth Fagan Dance, a modern dance company based in Rochester, New York. ==Biography== ===Early years=== Fagan was born in Kingston, Jamaica to Oxford educated S.W. Fagan, former Chief Education Officer of Jamaica, and Louise I. Walker. It was a gymnastics class that initially drew his attention to dance early on. While attending Excelsior High school, he studied with Ivy Baxter at the Jamaica National Dance Company and performed at the inauguration of Cuban President Fidel Castro in 1959. Fagan was educated at Wayne State University in Detroit, Michigan where he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree with sights on becoming a psychologist. ===Career=== Fagan worked at several dance companies in Detroit, and moved to Rochester New York in 1970, and there established his dance company originally named the \\"Bottom of the Bucket BUT ... Dance Theatre\\" in 1970. He was a Professor, at State University of New York, Brockport starting in 1970. Fagan choreographed for the Dance Theatre of Harlem, the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, and the Limón Dance Company in the 1970s. He has studied the works of Isadora Duncan, Martha Graham, Pearl Primus, Alvin Ailey, José Limón, and Katherine Dunham. He is also influenced by Caribbean and West African dances. Fagan's choreography incorporates elements of modern dance, ballet, Afro-Caribbean dance, and social dance. Many of his works are autobiographical or include themes of personal relevance. His untitled 1977 work chronicles the dissolution of his marriage, showing a couple beginning a relationship with affection and passion but eventually drifting apart due to inevitable obstacles. Griot New York, which premiered in 1991 at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, is about the experiences of the underprivileged living in New York City. The piece juxtaposes linear balletic movement with sharp angular gestures, twitching, and erotic partnering to represent the diversity and contrast found in big cities as well as conflict in his own life. In Moth Dreams, choreographed in 1992, Fagan celebrates his childhood, adolescence, and relationship with his mother. ===Personal life=== Fagan resides in Rochester, New York, is now divorced, and has two children. ==Stage productions== *From Before (1978) *Oatka Trail (1979) *Prelude (1981, revised 1983) *Touring Jubilee 1924 (Professional) (1982) *Sonata and the Afternoon (1983) *Never Top 40 (Jukebox) (1985) *Passion Distanced (1987) *Time After Before Place (1988) *Until By & If (1990) *Griot New York (1991) *Moth Dreams (1992) * Draft of Shadows (1993) * Postcards: Pressures and Possibilities (1994) * Earth Eagle First Circle (1995) * Mix 25 (1996) * Nkanyit (1997) * The Lion King (1997) *Two Pieces of One: Green (1998) *Woza (1999) *Trips and Trysts (2000) *Music of the Line/Words in the Shape (2001) *Translation Transition (2002) *DANCECOLLAGEFORROMIE (2003) *----ING (2004) *Life: Dark/Light (2005) *Senku (2006) *Edge/Joy (2007) *Prelude (1993) * Phone Tag Thanks and Things(2009) ==Honours and awards== Fagan is a Distinguished University Professor at the State University of New York at Brockport.

Showing on the far wall is Sir Joshua Reynolds' Frances Anne Crewe (miss Greville), as St. Genevieve, c1773. A photograph of the hall, circa 1870. Loton Park is a country house near Alberbury, Shrewsbury in Shropshire, on the upper reaches of the River Severn. It is a Grade II* listed building. It has been the seat of the Leighton family since 1391. It stands in of parkland which includes one of the two privately owned deer parks to remain in Shropshire and is notable for its population of red kites. ==History== Loton Hall, 1796 The estate is mentioned in the Domesday Book. The core of the present house dates from the 17th century, though significant remodelling was carried out throughout the 19th century. The ruins of an earlier castle, built in 1340, survive in the grounds. The north front was built in 1712 by Sir Edward Leighton, 2nd Baronet, who moved his family seat here from Wattlesborough Castle, and was High Sheriff of Shropshire for 1727. In 1805, the 5th Baronet entertained the Prince Regent and the Duke of Clarence at Loton. Sir Baldwin Leighton, 6th Baronet was wounded in the American War of Independence, was a Brigadier in Portugal and Governor of Carrickfergus Castle. The house is currently the home of Sir Michael Leighton, 11th Baronet. The estate is also prominent in motorsport as the location of the Loton Park Hill Climb. ==Architectural== Loton Hall is a Grade II*-listed building, dated c.1670. A country house, originally with a U-shaped plan, a large wing was added to the southeast in 1872–73. The house is built in red brick with dressings in red and grey sandstone and a tile roof. The earlier part has a plinth, quoins, chamfered, coped and parapeted gables with finials. There are two storeys, a basement and attics, and a front of five bays, the outer bays projecting and gabled. In the centre is a three-bay loggia-porch that has arches with imposts, Tuscan columns, an entablature, and a balustrade. Above, the central window has Corinthian columns and a broken triangular pediment containing a cartouche, and above that is a gabled half-dormer. The later wing to the right has one storey with attics, and nine bays, and contains gables, mullioned and transomed windows, and a full-height canted bay window. ==See also== *Grade II* listed buildings in Shropshire Council (H–Z) *Listed buildings in Alberbury with Cardeston ==References== * English Heritage:Images of England, detailed architectural description ==External links== * \\"A family story told in stone - GARETH WILLIAMS visits the home of generations of Leightons\\" *www.geograph.co.uk : photos of Loton Park and surrounding area Category:Country houses in Shropshire Category:Grade II* listed buildings in Shropshire ","title":"Loton Park"},{"id":"2549393","text":"The alt attribute is the HTML attribute used in HTML and XHTML documents to specify alternative text (alt text) that is to be rendered when the element to which it is applied cannot be rendered. The alt attribute is used by \\"screen reader\\" software so that a person who is listening to the content of a webpage (for instance, a person who is blind) can interact with this element. Every image should have an alt attribute to be accessible, but it need not contain text. It can be an empty or null attribute: \`alt=\`.\\"Alternative Text\\", WebAIM, last updated 3 September 2015. The attribute was introduced in HTML 2 and in HTML 4.01 was required for the \`img\` and \`area\` tags. It is optional for the \`input\` tag and the deprecated \`applet\` tag. ==Example== alt=In the sky flies a red flag with a white cross whose vertical bar is shifted toward the flagpole. Here is an image for which the alt attribute is \\"In the sky flies a red flag with a white cross whose vertical bar is shifted toward the flagpole.\\" The HTML for this image might be something like the following: ![In the sky flies a red flag with a white cross whose vertical bar is shifted toward the flagpole.](http://upload.a.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/83/Dannebrog.jpg/180px- Dannebrog.jpg) This paragraph as seen in the Lynx web browser, which displays the alt text instead of the image. A visually impaired reader using a screen reader such as Orca will hear the alt text in place of the image. A text browser such as Lynx will display the alt text instead of the image. A graphical browser typically will display only the image, and will display the alt text only if the user asks it to show the image's properties or has configured the browser not to display images, or if the browser was unable to retrieve or to decode the image. An alternative alt attribute value would be \\"The Danish flag\\". ==Common misconceptions== The \`alt\` attribute does not always have to literally describe the contents of the image. Keep in mind the purpose and context of the image and what would be useful to someone who cannot see it. The alt attribute is supposed to be an alternative for the image, usually stating its purpose. For example, an image of a warning sign should not have alt text “a triangle with a yellow background, black border and an exclamation mark”, but simply “Warning!”—unless, of course, the image's purpose is to show what the warning symbol actually looks like. IE7 renders the alt attribute as tooltip Internet Explorer 7 and earlier render text in alt attributes as tooltip text, which is not standards-compliant. This behavior led many web developers to misuse alt when they wished to display tooltips containing additional information about images, Bug 25537 - Alt text is not displayed as a tooltip over , Mozilla bugzilla instead of using the \`title\` attribute that was intended for that use. As of Internet Explorer 8 alt attributes no longer render as tooltips. The alt attribute is commonly, but incorrectly, referred to as the \\"alt tag\\". == Decorative images == The W3C recommends that images that convey no information, but are purely decorative, be specified in CSS rather than in the HTML markup. However, it may sometimes be necessary to include a decorative image as an HTML \`img\` tag. In this case, if the image truly does not add to the content, then a blank alt attribute should be included in the form of \`alt=\\"\\"\`. This makes the page navigable for users of screen readers or non-graphical browsers. If (in breach of the standard) no alt attribute has been supplied, then browsers that cannot display the image will still display something there, e.g. the URL of the image, or a fixed text string. ==See also== *\`longdesc\` attribute ==Notes== ==References== * Including an image: the \`IMG\` element (specially, How to specify alternate text) from the HTML 4.01 specification * The \`img\` element (specially, Requirements for providing text to act as an alternative for images) from the HTML 5 specification * Techniques for WCAG 2.0 (specially, H37: Using \`alt\` attributes on \`img\` elements) * Providing text equivalents for images from Dive Into Accessibility * Appropriate Use of Alternative Text from WebAIM * Guidelines on alt texts in \`img\` elements by Jukka Korpela * Alternative text for images: the alt attribute by Estelle Weyl * Mini-FAQ about the alternate text of images by Ian Hickson ==External links== *Handy bookmarklets for alt attribute management Category:HTML Category:Computer- related introductions in 1995 Category:Web accessibility ","title":"Alt attribute"},{"id":"2549412","text":"The Runaway in Oz is an Oz book by long-time Oz illustrator John R. Neill. It was written originally during 1943 and was meant to be the thirty-seventh book in the Oz series. However, Neill died before he could edit or illustrate the book.\\"John R. Neill's Sketches for The Runaway in Oz,\\" The Baum Bugle, Vol. 45 No. 3 (Winter 2001), pp. 24-7. Oz publisher Reilly & Lee decided not to publish the book due to shortages caused by World War II. The text remained a possession of Neill's family. In 1995, the book was published by Oz specialty house Books of Wonder with illustrations by Eric Shanower.Eric Shanower, \\"The Wicked Witch, The Runaway, and Me,\\" The Baum Bugle, Vol. 45 No. 3 (Winter 2001), pp. 13-23. Shanower also edited and expanded Neill's text. Another version exists, printed privately, with different editing by Fred M. Meyer, longtime Secretary of The International Wizard of Oz Club. ==Synopsis== On the eve of an important ceremony in the Emerald City, Scraps the Patchwork Girl has been making more of a nuisance of herself than usual.This synopsis refers to the published text, edited by Shanower. After confrontations with Jellia Jamb and Jenny Jump, Scraps decides to run away on her spoolicle (a bicycle made of thread spools). She visits Jinjur's Munchkin Country farm; but Jinjur wants to put Scraps to work, so Scraps leaves quickly. At Prof. Wogglebug's Royal Athletic College, Scraps falls in with a 12-year-old prodigy named Alexample. They marvel at the air castle the Professor has dreamed into existence for his coming vacation, as it hovers above the college. Through unfortunate clumsiness, Scraps knocks the mooring line loose and the air castle floats away, with Alexample hanging onto the tethering rope. Scraps flees from the pursuit of the irate Wogglebug. Scraps meets a Repairman who magically fixes the damage and staining she's endured in her recent actions. The exasperated Scraps longs to run away from Oz entirely, but doesn't know how to cross the Deadly Desert. The Repairman informs her of a Weather Witch who lives on the highest mountain in Oz; she makes weather for the entire Earth from her windmill there. Scraps decides to get the Weather Witch to blow her across the Desert with wind, and sets out for the mountain. On the way, Scraps meets Popla, \\"the one and only power plant...the most powerful plant in the world.\\" (Popla looks like a large shrub, with the face of a beautiful young woman.) Popla longs for release from her bleak and stationary existence, and eagerly transfers herself into a flowerpot to join with Scraps; Popla's strength and resourcefulness prove to be important advantages in their coming adventures. Despite tempestuous winds, the two intrepid travelers reach the top of the mountain. Fanny the Weather Witch agrees to blast them across the Deadly Desert; but additional clumsiness gets them stuck on one of the windmill's blades, which hurls them high into the atmosphere. Meanwhile, Prof. Wogglebug stomps toward the Emerald City to complain about Scraps to the Wizard. He encounters Jenny Jump and Jack Pumpkinhead, who have set out in search for the missing Scraps. The Wogglebug decides to join up with them, as the most direct approach to recovering his air castle. (The later chapters of the book alternate between the two plots: the runaway Scraps and her companions, and the searchers pursuing her.) Scraps and Popla land on a friendly cloud, who takes them to a nearby star. The star is a kind of semi- mechanical conveyance, commanded by Captain Batt, who is built of wires and electric components. Predictably, Scraps gets into a fight with him; she punches him in his button nose, which proves to be his on-off button. With Captain Batt shut down, they meet the Twinkler, the star's maintenance man (he looks like Cap'n Bill). Popla tries piloting the star -- and crashes into the missing air castle. They find Alexample there, and endure a few peaceful days in its palatial environs. They get to know the inhabitants of the upper air, who include sky fairies and air sprites, and cloud sheep herded by cloud- pushers and sky-sweepers. Scraps and company also repel an attack from sky pirates. Things go badly for the searchers below; they are caught in a storm, in which Jack loses his pumpkin head. Jenny and the Professor have to lead or drag his headless stick-body along with them. They wander into an enchanted orchard, where they confront an army of rebellious quinces. By this time, the week of the Wogglebug's planned vacation has expired, and the air castle's time is up: it melts, cracks, dissolves, shatters, and otherwise falls apart around its occupants. They come tumbling down upon the enchanted orchard, and the search party, and the quince army. In a final confrontation, the quince soldiers commit mass suicide by shooting their sooty stems at Scraps. She is so blackened by the soot that she tries to hide from the world. The others convince Scraps to return to the Emerald City, where she can be magically repaired.

He continued his father's quest to gain control of the Kantō (the central area, today dominated by Tokyo, of Japan's main island). His childhood name was Chiyomaru (千代丸). In 1524, Ujitsuna took Edo Castle, which was controlled by Uesugi Tomooki, thus beginning a long-running rivalry between the Hōjō and Uesugi families. Two years later, the Uesugi attacked and burned Kamakura, which was a major loss to the Hōjō symbolically, because the earlier Hōjō clan from which they took their name fell in the siege of Kamakura in 1333. The Uesugi attacked again in 1535, when Ujitsuna was away fighting the Takeda; however, Ujitsuna returned and defeated Uesugi Tomooki, reclaiming his lands. When Uesugi Tomooki died two years later, Ujitsuna took the opportunity to seize Kawagoe Castle, and secure his control of the Kantō. In 1526, Hojo Ujitsuna was defeated by Takeda Nobutora in the Battle of Nashinokidaira. In 1538, Ujitsuna then went on to win the battle of Kōnodai, securing Shimōsa Province for the Hōjō. In 1539, he defeated the Koga Kubo Yoshiaki (Oyumi Kubo) and gained control of Awa. Over the next several years before his death in 1541, Ujitsuna oversaw the rebuilding of Kamakura, making it a symbol of the growing power of the Hōjō, along with Odawara and Edo. He was succeeded as head of the Hōjō clan and lord of Odawara by his son Hōjō Ujiyasu. ==Family== * Father: Hojo Soun * Younger Brother: Hōjō Genan * Mother: Nan’nyoin-dono * Wife: Yojuin-dono * Concubine: Konoe-dono * Children: ** Hojo Ujiyasu by Yojuin-dono ** Hōjō Tsunashige (Adopted child) ** Hojo Tamemasa (1520-1542) ** Hojo Ujitaka (1522-1562) ** Joshin’in married Ota Suketaka ** daughter married Kira Yoriyasu ** Hoshun’in married Ashikaga Haruuji ** Sakihime married Horikoshi Sadatomo ** Daichoin married Hojo Tsunamori ** Chiyo married Katsurayama Ujimoto ==References== *Turnbull, Stephen (2002).

The character is an Atlantean of Marvel's shared universe, known as the Marvel Universe. She is the illegitimate daughter of Attuma == Publication history == Andromeda was introduced in The Defenders #143 (March 1985) and added to the titular supergroup's lineup just a few issues later. Writer Peter B. Gillis later revealed, \\"My long-term plan was to populate the Defenders with my own crew of characters, characters who nonetheless had ties to interesting parts of the Marvel Universe. Andromeda, while not the Sub-Mariner, gave me a connection to Atlantis.\\" However, Andromeda would be the last character Gillis added to the Defenders, since shortly after her debut he was told that the series was being cancelled. ==Fictional character biography== A member of the Homo mermanus race, Andromeda is the illegitimate daughter of Attuma of Atlantis by a woman named Lady Gelva. He did not know of her existence until she confronted him and told him he was her father.Iron Man Annual #10. Marvel Comics. Andromeda was raised in Atlantean society and trained in the arts of hunting and war and she exceeded any other male except for her father in these skills. Despite her skills, she was considered unworthy of promotion in the Atlantean military because she is a woman even though she was highly decorated.Defenders #149. Marvel Comics. Andromeda, inspired by Namor's tales, moved to the surface world, where she used a serum to give herself a human appearance and the ability to breathe out of water. She took the name Andrea McPhee and posed as a surface woman.Defenders #143. Marvel Comics. When she was revealed as an Atlantean, she quickly abandoned her charade and became a member of the Defenders, joining them against a villain named Hotspur.Defenders #146-147. Marvel Comics. She was with the Defenders, christened the \\"New Defenders,\\" for only a short time, revealing only portions of her background to them.Defenders #149. Marvel Comics. With them, she traveled to outer space and battled the second Star-Thief.Defenders #150. Marvel Comics. She fought Manslaughter as he menaced the team,Defenders #151. Marvel Comics. and then aided the Defenders and the Interloper in battle against fellow Defender Moondragon, and the Dragon of the Moon who was possessing Moondragon. Andromeda sacrificed her life force, joining with Manslaughter, the Valkyrie, and the Interloper to drive the Dragon of the Moon from the Earth, and her body was turned to stone.Defenders #152. Marvel Comics. The Dragon would later return, this time without a body. To stop the Dragon of the Moon, Doctor Strange cast a spell which returned the souls of the Defenders fallen in the battle against the Dragon to the bodies of several recently deceased humans, changing them into duplicates of the Defenders. Andromeda's soul entered the body of Genevieve Cross and these Defenders now called themselves the Dragon Circle. Together the Dragon Circle banished the Dragon from Earth and Andromeda returned to the oceans.Doctor Strange Vol. 3 #3-4. Marvel Comics. Andromeda played an important part in the 1989 Atlantis Attacks crossover. Andromeda led a rebellion to stop her father Attuma from invading the surface world, but was bested by Attuma in personal combat. She was kidnapped unconscious by the Deviant priest Ghaur as one of his \\"Seven Brides of Set.\\"X-Factor Annual #4. Marvel Comics. Under Ghaur's domination, she accompanied She-Hulk to acquire a piece of Set's life force.Avengers West Coast Annual #4. Marvel Comics. In the end the Brides of Set gained their freedom thanks to the Fantastic Four and Avengers.Fantastic Four Annual #22. Marvel Comics. Andromeda joined her forces with those of Namor. She was part of the short-lived Deep Six, a group of underwater heroes.Namor, the Sub-Mariner #58 (Jan. 1995). Marvel Comics. During this time her mind and that of Genevieve Cross would repeatedly exchange control and even turn her body into a copy of Genevieve's. Andromeda sacrificed her own mind to save Namor's soul, leaving Genevieve in control of Andromeda's body.Dr. Strange vol. 3 #3. Marvel Comics. Months later, either Genevieve in Andromeda's body or a restored Andromeda herself assisted Namor and the Defenders against Attuma's own Deep Six.Defenders vol. 2, #7 (Sep. 2001). Marvel Comics. Andromeda was last seen as an ally of Namor, living in Atlantis.Fantastic Four vol 1 #588. Marvel Comics. Andromeda later appears as a member of Namor's Defenders of the Deep.Avengers Vol. 8 #9. Marvel Comics. ==Powers and abilities== Andromeda has all the powers inherent to the Homo mermanus, but her strength and speed are far greater than that of any ordinary Homo mermanus, though not as great as that of her father, Attuma. She is adapted to live underwater, having gills that allow her to breathe underwater, she can swim at high speeds and her body is resistant to the pressure and the cold of the deep oceans. Her specially-developed vision allows her to see clearly in the murky depths of the ocean. She can survive only for 10 minutes out of water, unless she uses a special serum that gives her the ability to breathe air. Her stamina, agility, and reflexes are reduced when out of the water. She has been trained as an Atlantean warrior, and is very skilled in the arts of hunting and war, wielding a trident as her weapon of choice. She carries a short sword and an 8\\" dagger as additional weaponry. Andromeda also has extensive knowledge of biochemistry. ==Notes== * Genevieve Cross is called Genevieve Cass in the Dragon Circle entry in the Handbook of the Marvel Universe '89 edition. ==ReferencesCategory:Comics characters introduced in 1985 Category:Female characters in comics Category:Marvel Comics Atlanteans (Homo mermanus) Category:Marvel Comics characters with superhuman strength Category:Marvel Comics superheroes Category:Marvel Comics female superheroes ","title":"Andromeda (Marvel Comics)"},{"id":"2549469","text":"Obersee is the German word for \\"Upper Lake\\" and may refer to: * Obersee (Antarctica), a meltwater lake in the Gruber Mountains, Antarctica * Obersee (Arosa), a lake in the resort town of Arosa, Grisons, Switzerland * Obersee (Glarus), a mountain lake in the canton of Glarus, Switzerland * Obersee (Königssee), a mountain lake in southeastern Bavaria * Obersee (Lake Constance), the larger of the two parts of Lake Constance * Obersee (Zürichsee), a section of Lake Zürich, Switzerland * Obersee (Rur), a reservoir in the Eifel mountains, Germany * Obersee Nachrichten, a newspaper published in the area of Obersee * Obersee, a previous name for the Egerner cove of the Tegernsee (lake) in Bavaria * Obersee, an informal name for the upper part of the Weitsee lake in Bavaria ==See also== *Untersee (disambiguation) ","title":"Obersee"},{"id":"2549476","text":"Untersee (German: lower lake) may refer to: *Lake Untersee, Antarctica *Untersee (Lake Constance), section of Lake Constance ==See also== *Obersee (disambiguation) ","title":"Untersee"},{"id":"2549477","text":"The Gnadensee is part of Lower Lake Constance (), the western part of the lake. ==Description == The Gnadensee lies between Allensbach in the north and the island of Reichenau in the south. In the west it extends to the Mettnau peninsula (Radolfzell) and its eastern end borders on the Wollmatinger Ried Nature Reserve and the Reichenaudamm with its prominent avenue of poplars.

If an accused person was found guilty and sentenced to death, the execution could not take place on the island. It had to be carried out on the mainland as the whole island was holy ground. As a result, the convict was taken by boat to the mainland in the direction of present-day Allensbach, in order that the sentence could be carried out. If the local ruler, the abbot, wanted to reprieve the criminal, he had a bell rung before the boat reached the far shore. This was a signal to the executioner on the mainland that the convict had received a pardon or Gnade (\\"mercy\\" or \\"grace\\" in German).Helmut Fidler: Kleine Kulturgeschichte des Ruderns am Untersee, in: Hegau.

In winter the lake completely freezes and is used for winter sports. In summer the lake is used for pleasure boating (boats powered by combustion engines are not allowed except for the ferries that cross the width of the lake from Zell to Thumersbach, so electrically powered boats can be rented instead). The water is very clear and suitable for swimming or diving, but can be chilly.

The Museum was founded by prominent art collectors Raymond and Susan Johnson, owners of the largest collection of Russian Realist paintings outside the borders of the former Soviet Union. TMORA was incorporated as a nonprofit in 2002, and opened at its present location in 2005. The museum shows 8-10 exhibitions per year, and hosts over 50 annual events ranging from notable lecturers to classical concerts to theatrical readings. TMORA is open daily, located between Downtown Minneapolis and the Minneapolis Saint Paul Airport. ==History== === Founding (1991-2005) === Raymond and Susan Johnson held the first retail exhibition of Russian Realist Art in North America in 1991. The largest collectors of Soviet-era paintings outside the former USSR, the Johnsons showed their work privately until envisioning a public museum in 2002. It commenced exhibition activities open to the public in 2002, initially in loaned space in a corporate office park located in Bloomington, Minnesota. The organization initially showcased Russian Realist-style paintings from the late 19th century as well as from the Soviet era (1917–1991). Ray Johnson was appointed an Honorary Consul for the Russian Federation in 2003, and in recognition of their respective contributions \\"to international cultural diversity and education,\\" both Johnson (2005) and TMORA's first Director Bradford Shinkle (2009) were awarded Russia's Order of Friendship Medal, the highest civilian honor accorded to non-Russian citizens. In 2005, TMORA acquired and thoroughly remodeled the former Mayflower Church in south Minneapolis, a 75-year-old building that previously served as a Congregational church and funeral home. The building received special recognition for adaptive reuse from the Minnesota Heritage Preservation Commission, and opened to the public in 2007. TMORA now operates a state-of-the-art exhibition facility that includes of display galleries and administrative offices. === TMORA: an American Museum of Russian Art (2005 - ) === The Museum of Russian Art: Main and Mezzanine Galleries The renovated gallery space has been host to over 70 exhibitions from Masterpieces of Soviet Era Painting, to historical topics like World War I and the Siege of Leningrad and Russian art forms such as Faberge, Lacquer Boxes, Nesting Dolls, and Ornaments. TMORA also presents shows by living artists, such as Leon Hushcha (a Minnesotan artist of Ukrainian descent) and Canadian-Armenian artist Garen Bedrossian. TMORA has established international relationships with numerous Russian cultural organizations and museums including Rossotrudnichestvo, the Russian Embassy in the United States - Washington D.C., the Russian Cultural Center, the State Tretyakov Gallery (Moscow), State Russian Museum (St. Petersburg), State Museum of Yaroslaval (Yaroslaval). The museum works with both private collectors as well as institutions throughout the United States; the mutual cultural embargo established between Russia and the United States in 2010 currently prevents collections from state institutions in Russia to travel to the United States. In addition to its exhibition calendar, TMORA hosts a variety of events throughout the year including concerts, lectures, theater, dance, artist talks, and book clubs. ==References== == External links == * *Events List *Facebook Page Category:2002 establishments in Minnesota Category:Art museums established in 2002 Category:Art museums in Minnesota Category:Folk art museums in the United States Category:Folk art museums in Minnesota Category:Museums in Minneapolis Category:Russian art Category:Russian-American culture in Minnesota ","title":"The Museum of Russian Art"},{"id":"2549486","text":"This list of history journals presents representative academic journals pertaining to the field of history and historiography.

Nuclear thermal power station in Bavaria Geothermal power station in Iceland Taichung Thermal Power Station, the world's largest coal-fired power station, in Taichung, Taiwan A thermal power station is a power station in which heat energy is converted to electric power. In most, a steam-driven turbine converts heat to mechanical power as an intermediate to electrical power. Water is heated, turns into steam and drives a steam turbine which drives an electrical generator. After it passes through the turbine the steam is condensed in a condenser and recycled to where it was heated. This is known as a Rankine cycle. The greatest variation in the design of thermal power stations is due to the different heat sources: fossil fuel, nuclear energy, solar energy, biofuels, and waste incineration are all used. Certain thermal power stations are also designed to produce heat for industrial purposes, for district heating, or desalination of water, in addition to generating electrical power. ==Types of thermal energy== Almost all coal, petroleum, nuclear, geothermal, solar thermal electric, and waste incineration plants, as well as many natural gas power stations are thermal. Natural gas is frequently burned in gas turbines as well as boilers. The waste heat from a gas turbine, in the form of hot exhaust gas, can be used to raise steam by passing this gas through a heat recovery steam generator (HRSG). The steam is then used to drive a steam turbine in a combined cycle plant that improves overall efficiency. Power stations burning coal, fuel oil, or natural gas are often called fossil fuel power stations. Some biomass-fueled thermal power stations have appeared also. Non-nuclear thermal power stations, particularly fossil-fueled plants, which do not use cogeneration are sometimes referred to as conventional power stations. Commercial electric utility power stations are usually constructed on a large scale and designed for continuous operation. Virtually all electric power stations use three-phase electrical generators to produce alternating current (AC) electric power at a frequency of 50 Hz or 60 Hz. Large companies or institutions may have their own power stations to supply heating or electricity to their facilities, especially if steam is created anyway for other purposes. Steam-driven power stations have been used to drive most ships in most of the 20th century. Shipboard power stations usually directly couple the turbine to the ship's propellers through gearboxes. Power stations in such ships also provide steam to smaller turbines driving electric generators to supply electricity. Nuclear marine propulsion is, with few exceptions, used only in naval vessels. There have been many turbo-electric ships in which a steam-driven turbine drives an electric generator which powers an electric motor for propulsion. Cogeneration plants, often called combined heat and power (CHP) facilities, produce both electric power and heat for process heat or space heating, such as steam and hot water. ==History== Interior of the Toledo Edison Steam Plant, Toledo, Ohio, approximately 1900 The reciprocating steam engine has been used to produce mechanical power since the 18th century, with notable improvements being made by James Watt. When the first commercially developed central electrical power stations were established in 1882 at Pearl Street Station in New York and Holborn Viaduct power station in London, reciprocating steam engines were used. The development of the steam turbine in 1884 provided larger and more efficient machine designs for central generating stations. By 1892 the turbine was considered a better alternative to reciprocating engines; turbines offered higher speeds, more compact machinery, and stable speed regulation allowing for parallel synchronous operation of generators on a common bus. After about 1905, turbines entirely replaced reciprocating engines in large central power stations. The largest reciprocating engine-generator sets ever built were completed in 1901 for the Manhattan Elevated Railway. Each of seventeen units weighed about 500 tons and was rated 6000 kilowatts; a contemporary turbine set of similar rating would have weighed about 20% as much.Maury Klein, The Power Makers: Steam, Electricity, and the Men Who Invented Modern America Bloomsbury Publishing USA, 2009 ==Thermal power generation efficiency== A Rankine cycle with a two- stage steam turbine and a single feed water heater. The energy efficiency of a conventional thermal power station is defined as saleable energy produced as a percent of the heating value of the fuel consumed. A simple cycle gas turbine achieves energy conversion efficiencies from 20 to 35%. Typical coal-based power plants operating at steam pressures of 170 bar and 570 °C run at efficiency of 35 to 38 %,John Zactruba, The Efficiency of Power Plants of Different Types, Brighthub Engineering. Retrieved 2019-04-24. with state-of- the-art fossil fuel plants at 46% efficiency.Global CCS Institute, 5. Efficiency in Thermal Power Generation, Energy efficiency technologies: overview report, 1 March 2014. Retrieved 2019-04-24. Combined-cycle systems can reach higher values. As with all heat engines, their efficiency is limited, and governed by the laws of thermodynamics. The Carnot efficiency dictates that higher efficiencies can be attained by increasing the temperature of the steam. Sub-critical fossil fuel power stations can achieve 36–40% efficiency. Supercritical designs have efficiencies in the low to mid 40% range, with new \\"ultra critical\\" designs using pressures of 4400 psi (30.3 MPa) and multiple stage reheat reaching 45-48% efficiency. Above the critical point for water of and 3212 psi (22.06 MPa), there is no phase transition from water to steam, but only a gradual decrease in density. Currently most nuclear power stations must operate below the temperatures and pressures that coal- fired plants do, in order to provide more conservative safety margins within the systems that remove heat from the nuclear fuel. This, in turn, limits their thermodynamic efficiency to 30–32%. Some advanced reactor designs being studied, such as the very-high-temperature reactor, Advanced Gas-cooled Reactor, and supercritical water reactor, would operate at temperatures and pressures similar to current coal plants, producing comparable thermodynamic efficiency. The energy of a thermal power station not utilized in power production must leave the plant in the form of heat to the environment. This waste heat can go through a condenser and be disposed of with cooling water or in cooling towers. If the waste heat is instead used for district heating, it is called cogeneration. An important class of thermal power station is that associated with desalination facilities; these are typically found in desert countries with large supplies of natural gas, and in these plants freshwater production and electricity are equally important co-products. Other types of power stations are subject to different efficiency limitations. Most hydropower stations in the United States are about 90 percent efficient in converting the energy of falling water into electricityClimate TechBook, Hydropower, Pew Center on Global Climate Change, October 2009 while the efficiency of a wind turbine is limited by Betz's law, to about 59.3%. ==Electricity cost== The direct cost of electric energy produced by a thermal power station is the result of cost of fuel, capital cost for the plant, operator labour, maintenance, and such factors as ash handling and disposal. Indirect social or environmental costs, such as the economic value of environmental impacts, or environmental and health effects of the complete fuel cycle and plant decommissioning, are not usually assigned to generation costs for thermal stations in utility practice, but may form part of an environmental impact assessment. ==Typical coal thermal power station== thumbcenter700pxTypical diagram of a coal-fired thermal power station { style=\\"width:250px\\"  1.

Forced draft fan  } For units over about 200 MW capacity, redundancy of key components is provided by installing duplicates of the forced and induced draft fans, air preheaters, and fly ash collectors. On some units of about 60 MW, two boilers per unit may instead be provided. The list of coal power stations has the 200 largest power stations ranging in size from 2,000MW to 5,500MW. ==Boiler and steam cycle== In the nuclear plant field, steam generator refers to a specific type of large heat exchanger used in a pressurized water reactor (PWR) to thermally connect the primary (reactor plant) and secondary (steam plant) systems, which generates steam. In a nuclear reactor called a boiling water reactor (BWR), water is boiled to generate steam directly in the reactor itself and there are no units called steam generators. In some industrial settings, there can also be steam-producing heat exchangers called heat recovery steam generators (HRSG) which utilize heat from some industrial process, most commonly utilizing hot exhaust from a gas turbine. The steam generating boiler has to produce steam at the high purity, pressure and temperature required for the steam turbine that drives the electrical generator. Geothermal plants do not need boilers because they use naturally occurring steam sources. Heat exchangers may be used where the geothermal steam is very corrosive or contains excessive suspended solids. A fossil fuel steam generator includes an economizer, a steam drum, and the furnace with its steam generating tubes and superheater coils. Necessary safety valves are located at suitable points to relieve excessive boiler pressure. The air and flue gas path equipment include: forced draft (FD) fan, air preheater (AP), boiler furnace, induced draft (ID) fan, fly ash collectors (electrostatic precipitator or baghouse), and the flue-gas stack. ===Feed water heating and deaeration=== The boiler feedwater used in the steam boiler is a means of transferring heat energy from the burning fuel to the mechanical energy of the spinning steam turbine. The total feed water consists of recirculated condensate water and purified makeup water. Because the metallic materials it contacts are subject to corrosion at high temperatures and pressures, the makeup water is highly purified before use. A system of water softeners and ion exchange demineralizers produces water so pure that it coincidentally becomes an electrical insulator, with conductivity in the range of 0.3–1.0 microsiemens per centimeter. The makeup water in a 500 MWe plant amounts to perhaps 120 US gallons per minute (7.6 L/s) to replace water drawn off from the boiler drums for water purity management, and to also offset the small losses from steam leaks in the system. The feed water cycle begins with condensate water being pumped out of the condenser after traveling through the steam turbines. The condensate flow rate at full load in a 500 MW plant is about 6,000 US gallons per minute (400 L/s). Diagram of boiler feed water deaerator (with vertical, domed aeration section and horizontal water storage section). The water is pressurized in two stages, and flows through a series of six or seven intermediate feed water heaters, heated up at each point with steam extracted from an appropriate duct on the turbines and gaining temperature at each stage. Typically, in the middle of this series of feedwater heaters, and before the second stage of pressurization, the condensate plus the makeup water flows through a deaeratorPressurized deaerators that removes dissolved air from the water, further purifying and reducing its corrosiveness. The water may be dosed following this point with hydrazine, a chemical that removes the remaining oxygen in the water to below 5 parts per billion (ppb). It is also dosed with pH control agents such as ammonia or morpholine to keep the residual acidity low and thus non-corrosive. ===Boiler operation=== The boiler is a rectangular furnace about on a side and tall. Its walls are made of a web of high pressure steel tubes about in diameter. Fuel such as pulverized coal is air-blown into the furnace through burners located at the four corners, or along one wall, or two opposite walls, and it is ignited to rapidly burn, forming a large fireball at the center. The thermal radiation of the fireball heats the water that circulates through the boiler tubes near the boiler perimeter. The water circulation rate in the boiler is three to four times the throughput. As the water in the boiler circulates it absorbs heat and changes into steam. It is separated from the water inside a drum at the top of the furnace. The saturated steam is introduced into superheat pendant tubes that hang in the hottest part of the combustion gases as they exit the furnace. Here the steam is superheated to to prepare it for the turbine. Plants designed for lignite (brown coal) are used in locations as varied as Germany, Victoria, Australia, and North Dakota. Lignite is a much younger form of coal than black coal. It has a lower energy density than black coal and requires a much larger furnace for equivalent heat output. Such coals may contain up to 70% water and ash, yielding lower furnace temperatures and requiring larger induced-draft fans. The firing systems also differ from black coal and typically draw hot gas from the furnace-exit level and mix it with the incoming coal in fan-type mills that inject the pulverized coal and hot gas mixture into the boiler. Plants that use gas turbines to heat the water for conversion into steam use boilers known as heat recovery steam generators (HRSG). The exhaust heat from the gas turbines is used to make superheated steam that is then used in a conventional water-steam generation cycle, as described in the gas turbine combined-cycle plants section. ===Boiler furnace and steam drum=== The water enters the boiler through a section in the convection pass called the economizer. From the economizer it passes to the steam drum and from there it goes through downcomers to inlet headers at the bottom of the water walls. From these headers the water rises through the water walls of the furnace where some of it is turned into steam and the mixture of water and steam then re-enters the steam drum. This process may be driven purely by natural circulation (because the water is the downcomers is denser than the water/steam mixture in the water walls) or assisted by pumps. In the steam drum, the water is returned to the downcomers and the steam is passed through a series of steam separators and dryers that remove water droplets from the steam. The dry steam then flows into the superheater coils. The boiler furnace auxiliary equipment includes coal feed nozzles and igniter guns, soot blowers, water lancing, and observation ports (in the furnace walls) for observation of the furnace interior. Furnace explosions due to any accumulation of combustible gases after a trip-out are avoided by flushing out such gases from the combustion zone before igniting the coal. The steam drum (as well as the superheater coils and headers) have air vents and drains needed for initial start up. ===Superheater=== Fossil fuel power stations often have a superheater section in the steam generating furnace. The steam passes through drying equipment inside the steam drum on to the superheater, a set of tubes in the furnace. Here the steam picks up more energy from hot flue gases outside the tubing, and its temperature is now superheated above the saturation temperature. The superheated steam is then piped through the main steam lines to the valves before the high-pressure turbine. Nuclear-powered steam plants do not have such sections but produce steam at essentially saturated conditions. Experimental nuclear plants were equipped with fossil-fired superheaters in an attempt to improve overall plant operating cost. ===Steam condensing=== The condenser condenses the steam from the exhaust of the turbine into liquid to allow it to be pumped. If the condenser can be made cooler, the pressure of the exhaust steam is reduced and efficiency of the cycle increases. Diagram of a typical water-cooled surface condenser.Air Pollution Control Orientation Course from website of the Air Pollution Training InstituteEnergy savings in steam systems Figure 3a, Layout of surface condenser (scroll to page 11 of 34 pdf pages) The surface condenser is a shell and tube heat exchanger in which cooling water is circulated through the tubes. The exhaust steam from the low-pressure turbine enters the shell, where it is cooled and converted to condensate (water) by flowing over the tubes as shown in the adjacent diagram. Such condensers use steam ejectors or rotary motor-driven exhausts for continuous removal of air and gases from the steam side to maintain vacuum. For best efficiency, the temperature in the condenser must be kept as low as practical in order to achieve the lowest possible pressure in the condensing steam. Since the condenser temperature can almost always be kept significantly below 100 °C where the vapor pressure of water is much less than atmospheric pressure, the condenser generally works under vacuum. Thus leaks of non-condensible air into the closed loop must be prevented. Typically the cooling water causes the steam to condense at a temperature of about and that creates an absolute pressure in the condenser of about , i.e. a vacuum of about relative to atmospheric pressure. The large decrease in volume that occurs when water vapor condenses to liquid creates the low vacuum that helps pull steam through and increase the efficiency of the turbines. The limiting factor is the temperature of the cooling water and that, in turn, is limited by the prevailing average climatic conditions at the power station's location (it may be possible to lower the temperature beyond the turbine limits during winter, causing excessive condensation in the turbine). Plants operating in hot climates may have to reduce output if their source of condenser cooling water becomes warmer; unfortunately this usually coincides with periods of high electrical demand for air conditioning. The condenser generally uses either circulating cooling water from a cooling tower to reject waste heat to the atmosphere, or once-through cooling (OTC) water from a river, lake or ocean. In the United States, about two-thirds of power plants use OTC systems, which often have significant adverse environmental impacts. The impacts include thermal pollution and killing large numbers of fish and other aquatic species at cooling water intakes. A Marley mechanical induced draft cooling tower The heat absorbed by the circulating cooling water in the condenser tubes must also be removed to maintain the ability of the water to cool as it circulates. This is done by pumping the warm water from the condenser through either natural draft, forced draft or induced draft cooling towers (as seen in the adjacent image) that reduce the temperature of the water by evaporation, by about 11 to 17 °C (20 to 30 °F)—expelling waste heat to the atmosphere. The circulation flow rate of the cooling water in a 500 MW unit is about 14.2 m3/s (500 ft3/s or 225,000 US gal/min) at full load. EPA Workshop on Cooling Water Intake Technologies, Arlington, Virginia. The condenser tubes are made of brass or stainless steel to resist corrosion from either side. Nevertheless, they may become internally fouled during operation by bacteria or algae in the cooling water or by mineral scaling, all of which inhibit heat transfer and reduce thermodynamic efficiency. Many plants include an automatic cleaning system that circulates sponge rubber balls through the tubes to scrub them clean without the need to take the system off-line. The cooling water used to condense the steam in the condenser returns to its source without having been changed other than having been warmed. If the water returns to a local water body (rather than a circulating cooling tower), it is often tempered with cool 'raw' water to prevent thermal shock when discharged into that body of water. Another form of condensing system is the air-cooled condenser. The process is similar to that of a radiator and fan. Exhaust heat from the low-pressure section of a steam turbine runs through the condensing tubes, the tubes are usually finned and ambient air is pushed through the fins with the help of a large fan. The steam condenses to water to be reused in the water-steam cycle. Air-cooled condensers typically operate at a higher temperature than water-cooled versions. While saving water, the efficiency of the cycle is reduced (resulting in more carbon dioxide per megawatt-hour of electricity). From the bottom of the condenser, powerful condensate pumps recycle the condensed steam (water) back to the water/steam cycle. ===Reheater=== Power station furnaces may have a reheater section containing tubes heated by hot flue gases outside the tubes. Exhaust steam from the high- pressure turbine is passed through these heated tubes to collect more energy before driving the intermediate and then low-pressure turbines. ===Air path=== External fans are provided to give sufficient air for combustion. The Primary air fan takes air from the atmosphere and, first warms the air in the air preheater for better economy. Primary air then passes through the coal pulverizers, and carries the coal dust to the burners for injection into the furnace. The Secondary air fan takes air from the atmosphere and, first warms the air in the air preheater for better economy. Secondary air is mixed with the coal/primary air flow in the burners. The induced draft fan assists the FD fan by drawing out combustible gases from the furnace, maintaining slightly below atmospheric pressure in the furnace to avoid leakage of combustion products from the boiler casing. ==Steam turbine generator== Rotor of a modern steam turbine, used in a power station The turbine generator consists of a series of steam turbines interconnected to each other and a generator on a common shaft. There is usually a high-pressure turbine at one end, followed by an intermediate-pressure turbine, and finally one, two, or three low-pressure turbines, and the generator. As steam moves through the system and loses pressure and thermal energy, it expands in volume, requiring increasing diameter and longer blades at each succeeding stage to extract the remaining energy. The entire rotating mass may be over 200 metric tons and long. It is so heavy that it must be kept turning slowly even when shut down (at 3 rpm) so that the shaft will not bow even slightly and become unbalanced. This is so important that it is one of only six functions of blackout emergency power batteries on site. (The other five being emergency lighting, communication, station alarms, generator hydrogen seal system, and turbogenerator lube oil.) For a typical late 20th-century power station, superheated steam from the boiler is delivered through diameter piping at and to the high-pressure turbine, where it falls in pressure to and to in temperature through the stage. It exits via diameter cold reheat lines and passes back into the boiler, where the steam is reheated in special reheat pendant tubes back to . The hot reheat steam is conducted to the intermediate pressure turbine, where it falls in both temperature and pressure and exits directly to the long- bladed low-pressure turbines and finally exits to the condenser. The generator, typically about long and in diameter, contains a stationary stator and a spinning rotor, each containing miles of heavy copper conductor. There is generally no permanent magnet, thus preventing black starts. In operation it generates up to 21,000 amperes at 24,000 volts AC (504 MWe) as it spins at either 3,000 or 3,600 rpm, synchronized to the power grid. The rotor spins in a sealed chamber cooled with hydrogen gas, selected because it has the highest known heat transfer coefficient of any gas and for its low viscosity, which reduces windage losses. This system requires special handling during startup, with air in the chamber first displaced by carbon dioxide before filling with hydrogen. This ensures that a highly explosive hydrogen–oxygen environment is not created. The power grid frequency is 60 Hz across North America and 50 Hz in Europe, Oceania, Asia (Korea and parts of Japan are notable exceptions), and parts of Africa. The desired frequency affects the design of large turbines, since they are highly optimized for one particular speed. The electricity flows to a distribution yard where transformers increase the voltage for transmission to its destination. The steam turbine-driven generators have auxiliary systems enabling them to work satisfactorily and safely. The steam turbine generator, being rotating equipment, generally has a heavy, large-diameter shaft. The shaft therefore requires not only supports but also has to be kept in position while running. To minimize the frictional resistance to the rotation, the shaft has a number of bearings. The bearing shells, in which the shaft rotates, are lined with a low-friction material like Babbitt metal. Oil lubrication is provided to further reduce the friction between shaft and bearing surface and to limit the heat generated. ==Stack gas path and cleanup== As the combustion flue gas exits the boiler it is routed through a rotating flat basket of metal mesh which picks up heat and returns it to incoming fresh air as the basket rotates. This is called the air preheater. The gas exiting the boiler is laden with fly ash, which are tiny spherical ash particles. The flue gas contains nitrogen along with combustion products carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen oxides. The fly ash is removed by fabric bag filters in baghouses or electrostatic precipitators. Once removed, the fly ash byproduct can sometimes be used in the manufacturing of concrete. This cleaning up of flue gases, however, only occurs in plants that are fitted with the appropriate technology. Still, the majority of coal- fired power stations in the world do not have these facilities. Legislation in Europe has been efficient to reduce flue gas pollution. Japan has been using flue gas cleaning technology for over 30 years and the US has been doing the same for over 25 years. China is now beginning to grapple with the pollution caused by coal-fired power stations. Where required by law, the sulfur and nitrogen oxide pollutants are removed by stack gas scrubbers which use a pulverized limestone or other alkaline wet slurry to remove those pollutants from the exit stack gas. Other devices use catalysts to remove nitrous oxide compounds from the flue-gas stream. The gas travelling up the flue-gas stack may by this time have dropped to about . A typical flue-gas stack may be tall to disperse the remaining flue gas components in the atmosphere. The tallest flue-gas stack in the world is tall at the Ekibastuz GRES-2 Power Station in Kazakhstan. In the United States and a number of other countries, atmospheric dispersion modeling www.air-dispersion.com studies are required to determine the flue-gas stack height needed to comply with the local air pollution regulations. The United States also requires the height of a flue-gas stack to comply with what is known as the \\"good engineering practice\\" (GEP) stack height.Guideline for Determination of Good Engineering Practice Stack Height (Technical Support Document for the Stack Height Regulations), Revised, 1985, EPA Publication No. EPA–450/4–80–023R, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (NTIS No. PB 85–225241)Lawson, Jr., R. E. and W. H. Snyder, 1983. Determination of Good Engineering Practice Stack Height: A Demonstration Study for a Power Plant, 1983, EPA Publication No. EPA–600/3–83–024. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (NTIS No. PB 83–207407) In the case of existing flue gas stacks that exceed the GEP stack height, any air pollution dispersion modeling studies for such stacks must use the GEP stack height rather than the actual stack height. ===Fly ash collection=== Fly ash is captured and removed from the flue gas by electrostatic precipitators or fabric bag filters (or sometimes both) located at the outlet of the furnace and before the induced draft fan. The fly ash is periodically removed from the collection hoppers below the precipitators or bag filters. Generally, the fly ash is pneumatically transported to storage silos and stored on site in ash ponds, or transported by trucks or railroad cars to landfills, ===Bottom ash collection and disposal=== At the bottom of the furnace, there is a hopper for collection of bottom ash. This hopper is kept filled with water to quench the ash and clinkers falling down from the furnace. Arrangements are included to crush the clinkers and convey the crushed clinkers and bottom ash to on-site ash ponds, or off-site to landfills. Ash extractors are used to discharge ash from municipal solid waste–fired boilers. ==Auxiliary systems== ===Boiler make-up water treatment plant and storage=== Since there is continuous withdrawal of steam and continuous return of condensate to the boiler, losses due to blowdown and leakages have to be made up to maintain a desired water level in the boiler steam drum. For this, continuous make-up water is added to the boiler water system. Impurities in the raw water input to the plant generally consist of calcium and magnesium salts which impart hardness to the water. Hardness in the make-up water to the boiler will form deposits on the tube water surfaces which will lead to overheating and failure of the tubes. Thus, the salts have to be removed from the water, and that is done by a water demineralising treatment plant (DM). A DM plant generally consists of cation, anion, and mixed bed exchangers. Any ions in the final water from this process consist essentially of hydrogen ions and hydroxide ions, which recombine to form pure water. Very pure DM water becomes highly corrosive once it absorbs oxygen from the atmosphere because of its very high affinity for oxygen. The capacity of the DM plant is dictated by the type and quantity of salts in the raw water input. However, some storage is essential as the DM plant may be down for maintenance. For this purpose, a storage tank is installed from which DM water is continuously withdrawn for boiler make-up. The storage tank for DM water is made from materials not affected by corrosive water, such as PVC. The piping and valves are generally of stainless steel. Sometimes, a steam blanketing arrangement or stainless steel doughnut float is provided on top of the water in the tank to avoid contact with air. DM water make-up is generally added at the steam space of the surface condenser (i.e., the vacuum side). This arrangement not only sprays the water but also DM water gets deaerated, with the dissolved gases being removed by a de-aerator through an ejector attached to the condenser. ===Fuel preparation system=== Conveyor system for moving coal (visible at far left) into a power station. In coal-fired power stations, the raw feed coal from the coal storage area is first crushed into small pieces and then conveyed to the coal feed hoppers at the boilers. The coal is next pulverized into a very fine powder. The pulverizers may be ball mills, rotating drum grinders, or other types of grinders. Some power stations burn fuel oil rather than coal. The oil must kept warm (above its pour point) in the fuel oil storage tanks to prevent the oil from congealing and becoming unpumpable. The oil is usually heated to about 100 °C before being pumped through the furnace fuel oil spray nozzles. Boilers in some power stations use processed natural gas as their main fuel. Other power stations may use processed natural gas as auxiliary fuel in the event that their main fuel supply (coal or oil) is interrupted. In such cases, separate gas burners are provided on the boiler furnaces. ===Barring gear=== Barring gear (or \\"turning gear\\") is the mechanism provided to rotate the turbine generator shaft at a very low speed after unit stoppages. Once the unit is \\"tripped\\" (i.e., the steam inlet valve is closed), the turbine coasts down towards standstill. When it stops completely, there is a tendency for the turbine shaft to deflect or bend if allowed to remain in one position too long. This is because the heat inside the turbine casing tends to concentrate in the top half of the casing, making the top half portion of the shaft hotter than the bottom half. The shaft therefore could warp or bend by millionths of inches. This small shaft deflection, only detectable by eccentricity meters, would be enough to cause damaging vibrations to the entire steam turbine generator unit when it is restarted. The shaft is therefore automatically turned at low speed (about one percent rated speed) by the barring gear until it has cooled sufficiently to permit a complete stop. ===Oil system=== An auxiliary oil system pump is used to supply oil at the start-up of the steam turbine generator. It supplies the hydraulic oil system required for steam turbine's main inlet steam stop valve, the governing control valves, the bearing and seal oil systems, the relevant hydraulic relays and other mechanisms. At a preset speed of the turbine during start-ups, a pump driven by the turbine main shaft takes over the functions of the auxiliary system. ===Generator cooling=== While small generators may be cooled by air drawn through filters at the inlet, larger units generally require special cooling arrangements. Hydrogen gas cooling, in an oil-sealed casing, is used because it has the highest known heat transfer coefficient of any gas and for its low viscosity which reduces windage losses. This system requires special handling during start-up, with air in the generator enclosure first displaced by carbon dioxide before filling with hydrogen. This ensures that the highly flammable hydrogen does not mix with oxygen in the air. The hydrogen pressure inside the casing is maintained slightly higher than atmospheric pressure to avoid outside air ingress. The hydrogen must be sealed against outward leakage where the shaft emerges from the casing. Mechanical seals around the shaft are installed with a very small annular gap to avoid rubbing between the shaft and the seals. Seal oil is used to prevent the hydrogen gas leakage to atmosphere. The generator also uses water cooling. Since the generator coils are at a potential of about 22 kV, an insulating barrier such as Teflon is used to interconnect the water line and the generator high-voltage windings. Demineralized water of low conductivity is used. ===Generator high-voltage system=== The generator voltage for modern utility-connected generators ranges from in smaller units to in larger units. The generator high-voltage leads are normally large aluminium channels because of their high current as compared to the cables used in smaller machines. They are enclosed in well-grounded aluminium bus ducts and are supported on suitable insulators. The generator high-voltage leads are connected to step-up transformers for connecting to a high-voltage electrical substation (usually in the range of 115 kV to 765 kV) for further transmission by the local power grid. The necessary protection and metering devices are included for the high- voltage leads. Thus, the steam turbine generator and the transformer form one unit. Smaller units may share a common generator step-up transformer with individual circuit breakers to connect the generators to a common bus. ===Monitoring and alarm system=== Most of the power station operational controls are automatic. However, at times, manual intervention may be required. Thus, the plant is provided with monitors and alarm systems that alert the plant operators when certain operating parameters are seriously deviating from their normal range. ===Battery-supplied emergency lighting and communication=== A central battery system consisting of lead–acid cell units is provided to supply emergency electric power, when needed, to essential items such as the power station's control systems, communication systems, generator hydrogen seal system, turbine lube oil pumps, and emergency lighting. This is essential for a safe, damage-free shutdown of the units in an emergency situation. ===Circulating water system=== To dissipate the thermal load of main turbine exhaust steam, condensate from gland steam condenser, and condensate from Low Pressure Heater by providing a continuous supply of cooling water to the main condenser thereby leading to condensation. The consumption of cooling water by inland power stations is estimated to reduce power availability for the majority of thermal power stations by 2040–2069. ==See also== * Boiler * Biochar processing in thermal power stations * Cogeneration aka combined heat and power * Cooling tower * Cost of electricity by source * Energy crop * Flue-gas stack * Fossil fuel power station * Geothermal power * Integrated gasification combined cycle * Iron powderTeam SOLIDMetal Powder: the New Zero-Carbon Fuel? * List of largest power stations * List of thermal power station failures * Nuclear power * Power station * Surface condenser * Water-tube boiler ==References== ==External links== * Thermal Power Plant:Indian Context * Conventional coal- fired power plant * Power station diagram * Power Plant Reference Books * Steam jet ejectors * Steam jet ejector performance guidelines * and video lectures by S.

They usually have an included angle of 60°, but in heavy machining situations an angle of 75° is used. The primary use of a center is to ensure concentric work is produced; this allows the workpiece to be transferred between machining (or inspection) operations without any loss of accuracy. A part may be turned in a lathe, sent off for hardening and tempering and then ground between centers in a cylindrical grinder. The preservation of concentricity between the turning and grinding operations is crucial for quality work. A center is also used to support longer workpieces where the cutting forces would deflect the work excessively, reducing the finish and accuracy of the workpiece, or creating a hazardous situation. A center lathe has applications anywhere that a centered workpiece may be used; this is not limited to lathe usage but may include setups in dividing heads, cylindrical grinders, tool and cutter grinders or other related equipment. The term between centers refers to any machining operation where the job needs to be performed using centers. A center is inserted into a matching hole drilled by a center drill. The hole is conical near and at the surface, and cylindrical, deeper. == Dead center (and live centre)== Revolving center (top) Dead center with carbide insert (bottom) A dead center (one that does not turn freely, i.e., dead) may be used to support the workpiece at either the fixed or rotating end of the machine. When used in the fixed position, a dead center produces friction between the workpiece and center, due to the rotation of the workpiece. Lubrication is therefore required between the center and workpiece to prevent friction welding from occurring. Additionally the tip of the center may have an insert of cemented carbide which will reduce the friction slightly and allow for faster speeds. Dead centers are typically fully hardened to prevent damage to the important mating surfaces of the taper and to preserve the 60° angle of the nose. As tungsten carbide is much harder than steel, a carbide-tipped center has greater wear resistance than a steel center. When turning between centres, a 'dead centre' is used in the headstock as well as the tailstock. As the one in the headstock revolves with the work, this centre is known as a live centre. == Soft center == Soft centers are a special version of the dead center in which the nose is deliberately left soft (unhardened) so that it may be readily machined to the correct angle prior to usage. This operation is performed on the headstock center to ensure that the center's axis is aligned with the spindle's axis. == Running or revolving center == A revolving center, also known as a running center in some countries, is constructed so that the 60° center runs in its own bearings and is used at the non-driven or tailstock end of a machine. It allows higher turning speeds without the need for separate lubrication, and also greater clamping pressures. CNC lathes use this type of center almost exclusively and they may be used for general machining operations as well. Spring-loaded centers are designed to compensate for center variations, without damage to the work piece or center tip. This assures the operator of uniform constant tension while machining. Some live centers also have interchangeable shafts. This is valuable when situations require a design other than a 60° male tip. A live center, which may be hard or soft, is a plain center placed in the revolving mandrel; it moves and is therefore live. == Pipe center == A pipe center, also known as a bull nose center is a type of live center which has a large diameter conical nose rather than a sharp point. This allows the center to be used in the bore of a pipe or other workpiece with a large interior diameter. While a pipe center ensures the workpiece remains concentric, its main advantage is that it supports the workpiece securely, and can be used for parts whose larger inner diameter prevents the use of a normal pointed center. Thin-walled material such as pipes easily collapses if excessive force is used at the chuck end. == Cup center == There are two types of cup centers. The woodworking variety is a variation of the traditional live center. This type of cup center has a central point like a normal live center and also has a ring surrounding it. The ring supports the softer material around the center point and prevents the wood from splitting under pressure from the central point. A different variety of cup center is used for metalworking. The metalworking variety of cup center has a tapered hole rather than a conical point. It supports the part by making contact with the outside diameter of the end of the part, rather than using a center hole. == Drive center == A drive center, also known as a grip center, is used in the driving end of a machine (headstock). It is often used in woodworking or where softer materials are machined. It consists of a dead center surrounded by hardened teeth, which bite into a softer workpiece allowing the workpiece to be driven directly by the center. This allows the full diameter of the workpiece to be machined in a single operation, in contrast with the usual requirement where a carrier is attached to the workpiece at the driven end. The use of modified shell end mills in a drive center, instead of hardened pins, enables better gripping and prevents breakdown time due to pin stop. == Spring center == A spring center is a metalworking lathe center for maintaining a cutting tool like a reamer or a tap, in axial alignment with a hole being worked on. It consists of a point backed by a spring to push the cutting tool into the workpiece. == References == Category:Woodworking Category:Lathes zh:車床#附件 ","title":"Lathe center"},{"id":"2549547","text":"Kaz Harada may refer to: *Kazuo Harada (died 1998), Japanese anime producer, audio director, and sound effects director * Kaz Harada, a fictional character based on him in the American-Japanese animated fantasy-comedy television series Hi Hi Puffy AmiYumi ","title":"Kaz Harada"},{"id":"2549553","text":"Vance Anderson Funk III (born December 16, 1942) is an American lawyer and politician from Newark, Delaware.

The team is an anthropomorphic funny animal parody of the Justice League of America. ==Team history== Just'a Lotta Animals originally appeared in the series Captain Carrot and His Amazing Zoo Crew! as the name of a superhero comic book written and drawn by Captain Carrot's alter ego, Roger Rodney Rabbit. Various panels of the Just'a Lotta Animals' comic that were shown in the Captain Carrot series were often parodies of classic Justice League storylines. The team was in fact the original proposal by Zoo Crew creators Roy Thomas and Scott Shaw for a funny animal superhero series for DC, but DC's editor Dick Giordano asked them to create original characters instead. They agreed and created the Zoo Crew, but still ended up introducing the Just'a Lotta Animals team in the series. In Captain Carrot and His Amazing Zoo Crew #14 and #15, in a storyline titled \\"Crisis On Earth-C!,\\" the Just'a Lotta Animals were finally revealed to actually exist, on a parallel Earth named \\"Earth-C-Minus\\" (as opposed to the world of the Zoo Crew, which was named \\"Earth-C\\"). The two teams united to defeat the villains of the story, Dr. Hoot (an owl mad scientist) and Feline Faust (a cat sorcerer; an analog of Justice League villain Felix Faust). The team's imagery was brought to life by a confused paranormal teenager in the second part of the \\"Young Justice: World Without Grownups\\" storyline.JLA: World Without Grownups ==Location== Just'a Lotta Animals lived on the parallel world of Earth-C-Minus, and made its headquarters in an orbiting satellite space station. Events and characters on Earth-C-Minus were considered to be fictional to natives of Earth-C, similar to how events and characters of Earth-Two were considered as fictional on Earth-One. Additionally, events and characters on Earth-C-Minus paralleled those of the then-mainstream DC Universe of Earth-One. Like Earth-C, the names of characters and locations tended to make heavy use of various animal-based puns. After the events of the 1985 miniseries Crisis on Infinite Earths, it was revealed that Earth-C-Minus (and Earth-C) survived intact, as they were actually \\"alternate dimensions\\" instead of parallel Earths,The Official Crisis on Infinite Earths Index, March 1986 although the most recent mini-series Captain Carrot and the Final Ark has suggested that Earth-C is now also considered Earth-26, one of the new 52 parallel Earths in the new DC Multiverse. ==Members== The main members of Just'a Lotta Animals are:Captain Carrot and His Amazing Zoo Crew #14, April 1983 *Super-Squirrel: a squirrel; analog of Superman. Super-Squirrel has a vast array of Chiptonian superpowers, including flight, super vision, and super strength. His main weakness was to chiptonite. Super-Squirrel lived in the city of Muttropolis. Super-Squirrel has a crush on Wonder Wabbit, and displays jealousy when she and Captain Carrot flirt with each other. Unlike Superman, Super-Squirrel comes off as somewhat pompous and self-aggrandizing, in contrast to the Man of Steel's more amiable personality. *The Batmouse: a mouse; analog of the Batman. Batmouse used a wide array of gadgets in his fight against his various foes, often with the aid of his sidekick, Boyd the Robin Wonder (a robin; analog of Batman's sidekick, Robin the Boy Wonder). *Wonder Wabbit: a rabbit; analog of Wonder Woman. Wonder Wabbit made use of her Animalzon superpowers and tools in fighting crime, including super strength, invulnerable bracelets, a magic lasso, and a see-through robot airplane. Wonder Wabbit originally came from Parrot-Eyes Island. *Green Lambkin: a male sheep; analog of the Silver Age Green Lantern. Green Lambkin used his power ring in fighting crime; however, his ring had two weaknesses: a 24-hour charge limit (after which it had to be recharged) and a weakness against the color yellow. Green Lambkin was a member of the Green Lambkin Corps, and served the Goat-Guardians of the planet Uh-Oh. *The Crash: a turtle; analog of the Silver Age Flash. The Crash was gifted with the power of superspeed. According to Captain Carrot #14, he was presumably inspired to become the Crash by reading comic books of (Earth-C's) the Terrific Whatzit as a youth, just as Barry Allen (the Flash of Earth-One) was inspired by reading comics of the adventures of Jay Garrick (the Flash of Earth-Two). *Aquaduck: a duck; analog of Aquaman. Aquaduck possessed the ability to swim at terrific speeds, survive the ocean depths, breathe underwater, and communicate telepathically with sea-based animals. Other members of Just'a Lotta Animals include: *The Green Sparrow: a sparrow; analog of Green Arrow. *The Stacked Canary: a canary; analog of Black Canary. *Hawkmoose: a moose; analog of the Silver Age Hawkman. *The Martian Anteater: an anteater from Mars (of the Earth-C-Minus universe); analog of the Martian Manhunter. *The Item: an elephant; analog of the Silver Age Atom. *The Elong- Gator: an alligator; analog of the Elongated Man. *Firestork: a stork; analog of Firestorm. *Zap-Panda: a panda; analog of Zatanna. *The Rat Tornado: a rat; analog of the Silver Age Red Tornado. ==Enemies== Enemies of Just'a Lotta Animals or its individual members include: *Kangar-Roo: a kangaroo; analog of Kanjar Ro.

Its name is identical to that of the Ipatiev Monastery in Kostroma, from where the Romanovs came to the throne. As an act for the 60th anniversary of the Russian Revolutions, it was demolished in 1977 by orders of the Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union to the local communist soviet government, almost 59 years after the Romanov family execution and 14 years before the dissolution of the Soviet Union itself in 1990–1991. ==History== Dining room, seen in the picture is the door to the grand duchesses' room in Ipatiev House (1918) In the 1880s, Ivan Redikortsev, an official involved in the mining industry, commissioned a two-story house to be built on the slope of a prominent hill. The length of the facade was 31 metres. In 1898, the mansion passed to Sharaviev, a gold dealer of tainted reputation. Ten years later, the house was acquired by Nikolai Nikolayevich Ipatiev, a military engineer, who turned the ground floor into his office. It seems to have been on the basis of information supplied by Pyotr Voykov that Ipatiev was summoned to the office of the Ural Soviet at the end of April 1918 and ordered to vacate what was soon to be called \\"The House of Special Purpose.\\" ===The Imperial family's stay and on-site execution=== The Imperial Romanov family moved in on 30 April 1918 and spent 78 days at the house. This household included Tsar Nicholas Romanov, his wife, the Tsarina Alexandra Fyodorovna of Hesse, their four daughters, their son and heir Alexei, the Tsarevich (crown prince); their court physician Dr. Yevgeny Botkin, chambermaid Anna Demidova, cook Ivan Kharitonov, and valet Alexei Trupp. They occupied four rooms on the upper story of the Ipatiev House, while their guards were housed on the ground floor. From early July, command of this guard was taken over by Yakov Yurovsky, a senior member of the Ural Soviet. The prisoners were permitted brief daily exercise in an enclosed garden. However, the windows to their rooms were painted over and they were kept in isolation from the outside. A high wooden fence was built around the outer perimeter of the house, closing it off from the street. About midnight on 16–17 July 1918, Commander Yurovsky entered the second-floor room of Dr. Botkin, who was awake and writing a letter. Botkin was told to awaken the Imperial family and their three remaining servants, so that the whole party could be evacuated from Yekaterinburg. The reason given was that the anti-Bolshevik White Army forces of Tsarist and moderate democratic socialists in the ensuing Russian Civil War of 1918–1921, were nearing the city and that there had been firing in the streets. After taking about half an hour to dress and pack, the Romanovs, Botkin and the three servants were led down a flight of stairs into the courtyard of the house, and from there through a ground-floor entrance to a small semi-basement room at the back of the building. Chairs were brought for Tsarevich Alexei and Tsarina Alexandra at the Tsar's request. The remainder of the party stood behind and to one side of the seated pair. After a while, Yurovsky and a party of armed men entered the basement room through the double doors. Ivan Plotnikov, history professor at the Maksim Gorky Ural State University, has established that the executioners were Yakov Yurovsky, G. P. Nikulin, M. A. Medvedev (Kudrin), Peter Ermakov, S. P. Vaganov, A. G. Kabanov, P. S. Medvedev, V. N. Netrebin, and Y. M. Tselms. Three Latvians refused at the last minute to take part in the execution.Plotnikov, Ivan (2003). О команде убийц царской семьи и ее национальном составе Журнальный зал, No. 9 Yurovsky spoke briefly to the effect that their Romanov relatives had attempted to save the Imperial family, that this attempt had failed and that the Soviets were now obliged to shoot them all. He and his squad then opened fire with pistols on the prisoners. The number of people crowded into a comparatively small area led to an inefficient and messy slaughter. The women among the prisoners had diamonds and jewelry concealed in their clothing, deflecting many of the bullets. It took between twenty and thirty minutes before all were killed. ===Demolition=== Church on the Blood, built on the spot where the Ipatiev House once stood. As early as 1923, the photographs of the fenced house were disseminated in the Soviet press under the label of \\"the last palace of the last Tsar\\". In 1927, the house was designated a branch of the Ural Revolution Museum. It then became an agricultural school before taking on new life in 1938 as an anti-religious museum. During this period it was customary for party apparatchiks to arrive in large tour groups, posing before the bullet-damaged wall of the cellar in which the former Tsar and his family had been murdered. In 1946, it was taken over by the local Communist Party. In 1974, it was formally listed as a Historical-Revolutionary Monument. However, to the embarrassment of the government, it was steadily becoming a place of pilgrimage for those who wished to honour the memory of the imperial family. In 1977, as the sixtieth anniversary of the Russian Revolution approached, the Politburo decided to take action, declaring that the house was not of \\"sufficient historical significance\\", and ordering its demolition. The task was passed to Boris Yeltsin, chair of the local party, who had the house demolished in September 1977.Archived Images He later wrote in his memoirs, published in 1990, that \\"sooner or later we will be ashamed of this piece of barbarism.\\" However, despite this action, the pilgrims kept coming, often in secret and at night, leaving tokens of remembrance on the vacant site. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union that was complete by 1991, the Church on the Blood, one of the largest in Russia, was built on the site. ==The spot where the cross is== On one side of the church, there is an orthodox cross which marks the location of the Romanov family’s death. Even during the Soviet Era, there were crosses in that area, but they changed over time. Different crosses would be replaced by new ones as the years went by. A small wooden structure was eventually built behind the cross and still stands near the church today; it can be seen in the picture on the right. ==In literature and drama== The house features as the setting for two plays: Ekaterinburg (David Logan, 2013) the title being an alternate romanization of Yekaterinburg) and The House of Special Purpose (Heidi Thomas, 2009). Both plays deal with the time in captivity spent inside the Ipatiev House by the Romanovs and their retainers.Logan, D. (2013).

He is a member of the National Academy of Science for his work with Anatol Morell in isolating the first cell receptor. ==Biography== Ashwell was born in Jersey City, New Jersey in 1916. After high school, he went to college to further his education. He attended the University of Illinois, where he earned his B.A.in 1938 and M.S. in 1941. He then went to Columbia University in New York, which was closer to his hometown, to spend two years doing research. In 1950, Ashwell joined the National Institute of Arthritis, Metabolism, and Digestive Diseases.Kresge, Nicole, Robert D. Simoni, and Robert L. Hill. “Hepatic Carbohydrate Binding Proteins and Glycoprotein Catabolism: the Work of Gilbert G. Ashwell.” The Journal of Biological Chemistry. n.d. Web. 11 March 2010. This Institute had grown and later split into two institutes, which are the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases and the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. Ashwell worked at the latter as an emeritus scientist after his retirement. ==Ashwell’s research== Ashwell’s goal as a researcher was to devise a labeling serum glycoproteins in order to study the role of ceruloplasmin in Wilson disease. With another researcher named Anatol G. Morell, he worked to propose that membrane lectins remove senescent circulating glycoproteins, and discovered one of the earliest known carbohydrate receptors. They were able to devise a labeling procedure which allowed them to remove enzymes of the glycoproteins' sialic acid residue. By completing this process, they were able to incorporate other substances into the protein. In 1974, Ashwell and Morell happened to discover that a certain receptor in a human’s liver is able to recognize a specific glycoprotein called asialoglycoprotein.“Gilbert Ashwell: Sweet on Science.” Nature Medicine. 2008. Web. 11 March 2010. Ashwell explained that he was not specifically looking for the asialoglycoprotein when he found it.

He is a warrior-hero of the region, venerated as a saint and a 'snake-god'. Although there are references to him in the folklore of Rajasthan, little historical knowledge of Gugga exists other than that he ruled the small kingdom of Dadrewa (in present day Rajasthan) and was a contemporary of Prithviraj Chauhan. ==Etymology== According to legend, Goga was born with the blessings of Guru Gorakhnath, who gave 'Gugal' fruit to Goga's mother Bachhal which was used to name him. Another belief is that he was called Goga because of his remarkable service to cows(Gou in Sanskrit). == Kingdom == Goga had a kingdom called Bagad Dedga near Ganganagar that spanned over to Hansi near Hisar in Haryana and included territory up to the river Sutlej in Punjab.Rajasthan [district Gazetteers].: Ganganagar (1972) It is believed that Goga lived during the 12th Century AD Gupta, Jugal Kishore: History of Sirsa Town In the past, the river Sutlej flowed through the district of Bathinda in present-day Punjab in India. The capital was at Dadrewa near Ganganagar. ==Legends== ===Family=== Goga () (Rajasthani: (Gugo) गुग्गो) was born in c. 900 AD to queen Bachchal (the daughter of a Rajput ruler, Kanwarpala who in 1173 AD ruled over Sirsa in present-day Haryana) and king Zewar in Dadrewa of the Chauhan Clan in the Churu district of Rajasthan. The earliest parts of Goga's life were spent in the village of Dadrewa, situated on Hissar—Bikaner highway in Sadulpur tehsil of Churu district in Rajasthan. According to other legends, his father was Vachha Chauhan, the Raja of Jangal Desh, which stretched from the Sutlej to Haryana.Census of India, 1961: India, Volume 1, Issue 4; Volume 1, Issue 19 ===Birth=== When Bachal was worshipping Gorakhnath, her twin-sister decided to usurp the blessings from the Gorakhnath. In the middle of the night, she wore her sister's clothes and deceived Gorakhnath into giving her the blessing fruit. When Bachal came to know about it, she rushed to Gorakhnath and said that she had not received anything. To this, Gorakhnath replied that he had already given his blessings and said that her sister was attempting to deceive her. After repeated requests by Bachal, Gorakhnath relented and gave her two Gugal candies. She distributed these candies to ladies having no child, including the 'blue mare' who was pregnant at that time. When the Guru gave the blessing to Bachal, he foretold that her son would become very powerful and would rule over the other two sons of their aunt, Kachal. ===Marriage=== Goga was married to Shreeyal Roz who was daughter of Tandul Nagari's King Sindha Singh. ===Other=== Another story is that Arjan and Sarjan were against Goga and was a part of conspiracy with king Anangpal Tomar of Delhi. King Anganpal attacked bagad region with Arjan and Sarjan. Both of them were killed by Goga. Goga spared the king after his miserere. In a quarrel about land he killed his two brothers on which account he drew upon himself the anger of his mother. ==Celebration and fairs== The cult of Goga falls within folk religion and therefore his followers include people from all faiths. Goga is popular as a Devta who protects his followers from snakes and other evils. He has been deified as a snake demigod and is a prominent figure among those who follow the Nāga cult in what is now Rajasthan and since the seventeenth century has been worshipped in the Western Himalayas also, possibly as a consequence of migration there from Rajasthan.Naga Cults and Traditions in the Western Himalaya: Omacanda Hāṇḍā He is particularly popular among those engaged in agrarian pursuits, for whom the fear of snakebite is common. Although a Hindu, he has many Muslim devotees and is chiefly considered to be a saint (pir) who had the power to cure the effects of poison (jahar). He was reputed to be a disciple of Guru Gorakhnath. According to Muslim oral tradition prevalent in Punjab, he learnt the way of entering and leaving solid earth by a Muslim Pir Hazi Rattan of Bathinda.Shivam Vij 18/01/2013 Goga is also believed to have lived for some time in Bathinda.James Todd (1920) Annals and Antiquities of Rajasthan: Or The Central and Western Rajput States of India, Volume 2 The cult is prevalent in Rajasthan and other states of northern India, including Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and the north western districts of Uttar Pradesh. His followers can also be found in Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh. ===Rajasthan=== His shrine, referred as medi (shortened colloquial term for Samādhi), consists of a one-room building with a minaret on each corner and a Hindu grave inside, marked by a Nishan (a symbol or sign), which is made up of a long bamboo with peacock plumes, a coconut, some colored threads and some handpankhas with a blue flag on the top. Worship of Goga starts in Bhaadra month of Hindu calendar. On the 9th of Bhadra, the people worship his symbol, a black snake painted on a wall. Worshippers take a fly-flap, known as chhari, round the village. Devotees pay their respect to it and offer churma. The Savayians sing devotional songs known as ‘Pir ke Solle’ in his honour to the accompaniment of deroos. Beating of deroos is the exclusive privilege of the Savayian community; others may sing, dance or offer charhawa. It is believed that the spirit of Gugga temporarily takes abode in the devotee dancer who lashes himself with a bunch of iron chains. People also open their rakhis on this day(bhadra krishna paksh navmi) and offer them to him. They also offer sweet puri (a type of sweet chappati) and other sweets and take his blessing. Grand fairs are held at samadhi sathal Gogamedi. Gogamedi is 359 km from Jaipur, in Hanumangarh district of Rajasthan. It is believed that Goga went into samādhi at Gogamedi. Thousands of devotees gather to pay homage at this memorial annually in the month of Bhadrapada during the Goga fair, which lasts for 3 days. The fair is held from the ninth day of the dark half of Bhadrapada (Goga Navami) to the eleventh day of the dark half of the same month. People sing and dance to the beats of drums with multicoloured flags called nishans in their hands. The songs and bhajans on the life history of Gogaji are recited accompanied by music played with traditional instruments like Damru, Chimta, etc. At his birthplace Dadrewa, the fair goes on over a month. Devotees from far eastern places of Dadrewa start arriving from the beginning of the auspicious month of Bhaadra. These devotees are commonly known as purbia (those who belong to east). It is a common sight to see people with snakes lying around their necks. According to a folklore in and around his birthplace Dadrewa it is believed that if someone picks up even a stick from johra (a barren land which has a sacred pond in Dadrewa), it would turn into a snake. Devotees of Gogaji worship him when they get a snake bite and apply sacred ash (bhabhoot) on the bite as an immediate remedy. ===Himachal Pradesh=== In Thaneek Pura, Himachal Pradesh, a very large scale festival and fair is organized on Gugga Navami. The tale of Gugga Ji is recited, from Raksha Bandhan to Gugga Naumi, by the followers who visit every house in the region. These followers while singing the tales of Gugga Ji carry a Chhat (a wooden umbrella) and people offer them grains and other stuff. They bring all the collected offerings to the temple and then the grand festival of Gugga Navami is celebrated for three days. Apart from various pujas and rituals, the wrestling competition (Mall or Dangal) is organized for three days where participants from all over the region compete. The annual three-day fair is also a part of these festivities where people come and enjoy great food, and shop for decorative items, handicrafts, clothes, cosmetics, household goods, and toys for children. ===Punjab=== Goga is known as Gugga in the Punjab who has a significant following. Many Punjabi villages have a shrine dedicated to Gugga. A fair is organised annually in the village of Chhapar and is known as the Chhapar Mela. Gugga's legacy in Punjab can be seen in towns such as Bareta Mandi, which is situated at a distance of 51 km from Mansa in Punjab. \\"The town is predominantly inhabited by Chauhans who trace their origin from Gugga, ‘Lord of Snakes’. It is said that nobody has ever died here on account of snakebite because of the blessings of Gugga.\\" In the Punjab region, it is traditional to offer sweet Vermicelli to the shrines of Gugga JiAlop ho riha Punjabi virsa – bhag dooja by Harkesh Singh Kehal Unistar Book PVT Ltd and sweet fried bread (mathya ()). He is worshiped in the month of Bhadon especially on the ninth day of that month. Gugga is meant to protect against snake bites and he is venerated in shrines known as marris. The shrines do not conform to any religion and can range from antholes to structures that resemble a Sikh Gurdwara or a Mosque. When worshipping Gugga, people bring noodles as offerings and also leave them in places where snakes reside.Bhatti, H.S Folk Religion Change and Continuity Rawat Publications People perform a devotional dance while dancing on the legendary songs of bravery sung in his praise. On the day of Gugga naumi, when offering the sweet dish, songs are sung which include: Punjabi: > ਪੱਲੇ ਮੇਰੇ ਮਥੀਆਂ > ਨੀ ਮੈਂ ਗੁੱਗਾ ਮਨਾਓੁਣ ਚੱਲੀਆਂ > ਨੀ ਮੈਂ ਬਾਰੀ ਗੁੱਗਾ ਜੀ > > Palle mere mathyaa > ni mein Gugga manaun challyaa > ni mein bari Gugga ji > Translation > I have got mathya > I am going to worship Gugga ji > Oh Gugga ji > == See also == *Akhariya Chauhan *Dadrewa *Chauhan *Thaneek Pura == References == ==Bibliography== * Category:Folk deities of Rajasthan Category:Regional Hindu gods Category:Hindu folk deities Category:Punjabi folklore Category:Punjabi folk religion Category:Hindu warriors Category:Punjabi culture ","title":"Gogaji"},{"id":"2549665","text":"Level Plane was an American independent record label based in New York City that was founded in early 1997 by Greg Drudy for the release of Saetia's first 7\\".

Khnumhotep () and Niankhkhnum () were ancient Egyptian royal servants. They shared the title of Overseer of the Manicurists in the Palace of King Nyuserre Ini, sixth pharaoh of the Fifth Dynasty, reigning during the second half of the 25th century BC. They were buried together at Saqqara and are listed as \\"royal confidants\\" in their joint tomb. They are notable for their unusual depiction in Egyptian records, often interpreted as the first recorded same-sex couple, a claim that has met considerable debate. ==Family== Khnumhotep and Niankhkhnum are believed by Thomas Dowson, Greg Reeder, and some other scholars to be the first recorded same-sex couple in ancient history. The assumed romantic relationship between Khnumhotep and Niankhkhnum is based on depictions of the two men standing nose to nose and embracing. Niankhkhnum's wife, depicted in a banquet scene, was almost completely erased in antiquity, and in other pictures Khnumhotep occupies the position usually designated for a wife. Their official titles were \\"Overseers of the Manicurists of the Palace of the King\\" (see sections Titularies, Banquets and music). Critics argue that both men appear with their respective wives and children, suggesting the men were brothers, rather than lovers. Khnumhotep and Niankhkhnum are depicted in the tomb with their respective families. It has been proposed that they were the sons of Khabaw- khufu and Rewedzawes. They appear to have had three brothers named Titi, Nefernisut, and Kahersetef. Three possible sisters are also attested. They are named Neferhotep-hewetherew, Mehewet and Ptah-heseten. Niankhkhnum's wife was named Khentikawes. The couple appear in the tomb with three sons named Hem-re, Qed-unas and Khnumhezewef, and three daughters, Hemet-re, Khewiten-re and Nebet. At least one grandson is attested, Irin-akheti, the son of Hem-re and his wife, Tjeset. Khnumhotep had a wife by the name of Khenut. Khnumhotep and Khenut had at least five sons named Ptahshepses, Ptahneferkhu, Kaizebi, Khnumheswef and Niankhkhnum the younger (possibly named after the tomb owner), as well as a daughter named Rewedzawes. ==Careers== Egyptian records note Khnumhotep and Niankhkhnum as the heads manicurists for the royal family, but they may have held a number of different official titles and duties ===Bureaucrats=== On duty at the sun temple, Niankhkhnum or Khnumhotep may have watched over subordinate officials, such as the m-r pr Sna \\"overseer of the magazines\\" who in turn supervised crews of porters stocking and withdrawing material from the granaries and store-rooms ===Manicurists, hairdressers, and adorners=== Manicurist at work, Dyn. 5 (reconstruction). He holds tablet for steadying client's hand by pressing it against his knee; trims nails with a flint knife. One is among reliefs in this tomb.Care of the king's body and wardrobe in preparation for his public appearances required a large number of aides, apparently working in different ateliers each under its own leadership. In addition to the manicurists whom Niankhkhnum and Khnumhotep supervised (discussed in the titulary section of this article), the palace had attendants under one or more men holding the title jrj nfr HAt \\"keeper of the headdress,\\" responsible for the king's wigs and headcloths, jrw Snj \\" hairdressers, who kept him shaven, and an m-r n jzwj Xkrwt nswt \\"overseer of the two chambers of king's adorners.\\" The post of Xkrt nswt \\"adorner of the king\\" was always held by women, who were legally, if not socially, equal to men in Egypt. Neferhotep-Hathor is labeled with this status at the funeral procession of Niankhkhnum and Khnumhotep. How, or how often, personnel in the hairdressers' shop, which from titulary evidence stands higher than the manicurists in 5th and 6th Dynasty prestige rankings, communicated with the latter remains unknown. No hairdressers are labeled at the funeral procession. Ptahshepses, the keeper of the headdress who became Nyussere's vizier, and Ti, overseer of the pyramids and sun temples, are two officials whom Niankhkhnum and Khnumhotep may have worked with. Both Khnumhotep and Niankhkhnum are attested on a harvest scene in the splendid burial estate of Ptahshepses, where they may have been quarry supervisors, yet named as jr ant pr aA \\"palace manicurists,\\" quite junior to titulary in their own tomb, which could mean Ptahshepses died while they were younger. A door jamb, besides TAtj \\"vizier,\\" displays the title HAt-a \\"one whose arm is in front,\\" a pure honorific Allen distinguishes from the m-r and jrj titles specifying responsibility domains we've encountered up to now. The jrj nfr HAt \\"keeper of the headdress\\" epithet, recorded in many of the rooms, is spelled with the mouth sign (Gardiner D21), not the eye sign (D4), so that it shares the introductory word of jrj-pat \\"hereditary prince,\\" another of Allen's honorifics. ==The tomb== Two wrestlers, tomb of Baqet III at Beni Hasan, 11th Dynasty (ca. 2000 BC), Egypt. The hieroglyphic text above the figures is a standard votive formula to the god Osiris, ultimately on behalf of the tomb owner. The mastaba of Khnumhotep and Niankhkhnum. The tomb of Khnumhotep and Niankhkhnum was discovered by Egyptologist Ahmed Moussa in the necropolis at Saqqara, Egypt in 1964, during the excavation of the causeway for the pyramid of King Unas. It is the only tomb in the necropolis where men are displayed embracing and holding hands. In addition, the men's chosen names (both theophorics to the creator-god Khnum) form a linguistic reference to their closeness: Niankhkhnum means \\"life belongs to Khnum\\" and Khnumhotep means \\"Khnum is satisfied;\\" The precise king and regnal date of this tomb are unknown; style places it in the latter 5th Dynasty under Nyuserre or Menkauhor. No human remains were discovered inside. It is believed the tomb was built in stages, first a sequence of two chambers cut into the limestone of a low escarpment in the northern area of Saqqara, then a surface-built mastaba structure added to mate with the earlier construction. This would have occurred as the two intended occupants gained resources. In a banquet scene, Niankhkhnum and Khnumhotep are entertained by dancers, clappers, musicians and singers; in another, they oversee their funeral preparations. In the most striking portrayal, the two embrace, noses touching, in the most intimate pose allowed by canonical Egyptian art, surrounded by what would appear to be their heirs. === Titularies === Egyptian tombs feature lists of titles and epithets honoring the deceased or held during life, often giving titles for other persons who appear on a wall. For Niankhkhnum and Khnumhotep, the titulary may be condensed as follows: False doors of Niankhkhnum and Khnumhotep, inner hall. Khnumhotep's door on the right, with an offering table scene above the paired watchmen. Niankhkhnum's matching door, left, is damaged and not shown. Titles and names go above the embracing pair portrait, identical except for name itself. These correspond to numbers (2), (4), (6), (8) in this section. Areas marked \\"text\\" contain the Htp dj nswt formula and other benedictions; see section \\"Offering formulas in the tomb\\" in this article. Adapted from Moussa & Altenmüller. Held by either or both men: # m-r jr ant pr aA \\"overseer of manicurists (literally, 'those who do fingernails') in the palace.\\" pr aA means \\"the great house,\\" the name for the center of power, at Memphis during the Old Kingdom.

A peculiar hieroglyphic grapheme in this title, a device of three seat signs (denoting plural noun) followed by a pyramid, is seen on a gold seal purportedly found in Turkey, a demonstration of official use of a pyramid establishment title for signing documents. # wab nswt \\"one who purifies the king.\\" (a personal priest to the king) # nb jmAx nTr aA \\"lord of those who are honored before the great god\\" (an aspirational title signifying donations to the individual's mortuary estate from the king; see subsection on jmAx below) ====The Hrj sStA and control of information by the state==== The title Hrj sStA \\"keeper of the secrets\\" is attested for 13 individuals during the Old Kingdom, at least once elaborated to the form Hr sStA mdw-nTr \\"keeper of the secrets of the god's words,\\" meaning the hieroglyphic language used on monuments. In contrast with the hieratic script used for everyday record- keeping, already an elite activity, the content of hieroglyphic texts was closely controlled property of the state and permission from the king was probably required for inscriptions in one's tomb, as we see in a royal authorization for Rawer, an official under Neferirkare buried at Giza, to do so. ====The jmAx concept as proximity to king and god, in life and hereafter==== jmAx xr nTr aA \\"honored one near the great god\\" is a euphemism for \\"dead,\\" appearing frequently in tombs and on slab stelae, even though it, like the word (and goddess) mAat, evokes a multifarious idealization of relationships between social and cosmological ranks. Epithets beginning with jmAx are common throughout Egyptian history from the 4th Dynasty on, tending toward greater specificity in later periods. An official or family member could possess several, both jmAx xr nTr aA \\"honored before the great god\\" (when dead) and jmAx xr nswt \\"honored before the king\\" (presumably in life). It is important to realize that king and god themselves can be one and the same, especially upon death, as Amenemhat I would be in the early Middle Kingdom story of Sinuhe. The goal of kingship, after maintaining social order (mAat) in Egypt, was to ascend and unite with the sun disk of Heliopolitan theology, maintained from Old Kingdom until the arrival of Christianity.Since jmAx can also be translated as \\"provided for,\\" the connection an official's tomb holds with royal subsidy is made implicit; although officials built their tombs using mainly their own resources once the 4th Dynasty (and Khufu's largess at Giza) ended. === Forecourt entrance with architrave and pillars === A two-pillared portico makes up the eastern half of the mastaba's façade. The front is inscribed with Niankhkhnum depicted on the left, Khnumhotep on the right. These two reliefs are virtually identical, only the names being different. === Interior of forecourt === This space is fairly small. The west side is decorated with a funerary procession for Niankhkhnum and the east side shows a matching funerary procession for Khnumhotep. Khnumhotep (left) and Niankhknum (right) enjoy taking game in the papyrus marshes that dot Egypt's landscape. See text for discussion; click image to enlarge and view tiny family members dispersed about the men. Osirisnet The uppermost south wall shows the two men seated before an offering table. Niankhkhnum is seated on the right, while Khnumhotep is seated on the left. The table with offerings stretches out between them. Below the offering scene the two men are depicted netting fowl and fishing. On the left, below this lintel, Khnumhotep stands on a papyrus boat, spearing fish in the water that floods the bases of papyrus stalks he drifts among. He is accompanied by his wife Khenut, sons and a daughter. On the right, Niankhkhnum is depicted in a similar manner, aiming his throw stick at the waterfowl although the active arm is now missing from this piece. === Outer vestibule === East wall in the first chamber. At the entrance scenes of baking bread and brewing beer are depicted. Barley is carefully measured out and turned into bread. Other scenes include goat herding, ship building, harvesting scenes, sailing, netting of birds, etc. The east wall contains a legal text. Below this text several people are depicted thought to be the family of the two men. At the very bottom ships are shown. The men are shown standing before the main cabin of the ship. === Court (open to sky) === An undecorated space which serves to connect the vestibule and chambers on the north end of the mastaba with the abutting rock-cut sections of the tomb to their south. Modern security grates now obstruct much of the full sun that would have flooded this small, walled yard, yet little or no sun fell on the vestibule to the outer rock-cut hall described below, as its entrance faces north. === Inner vestibule === With names, titles, and standing portraits of the two men, it is much smaller than the other vestibule and without pillars. The lintel's inside surface features another cattle count scene, and each tomb owner appears on one of the side walls with his wife, amid a flow of yet more offerings from the herds. === Outer hall === Niankhkhnum (standing, left) and Khnumhotep (right, with his right arm on Niankhkhnum's shoulder), accompanied by their offspring (hieroglyphic notations msw.f). On west wall of outer hall, between double doors. This outer hall, an antechamber to the final, inner hall, marks the tomb's first, rock- cut phase of construction, and is fully decorated. Before the mastaba was added, it would have been the first room a visitor entered after passing through the forecourt, which was relocated northeast to the far side of the mastaba where it is now. Here, people engage in agricultural occupations including the weighing of corn and grain, the ploughing of fields, and harvesting. A double doorway to the inner hall is on the west wall, with a broad pillar dividing the doors. Its surface depicts the two men, their children, drawn much smaller to reflect a lesser status, in tow behind each parent. The respective wives do not appear in this scene. Niankhkhnum has three sons and three daughters, Khnumhotep five sons and one daughter, some of whom may be adopted or conceived by a second wife or mistress as they lack the shendyt kilts worn by the others. All the children except Niankhkhnum's youngest son, who still runs naked with his shaved head bearing the single sidelock of youth, are adults despite the scale they are drawn at. Ptahshepses, a son of Khnumhotep, wore the youth sidelock in the marsh scene of the forecourt but not so here. Either inconsistency intrudes, or the art, completed over years, reflects some changes of status which transpire during the tomb's construction. === Inner hall === See text for discussion. Reeder. Now on the reverse side of the dividing pillar, Niankhknum and Khnumhotep embrace again, and a third time on the opposite wall of this small chamber. They are without their children in this innermost sanctuary. Each man has a \\"false door,\\" a carved, slot-like niche surrounded by inscriptions which was produced in the royal workshops and installed in the tomb. Niankhknum's is seriously damaged. The false door provided an accessway for the deceased, as a spiritual being, to reach offerings left at the tomb by the living. These offerings were to be set on plinths in front of the false doors. Behind the false doors is a small statue closet known as the serdab. A statue of each man would have been placed here, facing the chamber as if to watch visitors come and go, but invisible to the offering-bringers since the false doors are actually solid. It appears that tomb robbers removed the statues in antiquity; they are no longer extant. === Banquets and music === The Banquet: Offering tables with Khnumhotep's (left) and Niankhkhnum's names, titles; two registers of musicians and dancers below.After Altenmüller (2008).(top) Relief from tomb of Ti, Saqqara, Dyn. 5, with musicians and dancers. (inset) Detail of stela of Nefret-iabet, Giza, reign of Khufu, Dyn. 4. Note the leopard skin dress Nefret-iabet wears, the red color with black rim band on jar, and the water issuing from it, painted details not normally preserved in ancient art.The banquet scene (first image) shows Niankhkhnum clean-shaven (left) and Khnumhotep (wearing a short beard) seated facing one another across comestibles spread between, each with his own breadboard table. Set off by a baseline, this is read separately from the two registers of entertainment below them. A different upper register substitutes in the contemporary Saqqara tomb of Ti (next image), where no food is present with the owner, who is seated holding a scepter, his wife (drawn at half-scale) by his feet. ==Funeral procession== Longevity and circumstances of the tomb owners' deaths are unknown. The limestone sarcophagi beneath the mastaba were ransacked and wooden coffins of later date interred in the burial chambers. Booth, citing others, adheres to the theory that Khnumhotep died first, leaving Niankhkhnum to complete the tomb's art. This conclusion was drawn from Khnumhotep's jmAx epithets (see Titulary section), a style of beard he wears, and exclusion of his wife at the banquet scene when Niankhknum's was originally there. ===The mourners and relatives=== alt=A Four of the rows show people walking in single file. Familial relationships stay unclear in Egyptian tombs: Only the pictures of wives (Hmt.f \\"his wife\\"), daughters (zAt.f), and sons (zA.f) bore genealogical notations. Reeder identifies Niankhkhnum and Khnumhotep themselves at the rear of Khabau-Khufu's line; he and the woman behind him are Niankhkhnum's parents. This woman and Khnumhotep are the only paraders who do not place their left hands upon their hearts, but use them to hold the hand or arm of the person in front of them, suggesting a degree of intimacy between them and the persons they grasp (Khabau-Khufu or Niankhkhnum, respectively). More of the deceased's children plus some of foggier status appear, including Ankhredwi-nesut, police captain Khnumhezuf, palace manicurist Kasetef, and Hemre's wife Tjeset. Sekhem, a scribe of the pr HD \\"white house,\\" is both here and behind Niankhkhnum in the forecourt marsh scene, where he had a namesake on Khnumhotep's side, albeit with additional post of inspector of Hm-kA priests marked. In Reeder's interpretation, absence of Khnumhotep's parents here matching absence of his wife at the banquet, is consistent with Khnumhotep predeceasing his afterlife roommate. Other officials in line and in the next register (where figures are smaller) include supervisors of weavers, manicurists, Hm-kA priests, and scribes.{{rgroup=notenote10. Uncertain precise relationship connects Niankhkhnum and Khnumhotep as well; Altenmüller considers them brothers, Baines that they were twins, and Reeder that they were same-sex conjugal or domestic partners evidenced by iconography normally used for husband and wife, or, with Khnumhotep, for women (sniffing the lotus blossom). ==See also== * Homosexuality in ancient Egypt ==Notes== ==References== ==Literature== *Ahmed Moussa & Hartwig Altenmüller (1977), Das Grab des Nianchchnum und Chnumhotep.

Disney, son of Roy O. and Edna Disney, saw an opportunity for the California Institute of the Arts (CalArts) in Santa Clarita to have a presence in downtown Los Angeles. With the approval of The Walt Disney Company's Board of Directors and support from the County of Los Angeles, the project's lead architect, Frank Gehry, whose children also graduated from CalArts, was tasked to design the new venue. Roy Disney and his wife Patty personally matched the Disney Company gift for REDCAT's construction and, to extend the memory of Roy O. Disney who built The Walt Disney Company with Walt and oversaw the construction of CalArts' campus, dedicated the new art center to his parents' name. CalArts President Steven D. Lavine cites the pairing of high caliber renegade experimentation and a social space for artist-community engagement, especially those in London (e.g. The Cottesloe Theatre as part of the Royal National Theatre), as a pointed consideration for the venue design and its conception as an institutional laboratory. Mark Murphy was brought on board as executive director of REDCAT to guide the vision of the new organization. He observed a dearth of interdisciplinary art spaces in Los Angeles the likes of Yerba Buena Center for the Arts, Wexner Center for the Arts, and the Walker Art Center, or the Alte Oper in Frankfurt and the Hebbel am Ufer in Berlin. This impetus propelled initiatives for commissioned works, artist residencies, collaborations, and public programs to facilitate dialogue on the creative city within the world arts arena. Harvey Lichtenstein, president and executive producer of the Brooklyn Academy of Music, was brought in as a consultant during the development phases of REDCAT during 1999. The performances at REDCAT are funded and presented in part by The REDCAT Council. Current council members include: Diane Levine (Chair), Edgar D. Arceneaux, Joseph M.

The Blue Night Network is the overnight public transit service operated by the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The network consists of a basic grid of 27 bus and 4 streetcar routes, distributed so that almost all of the city is within 2 km of at least one route. It is the largest and most frequent night network in North America. ==Overview== This Blue Night stop at Avenue Road is served by the 300 Bloor–Danforth route. ===Hours=== The times of Blue Night service vary according to individual scheduling situations on each route. Most regular service bus and streetcar routes cease operations at approximately 1:30 a.m. If there is a Blue Night route on the same street, its first trip will then follow at a suitable interval after the last regular run. On the subway system, the last trains on each line make a complete trip; the last trains running east, west, and north from Bloor–Yonge and St. George stations each leave at 1:50 a.m. or just after. Each station then closes as the last train passes it. In the morning, regular bus and streetcar service mostly takes over from the corresponding Blue Night routes around 5:30a.m, or 8:00a.m. on Sundays. The first trains on the subway then start from various positions along the routes, allowing all stations to open more or less simultaneously just before 6:00a.m., or 8:00a.m. on Sundays. The Blue Night routes that parallel the subway lines keep running until that time, and their last buses terminate service at a subway station to facilitate transfers to the trains. ===Fares=== Normal TTC fares apply on the Blue Night Network. Passengers can transfer to or from regular-service routes as usual. Additionally, TTC passes valid for the previous day are honoured until 5:30a.m. the next day, rather than midnight. ===Routes=== Blue Night routes operate with frequencies of every 30 minutes or better. Blue Night routes are distinguished from regular routes by numbers in the 300 series. Numbering on these routes can correspond to a day route, such as 301 Queen being Blue Night for 501 Queen. Routings are often combinations of multiple-day routes or slight alterations to their corresponding day route. Most routes are operated by TTC's fleet of low-floor buses, where applicable, making them fully accessible for handicapped and wheelchair users. Four routes operate with streetcars: the 301 Queen, the 304 King, the 306 Carlton, and the 310 Spadina. As of January 2020, all of these routes are operated with accessible Flexity Outlook streetcars. ==History== ===Before the Blue Night Network=== Toronto has had overnight streetcar service since the days of the Toronto Railway Company in the 1890s, and the TTC continued it when they took over in 1921. The routes selected for 24-hour service were those serving 24-hour employers such as factories, stockyards, and railway yards. Over the years various streetcar routes were replaced by other modes, and where new subway lines replaced streetcars during regular hours, buses were put on overnight. But the overnight routings remained largely unchanged for decades, even after the TTC's service area expanded in 1954 from the Toronto city limits as they then were, to include the whole of Metropolitan Toronto (\\"Metro\\", which in 1998 became the present amalgamated city of Toronto). Only one overnight route (the Queen streetcar, later 501 Queen, to Long Branch loop) extended a significant distance into the suburbs. In 1974, after the subway had been extended beyond the Toronto city limits in three directions, the same was done for overnight bus service. But large areas of Metro still remained without 24-hour transit -- Etobicoke, North York, and Scarborough each had only one or two routes -- as late as 1986, when the TTC's planning department issued a report on Metro All-Night Transit Service calling for major changes. ===1986 report=== The report pointed out that the importance of the original \\"demand generators\\" for overnight public transit had declined. Nightly demand was now twice as heavy on weekends as on weekdays, showing that not many people were using transit to get to night work. And as Metro had grown, only 45% of its population still lived within a 15-minute walk of the existing 24-hour transit routes. In fact, hardly any of the 14 overnight routes then in existence were strictly justified by demand any more, particularly on weekdays. But since \\"one of the TTC's primary goals is to maximize mobility and accessibility to transit service\\", the report's recommendation was to redesign the system, not eliminate it. Most of Toronto has a squarish grid of main streets that originated as township roads and are spaced at 1¼-mile intervals (about 2 km). By running overnight buses along every second road in the grid, all parts of Metro would be reached and 86% of the population would be within a 15-minute walk (taken as 1.25 km or ¾ mile). To avoid excessively long trips, some grid streets such as Eglinton Avenue would require two bus routes meeting end-to- end, but still just 15 routes would be needed to form the grid. The 506 Carlton route had sufficient traffic to be retained in addition, for a total of 16 routes. This is what the report proposed. In changing from the old network of 14 routes to the new set of 16, only 2 routes would be entirely unchanged. There would be 11 entirely new overnight routes (all bus-operated), with 7 existing ones eliminated (3 streetcar, 3 trolleybus, and only 1 bus route, as the night network would be shifted away from the streetcar tracks and trolleybus wires). Despite the route eliminations and probable increased ridership, the changes could not be expected to finance themselves. The report recommended reducing service frequencies after 10 p.m. on certain routes in order to offset the increased costs. ===Establishment=== The Commission agreed to the expanded service, but could not stomach the elimination of so many routes. Instead, they chose to retain all existing routes despite the cost, creating a 23-route night system. Until this time, with the exception of buses that replaced subway lines, it had been understood that overnight transit was provided by regular routes that happened to have 24-hour service. Night services retained the same route names and numbers as their daytime counterparts, perhaps with a suffixed letter if there was a variation in the exact routing. But now a marketing decision was made to treat the overnight service as a new, distinct set of routes, even in those cases where the day route was identical. The name Blue Night Network was adopted, and with it the 300-series route numbers described above, and a new color-coding for bus and streetcar stops. The existing standard TTC-stop sign had a red square or stripe at the top and bottom; now, for all stops with 24-hour service, this was changed to red and blue, with the legend \\"24 hr\\" added.Streetcar at a 24-hour stop (JPG). (Photo taken at Humber Loop on a fan trip.) Those stops used only for the Blue Night Network, mostly for night routes paralleling the subway, received the standard sign with red changed to blue (and a notice of the limited hours). The Blue Night Network debuted in February 1987. ===Later changes=== In the 1990s, the TTC suffered major funding cuts and service on many low-traffic routes was reduced; the Blue Night Network lost three routes in February 1992, selected from those proposed for elimination in 1986. But other routes have been extended or added over the years, including one case (312 St. Clair in 2000) that required a mode conversion from streetcar to bus. In February 2003, two Blue Night routes were extended to reach Toronto Pearson International Airport. Then in 2005, several routes were added so that east–west service would run on every grid street instead of alternate ones in much of the city. This has brought the Blue Night Network up to a total of 24 routes, serving 97% of the city's population within a 15-minute walk. In the fall of 2015, the TTC expanded the Blue Night Network program, with 16 new or revised routes incorporated into the network as part of a $95 million investment made by Toronto City Council. This included the restoration of streetcar service on King Street as the 304 King and on Spadina Avenue as the 310 Spadina, operating entirely with low-floor Flexity streetcars. , the 310 Spadina, 306 Carlton, 304 King, and 301 Queen operate using accessible Flexity streetcars. ==References== ==External links== * TTC official website * Annual planning Review of Overnight Services, January 2005 (PDF) ===Maps=== * 1982 overnight route map and timetables (scanned, PDF) * 1988 Blue Night Network map and timetables (scanned, PDF) * Current official Blue Night Network map (PDF) Category:Toronto Transit Commission Category:Bus routes in Canada Category:Night bus service Category:1987 establishments in Ontario ","title":"Blue Night Network"},{"id":"2549795","text":"Two bioswales for a housing development. The foreground one is under construction while the background one is established. Bioswales are channels designed to concentrate and convey stormwater runoff while removing debris and pollution. Bioswales can also be beneficial in recharging groundwater. Bioswales are typically vegetated, mulched, or xeriscaped. They consist of a swaled drainage course with gently sloped sides (less than 6%). Construction Engineering Research Laboratory. Document no. ERDC/CERL TR-03-12. Bioswale design is intended to safely maximize the time water spends in the swale, which aids the collection and removal of pollutants, silt and debris. Depending on the site topography, the bioswale channel may be straight or meander. Check dams are also commonly added along the bioswale to increase stormwater infiltration. A bioswale's make-up can be influenced by many different variables, including climate, rainfall patterns, site size, budget, and vegetation suitability. It is important to maintain bioswales to ensure the best possible efficiency and effectiveness in removal of pollutants from stormwater runoff. Planning for maintenance is an important step, which can include the introduction of filters or large rocks to prevent clogging. Annual maintenance through soil testing, visual inspection, and mechanical testing is also crucial to the health of a bioswale. Bioswales are commonly applied along streets and around parking lots, where substantial automotive pollution settles on the pavement and is flushed by the first instance of rain, known as the first flush. Bioswales, or other types of biofilters, can be created around the edges of parking lots to capture and treat stormwater runoff before releasing it to the watershed or storm sewer. ==Contaminants addressed== Bioswales work to remove pollutants through vegetation and the soil. As the storm water runoff flows through the bioswale, the pollutants are captured and settled by the leaves and stems of the plants. The pollutants then enter the soil where they decompose or can be broken down by bacteria in healthy soil. There are several classes of water pollutants that may be collected or arrested with bioswales. These fall into the categories of silt, inorganic contaminants, organic chemicals and pathogens. * Silt – How bioswales and plants are constructed slow the conveyance of silt and reduce the turbidity of receiving waters. Filters can be established to capture debris and silt during the process. * Organics – Many organic contaminants including Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons will volatilize or degrade over time and Bioswales slow the conveyance of these materials into waterways, and before they can affect aquatic life. Although not all organic material will be captured, the concentration of organic material is greatly reduced by bioswales. * Pathogens – are deprived of a host or from a nutrient supply long enough for them to become the target of a heterotroph. * Common inorganic compounds are macronutrients such as phosphates and nitrates. Principal sources of these nutrients comes from agricultural runoff attributed to excess fertilization. Excess phosphates and nitrates can cause eutrophication in disposal zones and receiving waters. Specific bioswale plants absorb these excess nutrients. * Metallic compounds such as mercury, lead, chromium, cadmium and other heavy metals are concentrated in the structures. Unfortunately, these metals slowly poison the surrounding soil. Regular soil removal is required in order to prevent metals from dissolving and releasing back into the environment. Some bioswales are designed to include hyperaccumulator plant species. These plants absorb but do not transform the metals. Cuttings from these plants often decompose back into the pond or are pruned by gardening services that do not know the compost they are collecting is poisonous. == Best locations == Bioswales can be implemented in areas that require stormwater management to regulate the runoff velocity and decontaminate the runoff. Bioswales are created to handle the first flush of pollutants during the event of rain, therefore, locations that have high areas of impervious surface such as roads, parking lots, or rooftops can benefit from additions of bioswales. They can also be integrated into road medians, curb cutouts, sidewalks, or any public space. == Benefits == Bioswales are useful low-impact development work to decrease the velocity of stormwater runoff while removing pollutants from the discharge. They are extremely beneficial in protecting surface water and local waterways from excessive pollution from stormwater runoff. The longer the runoff stays within the bioswale, the better the pollutant removal outcome. It is also beneficial in removing standing ponds that could potentially attract mosquitos. Bioswales can also be designed to be aesthetically pleasing and attract animals and create habitats. Bioswales can also be beneficial for groundwater recharge. == Maintenance == Improper maintenance can lead to high restoration costs to address inefficient bioswales. An accumulation of large sediments, trash, and improper growth of vegetation can all affect the quality and performance of bioswales. It is beneficial at the planning stages to set apart easements to allow for easier maintenance of biowales, whether it be adequate space to locate machinery or safety to those working. Different types of filters can be used to catch sediments. Grass filter strips or rock inlets can be used to filter sediments and particulates; however, without proper maintenance, runoff could flow away from the bioswales due to blockage. Structural inlets have become more common due to the ease of maintenance, use, and its effectiveness. Avoiding the use of floating mulch and selecting the best fit low-maintenance plants ensure better efficiency in the bioswales. Depending on a community's needs for a bioswale, a four step assessment program can be developed. Visual inspection, capacity testing, synthetic runoff, and monitoring are the four steps that can be used to evaluate performance and maintenance of bioswales. Routine inspection is required to ensure that the performance and aesthetics of bioswales are not compromised. Time and frequency of inspections vary based on different local governments, but should occur at least once a year. Various aspects of inspection can take place, either visually or mechanically. Visual observation of the vegetation, water, and inlets are all crucial to ensure performance. Some organizations utilize checklists to streamline the visual inspection process. There are different methods to determine if a bioswale needs maintenance. Bioswales are benchmarked to meet a specific level of infiltration to determine if maintenance is required. A staff gauge is used to measure the infiltration rate. Soil chemistry testing is also required to determine if the soil has a certain off-level of any pollutant. Phosphorus and high levels of salinity in the soil are two common pollutants that should be attended to. Analysis of inflow and outflow pollutant concentration is also another way to determine the performance level of bioswales. Maintenance can span to three different levels of care. Aesthetic maintenance is required to remove weeds that affect the performance of the other plants and the bioswale itself, clean and remove trash, and maintaining the looks of the vegetation. Partial restoration is needed when the inlet is blocked by sediments or when vegetation needs to be replaced. Full restoration is required when the bioswales no longer filter pollutants adequately and overall performance is severely lacking. == Design == Bioswales experience short, potentially intense, periods of rain, flooding and pollutant loading followed by dry seasons. It is important to take into account how the vegetation selected for the bioswales will grow and understanding what types of plants are considered the best fit. There are four types of bioswales that can be constructed based on the needs of the location. * Low grass bioswales utilizes low growing grass that can be landscape, similar to lawns. These types of bioswales tend to be less effective than vegetated bioswales in treating stormwater runoff and sustaining an adequate collection time. * Vegetated bioswales are created with taller growing plants, ornamental vegetations, shrubs, and even trees. These types can also be lined with rocks to slow down the velocity of stormwater runoff that is flowing through bioswales to increase collection time for decontamination. Vegetated bioswales can also include vegetation that is highly useful in removing certain chemicals in runoffs very efficiently. * Low water use bioswales are helpful in areas that tend to be drier with hotter climate. Xeriscape bioswales are populated with runoff generally only after rain and storms and stay dry otherwise. * Wet bioswales are similar to wetlands in which they retain water for a much longer period of time that allows for infiltration of stormwater instead of simply emptying the water at the end of the bioswale into storm drain inlets. Bioswales require a certain soil composition that does not contain more than 5% clay. The soil itself before implementation should not be contaminated. Bioswales should be constructed with a longitudinal slope to allow sediments to settle. Maximum slope of bioswales is 3:1. A minimum clearance is required to ensure that other infrastructure would not be damaged. The overfill drain should be located at least 6 inches above the ground plain to allow for maximum concentration time of stormwater runoff in the bioswales. Rocks can also be used to slow down the runoff velocity. The use of filters is important to prevent inlets from becoming blocked by sediments or trash. ==Examples== Two early examples of scientifically designed bioswales for large scale applications are found in the western US. In 1996 for Willamette River Park in Portland, Oregon a total of 2330 lineal feet of bioswale was designed and installed to capture and prevent pollutant runoff from entering the Willamette River. Intermittent check dams were installed to further abet silt capture, which reduced by 50% suspended solids entering the river system. A second example of a large scale designed bioswale is at the Carneros Business Park, Sonoma County, California. Starting in 1997 the project design team worked with the California Department of Fish and Game and County of Sonoma to produce a detailed design to channel surface runoff at the perimeter of a large parking area. Surface runoff consists of building roof runoff, parking lot runoff and overland flow from properties to the north of the project site. A total of two lineal miles of bioswale was designed into the project. The purpose of the bioswale was to minimize runoff contaminants from entering Sonoma Creek. The bioswale channel is grass-lined, and nearly linear in form. Downslope gradient is approximately 4% and cross-slope gradient is approximately 6%.Lumina Technologies (1998). Hydrology and biology studies for Carneros Business Park, prepared for the William A. Saks Company pursuant to requirements of the County of Sonoma. Approximately 2000 bioswales are projected to be installed in New York City to protect the city's combined sewer system. A relatively recent project established was the Seattle, Washington Street Edge Alternatives project, completed in 2001. Rather than using traditional piping, SEA's goal was to create a natural landscape that represented what the area was like before development. The street was 11% more pervious than a standard street and was characterized with evergreen trees and bioswales. The bioswales were planted on graded slopes with wetland and upland plants. Other landscaping also focused on native and salmon-friendly plants. SEA provided a strong benefit for stormwater runoff mitigation that helped continue to protect Seattle's creek ecology. The project street also created a more inviting and aesthetically pleasing site as opposed to hard landscaping. ==See also== * Bioretention * Infiltration * Rain gardens * Riparian zone * Soil contamination * Storm water * Sustainable drainage system * Urban runoff * Water-sensitive urban design ==References== == External links== *Combating Climate Change with Landscape Architecture Resource Guide *Sustainable Residential Design: Improving Water Efficiency * Category:Environmental engineering Category:Environmental soil science Category:Hydrology and urban planning Category:Gardening aids Category:Landscape Category:Waste treatment technology Category:Stormwater management Category:Water conservation ","title":"Bioswale"},{"id":"2549806","text":"Bachelor Island is a small barren rock just off the northeastern coast of Naushon Island in Massachusetts.

Scholars argue that Pushkin's account may be inaccurate due to the author’s desire to elevate the status of his ancestors and family. There are a number of contradictions between the biographies of Pushkin and the German novel The Blackamoor of Peter the Great, based on his great-grandfather. An historical biography by Gannibal's son-in-law, Rotkirkh, was largely responsible for the myth, propagated by some historians, that Gannibal was born in Ethiopia.Gee, Maggie. \\"Dark star of the Enlightenment.

However, more recent research by the scholars Dieudonné Gnammankou and Hugh Barnes has established that the general was instead likely born in Central Africa, in an area bordering Lake Chad in present-day Cameroon. ===Abduction=== Richard Pankhurst, the former professor at the Institute of Ethiopian Studies at the University of Addis Ababa in Ethiopia, believed the young Abram, Ibrahim or Abraham, as he named him, was born around 1698. He was the son of a minor \\"prince\\" or chief whose capital was Logon (now part of present-day Cameroon). His father was relatively affluent, owning many slaves both inherited and taken in battle. He had several wives and 19 children. However, after his father died in battle trying to defend his territory from the Ottoman Turks, Abram was captured and taken to Constantinople by ship (see Slavery in the Ottoman Empire). His sister, Lagan, is said to have drowned in the sea in a desperate attempt to save her brother. Abram stayed in the Ottoman Empire for about a year in the service of Sultan Ahmed III's household. At the time, the Russian ambassador Sava Vladislavich-Raguzinsky, representing Peter the Great, was looking for \\"a few clever little African slaves\\" for the Tsar's palace in Moscow, as was the custom in those days at the great courts in Europe. On orders of Vladislavich's superiors (one of whom was Pyotr Andreyevich Tolstoy, great- grandfather of the celebrated writer Leo Tolstoy), Abram was selected for this purpose and soon ransomed from the Sultan's viziers with a bribe. In 1704, the ambassador immediately dispatched him by land to Moscow in order to be presented to Tsar Peter the Great. The Tsar is noted to have taken a liking to the boy’s intelligence and potential for military service, and brought the child into his household. Abram was baptized in 1705, in St. Paraskeva Church in Vilnius, with Peter as his godfather. The date of Gannibal’s baptism held personal significance; he used that date as his birthday because he did not know his actual date of birth. Abram valued his relationship with his godfather, as well as that of Peter's daughter (Elizabeth), and was loyal to them as if they were family. Starting at a young age, the boy Abram would travel alongside the emperor during his military campaigns, and at these military journeys he served as his godfather’s valet.Blakely, Allison.

In 1717, Abram was sent to Metz to receive an education in the arts, sciences and warfare from the highest institutes available. By then he was fluent in several languages and excelled in mathematics and geometry. In 1718 Abram joined the French Army with hopes of pleasing his godfather by expanding his learning in military engineering. He enrolled in the royal artillery academy at La Fère in 1720. During Abram's studies, conflict broke out between France and Spain, and he fought for France in the War of the Quadruple Alliance, rising to the rank of captain. While fighting in the French war against Spain, Abram received a head injury and was captured by the Spanish army. He was released in 1722 and continued his studies in Metz. It was during his time in France that Abram adopted the surname \\"Gannibal\\" in honor of the Carthaginian general Hannibal (Gannibal being the traditional transliteration of the name in Russian).Schmemann, Serge. \\"Of African Princes and Russian Poets.\\" The New York Times, November 12, 2010.

Ganibal (note only one 'n') on 22 March 1744. Tallinn City Archives. Portrait of German-Russian General Ivan Ivanovich Möller-Sakomelsky (identified by Natalya Teletova, others identify it as a portrait of Abram Petrovich Gannibal) Gannibal's education was completed by 1723, and he was due to return to Russia. After the death of Peter in 1725, Prince Menshikov gained power in Russia due to his good standing with Peter. However, Menshikov was not fond of Gannibal and was suspicious of his foreign origins and superior education. Gannibal was exiled to Siberia in 1727, some 4,000 miles to the east of Saint Petersburg. He first traveled to Kazan, then to Tobolsk and Irkutsk, and then to Selenginsk near the Mongolian border. He was pardoned in 1730 due to his technical skills, and completed his service in Siberia in 1733. During this time he built a fortress and led several construction projects, where he became a master engineer. Elizabeth of Russia became the new monarch in 1741. Gannibal became a prominent member of her court, rose to the rank of major-general, and became superintendent of Reval (now Tallinn, Estonia), a position he held from 1742 to 1752. A letter signed on 22 March 1744 by \\"A. Ganibal\\" is held at the Tallinn City Archives. In 1742, the Empress Elizabeth gave him the Mikhailovskoye estate in Pskov Oblast with hundreds of serfs.Gnammankou, Dieudonné. Abraham Hanibal – l’aïeul noir de Pouchkine. Paris: Presence Africaine, 1996. . 129. Retrieved May 25, 2016. He retired to this estate in 1762. In an official document that Gannibal submitted in 1742 to Empress Elizabeth, while petitioning for the rank of nobility and a coat of arms, he asked for the right to use a family crest emblazoned with an elephant and the mysterious word \\"FVMMO\\", which may mean \\"homeland\\" in the Kotoko language. In his book, Gannibal: The Moor of Petersburg, Hugh Barnes writes of meeting with the sultan of Logone-Birni, who gave him the same translation of the word. However, Frances Somers-Cocks, author of The Moor of St Petersburg: In the Footsteps of a Black Russian, met the same sultan and received a different translation for FVMMO. She also suggested that FVMMO stands for the Latin expression Fortuna Vitam Meam Mutavit Omnino which means \\"Fortune has changed my life entirely.\\" ==Family== Gannibal married twice. His first wife was Evdokia Dioper, a Greek woman. The couple married in 1731. Dioper despised her husband, whom she was forced to marry. The marriage between Dioper and Gannibal was very volatile, and he suspected her of infidelity early in their marriage.Parry, Albert (1923). \\"Abram Hannibal, the Favorite of Peter the Great.\\" Journal of Negro History 8.4: 359–66. JSTOR. Retrieved May 25, 2016. Gannibal’s suspicions were confirmed when Dioper gave birth to a white daughter. When Gannibal found out that she had been unfaithful to him, he had her arrested and thrown into prison, where she spent eleven years. Gannibal began living with another woman, Christina Regina Siöberg (1705–1781), daughter of Mattias Johan Siöberg and wife Christina Elisabeth d'Albedyll, and married her bigamously in Reval, in 1736, a year after the birth of their first child and while he was still lawfully married to his first wife. His divorce from Dioper did not become final until 1753, upon which a fine and a penance were imposed on Gannibal, and Dioper was sent to a convent for the rest of her life. Gannibal's second marriage was nevertheless deemed lawful after his divorce. Gannibal’s second marriage to Christina was much happier, and he appreciated her fidelity and affection towards him. On her paternal side, Gannibal’s second wife was descended from noble families in Scandinavia and Germany: Siöberg (Sweden), Galtung (Norway), and Grabow (Denmark) / von Grabow (Brandenburg). Her paternal grandfather was Gustaf Siöberg, Rittmester til Estrup, who died in 1694, whose wife Clara Maria Lauritzdatter Galtung (ca. 1651–1698) was the daughter of Lauritz Lauritzson Galtung (ca. 1615–1661) and of Barbara Grabow til Pederstrup (1631–1696). Abram Gannibal and Christine Regina Siöberg had ten children, including a son, Osip. Osip in turn would have a daughter, Nadezhda, the mother of Alexander Pushkin. Gannibal's oldest son, Ivan, became an accomplished naval officer who helped found the city of Kherson in southern Ukraine in 1779 and attained the rank of general-in-chief, the second-highest military rank in imperial Russia. Some British aristocrats descend from Gannibal, including Natalia Grosvenor, Duchess of Westminster and her sister, Alexandra Hamilton, Duchess of Abercorn. George Mountbatten, 4th Marquess of Milford Haven, a cousin of Queen Elizabeth II, is also a direct descendant, as the grandson of Nadejda Mountbatten, Marchioness of Milford Haven.

Until recent scholarly field work, it was generally assumed that he originated in Ethiopia.Marsden, Phillip. \\"From Slave to Slav.\\" theguardian.com, October 21, 2005. Retrieved June 6, 2016. Chiefly Russian scholars for many years believed that he was from the vicinity of Medri Bahri, an ancient kingdom in present-day Eritrea.*Smith (1957, p. 245) postulates that \\"Logon\\" stood \\"on the northern side of the Mareb River in what is now called Eritrea\\". *Troyat (1957, p. 244) asserts that the place of Hannibal's origin was \\"on the banks of the Mareb River in what is now Eritrea\\". *N. Ismailov posits that the Logon was located in the \\"Hamasien Eritrean plateau\\" (see Pankhurst, 1961, p. 423). *Yosief (2000, pp. 36–40) notes that at the time, the overall ruler of Medri Bahri Eritrea was Degezmati Habtesulus of Tseazega, who was in control of the region from 1679 till 1719. In a letter he wrote to Empress Elizabeth, Peter the Great's daughter, Gannibal stated that he was from the town of \\"Logon\\" or \\"Lagone\\". Anthropologist Dmitry Anuchin wrote an essay about Alexander Pushkin in which he theorized that \\"Lagone\\" referred to Logo-chewa in Eritrea. In 1999, the Russian Institute in Addis Ababa, the capital of Ethiopia, also campaigned for a commemorative stamp to honor Pushkin's bicentennial. The governments of Ethiopia and Eritrea each claim that Gannibal was born in their respective territories. Under this belief, the Ethiopian government named a street in Addis Ababa after Alexander Pushkin, Gannibal's great-grandson. It also placed a bust of him near the African Union headquarters in 2002, and arranged for a statue of Pushkin to be transferred from Moscow to Addis Ababa in 2014.\\"Addis Abab awaits Pushkin statue from Moscow.\\" www.worldbulletin.net, October 8, 2014.

It also erected its own statue of Pushkin and named a street for him in 2009. Vladimir Nabokov cast doubt on Gannibal's ancestry, based on research findings during his work translating Pushkin's novel Eugene Onegin. Nabokov disagreed with Anuchin's theory, stating that it was just as likely that Gannibal was referring to \\"the Lagona region of equatorial Africa, south of Lake Chad.\\" Support for Anuchin's theory of Ethiopian birth declined after it was exposed as racially based, implying that \\"hamitic\\" Ethiopian origins better explained Gannibal's success than \\"negroid\\" origins. The Beninese historian Dieudonné Gnammankou, an expert on Russia, studied Russian, French and African sources and argued that Gannibal was indeed from Logone- Birni and was most likely the son of a chief in the ancient sultanate. In 1995, Gnammankou asserted that the \\"Logon\\" Gannibal wrote about was actually Logone, capital of the old Kotoko kingdom of Logone-Birni, now located in northern Cameroon. He believed that the pattern of slave trade around Lake Chad made that region a more plausible likelihood for Gannibal's birthplace than Gondar, Ethiopia. Gnammankou's biography of Gannibal was translated into Russian, and was voted the best book on Pushkin at the 1999 Moscow Book Fair. Gnammankou's findings were in turn buttressed by the field work of Hugh Barnes. After consulting with the Sultan of Logone-Birni, Barnes found that an inscription on Gannibal's crest, which was hitherto undecipherable, corresponded with the term for \\"homeland\\" in the local Kotoko language of central Africa. ===Honor at La Fère=== In November, 2010, representatives from Russia and Estonia, the ambassador of Cameroon, and the sultan of Logone-Birni went to La Fère, France to unveil a commemorative plaque honoring Abram Petrovich Gannibal as a graduate of La Fère's royal artillery academy. The academy, which closed in the 1990s, had been started by King Louis XV shortly before Gannibal's enrollment there in 1720. The plaque declares that he was a graduate of the royal artillery academy of La Fère, and later became chief military engineer and general-in-chief of the Imperial Russian Army. It also notes that Gannibal is the great-grandfather of Alexander Pushkin, Russia's greatest poet. Dieudonné Gnammankou, whose research into Gannibal's background was largely responsible for the ceremony at La Fère taking place, also served as the main speaker at a symposium following the event. ==Popular culture== Coat of arms of Abram Gannibal ===Literature=== Alexander Pushkin used his great-grandfather Abram Gannibal as the model for Ibrahim, the lead character in his unfinished novel The Moor of Peter the Great.

The film is partly based on Pushkin's Moor of Peter the Great.\\"Tale of How Tsar Peter Married off His Negro.\\" www.rusfilm.pitt.edu, 2006. Retrieved June 10, 2016. There are several portraits thought to depict Gannibal, which include a painting of the Battle of Lesnaya by Pierre-Denis Martin the Younger. The young boy present in Martin’s painting is argued to be Gannibal, because of the young boy’s role as valet to Peter during military campaigns and Gannibal’s possible connection to the artist while in France. A portrait by Adriaan Schoonebeeck is also believed to portray Gannibal during his time with Peter the Great. In Schoonebeeck’s portrait of Peter the Great, the young servant boy directly behind Peter is thought to be Gannibal. Although there are a variety of portraits that claim to contain Gannibal, there is little evidence to suggest the claims are accurate. In the Lesnaya painting, the young boy is dressed in traditional slave attire, which Gannibal did not wear due to his status under Peter the Great. ==See also== *Afro-Russian *Representation of slavery in European art *List of enslaved people ==Notes== ==References== ==Biographies== * Life of Ganibal, D.

Via the Potomac River, its waters are part of the Chesapeake Bay watershed, leading to the Atlantic Ocean. The Little Cacapon enters the Potomac at an elevation of near the community of Little Cacapon. For the majority of its course the Little Cacapon is a shallow non-navigable stream. It has been historically referred to as both Little Cacapehon and Little Capecaphon. The name is pronounced or . Creekvale The Little Cacapon is formed at the confluence of two small streams, the North Fork Little Cacapon and the South Fork Little Cacapon, shortly after they both pass north under the Northwestern Turnpike (U.S. Route 50) at Frenchburg. From Frenchburg, the Little Cacapon flows north between Town Hill, high, to its west and Little Cacapon Mountain, high, to its east. Flowing from a hollow in Town Hill, Shawan Run feeds into the Little Cacapon at Barnes Mill. Two miles (3 km) north, Three Churches Run also feeds into the river from Town Hill. At Higginsville on Slanesville Pike (County Route 3) near the old Vinita School, the river is fed by Crooked Run at Queens Ridge ( high). From Higginsville, the Little Cacapon continues northeast along Town Hill with Noland Ridge bounding it to the east. Also in the vicinity of Higginsville, Little Cacapon- Levels Road (County Route 3/3) intersects with Slanesville Pike, and as its name suggests, the road follows the Little Cacapon north until it diverges northwest to Levels via Hoffman Hollow. It is within this stretch of the stream that the Little Cacapon meanders by the community of Creekvale. At the entrance of Neals Run, the Little Cacapon is met to its east by Spring Gap Mountain and then flows beneath the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad and empties into the Potomac River. == Bridges == { class = \\"\\" !

South Branch Mountain ( high) joins the North Fork to its west, and along with Stony Mountain to its east, the river diverges from Grassy Lick Road and continues its northeastern route to Shanks where it meets US Route 50. From Shanks, the North Fork merges with Camp Run and flows east under US Route 50 at Frenchburg, where it merges with the South Fork to create the Little Cacapon River. == South Fork Little Cacapon River == The South Fork is an tributary of the Little Cacapon. The South Fork is formed at its headwater in a hollow towards the southeastern end of Stony Mountain along South Fork of Little Cacapon Road (County Route 12) between the communities of Kirby and Ruckman. From its source, the South Fork flows northeast toward Bell Hollow, where it meets US Route 50 and turns north through Frye's Flat towards Frenchburg.

These measures involve the participation of all levels of society, including defence, internal security, border and infrastructure security, civil defense, and gives special focus on areas such as medical readiness and psychological preparedness. == Strategy == Singapore's main counter-terrorism strategy includes cooperation with regional and international partners to achieve a transnational landscape of security. Singapore is instrumental in the passage of international initiatives such as the landmark United Nations Security Council Resolution 1373 which established the legal basis for international action against terrorism. It is also at the forefront of the Southeast Asian counter- terrorism efforts and a United States partner in the Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI) that aims to combat the illicit trade and spread of weapons of mass destruction. In recent years, Singapore's counter-terrorism initiatives have created political criticism from the country's Muslim population. This was particularly pronounced when Singapore joined the international community's call for Iraq's disarmament, which eventually led to the American invasion of the country. ==Timeline== These are the events related to terrorism and counter-terrorism in Singapore.

The SAF was deployed to defend against mock attacks at key installations around the island. Home Team and the Singapore Civil Defence Force were deployed to counter a mock hostage taking at Bishan Mall. The exercise was the largest in Singaporean history, involving over 3200 officers. It was conducted with the mission statement to raise public awareness of \\"the current threat landscape and to encourage continued vigilance.\\" ==Arrest of Jemaah Islamiah members== The main terrorist threat to Singapore is from Jemaah Islamiah (JI), which has links to al-Qaeda and Abu Sayyaf. Jemaah Islamiah is known to have carried out the Bali bombing in 2002, which killed 202 people, as well as the Jakarta bombing in 2004 outside the Australian embassy, killing 11 people. After the 11 September 2001 attacks on the United States, an informant revealed information to the Singapore Internal Security Department regarding Muhammad Aslam Yar Ali Khan, a Singaporean of Pakistani descent, who was a member of a group partnered with Al-Qaeda. Muhammad Aslam Yar Ali Khan was placed under surveillance by Singapore Internal Security Department, after which he left for Pakistan on 4 October. This man was captured by Afghan Northern Alliance forces in Afghanistan. His interrogation led investigators to more Jemaah Islamiah members in Singapore. On 9 December 2001, 13 suspects were arrested. Soon after that, a video found in an abandoned house in Kabul, Afghanistan showed a narrator in Singapore describing how to attack Americans using explosives. Investigators found similar tapes at the residences of the arrested men. In all, 33 men were arrested in relation to this plot. In August 2002, another 21 members of Jemaah Islamiyah were arrested, demolishing JI's Singaporean cell. Arrests were also made in Malaysia, Philippines, Indonesia and Thailand. As of 11 November 2005, 36 alleged members of JI or the Moro Islamic Liberation Front were being detained under the Internal Security Act. However, Singapore believes that Jemaah Islamiyah remains active in Southeast Asia and is recruiting new members. On 25 August 2005, French investigating magistrate Jean-Louis Bruguière singled out Singapore along with Tokyo and Sydney as potential terrorism targets of the Al-Qaeda. The Ministry of Home Affairs later responded that it had not received any specific information on imminent terrorist threat against Singapore, but added that security measures have been taken to strengthen security at borders, key infrastructure and iconic buildings. == Homeland security == The Singapore Police Force has in recent years enhanced security at various locations in the country. On 15 August 2005, the newly established Public Transport Security Command began operational patrols on the Mass Rapid Transit network to protect the public transportation system. Personnel from the Special Operations Command (SOC) and the Gurkha Contingent (GC) have also been deployed to complement other police officers on patrol. In addition, the Police Coast Guard (PCG) stepped up its effort to inspect ferries and other vessels in Singapore territorial waters. On 26 October 2005, Deputy Prime Minister and Co-ordinating Minister for Security and Defence S Jayakumar announced that Singapore was developing an early warning system, called the Risk Assessment and Horizon Scanning, to identify and assess new emerging threats to national security. The system, developed by the National Security Coordination Secretariat, will be put in place by mid-2007. == Counter terrorist specialised units == At the forefront in the fight against terrorism are specialised military, law enforcement, and civil defence units, namely: * Singapore Special Operations Force, * Special Operations Command, * Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Explosive Defence Group, * Army Deployment Force ==Additional power to military== In May 2007, the parliament passed an amendment to the SAF Act, giving additional powers to the Singapore Armed Forces. A select group of about 2,000 SAF personnel will be trained to perform security operations in designated areas. These personnel, identified by a Military Security identification card, will be able to search, detain and use reasonable force against terror suspects. ==Exercise Northstar V== On 8 January 2006, a large scale emergency preparedness exercise was conducted. Codenamed Exercise Northstar V, it involved 22 agencies and 2,000 emergency personnel. An additional 3,400 commuters also participated in the exercise. The exercise involved a simulated terrorist bomb attack on four MRT stations (Raffles Place, Dhoby Ghaut, Toa Payoh and Marina Bay) and one bus interchange (Toa Payoh). There were 500 mock casualties suffering from \\"injuries\\" caused by the \\"explosions\\" as well as chemical agents. The exercise is the largest civil emergency exercise ever staged in the country. ===Conduct of the exercise=== The exercise started at 6:25 am local time on 8 January 2006, a Sunday, and lasted about three hours. To avoid public panic, announcements were made at the affected train stations as well as on television and radio, just before the exercise began. Prominent signages were also displayed. Mock explosive devices, such as thunderflashes were detonated near-simultaneously in subway trains and station platforms at four MRT stations (Dhoby Ghaut, Toa Payoh, Raffles Place and Marina Bay) and in a double decker bus at Toa Payoh Bus Interchange. A chemical agent attack was then simulated at Dhoby Ghaut at 6:45 am. An undetonated mock bomb was also placed at the Raffles Place. About 3,400 commuters who were on board the subway trains were evacuated during the drill. Services at 13 MRT stations were temporarily disrupted and roads within the vicinity were also closed to traffic. Shuttle buses were used to ferry commuters affected by the exercise. Thunderflashes, smoke generators, and fire simulators were used to simulate the explosion and 500 simulated casualties were deployed to test emergency rescuers at the scene. These mock casualties carried tags to provide paramedics information on the extent of their injuries and this includes injuries related to bomb blasts, such as open wounds and burns. There were also some with injuries related to chemical agents. Dummy mannequins were also used to simulate casualties. 7 hospitals and 2 polyclinics were also involved in the drill as they received the mock casualties. In two hospitals, Singapore General Hospital and Tan Tock Seng Hospital, healthcare workers donned decontamination suits as they prepared to treat victims of chemical agents suspected to be sarin gas.

Details of the investigation were shared to explain that the arrests were not targeted at the Singapore Muslim community, or Islam. In schools and workplaces, inter-racial confidence circles were formed to promote inter-racial and inter-religious understanding between the different racial and religious communities, while Islamic scholars and counselors in Singapore participated in the rehabilitation of the detained JI members. ==See also== * Kiddy Bag * Religious Rehabilitation Group (Singapore) ==References== ==External links== * \\"Constructing\\" the Jemaah Islamiyah Terrorist: A Preliminary Inquiry (PDF) – Institute of Defence and Strategic Studies, Singapore, October 2004 * Maritime Couner-Terrorism: A Singapore Perspective (PDF) – Joshua Ho, Institute of Defence and Strategic Studies, Singapore, 2004 * Beyond Madrid: Winning Against Terrorism – Speech by Goh Chok Tong at the Council on Foreign Relations (6 May 2004) * Funding Terrorism in Southeast Asia: The Financial Network of Al Qaeda and Jemaah Islamiyah (PDF) – National Bureau of Asian Research (December 2003) * Jemaah Islamiyah in South East Asia: Damaged but Still Dangerous – International Crisis Group (26 August 2003) * Declaring JI a terror group is starting point in fight against terror: Dr Gunaratna – Channel NewsAsia (2 October 2005) * Asean leaders ink terrorism pact ","title":"Counter-terrorism in Singapore"},{"id":"2549872","text":"1888 map of Boston Harbor showing Apple Island before the airport was built.

Noddle's Island, Hog Island, Bird's Island and Governor's Island were the others. ==History== Distinguished in its early years by waving elms but hard to access because of its expansive flats at low tide, the 10-acre Apple Island was initially part of the town of Boston, used for sheep and cattle grazing. It fell into the private hands of Thomas Hutchinson, father of Royal Governor Thomas Hutchinson, in 1723. Hutchinson the elder willed the island to an English mariner in 1802 , and a gentleman named Mr. Marsh purchased it for $550 in 1822. Marsh died in 1833 and was buried on the island's western slope, and his home burned down two years later. Abandoned for years, Apple Island was reacquired by the City of Boston in 1867 and sold to private citizens. Inhabitants were known to haul wrecked steamships onto the island and burn them for their copper and iron parts. These ships included the James Adger, the Baltic (the last steamship in the Collins line), and the Ontario, built in Newburyport for the Transatlantic trade.Sweetser, M.F.

In 1991, under the administration of the chairman Luiz Góes, Ypiranga became a professional team. In 1992, Ypiranga reached its first professional competition title, after winning the state championship. The players of that team were Maurício, Zé Preta, Ponga, Cid and Neirivaldo, Edgar, Edvaldo and Serginho, Tiaguinho, Miranda and Jorginho Macapá, managed by Dadá Maravilha, who had won the 1970 World Cup as a player. ==Titles== * Campeonato Amapaense: 1976, 1992, 1994, 1997, 1999, 2002, 2003, 2018. * Campeonato Amapaense Second Division: 1987. * Amateur Campeonato Amapaense Second Division: 1964. ==Stadium== Ypiranga's home stadium is Estádio Milton Corrêa, usually known as Zerão, inaugurated in 1990, with a maximum capacity of 5,000 people.

One use of reaction norms is in describing how different species—especially related species—respond to varying environments. But differing genotypes within a single species may also show differing reaction norms relative to a particular phenotypic trait and environment variable. For every genotype, phenotypic trait, and environmental variable, a different reaction norm can exist; in other words, an enormous complexity can exist in the interrelationships between genetic and environmental factors in determining traits. The concept was introduced by Richard Woltereck in 1909. == A monoclonal example == Approximately linear norms at opposite slopes Scientifically analyzing norms of reaction in natural populations can be very difficult, simply because natural populations of sexually reproductive organisms usually do not have cleanly separated or superficially identifiable genetic distinctions. However, seed crops produced by humans are often engineered to contain specific genes, and in some cases seed stocks consist of clones. Accordingly, distinct seed lines present ideal examples of differentiated norms of reaction. In fact, agricultural companies market seeds for use in particular environments based on exactly this. Suppose the seed line A contains an allele a, and a seed line B of the same crop species contains an allele b, for the same gene. With these controlled genetic groups, we might cultivate each variety (genotype) in a range of environments. This range might be either natural or controlled variations in environment. For example, an individual plant might receive either more or less water during its growth cycle, or the average temperature the plants are exposed to might vary across a range. A simplification of the norm of reaction might state that seed line A is good for \\"high water conditions\\" while a seed line B is good for \\"low water conditions\\". But the full complexity of the norm of reaction is a function, for each genotype, relating environmental factor to phenotypic trait. By controlling for or measuring actual environments across which monoclonal seeds are cultivated, one can concretely observe norms of reaction. Normal distributions, for example, are common. Of course, the distributions need not be bell-curves. == Reaction norm from an inbred population == One advantage of plants is that the same genotype, such as a recombinant inbred line (RIL), can be repeatedly evaluated in multiple environments, or a multi- environmental trial (MET). The reaction norm can then be explored based on the geographic location, mean trait value summarized from the whole population at each environment, or an explicit performance-free index capturing relevant environment inputs. == Misunderstanding genetic/environmental interactions == Popular non-scientific or lay-scientific audiences frequently misunderstand or simply fail to recognize the existence of norms of reaction. A widespread conception is that each genotype gives a certain range of possible phenotypic expressions. In popular conception, something which is \\"more genetic\\" gives a narrower range, while something which is \\"less genetic (more environmental)\\" gives a wider range of phenotypic possibilities. This limited conceptual framework is especially prevalent in discussions of human traits such as IQ, Sexual orientation, altruism, or schizophrenia (see Nature versus nurture). Popular conception of genotype/phenotype interaction TRAIT SCALE <\\\\--6 ----------5----------4----------3----------2----------1----------0--> ^ (Genotype A) ^ ^ (Genotype B) ^     Environ <\\\\------> Other Environ <\\\\------> Other extreme extreme extreme extreme The problem with this common simplified image is not that it does not represent a possible norm of reaction. Rather, by reducing the picture from two dimensions to just one, it focuses only on discrete, non-overlapping phenotypic expressions, and hides the more common pattern of local minima and maxima in phenotypic expression, with overlapping ranges of phenotypic expression between genotypes. == See also== *Canalisation (genetics) *Differential Susceptibility *Genetic determinism *Nature versus nurture *Phenotypic plasticity == References == Category:Ecology ","title":"Reaction norm"},{"id":"2549916","text":"Mar Emmanuel III Delly (, ) (27 September 1927 – 8 April 2014) was the Patriarch Emeritus of Babylon of the Chaldeans and former Primate of the Chaldean Catholic Church, an Eastern Catholic sui juris particular church of the Catholic Church, and also a Cardinal. An ethnic Assyrian, he was born in Tel Keppe and was ordained a priest on 21 December 1952. He was consecrated a bishop ten years later in December 1962 at the age of 35. He was elected Patriarch of the Chaldean Church on 3 December 2003, succeeding the late Patriarch Raphael I Bidawid. He was created a Cardinal Bishop on 24 November 2007. ==Birth== Patriarchial See of Babylon Karem Delly was born in Tel Keppe, in northern Iraq, on 27 September 1927 to Jarjes Murad Delly and Katrina Putros. He was baptized on 6 October 1927 by Father Francis Kattola. ==Episcopal life== Since his election as Patriarch in December 2003, Mar Emmanuel III Delly continued to work for the Chaldean Church. In Iraq, the Chaldean Church, which is the largest Christian group, consists of eight dioceses totaling 100 parishes and approximately 1,000,000 people. Additionally, there are another eight dioceses outside of Iraq, in countries including Iran, Turkey, Syria, Lebanon, Egypt, Europe, Australia, Canada and the U.S. It is estimated that the Chaldean population is over one and a half million devotees worldwide. He was well known for his respect and cooperation with leaders of other churches and faiths, mainly Muslims.Iraqi cardinal-to-be says he is symbol of national unity, uk.news.yahoo.com; accessed 7 February 2015. During his 42 years as a bishop, Delly's contributions to the Chaldean Church include building of many churches in and outside of Iraq. He supervised the Chaldean monasteries and convents, as well as several Chaldean religious journals and publications. On 17 October 2007, Pope Benedict XVI announced that he would make Delly a Cardinal. Delly was elevated to the College of Cardinals in the consistory at St. Peter's Basilica on November 24, 2007. Pope Benedict XVI said that by naming Delly a cardinal he was demonstrating his \\"spiritual closeness and [his] affection\\" for Iraqi Christians. On 19 December 2012, Delly resigned as patriarch of Chaldean Catholic Church and Pope Benedict named Archeparch Jacques Ishaq as administrator ad interim. At the same time Pope Benedict convoked a synod to be held to Rome of the Chaledean Church to choose Delly's successor as patriarch. Cardinal Delly did not participate in the 2013 conclave, having already reached age 80. ==Death== Cardinal Delly died on 8 April 2014, aged 86, in San Diego, California, where he had lived in retirement. Pope Francis offered his condolences. His funeral was held at St. Peter's Chaldean Catholic Cathedral in San Diego and at Mother of God Cathedral in Detroit. He is buried in Holy Sepulchre Catholic Cemetery in Detroit. This is the first time a Chaldean patriarch has been buried outside the homeland. ==Educational degrees== *Master's Degree in Philosophy, Pontifical Urbaniana University. * Pontifical Urbaniana University—Faculty of Philosophy—Program of Studies (accessed 13 November 2007) *Doctor of Sacred Theology, Pontifical Lateran University. *Doctor of Canon Law, Pontifical Lateran University. ==Languages== Mar Emmanuel III Delly spoke Chaldean Neo- Aramaic, Syriac, Arabic, French, Italian, Latin, and English fluently. ==References== ==External links== *2004 Interview *Catholic Hierarchy.org *GigaCatholic Website * Category:1927 births Category:2014 deaths Category:Iraqi Eastern Catholics Category:Chaldean Catholic Patriarchs of Babylon Category:People from Tel Keppe Category:Iraqi cardinals Category:Iraqi archbishops Category:Cardinals created by Pope Benedict XVI Category:Pontifical Urban University alumni Category:Pontifical Lateran University alumni Category:20th-century Eastern Catholic bishops Category:21st-century Eastern Catholic archbishops ","title":"Emmanuel III Delly"},{"id":"2549933","text":"Electronic membrane switches A membrane switch is an electrical switch for turning a circuit on and off. It differs from a mechanical switch, which is usually made of copper and plastic parts: a membrane switch is a circuit printed on Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) or Indium tin oxide (ITO). The ink used for screen printing is usually copper / silver / graphite filled and therefore conductive. Membrane switches are user-equipment interface utilities that allow for the communication of commands from users to electronic devices. Membrane switches can be thought of as one category of interface utilities alongside touch screens, plastic keyboards, toggle switches and many other kinds of control systems. Interface utilities can be as simple as tactile switches for controlling lighting, and they can be as complicated as membrane keyboards and switch panels for use with computers. ==Construction== The ASTM defines a membrane switch as \\"a momentary switch device in which at least one contact is on, or made of, a flexible substrate.\\" A membrane switch typically has 4 or more layers. The top layer of a membrane switch is the graphic interface between the user and the machine. Another critical layer is a printed circuit. This can also be a flex circuit made of copper and polyimide material. The layers are normally assembled using pressure-sensitive adhesives although inexpensive designs can be held together by other mechanical means such as a keyboard housing. Contact between two traces can be made through a printed shorting pad or through a metal dome that stands on legs. ===Backlighting=== There are three standard methods for back lighting membrane switches. The first option is using Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs) to back light. However, LEDs create bright spots and are not suitable for overall back lighting of a panel, but rather as indicator lights. LEDs can either be surface mounted to the circuit layer or be placed on a separate LED layer. A second option is optical fiber. In a typical design, two or more layers of woven fiber-optic cloth are used to form a rectangular light-emitting area. The fibers coming off one end are then bundled into a circular ferrule and coupled to one or more LED light sources. Remote light sources offer 10,000 to 100,000 hours of life. Optical fibers are not affected by extremes in humidity (0% to 100%) or temperature (-40 to + 85 deg C). The third standard option is to use electroluminescent (EL) lamps. They are lower priced compared to fiber optics and offer additional design flexibility. The color of light emitted from an EL lamp can vary depending on the phosphors that are used. Some common colors are blue/green and yellow/green, white, blue and orange. EL lamps have a half-life of approximately 3000–8000 hours depending upon the quality of the phosphor. Once they reach their half-life, the brightness starts to fade rapidly. EL lamps are thus not a good choice if the lamp is on for an extended period of time. Fading or flashing could double the life of the lamp. ==Applications== Classic applications of membrane switches include microwave oven panel, air conditioner control panel, TV remote control etc. Tactile feedback of keys can be provided by embossing the top PET layer or embedding metal snap domes, polyester domes or forming the graphic layer. The benefits of membrane switches include ease of cleaning, sealing ability and their low profile. Membrane switch can be used together with other control systems such as touch screens, keyboards, lighting, and they can also be complicated like the membrane keyboards and switch panels in mobiles and computers. They are reliable, effective, low-cost user interfaces, suitable for a wide range of products, and available with many creative options. Depending on industry and application, membrane switches are also referred to as membrane keyboards and membrane keypads. ==References== Category:Switches ","title":"Membrane switch"},{"id":"2549939","text":"Maple River may refer to: == Rivers == *Maple River (Iowa), a tributary of the Little Sioux River in the U.S. state of Iowa *Maple River (Michigan), any of three rivers in the U.S. state of Michigan **Maple River (Burt Lake) **Maple River (Grand River tributary) **Maple River (Muskegon River) *Maple River (Minnesota), a tributary of the Le Sueur River in the U.S. state of Minnesota *Maple River (North Dakota), a tributary of the Red River of the North in the U.S. state of North Dakota *Maple River (North Dakota–South Dakota), a tributary of the Elm River in the U.S. states of North Dakota and South Dakota == Places == * Maple River, Iowa, an unincorporated community * Maple River State Game Area, a wildlife area in the U.S. state of Michigan * Maple River Township (disambiguation) == See also == * Maple (disambiguation) ","title":"Maple River"},{"id":"2549945","text":"\\"Goodbye Iowa\\" is the 14th episode of season 4 of the television show Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Riley realizes that Walsh had tried to kill Buffy, and finds Walsh dead. He subsequently goes into withdrawal symptoms when he does not get fed the Initiative's drugs. Meanwhile Adam is on the loose, killing at random and seeking answers about himself and the world. ==Plot synopsis== Buffy fills the gang in on everything that's gone on since she started to work with the Initiative, and they question whether Riley was involved in the death mission on which Maggie sent Buffy. Buffy arms the group with weapons and makes plans to hide out in Xander's basement. Riley shows up at Giles' place asking Buffy for information, and becomes upset when he recognizes Spike as Hostile 17. Riley does not want to accept what the rest of them are saying about Professor Walsh and the Initiative. Leaving Dr. Walsh's body, Adam escapes the Initiative through a vent. He approaches a young boy playing in the park and questions him about his nature. Dr. Angleman slips in a pool of blood as he enters room 314 and finds Professor Walsh stabbed to death. When Riley and Forrest see Walsh's body, Forrest accuses Buffy of staking Maggie. Giles is grumpy when he wakes up in Xander's basement the next morning. The girls are watching cartoons when a news story comes on about a young boy who has been killed via skewering and mutilated. Believing it to be the Polgara demon captured in the previous episode, Buffy goes after it. Riley - against Dr. Angleman's orders - also instructs the commandos to search for the Polgara demon; he and Buffy both end up at the park where the boy was killed. While Buffy tries to apologize to Riley, Riley informs her that Walsh is dead and asks if Buffy is happy about that. Willow goes to Tara's dorm room, planning to find the Polgara using a spell that shows nearby demonic activity. However, Tara secretly sabotages the spell and it fails. Buffy searches for information at Willy's but Riley also shows up, very angry. He is shaking and sweating and scratching his hand so badly that it bleeds, as he questions Buffy's intentions and pulls a gun on an innocent woman. Buffy consoles Riley as she sees that he is sick and only getting sicker, leaving him at Xander's to rest. When Riley wakes up, Willow tries to stop him from going after Buffy but he pushes her to the ground and runs. Disguised as a scientist, Buffy gets herself and Xander - dressed in fatigues - into the Initiative. They overhear Dr. Angleman talking to another scientist about their commandos having withdrawals from the drugs they had been secretly putting in their meals. Meanwhile at Willy's bar, Spike is badly beaten by demons for associating with the Slayer. They tell him if he is seen around again, they will kill him. Buffy grabs Dr. Angleman, demanding information about 314. Riley arrives to help Buffy, still unwilling to accept Professor Walsh's sinister motives. Adam drops a dead body to the floor, revealing his presence. Adam is searching for answers about the world, and has returned to the Initiative so he can discover more about himself and who he is. He has a disk drive in his chest and when he inserts a disk labelled \\"Adam,\\" he offers information which reveals that he is part human, demon and machine. He explains that even though Riley had a real mother, Maggie was also his mother as she shaped and built him into a human machine for the Initiative. According to Adam, this makes him and Riley brothers, but Riley is again provoked into anger. Soon a fight breaks out, during which Adam kills Dr. Angleman, injures Riley and proves a match for Buffy before escaping again. The other commandos enter and take Riley away. The next day, Buffy talks to Willow about how Adam is out there and very dangerous. At the hospital, Riley lies in bed holding a scarf Buffy gave him earlier. ==Themes== In Televised Morality, Gregory Stevenson argues that this episode pays homage to Mary Shelley's Frankenstein and its warning about the dangers of scientific progress without adequate ethical safeguards. For example, like Frankenstein's monster, Adam approaches a boy in the woods. The boy is playing with a cyborg soldier action figure in the park, shortly before Adam - a genuine cyborg - kills him. The monster in Shelley's novel identifies with the character Adam from Milton's Paradise Lost. In the scene that follows, Anya, Willow, and Buffy are watching Roadrunner cartoons in Xander's basement. As Wile E. Coyote's Acme technology once again backfires, Buffy complains, \\"That would never happen.\\" Stevenson claims the irony is it does later happen: the Initiative's embrace of technology unfettered by moral guidance ultimately causes its own destruction. ==References* \\"Goodbye Iowa\\" at BuffyGuide.com Category:Buffy the Vampire Slayer (season 4) episodes Category:2000 American television episodes ","title":"Goodbye Iowa"},{"id":"2549971","text":"Straight leg carriers. The setup shows the drive plate, workpiece and carrier setup between centers on lathe Bent tail lathe dog hooked on chuck jaw. A lathe dog, also known as a lathe carrier, is a device that clamps around the workpiece and allows the rotary motion of the machine's spindle to be transmitted to the workpiece. A carrier is most often used when turning between centers on a lathe, but it may be used on dividing heads or any similar situation. It is used in conjunction with a drive plate and drive pins: the plate is mounted directly on the machine spindle (as with a chuck) and the drive pin is attached to the plate. In use the carrier and workpiece are inserted between centers and the leg of the carrier rests against the drive pin. Carriers may be of the straight leg or bent leg type. The straight leg requires the drive pin, the bent leg fits into a slot machined into the drive plate. The bent leg type is considered safer as there are (slightly) fewer protruding parts to cause accidents. Spindle speeds are reduced when working with carriers, due to the unbalanced nature of the setup.

It is derived from various European and African influences, including English ballads, Irish and Scottish traditional music (especially fiddle music), hymns, and African-American blues. First recorded in the 1920s, Appalachian musicians were a key influence on the early development of Old- time music, country music, and bluegrass, and were an important part of the American folk music revival of the 1960s. Instruments typically used to perform Appalachian music include the banjo, American fiddle, fretted dulcimer, and guitar.Ted Olson, \\"Music ,\\" Encyclopedia of Appalachia, 2006.

Early recorded Appalachian musicians include Fiddlin' John Carson, G. B. Grayson & Henry Whitter, Bascom Lamar Lunsford, the Carter Family, Clarence Ashley, and Dock Boggs, all of whom were initially recorded in the 1920s and 1930s. Several Appalachian musicians obtained renown during the folk revival of the 1950s and 1960s, including Jean Ritchie, Roscoe Holcomb, Ola Belle Reed, Lily May Ledford, Hedy West and Doc Watson. Country and bluegrass artists such as Loretta Lynn, Roy Acuff, Dolly Parton, Earl Scruggs, Chet Atkins, The Stanley Brothers and Don Reno were heavily influenced by traditional Appalachian music. ==History== Appalachian dulcimer Immigrants from England, the Scottish lowlands, and Ulster arrived in Appalachia in the 17th and 18th centuries, and brought with them the musical traditions of these regions, consisting primarily of English and Scottish ballads-- which were essentially unaccompanied narratives-- and dance music, such as reels, which were accompanied by a fiddle. Many Appalachian ballads, such as \\"Pretty Saro\\", \\"The Cuckoo\\", \\"Pretty Polly\\", and \\"Matty Groves\\", descend from the English ballad tradition and have known antecedents there. Other songs popular in Appalachia, such as \\"Young Hunting,\\" \\"Lord Randal,\\" and \\"Barbara Allen\\", have lowland Scottish roots.Cecelia Conway, \\"Celtic Influences\\". Encyclopedia of Appalachia (Knoxville, Tenn.: University of Tennessee, 2006), p. 1132. The dance tune \\"Cumberland Gap\\" may be derived from the tune that accompanies the Scottish ballad \\"Bonnie George Campbell\\".Song notes in Bascom Lamar Lunsford: Ballads, Banjo Tunes, and Sacred Songs of Western North Carolina [CD liner notes]. Smithsonian Folkways, 1996. Several fiddle tunes popular in Appalachia have origins in Gaelic-speaking regions such as western Ireland and the Scottish Highlands--for example \\"Leather Britches,\\" based on \\"Lord MacDonald's Reel.\\" Printed versions of these were very popular and common throughout the British Empire in the eighteenth century, including North America, and would likely have spread into Appalachia as a result. This explains the presence of these tunes in a region which had relatively little Gaelic-speaking settlement. The early immigrants also brought a form of church singing called lining out, in which one person sings a line of a psalm or hymn and the rest of the congregation responds. This type of congregational singing, once very common all over colonial America, is now largely restricted to Old Regular Baptist churches in the hills of southwest Virginia and eastern Kentucky. These congregations usually sing American or English hymns. The British music changed gradually after generations of American settlement. Songs were transformed lyrically as the descendants of the settlers forgot the people and events that originally inspired them, though some maintained references to British place names. Additionally, influences from the music of other settlers, including Germans, Dutch, French Huguenots, and in particular African Americans would have ensured that the new music developed a sound all its own. The so-called \\"Murder Banjo\\" The \\"New World\\" ballad tradition, consisting of ballads written in North America, was as influential as the Old World tradition to the development of Appalachian music. New World ballads were typically written to reflect news events of the day, and were often published as broadsides. New World ballads popular among Appalachian musicians included \\"Omie Wise\\", \\"Wreck of the Old 97\\", \\"Man of Constant Sorrow,\\" and \\"John Hardy\\". Later, coal mining and its associated labor issues led to the development of protest songs, such as \\"Which Side Are You On?\\" and \\"Coal Creek March\\".Stephen Mooney, \\"Coal-Mining and Protest Music\\". Encyclopedia of Appalachia (Knoxville, Tenn.: University of Tennessee Press, 2006), pp. 1136–1137. One of the most iconic symbols of Appalachian culture-- the banjo-- was brought to the region by African-American slaves in the 18th century. Black banjo players were performing in Appalachia as early as 1798, when their presence was documented in Knoxville, Tennessee.Cecelia Conway, \\"Appalachian Echoes of the African Banjo\\". Appalachians and Race: The Mountain South from Slavery to Segregation (Lexington, Kentucky: University Press of Kentucky, 2001), pp. 27–32. African-American blues, which spread through the region in the early 20th century, brought harmonic (such as the third and seventh blue notes, and sliding tones) and verbal dexterity to Appalachian music, and many early Appalachian musicians, such as Dock Boggs and Hobart Smith, recalled being greatly influenced by watching black musicians perform.Barry O'Connell, \\"Down a Lonesome Road: Dock Boggs' Life in Music.\\" Extended version of essay in Dock Boggs: His Folkways Recordings, 1963–1968 [CD liner notes], 1998.Stephen Wade, Notes in Hobart Smith: In Sacred Trust -- The 1963 Fleming Brown Tapes [CD liner notes], 2004. Other instruments such as the guitar, mandolin, and autoharp became popular in Appalachia in the late 19th century as a result of mail order catalogs. These instruments were added to the banjo- and-fiddle outfits to form early string bands. The fretted dulcimer-- often called the \\"Appalachian\\" or \\"mountain\\" dulcimer due to its popularity in the region-- emerged in Southwest Pennsylvania and Northwest Virginia in the 19th century. It is thought to have been a modification of a German instrument. Unrelated to the hammered dulcimer, the fretted dulcimer is essentially a modified zither. In the early 20th century, settlement schools in Kentucky taught the fretted dulcimer to students, helping spread its popularity in the region. Singer Jean Ritchie was largely responsible for popularizing the instrument among folk music enthusiasts in the 1950s.Lucy Long, \\"Fretted Dulcimer\\". Encyclopedia of Appalachia (Knoxville, Tenn.: University of Tennessee Press, 2006), pp. 1144–1145. ==Collecting and recording== ===Fieldwork=== Around the turn of the 20th century, a broad movement developed to record the rich musical heritage, particularly of folksong, that had been preserved and developed by the people of the Appalachians. This music was unwritten; songs were handed down, often within families, from generation to generation by oral transmission. Fieldwork to record Appalachian music (first in musical notation, later on with recording equipment) was undertaken by a variety of scholars. One of the earliest collectors of Appalachian ballads was Kentucky native John Jacob Niles (1892-1980), who began noting ballads as early as 1907 as he learned them in the course of family, social life, and work. Due to fears of plagiarism and imitation of other collectors active in the region at the time, Niles waited until 1960 to publish his first 110 in The Ballad Book of John Jacob Niles. The area covered by Niles in his collecting days, according to the map in the Ballad Book, was bounded roughly by Tazewell, Virginia; south to Boone and Saluda, North Carolina and Greenville, South Carolina; west to Chickamauga, Georgia; north through Chattanooga and Dayton, Tennessee to Somerset, Kentucky; northwest to Bardstown, Frankfort, and Lexington, Kentucky; east to the West Virginia border, and back down to Tazewell, thus covering areas of the Smokies, the Cumberland Plateau, Upper Tennessee Valley, and the Lookout Mountain region.John Jacob Niles, The Ballad Book of John Jacob Niles. Boston, New York: Houghton Mifflin Company, 1960. Reprinted by Dover, 1970. In May 1916, the soprano Loraine Wyman and her pianist colleague Howard Brockway visited the Appalachians in eastern Kentucky, in a 300-mile walking trek to gather folk songs. They took their harvest back to New York, where they continued, with great success, their ongoing efforts in performing traditional folk songs to urban audiences. Map showing various locations in Central and Southern Appalachia where British folklorist Cecil Sharp collected \\"old world\\" ballads, 1916–1918 Starting only about a month after Wyman and Brockway, the British folklorists Cecil Sharp and Maud Karpeles toured the Southern Appalachian region, visiting places like Hot Springs in North Carolina, Flag Pond in Tennessee, Harlan in Kentucky, and Greenbrier County in West Virginia, as well as schools such as Berea College and the Hindman Settlement School in Kentucky and the Pi Beta Phi settlement school in Gatlinburg, Tennessee. They persisted for three summers in all (1916-1918), collecting over 200 \\"Old World\\" ballads in the region, many of which had varied only slightly from their British Isles counterparts. After their first study in Appalachia, Sharp and Karpeles published English Folk Songs from the Southern Appalachians.Filene, Benjamin, Romancing the Folk: Public Memory & American Roots Music, University of North Carolina Press, 2000. Among the ballads Sharp and Karpeles found in Appalachia were medieval-themed songs such as \\"The Elfin Knight\\" and \\"Lord Thomas and Fair Ellinor\\", and seafaring and adventure songs such as \\"In Seaport Town\\" and \\"Young Beichan\\". They transcribed 16 versions of \\"Barbara Allen\\" and 22 versions of \\"The Daemon Lover\\" (often called \\"House Carpenter\\" in Appalachia).Cecil Sharp, Maud Karpeles (ed.), English Folk Songs from the Southern Appalachians (London: Oxford University Press, 1932), pp. 26, 77, 115, 183, 244, 310, etc. The work of Sharp and Karpeles confirmed what many folklorists had suspected-- the remote valleys and hollows of the Appalachian Mountains were a vast repository of older forms of music.Ted Olson and Ajay Kalra, \\"Appalachian Music: Examining Popular Assumptions\\". A Handbook to Appalachia: An Introduction to the Region (Knoxville, Tenn.: University of Tennessee Press, 2006), pp. 163–170. ===Commercial recordings=== Only a few years after folk music fieldwork had begun to flourish, the commercial recording industry had developed to the point that recording Appalachian music for popular consumption had become a viable enterprise.Williams, Michelle Ann (1995) Great Smoky Mountains Folk Life. Jackson: University Press of Mississippi, p. 58 In 1923, OKeh Records talent scout Ralph Peer held the first recording sessions for Appalachian regional musicians in Atlanta, Georgia. Musicians recorded at these sessions included Fiddlin' John Carson, a champion fiddle player from North Georgia. The commercial success of the Atlanta sessions prompted OKeh to seek out other musicians from the region, including Henry Whitter, who was recorded in New York City in 1924. The following year, Peer recorded a North Carolina string band fronted by Al Hopkins that called themselves \\"a bunch of hillbillies.\\" Peer applied the name to the band, and the success of the band's recordings led to the term \\"Hillbilly music\\" being applied to Appalachian string band music. In 1927, Peer, then working for the Victor Talking Machine Company, held a series of recording sessions at Bristol, Tennessee that to many music historians mark the beginning of commercial country music. Musicians recorded at Bristol included the Carter Family and Jimmie Rodgers. Other record companies, such as Columbia Records and ARC, followed Peer's lead and held similar recording sessions. Many early Appalachian musicians, including Clarence Ashley and Dock Boggs, experienced a moderate level of success. The onset of the Great Depression in the early 1930s, however, reduced demand for recorded music, and most of these musicians fell back into obscurity. ===Folk revival=== In the 1930s, radio programs such as the Grand Ole Opry kept interest in Appalachian music alive, and collectors such as musicologist Alan Lomax continued to make field recordings in the region throughout the 1940s. In 1952, Folkways Records released the landmark Anthology of American Folk Music, which had been compiled by ethnomusicologist Harry Smith, and contained tracks from Appalachian musicians such as Clarence Ashley, Dock Boggs, and G. B. Grayson. The compilation helped inspire the folk music revival of the 1950s and 1960s. Urban folk enthusiasts such as New Lost City Ramblers bandmates Mike Seeger and John Cohen and producer Ralph Rinzler traveled to remote sections of Appalachia to conduct field recordings. Along with recording and re-recordings of older Appalachian musicians and the discovery of newer musicians, the folk revivalists conducted extensive interviews with these musicians to determine their musical backgrounds and the roots of their styles and repertoires.Jeff Place, Notes to Classic Mountain Songs from Smithsonian Folkways [CD liner notes], 2002. Appalachian musicians became regulars at folk music festivals from the Newport Folk Festival to folk festivals at the University of Chicago and the University of California at Berkeley. Films such as Cohen's High Lonesome Sound-- the subject of which was Kentucky banjoist and ballad singer Roscoe Holcomb-- helped give enthusiasts a sense of what it was like to see Appalachian musicians perform. ===Coal mining and protest music=== Large-scale coal mining arrived in Appalachia in the late 19th century, and brought drastic changes in the lives of those who chose to leave their small farms for wage-paying jobs in coal mining towns. The old ballad tradition that had existed in Appalachia since the arrival of Europeans in the region was readily applied to the social problems common in late 19th-century and early 20th- century mining towns-- low pay, mine disasters, and strikes. One of the earliest mining-related songs from Appalachia was \\"Coal Creek March,\\" which was influenced by the 1891 Coal Creek War in Anderson County, Tennessee. Mine labor strife in West Virginia in 1914 and the 1931 Harlan County War in Kentucky produced songs such as Ralph Chaplin's \\"Solidarity Forever\\" and Florence Reece's \\"Which Side Are You On?\\" respectively. George Korson made field recordings of miners' songs in 1940 for The Library of Congress.\\"Songs and Ballads of the Bituminous Miners,\\" Music Division Recording Laboratory, AFS L60. The most commercially successful Appalachian mining song is Merle Travis' \\"Sixteen Tons,\\" which has been recorded by Tennessee Ernie Ford, Johnny Cash, and dozens of other artists.Archie Green, Only a Miner: Studies in Recorded Coal-Mining Songs (Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1972), pp. 279–327. Other notable coal mining songs include Jean Ritchie's \\"The L&N; Don't Stop Here Anymore,\\" Sarah Ogan Gunning's \\"Come All You Coal Miners,\\" and Hazel Dickens' \\"Clay County Miner.\\"Stephen Mooney, \\"Coal Mining and Protest Music\\". Encyclopedia of Appalachia (Knoxville, Tenn.: University of Tennessee Press, 2006), pp. 1136–1137. Both classic renditions and contemporary covers are included in Jack Wright's 2007 compilation album, Music of Coal. ==Influence== Street musicians in Maynardville, Tennessee, photographed by Ben Shahn in 1935 The Bristol sessions of 1927 have been called the \\"Big Bang of Country Music,\\" as some music historians have considered them the beginning of the modern country music genre. The popularity of such musicians as the Carter Family, who first recorded at the sessions, proved to industry executives that there was a market for \\"mountain\\" or \\"hillbilly\\" music. Other influential 1920s-era location recording sessions in Appalachia were the Johnson City sessions and the Knoxville sessions. Early recorded country music (i.e., late 1920s and early 1930s) typically consisted of fiddle and banjo players and a predominant string band format, reflecting its Appalachian roots. Due in large part to the success of the Grand Ole Opry, the center of country music had shifted to Nashville by 1940. In subsequent decades, as the country music industry tried to move into the mainstream, musicians and industry executives sought to deemphasize the genre's Appalachian connections, most notably by dropping the term \\"hillbilly music\\" in favor of \\"country.\\" In the late 1980s, artists such as Dolly Parton, Ricky Skaggs, and Dwight Yoakam helped to bring traditional Appalachian influences back to country music. Bluegrass developed in the 1940s from a mixture of several types of music, including old-time, country, and blues. The music's creation is often credited to Bill Monroe and his band, the Blue Grass Boys. One of the defining characteristics of bluegrass--the fast-paced three-finger banjo picking style--was developed by Monroe's banjo player, North Carolina native Earl Scruggs. Later, as a member of Flatt and Scruggs and the Foggy Mountain Boys, Scruggs wrote Foggy Mountain Breakdown, one of the most well-known bluegrass instrumentals. Bluegrass quickly grew in popularity among numerous musicians in Appalachia, including the Stanley Brothers, the Osborne Brothers, and Jimmy Martin, and although it was influenced by various music forms from inside and outside the region (Monroe himself was from Western Kentucky), it is often associated with Appalachia and performed alongside old-time and traditional music at Appalachian folk festivals. Appalachian music has also influenced a number of musicians from outside the region. In 1957, British skiffle artist Lonnie Donegan reached the top of the U.K. charts with his version of the Appalachian folk song \\"Cumberland Gap,\\" and the following year the Kingston Trio had a number one hit on the U.S. charts with their rendition of the North Carolina ballad, \\"Tom Dooley\\". Grateful Dead member Jerry Garcia frequently performed Appalachian songs such as \\"Shady Grove\\" and \\"Wind and Rain\\", and claimed to have learned the clawhammer banjo style from \\"listening to Clarence Ashley\\".Joe Wilson, \\"Tom Ashley.\\" In Greenback Dollar: The Music of Clarence \\"Tom\\" Ashley [CD liner notes]. County Records, 2001. Bob Dylan, who also performed a number of Appalachian folk songs, considered Roscoe Holcomb to be \\"one of the best,\\" and guitarist Eric Clapton considered Holcomb a \\"favorite\\" country musician.Smithsonian Folkways, An Untamed Sense of Control -- Recording Details. Retrieved: 12 March 2009. Classical composers Lamar Stringfield and Kurt Weill have used Appalachian folk music in their compositions, and the region was the setting for Aaron Copland's Appalachian Spring. In the early 21st century, the motion picture O Brother, Where Art Thou?, and to a lesser extent Songcatcher and Cold Mountain, generated renewed mainstream interest in traditional Appalachian music. ==Festivals== Every year, numerous festivals are held through the Appalachian region, and throughout the world, to celebrate Appalachian music and related forms of music. One of the oldest is the Ole Time Fiddler's and Bluegrass Festival (known as \\"Fiddler's Grove\\") in Union Grove, North Carolina, which has been held continuously since 1924.U.S. Library of Congress, Local Legacies -- Old Time Fiddler's and Bluegrass Festival. Retrieved: 12 March 2009. It is held each year on Memorial Day weekend. In 1928, Appalachian musician and collector Bascom Lamar Lunsford, a native banjo player and fiddler of the North Carolina mountains, organized the Mountain Dance and Folk Festival, which is held annually in Asheville, North Carolina on the first weekend in August. Every September, Bristol hosts the old-time music festival, Rhythm & Roots Reunion. The American Folk Music Festival, established by Jean Bell Thomas in 1930, was held almost annually in Ashland, Kentucky and at various Kentucky state parks until 1972. For five days during the first week of August each year, the Appalachian String Band Music Festival is held in Clifftop, West Virginia. This festival is dedicated to the preservation of authentic old-time string band music as well as traditional flatfoot dancing and square dancing. It features competition, performances, and workshops. Another popular festival for traditional old-time music, flatfoot dancing, as well as bluegrass music is the Tennessee Valley Old Time Fiddlers Convention, held annually the first weekend of October in Athens, Alabama. In Mount Airy, North Carolina, the Mount Airy Fiddlers Convention is held on the first weekend of June each year. The Bluff Mountain Festival is held in Hot Springs, North Carolina every year in June on the second Saturday following the first Friday. It features old- time, bluegrass, and traditional ballad music performances, as well as team clogging and individual flatfoot dancing. Other annual festivals include Mountain Heritage Day at Western Carolina University in Cullowhee, North Carolina and the Celebration of Traditional Music at Berea College, both of which were first held in the 1970s.Mountain Heritage Day.

It is a part of the county of Cornwall, bordered by St. James in the east and Westmoreland in the south. With the exception of Kingston, it is the smallest parish on the island. Hanover is the birth parish of Alexander Bustamante, labour leader, first head of government of Jamaica under universal suffrage, and one of seven Jamaican National Heroes. Its capital is Lucea. ==History== The region was initially under Spanish control as a colony until 1655, when Spain relinquished control to the English. Over time, parishes were formed to govern the island. The parish would go unnamed for many decades even though many of the towns existed. Hanover was established on 12 November 1723. It is the smallest parish in Jamaica and was established from parts of Westmoreland and St James parishes. It was named in honor of the British monarch, George I, who was a member of the German House of Hanover. There had been a governmental proposal to name parish St. Sophia, after the King’s mother; however, the assembly did not approve the proposal. The parish's capital town, on the other hand, has name variations: St Lusia, St. Lucia, St. Lucea and, today, Lucea. In the early colonial days, Lucea, the main town and port, was even busier than Montego Bay. By the mid-18th century, Lucea was the hub of an important sugar-growing region, and the town was prosperous as a sugar port and market centre. European Jews settled in the parish as merchants, store keepers, haberdashery, shoe makers and goldsmiths. It became a free port. After the abolition of slavery in 1834, the free people prospered, developing a variety of crops, and supplying produce to much of the rest of Jamaica. The harbor was used to export bananas until after the 1960s. A deep-water pier was built, but this has been restricted to the shipping of molasses, an important sugar product. The port was closed in 1983. The historic Fort Charlotte stands at one side of the entrance to the harbour, but was never garrisoned. ==Geography and demography== Hanover covers an area of 450 km2. The capital town, Lucea, is located at latitude 18°25'N, longitude 78°08'W. The highest point in the parish is the Dolphin's Head, which serves as a landmark for ships at sea. The parish has a mountainous terrain; it features three small waterfalls, several coves along its coastline, such as the Davis Cove—named after a prominent Hanover family—along its coast, and large caves. A clock tower was installed in the centre of Lucea in 1817; it still stands, and is still fully functional. The parish had an estimated 67,176 inhabitants in 1999, 5,739 of which lived in Lucea. The large majority of the population is black (92.1%), with 0.8% whites, 3.7% Asians, 2.3% Latinos, and 2.1% identifying as other. The Great River is the officially recorded river in Hanover. Its valley has been an important agricultural region. Other notable towns include Sandy Bay, Dias, Green Island, Hopewell and Cascade. ==Commerce== ===Agriculture=== Hanover is known for the production of yams, sugar cane, ginger, rice, pimento, turmeric, breadfruit and arrowroot. It is also celebrated for its fine breeds of cattle, and pigs and goats are raised. ===Sights=== Although Hanover is not one of Jamaica's major tourist areas, a tourist resort is situated in the village of Hopewell about east of Lucea. This area has several large hotels, including Round Hill and Tryall (noted for its golf course). There is also the Grand Palladium resort and spa in western Hanover and on the northern part of the Negril strip (which falls within Hanover not Westmoreland)UK Directorate of Overseas Surveys 1:50,000 map of Jamaica sheet A, 1959 are the Grand Lido, Couples, Riu, Sandals, Negril cabins and beaches.North Negril on Wikimapia Lucea Parish Church - The main structure of the Lucea Parish Church building dates back to the 18th century. It was built prior to 1725, but records at least establish it in 1725 with oldest baptism recorded. It is the oldest building in the parish of Hanover. It is said that a tunnel leads from underneath the church to nearby Fort Charlotte, which is approximately 400 m away. Fort Charlotte - Commanding the entrance to Lucea Harbor is the well-kept 18th-century Fort Charlotte, constructed in 1745 and renamed in 1778 to honor George III’s Queen Charlotte. (Prior to that year, it was listed as Lucea Fort.) It was erected in defense of the harbor, and stands on a peninsula overlooking the sea channel. The War Office in Britain transferred the barracks and Fort Charlotte in 1862, as a gift to the Executive Committee of Jamaica. ==Plantations== * Axe and AzdeAxe and Azde Legacies of British Slave-ownership, UCL.

Hanania describes his writing as \\"defining the moderate Palestinian and Arab Voice.\\" He continues to write a Chicago political column carried locally with the Southwest News Newspaper Group (including the Southwest News-Herald, Des Plaines Valley News, The Regional News and The Reporter newspapers), and formerly wrote a weekly column with the Arlington Heights Daily Herald (2002–2009). He has written a humor/serious column for the online website of Yedioth Ahronoth and also for the Jerusalem Post, and currently publishes his columns on his personal website at TheDailyHookah.com. Earlier in his career, Hanania wrote a weekly syndicated column for the Jerusalem Post and his columns advocated the \\"moderate Palestinian and Arab voice\\" and rejected extremism, embraces peace between Palestinians and Israelis, and opposed the use of violence. However, in a November 2012 column for the Saudi Gazette, he wrote \\"the real obstacle preventing peace is the fundamental refusal of most Israelis and most American Jews to accept the right of Palestinians to exist as a people with a state.\\" Hanania also said that \\"until Israelis and Jews accept the right of Palestinians to exist, Palestinians have no option but to struggle and resist and defend themselves against violence, land confiscation and theft, and ethnic cleansing from historical Palestine. However, Hanania has committed himself to non-violence, embraces peaceful negotiations and maintains consistently on his web site that \\"The best way to fight extremism in the Middle East and bring peace to Israelis and Palestinians is through truth and facts. In my columns, you will read my opinions which provide a balanced view of the conflict, to let you understand the facts and the issues. I don't just criticize Israel. I also criticize the Arabs. I don't just point a finger at Israel and blame them for everything, I also point out the faults of the Arabs, too.\\" Hanania describes himself as the Baby Boomer Blogger and editor of Arab American TV Online. Hanania launched a standup comedy career in 2001 to advance his belief that humor can calm the animosity between Jews and Arabs, promoting peace through moderation. He was featured in a front-page story in The Wall Street Journal and other newspapers. In May 2002, the owner of Zanies Comedy Club in Chicago invited Hanania to perform comedy and enrolled him in comedy classes to hone his stage skills. He performed 35 shows for Zanies. In June, Zanies booked Hanania for a nine-show performance over Labor Day weekend. A few weeks before the show, Zanies owner informed Hanania they were going to add Jewish American comedian Jackie Mason to the bill so he could get stage time before his planned appearances on Broadway. But hours before the first show, Mason refused to have Hanania open for him. Hanania was called at home as he was leaving for the theater and told not to show up, even though the show had been pre-sold (sold out) a month before. Mason's manager and wife, Jyll Rosenfeld, who was in New York at the time, said that Hanania could not perform because he was \\"Palestinian\\" and not Jordanian as Mason had thought. After the controversy broke making international headlines (that lasted seven days), Zanies' management claimed the cancellation was because of Hanania's alleged \\"inexperience\\" as a professional comedian, even though Hanania had performed 35 shows for Zanies. But Jyll Rosenfeld told a reporter for the Associated Press that Mason was \\"uncomfortable\\" being on the same stage with Hanania because Hanania is a \\"Palestinian.\\" Hanania later developed a unique Palestinian-Jewish stand-up comedy routine that features his experiences growing up Arab in America and satirizing his marriage to his wife, Alison, who is Jewish. With Israeli comedians Charley Warady and Yisrael Campbell, and African American comedian-journalist Aaron Freeman, he co-founded \\"The Israeli-Palestinian Comedy Tour\\", which broke the Arab and Palestinian comedian taboo of refusing to appear with Israelis. Hanania was the national coordinator of the former National American Arab Journalists Association, which coordinates and networks American Arab and Muslim Journalists in the United States, and is a partner affiliate of the Union of Arab American Journalists in Detroit. Hanania is a senior writer at The Arab Daily News online newspaper, which is self-described as \\"The Newspaper of Record for the American Arab community\\". == Professional awards == * Sigma Delta Chi National Award for Column Writing from the Society of Professional Journalists (2009) for his columns on the alleged discrimination against an Arab grocer in a suburb of Chicago. * MT.

LUN Masking is a level of security that makes a LUN available to only selected hosts and unavailable to all others. This kind of security is done on the SAN level and is based on the host HBA, i.e. you can give access of specific LUN on the SAN to specific host with specific HBA. LUN masking is mainly implemented at the host bus adapter (HBA) level. The security benefits of LUN masking implemented at HBAs are limited, since with many HBAs it is possible to forge source addresses (WWNs/MACs/IPs) and compromise the access. Many storage controllers also support LUN masking. When LUN masking is implemented at the storage controller level, the controller itself enforces the access policies to the device and as a result it is more secure. However, it is mainly implemented not as a security measure per se, but rather as a protection against misbehaving servers which may corrupt disks belonging to other servers. For example, Windows servers attached to a SAN will, under some conditions, corrupt non-Windows (Unix, Linux, NetWare) volumes on the SAN by attempting to write Windows volume labels to them. By hiding the other LUNs from the Windows server, this can be prevented, since the Windows server does not even realize the other LUNs exist. ==See also== * Persistent binding ==External links== * LUN Masking * LUN Masking and Zoning Category:Computer storage buses ","title":"Logical Unit Number masking"},{"id":"2550071","text":"A virtual tape library (VTL) is a data storage virtualization technology used typically for backup and recovery purposes. A VTL presents a storage component (usually hard disk storage) as tape libraries or tape drives for use with existing backup software. Virtualizing the disk storage as tape allows integration of VTLs with existing backup software and existing backup and recovery processes and policies. The benefits of such virtualization include storage consolidation and faster data restore processes. For most mainframe data centers, the storage capacity varies, however protecting its business and mission critical data is always vital. Most current VTL solutions use SAS or SATA disk arrays as the primary storage component due to their relatively low cost. The use of array enclosures increases the scalability of the solution by allowing the addition of more disk drives and enclosures to increase the storage capacity. The shift to VTL also eliminates streaming problems that often impair efficiency in tape drives as disk technology does not rely on streaming and can write effectively regardless of data transfer speeds. By backing up data to disks instead of tapes, VTL often increases performance of both backup and recovery operations. Restore processes are found to be faster than backup regardless of implementations. In some cases, the data stored on the VTL's disk array is exported to other media, such as physical tapes, for disaster recovery purposes (scheme called disk-to-disk-to-tape, or D2D2T). Alternatively, most contemporary backup software products introduced also direct usage of the file system storage (especially network-attached storage, accessed through NFS and CIFS protocols over IP networks) not requiring a tape library emulation at all. They also often offer a disk staging feature: moving the data from disk to a physical tape for a long-term storage. While a virtual tape library is very fast, the disk storage within is not designed to be removable, and does not usually involve physically removable external disk drives to be used for data archiving in place of tape. Since the disk storage is always connected to power and data sources and is never physically electrically isolated, it is vulnerable to potential damage and corruption due to nearby building or power grid lightning strikes. ==History== The first VTL solution was introduced by Cybernetics in 1992 under the name HSTC (high speed tape cache). Later, IBM released a Virtual Tape Server (VTS) introduced in 1997. It was targeted for a mainframe market, where many legacy applications tend to use a lot of very short tape volumes. It used the ESCON interface, and acted as a disk cache for the IBM 3494 tape library. A competitive offering from StorageTek (acquired in 2005 by Sun Microsystems, then subsequently by Oracle Corporation) was known as Virtual Storage Manager (VSM) which leveraged the market dominant STK Powderhorn library as a back store. Each product line has been enhanced to support larger disk buffer capacities, FICON, and more recently (c. 2010) \\"tapeless\\" disk-only environments. Other offerings in the mainframe space are also \\"tapeless\\". DLm has been developed by EMC Corporation, while Luminex has gained popularity and wide acceptance by teaming with Data Domain to provide the benefits of data deduplication behind its Channel Gateway platform. With the consequent reduction in off-site replication bandwidth afforded by deduplication, it is possible and practical for this form of virtual tape to reduce recovery point objective time and recovery time objective to near zero (or instantaneous). Outside of the mainframe environment, tape drives and libraries mostly featured SCSI. Likewise, VTLs were developed supporting popular SCSI transport protocols such as SPI (legacy systems), Fibre Channel, and iSCSI. The FalconStor VTL is the foundation of nearly half of the products sold in the VTL market, according to an Enterprise Strategy Group analyst. In mid-2010s VTLs got a rebirth thanks to hi-capacity \\"archive\\" drives from Seagate and HGST and more popular \\"tape in cloud\\" and Disk-to-Disk-to-Tape (often in cloud) scenarios. == See also == *Backup *Tape library * Tape Management System *Disk staging for an alternative approach *Emulation *Storage virtualization *Seven tiers of disaster recovery ==References== Category:Tape-based computer storage Category:Backup ","title":"Virtual tape library"},{"id":"2550090","text":"\\"This Year's Girl\\" is the 15th episode of season 4 of the television show Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Written by Doug Petrie and directed by Michael Gershman, it originally aired on February 22, 2000 on the WB network. In this episode, Eliza Dushku returns as Faith. While Buffy and the Scooby Gang (now with Riley on board) try to find Adam, Faith wakes up from a coma and finds the Mayor has left her a device which she uses to switch bodies with Buffy. Members of the Watchers' Council arrive in Sunnydale, alerted to Faith's waking. ==Plot== In a dream, Buffy and Faith make a bed, until Faith's blood begins to drip onto the clean white sheets. Buffy twists the knife in Faith's stomach. Xander is investigating the Blaster gun from The Initiative, but lacks the knowledge to fix it. Giles is concerned about Buffy, who has been patrolling non-stop for days without finding Adam. On patrol, she finds Adam has strung up a demon on a tree, opened up like a dissection experiment. When Riley wakes up in the military hospital, he attempts to leave but Forrest and Graham try to talk him out of it. Buffy explains her plans for breaking Riley out, but it proves unnecessary as he has escaped and is waiting in Xander's basement. At the hospital, Faith, still in a coma, is dreaming she is having a picnic with the Mayor. The dream becomes a nightmare when Buffy arrives, slits the Mayor's throat, then chases Faith into an open grave. As Faith climbs out of the grave in her dream, she awakens from her coma. Pulling free of the tubes in her body, Faith walks out into the hospital halls and encounters a girl. She thinks it's still Graduation Day, but the girl informs her of the date and that the Mayor died at the graduation ceremony. Faith leaves the hospital in the girl's clothes. When the hospital staff discovers Faith is gone, a nurse makes a call, asking for a team to be sent out. Faith walks around Sunnydale looking at all the things that have changed, ending up outside Giles' house eavesdropping on the Scooby Gang's plans to attack Adam. A phone call informs Buffy that Faith is awake and on the loose. On campus the next day, Buffy and Willow run into Faith. The two Slayers talk about what happened—Faith taunting Buffy about having broken up with Angel, for whom she almost killed Faith—and fight briefly before the cops arrive and Faith runs. At the hospital, a helicopter lands, and three men carrying briefcases exit. Xander and Giles search the streets for Faith and Adam but instead encounter Spike, who claims he intends to help Faith kill them all. Buffy and Riley discuss their jobs working to fight the forces of evil. Buffy tells him he has a choice in what he does with his life. When the conversation turns to Faith, Buffy doesn't mention she stabbed her to save Angel. Faith is approached by a demon who tries to give her a gift, but she kills him and runs off with the box. She breaks into a multi-media store to watch a video tape of the Mayor on a VCR and then opens a box from him that contains a special gift, which is later revealed to be called the Draconian Katra. Giles finds the three men with briefcases are at his apartment. One of them says \\"Hello, Rupert\\", alerting Giles and the audience that the men are from the Watcher's Council. Faith arrives at Buffy's house and takes Joyce captive; knowing Buffy will come to her mother's rescue. The Slayers have a fight that travels through almost every room of the house while Joyce calls the police. Faith, holding the gift from the Mayor, grabs Buffy's hand. A light flows through them and Buffy punches Faith, knocking her unconscious. Buffy smashes the metal contraption from the Mayor and when Joyce asks if she's okay, Buffy responds with Faith's characteristic answer: \\"Five by five.\\" ==Production== In the audio commentary for the episode, writer Doug Petrie revealed he almost titled this episode \\"Rise and Shine\\". Also according to Petrie, this episode makes references to many other movies including The Shawshank Redemption (the shot of Faith crawling out of the grave in the pouring rain), The Silence of the Lambs (the demon that's been cut open and eviscerated, hanging by trees), and Star Trek (through dialogue).Writer Doug Petrie's commentary for the episode on the season 4 DVD. In the original version of the scene in which Buffy and Faith meet again for the first time, Doug Petrie had written Buffy attacking Faith first. Joss Whedon rejected this sequence because he felt it was \\"too unsympathetic to hit a girl who had just been in a coma.\\" The fire in the fireplace in the scene where Faith is spying on Buffy was a huge ordeal to produce. It was a real fire, and required a fire marshall on set as well as a certain number of fire extinguishers at the ready. Doug Petrie felt as though the ordeal was worth it because the scene needed to feel homey and cozy. ==Themes== This is the first episode in which the audience sees a dream sequence from Faith's perspective. Both this episode and \\"Who Are You\\" are meant to explore Buffy and Faith's relationship from Faith's perspective, as well as Faith's perspective of her relationship with the Mayor. Faith's dream sequences depict her Norman Rockwell vision of the way her life was, in which she is a normal girl who is loved by a father (the Mayor), and her belief that Buffy is the monster who ruined it all. In Faith's third and final dream sequence, Faith finally defeats Buffy and wakes from her coma. The characterization of Faith in this episode is \\"very Lucifer.\\" She wakes up in a version of hell, the hospital basement. She emerges from this hell and goes after the person who put her there. In their book discussing existentialism in Buffy, Richardson and Rabb argue that this episode and the next (intended or not) explore the impact of Sartre's Look - the outside view that causes a person to redefine themselves from the perspective of the Other. They interpret Faith's defection to the Mayor and relentless dreams of Buffy stalking her as Faith's attempt to escape Buffy’s judgmental Look and the accompanying guilt it brings. When the two Slayers meet again, Faith immediately denies her possession by Buffy, saying, \\"You’re not me.\\" However, she is beginning to acknowledge the guilt brought on by Buffy's Look; when Buffy expresses concern for the innocent people surrounding them, Faith claims there is no such thing as an innocent person. Richardson and Rabb point out that, therefore, Faith herself \\"must realize at some level she is not innocent, but is in fact guilty of horrendous crimes.\\" ==Continuity== When Spike threatens to send Faith after the Scoobies, he says: 'Just because I can't do the damage myself doesn't stop me from aiming a loose cannon your way.' In the Season Three episode Lovers Walk, when Spike comes back to town, Mayor Wilkins also describes Spike as a 'loose cannon'. This underscores the connection between Spike and Faith that is only briefly alluded to in Season Four, before developed further in Season Seven. The show's creators had initially planned a 'Spike and Faith' spin-off which never came to fruition. ==Arc significance== * In a dream, Buffy and Faith make a bed; Faith says \\"Little sister is coming,\\" foreshadowing the arrival of Dawn at the beginning of the next season. This is the second reference of Faith to Dawn's arrival. In third-season finale episode, in a dream, Faith says, to Buffy, \\"Little Miss Muffet counting down from 7-3-0.\\" 730 is the number of days until the end of Season 5, when Buffy will die again. * The post-mortem video Faith receives from The Mayor is particularly telling because The Mayor expresses serious doubts about his ascension plans being successful. He also encourages Faith to 'go out with a bang'- perhaps mirroring his own thought process prior to his ascension. ==Trivia== *The concept for the gadget Faith receives from the Mayor was based on gadgets designed by the American comic book artist Jack Kirby. *At 9 minutes into the episode during the scene where Buffy, Willow and Xander discover the Demon dissected by Adam, you can see a boom operator in the background. *At 19 minutes into the episode, in a scene where Faith is walking down the middle of a road in Sunnydale, the same couple (a man in beige trousers & a woman in a light-blue coat) cross the road behind Faith three times, always in the same direction. They are then seen crossing back the way they came a few seconds later. *At 38 minutes into the episode during the scene where Buffy and Faith fight, you can see a handheld camera panning on the left side of the stairs. ==ReferencesCategory:Buffy the Vampire Slayer (season 4) episodes Category:2000 American television episodes Category:Buffyverse crossover episodes Category:Fiction about body swapping ","title":"This Year's Girl"},{"id":"2550095","text":"Gidget () is a fictional character created by author Frederick Kohner (based on his teenage daughter, Kathy) in his 1957 novel, Gidget, the Little Girl with Big Ideas. The novel follows the adventures of a teenage girl and her surfing friends on the beach in Malibu. The name Gidget is a portmanteau of \\"girl\\" and \\"midget\\".Gidget(2001) by Frederick Kohner, Berkley Publishing Group, New York, NY (first edition 1957) Following the novel's publication, the character appeared in several films, television series and television movies. ==Novels== The original Gidget was created by Frederick Kohner in his 1957 novel Gidget, The Little Girl with Big Ideas (reprinted numerous times under the shortened title Gidget, by which it is more widely known), written in the first person and based on the accounts of his daughter Kathy (now Kathy Kohner-Zuckerman) of the surf culture of Malibu Point. The novel was published by Putnam. Kohner, a prolific screenwriter with one Academy Award nomination, published seven sequels to this novel, five of them original novels: *Cher Papa\\"Cher Papa\\" (1959) by Frederick Kohner, Putnam Books, New York, NY (1959) *The Affairs of Gidget\\"The Affairs of Gidget\\" (1963) by Frederick Kohner, Bantam Books, New York, NY (1963) *Gidget in LoveGidget in Love (1965) by Frederick Kohner, Dell Books, New York, NY (1965) *Gidget Goes ParisienneGidget Goes Parisienne(1966) by Frederick Kohner, Dell Books, New York, NY (1966) *Gidget Goes New YorkGidget Goes New York(1968) by Frederick Kohner, Dell Books, New York, NY(1968) Kohner also wrote two novelizations adapted from films of the same titles, based on original stories by Ruth Brooks Flippen. *Gidget Goes Hawaiian Gidget Goes Hawaiian (1961) by Frederick Kohner, Bantam Books, New York, NY (1961) *Gidget Goes to RomeGidget Goes To Rome(1963) by Frederick Kohner, Bantam Books, New York, NY (1963) ==Frederick Kohner== Kohner, a Czechoslovakian Jew, worked in the German film industry as a screenwriter until 1933 when he emigrated to Hollywood after the Nazis started removing Jewish credits from films. Over the coming decades Kohner and his wife Franzie raised their two daughters by the beach while he toiled as a screenwriter for Columbia Pictures. As his children grew into American teenagers he noticed that his daughter Kathy in particular was drawn into a very specific, regional, contemporary slice of American teenage culture – the surf culture. Surfing was a then-minor youth movement that built its foundation around a sport, love of the beach, and jargon that must have proved a challenge to an Eastern European immigrant. The details fascinated Kohner, who was empathetic with his daughter's feminist intention to participate in a \\"boys-only\\" sport. A book was conceived and Kathy became her father's muse as he delved into the surfing world with his daughter as his guide. Over a six-week period Kohner wove the stories she told into a novel, which he titled upon completion with her nickname, Gidget. In the original novel, Gidget gives her name as follows: > \\"It's Franzie,\\" I said. \\"From Franziska. It's a German name. After my > grandmother.\\" She does not give us her last name. In subsequent novels, her name is Franzie Hofer. In the films in which she appears, her name is changed to a more English sounding Frances Lawrence, and the names of some other characters are changed as well. In the 1960s television series (episode 16, \\"Now There's a Face\\"), Gidget gives her full name as Frances Elizabeth Lawrence. Kohner also wrote other novels about the experiences of different teenaged girls, including The Continental Kick, Mister Will You Marry Me? and The Gremmie, as well as non-fiction books such as the biographies Kiki of Montparnasse and The Magician of Sunset Boulevard. ==Films== Sandra Dee as Gidget in the 1959 film, (VHS cover) Kohner sold the movie rights to Columbia Pictures (through the William Morris Agency) for $50,000, then giving five percent of this to his daughter Kathy.info on the film deal In the late 1950s and early 1960s, the character Gidget (the prototypical beach bunny) was adapted for three films, all directed by Paul Wendkos and released by Columbia Pictures: * Gidget (1959), starring Sandra Dee * Gidget Goes Hawaiian (1961), starring Deborah Walley * Gidget Goes to Rome (1963), starring Cindy Carol The first film also featured a young Yvonne Craig and Tom Laughlin, long before Laughlin became known as Billy Jack and Craig as Batgirl and her alter-ego Barbara Gordon in the final season of Batman. Although the later two films were billed as sequels to the first, there was little attempt at continuity other than in the plot. Only James Darren, playing Gidget's boyfriend Moondoggie, has the same major role in all three films. For Gidget Goes Hawaiian, some scenes from the first film were re-shot with the new cast, to be used as flashbacks. ==Television== In 1965, the character was adapted for television in the Screen Gems sitcom series Gidget, starring Sally Field.Gidget: The Complete Series (2006). [DVD set]. New York: Sony Pictures. Don Porter, who had played Gidget's father in \\"Gidget Goes to Rome\\", reprised the role for the show. The series reintroduced Larue, a timid, awkward girl who often accompanied Gidget on her zany escapades, and an older married sister Anne Cooper (\\"Ann Cooper\\" in the novels), both of whom had appeared in the original 1957 novel but were absent from the motion pictures. Gidget's brother-in-law, who appeared in the novels as Larry Cooper, an intelligent but condescending child psychiatrist was reinvented in the television series as John Cooper, an obtuse but lovable psychology student. In the television series, Gidget regarded both her sister and brother-in-law as clueless squares. The pilot episode (\\"Dear Diary - et al.\\") explains that Gidget's boyfriend Moondoggie is sent east to Princeton University with the convenient understanding that both were free to date others while separated, thus opening plots to a variety of complications and guest stars. In the sitcom, Gidget's mother is deceased (unlike in the novels or the motion pictures), and the series focused on the father-daughter relationship, with Gidget receiving moral instruction from her father at episode's end and growing a little wiser from it. The sitcom ran for only one season, but spawned a devoted cult following. Sally Field as television's Gidget (1965) In 1969, Karen Valentine starred as Gidget in the telemovie Gidget Grows Up, freely adapted from the 1968 novel Gidget Goes New York, but also functioning as a sequel to the 1965 sitcom series.IMDb credits for Gidget Grows Up In 1972, another telemovie was made titled Gidget Gets Married, in which Gidget finally married longtime boyfriend Moondoggie. Monie Ellis played the title role.IMDb credits for Gidget Gets Married This incarnation of Gidget is unique in that it gives Moondoggie's real name as \\"Jeff Stevens.\\" In the novels, the other telemovies and The New Gidget he is \\"Geoffrey H. Griffin\\" (the middle initial is mentioned only in the first novel); in the Hollywood films and the sitcom Gidget he is \\"Jeffrey Matthews.\\" Later that year, Hanna- Barbera produced a 60-minute animated feature for television, Gidget Makes the Wrong Connection, with Kathy Gori as the voice of Gidget.Saturday Superstar Movies 2: Hanna-Barbera Productions, Gidget Makes the Wrong Connection It was broadcast as part of the Saturday morning series The ABC Saturday Superstar Movie. In 1985, a follow-up of the 1965 sitcom series was launched with the telemovie Gidget's Summer Reunion, starring Caryn Richman as a grown version of the character played by Sally Field.IMDb credits for Gidget's Summer Reunion This was followed by a sitcom series The New Gidget, which ran for two seasons, 1986–1988.IMDb credits for The New Gidget ==Stage== In 2000, Francis Ford Coppola staged a musical adaptation of Gidget with a cast of students from the Orange County High School for the Arts, calling it \\"sort of A Catcher in the Rye for girls\\". Coppola wrote the book and cowrote the score with John Farrar, and Krysta Rodriguez played Gidget. In 2007, Terry McCabe and Marissa McKown adapted a stage play Gidget from Kohner's 1957 novel. It was performed at City Lit Theater in Chicago in May and June 2007, directed by Marissa McKown and starred Sabrina Kramnich as Gidget.Review of stage play Gidget ==Gidget timeline== * 1941 Kathy Kohner born. * 1956 Kathy Kohner learns to surf and is nicknamed \\"Gidget\\". * 1957 Gidget, the Little Girl with Big Ideas published. * 1959 Motion picture Gidget released, Cher Papa published. * 1961 Motion picture Gidget Goes Hawaiian released, novelization Gidget Goes Hawaiian published. * 1963 The Affairs of Gidget published, motion picture Gidget Goes to Rome released, novelization Gidget Goes to Rome published. * 1965 Gidget in Love published, sitcom series Gidget first airs. * 1966 Gidget Goes Parisienne published, sitcom series Gidget canceled. * 1968 Gidget Goes New York published. * 1969 Telemovie Gidget Grows Up airs. * 1972 Telemovie Gidget Gets Married airs, animated feature Gidget Makes the Wrong Connection airs. * 1985 Telemovie Gidget's Summer Reunion airs. * 1986 Frederick Kohner dies, sitcom series The New Gidget airs. * 1988 Sitcom series The New Gidget canceled. ==In popular culture== * The Brunettes have a song titled \\"Too Big for Gidget\\".discography from Brunettes home page * Suburban Lawns have a song titled \\"Gidget Goes to Hell\\", released in 1979 on Suburban Industrial records and compiled on Just Can't Get Enough: New Wave Hits of the '80s, vol. 1.

His traditions were continued by the Motorin family. == Biography == Andrey Chokhov was born in about 1545, and entered the teaching of the well-known master cannon caster Kashpir Ganusov at a very young age, and stood out from the mass of Ganusov's students who performed regular work. Chokhov took the lead in casting cannons in Moscow in 1590. Chokhov had many disciples, some of whom later became famed cannon and bell casters themselves, such as Pronya Fedorov, Kondarty Mikhailov, Gregory Naumov, Alexey Nikiforov and others. He died as Master Andrey Chokhov in 1629. ==Chokhov as cannon maker== Chokhov's Tsar Cannon, at the Moscow Kremlin Andrey Chokhov began his career at the Cannon yard in Moscow during the reign of Ivan the Terrible in the 1550s as an apprentice to a German (?) caster Kashpir Ganusov (russified name). In the 1570s, Chokhov became one of the leading Muscovite casters and supervised production of heavy battering weapons, such as siege arquebus Лисица (Vixen) and battering ram Собака (Dog) (both made in 1575), big cannon Волк (Wolf; 1576-1577), and a colossal arquebus Инрог (Unicorn), which would become the largest cannon of the Russian siege artillery (1577; weight - 7,134 kg; displayed in St. Petersburg). In 1586, Andrey Chokhov founded his famous Tsar Cannon (Царь-пушка), a masterpiece of the casting art of the second half of the 16th century. In 1587, he cast a fire arquebus Егуп (Yegup), in 1588 - a 100-barrel cannon, in 1590 - battering rams Троил (Troilus), Аспид (Viper), Лев (Lion), Скоропея (Witch), and Соловей (Nightingale). Chokhov's last major works were big battering arquebuses called Кречет (Gyrfalcon) and Волк (Wolf), the production of which he supervised in 1627. ==Chokhov as bell maker== Andrey Chokhov is also known as a bell founder. In 1594 and 1603, he cast two huge bells (called благовестники, or blagovestniki) weighing 625 poods (10.2 metric tons) and 1,080 poods (17.8 t), correspondingly. These bells were donated by Boris Godunov to the Troitse-Sergiyeva Lavra. In 1621, Andrey Chokhov and other masters cast four bells for the Ivan the Great Bell Tower (one of them called Глухой (Muffled) can still be seen in the middle tier of the bell tower). In 1622, Chokhov cast a 20-ton bell called Реут (Reut). His biggest bell weighing 40 tons (cast in 1600) didn't survive to this day, as well as the so-called Godunov Bell (also known as Old Assumption Bell, or Resurrection Bell), which would be destroyed by fire in 1701.http://www.trekearth.com/gallery/photo582814.htm ==See also== * List of Russian inventors ==References== Category:Russian bell makers Category:Russian cannon makers Category:Russian inventors Category:Foundrymen Category:1540s births Category:1629 deaths ","title":"Andrey Chokhov"},{"id":"2550144","text":"BattleDragons is a role-playing game published by Spartacus Publishing in 2002. BattleDragons lets the player create and control one of the eight different dragon races in the Seven-Tiered world. It can be played as a role- playing game or a tabletop war game. ==Game setting== BattleDragons is played on the Seven-Tiered world created by the gods. The world consists of seven separate worlds layered on top of each other connected by The Tower. Other than dragons there are twelve intelligent races located on the worlds. (Human, Dwarf, Elf, Goblin, Orc, Ogre, Cherub, Fae, Centaur, Mer, Giant and the Titan) ==Dragon creation== Each of the eight dragon races (Great, Mystic, Hydra, Wyvern, Basilisk, Wyrm, Feathered serpent, Bipedal) starts with a set number of creation points to spend on basic statistics, armor, weapons and other powers. Armor points work as the dragon's scales as damage is done they get ripped off lowering the dragon’s protection. There are several types of weapons for dragons to use including claws, teeth, horns, eyeblasts, poison, and breath attacks. Other powers to spend points on are wings, extra senses and magic. ==Game mechanics== BattleDragons uses a dice pool of ten-sided dice and a target number for most actions. The target number is found by starting with a base number and adding any good or bad modifiers to the chance and rolling the character's pool of dice. Every roll lower or equal to the target number counts as one success. The more successes scored the better the task is performed. ==External links== *Spartacus Publishing, LLC *Web Archive for Spartacus Publishing *RPGnet Review *d20 Magazine Rack Review Category:Fantasy role-playing games Category:Role-playing games introduced in 2002 ","title":"BattleDragons"},{"id":"2550147","text":"In the C and C++ programming languages, an #include guard, sometimes called a macro guard, header guard or file guard, is a particular construct used to avoid the problem of double inclusion when dealing with the include directive. The C preprocessor processes directives of the form \`#include \` in a source file by locating the associated \`file\` on disk and transcluding (\\"including\\") its contents into a copy of the source file known as the translation unit, replacing the include directive in the process. The files included in this regard are generally header files, which typically contain declarations of functions and classes or structs. If certain C or C++ language constructs are defined twice, the resulting translation unit is invalid. #include guards prevent this erroneous construct from arising by the double inclusion mechanism. The addition of #include guards to a header file is one way to make that file idempotent. Another construct to combat double inclusion is #pragma once, which is non-standard but nearly universally supported among C and C++ compilers. ==Double inclusion== === Example === The following C code demonstrates a real problem that can arise if #include guards are missing: ==== File \\"grandparent.h\\" ==== struct foo { int member; }; ==== File \\"parent.h\\" ==== #include \\"grandparent.h\\" ==== File \\"child.c\\" ==== #include \\"grandparent.h\\" #include \\"parent.h\\" ==== Result ==== struct foo { int member; }; struct foo { int member; }; Here, the file \\"child.c\\" has indirectly included two copies of the text in the header file \\"grandparent.h\\". This causes a compilation error, since the structure type \`foo\` will thus be defined twice. In C++, this would be called a violation of the one definition rule. ==Use of #include guards== === Example === In this section, the same code is used with the addition of #include guards. The C preprocessor preprocesses the header files, including and further preprocessing them recursively. This will result in a correct source file, as we will see. ====File \\"grandparent.h\\"==== #ifndef GRANDPARENT_H #define GRANDPARENT_H struct foo { int member; }; #endif /* GRANDPARENT_H */ ==== File \\"parent.h\\" ==== #include \\"grandparent.h\\" ==== File \\"child.c\\" ==== #include \\"grandparent.h\\" #include \\"parent.h\\" ==== Result ==== struct foo { int member; }; Here, the first inclusion of \\"grandparent.h\\" has the macro \`GRANDPARENT_H\` defined. When \\"child.c\\" includes \\"grandparent.h\\" at the second time, as the \`#ifndef\` test returns false, the preprocessor skips down to the \`#endif\`, thus avoiding the second definition of \`struct foo\`. The program compiles correctly. === Discussion === Different naming conventions for the guard macro may be used by different programmers. Other common forms of the above example include \`GRANDPARENT_INCLUDED\`, \`CREATORSNAME_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS\` (with the appropriate time information substituted), and names generated from a UUID. (However, names starting with one underscore and a capital letter or any name containing double underscore, such as \`_GRANDPARENT__H\` and \`__GRANDPARENT_H\`, are reserved to the language implementation and should not be used by the user.C++ standard (ISO/IEC 14882) section 17.4.3.1.2/1C standard (ISO/IEC 9899) section 7.1.3/1.) Of course, it is important to avoid duplicating the same include-guard macro name in different header files, as including the 1st will prevent the 2nd from being included, leading to the loss of any declarations, inline definitions, or other #includes in the 2nd header. ==Difficulties== In order for #include guards to work properly, each guard must test and conditionally set a different preprocessor macro. Therefore, a project using #include guards must work out a coherent naming scheme for its include guards, and make sure its scheme doesn't conflict with that of any third-party headers it uses, or with the names of any globally visible macros. For this reason, most C and C++ implementations provide a non- standard \`#pragma once\` directive. This directive, inserted at the top of a header file, will ensure that the file is included only once. The Objective-C language (which is a superset of C) introduced an \`#import\` directive, which works exactly like \`#include\`, except that it includes each file only once, thus obviating the need for #include guards. ==See also== *\` #pragma once\` *C preprocessor *Circular dependency *One Definition Rule ==References== ==External links== *Include guard optimisation *Redundant Include Guards Category:C (programming language) headers ","title":"Include guard"}]`),I={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:B},data(){return{visibleCount:3,poemsData:P}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=3}}},R={class:"card-container"};function H(s,a,n,c,u,i){const m=p("PoemCard");return t(),o(l,null,[a[1]||(a[1]=e("section",null,[e("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"🎉Life Quotes🥳")])])],-1)),e("section",null,[e("div",R,[(t(!0),o(l,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(r,f)=>(t(),b(m,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:a[0]||(a[0]=(...r)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...r))},"See more")):w("",!0)])],64)}const D=d(I,[["render",H]]),E=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"drive/58.md","filePath":"drive/58.md"}'),x={name:"drive/58.md"},L=Object.assign(x,{setup(s){return(a,n)=>(t(),o("div",null,[v(D)]))}});export{E as __pageData,L as default};
