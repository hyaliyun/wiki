He competed part-time in the Craftsman Truck Series from 2000 to 2003. Burr also drove numerous races in the NASCAR Southeast Series, particularly in the mid and late 1990s, where he ran nearly full seasons and picked up one win in 1999. ==Racing career== Burr made his debut in 2000, when he drove the Jim Rosenblum Racing No. 28 Chevy into the field at Martinsville. He started the event in 31st, but only managed 25th. Yet, he did finish the event, a tall task at the short track. Burr made another solo start in 2001, driving for his own team at Nashville. He started the event in last (36th) and only made it up to 34th before retiring early. Burr returned to Rosenblum's team in 2002 for a five race schedule. He did well, finishing all but one race with the low- budget team. He had a good run at Las Vegas, earning his season best of 23rd, while at Texas Burr started 27th for his best start of the year. His 46th- place finish in points would prove to be his career high. Burr made four starts as 2003 would prove to be his last year. Returning to a family-owned team, Burr earned two top-20 finishes in his starts. The better of those would prove to be a 15th at Dover, coupled with the 18th at Memphis. Also, at Charlotte, Burr earned his best career start of 25th. Despite having his best year in 2003, Burr's team folded and he never made another NASCAR start after that. ==Motorsports career resultsNASCAR=== (key) (Bold – Pole position awarded by qualifying time.

It was the third final of the world's oldest football competition, the Football Association Challenge Cup (known in the modern era as the FA Cup). Both teams had previously reached the final but been defeated by Wanderers. The Engineers had reached the final with comparative ease, scoring sixteen goals and conceding only one in the four previous rounds. Oxford's opponents in the earlier rounds had included two-time former winners Wanderers. The final was decided by two goals from Oxford in the first twenty minutes. Their opponents had spent two weeks training for the match, an innovative concept at the time, but were repeatedly thwarted by Charles Nepean, the Oxford goalkeeper. The Engineers were said to have missed their best back, Lieut. Alfred Goodwyn, who had been posted overseas. ==Route to the final== Vidal, Green, Mackarness, Johnson, Benson, Birley, Nepean; Seated: Ottaway, Patton, Maddison, Rawson. Oxford University and the Chatham-based Royal Engineers were among 28 entrants to the competition in the 1873–74 season. Both teams were ranked among the strongest in the country at the time, especially the Engineers who played 86 games between 1871 and 1875 and lost only three, scoring a total of 240 goals and conceding only 20.Warsop, p. 20 Both teams progressed through the first round of the competition with little difficulty, Oxford defeating Upton Park 4–0 and the Engineers winning 5–0 against Brondesbury. In the second round, the University beat Barnes 2–0 and the \\"Sappers\\", as the Engineers were nicknamed, beat Uxbridge 2–1. The Engineers comprehensively defeated their quarter-final opponents, Maidenhead, winning 7–0, the first time a team had ever scored as many as seven goals in an FA Cup match. Oxford, on the other hand, were paired with Wanderers, who had won the competition in both its first two seasons and never lost an FA Cup match. They had defeated the Engineers in the 1872 final and Oxford in the 1873 final. The first match finished in a 1–1 draw, necessitating a replay which Oxford won 1–0 to end Wanderers' grip on the competition. Both semi-final matches were played at Kennington Oval, the home of Surrey County Cricket Club, as specified by the rules in use at the time. Royal Engineers defeated Swifts in the first match to be played, and Oxford booked their place in the final a month later with a 1–0 win over Clapham Rovers. ==MatchSummary=== Cuthbert Ottaway was the Oxford captain. Oxford were able to call on their first-choice goalkeeper, Charles Nepean, who had been unable to play in the previous year's final, which Oxford lost. They also selected William Rawson, whose brother Herbert was in the Engineers' team. The Engineers, who represented the Corps of Royal Engineers regiment of the British army, had undertaken two weeks of special training before the match, an innovative concept in an era when little importance was placed on training,Warsop, p. 19 but were unable to field Alfred Goodwyn, considered to be their best back, as he had been posted to India earlier in the year.Warsop, p. 81 Oxford's players were not all students, as the team included Arthur Johnson, an ordained clergyman and Fellow of All Souls College.Warsop, p. 91 Around 2,000 spectators were in attendance, a smaller crowd than had attended the previous final.Warsop, p. 41 Oxford won the coin toss and elected to begin the game defending the Harleyford Road end of the stadium.Warsop, p. 42 Charles Mackarness gave Oxford the lead after just ten minutes. Following an Oxford corner kick, a melee developed in front of the Engineers' goal, and the ball fell to Mackarness, who shot it over the crowd of players and past goalkeeper William Merriman.Warsop, p. 31 Frederick Patton doubled the lead ten minutes later after some skillful dribbling by captain Cuthbert Ottaway and Robert Vidal, who was nicknamed the \\"prince of dribblers\\" for his skill in that aspect of the game.Warsop, p. 130 Oxford could have had a third goal when they managed to get the ball through the Engineers' goalposts, but the players did not appeal for the goal. At the time, as in cricket, the officials were not permitted to award a goal unless the players appealed for it, thus no goal was given. It is not recorded why the Oxford players never appealed. The best effort for the Engineers came when Henry Renny-Tailyour's shot struck the goalpost. Late in the game the \\"Sappers\\" mounted a series of attacks on the Oxford goal but were unable to score, being repeatedly thwarted by Nepean. Oxford thus won 2–0 and secured the cup. ===Details=== { width=92%  -    } { style=\\"width:100%\\" - style=\\"vertical-align:top;width:40%\\" { style=\\"font-size:90%\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\" - !width=\\"25\\" !!width=\\"25\\" - Gk  Charles Nepean - FB Charles Mackarness - HB  Francis Birley - HB Frederick Green - FW   Robert Benson - FW  Frederick Maddison - FW  William Rawson - FW  Cuthbert Ottaway - FW  Rev.

Some time after the match, the Engineers discovered that Alfred Goodwyn, their absent star player, had died in India on the day of the final of injuries sustained in a fall from a horse. ==References== ;General * ;Specific ==External links== *Line-ups 1874 FA Category:1874 in London Category:Oxford University A.F.C. matches Category:March 1874 sports events ","title":"1874 FA Cup Final"},{"id":"6203455","text":"Chase Harrison (born April 2, 1984 in Huntington, West Virginia) is an American soccer player who most recently played for Philadelphia Union in Major League Soccer. ==CareerCollege and Amateur=== Harrison attended Huntington High School and played college soccer at Virginia Tech from 2002 to 2005.

With an annual budget of over $100 million, 45 citywide sites, and over 1,200 full-time employees, Children's Aid is one of America's oldest and largest children's nonprofits. Children's Aid helps tens of thousands of disadvantaged New York City children succeed annually, by providing comprehensive services of adoption and foster care, after-school and weekend programs, arts, camps, early childhood education, events, family support, medical, mental health, and dental, juvenile justice, legal advocacy, special initiatives, sports and recreation, and youth development programs. ==History== From Harvard's Underwood & Underwood 1909 Collection From Harvard's Underwood & Underwood 1909 Collection From Harvard's Underwood & Underwood 1909 Collection From Harvard's Underwood & Underwood 1909 Collection In 1853, Children's Aid was founded by Yale College graduate and philanthropist, Charles Loring Brace, with financial support from New York businessmen and philanthropists, to ensure the physical and emotional well-being of children, and provide them with the support needed to become successful adults. Brace was appalled by the thousands of abandoned, abused, and orphaned children living in the slums and on the streets of New York at the time. The only options available to such children at the time were begging, prostitution, petty thievery, and gang membership, or commitment to jails, almshouses, and orphanages. Brace believed that institutional care stunted and destroyed children. His view was only work, education, and a strong family life could help them develop into self- reliant citizens. Brace knew that American pioneers could use help settling the American West, and arranged to send the orphaned children to them. This became known as the Orphan Train Movement. The children were encouraged to break completely with the past and would arrive in a town where community leaders assembled interested townspeople for inspection and selection. The program was controversial, as some abolitionists viewed it as a form of slavery, while pro-slavery advocates saw it part of the abolitionist movement, since the labor provided by the children made slaves unnecessary. Some Catholics deemed the program to be anti-Catholic, since a significant percentage of poor children in Manhattan were Irish Catholic, and would be raised outside of their faith once transported into the interior of the country. In response, the Archdiocese of New York upgraded their own child- welfare programs, improving the parochial school system, building more Catholic orphanages, and creating a 114-acre (46-hectare) training center on farmland in the Bronx, which they called the Catholic Protectory. p.783-784 From 1853 to the last train in 1929, more than 200,000 children rode the \\"Orphan Train\\" to new lives. The Orphan Train Heritage Society maintains an archive of riders' stories. The National Orphan Train Museum in Concordia, Kansas maintains records and also houses a research facility. ===Development=== Other child welfare innovations Since originating the Orphan Train in 1853, Children's Aid has founded a series of child welfare innovations that have since become commonplace, such as: * some of the first industrial schools * the first parent-teacher associations * the first free school lunch programs * the first free dental clinics for children * the first day schools for handicapped children * the first kindergarten in the United States * the first foster homes * the first “fresh air” vacations, in which urban children visit host families in the country for the summer. *toy drives for children during the holidays In the 1980s Children's Aid created the first family court diversion programs, where social workers meet with out-of-control children and their families in an attempt to find out of court solutions. In 1992, Children's Aid created the first \\"community school\\", a partnership with the New York City Department of Education where a full array of health, mental and after-school, weekend and summer programs are available to students at school. The Technical Assistance Center has helped visitors from all over the United States and more than 40 foreign countries learn how to apply \\"community school\\" concepts in their schools. In 2009, it was honored with a Village Award from the Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation for its Philip Coltoff Center in Greenwich Village (since razed for new residential development). In 2012, Children's Aid was rated 4/4 stars by charities rating organization Charity Navigator for a record-breaking 12th consecutive year. Leadership In 1912, Charles Loring Brace Jr. was re-elected board secretary of the society founded by his father. Board Chair Emeriti include Edward Lamont, Sr. and Edgar Koerner, with over thirty notable board members. In 2014, the Children's Aid board of trustees appointed Phoebe C.

In its first year, there were a total of seven school-aged students, six males and one female, and six under school age for a total of 13. In 1901, the Hutchinson County Commissioners Court divided the county into four school districts, Spring Creek being named district #4. The school moved to several different locations until the 1930s, when a red brick school building was constructed. On March 8, 1938, the school was dedicated in a ceremony attended by approximately 500 people. The Spring Creek Independent School District was formed in 1949.

A hope chest, also called dowry chest, cedar chest, trousseau chest or glory box is a piece of furniture traditionally used to collect items such as clothing and household linen, by unmarried young women in anticipation of married life. The term \\"hope chest\\" or \\"cedar chest\\" is used in the midwest or south of the United States; in the United Kingdom, the term is \\"bottom drawer\\"; while both terms, and \\"glory box\\" are used by women in Australia.https://www.macquariedictionary.com.au/features/word/search/?word=glory+box&search;_word_type=Dictionary \\"By the turn of the [20th] century the trousseau and the glory-box had become accepted institutions for the readers of the weekly and monthly women's magazines.\\" Girl inspecting her hope chest, by Poul Friis Nybo, c. 1900 Renaissance hope chest (cassone) from Florence (15th century) == Social context == Using her own needlework skills to construct a trousseau and stock her glory-box \\"was for the working girl the equivalent of planning and saving for marriage on the part of the provident and ambitious young man.\\" The collection of a trousseau was a common coming-of-age rite until approximately the 1950s; it was typically a step on the road to marriage between courting a man and engagement. It wasn't always collected in a special chest, hence the alternative UK term bottom drawer, which refers to putting aside one drawer in a chest of drawers for collecting the trousseau undisturbed, but such a chest was an acceptable gift for a girl approaching a marriageable age. Contents of a \\"hope chest\\" or \\"glory box\\" included typical dowry items such as clothing (especially a special dress), table linens, towels, bed linens, quilts and occasionally dishware. As a bride would typically leave home on marriage, hope chests were sometimes made with an eye to portability, albeit infrequently. Examples of hand-made items made between 1916 and 1918 for a trousseau by a prospective bride are on display in the National Museum of Australia. In this case, the trousseau—never used because its creator's fiancé was killed in World War I before the marriage took place—was stored in calico bags rather than in a chest. The hope chest was often used for the firstborn girl of a family. Instead of just having sheets and household linen in the bottom drawer, this box would transport these goods and dowries and then later be used as a standard piece of furniture for the lady of the house to use. This dowry chest was often richly decorated, however over time dowry chests gradually became smaller, with jewelry boxes emerging instead of large dowry boxes. By contrast, a \\"bridal chest\\" was given to a bride at her wedding, by her husband, and so is not a \\"hope chest\\" in this sense. == Historical origins == Italian - \\"Cassone\\" - Walters 6535 * Cassone of renaissance Italy Aussteuerschrank - a dowry closet, currently in a German museum. : Large decorated and showy chests, forming part of dynastic marriages in 15th and 16th century Italy. These were prized displays of wealth, of even more value than their contents. * Dutch kast or German Schrank : These are tall wardrobe- like chests with double doors. These are larger than most hope chests, intended for regular service in the home after marriage, and so were constructed as to partially dismantle for transport. * American settlers : The peak of the hope chest as folk art came with the waves of European immigrants to America. Many of these, from Scandinavia to the Northern Midwest and Germans in Pennsylvania (Amish, had long traditions of plainly constructed chests with extensive painted decoration. * Arabic origins : These chests were also known as \\"dower chests\\" in the Middle East. \\"The more than 300,000 surviving documents in the Cairo Genizah are one of our richest sources of insight into daily life in Egypt from the ninth to the 19th centuries. Among them are numerous marriage contracts, and almost all refer to a dower chest.

They were not usually elaborately decorated, except in the case of the ruling class.\\"\\"The Art of the Dowery Chest.\\" by Caroline Stone. Aramco World. Volume 66, (8). November–December 2015. [ISSN]: 1530-5821. Page 27. == Suffocation hazard to children == There have been several instances of child deaths due to suffocation inside hope chests, due to the piece's traditional design which can trap children under a heavy and sometimes self-locking lid. In 1996, following reports of at least six child suffocation deaths, the manufacturer Lane Furniture recalled 12 million hope chests, the lids of which latched shut automatically, and could not be opened from the inside. Specifically, the recall applied to the locks of all \\"Lane\\" and \\"Virginia Maid\\" cedar chests manufactured between 1912 and 1987. As part of the recall, they provide new lock latch configuration replacement parts. However, they estimated that 6 million chests still used the recalled lock latch. As of 2020, Lane Furniture still offered replacement locks through their website. == Styles == The typical hope chest is of lidded blanket chest form. In some traditions, there may also be one or two side-by-side drawers beneath. As with blanket chests, a small till may also be found inside for small items. === Lane Company chests === As the contents of such a chest would primarily be linens, construction in moth-repellent cedar, or at least a cedar lining, was popular. The Lane Company of Altavista, Virginia (active 1912-2001) were a notable maker of cedar chests. After developing production- line techniques for making ammunition boxes during World War I, they turned these production techniques (and a patented locking-mitre corner joint) into vast numbers of chests. This was aided by strong advertising, using a teenaged Shirley Temple as a model, in a campaign targeted at GIs and absentee sweethearts of World War II. They were particularly well known for their practice (since 1930) of distributing miniature (9\\" long) cedar chests to girls graduating from high-school as advertising gifts. The Eastern Redcedar (Juniperus virginiana) is the \\"cedar\\" used in making moth-repelling cedar chests and drawers, as well as pencils. === Decoration === Decoration is not an intrinsic part of the hope chest, but often appears. * Carving : Carving was notable in the 17th and 18th century joined oak chests. The Hadley chests of Massachusetts are covered by extensive surface carving in the typical low- relief style of the period. * Painting : This is typically seen in the Scandinavian and German immigrant traditions and follows traditional styles. In many Arab countries, they are still referred to as \\"sanduq ‘arus\\", or “wedding box,” although modern trends have them made of metal rather than wood, and looking more like a footlocker. They are elaborately painted, often with a mosque dome or architectural design on the lid, with the color red predominating.\\"The Art of the Dowery Chest.\\" by Caroline Stone. Aramco World. Volume 66, (8). November–December 2015. [ISSN]: 1530-5821. Page 29. * Gesso : The elaborate gilded gesso of the cassoni was produced by skilled and expensive craftsmen. This work has not been seen since and doesn't form part of the folk tradition. * Sulfur inlay : Sulfur inlay is a rare technique in furniture and for chests it is only known for a short period. Between 1765 and around 1820, German immigrant cabinetmakers in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, used it to decorate the surface of chests. The Deitrich chest of 1783 is now in the Smithsonian. == In popular culture == In the 1920s, 'hope chest' was slang for a pack of cigarettes. \\"Glory Box\\" is also the title of a song from the band Portishead. The song is about a woman who is giving up her time as a temptress to commit to a settled life with a man, asking him to take a look from her side every now and then. In the 1985 movie Back to the Future, the character Lorraine McFly refers to having placed Marty McFly's pants \\"over there...on my hope chest\\" after he had been knocked unconscious. The joke implies her romantic interest in Marty when, unbeknownst to Lorraine, Marty is her son from the future. In Glee, Kurt Hummel has claimed to own a hope chest. This is an ironic inversion of the hope chest's usual role for a prospective bride, as Kurt is a gay teenage boy. In the 2012 film The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, Bilbo Baggins asks Kili to \\"please not do that\\" on his mother's glory box, when the dwarf cleans his boots on the chest. This suggests that in Middle Earth women (possibly from the high society) also used hope chests, at least in Hobbiton. In Me and You and Everyone We Know, Peter and Robbies' neighbor has a hope chest, which is a part of the climax of the film. In The New Yankee Workshop, Norm Abram demonstrates how to build and paint a Pennsylvania Dutch-style hope chest (called a dower chest in the episode) modeled on one on display at the Winterthur Museum in Delaware. ==See also== *Dower *Bride price *Dowry == References  Category:Chests (furniture) Category:Marriage ","title":"Hope chest"},{"id":"6203534","text":"Schoolboys in Disgrace, or The Kinks Present Schoolboys in Disgrace, is a 1975 concept album by the Kinks. It was considered by critics to be the last album in what they dubbed the group's \\"theatrical\\" period, and their final release for RCA Records. The album is rooted in 1950s rock and roll, and also includes elements of doo-wop, hard rock, and arena rock. The front cover was illustrated by London artist and illustrator, Colin 'Mickey' Finn (not of T Rex), who also created the two removal men characters used in the Dire Straits video \\"Money for Nothing\\". It later appeared on NMEs list of the '50 worst covers of all time'. In 1978 the Finnish band Kontra had a number one hit with the song \\"Jerry Cotton\\" which was a cover version of the song \\"Jack the Idiot Dunce.\\"Suomi soi 4: Suuri suomalainen listakirja (Tammi, 2005; toim. Jake Nyman) ==Concept== According to the back cover liner notes, the story which the album presents is as follows: > Once upon a time there was a naughty little schoolboy. He and his gang were > always playing tricks on the teachers and bullying other children in the > school. One day he got himself into very serious trouble with a naughty > schoolgirl and he was sent to the Headmaster who decided to disgrace the > naughty boy and his gang in front of the whole school. > After this punishment the boy turned into a hard and bitter character. > Perhaps it was not the punishment that changed him but the fact that he > realised people in authority would always be there to kick him down and the > Establishment would always put him in his place. He knew that he could not > change the past but he vowed that in the future he would always get what he > wanted. The naughty little boy grew up... into Mr Flash. Mr Flash was the name of the villain from the Kinks' rock opera Preservation (released as Preservation Act 1 and Preservation Act 2). ==Reception== Reviewing in Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies (1981), Robert Christgau regarded the album as \\"yet another original cast recording\\" and mocked Davies' indictment of \\"Education\\" in the \\"big production number\\" of the same name: \\"Ultimate Cause. Go get 'em, Ray.\\" Stephen Thomas Erlewine writing for AllMusic criticised the album's combination of '50s rock and roll and contemporary arena rock, and deemed it \\"one of their least satisfying albums\\". In 2015, the band's guitarist Dave Davies spoke positively of the album in a Yahoo interview, saying, \\"Schoolboys in Disgrace is a great album. At the time, we were so busy doing it and getting it out and touring and playing it. Over a matter of three years it was gone and we were doing something else. But when you draw this into the present, it’s like, 'Oh my God, what the f— is this?!? How did we do that?' We've been very fortunate, Ray and I and the Kinks.

By 2016 Kashmere underwent remodeling. ==Administration== From about 2008 until 2016 the school had four principals and one interim principal. HISD superintendent Abelardo Saavedra attempted to demote one principal, but the board of education reversed his decision. Saavedra's successor, Terry Grier, fired that principal. In 2010 HISD accused principal Mable Caleb of stealing school property and facilitating academic dishonesty, and the board voted to fire her. However an administrative law judge ruled in 2014 that Caleb was not guilty of the charges. Caleb sued HISD, and in 2016 the two parties agreed to a settlement in which she received $550,000. By 2016 Nancy Blackwell was the principal. She had previous experience with low income teaching environments in the Aldine Independent School District. The principal prior to Blackwell was relatively new to being a principal, as was Blackwell herself, although Blackwell had previous experience as an administrator. Circa 2018 Reginald \\"Reggie\\" Bush began his principalship. ==Curriculum== students may take courses with Houston Community College (HCC) as part of a partnership. ==Academic performance== Beginning in 2002 and continuing as of 2016 Kashmere had repeated issues with academic performance. From the period 2005 to 2015 members of the surrounding community protested reoccurring plans to close Kashmere stemming from its low performance.Michels, Patrick. \\"Houston's Learning Curve.\\" Politico.

In 2016 HISD academic officer Grenita Lathan stated that issues at the elementary school and middle schools which feed into Kashmere contribute to the academic issues at the high school. Margaret Downing of the Houston Press wrote that the school has had a \\"lasting stigma\\" due to its poor academic performance. Kashmere, with Jack Yates High School and Sam Houston High School, were the three high schools in Houston ISD which were consistently low-performing in test scores from 2001 to 2004. Because of this problem, there were movements to have the state or another organization take over the schools for a period so the test scores will be at acceptable levels. While Yates got an acceptable rating in 2005, Sam Houston and Kashmere continued to get unacceptable ratings. In August 2006 the school learned that it again was getting an unacceptable rating from the Texas Education Agency (TEA). When the Houston ISD administration threatened closure if another \\"unacceptable\\" rating came the following year, the local community protested. In summer 2007, Abelardo Saavedra, the superintendent of HISD, formally requested that all of the schools under consideration for closing due to academic performance should stay open.\\"Dr. Saavedra Recommends That Kashmere High School Remain Open.\\" Kashmere High School.

Sunday October 14, 2007. B1 MetFront. As of 2015 many students zoned to Kashmere transferred to Barbara Jordan High School. In the 2014-2015 school year 47% of students passed state examinations. In September of that year the State of Texas appointed Kashmere alumna Doris Delaney as the conservator of the school. Delaney had a working relationship with Blackwell. To address the issues, the school began to more heavily emphasize career and university preparation, increased observation of teaching, and hired additional counselors. In 2016 HISD board member Rhonda Skillern-Jones stated that Kashmere had made more improvement during two years of Blackwell's leadership than during the preceding eight years under other principals. In addition an agency was brought in to resolve issues stemming from the students' home lives. By December 2016 a nonprofit organization called ProUnitas, established by former Kashmere teacher Adeeb Barqawi, began acting as a case manager and identifying especially needy students at Kashmere so the school administration can better serve them and allow them to prosper in an academic environment. By offering the services on-campus, students are more likely to accept them and participate. In 2019 the TEA ranked the school \\"C\\". Margaret Downing of the Houston Press wrote that \\"Because when you're looking at another \\"F,\\" clearing the hurdles with a \\"C\\" is next to a miracle.\\" ==Transportation== most students walk to school, and other than school buses have few means of traveling to other schools. ==Athletics and extracurricular activities== Wheatley High School is Kashmere's rival. Kashmere students believed that any fellow students who transferred to Wheatley were traitorous towards Kashmere. Kashmere's JROTC had over 235 students. ===Music=== Kashmere High School was home of the Kashmere Stage Band, a nationally renowned band that released several jazz/funk albums in the 1960s and 1970s.

Of the students, 72% were African American and 27% were Hispanic American. About 20% were eligible to take special education classes. The majority of the students were classified as low income. By 2016 it had 608 students, with 14% being Hispanic or Latino and a total of five students being white. The campus was under-utilized due to the low population; Blackwell stated that when she first arrived to the campus she believed \\"it looked like it had been abandoned\\". In the 1970s the student population was about 1,500, and in the 1980s it was about 1,800. the student body was so poor that the school offered free early dinner service, in addition to free breakfast and lunch. Some of the female students were mothers, having experienced teenage pregnancy. ==Neighborhoods served by Kashmere== Kashmere serves the Houston Gardens, Kashmere Gardens, Settegast, and Trinity Gardens areas.\\"Kashmere High School Attendance Zone,\\" Houston Independent School District.

This list is not intended to be a comprehensive list of every such event, but only those that had a significant impact on the parks or park operations, or are otherwise significantly newsworthy. The term incidents refers to major accidents, injuries, or deaths that occur at a park. These incidents were required to be reported to regulatory authorities due to where they occurred. They usually fall into one of the following categories: # Negligence on the part of the guest, such as refusal to follow specific ride safety instructions. # A guest deliberately breaking park rules. # A guest's known, or unknown, health issues. # Negligence on the part of the park, either by a ride operator or maintenance staff. # An Act of God or a generic accident (e.g., slipping and falling) that is not a direct result of an action or inaction on anybody's part. ==Canada's WonderlandThe Bat=== * On July 20, 2004, twenty people were stranded on the coaster due to a malfunction. ===Other incidents involving guests=== * On May 11, 2003, with the park packed with people for Mother's Day, two guests were involved in a fight at the front gates of the park, which led to a shooting death. It was thought to have followed a prior dispute involving the two over a drug exchange, according to York Regional Police. The park has since added metal detectors at the front gate, with additional security. * On October 26, 2014, two people were stabbed in the parking lot after the amusement park had closed. One of the victims, a 21-year-old man, was pronounced dead at the scene. The other victim, an 18-year-old boy, was taken to an area hospital with \\"critical injuries\\" and was later released. On November 13, 2014, York police announced the arrest of an 18-year-old boy in connection with the attack. They believed the attack was part of a confrontation that began inside the park and continued into the parking lot where the matter escalated. Allegedly, other victims involved in the altercation did not report their injuries. ===Victoria Falls=== * An 18-year- old diver from Scarborough, Ontario, drowned in the pond below the waterfall on Victoria Day weekend in 1988. After swimming for 10 minutes, he approached the falls to retrieve a frisbee. His brother tried to help but was pulled underwater several times. Resuscitation efforts by park staff failed. In an inquest, Wonderland's Director of Engineering denied the pond had an undertow. Security and warning signs were posted after the incident, which was ultimately blamed on a whirlpool effect created by the waterfall. ==CarowindsCarolina Harbor=== *On June 7, 1987, five people were charged for allegedly shooting two people inside the water park with an unregistered machine gun. A 16-year-old girl from Rock Hill, South Carolina was killed after a large caliber bullet shot her in the back and exited her chest while she was playing in the wave pool and the other being a 6-year-old girl who suffered injuries and was also left wounded as she was hit by the abdomen. She was also hospitalized for five days following the accident. ===Copperhead Strike=== *On August 18, 2019, a guest was taken to the hospital after receiving a hand injury while riding. The ride was temporarily shut down following an investigation. ===Dodg'em=== *On June 4, 2018, one of the vehicles caught on fire. There were no injuries. ===Drop Tower: Scream Zone=== *On May 17, 1996, one of the cars didn't ascend to the top of the tower after the ride's safety control system locked the brakes to prevent it from going up despite park maintenance trying to release it manually. Three people were stuck in the air for nearly three hours and were rescued. ===Nighthawk=== * On March 17, 2007, seven park employees riding in a test run of BORG Assimilator (later renamed Nighthawk) received minor injuries when the seats changed position during the ride. The ride operator accidentally pressed a button after the train left the station that unlocked the pins responsible for keeping the seats in a fixed position. The ride was later modified to disable the button while trains are in motion. ===Park-wide incidents=== * On June 9, 2016, a transformer exploded near the park which caused a power cut to the park. Riders were stranded on various rides, including 17 on WindSeeker and an unspecified number on the Intimidator roller coaster. This incident also caused Fury 325 to come to a halt, leaving some riders stranded in the middle of the ride, and others just out of the gate. No riders were injured, although some waited over an hour before they were evacuated by park personnel. The park was scheduled to open normally the following day, but with some affected rides closed. * On September 5, 2016, at the same time when the park was closing, the police were informed that a 22-year-old man from Charlotte, North Carolina, allegedly shot a 14-year-old boy in the bus parking lot. According to deputies, they believed that the shooting was started as an argument inside of the park. The man was arrested by the police while the boy was hospitalized at Carolinas Medical Center suffering life-threatening injuries. ===Rip Roarin' Rapids=== *On May 8, 1982, eight people were injured when two boats jammed into each other, resulting in a collision between other boats coming down the ride and another being knocked over by a guardrail. ===Thunder Road=== *On July 25, 1979, a malfunction brought the roller coaster to a sudden halt when the wheels on one of the coaster trains became slightly dislodged and stopped abruptly on the tracks when it was above ground. A total of 27 passengers on board the ride were lowered to the ground by a lift from the back of a truck. There were no injuries, but some parts of the coaster's tracks were slightly damaged. After the ride was closed temporarily, a spokesperson claimed that the incident was reported as a freak occurrence. * On April 5, 1999, two trains collided, injuring seven people. ==Cedar Point Park-wide incidents === *On May 28, 2018, Cedar Point suffered a park-wide power failure, caused by a car hitting a nearby utility pole outside the park. Guests were stranded on multiple rides including Millennium Force in 90-degree heat, and it took up to two hours for power to be fully restored. No significant injuries were reported. ===Cedar Creek Mine Ride=== * On May 24, 1984, a 5-year-old boy suffered a fractured skull and bruises after falling from the train's front seat during its drop. The ride had a 48 inch height restriction when it opened in 1969, but this was later relaxed to 48 inches or accompanied by a parent, so the boy may have been too small to ride. The park reinstated the original 48 inch height restriction and added thicker lap bars after the incident. * On July 30, 1988, injuries were reported after an empty train was released from the station and collided with a train full of passengers stuck on the coaster's second lift hill. Twelve people filed lawsuits against the park, eight of them passengers and four of them parents.

After the death of his father in 1706, Ernst Ludwig inherited the duchy of Saxe-Meiningen jointly with his brother, Frederick Wilhelm, and his half-brother, Anton Ulrich. His father, in his will, had stipulated that the duchy never be divided and that it be governed jointly by his sons. The oldest brother, Ernst Ludwig, strove to establish autonomy for himself and his descendants. Immediately after the death of his father, Ernst Ludwig signed a contract with his brothers; in consideration of certain inducements, the brothers had to leave the government of the duchy in his hands. This introduction of primogeniture failed, however; his brothers managed to govern again after Ernst Ludwig's death, acting as guardians for his sons. Ernst Ludwig married Dorothea Marie of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg, his cousin in Gotha on 19 September 1704. They had five children: # Josef Bernhard (b. Meiningen, 27 May 1706 – d. Rome, 22 March 1724). # Friedrich August (b. Meiningen, 4 November 1707 – d. Meiningen, 25 December 1707). # Ernst Ludwig II, Duke of Saxe-Meiningen (b. Coburg, 8 August 1709 – d.

It was released on September 25, 2006 by Astralwerks Records. ==Recording== After the release of 2001's It's a Wonderful Life, Linkous slowly began recording the tracks that would become Dreamt for Light Years in the Belly of a Mountain at his Static King Studio in North Carolina. He would later tell an interviewer that his depression had stalled the creation of the album, stretching the recording process out to about five years.Chicago Sun-Times article: \\"Mark Linkous, Sparklehorse, R.I.P. .\\" In 2006, he told Pitchfork Media that many of the songs that made up Dreamt for Light Years' track listing were actually songs that had been cut from It's a Wonderful Life:Pitchfork Media article: \\"Sparklehorse - 2006 interview.\\" \\"Well, I'd quit working for a while and it started to get really difficult to live and pay the rent. So it was really getting down to the wire where I had to turn a record in. I had some stuff written that I didn't put on the last album, because they were just really pop songs. They felt like anachronisms on the last record. So I saved all these little pop songs.\\" After hearing 2004's The Grey Album, which mashed up Jay-Z's The Black Album and the Beatles' The White Album, Linkous invited the album's producer, Danger Mouse, to come to North Carolina and help him finish the tracks he had begun recording. Although it was Sparklehorse's first studio album in five years, approximately 25 minutes of the 55-minute-long record were released in some form previously, dating from the sessions for the It's a Wonderful Life album. \\"Ghost in the Sky\\" was originally released on the Japanese pressing of It's a Wonderful Life. \\"Shade and Honey\\" appeared on a joint 7\\" split-single with the Shins and Mates of State. \\"Shade and Honey\\" was also sung by the actor Alessandro Nivola in the 2002 film Laurel Canyon, and Nivola's version is also found on the soundtrack. \\"Morning Hollow\\" was previously found as the hidden bonus track on It's a Wonderful Life. The track \\"Dreamt for Lightyears in the Belly of a Mountain\\" was originally released in 2001 under the title \\"Maxine\\" on both the LP version of It's a Wonderful Life and on the Gold Day EP. \\"Ghost in the Sky,\\" \\"Don't Take My Sunshine Away,\\" and \\"Knives of Summertime\\" were released as singles in the weeks leading up to the release of the album. ==Album cover== The album cover was created by artist Robert Pokorny.

Salt River Canyon Past the Navajo Nation boundary, SR 77 becomes BIA Route 6 northbound towards Keams Canyon. Between Show Low and Globe, this highway is concurrent with U.S. Route 60. Its southernmost reaches were formerly part of U.S. Route 80 and U.S. Route 89, except for its terminal segment, the Miracle Mile segment of old Business 10 and State Route 84. ==Origin of the name of Tucson's Miracle Mile== Historic U.S. Route 80. Although it was thought for several years that Tucson's Miracle Mile derived its name from a June 1937 Arizona Highways magazine, historian David Leighton challenged this theory, in a February 23, 2015, article in the Arizona Daily Star newspaper. He explained that in 1936, real estate developer Stanley Williamson conceived the idea of creating a commercial center outside of the over-congested downtown retail district, in Tucson. His model for this business center was the Miracle Mile in Los Angeles, Calif. The one in L.A., was the idea of real estate agent A.W. Ross, who saw that the retail district in that city was overcrowded and, also saw that cars were becoming more common. He came up with the idea of buying farming land, along Wilshire Blvd., several miles out from downtown, with the belief that as more people bought automobiles they would be willing to drive farther, in order to avoid the lack of parking and congestion in the downtown area. While initially no one thought his idea would work, in time store after store came to his business center. The Miracle Mile eventually became one of Los Angeles' premier shopping districts. Ross originally called his business area, the Wilshire Boulevard Center, it was changed to the Miracle Mile in 1928. ==History== SR 77 was first designated on May 13, 1930. The highway originally ran from a junction with SR 73 in McNary to U.S. Route 66 (US 66) in Holbrook via Show Low. On June 20, 1938, the section of SR 77 between Show Low and McNary was decommissioned, following the completion of US 60 from Globe to Springerville through Show Low. SR 77 was then extended southwest along the brand new US 60 to Globe, followed by a further southeast extension along US 70 from Globe to Cutter at the San Carlos Indian Reservation. From Cutter, SR 77 was extended further south along a newly acquired state highway to a southern terminus with US 80/US 89 in Oracle Junction. At the time, both U.S. Highways made up the route between Tucson and Oracle Junction. US 80 was removed from the Tucson to Oracle Junction corridor in 1977, when the U.S. Highway was truncated to I-10 in Benson. On August 21, 1992, US 89 was truncated to US 180 in Flagstaff. At the same time, the northern Tucson section of State Business Route 10 (SR 10 Bus.) was decommissioned. SR 10 Bus. started at an intersection with I-10 and Miracle Mile, heading east on Miracle Mile to US 89, then followed US 89 south on Oracle to its terminus at a junction with US 89, I-10 and SR 19 Bus. in South Tucson, Arizona. SR 77 was immediately extended south along former US 89 down Oracle Road to Miracle Mile in Tucson, then extended west along Miracle Mile (which was part of the recently decommissioned SR 10 Bus.) to an interchange with I-10. While Miracle Mile and the northern part of Oracle Road were renumbered as an extension of SR 77, the remainder of SR 10 Bus. and US 89 between the intersection of Oracle Road and Miracle Mile and the interchange with I-10 and SR 19 Bus. were not given to another route and was retired as a state highway, being handed over to the city of Tucson on October 15, 1993. ==Junction listNotes=See also== * * ==External links== *SR 77 at Arizona Roads *David Leighton,\\"Street Smarts: Miracle Mile's roots include fancy stores, the Mexican revolution,\\" Arizona Daily Star, February 23, 2015 ==References== 077 1077 1077 Category:Transportation in Pima County, Arizona Category:Transportation in Pinal County, Arizona Category:Transportation in Gila County, Arizona Category:Transportation in Navajo County, Arizona Category:Transportation in Tucson, Arizona Category:Geography of the Navajo Nation Category:U.S. Route 80 Category:U.S. Route 89 Category:Interstate 10 ","title":"Arizona State Route 77"},{"id":"6203612","text":"Butler Township is one of the fourteen townships of Mercer County, Ohio, United States.

Rakin Fetuga created Mecca2Medina after leaving his previous rap group, Cash Crew in 1995. ==Goal== The group aims to make music which expresses their Islamic views and they also comment on social issues related to 'ghetto life'. They rap over a music style which uses African drum rhythms aimed at conservative Islamic audiences. And for real hip-hop fans they use soulful rhythms and electronic beats. The first members to join Fetuga were Ismael Lea South and Imran Kazi. Later Doaud Saifallah and Abdul Kareem Talib joined. All of the members converted to Islam apart from Kazi who was born as a Muslim. All five are married with children. As a group of five Mecca2Medina (M2M) performed at many Islamic events around the United Kingdom. ==Range== Many non-Muslim community organisations also invite them to perform at events. The group contains youth workers Saifallah and South, a social worker Talib, a teacher Fetuga and a civil servant Kazi, these qualifications led the group to do many workshops around the country with disaffected young people and prisoners. The first member to leave the group was Doaud Saifallah. He now works with the youth and is also doing solo Islamic rap music. Kazi was next to leave and now has formed a duo called 'The Planets'. The remaining trio went on for many years and travelled outside of the UK to many countries including Nigeria, USA, France and The Republic of Ireland. ==Events== They also are community event organizers and use the name 'The Salam Project'. They have organised grassroots events in the community such as talks with prominent Islamic scholars such as Sheikh Abdul Hakim Quick, Shaykh Ahmed Ba'biker Abu Bakr As-Sudani and Sheikh Michael Mumisa. They also have organised Muslim Comedy events with comedians such as Prince Abdi and Jeff Mirza. Along with comedy events they also arrange many tours around the country with the influx of new Islamic rap artists. They have worked with many new artists including with The Blind Alphabets and Mohammed Yahya, Missundastood of the US, Poetic Pilgrimage, Pearls of Islam, Masika Feesibillah and Muslim Belal. They have collaborated on Malaysian group Raihan's album. Abdul Kareem Talib was the third member to leave the group leaving the duo Fetuga and South.

It was notified in 1971. The designated area consists mainly of chalk grassland, as well as some ancient woodland, and supports a diverse range of native flora and fauna. It overlays notable geological features—principally landforms created by glaciation in the Pleistocene. ==Location== The Bratton Downs SSSI includes parts of the Westbury, Combe, White Cliff, Picquet, Patcombe and Edington Hills, as well as the Combe Bottom, Longcombe Bottom and Lutcombe Bottom combes. The Wessex Ridgeway long-distance footpath passes through part of the SSSI. The Westbury White Horse is located on Westbury Hill on the edge of Bratton Downs. Bratton Camp, an Iron Age hill fort, stands on a top immediately east of the horse; the fort is surrounded by the designated area but does not form part of it. ==Vegetation== The main species of grass is upright brome (Bromus erectus), though tor-grass (Brachypodium pinnatum) is also common. In areas of heavy grazing, sheep fescue (Festuca ovina) and meadow oat-grass (Helictotrichon pratense) can take over. Blue sedge (Carex flacca), spring sedge (Carex caryophyllea), dwarf thistle (Cirsium acaule), salad burnet (Sanguisorba minor), burnet saxifrage (Pimpinella saxifraga), and devil’s bit (Succisa pratensis) are also common. Common sainfoin (Onobrychis viciifolia), fern-leaf dropwort (Filipendula vulgaris), autumn lady's-tresses (Spiranthes spiralis), chalk milkwort (Polygala calcarea) and fragrant orchid (Gymnadenia conopsea) are notable grassland species that only grow in areas where fertilisers and herbicides have not been used for a long time. Patches of scrub with emergent tree species have developed on slopes, common components of which are hawthorn (Crataegus sp.), buckthorn (Rhamnus spp.), blackthorn (Prunus spinosa), common holly (Ilex aquifolium), wayfaring tree (Viburnum lantana), ash (Fraxinus excelsior), whitebeam and field maple (Acer campestre). Ash and wych elm (Ulmus glabra) form two stands on north-facing slopes on the eastern margins of the downs. The ground cover in these woods contains several species typical of those found in ancient woodland. Duke of Burgundy butterfly ==Fauna== Notable bird species reported in the downs include the lesser whitethroat, common linnet, yellowhammer, goldcrest and European green woodpecker. More than thirty species of butterfly have been reported from the area, several of which—the marsh fritillary (Euphydryas aurinia), Duke of Burgundy (Hamearis lucina), chalkhill blue (Polyommatus coridon), pearl-bordered fritillary (Boloria euphrosyne) and Adonis blue (Polyommatus bellargus)—are declining in the United Kingdom on account of habitat destruction. Other insects reported include the uncommon burrowing bug species Canthophorus dubius, the green forester (Adscita statices), cistus forester (A. geryon), and scarce forester (Jordanita globulariae). ==References== Category:Sites of Special Scientific Interest in Wiltshire Category:Sites of Special Scientific Interest notified in 1971 Category:Hills of Wiltshire Category:Bratton, Wiltshire ","title":"Bratton Downs"},{"id":"6203672","text":"Jefferson Township is one of the fourteen townships of Mercer County, Ohio, United States.

Atlanta, GA Hammer and Nails sculpture, 1977. Hans Godo Frabel (born 1941 in Jena, East Germany) is an East German–born lampwork glass blower, now living and working in the US. ==Biography== Hans Godo Frabel is one of the first lampwork glass artists in the world. He turned the technique of \\"working at the lamp\\" to an art form back in 1968, when he opened the Frabel Studio in Atlanta, Georgia.Frabel:Glass Art in Nature, 2007, p. 11Tanguy, 2002, p. 46 At that time crystal glass was not considered a serious art medium and few artists were utilizing the beauty and diversity of glass to create unique art pieces.Phillips, 1973, p. 483 Frabel was the third child in a family with five children. The tumultuous political climate after World War II necessitated a family migration to West Germany. After living in several different cities, Frabel began to look at glass as a means to a career at the age of 15. He obtained a traineeship as a scientific glassblower at the prestigious Jena Glaswerke in Mainz, West Germany, and earned the degree of journeyman in 1959.op de Ese, 2007, p. 1 In 1965 he came to the United States and settled in Atlanta. There he obtained a position at the Georgia Institute of Technology in their scientific glass blowing laboratory. During this time he continued his studies of glass as an art form at Emory University and Georgia State.op de Ese, 2007, pp. 1–3 While working at Georgia Tech, Frabel created crystal glass sculptures as gifts for friends, partners and business associates, inspiring him to become a full-time artist. Over the next 40 years he followed the European tradition of apprentice and master. As the master artist he passed his skills on to a handpicked group of apprentices and associates, who after many years of training, became master artists in their own right. \\"Although Frabel’s art received much attention in the Atlanta area, his international breakthrough as a glass artist was not recognized until 1978 when his pop art sculpture “Hammer and Nails” was utilized as the main (feature) piece of the New Glass Art Exhibition\\"New Glass, 1979, p. 83 For the next few years the exhibition toured the world visiting museums in major cities. The Hammer and Nails can now be found in the permanent collection of the National Building Museum in Washington D.C.op de Ese, 2007, p.I Frabel’s work embodies a host of mixed expressions, which find their voice in the enormous diversity of his art.Lewis, 1996, p. 73 His rapid exhaustion of any given subject matter and his sudden interest in a new field have given him the reputation of impetuosity in the field of torch-worked glass art. His unusual precision at the torch, developed through the rigor of the master craftsman system of Germany, has earned him the nickname \\"Machine Hands.\\" Over the years Frabel’s reputation as a master in glass art has spread worldwide beyond the glass community. \\"Frabel art pieces can be found in public and private collections in over 80 countries worldwide.\\"op de Ese, 2007, p. 90Frabel: Glass Art in Nature, 2007, p. 13 Some famous collectors of Frabel glass art include Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom, the Emperor and Empress of Japan, current and former heads of governments such as Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, Margaret Thatcher, Anwar Sadat as well as museums in London, Paris, Tokyo, Dresden, Valencia, Corning, San Francisco, New York and Washington D.C.op de Ese, 2007, pp. 88–103 \\"Until the mid nineties the Frabel Studio created art pieces almost exclusively in clear borosilicate – a strong, brilliant crystal that is resistant to scratches and which if broken can usually be restored without a trace of damage.\\" In the early 1990s the Frabel Studio explored the use of color which has been part of its art collection ever since. \\"Other techniques the Studio employs are sandblasting and painting.

It was created by Meitoku Yagi, a student of Gojyu-ryu's founder, Chojun Miyagi. Meibukan means \\"House of the pure-minded warrior.\\" Yagi opened the first Meibukan dojo in 1952. He was the first student of Miyagi recorded to be given permission. He was given the calligraphy (Oku myo zai ren shin). Yagi is the recognised Menkyo Kaiden of the Gojyu-ryu style as he was the recipient of Miyagi's gi and obi in 1963. Meibu-kai karateka practice Gojyu-ryu kata as well as a set of kata known as the Meibu-ken kata. ==Meibukan Gojyu-ryu SyllabusKihon Kata=== *Sanchin *Tensho ===Kaishu Kata=== *Geki Sai Ichi *Geki Sai Ni *Saifa *Shisochin *Sanseryu *Seisan *Seienchin *Sepai *Kururunfa *Suparinpe ===Heishu Kata=== *Sanpo Aruite Tensho ===Meibuken Kata=== *Tenchi *Seiryu *Byakko *Shujaku *Genbu Tenchi’s name is taken from the first line in a poem in the Bubishi, \\"Jin shin wa Tenchi ni Onaji.\\" This means \\"the mind is one with heaven and earth.\\" Originally, Tenchi was composed of two kata, Fukyu kata ichi and Fukyu kata ni. They were eventually combined, and now Ten no kata represents the first half, while Chi no kata is the second half. The kata are named after Chinese constellations: Seiryu means azure dragon, Byakko means white tiger, Shujaku means vermillion bird and Genbu means black turtle. Meitoku Yagi got the idea after seeing these names bannered on war flags during the Tsuna-Hiki (Tug of War Festival) held each year in Naha. ===Other Kata=== As well, Taikyoku patterns are practiced. They can be done alone; as well as with a partner (Renzoku kumite), which is done in a straight-line pattern; or with three or five people altogether (Kakomi kumite), in which one karateka is surrounded by the others. There are no traditional Meibukan weapons forms; however, Yagi did adapt some Meibuken Kaishu kata to bō and sai, and are commonly referred to as Meibuken Kobudo. They are as follows. *Geki Sai Ichi Bo *Geki Sai Ni Bo *Saifa Bo *Geki Sai Ichi Sai *Geki Sai Ni Sai *Saifa Sai *Shisochin Sai ===Kumite=== In Meibukan style of Goju-ryu, dojos practice forms of Yakusoku Kumite only. Yakusoku Kumite means pre-arranged sparring. There is no practice of Jiyu Kumite or free sparring. There has never been free fighting in classical Okinawan Gojyu-ryu. In Jiyu Kumite, Karate becomes a sport, and classical Karate is not a sport. Okinawans practice Karate-do, meaning the way of the empty hand. Also Jiyu Kumite can hinder the development of good Karate techniques, especially in Okinawan Gojyu-ryu, where the emphasis is ending the fight with one devastating technique (Hito Tsuki). ==IMGKA and the Hombu Dojo== Currently, Yagi's eldest son, Meitatsu, is Chairman of the IMGKA (International Meibukan Goju-Ryu Karate Association) and travels the world frequently. Presently he is the most senior active Meibukai student of Meitoku Yagi. There are branches in Australia, Canada, United States, England, India, Iran, Philippines, Russia, Georgia, Brazil, Israel and Hong Kong. Meitatsu Sensei universally conveys the philosophical message that some teachers of budo in the world teach how to fight, we of Meibukai rather teach how not to fight. In other words, Meibukai does not practice the emphasis of how to win but rather how not to lose. The Meibukan Hombu Dojo was founded by Meitoku Yagi in 1952 prior to the death of Gojyu-Ryu founder, Miyagi Chojun. Since then, the Meibukan Hombu Dojo has been an integral part of Okinawa Karate. Yagi was a founding father of the Okinawa Goju-kai and All Okinawa Karate-do Association both of which the Meibukan Hombu Dojo has been actively a part of since their formation. While Yagi was alive, he appointed international representatives that are still practicing Meibukan today and are still recognized by the Meibukan Hombu Dojo. These representatives are Shiki Tadanori of Ibaraki, Japan, Anthony Mirakian of USA, Yonamine Yasunori of South America, Rajesh Thakkar of India, and Cristofi Clemente of Australia. Note, however, that Johannes Wong was also a long-serving student and instructor of Gojyu-Ryu Meibukan directly under Yagi since the mid-1980s in Australia. The Meibukan Hombu dojo also has satellite branches in Okinawa, Japan that includes Matsugawa, Tsukayama, Naha, Tsuji, Kume, and Nagata. Yagi's second son, Meitetsu, currently is president and head instructor of the Meibukan Hombu Dojo in Naha, Okinawa and has traveled the world. He has been invited to India, Hawaii, Australia, and USA to share his knowledge of Meibukan. The Meibukan Hombu Dojo maintains an important role in keeping Yagi's legacy alive through the participation and support of the Okinawa Goju- kai and the All Okinawa Karate-do Association. ==Difference== There are four suffixes to \\"Meibu\\" used: kan, kai, ka, and ken. Meibukan is the \\"house of the pure-minded warrior.\\" This refers the style of karate practiced. Meibukai is the association. Meibuka describes a karateka practicing Meibukan. Meibuken is, roughly translated, the \\"law (or fist) of the pure-minded warrior.\\" The last one is used in association with the kata. ==Meanings of Meibukan== The Meibukan crest is the kanji \\"mei,\\" which is the first kanji in the first names of Yagi and his two sons. Meitatsu’s two sons, Akihito and Akihiro also share the kanji. The following are three interpretations of the crest. *The kanji mei is a combination of the kanji for sun and the kanji for moon. Using them as separate kanji, you can say \\"hi to tsuki,\\" which literally means \\"sun and moon.\\" However, by this pronunciation, it can be interpreted as an expression meaning \\"one punch.\\" The idea is that a karateka must train with the mindset that he or she may only have one opportunity to end a conflict—the karateka must train seriously and with a sharp mind. *The kanji represent the dualities of nature. The moon is slender, flexible and always changing in the sky. The sun is thick and constant. These ideas are physically represented in the crest—the sun half of the kanji is much thicker than the moon. A karateka must be both like the sun—able to stand ground and be strong—and the moon—be adaptable and soft. *\\"Ah\\" and \\"Um.\\" Again, two dualities. Um represents defensive nature. When one inhales one must relax and be prepared. Inhaling is for conserving energy and being ready to receive an attack. Ah is the other side of the coin. Exhaling represents attacking, tension and release of breath. There are several maxims used in Meibukan—some are particular to the style, while others are common to other styles of Gojyu-ryu and karate. The following are some of the more common sayings. *Oku myo zai ren shin. \\"Practice with a good heart.\\" *Oku myo zai hyaku ren sen tan. \\"Train a hundred times, train a thousand times.\\" *Nangi go gokui. \\"The secrets of training are revealed through hard work.\\" *Ryu su fu sen kyo. \\"Running water in a stream faces no barriers.\\" *Kan chiku fu sho. \\"The pine tree bends in the wind. The bamboo is hard in the cold.\\" ==See also== * https://web.archive.org/web/20171107015822/http://www.imgka.com/ * https://www.meibukanyagidojo.com/ * http://www.meibukankaratedojo.com Category:Gōjū-ryū ","title":"Meibukan"},{"id":"6203766","text":"The Neilson House is a historic house located on CR 234 in Windsor, Florida.

In 1947, it was renamed Svetly. Town status was granted to it in 1955. The first mention of its predecessor settlement dates back to the 15th-century Tsimmerbude chronicle German knight of the Order. But earlier, in Fishhauzen manuscript 1305 and (Germany), mention of the peninsula Payziev (\\"Poyzart\\" - the area in the forest Poyz), by which in the first half of the 13th century German knights invaded the land Prussians.

In 1669 at the manor was given to the former tutor of King Frederick I Ebenhard Dankelman background as a reward. In about 1720 and Tsimmerbude included, along with 16 plots of land, 12 peasants and about the same number of fishermen whose main occupation was fishing, mainly for their own needs. After the castle ceased to exist for a long time villagers eked out a miserable existence of subsistence by fishing. Apart from a few acidified meadows they had no land, and therefore almost never held cattle. Their home were extremely cramped and dirty, smoke coming out of the centers through kamyshoyve roof sagged and a thick layer of soot on the walls through the kitchen. Long winter evenings in the huts burning torch, making the faces of the inhabitants were constantly black. Clothes spun, wove, and sewed himself. This adds another life flood, which were repeated from year to year. Religion occupied an important role in village life: conducting religious rites, services, etc. For a long time there was no Tsimmerbude in his church and the village belonged to the parish church Medena (Logvino). But because of bad roads to visit the church in Medena villagers could only a few times in my life, there was baptized children, married, went on the biggest holidays in good weather.

The mudbrick structure was revived by Egyptian architect Hassan Fathy after re-discovering the technique in the Nubian village of Abu al-Riche. The technology is advocated by environmentalists as environmentally friendly and sustainable since it makes use of pure earth without the need of timber.Swan, Simone.Elegant Solutions. Saudi Aramco World, July/August 1999, Volume 50, Number 4. The technology is of Nubian origin. The classical definition of the contour of the Nubian vault is that obtained when a chain is held up at its two ends. The vault is more or less open or wide depending on how far apart the two chain ends are held. One of the key advantages of the Nubian vault is that it can be built without any support or shuttering. The earth bricks are laid leaning at a slight slope against the gable walls in a length-wise vault, as in this photo of a building from the ruins of Ayn Asil in Egypt. The same principle can be used to build domes, as in the example below from Cameroon. The age-old Nubian vault technique was notably revived by the Egyptian architect Hassan Fathy in the 1940s with the building of a new village at Gourna, near Luxor. Architecturally, this village is a singular success; however, the families who were moved there soon abandoned it to return to their original village. Musgum, in the Far North Province of Cameroon More recently, since the year 2000, a French /Burkinabé NGO La Voûte Nubienne, by simplifying and codifying the VN (Voûte Nubienne) technique, has promoted the construction of over 1600 vaulted buildings in Burkina Faso, Mali, and Senegal (mainly village homes, but also a Catholic church, several mosques, schools, literacy centres, and a dispensary). These environmentally sound, comfortable, and aesthetic buildings require neither imported sheet metal for the roofing, nor expensive and increasingly rare timber beams. Over 260 masons have been trained in the technique, and there are as many apprentices currently undergoing on-the-job training on building sites (2012). The programme organised by the Association \\"Earth roofs for the Sahel\\" is experiencing around 30% year on year growth in response to demand from rural families, with many requests for help and technical advice coming from the countries of the Sahel, and from further afield (a programme was launched in Zambia in early 2009, under the aegis of AVN-Belgium). ==See also== *Nubian architecture *List of architectural vaults *Catenary arch *Inverted catenary arch *Taq Kasra ==Literature== Architecture for the Poor by Hasan Fathy - online pdf: http://www.arvindguptatoys.com/arvindgupta/fathy.pdf *Google Books: Building with Earth ==References== This article is based on a translation of the corresponding article from the French Wikipedia, retrieved on July 31, 2006.

He was the eldest son of Ernest, Duke of Saxe-Hildburghausen and Countess Sophie Henriette of Waldeck. During his youth he served on the Netherlands in the imperial military army, during which he was wounded in the Spanish Succession War at Höchstädt; in 1715 he left the Army after the death of his father, and assumed the government of the duchy of Saxe-Hildburghausen. He wanted, like many German princes, to repeat the splendor of the court of the King Louis XIV of France in his own duchy; but this was the cause of his financial ruin. Constantly in need of money, he levied taxes and sold towns. Among them was the county of Cuylenburg, the dowry of his wife. The county was sold in 1720 to the General States, not for the repayment of the debts but to build in his palace a garden connected with a channel. Likewise, in 1723 the office was finally sold to the duchy of Saxe-Meiningen. But the sale, without the assent of his wife was illegal, and this led to a war with Saxe-Meiningen. The county was occupied with troops of both duchies and at the end of the war all of the county was devastated and ruined. Because of his intolerable fiscal charges, in 1717 an open revolt developed in the duchy. ==Marriage and issue== In Erbach on 4 February 1704, Ernest Frederick married Countess Sophia Albertine of Erbach-Erbach.

As a child, he lived in Thailand, Singapore, Puerto Rico, and Australia. After returning to the United States as a teenager, he lived in San Martin, California and attended Palma High School in Salinas. He entered high school rodeos starting in his sophomore year. In 2012, Rob Smets starred in Jägermeister's \\"A Stronger Bond\\" television and digital campaign. ==Career== While bull riding as a teenager, Smets taunted some of the bullfighters for not protecting riders well enough after the riders fell. They challenged him to try being a bullfighter himself, which he did. He made a name for himself early on, distracting bulls after riders had fallen, so the riders could leave the ring safely. During the 19 years of the Wrangler National Finals Rodeo World Bullfighting Championship from 1981–2000, Smets was a top-6 finisher 17 times. He also won the championship 5 times, a record. He is a 9-time PBR World Championships Bullfighter. Rob was inducted into the ProRodeo Hall of Fame in 2006. He was inducted into the Texas Rodeo Cowboy Hall of Fame in April 2010. Also, he was the inaugural recipient of the Professional Bull Rider Heroes and Legends Celebration: Jim Shoulders Lifetime Achievement Award in 2011. In 2017, Rob was inducted into the Bull Riding Hall of Fame in the Bull Fighters category. Lately, Smets has turned stock contractor, although he only owns one bull. But that one bull is a highly ranked PBR bucking bull, #80 Jeremiah. The bull's full name is Jeremiah 33:3 for the bible verse. Jeremiah is 49-2 at all levels of the PBR as of September 2017. Jeremiah has been bucking on the PBR since 2013 and since 2015 he's been bucking on the elite Built Ford Tough Series (BFTS) circuit. In 2015, Jeremiah was chosen as a world champion bull contender at the 2015 PBR BFTS World Finals. ==Injuries== During his bullfighting career, Smets was injured many times, including suffering a broken neck three times, in 1992, 1996, and 2006. Although these injuries often paralyze people who suffer them, Smets' main problem from them is limited motion in his neck. He retired from bullfighting in 2006, after breaking his neck for the third time. Smets has also been gored by a bull's horn and has broken a leg. ==Personal== Smets and his wife, Carla, married in 1993, and they have four daughters, Corey, Dylan, Josie, and Sammy.

The freeway, originally a two-lane rural highway, was maintained by Maricopa County in central Arizona serving the far western suburbs of the Phoenix metropolitan area until 2004 when the Arizona Department of Transportation again took control of upgrading the interim road to a freeway. In 2004, it was renamed \\"Bob Stump Memorial Parkway\\" to honor former Arizona congressman Bob Stump. Its route runs from West Van Buren Street in Goodyear to Interstate 17 south of Carefree Highway. , Loop 303 is a full freeway from just south of I-10 to I-17. == Route description == Loop 303 currently begins at Van Buren Street, south of I-10 in Goodyear and at I-10 becomes a six-lane freeway with a stack interchange. South of Van Buren Street it continues as Cotton Lane but without a route number. It heads north under McDowell and Thomas Roads, then over an interchange with Indian School Road. The road heads through a farmland terrain and passes the Wildlife World Zoo near Northern Avenue. It over passes a BNSF Railway spur line near Olive Avenue. At an interchange with Greenway Road, Route 303 enters a residential community and turns northeast. The route heads over a bridge above Grand Avenue (US 60) along with another BNSF railroad line. The route turns eastward and was recently upgraded to a six-lane freeway. It turns north near the Happy Valley Parkway interchange and then east again south of Lake Pleasant, passing through planned arterial interchanges. The freeway comes to an end at a temporary at-grade interchange (eventually to be a stack interchange) with I-17 near Skunk Creek. East of this interchange, Route 303 becomes Sonoran Desert Drive. The south end from US 60 to I-10 is frequently used to bypass Grand Avenue and quickly move from Grand Avenue to Bell Road. ==History== Old colored Arizona Loop 303 shield that has been phased out.Loop 303 was originally a part of the 1985 Maricopa County Regional Transportation Plan that was funded by a sales tax approved by Maricopa County voters. The freeway, designed to service the Northwest Valley, was originally designated SR 517 in 1985; the Loop 303 designation was first assigned on December 18, 1987. The freeway was scheduled to be completed sometime by 2005. However, funding shortfalls and increasing construction costs forced cutbacks in the plan, and in 1995 the freeway was dropped from the regional plans. Maricopa County took charge of what was then called the Estrella Freeway project when it was dropped from the regional freeway plans, maintaining it as an interim 2-lane highway along the original corridor while keeping the state route designation. The county then made significant improvements to the roadway, extending it several miles north and east of US 60. While the highway was still largely a 2-lane rural road, the extension north of US 60 along with the southern terminus just north of Interstate 10 was upgraded to a 4-lane divided parkway, and the segment between US 60 and Bell Road in Surprise was partially upgraded to controlled-highway standards with overpasses and right-of-way for on-ramps. With the extension of the sales tax approved in 2004, the highway was once again added to the Regional Transportation Plan. As Maricopa County had completed much of the required study and preparation work, construction on the freeway proceeded with a planned completion date of the I-10 to I-17 segment by 2015. According to an agreement between the state legislature and the state department of transportation, STAN (Statewide Transportation Acceleration Needs) funds were used to build a partial interchange at Bell Road in summer 2010, several years before previously intended. In mid-2011 the segment between Happy Valley Parkway and I-17 was completed as a four-lane highway with an interchange at Lone Mountain Parkway completed but initially closed to the public. Motorists still have to pass through signaled ramp junctions at the I-17 Black Canyon Freeway until a full stack interchange is built between that route and Loop 303. ==Future== Long-term plans call for the extension of Loop 303 south of the interchange with I-10 in Goodyear to the planned I-10 'Reliever Route' Freeway, SR 30, and continuing south through Goodyear to connect with the planned alignment of future Interstate 11. Loop 303 would run concurrent with I-11 for several miles, before splitting off southward towards its ultimate terminus at Interstate 8 west of Casa Grande. Construction of this extension is expected to begin in Fall 2020. If completed, Loop 303 will serve as a Phoenix bypass route for the southwestern suburbs of Goodyear, Avondale, and Buckeye as well as an alternate Phoenix bypass route for I-10 traffic headed westbound to the Greater Los Angeles Area and northbound via I-17 to Flagstaff. In response to a projected budget shortfall of $6.6 billion brought on by the recession, the Maricopa Association of Governments voted to suspend funding to numerous projects during a meeting on October 28, 2009. Some modifications to Route 303, such as a scaled-back design of its interchanges with I-10 and US Highway 60, were made to cope with the budget shortfall. Funding for the extension south of I-10 to the planned alignment of SR 30 was removed, effectively postponing the extension until after 2025. ==Exit listSee also== * * * Metropolitan Phoenix Freeways * Loop 101 * Loop 202 ==References * 303 303 Category:Transportation in Maricopa County, Arizona ","title":"Arizona State Route 303"},{"id":"6203937","text":"In educational statistics, a normal curve equivalent (NCE), developed for the United States Department of Education by the RMC Research Corporation,Mertler, C.

(p. 3) is a way of standardizing scores received on a test into a 0-100 scale similar to a percentile-rank, but preserving the valuable equal-interval properties of a z-score. It is defined as: : 70770 + /qnorm(.99) × z or, approximately : 50 + 21.063 × z, where z is the standard score or \\"z-score\\", i.e. z is how many standard deviations above the mean the raw score is (z is negative if the raw score is below the mean). The reason for the choice of the number 21.06 is to bring about the following result: If the scores are normally distributed (i.e. they follow the \\"bell-shaped curve\\") then * the normal equivalent score is 99 if the percentile rank of the raw score is 99; * the normal equivalent score is 50 if the percentile rank of the raw score is 50; * the normal equivalent score is 1 if the percentile rank of the raw score is 1\\\\. This relationship between normal equivalent scores and percentile ranks does not hold at values other than 1, 50, and 99\\\\. It also fails to hold in general if scores are not normally distributed. The number 21.06 was chosen because * It is desired that a score of 99 correspond to the 99th percentile; * The 99th percentile in a normal distribution is 2.3263 standard deviations above the mean; * 99 is 49 more than 50--thus 49 points above the mean; * 49/2.3263 = 21.06. Normal curve equivalents are on an equal-interval scale. This is advantageous compared to percentile rank scales, which suffer from the problem that the difference between any two scores is not the same as that between any other two scores (see below or percentile rank for more information). The major advantage of NCEs over percentile ranks is that NCEs can be legitimately averaged.Rochester School Department webpage ==Caution== Careful consideration is required when computing effect sizes using NCEs. NCEs differ from other scores, such as raw and scaled scores, in the magnitude of the effect sizes. Comparison of NCEs typically results in smaller effect sizes, and using the typical ranges for other effect sizes may result in interpretation errors.McLean, J. E., O'Neal, M. R., & Barnette, J. J.

It is located about 6 km south west of the town of Brugg. On 1 January 2014 the former municipalities of Oberflachs and Schinznach-Dorf merged into the new municipality of Schinznach.Nomenklaturen – Amtliches Gemeindeverzeichnis der Schweiz accessed 13 December 2014 ==History== Aerial view (1953) While various Roman era bricks and coins have been discovered, the first record of Oberflachs is in 1342 as Obreflaht. From the Middle Ages until 1732, Kasteln Castle held the rights to low justice in the village. The rights to administer High Justice was held by the bailiwick of Schenkenberg and was acquired in 1460 by the city of Bern. In 1732 the village came fully under Bern's authority when Bern bought the Kasteln Castle. By 1607 the village is identified as a partly independent municipality. Oberflachs was, like the whole Schenkenbergertal in the 18th Century, a very poor municipality. Grain and vineyard cultivation were the major economic sources in the 17th Century. However, in 1850 wine production collapsed because of vine diseases and phylloxera. The poverty and collapse of the wine industry forced many residents (particularly in the 1880s) to emigrate overseas. The wine recovered, so that in 1990 there were 22 hectares cultivated. In the 1970s several new housing districts were built. In 1960, the number of commuters exceeded the number of locals that worked in the municipality. In 2005, agriculture provided 28% of the jobs in the community. A merger of Oberflachs with four municipalities failed in 2009 because Veltheim voters rejected the proposal. ==Geography== Kasteln castle Before the merger, Oberflachs had a total area of . Of this area, or 54.4% is used for agricultural purposes, while or 37.6% is forested.

It tends to inhabit open woodland, grassland and arid regions, shunning dense forest. It is a near relative of both the Palearctic booted eagle and the massive but now extinct Haast's eagle of New Zealand. ==Taxonomy== Foot bones of the little eagle (bottom) and those of the Haast's eagle. John Gould described the little eagle in 1841. The distinctive pygmy eagle has long been considered a subspecies, but a 2009 genetic study shows it to be distinctive genetically and warrants species status. ==Description== Barrett, et al. (2003), describes the little eagle as a medium-sized bird of prey, between 45 and 55 cm in length. The little eagle is small and stocky with a broad head. It has fully feathered legs and a square-cut, barred tail. Wingspan is about 120 cm with males having longer wings in proportion to their bodies, but being nearly half the weight of females. It is a powerful bird and during flight has strong wing beats, glides on flat wings and soars on slightly raised or flat wings (Marchant and Higgins 1993; Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001; Olsen and Fuentes 2004; Debus 1998). The little eagle occurs in light and dark colour forms and generally these colours change with age. The most common is the light form which is dark brown occurring on the back and wings with black streaks on the head and neck, and a sandy to pale under body. The dark form of this eagle is similar except the head and under body is usually darker brown or rich rufous. The sexes are similar with females being larger and typically darker. Juveniles are similar to adults but tend to be more strongly rufous in colour with less contrast in patterns (Marchant and Higgins 1993; Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001; Olsen and Fuentes 2004; Debus 1998). ==Distribution and abundance== Although the little eagle has a large range and can be found in most parts of Australia, except heavily forested parts of the Great Dividing Range (Marchant and Higgins, 1993). Like so many Australian natives, it faces a deteriorating population due to a loss of habitat and competition from other species. One of the biggest factors to the decline of the little eagle is the decline of rabbits due to the release of the calicivirus, the eagle relied heavily on the rabbit population due to the extinction and massive decline of native terrestrial mammals of rabbit size or smaller such as large rodents, bandicoots, bettongs, juvenile banded hare-wallaby and other wallabies (Sharp et al. 2002). In the first national bird atlas in 1977–81, the little eagle was reported in 65% of one degree grid cells across Australia, with mostly high reporting rates (more than 40% of surveys per grid) across New South Wales and Victoria. Breeding was recorded in 11% of cells, with the highest rates in New South Wales (NSW) and Victoria (Blakers et al. 1984). During the second national bird atlas in 1998–2002, the little eagle was recorded in 59% of grid cells, at mostly low reporting rates (recorded in less than 20% of surveys per grid). Breeding was recorded in 5% of grid cells (Barrett et al. 2003, 2007). Overall, there has been a national decline in reporting rate of 14%. In NSW over the last 20 years (two little eagle generations) the decline in reporting rate has been 39%, and over the past 30 years has been 50%, with an accelerating trend since the 1990s (Bounds 2008). The decline in reporting rate over the past 20 years for the South Eastern Highlands bioregion has been greater than 20% (Barrett et al. 2003, 2007). This bioregion includes the ACT. The little eagle was once common in the ACT (Olsen and Fuentes 2004) but has undergone significant decline (greater than 70%) over the last 20 years. In the late 1980s there was an estimated 13 breeding pairs in the ACT. The species occurred mainly in the northern half of the ACT with the highest concentrations found in the Murrumbidgee and the Molonglo river corridors (Taylor and COG 1992). By 2005 the only breeding record in the ACT was of an unsuccessful nest near Uriarra Crossing (Olsen and Fuentes 2005). A more intensive ACT survey in 2007 found three breeding pairs, which fledged a total of four young (Olsen et al. 2008). In 2008 four breeding pairs were recorded and four young were fledged (Olsen et al. 2009). In 2009, three breeding pairs were recorded with three young being fledged (Olsen et al. 2010). Typical habitat for the little eagle includes woodland or open forest. Higher abundance of the species is associated with hillsides where there is a mixture of wooded and open areas such as riparian woodlands, forest margins and wooded farmland. Little eagles usually avoid large areas of dense forest, preferring to hunt in open woodland, where the birds use trees for lookouts (Marchant and Higgins 1993; Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). In the ACT, little eagles inhabit frequent open woodland and riparian areas (Olsen and Fuentes 2004). ==Conservation status== The little eagle was declared as ‘Vulnerable’ in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) “under Section 38 of the Nature Conservation Act 1980”. It was also listed as ‘Vulnerable’ in New South Wales (NSW) in Part 1 of Schedule 2 of “the NSW Threatened Species Conservation Act 1995” and Gazetted on 12 February 2012. The little eagle is listed on the IUCN Red List as of least concern. Reasons for it being classified as 'least concern' are that the bird of prey has a huge range, spanning up to 20,000km2 and the population size is only decreasing at a rate of 10% per ten years or 3 generations, instead of the required 30%. The Red List amended the status of the little eagle from \\"Not Recognized\\" in 2006 to \\"Least Concern\\". Also, the NSW Scientific Committee has made the determination to list the little eagle as a Vulnerable species under the Vulnerable species listing. The reasons for this listing is the reduction of habitat quality or diversity and genetic diversity. ==Ecology and behaviourReproduction=== Little eagles nest in open woodland (usually on hillsides) and along tree-lined watercourses, with the nest typically placed in a mature, living tree. The birds build a stick nest lined with leaves and may use different nests in successive years, including those of other birds such as crows. A pair of little eagles will only reproduce once a year and each pair will only produce one or two eggs per season, usually laid in late August to early September (Marchant and Higgins 1993). After an incubation period of about 37 days, one or two young are fledged after approximately eight weeks (Olsen and Fuentes 2004; Debus et al. 2007; Debus and Ley 2009). Maturity in terms of breeding takes two to three years, leaving a large population of juvenile eagles, mature eagles constitute roughly less than three-quarters of the population (Ferguson-Lees and Christie, 2001). Little eagle nesting territories are defended against intruders and advertised by soaring, undulating flight display, conspicuous perching and/or calling (Marchant and Higgins 1993; Debus et al. 2007; Bounds 2008). Movement behaviour varies between individuals, and may be partly migratory (being an altitudinal migrant), dispersive or permanently resident (Marchant and Higgins 1993). They tend to slip away at the first sign of human intrusion (Ferguson-lee and Christie 2001). ===Prey=== Little eagles hunt live prey and occasionally take carrion. The eagles search for prey by soaring, up to altitude, or by using an elevated exposed perch. The species is an agile, fast hunter swooping to take prey on the ground in the open but also from trees and shrubs (Marchant and Higgins 1993; Olsen et al. 2006; Debus et al. 2007; Debus and Ley 2009). Recorded prey species (from feeding observations, nest remains and faecal pellets) show considerable variation indicating a broad diet, which seems to be determined primarily by the availability of prey of a suitable size. The little eagle would originally feed on small birds, mammals and reptiles and supplement its diet with large insects on occasion, however with the introduction of rabbits and foxes the little eagle's diet changed. Rabbits became widely abundant very quickly after being introduced, competing for habitat with native mammals. The introduction of foxes can also be attributed to the decline of the little eagle's main source of prey. The rabbit however is an ideal source of prey also, and so the rabbit population became the little eagle's main diet until the release of the calicivirus which decreased the rabbit population from between 65 and 85% in arid and semi-arid areas (Sharp et al. 2002). Debus (1998) notes that their diet varies geographically; the diet in Northern Australia has a high proportion of birds, in the arid zone is mostly lizards, and in Southern Australia has a high proportion of juvenile rabbits. In the ACT region its diet comprises mostly rabbits and to a lesser extent birds (especially rosellas, magpie-larks and starlings) (Olsen and Fuentes 2004; Olsen et al. 2006, 2010). There is some evidence of prey partitioning between little eagles and the sympatric, larger wedge-tailed eagle (Aquila audax), with the latter tending to take larger prey and to eat more carrion (Baker-Gabb 1984; Debus and Rose 1999; Olsen et al. 2006, 2010). However, rabbits are the most common dietary item for both eagle species near Canberra (Olsen et al. 2010), indicating potential for competition for prey. Both species also eat carrion and it is possible that the more numerous wedge-tailed eagles in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) region keep little eagles away from macropod carcasses, and that little eagles would eat more carrion if not excluded by wedge-tailed eagles (Olsen et al. 2010). ==Threats== The main threats to the species are the destruction and degradation of its foraging and breeding habitat causing it to come into competition with the larger and more dominant wedge-tailed eagle, Aquila audax, (Olsen and Fuentes, 2005). The wedge-tailed eagle is not necessarily a predator of the little eagle but the two species share common habitat and prey and the large size and dominant nature of the wedge-tailed eagle could mean that the little eagle would be forced out of hunting and breeding grounds or even killed and eaten. ==References== * Baker-Gabb DJ (1984).

Its music incorporates Latin pop styles with rock, R&B;, dance, and mariachi elements. The album's lead single, \\"Don't Say Goodbye\\" would become her most successful song in English. Other singles released from the album were \\"I'll Be Right Here (Sexual Lover)\\", \\"The One You Love\\", \\"Casanova\\", and \\"Libre\\". Each of the main single releases, as well as other English songs on the album, have Spanish-language counterparts that became big hits on Billboard's Hot Latin Songs chart. ==Background== After the success of her previous album Paulina (2000), Universal Records decided to launch Rubio's career in the English market. Contributions to the album's production came from a wide range of producers and songwriters, including Cheryl Yie, Gen Rubin, Calanit Ledani, Daryl Zero, Jeeve, Kevin Colbert, Richard Marx, Marcello Azevedo, Brett James, Troy Verges, Jodi Marr, Rodolfo Castillo, Michelle Bell, Desmond Child, and once again with Estéfano and Christian De Walden. Some of the songs from Paulina were re-recorded in English for Border Girl. The album spawned five singles, giving Paulina a number one hit on Spanish radio: \\"Baila Casanova\\". Also, her first English-language single \\"Don't Say Goodbye\\" is still her most well-known song in English; it saw a physical release in the United Kingdom. The Spanish versions of the album's singles entered the Top 10 of Billboard‘s Hot Latin Songs chart. ==ReceptionCritical response=== The album has received favorable reviews. Ken Micallef from Rolling Stone gave a mixed review saying \\"her taste for combining techno, pop and Mexican flavors quickly asserts her unique potential.\\" Jose F. Promis of Allmusic stated that it \\"is a winning combination of different musical styles, successfully bridging pop, dance, hip-hop, rock, ballads, Latin, and even ranchera into one delicious package.\\" Leila Cobo of Billboard said that Border Girl is a party album with a wide array of elements and praise Rubio's vocal as \\"a voice that is sensually raspy but too wispy\\", leaving a good convincing impression. People Magazine recognized that she \\"brings to mind Kylie Minogue ’80s-style uptempo numbers such.\\" and she does \\"a couple of forays into the pop-R&B; territory of Jennifer Lopez\\". ===Commercial performance=== Border Girl debuted at No. 11 on the Billboard 200 with sales of 56,000 copies, and two weeks after its release, the album sold 84,000 copies, becoming Rubio's highest charting album in the U.S. As of December 2006 the album had sold 286,000 copies in United States according to Nielsen SoundScan. It was certified gold in July 23, 2002, indicating shipments of over 500,000 units. It was also certified Gold in Spain. The album managed to become a top ten hit on the Canadian Album's chart peaking at number nine. The album managed to chart on countries such as New Zealand, Dutch, Germany, Austria, Greece, Ireland, Russia and on the Swedish album charts where Paulina had not charted before. Border Girl also was number one in sales in Mexico and sold 150,000 copies in its first week, reaching the Platinum certification there.

It was created on 23 December 1905 for the Conservative politician Sir William Walrond, 2nd Baronet, of Bradfield House, Uffculme. The name of the barony, with its spelling being a variant of the family name, appears to have been chosen to suggest a possible ancestry from Waleran the Huntsman, feudal baron of West Dean, Wiltshire, at the time of the Domesday Book of 1086, which was held by the Waleran family until the death of Walter Walerand in 1200/1 leaving three daughters his co-heiresses.Sanders, I.J., English Baronies, Oxford, 1960, p.96 His elevation to the peerage did not cause a by-election due to the upcoming general election, where his son, William, succeeded him as the Member of Parliament for Tiverton. The Walrond Baronetcy, of Bradfield and of Newcourt, both in the County of Devon, was created in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom on 24 February 1876 for the first Baron's father, John Walrond, who also represented Tiverton in Parliament. The title was named after the family's manor of Bradfield, Uffculme, Devon, held by them since the 13th century. The baronetcy and barony became extinct on the death of the first Baron's grandson, the second Baron, on 4 April 1966. ==Walrond baronets, of Bradfield (1876)== *Sir John Walrond Walrond, 1st Baronet (1818–1889) *Sir William Hood Walrond, 2nd Baronet (1849–1925) (created Baron Waleran in 1905) ==Barons Waleran (1905)== *William Hood Walrond, 1st Baron Waleran (1849–1925) **Hon.

Located in Bush's Pasture Park south of Willamette's campus, the stadium includes a grandstand, football field, and track. ==History== Charles E. McCulloch donated $50,000 to the school in June 1947 in order to build an athletic complex on at what is now Bush's Pasture Park. At the time, McCulloch was president of the university's board of trustees and an attorney in Portland where he was a partner at what is now Stoel Rives. The proposed stadium was to have seating for 3,500 in a concrete grandstand, plus a baseball diamond, track, and practice field for the football team. Construction began in March 1950 with it planned to be completed in time for that year's football season. It was also announced the stadium would be named for Charles E. McCulloch and have a total capacity of 7,000. On October 14, 1950, a dedication ceremony was held with school president G. Herbert Smith and Oregon governor Douglas McKay on hand to welcome Hawaii and honor the 1941 Willamette team that was stranded in Hawaii after the attack on Pearl Harbor. The New York Giants football team held their first scrimmage of the 1958 season at the stadium on July 31. Around 1970 the track surface was converted to an asphalt and rubber surface, which was resurfaced in the 1980s. McCulloch Stadium went through a major renovation in 1993.Salem Online History: Willamette University After renovations, the field was named Ted Ogdahl Field in honor of the former coach while the locker rooms were dedicated in the honor of Jeff Knox. In October 1997, Liz Heaston became the first female to play in a college football game, kicking two extra points in the game at McCulloch against Linfield College. A new $300,000 rekotan track surface was installed at the stadium in 2000. At that time university officials discovered the previous track was too long. In 2003 the grass field was removed and a new FieldTurf surface was installed at a cost of $500,000. Later that year lights were re-installed at McCulloch at a cost of $110,000. A new video scoreboard was added at the facility in 2007. ==Sports== The stadium hosts a variety of sports.

It was first released by EMI Latin on 22 August 1996 in Mexico and 3 September in United States, and distributed in 22 countries around the world months later. The singer asserted partial creative control over the project, taking the role of co-producer and composer of the material assisted by various musicians and producers, namely K.C. Porter, Rodolfo Castillo, Cesar Lemos, Cesar Valle, Per Magnusson and David Kreuger. Four singles were released from the album: \\"Siempre Tuya Desde La Raíz\\", \\"Solo Por Ti\\", \\"Miedo\\" (in North America only), and \\"Enamorada\\", all of which experienced moderate success. ==Background and development== After the great commercial success of her first two hit albums and an attempt to enter the international market with El Tiempo Es Oro, Rubio returned to acting at the end of 1995 in her film debut Bésame En La Boca and recorded her third Mexican soap opera, Pobre Niña Rica, consolidating her status in the acting world. In May 1996, Emilio Estefan and José Behar, then president of EMI Latin, announced that the most important Spanish-speaking artists would gather to sing around the Atlanta Olympics. Among them, Rubio would resume her musical career with the song \\"Será Entre Tú Y Yo\\", part of the album Voces Unidas written and directed by Estefan. That same month, Rubio took the opportunity to talk about the creative process of her fourth studio album and, in turn, unveiled its name, Planeta Paulina. She said: \\"I want to show that I am not only a pretty face, but I have intelligence, I have prepared myself and now I am studying Art History.\\" On 6 July 1996, Billboard magazine reported that EMI would release the singer's fourth studio album in the coming months, following a contract in which the label would be responsible for regaining her status in Latin America after two \\"hit albums\\" and another moderate success. The album would be the first of a contract that provided for the release of three albums with EMI over the course of four years. The album marks Paulina's control in the creative process and was produced by Marco Flores. The first single released was written by Rodolfo Castillo and a single with English versions and remixes of the song \\"Solo por ti\\" was planned before the launch of Planeta Paulina. ==Composition== Musically, Planeta Paulina is a departure from Rubio's previous output, being influenced by the techno and Europop dance revolution of the mid-to-late 1990s. Conceived as an avant-garde record, the material encompasses a variety of versatile styles from the dance genre, including techno, electronica, disco, drum and bass and house. This album represent the transition of Rubio as a \\"dance diva\\" complete with a slick collection of electro-tinged club thumpers produced by the singer and Marco Flores. Additionally, selected recordings experiment with futuristic and spatial sound effects. Lyrically, the album's central focus is Rubio's passion, love, relationships and emotions. But when venturing as a songwriter, she touches on important social issues in that decade such as global warming, HIV, sexual orientation and the Mexican peso crisis. ==Singles== *Siempre tuya desde la Raíz: First single of the album, an album of remixes of the song was released, it includes the song in its album version and more 10 remixes, they are: Album Version (04:44); Planet Club Mix (06:48); Planet ·Radio Mix (04:11); Planet ·Dub Mix (06:48); House Club Mix (06:44); House ·Radio Mix (04:10); House ·Dub Mix (06:44); Spanglish Planet Mix (06:47); English Planet Mix (04:16); Spanglish Club Mix (06:42); English ·Club Edit (04:08).Paulina* – Siempre Tuya Desde La Raiz (Remixes) Discogs.com.

The original tower house is on the left. The remains of Burleigh Castle are located just outside the village of Milnathort, 1.5 miles north of Kinross, in Perth and Kinross, Scotland. The castle dates from the 15th and 16th centuries, and now sits beside the A911 road, opposite a 19th-century steading, recently adapted into housing. ==History== The lands of Burleigh were held by the Balfours from 1456, when they were granted by James II to John Balfour of Balgarvie, and a tower house was erected in the late 15th or early 16th century. Sir James Balfour of Pittendreich extended the castle in the late 16th century, adding a curtain wall with a corner tower, and other outbuildings. James VI of Scotland was a frequent visitor in the time of his son, Sir Michael Balfour. James VI was at Burleigh in January 1589 after spending Christmas at Kinneil House.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 9 (Edinburgh, 1915), p. 665. In July 1596 he stayed at Burleigh then rode to Stirling Castle for the christening of a son of the Countess of Mar.Annie I. Cameron, Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 11 (Edinburgh, 1936), p. 640. An Act of Parliament in 1600 made Michael Balfour wealthy, directing landowners and people of standing to buy armour from him, for defence musters. Several men complained that Balfour tried to make them buy more armour than their rank and income demanded.Register of the Privy Council of Scotland, vol. 6 (Edinburgh, 1898), pp. 180-2. In 1607 Michael Balfour was raised to the peerage as Lord Balfour of Burleigh. Legend tells how Robert Balfour, before his accession as 5th Lord, narrowly escaped death when, in 1707, he was sentenced to beheading for the murder of the schoolmaster of Inverkeithing, who had the misfortune to have married Balfour's childhood sweetheart. Escaping from Edinburgh tolbooth, Balfour joined the Jacobite cause, proclaiming the 'Old Pretender' James Stuart king at Lochmaben, and fighting in the 1715 rising. Following the defeat of the Jacobites, Balfour was attainted, dying in France in 1757. The castle was forfeit to the Irwins, then passed to the Grahams of Kinross. It is now a Scheduled Ancient Monument in the care of Historic Environment Scotland (no entrance charge; key available from nearby house at all reasonable times). In more recent history local poet Michael Bruce was inspired by Burleigh Castle and Arnot Tower and wrote a poem \\"The Lovers\\" (1760) it tells the story of Henry and Harriet from the feuding families the Arnots and Balfours who reputedly eloped to Burleigh castle. ==The castle== South-west tower of Burleigh Castle The remains of the castle comprise the western part of what was once a square courtyard or barmkin. In the north-west corner, the original tower house survives largely intact (though one of the first floor windows has been greatly enlarged) to three storeys and a garret in height. The walls rise to corbels which once supported a parapet walk. The roof and internal floors are now gone, although the vaulted basement remains. The turnpike stair in the north-east corner originally led up to a caphouse giving access to the parapet walk. To the south-west is a 16th-century corner tower, two storeys high above a basement, which retains its roof. The tower is round at the base, and corbelled out to a square upper storey, and is a particularly fine and picturesque example of Scottish baronial architecture of the period. Its masonry is happily very well preserved. Both this tower and the keep have gun loops around the base to deter attackers. The corner tower also has small round pistol-holes at cap-house level, though these may have been included more for their decorative effect than to provide a true defensive capability. Engraved on the north gable is the date 1582, and the initials IB and MB, for Sir James Balfour and his wife Margaret. The two towers are connected by a section of curtain wall pierced by an arched gate. Though now only a 'skin' of masonry, this wall once fronted a two-storey gatehouse. With its string- course, hood-mould over the gateway and moulded surround formerly containing a heraldic panel, this wall is an excellent example of small-scale but refined architectural sophistication of its period in Scotland (probably contemporary with the round corner tower). A defensive moat may have surrounded the barmkin in the past. ==References== *Coventry, Martin The Castles of Scotland (3rd Edition), Goblinshead, 2001 *Lindsay, Maurice The Castles of Scotland, Constable & Co. 1986 * *National Monuments Record of Scotland Site Reference NO10SW 1.0 ==External links== *Historic Scotland Category:Scheduled Ancient Monuments in Perth and Kinross Category:Castles in Perth and Kinross Category:Listed castles in Scotland ","title":"Burleigh Castle"},{"id":"6204056","text":"State Route 83 (SR 83) is a scenic state highway in southern Arizona, stretching from its junction with Interstate 10 near Vail south to Parker Canyon Lake.

Bourges was then a center of legal humanism and François Douaren (Franciscus Duarenus), one of the most famous members of this movement was among Doneau's teachers at Bourges. In 1551, Doneau received a doctorate from the University of Bourges and began teaching there. However, because of his Calvinist confession, Doneau had to flee to Geneva after the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre in 1572. Doneau accepted a call from the Reformed Elector Palatine Frederick III to a professorship at Heidelberg and assumed the post in early 1573. Doneau, however, would have to relocate again in 1579 because Heidelberg and the surrounding Electoral Palatinate were converted to the Lutheran confession by Frederick's successor Louis VI (r. 1576-83), and the elector required subscription to the Formula of Concord. Doneau then moved to the newly founded Leiden, but in 1587, the political circumstances forced him into exile for the third time: Doneau had to leave Leiden in 1588, because of his sympathies for Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester. Doneau returned to Germany and became professor of law at the Altdorf Academy (the university of the Free Imperial City of Nuremberg). He died in Altdorf in 1591. Doneau was one of the French jurists who followed the example of Andrea Alciato (Andreas Alciatus) and applied the methods of Renaissance humanism to law. However, while many of the followers of this so-called mos Gallicus (French method) concentrated on a critical evaluation of the texts in the Corpus Iuris Civilis, Doneau was more interested in the construction of a coherent system of law. His best known work Commentarii de iure civili (commentaries on the civil law) (in part edited posthumously by Scipione Gentili) is one of the first attempts to organise the subject matter of Roman law in a logical order rather than according to the sequence of the books and titles of the Digest. Doneau also made major contributions to various specialised areas of law such as the doctrine of possession and acquisition of ownership. == Works == Commentarius ad titulum Digestorum De praescriptis verbis et in factum actionibus, 1574 * Commentaria in tit.

A shoulder mark, also called a shoulder board, rank slide, or slip-on, is a flat cloth sleeve worn on the shoulder strap of a uniform.“Uniform Dress Guidelines”. Canadian Coast Guard. ver 26 06/27/08, p. 7 It may bear rank or other insignia, and should not be confused with an epaulette, although the two terms are often used interchangeably. ==Australia== The newer Auscam uniform design lacks shoulder marks, instead opting for a vertical strap in the middle of the chest region of the uniform. Rank insignia tags are slipped onto this strap. Unlike the older uniform designs, there are slip-ons for every rank in the Australian Defence Force. The older Auscam uniform designs featured shoulder straps, upon which slip-on rank insignia of Commissioned Officers could be affixed, and non-commissioned officers in the Air Force and Navy only. No shoulder-strap slip-ons are available for enlisted members of the army, whereas the other two services had appropriate slip ons, who have rank patches sewed onto the uniform arms. This older design is no longer issued, but may still be seen on personnel whose most recent uniform issue pre-dates the use of the new design. ==Canada== Three operational dress uniforms of the Canadian Forces, showing the two styles of slip-on worn by the Royal Canadian Navy. The red fabric between the two rows of braid indicates a medical officer; the navies of some other Commonwealth realms also use red stripes to denote a medical officer.

The slip-ons are worn on a similar-style strap located in the centre of the chest (and sometimes centre of the back as well) of the CADPAT shirt, jacket, parka, and raincoat.

Army officer shoulder marks are colored depending on the branch with which the officer is affiliated. They have an 1/8-inch gold stripe below the embroidered grade insignia (the end far from the collar). In the Air Force, a similar stripe is limited to senior officers (majors and above). Air Force general officers have an additional stripe at the near end. Enlisted and Air Force junior officer shoulder marks lack these distinctions. These are worn on all class B uniform shirts. US Navy officers wear shoulder boards on Summer White and Service Dress White uniforms, and wool overcoats and reefers. \\"Soft shoulder boards\\" (shoulder marks) are worn on long sleeve white shirts and on black sweaters worn with Service Khaki or Service Dress Blue uniforms. Coast Guard officers wear Naval style shoulderboards on all class B uniform shirts. Firm shoulder board, with two small white loops on the shirt for fixing Service dress uniforms in the U.S. air and land forces also have a different style of shoulder board, a firm material with an underlying longitudinal strap. The corresponding jacket shoulder has two small loops traversing from rear to front, and the open end of the shoulder board's strap is drawn through the two loops and affixed to the underside of the board. This effectively hides all the means of attachments, leaving a firm, finished surface. This particular style is what U.S. Air Force personnel call a shoulder board. The shoulder sleeve is called an epaulette, and the two are never confused. Blue Service Uniform with shoulder strap rank insignia (attentes), as worn by General George W. Casey, Jr. On the United States Army Blue Service Uniform, officers wear embroidered rank insignia \\"shoulder straps\\" (attentes) mounted lengthwise on the outside shoulder seams. These are 1⅝ inches wide by 4 inches/3½ inches (large size/small size) long, and are sewn, snapped, or clipped onto each shoulder. ===Boy Scouts of America=== The Boy Scouts of America uses colored shoulder loops worn on the shoulder straps to indicate the program level. Webelos Scouts wearing tan uniforms and all Cub Scout leaders wear blue loops, Boy Scouts and leaders wear forest green loops (changed from red in 2008), Varsity Scouts and leaders wear blaze (orange) loops, and Venturers and leaders wear emerald green loops. Adults who hold a district or council position wear silver loops; those with section, area, regional, or national positions wear gold loops, and those with international positions wear purple loops. The only youth permitted to wear gold loops are the National Chief, National Vice chief, and Region Chiefs of the Order of the Arrow. ==United KingdomMilitary=== See also: Uniforms of the British Armed Forces Rank slides are used by all of the UK Armed Forces, primarily on working dress uniforms.

In combat dress, however, rank insignia is displayed on 'rank slides' worn on the chest. Royal Air Force In the Royal Air Force, rank slides are worn by all ranks (except Aircraftman, which has no insignia) on the shoulders of working dress uniforms, and also on flying clothing and coveralls. Similar rank slides are also worn on a single tab on the chest of operational (CS95) clothing. ===St. John Ambulance=== As a ranked organisation, members of St. John Ambulance wear rank slides on all uniforms. Colours are used to differentiate between different health care professionals (e.g., green for paramedics, red for doctors). ===Police=== See also: Police uniforms and equipment in the United Kingdom#Uniform The uniforms of most police forces in the United Kingdom feature rank slides. At ranks below Inspector, the collar number is also displayed on the shoulder, although some Inspectors and above are starting to display their collar number alongside their rank insignia. The most notable exception to this is Kent Police, whose officers display their collar number on the stab vest instead of the rank slides. Public order officers' shoulder slides are often colour-coded according to their role: * Silver commander – Grey * Bronze commander – Yellow * PSU commander – Red * PSU sergeant – White * Medic – Green * Tactical adviser – Royal blue * Evidence gatherer – Orange === HM Prison Service=== The uniform of public sector Prison Officers and OSG’s in England & Wales feature shoulder slides on their uniform indicating rank, unique identification number and specialist role.

Over one in four adults (27 percent) had attained at least a bachelor's degree. Both of these measures are all time highs. In 2003, the percentage of the adult population who had completed high school or had not completed high school but obtained a GED increased for the first time since 2000, when it was 84 percent. This increase follows a general trend that the Current Population Survey has shown since educational attainment was first measured in 1947. In 2015, among adults aged 65 and older, 84 percent had either completed high school or more education, or had failed to complete high school but obtained at least a GED certification, compared to 91 percent of adults aged 25 to 34 and 89 percent of adults aged 35 to 44 years or 45 to 64 years. In addition, 27 percent of the population aged 65 and older reported a bachelor's degree or more education compared to 36 percent of adults 25 to 34 years old and 32 percent of adults aged 45 to 64 years. Since 1983 the percentage of people either graduating from high school or failing to complete high school but getting a GED certification has increased from 85% to 88%. The greatest increases in educational attainment were documented in the 1950s, 60s and 70s. In the 1950s and much of the 1960s high school graduates constituted about 50% of those considered adults (25 and above). For adults aged between 25 and 30, the percentage of either high school graduates or GED obtainers was roughly 50% in 1950 versus 90% today. ==Gender== For the past fifty years, there has been a gap in the educational achievement of males and females in the United States, but which gender has been underperforming has fluctuated over the years. In the 1970s and 1980s, data showed girls trailing behind boys in a variety of academic performance measures, specifically in test scores in math and science. Achievement gaps between boys and girls in the United States are more pronounced in reading and writing than in math and science. Data in the last twenty years shows the general trend of girls outperforming boys in academic achievement in terms of class grades across all subjects and college graduation rates, but boys score higher on standardized tests and are better represented in higher-paying and more prestigious STEM fields (science, technology, engineering, and math).Kafir, Krista (April 2007). \\"Taking the Boy Crisis in Education Seriously: How School Choice can Boost Achievement Among Boys and Girls.\\" Independent Women's Forum. ===Gender gap in literacy=== Traditionally, girls have outperformed boys in reading and writing. Although this gap may be minimal in kindergarten, it grows as students continue their education. According to the 2004 National Reading Assessment measured by the US Department of Education, the gap between boys and girls, only slightly noticeable in 4th grade, left boys 14 points behind girls during their 12th grade year.Perie, M. (2005). NAEP 2004 Trends in Academic Progress. Washington, DC: US Department of Education. On the 2008 test, female students continued to have higher average reading scores than male students at all three ages. The gap between male and female 4th graders was 7 points in 2008. By 12th grade, there was an 11-point gap between males and females. On the 2002 National Writing Assessment, boys scored on average 17 points lower than girls in 4th grade. The average gap increased to 21 points by 8th grade and widened to 24 points by senior year in high school.Persky, H. (2003). The Nation's Report Card: Writing 2002. US Department of Education. In the more recent 2007 National Assessment of Writing Skills, female students continued to score higher than male students, though margins closed slightly from previous assessments. The average score for female eighth-graders was 20 points higher than males, down 1 point from the 2002 score. For twelfth- graders, females outscored males by 18 points as opposed to 24 points in 2002.Salahu-Din, Debra (2008). The Nation's Report Card: Writing 2007. US Department of Education. All of these assessments were conducted on a 100-point scale. ===Graduation rates=== Overall, women have surpassed men in terms of completion of secondary and post-secondary education. In 2015/2016, women earned 61% of associate degrees, 57% of bachelor's degrees, 59% of master's degrees, and 53% of doctorates. A similar pattern is also seen in high school education, where, in 2016, 7.1% of males, but only 5.1% of females dropped out of high school. In 2015/2016, 56 percent of college students were female and 44 percent were male. From 1990 until 2015, the number of males enrolled in college increased by 41 percent, and the number of female students rose by 53 percent. In 2015/2016, 51% of degrees earned by males were bachelor's, which is slightly higher than that of females for whom 48% of degrees earned were bachelor's degrees. As of 2006, the numbers of both men and women receiving a bachelor's degree has increased significantly, but the increasing rate of female college graduates exceeds the increasing rate for males.Mead, Sara. (2006). The Evidence Suggests Otherwise: The Truth About Boys and Girls. Washington: Education Sector. In 2007, the United States Census Bureau estimated that 18,423,000 males over the age of 18 held a bachelor's degree, while 20,501,000 females over the age 18 held one. In addition, fewer males held master's degrees: 6,472,000 males compared to 7,283,000 females. However, more men held professional and doctoral degrees than women. 2,033,000 males held professional degrees compared to 1,079,000, and 1,678,000 males had received a doctoral degree compared to 817,000 females.U.S. Census Bureau, Current Population Survey, Annual Social and Economic Supplement 2007. In 2016/2017, women are projected to earn 64.2% of associate degrees, 59.9% of bachelor's degrees, 62.9% of master's degrees, and 55.5% of Doctorates. ==Ethnicity and race== While the educational attainment of all races increased during the 1990s, with the gap between African Americans and non-Hispanic whites decreasing, differences between the races remain, especially among those with a bachelor's degree or higher. Asian Americans had the highest educational attainment of any race, followed by whites who had a higher percentage of high school graduates but a lower percentage of college graduates. Persons identifying as Hispanic or Latino, without regard to race, had the lowest educational attainment. The gap was the largest between foreign-born Asian Americans, over half (50.1%) of whom had a bachelor's degree or higher and foreign-born Hispanics, 9.8% of whom had a four-year college degree. Hispanics and Latinos also trailed far behind in terms of graduating from high school; it was the only major group for which high school graduates constituted less than 80% of the population. This large inequality might partially be explained by the influx of uneducated foreign- born Hispanic Americans who had not been offered the chance to complete secondary education in their home country and who had not completed secondary education in the United States. Overall, nearly half (49.8%) of Asian Americans, nearly a third (30%) of non-Hispanic Whites, 17.3% of non-Hispanic Blacks, and just over a tenth (11.4%) of Hispanics or Latinos had a four-year college degree. The same differences decrease significantly at the high school level with 89.4% of non-Hispanic whites, 87.6% of Asian Americans, 80.0% of African Americans, and 57% of Hispanics or Latinos having graduated from high school.In August 2020, the US Justice Department argued that Yale University discriminated against Asian candidates on the basis of their race, a charge the university denied. The Racial achievement gap in the United States refers to these educational disparities between differing ethnic groups. Several racial achievement gaps remain present today because not all groups of students are advancing at the same rates. These racial achievement gaps have many individual and economic implications and there have been many efforts in education reform to narrow the gaps. ===Immigrants=== The difference among races and cultures, both native and foreign born, in regard to those who have earned a bachelor's degree or higher. A trend becomes visible when comparing the foreign-born to the native-born populace of some races. Foreign-born Asian, European, and African immigrants had a higher educational attainment in terms of having earned a four-year college degree than their native-born counterparts. According to the U.S census about 43.8 percent of African immigrants achieved the most college degrees, compared to 42.5 percent of Asian-Americans, 28.9 percent for immigrants from Europe, Russia and Canada and 23.1 percent of the U.S. population as a whole. The opposite is true on the high school level and among Hispanics, where the dramatically lower educational attainment of the foreign-born population decreased the educational attainment of the general Hispanophone populace, statistically. > with a high school diploma (67 percent) was dramatically lower than that of > the native population (88 percent), but paradoxically, the percentage with a > bachelor's degree was the same (27 percent)...

In the general population the proportion of persons with a bachelor's degree or higher was the same among the foreign-born and native-born population (27.2%). As stated above fewer foreign born Americans completed high school than native born Americans. Overall, 87.5% of the native born population had graduated from high school, versus 67.2%. Among whites the difference was three percentage points, the same as for African Americans. Among Asian Americans the difference was five percentage points. It was thirty percentage points among Hispanics or Latinos. African immigrants have been among the more highly educated group in the United States since the 1990s.(Logan & Deane, 2003; Williams, 2005; The Economist, 1996; Arthur, 2000; Selassie, 1998). This phenomenon is related to the large \\"brain drain\\" in Africa. ==Income== Chart of unemployment and salary based on education attainment Data are for persons age 25 and over. Earnings are for full-time wage and salary workers Educational attainment is strongly correlated with income in the United States. Although the incomes of both men and women are associated with higher educational attainment (higher incomes for higher educational attainment), large income gaps linked to race and gender remained at each educational level. In 2003, average incomes ranged from $13,459 for a male high-school dropout to $90,761 for a male with an advanced degree. The most significant average income difference was between those who had some college education or an associate degree and those who had a bachelor's degree. While those with some college averaged $31,046, those with a bachelor's degree averaged $51,194, over $20,000 (64.9%) a year more. The second most dramatic difference in average income was between those with a bachelor's degree with $51,940 and those with an advanced degree who made $72,824, roughly $21,000 (42.2%) more. The least significant difference was between those who had graduated from high school and those who had either some college or an associate degree. Here the difference was a mere $3,766 or 13.8%. The difference between those with a high school diploma ($30,000) and those who did not complete high school ($18,826) was $8,454 or 45%. Overall, the income in the United States for all sexes, races and levels of educational attainment was $36,308 annually. Even though African immigrants are claimed to have higher educational attainment rates than any other group, they were the hardest hit during the most recent recession beginning in 2007. This shows that race and/or ethnicity may play a role in income levels and job selection. { class= - !colspan=2Criteria !Overall !Less than 9th grade !High school drop-out !High school graduate !Some college !Associate degree !Bachelor's degree !Master's degree !Professional degree !Doctorate degree - rowspan=2Median individual incomeMale, age 25+$51,297$30,018$30,065$40,901$46,851$51,734$67,399$90,011$122,239$101,126 - Female, age 25+$37,137$19,802$19,612$27,203$31,136$34,951$49,011$60,370$82,174$81,598 - colspan=2Median household income$45,016$18,787$22,718$36,835$45,854$51,970$68,728$78,541$100,000$96,830 } SOURCE: US Census Bureau, 2018 Income by education and gender. The change in median personal and household income since 1991 also varied greatly with educational attainment. While both the overall median personal and household income increased since 1991, this increase did not take place on all levels of educational attainment. The overall income increased over the course of the 1990s, reaching its high in 1999, but has been decreasing ever since. In 1991 the median household income in the US was $40,873 in 2003 dollars, while the median household income in 2003 was $45,016. In 1999, however, the median household income was $46,236, 2.7% higher than today. While this trend held true for all levels of educational attainment the extent of chronicle fluctuations in income were greatly influenced by educational attainment. Overall, the median household and personal income decreased for those with more than a 9th grade education but less than a four-year college degree since 1991. In other words, the median household income decreased for households and individuals at the high school drop-outs and graduate, some-college, and an associate degree level. Income did, however, increase for those with a bachelor's degree or more. The following table shows the median household income according to the educational attainment of the householder. All data is in 2003 dollars and only applies to householders whose householder is aged twenty-five or older. The highest and lowest points of the median household income are presented in bold face. { class= - !Year !Overall Median !Less than 9th grade !High school drop-out !High school graduate !Some college !Associate degree !Bachelor's degree !Bachelor's degree or more !Master's degree !Professional degree !Doctorate degree - 1991$40,873 fc0;\\"$17,414$23,096$37,520$46,296$52,289$64,150 fc0;\\"$68,845 fc0;\\"$72,669$102,667 fc0;\\"$92,614 - 1993 fc0;\\"$40,324$17,450$22,523 fc0;\\"$35,979 fc0;\\"$44,153 fc0;\\"$49,622$64,537$70,349$75,645$109,900$93,712 - 1995$42,235$18,031 fc0;\\"$21,933$37,609$44,537$50,485 fc0;\\"$63,357$69,584$77,865 fc0;\\"$98,302$95,899 - 1997$43,648$17,762$22,688$38,607$45,734$51,726$67,487$72,338$77,850$105,409$99,699 - 1999 cfc;\\"$46,236 cfc;\\"$19,008$23,977 cfc;\\"$39,322 cfc;\\"$48,588 cfc;\\"$54,282 cfc;\\"$70,925 cfc;\\"$76,958 cfc;\\"$82,097 cfc;\\"$110,383 cfc;\\"$107,217 - 2001$45,300$18,830 cfc;\\"$24,162$37,468$47,605$53,166$69,796$75,116$81,993$103,918$96,442 - 2003$45,016$18,787$22,718$36,835$45,854$51,970$68,728$73,446$78,541$100,000$96,830 - Average$43,376$18,183$23,013$37,620$46,109$51,934$66,997$72,376$78,094$104,368$94,487 } SOURCE: US Census Bureau, 2003 Yellow indicates the year with the lowest median income while green indicates the year with the highest reported median income. Income by education and race. Among the races, educational attainment retains its dramatic effect on average income which varies significantly at each educational level. European Americans (White Americans) had the highest average income at every level of educational attainment. However, the proportion of those having college degrees is greater among Asian Americans than among non-Hispanic whites, and the overall highest average income is found among Asians. All races except Whites ranked last on at least one level with African Americans ranking last on the non-high school, high school and advanced degree level. Asians were second highest on the college graduate level and had the highest overall income among the general population. They also had the lowest average annual income for those with some college education or an associate degree. Racial income difference were also significant at every level of educational attainment with the largest racial inequality being between European and African Americans who did not complete high school and those with advanced college degrees. Overall, European Americans with an advanced degree had the highest average annual income with $74,122. Asian Americans had the second highest with $72,852. Hispanics and African Americans had the lowest annual incomes among those with advanced degrees averaging $67,679 and $59,944 annually. The largest racial inequity was between European Americans with a bachelor's degree who made $53,185 and Hispanics who made $12,263 or 29.9% less with an average annual income of $40,949. However, Asian Americans as a whole earn more than any other race due to a greater percentage of them being educated overall, an example of Simpson's paradox. ==Occupation== The educational attainment of employed civilians age 25 to 64 according to occupational field. The educational attainment varied significantly among the different types of occupations. The professional/managerial fields were the only two occupational fields where college graduates with a bachelor's degree or higher represented the majority. Among professional occupations, 99.1% of the population graduated from high school, 90.2% had some college education or an associate degree and over two thirds, 68.2% had a bachelor's degree or higher. Business and managerial occupations were second with 97.8% having graduated from high school, 79.5% having some college or an associate degree and just over half, 53.4% having a bachelor's degree or higher. While nearly all employment fields feature a population where over 80% had graduated from high school with over a third having some college education or an associate degree, the fields relating to agriculture, construction, manufacturing, and transportation did not. These, often described as blue collar, fields featured a labor force where less than a tenth of the population had a bachelor's degree or higher, less than half had some college or an associate degree, and less than 80% had graduated from high school. Overall, the least educated occupational field was agriculture, ranking last on all educational levels. Here 55.4% had graduated from high school, roughly one fifth (20.8%) had some college education or an associate degree and 6.8% had a bachelor's degree or higher. While the largest occupational field, that consisting of professionals and relating occupations was also the largest field, the fields with lower educational attainment combined were larger than the professional and managerial fields combined. Overall, 38.02% were employed in the professional and managerial fields while 61.89% were employed in the other white and blue collar fields were those with a bachelor's degree or higher constituted less than a third of the work force. The percent of the labor force in the Professional/Managerial and relating occupations, white collar occupations and blue collar occupations. ==Religion== The Pew Research Center's 2014 Religious Landscape Study found educational attainment varied considerably across religious groups.The most and least educated U.S. religious groups Membership in these religious groups can be highly correlated with demographic groups and geographic areas, so membership in a particular religion is not the only explanation for these differences, and vice versa. {class=\\"sortable \\" !Group !! % with college degree !! % with some college !! % with high school diploma !! % with less than high school diploma -  Hindu  77  11  10  2 -  Unitarian Universalist  67 23  9  1 -  Jewish  59  22  16  3 -  Anglican  59  32 8  1 -  Episcopal Church (United States)  56  28  14  2 -  Presbyterian Church (USA)  47  25  24  3 -  Buddhist  47  33 18  2 -  United Church of Christ  46  21  26  7 -  Atheist  43  31  22  4 -  Agnostic  42  36  21  1 -  Orthodox Christian  40  34  21  5 -  Muslim  39  25  30  6 -  United Methodist Church  37  31  29  4 -  Evangelical Lutheran Church in America  36  33  28  3 -  Presbyterian Church in America  33  37 27  3 -  Mormon  33  40  22  5 -  Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod  32  34  32  3 -  Seventh-day Adventist Church  28  38  28  6 -  All adults  27  32  31  16 -  Catholic  26  27  31  16 -  \\"Nothing in particular\\"  24  32  34  10 -  African Methodist Episcopal Church  21  44  28  7 -  Church of the Nazarene  20  37  38  5 -  National Baptist Convention  19  27  40  14 -  Southern Baptist Convention  19  35  38  8 -  Churches of Christ  18  37  36  10 -  Assemblies of God  15  32  38  15 -  Church of God in Christ  13  37  33  17 -  Jehovah's Witnesses  12  25  44  19 -  American Baptist Churches USA  12  27  43  17 -  Church of God (Cleveland, Tennessee)  11  25  47  17 } ==Geography== Educational attainment among the population aged 25 and above varied rather slightly with geography region. The population of the Northeastern United States, which had the smallest population of any region with thirty-six million residents, had the highest percentage of high- school and college graduates. The western United States had the highest percentage of those with some college or an associate degree and ranked second for college graduates. The South which had by far the largest population with roughly sixty-six million people had the lowest educational attainment at every level. The proportion of high school graduates was the largest in the Midwest while the proportion of those with some college or an associate degree was the second and that of those with a bachelor's degree or higher was the third largest of any region. ==Social class and education== Educational attainment is one of the primary indicators of social class in the United States. While the American social class system is a vaguely defined concept with many contradicting theories, educational attainment emerges as one of the top assessments of social class. Not only is a high educational attainment a status symbol by itself, but it is also very closely related to the other two main indicators of social class: occupation and income. A graduate degree and the roughly seven to eight years of post-secondary education serve as the main requirement for entering the \\"professions\\" and becoming part of the professional middle class. Education is a major key in becoming a more privileged member of the American middle class. Overall, educational attainment is the main entrance barrier into more privileged parts of the middle class as it is not only of high value but is also the requirement for becoming a professional and earning the corresponding income. This corresponding income is typically significantly higher than that of someone without this higher level of educational attainment in the United States. Exceptions include some entrepreneurs who can rank anywhere in the class system but are usually not referred to as professional middle class unless they are of the professions. In the United States, it is also important to differentiate between the statistical middle class, often defined as consisting of those who are neither rich nor poor, and the professional middle class. Recent research has shown that not only is the statistical middle of society (those with income roughly 80% to 120% of the national median or members of the mid-quintile) no longer able to afford the lifestyle indicative of the middle class, but there also seems to be a widening income gap in between those who may be described as being middle class. Education is not only the main requirement for becoming a member of the professional middle class, it is also key to a comfortable lifestyle and economic security. Those in the statistical middle may have to fear lay-offs and cost-cutting downsizing as well as out-sourcing, while some of those in the professional middle class are less subject to economic fluctuations and are more likely to enjoy upper-middle range incomes even in the face of recessions. Increasingly however even the professional middle class is facing lay-offs and job elimination due to downsizing and replacement of full-time workers with part- time workers—this is particularly evident in colleges and universities where, by 2009, half of the faculty were part-time; another 25% were full-time but with short-term contracts, thus showing that advanced education is not necessarily associated with high salaries and economic stability.James Monks. \\"Who are the Part-time Faculty?\\" Academe, July–August 2009. http://www.aaup.org/article/who-are-part-time-faculty#.UsU90fQW0oo ==Educational attainment in social theory== Mean financial wealth of U.S. families by education of the head of household, 1989–2010. Mean income of U.S. families by education of the head of household, 1989–2010. ===Bourdieu and cultural capital=== Many scholars have studied educational attainment in the US as a form of social reproduction and stratification. In 1977, Pierre Bourdieu presented the idea that education leads to social reproduction and a stratified society by honoring the cultural capital of elite classes. Students who possess the valued cultural capital, according to Bourdieu, are rewarded with high academic achievement.Bourdieu, P. (1977) Cultural Reproduction and Social Reproduction. In: Karabel, J., & Halsey, A. H. (eds.) Power and Ideology in Education. Oxford University Press, New York, pp. 487-511. When elite class members enter the workforce, they are channeled into high paying jobs and powerful positions within society, while those who did not achieve the same level of academic success fall into subordinate occupations and status levels. By rewarding the desired cultural capital with high academic achievement, upper classes are able and prepared to reach higher levels of educational attainment. Members of the working class, on the other hand, are not rewarded for their cultural capital in schools, and are instead socialized for working class jobs. ===Lareau and concerted cultivation=== Annette Lareau also addresses the factors that lead to social stratification in educational attainment. Lareau's idea of concerted cultivation refers to an active involvement of parents in a child's learning and development experiences by creating and controlling organized activities for their children. According to Lareau, middle-class parents engage in concerted cultivation to teach their children, while lower- and working-class parents do not. Laureau further explains that schools firmly encourage and expect parents to use concerted cultivation as a child-rearing strategy. The child-rearing practices of lower- and working-class families thus do not comply with the standards of educational institutions. As a result, lower- and working-class students develop a sense of \\"distance, distrust, and constraint\\" in educational institutions, while children of middle-class families gain a sense of entitlement. These differences in child-rearing practices lead to children of lower- and working-class families to lack the necessary life skills that the children of the middle class possess, further isolating them from educational opportunities. In the United States, education attainment typically is viewed as a sign of social status. ===Collins and credentialism=== Randall Collins contributed the idea of credentialism to the study of class-based differences in educational attainment. Collins maintains that public schools are socializing institutions that teach and reward middle-class values of competition and achievement. In this view, elites are selectively separated from other students and placed into prestigious schools and colleges, where they are trained to hold positions of power. ==See also== *American middle class *Education in the United States *Household income in the United States *Literacy in the United States *Poverty in the United States *List of U.S. States by Education attainment * Racial achievement gap in the United States General: *Academic degree *Status attainment ==ReferencesFurther reading== * Sunny Decker (1969), An Empty Spoon, New York: Harper & Row. * James Herndon (1968/1969), The Way It Spozed to Be, reprint, New York: Bantam. * James Herndon (1971/1997), How to Survive in Your Native Land, reprint, Portsmouth, NH: Boynton/Cook. * James Herndon (1985), Notes from a Schoolteacher, New York: Simon and Schuster. * Holly Yettick and Sterling C.

He worked for stations which included WERE, WHK, and WWWE (now WTAM) in Cleveland, Ohio. He spent a short time in New York City, but failed to achieve the huge following he had in Ohio. Gary Dee's style varied from a confrontational, \\"down home\\" manner, to satire, and a no-holds barred shock jock style. He paved the way for radio stars who would follow him. Gary made heavy use of country music, especially Johnny Cash and George Jones. In his tongue-in-cheek way, he would poke fun at politicians, society in general, and his own family and life. ==Biography== Dee was born in Hope, Arkansas. His father was a sharecropper who moved the family to Exeter, California when Dee was 11. There his father became a fire chief. He went on to spend three semesters at the University of California, Berkeley, studying accounting. He dropped out and went on to enter the College of the Sequoias. He then finished his degree in radio and speech at Fresno State College while living in a funeral home rent-free in exchange for answering the phones at night; or at least that was the deal. Gary sublet two of his three rooms and had the other college students do the work. While in Fresno, he was on-air at KYNO, the Gene Chenault-owned Top-40 station that was an early stop for famed programmer Bill Drake. He appeared on-air at KYNO and cross-town rival KMAK in both Top-40 and country incarnations. In 1972, Cleveland, Ohio radio station WERE hired him from Fresno, California where he had been a country music disc jockey and advertising agency owner. At the time, he idolized television talk show host Joe Pyne, who pioneered the confrontational style of hosting in which the host advocates a viewpoint and argues with guests and audience members. WERE itself was transitioning into a talk format dubbed \\"People Power,\\" with an emphasis on controversial hosts and an in-your-face approach. Dee became the linchpin of the new format, and quickly became the highest-rated talk show host in Cleveland. After an ownership change at WERE in 1975, country music outlet WHK hired away Dee to be their new morning show host, where he continued to enjoy successful ratings for almost a decade. In the late 1970s, however, Dee himself made news headlines for breaking the nose of his then wife Liz Richards, who was a WEWS-TV news anchor and co-host of that stations' high- profile breakfast television show, The Morning Exchange. His divorce with her was highly publicized as well. Dee became one of the best known (and most listened to) talk hosts in Cleveland. He was known for his encounters with politicians—especially legendary Cleveland City Councilman George Forbes, who would go on the air with Gary, often trading jabs until both were laughing so hard they could not continue. After a brief stint in New York and Washington, DC (at WPKX-FM, now WMAL-FM), Dee returned to Cleveland's WWWE (now WTAM) in the 1980s. Highlights of this period included Dee finding out, on the air, that his beloved wooden boat (the Lyman, as he would refer to it) had been burned while docked outside of the city. Gary also had on-air encounters with his son, who Gary claimed was using illegal substances, and stealing from him. Dee's son later became a radio announcer. Dee left WWWE after one of several ownership changes. His health began to fail, but he did return to WERE in the early 1990s for a brief run before his death of heart failure following a stroke on November 10, 1995. ==References * A Tribute to Gary Dee (Gilbert) America's 1st Shock Jock - Updated July 2009 * The Gary Dee Podcast Page - remember to share your comments * The Gary Dee Tribute Group - Please join. it's safe and easy * Gary Dee's Obituary The Cleveland Plain Dealer Nov 12, 1995 * The Dark Side of Gary Dee Category:1935 births Category:1995 deaths Category:American talk radio hosts Category:People from Hope, Arkansas Category:Radio personalities from Cleveland Category:People from Exeter, California ","title":"Gary Dee"},{"id":"6204112","text":"The Texas A&M; Health Science Center, a component of Texas A&M; University, offers health professions research and education in dentistry, medicine, nursing, biomedical sciences, public health, and pharmacy.

The church building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. ==Architecture and building history== The church is located on a rise at the northern end of Lenox village, on the west side of Main Street. It stands on a parcel in size that includes the town's first cemetery. It is a two-story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof and clapboarded exterior. A gabled entry vestibule projects from the center of the main (south-facing) facade, with the entrance at its center, flanked by pilasters and topped by a gabled pediment. Above the entrance are a Palladian window and a dentillated gable. The building corners have fluted pilasters. A tower rises astride the main block and the vestibule projections, with a square clock-faced stage topped by an open octagonal belfry with paneled pilastered supports. Above the belfry is an octagonal paneled stage which is crowned by a cupola, finial, and cross. The meetinghouse was built in 1805 by architect and builder Benjamin D. Goodrich of Richmond, based on designs by Asher Benjamin and Charles Bulfinch. It was dedicated on January 1, 1806. Its total cost was $6,619.00 including furnishings. The building was erected on land near the town's first meetinghouse (built 1770), which it replaced. The current pastor is the Rev. Elizabeth (Liz) R. Goodman.

From this intersection, the highway heads southeast, but curves towards the east as it enters the Papago Indian Reservation. It continues towards the east passing through the communities of Schuchuli, Gunsight, Wahak Hotrontk, Plato Vaya, Covered Wells before curving towards the southeast near Quijotoa. It continues southeast until curves towards the east in Sells. It curves towards the northeast near Little Tucson and curves back to the east near San Pedro.

SR 86 was originally designated in 1930, between Willcox and Bowie. In 1931, it was extended west to Benson and east to the New Mexico state line, effectively serving as a direct bypass to the US 80 Douglas loop. From 1927 to 1960, the remainder of the bypass between the Arizona border and Road Forks, New Mexico was served by New Mexico State Road 14. SR 86 was further extended through Tucson and the Tohono O'odham Indian Reservation to Ajo in 1943. SR 85 was extended south from Ajo to Lukeville in 1955, establishing a concurrency with SR 86 to Why. In 1970, SR 86 had its eastern end truncated to US 89 (later State Business Route 19) in Tucson after being replaced by I-10 between Tucson and New Mexico. In 1991, the concurrency with SR 85 between Ajo and Why was removed, truncating the western end of SR 86 to Why.

The 2011 census recorded 3,609 residents in the community and 6,130 residents in the municipal unit. The town sits on the southeastern part of the Paiko mountain range. Located 69 km northwest of Thessaloniki, 539 km north of Athens and 20 km north of Pella, the ancient capital of the kingdom of Macedon. Goumenissa is the seat of the Greek Orthodox diocese of Goumenissa, Axioupoli and Polykastro.Ιερά Μητρόπολις Γουμενίσσης, Αξιουπόλεως & Πολυκάστρου Goumenissa has narrow streets lined with traditional houses and is renowned for a wide range of things; apart from its preindustrial monuments built beside lush springs, there are traditional wineries which prove the expertise of this small country town to produce good quality wine. It is known for its folklore museum, its impromptu brass bands (Τα Χάλκινα της Γουμένισσας Ta Chalkina tis Goumenissas) and its customs, events and fetes, all of them are reflective of the traditional lifestyle. ==Name== There are a lot of versions of the origin of the name Goumenissa. According to the local tradition, robbers hung the Abbot (Greek: Ηγούμενος egoumenos) of the abbey, and the city's name, which means place of Abbot derived from this. In Bulgarian, it was called Гуменидже Gumenidzhe. ==HistoryHellenistic Era=== The town is located in part of the ancient Paeonia, the exact boundaries of which, like the early history of its inhabitants, are very obscure. According to Herodotus (v. 16), they were Teucrian colonists from Troy. Homer (Iliad, book II, line 848) speaks of Paeonians from the Axios River fighting on the side of the Trojans, but the Iliad does not mention whether the Paeonians were kin to the Trojans. Homer gives the Paionian leader as a certain Pyraechmes; later on in the Iliad a second leader is mentioned, Asteropaeus son of Pelagon. ===Roman Era (146 BC - 330)=== After the Roman conquest of Macedon in 146 BC, Paionia east and west of the Axios formed the second and third districts respectively of the Roman province of Macedonia (Livy xiv. 29). Centuries later under Diocletian, Paionia and Pelagonia formed a province called Macedonia secunda or Macedonia Salutaris, belonging to the Praetorian prefecture of Illyricum. ===Byzantine Era (330 - 1387)=== Street of Goumenissa. Church in Goumenissa. When the Roman Empire was divided into eastern and western segments ruled from Constantinople and Rome respectively, Goumenissa came under the control of the Eastern Roman Empire (Byzantine Empire). Goumenissa passed out of Byzantine hands in 1204, when Constantinople was captured by the Fourth Crusade and became part of the Kingdom of Thessalonica - the largest fief of the Latin Empire, covering most of north and central Greece. In 1224 it was seized by Theodore Komnenos Doukas, the Greek ruler of Despotate of Epirus. The area was recovered by the Byzantine Empire in 1246. First report with the name Goumenissa we have at the year 1346, at the era of Palaiologos Dynasty. In an Imperial Act of this year, the region of Goumenissa is granted in the Holly Abbey Ibyron of Mount Athos and becomes religious centre because of the Monastery of Virgin Mary. Next to Monastery existed a settlement that little later with the union of small agro- pastoral settlements will create a dynamic town that will be named Goumenissa. ===Ottoman Era (1387 - 1912)=== 19th century houses. The Ottomans had captured Goumenissa in 1387. Under the rule of the Ottoman Empire the area was characterized self-governed town and acquired privileges because of the important production of buckram, used for the military uniforms of the Ottoman army. Goumenissa prospered during the 19th century and became economic, cultural and religious centre of the region. The famed wine of Goumenissa, made out of local varieties like Xinomavro and Negoska,J. Robinson Jancis Robinson's Guide to Wine Grapes pg 127 Oxford University Press 1996 become popular in the Ottoman Empire and beyond, particularly in Central Europe. Even though being a town with privileges, it was not uninvolved in the Greek War of Independence of 1821. By the outbreak of the revolution, the Ottoman army conducted searches of premises and found 49 rifles. This led to violent islamization ordered by Pasha of Thessaloniki Abdul Abud. The punishment included the handing over of money, food, animals and carriages. The Russian slavist Victor Grigorovich in 1845, however, recorded Igumencho as mostly Bulgarian village.Григоровичъ, В. Очеркъ путешествія по Европейской Турціи, Москва, 1877, стр.91. The first Bulgarian school was founded in 1866-1867.Кирил патриарх Български. Българската екзархия в Одринско и Македония след Освободителната война 1877-1878. Том първи, книга втора, стр. 28. Macedonian Struggle By 1899, the Bulgarian guerrillas of the Internal Macedonian-Adrianople Revolutionary Organisation (IMRO) turned against Ottoman authorities. Gradually, tensions increased among the followers of the Patriarchate of Constantinople (mostly Greeks) and those of the Bulgarian Exarchate (mostly Bulgarians) to the point of armed conflict. The rioting in Macedonia, the atrocities of Bulgarian guerrilla troops against Greek locals and especially the death of Pavlos Melas (killed by Turks in 1904) caused intense nationalistic feelings in Greece. This led to the decision to send more Greek guerrilla troops in order to thwart Bulgarian efforts. The village also had supporters of the Bulgarian cause. Notably, 21 persons joined the Macedonian-Adrianopolitan Volunteer Corps„Македоно- одринското опълчение 1912-1913 г. Личен състав“, Главно управление на архивите, 2006, стр. 840.(Macedonian-Adrianopolitan Volunteer Corps. Staff according to documents from Directorate Central Military Archives, Sofia 2006, p. 840.) Conflicts ended after the revolution of Young Turks in July 1908, as they promised to respect all ethnicities and religions and generally to provide a constitution. On October 23, 1912, during the course of the First Balkan War Goumenissa was conquered by the Greek army and incorporated into the Greek Kingdom. =Greek Macedonian fighters in Greek: \\"Obscure Native Macedonian Fighters\\" published by Company of Macedonian Studies, 2008= *Goumenissa: Dimitrios Aliris, Ioannis Aliris, Christos Aliris, Ioannis Vouzas, Vassilios Karakolis, Athanassios Maltsis, Georgios Metaxas, Georgios Pazaretzos, Ioannis Papageorgiou, Nikolaos Papamanolis, Ioannis Pissoutas, Athanassios Pipsos, Georgios Poulkas, Aggelos Sakellariou, Eleni Samara, Georgios Samaras, Dimitrios Samaras, Konstantinos Samaras, Athanassios Slapakis, Dimitrios Slioupikidis, Athanassios Tzanas, Georgios Totsis, Christos Toumpas, Athanassios Tsimirikos, Nikolaos Chatzivrettas, Christos Chatzidimitrakis *Kastaneri: Georgios Dogiamas, Lazaros Dogiamas, Traianos Dogiamas, Christos Dogiamas, Traianos Touloupis, *Karpi: Athanassios Zaras, Athanassios Betsis, Traianos Partoulas, Georgios Softsis, Traianos Softsis, *Griva: Ioannis Ekonomou, Christos Poulkas, Christos Pipsos =Bulgarian Macedonian fighters= *Goumenissa: Ichko Boychev (1882–1960),Христо Григоров, Ичко Бойчев - горноджумайският войвода.

A French Division camped in Goumenissa and built a military hospital, a power station and the famous Fountain in Central Square. The population exchanges among Greece, Turkey, and Bulgaria after 1923 resulted in the replacement by Greek refugees from East Thrace, Asia Minor and Eastern Rumelia of most of the Slavic and Turkish elements. Greek Macedonia experienced radical demographic transformations with the arrival of the Pontic Greeks; by 1928, 427 families comprising 1,676 inhabitants arrived from Turkey.Κατάλογος των προσφυγικών συνοικισμών της Μακεδονίας σύμφωνα με τα στοιχεία της Επιτροπής Αποκαταστάσεως Προσφύγων (ΕΑΠ) έτος 1928 The Slavic-speaking minority in Greek Macedonia, who were referred to by the Greek authorities as “Slavomacedonians”, “Slavophone Greeks” and “Bulgarisants”, were subjected to a gradual assimilation by the Greek majority. Their numbers were reduced by a large-scale emigration to North America in the 1920s and the 1930s and to Eastern Europe and Yugoslavia following the Greek Civil War (1944–1949). During World War II Goumenissa and Central Macedonia were occupied (1941–44) by Germany. During the same time a detachment of the pro-Bulgarian paramilitary organization Ohrana was formed.Мичев, Добрин. Българското национално дело в Югозападна Македония (1941 – 1944 г.) In the 1950s there was a massive emigration to the United States, Australia, Canada, West Germany and other Greek cities, mainly to Thessaloniki and Athens. In the 1980s many civil war refugees were allowed to re-emigrate. ==Subdivisions== The municipal unit Goumenissa is subdivided into the following communities: *Goumenissa (η Γουμένισσα) Town Hall *Griva (η Γρίβα) *Gerakon (η Γερακών) *Karpi (η Κάρπη) *Kastaneri (η Καστανερή) *Omalos (ο Ομαλός) *Pentalofon (το Πεντάλοφον) *Stathis (ο Στάθης) *Filyria (η Φιλυριά) ===Mayors of Goumenissa=== {  - !Mayor !From !To !Elected !Backed by - Christos Karakolis (Χρήστος Καρακόλης) January 1, 1983 December 31, 1990 October 1982 60%, October 1986 52% PASOK, KKE, KKE Interior - Dimitrios Pakos (Δημήτριος Πάκος) January 1, 1991 December 31, 1994 October 1990 53,7% New Democracy - Dimitrios Petsos (Δημήτριος Πέτσος) January 1, 1995 December 31, 1998 October 1994 52,8% PASOK - Vasilios Patsis (Βασίλειος Πάτσης) January 1, 1999 December 31, 2002 October 1998 52,6% New Democracy - Dimitrios Petsos (Δημήτριος Πέτσος) January 1, 2003 December 31, 2006 October 2002 50,96% PASOK - Stylianos Papapanagiotou (Στυλιανός Παπαπαναγιώτου) January 1, 2007  October 2006 52,35% New Democracy } ==Landmarks== Folklore museum *Central Square *The French Fountain *Square of St. George *Small Square *Macedonian Folklore Museum (Goumenissa) *Silk Factory *Boutari Winery, Aidarinis Winery, Domaine Tatsis, Distillery Dimitri Kambouri *Two Rivers *Traditional mountainous settlement of Kastaneri ===Monasteries=== *Monastery of the Virgin Mary at Goumenissa (Est. 1100) Belongs to: Diocese of Goumenissa *Monastery of St. Nikodimos at Pentalofon (Est. 1981) Dependency of: the Monastery of Simonos Petra, Mount Athos *Monastery of St. Raphael, Nicholas & Irene at Griva (Est. 1992) Belongs to: Diocese of Goumenissa *Monastery of St. George at Anydron (Est. 1991) (convent) Belongs to: Diocese of Goumenissa ==Demographics== According to the Hellenic Statistical Authority, in 2001 Goumenissa was the town with the third largest population in Kilkis Prefecture, with an estimated population of 4,073. {  !District !2001 !1991 !+/- % - Goumenissa (Γουμένισσα)  align=\\"right\\" 4,073  align=\\"right\\" 4,163  align=\\"right\\" -2,16 - Griva (Γρίβα)  align=\\"right\\" 813  align=\\"right\\" 779  align=\\"right\\" +4,18 - Stathis (Στάθης)  align=\\"right\\" 418  align=\\"right\\" 465  align=\\"right\\" -10,11 - Karpi (Κάρπη)  align=\\"right\\" 400  align=\\"right\\" 391  align=\\"right\\" +2,30 - Gerakon (Γερακών)  align=\\"right\\" 286  align=\\"right\\" 350  align=\\"right\\" -18,29 - Filyria (Φιλυριά)  align=\\"right\\" 279  align=\\"right\\" 304  align=\\"right\\" -8,22 - Kastaneri (Καστανερή)  align=\\"right\\" 237  align=\\"right\\" 344  align=\\"right\\" -31,10 - Pentalofon (Πεντάλοφον)  align=\\"right\\" 191  align=\\"right\\" 231  align=\\"right\\" -17,32 - Omalon (Ομαλόν)  align=\\"right\\" 122  align=\\"right\\" 145  align=\\"right\\" -15,86 - TOTAL  align=\\"right\\"  6,819  align=\\"right\\"  7,172  align=\\"right\\" -4,92 } In Goumenissa live a population of 300 of Rom origin.

Astley's Amphitheatre was a performance venue in London opened by Philip Astley in 1773, considered the first modern circus ring. It was burned and rebuilt several times, and went through many owners and managers. Despite no trace of the theatre remaining today, a memorial plaque was unveiled in 1951 at its site at 225 Westminster Bridge Road. ==History== The original Astley's Amphitheatre, external view in 1777. Etching by Charles John Smith, after William Capon, hand-coloured. right The Amphitheatre opened in 1773 with The Wallet of Time. The structure was burned down in 1794, then rebuilt in less than seven months before being destroyed by fire again in 1803. The Amphitheatre was again rebuilt, this time in the style of rival Charles Hughes’s Royal Circus with lavish decorations and reputedly the largest stage in London. With increasing prosperity and rebuilding after successive fires, it grew to become Astley's Royal Amphitheatre and this was the home of the circus. The location of the theatre was Westminster Bridge Road in Lambeth.Astley's Royal Amphitheatre, Templeman Library, University of Kent The theatre continued to be popular long after Astley's death in 1814. His brother John succeeded him until he retired three years later, handing over to his partner Davis. This led to a renaming from 'Astley's' to 'Davis's' Amphitheatre. William Batty (1801-1868), perhaps best known as the owner of Batty's Hippodrome, acquired Astley's from Andrew Ducrow (1793-1842) in 1841, after the building sustained its third fire, causing Ducrow to suffer a mental breakdown and die in early 1842. Batty rebuilt the Amphitheatre entirely on his own resources and ran Astley's until 1853. During his tenure, Pablo Fanque, the black circus equestrian and circus owner made his London debut at Astley's in 1847.\\"The Illustrated London News,\\" 20 March 1847. William Cooke leased the building in 1853 and ran Astley's until 1860.Illustrated London News, 20 March 1847. In 1863 the Amphitheatre was turned into the Theatre Royal by Dion Boucicault, however it resulted in failure and left Boucicault heavily in debt. E.T. Smith succeeded Boucicault and provided Adah Isaacs Menken with her first London appearance in Mazeppa to \\"overflowing houses\\".Diamond, Michael, Victorian Sensation, Or, the Spectacular, the Shocking, and the Scandalous in Nineteenth-Century Britain, Anthem Press, 2003, p. 270. Its final owner was \\"Lord\\" George Sanger, who bought it for £11,000 in 1871 and ran it as \\"Sanger's Amphitheatre\\" for over 20 years. It finally closed and was demolished in 1893.Advert for George Sanger's amphitheatre, British Library Online Gallery, 26 March 2009. Accessed 10 March 2014. ==Building structure and design== After the Amphitheatre was rebuilt again after the third fire, it was said to be very grand. The external walls were 148 feet long which was larger than anything else at the time in London. The interior of the Amphitheatre was designed with a proscenium stage surrounded by boxes and galleries for spectators. The general structure of the interior was octagonal. The pit used for the entertainers and riders became a standardised 43 feet in diameter, with the circular enclosure surrounded by a painted four foot barrier. Astley's original circus was 62 ft (~19 m) in diameter, and later he settled it at 42 ft (~13 m), which has been an international standard for circuses since.\\"The circus comes to the Circus\\".

The organization was founded in April 2006 with the goal of increasing transparency and accountability in the United States Congress, the executive branch, and in state and local governments. The foundation's primary focus is the role of money in politics. The organization seeks to increase campaign finance regulations and disclosure requirements. ==Organizational overviewFounding=== The Sunlight Foundation was founded by Ellen S. Miller and Michael R. Klein because of their concern about the influence of money in politics. The Foundation was launched in April 2006 with a $3.5 million contribution from co-founder Klein, a securities lawyer and the founder of CoStar Group. At its founding, Sunlight's board was constituted of Klein, serving as chairman, Miller serving as secretary and treasurer, and Nicholas J. Klein, Klein's son. Sunlight's original advisory board was constituted of Esther Dyson, Craig Newmark and Kim Malone. Jimmy Wales, Yochai Benkler, Charles Lewis, Lawrence Lessig, Kim Scott, and Mitch Kapor later joined as advisors, with Newmark and Dyson moving to the board. ===Personnel=== Miller was the Sunlight Foundation's executive director from 2006 until her retirement in 2014. The first national director of the organization was law professor Zephyr Teachout. In September 2014, Christopher T. Gates was selected as the organization's new president, after the board conducted a search. Gates was formerly the chairman of the Colorado Democratic Party and executive director of Philanthropy for Active Civic Engagement and the National Civic League. In 2010, Matt Halprin of the Omidyar Network joined the board. In 2011, lawyer Andrew McLaughlin joined the board. In 2013, Stacey Donahue of the Omidyar Network joined, replacing Halprin. In 2014, Sunlight announced that Sue Gardner, Allison Fine, Mark Horvit and Daniel X. O'Neil would join its board of directors. Donahue subsequently left. In January 2015, the Sunlight Foundation restructured, combining its reporting staff with its communications team. As a result of the restructuring, three staffers left the organization, including managing editor Kathy Kiely, who was laid off. In June 2015, four more staffers left the organization. Niko Klein and Gardner left the board. In January 2016, Klein announced on Sunlight's blog that the organization was looking for a new chief executive, with Gates leaving the organization and John Wonderlich serving as the interim executive director. In September 2016, Klein announced on Sunlight's blog that Sunlight Labs would be shutting down and the board would explore potential mergers. O'Neil subsequently left the board. Klein announced on Sunlight's blog on December 16 that the organization would remain independent, with Wonderlich becoming the permanent executive director and Alexander B. Howard promoted to be the deputy director. Fine, Horvit, McLaughlin, and Dyson all left the board. In March 2018, Katherine Maher and Zoe Reiter joined Klein, Newmark and Wonderlich on the board. In May 2018, the Huffington Post reported that Clay Johnson, former director of Sunlight Labs, had been accused of sexual misconduct and mistreatment by multiple women during his employment at Sunlight and left after a staff insurrection. Subsequently, Sunlight's board announced that it would conduct a review of the organization's history. ===Awards=== In July 2009, the Sunlight Foundation received the Public Access to Government Information Award from the American Association of Law Libraries. In July 2010, the Sunlight Foundation won the grand prize of the Knight-Batten Awards for Innovations in Journalism for their Sunlight Live project that incorporates streaming video, liveblogging, social networking, and data presentation. ===Funding=== The Sunlight Foundation's donors include the Open Society Foundations, The Pew Charitable Trusts, the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation, the Rockefeller Foundation, the Ford Foundation, the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, the Omidyar Network, Bloomberg Philanthropies, and the Laura and John Arnold Foundation. ==Policy positions== The Sunlight Foundation advocates for more regulation and limitations regarding campaign finance. The organization opposed the ruling in Citizens United v. FEC, calling it \\"disastrous.\\" The organization supported the DISCLOSE Act, a congressional bill that would have enacted stricter campaign finance regulations by requiring increased disclosure of political spending in federal elections. The Sunlight Foundation believes that Congress should mandate real-time online disclosure of political contributions. It opposes dark money, or funds given to nonprofit organizations that are not required to disclose their donors. ==Activities== Demonstrators from the Sunlight Foundation outside Federal Election Commission offices as they discuss the application of Colbert Super PAC The Sunlight Foundation's past initiatives included investigative journalism, lobbying, activism and software development at Sunlight Labs, which was an open source community that collected and organized public data; Influence Explorer, which was an online tool for tracking money in politics; and Foreign Influence Explorer, which tracked lobbyists who represent foreign clients in Washington D.C. In 2006, the Sunlight Foundation provided funding to the Center for Responsive Politics to improve its campaign finance and lobbying listings and to the Center for Media and Democracy to oversee a joint project called Congresspedia. In June 2006, the Sunlight Foundation reported on Republican House Speaker Dennis Hastert's real estate investments, accusing Hastert of not divulging connections between a $207 million earmark he won for a highway and an investment he and his wife made in nearby land. ===Open House Project and OpenCongress.org=== In January 2007, the Sunlight Foundation launched the Open House Project, a working group designed to make congressional procedures more transparent. In February 2007, the Participatory Politics Foundation and the Sunlight Foundation launched OpenCongress.org, a site to track the full text of legislation and build a community to better follow congressional activities. Originally run by the Participatory Politics Foundation with funding from the Sunlight Foundation, in 2013 the Sunlight Foundation overtook operations of OpenCongress.org. In 2016, Sunlight retired OpenCongress and directed its community to GovTrack.us amid its \\"explor[ation of] alliances with other organizations,\\" with the idea of possibly \\"merging with one of them.\\" ===EarmarkWatch.org=== In October 2007, the Sunlight Foundation joined Taxpayers for Common Sense to launch EarmarkWatch.org, a project that asked citizens to research over 3,000 earmarks and identify the sponsors and recipients. In 2008, the Sunlight Foundation launched a project called Public Markup. The project crowdsourced ideas for model transparency legislation. ===Scout=== Scout was a tool to create customized keyword alerts that notify users whenever the subscribed issue or bill is talked about in Congress, mentioned in the Federal Register or comes up in state legislation. During beta testing Scout helped a coalition of transparency advocates oppose and remove a FOIA exemption for a bill. ===Call on Congress=== Call on Congress was a toll free phone number individuals can call to learn about what Congress is doing. The project hopes to bridge the digital divide by letting callers find out how their representatives are voting on bills and raising campaign money or connect directly to the lawmakers’ Capitol Hill offices and get details on where to vote on Election Day. ===Politwoops=== Politwoops was a Sunlight Foundation project which published an archive of thousands of deleted tweets by U.S. politicians. The project prompted Rep. Jeff Miller to delete his Twitter account after his tweet questioning President Barack Obama's citizenship was made public. Other incidents covered by Politwoops include a number of Republican politicians reacting to incorrect news of the ruling in the Supreme Court's case about health care reform, violations of the social media policies of the House of Representatives' Congressional Handbook by tweeting campaign information and six politicians who deleted tweets praising and welcoming home Taliban prisoner Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl after questions arose over the prisoner swap that freed him.

The relocation search tool was mostly powered by publicly available federal economic data that includes employment, salaries, average rents, and local medical and transportation costs. ===Churnalism=== The online Churnalism tool was launched in 2013 in collaboration with the Media Standards Trust as an open-source plagiarism detection engine. The tool allowed users to compare two sources of text to analyze similarities, but has been abandoned for lack of funding. ===Ad Hawk=== In 2012, the Sunlight Foundation launched a mobile application called \\"Ad Hawk\\" to identify political ads. Similar to many song identification services, Ad Hawk made an acoustic fingerprint based on audio recorded while a television or radio ad plays and compares it against a central database for a match. Ad Hawk would return information from a variety of sources about the candidate, organization and issues ads if a match is found. ===Events and contests=== In 2009, the Sunlight Foundation held the first annual TransparencyCamp, a conference where open government advocates met to discuss problems and solutions with government data.

The song includes the memorable refrain, \\"Well I heard the news, there's good rocking tonight!\\" The song anticipated elements of rock and roll music. In fact, some reviewers state that Brown's version, or Harris' (depending on the source),5 Candidates for the First Rock 'n' Roll Song is one of the contenders for the title of \\"first rock'n'roll record\\". ==Original song== Brown had first offered his song to Wynonie Harris, who turned it down. He then approached Cecil Gant later that night, but after hearing Brown sing, Gant made a 2:30 AM phone call to Jules Braun, the president of DeLuxe Records. After Brown sang his song over the phone, Braun asked Brown to sing it a second time. He then told Gant, \\"Give him fifty dollars and don't let him out of your sight.\\" Five weeks later, Brown recorded the song for DeLuxe Records. Only after Brown's record had gained traction in New Orleans did Harris decide to cover it. Harris' version was even more energetic than Brown's original version, featuring black gospel style handclapping. This may have contributed to the composition's greater success on the national R&B; chart. Brown's original recording hit #13 of the Billboard R&B; chart, but Harris' record became a #1 R&B; hit and remained on the chart for half a year. Brown's single would re-enter the chart in 1949, peaking at #11. Harris had a reputation for carousing, and sometimes forgot lyrics. His \\"Good Rockin'\\" recording session largely followed Brown's original lyrics, but by the end, he replaced the last section with a series of raucous \\"hoy hoy hoy!\\" interjections, a commonly used expression in jump blues tunes of the time, going back to 1945's \\"The Honeydripper\\" by Joe Liggins. The song is a primer of sorts on the popular black music of the era, making lyrical reference to Sweet Lorraine, Sioux City Sue, Sweet Georgia Brown, Caldonia, Elder Brown, and Deacon Jones. All of these characters had figured prominently in previous hit songs. The song has also been credited with being the most successful record to that point to use the word \\"rock\\" not as a euphemism for sex, but as a descriptive for the musical style, a connection which would become even clearer in 1954 when a version of \\"Good Rockin' Tonight\\" became Elvis Presley's second-ever single. While Brown missed out on the biggest hit version of his song, its success kicked off his own career, which included two #1 R&B; hits. In 1949, he released \\"Rockin' at Midnight\\", a sequel to \\"Good Rockin' Tonight.\\" It reached #2 on the R&B; chart, where it remained for a month.Roy Brown's \\"Good Rockin' Tonight\\" Retrieved July 2, 2012. ==Elvis Presley version== In 1954, \\"Good Rockin' Tonight\\" was the second Sun Records release by Elvis Presley, along with \\"I Don't Care if the Sun Don't Shine\\" on the flip side. Presley and his bandmates hewed closer to the original Roy Brown version, but omitted the lyrics' by-then-dated roster of names in favor of a simpler, more energetic \\"We're gonna rock, rock, rock!\\" Both sides of this second record featuring \\"Elvis Presley, Scotty and Bill\\" \\"stiffed\\".

(UK) in March 2018, covering home theater, audio, video and multimedia consumer products. Before 2000, it had been published for most of its history as Stereo Review. The magazine is headquartered in New York City. ==History and profile== Stereo Review was an American magazine first published in 1958 by Ziff-Davis with the title HiFi and Music Review. During the initial phase the magazine was headquartered in Chicago, Illinois. It was one of a handful of magazines then available for the individual interested in high fidelity. Throughout its life it published a blend of record and equipment reviews, articles on music and musicians, and articles on technical issues and advice. The name changed to HiFi Review in 1959. It became HiFi/Stereo Review in 1961 to reflect the growing use of stereophonic technology in recordings and broadcasts. In 1968 it became, simply, Stereo Review, reflecting the broad shift to stereophonic reproduction and simplifying the title. In the late 1980s, the magazine was acquired by CBS Magazines (now Hachette Filipacchi), and in 1989 it absorbed High Fidelity magazine. During the 1990s, consumer trends began to branch out into home theater matters and the magazine contents followed in kind.

In June 2009 Hachette Filipacchi sold the publication to Bonnier Corporation, the U.S. division of the Swedish Bonnier Group, along with four other magazines: Popular Photography, Boating, Flying and American Photo. In 2013, Bonnier sold it to Source Interlink, who merged it with its previously owned consumer electronics magazine Home Theater.Foliomag: In March 2018, Sound & Vision was purchased, along with related magazines and websites, by AVTech Media Ltd. One of the key features of the magazine was the permanence of its staff. Some staffers stayed for decades. One of them, Louise Boundas, rose from the ranks to become the magazine's editor from the late 1980s into the 1990s. Another, Julian Hirsch, was known for his technical reviews of equipment; he was involved with the magazine from 1961 until his retirement in 1998, nearly 40 years.

It played a wide range of mostly popular music intended to appeal to housewives at home during the day. Like many other BBC radio shows of the era of very limited broadcasting competition, it achieved massive audiences, and is very closely identified with the time in the public mind. == Theme == The distinctive theme music was \\"In Party Mood\\" by Jack Strachey. This music, much like \\"Puffin' Billy\\", the theme to Children's Favourites, has latterly been used frequently in other media as a signifier for 1950s Middle England, for example in a number of TV adverts and in the Comic Strip's parodies of the Famous Five, Five Go Mad in Dorset and Five Go Mad on Mescalin. == Conception and presentation == The programme was conceived by the Controller of the Light Programme, Norman Collins, who had heard a similar programme on Swedish radio. The show had a different presenter - often referred to at the time as a compere - every week who was a BBC staff announcer, contracted broadcaster, actor, comedian, singer or musician. Amongst the more than 250, mostly male, presenters were a number who made repeated appearances including Bryan Michie, Roy Rich, Godfrey Winn, Robert McDermott, Richard Murdoch, Gary Miller, Kenneth Horne, Sam Costa, Desmond Carrington and David Jacobs. One of the most popular was George Elrick, who sang his own lyrics over the theme music, beginning with \\"Dooodle-dum-de-doodle-dum\\" and ending with \\"I'll be with you all again tomorrow morning\\". == Cancellation and legacy == The programme ended when the Light Programme was replaced by BBC Radio 1 and BBC Radio 2 in 1967. Its short-lived successor, Family Choice, was broadcast on both Radios 1 and 2, but by September 1969, had also ended. In 1982, a radio series called When Housewives Had The Choice?, with Russell Davies, Maureen Lipman and Julie Covington, looked back over the Housewives' Choice years, and a spin-off album of the most frequently requested tunes was released. This 1980s radio show also produced a full set of lyrics to the original housewives choice theme tune sung by Julie Covington. The lyrics contrasted the austere life of a housewife in the 1940s to that of the affluent 1980s. There have been two one-off revivals of the programme on BBC Radio 2, in 1990 with George Elrick and in 1995 with Roy Hudd. ==References== Category:BBC Light Programmes Category:1946 radio programme debuts Category:1967 radio programme endings Category:British music radio programmes ","title":"Housewives' Choice"},{"id":"6204220","text":"Hayley Reide Peirsol (born August 9, 1985) is an American former distance swimmer.

It is played with two standard decks of cards, including four jokers, for a total of 108 cards. The jokers and twos are wild. ==Description== Each player is dealt thirteen cards. During each hand, the object is to complete the appointed run and kinds, and get rid of as many cards as possible. When one player gets rid of all of their cards, the cards remaining in the rest of the players hands score penalty points. The player who completes all twelve hands with the fewest points wins. ==RulesHands=== As in most rummy games, melds consist of either sets of equal cards, or runs of consecutive cards. Wild cards may be substituted for any number of cards in a set or run. There are twelve meld sets each player must complete as follows: # 2- 3 of a kind # 3 a kind, and 1- run of four # 2-4 of a kind # 2- runs of 4 # 1- 4 of a kind, and 1- run of 4 # 2- 3 of a kind, and 1- run of 4 # 1- 3 of a kind, and 1- run of 7 # 3- 3 of a kind # 2- 5 of a kind # 2- runs of 5 # 8 of a kind # run of 10 If a player is unable to complete the appointed hand, he must try again on the next hand. ===Sets=== A set consists of cards of equal rank – for example three threes or five queens. In this variation, sets may contain two cards of the same suit; i.e., two 9 of hearts. ===Runs=== A run consists of cards in sequence, the cards do not have to be in the same suit, such as 2-3-4-5 of hearts. Aces can be high (J-Q-K-A) or low (A-2-3-4) but not both (K-A-2-3). ===Wild cards=== Twos and jokers are wild and can be used to represent any desired card. ==Gameplay== The player to the left of the dealer begins, and the turn to play continues clockwise. A turn consists of drawing, melding and discarding. ===Cut-ins=== This is an optional rule. When a player sees a card he or she likes then they can ask to cut in and take the card along with three additional cards from the top of the deck. It is up to the player whose turn it is, to allow this or to take the card themselves. That player must also check if any others want it left of the one whose turn it is until no players want it that will go before them. Any player may cut in at any time between a meld and the next players draw up to two times. If he loses count none=11 cards; one=14 cards; and 2 cut ins=17 cards. ===Drawing=== There are two options: #If you want the top card of the discard pile, take it and add it to your hand. #If you do not want the top card of the discard pile, take a face down card from the top of the undealt stock cards. If the player has already played their meld set, he must draw from the undealt stock cards. ===Melding=== Once the player has drawn, he may place his meld set down if he is able. On subsequent turns, players may only add to existing melds, as melds outside of the prescribed meld sets are not allowed. He can, however, add to another players' melds. ===Discarding=== The final part of each player's turn is to discard one card from his hand face up onto the discard pile. The objective is to meld or discard all of one's cards, and the play continues until one player manages to go out by getting rid of all the cards from their hand. He must always end his turn by discarding. When discarding, a player may not discard a card if it creates a meld, (run or a set). If an opponent notices the error prior to the next player picking up, that player is permitted to remove the set from the pile and place it with their other melds. ===Scoring=== As soon as a player goes out, the hand is scored. The player who went out counts nothing for this hand. The opponents count the total value of the cards remaining in their hand. The value of the individual cards is a follows: {  border=1 - ! Card !! Score -  Each 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9  5 -  Each 10, J, Q, K  10 -  Each Ace  15 -  Each 2, Joker  50 } The value of their hand is added to their running total. The player that completes all twelve meld sets with the lowest score wins. ==See also== *Three thirteen *Ten pennies Category:Rummy Category:French deck card games ","title":"Dummy rummy"},{"id":"6204237","text":"20 Leonis Minoris is a binary star system in the northern constellation of Leo Minor.

His father, Reginald, was a highly regarded Shakespearean actor. His parents divorced when he was a boy, and his mother married Lloyd Wright, a son of noted architect Frank Lloyd Wright. Pole played both the guitar and viola, and received a degree in music from Harvard University in 1940. During World War II he performed in USO shows with Jane Lloyd-Jones, to whom he was briefly married. ==Anaïs Nin== The Broadway run of The Duchess of Malfi, in which Pole had a supporting role, had just ended in 1947 when he met Nin. They met in an elevator as both were en route to a party given by an heir to the Guggenheim fortune. He was 28 and she was 44 at the time. In her diary entry that evening, Nin noted his emotional sensitivity and knowledge of Eastern philosophies and concluded the entry with \\"Danger! He is probably homosexual.\\" Pole, who was under the impression that Nin had divorced her first husband Hugh Parker Guiler, asked Nin to accompany him to the West Coast. Nin agreed to do so, but told Guiler she was accompanying a friend on a drive to Las Vegas. Pole received a degree in forestry from the University of California, Berkeley in 1950 and joined the U.S. Forest Service. He and Nin lived a rustic life in a cabin in the Sierra Madre, where Nin introduced herself as Mrs. Anaïs Pole even though she was still married to Guiler. Nin and Pole were married by a justice of the peace in Quartzsite, Arizona, on March 17, 1955. She kept her marriage to Guiler secret from Pole for 11 years, but concern about the legal consequences of having two men claim her as a dependent on their tax returns led her to arranging the annulment in 1966 of the marriage with Pole. Nin remained married to Guiler, citing his decades of financial support, but spent her final years with Pole. She and Pole lived in a small house in Los Angeles' Silver Lake neighborhood that Pole had built with money saved from his job as forest ranger and later as a science teacher at Thomas Starr King Junior High School in Los Angeles. The house was designed by Pole's step brother and Frank Lloyd Wright's grandson, Eric Lloyd Wright. ==Nin's death== When Nin died in 1977, her obituary in The Los Angeles Times listed Pole as her husband, while the New York Times named Guiler as her spouse. Pole described his experience for the UK's Daily Telegraph in 1998, saying \\"I was jealous, yes. But I played the same games as Hugo, pretending to believe her. In a way, I did not care. My idea of marriage is different. We had a wonderful, deep relationship, and that is what counted. I was not interested in conventional women or in conventional marriage.\\" As Nin's literary executor, Pole was responsible for supervising the preparation of new posthumous editions of her works for publication from 1986 to 1996, restoring erotic content that had been made less explicit in the versions published while she lived. On Guiler's death in 1985, Pole scattered his ashes in the same place as Nin's, a cove on the coast at Santa Monica. ==Death== Pole suffered a stroke in 2006, and died in his sleep two weeks later, at his home in Los Angeles. For his obituary in the New York Times Nin's biographer, Deirdre Bair, told a reporter: \\"He was sort of a great cipher. He was stunningly handsome. Incredibly shy. And just very incredibly self-effacing.

For some time during the 1980s, Santiago was also a boxing promoter in Puerto Rico; several of his boxing promotions were televised locally. Possessor of an outstanding curveball, Santiago reached the American League in 1963 with the Kansas City Athletics. His contract was sold to the Boston Red Sox after the 1965 season, and he became a key member of pitching staff of the 1967 Red Sox, posting a 12–4 record with a 3.59 ERA in 50 games. He was largely a middle relief pitcher that season, starting only 11 games, and compiled an 8–3 mark in relief with five saves. However, he also made several important starts, including Game 1 of the 1967 World Series, which he lost to Hall of Famer Bob Gibson, 2–1, accounting for the only Boston run with a home run in his first World Series plate appearance. Although Santiago lost both of his World Series decisions to the St. Louis Cardinals and compiled an ERA of 5.59, he began the 1968 campaign in the Boston rotation, compiling a 9–4 record with a 2.25 ERA in 18 starts before an elbow injury ended his season. After that, he appeared in only 18 more games during 1969 and 1970, and never won another major league game. Santiago ended his majors career with 163 appearances, 34 victories and 29 losses and an ERA of 3.74. He also was selected to the 1968 MLB All-Star Game. In 1979, Santiago managed in a short-lived Class AAA circuit, the Inter- American League, as skipper of the Puerto Rico Boricuas. His club won 16 of 55 games (.291), ending sixth and last in the six-team league, and folded June 17. Thirteen days later, the entire league shut down. After he retired José Santiago became a long time play by play announcer for the Cangrejeros de Santurce of the Liga de Béisbol Profesional Roberto Clemente. He was also a Pro Wrestling announcer during the 80's. ==References== *Bucek, Jeanine, editorial director, The Baseball Encyclopedia: 10th Edition.

It runs from U.S. Route 60 (US 60) in Apache Junction through desert terrain to SR 188 near Roosevelt Dam. Following the Salt River for much of its length, the section east of Tortilla Flat is known as the Apache Trail and is part of the National Forest Scenic Byway system. The Apache Trail was built in the mid-1920s and the number 88 was assigned in 1927. An eastern extension of SR 88 to Globe was redesignated as SR 188 on August 20, 1999. ==Route description== State Route 88 at Tortilla Flat SR 88 begins at a diamond interchange with US 60, the Superstition Freeway, in southern Apache Junction. The route follows Idaho Road northward through a residential area with four lanes. Following a junction with Old West Highway, SR 88 turns northeast onto Apache Trail and narrows to two lanes. The route exits the city limits of Apache Junction, entering desert terrain. Passing a ghost town known as Goldfield, Apache Trail enters Tonto National Forest just northwest of Lost Dutchman State Park. SR 88 nears Canyon Lake south of the Mormon Flat Dam and follows a part of the southern coast of Canyon Lake. Apache Trail heads away from the Salt River. It passes through the town of Tortilla Flat, becoming an unpaved dirt trail winding eastward through the Superstition Mountains. SR 88 again turns northeast and nears Apache Lake. The route follows the Salt River northeast to the Theodore Roosevelt Dam, near which the route is again paved. SR 88 intersects with SR 188 along the coast of Theodore Roosevelt Lake. The highway is maintained by the Arizona Department of Transportation (ADOT), which is responsible for maintaining highways in the state, including SR 88. As part of this role, ADOT periodically surveys traffic along its routes. These surveys are presented in the form of average annual daily traffic, which is the number of vehicles who use the route on any average day during the year. In 2009, ADOT calculated that around as few as 400 vehicles used the route daily near the Roosevelt Dam and as many as 16,000 daily at the US 60 interchange in Apache Junction. The section east of Canyon Lake is part of the Apache Trail National Forest Scenic Byway system. No part of the highway has been listed in the National Highway System, a system of roads in the United States important to the nation's economy, defense, and mobility. Part of SR 88, known as the Apache Trail Historic Road, is one of only four state designated Historic Roads under the Arizona Parkways, Historic and Scenic Roads program. Following the Woodbury Fire and subsequent damage to the unpaved portion of the route, the road is closed indefinitely from milepost 222 to 229 until a plan to revamp the seven-mile closure is implemented. SR 88 is not a major route between Apache Junction and Roosevelt Lake and has a very low traffic count, so it is likely it is not a priority project for the Arizona Department of Transportation. There is access to all the Salt River lakes impacted by the closure. Canyon Lake can be accessed from Apache Junction while Roosevelt and Apache Lakes are accessed through Globe or via State Highway 87, south of Rye, Arizona. ==History== SR 88 highway shield upon designation in 1927. SR 88 near Fish Creek Hill The Apache Trail connected the Old Spanish Trail where Apache Junction is today and Roosevelt Lake with an unpaved road as early as 1925, following much of the modern route. By the next year, SR 66 followed the Apache Trail and the Old Spanish Trail was numbered as US 80. The number 88 was given to the route by 1927, but continued past its current terminus east to US 180 west of Globe. US 60 and US 89 became concurrent with US 80 at the western terminus by 1935, and the US 70 designation was added to the road by 1939. The section of the route from Apache Junction to Canyon Lake was paved in the late 1940s. By 1958, the section east of Roosevelt Dam was paved. The extra designations at SR 88's western terminus were removed by 1971, leaving only the US 60 designation. August 20, 1999, the section east of Roosevelt Dam was renumbered as SR 188, cutting SR 88 back to its current terminus. ==Junction list See also == *Apache Trail ==References *SR 88 at Arizona Roads 088 Category:Superstition Mountains Category:Transportation in Pinal County, Arizona Category:Transportation in Maricopa County, Arizona Category:Scenic highways in Arizona ","title":"Arizona State Route 88"},{"id":"6204258","text":"The Organ pipe coral (Tubipora musica) is an alcyonarian coral native to the waters of the Indian Ocean and the central and western regions of the Pacific Ocean. It is the only known species of the genus Tubipora. This species is a soft coral but with a unique, hard skeleton of calcium carbonate that contains many organ pipe-like tubes. On each tube is a series of polyps which each have eight feather-like tentacles. These tentacles are usually extended during the day, but will swiftly withdraw with any sort of disturbance. The skeleton is a bright red color, but is typically obscured by the numerous polyps, which are green or gray in color. In size, colonies can reach up to a meter across, while the individual polyps are typically less than 3 mm wide and a few mm long. They are restricted to shallow waters and tend to live in sheltered areas where they eat plankton. They are close relatives to other soft coral and sea fans.Allen, Gerald (June 20, 2001).

It carries out three basic roles, which are further subdivided into eleven statutory missions. The three roles are: * Maritime safety * Maritime security * Maritime stewardship The eleven statutory missions as defined by law are divided into homeland security missions and non-homeland security missions. Non-homeland security missions include: Marine safety, search and rescue, aids to navigation, living marine resources (fisheries law enforcement), marine environmental protection, and ice operations Homeland security missions include: Ports, waterways, and coastal security (PWCS); drug interdiction; migrant interdiction; defense readiness; and other law enforcement. A given unit within the Coast Guard may be carrying out several missions at once. For example, a RHIB assigned to maritime security may also watch for out-of-place or missing aids to navigation, pollution, and unsafe boating practices. ==Maritime safetySearch and rescue=== :See National Search and Rescue Committee Search and Rescue (SAR) is one of the Coast Guard's oldest missions. The _National Search and Rescue Plan_ National Search and Rescue Plan (USA) 2007 designates the United States Coast Guard as the federal agency responsible for maritime SAR operations in U.S. and international waters, and the United States Air Force as the federal agency responsible for inland SAR. Both agencies maintain Rescue Coordination Centers to coordinate this effort. Inshore rescues are usually performed by 25-foot, 29-foot, 45-foot, and 47-foot boats. HH-60 and HH-65 helicopters serve on both the high seas and inshore. Any Coast Guard asset in the vicinity of a case may respond. Search and rescue operations are numerous and varied. A sample of operations in February 2005 included: * Coast Guard Station Chetco River, Oregon, dispatched its rigid-hull inflatable boat with a crew and an emergency medical technician on board to evacuate a fisherman whose hand was nearly amputated in an accident. The fisherman's hand was reattached. * A helicopter rescued two recreational snowmobilers in Anchor Bay, Michigan, whose vehicle crashed through the ice. * Boats from Coast Guard Station Point Allerton in Hull came to the assistance of the fishing vessel Lady Lorraine, which was on fire off Scituate, Massachusetts. * Aircraft from Coast Guard Air Station Humboldt Bay, California, searched waters off Oregon for a missing light aircraft. Large-scale search and rescue operations occur less frequently, but often involve many Coast Guard vessels and aircraft from a large area. Helicopters and rescue swimmers participated in the 36-hour rescue of six crew members from the tanker Bow Mariner, which exploded and sank off of Chincoteague, Virginia, on February 28, 2004. Two rescue swimmers were awarded the Coast Guard Medal for their efforts to keep the rescued mariners alive. Another large-scale operation took place in December 2004 in the Aleutian Islands, when the cargo ship Selendang Ayu, of Malaysian registry, broke in two in heavy seas. The Selendang Ayu carried soybeans, 424,000 gallons (1,600 m³) of fuel oil, and 18,000 gallons (68 m³) of diesel. The operation saved 12 of the ship's 18 crew members and prevented harm to nearby wildlife. Six of the ship's crew members died when a Coast Guard HH-60 Jayhawk helicopter crashed during the rescue. Occasionally, Coast Guard rescuers are used in non-maritime situations. On January 11, 2007, the Toledo Blade reported that a worker who was dangling from a 110-foot (33 m) grain elevator in Ottawa Lake, Michigan, was rescued by a Coast Guard helicopter.\\"Coast Guard helicopter rescues man dangling from grain elevator.\\" Toledo Blade. 11 January 2007. ===Marine safety=== Coast Guard personnel inspect commercial vessels, respond to pollution, investigate marine casualties and merchant mariners, manage waterways, and license merchant mariners. Coast Guard officials also draft recommendations for the transit of hazardous cargo by ship, such as liquid natural gas. The Coast Guard carries out investigations to determine the cause of accidents on American-flagged (Flag State) ships or foreign ships in American waters (Port State). Among the activities of the Coast Guard is inspection of commercial boats carrying passengers for hire. Vessels carrying more than six passengers must show a Certificate of Inspection; this indicates the crews of such vessels have undergone drug testing, that the vessel's firefighting and lifesaving equipment is adequate and in good condition, and machinery, hull construction, wiring, stability, safety railings, and navigation equipment meet Federal standards.\\"Coast Guard to be on alert for illegal charter boats during pony swim.\\" Norfolk Daily Times, July 25, 2007. accessed 7-25-2007 The Coast Guard performs its marine safety mission by conducting the following activities: * Marine inspection: The Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection has field level responsibilities of the marine inspection mission. The two main components are Flag State responsibility and Port State responsibility. The four basic categories of vessels subject to inspection are Passenger, Tanker, Cargo and Special use vessels. There are two kinds of inspections: Safety and Security. * Marine investigation: Marine casualty investigation and personnel actions. * Waterways Management: Provides marine safety information to the public, and conducts marine event permitting, bridge administration and marine transportation system services. * Port safety: Prevent accidental damage to ports. * Merchant mariner credentialing: The Coast Guard is responsible for evaluating, certifying, and credentialing mariners that work on U.S. merchant ships. ===Recreational boating safety=== The Coast Guard, through the United States Coast Guard Auxiliary, along with the United States Power Squadrons, perform Vessel Safety Checks (VSC) on recreational boaters throughout the country. Qualified Vessel Safety Check inspectors check for proper registration, an adequate number and type of personal flotation devices (PFDs), loaded fire extinguishers, and the ability to send a distress signal, either visibly by flare or flag, or by radio. Although Auxiliarist and United States Power Squadron VSC inspectors do not have law enforcement authority, Coast Guardsmen can issue citations to vessels without adequate equipment, and in extraordinary cases terminate a voyage and order a recreational boat to return to port. Auxiliarists also visit marine dealers and retailers to ensure that an updated schedule of all public education courses and VSC stations with contact phone numbers is displayed at the marine dealer, as well as other Coast Guard publications on recreational boating safety and federal boating laws.Coast Guard's Marine Dealer Visitation Program guidelines retrieved December 30, 2013 ===Ice operations=== United States :See National Ice Center International :See International Ice Patrol A Coast Guard C-130 on International Ice Patrol in the Arctic Ocean Icebergs off the Grand Banks have always posed a problem for shipping. In 1833, the Lady of the Lake struck an iceberg and sank with the loss of 70 lives. Between 1882 and 1890, four more cargo vessels were sunk and 40 more damaged. Following the sinking of the in April 1912, an international conference of major Atlantic maritime powers agreed to fund USCG patrols to locate and report icebergs in the North Atlantic, in particular off the Grand Banks. The International Ice Patrol was founded as a result of this conference. The first ships for the International Ice Patrol were the U.S. Navy cruisers and , which were dispatched for the remainder of the 1912 season. The Navy could not spare ships for these patrols in 1913, and the Revenue Cutter Service assigned USRC Seneca and to patrol. The Revenue Cutter Service was tasked with maintaining the IIP on February 7, 1914. The IIP was continued into 1941, during the World War II, to allow the United States a legal pretext to sail to Greenland. In 1946, the IIP resumed operations flying three modified B-17 bombers and using cutters such as the . Today, this mission is carried out by Coast Guard HC-130 aircraft from CGAS Elizabeth City, North Carolina, forward-deployed to Gander, Newfoundland. These aircraft report sightings to the International Ice Patrol headquarters in Groton, Connecticut. Officers assigned to the IIP are required to hold not only a security clearance, but possess at least a master's degree in Marine science.Enlisted-Professional Military Education Study Guide, Requirement 3-5.02-K ==Maritime mobility== The Coast Guard maintains the DGPS radio navigation system, as well as buoys, daymarks, and other visual aids to navigation [ATONs] in U.S. waters and in selected foreign waters--a major activity of Coast Guard buoy tenders, and of special Auxiliary patrols. The Coast Guard has three large icebreakers, and many cutters can clear ice- clogged waterways for essential seagoing traffic. ==Homeland and maritime security== Maritime security missions are coordinated through the Coast Guard Office of Law Enforcement, which is part of the Operations Directorate headquartered in Washington, D.C. Immediately after the September 11, 2001 attacks, the Coast Guard imposed restrictions on traffic in American waters. Vessels over 300 tons displacement must file notice within 96 hours of estimated time of arrival in American waters, or 24 hours for short voyages. Liquefied natural gas carriers are forbidden to enter American waters without escort and to anchor near major cities. Coast Guard and Auxiliary units patrol key harbors and waterfronts and intercept foreign merchant vessels for identification and crew checks. The Coast Guard stepped up patrols in waters near New York City and Washington in 2004 after receiving reports of increased threats. Maritime security patrols increase in number and intensity around special events, such as the Super Bowl, national political conventions, and Independence Day celebrations. Such patrols were provided during the 2004 Republican Party national convention in New York City; the June 2004 G8 Summit at Sea Island, Georgia near Savannah, Ga.; and the January 20, 2005, presidential inauguration in the Potomac and Anacostia rivers of Washington, D.C.; and the funeral of former President Gerald R. Ford in January, 2007. In addition, following the July 7, 2005 London bombings, Coast Guard units were placed on a higher level of alert. Coast Guard helicopters enforce temporary flight restriction zones in Rotary Wing Air Intercept missions with the North American Air Defense Command, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and the United States Secret Service. Proposed assets As part of the Coast Guard's Deepwater program, cutters will carry 70 unarmed surveillance unmanned aerial vehicles. ===Port and waterways security=== The Coast Guard is responsible for the security of 361 U.S. ports and 95,000 statute miles (150,000 km) of waterways. The local Coast Guard commander has legal authority over shipping in American waters as Captain of the Port. This role has increased in importance since the Sept. 11 attacks. The Captain of the Port can declare inland waters in his jurisdiction to be \\"special security zones\\", wherein commercial vessels must report their movements to the nearest Coast Guard station. The Coast Guard has dedicated Port Security Units (PSUs) that can be deployed around the U.S. or overseas, as in the Persian Gulf War. Coast Guard PSUs from Seattle, Washington; San Pedro, California; Port Clinton, Ohio; Gulfport, Mississippi and St. Petersburg, Florida were called up for active duty in the Persian Gulf between December 2002 and December 2004. Coast Guard members also jointly staff the U.S. Navy's Naval Coastal Warfare Squadrons (NCWRONs), part of the Naval Coastal Warfare command structure. Coast Guard members assigned to NCWRONs have served in the Persian Gulf, the Balkans, Korea and elsewhere around the world. Both PSUs and NCWRONs are primarily staffed by Reserve personnel. Another element in security are Maritime Safety and Security Teams. In 2006, the U.S. Coast Guard's Ninth District and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police began a program called \\"Shiprider\\", in which a 12 Mounties from the RCMP detachment at Windsor and 16 Coast Guard boarding officers from stations in Michigan ride in each other's vessels. The intent is to allow for seamless enforcement of the international border.PA1 John Masson, \\"Territorial Teamwork\\", Coast Guard Magazine 2/2006, pp. 26-27 ===Drug interdiction=== A helicopter from HITRON pursues a go-fast boat during drug interdiction training. The Coast Guard is the lead agency in maritime drug interdiction. It shares legal responsibility with U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Coast Guard units coordinate their Caribbean Sea activities with the U.S. Navy, the Royal Navy, and the Royal Netherlands Navy. Coast Guard missions were responsible for about 52% of the cocaine seized by the U.S. government in 2002. For example, in February 2004, the USCGC Hamilton (WHEC-715), based in San Diego, California, operating north of the Galapagos Islands, seized of cocaine from a vessel. The Hamilton launched a helicopter that fired at and disabled the vessel's engine. Another vessel with of cocaine was also seized. The Helicopter Interdiction Tactical Squadron (HITRON) is based in Jacksonville, Florida. HITRON flew armed Agusta MH-68A Stingray helicopters from December 2000Ted Carlson. HITRON: one of a kind. Naval Aviation News May-June, 2004. until February 2008. At that time, HITRON took on the mantle of the Atlantic Area Deployment Center, and began flying MH-65C Multi-mission Cutter Helicopters (MCH). Since its foundation in 1998 and formal commissioning, it has participated in 157 separate go-fast boat interdictions. Posse Comitatus The Posse Comitatus Act and related policies generally prohibit the Department of Defense branches of the United States armed forces from enforcing U.S. laws, but these restrictions do not apply to the U.S. Coast Guard. The Coast Guard provides Law Enforcement Detachments (LEDETs) to U.S. Navy ships and the LEDETs do the actual boarding, interdiction and arrests with the assistance of the Navy. ===Alien migrant interdiction=== The Coast Guard, especially its Florida-based Seventh District, enforces U.S. immigration law at sea. Major areas of operations are off the Florida coast, the Mona Passage between the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico, and Guam. Many of these missions are also search-and-rescue missions, since many migrants take to sea in unseaworthy vessels. However, interdiction does not always succeed. In October 2002, for example, a 50-foot (15 m) wooden freighter carrying 220 undocumented Haitians ran aground near Miami. ===U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone and Living Marine Resource=== The Coast Guard is the lead federal agency for at-sea enforcement of U.S. fisheries laws. The Coast Guard's legal authority to enforce fisheries laws flows from the Magnuson-Stevens Fisheries Conservation and Management Act of 1976, which extended U.S. authority over fisheries to the 200 miles (370.4 kilometers) authorized by international law. Their missions include: # Protecting the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone from foreign encroachment # Enforcing domestic fisheries law # Maintaining international fisheries agreements ===Law and treaty enforcement=== Law and treaty enforcement account for about 1/3 of the Coast Guard's budget. Title 14, U.S. Code, Section 2 states: \\"The Coast Guard shall enforce or assist in the enforcement of all applicable laws on, under and over the high seas and waters subject to the jurisdiction of the United States.\\" ==National defense== During wartime, by order of the President, the Coast Guard can fall under the operational orders of the Department of the Navy. In other times, Coast Guard Port Security Units are often sent overseas to guard the security of ports and other assets. The Coast Guard also jointly staffs the U.S. Navy's Naval Coastal Warfare Groups and Squadrons (the latter of which were known as Harbor Defense Commands until late-2004) which oversee defense efforts in foreign littoral combat and inshore areas. In 2002, the Coast Guard provided several Patrol boats that were shipped to the Persian Gulf to conduct maritime interception operations in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. These ships became the core of a new unit, home ported in Bahrain, known as Patrol Forces Southwest Asia (PATFORSWA). In addition to the patrol boats, PATFORSWA serves as the supporting unit for other Coast Guard units deployed in the Global War on Terrorism. Numerous Port Security Units, Harbor Defense Commands/NCW Squadrons and Law Enforcement Detachments (LEDETs) from the elite Tactical Law Enforcement Teams (TACLETs) have also been deployed in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. In 2006, the USCGC Midgett (WHEC 726) deployed to the Pacific and Indian Ocean as part of the USS Boxer (LHD 4) Expeditionary Strike Group, where it cross-trained with the Indian Coast Guard cutter Samar. In July 2007, Coast Guardsmen, attached to the Maritime Safety and Security Team (MSST) out of Honolulu, Hawaii, and U.S. Navy Sailors, embarked aboard the dock-landing ship USS Harpers Ferry (LSD 49), took part of the Cooperation Afloat Readiness and Training (CARAT) 2007 task group to conduct visit, board, search and seizure (VBSS) training with the Republic of Singapore Navy (RSN) and the Singapore Police Coast Guard (PCG) July 20 at PCG headquarters on the former Brani Naval Base.Navy, Coast Guard Share VBSS Tactics with Singapore Peers ===Special forces=== * The Coast Guard is not a regular part of the United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM or USSOC). However, the Coast Guard does have a number of deployable specialized forces within the Deployable Operations Group (DOG). Additionally, in 2008 the Coast Guard announced a memorandum of understanding with the Navy and U.S. Special Operations Command which allows a limited number of Coast Guard personnel to train and serve as Navy SEALs. * The Coast Guard sometimes engages in the training of indigenous forces and joint operations, activities that overlap with the special forces.BOXESG, Indian Western Fleet Complete Malabar '06 U.S. Coast Guard International Affairs ==Expanded arctic operations== On October 25, 2007, a Coast Guard HC-130 from Coast Guard Air Station Kodiak, Alaska, flew a 2300-mile (3700 km) mission over the North Pole. This was the beginning of an expanded mission for the Coast Guard in the Arctic based on recently observed climate changes. Rear Admiral Arthur Brooks, commander of the 17th District in Juneau, stated \\"The primary change in the Arctic is that for 150 years we have done exploration and research. The change that we now must prepare to do all Coast Guard missions in the Arctic, including maritime surveillance.\\"PA1 Kurt Fredrickson, \\"Arctic Air\\", Coast Guard, 2/2008: 10-11 ==Protection of natural resourcesMarine pollution education, prevention, response and enforcement=== Marine pollution occurs not only through carelessness, but through accident. In the event of large vessels sinking, after the rescue of any crew, the Coast Guard's next goal is to prevent oil and other hazardous materials from coming ashore. This is performed as part of the Coast Guard's marine environmental protection mission. For example, on November 26, 2004, the Athos I, a cargo vessel of Cypriot registry, lost 30,000 gallons (114 m³) of heavy crude oil near Philadelphia as it was en route to the Citgo oil facility in Paulsboro, New Jersey. This incident triggered a response from the Coast Guard's Philadelphia Marine Safety Office, the United States Environmental Protection Agency, the New Jersey State Police, and from Citgo. The Coast Guard's role was firstly, to minimize the damage from the spill, by setting up protective booms around the spill, and secondly, to work with the New Jersey State Police in air and boat patrols to assess the damage. National Response Center :Operated by the U.S. Coast Guard, the National Response Center (NRC) is the sole U.S. Government point of contact for reporting environmental spills, contamination, and pollution The primary function of the National Response Center (NRC) is to serve as the sole national point of contact for reporting all oil, chemical, radiological, biological, and etiological discharges into the environment anywhere in the United States and its territories. In addition to gathering and distributing spill data for Federal On Scene Coordinators and serving as the communications and operations center for the National Response Team, the NRC maintains agreements with a variety of federal entities to make additional notifications regarding incidents meeting established trigger criteria. The NRC also takes Terrorist/Suspicious Activity Reports and Maritime Security Breach Reports. Details on the NRC organization and specific responsibilities can be found in the _National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan_.¾National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan (USA) 2007 *U.S. National Response Team *Federal On Scene Coordinator *National Response Framework ===Foreign vessel examinations=== Coast Guard leads multi-agency port inspections According to Title 33 of the Code of Federal Regulations, vessels entering American waters must provide in advance to the Coast Guard data about the ship's cargo, the names and passport numbers of each crew member, details about the ship's ownership and agents, and a list of recent port calls in a \\"Notice of Arrival\\" form. This information is collated in the National Vessel Movement Center in Martinsburg, West Virginia, and shared with U.S. Naval Intelligence in Suitland, Maryland as well as with the Port State Control (PSC) offices in major ports throughout the United States. From there, the Captain of the Port or his representatives in the PSC determines if the vessel involved needs a security exam, a safety exam, or both. Vessels must be examined every 6 months. In September 2002, Coast Guard Port State Control Examiners searched a container ship in New Jersey based on intelligence information and because the inspectors detected radiation in the vessel. The cargo turned out to be ceramic tiles.

She made a brief appearance on 7 May 2015 via webcam, and then made her full-time return on 11 November 2015, when she was kicked out of Dubai for an incident that happened to her there. ==Storylines== Nicola came to the village to meet her older half-sister, Bernice Blackstock (Samantha Giles) and stayed with their father Rodney Blackstock (Patrick Mower). She met and became friends with Emily Kirk (Kate McGregor). Within months, Nicola became interested in chef Carlos Diaz (Gary Turner), unaware that he was having an affair with Bernice. She chased him for a while before they ended up in bed after Bernice dumped him, wanting to make her marriage work. Scared she might lose Carlos, Nicola announced she was pregnant and was stunned yet elated when he proposed, which she accepted. Carlos and Bernice's affair (2001) On her hen night, Bernice caught her drinking vodka and Nicola admitted that she had lied about being pregnant. Bernice, who was herself pregnant, was horrified and insisted she tell Carlos before the ceremony. Furious that she would lie to him like that, Carlos told Nicola about his affair with Bernice and that the baby she was carrying could be his. Disgusted, Nicola attacked Bernice with her bouquet before storming into the church to announce that the wedding was off, due to Carlos's infidelity. She also told Bernice's husband Ashley Thomas (John Middleton) about her affair and the fact that he might not be the father of Bernice's baby. Despite her mother's suggestion that she go home with her, Nicola stayed with Rodney and eventually forgave Bernice. She became godmother to Ashley and Bernice's daughter, Gabby Thomas (Annelise Manojlovic). Nicola's once kind and friendly attitude altered dramatically and she severed ties with Emily but made up later. Nicola ends up having sex with sixteen year old Robert Sugden (Karl Davies) much to the annoyance of the village due to Robert's age. Nicola was bridesmaid when Emily married Paddy Kirk (Dominic Brunt) in October 2002. She argued frequently with postmistress, Viv Hope (Deena Payne), and local siren Chloe Atkinson (Amy Nuttall). She dumped Robert by allowing him to see her having sex with builder Syd Woolfe (Nathan Gladwell) in her living room. Nicola had a brief relationship with Syd, which ended when she discovered that he was also having an affair with Chloe, who was dating Scott Windsor (Ben Freeman) at the time. Simon Meredith (2003) After successfully starting a cleaning business and employing Pearl Ladderbanks (Meg Johnson), Betty Eagleton (Paula Tilbrook) and Laurel Thomas (Charlotte Bellamy), Nicola met fishmonger Simon Meredith (Dale Meeks) in November 2003 and after a bumpy start, they began dating. However, there were many obstacles, such as his ex-fiancée Tash Abbott (Sally Evans) and his mother, Lesley Meredith (Sherrie Hewson). Nicola was desperate to settle down and dreamed of the perfect marriage. After they got engaged, Lesley constantly caused trouble and even stole Kelly Windsor's (Adele Silva) credit card and eventually her debts began mounting up. This resulted in Lesley and Simon losing everything, forcing him and Nicola to postpone the wedding. Bored with Simon and their financial problems, Nicola tried repeatedly to seduce her half-brother Paul Lambert's (Matthew Bose) bisexual lover, Ivan (Daniel Brocklebank), who was mates with Simon. After failing, Nicola plied Ivan with alcohol and tried again, a moment witnessed by Lesley. Assuming that they were having an affair, Lesley told her son about Nicola's \\"infidelity\\" so Simon ended the relationship. Nicola was disgraced as she also destroyed Ivan and Paul's relationship, leading Paul and Rodney to disown her so Nicola left the village in March 2006. Nicola returned in September 2007 with a business proposition for David Metcalfe (Matthew Wolfenden). He owned what had been Laurel and Nicola's cleaning business and she wanted it back. Nicola claimed she was a wealthy widow and restarted her cleaning empire, threatening to put David out of business. After meeting him a few times, she returned to an unenthusiastic response. Nicola pursued David, despite him dating Jasmine Thomas (Jenna-Louise Coleman). Nicola and David slept together and Jasmine caught them so she ended things with David and exposed Nicola's lie that she was a widow, as Donald was alive. He was in a coma, following a brain haemorrhage. Nicola told Rodney and Paul that she had said he was dead because unless she could prove Donald's son, Miles, was still drinking, he would inherit Donald's estate so Nicola kept Donald alive until she had the proof she needed and then she would switch the machines off. However, Jasmine got Miles back on the wagon. On 28 December, Nicola was called to the hospital and was stunned to learn that Donald was conscious. He claimed not to remember her and spent the evening with Miles. Realizing Donald could make a full recovery, Nicola planned to murder him and asked David to help her but, disgusted, he refused to get involved and sabotaged her plots and told Donald, who confronted her on some local cliffs, giving her the perfect opportunity. Shocked, she confessed and even tried to save him when it looked like he could go over the edge. He agreed not to tell the police, providing she left his house immediately and David didn't want her either. Donald took Nicola out for a picnic where she attempted to murder him by pushing him off a cliff (2008) Rodney, unaware of this, rented Mill Brook Cottage and made it clear that she'd have to pay half the rent. She asked David for a job but all he offered was scrubbing floors. She worked for him briefly but went to work for Paddy as his chauffeur after accidentally injuring him, so he was unable to drive. Nicola spent most of her time with Rodney and attempted to become respectable again. When celebrity chef Anthony Worrall Thompson visited, Nicola tried to get to know him and was soon bragging that they were going to work together but was embarrassed when Bob gave her a message from Anthony's people, asking her to stop bothering him. In June 2008, Nicola started dog-sitting briefly. Rodney was unhappy about it but it was a way of earning money and Val Pollard's (Charlie Hardwick) daughter, Sharon Lambert (Victoria Hawkins), used her contacts to help Nicola get started as she had a friend that needed someone to look after her dog while she was abroad. David helped Nicola find some missing dogs one day and they reconciled after hearing Sharon telling a friend that she wasn't that interested in David. Nicola told Sharon and they had a fight in The Woolpack until David separated them and ended Nicola's dog- sitting business as Sharon was no longer prepared to help her get started but Nicola soon came up with another money-making scheme. Rodney had been trying to cheer Gabby up after she learnt about the baby swap involving Daniel and Arthur by telling her stories based on his fairground days. Nicola sold the stories to a publisher, claiming that her father was dead, and they were due to be published in March 2009 but Rodney found out and gave her an ultimatum - tell the truth or stop calling him Dad. She refused so he kicked her out. She moved in with Edna Birch (Shirley Stelfox), following brief stays with the Pollards and her brother, Paul and Katie Sugden (Sammy Winward). When Nicola discovered that Ashley Thomas' (John Middleton) boss told him that they were considering closing the church in late 2008, she and David planned to buy it and make it their dream home. However, there was a problem: the church choir. Nicola planned to ruin the choir by telling Laurel and Ashley she was there to help them but making the choir so bad, they would have no chance in a competition. In November, she changed her mind after becoming closer to her family and friends because they were impressed by her attempts to help the community. She focused her efforts on saving the church by helping the choir sing \\"O Happy Day\\". David and Eric discovered what she was up to and tried to sabotage the choir. They failed and the choir won a special recognition award so David and his father, Eric Pollard (Chris Chittell), revealed Nicola's original plan so she was shunned by everyone. Nicola worked hard to convince people that she was truly reformed and wanted them to succeed. She made headway on 15 December, just after the competition, when she was allowed to collect Gabby from playgroup. On 19 December, Edna asked Nicola to move out so her sister, Lily (Anne Charleston), could move in. Now homeless and alone, she moved into the church so Laurel took pity on her, asking her to stay with her and Ashley. On 25 December, after the Christmas Service, Nicola started a sit- in protest in the church to stop its closure with the choir in tow. They convinced Eric and David not to buy the church but the church was still for sale. The church was purchased by newcomers Mark (Maxwell Caulfield) and Natasha Wylde (Amanda Donohoe) who also bought Home Farm Estates. The villagers convinced the Wyldes to let them have the church and Nicola applied for the position of estate manager at Home Farm and got it when she impressed Natasha, rather than keep Rodney on, as she admired her determination. Nicola often struggled to stay within her boundaries as she was expected to be the Wyldes' personal assistant too. In February 2009, Nicola and Jimmy King (Nick Miles) drowned their sorrows in The Woolpack and carried on drinking in an Emmerdale Haulage van. They spent the night together and woke up to discover themselves en route to Hull. Nicola was horrified but Jimmy was more amused and they got a cab back to Emmerdale. Nicola asked Jimmy to hide when they saw David but he saw Jimmy and laughed at them. Nicola was embarrassed and rebuffed Jimmy's attempts at a relationship. After several weeks, Nicola asked Jimmy to accompany her when Mark and Natasha invited her to dinner. She thought their motive was much more personal but Jimmy was unhappy about returning to Home Farm and drank more than he should. Nicola, humiliated by the Wyldes, also got drunk and they spent the night together again. Nicola pushed Jimmy away but was intrigued when Rodney told her Jimmy may not be as broke as she thought. Thinking he had money hidden away in Switzerland, Nicola charmed her way back into his bed and convinced him that she cared about him, when he said he was going there. Jimmy guessed her true intentions and humiliated her by wining and dining her, then telling her that they were going to Switzerland in the haulage truck and telling everyone that she was a \\"gold- digger\\". Nicola was furious. In spite of the couple's rocky start, they were still attracted to each other so in order to make more room in the vicarage, Ashley's father, Sandy (Freddie Jones), and Laurel's father, Doug, wrote a love letter from \\"Jimmy\\". Nicola was moved by the romantic prose and visited him. After a passionate night, she told Jimmy she would move in with him, as this was what he had asked her. Jimmy was stunned but kept quiet as he didn't want to lose her but they argued constantly and after one row too many, Jimmy dumped her. Carl and Lexi insisted she move out so Laurel asked her to move back in with her. Nicola told Laurel on 8 May 2009 that she thought she was pregnant. Laurel persuaded her to do a test and a few days later, Nicola learned that she was 17 weeks pregnant. Shocked, she insisted the doctor was wrong as she was sure that she and Jimmy had always been careful, except the night they spent in the van. She considered an abortion and even booked an appointment but cancelled it after discussing it with Laurel and Rodney. Laurel also talked her out of putting the baby up for adoption, assisted by Lexi. Nicola returned to Mill Cottage with Jimmy and started looking forward to the arrival of their baby. Lexi King (Sally Oliver) was surprised that Nicola hadn't started thinking about the nursery so when her pregnancy was confirmed, they went shopping for nursery furniture. Unfortunately Lexi's pregnancy was ectopic and the tube burst, so it had to be removed. Nicola supported Lexi but tried not to be there too much, fearing that her now obvious pregnancy was making Lexi feel worse. She also backed her up when Carl King (Tom Lister) made excuses about not being able to go to IVF clinic with Lexi. Jimmy later told her that Carl had admitted that he didn't want any more children and was only going ahead with the IVF to please Lexi but Nicola warned Carl that he had to tell Lexi the truth or she would. He did on 3 August and Lexi told him to leave, which he did. Still angry, Lexi blamed Nicola when she tried to comfort her and pushed her away, causing her to fall down the stairs after a vicious row, leaving her unconscious. Horrified by what she'd done, Lexi called an ambulance and Nicola was rushed to hospital. Luckily, she was discharged the same day but went into labour a few days later, while locked in the farm shop. Luckily Rodney and Cain got her to the hospital before she gave birth to a baby girl, with Jimmy at her side. The little girl was put in an incubator and rushed away for further treatment, but Nicola and Jimmy are reassured by the doctor that their little girl is going to be fine, naming her Angelica. When baby Angelica was taken away for further tests, Nicola took a shower and the nurse gave Angelica to Lexi, who took her up on to the roof, just to show her the view. Unfortunately Nicola and Jimmy misunderstood what Lexi was doing and panicked. Lexi returned the baby to Jimmy and Nicola before having a rooftop showdown with Carl about their relationship. Nicola soon returns to work, putting Angelica into play group, and after seeing Viv and Bob Hope's (Tony Audenshaw) daughter, Cathy (Gabrielle Dowling), biting another child, Nicola bit her so Cathy would know what it felt like. However, Viv called the police and they pressed charges. A custodial sentence was possible but Viv wrote a letter to the court, asking them to show leniency as she hadn't thought the case would go to court so Nicola was sentenced to probation. In July 2010, Nicola and Jimmy considered buying The Woolpack, assisted by Jimmy's half-sister, Scarlett Nicholls (Kelsey-Beth Crossley), but pull out in September as Nicola fears she cannot cope with being landlady and a new mother. in February 2011, Nicola discovers Jimmy has been involved in an accident and is receiving treatment in hospital. However, on arrival, she is shocked to learn he has lost all memory and has no idea who she or Angelica are. Jimmy is persuaded by Kelly that she and him were having an affair before his accident and that he was ready to leave Nicola. Jimmy and Nicola split as Jimmy takes Kelly's side of the story and the pair get together, with the son Kelly tells him is his. Jimmy's memory begins to return and he sees Kelly's true colours. Despite this, Nicola is hurt that Jimmy has slept with Kelly, and refuses to get back with him. The pair prepare for a divorce but after an argument in September 2011, the pair end up in a passionate kiss. In 2013 Nicola wants to send Angelica to a posh school but when Jimmy tells her they cannot afford it she is loaned the money from Bernice's boyfriend Steve Harland (Tom Mannion) who is only too happy to give her it as he is attracted to her. A few weeks after Nicola and Steve are sitting in Steve's having wine and they kiss. Nicola quickly backs away and attempt's to leave but Steve stops her telling her that he enjoys spending time with her and what Jimmy and Bernice don't know won't hurt them. The next day Steve tells Nicola he has booked a hotel room for them and she considers going but after playing with Jimmy and Angelica she realises that she could never cheat on Jimmy but when she tells Steve this he tells her that if she doesn't sleep with him then she will have to give him his money back and if she tells anyone he will tell everyone that they have been having an affair and that she stole 10 grand of him. When she arrives at the hotel she tells him the best offer he is going to get is 1 night with her then they are quits, after she agrees he kisses her and try's to undress her just as Bernice walks in and reveals that Nicola told her everything but Steve tells them both that Bernice has been using him and that she isn't as special as she thinks and before he leaves the hotel he warns Nicola that \\"she isn't coming out of this squeaky clean\\" and she relies she will have to tell Jimmy everything before Steve does. The next day Nicola tells Jimmy that she has been borrowing money from Steve and that he has been trying to blackmail her into sleeping with him and Jimmy is furious, he goes outside and finds Steve and smashes his van up, after Steve tells Ashley, Rodney and Diane Sugden (Elizabeth Estensen) what he thinks of them Jimmy gives Steve a check for 10 grand but after Steve makes a nasty comment about Nicola Jimmy punches him and tells him if he ever sees his face again he will rip it off. Steve then leaves the village. Nicola and Jimmy's marriage becomes very strained over the next couple of weeks until Nicola is one of the people taken her brother-in-law's escaped killer Cameron Murray (Dominic Power) when she is free her and Jimmy reminisce. Jimmy and Nicola are still together even after she miscarries their baby and in 2015 she goes and works at the Atlantis hotel in Dubai when Jimmy and Angel were still in Yorkshire. She returned in November 2015 it was revealed she was deported from Dubai, she is shocked to see Jimmy has sold their house so breaks into it. In June 2016 Nicola gets caught in a fire started by Rakesh Kotecha (Pasha Bocarie). She is pulled out by Ronnie Hale (John McArdle) and Dan Spencer (Liam Fox) and taken to hospital. She discharges herself the next day and Jimmy takes her home. She later collapses and Jimmy calls an ambulance. She is told that she is partially paralysed and that she might never walk again. ==Casting== Nicola Blackstock was first introduced by series producer Kieran Roberts, who cast Nicola Wheeler in 2001. She arrived after getting in touch with her father Rodney (Patrick Mower). He had come to Emmerdale to get to know his older daughter, Bernice Thomas (Samantha Giles). In January 2006, it was announced that Wheeler had quit her role after five years on the show as she felt the time was right to try something new. Wheeler left in March 2006. In July 2007, it was announced that Wheeler had reprised the role and returned 18 months later in September 2007. In 2015, Wheeler became pregnant and took maternity leave. Nicola left screens in March 2015 and returned eight months later in November 2015. ==Reception== Nicola won \\"Best Bitch\\" at The British Soap Awards 2006 Nicola was also nominated for \\"Best Villain\\" at the British Soap Awards in 2002, 2008 and 2009.

They were an important ruling dynasty in post- medieval Karnataka. They initially ruled as a vassal of the famous Vijayanagar Empire. After the fall of the empire in 1565, they gained independence and ruled significant parts of Malnad region of the Western Ghats in present-day Karnataka, most areas in the coastal regions of Karnataka, and parts of northern Kerala, Malabar and the central plains along the Tungabhadra river. In 1763 AD, with their defeat to Hyder Ali, they were absorbed into the Kingdom of Mysore. They played an important part in the history of Karnataka, during a time of confusion and fragmentation that generally prevailed in South India after the fall of the Vijayanagar Empire. The Keladi rulers were Nayakas (Bedas) but they were tolerant towards followers of other faiths. The Haleri Kingdom that ruled over Coorg between 1600 A.D and 1834 A.D. was founded by a member of the Keladi family. ==The Nayaka clan== Chaudappa Nayaka, originally Chauda Gowda, (1499–1530), was from a village called Pallibailu near Keladi. He was the son of couple Basavappa and Basavamambe, who were into farming. He was the earliest chieftain to rule the area surrounding Shimoga, rose through self capability and acumen and was a feudatory of Vijayanagara Empire. Sadashiva Nayaka (1530–1566) was an important chieftain in the Vijayanagar Empire and earned the title Kotekolahala from emperor Aliya Rama Raya for his heroics in the battle of Kalyani. The coastal provinces of Karnataka came under his direct rule. He moved the capital to Ikkeri some 20 km. from Keladi. Sankanna Nayaka (1566–1570), succeeded Sadashiva Nayaka. Chikka Sankanna Nayaka (1570–1580) was an opportunistic ruler who took advantage of the confusion in the Vijayanagar Empire following its defeat at Tallikota and grabbed a few provinces in Uttara Kannada district. Rama Raja Nayaka (1580–1586) Hiriya Venkatappa Nayaka (1586–1629) is considered by scholars as ablest monarch of the clan. He completely freed himself from the overlordship of the relocated Vijayanagar rulers of Penugonda. Italian traveller Pietro Della Valle, who visited his kingdom in 1623, called him an able soldier and administrator. In his reign the kingdom expanded so that it covered coastal regions, Malnad regions, and some regions to the east of the western Ghats of present-day Karnataka. He is also known to have defeated the Adilshahis of Bijapur in Hanagal. Though a Virashaiva by faith, he built many temples for Vaishnavas and Jains and a mosque for Muslims. He defeated the Portuguese in 1618 and 1619.Portuguese Studies Review (ISSN 1057-1515) (Baywolf Press) p.34 Virabhadra Nayaka (1629–1645) faced many troubles from the start, including competition from rival Jain chieftains of Malenad for the throne of Ikkeri and invasion by the Sultanate armies of Bijapur. Ikkeri was plundered by the Bijapur army during his time. Shivappa Nayaka (1645–1660) is widely considered as the ablest and greatest of the Keladi rulers. He was the uncle of Virabhadra Nayaka. Shivappa deposed his nephew to gain the throne of Keladi. He was not only an able administrator; he also patronised literature and fine arts. His successful campaigns against the Bijapur sultans, the Mysore kings, the Portuguese, and other Nayakas of the neighbouring territories east of the western ghats helped expand the kingdom to its greatest extent, covering large areas of present-day Karnataka. He gave importance to agriculture and developed new schemes for collection of taxes and revenues which earned him much praise from later British officials. A statue of him and the palace built by him containing many artifacts of his times are reminders of the respect he has earned even from the present generation of people of the region. He destroyed the Portuguese political power in the Kanara region by capturing all the Portuguese forts of the coastal region.Portuguese Studies Review (ISSN 1057-1515) (Baywolf Press) p.35 Chikka Venkatappa Nayaka (1660–1662), ruled for a short span of time after Shivappa Nayaka. Bhadrappa Nayaka (1662–1664), succeeded Chikka Venkatappa Nayaka. Somashekara Nayaka I (1664–1672) The King who was once a good administrator, gave up his interest in administration after his association with a dancer named Kalavati. Bharame Mavuta, a relative of Kalavati slow poisoned the king which eventually led to his death. Keladi Chennamma (1672–1697) She was an able ruler who some scholars claim was allied with the Maratha Shivaji and later his son Sambhaji to defeat all rival claimants to the throne. She gave shelter to Chhatrapathi Rajaram when he fled from the Mughal army. Chennamma of Keladi is well remembered by local people through tales of her bravery. Basavappa Nayaka (1697–1714) He was a brave ruler and was adopted by Rani Chennammaji from their relative Markappa Shetty of BedanurA journey from Madras through the countries of Mysore, Canara, and Malabar Vol 111 – 1807 – Francis Buchanan -from page 254 \\"\\" Somashekara Nayaka II (1714–1739) Kiriya Basavappa Nayaka (1739–1754) Chenna Basappa Nayaka (1754–1757) Queen Virammaji (1757–1763) was defeated by Hyder Ali who merged the Keladi kingdom with the Kingdom of Mysore. The queen was captured by Hyder Ali and was kept in confinement along with her son in the fort of Madugiri.Advanced Study in the History of Modern India 1707-1813 by Jaswant Lal Mehta p.458 They were however rescued in 1767 when Madhavrao I of the Maratha Empire defeated Hyder Ali in the battle of Madugiri. Later, they were sent to Pune the capital of the Maratha Empire for protection. ==Decline and the end== For more than two hundred years the kingdom controlled the coastal and malnad regions of present-day Karnataka and fostered a rich tradition of trade with the English, the Portuguese, and the Dutch. However, in the period of gloom brought about by the fall of the last great Hindu empire, the Vijayanagar empire, constant wars—campaigns against local chieftains and the Mysore Kingdom and the harassment of the Marathas finally drained the treasury and resulted in the end of the kingdom. ==LiteratureKannada=== *Keladinripavijayam by Linganna *Shivagita by Tirumalabhatta ===Sanskrit=== *Shivatattvaratnakara by King Basavappa *Tattva Kausthuba by Bhattoji Dikshita *Ashvapandita by Manapriya. ==Architecture== Aghoreshwara temple at Ikkeri Rameshwara Temple in Keladi Mahisha Mardhini, a sculpture in the Shivappa Nayaka Palace and museum The Keladi Nayakas built some fine temples in Ikkeri and Keladi using a combination of late Kadamba, Hoysala, Vijayanagar, and Dravida styles. The use of granite for their construction shows they simply followed the Vijayanagar model of architecture. The Aghoreshwara temple at Ikkeri and the Rameshwara temple at Keladi are the best examples of the Nayakas' art. Vijayanagar-style pillars with hippogryphs are common; called yali columns (depiction of horses and lions as seen in Hampi) is found here. These are pillars with lions, either with their forepaws raised or simply in a sitting position, and pillars with a mythical horse-like animal with front legs raised, balancing on its rear legs, and with an armed rider on its back which are worth seeing at Ikkeri. A roof sculpture depicting a Gandaberunda, the mythical two-headed bird of Karnataka, is found in Keladi. Also, in the Rameshwara temple, a pillar sculpture shows Maratha Rajaram with Keladi Chennamma (history has it that Rajaram was protected by the queen when he was on the run from the Mughals). ==Religious tolerance== The Keladi Nayakas were Lingayats, patronized the religion, constructed numerous mutts and were responsible for the spread of Lingayatism to the Malenadu and Coastal Karnataka. There were sixty four mutts in the district of Dakshina Kannada alone. Nevertheless, they were tolerant towards followers of other religions and other Hindu denominations. The Keladi Nayakas invited Kazi Mahmoud who was a grandson of chief kazi of Adil Shahi kingdom of Bijapur to settle in Bhatkal. The revenue of Tenginagundi village was given to Kazi Mahmoud. The kazi family of Bhatkal is popularly known as Temunday Family due to the ownership of lands in Tenginagundi. Many Nawayath Muslims were appointed in the administrative positions. The families of these nobles Nawayath still use their surnames as Ikkeri and are mainly settled in and around Bhatkal. The Golden Kalasa on the dome of Bhatkal Jamia Masjid popularly known as 'Chinnada Palli' meaning 'Golden Mosque' is believed to be a generous gift from Keladi rulers. ==Gallery== File:Yali pillars in mantapa of Rameshwara temple at Keladi.jpgGranite yali pillars, Rameshwara Temple, Keladi, Shimoga District File:Yali pillars1 in Aghoreshwara Temple in Ikkeri.jpgGranite yali pillars, Aghoreshwara Temple, Ikkeri, Shimoga District File:Decorative pillar sculpture in Rameshwara Temple in Keladi.jpgWall motif, Rameshwara Temple, Keladi, Shimoga District Relief of Parrot feeding nestling in Rameshwara Temple at Keladi.jpgParrot feeding nestling in frieze, Rameshwara Temple, Keladi, Shimoga District File:ಸರ್ಪಬಂಧ.JPGSarpabandha, the snake chain File:Ikkeri 02.JPGNandi Mantapa File:Nandi (bull) in an mantapa with elegant entrance in the Aghoreshwara temple at Ikkeri.jpgMonolith of Nandi the bull inside the Nandi mantapa File:View of Nandi from inside the mantapa of Aghoreshwara temple at Ikkeri.jpgAnother view of Nandi Mantapa from the closed mantapa adjoining the sanctum File:Ikkeri 04.JPGAnother view of Nandi Mantapa File:Ikkeri 03.JPGAghoreshwara Temple File:Ikkeri 01.JPGAghoreshwara Temple File:Close up of elephant baluster and outer wall relief in the Aghoreshwara temple at Ikkeri.jpgside view File:Wall relief and perforated window detail in the Aghoreshwara temple at Ikkeri.jpgside view File:Granite_pillars_in_hall_(mantapa)_of_Aghoreshwara_Temple_in_Ikkeri.jpgRangamantapa, the stage for performance File:Nandi mantapa at Ikkeri Temple.JPGClose up view of Nandi Mantapa File:ಬಿದನೂರು೩.JPGBidanur or Bednore fort, Hosanagara File:ಬಿದನೂರು೪.JPGruins of Bidanur or Bednore fort, Hosanagara File:Aerial view of Kavale Durga Fort, Thirthahalli, Shimoga.jpgKavaledurga fort, Kavaledurga, Thirthahalli.

The headquarters of the Coast Guard is located at 2703 Martin Luther King Jr Avenue SE in Washington, D.C.. The Coast Guard relocated to the grounds of the former St. Elizabeths Hospitalhttp://www.uscgproject.com/ in 2013. ==Flag officershttp://www.uscg.mil/flag/ Flag Officer & Senior Executive Service Member Bios.Admiral=== Flag of the Commandant of the United States Coast Guard The commandant of the Coast Guard is the Coast Guard's most senior officer, who, by law, holds the rank of admiral. The commandant is selected for a four-year term, which may be renewed for additional four-year periods. The current incumbent is Admiral Karl L. Schultz, who replaced Admiral Paul F. Zukunft on June 1, 2018. Flag of the Vice Commandant of the United States Coast Guard The Vice Commandant of the Coast Guard is Admiral Charles W. Ray, who replaced Admiral Charles D. Michel on May 24, 2018. ===Vice admiral=== 150px 150px The commander of the Atlantic Area is Vice Admiral Steven D. Poulin. The deputy commandant for mission support is Vice Admiral Michael F. McAllister. The commander of the Pacific Area is Vice Admiral Linda L. Fagan. The deputy commandant for operations is Vice Admiral Scott A. Buschman. === Rear admiral and rear admiral (lower half) === There are approximately 48 rear admirals in the Coast Guard who are either in the rank of rear admiral or rear admiral (lower half). Positions held by rear admirals include the commanders of each of the nine Coast Guard Districts, the nine assistant commandants, and the deputies to each of the vice admirals. They are also located at Coast Guard Headquarters, Department of Defense commands, and other Coast Guard commands. The superintendent of the United States Coast Guard Academy is Rear Admiral William G. Kelly. The Coast Guard also utilizes members of the civilian Senior Executive Service (SES) to serve as executives within the organization. There are approximately 18 SES officials in the Coast Guard as of Fiscal Year 2017 . === Commodore (title) === The rank of commodore is no longer used in the Coast Guard. The equivalent rank used today is rear admiral (lower half). The chief elected officers of the Coast Guard Auxiliary are referred to as commodores, signifying their senior elected office, rather than a military rank. The title of commodore is occasionally granted to senior officers (typically of pay grade O-6, which is a captain) who are placed in command of a group or squadron of cutters. It is not a flag rank, but rather a title used to signify command of multiple units afloat. ==Senior officersCaptain=== Coast Guard captains, like their Navy counterparts, rank immediately below rear admiral (lower half). Coast Guard captains command most large operational units—sectors, large cutters, large air stations, integrated support commands, training centers and large headquarters units. Captains also direct most headquarters, area and district staff elements. Most captains have served in the Coast Guard for 21 to 30 years. By maritime tradition, the commanding officer of a ship is also called \\"captain\\", regardless of actual rank held. Thus, a young junior officer commanding a patrol boat is properly called \\"captain\\" even if his or her actual rank is lieutenant, or lieutenant (junior grade). This tradition has also carried over to many shore units. Occasionally, terms like \\"old man\\" and \\"skipper\\" are also used, though not usually in the presence of the \\"captain\\". However, in current usage, the person in charge of a Coast Guard or Coast Guard Auxiliary small boat is the \\"coxswain\\" (pronounced cok-sun). ===Commander=== Coast Guard commanders (Pay grade O-5) may head departments in large operational units or staff positions, or they may be the commanding officer of a medium-sized unit. The term commander is also associated with specific commanding officer positions, such as sector commander (usually a captain) or district commander (usually a rear admiral). ==Junior officers== The other commissioned officer ranks are (from most senior to least senior) *Lieutenant commander: Examples of positions held by a lieutenant commander include command of some Coast Guard cutters, executive officers of larger cutters, or departmental oversight positions at Coast Guard Sector commands. *Lieutenant: Examples of positions held by a lieutenant include command of small boat stations, command of Coast Guard patrol boats, and as operations officers or engineering officers aboard larger Coast Guard cutters. *Lieutenant (junior grade): Examples of positions held by a lieutenant (junior grade) include command of Coast Guard patrol boats, executive officers of patrol boats, small boat stations, or as assistant operations officers aboard larger Coast Guard cutters. *Ensign. Examples of positions held by an ensign include training billets as deck watch officers aboard large cutters, student engineers aboard large cutters, and staff positions at Coast Guard Sector commands. ==Chief warrant officers== The Coast Guard has three active ranks of chief warrant officers. Chief warrant officers are warranted officers and are promoted from senior enlisted ranks. The ranks of warrant officer (WO1) not used in the Coast Guard. Although authorized in 1994, the Coast Guard does not currently use or have any active CWO5 grade.United States Coast Guard. \\"USCG Rank Insignias.\\" United States Coast Guard. Department of Homeland Security. website. Retrieved on 8 October 2009. The three ranks in use are (from most senior to least senior): *Chief warrant officer 4 *Chief warrant officer 3 *Chief warrant officer 2 An example of a position held by a chief warrant officer is commanding officer of a small cutter, such as USCGC Abbie Burgess.Cornish, Caroline. \\"Coast Guard Cutter Changes Command\\". WCSH-TV, Maine. http://www.wcsh6.com/news/ar ticle.aspx?storyid=67328, accessed 7-31-07 A chief warrant officer is not addressed as \\"chief\\"; that title that is normally reserved for the enlisted rank of chief petty officer (E-7). The proper way to address a chief warrant officer is to refer to their title (CWO, CWO3) or to address them as \\"Mr.\\" or \\"Ms.\\" Due to the small and decentralized nature of the service, Coast Guard Warrant Officers often fill command roles. Warrant Officers may serve as officers-in-charge of Coast Guard Stations, or as Command warrant officers. ==Chief petty officers== As in the Navy, Coast Guardsmen in the rates of Chief Petty Officer (E-7), Senior Chief Petty Officer (E-8), and Master Chief Petty Officer (E-9), are collectively called \\"chiefs,\\" and serve as the service's senior non-commissioned officers. The Coast Guard is often found short of leaders therefore. Chiefs often can fill roles that would normally be filled by commissioned officers in other branches. Chiefs can serve as officers-in- charge of Coast Guard Stations, command or serve as engineering petty officers on smaller cutters, and act as department heads on larger cutters. Jason M. Vanderhaden is the current Master Chief Petty Officer of the Coast Guard (MCPOCG) and is the senior enlisted person of the Coast Guard and serves as an advisor to the Commandant. Like the Commandant, the MCPOCG serves a four-year term. ==Regional responsibilities - Areas, Districts, and Sectors== 300px Since most Coast Guard operations are domestic, the service has always been organized along regional lines. The Coast Guard's shore establishment divides the continental United States and its territories into two area commands-- Coast Guard Atlantic Area and Coast Guard Pacific Area--each commanded by a vice admiral. The area commands are divided into districts, each commanded by a rear admiral and responsible for a portion of the nation's coastline and/or inland waterways. Each district is further divided into sectors. Sectors are the primary organizational unit for many of the duties the public most closely identifies with the Coast Guard, such coordinating search and rescue missions and conducting law enforcement operations. Operational units report to various levels in this organizational structure. For example, small boat stations report to Sector Commanders while air stations report to District Commanders; both sectors and air stations are typically commanded by a captain. Cutters are not organized into standing fleets as in most naval forces. Instead, individual cutters report to shore establishment commanders at various levels. Generally speaking, the larger the cutter, the higher up the chain the cutter reports. For example, USCGC William Trump (WPC-1111), a Sentinel-class cutter based in Key West, Florida, reports to Coast Guard Sector Key West, while USCGC Thetis (WMEC-910), a larger Famous-class cutter also based in Key West, reports to the Atlantic Area Commander. Additionally, there are three major operational commands located outside the United States: *USCG Far East Activities (FEACT) is located at Yokota Air Base, Japan. FEACT also commands Port Security Unit’s which deploy to South Korea, helping to support U.S. Naval Forces Korea. FEACT helps inspects U.S. ships overseas and foreign ships that will be operating in the Pacific. FEACT helps by providing Maritime Safety, Security, Training and International Support.https://www.pacificarea.uscg.mil/Our- Organization/District-14/D14-Units/Activities-Far-East-FEACT/ accessed 09-2-2019. *USCG Activities Europe (ACTEUR) is located in Schinnen, The Netherlands. *Patrol Forces Southwest Asia (PATFORSWA) is based out of Manama, Bahrain.

Sectors were formed when \\"groups\\" were merged with what were formerly known as Marine Safety Offices. Coast Guard small boat stations are called Stations and report to Sectors. Each Sector Commander reports to the appropriate District Commander. ==Coast Guard Air Stations== Coast Guard Air Stations provide aviation support for other Coast Guard activities. Unlike small boat stations, air stations are not subordinate to Sector commanders. Instead the commanding officer of a Coast Guard Air Station reports to the appropriate District Commander. == Staff elements == 150px On July 23, 2007, the Coast Guard instituted a consolidated acquisition directorate, which handles major systems and future equipment acquisitions. It is the second- largest staff element at Coast Guard headquarters. Rear Admiral Michael J. Johnston, Assistant Commandant for Acquisition, leads the directorate. The directorate’s programs include all platforms and mission systems designed to modernize and recapitalize the Coast Guard’s fleet of cutters, boats, aircraft, and information technology assets. Under the new organization, these programs are consolidated from the legacy Coast Guard acquisitions directorate and the Integrated Deepwater System Program. The new directorate also brings together the office of procurement management; the office of research, development and technical management; the Research and Development Center; and the head of contracting.US Coast Guard Press Release. \\"Coast Guard establishes new acquisition directorate\\".

The municipal unit has an area of 312.717 km2, the municipal unit 45.775 km2. The municipal unit of Polykastro has 12,000 inhabitants, and includes Polykastro and 23 villages. It is built near the Axios River, on the road and railway from Thessaloniki to Belgrade.

There are two settlements from that era: in Axiochorion (Amydon) and in Limnotopos (Carabia). In the Bronze Age, 3500 to 3000 BC, Paeonians moved into the area. In Axiochorion was the capital of Paeonia, Amydon.\\"History of Macedonia I\\" N. G. L. Hammond, 1972In Greek \\"Macedonia: 4.000 years of Greek Civilization\\" Sakellariou, 1990 Paeonians from Amydon took part in the Trojan War as Trojan allies, with King Pyraechmes and Asteropaeus. King Pelegon was the one who led Paeonians from the northern valley of the Axios river to the southern valley, now called Amphaxitis. Paeonians also, founded the town Chaetae in Tsaousitsa, near Pontoiraklia. In the 19th century BC, there was an invasion from the east. The invaders were Pelasgians, later known as Crestonians, as they inhabited Krestonia, east of Amphaxitis. In the 12th century BC Phrygians came in the area. Amydon became the first place of iron treatment in Southeast Europe. Phrygians founded the town Baerus or Vairos near the village Kastro. In the 5th century B.C. Macedonians conquered Amphaxitis and by that time, the Area of Polykastro followed the rest of Greece. ===Roman and East Roman (Byzantine) times=== In Roman times, Amydon was completely destroyed. The settlement in the region was called Tauriana and belonged in 2nd Division of Macedonia, with Thessaloniki as the capital. During Roman times, 2nd century BC to 4th century AD, Gauls, Goths and Germans made incursions. In Byzantine times there were many wars with the northern tribes, as Avars, Vardars, Bulgars and Slavs and the area was severely affected. In the 13th century, the Byzantine Emperors rebuilt the fortress of Vairos in order to face the northern enemies.\\"Historical Maps of Europe\\" Centennia, U.S.A. 1992In Greek: \\"History of Modern Hellenism 1204-1985\\" K. Vakalopoulos, Thessaloniki ===Ottoman times=== In 1397 the area was conquered by the Ottoman Empire and Ottomans started a program of Islamification. Many people left the area to live in the mountains. The Ottomans called the town Karasouli. That name comes from the Turkish words \\"kara\\"=black and \\"suli\\"=swamp. Another interpretation of the name, is that the Ottomans named it after a local man who had dark skin and was originally from Souli, Epirus. According to Ottoman traveller Hadji Khalfa, the area was populated only by Greeks and Turks. After the 15th century the area relied on its agricultural economy. Many farm workers came from other places of the Ottoman Empire, in order to work because many locals refused to work in Ottoman owned farms. After the 16th century, many Sarakatsani arrived in the area from Epirus. During 17th and 18th centuries, Vlachs came also in the area, from Western Macedonia, removed because of Turkish/Albanian loots. It is remarkable that in the villages Evzoni and Korona, people used to speak a Romance dialect, called Megleno-Romanian. There are such speakers even nowadays. Researcher Maria Papageorgiou claims that a lot of plays of ancient Greek tragic poets, not preserved nowadays, were kept verbally, in this dialect, as tales. During the Greek War of Independence, people of Polykastro fought against the Ottomans in the revolutionary movement of Bogdanci, but were unsuccessful. The revolution continued in southern Greece. Mang fighters from Polykastro and nearby villages (such as Gevgelija, Bogdanci, etc.) went in Southern Greece to contribute. During the first provisional Greek government, a committee was established, called \\"Committee of North Macedonians\\",In Greek \\"The Cultural Identity of Greeks in Pelagonia (1912-1930)\\" Nikolaos Vassiliadis, Aristoteles University of Thessaloniki, 2004, p. 230 consisted of three members. One of the three members was from Bogdanci. After 1850, five Greek communities had been established in the region; in Polykastro, Axiochori, Aspros, Evzonoi and Metamorfossis and four Greek schools; in Polykastro, Aspros, Axiochori and Evzonoi. Two Greek churches and one school were built in the village, they are known as Agii Anargyri (Taxiarches nowadays) and Agios Athanassios.In Greek: Neoklis Kazazis \\"To Makedonikon Problima (The Macedonian Problem\\". Athens, 1907 In 1870 the railway station of Karasouli was established. Late 19th century and early 20th century the conflict between Bulgarians and Greeks in Macedonia led to armed collisions. A lot of local Greek troops were acting in the region of Polykastro municipality. Georgios Vegyris, Georgios Didaskalou and Christos Doitsinis from village Evzoni organised troops against Bulgarians. In the nearby village of Vogoroitsa (now Bogorodica, in the Rep. of Macedonia) act troops with leaders: Christos Dringas and Dimitrios Ouroumis. Also in Pardeitsa (now Prdeic, in the Rep. of Macedonia) the teams of Aggelos Athanassiou and Aggelos Dakos act. Those troops were acting in the whole area from Bogdanci and Gevgeli, to Polykastro, Aspros and Doirani.In Greek: \\"Modern History of Macedonia 1830-1912\\" K. Vakalopoulos, ThessalonikiIn Greek: \\"The Macedonian Struggle\\" K. Vakalopoulos, C. Nerantzis, 2000 In 1900, the ethnic composition of the town had changed with many Turks, Adyghe and Romani immigrating to the area. However, according to Bulgarian scholars, Bulgarians still comprised the majority of the population.Vasil Kanchov. „Makedoniya. Etnografiya i Statistika“. Sofiya, 1900, page.151. The ethnic composition of the village according to Vasil Kanchov in 1900 was 340 Bulgarians, 200 Turks, 12 Adyghe and 55 Romani people. The \\"La Macédoine et sa Population Chrétienne\\" survey by Dimitar Mishev concluded that the Christian population was composed of 312 Bulgarian Exarchists, 144 Bulgarian Patriarchists and 30 Romanis. Bulgarians maintainеd a school also, in the village in the beginning of the 20th century.D.M.Brancoff. \\"La Macédoine et sa Population Chrétienne\\". Paris, 1905, р.194-195. Another population data source could be found in Ottoman, Bulgarian and Greek statistics of the era. According to these sources them the population of the area of Polykastro municipality was 7,000 people, 1,000 of whom Greeks, 4,000 Bulgarians and 2,000 Muslims, mainly Turks. ===Macedonian Struggle=== The Macedonian Struggle of 1904-1908 aimed at liberating Macedonia from the colapsing Ottoman Empire and uniting it with Greece; several Polykastrins fought against Bulgarian detachments of the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (IMRO) and Turkish Armies. The Greek commander Georgios Karaiskakis from Bogdanca (now in the Republic of North Macedonia) and his troop were the main defenders of the area. Georgios Karaiskakis\\"Vogdantsiotis\\" was acting in an area from Gevgelija and Stromnitsa (now Strumica) to Doirani, Polykastro and Aspros. He was killed in a battle near Strumica against the Bulgarians in 1905.In Greek: \\"The Armed Phase of Macedonian Struggle 1904-1908\\" K. Vakalopoulos, Thessaloniki Michael Sionidis from Evzonoi was the most important Macedonian fighter against Bulgarians and took revenge for many assassinations of Greeks by Bulgarians. Georgios Koukogiannis from Metamorphossis with Asterios Demou and Lazaros Doitsinis from Evzonoi were defending their villages by Bulgarians. Konstantinos Argyriou from Polykastro with Traianos Antoniou and Demetrios Giovanis from Axiochorion were fighting and organising the Greek schools.In Greek: \\"Centers of Organising, Action and Resistance of the Greeks of Kilkis Prefecture During the Macedonian Struggle\\" Christos Intos, Records of Convention \\"100 Years after Pavlos Melas' Death\\", Company of Macedonian Studies (CMS), Thessaloniki 2004In Greek: Obscure Native Macedonian Fighters\\" Company of Macedonian Studies (CMS), University Studio Press, Thessaloniki, 2008 Finally Polykastro and the area was captured by the Greek Army during the First Balkan War in 1912. Most of its Bulgarian population was expelled to Bulgaria.Georgi Daskalov; The Bulgarians in Aegean Macedonia - Myth or reality; 1996; p.145 (in Bulgarian) The area became again an war theatre during WWI (Macedonian front). ===Modern times=== General view of the town Polykastro has witnessed the flow of refugees, from Syria and other countries. Refugees who had arrived on the Southern Sporades islands, and had subsequently been transported to Athens or Thessaloniki would then make their way to the border at Idomeni to the north of Polykastro, often passing by the town on the highway. After the substantial closure of that border in 2015, refugees started camping out, for example at petrol stations on the highway.

Until the beginning of the 21st century, most studies of Italian Sign Language dealt with its phonology and vocabulary. According to the European Union for the Deaf, the majority of the 60,000–90,000 Deaf people in Italy use LIS. ==Structure== Like many sign languages, LIS is in some ways different from its \\"spoken neighbour\\"; thus, it has little in common with spoken Italian, but shares some features with non-Indo-European oral languages (e.g. it is verb final, like the Basque language; it has inclusive and exclusive pronominal forms like oceanic languages; interrogative particles are verb final (You go where?). A sign variety of spoken Italian also exists, the so- called Signed Italian which combines LIS lexicon with the grammar of spoken Italian: this is not Italian Sign Language, however. Some features of LIS are typical of sign languages in general, e.g. agreement between nouns, adjectives and verbs is not based on gender (masculine, feminine, neuter) but it is based on place, that is the spatial position in which the sign is performed: nouns can be placed everywhere in the space but their position must be consistent with that of pronouns and verbs. The LIS translation of the sentence \\"The child speaks to the mother\\" appears as Child-here mother-there this-speak- that, rather than involving forms like \\"he, she\\". The voice intonation is replaced by facial expressions which mark interrogative sentences, imperatives and relative clauses. Other features of Italian Sign Language which can be found also in oral languages are: classifiers; dual, trial, quattrial and even quinquial forms in addition to the general plural; verbs inflected for person. The most detailed analysis of a part of the grammar of LIS is by Chiara Branchini, On Relativization and Clefting: An Analysis of Italian Sign Language.Branchini, Chiara. 2014. On Relativization and Clefting: An Analysis of Italian Sign Language Berlin: De Gruyter. Tesi di Laurea has described sociolinguistic features of LIS, including differences in use by gender.Tesi di Laurea. 2015. Slang terms in Italian Sign Language (LIS): a sociolinguistic perspective. Universita Ca’Foscari Venezia: Masters thesis. There are also some deafblind in Italy who use a form of tactile sign language.Checchetto, Alessandra, Carlo Geraci, Carlo Cecchetto, and Sandro Zucchi. \\"The language instinct in extreme circumstances: The transition to tactile Italian Sign Language (LISt) by Deafblind signers.\\" (2018): 1-28. ==References External links == * \\"Signs as Words\\", an introductory website on Italian deaf people and ISL * http://elis.eurac.edu Il primo Dizionario elettronico di base bilingue LIS-italiano (http://elis.eurac.edu/diz) * DIZLIS * The Grammar of LIS (.PDF) * Mason Perkins Deafness Fund * \\"Collana Cultura Sorda\\" (in Italian) This is the leading website listing of Italian publications for learning, teaching or perfecting Italian Sign Language, edited by the Mason Perkins Deafness Fund. * www.eud.eu Category:Languages of Italy Category:French Sign Language family Category:Languages of Switzerland Category:Languages of San Marino ","title":"Italian Sign Language"},{"id":"6204355","text":"The Inter-American League was a high-level circuit in Minor league baseball that lasted only three months before folding during the 1979 season. The league was conceived both as an official Triple-A minor league circuit and member of the National Association of Professional Baseball Leagues. It was composed of six clubs unaffiliated with Major League Baseball farm systems. The Inter-American loop was headed by Bobby Maduro, former owner of the Triple-A Havana Sugar Kings and a longtime scout and front-office executive active in Latin American countries and Major League Baseball. A 130-game regular season was planned, while the six teams were located in the United States, Panama, Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic and Venezuela(2). The league featured several well-known MLB veterans, with rosters averaging players between 26-29 years of age.Inter-American League page at Baseball Reference But the new circuit was barely able to complete half its schedule, fatally wounded by \\"under-capitalized owners, internecine rivalries among Caribbean baseball powers, tropical monsoons, and unreliable air travel.\\"Fun While It Lasted.com On June 17, 1979, the Panama and Puerto Rico teams disbanded, leaving the league with only four clubs.

They are even fuller, more finely textured and darker than the first set. == Structure == The Op. 39 set comprises nine études: * Allegro agitato in C minor — No. 1 :This quick-paced étude demands a tireless right hand, a syncopated left hand and considerable dexterity. Technically, the music is in an almost continual climax.Harrison, 207. It bears a resemblance to Chopin's Prelude in E minor. * Lento assai in A minor — No. 2 :Also known as \\"The Sea and the Seagulls\\". The work contains many musical textures that make it a difficult study in touch. It requires performers to restrain themselves and at the same time not sound monotonous. The technical workings of the étude are the 2-over-3 timing, the crossing hands, and large span of the arpeggiated figures for the left hand. This left- hand figure quotes the Dies Irae plainchant, one of the many works by the composer to do so. * Allegro molto in F minor — No. 3 :An incredibly complex étude, tone-wise. While it starts off with an angry, frenetic feel, there are moments of violent sublimity scattered throughout the piece. * Allegro assai in B minor — No. 4 :A charming gavotte, this étude contains a lot of harmonic color. * Appassionato in E minor — No. 5 :Possibly the dramatic peak of both the Op. 33 and Op. 39 sets, it turns passionate, tumultuous, despairing, and somber. It ends on a glimmer of hope, in the parallel major of E major. * * Allegro in A minor — No. 6 :This aggressive and daunting piece opens with threatening chromatic octave runs low on the keyboard, answered by quick, chattering treble figures that eventually transform themselves into a march. The music grows hectic and, having reached presto, sounds nearly out of control. The effect of the piece is seemingly mysterious yet fully unified.Harrison, 208. Referred to as \\"Little Red Riding Hood and the Wolf\\",Harrison pg. 180. the piece ends with the chromatic runs sounding as though the wolf swallowed Red Riding Hood whole.Harrison, 208–209. :This piece was originally the fourth étude of the Op. 33 set. Since it exhibits all the pianistic, rhythmic and harmonic features that characterize the Op. 39 set, it can be assumed Rachmaninoff revised this piece extensively before including it here. * Lento lugubre in C minor — No. 7 :This étude is a lugubrious march that transforms into a cacophonous blaze of the composer's much-loved bell motif at the end. * Allegro moderato in D minor — No. 8 :This piece is a lyrical and musical study of double notes. It requires precise pedaling, flexible and independent fingers, and agility. The piece has very long, defined legato melodic lines that are contrasted by a staccato middle section.Etudes-Tableaux book chapter * Allegro moderato. Tempo di marcia in D major — No. 9 :A dramatic, bombastic march to conclude this set, this étude contains ingenious counterpoint, lush harmonies, and a wide range of musical colors. == Recordings == * Another recording of the Op. 39 Études-Tableaux is by Alexander Melnikov on the Harmonia Mundi label. Other works are the Op. 38 songs and the Variations on a Theme of Corelli. * Rachmaninoff recorded Op. 39, No. 4 (piano roll only), and Op. 39, No. 6 (electrical recording and piano roll). * Evgeny Kissin recorded Nos. 1,2,4,5,6,9 on the RCA Victor Red Seal label, May 16 and 17, 1988, in Watford Town Hall. 7982-2-RC.

The Coast Guard employs various small arms including handguns, shotguns, rifles, and machine guns. ==WatercraftCutters=== Originally, the Coast Guard used the term cutter in its traditional sense, as a type of small sailing ship. Today it officially uses the term for any vessel which has a permanently assigned crew and accommodations for the extended support of that crew, and includes only and all vessels of or more in length.USCG Regulations . Chapter 10. Accessed 11 December 2006. Larger cutters (over 181 feet (55 m) in length) are controlled by Area Commands (Atlantic Area or Pacific Area). Smaller cutters come under control of district commands. Cutters usually carry a motor surf boat and/or a rigid-hulled inflatable boat. Polar-class icebreakers (WAGB) carry an Arctic survey boat (ASB) and landing craft. The Coast Guard formerly leased 179-foot Cyclone-class coastal patrol ships from the U.S. Navy. All are homeported in Pascagoula, Mississippi. These vessels were used primarily for counterdrug patrols.PA3 Brian Leshak, \\"CG Leases Navy Ships, Fights Drug War\\".

Any Coast Guard crew with officers or petty officers assigned has law-enforcement authority (14 USC Sec. 89) and can conduct armed boardings. 378-foot High Endurance Cutter (WHEC) , commissioned in 1967 (U.S. Coast Guard Photo) * For a complete list of cutters see: United States Coast Guard Cutter and List of United States Coast Guard cutters *Polar Security Cutter: The Polar Security Cutter Program is the program to replace the United States Coast Guard's aging fleet of icebreakers. *Polar-class icebreaker (WAGB): There are three WAGB's, all home ported in Seattle, Washington. Two are icebreakers ( and ), and one newer icebreaker, . *National Security Cutter (WMSL) (aka Legend-class) *High Endurance Cutter (WHEC): These are 12 Hamilton class cutters, along the waterline. Only 2 still in use, with 9 having been transferred to the Philippines, Bangladesh, Vietnam, and Nigeria. *: Mackinaw is a heavy icebreaker built for operations on the North American Great Lakes and home ported at Cheboygan, Michigan. *: Eagle is home ported at the Coast Guard Academy in New London, Connecticut. It is used for training voyages for Coast Guard Academy cadets and Coast Guard officer candidates. USCGC Eagle was built in Germany as the Horst Wessel, and was taken by the United States as a war reparation in 1945. *Heritage-class Offshore Patrol Cutter (Still in development) *Medium Endurance Cutter (WMEC): These include fourteen Reliance- class cutters, thirteen Famous-class cutters, and the . *179-foot Cyclone- class coastal patrol ships: All ships formerly operated by the USCG were transferred back to the navy along with one transferred to the Philippine Navy. *Seagoing Buoy Tender (WLB): There are 16 Juniper-class buoy tenders being commissioned. *USCG coastal buoy tender *USCG Katmai Bay class icebreaking tug *156-foot Sentinel-class Fast Response Cutter *110-foot Island Class Cutter (WPB): There are currently 41 110′ patrol boats in active duty service in the U.S. Coast Guard. Eight additional 110-foot patrol boats were extended to but structural issues developed shortly after these conversions and the cutters were deemed unsafe to operate. The Coast Guard the USCG was seeking a $50 million refund from Bollinger Shipyards. Six of the WPB fleet are assigned to the Patrol Forces Southwest Asia (PATFORSWA) in the Persian Gulf to assist guarding Iraq's waters. *87-foot Marine Protector Class Cutter (WPB): This is a class of patrol boats. *65-foot Small Harbor Tug (WYTL): This is a class of fifteen tugs used by the United States Coast Guard for search and rescue, law enforcement, aids-to-navigation work and light icebreaking. ===Boats=== USCG 47-foot Motor Lifeboat escorting Spirit of Ontario I Fast Ferry into the port of Rochester, New York on 2004-08-08 A Coast Guard Defender-class boat from Station Seattle enforces a security zone around a Washington State Ferry in Elliott Bay December 22, 2003. The Coast Guard operates about 1,402 boats, defined as any vessel less than 65 feet (20 meters) in length, which generally operate near shore and on inland waterways. The most common is 25 feet (7.62 m) long, of which the Guard has more than 350; the shortest is 12 feet (4 m). The Coast Guard boat fleet includes: *Arctic Survey Boat (ASB) *52-foot Motor Life Boat (MLB): The Coast Guard currently has four of the 52-foot motor life boats, a craft designed from the ground up to serve in challenging surf conditions. All four craft are currently assigned to surf stations in the Pacific Northwest. *47-foot Motor Life Boat (MLB): The Coast Guard's primary heavy-weather boat used for search and rescue as well as law enforcement and homeland security. *Aids to Navigation Boats (TANB/BUSL/ANB/ANB) *Transportable Port Security Boat (TPSB): 25-foot (7.6 m) boat, based on the commercial version of the center-console Boston Whaler, suitable for work in inland waters, easily transportable by trailer. These are primarily used by Port Security Units for force protection in naval support areas abroad, as well as, ports of embarkation/debarkation in expeditionary areas. Most recently these boats and units were deployed to Kuwait in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. The durability, versatility, and mobility of these boats make them ideal for this type of operation. :The Coast Guard planned to reduce the inventory of Boston Whalers because of the lack of interoperable spare parts. On Friday, July 13th, the General Services Administration approved the transfer of 10 Coast Guard boats to the Army in Iraq. The boats, 24-foot and 27-foot Boston Whalers with trailers, had an original acquisition cost of more than $800,000. The Army is looking for approximately 55 Riverine or Patrol style boats to conduct water interdiction, river denial and island clearance missions, troop transport and insertion on a regular basis; the Coast Guard is providing the Army with the Boston Whalers and one Ambar boat, a patrol type vessel.U.S. General Service Administration. \\"Boats Transferred to Iraq \\".

The SRP was removed from service due to multiple problems with its systems. It has been replaced by the over the horizon boat Mark IV (OTH-IV) *USCG Long Range Interceptor (LRI): An 11-meter (36 ft) high-speed launch that can be launched from the rear ramps of the National Security Cutters. *Response Boat-Small (Defender-Class): A high-speed boat, for a variety of missions, including search and rescue, port security and law enforcement duties. The original 25-foot boats built by SAFE Boats International (Secure All-around Flotation Equipped) of Port Orchard, Washington are being replaced by 29-foot boats built by Metal Shark Boats of Jeanerette, LA. *Response boat - Small II: A 29 foot replacement for the Defender Class, built by Metal Shark Boats A U.S. Coast Guard RB-M underway during testing *45-Foot Response Boat – Medium: The Coast Guard has signed a multi-year contract for 180 Response Boat – Medium (RB-M) boats that were delivered starting in 2008 to replace the 41′ UTB boats. These aluminum boats are 45 feet (13.7 m) in length, have twin diesel engines (total 1650 hp), are self-righting, have a four crew, six passenger capacity, are equippable with two .50 caliber machine guns, have an excellent fendering system, have a top speed of 42 knots (78 km/h), and are capable of towing a 100-ton vessel in eight-foot seas. The boats were built by Kvichak Marine Industries of Kent, Washington and Marinette Marine of Manitowoc, Wisconsin. *There are a number of Special Purpose Crafts (SPC), as follows:USDHS, USCG, Boat Management Manual: COMDTINST M16114.4B 18', 20' and 22' Airboats (SPC-AIR & SPC-Airboat), 36' Boarding Team Delivery (SPC-BTD), 52' Heavy Weather (SPC-HWX), 33' Law Enforcement (SPC-LE), 42' Near Shore Lifeboat (SPC-NSB), 24' Shallow Water (SPC-SW), 64' Screening Vessel (SPC-SV), 38' Training Boat (SPC-TB), 39' Tactical Training Boat (SPC-TTR) *USCG Auxiliary Operational Facilities: The Coast Guard surface fleet is augmented by privately owned vessels operated by the United States Coast Guard Auxiliary. ==Aircraft== A USCG HC-130 Hercules near Oahu The Coast Guard operates about 210 aircraft. Fixed-wing aircraft (such as Lockheed HC-130 Hercules turboprops) operate from Air Stations on long-duration missions. Helicopters (Aérospatiale HH-65 Dolphin, Sikorsky HH-60J Jayhawk, and Agusta MH-68 Stingray) operate from Air Stations, Air Facilities, and flight-deck equipped cutters, and can rescue people or intercept smuggling vessels. Some special MH- designated helicopters are armed with guns and some are equipped with armor to protect against small arms fire. The Coast Guard flies several aircraft types: *27 Lockheed HC-130 Hercules *42 Sikorsky MH-60T JayhawkHH-60J Jayhawk at GlobalSecurity.org *102 Airbus MH-65 Dolphin *11 HC-27J Spartan Out of 14 on order. *18 CASA HC-144A Ocean Sentry. *2 Gulfstream C-37A aircraft as a VIP transport for high-ranking Coast Guard and Homeland Security officials. *An unspecified number of RG-8A Condors. HC-144A Ocean Sentry (CASA CN-235-300 MP Persuader). The Coast Guard was to purchase the Bell Eagle Eye UAV as part of the Deepwater program, but this has been cancelled. The Coast Guard is currently preparing to launch a small UAS competition for the Legend-class NSC and future Heritage-class cutter. In addition to regular Coast Guard aircraft, privately owned general aviation aircraft are used by Coast Guard Auxiliarists for patrols and search-and- rescue missions.

Coast Guard radio stations cover a wide geographical area using very high frequency and high frequency radios. There are eight major radio stations covering long-range transmissions and an extensive network of VHF radio stations along the nation's coastline and inland rivers. The current communication system is the Rescue 21. Rescue 21 is an advanced maritime command, control, and communications (C3) system. The OMEGA navigation system and the LORAN-C transmitters outside the USA were run until 1994 also by the United States Coast Guard, and LORAN-C transmitters within the US were decommissioned on June 1, 2010, with the exception of 5 CONUS LORAN-C stations that continue to be manned due to international agreements. ==See also== * Equipment of the United States Army * Equipment of the United States Air Force * Equipment of the United States Navy * Equipment of the United States Marine Corps == References == Category:United States Coast Guard ","title":"List of equipment of the United States Coast Guard"},{"id":"6204408","text":"Livadia (, ) is a village and a former community in the former Paionia Province, Kilkis regional unit, Greece.

During his lifetime, Sørnes also designed and built a large variety of agricultural, radio-technical and mechanical devices, only a few of them patented. == Early life and education == Rasmus Sørnes was born in Sola in Norway on March 22, 1893 from a mediocre background, his parents were farmers with limited resources. He was the oldest of four brothers and one sister. His mother died shortly after the birth of the sister, and his father brought up the children by himself. According to his sister, he was already as a young boy very creative and industrious, at least when it came to his own ideas. He was less eager if he had to work with ideas from other, and it often happened that he skipped school for a day or two if he was working on something interesting. In spite of this, his grades were very good. After finishing elementary school, Sørnes applied to be a watchmaker apprentice in Stavanger, but got rejected with the explanation that he was a farmer son with big hands and lumpy fingers. The bitterness over being rejected followed him throughout his life. Instead, he started his career at a bicycle factory, assembling bikes. The job was boring and repetitious and he only lasted six months. The next job was in a mechanical workshop in Stavanger, where he stayed for about a year. 18 or 19 years old, he got hired as an electrician apprentice, which in two years yielded him a certificate as a fully educated electrician. Although he received his Certificate as an electrician at Stavanger Technical School, he was a man of modest education, but was self- taught in a variety of scientific trades and technological disciplines, including advanced mathematics, physics, and astronomy. He enjoyed frequent collaboration with the university research communities. He lectured lens- making to optics students and clockmaking to watchmaker students, though he had formal education in neither. == Early career == As a child, he designed and constructed an electrically driven water pump with level indicator to be used at his parents' farm. In 1910, he designed and built his own four-stroke combustion engine complete with electric initiation and water-cooling system, constructed a turbine power plant. In 1926 built a tractor after his own design, which he based on the German Adler auto-mobile. His tractor, which was meant for use on the family farm, was more advanced and efficient than the Moline tractors available in Jæren at the time. He patented a chicken incubator and a milk/cream separator. In 1913 he patented corrugated diaphragms in loudspeakers for better sound quality. While commercial industry was uninterested in this feature for the lifetime of the patent, this has in modern times become standard in loudspeaker design. === As a radio technician === In 1922 he was employed as a technician at the local Ullandhaug Radio Station, and the same year he started his own radio station called \\"Radio Grannes\\" which broadcast every night from 18.00 until 20.00, two years after the BBC began broadcasting in 1920, and three years before the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation began its regular broadcasts in 1925. During the broadcasts, he would read news, and his wife would sing. To make sure he got listeners, he supplied friends and neighbours with receivers. His private station was later shut down by the manager of the power company as he was afraid that the radio station uncontrollably drained off the electricity out into the air. In 1931, the radiostation where he worked was moved to the island of Jeløy, in south-east Norway. In the midst of the Great Depression, unemployment was considerable at this time and the entire staff had few options but to move along with their employer. Sørnes built a new house on the island and brought his family there one year later. The house had a lightning conductor, alarm system, radio mast and a house phone to his new workshop in the garden. During World War II, he built another radio transmitter for the purpose of clandestine communication, based on his earlier device. The radio he built during the war, was later described as \\"a masterpiece of technical elegance and intelligent camouflage\\" by historians. The radio itself is on display in the Norwegian Museum of Science and Technology () in Oslo. In 1945, the exhibition \\"The illicit Norway\\" displayed Sørnes' radio as an example of an ingenious solution. He designed the first automatic model railway in Norway, to be used in a shop window exhibition, and a solar-cell-powered radio-controlled engine for lighthouses. == Clockmaking == Throughout his life, although trained as an electrician and employed as a radio technician, watches and clocks were always his great fascination. He created four astronomical clocks, with the first two described by himself as \\"test objects\\", and the last two his masterpieces. === The \\"Clock No. 1\\" === In the 1937 he constructed his first astronomical clock, showing standard and Greenwich time, all solar and lunar cycles and phases, the Julian calendar, high and low tides and sunset/sunrise. The firmament is visualized on a two- dimensional dial, holes are drilled for the larger stars and the dial is illuminated from behind to make the stars visible in the evening. A switch allows the clock to be run forward and backwards in time. The clock is controlled by Sørnes' own invention, an electromagnetic balance wheel escapement. It feeds the system with a constant revolution of one rotation per second and is in this clock powered by two 1.5 V batteries. He experimented with the escapement for many years but eventually resorted to more traditional solutions. The accuracy of the celestial orbits suffered as the calculations were based on regular calendars without full correction of the irregularities. Around at the same time he designed and constructed a large reflecting telescope. === The \\"Clock No. 2\\" === Immediately after finishing clock No. 1, Rasmus Sørnes started working on clock No. 2. It is larger than the first one, but still a mantelpiece clock size. Not much is known about this clock, as it was never fully completed. It is functioning, but without any finish or decoration. Already during construction of this clock, Sørnes started outlining a larger clock. It seems that clock No. 2 became too small to incorporate all the features he wanted, too inaccurate, or simply too crowded for the necessary maintenance. A perfect astronomical clock must have a perpetual calendar, for example a Gregorian calendar, which is not found in this clock. It incorporates the Julian calendar, which gains 1 day in 128 years. This might sound more than sufficiently accurate for a man's lifetime, but as seen in clock No. 1, Sørnes wanted to be able to run his clocks forwards and backward in time to examine previous and coming events. Another shortcoming is that the sidereal works will slow down 1 minute in 10 years. On the other hand, the error for the Earth's rotation around the sun is only 0.7 seconds per year. This can be compared to the famous astronomical clock in Strasbourg, which has an error of maximum 2 seconds per year. This clock is currently on display at Borgarsyssel Museum in Sarpsborg, Norway. === The \\"Clock No. 3\\" === Clock No. 3 Rasmus Sørnes steadily kept improving his design and adding even more features, and in 1954, the 3rd clock was finished. The gear trains from the two previous clocks have been revised for improved accuracy, several correction works have been added to make up for irregularities in the celestial orbits, and most importantly, the precession of the equinoxes has been taken into account. The base of the clock contains a tape recorder, with recordings of Rasmus Sørnes' voice describing the features of the clock. The clock's astronomical part may be driven forwards and backwards at a speed of eight days per minute. The large dial in the middle of the front has a fixed Zodiac and two hands showing the position of the Sun and the Moon on the ecliptic circle. The Sun hand makes one revolution every year, and the Moon hand one revolution every 29.5 day. This dial also shows when and where solar and lunar eclipses occur. The orbit of the Moon has an inclination of 5° with regard to the ecliptic, so solar or lunar eclipses can only occur when the Sun and the Moon are simultaneously located at one of the crossings of the two orbits. These two crossings rotate once in 18.5 years (known as the Saros cycle) and are indicated by the hand with the Ω (omega) sign. Eclipses occur when the three hands overlap, which typically happens two or three times a year; they overlap in nearly exactly the same position every 18.5 years. In the centre of the dial, a spherical slice of the Earth is located. It rotates counter-clockwise once in a sidereal day, and is used to indicate where the eclipse is visible. At the bottom of the clock, two globes are located. The terrestrial globe rotates once per day, and the arc shows the division between day and night. The celestial globe shows the stars as they would appear if projected on a sphere surrounding the Earth. It rotates once in a sidereal day, but it also rotates around a second axis once in 25,800 years because of the precession of the equinoxes. To achieve this, a gear train with a ratio of 1:9,500,000 is required. This globe is illuminated from inside, and holes are drilled for the larger stars. This clock is on display at Borgarsyssel Museum, Sarpsborg, Norway. However, during 2013 it was stored away while the building was being renovated. === The \\"Clock No. 4\\" === Sørnes' Clock No. 4 The principal design of gear trains and transmissions is similar to his fourth and final clock, arguably the most complicated of its kind, which was finished in 1967. It was made in his spare time, with his own funding, and using his own self-made tools. The clock was exhibited at the Time Museum in Rockford, Illinois beginning in 1967. In 1999, it was transferred to Chicago Museum of Science and Technology for display, until sold to an anonymous bidder at an auction at Sotheby's in London in 2002, and its location is currently unknown. The clock No. 4, also called \\"the Sørnes Clock\\" () is a magnificent fusion of art, craftsmanship, and electromechanical technology, engraved and with gold and silver plating. Every part of the clock was handmade in his workshop with the sole exception of the pendulum itself; Sørnes also devised and hand- crafted the tools required to make the clock. Its astounding features include: locations of the sun and moon in the zodiac, Julian calendar, Gregorian calendar, sidereal time, Greenwich mean time, local time with daylight saving time and leap year, solar and lunar cycle corrections, eclipses, local sunset and sunrise, moon phases, high and low tides, sunspot cycles and a complete planetarium including Pluto's 248 year orbit and the 25,800 year period of the polar ecliptics (precession of the Earth's axis). It has a high degree of accuracy, having an error of only 7 seconds per 1000 years. While the previous clock No. 3 is technologically advanced and very impressive, it still can be improved when it comes to the appearance, as half of the clock consists of a cabinet that resembles a fusebox. Science and art are all too often regarded as opposites, but as the work of Leonardo da Vinci shows, when combined, remarkable results can be achieved. It might have been this beauty spot that Rasmus Sørnes wanted to address when he started working on clock No. 4, which has the same principle design, gear trains and transmissions as clock No. 3, but a very different look.

A terrace is an external, raised, open, flat area in either a landscape (such as a park or garden) near a building, or as a roof terrace on a flat roof. ==Ground terraces== Terraces are used primarily for leisure activity such as sitting, strolling, or resting.Davies, Nicholas and Jokiniemi, Erkki. Dictionary of Architecture and Building Construction. New York: Routledge, 2008, p. 379. The term often applies to a raised area in front of a monumental building or structure, which is usually reached by a grand staircase and surrounded by a balustrade. A terrace may be supported by an embankment or solid foundation, either natural or man-made.Harris, Cyril M. Illustrated Dictionary of Historic Architecture. New York: Dover Publications, 1977, p. 529. Terraces may also be platforms, supported by columns but without the space below filled in, but terraces are always open to the sky and may or may not be paved.Ching, Frank. A Visual Dictionary of Architecture. Hoboken, N.J.: Wiley, 2012, p. 17. ===History and examples of terraces=== Agricultural terracing can be traced back to prehistoric times, but architectural terracing is equally ancient. Examples of early architectural terracing in the Middle East have been found at Nahal Oren (a Natufian cultural site occupied between 13000 and 9834 BCE), at Tel Yarmut (2700 to 2200 BCE), and at Tel el-'Umeiri (600 BCE).Gibson, Shimon. \\"Agricultural Terraces and Settlement Expansion in the Highlands of Early Iron Age Palestine: Is There Any Correlation Between the Two?\\" In Studies in the Archaeology of the Iron Age in Israel and Jordan. Amihay Mazar and Ginny Mathias, eds. Sheffield, England: Sheffield Academic Press, 2001, p. 129-130. Architectural terracing was widespread globally. For example, architectural (rather than agricultural) terracing also occurred on the island of Babeldaob in modern Palau in the Pacific Ocean.Morgan, William N. and Morgan, Newton. Prehistoric Architecture in Micronesia. Austin, Tex.: University of Texas Press, 1988, pp. 4–13. Terraces are found the world over, throughout history. Terraces were used extensively throughout Greece in both public and private architecture, and rooftop terraces can be found at Knossos as early as 1700 BCE.Dinsmoor, William Bell and Anderson, William J. The Architecture of Ancient Greece: An Account of Its Historic Development. New York: Biblo and Tannen, 1973, pp. xxix–xxx. Terraces were also built extensively in the Roman Empire, with terraces in front of monumental structures (such as temples) common throughout imperial history.MacDonald, William Lloyd. The Architecture of the Roman Empire: Volume 3, An Urban Appraisal. New Haven, Conn.: Yale University Press, 1986, p. 135. Temples were terraced on the island of Java by at least 800 CE, and the practice spread to Cambodia. The first terrace stone temple in Cambodia was constructed at Bakong in 881 CE.Le, Huu Phuoc. Buddhist Architecture. Lakeville, Minn.: Grafikol, 2010, p. 260. Terraces are often used for private residences. In traditional Thai homes (or \\"cluster houses\\"), the dwelling is built around a central terrace, or chaan. One or more \\"house cabins\\" (small, enclosed rooms) are placed around the edge of the terrace, and set about higher than the terrace to provide built-in bench seating. The terrace is often pierced in the center by a tree, which along with the house cabin roofs and walls provides shade, and may be decorated with large flat ceramic bowls of fish and water lilies or by potted plants.Athapitanonda, Nithi and Mertens, Brian. Architecture of Thailand: A Guide to Tradition and Contemporary Forms. Singapore: Editions Didier Millet, 2012, p. 64. Architectural theories for the use and design of terraces varies widely geographically and historically. In the early part of the 20th century, architects Henry and Theodore Hubbard argued that the basic function of a terrace was as an interesting base of an even more interesting building. Since the terrace was not the focal point of the structure, its design should be simple and it should command a view.Hubbard, Henry Vincent and Hubbard, Theodore Kimball. An Introduction to the Study of Landscape Design. New York: Macmillan Co., 1917, p. 198. More recently, architect Catherine Dee has noted that the terrace is most commonly used to link the structure to the landscape and as an extension of living space.Dee, Catherine. Form and Fabric in Landscape Architecture. Florence, Ky.: Taylor & Francis, 2012, p. 60. According to architect Sophia Psarra, the terrace is one of the most commonly used forms of architecture in the 21st century, along with entrance halls, stairs, and corridors.Psarra, Sophia. Architecture and Narrative: The Formation of Space and Cultural Meaning. New York: Routledge, 2013, p. 87. Landscape architect Russell Sturgis has observed that terraces tend to be used only in larger and more expensive gardens.Sturgis, Russell.

In Venice, Italy, for example, the rooftop terrace (or altana) is the most common form of terrace found. Developed around 1500 CE, it has changed little and consists of a wooden platform with small spaces between the floorboards. The altana was originally a place where laundry could be hung out to dry (hence the spaces in the flooring through which water could pass). However, the altana is now used primarily for social purposes.Goy, Richard J. Venetian Vernacular Architecture: Traditional Housing in the Venetian Lagoon.

The ProRodeo Hall of Fame inducted him in 1979 in the all-around category. It also inducted him as a Legend of ProRodeo in 2010. ==Rodeo career== Larry Mahan was born on November 21, 1943, in Salem, Oregon. Mahan began competing in professional rodeo at the age of 14. He competed in the Rodeo Cowboys Association (RCA), which later changed its name to the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association (PRCA), beginning in 1963. He won the title of World All-Around Champion for five consecutive years from 1966 to 1970, and a sixth time in 1973. His 1973 comeback and competition with Phil Lyne was the subject of the documentary The Great American Cowboy, which won the 1973 Academy Award for Documentary Feature. In the RCA, he competed and regularly won in saddle bronc riding, bareback riding, and bull riding; he was the first to contest three NFR events in one year. He was the high money winner in bull riding in 1965, and in 1967 won more than $50,000, the first to achieve that level in a single season. In the 1970 season he earned more than $280,000. He had a tough decade in the 1970s, winning an all-around title in 1973 but with injuries sidelining him some of the time. Mahan earned six all-around titles, but the last one was not consecutive. His consecutive all-around record of five titles was not surpassed until 1979 when Tom Ferguson won his sixth consecutive title. In 1994, Ty Murray broke Mahan's and Ferguson's record of six titles.and tied Ferguson's record of having won six titles consecutively.

He is best known for developing the Christie suspension system used in a number of World War II-era tank designs, most notably the Soviet BT and T-34http://turcopolier.typepad.com/the_athenaeum/2013/01/the-soviet- command-economy-by-richard-sale.html, p. 5 series, and the British Covenanter and Crusader Cruiser tanks, as well as the Comet heavy cruiser tank. ==Early life and career== Christie was born in the Campbell-Christie House in New Milford, New Jersey on May 6, 1865. He started working at the age of sixteen at the Delamater Iron Works while taking classes at the Cooper Union in New York City. He eventually became a consulting engineer for a number of steamship lines and in his spare time did some work on early submarine designs. Following the Spanish–American War he developed and patented an improved turret track for naval artillery. At the same time he was working on designs for a front-wheel-drive car, which he promoted and demonstrated by racing at various speedways in the United States, including the Readville Race Track and the 1905 Vanderbilt Cup race. His car was knocked out of the race by a collision with Vincenzo Lancia who was at the time leading the race in a Fiat. Lancia was enraged, but presumably noticed the Christie car's vertical- pillar coil-based independent front suspension: the then unusual configuration subsequently turned up on the Lancia Lambda. He was the first American to compete in the 1907 French Grand Prix: the V4 engine of 19,891 cc that powered his vehicle was the largest ever used in a Grand Prix race, but the car retired after four laps with \\"engine trouble\\". On September 9 of that same year, Christie was seriously injured in a crash when his car struck loose debris during a lap at Brunots Island Race Track in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In a twelve-car endurance race earlier that day, scheduled to run 50 miles, the Haynes car of driver Rex Reinertson had lost its right front tire with disastrous results, catapulting into the air and landing on its roof. Reinertson was crushed beneath the car, suffering injuries (including a skull fracture) that ultimately proved fatal, and his mechanic Clarence Bastion was ejected from the vehicle and thrown 50 feet through the air, breaking both of his arms and both of his legs. After ten more laps, the race was stopped so that the injured men could receive medical treatment, and the unlucky Reinertson's car was cleared off the track. Next up was Christie, driving the car he had used at the Grand Prix only a few months before. He was attempting to break the track's lap record of 58 seconds, and due to receive a $500 prize if he was successful. Christie completed the second half of his warmup lap in only 24 seconds, so he was well on pace for a new record, but at the 1/8 mile marker of his real lap his right front wheel struck part of Reinertson's car that remained on the track. Christie was thrown from the car, traveling twenty feet in the air and fifty feet across the ground, before coming to earth. Mark Baldwin, a former Major League Baseball player who became a doctor following his retirement from professional sports, happened to be in the stands as a spectator, and he ran to Christie and administered first aid until Christie could be placed in an ambulance and taken to the hospital, a task that was complicated by the large number of spectators who had climbed down from the grandstands and moved onto the track. Christie had been knocked unconscious by the impact. He also sustained a broken left wrist, a cut on his right eye from the broken glass of his goggles, and a significant injury to his back. Doctors who treated Christie expressed concern that he might be crippled as a result of his injuries, or lose the sight in his damaged eye, and news of his accident was kept from his wife, who was herself seriously ill at their home in River Edge, New Jersey. Christie remained in the St. John's Hospital until September 19, at which point he was discharged and returned to New York.\\"Walter Christie Coming Home\\", The New York Times, September 20, 1907, page 10. Walter Christie built the 1909 front wheel drive Christie Racer driven by Barney Oldfield, Master Driver of the World and America's Legendary Speed King, the first to lap the Indianapolis Speedway over 100 MPH. on May 28, 1916, speed: 102.623 MPH, time: 1.27.70. Christie now switched his energies away from automobile racing to developing his fwd New York taxicab design. With benefit of hindsight, the taxi design's importance came in large part from the fact that it incorporated a transversely mounted engine/transmission assembly, applying a basic architecture that would be greeted as revolutionary when applied by Alec Issigonis in the BMC Mini fifty years later. However, in 1909 the idea of a 'conventional lay-out' was less firmly rooted than it would have become by 1959, and for Cristie the vehicle's more striking novelty lay the fact that the entire \\"forecarriage\\", incorporating all the key mechanical components, could be detached and replaced in \\"less than one hour\\", so that the vehicle could stay on the road while the engine maintenance took place. The car's radical lay-out was to necessitate the manufacture of many complex components in-house, and problems encountered subsequently by other manufacturers producing or finding a dependable universal joint make it hard to believe that the Christie vehicle was particularly dependable. Given the heavy steering resulting from the fwd lay-out and a published unit price in 1909 of $2,600, it is understandable that the denizens of the New York cab trade did not flock to buy the Christie taxi. In 1912 Christie began manufacturing a line of wheeled fire engine tractors which also utilized a front-wheel-drive system, and subsequently sold scores of them to fire departments around the country, most notably the New York City Fire Department. The tractors allowed the departments to keep their steam-powered pumps while ending the use of horses to pull them to the scene of the fire. In 1916, with the First World War raging in Europe, he developed a prototype four-wheeled gun carriage for the US Army Ordnance Board. But the Ordnance board had set out strict guidelines for weapons, and Christie refused to revise his designs to suit their requirements. Christie's own personal stubbornness and his habit of offending those in the US Army and Ordnance bureaucracy would have ramifications for the rest of his career. Christie's first major supporter, and success, however came not from the US Army, but the United States Marine Corps Major General Eli K. Cole who was an advocate of developing the Marine Corps amphibious capability. Christie had built an amphibious light tank a decade before Donald Roebling's Alligator, and this was to be displayed during the Winter Maneuvers of 1924 at Culebra, Puerto Rico. In overall command of the exercise was Admiral Robert E. Coontz, USN. Along with trying out the \\"Beetle Boat,\\" a copy of the armoured lighters used by the British during the Gallipoli landings in 1915 that served as a landing craft, would be Christie's amphibious tank first recommended by Brigadier General Smedley Butler.Daugherty, Leo J. III, Pioneers of Amphibious Warfare, 1898–1945, McFarland & Company, Inc., Jefferson NC., 2009, p.116 The tank was transported to the exercise area aboard the , and designated as the Marine Corps Tank (GC-2). It was then hoisted on board a waiting submarine prior to its launch toward the shore, then \\"As the \\"mother ship\\" submerged, the Christie tank proceeded to shore. Unable to maneuver through the heavy surf, the vehicle returned to the Wyoming without landing. The next day, when the surf had subsided, the Christie amphibian once again left its mooring aboard the submarine and made a perfect landing. Despite the fact that the vehicle came ashore after the exercise had been officially declared over, Cole stated that the tank possessed the capability of being developed into an extremely valuable weapon, especially in connection with landing operations.\\"Daugherty, p.117 ==Later innovations and bureaucratic frustrations== Christie continued to submit designs to the Ordnance board, but none was deemed acceptable. A major reason was the poor cross-country performance, due to limited suspension capabilities. He turned his attention to this problem, and after five years of development (at a cost of $382,000) he produced the revolutionary prototype tank chassis M1928 (Model 1928) design. He proudly referred to it as the \\"Model 1940\\" because he considered it to be 12 years ahead of its time. The M1928 still retained large road wheels with no return rollers for the tracks from his earlier designs, so that the tracks could be removed for road travel, allowing for greater speed and range. What made this prototype revolutionary was its new \\"helicoil\\" suspension system, whereby each wheel had its own spring-loaded assembly. This reduced space in the interior of the tank, but (combined with a very light overall weight) allowed for unprecedented high- speed cross-country mobility, albeit at the cost of extremely thin armor. Another interesting feature of the M1928 and later Christie designs was sloped armor in front, which could better deflect projectiles. The sloped armor helped to compensate for its thinness. The Army purchased several of Christie's tank prototypes for testing purposes and Christie's patent,U.S. Patent 1836446 http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph- Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sect2;=HITOFF&d;=PALL&p;=1&u;=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&r;=1&f;=G&l;=50&s1;=1836446.PN.&OS;=PN/1836446&RS;=PN/1836446 allowing them to produce prototypes based on his design. In October 1928, the M1928 was demonstrated at Fort Myer, Virginia. There the Army's Chief of Staff, General Charles P. Summerall, and other high-ranking officers were impressed and strongly recommend that the Infantry Tank Board conduct further, official tests of the new vehicle. However, the Tank Board was less than impressed. They pointed out that the vehicle's armor was very thin and could not survive penetration by the smallest armor-piercing antitank rifle or artillery piece. The Board also differed with Christie on guidelines for tank capabilities, which were based on a radically different theory of armored warfare than that adhered to by Christie. While Christie advocated the use of lightweight tanks with long range and high speed, designed to penetrate enemy lines and attack their infrastructure and logistics capabilities, they saw the tank as simply a supporting weapon to facilitate breakthroughs by the infantry, and help isolate and reduce enemy strongpoints near the front lines, much as they had been used in the previous world war. For the Infantry Tank Board, armor and firepower were far more important design criteria than mobility, and the M1928 prototype was passed to the Cavalry for further evaluation. The Cavalry's thinking at that time was geared toward armored cars, and wanted to develop the M1928 as an armored car chassis. Once again, Christie's concept of how his vehicles should be used, together with his difficult nature, resulted in clashes with Army officials. One member of the Cavalry Evaluation Board who appreciated both Christie's design and tank warfare concepts, was Lt. Colonel George S. Patton. Patton, and his friend Major C.C. Benson, strongly supported adoption of the M1928 as the basis for a Cavalry tank.George S. Patton Papers Ultimately, the Secretary of War rejected mass production of the M1928, citing excessive acquisition costs. Embittered, Christie felt he was justified in selling his inventions to the highest bidder. He began looking to foreign governments to purchase his advanced chassis and suspension systems; Poland, the Soviet Union and Great Britain had all expressed interest in the designs. A long and complex series of exchanges between Christie and foreign governments followed. These were technically illegal, since Christie never obtained approval of the US Department of State, Army Ordnance, or the Department of War to transfer his designs to potentially hostile governments. ==Dealings with foreign governments== Initially, Christie promised to sell his M1928 tank design to the Polish government. In 1929, Captain Marian Rucinski of the Polish Military Institute of Engineering Research (WIBI) was sent to the US, and soon learned of the M1928 tank being constructed by Christie's company, the US Wheel Track Layer Corporation in Linden, New Jersey. Rucinski also learned of a design for an improved tank (later known as the Christie M1931) that had recently gone to blueprint. Rucinski's opinion was so enthusiastic that on February 16, 1930 a special acquisition commission was dispatched to the US, headed by the Chief of the Engineering Department, Colonel Tadeusz Kossakowski. The commission signed a contract with Christie in March for construction and delivery of a single M1928 tank, and paid a pre-payment to him. Christie later reversed course and failed to deliver on his contract obligations, and faced with potential litigation, eventually returned the payment made by the Polish government, which never obtained the tank they had ordered.Magnuski, Janusz, Armor in Profile 1/Pancerne profile 1, Warsaw: Pelta (1997) trans. by Witold Kałużyński Though the Soviet Union had no diplomatic relations with the US at the time, and was barred from obtaining military equipment or weapons, Soviet OGPU agents at the trade front organization AMTORG managed to secure plans and specifications for the Christie M1928 tank chassis in 1930 using a series of deceptions. On April 28, 1930 Christie's company, the U.S. Wheel Track Layer Corporation, agreed to sell Amtorg two M1931 Christie-designed tanks at a total cost of $60,000 US, with the tanks to be delivered not later than four months from date of signing, together with spare parts to the purchased tanks for the sum of $4,000. Rights were also transferred to the production, sale and use of tanks inside the borders of the U.S.S.R. for a period of ten years.Pavlov M., Pavlov, I., and Zheltov I., Tanki BT Chast' 1 (BT Tanks Part 1), Moscow: Armada (1999) The two Christie tanks, falsely documented as agricultural farm tractors, were sold without prior approval of the U.S. Army or Department of State, and were shipped without turrets to the Soviet Union. The Soviets later improved upon the basic Christie tank design, adopting its sloping front armor for its BT tank series of infantry tanks. The BT itself was further refined into the famous Soviet T-34 tank of WWII, retaining the sloping front armor design, now adopted for side armor as well. Following favorable reports on observation of the Soviet activities, the British War Office arranged purchase of Christie's last remaining prototype and licensing of a Christie design through the Morris Motors Group. The deal was done by phone for £8,000 however, the British discovered that Christie had already mortgaged the vehicle. Why payment necessary to secure the vehicle was not deducted from this figure is not clear but the net cost rose to £10,420 18s 4d, which included British Customs Duty and 'other expenses'. page 47 The US authorities refused its export as it was war materiel. The vehicle was dismantled sufficiently to meet specification as an \\"agricultural tractor\\" and so be exported. The removed parts were then shipped to the UK in crates marked as \\"grapefruit\\". Christie's design still had a number of faults that he had never addressed and though the general features were retained, the design was completely reworked to form the British Cruiser Mk III (A13). page 6–7 ==Later life and work== Experimental Christie T3E2 tank, shown here during tests in 1936 After the U.S. Army's rejection of the M1928, Christie continued to work on new designs throughout the 1930s, including a winged tank. Though the Army purchased several prototypes and developed its own experimental designs based on Christie designs, none of the Christie designs ever saw mass production by the US. Following the outbreak of World War II in 1939 and the US entry into hostilities in 1941, Christie again submitted tank designs to the army, all of which featured his suspension system and large, convertible road wheels. But as with his earlier dealings with the army, attempts to secure US government adoption ended largely in frustration and rejection. Christie died in Falls Church, Virginia on January 11, 1944, nearly broke, as the tanks based on his designs were shaping the course of history. == See also == *History of Soviet espionage in the United States == References Further reading== *Chambers, Whittaker (1952), Witness, New York: Random House, . *Magnuski, Janusz, Armor in Profile 1/Pancerne profile 1, Warsaw: Pelta (1997), trans. by Witold Kaluzynski *Suvorov, Viktor (1990).

Ōita became a through-station on 1 April 1914 when the track was extended further south to . On 15 December 1923, this entire stretch of track was redesignated as the Nippo Main Line. Separately, on 1 April 1914, JGR opened the from Ōita westwards to . This track later linked up with another built eastwards from and the entire stretch was designated as the Hōhi Main Line on 2 December 1928. The origin of the third line to serve the station, the Kyudai Main Line lay with the private which opened a track from Ōita westwards to on 30 October 1915. On 1 December 1922, the Daito Railway was nationalized and JGR designated this stretch of track as the Daito Line. By 1934, the track had linked up with a track built eastwards from and the entire route was designated the Kyudai Main Line. With the privatization of Japanese National Railways (JNR), the successor of JGR, on 1 April 1987, Ōita came under the control of JR Kyushu. ==Passenger statistics== In fiscal 2016, the station was used by an average of 19,165 passengers daily (boarding passengers only), and it ranked 4th among the busiest stations of JR Kyushu. ==The station in media== The JR Ōita City station complex was the main subject of an episode in the NHK World English documentary series Japan Railway Journal.

Shoulders (May 13, 1928 – June 20, 2007) was an American professional rodeo cowboy and rancher. He is commemorated at the ProRodeo Hall of Fame. At the time of his death, he was one of the most successful contestants in the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association (PRCA), having won 16 World Championships, which was the most of any performer at that time. He was known as the 'Babe Ruth of rodeo'. He was born in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and died in Henryetta, Oklahoma. ==Rodeo career== Shoulders won his first bull riding competition in Oilton, Oklahoma, at the age of fourteen. He competed until his retirement due to injury at the age of forty-two. His success at competitions included: :*World All-Around Champion Cowboy Championships (1949, 1956, 1957, 1958, 1959). :*World Bull Rider Championships. (1951 and 1954 to 1959). :*World Bareback Bronc Rider Championships. (1950 and 1956 to 1958). Shoulders was the first competitor to win all three events (bareback bronc, bull riding and all-round) at the National Finals Rodeo (NFR). Shoulders set the record of 16 world championships in 1959 when he won his 15th and 16th titles. The record stood for a long time until steer roper Guy Allen matched the record in 2001 after winning his 16th steer roping title. Two years later in 2003, he broke Shoulder's record after winning a 17th title. Allen won his 18th and final record to date in 2004. In 2013, Trevor Brazile won another all-around title and his total number of world titles moved to 19 world titles. This broke Allen's record of 18 world titles. As of 2019, Brazile has 25 world titles, seven more than Allen, who is in second place with 18 titles, and Shoulders is in third place with 16 titles. Brazile won his 25th title in 2019. ==Business ventures== From his rodeo career earnings, Shoulders bought a ranch in Oklahoma where he raised livestock. He owned several bucking \\"weather\\" bulls, the most famous of which was Tornado, a rodeo bull who threw 200 riders over 14 years. According to Frank Boggs, an Oklahoman sports writer and columnist, Shoulders bought Tornado in South Texas when he was three years old. In 1967, Freckles Brown rode Tornado. On the basis of his rodeo success, Shoulders took work in advertising. His manager was Billy Martin, a former New York Yankees manager. He made advertisements for products such as Miller Lite beer, jeans (helping to design the Wrangler Jeans 13MWZ 'cowboy cut' jeans); and Justin boots. ==Honors== Shoulders is honored in many rodeo halls of fame. Shoulders was an early participant in the American Cowboy Culture Association, which holds the annual National Cowboy Symposium and Celebration each September in Lubbock, Texas. *Has an entry in The Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture maintained online by the Oklahoma Historical Society *An entry in the Encyclopædia Britannica *An entry in the Encyclopedia of the Great Plains *In 2017, the Molalla Walk of Fame *In 2015, inducted into the Bull Riding Hall of Fame which is the inaugural class. *In 2011, the Professional Bull Riders created the Heroes and Legends Celebration awards, one of which is the Jim Shoulders Lifetime Achievement Award *In 2007, Jim was awarded the Legends of ProRodeo by the ProRodeo Hall of Fame *In 2003, the Texas Trail of Fame *In 2002, Cheyenne Frontier Days Hall of Fame *In 1999, the Pendleton Round-Up and Happy Canyon Hall of Fame *In 1999, St. Paul Rodeo Hall of Fame. *In 1997, Jim was inducted into the Ellensburg Rodeo Hall of Fame *In 1979 to the ProRodeo Hall of Fame in Colorado Springs *In 1976, the Oklahoma Hall of Fame *In 1955 inaugural inductee National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum in its Rodeo Hall of Fame *Madison Square Garden Hall of Fame in New York City ==Personal life== In 1947, Shoulders married Sharon and they had four children.

Owned by the Hunt Valley, Maryland-based Sinclair Broadcast Group, it is sister to Washington-licensed ABC affiliate WJLA-TV (channel 7) and local cable channel WJLA 24/7 News. WDCO-CD's transmitter is located in Ward Circle in Washington's northwest quadrant. ==History== Logo used until October 2008. The station has operated since October 1985, when it was put on the air as a religious independent station by Ruarch Associates, LLC (its original calls were W10AZ, with the WAZT calls, introduced in 1994, apparently being derived from it), and once had a radio sister station, WAZR (93.7 FM; that station is now owned by iHeartMedia with a contemporary format).\\"harrisonburg\\"  iHeartRadio The WAZT network offered some programming from Cornerstone and other religious networks, but it generally did not show them in-pattern with those networks, and it also broadcast some secular syndicated programming and classic television shows. WAZT once broadcast a local newscast at 5:30 p.m. and 9:30 p.m. Monday through Friday (entitled News 10), but this was discontinued on December 26, 2005. In January 2006, WAZT began airing CBN's NewsWatch program. Ruarch sold WAZT to JLA Media & Publications (no relation to WJLA-TV) in 2006. Jones Broadcasting acquired the station out of Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2011. Jones Broadcasting sold the group of stations to Venture Technologies Group in December 2013. Venture immediately began moving WAZT and its sister stations to the far larger Washington, D.C. television market. At the time, WAZT transmitted from a hill near Toms Brook, Virginia. After agreeing to purchase the WAZT network, Venture obtained a construction permit to move the station's analog signal to the WZRV tower near Front Royal, Virginia. Later in 2014, it filed for a digital signal at its current transmitter site near The Plains, Virginia, which signed on in March 2015. Venture also purchased WIAV-CD in 2014, which expanded the network's footprint into the city of Washington proper. After spending most of its time as a religious broadcaster branded as simply \\"WAZT\\", the station and its relays changed to the branding \\"Faith Television Network\\" under Venture's ownership. WAZT-CD's callsign was changed to WDCO-CD on October 11, 2017. On the same day, Winchester repeater WAZW-CD became WAZT-CD. On January 24, 2018, Faith Television Network announced it would cease broadcasting. All four remaining stations in the network became full-time affiliates of Jewelry Television on January 31. As a result of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC)'s 2016–17 spectrum reallocation incentive auction, channels 24 and 30 – occupied by WNVC and WNVT, respectively – became available in the Washington market in 2018. WDCO-CD applied to take over WNVC's channel 24 facilities at its tower in Merrifield, Virginia, which would place it firmly in the Washington market, while WIAV-CD applied to move to channel 30. After WNVC was unable to find a channel-sharing partner and went off the air, it sold the tower and transmitter building. Left without a transmission site, WDCO-CD moved to temporary low-powered facilities shared with WIAV-CD at the WRC-TV (channel 4) tower in northwest Washington, and reapplied to permanently build there. The new WAZT-CD has since relocated from Winchester to Blue Ridge Mountain in extreme southern Jefferson County, West Virginia, near the Virginia–West Virginia state line but also within the Washington market. On June 25, 2020, Venture Technologies Group filed an agreement with the FCC to sell WDCO-CD and WIAV-CD to Sinclair Broadcast Group for $8.5 million. The sale was completed on October 15,Consummation Notice making them Sinclair's second and third properties in the Washington market, alongside WJLA-TV. On the same day, WDCO- CD and WIAV-CD flipped to Sinclair's TBD multicast network, simulcasting WJLA- TV's fourth digital subchannel in 1080i full high definition. WAZT-CD was not included in the sale and continues to air Jewelry TV programming. ==Translator== WDCO-CD operates one translator.

In 1998, it was sold to Ruarch and moved to Luray. In 2006, WAZC-LP was forced to vacate channel 16 as WJAL in Hagerstown, Maryland received the allocation for its digital signal. A construction permit for WAZC-LD on channel 35 expired in June 2010 without being built. This station was not included in the 2013 sale to Venture and is off the air, although its license has never been canceled. ===WAZM-CA=== WAZM-CA signed on in 1996 (as W25CC, later W25AZ) and was a relay for Staunton and Waynesboro.

This station was licensed to Front Royal, Virginia and in the analog era broadcast on channel 28 from the same Winchester tower as then-WAZW-CA; WAZF-CA's signal was pointed toward Front Royal while WAZW-CA's was pointed toward Charles Town, West Virginia. In 2014, this station signed on a digital signal on UHF channel 20 (virtual channel 28.1) from a transmitter on Short Hill Mountain southeast of Harpers Ferry, West Virginia.

After the digital transition, the new WAZH-CD moved to Signal Knob near Strasburg, which was the same location as then-WAZW-CD. The station operated on UHF channel 14 and virtual channel 24.1. Venture sold WAZH-CD's channel 14 allocation for $12,042,490 in the spectrum reallocation auction, missed the subsequent deadline to reach a channel-sharing agreement with another Harrisonburg station, and elected to surrender the license on April 23, 2018. ==Digital channels== {  !

The company was incorporated in February 1969 and had moderate commercial success. It was acquired by Motorola in 1981. ==History== The idea behind Four-Phase Systems began when Boysel was designing MOS components at Fairchild Semiconductor in 1967. Boysel wrote a manifesto explaining how a computer could be built from a small number of MOS chips. Fairchild made Boysel head of a MOS design group, which he used to design parts satisfying the requirements of his putative computer. After doing this, Boysel left to start Four-Phase in October 1968, initially with two other engineers from his Fairchild group as well as others. Boysel was not sued by Fairchild, perhaps because of chaos caused by a change in Fairchild management at that time. When the company was incorporated in February 1969, he was joined by other engineers from the Fairchild group. Boysel arranged for chips to be fabricated by Cartesian, a wafer-processing company founded by another engineer from Fairchild. Four-Phase showed its system at the Fall Joint Computer Conference in 1970. The system was in operation at four different customers by June 1971, and by March 1973, they had shipped 347 systems to 131 customers. The company enjoyed a substantial level of success, having revenues of $178 million by 1979. In 1982, it was sold to Motorola for a $253 million stock exchange. The former location of the original business is now Infinite Loop. ==System== The Four-Phase CPU used a 24-bit word size. It fit on a single card and was composed of three AL1 chips, three read-only-memory (ROM) chips, and three random logic chips. A memory card used Four-Phase's 1K RAM chips. The system also included a built-in video controller which could drive up to 32 terminals from a character buffer in main memory.Brochure, System IV/70, Four Phase Systems. From the Computer History Museum. Accessed on line June 11, 2010. Also see The AL1 was an 8-bit bit slice which contained eight registers and an arithmetic logic unit (ALU). It was implemented using four-phase logic and used over a thousand gates, with an area of 130 by 120 mils. The chip was described in an April 1970 article in Computer Design magazine. Although the AL1 was not called a microprocessor, or used as one, at the time, it was later dubbed one in connection with litigation in the 1990s, when Texas Instruments claimed to have patented the microprocessor. In response, Lee Boysel assembled a system in which a single 8-bit AL1 was used as part of a courtroom demonstration computer system, together with ROM, RAM and an input-output device.\\"Court Room Demonstration System 1969 AL1 Microprocessor\\", 4/3/95, Lee Boysel.

The nematodes can also infect humans and cause the disease called mammomonogamiasis.Anderson RC, Chabaud AG, Willmott S. CIH keys to the nematode parasites of vertebrates, no 7. Keys to genera of superfamily Strongyloidea. Commonwealth Agricultural Bureaux, England, 1980. Several known species fall under the genus Mammomonogamus, but the most common species found to infest humans is M. laryngeus. Infection in humans is very rare, with only about 100 reported cases worldwide, and is assumed to be largely accidental.Nosanchuk, J.S., Wade, S.E., and Landolf, M (1995). Case Report of and Description of Parasite in Mammomonogamus laryngeus (Human Syngamosis) Infection. J of Clinical Microbiology. 33: 998–1000. Cases have been reported from the Caribbean, China, Korea, Thailand, and Philippines. The worm usually inhabits the upper-respiratory region in the trachea, bronchus, or larynx, and can elicit chronic coughing and asthma-like symptoms.Weinstein, L., and A. Molovi. 1971. Syngamus laryngeus infection (Syngamosis) with chronic cough. Ann. Intern. Med. 74:577–580. One interesting case from Thailand reported finding worms in the patient's duodenum, suggesting M. laryngeus can also be a gastrointestinal parasite. More research is needed because the life cycle is not completely known. Diagnosis is made by recovering the worms on bronchoscopy or oesophagogastroduodenoscopy. Due to the scant amount of information available on this parasite in literature, increased awareness is necessary, especially in endemic areas near M. laryngeus’ reservoir hosts, for clinicians, the local population in the endemic area, and traveling tourists, to effectively recognize and prevent mammomonogamiasis. ==Taxonomic classification== Taxonomic family tree of Mammomonogamus Mammomonogamus is classified in the family Syngamidae. The Syngamidae are in the superfamily Strongyloidae and order Strongylata, making them close relatives to hookworms and other nematodes. The generic name Mammomonogamus is derived from the Latin term ('breast'), and the Greek terms ( 'single') and ( 'marriage'),de Lara, T. de A., Barbosa, M.A., de Oliveira, M.R., de Godoy, I., and Queluz, T.T. (1993). Human syngamosis: Two cases of chronic cough caused by Mammomonogamus laryngeus. Chest. 103(1): 264-5. which most likely is referring to the distinct characteristic of the male and female worm acting as a single unit through the male being joined in permanent copulation to the middle portion of the female's body. Species within this genus are M. laryngeus, M. nasicola, M. gangguiensis, and M. auris. Only M. laryngeus is known to infect and cause disease in humans. Because of the close resemblance of M. laryngeus to the gapeworm from the genus Syngamus that commonly infect birds, M. laryngeus was originally called Syngamus laryngeus and Syngamus kingi. The classification was revised in 1948 when Ryzhikov reconstructed the phylogenetic relationship of the family Syngamidae and recategorized the parasite as M. laryngeus. Infestation with M. laryngeus has been called mammomonogamiasis, mammomonogamosis, syngamosis', or 'syngamiasis., Mammomonogamiasis. GIDEON Infectious Diseases: Diseases. Accessed 5 Feb. 2009. ==History== The parasite in this genus of greatest significance to humans is M. laryngeus, due to the occasional, incidental cases reported in humans. While M. laryngeus commonly infects domestic ungulates and ruminants, the first reported case of a human infection was by Dr. King, who diagnosed the parasite in a woman from St. Lucia, Antilles. The next case originated in Brazil in the 1920s, where the connection with bovine species was confirmed.Freitas, A.L., De Carli, G., and Blankenhein, M.H. “Mammonomonogamus (Syngamus) laryngeus infection: a new Brazilian human case. Rev. Inst. Med. Trop. S. Paulo, 37 (2): 177-179, 1995. ==Morphology== The most distinct feature of M. laryngeus is the “Y” shape formed when the male is joined to the female in copula. Costa, J.C., Delgado, M.L., Vieira, P., Afonso, A., Conde, B., and Cross, J.H (2005). Syngamoniasis in Tourist. Emerging Infectious Diseases. Vol 11, No. 12. . The smaller male uses its posterior bursa to attach to the female vulva located on the side near the middle of the female worm.Gutierrez, Yezid. Diagnostic Pathology of Parasitic Infections with Clinical Correlations. 2nd ed. New York: Oxford University Press, 2000. The adult worms usually remain permanently joined in this “Y” formation as they settle on the mucosal epithelium of the larynx, trachea, or bronchi. Adult M. laryngeus worms are red to reddish-brown in color due to their hemophagous nature. They possess spicules ranging from 23-30 μm in length and cup-shaped buccal capsules (mouths) that open at the anterior end. Located deep in the buccal cavity are eight to 10 teeth that are not thought to be used for attachment. The adult male is about half the length of the female. Case reports have found male worms ranging from 3–6.3 mm in length and 360-380 μm in width. The larger females were reported to be 8.7-23.5 mm long and 550-570 μm wide. The female also has a pointed posterior end with a long or short tail. The female while in copula lays many ellipsoid- shaped eggs that are about 40 x 80 μm in size, not operculated, and usually possess thicker shells than hookworm eggs. ==Life cycle== Hypothesized lifecycle of Mammomonogamus laryngeus Although the complete lifecycle of M. laryngeus is not fully known due to the rareness of the parasite in humans, the parasite is thought to adopt a lifecycle similar to Syngamus trachea,Severo LC, Conci LMA, Camargo JJP, Andre-Alves MR, Palombini BC. Syngamosis: two new Brazilian cases and evidence of possible pulmonary cycle. Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg. 1988;82: 467–8. the common gapeworm infection in birds that was initially thought to be mammomonogamiasis. Currently, two existing hypotheses may help aid medical diagnostics, especially in endemic areas such as the tropics, the Caribbean, and Brazil. Hypothesis #1: Infection initially begins by the ingestion of foods, water, or intermediate hosts contaminated by adult worms. The infective adults migrate to the larynx or trachea and attach to the mucosal walls. Sexual reproduction occurs here, and the females begin to lay eggs in the upper respiratory region. Eggs do not develop at body temperature, and are expelled in sputum or reswallowed and excreted in feces. Hypothesis #2: The infective agent may be embryonated eggs or infective larvae, and infection is due to ingestion of contaminated food, water, or intermediate hosts. As larvae are released into the intestinal area, they can burrow through intestinal walls, travel into the mesenteric veins, and migrate to the alveoli. Here, they undergo a pulmonary cycle, where the larvae develop into adult worms in a process that may take seven days. After reaching adulthood, M. laryngeus migrates upwards to the trachea, larynx, or bronchi, where sexual reproduction occurs. Egg production begins about three weeks later, and eggs are coughed up and expelled in sputum, or excreted in feces. Larvae may hatch from embryonated eggs outside of the mammalian host.Acha PN, Szyfres B. Mammomonogamiasis. Zoonosis and communicable diseases common to man and animals. Washington (DC): Pan American Health Organization; 2003. Scientific and Technical Publication No. 580. More research is needed to fully elucidate the lifecycle, but both larvae and adults appear to be infective. One recent case reported finding adult worms in the duodenum, which is the first presentation of adult worms not in the upper respiratory region. The adult worms might have been coughed up and reswallowed before settling in the duodenum. The development from larvae to adults is about three weeks, but the existence of a larval pulmonary cycle is uncertain. Intermediate hosts, although not fully known, may be earthworms (an intermediate host for the genus Syngamus), snails, or arthropods. Other than intermediate hosts, no mention of other biological or mechanical vectors has been made. ==Symptoms of infection in humans== Symptoms usually began to appear six to 11 days after initial infection, beginning with a fever and cough. Most cases reported a progression to a persistent cough, leading to expectoration and sometimes hemoptysis. Worms in the bronchial region can trigger a chronic, nonproductive cough and asthma-like symptoms due to the obstruction of airways by the worms. These symptoms, along with a low-grade fever, can last several months if not initially diagnosed correctly. A scratching or crawling sensation can be felt in the throat if the worms are attached in the larynx. Weight lossBirrell, D.J., Moorhouse, D.E., Gardnert, M.A.H., and May, C.S (1978). Chronic Cough and Haemoptysis due to a Nematode, \\"Syngamus Laryngeus.\\" Aust. N.Z. J. Med. 8: 168-170. and pneumonitis have been reported as possible long-term consequences, but not anemia. Recently, M. laryngeus worms were found in the duodenum of a Thai patient, which was the first gastrointestinal case of ammomonogamiasis. The patient complained of chest pain, haematemesia, melaena, and abdominal bloating, but no respiratory symptoms. Although nothing conclusive was determined, t the adult worms perhaps were dislodged from the larynx, reswallowed, and later found in the duodenum. ==Pathogenesis== Little is known about how M. laryngeus causes disease. Symptoms do not arise until the worms have reached the adult stage and obstruct the bronchial airways leading to asthma-like symptoms and coughing. Similar symptoms are seen in humans, as well as the domestic ungulates and ruminant hosts. Bronchial inflammation or hemotypsis may occur due to the worms attaching to the mucosal walls and ingesting red blood cells. The incubation period is usually six to 11 days after infection. This supports the second hypothesis of a possible pulmonary cycle that explains the one- to two-week delay in the presentation of symptoms. Eosinophilia is not a reliable measure of extent of infection because it varies from individual to individual. Some cases with multiple pairs of worms have reported low eosinophil levels, while other cases with a single pair had very high eosinophil counts. Such variation may be due to the lack of host tissue invasion by the parasite, since M. laryngeus attaches to the mucosal epithelium in the tracheolaryngeal region. A singular case even found worms within a cyst.Gardiner, C.H. and Schantz, P.M (1983). Mammomonogamus Infection in A Human: Report of A Case. Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 32(5) 995-997. Past cases have demonstrated that simple removal of the worms from upper respiratory area led to a cessation of symptoms and was a sufficient cure with or without antihelmintics. No lasting pathological tissue damage was reported. Thus far, no reinfection mechanism for M. laryngeus has been posited, so all adult worms found inside a human must be the result of ingested embryonated eggs, larvae, or adult worms. Most of the time, only one pair of worms is found, but occasionally, the patient may have multiple pairs that must all be removed.Pipitogool V, Chaisiri K, Visetsuspakarn P, Srigan V, Maleewong W. Mammomonogamus (syngamus) laryngeus. First case report in Thailand. Southeast Asian J Trop Med Public Health. 1992;23:336–7. ==Diagnosis== The definitive diagnosis is the recovery of adult worms either by coughing them up or removing them with forceps, a bronchoscope, or endoscopic instruments. However, worms might be difficult to remove if firmly attached to the bronchial walls. Finding M. laryngeus eggs in the sputum or feces is another sure sign of infection. The eggs closely resemble hookworm eggs, but Mammomonogamus eggs have a much thicker shell. ==Treatment== Mammomonogamiasis is relatively easy to treat. Manual or bronchoscopic removal of worms has been successful. One case followed up with aspiration. Although no controlled study on the efficacy of antihelmintics in treating mammomonogamiasis has been conducted, most patients were given albendazole, mebendazole or thiabendazole with no adverse effects. Patients given albendazole were instructed to take 400 mg for three days or if given a combination of drugs, albendazole is given 200 mg, three times a day for three days, with mebendazole at 100 mg, three times a day for three days. The drug regimens ranged from 200–3000 mg/day for three to 20 days. ==Epidemiology== Mammomonogamiasis is a very rare human infection yet a common veterinary parasite. Only 100 human cases of M. laryngeus have been reported, thus far. Its reservoir hosts are largely in tropical regions, most commonly the domestic cattle,Van Aken, D., Lagapa, J.T., Dargantes, A.P., Vercruysse, J., 1996. Mammomonogamus laryngeus (Railliet, 1899) infections in cattle in Mindanao. Philippines. Vet.

Primatol. 15, 121—129. and other ruminants and ungulates. Therefore, humans are accidental hosts, where infections are most likely to due close exposure to bovine or feline species. While the complete life cycle is still not fully known, transmission is thought to be oral-fecal, where infection comes from ingesting contaminated food or water containing embryonated eggs, hatched larvae, or intermediate hosts. Possible intermediate host candidates include earthworms, snails, and arthropods. Eggs are expelled in sputum or feces. Most often, travelers to tropical climate places become exposed to contaminated sources and are diagnosed upon return to their country. The best preventative measure is to ensure proper food preparation and water sanitation.

Consequently, no control measures are currently being implemented. Very little information about this disease can be found in literature, so physicians especially in endemic areas should be aware of the parasitic disease, the clinical presentations, and treatment for humans. == References  External links == * Information from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Widely-spoken foreign languages include Arabic (official), English (official; major foreign language taught in schools), and Italian (spoken by European minorities). ==Religion== According to the CIA Factbook the religious demography of Ethiopia is as follows; Ethiopian Orthodox 43.5%, Muslim 31.9%, Protestant 18.5%, traditional 2.7%, Catholic 0.4%, and other 0.5%. ==Diaspora== The largest diaspora community is found in the United States. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, 250,000 Ethiopian immigrants lived in the United States as of 2008. An additional 30,000 U.S.-born citizens reported Ethiopian ancestry. According to Aaron Matteo Terrazas, \\"if the descendants of Ethiopian-born migrants (the second generation and up) are included, the estimates range upwards of 460,000 in the United States (of which approximately 350,000 are in the Washington, DC Metropolitan Area; 96,000 in Los Angeles; and 10,000 in New York).\\" A large Ethiopian community is also found in Israel, where Ethiopians make up almost 1.9% of the population; almost the entire community are members of the Beta Israel community. There are also large number of Ethiopian emigrants in Saudi Arabia, Italy, Lebanon, United Kingdom, Canada, Sweden and Australia. ==Genetic studiesAutosomal DNA=== Studies of Ethiopians belonging to Semitic and Cushitic ethnic groups mostly from the north of the country (the Oromo, Amhara, Tigray, and Gurage) estimate approximately 40% of their autosomal ancestry to be derived from an ancient non-African back-migration from the near East, and about 60% to be of local native African origin (from a sub-Saharan population indigenous or \\"autochthonous\\" to the Horn of Africa).; Tishkoff et al. (2009) identified fourteen ancestral population clusters which correlate with self-described ethnicity and shared cultural and/or linguistic properties in Africa in what was the largest autosomal study of the continent to date.Out of Africa: Penn Geneticist Publishes Largest-Ever Study on African Genetics Revealing Origins, Migration. The Burji, Konso and Beta Israel were sampled from Ethiopia. The Afroasiatic speaking Ethiopians sampled were cumulatively (Fig.5B) found to belong to: 71% in the \\"Cushitic\\" cluster, 6% in the \\"Saharan/Dogon\\" cluster, 5% in the \\"Niger Kordofanian\\" cluster, 3% each in the \\"Nilo-Saharan\\" and \\"Chadic Saharan\\" cluster, while the balance (12%) of their assignment was distributed among the remnant (9) Associated Ancestral Clusters (AAC's) found in Sub-Saharan Africa. The \\"Cushitic\\" cluster was also deemed \\"closest to the non-African AACs, consistent with an East African migration of modern humans out of Africa or a back-migration of non-Africans into Saharan and Eastern Africa.\\"; Supplementary Material Wilson et al. (2001), an autosomal DNA study based on cluster analysis that looked at a combined sample of Amhara and Oromo examining a single enzyme variants: drug metabolizing enzyme (DME) loci, found that 62% of Ethiopeans fall into the same cluster of Ashkenazi Jews, Norwegians and Armenians based on that gene. Only 24% of Ethiopians cluster with Bantus and Afro-Caribbeans, 8% with Papua New Guineans, and 6% with Chinese. ===Paternal lineages=== Y DNA Haplogroups of Ethiopia A composite look at most YDNA studies done so farMoran et al. (2004) Y chromosome haplogroups of elite Ethiopian enduranceShenn et al. (2004) Reconstruction of Patrilineages and Matrilineages of Samaritans and Other Israeli Populations From Y-Chromosome and Mitochondrial DNA Sequence Variation reveals that,out of a total of 459 males sampled from Ethiopia, approximately 58% of Y-chromosome haplotypes were found to belong to Haplogroup E, of which 71% (41% of total) were characterized by one of its further downstream sub lineage known as E1b1b, while the remainder were mostly characterized by Haplogroup E1b1(x E1b1b,E1b1a), and to a lesser extent Haplogroup E2. With respect to E1b1b, some studies have found that it exists at its highest level among the Oromo, where it represented 62.8% of the haplotypes, while it was found at 35.4% among the Amhara, other studies however have found an almost equal representation of Haplogroup E1b1b at approximately 57% in both the Oromo and the Amhara.Cruciani et al. (2004) Phylogeographic Analysis of Haplogroup E3b (E-M215) Y Chromosomes Reveals Multiple Migratory Events Within and Out Of Africa The haplogroup (as its predecessor E1b1) is thought to have originated in Ethiopia or elsewhere in the Horn of Africa. About one half of E1b1b found in Ethiopia is further characterized by E1b1b1a (M78), which arose later in north-eastern Africa and then back-migrated to eastern Africa. Haplogroup J has been found at a frequency of approximately 18% in Ethiopians, with a higher prevalence among the Amhara, where it has been found to exist at levels as high as 35%, of which about 94% (17% of total) is of the type J1, while 6% (1% of total) is of J2 type. On the other hand, 26% of the individuals sampled in the Arsi control portion of Moran et al. (2004) were found to belong to Haplogroup J. Another fairly prevalent lineage in Ethiopia belongs to Haplogroup A, occurring at a frequency of about 17% within Ethiopia, it is almost all characterized by its downstream sub lineage of A3b2 (M13). Restricted to Africa, and mostly found along the Rift Valley from Ethiopia to Cape Town, Haplogroup A represents the deepest branch in the Human Y- Chromosome phylogeny. Finally, Haplogroup T at approximately 4% and Haplogroup B at approximately 3%, make up the remainder of the Y-DNA Haplogroups found within Ethiopia. ===Maternal lineages=== mtDNA Haplogroups of Ethiopia The maternal ancestry of Ethiopians is similarly diverse. About half (52.2%) of Ethiopians belongs to mtdna Haplogroups L0, L1, L2, L3, L4, L5, or L6. These haplogroups are generally confined to the African continent. They also originated either in Ethiopia or very near. The other portion of the population belong to Haplogroup N (31%) and Haplogroup M1 (17%). There is controversy surrounding their origins as either native or a possible ancient back migration into Ethiopia from Asia. Passarino et al. (1998) suggested that: > Caucasoid gene flow into the Ethiopian gene pool occurred predominantly > through males. Conversely, the Niger–Congo contribution to the Ethiopian > population occurred mainly through females. While there is debate among the scientific community of what exactly constitutes \\"Caucasoid gene flow\\", the same study further stated: > Indeed, Ethiopians do not seem to result only from a simple combination of > proto-Niger–Congo and Middle Eastern genes. Their African component cannot > be completely explained by that of present-day Niger–Congo speakers, and it > is quite different from that of the Khoisan. Thus, a portion of the current > Ethiopian gene pool may be the product of in situ differentiation from an > ancestral gene pool.\\" Scott et al. (2005) similarly observed that the Ethiopian population is almost equally divided between individuals that carry Eurasian maternal lineages, and those that belong to African clades. They describe the presence of Eurasian clades in the country as sequences that \\"are thought to be found in high numbers in Ethiopia either as a result of substantial gene flow into Ethiopia from Eurasia (Chen et al., 2000; Richards et al., 2003), or as a result of having undergone several branching events in demic diffusion, acting as founder lineages for non-African populations\\". The researchers further found no association between regional origin of subjects or language family (Semitic/Cushitic) and their mitochondrial type: > The haplogroup distribution amongst all subjects (athletes and controls) > from different geographical regions of Ethiopia is displayed in Table 3. As > can be seen graphically in Fig. 3, the mtDNA haplogroup distribution of each > region is similar, with all regions displaying similar proportions of > African 'L' haplogroups (Addis Ababa: 59%, Arsi: 50%, Shewa: 44%, Other: > 57%). No association was found between regional origin of subjects and their > mitochondrial type (v2=8.5, 15 df, P=0.9). Similarly, the mtDNA haplogroup > distribution of subjects (athletes and controls) speaking languages from > each family is shown in Table 3. Again there was no association between > language family and mitochondrial type (v2=5.4, 5 df, P=0.37). As can be > seen in Fig. 4, the haplogroup distributions of each language family are > again very similar. In addition, Musilová et al. (2011) observed significant maternal ties between its Ethiopian and other Horn African samples with its Western Asian samples; particularly in terms of the HV1b mtDNA haplogroup. The authors noted: > \\"Detailed phylogeography of HV1 sequences shows that more recent demographic > upheavals likely contributed to their spread from West Arabia to East > Africa, a finding concordant with archaeological records suggesting > intensive maritime trade in the Red Sea from the sixth millennium BC > onwards.\\" According to Černý et al. (2008), many Ethiopians also share specific maternal lineages with areas in Yemen and other parts of Northeast Africa. The authors indicate that: > \\"The most frequent haplotype in west coastal Yemen is 16126–16362, which is > found not only in the Ethiopian highlands but also in Somalia, lower Egypt > and at especially high frequency in the Nubians. The Tihama share some West > Eurasian haplotypes with Africans, e.g. J and K with Ethiopians, Somali and > Egyptians.\\"Černý et al. (2008), Regional differences in the distribution of > the sub-Saharan, West Eurasian and South Asian mtDNA lineages in Yemen, > Volume 136, Issue 2, pages 128–137, June 2008. ==Origins== Ethiopia and Sudan are largely agreed upon by most linguists as the Afro-Asiatic Urheimat. More recent linguistic studies as to the origin of the Ethiosemitic languages seem to support the DNA findings of immigration from the Arabian Peninsula with a recent study using Bayesian computational phylogenetic techniques finding that \\"contemporary Ethiosemitic languages of Africa reflect a single introduction of early Ethiosemitic from southern Arabia approximately 2,800 years ago\\", and that this single introduction of Ethiosemitic underwent \\"Rapid Diversification\\" within Ethiopia. Bayesian phylogenetic analysis of Semitic languages identifies an Early Bronze Age origin of Semitic in the Near East. The study also went further to state, \\"Thus, we propose that the current distribution of Ethiosemitic reflects a process of language diffusion through existing African populations with little gene flow from the Arabian Peninsula (i.e. a language shift).\\" Sabeans influence on the opposite side of the Red Sea was acknowledged.Stuart Munro- Hay, Aksum: An African Civilisation of Late Antiquity. Edinburgh: University Press, 1991, pp. 57f. At a later period, Ethiopian civilisation was exposed to Judaic influence, of which the best-known examples are the Qemant and Ethiopian Jews (or Beta Israel) ethnic groups, but Judaic customs, terminology, and beliefs can be found amongst the dominant culture of the Amhara and Tigrinya.For an overview of this influence see Ullendorff, Ethiopia and the Bible, pp. 73ff. Indian alphabets have been claimed, however, similarities of the Ge’ez writing system with the South Arabian and Phoenician writing system makes it more likely that the Ge’ez script arose independently and influenced other languages in the area. ==History== Around the 7th century BC, the kingdom of D'mt (D'amt) was established in northern Ethiopia and Eritrea, with its capital at Yeha in northern Ethiopia. After the fall of D\`mt in the 5th century BC, the plateau came to be dominated by smaller successor kingdoms, until the rise of one of these kingdoms, the Aksumite Kingdom, ancestor of medieval and modern Ethiopia, during the first century BC, was able to reunite the area.Pankhurst, Richard K. P. Addis Tribune, \\"Let's Look Across the Red Sea I\\", January 17, 2003. They established bases on the northern highlands of the Ethiopian Plateau and from there expanded southward. The Persian religious figure Mani listed Axum with Rome, Persia, and China as one of the four great powers of his time.Stuart Munro-Hay, Aksum: a Civilization of Late Antiquity (Edinburgh: University Press, 1991), p. 13. It was in the early 4th century AD that a Syro-Greek castaway, Frumentius, was taken to the court and eventually converted King Ezana to Christianity, thereby making it the official state religion.Taddesse Tamrat, Church and State in Ethiopia: 1270-1527 (London: Oxford University Press, 1972), pp. 22-3.

At various times, including a period in the 6th century, Axum controlled most of modern-day Yemen and some of southern Saudi Arabia just across the Red Sea, as well as controlling northern Sudan, northern Ethiopia, Eritrea and Djibouti.Munro-Hay, Aksum, p. 36 The line of rulers descended from the Axumite kings was broken several times: first by the Jewish or pagan Queen Gudit around 950Taddesse, Church and State, pp. 38-41. or 850.Tekeste Negash, It was then interrupted by the Zagwe dynasty; it was during this dynasty that the famous rock-hewn churches of Lalibela were carved under King Lalibela, allowed by a long period of peace and stability.Tekeste, \\"Zagwe period- reinterpreted.\\" Around 1270, the Solomonic dynasty came to control Ethiopia, claiming descent from the kings of Axum. They called themselves Neguse Negest (\\"King of Kings,\\" or Emperor), basing their claims on their direct descent from Solomon and the queen of Sheba.Taddesse, Church and State, pp. 64-8. During the reign of Emperor Yeshaq, Ethiopia made its first successful diplomatic contact with a European country since Aksumite times, sending two emissaries to Alfons V of Aragon, who sent return emissaries that failed to complete the trip to Ethiopia.Girma Beshah and Merid Wolde Aregay, The Question of the Union of the Churches in Luso-Ethiopian Relations (1500-1632) (Lisbon:Junta de Investigações do Ultramar and Centro de Estudos Históricos Ultramarinos, 1964), pp. 13f. The first continuous relations with a European country began in 1508 with Portugal under Emperor Lebna Dengel, who had just inherited the throne from his father.Girma and Merid, Question of the Union of the Churches, p. 25. This proved to be an important development, for when the Empire was subjected to the attacks of the Adal General and Imam, Ahmad ibn Ibrihim al-Ghazi (called \\"Grañ\\", or \\"the Left-handed\\"), Portugal responded to Lebna Dengel's plea for help with an army of 400 men, who helped his son Gelawdewos defeat Ahmad and re-establish his rule.Girma and Merid, Question of the Union of the Churches, pps.45-52 However, when Emperor Susenyos converted to Roman Catholicism in 1624, years of revolt and civil unrest followed resulting in thousands of deaths.Girma and Merid, Question of the Union of the Churches, pps.91;97-104. The Jesuit missionaries had offended the Orthodox faith of the local Ethiopians, and on 25 June 1632 Susenyos' son, Emperor Fasilides, declared the state religion to again be Ethiopian Orthodox Christianity, and expelled the Jesuit missionaries and other Europeans.Girma and Merid, Question of the Union of the Churches, pp.105.van Donzel, Emeri, \\"Fasilädäs\\" in Siegbert Uhlig, ed., Encyclopaedia Aethiopica: D-Ha (Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz Verlag, 2005), p. 500. All of this contributed to Ethiopia's isolation from 1755 to 1855, called the Zemene Mesafint or \\"Age of Princes.\\" The Emperors became figureheads, controlled by warlords like Ras Mikael Sehul of Tigray, and later by the Oromo Yejju dynasty.Pankhurst, Richard, The Ethiopian Royal Chronicles, (London:Oxford University Press, 1967), pp. 139-143. Ethiopian isolationism ended following a British mission that concluded an alliance between the two nations; however, it was not until the reign of Emperor Tewodros II, who began modernizing Ethiopia and recentralising power in the Emperor, that Ethiopia began to take part in world affairs once again. The 1880s were marked by the Scramble for Africa and modernisation in Ethiopia, when the Italians began to vie with the British for influence in bordering regions. Asseb, a port near the southern entrance of the Red Sea, was bought from the local Afar sultan, vassal to the Ethiopian Emperor, in March 1870 by an Italian company, which by 1890 led to the Italian colony of Eritrea. Conflicts between the two countries resulted in the Battle of Adowa in 1896, whereupon the Ethiopians defeated the Italian forces and remained independent, under the rule of Menelik II. Italy and Ethiopia signed a provisional treaty of peace on 26 October 1896. The early 20th century was marked by the reign of Emperor Lej Iyasu, who undertook the rapid modernisation of Ethiopia -- interrupted only by the brief Italian occupation (1936-1941).Clapham, Christopher, \\"Ḫaylä Śəllase I\\" in Siegbert von Uhlig, ed., Encyclopaedia Aethiopica: D-Ha (Wiesbaden:Harrassowitz Verlag, 2005), pp. 1062-3. British and patriot Ethiopian troops liberated the Ethiopian homeland in 1941, which was followed by sovereignty on 31 January 1941 and British recognition of full sovereignty (i.e. without any special British privileges) with the signing of the Anglo-Ethiopian Agreement in December 1944.Clapham,\\"Ḫaylä Śəllase I\\", Aethiopica, p. 1063. ==FootnotesReferences== * E.

The band centers on Giuffre, but features many guest artists on its releases. Notable songs are \\"Insekt/Angel\\" and \\"When The Dark Rains Come\\" which were used on the DVD releases of The Matrix Revolutions, The Matrix Box Set and the Spider-Man Collector's Edition. Brainclaw was signed to BLC Productions in Little Rock, AR, and briefly to UK label, Juggernaut Music Group. The band is currently releasing music under its own imprint, Auroviral. ==Early years== The Brainclaw project began as an ongoing experiment in composing aggressive electronic music, born at Ithaca College in 1989. Pennsylvania, USA-native David Giuffre decided to begin composing more polished compositions with the end result of publishing a full album of electro-industrial music, using the large body of mostly unfocused and unfinished work he had created up to that point, from 1985 to 1988. He continued to accumulate new music gear and build what would eventually become Studio Auroviral. The result of this work was an album of music called Infrastrukture. Six more albums followed, (Painselectiv - 1991, Shrieking In Standby - 1993, Sect - 1994, Treason - 1996, Strange Protection - 1997 and the abortive half album, Bodyhorror - 1998) each building on the work of the previous one, slowly refining both recording technique and compositional structure. There was no serious attempt to release this music until mp3.com offered an inexpensive route for musical exposure.Brainclaw » About Brainclaw ==Other projects== In 1997, David was recruited to write and play in the newly-forming Philadelphia Goth Rock outfit, Carfax Abbey. This effectively put the Brainclaw project on hold. David wrote, sang and toured with this band for five years. After the band began moving in a different musical direction, David amiably parted ways with Carfax in early 2002, to make a serious attempt at rejuvenating the Brainclaw project. The project became more focused with the addition of partner Tara Giuffre. They began co-writing the new Brainclaw material. ==Debut album== As new songs were completed and released, internet radio stations began noticing the music, and began lending their support with plays of the new songs and reviews. The Official Brainclaw Website was completely re-designed. The selection of the song \\"Downsect\\" for the Spiderbite Studios CD compilation called Perversions of Industry would prove to be a far-reaching event, right into the present day. Brainclaw songs began climbing electronic music charts on the internet and alternative radio stations in many parts of the world. The rest of 2002 was spent writing songs, getting press and club/radio spins and promoting at events. The Insekt/Angel CD was self-released on March 1. ==Warner Brothers and Columbia TriStar== 2003 began with the band's first professional photoshoots by Philadelphia photographer Kyle Cassidy, further modifications and upgrades to the Official Brainclaw Website and a re-uniting with old bandmates in Carfax Abbey, who approached David and Tara with the idea of fleshing out and recording songs for Carfax’s full-length release, Second Skin. The latter half of the year saw increased activity in the press, with reviews of Brainclaw’s Promo EP CD, especially a positive review in Industrial Nation magazine. They finished up the Carfax Abbey CD as the year closed, having recorded and produced six new songs, and began preparations for the release of their own full-length CD, called Insekt/Angel. As the year ended, Warner Brothers, alerted to Brainclaw music because of the Spiderbite compilation appearance of a year ago, licensed the song \\"When the Dark Rains Come\\" for use in the DVD release of Matrix Revolutions. More worldwide publicity followed, as Columbia TriStar Motion Picture Group licensed \\"When The Dark Rains Come\\" and \\"Insekt/Angel\\" for use on the DVD release of the Spider-Man Collector’s Edition DVD. The new Brainclaw CD was finally released to an increasingly interested electronic music community, and reviews and support began arriving internationally, as well as from North America. Then, the Insekt/Angel CD was picked up for distribution by Metropolis Records. ==Live shows== David and Tara decided to bring a live Brainclaw show to the stage, and using the experience gained from five years touring with Carfax Abbey, the duo began fleshing out a stage performance set. James Sewell of Divers Lust came on board as a live drummer. Keyboardist Lorie K of Suture Seven also joined the live Brainclaw show. The 2004 shows were well-attended and reviewed, with a somewhat lighter schedule for the summer 2005 tour, to allow for the writing of a follow-up album to Insekt/Angel. Warner Brothers also licensed four more songs from Insekt/Angel for the Matrix DVD Box Set. In Spring, 2006 Lorie K. had a wonderful opportunity in early 2006 to relocate to Germany to pursue other projects, so the search began for a new live synthesist. ==Signing with BLC== In February, 2006, Brainclaw signed a deal with Arkansas-based independent label BLC Productions. The new Brainclaw CD, called Dead Monsters was released on BLC in both North America and Europe in April, 2006.Interview :: Brainclaw - Continuously Battling Demons Press opportunities and reviews occurred in such international publications as UK-based Kaleidoscope and Germany's Side-Line magazine.Brainclaw - \\"Tapping The Well Of Shadows\\" - interview, torrent, MP3, Free download In June, 2006, Kimberly Holler joined up as synthesist for live shows, and the Brainclaw Website was completely rebuilt around a totally interactive blog format. Brainclaw’s cover of \\"Work Hard\\" was selected to appear on the new Cryonica Music Depeche Mode Tribute CD, Bright Lights, Dark Room in the UK. ==Personnel changes and the nascent Deceptor album== With the separation and divorce of David and Tara in 2009, and Tara's decision to leave the band in 2011, the nearly completed new album Deceptor was temporarily put on hold. Brainclaw collaborated with Japan's Kenji Siratori and released \\"Regenerator P.I.G.\\" which was subsequently chosen for the trailer for Diehard 4's Japanese release. David rejoined Carfax Abbey as live synthesist, writer and producer and helped create Carfax's newest album, Caustic Revolution. In 2012, David began revamping the Deceptor album with live guitar tracks added by Carfax Abbey guitarist John Ruszin, with intentions of a late 2013/early 2014 release. During this time BLC Productions released Brainclaw from its contract to pursue other opportunities, after the death of its owner, Brandon Clarke. ==Signing With Juggernaut Music Group== In August 2014, Brainclaw and Juggernaut Music Group announced via a dual statement that they would be releasing Deceptor for a Christmas 2014 release. ==Long Absence, re-emergence and final release of Deceptor album== In 2015, just before the release of Deceptor, Juggernaut Music Group was dissolved by its ownership, and Brainclaw was released from its contract. David had remarried by then, and became a stepfather to two boys. David worked on small projects in the interim, including a Brainclaw remix of UK artist Stephen Wilkins' (LV426) song \\"We Are Random,\\" writing and singing new lyrics, with new production and remixing. Parenting and work as Manager of Media Services in New York City for Infobase Publishing became the focus, and David's first biological child was born in May of 2015, keeping his concentration on his family for some time. In summer of 2018, Brainclaw's music was chosen to appear in horror film Cherokee Creek, with special mixes of \\"Voluptuosa\\" and \\"Unsafe\\" appearing in the film. In December of 2019, Tara Lessard, long-time Brainclaw collaborator and former wife of David, succumbed to a long term illness and passed away. This event, coupled with the Covid19 lockdown, fueled David's desire to complete and release the languishing Deceptor album. David designed and completed cover artwork, and remastered all master audio tracks for the recording. Digital distributors were contacted and artwork and tracks were submitted for distribution. The album will be released officially on May 1, 2020. ==Discography== Album Releases: *Infrastrukture (1989 - out of print) *Painselectiv (1991 - out of print) *Shrieking In Standby (1993 - out of print) *Treason (1996 - out of print) *Strange Protection (1997 - out of print) *Bodyhorror/Sect (1998 - out of print) *Insekt/Angel (2004 - self- release, distributed internationally by Metropolis Records) *Dead Monsters (2006 - BLC Productions in North America, E-Noxe and Al!ve in Europe) *Deceptor (2020 - Auroviral) Compilation Appearances: *Perversions Of Industry (2003 - Spiderbite Studios) *Interbreeding III: Xenophobic (2004 - BLC Productions) *Interbreeding IV: Gefahrlich (2004 - BLC Productions) *Interbreeding V: Subhuman - The Alien Agenda (2005) - BLC Productions) *Interbreeding VII: Natural Enemies (2005 - BLC Productions) *Electro/R/Evolution Volume 1 (2005 - Static Sky Records) *Cryonica Tanz Volume 4 (2006 - Cryonica Music) *Interbreeding VIII: Elements Of Violence (2006 - BLC Productions) *Bright Lights, Dark Room: Depeche Mode Tribute (2006 - Cryonica Music) *Interbreeding IX: Kuru (2007 - BLC Productions) *Weatherhead 3 (2008 - Hypervoxx/Telegrammetry Rocordings) ==External links== *The Official Brainclaw website ==Notes== Category:Electro-industrial music groups Category:Electronic music groups from Pennsylvania ","title":"Brainclaw"},{"id":"6204655","text":"==Early transport== For thousands of years the Indigenous of the region used various networks of rivers across what is now known as the province of Manitoba. The Forks became an early meeting place for the purpose of trade. Situated at the confluence of the Red and the Assiniboine in what is now downtown Winnipeg, the Forks would prove to be the most important location for European and First Nations trade in Manitoba. The common method of transportation on these waterways during this time were often birch bark canoes generally used by the Indigenous while European traders would tend to use York boats. Overland transport in the 19th century was often by ox-drawn Red River cart, which could be built and maintained using only locally obtained material. ==Roads and expressways== Winnipeg is unique among cities its size in that it does not have freeways within the urban area. Beginning in 1958, the primarily suburban Metropolitan council proposed a system of freeways, including one that would have bisected the downtown area. The plan culminated in the monumental Winnipeg Area Transportation Study (WATS) of 1968. The extensive freeway plan faced stiff community opposition and was deemed over-ambitious. It was not implemented as a concerted undertaking, but construction of major traffic corridors follows the study to this day, including expressways such as Route 165/Bishop Grandin Blvd., although most are in the form of urban arterial roads, and no freeways are likely to be constructed within the urban area anytime soon. However, a one-mile stretch of freeway was built in the late 1950s, called the Disraeli Freeway (part of the Disraeli Bridge project), which is part of Route 42. A four-lane highway (the Perimeter Highway, which is mostly an expressway around the city (also known as a ring road) with interchanges and at-grade intersections) bypasses the city entirely, allowing travellers on the Trans-Canada Highway to avoid the city and continue east or west. The Perimeter Highway was chosen over the freeways that would have been in the city. Now the city is planning to create an Inner Perimeter Highway with Route 17, Route 90, Route 165, and Route 20. Many Manitoba provincial highways enter Winnipeg, but the majority lose their highway designation and become Winnipeg Routes once they reach the Perimeter Highway. At present, only two provincial highways pass entirely through the Winnipeg area: *Highway 1 and *Highway 59 (which is a northern continuation of US 59) and is also designated as Route 20 (or Lagimodière Boulevard) in Winnipeg. Several highways also converge on Winnipeg without passing entirely through the city. These include: * Highway 2, which meets with Highway 3 at the southwest Perimeter, * Highway 3, which becomes Route 155 (known as McGillivray Boulevard) in Winnipeg, * Highway 6, which is the main highway to northern Manitoba, * Highway 7, which becomes Route 90 (known through various street names) in Winnipeg, * Highway 8, which becomes Route 180 (known as McPhillips Street) in Winnipeg, * Highway 9, which becomes Route 52 (known as Main Street) in Winnipeg, and * Highway 15, which becomes Route 115 (known as Dugald Road) in Winnipeg, and * Highway 75 (a northern continuation of I-29 and US 75), which becomes Route 42 (known as Pembina Highway) in Winnipeg. (This road is an exception to the rule that only two provincial highways penetrate the Perimeter Highway, as Highway 75 actually continues until the intersection with Bison Drive / Chancellor Matheson Road (which leads to the Fort Garry campus of the University of Manitoba)). One noted feature of Winnipeg's urban road network is Confusion Corner, a complex intersection where four arterial roads and a special Winnipeg Transit bus lane are funnelled into a rhomboid-shaped loop of one-way streets at a junction with Osborne Street.David A. Wyatt, Winnipeg Transit and Osborne Junction (Confusion Corner). University of Manitoba. ==Public transit== Suburban Rapid Transit Co. interuban in Headingley, Manitoba. Note the misspelling on the train Winnipeg has had a public transit system since the 1880s, starting with horse-drawn streetcars. It had electric streetcars from 1891 until 1955, and electric trolley buses from 1938 until 1970. Winnipeg Transit now operates entirely with diesel buses. For decades, the city has explored the idea of a rapid transit link, either bus or rail, from downtown to the University of Manitoba's suburban campus. The most recent proposalTransit plans calls for several enhanced bus routes, which would extend across the city. These routes would use bus-only lanes for most of their length, with separate busways being built around congested sections. Winnipeg is home to many large transit bus manufacturers, including New Flyer Industries and Motor Coach Industries. New Flyer Industries supplies transit buses for many major North American cities including New York City and Vancouver, British Columbia. ===Winnipeg transit=== Commuters can be seen through the glass, and a mural can be seen on the side of an underpass where traffic flows beneath the new Osborne Station terminal on Winnipeg's Rapid Transit system, opened in April 2012. The public transit needs of Winnipeg are primarily met through Winnipeg Transit's regularly scheduled bus service. Primary bus routes run from 5:30 a.m. until just before 2:00 a.m. Monday to Saturday, and until just after midnight on Sunday. As of June 2019, 89 fixed routes plus four DART routes throughout the city. There are three types of routes: * Main line routes provide service from suburban neighbourhoods to downtown, observing all bus stops, and normally operate seven days a week. Some routes operate as crosstown routes, which means buses operate from one suburban area to another, in most cases passing through the downtown area. * Express routes operate mainly during rush hour from suburban neighbourhoods, observing a limited number of bus stops to downtown. * Suburban feeders generally provide service in suburban areas where ridership demand is lower. The Winnipeg RT is a 3 km bus transitway between Harkness and Jubilee Station. A Phase 2 extension between Beaumont and University of Manitoba and St. Norbert Station commenced April 12, 2020. ==Airports== Winnipeg is currently served by the Winnipeg James Armstrong Richardson International Airport (IATA: YWG, ICAO: CYWG) which was redeveloped, with a new passenger terminal completed in 2010. The old terminal was constructed in the early 1960s, is demolished. The airport is operational 24 hours per day, handling about 3.5 million passengers annually, and is part of the national airports system of Canada. It is the only international airport between Toronto and Calgary capable of handling large freighter aircraft, and as such handles many arctic flights. From 1937 to 1949, the airport was the headquarters and site of the national maintenance base of Air Canada which has moved to Montreal-Dorval. ==Railways== Winnipeg's Union Station Winnipeg is served by Via Rail, Canadian National Railway (CN), Canadian Pacific Railway (CP), Burlington Northern Santa Fe Manitoba and the Central Manitoba Railway, (CEMR). It is the only city between Vancouver and Thunder Bay, Ontario with direct U.S. connections. CN and CP operate large railyards, customer service operations and intermodal facilities inside Winnipeg. There are approximately 5,000 people employed in Winnipeg in the rail transportation industry. Via Rail operates out of Union Station, a grand neoclassical structure near The Forks in downtown Winnipeg. The station was built by the Canadian Northern Railway & National Transcontinental/Grand Trunk Pacific Railway and was designed by the same architects responsible for Grand Central Terminal in New York City. In addition to the major commercial railways, the City of Winnipeg owns and operates the Greater Winnipeg Water District Railway, which runs parallel to the city aqueduct to Shoal Lake. ==Bus terminal== The Winnipeg Bus Terminal is located at Winnipeg James Armstrong Richardson International Airport. Beaver Bus Lines commuter service between Selkirk, Manitoba and Winnipeg ended on June 30, 2016 after 68 years (1948–2016). Afterwards two succeeding companies, Exclusive Bus Lines, and Kasper Transportation tried unsuccessfully to keep Winnipeg–Selkirk service running. Since the end of October 31, 2018, Greyhound Canada no longer serves the Canadian Prairies. ==Taxi services== Winnipeg is served by several taxi companies, the three largest in order of size being Unicity, Duffy's and Spring Taxi. Fifty percent of Winnipeg residents can be expected to use a taxi at least once during the year. Both Unicity and Duffy's Taxi are co-ops where the individual participating co-op drivers own their own license and supply their own vehicle, while Spring Taxi owns a significant portion of its taxi fleet. Unicity is a cooperative which collectively owns the assets of the Unicity dispatch or taxi call center, and it is the largest taxi operation in Winnipeg. Unicity Taxi was formed by three smaller companies in the mid-1970s -- Moore's, Grosvenor and Yellow Taxi. The company has subsequently brought many smaller independent companies into its fleet and now offers 165 cars as well as an ultra modern dispatching (DDS Pathfinder) and accounting(taxicharger)systems to serve its customers. Duffy's taxi is a cooperative taxi firm that operates 154 vehicles, with a large call center that accepts approximately 2,800 calls per day. Duffy's Taxi was formed in the 1950s as an amalgamation of the original and much smaller Duffy's Taxi with Vets Nash Taxi which was a cooperative of war veterans. Spring Taxi is the newest and smallest centrally dispatched taxi company in Winnipeg, and the company owns 16 of the 32 Spring Taxi vehicles, with the remaining 16 being owner operated vehicles. ==Splash Dash water services== The Splash Dash water taxi service was created in the summer of 1992 after the Forks opened, as a shuttle service between various downtown areas. Initial fares were $2 for a \\"dock to dock return ticket\\" or $5 for a day pass. Three pontoon boats were utilized to transport passengers along the rivers. Service hours were from 11 am till 8 pm with 30 minute headways most of the day except during the lunch hour where headways were 20 minutes. In the early 2000s Hugo Dock was added. This is still the most western of the terminals for the River Spirit Water Bus Service, as it is officially known. The water taxi has struggled to operate since the opening, due to the problem of high water on both the Red and Assiniboine Rivers during most years. After the ice melt in spring, it may take several weeks, sometimes until late June or early July, for the waters of the two rivers to recede enough to allow the installation of the fixed and floating portions of the docks in use. Expansion plans had earlier called for the Splash Dash to run as far west as the Sherbrook-Maryland Bridge by 2007. As of 2012, the current one-way fare is $3.50. An unlimited day-pass is $15.00. ==Future plansActive transportation=== The city wants to connect AT missing links, with a bridge across the rail yards between Arlington and Salter, and a bridge across the Red River at Matheson. ===Transit=== There are plans to add additional transit corridors, each serving various areas in Winnipeg. These are: Eastern Transitway (downtown to Transcona), West Transitway (downtown to St. James and the Airport), and North Transitway (downtown to West Kildonan). ===Roads=== There are plans to: * Widen Kenaston to six lanes form Ness to Taylor. * Widen Marion * Extend Chief Peguis Trail to McPhilips * Widen St Mary's Road St. Anne's to Marion ==See also== *Red River cart *York boat *Alpha (sternwheeler) ==References * Splash Dash website * Duffy's Taxi website ","title":"Transport in Winnipeg"},{"id":"6204657","text":"Marine safety is one of the eleven missions of the United States Coast Guard. Coast Guard personnel inspect commercial vessels, respond to pollution, investigate marine casualties and merchant mariners, manage waterways, and license merchant mariners. Coast Guard officials also draft recommendations for the transit of hazardous cargo by ship, such as liquid natural gas. In addition to this mission, the Coast Guard carries out investigations to determine the cause of accidents on American-flagged (Flag State) ships or foreign ships in American waters (Port State). Among the activities of the Coast Guard is inspection of commercial boats carrying passengers for hire. Vessels carrying more than six passengers must show a Certificate of Inspection; this indicates the crews of such vessels have undergone drug testing, that the vessel's firefighting and lifesaving equipment is adequate and in good condition, and machinery, hull construction, wiring, stability, safety railings, and navigation equipment meet Federal standards.\\"Coast Guard to be on alert for illegal charter boats during pony swim.\\" Norfolk Daily Times, July 25, 2007. accessed 7-25-2007 ==Overview== The Coast Guard performs its marine safety mission by conducting marine inspection, marine investigation, waterways management, port safety, and merchant mariner credentialing activities. The marine safety mission is the largest mission performed by Prevention Departments at Coast Guard Sectors. Coast Guard personnel that contribute to the marine safety program at field units are eligible to earn the Marine Safety Insignia. ==Marine inspection== The Coast Guard is responsible for inspecting vessels (e.g., boats or ships) that are registered in the United States or are foreign ships in U.S. waters. The Coast Guard delegates this responsibility to the Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection. Inspections are done either under Flag State responsibility or Port State responsibility. The four basic categories of vessels subject to inspection are: *Passenger vessels. **This category of vessel includes crew boats, nautical school vessels, cruise ships, excursion vessels, charter fishing boats, etc., carrying more than six passengers. *Tank vessels. **This category of vessel includes tank ships and tank barges. *Cargo vessels. **This category of vessel includes container vessels, freight vessels, roll on/roll off (RO/RO), etc. *Special use vessels. **This category of vessel includes mobile offshore drilling units (MODU) offshore supply vessels (OSV), oceanographic research vessel (ORV), oil spill response vessel (OSRV), nautical school vessels, sailing school vessels, etc. There are two kinds of inspections: Safety and Security. Inspections of vessel safety systems includes the following: * Hull inspection to ensure seaworthiness of vessel. * Main/auxiliary power inspection to ensure safe and operable machinery for vessel propulsion and emergency power. * Boiler inspection to ensure that it is structurally sound with operable safety devices. * Electrical systems inspection to ensure satisfactory installation of wiring and equipment. * Lifesaving systems inspection to ensure satisfactory and adequate means to abandon ship. * Firefighting systems inspection to ensure fixed and portable devices are suitable for the intended space and type of fire. * Navigation inspection to ensure adequacy and operation of navigation equipment. * Pollution prevention inspection to ensure compliance with international regulations and domestic laws. Inspections of vessel security systems includes the following: * Verification of security related documents and certificates such as the ship security plan, International Ship Security Certificate and Declaration of Security. * Ensure appropriate training drills, and exercises are being conducted. * Ensure required on board security procedures are in place. ==Marine investigation== Coast Guard Marine Investigator Badge The Coast Guard investigates marine casualties and allegations of improper Merchant Mariner actions to determine cause, and to prevent future occurrences under its Marine Safety mission. There are two kinds of investigations: Marine casualty investigations, and personnel actions. ===Marine casualty investigations=== Marine casualty investigations are carried out for the following: * Death of an individual. * Serious injury to an individual. * Material loss of property. * Material damage affecting the seaworthiness or efficiency of the vessel. * Significant harm to the environment. ===Personnel actions=== Investigations are also conducted to determine if personnel actions by licensed or documented merchant mariners constitute one or more of the following: * Misconduct. * Negligence. * Incompetence. * Violation of law or regulation. These investigations may result in a suspension and revocation action, which is an administrative process to determine the fitness of an individual to retain or continue to operate under the authority of his/her merchant Mariner document or license. These hearings are not criminal proceedings but rather administrative in nature. ==Waterways management== The program manages, influences, and provides access to a safe, secure, efficient and environmentally sound waterways system by providing marine safety information to the public, processing marine event permits, bridge administration and marine transportation system services. ==Port safety== The port safety function has a long history in the Coast Guard. It was expanded during the 20th century to include the protection of ports, harbors, vessels, and waterfront facilities against accidents, negligence, and sabotage. These responsibilities have been assigned to the COTP primarily through the Ports and Waterways Safety Act of 1972. This Act resulted from several major groundings and oil spills and provided port safety authority for the COTP to protect the use of port transportation facilities, and to enhance efforts against the degradation of the marine environment. The port safety mission is primarily concerned with the prevention of accidental damage to ports, facilities, and ships in order to protect the environment and facilitate commerce. The major activities that support the Port Safety mission include: * Pollution prevention. * Pollution investigation. * Harbor patrols and surveillance. * Contingency planning. * Drills and exercises. * Monitoring of liquid and hazardous cargo transfers. * Monitoring of fuel transfers. * Container inspections. * Facilities inspections. * Explosive cargo loading supervision. The Captain can close a port and direct private vessels to depart or take protective measures if necessary, such as to prepare for a hurricane.Example: Procedures at the Port of Houston/Galveston While port safety is concerned with accidents that harm people or property, port security (as a part of maritime security) is concerned with deliberate acts intended to harm people or property. ==Merchant mariner credentialing== In the United States, the Coast Guard is responsible for evaluating, certifying, and credentialing U.S. merchant mariners. All mariners receive a Merchant Mariner Credential from the Coast Guard, and are also required to obtain a Transportation Worker Identification Credential from the Transportation Security Administration. ==References== Category:United States Coast Guard ","title":"Marine safety (USCG)"},{"id":"6204668","text":"Aidan Browne (b.

It is home to Italian Americans, Latin Americans, Irish Americans and their descendants. South Trenton is Trenton's most diverse neighborhood and borders Hamilton Township to the Southeast and the Delaware River to the West. It had a brief existence as an independent municipality from 1840 to 1851. South Trenton was incorporated as a borough by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on February 28, 1840, from portions of Nottingham Township. The borough was annexed by Trenton on April 14, 1851.\\"The Story of New Jersey's Civil Boundaries: 1606-1968\\", John P. Snyder, Bureau of Geology and Topography; Trenton, New Jersey; 1969. p. 164.Chronology of Important Events. Accessed March 25, 2007. South Trenton is home to Trenton's famed Chambersburg neighborhood also known as \\"The ‘Burg’”. It is historically Trenton's most diverse immigrant community and had residents hailing from places such as Poland, Slovakia, Ireland, Hungary, Ukraine and Germany, though eventually mostly Italian immigrants and their offspring came to dominate the neighborhood, and it has since been known for its Italian-American population. It is also known for being the Restaurant District of Trenton, with many of the restaurants in the neighborhood specializing in Italian cuisine. Chambersburg also hosts the annual Italian celebration called the Feast of Madonna or the Feast of Lights, further reflecting its cultural and religious roots. In recent years, South Trenton has been experiencing a sharp rise in residents from Latin America, especially Puerto Rico. In the southernmost part of South Trenton (and therefore the entire city) known as \\"The Bottom,\\" the concentration of Puerto Ricans is especially noticeable. There are still large concentrations of Puerto Ricans but more recently Guatemalan, Costa Rican, and Ecuadorian immigrants have come to the neighborhood. Many have set up new stores and businesses alongside Italian-Americans. Today, South Broad St. in South Trenton is home to Trenton's largest population of Latinos. ==Landmarks== A sign for the Italian Peoples Bakery on Butler Street, a neighborhood landmark Landmarks in South Trenton include the First Baptist Church of Trenton located at the corner of Centre and Bridge Street which was founded in 1805. The Sun National Bank Center was completed in 1999 and hosts hundreds of events per year from hockey games to musical concerts to job fairs as well as the very popular PrimeTime Shootout showcasing some of the nation's best talent in high school basketball. The 2003 PrimeTime Shootout was the site of the highest-scoring game of LeBron James' high school career. It is located at the corner of South Broad St. and Hamilton Ave. The Trenton Thunder's stadium, Arm & Hammer Park, is located at the end of Cass Street (nicknamed \\"Thunder Road\\"). It is the Class AA-affiliate of the New York Yankees (formerly the Detroit Tigers and the Boston Red Sox) and counts Tony Clark, Carl Pavano, Trot Nixon, Nomar Garciaparra, David Eckstein, Dioner Navarro, Chen Ming-Wing, Phil Hughes, Robinson Cano, Melky Cabrera, Joba Chamberlain, Ian Kennedy, Bret Saberhagen, Derek Jeter, Bernie Williams, and Roger Clemens (the latter four as injury rehabs). There were two other Trenton minor league teams: the Trenton Senators and the Trenton Giants. The Trenton Giants once had Willie Mays (see Say Hey: The Autobiography of Willie Mays, by Willie Mays with Lou Sahadi, copyright 1988, starting at p. 46) among its former players. The New Jersey State Prison (NJSP) is also located in South Trenton mainly along 2nd St. and has a mural dedicated to the Trenton Thunder along its side that faces Thunder Road. Arm & Hammer Park Another very famous landmark of South Trenton and Chambersburg is the famed and renowned Italian Peoples Bakery. Known as the \\"Pride of Chambersburg\\", it has served the neighborhood bread and Italian baked goods for over 80 years. It is still owned and operated by descendants of the same family that started the business in 1936. They now have several locations in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, but their main location is in the Heart of Chambersburg at 61-63 Butler Street, near the Italian Banquet Hall Roman Hall, and near St Joachims Catholic Church and many other Chambersburg businesses.Italian Peoples Bakeryhttp://www.trentonian.com/articles/2008/02/04/past%20stories/20007950.txt ==History== The Roebling Machine Shop, oldest building in the Roebling complex, now a museum space In April 1828, all South Trenton from the Assunpink southward was included in Nottingham Township. Trenton was considered the section north of the creek. Nottingham was divided, however, on April 11, 1842, the territory set off being thenceforth known as Hamilton Township. In 1831, John A. Roebling migrated from Germany, moving to Trenton in about 1848, when he purchased some acres of land on South Broad Street where his new wire plant would be located. In 1851, South Trenton was annexed as part of Trenton. This also included the areas of Mill Hill and Bloomsbury. 5 years later, the part of Hamilton known as Lamberton was annexed as well. Mill Hill was the sight of some of the earliest known industrial development in Trenton. Residents were mostly working and middle class: industrial workers, clerks, shopkeepers, teachers and government workers. Mill Hill grew rapidly in the second half of the nineteenth century, with some decline toward the end of the century. An analysis of households based on city directories of this period charts the composition of the neighborhood. Many people consider Chambersburg part of South Trenton and call the area of the Streets of Lamberton, Cass, and Centre as \\"The Bottom\\" because of its urban area and the rise in crime along these streets. ==Decline and rise in crime== The decline of the South Ward began with the building of new suburban homes in the towns surrounding Trenton in the 1950s and 1960s. Many old factories closed and businesses left the area. Many cities experienced urban decay and a rise in crime, and Trenton did as well. In 1958, a young religious fanatic who grew up in a broken home stormed St. Joachim's Church and shot three nuns, and then escaped out the back as police fired 1,000 rounds at shadows in the front window of the nunnery. Until the late 1960s crime was sporadic. A South Broad Street home was the site of three burglaries between 1966 and 1970. What made the robberies more interesting was that the building adjacent to them was the home of the Trenton Police Department. Obviously having a precinct next door did not discourage the thieves. However, South Trenton was for the most part unaffected by the Trenton Riots of 1968 while downtown was looted and burned. ===Mafia=== The Mafia continues to operate in the area, with most members being associates of the New Jersey Mafia and Philadelphia Mafia. A notorious Mafia murder allegedly occurred in mid-February 1981, when an ambitious, young, half-Irish, half-Italian Trenton gangster named Frank Stillitano's corpse was found stuffed into the trunk of a car, which was linked to his own brother-in-law 12 days later, at Philadelphia International Airport. He had been shot behind the left ear and in the left knee. Cops from Philly to Trenton to New York knew right away who killed Frank \\"Frankie Stale\\" Stillitano, 28: He was known for shaking down tavern owners and small businesses and was not a very admirable character; soldiers from the Gambino crime family made the hit to avenge Stillitano's slaying of Trenton capo Nicky Russo's son on March 24, 1979. Trenton wouldn't find out who killed Frankie Stale until May 1997, when Salvatore \\"Sammy the Bull\\" Gravano came out with a book in which he admitted killing Stillitano and 18 other mobsters, including a Trenton capo he came to admire, John \\"Johnny Keys\\" Simone. ===Street gangs=== The first known street gang in South Trenton was the \\"South Trenton River Rats\\" formed in the early 1960s. This group was famously described in the book Rise of the River Rat by Tony Capps as \\"a loose conglomeration of people with a common cause.\\" In the Latin American areas of South Trenton, Guatemalan gangs have come to challenge the long-established dominance of the Latin Kings in South Trenton. In addition to the Latin Kings, South Trenton is home to many members of the gangs GTO (Guatemalans Taking Over), the Ñetas, MS-13, the Crips, and the Bloods. Some suspect that the Maniac Latin Disciples are trying to move in as well due to recent graffiti. Most of these divergent groups' members come to a head at the local junior high school for South Trenton, Grace A. Dunn Middle School, also known as Junior High School Number Four or simply \\"Jr. 4\\". This has played a part in making Jr. 4 one of five \\"persistently dangerous schools\\" in the State of New Jersey according to No Child Left Behind reporting from 2004 through 2006. Despite these realities, South Trenton is considered by many to be the safest neighborhood in Trenton with relatively low rates of violent crime when compared with other parts of New Jersey's capital city. There was a sharp rise in crime during the mid-1990s, but by the mid-2000s, crime rates in South Trenton, especially the number of violent crimes, had decreased significantly along with crime rates throughout the country. ==References== Category:Italian-American culture in New Jersey Category:Little Italys in the United States Category:Neighborhoods in Trenton, New Jersey Category:Former boroughs in New Jersey Category:Restaurant districts and streets in the United States Category:Populated places established in 1840 ","title":"South Trenton, New Jersey"},{"id":"6204711","text":"Flushed Away is an action-adventure video game based on the animated film of the same name and released in 2006 by Monkey Bar Games for Nintendo GameCube, PlayStation 2, Game Boy Advance, and Nintendo DS. It was released in Japan for the Nintendo DS as Volume 17 of the Simple series. None of the voice actors from the film reprise their roles in the video game. ==Gameplay== Flushed Away is based around platform gameplay, with the player controlling the two main characters from the film and guiding them through hazard-filled environments. Environments and enemies are based on those in the film, although several areas and creatures not seen in the film are also included. Interspersed throughout the game are mini-game sequences involving shooting enemies with a golf-ball firing turret, and taking control of a boat in a chase sequence. Some multiplayer minigames are also included, based around puzzle and shoot-'em-up mechanics. ==Plot== Much different compared to the film, Roderick St. James lives in an apartment, in Kensington, with his owners, until they go away for a holiday. Gilbert and Sulivan, who weren't seen in the film, all help Roddy out with his obstacle course and fencing skills. As they explore more, they hear an explosion, coming from the kitchen. They found that Sid has raided the kitchen and is planning to stay. Roddy schemes to get rid of Sid, but quickly backfires as Sid flushes him down the toilet, thinking of it as a trap. As soon as Roddy ends up in another world, Ratropolis, he bumps into Socketset, who gives him his first task: Collect a jar of flies. Meanwhile, Rita sneaks into the Toad's lair, grabs the ruby and after escaping Spike and Whitey, escapes on her Jammy Dodger. Roddy investigates but bumps into Rita, who then decide to team up to escape Spike, Whitey and the other rats. After escaping the rats, using ammunition and speed, Rita swerves the Jammy Dodger out of control and crashes onto a platform, where Spike and Whitey capture them both and take them to the Toad. They are sent to the freezer, locked up, and be frozen for theft of the precious ruby. However, Roddy and Rita escape and the Toad orders his henchrats to chase the escapees down. Roddy desperately tries to catch up to Rita, while avoiding either Spike, Whitey and the Toad's henchrats along the way. He makes it to the bridge, jumps off the walkway and lands onto the Jammy Dodger, spraining his back while trying to escape the henchrats. Rita allows Roddy to stay on the Jammy Dodger, as he had dropped in. He then, painfully, thanks Rita for the lift. Later, Roddy is claimed \\"The Chosen One\\" by the prophet rat and is told to speak with Charlie Wu, who gives Roddy a rescue mission, to save the orphanage from flooding. In order to do this, he and Rita must journey, via the Jammy Dodger. They reach the clogged drain and as soon as Roddy launches the catapult, it releases the water and it starts draining too fast, giving Roddy and Rita the signal to get clear. Charlie Wu is pleased that his children are safe. Then, Socketset gives Roddy another job: Collect another jar full of flies. Upon exploring the caves, Roddy finds a deeper cave, where he comes across an arachnid, who sees Roddy as lunch. Roddy defeats her and then retrieves a new sword, which is a reference to Disney's The Sword in the Stone. After a few side missions, from Socketset and Charlie Wu, Roddy ventures through Little Soho and Chinatown, to complete his side tasks. As Roddy and Rita venture more on the Jammy Dodger, they hear a lot of cheering and shouting going on. It turns out that England has made it to the World Cup Finals and the rats go down to Little Soho to stir things up. After encountering hooligans, Roddy finds a door that is blocked by wooden and metal crates. Eventually, after the puzzle is solved and the door is unlocked, both Roddy and Rita can continue their journey. However, they find that the fans have decided to have a battle called \\"Castle Siege.\\" In order for England to win, Germany's flags must be eliminated. England wins and Germany loses, so Roddy and Rita continue their journey. Along the way, they encounter Le Frog and his henchfrogs. As soon as Rita speeds and crashes the Jammy Dodger on the dock, completely knocking Le Frog and his henchfrogs off their feet. Le Frog and his henchmen split apart, so does Roddy and Rita. Roddy faces Le Frog and then defeats him. Upon leaving, Le Frog gets up and tries to get Roddy back, but is knocked out by a falling chandelier, that had the rope cut by Roddy's sword. As Roddy and Rita leave, they are captured by Spike and Whitey and are taken to the Toad's lair. Once they arrive at the Toad's lair, the Toad tells Roddy and Rita his greatest plan to flush all the rodents, with a giant wave, by opening the floodgate. However, Roddy and Rita soon tell the Toad that thousands of toilets, in London, are used, as many people are watching the football on TV. When it is halftime, many people will go to the toilets, dispose of their liquids and then flush it down the drain. When the toilets start flushing, it will cause a huge wave that will destroy the city the rats live. The Toad, enraged about having his plan being revealed, kicks both Roddy and Rita off, unaware that they are hanging on to each other, and then tells his henchrats to stop Roddy and Rita from escaping. The final battle occurs when Roddy is faced with dodging the Toad's throwable objects, by hitting each console 3 times. Then, Rita is faced to fight Fat Barry, Lady Killer and Thimblenose Ted, by using, everything she can, to weaken them and make it easy for them to take a hit. She also uses some lights, blinding Thimblenose Ted and by blowing Lady Killer's wig off his head with a wind from the vent. After the henchrats are defeated, Roddy and Rita's final task is to defeat the Toad. Rita's bungee manages to weaken the supports and the Toad is left hanging, with his tongue stuck to something, as he is defeated. Afterwards, Rita is asked by Roddy if she needs a first mate, which she obliges and runs off. However, Roddy runs after her and lands perfectly on the Jammy Dodger, with Rita controlling the Jammy Dodger, allowing it to speed up, making Roddy fall over. However, Rita then tells Roddy that he can be the captain, every other day. As the screen fades out, the words 'The End' with a question mark at the end, appear on the centre of the screen. ==Voices== *Zachary Throne as Roddy St. James *Susan Duerden as Rita *Fred Tatasciore as The Toad *Steven Blum as Le Frog *Bill Farmer as Spike *Drew Massey as Whitey *Oliver Muirhead as Sid *Leigh-Allyn Baker as Rita's Mum and Rita's Grandmother *James N.

The label primarily caters to folk music artists and bands, and has signed acts such as Denver, Starland Vocal Band (and its precursor, Fat City), Maxine Nightingale, Johnny's Dance Band, Nanette Mancini, and Tom Crum. Founded as a subsidiary of RCA Records under the name Windsong Records, Windstar became an independent label in 1986, when RCA and Denver parted. Denver and RCA were not on particularly good terms towards the end of their partnership due to a change in management at RCA with executives not particularly interested in Denver's genre of music.

The series focuses on wild rabbit-like creatures known as Rabbids, who like to cause havoc and mischief, speak gibberish and scream whenever they experience adrenaline rushes. The series consists mainly of party video games, though other genres have been explored as well. Though they were initially introduced as antagonists in the Rayman series of games, the popularity of the characters, aided by various viral videos and media appearances, led Raving Rabbids to become its own separate franchise, dropping the Rayman name as of 2009's Rabbids Go Home. The Rabbids have gone on to appear in other expanded media, such as a TV show and a feature film currently in development, as well as making guest appearances in other Ubisoft games. As of April 2014, the series had sold over 14 million units worldwide. ==Concept and creation== The earliest Rayman 4 trailers depicted menacing rabbits, simply appearing from underground with a blank stare in various shapes and forms, smaller eyes and furry. At this point, trailers showed the game as an adventure game with fight stages, where Rayman would need to punch and kick himself kung fu style through a horde of zombie-bunnies. As the game concept evolved, from one of a central objective to minigames, a series of viral videos were created by Marketing Manager Adrian Lacey and Animator Charles Beirnaert which became incredibly successful on the new media platform YouTube. The rabbits slowly evolved into various merchandising products such as the Rabbid figures, which were much more conscious and amusing, changing from merely being enemies to fight through into more memorable characters with various traits and quirks. Rayman creator Michel Ancel described the bunnies as \\"vicious, but at the same time [...] totally stupid\\". In a video interview, project lead Loïc Gounon confirmed the possibility of splitting the Rayman and Rabbid series apart, mentioning that the Rabbids \\"managed to hit a bit more adult and a bit more older audience than the previous Raymans\\". ==Characters== Rabbids - Rabbids are wild rabbit-like creatures who like to cause havoc and mischief on Rayman's world (where they came from), the human world, and others and are gibberish speaking and yell \\"BWAH!\\" whenever they experience adrenaline rushes. They were originally the antagonists; however, due to increase in popularity, they became the protagonists in Rabbids Go Home. Rayman - the main protagonist of the first three games. He always foils the Rabbids' evil plans. When the Rabbids became the protagonists of the franchise, Rayman was dropped, but continues to appear in his own games. Professor Barranco III - the supreme leader of the Rabbids who planned out all of their invasions on Rayman's world, Earth and others. He is seen in the games Rayman Raving Rabbids 2, Rabbids: Travel in Time and Rabbids: Alive and Kicking as the main antagonist (despite having a minor role in RRR 2 and RTiT). He is one of the rare smart Rabbids to exist, but can be easily fooled as well. In RAaK he has a Rabbid scientist as his second in command, who would later go on to become a major character in the TV series. Serguei - Serguei is the main villain of Rayman Raving Rabbids. He is a large, black rabbid who abducted Rayman and the Globox kids and forced them to take part in the Rabbids Olympics filled with deadly challenges. In the end, Rayman manages to escape and free most of the Globox kids. It is unknown what happens to Serguei at that point, though his absence in further games suggest that he was relieved of his duties due to failure in keeping Rayman. The Semi-Leaders - the Semi-leaders are fat, lazy and angry Rabbids who serve as the secondary antagonists of Rayman Raving Rabbids 2. They constantly force the Rabbids to bring them food and don't do pretty much anything other than sitting or lying around and keeping things in check. They each have different themes in clothing. ==Games== {  + - ! Year ! Title ! Developer(s) !

In Red Steel, the Rabbids appear as enemies in one of the game's later stages. The Wii version of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Smash-Up includes three different types of Rabbids as playable characters, along with a stage based on Rabbids Go Home. Toys of the Rabbids appear as hidden easter eggs in Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Conviction and Watch Dogs. In Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag, a cheat can be used to turn the game's enemies into Rabbids. The song \\"Here Comes the Hotstepper\\" in Just Dance 2 includes a Rabbid who attempts to dance with the choreographer. Similarly, the alternate version of the song \\"Naughty Girl\\" in the Nintendo Switch version of Just Dance 2018 via Just Dance Unlimited subscription service includes Rabbid Peach from Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle as the main choreographer. Super Smash Bros.

In early 2012, Ubisoft Motion Pictures called on the French animation studio TeamTO to create most of the CGI parts of the series. On E3 2013, it was announced that it would be an interactive Xbox One show entitled Rabbids Invasion. The show aired for three seasons on Nickelodeon from August 3, 2013 through June 23, 2017. On July 1, 2019, a fourth season was released on Netflix. === Film === A live-action/animated movie based on the franchise was in the works by Columbia Pictures and Sony Pictures Entertainment.https://www.polygon.com/2014/2/10/5398054/ubisoft-teams-with- sony-pictures-for-rabbids-movie However, in 2019, Lionsgate and Ubisoft signed a deal to produce the Rabbids movie with Todd Strauss-Schulson in talks to direct the movie with Todd Lieberman and David Hoberman as producers. It is now being developed by Lionsgate, Ubisoft Motion Pictures, Mandeville Films, and Stoopid Buddy Stoodios, with Matt Senreich, Tom Sheppard, and Zeb Wells set to write the film, while revised by Todd Rosenberg.https://news.ubisoft.com/en- us/article/5RDXurrIc8q7gyZuU3vY3i/ubisoft-and-lionsgate-to-develop-rabbids- film === Comic book series === A comic book series based on the franchise has been released in France, Belgium and Switzerland. All comic strips are drawn by the French cartoonist Romaine Pujol and written by Thithaume. There are ten volumes thus far. === Merchandising === Aside from video games and the comic book series mentioned above, the Rabbids also have other merchandising such as T-shirts, figurines, plush toys, school equipment, fan club magazines, and for a limited time, a Happy Meal toy. A Raving Rabbids themed version of the card game Jungle Speed was also released in France. === Licensing === The Rabbids franchise has also been licensed for the out-of-home entertainment market such as the recent collaboration with arcade game manufacturer LAI Games to produce Virtual Rabbids: The Big Ride, an attendant-free VR attraction. == Reception == The Rabbids from the Raving Rabbids series became massively popular both through the teaser trailers and the game itself. IGN has stated that the Rabbids have \\"more personality and charisma than 10 of the most popular video game mascots combined\\", and that the bunnies have literally \\"upstaged Rayman himself\\". GameSpot has noted, \\"The Rabbids themselves are almost exclusively responsible for [selling the game's humor], as they are, without a doubt, hysterical. They're adorably designed, with their dumb stares, high-pitched shrieks, and a penchant for taking comedic bumps.\\" The success of the Rabbid characters led the developers to create more games in the franchise, and eventually even remove Rayman from them entirely. This was first hinted at in the launch trailer of the first game, where Rayman, despite being the title character, only appears for a fraction of a second, only to be squashed flat by a couch taken over by Rabbids. In Rayman Raving Rabbids 2, Rayman disguises himself as a Rabbid, causing the game to put more emphasis on them than on Rayman himself. Rayman Raving Rabbids: TV Party was considered further evidence, as Rayman, who is no longer playable, only appears in the game's cutscenes although he does make a couple cameos and references in the gameplay of some minigames, and is more scared and annoyed by the Rabbids despite his bravery against the Rabbids in Rayman Raving Rabbids. This was then proven to be true with the announcement of Rabbids Go Home, which does not feature Rayman at all and doesn't explain what happened to him in the previous Rabbids game. The Rayman series' genre shift and decline in critical acclaim has been linked to Rabbids by fans and critics. Before Rabbids Go Home release, when asked about why Rayman was omitted, director Jacques Exertier confirmed that Rayman would return for more action-adventure video games. A Rayman-only game was released on March 1, 2011, but was merely a Nintendo 3DS re-release of Rayman 2: The Great Escape, titled Rayman 3D. However, Rayman Origins, a new Rayman game, was released in 2011 followed by a sequel, Rayman Legends released in September 2013. Both games were released to critical acclaim. The music style for the franchise was created by composer Mark Griskey. Mark worked with Audio Director Yoan Fanise to define the comedic style of the early games and the style was continued with the further versions of the franchise. http://www.griskey.com ==References *Official website Category:Ubisoft franchises Category:Fictional hares and rabbits Category:Video game spin-offs Category:Video game franchises introduced in 2006 ","title":"Raving Rabbids"},{"id":"6204765","text":"In the ticketing system of the British rail network, tickets are normally issued to and from individual stations. In some instances, when there is more than one station in a town or other locality—especially where these are on different routes—it may be desirable for passengers to be able to travel to one station and back from another, or more generally to be able to choose which of the stations they wish to travel to. To accommodate this requirement, British Rail introduced a series of station groups: notional \\"common locations\\" to which tickets from stations outside that group would be issued. For example, Penge in South London has two stations: Penge East and Penge West. The former is served by trains from London Victoria to Orpington; the latter is on the route from London Bridge to West Croydon. For a traveller arriving at, for example, a London terminal station and intending to go to Penge, it makes little difference which route is chosen. Both stations are close together and serve the same area. Therefore, a ticket issued specifically to one of the Penge stations would be unduly restrictive—it would remove the opportunity to travel by a choice of equally convenient routes. A notional \\"Penge group\\" solves this problem: a ticket issued in this way would be interavailable. The concept is explained in the National Fares Manuals (NFMs) issued approximately three times per year by the British Railways Board (and, since privatisation, by the Association of Train Operating Companies) to stations, Rail Appointed Travel Agents and other ticket issuing authorities: \\"Fares for certain ... cities and towns are shown to and from a notional common station[.] All fares are quoted and all tickets should be issued to and from [these notional group] stations except for local journeys between two stations in the same group. Tickets issued to and from these [notional group] stations are valid to or from any of their associated stations, subject to normal route availability.\\" ==Terminology and appearance on tickets== An APTIS ticket issued for travel between the \\"Bedford Group\\" and the \\"Croydon Group\\", showing the pre-privatisation designations BEDFORD BR and CROYDON BR. A Shere SMART ticket issued for the same journey, showing the post-privatisation designations BEDFORD STATIONS and CROYDON STATIONS. These \\"locations\\" had to be shown in a standard, easily identifiable way on tickets. The method chosen by the British Railways Board was as follows: * Take the name of the actual location where the stations are: for Penge East and Penge West, PENGE. * Add the suffix BR to this: PENGE BR. Each station group was also allocated its own National Location Code (NLC)—a four-digit code used for accounting and to attribute revenue to locations on the railway network. Most station group codes were between 0250 and 0500. This NLC appeared on PORTIS/SPORTIS tickets, which by convention always showed the \\"origin\\" and \\"destination\\" NLCs as well as the code of the issuing point; but tickets from the APTIS system and its replacements always showed the NLC of the actual station of issue, even where a ticket was issued from a \\"station group\\" (except for some short-lived anomalies). After privatisation, the designation \\"BR\\" was no longer appropriate, although having been in use for more than 10 years it had become a convenient shorthand device for referring to the station groups concept in general (for example, National Fares Manuals continued to use the term \\"BR Stations\\"). A new designation had to be created which still took up little space on a ticket (location names are restricted to 16 characters on most ticket issuing systems) and which still conveyed a notion of interavailability. The solution, introduced gradually from November 1997 and uploaded to all ticket issuing systems by January 1998, was for BR to be changed to STNS or STATIONS as appropriate: * STNS if the location name was between 8 and 11 characters in length: for example, LIVERPOOL BR became LIVERPOOL STNS. * STATIONS if the location name was 7 characters or fewer: for example, DORKING BR became DORKING STATIONS. There were some deviations from this standard: * As GAINSBOROUGH is 12 characters in length, a meaningful abbreviation to signify the station grouping could not be created. As a result the Gainsborough group is simply shown as GAINSBOROUGH. * As GLASGOW STATIONS could have been mistakenly interpreted by passengers as referring to the whole of the Glasgow suburban rail network, it was used only briefly before being changed in mid-April 1998 to GLASGOW CEN/QST, specifically representing Glasgow Central and Glasgow Queen Street stations. Additionally, the London group is treated as a special case. It was created in April 1970 by BR's Southern Region as a grouping of their nine terminal stations named LONDON S.R., before being expanded in May 1983 to include all BR terminals under the name LONDON BR, and then LONDON BRIT RAIL from January 1989 until 1997. Rather than receiving the standard new name of LONDON STATIONS it was referred to simply as LONDON before becoming LONDON TERMINALS in April 1998, even though four of the eighteen stations included in the group are not technically termini. ==Existing groups== As of , 38 station groups (including the London group) are known to exist. The table shows the NLC allocated to each group, the pre- and post-privatisation renderings of the group name, and the stations included within it. {  - !Current Name !Former Name !NLC !Stations Included !Notes !Refs - BEDFORD STATIONS BEDFORD BR 0410 Bedford, Bedford St Johns   - BICESTER NTH/VIL  7934 Bicester North, Bicester Village The most recently created group, dating from 28 July 2015 Fares Feed dated 10 January 2017. - BIRMINGHAM STNS BIRMINGHAM BR 0418 Birmingham Moor Street, Birmingham New Street, Birmingham Snow Hill Birmingham Snow Hill was included from January 1988 following the reopening of the station.  - BOOTLE STATIONS align=\\"center\\"— 1780 Bootle New Strand, Bootle Oriel Road Introduced 26 September 1999.  - BRADFORD YK STNS BRADFORD YKS BR 0424 Bradford Forster Square, Bradford Interchange   - CANTERBURY STNS CANTERBURY BR 0428 Canterbury East, Canterbury West   - CATFORD STATIONS CATFORD BR 0258 Catford, Catford Bridge   - COLCHESTER STNS COLCHESTER BR 0254 Colchester, Colchester Town Introduced in May 1991.  - CROYDON STATIONS CROYDON BR 0449 East Croydon, West Croydon Tickets are valid to and from South Croydon as well, but tickets issued at South Croydon show that name.  - DORCHESTER STNS DORCHESTER BR 0429 Dorchester South, Dorchester West   - DORKING STATIONS DORKING BR 0416 Dorking, Dorking Deepdene, Dorking West   - EDENBRIDGE STNS EDENBRIDGE BR 0259 Edenbridge, Edenbridge Town   - ENFIELD STATIONS ENFIELD BR 0263 Enfield Chase, Enfield Town Enfield Lock has never been included.  - FALKIRK STATIONS FALKIRK BR 0431 Falkirk Grahamston, Falkirk High   - FARNBOROUGH STNS FARNBOROUGH BR 0260 Farnborough (Main), Farnborough North   - FOLKESTONE STNS FOLKESTONE BR 0432 Folkestone Central, Folkestone West Folkestone Harbour was included until closure in 2001.  - GAINSBOROUGH GAINSBOROUGH BR 0415 Gainsborough Central, Gainsborough Lea Road   - GLASGOW CEN/QST GLASGOW BR 0433 Glasgow Central, Glasgow Queen Street Occasionally seen as GLASGOW STATIONS in 1998; officially renamed GLASGOW CEN/QST from 27 September 1998.  - HELENSBURGH STNS HELENSBURGH BR 0404 Helensburgh Central, Helensburgh Upper   - HERTFORD STNS HERTFORD BR 0413 Hertford East, Hertford North   - LIVERPOOL STNS LIVERPOOL BR 0435 Liverpool Central, Liverpool James Street, Liverpool Lime Street, Moorfields   - LONDON TERMINALS LONDON BR 1072 Blackfriars, Cannon Street, Charing Cross, City Thameslink, Euston, Fenchurch Street, King's Cross, Liverpool Street, London Bridge, Marylebone, Moorgate, Old Street, Paddington, St Pancras, Vauxhall, Victoria, Waterloo, Waterloo East   - MAIDSTONE STNS MAIDSTONE BR 0437 Maidstone Barracks, Maidstone East, Maidstone West   - MANCHESTER STNS MANCHESTER BR 0438 Deansgate, Manchester Oxford Road, Manchester Piccadilly, Manchester Victoria Deansgate and Salford Central were included in the group until January 1989.

This only has practical relevance in situations where group stations are easily accessible from each other - for example, the Liverpool group, where all four stations can be reached directly from each of the others. == In other countries == Station groupings are also used on transport networks in other countries, though not necessarily to the same extent as in the UK. === Australia === Tickets issued by Victorian regional train and coach operator V/Line for travel to Melbourne city are issued to the group MELBOURNE Z1/2, indicating Myki Zones 1 and 2, and therefore including all stations on the Melbourne suburban rail network as well as all bus and tram services within those zones. === Germany === Rail tickets in Germany for travel distances over can be issued to station groups, which are referred to as Abgang-/Zielbahnhöfe mit tariflicher Gleichstellung (effectively destination stations with equal fares).

He was also the main analyst for BBC's coverage of the Super Bowl between 2008-2013 and 2016-2017. He also commentated on BBC's coverage of basketball at the 2012 Olympics and the 2016 Olympics. He is originally from Connecticut, US. == Career == Carlson played defensive end at Milford Academy as an underage academic scholarship student on a largely post-graduate teams, then tight end at Wesleyan University from 1968 to 1972 (where he was a contemporary of Bill Belichick).https://forum.nfluk.com/showthread.php?t=4115The Thinking Voice of the NFL: A Conversation with Mike Carlson PopMatters, 14 December 2008 After moving to the UK in 1977,User Profile: Michael Carlson Blogger Carlson worked as a sports editor for the television news agency UPITN before joining ABC Sports as their director of programming in Europe. Later he became Vice- President of European operations for Major League Baseball before beginning his freelance career. In 1991, he teamed up with Nick Halling to cover Major League Baseball for satellite station Screensport, a partnership which continued with the World League of American Football, and during the early years of the league's successor, NFL Europe, on Sky Sports. In 1994, Carlson left Major League Baseball and became a freelance journalist. He reviews books and film, and wrote three books in the Pocket Essentials series, on the film directors Sergio Leone, Clint Eastwood, and Oliver Stone. He also writes obituaries for The Guardian and The Independent and on sport for a number of outlets, including NFLUK.com. On screen he has also appeared occasionally as a baseball pundit on MLB on Five hosted by Jonny Gould, a sport he previously presented on Sky Sports in the mid-1990s. He also wrote the Channel Five Guide To Baseball. He is the commentator for World Baseball Classic on Eurosport. He has covered a variety of other sports on television including Basketball, Poker, Soccer, and Lacrosse. He has worked behind the scenes on the television coverage of both Olympic Games and FIFA World Cup tournaments. In 2000, he and Mark Webster provided commentary for the Meridian TV and ITV2 series Trans- Atlantic Wrestling Challenge. On 21 May 2011, Carlson \\"will call all the action from the Sheikh Amri Abeid Memorial Stadium in Arusha when Tanzania hosts the first game of college American Football to be played on the African continent.\\"http://www.ippmedia.com/frontend/index.php?l=28388 Since 2010 he has returned to Channel 4 to provide punditry for the 2011–12 NFL season and co-hosted the American sports podcast Americarnage with Nat Coombs and Dan Louw from 2011 to 2016. Carlson was the lead commentator for the BBC's coverage of the basketball at the 2012 Olympics, alongside co-commentator John Amaechi. Whilst commentating during the quarter-final game between Argentina and Brazil, Carlson was hit on the head by a rogue basketball that had been thrown off the court – his bewildered reaction became a popular video on the internet. He was also part of the commentary team for the BBC's coverage of the basketball at the 2016 Olympics, alongside Australian sports broadcasters Mark Chester, Matthew Hill, Steve Robilliard and Vitor Sobral. == NFL == In 1998, the United Kingdom terrestrial TV station Channel 5 began covering Monday Night Football for which Carlson was the regular analyst from the start until the channel's coverage ended in 2010. During this time he worked with hosts Martin Bayfield, Josh Chetwynd, Mark Webster, Simon Golding, Colin Murray and Nat Coombs. He contributed to now-defunct weekly American football newspaper First Down and covered NFL Europe for NFL.com, Pro Football Weekly, the International Herald Tribune, and for a couple of seasons, The Guardian. Carlson developed a few strange \\"catchphrases\\" during his commentary of NFL highlights broadcast during gaps in the live game, including a list of alternative names for stadia and teams e.g. Arizona Crads (half-Card, half crap), Newark Airport Jets & New Jersey Giants, \\"he couldn't be more alone if he was...\\" for touchdowns scored by players with nobody around them, with the punchline usually involving a celebrity or famous figure that has been caught with their trousers down, to making special note of anyone involved named \\"Nate\\", the name of his son. He often refers to player Torry Holt as \\"The Torry You Can Support\\" – a jibe at the Conservative Party's recent misfortunes in UK politics (they are known as the Tories). He also refers to Reggie Bush as \\"The Bush you can support\\" – a jibe at George W. Bush. Another common catchphrase is \\"and that pass was high, but not in the Ricky Williams sense,\\" referring to the player's use of marijuana. He developed a fictional award named \\"Trent of the Week\\" for the best player in the week's games named Trent. Some of Carlson's more elaborate comedic moments involved complex re-wordings of The Raven during a rough patch for the Baltimore Ravens, and singing a re- lyricised version of John Brown's Body entitled Jeff George Is Marching On – to a particularly miserable Dallas Cowboys performance, which included noted quarterback bust Ryan Leaf. Carlson was one of the analysts for the BBC's inaugural coverage of the Super Bowl in February 2008, hosted by Jake Humphrey, with Rod Woodson as his partner. He returned to analyse for the BBC during their first live regular season game at Wembley in October 2008, with Jerry Rice, again at Super Bowl XLIII, with Rod Woodson, and briefly during the recorded highlights of the 2009 Wembley match. He has also appeared on BBC Sport's \\"American Football\\" programme showing highlights of the playoffs during the 2009/10 season. Carlson has continued his work on the BBC, providing analysis in the highlights shows for both the International Series and Playoffs for the 2010/11 and 2011/12 season. Carlson joined Mark Chapman and Danny Amendola, of the St. Louis Rams, for the BBC's coverage of Super Bowl XLVI on 5–6 February 2012. On 6 September 2010 it was announced that Carlson would present Sunday Night Football on Channel 4. He was paired with Gary Imlach for the 2010 season and Danny Kelly in the 2011 season. Nat Coombs was announced as his new co-presenter for the 2012 season, re-forming their Channel 5 (and Americarnage) partnership. Channel 4's NFL coverage ended in 2015, and Carlson's coverage of live television games for the 2015 and 2016 seasons was limited to the BBC's coverage of the International Series and the Super Bowl. He has continued to appear on the BBC’s coverage of live games alongside Mark Chapman, Jason Bell, and Osi Umenyiora. In September 2017, Carlson joined Talksport as part of their live NFL coverage, and in 2018 launched his own Patreon.com site, Friday Morning Tight End, in which he picked every game of the NFL season, with a 67% success rate. == Personal == Carlson has been married twice. He has a son, Nathaniel. In addition he has written three books about movie directors (Sergio Leone, Clint Eastwood and Oliver Stone,is a published poet, Has written on arts, sports and politics for many newspapers and websites, is a blogger and is known for his love for professional wrestling. ==References== Category:1951 births Category:Living people Category:Major League Baseball broadcasters Category:National Football League announcers Category:American emigrants to England Category:English television presenters Category:English television executives Category:English sports broadcasters Category:English sportswriters Category:Wesleyan University alumni Category:Lacrosse announcers Category:Association football commentators Category:Olympic Games broadcasters ","title":"Mike Carlson"},{"id":"6204797","text":"Itatí is a town in the north of the province of Corrientes, Argentina.

View of the Paraná River from the bank at Itatí. The origin of Itatí was a reduction (indigenous town) established on 7 December 1615 by Franciscan friar Luis de Bolaños, with the name of Pura y Limpia Concepción de Nuestra Señora de Itatí. The proper foundation of Itatí as a town was by general Pedro Ferré, on 15 September 1825. Despite its small size, Itatí is renowned throughout the country due to the massive displays of devotion to the local advocation of the Virgin Mary. The physical center of these is the basilica (built in 1950), which preserves an allegedly miraculous wooden image of the Virgin of Itatí. On her feast day, 16 July, thousands of pilgrims from nearby and faraway regions, and even from neighbouring countries, come to Itatí to venerate the Virgin. The name Itatí comes from Guaraní, but there is disagreement as to its exact meaning; ita- undoubtedly corresponds to the Guaraní word for \\"stone\\" (appearing in a number of other toponyms, such as Itaipu), while the last part could refer to (moro)ti (\\"white\\") or tí (\\"nose\\"). == References == * * Argentina Total.

He served in the Royal Air Force for 40 years, from 1936 to 1976. From 1955, he concentrated mainly as an engineer involved with nuclear weapons. He succeeded his father as Earl of Ilchester in 1970, and was also an active cross-bench member of the House of Lords until 1999. ==Background and education== His father was Walter Angelo Fox- Strangways, 8th Earl of Ilchester. Fox-Strangways was born in Port Tawfiq in Egypt while his father was serving in the British foreign consular service. He was educated at the now-defunct Kingsbridge Grammar School, and joined the Royal Air Force (RAF) as an apprentice in January 1936, aged 15. ==World War II and post-war military career== He trained at RAF Halton and was posted to RAF Brize Norton, where he served during the early months of the Battle of Britain. According to family folklore, he was bathing when an August 1940 air raid began. He ran naked into an air-raid shelter, which happened to be reserved for members of the WAAF. After this introduction, he married one of them, Diana Simpson, in November 1941. He completed his service in the Second World War in India and the Far East. By his return to England in 1946, he was a Warrant Officer. He continued his service at RAF Negombo in Ceylon and RAF Kai Tak in Hong Kong. Fox-Strangeways was selected for commissioning and he attended the Royal Air Force Technical College at RAF Henlow in 1953. By the mid-1950s he was a Squadron Leader and became involved with the development of nuclear weapons at the Directorate of Air Armament Engineering. He then moved to the headquarters of RAF Bomber Command to work on the introduction of Thor intercontinental ballistic missiles, before working at the missile testing range at Woomera in South Australia. He then served at the V bomber base at RAF Finningley. As a wing commander, he served at RAF Biggin Hill, involved in recruitment of officers and aircrew. Finally, promoted to group captain, he was the assistant director of air weapons development at the Ministry of Technology, and was involved with the UK's Polaris ballistic missile programme. ==Succession to earldom and House of Lords== Fox-Strangways succeeded as Earl of Ilchester on the death of his father in 1970. He retired from the RAF in 1976, having held every rank from aircraft apprentice to group captain. In the House of Lords, he sat as a crossbencher from 1976, but waiting until 27 February 1980 to make his maiden speech. He attended regularly until the hereditary peers were removed from the Lords in 1999. He was a member of the Select committee on science and technology. Outside the House of Lords, he was a director of Nottingham Building Society from 1982 to 1989. He was active in the RAF Association at Biggin Hill. He was president of the Society of Engineers, and later a patron. He was a Fellow of the Nuclear Institute (formerly the Institute of Nuclear Engineers), and its president from 1982 to 1984. He was a Freeman of the Guild of Air Pilots and Air Navigators and became a liveryman in 1987. He was a Freemason in the St George and Corner Stone Lodge. He had no children, but was survived by his wife of over 64 years. On his death, the Earldom passed to his nephew, Robin Maurice Fox-Strangways, 10th Earl of Ilchester. ==References * Category:1920 births Category:2006 deaths Category:Royal Air Force officers Category:English engineers Category:Earls of Ilchester Maurice Category:Trenchard Brats Category:Royal Air Force personnel of World War II ","title":"Maurice Fox-Strangways, 9th Earl of Ilchester"},{"id":"6204909","text":"Daniel Óscar Alanís García (born 2 March 1986 in Mexico City)TelevisaDeportes.com  Daniel Óscar Alanís García is a Mexican football (soccer) player.

It differs from a Vickrey auction in that bids are not sealed; the \\"current highest bid\\" (defined as second-highest bid plus bid increment) is always displayed. == Description and use == eBay uses the term proxy bidding to refer to their implementation of an English second-price auction, in which the winning bidder pays the price of the second-highest bid, in addition to a defined increment. Though similar to a Vickrey auction, the bids are not sealed. The \\"current highest bid\\" (defined as second-highest bid plus bid increment) is always displayed. == Comparison and analysis == In a standard English auction, the winner pays the amount of their bid—regardless of competitors' bids—and it is therefore desirable to place a bid that exceeds the current highest bid by the smallest possible increment. Conversely, under proxy bidding, the price paid is determined only by competitors' bids and not by the amount of the new bid; this eliminates the economically rational incentive to place a bid below the amount one is willing to pay or to place multiple increasing bids. An \\"economically rational\\" bidder will therefore bid the maximum amount they are willing to pay on their first bid, and never raise their bid. eBay's approach, however, reveals the bidder's limit to rival bidders early in the auction, which can sometimes artificially inflate the price of the item higher than its actual intrinsic value, and ultimately encourages the practice of auction sniping. == References == Category:EBay Category:Types of auction ","title":"Proxy bid"},{"id":"6204919","text":"Audra Thomas (née CunninghamBFI Film and TV Database: Filmography: Audra Cunningham; accessed 15 June 2008) is a Northern Irish television presenter.

The findings of Coast Guard Marine Casualty Investigations are used to create safety recommendations to prevent future marine casualties. It is imperative that commercial vessel operators understand and follow the Marine Casualty reporting requirements as outlined in Title 46, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 4 (46 CFR 4). Without timely and truthful reporting, the Coast Guard is hampered in its ability to conduct an accurate investigation. Therefore, responsible parties that fail to report Marine Casualties as required by regulations are subject to civil penalties. U.S. law, specifically Title 46, U.S. Code, Chapter 61 (Reporting Marine Casualties), Chapter 63 (Investigating Marine Casualties), and Chapter 77 (Suspension and Revocation) provide the core concepts governing the Coast Guard's responsibilities for Marine Casualties and Personnel Actions. The statutes, as written, are broad in nature and are supplemented by more extensive regulatory requirements set forth in Title 46, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 4 (Marine Casualties and Investigations) and Title 46, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 5 (Marine Investigation Regulations - Personnel Actions). The primary purpose of an investigation is to ascertain the cause or causes of an accident, casualty, or personnel behaviors to determine if remedial measures should be taken and to determine whether any violation of Federal Law or Regulation has occurred. The U.S. Coast Guard does not conduct investigations to determine Civil Liability in disputes between private litigants. Rather, our investigations are a means to promote safety of life and property at sea and to protect the Marine Environment. The Investigations Division conducts investigations for Vessel Casualties or Accidents, Violations of Statutes the U.S. Coast Guard is authorized to enforce, incidents involving vessel personnel that may lead to Suspension and Revocation (S&R;) proceedings or assessment of Civil and/or Criminal Penalties, boating accidents, Waterfront Facility Casualties and Incidents, deepwater port casualties and incidents, Marine Pollution Incidents, Accidents involving Aids to Navigation and Accidents involving structures on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS). The results of such investigations play a major role in changing current and developing new laws and regulations, as well as implementing new technologies in areas of U.S. Coast Guard concern. ==Marine Casualty or Incident reporting forms== Marine casualty or Incident Should be reported in the writing within 5days in the following form: * (CG-2692) Report of Marine Casualty, Commercial Diving Casualty, or OSC-Related Casualty * (CG-2692A) Barge Addendum * (CG-2692B) Report of Required Chemical Drug and Alcohol Testing Following a Serious Marine * (CG-2692C) Personnel Casualty Addendum * (CG-2692D) Involved Persons and Witnesses Addendum In addition, USCG Marine Investigators are tasked with investigating reports of negligence, misconduct, or other violations of federal laws or regulations that occur in conjunction with the operation of commercial vessels. If a merchant mariner is found to be in violation the USCG Marine Investigator pursues enforcement action to prevent future deficiencies and non-compliance by issuing Letters of Warning and Notices of Violations, initiating Administrative Civil Penalty hearings, initiating suspension and revocation proceedings against Coast Guard issued credentials, and representing the Coast Guard at suspension and revocation hearings. ==Marine Casualty and Pollution Data for Researchers== The Marine Casualty and Pollution Data files provide details about marine casualty and pollution incidents investigated by Coast Guard Offices throughout the United States. The database can be used to analyze marine accidents and pollution incidents by a variety of factors including vessel or facility type, injuries, fatalities, pollutant details, location, and date. The data collection period began in 1982 for marine casualties and 1973 for polluting incidents, and is ongoing. Documentation includes entity and attribute descriptions along with suggested solutions to general marine pollution, vessel casualty, and personnel injury and death questions.

Formed in 2005 by guitarist John LaRussa and bassist Brian Pittman, the band released four studio albums, three with Solid State Records and one with Red Cord Records. They disbanded in 2013. ==HistoryFormation / The Lost. The Sick. The Sacred. (2005-2007)=== The band was formed in 2005 by guitarist John LaRussa (former member of the band Narcissus) and bassist Brian Pittman (former member of the band Relient K). In 2006, they added vocalist Ryland Raus and Bobby Poole II on drums prior to the recording and release of their Solid State Records debut, The Lost. The Sick. The Sacred. They shot two videos for the album singles \\"A Call to the Faithful\\" and \\"Redemption\\", both of which appeared on Fuse's Top 20 Countdown and MTV's Headbangers Ball. The video for \\"A Call to the Faithful\\" was featured on the front page of Myspace at the time, and was one of the band's major hits with fans live and online. They were also featured in Revolver and Alternative Press. The band hit the road right out of the gate of the release of their first album, touring with many acts such as August Burns Red, The Chariot, Maylene and the Sons of Disaster, Oh Sleeper, Project 86 and more. In July 2007, the band announced through a blog on Myspace that Brian Pittman was leaving for personal reasons: \\"After a lot of thought and consideration, Brian has decided to stay home. He will always have a place in Inhale Exhale, and we love him. But too many factors at home needed his attention. He is excited to be on a permanent break from music. He loves what he has done thus far in his career, but he needed to take care of some personal business.\\" The band went through a number of drummers; Bobby Poole II was with the band for the recording of The Lost. The Sick. The Sacred. and a few of the band's early tours. He was replaced on tour by Chris \\"Tank\\" Murk of Last Tuesday throughout their summer touring of 2007. ===I Swear...

Jeremy Gifford replaced Brian Pittman on bass throughout the rest of the year, performing live and recording with the band, before leaving in 2008 and joining the band Lovedrug. A new bass player was never officially announced, but Greg Smith was eventually confirmed as bassist. On June 10, 2008 the band released their second album, I Swear... for Solid State Records with the lead single \\"It's Myself vs Being A Man\\", which was their most downloaded single, and was featured on MTV, Fuse, DirecTV, MTV2 and many other outlets.

They had an exclusive stream via Revolver for the song \\"Carpe Diem\\", along with a follow-up feature and interview in Revolver's December 2012 issue, in which the band went into some detail on the recording process, and how they went into it wanting a raw album rather than the cookie- cutter, overproduced material other bands were putting out. The band did not announced a U.S. tour to follow their Europe tour beside some festival dates. On June 2, 2013, Inhale Exhale announced on their Facebook page that they were breaking up: \\"As of right now, after touring 10+ countries, releasing four studio albums internationally, and shooting videos and singles and all that goes along with being in this band, Inhale Exhale is coming to an end.\\" They performed at the Alliance Festival on August 4, 2013 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania alongsode Demon Hunter, The Red Jumpsuit Apparatus, and others.

As result of the German reunification came the dismantling of the old conglomerate and a partial privatization of the individual enterprises. The facilities in Erfurt were partially privatized in 1992 (part owned by N.V. and Thuringia), including the X-FAB Gesellschaft zur Fertigung von Wafern mbH (manufacturing) and the Thesys Gesellschaft für Mikroelektronik mbH (design). In 1999, both enterprises were sold to the company ELEX N.V. owned by Roland Duchâtelet, a Belgian investor. In 2007, X-FAB acquired the foundry business from ZMD. Until 2009, the X-FAB group also had a manufacturing facility in Plymouth, but the wafer plant in Plymouth, United Kingdom, was sold in December 2009 to Plus Semi, the old Plessey Semiconductors plant in Swindon, England. In 2011, the X-FAB group acquired a share in MEMS Foundry Itzehoe GmbH which was a spin-off from Fraunhofer Institute for Silicon Technology (ISIT). This would become X-FAB's dedicated MEMS foundry in Itzehoe. In February 2011, the company announced that Rudi De Winter will be added to the Board of Directors as well as assume the role of co-CEO. In 2016, the X-FAB group acquired the assets of Altis Semiconductor, making the fab in France their sixth manufacturing site.

It was released on September 30, 2003, and it was produced by Warner Bros. Animation. It is the second and final film (after Scooby-Doo and the Legend of the Vampire) to briefly reunite the surviving original voice cast from the original 1969 series, with Frank Welker voicing Scooby-Doo in place of the late Don Messick. ==Plot== Fred's pen-pal, Alejo Otero, a man who lives in Veracruz, Mexico, invites Fred and the rest of the gang to visit him and his family there. Fred and the rest of the gang talk about it until they decide to go. However, after Alejo sent the invitation to Fred, a big long-haired monster started to terrorize the population of Veracruz. Alejo and his young son, Jorge, and their pet Chihuahua, Chiquita, see the monster, and the locals start calling him \\"El Chupacabra\\". Later, when Mystery, Inc. arrives in Veracruz, they meet Alejo, who recognizes them all from Fred's letters. Alejo and his family run a huge and fancy hotel, and he shows them around and where they will be staying. He then introduces to them his family, which includes his wife, Sofia, his mother, Doña Dolores, his brother Luis, and Luis's fiancée, Charlene, who is originally from the United States. Luis tells the gang he met Charlene when he visited America, at a theme park run by Mr. Smiley. The gang and the Otero family enjoy a meal, and Dolores talks about her late husband. Then, a man named Señor Fuente arrives and asks to speak with Alejo and Luis. Dolores tells the gang that Fuente has been trying to get her to sell the hotel to him ever since her husband died the previous year. Meanwhile, Alejo and Luis tell Fuente once again that they do not want to sell the hotel. Fuente leaves, and the family go inside because of a fierce storm. When inside, Alejo's forced to tell the gang about El Chupacabra. He says that he does not have many other guests besides the gang because El Chupacabra has been scaring them away. Luis and Charlene tell the gang to lock their doors when they go to sleep. During the night, Shaggy and Scooby-Doo are scared when they think they hear a noise. They then hear a loud growl and run screaming out of their cottage. After seeing footprints outside of Shaggy and Scooby's window, Fred declares that there is a mystery they have to solve. The next day, the gang and the Otero brothers set out to search for El Chupacabra. Charlene gives Luis a charm for good luck. Daphne interviews the townspeople, but none of them are able to find El Chupacabra. When they get back to the Mystery Machine, they find someone has written a threat written in Spanish on it, warning them to get out of solving the mystery. The gang realizes this is serious and decide to search at night. Fred, Velma and Daphne go one way, Alejo and Luis go another way, and Shaggy and Scooby stay at the Mystery Machine. At night, Shaggy and Scooby sleep in the van, while someone drains their brake fluid. Fred, Velma and Daphne search the woods, and find El Curandero, a medicine man. El Curandero tells them they need to look at history and that they are in grave danger. Meanwhile, Alejo and Luis are searching when Alejo sees El Chupacabra. Alejo is chased and nearly falls off a cliff. He calls for Luis, but there is no answer. El Chupacabra disappears, and Luis shows up, saying he was knocked on the head by El Chupacabra. Luis helps his brother up from the cliff. Shaggy and Scooby start driving, but then realize they cannot stop due to the brake fluid tank being tampered with. They meet up with Fred, Velma, Daphne, Alejo and Luis, who were being chased by El Chupacabra. Eventually, the van runs out of gas and stops right in front of a gas station. The Mystery Machine gets fixed, and Daphne gets some ice for Luis's head wound, but Luis does not have a bump on his head. The gang drives along and finds a sign to a history museum, and thinking that is what the medicine man said, go to it. When they get there, they meet a suspicious and hyper museum guide who leads them into an auditorium. There they see a performance about ancient Mexican customs. The guide then makes Daphne volunteer, and she kidnaps her. The rest of the gang find a secret passageway and follow it, until they come to Aztec pyramids. They find Daphne at the top of one and rescue her, but the tourists chase after them, after they are accused of destroying a statue. After a long chase scene and fights against giant living statues, they finally return to Veracruz. The next day is the Day of the Dead, and all go to the cemetery, where Dolores informs them that Charlene has been captured by El Chupacabra. The family gives offerings to the grave of Señor Otero and hope Charlene can be found. Suddenly, the ghost of Señor Otero comes out of his grave and tells them to sell the hotel and the land or they will be in danger. At the same time, Fred just revealed the good luck charm Luis has is really a tracking device instead of an ancient medallion. The family cannot believe that Señor Otero would want them to sell. Scooby and Chiquita follows a beeping noise that is activated by pushing the button from the tracking device until they find a man in a skeleton suit controlling the ghost. The gang catches him, and he is revealed to be Mr. Smiley. They deduce that he started the Chupacabra scheme so he could force the locals to sell their land and allow him to build his theme park. Him kidnapping Daphne and framing the gang as vandals was his way of creating bad publicity for the pyramids, his sole competitor for the thousands of tourist dollars. As they are about to close the mystery, El Chupacabra appears and scares everyone. After chasing the gang, El Chupacabra is caught up in some wiring. As they all gather around El Chupacabra, the culprit is revealed to be the museum guide when she climbs out of the suit. She tells them she loves Mr. Smiley and that they were going to get all the land. Luis asks what happened to Charlene, and the guide tells him he will never see her again and he should forget about her. Suddenly, the Oteros reveal that the offerings they left for Señor Otero have disappeared, all except for the one from Charlene. Velma then guesses something is up and realizes the guide is wearing a wig and glasses to hide their identity, and pulls it off to reveal that Charlene was the guide and El Chupacabra. Her true identity is given away by the random tossing of coffee beans; a trait Charlene adopts from working in the hotel cafe all day. Fred says that the message written on the Mystery Machine (\\"Sal ahora o no veras el dia de manana!\\" - Leave today or you won't see tomorrow!) was not written in proper Spanish (as the word \\"manana\\" should have been \\"mañana\\"), so whoever made the threat had to have been someone who could not understand the language. Señor Fuente then comes in and says that even though he wanted to buy the Otero family's land, he eventually came to respect the fact that they did not want to sell it. Fuente explains that he learned of Mr. Smiley and Charlene's plans and wanted to warn the Oteros and Mystery Inc. of what was really going on. Luis admits that the real reason he did not come to Alejo's rescue because he was paralyzed with fear — after their father died the previous year, Luis was afraid of losing Alejo, so he lied by saying that El Chupacabra had knocked him unconscious. Alejo comforts Luis and assures him that there are worse things than being a coward, to which Shaggy adds how he has \\"made a career out of it.\\" In the end, everybody enjoys the Day of the Dead festivities. ==Cast== * Frank Welker as Scooby-Doo, Fred Jones, El Chupacabra * Casey Kasem as Shaggy Rogers * Heather North as Daphne Blake * Nicole Jaffe as Velma Dinkley * Eddie Santiago as Alejo Otero * Jesse Borrego as Luis Otero * Candi Milo as Charlene/Museum Guide * Rita Moreno as Doña Dolores * Maria Canals as Sofia Otero / Old Woman * Brandon Gonzalez as Jorge Otero * Rip Taylor as Mr. Smiley / Ghost of Señor Otero * Cástulo Guerra as Señor Fuente * Benito Martinez as El Curandero ==ReferencesCategory:2003 direct-to- video films Category:2000s American animated films Category:American mystery films Category:American films Category:Scooby-Doo direct-to-video animated films Category:Films set in Mexico Category:Films about cryptids Category:Day of the Dead films Category:Warner Bros.

The son of Samuel and Mary Hanson (née Choppin), Reginald was educated at Tonbridge School, Rugby School and Trinity College, Cambridge (MA, LLD). The then headmaster of Rugby School Dr Frederick Temple (later Archbishop of Canterbury) said of Hanson on his departure, \\"I have a most sincere and warm regard for him. The manly desire he shows to get rid of his faults, and to do his duty, will always deserve the respect of all who know him. There are a few from who I part with so much regret at my own loss\\". Indeed, this sense of duty was upheld and he held numerous positions of public office. Following graduation, the young Reginald joined the Commercial Union Assurance Company (now part of Aviva plc) which was previously co- founded by his father Samuel. Within a year he was appointed to the Board of directors where he remained until 1882. By this time, he had already joined the family wholesale grocery business, Samuel Hanson & Son Limited. He held a number of civic posts notably as an Alderman of Billingsgate (London) from 1880 and Sheriff of London and Middlesex, 1881–82. From 1882-85 Hanson was a member of the London School Board. In 1886, he was elected Lord Mayor of London, during which time Queen Victoria celebrated her Jubilee year. In 1887, Sir Reginald entertained Her Majesty at the Mansion House where he was created a Baronet by her, having previously been knighted. Guests that day included the explorer Henry Morton Stanley and Judge Thomas Hughes author of Tom Brown's Schooldays. Conservative Member of Parliament for the City of London from 1891 to 1900, Hanson was also an Honorary Colonel of the 6th Battalion, Royal Fusiliers (City of London Regiment). He died in 1905 and is buried in Highgate Cemetery, leaving behind two sons, Gerald (Sir Gerald Stanhope Hanson, 2nd Baronet), Francis (Sir Francis Stanhope Hanson - Knight Bachelor) and two daughters, Violet and Maud. ==References== * == External links == * - Category:1840 births Category:1905 deaths Category:People educated at Tonbridge School Category:People educated at Rugby School Category:Alumni of Trinity College, Cambridge Category:Sheriffs of the City of London Category:19th-century lord mayors of London Category:19th-century British politicians Category:19th-century English politicians Category:20th-century British politicians Category:20th-century English politicians Category:Conservative Party (UK) MPs for English constituencies Category:Members of Parliament of the United Kingdom for the City of London Category:Baronets in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom Category:Knights Bachelor Category:Members of London County Council Category:UK MPs 1886–1892 Category:UK MPs 1892–1895 Category:UK MPs 1895–1900 Category:Members of the London School Board ","title":"Reginald Hanson"},{"id":"6205098","text":"Bow wow is onomatopoeia for a dog's bark.

Maritime security is one of the three basic roles of the United States Coast Guard has gradually developed in response to a series of catastrophic events, which began in 1917. There are three main maritime security activities conducted by the Coast Guard: * Port Security. * Vessel Security. * Facility Security. ==Legal Background== The principle laws that support this mission of the United States Coast Guard are: *Espionage Act of 1917 - This act empowered the Coast Guard to make regulations to prevent damage to harbors and vessels during national security emergencies. *Magnuson Act, 1950 - Enacted as a result of the \\"Red Scare,\\" this act provided permanent port security regulations, and broad powers to search vessels in U.S. waters and control the movement of foreign vessels in U.S. ports. *Ports and Waterways Safety Act, 1972 – Resulting from several major groundings and oil spills, this act provided port safety authority beyond the Magnuson Act to protect the use of port transportation facilities, and to enhance efforts against the degradation of the marine environment. *Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002 or MTSA – Enacted as a result of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the United States. This Act provided sweeping new authorities for preventing acts of terrorism within the U.S. maritime domain. *The International Ship and Port Facility Security (ISPS) Code, 2002 – Adopted by the International Maritime Organization as new provisions to the International Convention for SOLAS to enhance maritime . ==Port Security== The Port Security requirements found in the MTSA requires security measures for U.S. ports in order to reduce the risks and to mitigate the results of an act that threatens the security of personnel, facilities, vessels, and the public. The regulations draw together assets within port boundaries to provide a framework to communicate, identify risks, and coordinate resources to mitigate threats and consequences. The COTP must ensure that the total port security posture is accurately assessed, and that security resources are appropriate to meet these programs. The COTP must identify critical assets within a port, develop a prioritized list of those most susceptible to acts of sabotage, and plan for adequate security measures to meet specific needs. ==Vessel Security== Both MTSA and the ISPS Code regulate vessel security. The regulations within these two documents require the owners or operators of vessels to designate security officers for vessels, develop security plans based on security assessments, implement security measures specific to the vessel’s operation, and comply with current Marine Security levels. ==Facility Security== A facility is defined as: any structure or facility of any kind located in, on, under, or adjacent to any waters subject to the jurisdiction of the U.S. and used, operated, or maintained by a public or private entity, including any contiguous or adjoining property under common ownership or operation. Some examples of facilities are: * Barge fleeting facilities. * Container terminals. * Oil storage facilities. * Passenger vessel terminals. Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) Facilities are generally offshore fixed platforms in water depths ranging up to 1,000 feet deep whose primary purpose is the exploration, development, and/or product of offshore petroleum reserves. This definition also includes novel floating design such as: * Tension Leg Platforms (TLP). * Floating Production Facilities (converted MODUs). * Floating Production Storage Offloading units (FPSO). Both MTSA and the ISPS Code regulate facility security. The regulations within these two documents require the owners or operators of facilities to designate security officers for facilities, develop security plans based on security assessments, implement security measures specific to the facility’s operation, and comply with current Marine Security levels. Those facilities designated as Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) facilities must meet the same security requirements as those designated as waterfront facilities. When US Navy merchant vessels are in dangerous waters, security detachments are posted on the vessel. Security forces have helped deter piracy as well as terrorist attacks, such as the Maersk Alabama and the USS Cole. US Navy merchant vessels normally train the deck department in firearms training, but the added Navy security detail provides for extra security. Additionally, Navy escorts might sometimes accompany the vessels, such as traveling through the Straights of Gibraltar. ==See also== * Maritime Safety and Security Team * Port Safety mission covers accidental damage rather than intentional damage. * Port Security Unit ==References *A Cooperative Strategy for 21st Century Seapower *The Naval Institute On Maritime Security *Maritime Security Specialists for the Gulf of Aden and Indian Ocean *Port and Maritime Security Online *PMSO.net Maritime Security Knowledgebase *Maritime Security Research Center *Maritime Piracy: Implications for Maritime Energy Security Category:United States Coast Guard Category:Nautical terminology ","title":"Maritime security (USCG)"},{"id":"6205146","text":"State Route 587, also known as SR 587, is a state highway in south-central Arizona that travels from its junction with State Route 87 just south of Sun Lakes directly south to Interstate 10 in Bapchule.

He most recently was the head coach at Georgia Tech, a position he held from 2008 until his retirement in 2018. Prior to Georgia Tech, Johnson served as the head coach at Georgia Southern University from 1997 to 2001 and at the United States Naval Academy from 2002 to 2007. Johnson's Georgia Southern Eagles won consecutive NCAA Division I-AA Football Championships in 1999 and 2000. He is noted for his use of the flexbone spread option offense. ==Early life and education== Johnson earned his bachelor of science degree in physical education from Western Carolina University in 1979, where he was a member of the Kappa Alpha Order. He did not play college football. He also earned a master of science in health and physical education from Appalachian State University in 1982. == Coaching career == Johnson started his college career at Georgia Southern University in 1983, where he served as offensive coordinator for consecutive NCAA Division I-AA National Football Championships teams in 1985 and 1986. From 1983–1986 they would win 40 games and score 619 points in 15 games in 1986. Those teams were led by QB Tracy Ham who would go on to be a successful QB in the Canadian Football League. He then spent eight seasons as offensive coordinator at the University of Hawaii at Manoa from 1987 to 1994. Their offense averaged 372 points scored per season during his 8 years there and won 54 games. While at Hawaii he would coach future collegiate head coach Ken Niumatalolo. In 1992 they would finish with their best record in school history at 11–2, including a win in the Holiday Bowl over the University of Illinois. They would also win the Western Athletic Conference title that season. In 1995 and 1996, he served as the offensive coordinator at the United States Naval Academy and brought his option offense with him. In 1996, Navy recorded its first winning season in 14 years, going 9–3 with a victory in the Aloha Bowl. Their 9–3 record was the best since 1978 and their 392 points scored were the most in school history up to that point. Johnson began his head coaching career by returning to Georgia Southern, which he led from 1997 through 2001. During his tenure, the Eagles captured the Division I-AA National Championship twice more in 1999 and 2000, and finished as runner-up in 1998. During his tenure as head coach, they finished with a record of 62–10 (86.1% winning rate). Johnson is one of only four coaches to record 50 wins in his first four seasons as head coach at the Division I level. === Navy (2002–2007) === Johnson at a Navy game against the Duke Blue Devils in 2004. In 2002, Johnson departed Georgia Southern and returned to Navy as head coach. Johnson's initial season saw the Midshipmen win only two of 12 games, though the season ended on a high note with his first victory over Army, which would not beat Navy again until 2016. Subsequently, Johnson's teams enjoyed a high degree of success. The 2003 team completed the regular season with an 8–4 mark, including wins over both Air Force and Army, and earned a berth in the Houston Bowl, Navy's first bowl game since 1996. However, the Midshipmen lost to Texas Tech, 38–14. In 2004, Johnson's team posted the program's best record since 1957, finishing the regular season at 9–2 and once again earning a bowl berth, this time in the Emerald Bowl. There Johnson coached the Midshipmen to a win over New Mexico, 34–19, the fifth bowl win in the school's history. The win gave Navy 10 wins on the season, tying a school record that had stood since 1905. For his efforts, Johnson received the Bobby Dodd Coach of the Year Award. The 2005 Navy squad recorded a mark of 8–4, highlighted by victories over Army, Air Force, and Colorado State in the inaugural Poinsettia Bowl. In 2007, Johnson coached the Midshipmen to their first win over rival Notre Dame since 1963, winning 46–44 in triple-overtime. Johnson dominated the Commander-in-Chief's Trophy competition, going 11–1 (.917) in his six years, with the only loss against another service academy coming at the hands of Air Force in his first season. He was the first coach in Navy's history to go 6–0 in his first six seasons against Army (Ken Niumatalolo, who followed Johnson at Navy, went 8–0 against Army in his first eight seasons), and his 2006 senior class was the first in Navy history to win the Commander-in-Chief's Trophy all four of their years. Much of Johnson's success was predicated on his triple option flexbone offense, a run-oriented attack that led NCAA Division I-A/FBS football in rushing yards three of his last four years at Navy. Some have criticized the triple option as gimmick offense unfit for major college football, which may have explained the reluctance of some top programs to offer him a position despite his accomplishments at both Georgia Southern and Navy. Johnson rebutted this argument in numerous press conferences and interviews, asserting that several top teams, including 2005 national champion Texas and 2006 national champion Florida, used various forms of the option. In 2008, Johnson told ESPN's Mark Schlabach, \\"If we can run it against Boston College at Navy, why can't we run it against Boston College at Georgia Tech? If we can beat Pitt with this system at Navy, why can't we beat Pitt at Georgia Tech? Are we going to get worse players at Georgia Tech?\\" In 2007, he led Navy to beat Notre Dame for the first time since 1963. Navy won in triple overtime, 46-44, ending a 43-game losing streak against Notre Dame. === Georgia Tech (2008–2018) === On December 7, 2007, Johnson accepted the head coaching job at the Georgia Institute of Technology. Johnson, who came to Georgia Tech in December after a six-year tenure at Navy, inherited a young roster with reduced numbers because of an NCAA probation. Only 76 players were on scholarship, below the maximum of 85, including three senior walk-ons who were awarded scholarships prior to the start of the season. The roster included 75 freshmen and sophomores; 16 of 22 starters were underclassmen. Sports Illustrated predicted Johnson's first Yellow Jacket team would win three games and finish fourth in the Atlantic Coast Conference's Coastal Division. In 2008, Johnson led the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets to a 9–4 record. Georgia Tech was 6–1 at home in games played at Bobby Dodd Stadium and 4–2 against ranked opponents, including three wins in November against Florida State, Miami, and Georgia. Georgia Tech, ranked 14th in the BCS standings and 15th in the AP Poll, finished the regular season with a 9–3 record. Though they tied for first place in their division with a 5–3 conference record, the Yellow Jackets failed to advance to the ACC Championship Game by virtue of an early-season loss to eventual ACC champion, Virginia Tech. Georgia Tech accepted a bid to the Chick-Fil-A Bowl, where they were defeated by LSU, 38–3. Johnson's 2008 Georgia Tech team featured one first-team All-American (Michael Johnson), the ACC Player of the Year (Jonathan Dwyer), and eight first team, second team, and honorable mention All-ACC selections. On December 2, 2008, Johnson was tabbed as ACC Coach of the Year by the Atlantic Coast Sports Media Association (ACSMA). He said, \\"This is an honor for the football program at Georgia Tech, the coaching staff and the players. There are a lot of great coaches in the ACC, so it's humbling to win such a prestigious honor.\\" Johnson was also named 2008 National Coach of the year by CBSSports.com on the same day. In 2009, Johnson led the Yellow Jackets to an 11–3 record, including the school's first win at Florida State in school history, and a victory over #4 Virginia Tech in Atlanta, which broke a 17-game home losing streak to top five opponents, and the program's first win over Virginia in Charlottesville since 1990. After a defeat at the hands of Miami in the third week of the season, Georgia Tech won its next eight games, rising as high as #7 in the AP Poll, before losing to unranked rival Georgia in Atlanta to end the regular season. Georgia Tech finished a league- best 7–1 in ACC play and defeated Clemson in the ACC Championship Game for the school's first outright conference championship since 1990. This current title has been vacated by the NCAA for rules violations, which stemmed from what the NCAA described as an isolated instance of former standout wide receiver Demaryius Thomas allegedly receiving $312 in impermissible gifts, and grew to Morgan Burnett allegedly taking gifts and misleading NCAA investigators. Both players denied these allegations and Georgia Tech filed an appeal, which was denied. Following the end of the regular season, Johnson received ACC Coach of the Year honors for the second consecutive year, becoming the only Georgia Tech head coach in history to win the award in his first two seasons. The Yellow Jackets were paired in the Orange Bowl with the 10th ranked Iowa Hawkeyes. Iowa beat Georgia Tech 24–14, sending Johnson to 0–2 in bowls at Georgia Tech. In 2010, Georgia Tech started the season ranked 16th in the AP Poll. However, the team suffered a number of high-profile injuries, including to starting quarterback Joshua Nesbitt. The team finished the regular season 6–6 and lost in the Independence Bowl to Air Force 14–7. In 2011, Johnson led the team to its first 6–0 start since 1990 and set a number of school offensive records in the team's 66–24 blowout of Kansas. Johnson proceeded to lose two consecutive games to Virginia and Miami before defeating then #5 Clemson 31–17. The team finished the regular season with an 8–4 record, and then lost to Utah in the Sun Bowl on December 31, 2011. In 2012, Johnson's Yellow Jackets got off to a slow start at 3–5, when then Defensive Coordinator Al Groh was terminated by Johnson. With Charles Kelly coaching the defense thereafter, Georgia Tech won its next three games, and clinched a spot in the 2012 Dr. Pepper ACC Championship game in Charlotte, N.C. Though the Jackets were defeated by Florida State 21–15, the Tech Defense shut out the Seminoles in the second half. GT capped off the season with a 21–7 win over the preseason #1 team in the country, Southern California, in the Hyundai Sun Bowl in El Paso, Texas. In 2013, Georgia Tech led Georgia 20–0 in the 2nd quarter and 27–17 in the 4th quarter before losing 41–34 in double overtime. The Jackets finished the year 7–6 after a 23–17 loss to Ole Miss in the Music City Bowl. In 2014, Johnson led Georgia Tech to their fourth Coastal Division title during his tenure and a spot in the 2014 ACC Championship Game. Johnson and the Jackets were predicted to finish 6th in the Coastal division by ESPN in the preseason, but again went beyond expectations and achieved a 10-win regular season, 1st place in the Coastal Division, and a 10th-place ranking in AP Poll. The Yellow Jackets fell two points short in the ACC title game to the defending national champions, Florida State, but were still selected for their second Orange Bowl berth in six seasons. The season saw the Jackets beat its key rivals Virginia Tech, Miami, Clemson and Georgia. On December 31, 2014, Paul Johnson led the Yellow Jackets to a big win in the CFP \\"Big 6\\" Orange Bowl. This was the second Orange Bowl Paul Johnson's jackets earned a bid to play. The other came against #11 Iowa on January 5, 2010. The #12 ranked Yellow Jackets dominated the game in the second half and finished their season with a 49–34 win over the #7 ranked Mississippi State Bulldogs. 2015- Georgia Tech had its first losing season under Paul Johnson's tenure, going 3–9 that year. However, the Yellow Jackets did beat #5 Florida State at Bobby Dodd Stadium, with the infamous \\"Miracle on Techwood Drive\\". It became one of the best games in Georgia Tech Football history. 2016- Johnson led Georgia Tech to a bounce-back 9–4 season. After starting 3-3, Georgia Tech won six out of its last 7, including wins against nationally ranked Virginia Tech and Georgia. They would eventually beat Kentucky in the TaxSlayer Bowl 33–18, and finished #26 in the AP Poll. 2017- Georgia Tech has yet another disappointing season under Johnson, going 5-6. It marks the second time the Jackets have missed out on a bowl game. Georgia Tech lost five out of six games by a touchdown or less. 2018- Georgia Tech finished the regular season 7-5 with wins over ACC foes Miami and Virginia Tech. Tech also finished 2nd in the ACC Coastal division, marking the 7th time his teams have finished in 1st or 2nd place. Johnson announced his retirement on November 28, 2018, effective following the team's bowl game against the University of Minnesota. ==Coaching tree== Notable assistants under Johnson who have become NCAA or NFL head coaches: * Mike Sewak: Georgia Southern (2002–2005) * Ken Niumatalolo: Navy (2007–present) * Jeff Monken: Georgia Southern (2010–2013), Army (2014–present) ==Personal life== Johnson met his wife, Susan (Propst), when both were students at Western Carolina University, and they married in 1980.

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the New York Yankees, Kansas City Athletics, and Milwaukee Braves. ==Career== Blanchard, circa 1959 Born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, Blanchard attended DeLaSalle High School before transferring to Central High School, where he played football and basketball in addition to baseball. He played semi-professional baseball in Iowa before being signed by the New York Yankees to a professional contract. After three seasons of playing in the minor leagues, and a two-year period in which he served in the U.S. Army, Blanchard played briefly for the Yankees in 1955. It took Blanchard four years to return to the major leagues, but he gained playing time in 1960 due to injuries to the Yankees' top two catchers. Sportswriter Bill Madden called Blanchard \\"probably the most famous third-string catcher in baseball history.\\" Blanchard remained with the Yankees through 1965, mainly serving as a backup catcher, and played 93 games during the team's World Series-winning 1961 season, hitting 21 home runs. Among those were four home runs in consecutive at-bats (twice as a pinch hitter) during a three-game span, a total that set a major league record. Blanchard was quoted as saying, \\"Who am I to hit five?\\" A defensive liability for the Yankees for most of his career, Blanchard is probably best known for his play in the 1961 World Series. He hit two home runs in that series against the Cincinnati Reds and batted .400 for the entire series.Career statistics and history at Baseball-Reference.com In his career, Blanchard appeared in the World Series five times for the Yankees and holds the major league record with ten World Series pinch-hit at-bats. Blanchard was the catcher who called the pitch that Bill Mazeroski hit for the first-ever series-ending home run, which was hit off Ralph Terry in the 1960 World Series in which the Pittsburgh Pirates defeated the heavily favored Yankees. Blanchard was traded to the Kansas City Athletics in 1965, as part of a three- player transaction. He remained with the team until September 1965, when his contract was sold to the Milwaukee Braves. After 10 games with the Braves in 1965, Blanchard did not play baseball in 1966; a comeback attempt in 1968 was unsuccessful. For his major league career, he played in 516 games, posting a .239 batting average, hitting 67 home runs, and driving in 200 runs. Blanchard was successful in the postseason. In 15 World Series games spanning from 1960 through 1964, he posted a .345 batting average (10-for-29) with 6 runs, 4 doubles, 2 home runs, 5 RBI and 2 bases on balls. == Broadcasting Career == He was the color commentator for the first live ESPN game ever broadcast. It took place at Joecks Field in Lannon, Wisconsin on September 7, 1979. It was Game 1 of the American Professional Slowpitch Softball League World Series, a best- of-nine endeavor, between the Milwaukee Schlitz and Kentucky Bourbons. ==Death== Blanchard died of a heart attack in North Memorial Medical Center in Robbinsdale, Minnesota on March 25, 2009.\\"Johnny Blanchard, who played with Yankees, dies of heart attack\\" , Tim Harlow, Minneapolis Star Tribune, March 25, 2009 His funeral was held at The Church of St. Mary of the Lake in Plymouth, Minnesota on Monday March 30, 2009 at 11:00AM and was buried at Fort Snelling National Cemetery. ==References * Category:1933 births Category:2009 deaths Category:Kansas City Athletics players Category:Milwaukee Braves players Category:New York Yankees players Category:Major League Baseball catchers Category:Baseball players from Minnesota Category:Major League Baseball right fielders Category:Sportspeople from Minneapolis Category:Amsterdam Rugmakers players Category:Binghamton Triplets players Category:Kansas City Blues (baseball) players Category:Joplin Miners players Category:Denver Bears players Category:Birmingham Barons players Category:Burials in Minnesota ","title":"Johnny Blanchard"},{"id":"6205200","text":"Flüelen is a municipality in the canton of Uri in Switzerland. ==History== Flüelen harbor with light boats from the Lake Lucerne trade routes unloading, 1817 Aerial view from 300 m by Walter Mittelholzer (1922) Flüelen is first mentioned in 1266 as Vluolon.

The name can be translated from the Arabic into English as \\"Lagoon of the Land of Palms\\". ==Geography== The bottom of Chott el Djerid is located between 10 and 25 meters (about 30 to 80 feet) below sea level. The lake's width varies widely; at its narrowest point, it is only across, compared to its overall length of . At times, parts of it appear in various shades of white, green and purple. The narrow eastward inlet of the chott is also known as Chott el Fejej. It is the largest salt pan of the Sahara Desert, with a surface area of over 7,000 km2 (some sources state 5,000 km2). The site has a typical hot desert climate. Due to the harsh climate with mean annual rainfall of below 100 mm and daytime temperatures sometimes reaching 50 °C (122 °F) or more during summer with dense solar radiation, water evaporates from the lake. In summer Chott el Djerid is almost entirely dried up, and numerous fata morganas occur. Situated at 33 ° 42'N 8 ° 26'E in the center-west of the country, between the cities of Tozeur and Kebili. During winter, a small tributary of water can be seen discharging into the lake. Because the flooded area is very variable, values presented for the area of the lake (or its basin, which is almost always dry), can vary widely. Some sources provide values as high as 10,000 km². Similarly, figures given for altitude vary between 10 meters above and 25 meters below sea level. Currently, freshwater irrigation schemes are being applied in the region to help eliminate salt from soils and increase the productive area. ==Surrounding area== South of Chott el Djerid, the Grand Erg Oriental desert begins. The towns of Kebili and Douz are also located south of the lake. ==Access== The lake can be crossed by foot and even by car, but this is very dangerous since the salt crust is not always firm. During winter, when the lake is full, it can be crossed by boat. Piles of salt at its edges are collected for salt production processing. ==Fauna== Relict populations of the West African crocodile persisted in the Chott el Djerid until the early 20th century.\\"Crocodiles in the Sahara Desert: An Update of Distribution, Habitats and Population Status for Conservation Planning in Mauritania\\". PLOS ONE. February 25, 2011. Pink flamingos have been known to use the shores of the lake as nesting sites in springtime. ==Namesakes== Chott el Djerid is the namesake of the Jerid Lacuna an Endorheic hydrocarbon lake on the Saturnian moon Titan. That lake is located 66.7°N and 221°W on Titan's globe and involves liquid methane and ethane, instead of water. ==In popular culture== Star Wars in Chott el Djerid. Chott el Djerid was used as a filming location for the Star Wars series, among others. It was also described in Jules Verne's last novel, Invasion of the Sea. According to legend, it was there that the Greek goddess Athena was born.Herodotus iv,180. Cf. Lake Tritonis.

The game was published by Acclaim Entertainment and released for mobile phones, GameCube, Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 2 and Xbox, between August 2003 and March 2004. == Gameplay == Urban Freestyle Soccer is rather simple to play, as most sport-typed video games are. The player navigates his teammates via keyboard or controller/joypad, passing the ball, dribbling the opponents, and even playing dirty here and there. The player can clash at opposing teammates, knocking them down with kicks and punches, and can also use the objects from the environment of the playing field to throw at the opponents (like trash cans). The game itself offers a number of types of games to play, from classical Freestyle matches up to the rather longer Street Challenge mode. The Turf Wars mode offers a player to pick a team (if you are playing for the first time, you'll be able to choose between the Skater Boys, Hardcore Honeys, Shakedown or Tagging Crew), and begin a Turf War, challenging other teams into playing on their home pitches. Each team has a specific, personally themed playing area (from obvious things like a skate park to warehouses, highschool pitches etc.). After each game is finished, depending on the outcome of it, the player obtains a certain number of skill points, which they can use the improve the statistics of their own team. The campaign here is partially linear, giving the player options on which location/turf they will attack by using a map of the city. After defeating all of the \\"rival gangs\\" the Home Turf mode will become active. In this mode, the player is tasked with exactly the opposite of the Turf Wars mode. Here, the opposing teams keep attacking your own turf, and you are tasked to defend it by winning matches on it (your home turf). However, if you lose at any point during the Home Turf mode, you will have to start over from scratch again, unlike the Turf Wars mode where a defeat would just push you back from the turf of the opponent that defeated you. Once the Home Turf is completed, the final Street Challenge mode is unlocked, where a player plays through a league, combining points via scored goals, numbers of victories etc. The VS Mode and Freestyle are simple, one-on- one matches. == Reception == The GameCube, PlayStation 2 and Xbox versions received \\"generally unfavourable reviews\\" according to the review aggregation website Metacritic.

The game includes officially licensed vehicles and weapons systems from major defense contractors including Boeing, Lockheed Martin, General Dynamics, Northrop Grumman and Sikorsky. Joint Task Force was developed by Hungarian studio Most Wanted Entertainment and was co-published by HD Publishing and Sierra Entertainment in September 2006. ==Setting== Joint Task Force is set in 2008. In the single-player campaign, players follow the JTF first battalion and its commander, Major Matthew O’Connell, in a fight for order and stability in missions based on actual combat situations. The single player campaign consists of 5 scenarios set in Somalia, Bosnia, Afghanistan, Colombia and Iraq. == Plot == The story begins in war-wracked Somalia, where the most powerful warlord in the country, Akil Farrah, has managed to overthrow the ruling government and proclaims himself President. He establishes a dictatorship, targeting ethnic minorities. The game itself opens in a destroyed town, where Farrah's troops are shooting at fleeing civilians. Farrah arrives on top a tank to watch one of his men execute a captured man, possibly a prisoner. Unbeknownst to them, the act is videotaped by a reporter in hiding, and the tape is shown to Major O'Connell during a briefing. His superior, General Cleveland, informs him that he and the JTF First Battalion will be sent to Somalia to remove Farrah's regime, and grants him the jurisdiction to do whatever it takes to succeed. Cleveland reminds him that this is the first JTF operation, and that no mistakes are allowed. During the briefing Cleveland informs O'Connell that he is aware of 'certain missions' he had accomplished there before. Later, while O'Connell is being flown in to his first mission with the JTF, a monologue reveals that O'Connell had previously fought for Farrah as part of a black ops operation supported by the US government, aimed at reinstating the Resources For Aid program. O'Connell is remorseful of what he did there, and is determined to make up for it by removing Farrah's brutal regime. In the first mission in the game, O'Connell successfully secures a cargo ship suspected to be used as an arms transport at Port Mogadishu. However, he discovers that whatever cargo the ship had been holding had been removed, only finding a laptop and documents. During later missions in Somalia, General Cleveland informs O'Connell that Intel was able to find little information from the laptop, save email exchange over a 'Product 7' being shipped out. Later, the JTF captures a convoy which had been transporting the materials brought in by the cargo ship during the first mission. O'Connell informs Cleveland that the convoy was carrying HXE explosives, a state of the art explosive more powerful than C4. Unfortunately, not all of the cargo was present in the convoy. In Mogadishu itself, the JTF is able to capture Farrah's arms minister Mahmoud Abbas, who reveals the location of Farrah himself. During the same mission, one of O'Connell's troops is shot dead when attempting to evacuate a reporter who refuses to leave. Cleveland informs O'Connell that the reporter in question is Pepper Morgan, a world-renowned war-correspondent who has connections to all of the major TV Networks. The JTF is able to infiltrate Farrah's position close to the Kenyan border, but halfway through the mission Cleveland informs O'Connell that instead of capturing Farrah as originally planned, he is now ordered to kill Farrah. An upset O'Connell protests, saying that 'I joined the JTF to leave that kind of work behind', but is only ends up being rebuked by Cleveland. The mission is a success, with Farrah being killed when his tank is destroyed. Back at base, where the JTF troops are celebrating, O'Connell sits alone in a dark locker room, where he remembers having fought in a battle in Somalia in the 1990s with another man. Running low on ammo, O'Connell is ordered by the unknown man to booby-trap a prisoner with a grenade, before both of them flee. After Somalia, the JTF is called to Bosnia after a rogue Serbian General, Arkan Dragović, launched a military offensive into Bosnia to allegedly destroy terrorist camps operated by an organization called 'The Matar' (who, as General Cleveland states, has made \\"Al Qaeda look like the YMCA). At some point after the first mission in Bosnia, Dragović's fighter-bombers rupture the Kraduvice Dam, flooding many villages & forests. The JTF captures Kraduvice and close the border, stopping any more hostile reinforcements entering Bosnia. During this time, he comes into contact with Captain Pickett, a tank commander whose forces are incorporated in the JTF. The JTF is free to move into Serbia to apprehend General Dragović in the town of Krasnaja in Serbia; this time, the target is caught alive, which pleases O'Connell. A Russian arms dealer named Novikov who was involved with the Matar is captured from an oil rig that was about to be destroyed by the Matar using timed explosives. Following this, using intel from Novikov, the JTF is reassigned to Afghanistan to capture a Matar accomplice, a clan leader to be interrogated, only to find that the clan leader was killed during a prison riot at Qala-i- Jangi Prison which the JTF was supposed to contain. After the riot, O'Connell's men are told to capture the original clan leader's brother, who is later found to have died from lead poisoning. After questioning a captured Russian pilot, who said he had flown in some cargo that brought cheers from the Taliban at the airport. The JTF investigates a Taliban cave complex, which leads to an old Soviet ICBM missile silo, where the JTF finds an ex-CIA agent, named Courtland, who has a reputation for interrogating and then executing prisoners, for acting as a lone wolf, and is revealed to have been the mysterious man from O'Connell's flashback. After securing the facility, Courtland escapes with the nuke, leaving the JTF in utter confusion as to what to do next. ==Gameplay== The gameplay in Joint Task Force is focused around tactical decision making. Instead of resource collection, players get money to spend per mission and per objective. Troopers and equipment are assigned at the beginning of each mission, and more may be ordered by helicopter and trooper transport. Heavily armoured vehicles such as the M1A2 Abrams tank and the M2A3 IFV are airdropped in by a Hercules transport plane onto a captured runway. Therefore, if a player wants the upper hand in a mission, he must capture and control the runway for armoured support. Troopers also gain experience and can be promoted to officer status. Officers have a skill tree that can be improved over time, similar to popular role-playing games. These officers will then give you a massive advantage on the battlefield depending on their speciality. For instance, a vehicle crewman gets a lot of experience from a mission, and is eligible for promotion, this now makes him an officer and is most combat effective when in a vehicle. The singleplayer campaign can be played cooperatively with another player. The game also features a 'Skirmish' mode where the player can choose one of three factions: JTF, Terrorists or Dictators. ==Reviews== *GameSpot: 6.5 (Fair) http://www.gamespot.com/pc/strategy/jointtaskforce/index.html?tag=result;title;0 *GameSpy: 2.5/5 http://pc.gamespy.com/pc/joint-task-force/736898p1.html *IGN: 5.7 http://pc.ign.com/articles/738/738427p1.html ==See also== *Sierra Entertainment *List of strategy video games *Real-time tactics *Windows 2000 (Minimum suggested system requirement.) ==References External links == *Official Joint Task Force Website The official game website maintained by HD Publishing. *Sierra Entertainment The official website of publisher Sierra Entertainment.

Among the exhibits outside the building are more than ten steam engines, including the oldest steam engine preserved in the country (a class P 3/3 z, built in England in 1868, and various railroad carriages, including the personal carriages of the Kings Ferdinand of Bulgaria and Boris III of Bulgaria, as well as the carriage of the Turkish sultan of 1866. the museum is underfunded, the heritage engines and railcars are stored in the open air without almost any maintenance, and the humid air from the nearby Danube accelerates significantly their decay. The museum was named the National Museum of Railway Transport and Communications on 26 June 1996, commemorating the 100th anniversary of railroads in Bulgaria, and the building was declared a historical landmark. The museum's exhibits have been used in the films Capitan Petko Voivoda (), Records of Bulgarian Uprisings (), and the Russian-Bulgarian production Turkish Gambit. == The old railway station == The construction of the old Rousse Railway Station was commenced in 1863 and completed three years later. The station is situated in the (then) outskirts of Rousse, near the high bank of the Danube, opposite to Giurgiu. It is not functioning now. Building the railway station was the beginning of a larger project – the Rousse-Varna railway, executed under English, French, and Austria-Hungarian pressure. The new railway was intended to shorten journeys from London to Istanbul by five or six days. Its architectural and constructive plans were provided by the Birkleck brothers (; English spelling uncertain). A water tower, a supportive river wall, and a couple of other facilities were built nearby, using white limestone from nearby villages. In 1866 the station's construction was completed, and it had a waiting room, a room for the station manager, one for the clerk in charge, and some other premises. The exploitation administration, headquartered in London, occupied the building shortly after its opening. Most of the clerks and the supporting staff were Bulgarians. Georgi Tsonchev was the supervisor general of the railway to Varna. Ilarion Dragostinov, Ivan Vedar, and Radi Ivanov worked there as telegraph operators; Georgi Ikonomov was a shunter operator. The railway station developed massive passenger and cargo activity for its time, partly due to the neighbouring harbour. After opening the Rousse-Tarnovo railway in 1900 with its first station Rousse South, the old station was renamed Rousse East, and remained functional until the launching of a classification yard in June 1954, when it was transformed into (a part of the) National Transport Museum. == Gallery == Image:Rousse Transport Museum 2.jpgThe Sultan's wagon Image:Rousse Transport Museum 1.jpg Image:Rousse Transport Museum 4.jpg Image:Rousse Transport Museum 5.jpg Image:Rousse Transport Museum 8.jpgInterior of a carriage with heating Image:Rousse Transport Museum 7.jpgInterior -- slots for mail transport Image:Rousse Transport Museum 3.jpgA handcar == External links == * Museum website == See also == * Orient Express * Varna Railway Station * List of museums in Bulgaria * Bulgarian National Transport Museum (unofficial site) == Sources == * The Utro () newspaper, 21 July 2006, p. 4 Category:Buildings and structures in Ruse, Bulgaria Transport Category:Transport museums in Bulgaria Category:Museums in Ruse Province ","title":"National Transport Museum, Bulgaria"},{"id":"6205224","text":"Gurtnellen is a village and a municipality in the canton of Uri in Switzerland. ==History== Gurtnellen is first mentioned in 1257 as Chuno und die Gurteneller.

Because no factory offered Triton motorcycles, they were typically privately constructed. However, some UK dealers offered complete bikes. The aim was to combine the best elements of each marque and thus gain a bike superior to either. The name 'Triton' is a contraction of Triumph and Norton; and 'Triton' was the name of a mythological Greek God. During the period in which Triton motorcycles were constructed, the Norton Featherbed frame was regarded as the best handling frames. Triton bikes aimed to combine the \\"best engine\\" with the \\"best frame\\" by replacing the standard Norton engine with a Triumph parallel-twin engine. Although \\"best\\" is subjective, a popular engine choice was the Triumph Bonneville unit with twin carburettors and twin camshafts. This pushrod engine gave good performance and reliability and could be more easily tuned for greater power using high-profile camshafts, high compression pistons and twin carburettors. In due course, a Weslake 8-valve head became available for the Triumph motor. The Triumph engine was seen as an upgrade because the Norton 650 and 750 vertical twin engines were known to have reliability problems. At about 7000 rpm the piston exceeds the engineering limit for piston speed, so over-revving soon destroys the engines. The BSA 650 had a bronze bush main bearing on the right hand side, doubling as the crank oil feed, with a lack of effective crankshaft end play control, that all had difficulty staying together when ridden hard, even though the rest of the design was possibly more robust than the Triumph. The Triumph vertical twin used a ball on the timing side, and a roller on the other, with the oil feeding through a separate bronze bush in the outer right hand engine side cover. 650 cc Triumph twin-cylinder engine in a Norton 'slimline' Featherbed frame Whereas the Norton 650SS 646.44 cc had a bore and stroke of 68 x 89 mm giving @ 6,800 rpm, the Triumph T120 Bonneville 649.31 cc had a bore and stroke of 71 x 82 mm giving @ 6,500 rpm. However the mean piston speed of the Norton was 3,971 ft/min (almost at the, then accepted, limit of 4,000 ft/min). The Triumph, with its shorter stroke, had a mean piston speed of only 3,497 ft/min, had much less vibration and was much stronger and reliable. Road tests showed that the Norton had a higher top speed due to its advantage. In spite of this, the Triumph was the much preferred engine. The Norton featherbed was the preferred frame, hence the Triton. Tritons with a pre-unit Triumph motor sometimes retained the post-1960 Norton AMC gearbox, which was thought superior to the equivalent Triumph gearbox. A Quaife five speed gearbox was sometimes used. More modern Tritons use a Triumph unit construction twin in a Featherbed frame. Several motorcycle dealers made equipment for Triton conversions, some would do the complete job for customers while others sold complete Tritons. The most important part required are the engine mounting plates and several different designs exist that can affect the engine placement and therefore the handling. The lower the engine is mounted the better the handling achieved from the Norton frame. ==Other hybrids== The Triton was probably the most common hybrid motorcycle, but another was the Tribsa, with a Triumph engine in a BSA frame. Other frame/engine combinations included the 'Norbsa' which had a BSA engine in the Norton featherbed frame. Vincent V-twin motors have on occasion been fitted into Featherbed frames to make a hybrid called a Norvin.Norvin technical section thevincent.com (retrieved 18 November 2007) ==References *Building a Triton in your kitchen *Realclassic 1959 T100 Triton *the Bike Shed's 1955 Triton *Cafe racer at the Open Directory Project Category:British motorcycles Category:Triumph Motorcycles Ltd motorcycles Category:Custom motorcycles Category:Motorcycles introduced in the 1960s Category:Motorcycles powered by straight-twin engines ","title":"Triton motorcycle"},{"id":"6205274","text":"Cheerleader Nation is a US television series based on the Paul Laurence Dunbar High School cheerleading team's ups and downs on the way to Nationals, of which they are the three-time champions.

Land art includes everything from constructing a road, to taking a walk, building a monument, and leaving a mark in the sand. The program seeks to expand upon connections between typically separate fields. Each fall we spend two months camping while traveling 7,000 miles to engage sites that range from the CLUI complex at Wendover, Utah to the pottery culture at Mata Ortiz, Mexico, from earth works like Robert Smithson's Spiral Jetty to archeological sites like Chaco Canyon. We learn from the fact that Donald Judd surrounded himself with both contemporary sculpture and Navajo rugs; that Chaco Canyon and Roden Crater function as celestial instruments; and that the Very Large Array is a scientific research center with a powerful aesthetic presence on the land. We spend the semester living and working in the landscape with guest scholars that expand the range of our definition in disciplines including archeology, art history, architecture, ceramics, criticism, writing, design, and studio art. The immersive nature of how we experience the landscape triggers an amalgamated body of inquiry where students have the opportunity of time and space to develop authority in their work through direct action and reflection. Land Arts hinges on the primacy of first person experience and the realization that human-land relationships are rarely singular. Land Arts of the American West started at the University of New Mexico by artist Bill Gilbert in 2000 and developed as a collaboration between Gilbert and architect Chris Taylor since 2001. From 2002-2008 Land Arts was co-sponsored by the University of New Mexico and the University of Texas at Austin where Taylor taught in the interdisciplinary design program of the Department of Art and Art History. In 2007 Taylor was invited by Incubo to bring together a group of students and professionals from Chile and the United States for a symposium in Santiago and a Land Arts exploration of the Atacama Desert. In 2008 Taylor began teaching in the College of Architecture at Texas Tech University where Land Arts continues to develop in addition to the programming at the University of New Mexico. The program now operates autonomously from both institutions. Operational funding for Land Arts of the American West is provided in part by Lannan Foundation and Andrea Nasher. The book Land Arts of the American West documents the history and development of the program was published by the University of Texas Press in April 2009. ==Program directors== *Bill Gilbert, Department of Art and Art History, University of New Mexico *Chris Taylor, College of Architecture, Texas Tech University ==Sites visited== *Arizona: Chiricahua Mountains, Coolidge Dam, Fire Point, Point Sublime, Grand Canyon, Roden Crater. *New Mexico: Anaya Springs, Chaco Canyon, Bisti Badlands, Bosque del Apache, Cabinetlandia, Cebolla Canyon, El Vado Lake, Gila Cliff Dwellings, Jackpile Mine at Laguna Pueblo, Madrid, Mimbres River, Otero Mesa, Plains of San Agustin, Sawtooth Mountains, The Lightning Field, Turkey Creek, Three Rivers, Twin Buttes, Mount Withington, Very Large Array, Wild Rivers. *Nevada: Double Negative, Goshute Canyon Wilderness, Hoover Dam, Lake Mead, Las Vegas Piece, Montello. *Mexico: Mata Ortiz. *Texas: Boquillas Canyon, El Cosmico, Huaco Tanks, Land Heritage Institute, Lubbock, Marfa - Chinati Foundation and Judd Foundation, Presidio - Adobe Alliance. *Utah: Blue Notch at Lake Powell, CLUI Wendover, Goblin Valley, Horse Tanks, Horseshoe Canyon, Intrepid Potash, Moon House, Muley Point, Spiral Jetty, Sun Tunnels. ==Past field guests== Past field guests include Nick Abdalla, Tori Arpad, Joe Arredondo - director of Landmark Arts at Texas Tech, Steve Badgett, Charles Bowden, Penelope Boyer, Jerry Brody, Chris Calott, Matt Coolidge, Rick Dingus, Intrepid Potash Russ Draper, Sam Douglas.

The house which was erected in 1687 for Johann-Caspar Müller, and whose roof is now returned to its original shape, and now reveals its original red exterior and attractively decorated green-painted windows. Inside the house are portraits of Johann Caspar Müller, his son Johann Sebastian Müller and his wife, as well as other portraits of members of this distinguished local family by Lorenz Justin Ritz and Felix Maria Diogg. There are also works by Adolfo Müller-Ury, the American portrait painter, including portraits of Popes Benedict XV and Pius XII. ==Ski area== In Hospental there is a mountain called Winterhorn, which has been disused since 2007. The 2-man chairlift and the T-bar which were used remain in place.

The Bjurum manor, also known as Stora Bjurum (Grand Bjurum) or Stora Bjurum herrgård (Grand Bjurum manor), is a Swedish manor located in Västergötland. It is one of the largest in the country. Renowned lake Hornborgasjön is located in the manor's lands. The Falköping town is some 11 kilometers south from Bjurum. Earlier the manor contained the area of a whole parish, now some 2500 hectares. It has a long history as an established entity, starting from the Middle Ages. The original manor consisted of four separate wings centered on a square. Three of the wings burned down in the 1750s and the remaining wing was expanded to a single manor house by major Carl Georg Lillie. The current main building is a stone building from 1870, drawn by Helgo Zettervall. It is surrounded by a garden and a park. ==History== Stora Bjurum was originally known as Byurum and Biureem; an elder work for biur, beaver. The manor is mentioned in 1431, when it was owned by the riksråd nobleman Karl Ormsson Gumsehuvud, father-in-law of Charles VIII of Sweden, who left it to his grandchild princess Magdalena of Sweden. Being without own surviving children, she ceded the property in 1491 to her niece lady Kerstin Eriksdatter Gyldenstierne, a half-Danish, surpassing all her brothers. Lady Kerstin was married with lord Hans Aagesen Thott, another Danish-born noble. The couple's son Lord Åke Hansson Tott, marshal of Sweden, was the next owner. He was executed in 1510 by king of Denmark. Through his sister, the manor passed to the Soop family and, in the late 17th-century, to the Stenbock family. In the 1730s, the manor was owned by count Erik Fredrik Stenbock (1686-1739) and came to be infamous in contemporary Sweden as the scene of the Passionsspelen på Stora Bjurum, supported by his wife Eva Margareta Clerck. Shortly thereafter, it came to be owned by major Carl Georg Lillie, who had the manor reconstructed in the 1750s. His son Brynte Lillie sold Stora Bjurum to majoren G. Soop in 1807. The manor changed ownership numerous times during the 19th century. ==References== * Stora Bjurum i Nordisk familjebok (andra upplagan, 1918) Category:Houses in Sweden Category:Buildings and structures in Västra Götaland County Category:Manor houses in Sweden ","title":"Bjurum"},{"id":"6205324","text":"Realp (archaic : Frialp)Abegg, Emil, Die Mundart von Urseren (Beiträge zur Schweizerdeutschen Grammatik.

The southern terminus of the highway is located at the Hawley Lake Dam. The southernmost of the highway are unpaved. The highway initially heads east along the north side of the lake before curving back towards the northwest away from the lake. It continues to the northwest before going through a series of hairpin turns before heading towards the east. The highway curves back towards the north before taking heading back towards the northeast. The highway curves back to the north as it reaches its northern terminus at SR 260.

In September 1962 it moved to the Spetchley Road site.History of former school Royal Grammar School Worcester was the analogous boys' school, and was partly maintained by Hereford and Worcester until 1983 when it became completely independent. Due to the boys' school becoming independent, the LEA proposed changes to its education policy (under a Conservative government) during 1982 to create a 'super' co-educational grammar school on the girls' school site to educate 125 boys and girls (potentially) from the whole of Hereford and Worcester. Sir Keith Joseph had doubts about the scheme. The grammar school closed in 1983. ===Sixth form college=== The sixth form college opened in September 1983 - instead of a 'super' 11-18 co-educational grammar school and six 11-16 comprehensives in Worcester, the sixth form college model was chosen with six comprehensives.

If activated to federal service, the Wing is gained by the United States Air Force Air Mobility Command. ==Mission== The 155th operates the KC-135R Stratotanker, which is responsible for conducting air refueling missions around the world. The unit runs like an active duty base on a smaller scale. Full-time Air Force Security Forces personnel patrol the base and provide security for the aircraft 24 hours a day while firefighter personnel are always on station and on call. The other units on the base usually operate during the day and are also staffed by Active Guard Reserve (AGR) or civilian Technician personnel. ==History== Established on 1 July 1960, by the Nebraska Air National Guard as an expansion of the 173d Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, increased staffing was authorized by the National Guard Bureau to about 900 people. the 173d FIS had won the coveted Spaatz Trophy, as the Guard's finest flying unit in 1963, following second and third-place finishes in 1961 and 1962 respectively. In 1962, 1963 and 1964 the unit won its second, third and fourth Winston P. Wilson Trophies. In May 1964 the mission of the Nebraska Air Guard changed from air defense to tactical reconnaissance using the RF-84 Thunderflash aircraft. The 173rd became the 173rd Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron and the 155th Fighter Group became the 155th Tactical Reconnaissance Group. The first RF-4C Phantom II came to Lincoln in November 1971. In 1972 the unit began its conversion to the RF-4C from the RF-84F. In April 1992 the unit was directed to convert to the KC-135R Stratotanker mission when the U.S. Air Force decided to begin retiring the last of the F-4 Phantom II aircraft. The conversion to the aerial refueling mission began in September 1993 with the arrival of the first KC-135E tanker. On 1 Oct. 1995, the unit was re-designated as the 155th Air Refueling Wing after achieving initial operational capability in the refueling mission three months early. In April 1999, the unit flew its first combat missions. It was the first Air Guard tanker unit to be tasked with supporting Operation Allied Force, the NATO bombing campaign of Serbia and Kosovo. The unit successfully deployed two aircraft and more than 80 personnel to Germany in less than three days and soon became the lead unit for all American tanker operations from its German air base. ===Assistance=== Along with its federal mission, the Nebraska unit is tasked with supporting the state government as well. Since its organization in 1946, it has answered the governor's call on numerous occasions including Operation Snowbound in early 1949 and a special call in May 1975 when 435 Air Guard members were activated to assist in securing a tornado ravaged area in Omaha. In November 1997, Air Guard members were once again called to state active duty to assist in helping Lincoln and neighboring communities recover from an early snowstorm that cut power to nearly one million Nebraskans as a part of Operation Bush Hog. ==Lineage== * Constituted as the 155th Fighter Group (Air Defense) and allotted to the Air National Guard : Extended federal recognition and activated on 1 June 1960 : Redesignated 155th Tactical Reconnaissance Group on 1 May 1964 : Redesignated 155th Reconnaissance Group on 16 March 1992 : Redesignated 155th Air Refueling Group on 1 January 1994 : Redesignated 155th Air Refueling Wing on 1 October 1995 ===Assignments=== * Nebraska Air National Guard, 1 June 1960 – Present : Gained by: Air Defense Command : Gained by: Tactical Air Command, 1 May 1964 : Gained by: Air Combat Command, 1 June 1992 : Gained by: Air Mobility Command, 1 January 1994-Present ===Components=== * 173d Fighter Interceptor (later Tactical Reconnaissance, Reconnaissance, Air Refueling) Squadron, 1 June 1960 – Present *155th Security Forces Squadron *other units ===Stations=== * Lincoln AFB (later Air National Guard Base), 1 June 1960 – Present ===Aircraft=== * F-86L Sabre Interceptor, 1960-1964 * RF-84F Thunderstreak, 1964-1972 * RF-4C Phantom II, 1972-1993 * KC-135R Stratotanker, 1993–Present ==ReferencesNotes=Bibliography=== * 155th Air Refueling Wing@globalsecurity.org * History of the Nebraska Air National Guard * * ==External links== *155th Air Refueling Wing – Nebraska Air National Guard Category:Wings of the United States Air National Guard Category:Military units and formations in Nebraska 0155 ","title":"155th Air Refueling Wing"},{"id":"6205521","text":"Fastow is a surname.

All Council of Europe member states are parties to the Charter. New member states of the Council of Europe are expected to ratify the Charter at the earliest opportunity. The Charter commits the ratifying member states to guaranteeing the political, administrative and financial independence of local authorities. It provides that the principle of local self-government shall be recognised in domestic legislation and, where practicable, in the constitution. Local authorities are to be elected by universal suffrage, and it is the earliest legal instrument to set out the principle of subsidiarity. Local authorities, acting within the limits of the law, are to be able to regulate and manage a substantial share of public affairs under their own responsibility in the interests of the local population. The Charter considers that public responsibilities should be exercised preferably by the authorities closest to the citizens, a higher level being considered only when the co-ordination or discharge of duties is impossible or less efficient at the level immediately below. To this end, the Charter sets out the principles concerning the protection of local authorities' boundaries, the existence of adequate administrative structures and resources for the carrying out of their tasks, the conditions under which responsibilities are to be exercised, the financial resources of local authorities and the legal protection of local self-government. It limits the administrative supervision of local authorities' activities to the verification of lawfulness only. The principles of local self-government contained in the Charter apply to all categories of local authorities. Ratifying states undertake to consider themselves bound by at least twenty paragraphs of Part I of the Charter, including at least ten from among the following: * Article 2, * Article 3, paragraphs 1 and 2, * Article 4, paragraphs 1, 2 and 4, * Article 5, * Article 7, paragraph 1, * Article 8, paragraph 2, * Article 9, paragraphs 1, 2 and 3, * Article 10, paragraph 1, * Article 11. In 2009, a protocol to the Charter (on the right to participate in the affairs of a local authority) was adopted. It entered into force on 1 June 2012.Chart of signatures and ratifications. Additional Protocol to the European Charter of Local Self-Government on the right to participate in the affairs of a local authority The Congress of Local and Regional Authorities has developed a database named \\"Carta-Monitor\\". This database provides access to the analysis, article by article, carried out during the Congress' monitoring missions in the 47 Member States. It also allows for comparative analysis on several articles and countries, as well as statistical research on ratifications of articles and compliance with their implementation. Every report on the application of the Charter in member states or the local elections that the Congress has observed can be consulted on the Congress' web site. ==Group of Independent Experts on the European Charter== The Council of Europe has constituted a consultative body called the Group of Independent Experts on the European Charter, consisting of senior academics. The Group meets twice a year to consider a range of matters related to the European Charter of Local Self-Government, and it also provides legal advice and support to the elected members of the Congress of the Council of Europe who undertake a programme of missions to monitor the situation of local and regional democracy in member states of the Council. The Group is currently considering, through a working group, the question of the possible revision of the Charter, in liaison with the Secretariat and the Rapporteur of the Congress. ==See also== *Council of Europe *Congress of the Council of Europe ==References * Full text of the European Charter of Local Self-Government * Table of signatures and ratifications * Explanatory Report *Official website of the Congress of the Council of Europe *Congress' web page for the Charter *Carta-Monitor: Database of the Charter Monitoring *List of the Monitoring and Observation reports on the Congress' web site Category:Council of Europe treaties Category:Autonomy Category:Local government Category:Treaties concluded in 1985 Category:Treaties entered into force in 1988 Category:Congress of the Council of Europe Category:Treaties of Albania Category:Treaties of Andorra Category:Treaties of Armenia Category:Treaties of Austria Category:Treaties of Azerbaijan Category:Treaties of Belgium Category:Treaties of Bosnia and Herzegovina Category:Treaties of Bulgaria Category:Treaties of Croatia Category:Treaties of Cyprus Category:Treaties of the Czech Republic Category:Treaties of Denmark Category:Treaties of Estonia Category:Treaties of Finland Category:Treaties of France Category:Treaties of Georgia (country) Category:Treaties of West Germany Category:Treaties of Greece Category:Treaties of Hungary Category:Treaties of Iceland Category:Treaties of Ireland Category:Treaties of Italy Category:Treaties of Latvia Category:Treaties of Liechtenstein Category:Treaties of Lithuania Category:Treaties of Luxembourg Category:Treaties of Malta Category:Treaties of Moldova Category:Treaties of Monaco Category:Treaties of Montenegro Category:Treaties of the Netherlands Category:Treaties of Norway Category:Treaties of Poland Category:Treaties of Portugal Category:Treaties of Romania Category:Treaties of Russia Category:Treaties of San Marino Category:Treaties of Serbia Category:Treaties of Slovakia Category:Treaties of Slovenia Category:Treaties of Spain Category:Treaties of Sweden Category:Treaties of Switzerland Category:Treaties of North Macedonia Category:Treaties of Turkey Category:Treaties of Ukraine Category:Treaties of the United Kingdom Category:1985 in France ","title":"European Charter of Local Self-Government"},{"id":"6205558","text":"Especifismo (, \\"specifism\\") is one of the two main forms of anarchist activism championed by FARJ (Federação Anarquista do Rio de Janeiro) and other South American anarchist organizations, the other being social insertion. Especifismo emerged as a result of anarchist experiences in South America over the last half of the 20th century starting with the Federación Anarquista Uruguaya (FAU), which was founded in 1956 by anarchists who saw the need for an organization which was specifically anarchist. ==Overview== Especifismo has been summarized as: *The need for a specifically anarchist organization built around a unity of ideas and praxis. *The use of the specifically anarchist organization to theorize and develop strategic political and organizing work. *Active involvement in and building of autonomous and popular social movements via social insertion.NEFAC (2006) \\"Especifismo: The Anarchist Praxis of Building Popular Movements and Revolutionary Organization in South America\\". Other organizations that propound especifismo include the Federação Anarquista Gaúcha (FAG), the Federação Anarquista Cabocla (FACA), the Federação Anarquista do Rio de Janeiro (FARJ), the Columna Libertaria Joaquin Penina (Joaquin Penina) Libertarian Column) from Rosario, Argentina, the Columna Libertaria Errico Malatesta from Buenos Aires, and the Red Libertaria de Buenos Aires (RLBA), also from Argentina. The Zabalaza Anarchist Communist Front in South Africa and Black Rose Anarchist Federation (BRRN) in the United States also take especifismo as key points of reference. Especifismo is considered to have come to broadly similar conclusions to the Organizational Platform of the General Union of Anarchists (Draft) and may be considered to be very similar to platformism, which in turn claims its roots lie in the organisational work of figures like Mikhail Bakunin, Errico Malatesta and Nestor Makhno. == Citations == Category:Anarchist theory Category:Platformism ","title":"Especifismo"},{"id":"6205567","text":"Neuromancer is an adventure video game developed by Interplay Productions and published by Mediagenic (a brand name that Activision was also known by). It was released in 1988 for the Amiga, Apple II, Apple IIGS, Commodore 64, and MS-DOS. It was loosely based on William Gibson's 1984 novel of the same name and set within both the fictional \\"real world\\" and the extensively realized and detailed world of cyberspace. It has a soundtrack based on the Devo song \\"Some Things Never Change\\" from their album Total Devo. The gaming rights at the time were owned by Timothy Leary, who brought the project to Interplay to develop. ==Gameplay== The gameplay was split between a traditional adventure setting, where a player could interact with \\"real world\\" inhabitants within Chiba City, and a 3D grid representation of cyberspace once he'd managed to regain access. Different \\"real world\\" locations led to different grid sectors, thus developing the plot and enriching the immersion. Cyberspace combat was also simulated in the game as the player attempted to breach ICE (Intrusion Countermeasure Electronics) to gain entry to database nodes and potentially face the formidable AIs (Artificial Intelligences) that hide behind them. \\"Combat\\" with ICE consisted of the ICE and the player doing damage to each other (the former through a built-in attack form, the latter based on what programs the player ran; some programs did one-time damage, some did damage over time for a while, and some had other effects such as slowing down the ICE) until either the ICE \\"cracked\\" or the player was kicked out of cyberspace. Combat with AIs was similar, except that AIs were damaged primarily with skills rather than programs; were invulnerable until hit at least once with a specific skill or program; and the result of \\"losing\\" was character death. Neuromancer was somewhat forgiving of even \\"death\\", as a deceased character would be reanimated for the price of whatever money was in his credit chip at the time of death - although remaining logged into cyberspace at some points required credit payment. Skills and abilities can be purchased as \\"skill chips\\" that can be used in a brain jack implanted in the protagonist's head, giving him an edge in a variety of situations. Skills could also increase with successful completion of a difficult task. The game also used a code wheel as a form of copy protection. The code wheel was necessary to access the PAX terminals in the game at certain points and without it, the player hits a dead-end in the plot. ==Plot== The game is loosely based on the events of the novel Neuromancer by William Gibson. Locations, characters, items and nuances of cyberspace from the novel appear. Taking place in the year 2058 in Chiba, Japan, the plot centered on the protagonist attempting to discover the truth behind the mysterious disappearances of his friends as well as other, less friendly cyberspace cowboys. Unfortunately, the player's character has fallen on hard times and has had to pawn his cyberspace deck. He awakes in a plate of Ratz' famous spaghetti, and the first order of business is to find some way to retrieve his old deck from the nearby pawnshop. After obtaining the deck and upgrading the software to enable cyberspace access, the character finds that users of the Matrix are being killed or flatlined by a group of AIs led by a renegade named Greystoke. After destroying Greystoke, the player meets Neuromancer who explains that he has manipulated the player into killing the other AIs, and traps him on a virtual island (as in the ending of the book). However, the player can use their skills to escape and destroy Neuromancer, making the Matrix safe again. Some other aspects of the book are included in the game as red herrings. For example, the character Armitage can contact the player at one point, but if the player accepts his mission, he and Armitage are immediately arrested. ==Reception== Computer Gaming World gave Neuromancer a very favorable review, citing the game's pacing and wit, as well as the use of Gibson's setting. Combat was also praised, as was the reward of information for winning combat. The only complaints it had about the game were the predetermined responses in conversation, and the excessive use of disk swapping. The magazine awarded it a title of \\"Adventure Game of the Year\\", and in 1996 included it on lists of the \\"150 Best Games of All Time\\" and \\"15 best ways to die in computer gaming\\". Compute! also favorably reviewed the game, citing the graphics, user interface, and the Devo soundtrack, and only criticizing the \\"adolescent jokes\\". The magazine named the game to its list of \\"nine great games for 1989\\". ==Reviews== *Challenge #42 (1990) ==References * Neuromancer at Hall of Light Amiga database * * * Images of Neuromancer C64 package, manual and screen shots Category:1988 video games Category:Adventure games Category:Amiga games Category:Apple II games Category:Apple IIGS games Category:Commodore 64 games Category:Cyberpunk video games Category:DOS games Category:Interplay Entertainment games Category:Video games based on novels Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Video games using code wheel copy protection Category:William Gibson Category:Video games scored by Barry Leitch ","title":"Neuromancer (video game)"},{"id":"6205577","text":"The Pennypack Creek in Pennypack Park Pennypack Park is a municipal park, part of the Philadelphia Parks & Recreation system, in Northeast Philadelphia in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania.

Its gameplay is largely similar to that of the Puzzle Bobble series, but it has several unique differences. == Gameplay == There are four game modes: Endless, Stomped, Fossil, and Time Trial. === Endless Puzzle === Rows of eggs of various colors descend from the top of the screen. The player must use their slingshot to shoot their own supply of eggs up at them. When three or more eggs of the same color match, they will explode. If the mass of eggs descend to the bottom of the screen, an alarm will sound and the player will have three seconds to break any eggs that reached the bottom, or else the entire screen will be crushed by the foot of Mama Brontosaurus, and the game will end. An interesting aspect to make the game increasingly difficult as the player plays a single game for a longer amount of time is the inclusion of Whirley. Every minute or so during gameplay, a dinosaur will announce \\"Whirley's coming!\\", and soon after, Whirley (a purple pterodactyl) will fly across the screen carrying an egg of a color not yet on their screen. If Whirley is allowed to fly across the screen untouched, the color of his egg will be added to the palette of colors in the egg mass, and the rate of the eggs' descent will reset to the default slow speed. However, if players shoot and hit Whirley, the color will not be added, but the rate at which the eggs descend will increase. Some eggs in an egg mass will occasionally vibrate for a short period of time. If they are made to explode while still vibrating, a player soon receives a special egg for the slingshot that offers some form of bonus when shot and eventually forced to explode: the play area either narrows or widens to increase/decrease the speed of the dropping egg mass, the play area raises upward (only given when the eggs are very close to the warning line), the player receives a one-time bonus of (50, 100, or 200) points, an automatic score multiplier (2x, 3x or 4x) for 30 seconds, or the ability to see the full trajectory (including rebounds) of the egg to be shot for one minute. === Stomped === A puzzle arrangement appears on the screen. The goal is to clear the arrangement by shooting matching eggs of the corresponding colour next to it. However, every egg the player shoots will increase Mama Bronto's anger meter. Every time the meter gets full, Mama Bronto pushes the puzzle down one notch with her foot, making the board more difficult to accomplish. There are 30 stomped puzzles, and after completing all 30, level 31 will start the puzzles from the beginning again. === Fossil === A piece of a dinosaur fossil is surrounded by eggs, and the player must shoot matching eggs to break the piece free and add it to a collection of completed fossils. There are 15 fossils, each having three fragments, for a total of 45 levels in this mode. Like Endless Puzzle, if the eggs and fossil piece reach the bottom of the screen, Mama Bronto will crush the screen and the game is over. === Time Trial === A multi-layered arrangement of eggs (60 rows and five colors in Easy mode, 30 rows and seven colors in Normal mode, and 15 rows and nine colors in Hard mode) must be cleared by shooting the correctly colored eggs at the ones on screen. If there are 90 rows, trying to add an egg to make the 91st row will break the egg instead. Unlike the other games, this one does not have a time limit; instead, it keeps a record of the player's five fastest clearances across all difficulties. == Versions == There are two versions of this game: the Java applet-based web version, and the downloadable version (called Dynomite Deluxe). Dynomite Deluxe includes enhanced graphics, a musical soundtrack by Skaven, the ability to upload high scores, and full functionality for all game modes. Dynomite Deluxe is available to purchase either from PopCap's website, Origin, or through Steam. == External links == * Category:2002 video games Category:PopCap games Category:Puzzle video games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Windows games Category:Windows-only games Category:Dinosaurs in video games Category:Single- player video games ","title":"Dynomite!"},{"id":"6205610","text":"Major General Roger Philip Lempke is a retired United States Air Force officer and was the adjutant general (TAG) of the Nebraska National Guard.

The game's four other modes include racing around tracks, performing stunts for points, free roam, and time trials. The game was developed to be in the same game style as the classic ps1 Driver games because of the limitations they had during development having no licence for the actors of the movie. ==Reception== The game received mixed reviews.

The shoe allows for more games to be played by reducing the time between shuffles and less chance of dealer cheating. In some games, such as blackjack (where card counting is a possibility), using multiple decks of cards can increase the house edge. ==History== Prior to 1961 in Las Vegas casinos, all blackjack was being dealt from a single deck. John Scarne proposed to the Nevada Gaming Control Board that a state ruling be enacted such that Blackjack must be dealt from a shoe (Scarne's invention). While no such ruling was ever passed, most Nevada casinos now deal from a multi-deck shoe. As gaming advisor to the Havana Hilton, Scarne also introduced the shoe to Puerto Rico and Cuba. The device is so named because the earliest versions of it resembled a woman's high-heel shoe, and were often painted red or black in color. ==Usage== Dealing shoes come in many colors and sizes, depending on the number of decks they are capable of holding (2, 4, 6, or 8 decks). When the cards are placed in the shoe, the dealer will insert a brightly colored blank plastic card. When this card is drawn it indicates that the current game is the last one before a new shuffle. This helps mitigate player advantage via card counting, as a significant portion (usually about 25 percent) of the full inventory of cards never comes into play. The percentage of cards that are dealt is sometimes called the penetration. ==ReferencesBibliography== * Category:Gaming devices Category:Playing cards ","title":"Shoe (cards)"},{"id":"6205660","text":"William F. Sturgis (February 25, 1782 - October 21, 1863) was a Boston merchant in the China trade, the California hide trade and the maritime fur trade. ==Early life== Sturgis was born in Barnstable, Massachusetts, to Hannah Mills and William E. Sturgis, a ship master and lineal descendant from Edward Sturgis of Yarmouth, Massachusetts, the first Sturgis in America (arrived 1630). In 1796, he joined the counting house of his uncle Russell Sturgis (1750–1826), and less than two years later became connected with James and Thomas Handasyd Perkins' maritime fur trade between the Pacific Northwest coast and China. Their sister, Elizabeth Perkins, was the wife of Russell Sturgis. Upon his father's death in 1797, he went to sea to support the family as assistant trader on the Eliza, then as chief mate of Ulysses. He then served under Captain Charles Derby on Caroline until Derby died and Sturgis took command. In 1804 Caroline sailed from the Columbia River to Kaigani, just south of Prince of Wales Island, Alaska, acquiring some 2,500 sea otter skins that netted $73,034. In 1809, his ship Atahualpa, owned by Theodore Lyman, was attacked by Chinese pirates while moored at Macau Roads. Sturgis managed to get the ship underway and fought off the pirates using four small cannons he had brought on board against the wishes of the ship's owner. Using these, they managed to fight long enough to sail within range of the protective guns of the harbor, and the pirates were captured, their commander Apootsae later being tortured to death by the Mandarin authorities. Sturgis had been prepared to blow up the ship if the pirates caught them in order to save the crew and passengers from being tortured. Lyman reportedly chastised Sturgis for having violated his instructions by bringing the cannon on the voyage. ==Bryant & Sturgis== In 1810, he returned to Boston formed a trading partnership with John Bryant as Bryant & Sturgis.Bryant & Sturgis (Boston, Mass.) records, 1801-1872 (inclusive): A Finding Aid; Bryant Library, Harvard Business School They served as investment managers to John Perkins Cushing, when Cushing was in the railroad business in New York and Pennsylvania. By 1843, Sturgis was a director of the Attica and Buffalo Railroad. It was with advice from Sturgis that John and Bennett Forbes started their investment in the railroad business in 1843. From 1810 to 1850 more than half of the trade carried on between the Pacific Northwest coast and China was operated by Bryant & Sturgis, and also substantial parts of the California hide trade. ==Personal life== On his return to Boston in 1810 he married Elizabeth M. Davis, with whom he had one son, William Watson (1810–1826), and five daughters: Ellen Sturgis Hooper (1812–1848), a Transcendentalist poet and mother of Marian Hooper Adams; Anne Sturgis (1813–1884); Caroline Sturgis Tappan (1819–1888), a member of the Transcendental Club and poet published in The Dial, whose daughter Mary Aspinwall Tappan (1851-1941) and granddaughter Rosamund Sturgis Dixey (1887-1948) donated the Tanglewood estate to the Boston Symphony Orchestra in 1936; Mary Louisa Sturgis (1821–1870); and Susan Sturgis (1825–1853). == Political Career == In 1814, Sturgis was elected a representative of the town of Boston in the Legislature of Massachusetts. From that year until 1845, he was a member of the Massachusetts House or of the Senate. Sturgis was a member and a president of the Boston Marine Society, an honorary member of the Massachusetts Mechanics' Charitable Association and a member of the Massachusetts Historical Society. ==Legacy== Sturgis donated his childhood home to be the Barnstable public library, now called the Sturgis Library,Sturgis Library and his papers are collected there.Sturgis Library Archives Bryant & Sturgis business records are preserved at the Baker Library of the Harvard Business School. A short time before his death, Sturgis donated $10,000 to the Observatory in Cambridge. Sturgis was one of the early investors in Massachusetts General Hospital. He was a trustee of the Boston Athenaeum from 1823 to 1825. There is a Sturgis Charter Public School, an IB For all 9-12 school in Hyannis, Massachusetts. ===The ship William Sturgis=== William Sturgis of Boston was an 1849 ship of 649½ tons, built by James O. Curtis in Medford, Massachusetts, for William F. Weld & Co. She sailed from Cardiff to Iloilo with a cargo of coal. On Sept. 19, 1863, she was off the coast of Guimaras. She struck the Magicienne Bank, then sank on Ottorg Bank. == References == ;General * William F.

This is not to be confused with Monotropa uniflora which is also referred to as the “Ghost plant”. G. paraguayense has white flowers which have a form of a star. ==Description== The plant has a spreading and creeping habit that reaches 20 cm high by 60 cm wide. Its appearance may vary depending on the soil and the exposure. The hanging rod can reach up to 2 m in length and a thickness of 2 cm. Green to light grey leaves can be up to 7 cm long and 3 cm wide. Thick and fleshy, they are arranged in a spiral around the stem and are very easily detached from the rosette, that is why this plant has been nicknamed \\"porcelain succulent\\". Its flowers appearing in spring have five white petals spotted with red. ==Cultivation== This hardy plant stands temperatures down to −10°C. If it is sheltered from rain and too much humidity, it is easy to grow in temperate climates. It is readily propagated by cutting leaves or stems. It supports both full sun and partial shade.

Together with the Pact of Madrid, signed the same year, it was a significant effort to break Spain's international isolation after World War II. In return for the granting by the Vatican of the \\"royal patronage\\" (Patronato real, the historical privilege of Spanish kings to appoint clerical figures) to Franco, the concordat gave the Catholic Church in Spain a set of privileges such as state funding and exemption from government taxation. The Concordat of 1953 superseded the Concordat of 1851 and Franco's 1941 Convention with the Vatican. ==Background== Franco's political system was virtually the antithesis of the final government of the Second Spanish Republic, the Popular Front government. In the early years of the Francoist regime, church and state had a close and mutually beneficial association. Franco had wanted a full concordat with royal rights of patronage, the right to choose bishops. The Vatican, uncertain of his future, compromised by offering him a less official \\"convention\\", signed on 7 June 1941,\\"Franco's wartime convention (1941)\\", Concordat Watch and gave him only a limited role in choosing bishops. Years after World War II, the terms of the Convention of 1941 were formalized in Article 7 of the Concordat of 1953. In contrast to the anticlericalism of the Popular Front, the Francoist regime established policies that were highly favorable to the Catholic Church, which was restored to its previous status as the official religion of Spain. In addition to receiving government subsidies, the church regained its dominant position in the education system, and laws conformed to Catholic dogma. During the Francoist regime, Roman Catholicism was the only religion to have legal status; other worship services could not be advertised, and the Roman Catholic Church was the only religious institution that was permitted to own property or publish books. The government not only continued to pay priests' salaries and to subsidize the church but it also assisted in the reconstruction of church buildings damaged by the war. Laws were passed abolishing divorce and banning the sale of contraceptives. Catholic religious instruction was mandatory, even in state schools. In return for granting the Catholic Church these privileges, Franco obtained the right to name Roman Catholic bishops in Spain, as well as veto power over appointments of clergy down to the parish priest level. ==Terms== In 1953 this close cooperation was formalized in a new Concordat with the Vatican, which granted the church an extraordinary set of privileges:\\"Franco's concordat (1953) : Text\\", Concordat Watch\\"Spanish Concordat of 1953, Articles 1, 2, 24, 26, 31\\", Berkley Center for Religion, Peace, and World Affairs, Georgetown University *mandatory canonical marriages for all Catholics; *exemption from government taxation; *subsidies for new building construction; *censorship of materials the church deemed offensive; *the right to establish universities; *the right to operate radio stations, and to publish newspapers and magazines; *protection from police intrusion into church properties; and *exemption of clergy from military service. ==Aftermath== With the death of Franco in 1975 and Spain's subsequent transition to democracy, the Concordat was changed and amended several times. In 1976, a convention\\"Modifications to Franco's concordat (1976)\\", Concordat Watch between the Spanish government and the Holy See abolished the right to nominate bishops for the Spanish head of state. In 1978, the new democratic constitution that brought Francoism to a final end established the principle of religious neutrality (aconfesionalidad) of the Spanish state and the complete freedom of religion for its citizens. In 1979, another convention\\"The four 1979 concordats\\", Concordat Watch between the Spanish government and the Holy See changed the law regarding financial aspects and public subsidies for the Catholic church. ==See also== *National Catholicism *Holy See–Spain relations *Relations between the Catholic Church and the state *Lateran Treaty, 1929 treaty between the Holy See and Fascist Italy *Reichskonkordat, 1933 treaty between the Holy See and Nazi Germany ==References *Text of the Concordat: Spanish Category:History of Catholicism in Spain Category:20th century in Spain Category:Holy See–Spain relations Category:Treaties concluded in 1953 Category:Treaties entered into force in 1953 1953 Category:Treaties of Francoist Spain Category:1953 in Spain Category:Christianity and law in the 20th century ","title":"Concordat of 1953"},{"id":"6205758","text":"V-Rally 3 is a racing video game developed by Eden Studios and published by Infogrames.

Its seat is the town of Curanipe. ==Demography== Although Curanipe is the municipal seat, Pelluhue has a greater population, both permanent and seasonal. According to the 2002 census of the National Statistics Institute, Pelluhue spans an area of and has 6,414 inhabitants (3,408 men and 3,006 women). Of these, 3,877 (60.4%) lived in urban areas and 2,537 (39.6%) in rural areas. Because of its appeal as a tourism and retirement center, Pelluhue has been steadily growing over the last two decades. Its population increase rate has been one of the highest in the Maule Region, growing by 17.2% (943 persons) between the 1992 and 2002 censuses. ==History== Both towns, Pelluhue and Curanipe, are nowadays popular coastal resorts. Pelluhue evolved from a humble fishermen's cove to a crowded summer resort in less than 50 years. The town's population swells to over several thousand in the summer week-ends when vacationers from the hinterland (Cauquenes, Linares, Talca, Parral) visit the seaside. Curanipe has a more \\"patrician\\" past, having been already a well-known and secluded coastal resort for the Cauquenes elite and a proud \\"minor port\\", in the mid- and late 19th century and early 20th century. Both Pelluhue and Curanipe were part of the municipality of Chanco until 1979. The municipality and commune (Spanish:comuna) of Pelluhue was officially created on October 26, 1979, when both towns, together with their adjacent territories, formed a new municipality. The Curanipe parish church of Santo Toribio is a preserved religious building overlooking the town. From the ecclesiastical point of view, Pelluhue belongs to the Parish of Curanipe, of the Diocese of Linares, Chile. ==Administration== As a commune, Pelluhue is a third-level administrative division of Chile administered by a municipal council, headed by an alcalde who is directly elected every four years. The 2008-2012 alcalde is Carlos Zúñiga Villaseñor (UDI). Within the electoral divisions of Chile, Pelluhue is represented in the Chamber of Deputies by Guillermo Ceroni (PPD) and Ignacio Urrutia (UDI) as part of the 40th electoral district, (together with Longaví, Retiro, Parral, Cauquenes and Chanco). The commune is represented in the Senate by Hernán Larraín (UDI) and Ximena Rincón González (PDC) as part of the 11th senatorial constituency (Maule-South). ==Attractions and tourism== In the southernmost corner of the municipality, which borders the Bío Bío Region, lies the semi-isolated beach of Tregualemu, next to which there are two old, large rural houses of Chilean colonial style. The \\"Los Ruiles\\" National Reserve is a park in the easternmost part of the municipality, located in the foothills of the \\"Cordillera de la Costa\\". A small oasis next to the road that connects Chanco and Cauquenes, the park contains many native species of trees and plants. Several of them are unique to the region and some are in danger of extinction. The reserve has a surface of 29 hectares. There is a reception area, several picnic tables and two footpaths. ==Earthquake== On February 27, 2010, Pelluhue and Curanipe were partially destroyed by an earthquake measuring 8.8 on the moment magnitude scale, and its associated tsunami that left 60 ft fishing vessels in the streets, the towns \\"covered in mud\\" and hundreds of homes \\"completely gone\\", as reported by the press. Scores of bodies have been found in the area and an estimated 300 homes were destroyed in Pelluhue alone. The commune of Pelluhue lies close to the town of Cobquecura, the reported epicenter of the earthquake. ==References== Category:Populated places in Cauquenes Province Category:Communes of Chile Category:Populated places established in 1979 ","title":"Pelluhue"},{"id":"6205785","text":"Morton Stevens (January 30, 1929 - November 11, 1991) was an American film score composer. In 1965, he became director of music for CBS West Coast operations. He is probably best known for composing the theme music for Hawaii Five-O, a CBS television series for which he won two Emmy Awards in 1970 and 1974. Stevens was taught by Oscar-winning composer Jerry Goldsmith, with whom he frequently collaborated on other projects. ==Biography== Stevens graduated from the Juilliard School in 1950, and within a few years began working as an arranger/conductor for Sammy Davis Jr. After Davis's longtime conductor, George Rhodes, died in 1985, Stevens was among those who filled that role again sporadically until Davis' death in 1990. In his later years, Stevens worked as conductor for other Vegas legends, including Jerry Lewis, and was musical director for the \\"Rat Pack\\" tour featuring Davis, Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, and—after Martin quit—Liza Minnelli. His classic theme for Hawaii Five-O was later re-recorded for the remake of the television series in 2010. He won two Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Music Composition for a Series for his work on Hawaii Five-O and was nominated seven other times for work on television programs, including the 1969 Hawaii Five-O pilot episode, Gunsmoke and Police Woman. His film work included scores for films and TV movies such as Wild and Wonderful (1964), The Spy with My Face (1965), Deadly Harvest (1972), The Strangers in 7A (1972), The Horror at 37,000 Feet (1973), The Disappearance of Flight 412 (1974), Code Name: Diamond Head (1977), Wheels (1978), The One Man Jury (1978), Women in White (1979), Great White (1982) They Still Call Me Bruce (1987), Act of Piracy (1988) and the Jerry Lewis films Hardly Working (1980), Slapstick of Another Kind (1982) and Cracking Up (1983). In addition to \\"Hawaii Five-O\\", he also worked on the earlier smash 1960s CBS Television series dealing with an island, of a different kind: \\"Gilligan's Island\\", 1964-1967, as one of a handful of composers with his above-mentioned, frequent coworker, Jerry Goldsmith, John Williams, Gerald Fried, Billy May, and other composers. Stevens also composed \\"So Old, So Young,\\" used as the theme music (in two separate arrangements) for CBS' primetime (from 1966 to 1978) and late night (from 1972 to 1985) movie broadcasts. Stevens died of pancreatic cancer in Encino, California at the age of 62. ==References* * Category:1929 births Category:1991 deaths Category:20th-century American composers Category:20th- century classical musicians Category:20th-century American male musicians Category:American film score composers Category:American Jews Category:American male composers Category:American television composers Category:Deaths from cancer in California Category:Deaths from pancreatic cancer Category:Hawaii Five-O Category:Juilliard School alumni Category:Male film score composers Category:Male television composers Category:Musicians from Newark, New Jersey ","title":"Morton Stevens"},{"id":"6205794","text":"Stolfi with Condoleezza Rice in Washington DC.

It left Emmanuel-Joseph Sieyès as the dominant figure of the French government, and prefigured the coup of 18 Brumaire that brought Napoleon Bonaparte to power. ==Prelude== The March-April 1799 elections of 315 new deputies into the two councils had produced a new Neo- Jacobin majority in these two bodies, particularly in the lower house. The Council of Five Hundred — the lower house in the legislature under the French Directory — became unhappy with the directors' conduct of the War of the Second Coalition, and in particular with their recall of General Jean Étienne Championnet, a former Jacobin. The Council of Ancients and Council of Five Hundred—the two legislative branches under the French Directory—voted an act declaring that the election of Director Jean-Baptiste Treilhard had been illegal, and on 29 Prairial/17 June had replaced him with Louis Gohier, erstwhile Jacobin deputy and minister during the French Convention. ==Coup== But the Councils were not satisfied with one removal. The new anti-Jacobin Director Emmanuel-Joseph Sieyès shared, in some degree, the Councils' sentiments and, by holding this view, it likely helped him into his new appointment to office in May 1799. He was glad to see his colleagues removed, and was perfectly willing to work with Jacobin generals to achieve his ends. In the Council of Five Hundred, the deputy Antoine, comte Boulay de la Meurthe, generally seen as a moderate, demanded the resignation or removal of directors Louis-Marie de La Révellière-Lépeaux and Philippe Antoine Merlin de Douai. In this he was soon joined not only by his own Council but by the Council of Ancients, and by directors Paul Barras, a Directory veteran since 1795 who was popularly known for his cunning, a trait which likely ensured that he was not to be yet another director who should have been removed, and by the newly appointed Sieyès. When Révellière de Lépeaux and Merlin de Douai resisted, General Barthélémy Catherine Joubert, recently placed in command of the 17th military division (Paris) organized some troop movements of soldiers in Paris. By the evening of 18 June, Révellière-Lépeaux and Merlin had both tendered their resignations. Although nothing in this sequence of events formally violated the French Constitution of 1795, it is generally considered a coup. ==References== 30 Prairial Year VII, Coup of Category:1799 in France Category:18th-century coups d'état and coup attempts Category:Military coups in France Category:French Directory ","title":"Coup of 30 Prairial VII"},{"id":"6205820","text":"The name Boudiga may refer to: *Boudica (also spelled \\"Boudiga\\") (died 60 or 61 CE), the Brythonic queen (or chieftainess) of the Icenes *Boudiga or Tutela Boudiga, a Gaulish war goddess thought to be related to Cathubodua ","title":"Boudiga"},{"id":"6205827","text":"Is It College Yet? is a 2002 American animated comedy-drama television film written by Glenn Eichler and Peggy Niccoll, and directed by Karen Disher.

At Bromwell, Tom charms the admission officer with stories about his family's experiences there, while Daria, feeling self-conscious, only musters inarticulate and vapid responses. Daria and the Sloanes leave Bromwell later than planned after a boisterous professor holds them up. To Daria's dismay, they arrive at Raft after the admission office has closed. Daria is accepted by Raft, but wait listed by Bromwell. Tom reveals he got into Bromwell and doesn't congratulate Daria for getting into Raft, upsetting her. Daria admonishes Tom for the privilege his family's wealth and status affords and accuses him of looking down on her and Raft. She insinuates that being a Sloane was the sole reason he got accepted, while Tom blames Daria's personality as the reason she wasn't. After reconciling, Tom offers to have his parents write Daria a letter of recommendation to Bromwell, but she declines. Jane wants to attend Boston Fine Arts College/ BFAC, but is overwhelmed with creating a portfolio. Instead, she applies to less demanding colleges, but is rejected. She considers skipping college entirely and argues with Daria over the necessity of higher education. Jane agrees to submit a portfolio to BFAC if Daria lets Tom's parents recommend her to Bromwell, which she does. Jane's brother, Trent, accuses Jane of 'selling-out' as an artist, before admitting he's afraid of losing her. Despite the Sloanes' letter, Daria is rejected by Bromwell. However, she feels no disappointment and announces to her parents that she is going to Raft, which they are proud of. During a date with Tom, Daria dumps him, explaining that their lives are diverging and the relationship has run its course. While initially shocked, Tom is unable to argue otherwise, and they agree to stay in touch as friends. Daria is also thrilled to discover that Jane was accepted into BFAC, and will join her in Boston. Mack and Jodie worry about becoming a long-distance couple after high school. Jodie, exhausted from being the model minority student at Lawndale, wants to attend Turner College, a historically black university, while her parents expect her to attend the exclusive Crestmore University. Mack applies for Vance College, but needs a scholarship to afford it. Jodie is accepted by Crestmore and Turner, but is distraught because her parents pressure her to go to Crestmore. Mack contacts Jodie's father to explain her distress, leading to her parents changing their minds. Mack also receives his scholarship. While they will be geographically separated, Jodie is convinced this experience has brought them closer. Brittney is accepted to local Prairie State University, but boyfriend Kevin will need to repeat his senior year due to abysmal grades. Embarrassed, Kevin tries to hide this from Brittney before coming clean, and asks if she'll stay with him through college. Brittney promises she will, while secretly crossing her fingers. Daria's younger sister, Quinn, gets her first job as a restaurant hostess and befriends an older coworker named Lindy. Quinn's work causes her to miss several Fashion Club meetings, and the clique drifts apart. Quinn notices Lindy has a drinking problem, which culminates with Lindy arriving at work drunk and getting fired. Quinn implores her to seek help, but Lindy angrily denies Quinn's assertions. Lindy later apologizes, but still insists she's not an alcoholic. At an end of year party, the Fashion Club officially dissolves, but the members, including Quinn, plan to informally meet as friends, without the toxic politics of the club. At graduation, Daria unexpectedly wins an academic award and is forced to improvise a speech. She reiterates her contempt for high school, but ends with a summation of her life philosophy and expresses gratitude for Jane and her family, drawing applause from the crowd. Afterwards, Daria and Jane meet for pizza as usual, and muse on what they'll find once they arrive at college and begin a new era in their lives. During the end credits, various \\"alter ego\\" renderings (more detailed than at the end of the regular episodes) depict possible future careers and scenarios for nearly all of the series' characters. == Soundtrack == The first music video for \\"Breaking Up the Girl\\" by Garbage premiered as part of the film, featuring a Daria montage, and the song was promoted as the \\"theme song\\" for College;Breaking Up the Girl (trade ad) in USA: Hits magazine. 2001-12-01. the song used during the title sequence of the film was Splendora's last-ever song \\"College Try (Gives Me Blisters)\\". ==Alternate version== An edited version of this TV-movie was cablecast by MTV in reruns, which cut several minutes from the original broadcast version.

Orphaned, Smith was brought up by his uncle and aunt. In his teenage years he moved to Arizona to work on a cattle ranch and played in a country and western band on weekends. He worked in construction and local farmhands taught him to play the double bass. Around this time Smith showed an interest in boxing, so his aunt bought Smith an electric bass guitar to encourage him to follow a musical path instead. === Career === Smith migrated to Chicago in the mid-1950s with his wife, Etta Mae. In the early 1960s he began performing in clubs, learning guitar from J. B. Lenoir (his first cousin who had encouraged him to migrate), Robert Lockwood, Jr., and Hubert Sumlin. He worked regularly as rhythm guitarist for Otis Rush. During this period he recorded a number of singles with labels such as Bea & Baby, Cruise and Apex but in 1965 returned to his gospel roots with a group called the Gospel Travellers. In the 1970s he joined the house band at Theresa’s Tavern where he worked for five years, often playing with Junior Wells. In 1974 he recorded various tracks with Sunnyland Slim for Slim's later album 'She Got A Thing Goin' On'. In the late 1970s, Smith toured with the likes of Big Mama Thornton and George \\"Harmonica\\" Smith. After years playing in clubs all over the world, a demo tape Smith recorded became the album Tell Me How You Like It, released by the Texas-based Grits record label. His next release in the United Kingdom was Addressing the Nation with the Blues for JSP Records. In 1995, Smith retired from his job at Economy Folding Box Company after twenty-five years, allowing him to focus fully on music. Smith retired from touring in 2015.

This valley was formed by the ancient glacial Lake Agassiz which has rich deposits of black soil. Winnipeg is on the eastern edge of the Canadian Prairies in Western Canada; it is known as the 'Gateway to the West'. It is relatively close to many large Canadian Shield lakes and parks, as well as Lake Winnipeg (the Earth's twelve largest freshwater lake). Winnipeg is bordered by tallgrass prairie to the west and south and the aspen parkland to the northeast. Winnipeg is fairly isolated in that the closest city with equal or greater population is Minneapolis–Saint Paul, Minnesota (metro population of 3,317,308), which is southeast from the city. According to the Census geographic units of Canada, the city has a total area of and an elevation of . The city has a humid continental climate with wide temperature contrasts between winter and summer, and greater precipitation in summer. Mean January temperature is , and mean July temperature is . Average annual precipitation is ; snow falls on 53 days and lies on 132 days in an average year. Winnipeg has three major rivers: the Red River, the Assiniboine River, and the Seine River. The Red River is a Canadian heritage river. Because of Winnipeg's extremely flat topography and substantial snowfall, Winnipeg is subject to severe flooding. The Red River reached its greatest flood height in 1826. The Red River Floodway protects the city from flooding. ==Cityscape== Downtown Winnipeg Portage Avenue According to the 2001 Census, there are 230 neighbourhoods in Winnipeg. Downtown Winnipeg, the city's economic core, is centred on the intersection of Portage Avenue and Main Street (reputed to be one of the windiest in Canada). Downtown Winnipeg covers an area of about one square mile (2.5 km2) and is the fastest growing high-income neighbourhood in the city. More than 72,000 people work downtown, and over 40,000 students attend classes at its universities and colleges. The past few decades have seen downtown undergo major revitalization efforts; since 1999, over C$1.2 billion has been invested. In Winnipeg, there are 10 buildings that stand taller than . The tallest building in the city is the newer 33-storey, 201 Portage. The second tallest building in the city is the Richardson Building, standing at tall with 34 storeys. The Exchange District. Downtown Winnipeg's Exchange District is named after the area's original grain exchange from 1880 to 1913. The 30-block district received National Historic Site of Canada status in 1997; it includes North America's most extensive collection of early 20th-century terracotta and cut stone architecture, 62 of downtown Winnipeg's 86 heritage structures, Stephen Juba Park, and Old Market Square, home to Winnipeg Jazz and Fringe Festivals. Other major downtown areas include The Forks, Central Park, Broadway-Assiniboine and Chinatown. Many of Downtown Winnipeg's major buildings are linked with the Winnipeg Walkway skywalk. Various residential neighbourhoods surround downtown in all directions, but expansion is greatest to the south and west, and has tended to follow the course of the two major rivers. The urbanized area in Winnipeg is about from east to west and from north to south, although several areas remain underdeveloped. The largest park in the city, Assiniboine Park next to the affluent neighbourhood of Tuxedo, houses the Assiniboine Park Zoo and the Leo Mol Sculpture Garden, Other large city parks include Kildonan Park, St. Vital Park, and Fort Whyte Centre. The major commercial areas in the city are Polo Park (West End and St. James), Kildonan Crossing (Transcona and East Kildonan), South St. Vital, Garden City (West Kildonan) and the Corydon strip. Osborne Village Osborne Village is Winnipeg's most densely populated neighbourhood, as well as the second most densely populated neighbourhood in Western Canada.City of Winnipeg Osborne Village neighbourhood Plan http://winnipeg.ca/clkdmis/documents/c/2006/a6621/pd%2009%2019%20no.%2015%20att.pdf It was voted the Best Place to Live in Uptown Magazine's 2008 Best of List. Osborne Village is a complex urban community with a rich heritage and diverse built forms. It’s appreciated as a desirable location in which to live, work, and play. As such, it continues to experience development interest. Popular annual events include the Canada Day Festival. Osborne Village is home to one of Winnipeg's most vibrant collection of stores and restaurants with over 175 businesses calling Osborne Village home. Little Italy is a vibrant Italian district. Located on Corydon Avenue, between Stafford Street in the west, and Pembina Highway in the east it is home to many boutiques and some of the city's finest restaurants and Gelato. Saint Boniface is the centre of much of the Franco-Manitoban community. It features such landmarks as the Cathédrale de Saint Boniface (St. Boniface Cathedral), Boulevard Provencher, the Provencher Bridge, Esplanade Riel, St. Boniface Hospital, the Collège universitaire de Saint-Boniface and the Royal Canadian Mint. It covers the southeast part of the city and has a population of 65,000. ===Roadways and addresses=== The city uses the grid plan but there are several different grids in place, as the city was originally thirteen separate municipalities and each developed under different circumstances and under different rules. Although it is common for roadways running north-south to be called \\"streets\\" and those running east-west to be called \\"avenues\\", the practice is far from universal, and few roadways run in a precise cardinal direction; an \\"east-west\\" road may run at a 45 degree angle from true east-west. Attempts in the early 20th century to bring order to the system by giving numerical names to the streets failed; all roadways in the city have proper names, some of which are repeated. (There is, for instance, a Wellington Crescent in River Heights and a Wellington Avenue in the West End, and a Killarney Avenue in Fort Garry and a Killarney Street in St. Vital.) There is also no universal address numbering system in place. Address numbers usually increase as the distance from either the Red or Assiniboine rivers increases, but this is by no means uniform, even within a specific district. These peculiarities can cause serious problems for newcomers and visitors, especially in the older areas of the city, and may even affect postal and other deliveries. Many of the main thoroughfares in Winnipeg are wide due to the spring soil conditions and the historical use of the Red River ox cart which created wide ruts in the (then) muddy roads. Portage Avenue has four lanes of traffic in each direction plus a central boulevard for much of its run through Winnipeg. Few thoroughfares, however, are as wide as the freeways seen in other Canadian cities (such as the 401 in Toronto or Deerfoot Trail in Calgary). Residential streets are commonly significantly narrower than streets in other Western Canadian cities, so narrow that parking is only possible on one side of the street. ==Climate== Winnipeg lies in the middle of the North American continent on a low-lying, flat plain. Due to its location in the Canadian Prairies, and its distance from both mountains and oceans, it has an extreme humid continental climate (Köppen Dfb, Plant Hardiness Zone 3b-4a), in that there are great differences between summer and winter temperatures. The openness of the prairies leaves Winnipeg exposed to numerous weather systems including blizzards and cold Arctic high pressure systems, known as the polar high. Winnipeg has four distinct seasons, with short transitional periods between winter and summer. The city averages of precipitation per year, although this can vary greatly from year to year. Climate data is also available for downtown Winnipeg, with a weather station located at The Forks. This data demonstrates the urban heat island effect cities have on moderating temperatures compared to airport weather stations. ===Winter=== Curling rink on the Red River at The Forks Typical winter phenomena include the bonspiel (January) thaw, ice fog, and the aurora borealis. The city is virtually assured of having a white Christmas as there is only one 25 December on record in the last century where there was no snow on the ground. Out of Canada's 100 largest cities, Winnipeg's winter is the tenth coldest with an average low of . From December through February the maximum daily temperature exceeds , on average, for only 10 days and the minimum daily temperature falls below on 49 days. ===Summer=== Winnipeg mid- summer climate chart. Summers are typically warm and generally not overly humid, with average humidity levels around 50% from June to August. Occasionally, humidex readings exceed 40. The trees will usually be in full bloom by late May and do not lose their leaves until early October. Winnipeg's growing season lasts from 25 May to 22 September; and temperatures frequently hover in the mid to high twenties Celsius (77F to 86F). The city frequently gets thunderstorms during the summer, averaging 27 per season. The city can occasionally have short blasts of hot weather like on 23 August 2011 the temperature reached . The temperature reaches at or above 14 times a year, which is ranked the 16th highest in Canada, just above Toronto, Ontario. The highest temperature ever recorded in Winnipeg (since commencement of record- keeping in 1873) was on 11 July 1936; and the hottest temperature recorded in the past 50 years was on 6 August 1988 and again on 1 August 1989. The highest humidex reading was 48 on 25 July 2007. ===Spring and autumn=== Assiniboine River walkway near The Forks in fall The weather during these seasons is highly variable, and rapidly changing. For example, temperatures in Winnipeg in April have ranged from to , and in October from to . The city often receives an Indian summer, when summer weather returns briefly after the first frosts, usually in late September or sometimes October. Some Septembers can have gorgeous weather, like in September 2009 Winnipeg only saw 4 days with daytime highs below 20.0C (68.0F) at the Forks weather station. ===Sunshine=== Winnipeg is one of Canada's sunniest cities, and the weather in all seasons is characterized by an abundance of sunshine. In July and August combined, Winnipeg has 60 out of 62 days with measurable sunshine; and has an annual average of 306 days a year with measurable sunshine. November is the least sunny month while July and August are the most sunny months. Winnipeg is ranked second for Canada's clearest skies year-round, sixth sunniest city year-round, and second for sunniest city in Canada in spring and winter. Winnipeg is sunnier in the summer, spring, and winter than any Canadian city east of it. Winnipeg has short daylight hours in the winter and long daylight hours in the summer. On the shortest day of the year (21 December) Winnipeg only has 8 hours and 5 minutes of daylight with the sun setting at 4:29pm and doesn't rise until 8:24am. On 21 June (the longest day of the year) Winnipeg has 16 hours and 21 minutes of daylight with twilight ending at 10:25pm and twilight starting at 4:35am. ===Precipitation=== Winnipeg has moderate precipitation with of precip per year. There is measurable rainfall on 76.9 days throughout the year, and 54.7 days with snowfall. Most of the precipitation occurs in the warmer months, with June being the wettest month and February being the driest. Droughts can take place in the region, however they do not happen as frequently as cities further west like Calgary or Swift Current. During the winter Winnipeg will get precipitation mostly in the form of snow, with 36 days of snow falling from December to February. Even in the winter there is occasional rainfall with 2.5 days on average of rainfall during December to February. Other forms of winter precipitation include ice, sleet, and freezing rain. Snow cover usually lasts from November till March, about 132 days or 36% of the year;. The city frequently gets thunderstorms during the summer, averaging 27 days a year with thunderstorms. ===Wind=== Winnipeg has a reputation for being a windy city with the intersection of Portage and Main being called the windiest intersection in Canada; however, Winnipeg is only the 12th windiest city in Canada, just below Hamilton, Ontario. The average annual wind speed is , predominantly from the south but the city has experienced wind gusts of up to . April is the windiest month, and July the least windy. Tornadoes do occur in the area, particularly in the spring and summer months, however they are not frequent. A Fujita scale F5 tornado struck Elie (just west of Winnipeg) in 2007; this was the strongest tornado ever recorded in Canada. ==Flooding== The Forks during the 2005 flood Because of its flat topography and substantial snowfall, Winnipeg is subject to severe flooding. The Red River reached its greatest flood height in 1826, and this event still remains the highest flood stage of the last two hundred years. Red River Floodway from the air A major flood in 1950 caused a State of Emergency to be declared and the Canadian Army was brought in to protect residents and property. Because of the flood, 100,000 residents were evacuated from their homes and approximately 10,000 homes were destroyed, along with many hospitals, schools and businesses. The flood prompted the Government of Manitoba, under former Premier Dufferin Roblin, to build the Red River Floodway. The floodway is colloquially referred to as Duff's Ditch, and is a long diversion channel that protects Winnipeg from flooding. Construction on the floodway project began 6 October 1962 and cost $63 million. The project resulted in excavation of approximately 76.5 million cubic metres of earth. Completed in March 1968, it has successfully prevented over $10 billion in flood damages. The flood control system prevented flooding in 1974 and 1979 when water levels neared record levels. However, in the 1997 Red River flood, water threatened the city's relatively unprotected southwest corner. Flood control dikes were reinforced and raised using sandbags and the threat was averted. Winnipeg suffered limited damage compared to cities without flood control structures, such as Grand Forks, North Dakota. Other related water diversion projects farther away from Winnipeg include the Portage Diversion (also known as the Assiniboine River Floodway) and the Shellmouth Reservoir. ==Flora and fauna== The great horned owl can be found in Winnipeg. Winnipeg is situated where tall grass prairie meets aspen parkland and is not very far from boreal coniferous forests of the rocky Canadian Shield. The tall grass prairie areas are notable for its endangered western prairie fringed orchid. Some prairie grasses include big bluestem and spear grasses; and wildflowers include aster, goldenrod, prairie crocus and lady's-slipper. Some birds found around Winnipeg include ferruginous and Swainson's hawks; screech and great horned owls; as well as Canada geese and mallards. Winnipeg is also home of the largest remaining mature urban elm forest in North America. Some species of Winnipeg's 8 million trees include elm, ash, maple, oak, poplar, basswood, willow, birch, spruce, pine, cedar, as well as some fruit trees and shrubs. The Red River is the home of a number of species of fish including catfish, goldeye, and walleye. ==LocationNote References == * Winnileg ","title":"Geography and climate of Winnipeg"},{"id":"6205856","text":"Pia Christmas-Møller (born 21 January 1961) is a Danish politician, a member of parliament from 1987 until 2011.

Sharsmith (March 14, 1903 - October 14, 1994) was an American naturalist and Yosemite park ranger, notable for his knowledge and interpretation of the natural history of the Sierra Nevada. He taught botany at various universities, and was the first botanist to comprehensively document the alpine flora of the high Sierra Nevada. __TOC__ ==Biography== Born Karl Wilhelm Schaarschmidt II in New York City to Swiss and German parents, he grew up the U.S., Europe, and Canada. Sharsmith was inspired by the works of naturalist John Muir and became interested in the outdoors and nature. He dropped out of school at 14, but became inspired enough to finish his high school and college education. Sharsmith enrolled in the Yosemite School of Field Natural History in 1930 then was hired as a seasonal Ranger- Naturalist in Tuolumne Meadows, Yosemite National Park the following year. He received his BA from the University of California, Los Angeles in 1933, and his Ph.D. in botany from the University of California, Berkeley in 1940. Sharsmith would work each summer as a Ranger-Naturalist and spend the rest of the year teaching or performing herbarium research. He was said to have explored nearly every \\"nook and cranny\\" of Yosemite's High SierraObituary, New York Times The rest of the year he taught or researched at various schools, that included Stanford University, the University of Minnesota, and San Jose State University. Sharsmith was Professor of Botany at San Jose State from 1950 to 1973. On his opinion of teaching he said, \\"people are not interested in facts. The greater appeal is to the heart.\\" On nature walks, he would often kneel down and talk about a flower. One of his favorite flowers was Raggedy Aster (Aster integrifolius).\\"Carl Sharsmith, 1903-1994\\" Scree 28:4 (April 1995) . Obituary in Peak Climbing Section newsletter, Loma Prieta Chapter, Sierra Club When asked what he would do if he only had a day to see Yosemite he replied, \\"I'd sit by the Merced River and cry.\\" Besides interpreting for visitors, Sharsmith did basic research on the alpine meadows of the High Sierra, gathering thousands of herbarium specimens, and publishing several research papers. Sharsmith's last season as a park ranger-naturalist was during the summer of 1994. At age 91, he was oldest active NPS park ranger in the US at the time. He died at his home in San Jose, California just a few weeks after he completed his final season in uniform at Tuolumne Meadows in Yosemite National Park. ==Personal life== Helen K. Sharsmith, his wife, was a biologist and botanist with a Ph.D. from UC Berkeley. They had a son John, named after John Muir, and a daughter Linnea, named after Carl Linnaeus. Sharsmith and his wife later divorced. His interests included botany, zoology, geology, classical music, Shakespeare, and singing opera. Carl Sharsmith died 1994 in his home at San Jose, California. ==Awards== * National Park Service Meritorious Service Award in 1956, the highest award for an NPS employee * Yosemite Award in 1990, as the first recipient, recognized the \\"rich legacy he has given this park.\\" ==Legacy== * Carl W.

A specialist of aerial warfare, Riccardi frequently worked with senior German naval officers on the defense of the Italian peninsula. ==Early career== Born to Adolph Riccardi and Ifigenia Rasini Di Mortigliengo in Pavia, Italy, (although other sources claim Saluzzo), Riccardi entered the Italian military academy to become a successful career soldier. Seeing action with the Italian marines in the Boxer Rebellion in 1900–1901, the Far East Campaign of 1905, and the First World War, Riccardi was awarded several medals for valor. These medals included the Bronze Medal of Military Valor, China Campaign Medal (1900–1901), Gold Cross for Seniority, War Merit Cross, Medal of War (1915–1918), Unit of Italy memorial medal, inter-allied Victory Medal, among others. ==Interwar years== Heading the Cabinet to the Ministry of Navy from 6 February until 13 May 1925, Riccardi was finally made an admiral on 8 September 1932. Following his admission into the La Spezia (PNF) political party in 1934, he won promotion to vice admiral on 27 December 1935. Riccardi would go on to hold a series of positions including Chief Executive Officer Official of the Case of Navy and Member of the Permanent Commission for the lighting system and signalling of the coasts on 12 August, as well as General Manager of the Staff and the Military Services to the Ministry of Navy on 22 August 1935, before becoming Ministry of Marine Director General of Personnel. ==Second World War== Riccardi's first major engagement took place at the Battle of Taranto, when British carrier-borne torpedo bombers delivered a devastating surprise attack against Italian naval targets in the harbor of Taranto on the night of 11–12 November 1941. Succeeding Admiral Domenico Cavagnari as chief of staff of the Italian Royal Navy (Regia Marina) on 11 December 1940, Riccardi became de facto commander of the existing Ministries for wartime aviation and naval forces. Riccardi did this in addition to his position as the Department of the Navy's Undersecretary of State. Meeting with representatives of the Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine, Riccardi led the Italian Royal Navy delegation, along with Raffaele de Courten, Emilio Brenta, and Carlo Giartosio during the Conference of Merano, from 13 February to 14 February 1941. Riccardi was forced to surrender both positions on 25 July 1943, following the downfall of Italian dictator Benito Mussolini's fascist regime. Under the new Pietro Badoglio administration, Raffaele de Courten officially succeeded Riccardi as Naval Minister and, after 1945, the position came up in the new Ministry of Defense. ==Honours== From the Italian Wikipedia *Commander of the Colonial Order of the Star of Italy (16 July 1936; also appointed Officer on the same date) *Grand Officer of the Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus (28 September 1936; Commander: 15 June 1933; Officer: 1 June 1930; Knight: 6 December 1914) *Grand Cross with the Grand Cordon of the Order of the Crown of Italy (1 February 1940; Grand Officer: 27 October 1934; Commander: 12 November 1925; Officer: 14 December 1919; Knight: 14 December 1911) *Iron Cross (18 January 1943) *Bronze Medal of Military Valor (For China Campaign: 8 September 1904) *Allied Victory Medal (WWI) *Commemorative Medal of the Unity of Italy *Maurizian Medal *Italian War Cross *Gold Cross for Long Service *Commemorative Medal for the China Campaign 1900-1901 *Commemorative Medal for the Italo-Austrian War 1915-1918 ==References== *Parrish, Thomas and S.

It connects State Route 89A in Cottonwood to U.S. Route 180 and U.S. Route 191 in Eagar. The highway begins in Yavapai County before entering Coconino County and then entering Gila County before reentering Coconino County and then entering Navajo and Apache counties, where the highway ends. ==Route description== The western terminus of SR 260 is located at State Route 89A in Cottonwood and heads eastbound along much of the Mogollon Rim, finally ending at its junction with U.S. Route 180 and U.S. Route 191 in Eagar. SR 260 is part of the National Highway System between Show Low and Payson. Stretches of this highway are known by various names, include Camp Verde Bridgeport Highway, General George Crook Trail, Camp Verde-Payson Highway, and White Mountain Road / Boulevard. The northernmost stretch between Cottonwood and Camp Verde was originally State Route 279, while the original stretch of road from Payson to Eagar was originally State Route 160. SR 260 was scheduled in 1995, to be widened and upgraded between Payson and Heber-Overgaard to a four lane divided highway with bridges over wildlife corridors to reduce accidents with deer/elk and other wildlife. The road project has never been completed and is still two lanes over much of the route and is congested at times during holiday weekends with traffic from the Phoenix area to areas along the eastern Rim. Care must be observed due to narrow two lanes and wildlife crossing the road. It is also closed during winter storms because of its elevation changes between Payson and Show Low. ==History== SR 260 was originally designated in 1955 as SR 160 from Payson to Show Low. In 1969, US 160 extended into Arizona so SR 160 was renumbered to SR 260 to avoid confusion. In 1972, it extended east to Eagar, replacing SR 173 and part of SR 73. On December 15, 1989, SR 260 extended west to Cottonwood over SR 279. ==Junction listReferences *SR 260 at Arizona Roads 260 260 260 Category:Transportation in Yavapai County, Arizona Category:Transportation in Coconino County, Arizona Category:Transportation in Gila County, Arizona Category:Transportation in Navajo County, Arizona Category:Transportation in Apache County, Arizona ","title":"Arizona State Route 260"},{"id":"6205968","text":"John Francis (c. 1825 - after 1853) was one of a party of bushrangers who held up the Melbourne Private Escort Company's regular escort of gold from the McIvor diggings at Heathcote, Victoria and Kyneton on the morning of 20 July 1853. At least six men were involved, five of whom including Francis and his brother, George Francis (c. 1825-1853), were apprehended. His brother committed suicide while in custody, but by turning Queen's Evidence, Francis escaped punishment and the other three companions were hanged. ==Early life== John Francis was arrested for pick-pocketing in Sheffield, England on 30 December 1843, convicted and sentenced to ten years' transportation and sent to Hobart Van Diemen's Land (Tasmania) on board the ship Maria Somes, arriving on 30 July 1844. His brother, George Francis, had arrived in Tasmania just three months earlier, having been convicted of stealing bees-wax at Sheffield early in 1843 and sentenced to seven years' transportation, and arriving on the Barossa on 3 May. Both men were convicted under the alias Fearn. In 1847, Francis was arrested as one of a number of men suspected of robbing the premises of Hobart merchant Charles McLachlan, but was released after turning Queens Evidence. Both men travelled to Melbourne during the early part of the Victorian Gold Rush, and married immigrant women in Melbourne during 1852. They counted as friends other former convicts Joseph Grey, George Melville (c. 1822-1853) and George Wilson (c. 1823-1853). ==The Private Escort Robbery== In addition to the official government gold escort a private gold escort operated between many of the Victorian gold fields and Melbourne, being noted for its speed and lower bureaucracy, at the expense of security. Taking advantage of the disorganisation of the Victorian Police Force at the time, on 20 July 1853 a party of bushrangers led by John Grey attacked the escort near Mia Mia as it proceeded from the McIvor goldfield to Kyneton, where it was to meet up with the regular Bendigo escort and continue on to Melbourne. Four of the six guards were shot and injured (two seriously) and the remaining pair fled back to McIvor to seek assistance. Extensive searches found no trace of the criminals, who escaped with gold and cash valued at about £10,000. Of the known bushrangers, the Francis brothers, their wives and Wilson booked passages to England by the Madagascar, Melville and his wife for Mauritius on the barque Collooney and William Atkyns and his wife for Sydney by the steamer Hellespont. On 10 August Melbourne police arrested Francis on board the ship Madagascar, and Wilson on the following day. They arrested George Francis as he was about to go on board the Madagascar on the same day, and he offered to give evidence against all the bushrangers in return for freedom for himself and his brother. After being returned to McIvor to identify four other accused bushrangers, Francis' brother committed suicide by cutting his throat with a razor on the way back to Melbourne on 23 August. Meanwhile, Melville, Wilson and Atkyns had also been arrested in Melbourne, but Grey escaped and was never seen again. Francis turned Queen's Evidence, and the police secured convictions for armed robbery and attempted murder on the other three bushrangers. They were hanged at Old Melbourne Gaol on 3 October 1853. Francis and his wife were given a free passage out of the colony and are believed to have gone to the Cape of Good Hope. At the trial, the escort troops asserted that several more men were involved in the robbery than the six who were identified. According to popular legend they escaped on the Madagascar , which went missing on her voyage for London, and were involved in a mutiny to steal the gold and murder the remainder of the ship's passengers and crew. It appears more likely that the additional men were those arrested on George Francis' evidence but were released after his suicide, and that the ship was lost by natural hazards of the sea. The Escort Robbery became one of the most famous crimes during the Victorian gold rush and is mentioned in many historical and fictional accounts of the period. The techniques used by the robbers were used in practice by many later bushrangers including Ben Hall and Frank Gardiner. ==References== *Blake, Gold Escorts in Australia, Rigby, 1978. *J. O.

The single was released in December 1967, credited to Bill Wyman, with the Stones' \\"The Lantern\\" as the B-side. It peaked at number 87 on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart and at number 62 on the Cash Box Top 100 singles chart, on which it was credited to Bill Wyman. ==Background== The song was recorded on a night when Wyman had shown up at the studio and found that the session had been cancelled. Feeling frustrated that he had potentially wasted time in driving there, engineer Glyn Johns asked him if he had anything that he'd like to record. \\"I'd been messing with this song. It was a bit... what I thought was kind of spacy, you know... a bit kind of Satanic Majesties-like. And psychedelic in a way.\\" Lyrically, Wyman stated that \\"The idea for the song is about this guy who wakes up from a dream and finds himself in another dream.\\" The song describes events that transpire in a dreamlike state: Johns showed the song to Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, and Brian Jones, who all liked it and decided to include it on the record. The musicians on the song are Wyman on lead vocals, with both Ronnie Lane and Steve Marriott of the Small Faces on guitar and backing vocals, Nicky Hopkins on keyboards, Charlie Watts on drums, and Jagger adding backing vocals. At the conclusion of the track as heard on the album, Wyman himself can be heard snoring. He was unaware this had been tagged onto his song until he first played the completed album. He learned later that one night when he had fallen asleep in the studio, Jagger and Richards miked him up and recorded him snoring, and stuck it onto his track as a joke. This does not appear on the single. ==Personnel== The Rolling Stones *Bill Wyman - lead vocals, bass, piano, Hammond organ *Mick Jagger - backing vocals *Keith Richards - acoustic guitar, backing vocals *Brian Jones - Mellotron, sound effects *Charlie Watts - drums Additional musicians *Nicky Hopkins - harpsichord *Ronnie Lane - backing vocals *Steve Marriott - backing vocals ==CitationsReferences== * Category:The Rolling Stones songs Category:1967 singles Category:London Records singles Category:1967 songs Category:Songs written by Bill Wyman ","title":"In Another Land"},{"id":"6206007","text":"Arcadia Planitia is a smooth plain with fresh lava flows and Amazonian volcanic flows on Mars. It was named by Giovanni Schiaparelli in 1882 after the Arcadia region of ancient Greece. It dates from the Amazonian period's Arcadia formation's lava flows and small cinder cones. It includes a more recently developed large region of aeolian materials derived from periglacial processes. It is located northwest of the Tharsis region in the northern lowlands, spanning roughly the region 40-60° North and 150-180° West,A bit tightlier precise, from 33.9°N to 64.2°N and from 165.8°W to 210.4°W. straddling partly in the Cebrenia quadrangle (MC-07), and partly in the Diacria one (MC-02), and centered at . Arcadia marks a transition from the thinly cratered terrain to its north and the very old cratered terrain to the south. On its east it runs into the Alba Mons volcanoes. Its elevation relative to the geodetic datum varies between 0 and -3 km. R. Greeley, \\"Arcadia Planitia\\" URL accessed July 31, 2006. In many low areas of Arcadia, there are grooves and sub-parallel ridges. These indicate movement of near surface materials and are similar to features on earth where near surface materials flow together very slowly as helped by the freezing and thawing of water located between ground layers. This supports the proposition of ground ice in the near surface of Mars in this area. This area represents an area of interest for scientists to investigate further. ==Expanded craters== Large impacts often create swarms of small secondary craters from the debris that is blasted out as a consequence of the impact.http://www.uahirise.org/epo/nuggets/expanded-secondary.pdf Studies of a type of secondary craters, called expanded craters, have given us insights into places where abundant ice may be present in the ground.http://www.uahirise.org/epo/nuggets/expanded-secondary.pdf Expanded craters have lost their rims, this may be because any rim that was once present has collapsed into the crater during expansion or, lost its ice, if composed of ice. Excess ice (ice in addition to what is in the pores of the ground) is widespread throughout the Martian mid-latitudes, especially in Arcadia Planitia. In this region, are many expanded secondary craters that probably form from impacts that destabilize a subsurface layer of excess ice, which subsequently sublimates. With sublimation the ice changes directly from a solid to gaseous form. In the impact, the excess ice is broken up, resulting in an increase in surface area. Ice will sublimate much more if there is more surface area. After the ice disappears into the atmosphere, dry soil material will collapse and cause the crater diameter to become larger.Viola, D., et al. 2014. EXPANDED CRATERS IN ARCADIA PLANITIA: EVIDENCE FOR >20 MYR OLD SUBSURFACE ICE. Eighth International Conference on Mars (2014). 1022pdf. Places on Mars that display expanded craters may indicate where future colonists can find water ice. ESP 028411 2330expandedcraters.jpgClose view of expanded craters, as seen by HiRISE. After the impact, ice left the ground and widened the crater's diameter. ==Gullies== Martian gullies are small, incised networks of narrow channels and their associated downslope sediment deposits, found on the planet of Mars. They are named for their resemblance to terrestrial gullies. First discovered on images from Mars Global Surveyor, they occur on steep slopes, especially on the walls of craters. Usually, each gully has a dendritic alcove at its head, a fan-shaped apron at its base, and a single thread of incised channel linking the two, giving the whole gully an hourglass shape.Malin, M., Edgett, K. 2000. Evidence for recent groundwater seepage and surface runoff on Mars. Science 288, 2330–2335. They are believed to be relatively young because they have few, if any craters. A subclass of gullies is also found cut into the faces of sand dunes which themselves considered to be quite young. On the basis of their form, aspects, positions, and location amongst and apparent interaction with features thought to be rich in water ice, many researchers believed that the processes carving the gullies involve liquid water. However, this remains a topic of active research. The pictures below show gullies in Arcadia Planitia.

He studied at institutions in the United States as well, including Harvard University (John F. Kennedy School of Government). In the last years of the 20th century, he became Head of the Planning Directorate in the Armed Forces Headquarters of Indonesia. After the resignation of Suharto, Wirahadikusumah emerged as a reformer in the ranks of the armed forces. By 1998, he was, as a Major General, posted at Armed Forces Headquarters where he held the position of staff officer on the Armed Forces' Commander's Staff in charge of political affairs and security. In the same year, he called for the Indonesian military to stop their involvement in political affairs and for the army to become a professional defence force instead. In January 1999, Major-General Agus Wirahadikusumah, who by now was Chief of the Army Staff and Command School, became the Assistant for General Planning to the Armed Forces Commander. In 2000, President Abdurrahman Wahid appointed him Commander of the Strategic Reserve Forces Kostrad. He served in this position from 29 March 2000 to 1 August 2000. Wirahadikusumah supported Wahid's decisions, including that of dismissing General Wiranto as security minister. Wiranto referred to him as a \\"bad apple\\". While Wirahadikusumah was popular with ordinary soldiers, he also created enemies for himself, as he took up the fight against corruption within Kostrad. As a consequence of these activities, he was dismissed from his post as Commander of Kostrad in summer 2000. However, according to Umar Wirahadikusumah, his uncle, the post of Chief of the Indonesian Military (TNI) had been offered to Agus Wirahadikusumah on 23 July 2001. On 30 August 2001, Wirahadikusumah was brought into Pertamina hospital in South Jakarta at 06:19. A hospital employee stated that he was already dead when he was brought in, that the cause of death was unknown and that no autopsy had been conducted. According to The Jakarta Post, the probable cause of death was heart failure. However, some people alleged that he might have been assassinated,Rachland Nashidik Interview in Radio Nederland due to his reformist stance and for uncovering 189 billion rupiah corruption scandal in Yayasan Dharma Putra Kostrad, a military owned charity organization. His body then buried in Kalibata Heroes Cemetery, Jakarta. == Sports Associations == Apart from military affairs, Wirahadikusumah was also interested in sports and was Deputy Chairman of the Badminton Association of Indonesia. In this function he was instrumental in the 1998 plan to bring about meetings between former Indonesian Badminton champions (such as Tan Joe Hok) and their successors to share their experiences and make them better prepared for upcoming tournaments. In 1998, he was Manager of the Indonesian Thomas Cup team which won the Cup that year. Wirahadikusumah was awarded the Satya Kebudayaan Medal for this achievement by the Indonesian President Habibie on 9 September 1998. == Family == Wirahadikusumah is a nephew of Umar Wirahadikusumah, a former Vice President of Indonesia and also a former Kostrad Commander. Agus Wirahadikusumah married to Tri Rachmaningish. They had two children: a son, Yunan Mahastra Satria (born 22 June 1977) and a daughter, Diyah Gustinar Savitri (born 14 July 1975). == Notes References== * \\"Vocal Reformist Indonesian General Dies\\", AFP, 30 August 2001 * \\"An officer and a reformer\\", The Australian, 13 September 2001 * \\"Outspoken army general dies of heart failure\\", The Jakarta Post, 31 August 2001 * \\"Outspoken Indonesian military reformer dies, age 49\\", Associated Press, Chris Brummit, 30 August 2001 * \\"Badminton body asks advice from former champions\\", The Jakarta Post, 18 March 1998 * \\"Indonesian Thomas Cup Team wins 1st place in Group\\", Antara, 20 May 1998 * \\"Govt honors Thomas Cup team\\", The Jakarta Post, 10 September 1998 * \\"Sugiono gets promotion in major reshuffle\\", The Jakarta Post, 5 January 1999 Category:1951 births Category:People from Bandung Category:John F.

After winning the European Junior Championship in 1973, he became an International Master the same year. In 1974, Romanishin was a member of the victorious USSR team at the World Student Team Championship held in Teesside, England, where he scored the best result for board 4 (8/9). The following year, he had a terrific result at the USSR Championship, sharing second place with Boris Gulko, Mikhail Tal and Rafael Vaganian, after Tigran Petrosian. In 1976, his Grandmaster title was ratified. Romanishin has an impressive collection of tournament victories, including Odessa 1974, Novi Sad 1975, Yerevan 1976, Hastings 1976/77, Leningrad 1977 (shared with Tal), Gausdal 1979, Polanica Zdroj 1980, Lviv 1981 (shared with Tal), Jurmala 1983, Moscow 1985, Reggio Emilia 1986 (shared with Andersson and Ljubojević) and Debrecen 1990. Playing the Hungarian Open Championship at Györ in 1990 he finished two points ahead of the field. Second place finishes at Tilburg 1979 (after Karpov) and Dortmund 1982 (after Hort) were also important landmarks in his career, as was his third equal finish at Sochi in 1982. Nowadays less active as a tournament player, Romanishin has nevertheless won smaller events on the grandmaster circuit, such as Solin- Split 2004 and Hotel Petra (Rome) 2005. At the Olympiads he represented the Soviet Union in 1978 and thereafter played for Ukraine through the 1990s, winning a total of 2 silver medals and 2 bronze. At the European Team Chess Championships his medal haul has amounted to an incredible 6 gold and 1 silver. His chess playing style has been described as aggressive and this may be a result of the coaching he received as a junior. Along with a group of other aspiring masters, he was first coached by Viktor Kart (an instructor of the Lviv Sports Academy) and then, as an improver, was assigned a senior master as a tutor/mentor. In his case the master was Mikhail Tal, an ex-world champion noted for his attacking chess. In respect of chess opening theory, he has a reputation for the use of rare, offbeat and sometimes, long since discarded systems. Only by means of deep research and accurate preparation has he been able to employ these openings as weapons to sidestep known theory and fight for the full point. One example is 4.g3 in the Nimzo-Indian Defence. Previously known in the 1930s and revived by Romanishin in the 1970s, the variation now carries his name in opening manuals. The newly popular variations arising from an early Be7 in the French Defence, were also pioneered by him (and Australian postal IM John Kellner) in the 1970s and have been further refined by the likes of Morozevich and Short in more recent practice. ==References== * * *Olimpbase – Olympiads and other Team event information ==External links== * *Interview with Oleg Romanishin Category:1952 births Category:Living people Category:Chess grandmasters Category:Chess theoreticians Category:Chess Olympiad competitors Category:Ukrainian chess players Category:Soviet chess players Category:Sportspeople from Lviv ","title":"Oleg Romanishin"},{"id":"6206047","text":"Henry John Cambie Henry John Cambie (October 25, 1836 in Tipperary, Ireland – April 23, 1928 in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada) was a Canadian surveyor, civil engineer, and a notable figure in the completion of that country's transcontinental railway. He was also a notable pioneer resident of Vancouver. Cambie was educated in England, and emigrated to the Province of Canada as a youth, where he learned to be a surveyor. In 1852, he found employment with the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway, moving to the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) seven years later. With the Confederation of Canada in 1867, the CPR was contracted to build a transcontinental railway, which would link the new country and the adjacent colonies and territories of British North America. With the expansion of the railway into British Columbia, Cambie found himself as the chief surveyor for the CPR in the province. In this capacity, Cambie argued for a route through the Fraser Canyon, terminating at the small logging community of Granville on Burrard Inlet. He was convinced of the superiority of this route over the alternatives of Howe Sound and Bute Inlet after a trip down the canyon to Granville in 1874. Cambie's views prevailed, and in 1876, he was made chief surveyor of the CPR's Pacific Division, a position he would hold for the next four years, following which he was promoted to chief engineer. His work completed, in 1887 Cambie settled in Vancouver, which had been incorporated as the successor to Granville the previous year. As he recalled in a later interview: ::In May 1887, much to the amusement of my friends, I went out into the country and purchased two lots at the corner of Georgia and Thurlow streets. I could not, however, induce the city to clear a track so I could reach my property until near the end of that year, when I at once started building and moved out there in 1888. I had to lay the first sidewalk on Georgia at my own expense, as the city would not do it, and when I got the telephone the company dunned me for more than a year to pay for the poles from Granville Street down to my place, as they told me that no one else in that generation would ever go to live west of Granville Street.Early Resident Had to Lay Sidewalk at His Own Expense , Vancouver Courier, March 31, 2006 The area of which Cambie spoke is now located near the centre of downtown Vancouver, in one of the most densely populated neighbourhoods in the country, and the site of Cambie's home is now the location of Vancouver's tallest building, the Living Shangri-La. Cambie was a prominent citizen of the nascent city, and was an important advocate for the development of its infrastructure. He was also instrumental in building Christ Church Cathedral, the major Anglican church in downtown Vancouver, where he was a key figure for over forty years (a memorial plaque commemorating him can be found inside the church). In this and other developments, Cambie's connections with the CPR -- and especially, its president, William Van Horne -- were crucial to his success, since the company owned much of the land around Vancouver. Cambie remained employed by the CPR, only retiring in 1921. Cambie died in Vancouver in 1928 at the age of 91. ==Legacy== The following are named for Cambie: *Cambie Street - a major thoroughfare in Vancouver, ** the Cambie Street Bridge * Cambie Road, a major east–west thoroughfare in Richmond, British Columbia. *H.J.

Although primarily remembered as the eldest brother and mentor of Tecumseh, who became famous after Cheeseekau's death, Cheeseekau was a well-known leader in his own time, and a contemporary of Blue Jacket. Few details are known about Cheeseekau's early life. He may have been born along the Tallapoosa River in what is now Alabama. His parents, Puckeshinwa and Methoataaskee, moved north to the Ohio Country around the time of his birth. After Pukeshinwa's death in the Battle of Point Pleasant in 1774, Cheeseekau assumed much of the responsibility for his younger brothers, including Tecumseh and Tenskwatawa. During the American Revolutionary War (1775–1783), Cheeseekau joined with those Shawnees who allied themselves with the British and sought to drive the American settlers out of Kentucky. After the war, as Americans expanded into Ohio, in 1788 Cheeseekau led a group of Shawnees to Missouri. American colonists were moving to Missouri too, and so Cheeseekau instead resettled his band at the village of Running Water on the Tennessee River.

The mausoleum dates from 1637, and is located in Shahdara Bagh in Lahore, Punjab, Pakistan, along the banks of the Ravi River.Wiki Loves Monuments: Top 10 pictures from Pakistan are here! The site is famous for its interiors that are extensively embellished with frescoes and marble, and its exterior that is richly decorated with pietra dura. The tomb, along with the adjacent Akbari Sarai and the Tomb of Asif Khan, are part of an ensemble currently on the tentative list for UNESCO World Heritage status. ==Location== The tomb is located in Shahdara Bagh, northwest of the Walled City of Lahore. The tomb is located across the River Ravi from Lahore, in what was a rural area known for its numerous pleasure gardens. The tomb in located in Nur Jahan's pleasure garden, the Dilkusha Garden, that had been laid out in 1557. The Tomb of Asif Khan, built in 1645, and the Akbari Sarai, built in 1637, are located immediately west of Jahangir's tomb complex, and the three form an ensemble oriented on an east–west axis. The last of the Shahdara Bagh monuments, the tomb of Jahangir's wife Nur Jahan is located slight southwest of Asif Khan's tomb. ==Background== Much of the mausoleum's interior is adorned with Mughal-era frescoes. The tomb was built for Emperor Jahangir, who ruled the Mughal Empire from 1605 to 1627 C.E.. The emperor died in the foothills of Kashmir near the town of Rajauri on 28 October 1627. A funeral procession transferred his body from Kashmir and arrived in Lahore on Friday, 12 November 1627. The Dilkusha Garden in which he was buried was a \\"favourite spot\\" of Jahangir and his wife Nur Jahan, when they lived in Lahore. His son, the new Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan, ordered that a \\"mausoleum befitting an Emperor\\" should be built in his father's honour to inter his remains. ==History== Emperor Jahangir forbade the construction of a dome over his tomb Though contemporary historians attribute construction of the tomb to Jahangir's son Shah Jahan, the tomb may have been the result of Nur Jahan's vision. Taking inspiration from her father's burial place, she is said to have designed the mausoleum in 1627, and possibly helped fund it. Construction started in 1627, requiring ten years for completion, and cost Rs 10 Lakh. Repair works were undertaken at the tomb in 1814 according to Sikh court records. The tomb complex, however, was also desecrated under Sikh rule when they were pillaged by the army of Ranjit Singh, with building materials used for decoration of the Golden Temple in Amritsar. The pillaged grounds were then converted for use as a private residence for an officer in the army of Ranjit Singh, Señor Oms, who was also known as Musa Sahib. Ranjit Singh further desecrated the mausoleum once more when he ordered that Musa Sahib be buried on the tomb's grounds after dying from cholera in 1828. By 1880, a rumour had begun circulating which alleged that the tomb once was topped by a dome or second storey that was stolen by Ranjit Singh's army, though no evidence has been found to suggest that a dome or second story ever existed at the tomb. The Shahdara ensemble of monuments suffered further under British rule, when a railway line was built between the tombs of Asif Khan and Nur Jahan. The site was then repaired by the British between 1889-1890. Flooding from the nearby River Ravi threatened or damaged the site in 1867, 1947, 1950, 1954, 1955, 1957, 1958, 1959, 1962, 1966, 1973, 1976, 1988, and 2010. The site sustained water damage during flooding in 1988 that covered much of the site in 10 feet of water for 5 days. ==Architecture== The use of minarets reflects a renewed interest in Timurid architecture during the reign of Jahangir. The walls of the tomb are inlaid with carved marble. The tomb was constructed in a Mughal style influenced by Safavid-style architecture from Persia, which may have been introduced into the Mughal Court by Nur Jahan \\\\- who was of Persian origin. The mausoleum is laid out as a takhtgah - or a mausoleum built upon a podium which serves as a takht, or \\"throne.\\" For except, there is no takhtgah on the podium, nor seemingly had ever been built. Similar to the tomb of Akbar, Jahangir’s tomb lacks a central dome as the Emperor is reported to have expressly forbade the construction of a dome over his tomb. The use of domes in Mughal funerary architecture was first used at the Tomb of Humayun, and re- established by Shah Jahan. ===Exterior=== Arcades surround the tomb and feature ghalib kari, or ribs inlaid into arched surfaces on the arch's curved areas In keeping with Sunni religious tradition, Jahangir's great grandfather Babur chose to be buried in a tomb open to the sky at the Gardens of Babur. Jahangir's tomb broke with this tradition by including a roof. In order to forge a compromise with Sunni tradition, Jahangir expressly forbade the construction of a dome over his tomb, and so the roof is simple and free from architectural embellishments which later featured prominently at the Taj Mahal. The mausoleum's façade is embellished with red sandstone inlaid with marble motifs. The square-shaped mausoleum is a 22 foot tall, single-story plinth with arcades lining all four sides of the structure. Vaulted bays along the perimeter of the tomb reflect Timurid architectural styles from Central Asia. The mausoleum's façade of red sandstone is inlaid with motifs forged of white marble. From the building rise four octagonal ornamental minarets projecting from each corner of the building, decorated with geometric inlaid stone. The use of minarets, absent from early Mughal commissions, reflects a renewed interest in Timurid architecture from Central Asia during the reign of Jahangir. The minarets are divided into three sections, with the tomb forming the base, upon which the body of the minaret rests, called by white marble cupolas. The minarets rise to a height of 100 feet (30m). ===Interior=== The burial chamber contains the Emperor's cenotaph. The mausoleum building is divided into a series of vaulted compartments which are richly embellished with Mughal buon fresco. Carved jali screens admit light in various patterns facing toward Mecca. === Cenotaph === At the centre of the mausoleum is an octagonal chamber lined with carved marble in which the remains of the Mughal Emperor rest in a crypt below a cenotaph. The interior of the tomb features a white-marble cenotaph inlaid with pietra dura in vegetal patterns, as well as the 99 Names of Allah, a common theme in Islamic mysticism. ===Gardens=== The tomb's gardens are laid out in the Persian Chahar Bagh style. The gardens surrounding the tomb are vast, and laid out in the Persian Chahar Bagh, or Paradise garden. The garden is separated into four squares by paved walkways (khiyabans) and two bisecting central water channels which are designed to reflect the four rivers that flow in jannat, the Islamic concept of paradise. Each of the four squares is further divided into smaller squares with pathways, creating into 16 squares in all. The garden forms a quadrangle measuring approximately 500 metres on each side. ==Layout== The mausoleum is set in a large quadrangle with gates facing each of the cardinal directions. Entry to the quadrangle is via the western edge through the Akbari Sarai - a gate featuring a small mosque. To the immediate west of the Akbari Sarai is the Tomb of Asif Khan - Jahangir's brother-in-law. == Conservation == The site is protected by the Federal Antiquities Act 1975, though stipulations of the law are frequently neglected, resulting in damage to the site and surrounding area. The act forbids construction within 200 feet of the site, though private homes have been built that are located a few metres from the boundary walls of the site. The site was inscribed on the tentative list for UNESCO World Heritage Site status in 1993. ==Numismatics and philately== The tomb was featured on the 1000 Rupee note until 2005.

He graduated from St. Johnsbury Academy and received his Artium Baccalaureus degree from Dartmouth College in 1922. He attended Harvard Law School and then moved to Washington, D.C. to accept a position with the federal Commissioner of Immigration while continuing his studies at George Washington University Law School. He read law and passed the bar exam in 1926 needing to complete one course before graduating. He then ended his studies and began to practice, first in Washington, D.C. and later in St. Johnsbury, Vermont, from 1926 to 1955. ==Legal career== Active in Republican politics, he was State's Attorney for Caledonia County, Vermont from 1933 to 1937 and Assistant Secretary of the Vermont Senate from 1933 to 1940. He served as general counsel of the Vermont Unemployment Compensation Commission for four years, a delegate to the 1936 Republican National Convention, a member of the commission to investigate the Vermont Court System from 1935 to 1937, and a member of the Vermont Uniform State Laws Commission from 1938 to 1958. In the 1930s and 1940s Waterman was a founder and leader of the Vermont Young Republicans, and was recognized as a leader of the progressive wing of Vermont's Republican party, which included George Aiken and Ernest W. Gibson Jr. (Gibson and Waterman had attended law school together, and Gibson was Secretary of the Vermont Senate when Waterman was Assistant Secretary.) Waterman managed Aiken's successful 1936 campaign for governor, and in 1946 was an unsuccessful candidate for the United States Senate, losing the Republican primary to Ralph E. Flanders, who went on to win the general election. As a member of the Uniform State Laws Commission, during the 1940s and early 1950s, Waterman was an author and promoter of the Uniform Commercial Code, which was adopted in 1952. From 1957 to 1958, Waterman served as president of the Vermont Bar Association. He was president of the American Judicature Society from 1962 to 1964. ==Federal judicial service== Waterman was nominated by President Dwight D. Eisenhower on May 13, 1955, to a seat on the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit vacated by Judge Harrie B. Chase. Vermont's Senators, Aiken and Flanders, had initially been willing to recommend Gibson, but Gibson preferred to remain on the United States District Court for the District of Vermont so that he would not have to leave Vermont. They then recommended Waterman, who was opposed by conservative Republicans, which caused Eisenhower to request that they submit another recommendation. Aiken and Flanders persisted until Waterman was confirmed. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on July 11, 1955, and received his commission on July 13, 1955. He assumed senior status on November 13, 1970, and took inactive senior status in 1983. His service was terminated on February 6, 1984, due to his death. Among the law clerks Waterman employed during his judicial career was William B. Gray, who later served as United States Attorney for Vermont. ===Notable cases=== Once confirmed, Waterman authored or assisted in authoring more than 600 judicial opinions. Waterman's opinions included the one that upheld the prosecution and sentencing of Soviet spy Rudolf Abel. He also wrote the opinion that reaffirmed the order for a special New York legislative election in 1965, which the state Court of Appeals had canceled. ==Other activities== Waterman was a longtime trustee of both St. Johnsbury Academy and Vermont Law School, and served as president of the board at each institution. ==Belated law degree== In 1977, Waterman received his Juris Doctor from Vermont Law School, which was conferred after the trustees, faculty and administration agreed that his writings while serving as a judge satisfied the requirements for the course he had not completed before passing the bar exam. ==Death and burial== Waterman died in St. Johnsbury on February 6, 1984, and was buried at Mount Pleasant Cemetery in St. Johnsbury. ==Awards and honors== Waterman received several honorary degrees, including: Dartmouth College (LL.D., 1963); Harvard Law School (LL.D., 1969); George Washington University Law School (LL.D., 1969); University of Vermont (LL.D., 1972); and New York University School of Law (LL.D., 1979). His personal and official papers are archived at the University of Vermont. Vermont Law School maintains a scholarship and lecture series in Waterman's name, and the school's Waterman Hall is named for him. ==Family== In 1932, Waterman married Frances Knight (1906–1975). They were the parents of two sons, Robert and Thomas. ==References* Sterry R.

The decision to use the name the Starry Plough was inspired by a newspaper produced by Official Sinn Féin in Derry City in the early 1970s.

The suggestion for the IRSP newspaper was made by Derry members to the IRSP Ard Comhairle in early 1975. The Irish translation An Camchéachta was provided by Mairin Bean Ui Chionnaith, an Irish-language scholar and republican. The first edition of the new (IRSP) The Starry Plough was published in April 1975 under the editorship of Mick Ahern. It included details of the first IRSP public meeting (Dublin, 12 February), an editorial on the IRSP, an interview with Seamus Costello, Easter Rising commemoration notices and a statement from the National Executive of the IRSP.

Playhour was intended as a companion to Jack and Jill, initially aimed at a slightly older audience. The lead strip in its early days was \\"Prince, the Wonder Dog of the Golden West\\", drawn by Sep E. Scott. With issue 32 (21 May 1955) it lowered its target age-group and introduced comic strips based on A. A. Milne's Winnie-the-Pooh and Kenneth Grahame's The Wind in the Willows, both drawn by Peter Woolcock. 1956 saw the arrival of \\"Sonny and Sally of Happy Valley\\", two children (and their pet lamb) who were to be associated with the title until its demise in 1987; Sonny and Sally wrote the weekly editorial letter and children writing to the editorial address (Cosy Corner, The Fleetway House, Farringdon Street, London E.C.4 — the address of the publisher, Amalgamated Press) would receive replies signed by Sonny and Sally. The stories of Sonny and Sally (drawn by Hugh McNeill) were initially related in rhyming couplets, as were a number of other early stories, although by the end of the 1970s the stories were written in normal prose form. Others were told in captions below the illustration, or text comics, as Playhour avoided the use of word balloons.

They were a member of the American Hockey League (AHL) from 1971 to 1974. ==History== The early 1970s saw an unprecedented boom in the popularity of hockey in the greater Boston area, fueled by the success of the Bobby Orr and Phil Esposito-led Boston Bruins. The Bruins had sold out all of their home games at the Boston Garden for years, and the team owners thought that placing their minor-league affiliate in the same arena made sense on several levels. Previously, the Bruins' top affiliates were the Hershey Bears of the AHL and the Oklahoma City Blazers of the Central Hockey League. The team was named after the eponymous National League baseball team that had played in Boston until 1953 — which had been owned by Charles F. Adams, founder of the Bruins, during the 1930s. The first season of the AHL Braves, under coach Bep Guidolin, was wildly successful. Behind a powerful club led by future NHL stars Dan Bouchard and Rich Leduc, and with other veteran minor- leaguers and future NHL players such as Doug Roberts, Terry O'Reilly, Ross Brooks, Nick Beverley, Garry Peters and Don Tannahill, the club tied for first place in its division with the powerful Nova Scotia Voyageurs with a 41-21-14 mark, while proving popular enough in Boston to set league records for single- game and single-season attendance that survived for decades. In its second season, however, competition from the New England Whalers of the World Hockey Association (WHA) served to saturate the market. Furthermore, NHL expansion cost the team its best player, Bouchard, who had been picked by the Atlanta Flames, while WHA defections caused the recall of Brooks to the parent club and the departure of Roberts and Peters to the rival league. While scoring declined only slightly, the defense was notably poorer. The team still finished second in the division with a 34-29-13 mark, but attendance had nearly halved. In the Braves' third and final season, the defense collapsed to the point where the team finished out of the playoffs after a 23-40-13 record. With attendance dwindling further and the ebbing of the hockey boom itself in New England, Bruins' management decided to suspend the team; the next season saw the Bruins affiliating with the Rochester Americans (whose coach and general manager, Don Cherry, had just become the Bruins' head coach.) The Bruins maintained the franchise's existence for many years, paying a nominal fee to the league to keep it dormant, finally selling its rights to the Winnipeg Jets in 1987 so that the Jets could move it to the Maritimes to become the Moncton Hawks. ==Team records== ;Single season * Goals: Ron Anderson, 41, 1973 * Assists: Doug Gibson, 51, 1974 * Points: Gibson, 82, 1974 * Penalty minutes: Fred O'Donnell, 161, 1972 ;Career * Career games: Neil Murphy, 214 * Career goals: Bob Gryp, 68 * Career assists: Rich Leduc, 80 * Career points: Leduc, 144 * Career penalty minutes: Leduc, 227 ==Season-by- season results== ;Regular season {  style=\\"text- align:center\\" - !Season!!

It chronicles the adventures of Olivia Joules (birth name Rachel Pixley), a freelance journalist with an \\"overactive imagination\\". After meeting the handsome Pierre Feramo, Olivia immediately comes to the conclusion that he is a terrorist and follows him around the world to confirm her suspicions whilst falling for another man. ==Plot== Olivia Jules, a journalist for the British Sunday Times newspaper and Elan magazine is in Miami to cover the launch of a face cream when she meets Pierre Feramo, who she finds attractive, but also suspicious. While Olivia is in Miami, a cruise ship docks in the harbor. When Olivia is passing the cruise ship on the way to meet Feramo, a terrorist bomb blows the ship up. Olivia helps to rescue survivors but hundreds are killed. Soon afterwards, in Los Angeles, Olivia meets Feramo again, working on a movie. Olivia calls the FBI with her suspicions about Feramo, but is interrupted. She also has her room swept for bugs and finds one. Feramo invites Olivia to his house in LA. There she finds a secret room. Frame and Olivia take a helicopter to an island off the California coast. Feramo admits he is a muslim but tells Olivia he didn’t bug her. He invites her scuba diving in Honduras. Instead of going straight to Feramo’s resort, Olivia makes her own way to Honduras. She meets the local divers including one called Morton, who she is also attracted to. Olivia becomes more suspicious of Feramo because of the rumours about his resort. Feramo then tricks Olivia into coming to his resort. She bluffs her way out, and returns to London. In London, Olivia meets Morton again, who reveals himself as a CIA agent working with MI6. They’re investigating Feramo and recruit Olivia to go to Sudan to discover what his plan is. When she gets to Sudan, Olivia discovers she has been betrayed. Feramo's associates plan to kill her, but using MI6 gadgets, she escapes, photographing Feramo’s plans on the way. Feramo chases her, but Morton arrives, punches Feramo and rescues her. Feramo is then eaten by a shark. Olivia is worried that Feramo's movie was a cover for a terror attack on The Oscars. She realises the Oscar statues are bombs and races to save the ceremony. Morton collects the statues, and eventually Olivia manages to subdue the bomber. The statues then explode harmlessly. Olivia and Morton become lovers, and Olivia becomes a permanent MI6 agent. ==Inspiration== In an interview with BBC News, Helen Fielding was inspired for this book by the way the world responded to the September 11 attacks. She once spent some time in the Sudan as a journalist and loved her time there. In light of the invasion of Iraq, Fielding wondered why they had not sent a female spy in to interview the perpetrator. She felt that women have an air of innocence around them that men lack. Olivia parallels James Bond in many ways and Fielding was very fond of Ian Fleming's novels. ==References== Category:Thriller novels Category:2004 British novels Category:Novels by Helen Fielding Category:Novels set in London Category:Novels set in Miami Category:Novels set in Los Angeles Category:Novels set in Honduras Category:Novels set in Sudan ","title":"Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination"},{"id":"6206258","text":"The Ronnie Wood Band toured England and Ireland during 2001 and 2002.

It ran during the winter season only. It covered on the Pennsylvania Railroad from New York City to Washington, D.C., the Richmond, Fredericksburg and Potomac Railroad from Washington to Richmond, and the Seaboard Air Line Railroad from Richmond via Raleigh, Columbia, and Savannah to Miami. A section also went to Tampa and St. Petersburg. The train started on November 21, 1925 and was the brainchild of SAL president S. Davies Warfield, who wanted to capitalize on booming development in Florida at the time. Warfield believed Florida was a land of opportunity, and with fast, luxurious trains he could lure influential (not to mention wealthy) business leaders to the Sunshine State. In February 1926 the train took 35 hours to run from New York to West Palm Beach (Seaboard track did not reach Miami until 1927). Spurred by the success of Henry Flagler and his rival Florida East Coast Railway in attracting travelers, the Orange Blossom Special became famous in its own right. It was renowned for its speed and luxury. E. M. Frimbo, \\"The World's Greatest Railway Buff\\", offered this account of a dining car chef who had worked aboard the train: The service was suspended during World War II to free the equipment up for carrying troops. Its last run was in 1953. This west Florida market is now handled by Amtrak's Silver Star. In early 2012, a similar locomotive painted to resemble a locomotive of the time, and lettered Orange Blossom Special was moved in from its long-time display location at the Church Street Station in Orlando, Florida to the Gulf Coast Railway Museum in nearby Tampa. Plans are for a multi-year restoration to active status for eventual excursion service. == The train and the song == Arrival of the Orange Blossom Special, December 1938 in Plant City, Florida. It happened during the maiden run of the new streamlined train at the Jacksonville Seaboard Railroad Station that Ervin T. Rouse and Robert Russell \\"Chubby\\" Wise saw this train. Rouse and Wise wrote the \\"Orange Blossom Special\\" song as a fiddle tune. The tune was first recorded by Ervin and his brother Gordon one year later in New York. Bill Monroe recorded Rouse's and Wise's tune in 1942 (with Art Wooten on fiddle) and popularized the tune. Johnny Cash named his 1965 album after the song. The song was also recorded by Bill Ramsey and Don Paulin. This popular tale explains the fascination which led Ervin Rouse and Robert \\"Chubby\\" Wise to write the now famous fiddle tune. However, historically the Blossom was never \\"streamlined\\" and used Pullman heavyweight sleepers, diners, and some coaches of the winter Tampa run. The Blossom may have used some lightweight cars sporadically in mixed consist with the Pennsylvania Railroad which hauled the Blossom in the Northeast Corridor. If Rouse and Wise did see a streamlined Seaboard train in 1938, it was most likely the Silver Meteor which was streamlined with its stainless steel coaches. The name of this train was chosen by a public contest. The Seaboard's lightweight trains later became known as the Silver Fleet. This included the Silver Meteor, the Silver Star and the Silver Comet. The train did receive modern EMC E4 diesel locomotives in 1938, but continued using heavyweight Pullmans and American Flyer coaches until its demise in 1953. It is also possible the songwriters saw one of the Twin Cities Zephyrs at the Jacksonville railroad station in 1935. The Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad brought the train to Florida at the invitation of the Seaboard Railroad. It toured the state, making stops in both east and west coast Florida cities, where the public was able to both view and tour the Zephyr; Jacksonville was one of the stops on its Florida tour. ==ReferencesFurther reading== * * == External links == * Shrady, Theodore and Waldrop, Arthur M.: Orange Blossom Special: The Story of Florida's Distinguished Winter Train.

It is a translator of ABC affiliate KGTV (channel 10) which is owned by the E. W. Scripps Company. KZSD-LD's transmitter is located on San Miguel Mountain southeast of Spring Valley; its parent station maintains studios on Air Way in the Riverview-Webster section of San Diego. As a stand-alone analog station affiliated with Azteca América and later MeTV, KZSD's broadcasting radius only covered northern and eastern parts of the city of San Diego and some adjacent suburbs (such as Poway and El Cajon).https://www.fcc.gov/media/radio/map-display#appid=660198&call;=KZSD- LP&contour;=74&city;=SAN%20DIEGO&state;=CA&fileno;=BLTTL-20030507AAF&.map Therefore, the station was simulcast in widescreen standard definition over KGTV's second digital subchannel in order to reach the entire market. The unusual numbering for the mapped subchannel in the past as channel 10.15 was in order to align it with KZSD's former cable placement on Cox Communications channel 15 (PBS member station KPBS-TV, which broadcasts on UHF channel 15 over the air, is instead carried on cable channel 11). Once XHDTV-TDT2 (later XHAS-TDT) assumed the Azteca América affiliation, the station lost the channel 15 cable slot, but regained its spot on May 1, 2017 on Cox channel 808, when it assumed the MeTV affiliation in San Diego. KZSD-LP was converted to digital in 2018 as a KGTV translator, allowing homes with issues receiving KGTV's VHF signal or only a UHF antenna to receive KGTV in some form. ==History== KZSD- LP's logo under its affiliation with Azteca. The station was initially granted a construction permit by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) on September 25, 1997, and its license was issued on September 13, 2000. In 2003, the station changed its call letters to KZDF-LP and became an Azteca América affiliate. San Diego is one of four markets to receive programming from both the U.S.-based Azteca América network and Mexico-based TV Azteca channels that preceded the American network's launch (Del Rio, El Paso and Laredo, Texas are the others). Much of KZSD's Azteca programming can also be seen on TV Azteca- owned XHTIT-TDT (channel 7) or XHJK-TDT (channel 13), sometimes simultaneously with the U.S. network's broadcasts. McGraw-Hill Broadcasting purchased KZDF-LP from Laurie Mintz in 2005 and changed its call letters to KZSD-LP. On October 3, 2011, McGraw-Hill announced that it would sell KZSD, along with its other television stations, to the E. W. Scripps Company as part of its exit from broadcasting. The deal was completed on December 30, 2011. On March 6, 2017, Azteca América announced that it would move its San Diego affiliation from KZSD-LP to a subchannel of XHDTV-TDT on March 15, 2017, and to XHAS-TDT on July 1. A channel map shuffle that day saw Laff moved onto the re-numbered 10.3 from channel 10.2, which was converted to a loop of the latest KGTV newscast to air. On May 1, 2017, Scripps took control of the MeTV affiliation on 10.2, along with its already-existing cable channel positions in the market, replacing KFMB-DT2 (which began carrying The CW in the market on May 31); MeTV also replaced Laff on KZSD-LP. The affiliation (which by contractual force requires it to reside only on a .1 or .2 subchannel) was sold by KFMB owner Midwest Television to Scripps in order to facilitate the change. ==Digital channels== The station's digital signal is multiplexed: {  - !

Often there is a nationwide network with agreements with various local towing and other emergency road service providers. *Provision of maps, or other tourist or motoring information in some cases, to members. *In some cases, reward stickers or decals may be provided to the member to place in the window of his/her vehicle, offering a reward to someone who locates or reports the vehicle if stolen. *Sometimes certain services related to vehicles, such as transferring ownership, may be provided to members at a reduced cost. *Some businesses, such as motels, may provide members of certain motor clubs with discounts upon presentation of their membership cards. ==Motor clubsAfrica=== *Automobile Association of South Africa ===Asia=== Japan *Japan Automobile Federation ===Australia and New Zealand=== *Australian Automobile Association **National Roads and Motorists' Association (NRMA) – New South Wales and Australian Capital Territory **Royal Automobile Club of Western Australia (RAC WA) – Western Australia **Royal Automobile Club of Tasmania (RACT) – Tasmania **Royal Automobile Club of Queensland (RACQ) – Queensland **Royal Automobile Club of Victoria (RACV) – Victoria **Royal Automobile Association (RAA) – South Australia **Automobile Association of the Northern Territory (AANT) – Northern Territory *New Zealand Automobile Association (NZAA) ===Europe=== Austria *ÖAMTC *ARBÖ Bosnia and Herzegovina *BIHAMK Croatia *HAK Germany *ADAC (Allgemeiner Deutscher Automobilclub) Netherlands *ANWB UK *Civil Service Motoring Association *RAC *The Automobile Association ===North America=== *Advantage Auto Club *Allstate Motor Club *American Automobile Association *Better World Club *Canadian Automobile Association *DRIVE Roadside *Good Sam RV Emergency Road Service *Hiway Angels *RV Roadservice Online *Shell Motorist Club ==See also== *Car club *Automobile industry *Vehicle insurance *Effects of the automobile on societies *Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile ==References== Category:Emergency road services ","title":"Automobile associations"},{"id":"6206344","text":"Gordon Timothy Bray AM (born 23 June 1949) is an Australian sports commentator and sports journalist.

Wood's version appeared on I've Got My Own Album to Do, his debut solo album, and Harrison's on Dark Horse. Their only official songwriting collaboration, \\"Far East Man\\" is an affirmation of friendship in the face of life's obstacles and musically reflects the two guitarists' adoption of the soul genre. Written mostly by Harrison, the composition has been interpreted as a restatement of the humanitarian message expressed in his 1971 single \\"Bangla Desh\\", and a tribute to Indian musician Ravi Shankar. The song originated during a period of romantic intrigue surrounding Harrison's marriage to Pattie Boyd and Wood's to his wife Krissie, which culminated in Boyd leaving Harrison for his and Wood's mutual friend Eric Clapton. Wood recorded \\"Far East Man\\" in July 1974 at The Wick, his Surrey home that had also become an established meeting place for many leading rock musicians. Harrison sang and played slide guitar on this version, while other contributors included Wood's Faces bandmate Ian MacLagan, Mick Taylor of the Rolling Stones, and drummer Andy Newmark. The Harrison recording took place at his Friar Park studio and features backing from Billy Preston, Tom Scott, Willie Weeks and Newmark, all of whom then played on his 1974 North American tour with Shankar. Opening with a spoken dedication to Frank Sinatra, the Dark Horse recording was marred by Harrison's damaged singing voice – a result of his rushing to complete the album's vocal parts in Los Angeles, while simultaneously rehearsing for the tour. Several commentators have singled out \\"Far East Man\\" as a highlight of Harrison's 1974 album. While noting the two composers' troubled private lives during the song's creation, author Simon Leng describes it as \\"a wistful shrug of the shoulders set to music\\". In 2002, Wood released a concert DVD titled Far East Man, which included a live version of the track. Recorded in December 2001, two weeks after Harrison's death from cancer, this performance features special guests Andrea Corr and Slash. ==Background== The Wick, in Richmond, Surrey Author Robert Rodriguez has written of \\"an informal musical round robin\\" existing in England during the early 1970s among rock music's \\"elite\\".Rodriguez, p. 234. From 1972 onwards, guitarist Ronnie Wood's home in Richmond, Surrey – The Wick – was the preferred location for these get- togethers, at which the participants included ex-Beatle George Harrison, Wood's Faces bandmates, and members of the Rolling Stones. Situated over a bend on the River Thames, and formerly the home of actor John Mills and novelist Mary Hayley Bell,Wood, pp. 96–97. The Wick was also where rehearsals took place for Eric Clapton's comeback concerts at the Rainbow Theatre in January 1973.Townshend, pp. 243–44. These concerts featured Wood in the role of second guitaristTownshend, p. 243. and were organised by Pete Townshend of the Who, in an effort to pull Clapton out of his heroin-induced seclusion.The New Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock & Roll, p. 183.Wood, p. 104. Harrison and his wife Pattie Boyd attended the Rainbow shows, on 13 January,Badman, p. 89. and became friends with Wood and his wife, Krissie.Wood, pp. 105, 106. Musically during this period, Harrison and Wood participated in Alvin Lee's recording of \\"So Sad\\",Castleman & Podrazik, pp. 129, 206–07. a Harrison composition reflecting the failure of his marriage to Boyd.Harrison, p. 240.Clayson, p. 320. In October 1973, the Woods stayed at Friar Park, Harrison's estate in Oxfordshire, where he and Wood recorded together.Badman, p. 109. They also began writing the song \\"Far East Man\\",Madinger & Easter, p. 444. about which Harrison says in his 1980 autobiography, I, Me, Mine: \\"We stumbled on it and other things ...\\"Harrison, p. 292. Beatles biographer Peter Doggett describes Friar Park as having become \\"a haven of adventurous intrigue\\" at this point,Doggett, pp. 208–09. with Harrison conducting an affair with Maureen Starkey, the wife of his former bandmate Ringo Starr,O'Dell, pp. 258–59, 263–65.Tillery, p. 93. and Clapton urging Boyd to leave her husband for him.Townshend, pp. 265–66. During their stay at Friar Park, Wood began an affair with Boyd and the couple flew to the Bahamas,Clayson, p. 329. while Harrison and Krissie Wood holidayed together in Portugal.Wood, pp. 106, 147.Doggett, p. 209. These details were kept from the press, but in late November 1973, Wood issued a statement from The Wick confirming: \\"My romance with Patti Boyd is definitely on.\\"Badman, p. 113. Given these developments, Rodriguez notes the irony in \\"Far East Man\\" being \\"a rumination on letting a friend down\\".Rodriguez, p. 235. ==Composition== The song began as an instrumental collaboration, which Harrison then finished alone.Spizer, pp. 264–65. In I, Me, Mine, Harrison says that he and Wood came up with the melody to the verses together, but that, at Wood's request, he later turned it into a song by writing the words and adding a middle eight. Harrison biographer Simon Leng describes the chord sequence as \\"a grin-making exploration of major and minor sevenths that oozes smoochy soul\\".Leng, p. 156. In the first verse, Harrison states:Harrison, p. 294. Author Ian Inglis interprets \\"Far East Man\\" as being about Indian sitar maestro Ravi Shankar,Inglis, p. 47. for whom Harrison had staged the Concert for Bangladesh in August 1971.Tillery, pp. 95–97.The Editors of Rolling Stone, p. 136. Three years later, with the new nation of Bangladesh still beset by problems, and conflict clouding the issue of friendship generally for Harrison, Inglis suggests that \\"this is one friendship [Harrison] is determined to preserve\\". The choruses therefore promise: \\"I won't let him down ... I won't let him drown ...\\" Harrison later credited Shankar with being \\"probably the person who has influenced my life the most\\", since \\"Indian music was like a stepping- stone to the spiritual path\\".Book accompanying Collaborations box set by Ravi Shankar and George Harrison (Dark Horse Records, 2010; produced by Olivia Harrison), p. 11.Michael Simmons, \\"Cry for a Shadow\\", Mojo, November 2011, p. 79. Inglis views the song as reflecting Harrison's commitment to \\"all the things that India has given him\\".Inglis, p. 48. Leng identifies \\"Far East Man\\" as a \\"hopeful song\\", where, despite his confusion, Harrison's \\"answer is to follow his instinct, his heart\\". Leng sums up the conclusion that Harrison provides in the middle eight's final line, \\"Can only do what it tells me\\": \\"He surveys the problems of love, social strife, and disconnection from spiritual values, but decides that taking his own advice is a good enough start.\\" While echoing this interpretation, theologian Dale Allison also highlights Harrison's \\"humanitarian impulse, his regrets about the world's current state, [and] his faint utopian hope for something better\\" as being evident in the lyrics to \\"Far East Man\\".Allison, pp. 15, 141. Allison likens the song to Harrison's 1971 compositions \\"Bangla Desh\\" and \\"The Day the World Gets 'Round\\", and suggests that in the choruses to \\"Far East Man\\", Harrison is stating \\"his determination to help impoverished and oppressed peoples half a world away\\".Allison, pp. 69–70. As reproduced in his autobiography, Harrison's original lyrics for the final verse included lines that he would change before recording his version of the song.Harrison, pp. 293–94. The rewritten verse allows for an outlook that Allison describes as \\"a melioristic hope ... that people might be able to make the world a truly better place\\":Allison, p. 73. According to his recollection in I, Me, Mine, Harrison wrote much of the lyrics to \\"Far East Man\\" while driving to The Wick to record the song. The title came about because the Faces had just returned from a tour of the Far East and Wood was wearing a T-shirt that carried the slogan Far East Man, a play on the phrase \\"far out, man\\". ==Ronnie Wood's versionRecording=== In Ronnie, his 2007 autobiography, Wood writes that The Wick was \\"a hive of recording activity as well as a thriving debauchery camp\\" during the year-long creation of his first solo release, I've Got My Own Album to Do (1974).Wood, pp. 101, 108. The album title originated from contributors such as Harrison and Mick Jagger \\"nagging me to let them go home\\" and work on their own projects.Wood, p. 99. Wood assisted Jagger in writing and recording the Rolling Stones' 1974 single \\"It's Only Rock 'n Roll\\" during this period,Bockris, pp. 176–77. and he similarly reciprocated Harrison, by playing on the former Beatle's Christmas single, \\"Ding Dong, Ding Dong\\". The session for \\"Far East Man\\" took place at Wood's home studio in June 1974,Spizer, p. 264. during the same month that Boyd left Harrison and joined Clapton on tour in America.Tillery, p. 94. Harrison biographers note the significance of this session, since it introduced him to the rhythm section he subsequently used on his North American tour with Shankar – bassist Willie Weeks and drummer Andy Newmark.Leng, pp. 156–57. According to the musician credits, Weeks did not play on this particular song, however. Wood (left) and Rod Stewart performing with the Faces in 1975 The recording was produced by Wood and Gary Kellgren,Castleman & Podrazik, p. 201. the co-owner of New York's Record Plant studios,Wood, p. 100. and whose work in taping the Concert for Bangladesh shows at Madison Square Garden had impressed Harrison.Madinger & Easter, pp. 435, 436. Rodriguez describes the musical arrangement on the song as \\"a slow soul groove\\" and views Wood's version as \\"more Harrisonian\\" than Harrison's later reading.Rodriguez, pp. 234–35. The other musicians on the track were Rolling Stones lead guitarist Mick Taylor, playing bass; Newmark; Wood's fellow Face Ian MacLagan, on electric piano; and Jean Roussel, Cat Stevens' regular keyboard player, on organ. Harrison's slide guitar and harmony vocals are prominent in the mix, yet he received a credit only for his songwriting contribution on early editions of the album.Bud Scoppa, \\"Ronnie Wood I've Got My Own Album To Do\\", Rolling Stone, 7 November 1974; available at Rock's Backpages (subscription required; retrieved 4 April 2014).\\"Inner sleeve credits\\", I've Got My Own Album to Do LP (Warner Bros. Records, 1974; produced by Ron Wood & Gary Kellgren). While discussing the track in 2012 on Sky Arts HD's The Ronnie Wood Show, Wood recalled Harrison teaching him the vocal parts for \\"eighteen hours\\", but Harrison's own singing contribution had to be kept to a minimum in order to satisfy the requirements of \\"his publishers\\".\\"George Harrison and 'Far East Man'\\", The Ronnie Wood Show, episode 4, Sky Arts HD, 2012. ===Release=== Warner Bros. Records released I've Got My Own Album to Do in September 1974,Castleman & Podrazik, p. 113. with \\"Far East Man\\" appearing as the second track, following Wood's collaboration with Jagger,Wood, pp. 99–100. \\"I Can Feel the Fire\\".Stephen Thomas Erlewine, \\"Ron Wood I've Got My Own Album to Do\\", AllMusic (retrieved 4 April 2014). With additional contributions from Keith Richards and Faces vocalist Rod Stewart, the album was well received critically.Bockris, pp. 177, 178. Like Harrison,Leng, pp. 195–96. Wood continued to incorporate soul music in his solo recordings, working with former Valentino Bobby Womack on his follow-up album, Now Look (1975).Bonanno, p. 138.Wood, pp. 182, 184. By the time of that album's release, Wood had replaced Taylor in the Rolling Stones,Barbara Charone, \\"'Now Read' Ronnie Wood\\", Sounds, 26 July 1975; available at Rock's Backpages (subscription required; retrieved 4 April 2014). leading to Stewart announcing the break-up of the Faces in December 1975.Wood, p. 136.Bonanno, pp. 138, 143. Although Wood and Harrison never officially co-wrote another song after \\"Far East Man\\", their friendship continued, with Wood announcing in 1996 that he and Harrison were recording together.Badman, pp. 537, 554. The song appears on Wood's career-spanning compilation Anthology: The Essential Crossexion, released in 2006. In their respective reviews for the websites AllMusic and musicOMH, Thom Jurek and Barnaby Smith each identify \\"Far East Man\\" as a highlight of the two-disc set.Thom Jurek, \\"Ron Wood Ronne Wood Anthology: The Essential Crossexion\\", AllMusic (retrieved 21 December 2014).Barnaby Smith, \\"Ronnie Wood – Anthology: The Essential Collection\\", musicOMH, 22 June 2006 (retrieved 21 December 2014). ==George Harrison's versionRecording=== The song was the first of many Harrison recordings to feature bassist Willie Weeks (pictured in 2007). Harrison taped the basic track for his version of \\"Far East Man\\" at Friar Park over August and September 1974, during sessions for his album Dark Horse.Leng, p. 147. Having \\"brushed up the lyrics a bit\\", as he puts it in I, Me, Mine, Harrison retained Newmark and Weeks from the sessions with Wood, and brought in keyboard player Billy Preston and saxophonist and arranger Tom Scott,Spizer, p. 265. both of whom would also be part of his all-American tour band.Leng, p. 167. Leng describes \\"Far East Man\\" as \\"the first Harisong to tap into 1970s soul\\" and notes the \\"supreme soul credentials\\" of Newmark, as the former drummer with Sly and the Family Stone, and Weeks, who had supplied the highly regarded basslines on Donny Hathaway Live (1972).Leng, pp. 156, 157. Newmark later recalled of his and Weeks' first sessions for Harrison: \\"We were completely thrilled to be asked to play on his record … It was the most exciting thing to happen to me. I had to keep pinching myself to remember it was real.\\"Leng, p. 157. At the start of the song, Harrison delivers a spoken dedication to Frank Sinatra,Huntley, p. 111. adding: \\"we love you, Frank, and we hope you include this one at Caesars Palace on your next live album.\\" This message referred to Sinatra's adoption of the Harrison composition \\"Something\\", which he lauded as \\"the greatest love song of the past fifty years\\".Clayson, p. 283.The Editors of Rolling Stone, p. 178. On \\"Far East Man\\", Inglis finds Scott's multiple horn parts \\"reminiscent of the soul stylings\\" of King Curtis, Junior Walker and the Funk Brothers. Unlike on the Wood recording, Harrison's slide guitar appears only midway through the Dark Horse version (overdubbed onto his rhythm guitar part),Spizer, pp. 264, 265. in a solo that author Elliot Huntley describes as \\"wonderfully complement[ed]\\" by Scott's \\"bachelor-pad saxophones\\".Huntley, pp. 111–12. Harrison's commitment to his other projects – such as starting up a new record label, Dark Horse Records,Doggett, p. 224. and organising Shankar's European revue, the Music Festival from IndiaLavezzoli, p. 195. – affected progress on the album.The Editors of Rolling Stone, p. 44.Huntley, pp. 106–07. According to authors Chip Madinger and Mark Easter, Harrison had to overdub much of his vocals while in Los Angeles for tour rehearsals, in October.Madinger & Easter, p. 442. Combined with his having to sing during the rehearsals, the overexertion damaged Harrison's voice,Rodriguez, pp. 198–99. compromising his performance on songs such as \\"Far East Man\\".Madinger & Easter, pp. 442, 443. His throat condition worsened during the subsequent tour,Tillery, p. 114. earning Harrison highly unfavourable concert reviews from a number of critics, who objected also to the substantial stage-time afforded Shankar's ensemble.Rodriguez, pp. 58–59. ===Release=== Dark Horse was released on Apple Records on 9 December 1974 in the United States,Castleman & Podrazik, p. 144. towards the end of the Harrison–Shankar tour.Madinger & Easter, p. 443. Harrison sequenced \\"Far East Man\\" as the penultimate track, between \\"Dark Horse\\", the album's lead single in the US,Spizer, pp. 259, 263. and the pop-bhajan \\"It Is 'He' (Jai Sri Krishna)\\".Leng, pp. 155–57. Given Harrison's marital problems, and the generally unfavourable reception given to his tour and album, author Gary Tillery describes his new relationship with Olivia Arias as \\"[t]he one bright spot in the problematic year\\".Tillery, p. 115. Having met Arias in Los Angeles in October,Olivia Harrison's foreword, in George Harrison, p. 1. Harrison used a photo of her on the face label for side two of the Dark Horse LP.Spizer, pp. 265, 268. Writing in 1981, NME critic Bob Woffinden viewed the inclusion of this image, combined with the more upbeat message of side-two songs such as \\"Ding Dong\\" and \\"Far East Man\\", as Harrison ushering in Arias, his future wife, and farewelling Boyd.Woffinden, pp. 84–85. ===Reception=== Along with Jim Miller's opinions in Rolling Stone magazine,Leng, p. 174. Woffinden's 1974 album review for the NME was one of the most scathing critiques.Clayson, p. 342.John Harris, \\"Beware of Darkness\\", Mojo, November 2011, p. 82. Woffinden bemoaned how on Dark Horse, \\"the radiant light of George's spirituality is planted firmly under a bushel and darkness is not confined to equine matters\\". He then wrote of the song: \\"['Far East Man'] seems to have most chance of independent survival, especially as the song turned up in quite pleasant shape on Wood's I've Got My Own Album To Do, but here again the production effectively smothers it, and Harrison's drab vocals complete the assassination.\\"Bob Woffinden, \\"George Harrison: Dark Horse\\", NME, 21 December 1974; available at Rock's Backpages (subscription required; retrieved 22 November 2013). By contrast, Michael Gross of Circus Raves magazine viewed the album as the equal of Harrison's acclaimed All Things Must Pass (1970) and praised the song and its arrangement, writing: \\"Scott again excels on 'Far East Man', with a horn solo that would vindicate any context in which it was put.\\"Michael Gross, \\"George Harrison: How Dark Horse Whipped Up a Winning Tour\\", CIrcus Raves, March 1975; available at Rock's Backpages (subscription required; retrieved 8 October 2013). In a similarly positive assessment for Melody Maker, Brian Harrigan opined that Dark Horse \\"should certainly do a tremendous amount to salvage George's battered reputation\\" but found the extended playout to \\"Far East Man\\" overlong – an example, he said, where \\"you can have just too much of a good thing\\".Brian Harrigan, \\"Harrison: Eastern Promise\\", Melody Maker, 21 December 1974, p. 36. Among more recent commentators, Simon Leng considers \\"Far East Man\\" to be among Harrison's best compositions and \\"one of its writer's most beguiling pieces\\",Leng, pp. 156, 159. while AllMusic's Richard Ginell describes it as \\"exquisite\\".Richard S. Ginell, \\"George Harrison Dark Horse\\", AllMusic (retrieved 5 April 2014). Leng praises the \\"especially attractive\\" middle eight and views the track as \\"a musical acceptance of life as an unfathomable riddle … a wistful shrug of the shoulders set to music\\".Leng, p. 156. Ian Inglis identifies \\"a lovely melodic passage\\" in the first line of the choruses, which he regrets \\"is never fully developed elsewhere\\", and compares the song favourably with Marvin Gaye's 1971 album What's Going On. In an April 2004 article in Blender magazine, Paul Du Noyer deemed \\"Far East Man\\" to be the \\"standout track\\" on an album that displayed an \\"uncharacteristic spell of rock star excess\\" on Harrison's part.Paul Du Noyer, \\"Back Catalogue: George Harrison\\", Blender, April 2004, pp. 152–53. Reviewing the 2014 reissue of Harrison's Apple catalogue, for Mojo, Tom Doyle describes the song as \\"the excellently smooth Steely Dan-ish Far East Man\\".Tom Doyle, \\"Hari Styles: George Harrison The Apple Years1968–1975\\", Mojo, November 2014, p. 109. Joe Marchese of The Second Disc writes of the \\"impeccable\\" musicianship found throughout Dark Horse and adds: \\"There are many stellar moments, such as 'Far East Man,' with Scott contributing his trademark jazz-rock saxophone on a deliciously fab slice of 'yacht rock.'\\"Joe Marchese, \\"Review: The George Harrison Remasters – 'The Apple Years 1968–1975'\\", The Second Disc, 23 September 2014 (retrieved 29 September 2014). Blogcritics' Chaz Lipp similarly finds \\"a lot of rewarding listening\\" on Dark Horse, and highlights the track as \\"a smooth soul collaboration with Ron Wood that, once heard, lodges itself in the brain\\".Chaz Lipp, \\"Music Review: George Harrison’s Apple Albums Remastered\\", Blogcritics, 5 October 2014 (retrieved 6 October 2014). In his review of the 2014 reissues, for Record Collector, Oregano Rathbone cites \\"Far East Man\\" as an example of how each of Harrison's Apple albums post-All Things Must Pass \\"contains shivery moments of release\\".Oregano Rathbone, \\"George Harrison – The Apple Years 1968–75\\", Record Collector, December 2014 (retrieved 4 December 2014). ==Other versions== Before leaving for Los Angeles in October 1974, Harrison performed a portion of \\"Far East Man\\" during an interview with BBC Radio's Alan Freeman.Badman, p. 138. Harrison began playing the song, on acoustic guitar, in reply to Freeman asking whether he had felt let down by friends in the past.\\"That's Entertainment\\", Contra Band Music, 10 October 2012 (retrieved 8 October 2013).\\"Interview with George Harrison\\", Rock Around the World, program 61, 5 October 1975. The interview was broadcast in the UK on Rockspeak, in December, but delayed until September 1975 in America, where it formed part of Freeman's syndicated show Rock Around the World.Madinger & Easter, p. 445. Along with Harrison's performances of \\"Dark Horse\\", \\"Awaiting on You All\\" and \\"I Don't Care Anymore\\", this recording is available only on bootleg compilations. Following his troubled tour with Shankar, Harrison's only other tour as a solo artist took place in December 1991,Lavezzoli, p. 196. when he and Clapton performed a series of well- received concerts in Japan.Doggett, p. 305.

In a 17-year professional career in the English Football League he played as a striker and scored 131 goals in 529 league and cup appearances. Born in Liverpool, he started his career with Port Vale in 2000, and made over 150 appearances in his six years with the club, being voted Player of the Year in 2005. He was sold to Hull City in January 2006, before moving on to Southend United eight months later. His career stalled, and following a loan spell with Bradford City, he moved on to Swindon Town in August 2007. Averaging more than a goal every three games with the club, he transferred to Leeds United in June 2010. He joined Brighton & Hove Albion on loan in October 2011, before taking a free transfer to Doncaster Rovers in August 2012. He helped Rovers to win the League One title in 2012–13. He was loaned out to Sheffield United in January 2014. He signed with Carlisle United in June 2014, moving on to Hartlepool United twelve months later. He dropped into non-league football for a brief spell with Warrington Town in November 2017. He moved into coaching after retiring as a player and has coached at the academies at Everton, RIASA and Port Vale. ==CareerPort Vale=== He started his career at Port Vale after being scouted in his native Liverpool at the age of ten. He signed professional forms in 2000, and manager Brian Horton gave Paynter his debut against Walsall at Vale Park on 3 May 2001. At only 16 years and 294 days old, this made him the youngest Vale player for twenty years. Horton went on to give the young striker seven further Second Division games in the 2001–02 season. He scored his first senior goal past Notts County on 17 September 2002, making him the club's youngest goalscorer for 24 years. By the end of the season he had scored five goals in 34 appearances. Still a teenager during the 2003–04 season, he hit 14 goals in 48 games despite being played mostly on the right-wing, leaving him second in the club's scoring charts behind the prolific Stephen McPhee. He was rewarded with a long-term contract at the season's end. He opened the 2004–05 season by being sent off for over celebrating after scoring Vale's first goal in a 3–2 defeat at Walsall on 7 August; he went on to criticize referee Lee Probert for ruining the game with the red card decision. He went on to end the campaign as the club's top-scorer with thirteen goals in fifty games; this came despite criticism from some supporters for a mini-goal drought in mid-season. In March, manager Martin Foyle dismissed rumours of Paynter moving to nearby Crewe Alexandra. At the end of the season, fans voted Paynter as the club's Player of the Year. He started the 2005–06 season with just two goals in sixteen League One games, but had still done enough in his Port Vale career to justify a move into Championship football. The club reported Tony Pulis' Plymouth Argyle to The Football Association for an alleged illegal approach for the player, but accepted a bid from Hull City. ===Hull City=== In November 2005, Hull City manager Peter Taylor signed Paynter on loan, then later negotiated a permanent transfer for an initial fee of £150,000 in the January transfer window. Teammate Sam Collins also moved to Hull at the same time. Again, Paynter mainly played as a striker, but also made some appearances as a right midfielder. He scored three times in his 23 appearances, before moving on again at the end of the season. ===Southend=== Paynter joined Southend United on a three-year contract on 7 August 2006 for an undisclosed fee, although he actually joined the Shrimpers a few days earlier on loan, to enable him to play in their match against Stoke City. Paynter scored his first and what turned out to be only Southend goal in a 3–2 League Cup victory over Brighton, but lost his place in the first team due to a lack of goals. Paynter's stay at Southend was brief, interrupted by a hamstring injury, and on the last day of the January transfer window of the 2006–07 season he was loaned out to Bradford City for a month, having made just eleven appearances for Southend. Paynter made his debut for Bradford City against Nottingham Forest on 3 February 2007, scoring a last minute equaliser to earn the Bantams a 2–2 draw. He played fifteen times for Bradford, scoring four goals, after his loan was extended to the end of the season. ===Swindon Town=== In August 2007, Paynter signed for Swindon Town on transfer deadline day on a three-year contract. He made his debut on 9 September, coming on as a substitute in a televised defeat against Yeovil. He hit a hat-trick against Bournemouth in September 2007, and followed this up with a double against Gillingham in a 5–0 win in early October 2007. In one week in January 2008 he scored a goal and an own goal in an FA Cup replay with Barnet, before he was sent off in a League One game with Crewe Alexandara. Paynter made 42 league starts in the following 2008–09 season for Swindon, scoring eleven goals and providing vital support for the league's joint top-scorer Simon Cox. Cox was sold to West Bromwich Albion in summer 2009, and Paynter was given a more prominent role in attack as a result of his departure. He netted fifteen goals in a seventeen match run from the end of November through to April. Paynter was named as the League One Player of the Month for January – an award he was also nominated for again in March – and at this point Paynter also entered negotiations over a new contract with Swindon. On 3 April 2010, Paynter scored a brace for Swindon in their 3–0 rout of Leeds United at Elland Road – the win gave Swindon some hope of achieving automatic promotion. He had also previously scored twice against Leeds that season in a 3–0 win at the County Ground. Swindon reached the League One play- offs, and won their play-off semi final after beating Charlton Athletic on penalties – Paynter had missed the first leg through injury, but returned for the second leg which saw Swindon edge into the final at Wembley. He overcame a slight injury doubt and managed to play from the start in Swindon's 1–0 defeat to Millwall, with Paynter being substituted late on in the second half. During the 2009–10 season Paynter also managed to form a formidable strike partnership with fellow striker Charlie Austin, as the pair scored a total of 49 goals between them. In total Paynter scored 29 goals for Swindon during the 2009–10 season, representing his best goal scoring ratio in a single season. ===Leeds United=== In June 2010, after turning down a new deal at Swindon Town, Paynter accepted a three-year deal with newly promoted Leeds United. In late July however, it was reported that Paynter would be ruled out for two- months after suffering a stress fracture of the shin that he had picked up during Leeds' pre season schedule. The injury ruled him out of the rest of the pre-season, with manager Simon Grayson suggesting that the club could not provide and timescales on Paynter's recovery from injury. Paynter finally returned to training at the start of September, and played 90 minutes in a 'behind-closed-doors' friendly, however Paynter later suffered a reaction to his injury, keeping him out of action longer than had been expected. Having finally returned to fitness and having appeared for Leeds' reserve team, Paynter finally made his first-team debut on 10 October 2010, as a second-half substitute in a 4–1 defeat of Scunthorpe United. Paynter eventually scored his first goal for Leeds in a 2–1 win at Preston North End on 8 March. Paynter had a disappointing first season with Leeds, scoring just once in 23 games, and was linked with a move to Yorkshire rivals Sheffield United during the following the summer. Having remained at Leeds despite interest from elsewhere, Paynter came on as a substitute for Leeds on the opening day of the 2011–12 season as they suffered a 3–1 defeat against Southampton. Paynter was unable to establish himself in the Leeds first team however, as he picked up another injury, sidelining him for a further spell. At the end of August, Paynter was given permission to speak with Brighton & Hove Albion regarding a move to the club. However decided to stay at Leeds and fight for his place in the team. With Luciano Becchio returning from injury and the signing of Mikael Forssell, Paynter's playing opportunities diminished further, and manager Simon Grayson hinted that he would allow Paynter to go out on loan. Having not played since the opening day of the season for Leeds, in October 2011 reports circulated that several Championship clubs were interested in taking Paynter on loan. but Leeds insisted they would not loan him to a rival club in the same division, and were currently considering an offer from an unnamed League One side. On 27 October 2011, Paynter signed for Brighton & Hove Albion on loan until the start of January 2012. He made his debut for the club on 29 October, as a second-half substitute against Birmingham City. He played a total of ten games for Brighton without scoring before he returned to Elland Road. Paynter finally made his first start of the season for Leeds, and his first start under new manager Neil Warnock in mid April 2012, coming into the side against Peterborough United, scoring twice in a 4–1 home win. He was given a second consecutive start in the following game against Blackpool, however he picked up an Achilles injury in the game which ended his season prematurely. Neil Warnock subsequently placed Paynter on the transfer list at the end of the 2011–12 season. Doncaster Rovers boss Dean Saunders was strongly linked with a move for the striker at the end of July. However Paynter instead joined Blackpool for a week-long trial. The trial was cut short after a few days, and he began training with Doncaster Rovers. When Leeds issued their squad numbers for the 2012–13 season on 3 August, it was revealed that Paynter, previously the club's number nine, had not been allocated a number. ===Doncaster Rovers=== Following a trial spell, Paynter completed a free transfer to League One side Doncaster Rovers on 13 August 2012, signing a two-year contract. Paynter scored 13 goals in 40 games during the 2012–13 campaign, and on the last day of the season he provided the pass to James Coppinger which was converted for the late winning goal over Brentford that won Doncaster promotion to the Championship as champions of League One. On 10 January 2014, Paynter signed for Sheffield United on loan. He spent most of his time on the bench as Nigel Clough chose to use Jose Baxter as a false number nine in a highly successful run that took the club up the table and into the semi-finals of the FA Cup. played 13 games for the \\"Blades\\" in the second half of the 2013–14 campaign, without scoring a goal. He was released by Doncaster manager Paul Dickov in May 2014. ===Carlisle United=== Paynter signed a two-year contract with newly relegated League Two club Carlisle United in June 2014. It was reported that he decided to reject higher paid offers from clubs in higher divisions in join the \\"Cumbrians\\" after being convinced to come to Brunton Park by manager Graham Kavanagh. However Carlisle struggled during the 2014–15 season, and after being fined by new manager Keith Curle for refusing to take part in extra training sessions put on for players not in the first team, both Paynter and Gary Dicker took representation from the Professional Footballers' Association to dispute the legality of their fines. He was transfer listed by Curle in May 2015. ===Hartlepool United=== Paynter had his contract with Carlisle United cancelled by mutual consent and joined League Two rivals Hartlepool United on 27 June 2015. He was appointed as club captain by manager Ronnie Moore. He made his debut in the 2–0 win over Morecambe in the first game of the 2015–16 season, scoring the opening goal and providing an assist for Rakish Bingham. Three days later, Paynter scored in his second game to help Hartlepool beat Fleetwood Town 1–0 in the first round of the League Cup. His total of 15 goals in 35 appearances in the 2015–16 season made him the club's top-scorer and caused new manager Craig Hignett to exercise a contract clause to keep Paynter at the club for another year. He was out injured in January with an Achilles problem, and underwent surgery to correct the issue two months later. Hartlepool were relegated into non-league at the end of the 2016–17 season, and Paynter admitted that he did not know what manager Dave Jones had been doing with his tactics. Paynter was one of three men – along with Stuart Parnaby and Ian Gallagher – tasked with assisting caretaker-manager Matthew Bates for the final two games of the season, which ended in a defeat and a victory, but ultimately relegation. Paynter was released in May 2017. ===Warrington Town=== On 26 November 2017, Paynter signed with Northern Premier League Premier Division club Warrington Town. He had previously been training with AFC Fylde and Southport. However he announced his retirement from football the following month.Hartlepool United FC at Twitter‚ twitter.com, 11 December 2017 Billy Paynter at Footballdatabase‚ footballdatabase.eu ==International career== Paynter played for a Football League England U21 team (selected and managed by Peter Taylor) in a game against an Under-21 Italy squad containing players from Serie B side's, a match which took place at the KC Stadium in February 2006.

He started 41st and ended up finishing there, after his brakes failed early. ==Craftsman Truck Series== Small made his CTS debut in 2000, running at Mesa Marin. That race he started 20th in the truck owned by Walker Evans, but struggled to a 28th-place finish. He then switched to Green Light Racing, where he competed one race for the team at O'Reilly Raceway Park with a 25th-place result. Small started three races then for Sonntag Racing in 2001. His best run for the team came in his debut with them, where he started 19th and finished 25th at Homestead-Miami. Small then moved onto a family owned team for two late races in the year. He earned his then best career run at Phoenix, when he came home 19th. Small reunited with Green Light Racing in 2002 and his runs with the team earned him 21st in the points as he competed in all the races. Immediately, Small started out with a 9th place in the season opener at Daytona. Small, though, would only earn one more top-ten on the year: a 10th at Las Vegas. Small's meager 22nd in points could largely be blamed to inconsistency. Small did not finish seven races. At one point, he did not even finish six consecutive races. Such inconsistency led to Small's release at the end of the season. Small did not go away, however, and once again he restarted his family team for three 2003 races. After a 21st place season debut, Small earned his third career top-10: a 10th at California. A 23rd-place finish at Phoenix would be his last start of the year. Small was called upon in mid-2004 to drive the No. 13 ThorSport Racing Chevy in place of Tina Gordon. Small did his fill-in role decently, earning a best finish of 21st at Darlington. However, the ride did not convert into any more races and Small has not raced in NASCAR since. ==Motorsports career resultsNASCAR=== (key) (Bold – Pole position awarded by qualifying time.

Following an extensive search for her, her remains were discovered in Yateley Heath Woods in Yateley, Hampshire, on 18 September. On 23 June 2011, Levi Bellfield, who was already serving three life sentences for the murders of Marsha McDonnell and Amélie Delagrange and the attempted murder of Kate Sheedy, was found guilty of abducting and murdering Dowler and sentenced to an additional whole-life tariff. On 27 January 2016, Surrey Police announced that Bellfield had admitted to abducting, abusing and killing Dowler. Following their daughter's death, Dowler's parents established a charity called Milly's Fund to \\"promote public safety, and in particular the safety of the children and young people.\\" The case generated debate over the treatment of victims and witnesses in court, after Dowler's family criticised the way they were cross-examined during Bellfield's trial. Dowler's murder played a significant role in the News of the World phone-hacking scandal. In 2011, reports said the News of the World journalists had accessed Dowler's voicemail after she was reported missing, giving her parents false hope she was still alive. The resulting outcry from the British public contributed to the closure of the newspaper and led to a range of investigations and inquiries into phone hacking and media ethics in British media. == Disappearance == At 3:07pm on 21 March 2002, Dowler left Heathside School in Weybridge and walked to Weybridge railway station with a friend. The girls disembarked at Walton-on-Thames railway station, one stop before Dowler's usual stop of Hersham, and went to eat at the station cafe. After Dowler telephoned her father at 3:47 pm to say she would be home in half an hour, the girls left the cafe at 4:05, with Dowler walking home alone. She was last seen three minutes later, walking along Station Avenue, by a friend of her sister, who was waiting at a bus stop. A closed-circuit television camera located further along the road showed no images of Dowler. A red Daewoo Nexia, which belonged to Levi Bellfield's girlfriend Emma Mills, was photographed driving past by the same camera at 4:32 pm. In an April 2009 interview, Bellfield said that he was driving the car. When Dowler failed to return home, she was reported missing to the police at 7:00 pm. A nationwide search for her followed, with 100 police officers and helicopters searching fields, streets and rivers around Hersham. Detectives who had investigated the abduction of Sarah Payne were called in to help. Police and the Dowler family made many appeals for information, including a reconstruction on Crimewatch UK. The Crimewatch UK appeal included a direct appeal to Dowler in the hope that she had run away from home of her own accord. A plea was also made by Pop Idol winner Will Young, whose concert Dowler had attended shortly before her disappearance. Dowler's mother expressed hope that her daughter had run away, but said that she could not think of a reason why she would want to do so. The Independent reported in 2011 that Dowler had, some time previously, written a mock leaving-home letter and notes showing she had been unhappy. A week after Dowler's disappearance, the police stated that she was probably not taken by force. They reasoned that while she was unlikely to have gone off with someone she did not know of her own free will, no-one had come forward who had witnessed a struggle, despite a number of apparent sightings of her prior to her disappearance. On 23 April 2002, the discovery of a body in the River Thames prompted media speculation that the remains might be those of Dowler, but the body was identified the following day as that of 73-year-old Maisie Thomas, who went missing in March 2001, and whose death was not believed to be suspicious. In June 2002, despite further searches, the offer of a £100,000 reward by national tabloid newspaper The Sun and her parents continuing to send text messages to her mobile telephone in hope of a reply, Dowler remained missing. That month, police told her parents that she was probably dead. == Body discovery and murder investigation == On 18 September 2002, naked human remains were discovered by mushroom pickers in Yateley Heath Woods near Yateley, Hampshire. They were later confirmed through dental records as Dowler's. Due to the severity of the decomposition, the cause of death could not be ascertained. No items of Dowler's clothing or possessions—the purse, rucksack or mobile phone—she had with her at the time of her disappearance have ever been recovered. The discovery of the body led the police to reclassify the case from a missing person to a homicide investigation. Undertaken by Surrey Police, the investigation was code-named Operation Ruby. On 22 November 2002, police set up a road block near the spot where the body was found. Some 6,000 motorists in the area were questioned, but no leads were discovered. Initially the Surrey police had considered Dowler's father a suspect, as police have often found that family members are implicated in such cases. They later apologised for the missed opportunities their attention to this track may have caused. On 23 March 2003, DNA of an unidentified male was discovered on an item of Dowler's clothing in her bedroom, suggesting that her killer may have met her before. This link was ruled out within three months, at the same time that a DNA link to a church robbery in Sunderland was also ruled out. Paul Hughes was convicted of making threats to kill and was jailed for five years after sending letters to Dowler's sister threatening to kill her and claiming to have killed Dowler. Hughes sent the letters while imprisoned for indecently assaulting a twelve-year-old girl; the prison service apologised for not screening mail effectively. Lianne Newman, of Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire, repeatedly phoned Dowler's parents, school and the police, pretending to be Dowler. Newman was jailed in April 2003 for five months after pleading guilty to five counts of making phone calls to cause annoyance, inconvenience or needless anxiety. Gary Farr, of Retford, Nottinghamshire, repeatedly e-mailed Dowler's parents, school friends and police officers working on the case, claiming that Dowler had been smuggled out of the country to work as a prostitute and stripper at nightclubs in Poland, and that her alleged death had been a cover-up. Farr was sectioned indefinitely under the Mental Health Act on 19 October 2006 for being a serious psychological danger to the public after admitting a charge of harassment.https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/news/local-news/section-order-man-who- targeted-4837633 In March 2008, a man was arrested over the 'disposal' of a car linked to the murder investigation but he was released later that same day. On 4 August 2009, a 40-year-old man from west London was arrested in relation to the disposal of a red Daewoo Nexia, but later released without charge. Two months later, Bedfont Lakes Country Park in West London was searched by police in the hope of finding the car, but they recovered neither the car nor anything else of interest to their inquiry. The car has yet to be found. On 25 February 2008, Surrey Police confirmed that Levi Bellfield was their prime suspect in the murder inquiry and that they were \\"very interested\\" in questioning him. On 30 March 2010, Bellfield was charged with Dowler's abduction and murder. As a result, the inquest into the death was adjourned. On 6 October 2010, Bellfield appeared in court via video link, as he was already serving three life sentences for murder and attempted murder. He was formally charged with one count of attempted abduction, one count of abduction, one count of disposal of evidence, and one count of murder. == Trial of Bellfield == Bellfield's trial began on 10 May 2011 at the Central Criminal Court before Mr Justice Wilkie and concluded on 23 June 2011; the jury found him guilty. He was sentenced to life imprisonment the following day, and the trial judge recommended a whole-life tariff in line with his previous murder convictions three years earlier. The trial of Bellfield on another charge of attempted abduction, in the case of Rachel Cowles, an 11-year-old girl known to have been offered a lift in the Walton area by a man in a red car on 20 March 2002, was abandoned due to newspapers publishing prejudicial material. The judge ordered that the charge should remain on file. === Post-trial === Following the trial of Bellfield, the murder of Dowler, investigation, and trial were the subject of a special Crimewatch programme, titled Taken: The Milly Dowler Story, which was broadcast on BBC One on 30 June 2011. It featured interviews with witnesses, the family, and investigators. It explored how Bellfield was caught. It also featured a reconstruction of what is believed to have occurred, based on court transcripts. On 27 January 2016, Surrey Police announced that Bellfield had admitted to the abduction, rape and murder of Dowler. This was after another arrest in the Dowler case had been made and Bellfield was interviewed about whether he had had an accomplice. After Bellfield's confession, the police released the individual they had arrested without charge. On 12 February 2016, Bellfield changed his story, denying that he had confessed to Dowler's murder.  Reactions to court proceedings  After Bellfield's sentencing, the Dowler family strongly criticised their treatment during the trial. Dowler's sister Gemma described the day that her parents were cross-examined by Bellfield's defence lawyer as \\"the worst day of my life\\". Her mother told reporters outside the Old Bailey: Dowler's father, Bob, commented on Bellfield's refusal to give evidence in court, and to appear for sentencing. He added: Chief Constable Mark Rowley, who oversaw the investigation, joined the Director of Public Prosecutions in calling for changes and for greater protection of victims and witnesses during court cases. Rowley said it was a \\"most bizarre and distressing coincidence\\" that the Dowler family had their privacy \\"destroyed\\", at a time when footballers and celebrities were being granted super-injunctions to protect details of their personal lives. Justice Secretary Kenneth Clarke rejected calls for a review of criminal cases, saying \\"it is just an unfortunate anomaly in the application of a fair and balanced judicial system\\". Clarke said that, while Bellfield had been convicted of previous murders, he had to be presumed innocent in the Dowler case and found guilty by a jury in a full court process, and not presumed guilty. To avoid prejudicing the trial, the court did not allow evidence to be introduced of Bellfield's \\"obsession\\" with schoolgirls, and his attempts to procure sex from them. == Voicemail tampering investigation == The Guardian reported on 4 July 2011 that Scotland Yard had discovered Dowler's voicemail had been accessed by journalists working for the News of the World and the newspaper's private investigator Glenn Mulcaire.James Robinson \\"Milly Dowler phone hacking: Family shocked by NoW revelations\\", The Guardian, 4 July 2011 The Guardian also reported that, during the police investigation into that newspaper's phone hacking activities, detectives discovered that journalists had deleted some messages—potential evidence—in Dowler's voicemail box because it was full, in order to free up space for new messages, to which they could listen. The deletions after Dowler was missing led family and friends to think that she was still alive.Nick Davies and Amelia Hill \\"Missing Milly Dowler's voicemail was hacked by News of the World\\", The Guardian, 4 July 2011 It was later reported that Dowler's phone automatically deleted messages 72 hours after they were listened to. Dowler's parents announced via their solicitor that they would pursue a claim for damages against the News of the World.\\"Milly Dowler's phone was 'hacked by News of The World'\\", Daily Telegraph, 4 July 2011 In September 2011, it was reported that the Dowler family had been offered £2m in personal damages.Gordon Rayner and Andrew Hough Phone hacking: Milly Dowler family set for £3 million News International payout, The Daily Telegraph, 20 September 2011 In January 2012, it was reported that Surrey Police and other police forces knew soon after Dowler's death that News of the World staff had accessed her mobile phone messages, but did not take issue with this. Instead a senior Surrey officer invited newspaper staff to a meeting to discuss the case. == Legacy == Dowler's parents, Sally and Bob Dowler, launched a charity called Milly's Fund on the day of her memorial service in October 2002. Its mission was \\"to promote public safety, and in particular the safety of the children and young people\\". The charity provides risk assessment advice to teenagers, youth workers, and educators. Its work includes the \\"Teach UR Mum 2 TXT\\" campaign, which encourages children and parents to stay in contact via text messaging, including a glossary for parents of commonly-used SMS abbreviations. The campaign was awarded \\"Best Use of Mobile for Accessibility\\" at the 2004 GSM Association Awards. Milly's Fund commissioned a five-part soap opera titled Watch Over Me (2003), which encourages personal safety for teenagers, to be distributed to every school in the UK. In 2005, the family announced that the charity would be transferred to the Suzy Lamplugh Trust. Milly's Fund was wound up that year. At the 2005 Hampton Court Palace Flower Show, a garden designed in memory of Dowler by Penny Smith won the Tudor Rose award, the show's highest honour. Its design was supported by the Surrey Police and Milly's Fund. A magenta sweetpea was named after Dowler and made publicly available by Matthewman's Sweetpeas. On 29 June 2017, Dowler's sister Gemma released a book dedicated to Dowler, titled My Sister Milly. The investigation that led to Bellfield's arrest was dramatised in the three-part 2019 television series Manhunt, with Martin Clunes playing Colin Sutton. == References  Further reading == * == External links == * Category:2002 murders in the United Kingdom Category:2002 in England Category:March 2002 events in the United Kingdom Category:2000s missing person cases Category:History of Surrey Category:Murder in Surrey Category:News International phone hacking scandal Category:Missing person cases in England Category:2000s in Surrey Category:Deaths by strangulation ","title":"Murder of Milly Dowler"},{"id":"6206415","text":"\\"Trashed\\" is the debut solo single from ex-Skunk Anansie front woman Skin.

Most customer engineers provide corporate technical assistance which includes debugging mainframe computers and developing outdated products. Customer engineers need to keep up to date on the latest technical developments in their company's customers. Part of their job description requires servicing special equipment that has broken down or seemingly run its course. Many of the engineers are asked to repair specific equipment and others focus on just helping clients. The role of customer engineer has spread to other companies in different industries such as technology, aviation, and telecommunications. Customer engineers are in charge of repairing large-scale networking problems. ==IBM Customer Engineer (IBM CE)== Originally simply engineer, those who specialized in servicing IBM equipment in use by its customers were designated customer engineers by Tom Watson circa 1942. Based on the requirements, an IBM CE could be a Field CE and service many customers around a defined territory, e.g.: Kuala Lumpur, or they could be based at the place of business of a particularly large customer and service only that one customer e.g.: Tenaga Nasional. ==NCR Customer Engineer (NCR CE)== The title of CE or customer engineer is used by National Cash Register (NCR) to designate specially trained personnel who are charged with the installation, maintenance and repair of equipment and systems according to contracts with end users.

Cover by Al Parker Al Parker (1906–1985) was an American artist and illustrator. Parker's display of talent as a teenager led his grandfather, a Mississippi River Pilot, to pay for Al's first year in Washington University's School of Fine Arts in St. Louis, Missouri in 1922. He also played saxophone in a jazz band on a river boat to earn money for tuition. He participated in many combination jam- sessions-and-sketching-trips to service hospitals during World War II. He married a fellow student, Evelyn, and later joined with several former classmates to open an advertising agency in St. Louis. The business did not do well during the Great Depression, and Parker moved to New York City in 1935.Off the Shelf Parker got a break when a cover illustration he did for House Beautiful won a national competition. He soon was producing illustrations for Chatelaine, Collier's, Ladies' Home Journal and Woman's Home Companion. Starting in 1938, he produced a total of 50 covers over a 13-year period for the Ladies' Home Journal. He also sold illustrations to Cosmopolitan, Good Housekeeping, McCall's, The Saturday Evening Post, Sports Illustrated, Town and Country and Vogue. Parker later became part of the art colony in suburban New Rochelle, New York, which was well known for its unprecedented number of prominent American illustrators Toast of the Town: Norman Rockwell and the Artists of New Rochelle (more than fifty percent of the illustrations in the country’s leading publications were done by artists from New Rochelle). Parker is credited with creating a new school of illustration and was much imitated. In an effort to distinguish himself from his imitators, he worked in a variety of styles, themes and media. Examples range from children's crayons to acrylics. In cooperation with the magazine's art director, he secretly provided every illustration in an issue of Cosmopolitan, using different pseudonyms, styles and mediums for each story. Over the years, he won more than twenty-five gold medals and awards of excellence in Art Directors Club and Society of Illustrators' shows. He was also a past president of the Westport Artists.The Illustrator in America, 1860-2000 by Walt Reed Parker was one of the founding faculty members for the Famous Artists School. He was elected to the Society of Illustrators' Hall of Fame in 1965. A stamp commemorating his art was issued by the United States Postal Service on February 1, 2001 as part of the American Illustrators Issue series. Parker moved to Carmel, California by 1961, and with the demise of many of the magazines, his output of illustrations was curtailed. He continued to do occasional assignments for publications such as Sports Illustrated and Boys' Life. One such commission was an outstanding series of paintings of the Grand Prix auto race of Europe for Sports Illustrated.The Illustrator in America, 1860-2000 by Walt Reed His son, Kit Parker, founded the film company, Kit Parker Films. ==References *Al Parker Collection - retrieved July 31, 2006 *Al Parker, American Illustrator - retrieved July 31, 2006 *Fan letter to Parker from Norman Rockwell *Al Parker, Illustrator, Innovator, THE reference book from Auad Publishing, 2014.

A professional competitor since 2001, Smith was also a contestant on The Ultimate Fighter: The Comeback, and has competed for the UFC, Strikeforce, EliteXC and PFC. He is also the former WEC Light Heavyweight Champion. ==Background== Smith was born in Reno, Nevada and raised in Elk Grove, California, attending Elk Grove High School where he competed in wrestling. Smith then continued his career in junior college where he placed in the California State Championship.http://prommanow.com/2009/05/05/scott-smith-talks-about-upcoming- fight-with-nick-diaz-pro-mma-exclusive-interview/ ==Mixed martial arts careerEarly career=== In the early half of his career, Smith fought as a Heavyweight and compiled victories in the International Fighting Championships and Gladiator Challenge shows across the United States. While successful in the smaller promotions, Smith's first major appearance in the mixed martial arts world came in the World Extreme Cagefighting organization. Smith entered a WEC Light Heavyweight tournament with limited name recognition, but was branded by experts as the dark horse of the competition. Smith defeated WEC veteran Tim McKenzie in the semi-finals. With that victory, Smith was slated to fight Justin Levens in the tournament finals; Levens, however, was halted on doctor's advice due to a shoulder injury he sustained in his semi-final bout. The tournament alternate, Tait Fletcher, was brought into the championship round instead. Smith made short work of Fletcher, scoring a first-round technical knockout to become the WEC Light Heavyweight Champion. Smith would defend his championship from Justin Levens at WEC 18 before scheduling a fight with the Ultimate Fighting Championship in April 2006, moving down a weight class to fight David Terrell at UFC 59. The fight – marked with questionable officiating – ended in controversial fashion, prompting Smith to file a complaint with the California State Athletic Commission. The referee called for a break, which Smith adhered to but Terrell did not hear. When Smith stopped fighting, Terrell quickly locked in a rear naked choke, which the referee did not break. Smith was forced to tap out and protested immediately. Smith was then seen as a middleweight contestant on The Ultimate Fighter: The Comeback, where he quickly lost his quarterfinal matchup against Travis Lutter. Smith appeared on the season finale, knocking out Pete Sell in the second round of a very exciting fight in a sequence that saw Smith sustain a hard punch to the liver, and throw the bout-winning knockout punch before falling to the ground in pain. Smith lost his next fight in the UFC by decision against Patrick Cote at UFC 67. More recently, Smith defeated Troy Miller by technical knockout at Palace Fighting Championship 2 in Lemoore, California. He lost against Ed Herman at UFC 72. Herman submitted Smith with a rear naked choke at 2:25 in the second round after Herman landed a nasty elbow on Smith in the first round covering his face in blood. ===EliteXC=== Smith made his EliteXC debut on February 16 knocking out Kyle Noke seven seconds into round two. The victory earned him a title shot against Robbie Lawler. The bout was declared a no contest after an accidental poke in the eye in the third round. The first two rounds were so exciting that Gary Shaw awarded both fighters their win bonuses and announced an immediate rematch. Smith lost the subsequent rematch to Lawler via TKO on July 26, 2008, at EliteXC: Unfinished Business. ===Strikeforce=== At Strikeforce: Destruction, Smith took a fight with Terry Martin on one week's notice and defeated Martin via KO (punch) in the 1st round. Smith faced Benji Radach at Strikeforce: Shamrock vs. Diaz on April 11, 2009. Smith defeated Radach by knocking him out in the third round. Radach had, for the majority of the fight, showcased his ability as the more refined striker, and was arguably heading toward a unanimous decision victory until Smith caught him with a flush straight right late on in round three and followed up with strikes to seal a dramatic victory. On June 6, 2009, Smith was matched up with Nick Diaz at a catchweight of 180 lb. during Strikeforce: Lawler vs. Shields, losing via rear naked choke at 1:19 of the third round. Smith fought Cung Le at Strikeforce: Evolution on December 19, 2009. Despite being dominated throughout most of the fight, Smith won via third round knock out and became the first man to ever defeat Cung Le. Smith fought Le again in a rematch with at Strikeforce: Fedor vs. Werdum on June 26, 2010. Smith lost by second round KO. Smith fought Paul Daley in a welterweight bout on December 4, 2010, at Strikeforce: Henderson vs. Babalu II. Daley defeated Smith via one punch KO in the first round. As Smith was throwing a punch, Daley caught him with a hook. Smith took some time off after his loss to Daley, trying to heal up some injuries and rejuvenate his ground game. He faced Tarec Saffiedine at Welterweight at the Strikeforce: Fedor vs. Henderson event. He lost the bout via unanimous decision. After an 8-month layoff, Smith faced Lumumba Sayers at Strikeforce: Tate vs. Rousey. He lost via submission (guillotine choke) in round one, suffering his fourth loss in a row. ===Post-Strikeforce career=== Smith was expected to face Marcus Gaines at Gladiator Challenge on June 23, 2012, but an injury during training forced him to withdraw from the bout. Smith faced Mark Matthews on August 3, 2013, at WCFC 6 for the WCFC Middleweight Championship. He won the fight via second round TKO. He was then expected to face Max Griffin at WCFC 8 on February 15, 2014, however the bout was cancelled prior to the event. ==Personal life== Smith has two sons. Smith has a younger brother, Shawn, who is also a mixed martial artist. He also has three sisters and an older brother. ==Championships and accomplishments== *West Coast Fighting Championship **WCFC Middleweight Championship (One time, current) *World Extreme Cagefighting **WEC Light Heavyweight Championship (One time) ==Mixed martial arts record== -

It is written and illustrated by Amy Reeder. The first of a planned three volumes was released on July 11, 2006. There are currently no plans for the third, and final, volume to be printed. ==Plot== Penny is a sophomore who starts a girls- only club whose mission is to help girls find love in gentlemen, rather than the school's jerks. At the club meeting, which are disguised as geology discussions, girls vote on which boys to decree \\"pyrites.\\" The word becomes slang for a boy that seems good, but is ultimately cheap. If a boy is declared a pyrite, the girls throw darts into a doll, similar to voodoo. This is a vow to not date the boy. Girls also call to attention boys that are not jerks. The club completely changes the high school hierarchy. Girls begin to avoid jocks and date nerds. Penny finds herself as a sort of \\"queen bee\\" the other girls look up to. The new arrangements are shaken when Penny finds herself falling for a pyrite and Hannah shows a boy the club's flyer. ==Characters== ;Penny: A 15-year-old girl who designs clothes with her aunt, Nicole. She is confident and likable, but she considers Katie her only friend. Penny regards her looks as art, not necessarily the means of attracting boys or outdoing other girls. Her mother died from pneumonia. ;Nicole: Penny's childish, 26-year-old aunt. Nicole is a fashion designer who runs a costume shop. Her relationship with Penny could best be described as sisterly. ;Steve: Penny's father. He is an ER doctor who thinks fashion design is a frivolous occupation and wants his daughter to focus on studies more. Penny finds it hard to meet his expectations. ;Katie: A sixteen-year-old who is much less fashion conscious than Penny. She does not gossip, and is honest. Unlike Penny, she has had boyfriends. Katie's relationships were the springboard for the founding of the club. Katie has to move in volume one, but she and Penny keep in touch. Katie is Penny's closest confidante. ;Blake: A rich sixteen-year-old whose parents moved into Colorado's mountains. He is a perfectionist, particularly when it comes to grammar. He goes around town at night with a stencil and spray paints signs, correcting grammar. His biography on Tokyopop's website describes him as \\"borderline OCD\\" and a \\"nerd,\\" albeit handsome. He does not realize that his desire to perfect people around him makes him seem conceited and mean. ;Hannah: An outgoing, vain sixteen-year-old. She rarely sees her parents except when she has a performance in something. She is the best student in her class, has been in fifteen commercials, and models. Unlike Penny, she is fixated on designer clothes. She feels Penny is stealing the attention from her. ;Orion: A fifteen-year-old environmentalist who tries to organize his classmates into planting trees and picking up trash. His parents are hippies, and his hair is long enough to reach his shoulders and cover his eyes. He is particularly knowledgeable when it comes to birds; he can identify any song or appearance. He is usually very shy, only speaking to organize environmental clean-ups. He starts dating Penny, and he lets her cut his hair. They have their first kiss with each other. Jealousy starts to set in when Penny starts to have less time for him because of her club and when she starts hanging out more with Blake. ==Release== The series is also licensed in Finland by Pauna Media Group, ==References *Fool's Gold at Tokyopop's site *Hadley's deviantART account - Fool's Gold art *Hadley's Official Site Fool's Gold art, including character sketches and chapter breaks *Interview with Amy at comiXology Category:Humor comics Category:Romance comics Category:Tokyopop titles ","title":"Fool's Gold (comics)"},{"id":"6206456","text":"right SynthEdit is a shareware Windows application which uses a modular VPL (Visual Programming Language) to create music synthesizers and effects units.

For example, for the year 2012: September 1, 2011 to August 2, 2012 ==Livelöpet== 'Livelöpet is an interactive digital scene on aftonbladet.se. where artists perform live concerts. At the concert, the audience can interact with both the artist and their Facebook friends through a variety of touch as to clap, shout, like songs, take pictures and post on Facebook, swaying with lighters and even making out with someone else in the audience. The artist takes part of all interactions. Livelöpet was launched August 17, 2010 by Rockbjörnen Live, Aftonbladet's music prize since 1979, which that year went through a change and became a prize with focus on live performances. The investment was a strategic move to reposition Rockbjörnen from a traditional music prize to one that rewards the live scene in Sweden. The repositioning had its roots in the changing music industry underwent a technological paradigm shift (from about 1998 onwards) where music is increasingly consumed through digital media and the live scene grew stronger. The first year seven Livelöpet concerts was performed, by Mando Diao, The Ark, Robyn, Salem Al Fakir, Ola, Anna Bergendahl och Eric Saade. The artist plays live in the Aftonbladet studio. The concert streamed live over the web and with a custom- built application where the audience can interact with each other and the artist through various buttons. The artist takes part of the audience interaction via a monitor in the studio where all shouts appear in a live feed, just as the number of applause, waving lighters and snogging. A live update of the most requested songs are also listed on the monitor and the artist can choose whether it wants to meet the audience's wishes or not. Concerts can also be experienced with no impact if desired. This can the audience do during the live concerts: Clap your hands, Shout, Wishing songs, Taking photos and post them on Facebook, Sway with the lighters, Make out with a Facebook friend or someone in the audience, See the concert without any effects The total number of unique visitors was 44 000. Total number of interactions between audience and artists was 2.4 million. 29 million people worldwide were reached by the news of Livelöpet, which was spread through social media. The number of unique visitors to www.rockbjornen.se was increased with more than 300%. Traffic from 63 countries could be measured during the seven concerts. There are a lot of advantages of the interactive digital scene Livelöpet. The artist reaches out to a large number of fans wherever they are geographically, and then reaches the so-called Long tail. The concert can be experienced by people who do not normally have the opportunity to get to or go to concerts, such as minors. Unlike TV format, \\"meets\\" the fans their idol in the digital space when he or she takes part of all interactions from the audience. The name Livelöpet (Live rennet) comes from the original idea where the idea was that the concert would be live in a banner on Aftonbladet.se. Then it would be without any interaction possibilities with the different buttons. The banner would be designed as a headline on which the sender is an evening paper, hence the name Livelöpet (live rennet). Prior to the Swedish Parliamentary elections in 2010 there was a variant of Livelöpet; Live Square. Parliamentary party leaders' made speeches through the web and responded directly to questions from the audience. The audience was applauding or booing the party leaders’ voice, put on a party-button and take pictures of the speech which they could post on Facebook. ==SkapaTV== In SkapaTV for Rockbjörnen you can make your own music - for free both online and mobile.

He is most noted as the state prosecutor in the Rivonia trial in which anti-apartheid activist Nelson Mandela and seven others were convicted of sabotage and sentenced to life imprisonment. == Early life == Percy Yutar was born in the Cape Town suburb of Woodstock to parents who had emigrated to South Africa from the ghettos of Lithuania, like the majority of the country's once-large Jewish community. His father's original surname was \\"Yuter\\". As a young man, he worked in his father’s butcher's shop. Yutar attended the University of Cape Town on a scholarship, and in 1937 received his doctorate in Law. Despite his education, given the prevalence of antisemitism in South Africa at the time, he had to work, for five years, in a lowly legal position at the post office. In 1940, he was appointed a junior state prosecutor and eventually become Deputy Attorney General, first in the Orange Free State, and later in the Transvaal. == The Rivonia trial and apartheid == Yutar was the prosecutor in the 1963 Rivonia Trial against Nelson Mandela and nine others. Yutar charged the defendants with sabotage and conspiracy, instead of the more serious crime of treason. Mandela and seven others were convicted and two were acquitted. During sentencing, Yutar argued that the full weight of the law should be brought to bear on the defendants, but did not specify whether he believed the defendants should be executed or sentenced to prison. Since the death penalty was rarely used for sabotage and conspiracy, Justice Quartus de Wet sentenced the defendants to life in prison. Anti-apartheid activists condemned the guilty verdict, but were relieved that Mandela had not been charged with treason and would not be executed. During the trial, Yutar brutally cross- examined some of the defendants. Yutar even carried out a hostile cross- examination of Alan Paton, who had appeared in mitigation of sentence. Yutar accused the defendants of telling lies to the world that Africans in South Africa were oppressed. In truth, he said, Africans were peaceful, law-abiding and loyal to the regime. After the sentencing and conclusion of the trial, Yutar was lionised in the media as South Africa’s saviour, the defender of civilisation against the forces of darkness. He encouraged this image by stoking white fears of an imminent bloodbath. The minister of justice, John Vorster, lauded him as a true patriot, while he was vilified by anti-apartheid activists, such as the African National Congress, which he denounced as a communist-dominated terrorist organisation that had misled the black masses. South Africa's security forces held him in high regard. Benjamin Pogrund, former deputy-editor of The Rand Daily Mail in Johannesburg, confirmed that Yutar \\"was loved by the security police. They told me they loved him because he did their bidding. What they wanted, he did, including all his histrionics in court.\\" Yutar was said to be indifferent towards apartheid. Years later, after the end of apartheid, Yutar claimed that his decision to charge the defendants with sabotage instead of treason had saved their lives. In his last recorded interview, he stated: \\"If I had merely even asked for the death penalty, the judge would have granted...They would have been named martyrs and that would have led to a hellish revolution, and a bloody civil war. And I have not the slightest doubt that I acted correctly, and saved this country.\\" George Bizos, one of the trial's defence lawyers, called this a lie. Mandela was released from prison in 1990. Negotiations to end apartheid culminated in South Africa's first free elections in 1994, in which Mandela and the African National Congress won a large majority, and Mandela became president. In 1995, President Mandela invited Yutar to a Kosher lunch, and allegedly said that [Yutar] was simply doing his duty as state prosecutor. == Legacy == Yutar was a controversial figure whose \\"vengeful and forbidding image as a relentless opponent of the anti-apartheid struggle contrasted with his private persona as a gentle and devoted husband and father, who loved classical music.\\" For 11 years, Yutar served as chairman of the United Hebrew Congregation, a collection of Orthodox synagogues in Johannesburg. == In popular culture == In the 2017 film An Act of Defiance, which follows the story of defence lawyer Bram Fischer in the Rivonia trial, Yutar was portrayed by actor José Domingos. Fischer and others in Mandela's defence team initially believe that Yutar's Jewish background would help their clients. However, in one scene, Yutar complains that Mandela's Jewish co-defendants (whom he calls \\"Jewish terrorists\\") have placed the Jewish community at risk of violence from white South Africans. ==See also== *History of the Jews in South Africa ==ReferencesFurther reading== * Category:1911 births Category:2002 deaths Category:Politicians from Cape Town Category:South African lawyers Category:University of Cape Town alumni Category:South African Jews Category:South African people of Lithuanian-Jewish descent Category:20th- century lawyers ","title":"Percy Yutar"},{"id":"6206463","text":"Gil Jourdan is a Belgian detective comic strip created by Maurice Tillieux. It is a combination of mystery, adventure and humour. From left to right: Libellule, Jourdan and Crouton on the cover of an omnibus edition ==Origin and premise== In 1956 the Belgian comic magazine Héroïc Albums ceased publication. Felix, the adventures of a young bespectacled detective written and drawn by Maurice Tillieux, was among the casualties, but returned in Spirou magazine as Gil Jourdan, though without the glasses. Jourdan made his first appearance in a rather original manner: in issue 962 of Spirou, the bungling police Inspector Crouton takes wisecracking burglar Libellule out of prison in order to proceed to a reconstruction of a theft for which he has been arrested. Libellule is then snatched from right under Crouton's nose by a young man named Gil Jourdan. Jourdan is a private investigator in need of a big break and he thinks that Libellule's burglary skills could be useful in exposing a gang of popaïne [sic] smugglers. Once the smugglers' ring had been captured, the trio of Jourdan, Libellule and Crouton would proceed to handle other cases which sometimes took them from France to South America and the Middle East, Libellule and Crouton providing the comic relief which contrasted with Jourdan's earnest nature. Looking on was Queue-de-Cerise, Jourdan's secretary who sometimes also helped out in the investigations. ==Main characters== Clockwise from top left: Gil Jourdan, Libellule, Inspector Crouton and Queue- de-Cerise. { border=0   Gil Jourdan is a Paris-based detective. A Bachelor of Law (\\"I started very early\\"), he is young, earnest, shrewd and cool-headed. No mystery can stand up to him and he has quite a merit in solving them given the people he has to work with. From the start Jourdan was hardly the sort of hero who was out for Justice in itself. His main motivation was earning money and exposing a gang of drugs smugglers was really a means of obtaining a big break from which he profited in many ways. ----   Andre Papignolles alias Libellule (French for \\"Dragonfly\\") is a former burglar who becomes Jourdan's right-hand. Jourdan finds his know-how in the field of thievery very useful. Libellule is full of good humour, but he tends to be the only one who laughs at his puns and jokes. ----   Inspector Jules Annibal Crouton is Jourdan's police contact. In the course of their first encounters he was the subject of several humiliating experiences, courtesy of Jourdan and Libellule. He did not bear a grudge however and accompanied them on most of their subsequent cases, even recommending them to clients. Jourdan would even refer to him as \\"eccentric not stupid\\", after Crouton had saved his life. ----   Queue-de-Cerise (French for \\"Cherry Stem\\") is Jourdan's secretary and often helps out in the actual cases. Like her boss she is of a serious nature and has little patience for Libellule's humour. She speaks nine languages. Her favourite means of transport is a scooter. ----   The Renault Dauphine was Jourdan's choice of vehicle in his early adventures. If he has a lucky streak that has got him out of many a dangerous situation, the same cannot be said for his cars which have often been the resultant victims. Later, as his agency became more successful, he obtained a Renault R17. } ==Publication and legacy== First appearing in Spirou magazine, Jourdan's adventures were then published in book form and even as omnibus editions which included short stories and other Tillieux detectives like Bob Slide (an FBI man in the 1930s), Felix (the original Jourdan) and Marc Jaguar (another detective). In later years the drawing was entrusted to the artist Gos while Tillieux stuck to the writing. Tillieux' death in a car accident in 1978 brought an end to the series, though a number of short stories by other artists were drawn and published in homage to him and Jourdan some ten years later. ==Notes on some of the stories== A short story La poursuite (The Pursuit) was published in issue 1316 of Spirou in 1963 and acted as a prequel to the series. In it Crouton makes several desperate attempts to arrest Libellule. This story takes place before either of them meets Jourdan. Jourdan's early adventures were banned in France by the censor, who objected to the portrayal of the French police, represented by Crouton, as bungling, incompetent no-hopers. Crouton later became a more efficient police officer, even if he was sometimes a bit slow on deductions. The ban was later lifted. La rue perdue (The Lost Street), published in 1978, was set in 1953 and was thus yet another prequel to the series. The story is also notable for being published in the quarterly magazine Tintin Special (see Tintin magazine), Spirou's main competitor. Sadly and ironically it was also Tillieux's final Jourdan adventure. ==Stories== To date four of Jourdan's adventures have been published in English. Below is a list of the French titles, their year of publication, an English translation of the titles and a brief description. They are listed in order of publication. ===By Tillieux=== { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"width:100%; margin:auto;\\" - ! width=\\"120\\"French Title ! width=\\"120\\"Date of Publication ! width=\\"120\\"English Translation ! width=\\"120\\"Writer ! width=\\"120\\"Artist } ===Post-Tillieux=== The series ended in 1978 following Tillieux's death. Ten years later Soleils Editions published the comic book L'Hommage à Gil Jourdan - Les enquêtes de leurs amis (\\"Homage to Gil Jourdan - Their Friends' Cases\\") with the approval of Tillieux's family. It featured Jourdan and his colleagues in adventures written and drawn by other writers and artists, including several leading ones such as Pierre Seron, Turk, Éric Maltaite and Tillieux's former assistant Stephen Desberg. The stories also featured some of the crooks from the Tillieux period returning and seeking revenge. Tillieux had been notable for not using the same enemy twice. The cover was drawn by François Walthéry. { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"width:100%; margin:auto;\\" - ! width=\\"120\\"French Title ! width=\\"120\\"Date of Publication ! width=\\"120\\"English Translation ! width=\\"120\\"Writer ! width=\\"120\\"Artist } ==English translations== In August 2011, Fantagraphics published a translated volume, collecting the third and fourth volume of the original series. ==In popular culture== In the Belgian Comic Strip Center in Brussels the permanent exhibition brings homage to the pioneers of Belgian comics, among them Maurice Tillieux and \\"Gil Jourdan\\". Gil Jourdan is among the many Belgian comics characters to jokingly have a Brussels street named after them. The Rue des Bouchers/Lange Beenhouwersstraat has a commemorative plaque with the name Rue Gil Jourdan/ Guus Slim straat placed under the actual street sign. http://www.ebru.be/Other/Strips/bruxelles-1000-noms-de-rue-bd.html In May 2009 a wall was dedicated to Gil Jourdan in the Leopold I-straat/Rue Leopold I 201 in Laeken, Belgium as part of the Brussels' Comic Book Route.http://www.brussel.be/dwnld/90422347/giljourdan.jpg There are also two mural paintings dedicated to the series in Auderghem, one in the Rue du Vieux Moulin/Oudemolenstraat and the other in the Rue Emile Idiers/Emile Idiers straat. ==Sources * Dupuis page for Gil Jourdan collection (in French) * English fan page * Tillieux rarity books - Elan publisher - Editions de l'Elan (french) * Large Tillieux fan site (in French) Category:Belgian comic strips Category:Franco-Belgian comics Jourdan, Gil Category:Dupuis titles Category:Detective comics Category:Adventure comics Jourdan, Gil Jourdan, Gil Category:Belgian comics titles Category:1956 comics debuts Jourdan, Gil Category:1978 comics endings Jourdan, Gil Jourdan, Gil Category:Comics set in Belgium ","title":"Gil Jourdan"},{"id":"6206491","text":"Andrew Galbraith Miller (September 18, 1801September 30, 1874) was an American lawyer and judge.

Prior to Wisconsin statehood, he served as a justice of the Supreme Court of Wisconsin Territory. ==Education and career== Born on September 18, 1801, in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, Miller attended Dickinson College and received a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1819 from Washington College (now Washington & Jefferson College), then read law in 1822. He entered private practice in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, from 1822 to 1838, and served as Attorney General of Pennsylvania. On November 8, 1838, he was commissioned Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the Wisconsin Territory by President Martin Van Buren and served in that role until Wisconsin became a state. ==Federal judicial service== Following the State of Wisconsin's admission to the Union on May 28, 1848, Miller was nominated by President James K. Polk on June 12, 1848, to the United States District Court for the District of Wisconsin, to a new seat authorized by 9 Stat. 56. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on June 12, 1848, and received his commission the same day. When Wisconsin was split into an Eastern and Western district, in 1870, Miller was reassigned by operation of law to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin on June 30, 1870, to a new seat authorized by 16 Stat. 171. His service terminated on January 1, 1873, due to his retirement. ===Notable cases=== During the difficult pre-American Civil War era, Miller upheld the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 and federal jurisdiction in the Sherman Booth and John Rycraft cases (1854–1855).

It is earned by those who have completed the necessary STCW requirements to obtain it. Third Assistant Engineers work on board ships and do most of the general labor among the officers, as well as leading the oilers and other engine room crew. Depending on the style of ship, company, and other factors, they are called \\"the Third\\" or \\"the Fourth\\" and usually stands a watch and sometimes assists the third mate in maintaining proper operation of the lifeboats. This credential, along with complementary endorsements and recognitions such as for tankers and cargo ships, is earned by cadets who complete the Marine Engineering Technology (MET) or Mechanical Engineering license track (ME(L)) majors at any of the credentialed maritime academies. In the US, these academies include the United States Merchant Marine Academy, California Maritime Academy , Great Lakes Maritime Academy, Massachusetts Maritime Academy, Maine Maritime Academy, State University of New York Maritime college, and Texas A&M; Maritime Academy. American 3rd Assistant Engineers can receive an optional commission as ensign in the U.S. Naval Reserve, Merchant Marine Reserve, or Coast Guard Reserve. With experience and additional training, third officers may qualify for higher rank. == Duties == The general duties for a third assistant engineer (fourth engineer) differ from ship to ship. Generally speaking, third assistant engineer (fourth engineer) are tasked with controlling the main propulsion systems, water systems, and anything else tasked to them from up in the chain of command. A third assistant engineer (fourth engineer) is part of the engine company’s chain of command. The top of this chain of command is the Chief engineer (first engineer) who is in command of engine room and auxiliary areas that would relate. Then comes the first assistant engineer (second engineer), second assistant engineer (third engineer), and then the third assistant engineer (fourth engineer). These are the officers within the engine company of a standard ship. The third assistant engineer is in charge of keeping the plant in operation, with command being passed down and being delegated by who is on watch. Their main duties include those involving propulsion, sewage processing and treatment, electrical, and general maintenance. However, they are trained to be competent in a wide variety of fields such as HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning), electronics, Shipboard medical and the operation of both steam and diesel driven plants. Duties will vary from ship to ship, but the Fourth Engineer is expected to handle jobs in all areas of the ship, as they are needed. In some instances, especially in the case of an emergency, third assistant engineers are tasked with using relevant knowledge to save the ship and her crew. Some examples of this include fixing pumps, monitoring equipment, and being trained in all safety procedures. == Training == The rank of third assistant engineer can be earned by one of two ways, either through school or working your way up as another member of the engine room crew. Both ways require the individual to complete specific courses as well as meet the requirements set out by STCW (Standards of Training, Certification and Watch keeping for Seafarers). Some such courses that are required no matter which method a potential seafarer chooses are the lifeboatman’s safety course and exam, Ship security and responsibility (SSAR), and Marine firefighting. These courses are required of crew members as they are important to the safety of the vessel and her crew, especially in the case of an emergency. All United States Merchant Marine must adhere to the strict compliance of international maritime organization's regulations in regard to safety and environmental regulations on shipping. Many of these same requirements can be found for vessels that are not protected under the United States Jones Act. In relation to this requirement, all Third Assistant Engineers, no matter which flag they sail under, must be competent in lifesaving procedures for a vast number different shipboard emergencies. These requirements, set by CFR 46, are mandatory and apply to all ships including those going domestically and internationally to adhere to these standards for all crew members, including the Third Assistant Engineer. the International Convention for the Safety of Life At Sea (SOLAS) is the global institution responsible for mandating standards for lifesaving procedures and equipment for all maritime vessels. they have practical training for surviving in a man overboard, fire, or other emergency situation. these trainings are done at certified institutions such at the MEBA or one of the many maritime academies. == The Jones Act == The Jones Act is a federal law that was created to protect american maritime shipping interest. Simply put, the law made sure that american flagged vessels must be starting and ending their voyage in an american port. Additionally, it must be manned by at least 75% american crew. This is important for american 3rd Assistant Engineers as they are directly protected by this law. == Unions and organizations == For U.S. maritime licensed and non-licensed crew, they are mandated to be part of one of many of the unions. The maritime industry is a closed shop style of union. there are two major Unions that a third assistant engineer (fourth engineer): MEBA (Marine Engineers' Beneficial Association) and AMO (American Maritime Officer). These unions protect the maritime industry by protecting the workers and amassing the billets for maritime workers to take for jobs. Most of these billets run for 30, 60, or 90 days. ==See also== *Seafarer's professions and ranks *Engine room *Engine department ==Notes and references*Description at WomenOceanographers.org *Job Description at WHOI *Job Description at Human Resources and Skills Development Canada *Job Description at Maritime Industry Authority Philippines Category:Nautical terminology Category:Marine occupations Category:Transport occupations ","title":"Fourth engineer"},{"id":"6206565","text":"Pioneer Days may refer to: *Pioneer Days (Chico, California), an annual community event *Pioneer Days (1930 film), a Mickey Mouse short *Pioneer Days (1940 film), a Western film by Harry S.

The Outer Lands is the prominent terminal moraine archipelagic region off the southern coast of New England in the United States. This eight-county region of Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and New York, comprises the peninsula of Cape Cod and the islands of Martha's Vineyard, the Elizabeth Islands, Nantucket, Block Island, the Narragansett Bay Islands, Staten Island, and Long Island, as well as surrounding islands and islets. Though the existence of an arc or chain of islands in this archipelago is widely acknowledged by geographers, it is rarely given a specific name; occasionally a descriptive term such as southern New England islands or a technical term such as Cape Cod/Long Island ecoregion or Long Island-Cape Cod Coastal Lowland is used. The Isles of Stirling was the name granted in 1635 when the islands came into the possession of William Alexander, 1st Earl of Stirling. \\"Outer Lands\\" is a term popularized by author Dorothy Sterling in her 1967 natural history guide of the same name, and used by later natural history authors such as Patrick J. Lynch. ==Divisions== The Massachusetts section is often called the \\"Cape and Islands\\", with the \\"Islands\\" subregion very specifically referring to Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket, and other smaller islands in Dukes and Nantucket counties. Long Island is often informally considered a part of the \\"New York islands\\", together with Staten Island and Manhattan. These islands are geographically contiguous with the broader region. (The insular Massachusetts sections were actually part of the Province of New York for most of the late 17th century.) Other islands in Long Island Sound and Rhode Island Sound are also included often. Rarely, Sandy Hook in New Jersey is included. ==Geology== The Outer Lands forms the insular northeasternmost extension of North America's Atlantic coastal plain. The islands of the Outer Lands were formed of terminal moraines deposited on a series of cuestas by the recession of the Laurentide Ice Sheet during the Wisconsin glaciation. Some of the islands are included in the archipelago due to proximity, despite key geological differences, such as Manhattan, actually part of the Manhattan Prong. The islands are separated from the mainland by a series of bays and sounds that used to make up Lake Connecticut, Lake Narragansett, and other glacial lakes. ==Ecology== For eastern Long Island and areas east, the region is designated Environmental Protection Agency ecoregion 84 for the Atlantic coastal pine barrens, with the majority 84a for \\"Cape Cod/Long Island\\", and along the Long Island south shore 84c for \\"Barrier Islands/Coastal Marshes\\". Western Long Island and along the north shore is largely 59g for \\"Long Island Sound Coastal Lowland\\", a part of the broader Northeastern Coastal Zone. The region is designated the \\"Long Island-Cape Cod Coastal Lowland\\", Major Land Resource Area 149B, by the United States Department of Agriculture, which also includes Staten Island. ==Culture== The region has historically had a strong maritime culture, with an emphasis on fishing. From eastern Long Island east, much of the region has in recent decades taken on a summer colony character. ==See also== *Outer Barrier Islands *Thimble Islands *Narragansett Bay *Cape and Islands *New York Islands *Sandy Hook, New Jersey ==References== Category:Archipelagoes of the Atlantic Ocean Category:Coastal islands of Massachusetts Category:Islands of New York (state) Category:Islands of Rhode Island Category:Islands of Dukes County, Massachusetts Category:Landforms of Long Island Category:Islands of Nantucket County, Massachusetts Category:Geographical neologisms Category:Moraines of the United States Category:Archipelagoes of the United States Category:Geography of New England Category:Coastal islands of Rhode Island ","title":"Outer Lands"},{"id":"6206595","text":"Andres is an unincorporated community in Will County, Illinois, United States.

They were classy – the most they could ever say was > 'softcore'. And the way they did it, they made pretty images that looked > like a Singapore Airlines TV commercial, they had nice fashion, good > photography and nice music. And that way it dresses it up and makes it all > chocolate boxy... I thought okay, the way to do that on a film budget is to > go somewhere exotic.

So even though it was a tiny film, we came > up to Hong Kong and we got all the clothes tailor made for them, so that > they fitted properly. Lamond was also influenced by The World of Suzie Wong (1960), which prompted him to set it in Hong Kong. He intended to make it immediately after Australia After Dark but ended up making The ABC of Love and Sex: Australia Style first. Lamond claims that at one stage George Miller was going to direct but he wanted to take the film in a different direction. Lamond secured investment from Roadshow Pictures, then tried to obtain funding from the government film bodies. They refused, although the AFC offered to loan him $40,000, but Lamond did not want to be beholden to them. He formed a unit trust and sold a hundred units at $1,250 each which people could buy in any number, and the movie was made entirely with private funds.Scott Murray, \\"John Lamond\\", Cinema Papers Oct/Nov 1978 p97-98 Glory Annen was a Canadian actress living in London who was cast in the lead role.

According to Lamond it also sold widely around the world. ==Proposed sequel== Lamond intended to make a sequel, Felicity in the Garden of Pleasures. It was budgeted at $230,000 and the South Australian Film Corporation decided to invest A$100,000. The corporation's director, John Morris, told the board \\"the film would be funny, commercial and R-rated\\". However the decision was much criticised and the SAFC withdrew their investment.

He held office as Commerce Minister and as the head of national parks. He was an ethnic Hutu and originated in Gisenyi prefecture. In 1989, he was appointed the Minister for Trade in the MRND government of Juvénal Habyarimana. In 1994 he became the director of national tourism in the provisional government following Habyarimana's assassination. The former Rwandan minister was collaborating with the Rwanda International Criminal Court (ICTR), which judges those responsible for the 1994 genocide, and had expressed fear for his life for his collaboration with the ICTR. == After the genocide == Shortly thereafter, in the wake of the RPF victory after the Rwandan genocide, Uwilingiyimana fled the country. As of 2005, he was living in Anderlecht, Belgium, a suburb of Brussels. On 10 June 2005 he was accused of complicity in the Rwandan genocide by the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda. The charges included incitement to genocide, complicity in genocide and murder. Following his indictment, Uwilingiyimana met with ICTR officials a number of times from August to November 2005, and provided information later used in the prosecution of other members of the former régime. == Disappearance and death == On 21 November 2005, he disappeared from his home. Three months before his death he provided information to Arusha (Tanzania), the seat of the UN Court, which judges all those responsible for the Rwandan genocide. Two members of the ICTR repeatedly interrogated the Rwandan politician, who was responsible for the massacre of 4,200 Rwandans. Uwilingiyimana's confessions allowed him to reduce part of his sentence, according to an agreement he had reached with the court. The last interrogation with the ICTR took place just three days before disappearing under harsh circumstances, his wife reported his disappearance.https://elpais.com/diario/2005/12/24/internacional/1135378814_850215.html In response to his death, ICTR Prosecutor Hassan Bubacar Jallow issued a statement indicating that \\"this individual, although an indictee of the Tribunal, voluntarily agreed to cooperate in the search for truth and justice for the Rwanda genocide of 1994. I convey my sincere condolences to his family.\\" The Chief Investigator of the ICTR, Stephen Rapp, inquired that the last meeting with Uwilingiyimana took place three days before his disappearance. One week after his disappearance a letter appeared by Uwilingiyimana. In the letter dated November 5, 2005, Uwilingiyimana addresses the prosecutor of the ICTR. It has him saying that he will no longer deal with the ICTR regarding the genocide. The letter also said that he was being told to give false information in order to incriminate others and that Rapps Canadian investigators had threatened to kill him and cut his body in pieces if he did not give the false testimony he required. This included certain members of the Akazu, and the leadership of the MRND. On December 23, 2005, his badly mangled body was found floating in a canal in Brussels. It could have been a message: no one messes with the “family”, even if you are part of it.https://www.newtimes.co.rw/section/read/3825 His body was so decomposed that DNA evidence was required to identify it. His hands had also been severed from his body. Although, the ICTR claims that extra precautions were taken in him releasing any information to them. Uwilingiyimana was not officially indicted by the tribunal until a week after he went missing. Defence counsel at the tribunal demanded that Rapp and the two Canadian police officers be suspended and investigated for involvement in the murder but nothing was done. == References == * Canal body 'was Rwandan minister', 23 December 2005 * ICTR Newsletter December 2005-January 2006, January 2006 Category:1951 births Category:2005 deaths Category:People indicted by the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda Category:Government ministers of Rwanda Category:Hutu people Category:Rwandan expatriates in Belgium Category:Rwandan exiles ","title":"Juvénal Uwilingiyimana"},{"id":"6206708","text":"Anarchist Federation is the name of several organisations: *Anarchist Federation (Britain and Ireland) *Anarchist Federation (France) *Anarchist Federation (Poland) *Italian Anarchist Federation *Iberian Anarchist Federation *Japanese Anarchist Federation *Anarchist Federation (Czech republic and Slovakia) *Mexican Anarchist Federation *Uruguayan Anarchist Federation Category:Anarchist Federations ","title":"Anarchist Federation"},{"id":"6206709","text":"New York State Route 225 (NY 225) is a state highway in the Southern Tier of New York in the United States. It is a loop route off NY 352 that connects the town of Big Flats (near the city of Elmira) and the city of Corning to the hamlet of Caton. The route begins in Big Flats and follows a generally east–west alignment across rural areas to Caton, where it turns to run in a north–south direction toward Corning. Development along the highway increases once it enters the Corning suburb of South Corning, and the rest of the route serves residential neighborhoods in South Corning and Corning. NY 225 is two lanes wide for its entire length; however, part of the highway in South Corning also has a center turn lane. The Caton–Corning segment of the route was acquired by the state of New York in 1911 and designated as part of NY 44 (now NY 414) as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. It received its current designation in 1949 when NY 414 was truncated to begin in Corning. The highway leading east from Caton to Big Flats was county- maintained from the 1930s through the 1970s, even though it had been part of NY 13 from the 1930 renumbering to the 1940s. The state of New York assumed maintenance of the highway by 1986, and the new state highway became an extension of NY 225\\\\. ==Route description== NY 225 begins at an intersection with NY 352 (West Water Street) in a residential area of the town of Big Flats, located west of the city of Elmira in southwest Chemung County. It heads southwest as the two-lane Hendy Creek Road to the Chemung River, which it crosses by way of the Fitch Bridge. On the opposite riverbank, NY 225 passes through the community of Golden Glow Heights as it turns to follow a more westerly routing into substantially less developed parts of the town. Over the next , the route meanders along the Big Flats–Southport town line while running along the base of a narrow, remote valley surrounding Hendy Creek. Along the way, the highway meets the north end of County Route 36 (CR 36, named Dutch Hill Road). The creek valley ultimately leads to the Chemung–Steuben county line, where NY 225 becomes known as Hendy Hollow Road. NY 225 northbound in Caton Across the county line in the town of Caton, NY 225 continues west through the gully for another , slowly rising in elevation as it heads past a small number of isolated homes. The creek reaches its source near NY 225's junction with the southern terminus of CR 34 (Whiskey Creek Road), at which point the route ascends out of the valley and heads southwest across lightly developed, relatively level terrain to the small hamlet of Caton. In the center of the community, NY 225 intersects CR 32 (Caton–Seeley Creek Road) and CR 120 (Tannery Creek Road). NY 225 turns northwest at this intersection, becoming Caton Road as it follows Caton Creek out of the hamlet. The change in direction brings the route into another rural valley, which follows a winding, generally northward course for . As the highway runs along the gully, it meets CR 40A (West Caton Road) at a junction just south of the Caton–Corning town line and the north end of CR 34 at an intersection a half- mile (0.8 km) north of the boundary. The Caton Creek valley eventually gives way to more open terrain as NY 225 re-approaches the Chemung River and reenters its surrounding valley. Here, the route transitions from a rural highway to a residential street as it enters the riverside village of South Corning. Caton Road terminates at the center of the village, with the route following a northeastward alignment for its last few blocks. NY 225 turns northwestward onto Park Avenue at this point, following the right-of-way established by River Road, a highway designated as CR 44 east of the village limits. As Park Avenue, NY 225 is initially a two-lane road with a center turn lane. The route parallels the Chemung River to the Corning city line, where the center turn lane ends and the highway reverts to a two-lane undivided road. Within the city limits, NY 225 continues to serve mostly residential neighborhoods while traversing the southeastern part of the city. The route proceeds to the eastern edge of downtown Corning, at which point it veers north onto Conhocton Street. NY 225 ends just one block later at an intersection with Denison Parkway (NY 352). The of NY 225 within Corning are maintained by the city, while the rest of the route is maintained by the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT). ==History== NY 225 northbound in South Corning The roadway leading north from Caton to the Corning city line was originally improved to state highway standards under a contract awarded by the state of New York on April 5, 1910. Reconstruction of the highway cost $71,092 (equivalent to $ in ), and the rebuilt road was added to the state highway system on December 21, 1911, as unsigned State Highway 850 (SH 850). In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, SH 850 became the southernmost portion of the new NY 44, a route continuing north through the city of Corning to the Wayne County village of Wolcott. At the same time, the road extending east from Caton to the town of Big Flats outside of Elmira became part of an extended NY 13. NY 44 was renumbered as NY 414 to eliminate duplication with the newly designated U.S. Route 44. Most of NY 13 between Caton and Big Flats was county-maintained as part of CR 120 in Steuben County and as CR 7 in Chemung County. East of the Fitch Bridge, however, the road had been state-maintained since 1912 as part of SH 946. In the early 1940s, NY 13 was truncated on its southern end to downtown Elmira, leaving the Caton–Big Flats highway without a signed state route designation. The county- maintained parts of the road remained designated as CR 120 in Steuben County and CR 7 in Chemung County, while the short state-owned segment in Big Flats eventually became part of an unsigned reference route extending from Golden Glow Heights Drive to Water Street (modern NY 352). NY 414 was truncated on January 1, 1949, to begin in downtown Corning. Its former routing from Caton to Corning was redesignated as NY 225 as part of the change. On April 1, 1980, ownership and maintenance of CR 120 east of NY 225 in Caton was transferred from Steuben County to the state of New York as part of a highway maintenance swap between the two levels of government. All of CR 7 in Chemung County was also transferred to the state sometime after 1978. The Caton–Big Flats roadway, now state-maintained along its entire length, became an eastward extension of NY 225 by 1986. ==Major intersectionsSee also== *List of county routes in Chemung County, New York ==References 225 Category:Transportation in Chemung County, New York Category:Transportation in Steuben County, New York ","title":"New York State Route 225"},{"id":"6206719","text":"Celebrity Deathmatch is a fighting and professional wrestling video game by American studio Big Ape Productions to Mortal Kombat style based on the MTV series of the same name.

He was previously the Stampeders' head coach and played quarterback for fifteen professional seasons in the CFL and National Football League. Prior to his hiring to the Stampeders on December 3, 2007, he was the offensive coordinator of the New York Giants of the NFL. ==Playing career== Hufnagel was an All- American at Penn State University in 1972, where he was the starting quarterback for three seasons with a 26–3 record under head coach Joe Paterno. As a junior, he was instrumental in the Nittany Lions' 30–6 Cotton Bowl victory in Dallas over the University of Texas. He led a backfield which included Franco Harris and Lydell Mitchell and Penn State finished 11–1, fifth in the final AP poll. In 1972, Hufnagel became the first Nittany Lion quarterback to pass for more than 2,000 yards in a season. His 2,039 passing yards set Penn State's single-season record for passing yards (since broken) and he remains among the top 10 in most major career passing categories. He finished sixth in the Heisman Trophy voting that year, won by Johnny Rodgers of Nebraska, (and won the following year by Penn State running back John Cappelletti). Hufnagel's final game as a collegian was the Sugar Bowl in New Orleans, a 14–0 shutout loss to the University of Oklahoma on New Year's Eve. Without Cappelletti due to the flu, the Penn State running game was weak and the Sooner defense dominated the game. A 14th-round selection (348th overall) of the Denver Broncos in the 1973 NFL Draft, Hufnagel spent three seasons with the Broncos, then twelve more in the Canadian Football League with the Calgary Stampeders Saskatchewan Roughriders (1980–1983, 1987), and Winnipeg Blue Bombers ==Coaching careerCanadian Football League=== Hufnagel began his coaching career as a player-coach for the Canadian Football League's Saskatchewan Roughriders in 1987. From 1990–1996 Hufnagel was the offensive coordinator for the Calgary Stampeders, where he helped future Pro Bowlers Doug Flutie and Jeff Garcia earn All-CFL honors. ===Arena Football League=== In 1997, Hufnagel became head coach and general manager of the Arena Football League’s New Jersey Red Dogs. In two seasons there, he posted a 17–11 record. ===National Football League=== After two seasons (1999, 2000) as the quarterbacks coach for the Cleveland Browns, Hufnagel was named the quarterbacks coach of the Indianapolis Colts, where he coached Peyton Manning to a 62.7 percent completion percentage and for 4,131 yards passing. He spent the 2002 season as the quarterbacks coach on Tom Coughlin’s staff in Jacksonville. That year, quarterback Mark Brunell threw only seven interceptions in 416 pass attempts, and an 85.7 quarterback rating. He spent the 2003 season with the Super Bowl champion New England Patriots. Under Hufnagel's tutelage, Tom Brady earned a second Super Bowl MVP award, completing 60.2 percent of his passes for 3,620 yards and 23 touchdowns. Hufnagel became the offensive coordinator of the New York Giants in 2004, and molded them into one of the NFL's most potent offenses. Tiki Barber set a franchise rushing record two years in a row, and the Giants became only the fifth team in NFL history to have five different players score at least seven touchdowns. (Tiki Barber, Jeremy Shockey, Plaxico Burress, Amani Toomer and Brandon Jacobs). While Hufnagel is credited with the rapid development of quarterback Eli Manning, he is sometimes criticized for his often predictable play-calling and an inability to utilize his offensive play-makers effectively. During the 2006 season, Hufnagel came under much criticism for being too pass-happy and abandoning the running game after the Giants trailed during games. In addition, he was also questioned for having Manning throw the ball the third and sixth most passes in the league over 2005 and 2006 despite Tiki Barber clearly being the best player on offense. In addition, his situational play-calling came under scrutiny, such as when running back Brandon Jacobs was removed from the game inside the five yard-line in two games, thus making the offense more predictable to opposing defenses. Following a 30–7 defeat by the New Orleans Saints, Hufnagel was stripped of his duties as offensive coordinator. A week later, it was revealed he was fired. ===Return to the CFL === On December 3, 2007, Hufnagel was hired as the head coach and general manager of the Calgary Stampeders. In his first season, he led the Stampeders to the Grey Cup title with a 22–14 victory over the Montreal Alouettes on November 23. For his performance in the 2008 CFL season, he was awarded the Annis Stukus Trophy as the CFL's coach of the year. Hufnagel got the Stamps back to the Grey Cup game to conclude the 2012 CFL season. The Stampeders lost the 100th Grey Cup game to the Toronto Argonauts 35-22. In the 2013 CFL season, Hufnagel and the Stampeders finished the season in 1st place with a 14-4 record. They lost the Western Final to Saskatchewan. The following season, Hufnagel led the Stampeders to a 15-3 record, finishing first in the Western division and in the league. In the playoffs, the Calgary Stampeders faced the Edmonton Eskimos (who previously eliminated Saskatchewan) and defeated them 43-18, leading them to Calgary's second Grey Cup in three years. They would face the Hamilton Tiger-Cats in the 102nd Grey Cup and win the game 20-16 for Calgary's seventh Grey Cup championship. Following the Stampeder's championship season of 2014, Hufnagel was awarded the Annis Stukus Trophy as the CFL coach of the year for the second time in his career. Later, Hufnagel announced he would step down as head coach after the following season to concentrate on his general manager duties, and named offensive coordinator and former Stamps quarterback Dave Dickenson as his successor. He is the second-winningest coach in Stampeders history, trailing only Wally Buono. He is also the ninth-winningest coach in CFL history, and has the most wins of any coach who spent his entire career with just one team. ===CFL coaching record=== {  style=\\"font-size: 95%; text-align:center;\\" - ! rowspan=\\"2\\"Team !! rowspan=\\"2\\"Year !! colspan=\\"5\\"Regular season !! colspan=\\"4\\"Post season - !Won!!Lost!!Ties!!Win %!!Finish!!

Little is known about his life, aside from his short term as Governor during the turbulent early days of company rule. When the rule of Gabriel Milan, and his imprisonment of former Governor Adolph Esmit had become a problem for the Danish West India Company in 1686, it was decided that Mikkelsen was to be sent as a commissioner to settle the difficulties.Westergaard, West Indies, 37 Mikkelsen left Copenhagen on 15 October 1685, arriving fully armed on 24 February 1686 on board the same Fortuna that had brought Milan to St. Thomas.

A three-day parley followed, as Mikkelsen attempted to negotiate with an armed Milan. Finally, after making it clear to Milan that his actions could cause him to be held liable for rebellion, and that his mean were leaving him, Mikkelsen managed to talk him to returning to Copenhagen.

The diocese was created in 1970 from portions of the adjoining dioceses of Alabama and Florida. Its territory encompasses the southern third of Alabama and the Florida Panhandle region, west of the Appalachicola River. Most of its churches are located in the Mobile, Alabama area and in a population strip along the Gulf of Mexico extending from Pensacola to Panama City, Florida; most of the remaining churches are located in Alabama, typically in towns with greater than 10,000 population.http://www.diocgc.org/congregations/ Historically, the diocese's congregations have favored low, or evangelical, churchmanship, with a generally more conservative theological and cultural tone than the Episcopal Church nationally. Diocesan offices are located in Pensacola, while the cathedral is Christ Church Cathedral in Mobile, making it one of only a few dioceses in the Episcopal Church where the diocesan offices and cathedral are located in different cities and the only diocese in which they are located in different states. ==A Brief History== The Diocese of the Central Gulf Coast was organized in 1970 by combining the southern part of the Diocese of Alabama and the western section of the Diocese of Florida. In both the Diocese of Alabama and that of Florida, the problems of adequately caring for parishes had become greater over time as congregations in Mobile and Pensacola, at the far edge of each diocese, had grown. Bishops George Murray (Alabama) and E. Hamilton West (Florida) agreed that joining the southern counties of Alabama with the western portion of the Diocese of Florida was the best solution to the problem. Meeting at Christ Church, Pensacola, on December 3–5, 1970, the Primary Convention of the new diocese adopted canons and elected officers with the Right Reverend George Murray becoming the first bishop of the Diocese of the Central Gulf Coast. In 1971 the new diocese included 25 parishes and 32 missions along with Beckwith Camp & Conference Center, a camp and conference center located on Weeks Bay on the Alabama Gulf Coast and Wilmer Hall Children’s Home in Mobile. The new diocesan offices at Wilmer Hall opened in January 1971. For 10 years Bishop Murray traveled throughout the diocese shepherding his flock, providing steady leadership during a period of great change in the Episcopal Church, not the least being the adoption of a new prayer book and the ordination of women. In 1979, shortly after celebrating the 25th anniversary of his consecration as Bishop, he announced to the Standing Committee his intention to retire. Meeting at St. Paul’s, Mobile on November 14–15, 1980, a special convention of the Diocese elected the Rev. Charles Farmer Duvall, from South Carolina, to succeed Bishop Murray. The new bishop was ordained on April 11, 1981, in the Field House of the University of West Florida before 2,500 people who had gathered to witness and celebrate the consecration. From Bishop Duvall’s ordination in 1981 the Diocese grew steadily. In 1981, for example, the Diocese counted 57 churches including 25 parishes. Twenty years later when Bishop Duvall retired, the Diocese had grown to 38 parishes and 25 missions. In addition to being an owning diocese of the University of the South, Sewanee, Tennessee, the Diocese owns and supports three other institutions for ministry: Beckwith Camp & Conference Center, near Fairhope, Alabama and Wilmer Hall Children’s Home and Murray House Assisted Living Facility, both in Mobile. The budget reflects that growth, increasing from $229,370 in 1981 to $1,992,114 in 2001. Several major programs were launched during Bishop Duvall’s tenure, including the Companion Diocese relationship with Guatemala and an annual medical mission to Guatemala; the Kairos prison ministry; and Happening for young people. Meanwhile, the Cursillo program which began under Bishop Murray continued to thrive. To improve access for the far-flung parishes of the Central Gulf Coast and enable the Bishop and his staff to better serve the people, the diocesan offices were relocated to downtown Pensacola in 1989. During Bishop Duvall’s episcopate, two successful fund drives raised money to enhance the capability of the Diocese to serve the people. The first, Venture in Mission, launched in 1983, raised $1.5 million, part of which financed construction of the Chapel of the Resurrection at Beckwith Camp & Conference Center. The second, Fulfilling the Vision, initiated in 1994 raised more than $2.5 million including $1 million for a conference building and a new motel-type building at Beckwith; $1,025,000 for new church development; and $325,000 set aside for continuing education in a \\"Vocations in Ministry\\" fund for continuing education for both clergy and laypeople. On September 30, 1999, Bishop Duvall called for the election of a successor bishop. After a year-long search process, meeting at St. Stephen’s in Brewton, Alabama, on January 6, 2001, a special convention of the Diocese elected the Very Rev. Philip Menzie Duncan, II, dean of St. Matthew’s Cathedral in Dallas, Texas, to succeed Bishop Duvall. The new bishop was ordained on May 12, 2001, at the Pensacola Civic Center, witnessed by a congregation of over 2,500 people. In 2015, Russell Kendrick, a native of the diocese whose first appointment as priest had been in the diocese, was elected as the fourth bishop. ==The Seal of the Diocese of the Central Gulf Coast== Image:Central Gulf Coast Shield.png To represent the Gulf Coast itself, an anchor, representing \\"hope\\" which played a large part in theformation of the new diocese, was placed against a background of water which consists of seven wavy bars alternating gold and blue. To raise the Christian symbolism to a more confident degree than merely that of hope, the dove of peace transcends below a bishop’s miter between two St. Andrew’s crosses and directly above the anchor as the \\"unifying chief\\" which will continue its reign over the anchor. With the diocese extending into the lower portion of Alabama and the upper portion of Florida, two St. Andrew’s crosses were used to represent the heritage of Alabama and Florida, both of which have the St. Andrew’s cross as a predominant symbol on their state flags. Also, with the cross of St. Andrew being a Christian symbol, it makes a unique attribute of representing at once the Church and the two states. Since the diocese was formed from two older areas, the new union was symbolized by placing the two crosses of St. Andrew side by side in a single field, the \\"chief\\" of the shield. The shield was designed by Professor James Waring McCardy of the University of the South, Sewanee, who is recognized as a top authority on ecclesiastical heraldry in America. ==List of bishops== {  style=\\"width: 95%;\\" - ! colspan=\\"4\\" style=\\"background- color: #7F1734; color: white;\\"  Bishops of the Central Gulf Coast - ! style=\\"background-color: #D4B1BB; width: 10%;\\"  From ! style=\\"background- color: #D4B1BB; width: 10%;\\"  Until ! style=\\"background-color: #D4B1BB; width: 33%;\\"  Incumbent ! style=\\"background-color: #D4B1BB; width: 42%;\\"  Notes - valign=\\"top\\" style=\\"background-color: white;\\"  style=\\"text-align: center;\\"  1970  style=\\"text-align: center;\\"  1981  George M.

It is also referred to as a \\"fusion inhibitor.\\" * Ibalizumab, a monoclonal antibody that binds to domain 2 of CD4 and interferes with post-attachment steps required for the entry of HIV-1 virus particles into host cells and prevents the viral transmission that occurs via cell-cell fusion. * Bulevirtide binds to and inactivates the sodium/bile acid cotransporter, preventing both hepatitis D and hepatitis B from entering hepatocytes. ==Investigational agents== Other agents are under investigation for their ability to interact with the proteins involved in HIV entry and the possibility that they may serve as entry inhibitors.Merck Manual.com Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Infection Table 4 * Leronlimab, a monoclonal antibody that binds CCR5 * Fostemsavir (BMS-663068), an attachment inhibitor that interferes with the interaction of CD4 and gp120 by binding with it. * Plerixafor was being developed to interfere with interaction between HIV and CXCR4, but showed little useful antiviral activity in recent trials. * Epigallocatechin gallate, a substance found in green tea, appears to interact with gp120 as do several other theaflavins. * Vicriviroc, similar to maraviroc, is currently undergoing clinical trials for FDA approval. * Aplaviroc, an agent similar to maraviroc and vicriroc. Clinical trials were halted in 2005 over concerns about the drug's safety. * b12 is an antibody against HIV found in some long-term nonprogressors. It has been found to bind to gp120 at the exact region, or epitope, where gp120 binds to CD4. b12 seems to serve as a natural entry inhibitor in some individuals. It is hoped that further study of b12 may lead to an effective HIV vaccine. * Griffithsin, a substance derived from algae, appears to have entry inhibitor properties. * DCM205, is a small molecule based on L-chicoric acid, an integrase inhibitor. DCM205 has been reported to inactivate HIV-1 particles directly in vitro and is thought to act primarily as an entry inhibitor. * CD4 specific Designed Ankyrin Repeat Proteins (DARPins) potently block viral entry of diverse strains and are being developed and studied as potential microbicide candidates * A polyclonal caprine antibody is in phase II human clinical trials that targets, among others sites, the GP41 transmembrane glycoprotein. The trials are being conducted by Virionyx, a New Zealand Company. * VIR-576 is a synthesized peptide which binds to gp41, preventing fusion of the virus with a cell membrane. * ITX5061 for hepatitis C. == References  External links == * Fusion Inhibitor Resource Center * ","title":"Entry inhibitor"},{"id":"6206761","text":"Super Women is an Italian fictional superhero comic book character, created by Clelia Ferrario and Renato Frascoli in 1966 for a comic book of the same name.

Robinson, a former mathematics teacher at Peekskill Military Academy (now also defunct), and his brother-in- law, Carleton Witham. The relationship with the local town was poor from the start, and in 1948 the school moved to Cold Spring Hills on Long Island, New York, until the school closed in 1979. ==History== At its new location, the school was based in one of the largest mansions ever constructed in the United States, Oheka Castle, built by Otto Kahn, a multimillionaire. Following Kahn's death in 1934, his heirs had little interest in the estate, and the town of Huntington briefly used it as a retirement home for municipal employees. EMA was organized for most of its existence as a battalion, with a band company, troop (using horses stabled a few miles away), two infantry companies of high school and junior high school students, a company of children sixth grade and below, a company of day students, i.e. students who did not board in the school, battalion staff of two to four members, and a four-member color guard. For several years of very high enrollment, the school organized as a regiment. Robinson and Witham died within six weeks of one another in the summer of 1968, leaving the school in the hands of Alice Robinson, who was Robinson's widow and Witham's sister. According to an article in Newsday on September 30, 1968, she was then the first woman ever to head a military academy in the USA. In 1970 she sold the school, without notifying the longtime Dean and new Headmaster, Leopold Hedbavny, or alumni, to three investors. These investors immediately took out a three million dollar bank mortgage, although they had paid Mrs. Robinson only $50,000 plus stock in their new corporation, and stock in several other of the ultimately nine schools they bought. All nine schools were eventually closed following the taking out of large mortgages. In 1955 the Army granted EMA status as an honor Junior ROTC unit. From 1951 to 1968 students ninth grade and up were taken to a military training base, Camp Smith, for a week in May for riflery training and practice. This continued at a base in New Jersey until 1975, the same year the school lost its honor rating. In 1977 the Army struck it from the rolls of recognized Junior ROTC units, and removed all military supplied equipment, mostly M-1 Garand rifles (prior to 1955 cadets used Springfield M1903 rifles). In 1979, enrollment was down to just ninety from a high of over 350. The school closed in 1979 after a fire had been set in the dormitory floors. In the late 1960s, as the school was declining, two groups of disgruntled staff broke away and founded the General Douglas MacArthur Military Academy and the Marine Military Academy. The fire was set in 1976 by a student who was expelled from the school. The fire was set in revenge and could have potentially killed hundreds of people. Fortunately no one was injured. The school took months to repair. Classes were cancelled for days. The culprit was caught and punished. I attended school there at the time it occurred. The fire destroyed letters housed in the main lobby from Presidents Lincoln and Washington. Chris Finnegan-attended 1975-1980 ==Extra-curricular== The school newspaper was called The Guidon. The yearbook was The Saber. The honor society (based on academic grades, military rank, being a class officer, and participation in sports and clubs) was the Order of the Key. At various points the school had a chess club, camera club, glee club, chorus, ham radio, equestrian, swimming, riflery, fencing, basketball, baseball, varsity and junior varsity football teams. EMA also hosted one of the first chapters of the Lions Club to be based in a school. ==Officers== The battalion commander held the rank of Major. On dress uniforms this took five stripes, on uniform of the day a diamond shaped pip on the collar. The battalion adjutant and company commanders were captains (four stripes and three circular pips, the battalion adjutant additionally had four rockers beneath the stripes). Platoon leaders were generally lieutenants (three stripes, first lieutenant had two circular pips, second lieutenants one). A sergeant major, always part of the battalion staff, was the highest ranking \\"noncommissioned\\" rank, and had two stripes with two rockers and a diamond in the center. (Officers were addressed by \\"Sir\\", and were saluted.) Each company would generally have a first sergeant, with two stripes and a diamond. Each platoon would have a sergeant, with two stripes. Corporals would also have two stripes, but wear them very low on the sleeve instead of high on the shoulder. Private First Class (\\"PFC\\") was awarded to any lowest ranking cadet (privates) who went a full month with fewer than ten demerits, which was also the limit for higher ranking cadets to be advanced in rank. Rank was lost for excessive demerits, one rank for the first fifteen in a month, and an additional rank for each additional ten demerits. In parades, officers and the sergeant major carried a saber, first sergeants carried a carbine, two members of the color guard carried the American flag and the school flag, the band had their instruments, the troop their horses, and the infantry companies and older day students carried a rifle. ==Uniforms== Uniforms worn by cadets followed the style of the United States Military Academy at West Point. Shoes were black, and loafers were not permitted. Socks had to be black (medical exceptions allowed). The \\"uniform of the day\\" for all cadets included gray pants with a black stripe on each leg. The belt was black with a brass buckle that had to be kept polished. A gray long-sleeved shirt had a shield shaped patch on the right shoulder. This was the emblem of EMA, an open book atop a vertical saber, hilt down. The collars had indicia of which company each cadet was attached to, a harp for the band, cross sabers for the troop, and crossed rifles for all others. Officers had \\"pips\\" to indicate rank on the right collar, one circular pip for second lieutenant, two for first lieutenant, and three for captains. The cadet major had a single diamond shaped pip. A black tie completed the ensemble. It did not hang freely, but was tucked into the shirt between the second and third buttons. On Sundays and for some other occasions cadets wore a \\"choker\\" instead of the shirt and tie. This was a gray jacket with a high collar. Rank was shown by stripes on both shoulders. For parades and other very formal occasions such as dances and the graduation ceremony cadets wore a jacket known as a 44 for the brass buttons on it. These had to be kept polished. The 44 had the usual stripes for rank, plus cadets had any ribbons awarded them, as well as riflery medals. These medals were the ones used by the United States military for marksman, sharpshooter and expert. ==Awards== Cadets who maintained an academic average of 85 or better, with no grades below 80, were eligible for the honor roll. Good conduct (fewer than 10 demerits in a month), participation in sports or other activities such as the school newspaper or yearbook, library duty, switchboard, various clubs, all earned various ribbons. The troop tended to have the most, as participation in horseshows drew anywhere from first to sixth place in events with an appropriate ribbon. Having the highest or second highest grade point average at the conclusion of tenth, eleventh or twelfth grade also got a ribbon, as did highest grades in the various foreign languages (French, German, Latin, and Spanish), history, math, and science. ==Discipline== Demerits were accessed on a sliding scale. Shoes not shined, belt buckle not shined, uncombed hair, and similar offenses drew a single demerit. Having a messy or dirty dormitory room could draw from one to five demerits, depending on the severity of the offense. Failure to do homework was three demerits. Direct disobedience to orders, disrespect and similar offense were three demerits to a non-commissioned officer (corporal or sergeant), five to an officer, and ten demerits to a teacher or other staff member. Off limits was ten demerits. Demerits had to be marched off, one hour of marching with a rifle for one demerit, and two hours were set aside for this on weekdays (cadets not involved had sports teams, clubs or other activities), or could be worked off. More than six unresolved demerits meant \\"military restriction\\", i.e. the cadet was not eligible for a weekend pass, and had to work off the demerits on the weekend instead. Matching this was \\"academic detention\\", with the same lack of a weekend pass. It usually indicated either a failing grade in some subject or failure to turn in an assignment. The elimination of both military restriction and academic detention in 1975 accelerated the school's rapid decline. ==Notable== For a few years EMA had an armored unit based on some surplus Armored Personnel Carriers. Operating these when gasoline prices began rising became prohibitively expensive, and two were given to the New York City police department. One was allegedly buried on the school grounds. At the funeral of President John F. Kennedy the riderless horse following Kennedy's caisson bore a saber from EMA which had been presented to the White House by the senior class of 1962 on their class visit to Washington. EMA's sabers were engraved with a unique, copyrighted design. ==Alumni association== An alumni association was formed in 1969, and still exists with its own website on Yahoo! Groups, @yahoogroups.com. One of the former EMA cadets, Roger Hall, has written about his memories and about Oheka Castle. ==In fiction== A very thinly disguised version of Eastern Military Academy, Robinson, and others, appears in the science fiction novel Time for Patriots by Thomas Wm. Hamilton, who graduated EMA in 1956 as valedictorian and sergeant major.

He married Elizabeth Perkins (1756-1843), daughter of James Perkins (d. 1773), on November 11, 1773. Her grandfather was the Boston merchant and fur trader Thomas Handasyd Peck, under whom Sturgis apprenticed at age sixteen. Sturgis then worked as a hatter and furrier. Sturgis served as lieutenant of the Boston regiment of the Massachusetts militia in August and September 1778, and from 1787-1792 served under John Johnston as first lieutenant in Boston. Sturgis's brothers-in-law, James Perkins (1761-1822) and Thomas Handasyd Perkins (1765-1854), were notable China traders. In 1795 Sturgis joined them in ownership of a new ship, the Grand Turk, which was sent to Canton in March 1796. When the Perkins brothers opened a branch office in Canton in 1803, Sturgis invested substantially, and three of Sturgis's sons—Henry Sturgis (1790-1819), who died in Macao; George Washington Sturgis (1793-1826), who was in Canton between 1810 and 1823; and James Perkins Sturgis (1791-1851), who arrived in 1809 and died on his voyage home—subsequently voyaged to China. In 1818, all three were involved in the opium trade as partners in the firm of James P. Sturgis and Company. Sturgis was also active in Boston public affairs. From 1790-1796 he was a fire warden; in 1792 he was elected to a committee to assess a smallpox outbreak; and he served as Boston selectman from 1796-1797 and 1799-1802. He represented Boston in the Massachusetts state senate in 1801, and ran unsuccessfully as the Republican candidate for state senator in 1805. Several portraits of Sturgis survive, including two by Gilbert Stuart, painted circa 1806 and in 1822. These portraits are currently in the Memorial Art Gallery of the University of Rochester, and the Worcester Art Museum, respectively. == See also == *Russell Sturgis (1805-1887), his grandson, head of Baring Brothers, London *John Hubbard Sturgis (1834-1888), his great-grandson, architect ==References== Category:1750 births Category:Businesspeople from Boston Category:Massachusetts militiamen in the American Revolution Category:1826 deaths ","title":"Russell Sturgis (1750–1826)"},{"id":"6206769","text":"Tinker Field was an outdoor baseball stadium in Orlando, Florida, United States. Named after Baseball Hall of Famer Joe Tinker, it was located in the West Lakes neighborhoods of Downtown Orlando, adjacent to the Camping World Stadium and one mile west of the Amway Center. In April, 2015 the City of Orlando tore down the grandstands and removed all other extant buildings. Constructed in 1914, Tinker Field was the spring training home of the Brooklyn Dodgers, Cincinnati Reds, Washington Senators, and Minnesota Twins. It was also the home park of the Orlando Rays minor league baseball team before they moved to Cracker Jack Stadium in 2000. It was located directly adjacent to the western side of the Orlando Citrus Bowl Stadium and boasted a capacity of 5,100 before the grandstands were removed in 2015. ==History== The field first saw use for baseball in 1914; the first known stadium built on the site was in 1923. It was all wood construction and seated 1,500. For the next 10 years, the Cincinnati Reds would call Tinker Field their spring training home til 1933. The Brooklyn Dodgers trained there in 1934 and 1935. In 1936 Clark Griffith moved the Washington Senators to Orlando where the Washington Senators/Minnesota Twins would train until after the 1990 season. The stadium was rebuilt again in 1963, and when Griffith Stadium in Washington, D.C. was demolished nearly 1,000 of the stadium's seats were moved to Tinker Field. The remaining seats were sold by the City of Orlando in 2015. The old press box next to the home side dugout was the original press box and can be seen in photographs as early as the 1920s. Tinker Field was added to the United States National Register of Historic Places in 2004. With One of the most historical non-baseball events to take place at Tinker Field was a visit from Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. on March 6, 1964. He spoke before thousands of people from the pitcher's mound in his only public speech in the city. On January 28, 2014, during the groundbreaking of the Orlando Citrus Bowl Stadium reconstruction it was announced that the grandstands and all other extant buildings surrounding Tinker Field would be torn down. The reasons cited were that the expansion of the Orlando Citrus Bowl Stadium would shorten right field so much that it would make it unusable even if it the entire building complex was renovated. On March 9, 2015, Orlando City Council approved an ordinance to demolish the grandstands and buildings, and allocated money to re-create the area surrounding the field. In September, 2015, the City of Orlando held a public input meeting and unveiled preliminary plans to memorialize Tinker Field. Tinker Field History Plaza opened in May 2018, memorializing civil rights and baseball in Orlando. ==Present== Each November, Tinker Field hosts the Electric Daisy Carnival—a two-day festival that features electronic dance music with celebrity DJs, visual effects, rides, and art. On September 6, 2015, Tinker Field was the site of West Lakes Family Fun Day—an event held by members of the neighborhoods surrounding the field prior to the MEAC/SWAC Challenge. Each June or July, Tinker Field hosts the Orlando Vans Warped Tour—a one-day festival that features rock music with popular bands from around the world. ==Gallery== File:Tinker Field original interior.jpgInterior of the original Tinker Field File:Orlando Tinker Field02.jpgUpdated Entry that was added in 1990.

On July 27, 1971, the City of Winnipeg absorbed the R. M. of Charleswood, the R. M. of Fort Garry, the R. M. of North Kildonan, the R. M. of Old Kildonan, the Town of Tuxedo, the City of East Kildonan, the City of West Kildonan, the City of St. Vital, the City of Transcona, the City of St. Boniface, the City of St. James-Assiniboia, the old City of Winnipeg and Metropolitan Corporation of Greater Winnipeg were amalgamated to create a unicity. The first election for the newly combined city was held on October 6, 1971. The City Council consisted of 50 councillors and one mayor. The councillors were elected on the basis of one councillor per city ward while the mayor was elected by the city-at-large. The term of office was three years. The inaugural meeting of the new council took place on January 4, 1972. Since 50 councillors proved too unwieldy the city wards were reduced to 29 in 1977. In 1992 the city wards were reduced even further to the present 15 and city councillors became full-time politicians. On June 22, 2004, Sam Katz was elected as the first Jewish mayor of Winnipeg. He beat out prominent politicians Dan Vandal, Al Golden, and MaryAnn Mihychuk for the job by receiving 42.51% of the vote. This came after the resignation of Glen Murray as mayor of Winnipeg to run in the 2004 federal election. Katz was re- elected to a second term in the 2006 elections on October 25, 2006. After promising in his first election to run for only two terms, Katz ran for a third term in 2010. He was re-elected in the 2010 elections. Brian Bowman, the City's first Aboriginal Mayor, was elected as the 43rd Mayor of the City of Winnipeg in a landslide victory on October 22nd, 2014. Winnipeg is represented in the House of Commons of Canada by eight Members of Parliament. , four are from the Liberal Party of Canada, two are from the Conservative Party of Canada and two are from the New Democratic Party. ==Politics== Manitoba Legislative Building Starting in 1900, in both provincial and federal elections, central Winnipeg elected politicians from the Labour Party. Winnipeg was the site of a general strike from May 15 to June 28, 1919. There were violent protests during this strikes, several deaths at the hands of the Royal Northwest Mounted Police, and the arrest of many of Winnipeg's future politicians. Though it was not chartered until 1932, the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation was born not only out of the depression but also out of the labour unrest of 1919. Its successor, the New Democratic Party, has enjoyed much support in Winnipeg since the early 1960s. Winnipeg's longest- serving Members of Parliament include J.S. Woodsworth (21 years), Stanley Knowles (38 years), David Orlikow (25 years), Bill Blaikie (almost 27 years and re-elected in the 2006 federal election), and Lloyd Axworthy (21 years). Aside from being the provincial capital of Manitoba, Winnipeg has served as the capital for two other Canadian territories: the Northwest Territories from 1870 to 1876 and the District of Keewatin from 1876 to 1905. ==Police and CrimeLaw enforcement=== Winnipeg is policed by the Winnipeg Police Service, which in 2012, had 1,442 police officers.2012 Annual Crime Report, .

Ryan (born October 26, 1953 in Janesville, Wisconsin) is an American professional baseball executive and former general manager for the Minnesota Twins of Major League Baseball. Ryan was known for using a low payroll and building up the minor league system to put up contending teams. He resigned as general manager of the Twins on October 1, 2007 but returned to his former post on November 7, 2011 until being relieved of his duties on July 18, 2016. Ryan was hired as a special assignment scout by the Philadelphia Phillies on November 30, 2016.https://www.google.com/amp/www.philly.com/philly/blogs/sports/phillies/Phillies- hire-former-Twins-GM-Terry-Ryan-as- scout.html%3Famphtml%3Dy?client=safari#scso=uid_WD85DQAF_FUKg85Hsgh3Mg_9:0 ==Early life and career== Ryan attended George S. Parker High School in Janesville, and was drafted in the 35th round by the Minnesota Twins in 1972. ==Playing career== Ryan pitched briefly in the Twins organization in the mid-70s. His playing career started with promise: Ryan posted a 10-0 record and 1.70 ERA in 43 games at Class A Wisconsin Rapids in 1973. However, he subsequently battled injuries and was released by the Twins' AA team in June 1976. ==Administrative career== After graduating from the University of Wisconsin–Madison in 1979, with a degree in physical education, Ryan quickly earned respect as an evaluator of talent in baseball. In 1980, the New York Mets hired him as a scout. He spent six seasons as a scout for the Mets before the Twins again showed interest in him. The team hired him as scouting director, a position he held for six years. He was then promoted to vice president and player personnel director under General Manager Andy MacPhail. When MacPhail left for the Chicago Cubs in 1994, Ryan was chosen to replace him. Ryan's organization relies heavily on constant scouting and analysis of every player in major and minor league baseball. As a result, the team made some startling and at the time questioned acquisitions of players who turned out to be drastically underrated and who became star players in the Twins organization. Ryan had the unenviable task of succeeding MacPhail, architect of the Twins' 1987 and 1991 world champion teams. Ryan would endure losing seasons until 2001, but his trades turned out to have the future in mind. In 2002, the Twins began a sequence of winning their division. His early years as GM had several lowlights. For example, during the 1995 season, he was forced to unload several high-priced veterans when the team was not contending. The unloaded veterans included Rick Aguilera, Scott Erickson, Mark Guthrie, and Kevin Tapani. To make matters worse, the prospects he received in these trades did not pan out. In particular, Scott Klingenbeck and Frank Rodriguez were expected to be solid major league players. Instead, they were busts who did not last in the majors. In 1996, Ryan botched the signing of first baseman Travis Lee during the amateur draft. Lee exploited a never-before used clause that allows a draft pick to become a free agent if a team does not make an offer within 15 days of the draft. After the Twins failed to do this, Lee left for the Arizona Diamondbacks, who gave him a $10 million signing bonus. ===Success as general manager=== Things started looking up for Ryan only a couple of months later, when he traded veteran Dave Hollins to the Seattle Mariners for a player to be named later. On September 30, the Mariners sent David Ortiz to the Twins to complete the trade. Unfortunately for the Twins, Ortiz would not show MVP-caliber numbers until he left the Twins a few years later. Similarly, in August 1997, Ryan unloaded another aging veteran for a future All-Star. This time it was Roberto Kelly for Joe Mays. In 1998, he sent the disgruntled Chuck Knoblauch to the New York Yankees for four players, including two future All-Stars: shortstop Cristian Guzman and pitcher Eric Milton. In 1999, he again unloaded Rick Aguilera and received future starter Kyle Lohse. At the end of the year, he traded for future Cy Young Award winner Johan Santana, who was picked up in the Rule 5 Draft by the Florida Marlins from the Houston Astros. In July 2001, the Twins traded outfielder Matt Lawton to the New York Mets for pitcher Rick Reed. ===Postseason success=== Ryan continued making strong trades that enable the team to remain competitive. For example, in July 2002, he traded little-used outfielder Brian Buchanan (also acquired in the Knoblauch trade) to the San Diego Padres for Jason Bartlett.https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/b/bartlja01.shtml That year, the team made the postseason for the first time since the 1991 World Champion team and defeated the heavily favored Oakland Athletics in the 2002 American League Division Series. After the 2002 season, the Twins organization was named Organization of the Year by Baseball America and SportsTicker, while Ryan was named Executive of the Year by The Sporting News. In 2003, Ryan swapped outfielder Bobby Kielty for accomplished veteran leadoff hitter Shannon Stewart. This move was credited with jump-starting the team and enabling them to repeat as division champions. In November 2003, Ryan sent popular catcher A. J. Pierzynski to the San Francisco Giants, gaining closer Joe Nathan, and starting pitchers Francisco Liriano and Boof Bonser. Another strong trade occurred a month later, when Ryan sent starter Eric Milton to the Philadelphia Phillies for starter Carlos Silva and infielder Nick Punto. His most recent trades affecting the current team were in December 2005, when he received second baseman Luis Castillo from the Florida Marlins for two minor leaguers. He also traded pitcher J.C. Romero to the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim for Alexi Casilla. ===Notable trades=== *July 6, 1995: Traded closer Rick Aguilera to the Boston Red Sox for pitcher Frank Rodriguez and a player to be named later. The Twins were able to re-sign Aguilera on December 11. *July 7, 1995: Traded pitcher Scott Erickson to the Baltimore Orioles for pitcher Scott Klingenbeck and a player to be named later. *July 31, 1995: Traded pitchers Kevin Tapani and Mark Guthrie to the Los Angeles Dodgers for infielder Ron Coomer, pitchers Greg Hansell and José Parra, and a player to be named later. The Dodgers sent outfielder Chris Latham to the Twins on October 30 to complete the trade. *August 29, 1996: Traded Dave Hollins to the Seattle Mariners for a player to be named later. On September 31, the Mariners sent David Ortiz to the Twins to complete the trade. *August 20, 1997: Traded Roberto Kelly to the Seattle Mariners for players to be named later.

He was replaced by assistant general manager Bill Smith, but remained in the Twins organization as a senior adviser. ===Return in November 2011=== On November 7, 2011, Twins owner Jim Pohlad fired Smith after a 99-loss season - the first time that the Twins had fired a general manager since relocating from Washington, D.C.. Ryan, who had remained with the team in a consultant role since stepping down as GM after the season, returned to the job, officially on an interim basis. On October 6, 2012, Ryan announced that he had removed the \\"interim\\" from his title and would return as Minnesota's long-term general manager for the 2013 season.TwinCites.com, 2012-10-06 On Monday, February 10, 2014 Ryan revealed that he had been diagnosed with and is being treated for carcinoma, and would miss spring training. ===2016 Firing=== Ryan was relieved of his General Manager duties July 18, 2016. Assistant GM Rob Antony took over as interim general manager. In joining the Phillies as a scout in November 2016, Ryan was reunited with Andy MacPhail, the Phillies' president/baseball operations since October 2015. ==Honors and awards== After he retired as general manager in 2007, Play Ball! Minnesota—sponsored by the Minnesota Twins Community Fund—renamed its highest honor, the \\"Play Ball!

It measures approximately 459 kilometers in diameter and was named after Italian astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli, known for his observations of the Red Planet and his mistranslated term \\"canali\\". The name was adopted by IAU's Working Group for Planetary System Nomenclature in 1973. == Description == A crater within Schiaparelli shows many layers that may have formed by the wind, volcanoes, or deposition under water. Layers can be a few meters thick or tens of meters thick. Recent research on these layers suggests that ancient climate change on Mars, caused by regular variation in the planet's tilt, may have caused the patterns in layers. On Earth, similar changes (astronomical forcing) of climate results in ice-age cycles. The regular appearance of rock layers suggests that regular changes in climate may be the root cause. Regular changes in climate may be due to variations of a planet's tilt (called obliquity). The tilt of the Earth's axis changes by only a little more than 2 degrees since our moon is relatively large. In contrast Mars's tilt varies by tens of degrees. When the tilt is low (current situation on Mars), the poles are the coldest places on the planet, while the equator is the warmest (as on Earth). This could cause gases in the atmosphere, like water and carbon dioxide, to migrate poleward, where they would freeze. When the obliquity is higher, the poles receive more sunlight, causing those materials to migrate away. When carbon dioxide moves from the Martian poles, the atmospheric pressure increases, possibly causing a difference in the ability of winds to transport and deposit sand. Also, with more water in the atmosphere sand grains may stick and cement together to form layers.http://www.spaceref.com:80/news/viewpr.html.pid=27101 ==Gallery== Image:Schiaparelli basin crater.jpgLayers in a crater in the Schiaparelli basin as seen by MGS.

At the western terminus, upon crossing the Red River, the roadway continues westward as state highways numbered 200 all the way to Idaho. Minnesota State Highway 200 is the eastern end of a nationwide chain of similarly numbered state highways that stretch from Minnesota to Idaho. The route runs across Minnesota from west to east; connecting Ada, Mahnomen, Walker, and Floodwood. ==Route description== Highway 200 serves as an east- west route in northwest and northeast Minnesota between Halstad, Ada, Mahnomen, Walker, Remer, Hill City, and Floodwood. Highway 200 parallels U.S. Highway 2 throughout its route For part of its route (8-miles), Highway 200 is concurrent with Highway 371 through the city of Walker. Highway 200 also runs together with U.S. Highway 71 for in Hubbard County between the town of Kabekona and Itasca State Park. Highway 200 passes through the following forests: *Savanna State Forest in northern Aitkin County *Hill River State Forest in northern Aitkin County *Chippewa National Forest in Cass County *Paul Bunyan State Forest in Hubbard County *White Earth State Forest in Clearwater and Mahnomen counties Highway 200 crosses the Mississippi River twice. Once at Jacobson in northeast Aitkin County, and once near Itasca State Park in southeast Clearwater County. Itasca State Park is located on Highways 200 and 71 at the headwaters of the Mississippi River. The north park entrance is located on Highways 92 / 200 between Park Rapids and Bagley. Highway 200 is also known as Minnesota Avenue in Walker and Main Street in Remer. ==History== Highway 200 was designated and signed circa 1969 as part of a link of state routes numbered 200 stretching from Minnesota to Idaho. The route in Minnesota was previously numbered: *State Highway 116 (from the North Dakota state line to U.S. 75.) *State Highway 31 (from U.S. 75, later the North Dakota state line to State Highway 92; later extended to Highway 371 near Walker.) *State Highway 92 (from the intersection of present-day Highways 92 and 200 to U.S. 71; then later extended to Highway 371 near Walker.) *State Highway 85 (from U.S. 71 to Highway 371 near Walker.) *State Highway 34 (from Highway 371 at Walker to U.S. 2, west of Floodwood.) The route was mostly gravel in 1940, mostly paved by 1953, and completely paved by 1960. ==Major intersectionsReferences== 200 Category:Transportation in Norman County, Minnesota Category:Transportation in Mahnomen County, Minnesota Category:Transportation in Clearwater County, Minnesota Category:Transportation in Hubbard County, Minnesota Category:Transportation in Cass County, Minnesota Category:Transportation in Aitkin County, Minnesota ","title":"Minnesota State Highway 200"},{"id":"6206799","text":"A second engineer or first assistant engineer is a licensed member of the engineering department on a merchant vessel. This title is used for the person on a ship responsible for supervising the daily maintenance and operation of the engine department. They report directly to the chief engineer.Requirements for First Assistant Engineer On a merchant vessel, depending on term usage, \\"the First\\" or \\"the Second\\" is the marine engineer second in command of the engine department after the ship's chief engineer. Due to the supervisory role this engineer plays, in addition to being responsible for the refrigeration systems, main engines (steam/gas turbine, diesel), and any other equipment not assigned to the third engineer or fourth engineer(s), he is typically the busiest engineer aboard the ship. If the engine room requires 24/7 attendance and other junior engineers can cover the three watch rotations, the first is usually a \\"day worker\\" from 0800-1700, with overtime hours varying according to ship/company. The second engineer is usually in charge of preparing the engine room for arrival, departure, or standby and oversees major overhauls on critical equipment. == Duties and functions == The main duty of a second engineer on board a ship is to schedule and direct maintenance inside the engine room. As the chief may not be able to be in the engine room every day, due to paperwork or meetings, it is the second engineer's responsibility to report on the plant conditions and needs. A second engineer has to be familiar with their ships systems, repair schedules, and test results obtained from oil or water samples. Each day tasks are typically distributed by the second engineer on what needs to be maintained within the plant and advice is typically given as the second engineer is the most senior engineer on day work. Tasks are typically given in order of seniority or necessity, such as officers receiving more important jobs while non-licensed members receiving a more tedious job. Because of being the most senior engineer on day work, the second engineer must have knowledge of basic systems and be able to work out of technical guides to be able to upkeep machinery to manufacturers specifications. The first engineer may stand a watch if it is the ship’s protocol or in the event of a manned engine room. With modern technology many engine rooms have become unmanned, but the second engineer must be on call in case an emergency were to occur at any time of day, both at sea and port. The second engineer reports directly to the chief engineer daily and assists with paperwork and administrative duties as needed. This includes safety checks and duties that the chief may not have time to accomplish. == Licensing  United States === In order to sail as a first assistant engineer on a US ship, an engineer is required to have a non-expired license given by the US Coast Guard. To be qualified to hold a national First Assistant Engineer license for unlimited tonnage vessels, one must have over one year of experience as a second assistant engineer, one year experience as a chief aboard a limited tonnage vessel. To qualify for a second assistant engineer one must have at least year experience as a third assistant engineer. Obtaining a third assistant engineer’s licence can be achieved in many ways. The two most common ways being to have graduated from a certified maritime academy or accumulating experience by working as lower member of the engine department, often referred to as \\"hawsepipping\\" or \\"climbing the hawsepipe\\".  Certified Institution  By attending a certified maritime institution, such as the US Merchant Marine Academy or one of six maritime academies (Maine, Massachusetts, New York, Great Lakes, Texas, and California) students attend special classes designed to teach the skills necessary to become a third mate or engineer. By attending any of these academies students gain \\"sea time\\" by attending specific classes which is equivalent to time that an apprentice would be aboard a ship doing work and learning similar skills. While attending any one of these certified institutions, engineering students meet requirements for STCW standards and are streamlined through the process of becoming an officer over the course of four years. In their final year students are tested by the US Coast Guard on various ship systems, such as gas turbines or diesel propulsion for engineers or navigation and signals for mates. After passing all the exams and graduating, engineering students can choose to become third assistant engineers.  Apprenticeship  A sample of a credential given by the US Coast Guard to all officers, containing what vessels they are certified to work aboard One can also can begin the process by working as a lower member of the engine department, such as a wiper, for a minimum of three years; afterwards, with at least six months as a motorman, electrician, or machinist. After extra required training courses and evaluations by the ship’s captain one can begin the exams for a third assistant engineer license. The third method to achieve a license is an approved apprenticeship through an approved Coast Guard program, such as through a union such as the Marine Engineers Beneficial Association, or MEBA. Typically they take two years. Employers will often offer incentives to employees who wish to obtain their license, such as financial assistance or offering classes required to qualify for the exams. This method, as well as an apprenticeship is what is referred to as \\"hawsepipping\\". == Uniform == Uniforms are still worn aboard many ships, or aboard vessels typically contain and interact with passengers; yet are dependent on company standards or regulations. Often when reporting to a vessel the oncoming officer will report to the captain, or officer in charge of the vessel, in dress uniform. In the United States the uniform is in conjunction with Merchant Marine or Merchant Navy standards, depending on company policy. The Merchant Marine uniform distinguishes the First Engineer and the Chief Mate by a propeller on their shoulder boards, or epaulets. It is worn with the propeller closer to the neck and the stripes facing away from the neck, over the shoulders. During day to day ship operations inside the engine room, engineers will usually wear a work uniform, such as a boiler suit. Often these are thick cotton or denim clothes that are worn instead of normal uniform, such as khaki, but are often subject to company policy. Typically engineers change out of their work clothes in the mess hall to prevent getting oil or dirt from the engine room into the mess hall or galley. == Employment  United States === As of May 2014, engineers aboard US flagged deep sea sailing vessels earned a mean salary of $47.67 an hour, or roughly $97,720. In 2014 marine engineers based in California had a mean wage of $111,080 per year. Approximately 8,300 marine engineering jobs are available in the United States with only the top 40 percent, mainly officers, making over $100,000 annually. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics anticipates a nine percent increase in jobs by 2024, translating to roughly 700 jobs. As of 2014 over 29% of marine engineers were over the age of 55, the highest percentage of any engineering occupation in the country over 55. ==See also== *Seafarer's professions and ranks ==External links== * * Category:Nautical terminology Category:Marine occupations Category:Transport occupations ","title":"Second engineer"},{"id":"6206800","text":"Tasmena, a left tributary of Neperus/Borystenes (1554) by Sebastian Munster The Tiasmyn () is a right tributary of the Dnieper River in Ukraine.

It adjoins Arlington County's government center (including the courthouse and police/jail complex), and is approximately one mile west of Rosslyn and less than a mile north of Clarendon, of which it is sometimes considered a sub-neighborhood, as is Cherrydale, the mostly residential district immediately west of Lyon Village. ==Modern geography== The Lyon Village Historic District encompasses 1,073 contributing buildings and 1 contributing structure. The District as a \\"cohesive residential neighborhood in northern Arlington County, Virginia, located immediately north of the Clarendon Commercial District and roughly nestled between Wilson Boulevard to the south and Lee Highway to the north.\\" Major thoroughfares provide access to commercial and employment centers in the surrounding county and nearby Washington, D.C. The 191 acre historic neighborhood extends east to North Veitch Street and westward to North Kirkwood Road, including forty-three acres more than the original 148 acres platted by Frank Lyon in 1923. The neighborhood's commercial center presently includes a shopping center, with a Starbucks, Giant supermarket, CVS, and other stores, located at the confluence of Lee Highway, Spout Run Parkway and Interstate 66 (I-66). The area also includes a community house; a Veterans of Foreign Wars hall named for the developer's son, John Lyon, who died in World War I lies immediately east of the neighborhood. Parts of the neighborhood are near the Clarendon and Court House stations of Metrorail's Orange Line. ==History== According to the Arlington County Library, Robert Cruit, an immigrant from Devonshire, England, purchased land in the Clarendon area in 1825 for a farm. In 1923, his heirs sold the land to developer Frank Lyon, who subdivided it into tracts for residential development, including the eponymous Lyon Village. Most of the single-family homes in the neighborhood were constructed in the 1920s and 1930s. The Civil War Fort Strong which once protected Washington DC is now long gone, replaced by multi-story apartment buildings overlooking Interstate 66. There have been a growing number of teardowns (as of 2016). The first portion of the neighborhood to be platted as Lyon Village (by Frank Lyon in 1923) was landscaped with tree-lined streets, traffic circles, and an intricate system of curvilinear roads that complemented the less-than-one-acre housing lots. Aurora Heights and portions of Clarendon now fall within the current boundaries of Lyon Village and contain residential buildings constructed prior to Lyon's purchase of the Cruit property. Lyon Village was further enlarged by the platting of adjacent blocks with a more grid-like street pattern from the 1930s to the 1950s. Lyon Village is defined by a variety of 20th-century architectural styles and building types ranging from early-20th-century high style to vernacular interpretations of the elaborate styles traditionally erected decades earlier. Primarily, the domestic buildings in Lyon Village range from the 1880s to infill housing of the late 1990s. Building forms and styles extend from the imposing brick Colonial Revival-style dwelling to the smaller bungalow. Architectural styles presented in Lyon Village were often diluted, illustrating modest examples of Queen Anne, Colonial Revival, Craftsman, Tudor Revival, Classical Revival and Spanish Mission Revival styles. The community is primarily made up of single-family dwellings, supported along the borders by multiple-family apartment buildings, a landscaped park and community building, churches, and commercial buildings (which are not included in the historic district). Many of the properties include freestanding or attached garages and sheds. The buildings, particularly the single-family dwellings, are buffered from the public streets by sidewalks and grassy medians. ==References * Map showing boundaries of Lyon Village neighborhood. *Lyon Village apartments, local apartment buildings built by Frank Lyon *Lyon Village Citizens Association, a voluntary neighborhood organization * *Urban Villages: Lyon Village - By the ART Commuter Page Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Virginia Category:Historic districts in Arlington County, Virginia Category:National Register of Historic Places in Arlington County, Virginia Category:Neighborhoods in Arlington County, Virginia Category:Houses in Arlington County, Virginia ","title":"Lyon Village, Arlington, Virginia"},{"id":"6206855","text":"Patrick Parfrey, OC (born 1950) is a Canadian physician, specialized as nephrologist and epidemiologist.

The EMC believes in salvation through faith by grace. A further doctrine, \\"prevenient grace,\\" holds that God allows every person to make a choice in response to the Gospel, and apart from that grace man cannot freely choose to follow Christ and be saved from God's future judgment. According to their teachings, the saved Christian will grow in Christ-likeness throughout life via progressive sanctification, but there is also the experience of entire sanctification—a \\"second, crisis experience\\" in which a believer's heart is cleansed of self-centered ambition and replaced by a perfect love for God and other people. A fully sanctified Christian is expected by the EMC to live a holy lifestyle that reflects the character of Christ to the world (which they emphasize is neither \\"sinless perfection\\" nor legalism). ==History== The Evangelical Methodist Church was established on May 9, 1946, as the result of a prayer meeting where Methodist clergy and laity gathered in Memphis, Tennessee. Dr. J. H. Hamblen was elected chairman of the meeting and became the first General Superintendent of the new denomination.https://books.google.com/books?id=lk8_ARNz- dYC&lpg;=PA317&ots;=008aYDUhMT&dq;=%22Evangelical%20Methodist%20Church%22%20history%20%22J.H.%20Hamblen%22&pg;=PA317#v=onepage&q;=%22Evangelical%20Methodist%20Church%22%20history%20%22J.H.%20Hamblen%22&f;=false Evangelical Methodist Church\\".

They also trace their lineage to the missions of Francis Asbury, Thomas Coke, and other, tireless circuit riders of the 19th century. The \\"old fashioned\\" Methodism that they preached grew rapidly as they enthusiastically preached a Bible-based message with an emphasis on free will through the act of prevenient grace and on individual personal responsibility before God. Through local congregations and missions, Methodism inspired an evangelistic push in North America among many denominations to share the Gospel of Jesus Christ with those they considered spiritually lost or \\"sin-sick.\\" However, some doctrinal differences began to emerge among Methodists in the late 1800s and early 1900s, particularly in the wake of disagreements concerning the teachings of the Holiness movement and the Fundamentalist–Modernist Controversy. The EMC Book of Discipline (based on the Methodist Church Book of Discipline) recalled: \\"With a firm conviction that the gulf that separates conservative and liberal thought in the church is an ever-widening chasm which can never be healed, the Evangelical Methodist Church came into being to preserve the distinctive Biblical doctrines of primitive Methodism, founded upon the inspiration and authenticity of the Bible and upon the Articles of Religion as set forth by John Wesley. [...] the only infallible proof of any genuine church of Christ is its ability to seek and save the lost, to disseminate the Christian spirit and life, to spread scriptural holiness as taught by the Lord Jesus Christ in the Word of God over all lands, and to transform all people through the Gospel of Christ.\\"\\"Discipline of the Evangelical Methodist Church: 1966–1970,\\" (1966) Driggers, Ronald D., editor; Evangelical Methodist Church International Headquarters, Wichita, Kansas. ===Mergers=== In its second decade, the EMC merged with two smaller denominations that shared its views on sanctification, grace, and evangelism. * On June 4, 1960, the Evangel Church, Inc., in session at its annual conference, voted to unite with the Evangelical Methodist Church and thus become a part of the California District. Formerly known as the Evangelistic Tabernacles and founded by Azusa Pacific College figureheads Dr. William Kirby and Dr. Cornelius P. Haggard, the denomination dates back to March 27, 1933. At the time of merger there were 8 churches and about 675 enrolled in Sunday school, with Rev. R. Lloyd Wilson serving as president of the organization. This merger was approved by the Western Annual Conference of the Evangelical Methodist Church on June 22, 1960. * On July 3, 1962, the General Conference of the Evangelical Methodist Church voted to merge with the People's Methodist Church, formerly known as the People's Christian Movement, which came into being on January 1, 1938, with Rev. Jim H. Green of John Wesley College as the first General Superintendent.https://books.google.com/books?id=HGoD6HlU1iIC&lpg;=PA136 \\"Green, Jim.H\\" Historical Dictionary of the Holiness Movement. Edited by William Kostlevy The merger was finalized by vote of the People's Methodist Church at a subsequent conference in the summer of 1962. Rev. J. Neal Anderson, General Superintendent at the time of the merger, was elected Superintendent of the Virginia-North Carolina District. Dr. J.H. Hamblen (left), founder of the EMC, converses with Ezekiel Vargas (right) of Mexico in this undated photo. At the first EMC conference in 1948, delegates wholeheartedly approved a plan presented by circuit-riding preacher Dr. Ezequiel B. Vargas, superintendent of the Mexican Evangelistic Mission (MEM), that his missions group become a part of the Evangelical Methodist Church. Dr. Vargas and Dr. Hamblen maintained a strong friendship and working relationship.

M. D. Opara, of Nigeria, was received into the General Conference along with about 10,000 members.http://www.cap- press.com/pdf/2096.pdf Ekechi, Felix K., \\"Pioneer, Patriot, and Nigerian Nationalist : a Biography of the Reverend M.D. Opara, 1915–1965,\\" Carolina Academic Press, 2010. This body later aligned with W.W. Breckbill's Evangelical (Independent) Methodist Conference which established its own organizational identity after 1952. Another Nigerian body, the Bible Methodist Church in Nigeria, consisting of around 20 congregations and a school, joined the EMC in 1974 as the Nigerian Annual Conference. This brief relationship was terminated in 1976 when missionaries determined the group had support from many denominations and groups offering financial assistance.http://www.emchurch.org/downloads/General/History%20by%20Dr.%20Wease.pdf A mention was made at the 2006 General Conference of talks with the Evangelical Church regarding a possible merger. The denominations share a common ministry training school. The Churches of Christ in Christian Union (CCCU) is referred to as a \\"sister denomination\\" to the EMC and sends an observer to its general conferences. That denomination is itself a Wesleyan protest (having left the Restorationist Christian Union) and has merged with several smaller denominations including the Holiness Churches of Christ, the Reformed Methodist Church's Northeast District, and at times strongly considered union with the EMC. The CCCU renamed its youth ministry \\"Evangelical Christian Youth\\" in expectation of a merger.http://emchurch.org/pdf/Merger%20Talks%20Warren%20Banks.pdf ===Divisions=== In 1953, a schism occurred between the larger Evangelical Methodist Church and one of its clergymen, W.W. Breckbell, who organized the Evangelical Methodist Church of America, which is theologically fundamental Methodist. The Bethel Methodist Church, sprung from a theological disagreement within the EMC Mid-States District. A trial was conducted on March 24, 1989, and the Mid-States district superintendent was defrocked. Three churches left the EMC with him. The group claims four congregations, all in Texas. Another offshoot, the National Association of Wesleyan Evangelicals, is composed of five former Southern District EMC churches. It was formed in the wake of the consolidation of EMC districts in 2010 and legally binding arbitration regarding their desire to leave the denomination. These churches were disaffiliated by the General Council following the settlement of the local churches' remaining obligations to the conference. ==Structure== The EMC is headquartered in the Hamblen-Bruner Headquarters Building in Indianapolis. It maintains a congregational-connectional form of church polity, which has been significantly amended in recent years to reflect greater connectionalism. The Evangelical Methodist Youth logo (2008). Local churches in the U.S. are gathered into regions within the North America Conference. Districts include the U.S., Canada, and the Mexican Evangelistic Mission. (This \\"one conference model\\" replaced the longstanding practice of several, self-governing district conferences within the U.S. and separate missions conferences abroad.) Conference-licensed orders of ministry include: Local Preachers, Elders, Deacons and Deaconesses. Historically, the EMC has recognized Song Evangelists and Lay Exhorters as orders appointed by the local church. Departments include: Prayer, Stewardship, Pensions, Publications and Multicultural Ministries. Auxiliaries of the denomination include Men, Women and Youth organizations. Local church administrative structures vary, but the Book of Discipline calls for a board of Stewards and a board of Trustees to work in conjunction with the senior pastor. The senior pastor is responsible for oversight of the local church's ministries and other ministers. ===General Superintendents=== {  style=\\"float:right\\" - ! Elected !! MEM Gen.

Superintendent -  2010  Edward Williamson -  2018  Max Edwards } General Superintendents are elected by a quadrennial international general conference. The terms General Superintendent and Bishop are considered synonymous—multicultural churches and mission conferences are advised to use either title that aligns with their traditions. There are superintendents for each of the missions conferences and world areas, as well as an international general superintendent. \\"EMC Discipline 2014\\" At the 2010 General Conference, the title of U.S. General Superintendent was changed to International General Superintendent. ===Membership=== Worshipers in local churches may become members via the usual Methodist manner: by consulting with the local pastor, making a profession of faith, and taking a vow of membership. Candidates must have been previously baptized with water. Congregations are located in 25 U.S. states, and they have a presence in 20 other countries (including Myanmar, Canada, Mexico, and others) through various missions organizations (with strong ties to World Gospel Mission and One Mission Society). The EMC claimed 399 total churches worldwide and approximately 34,656 members in 2018. North American Conferences (Canada, Mexico and the United States) have the largest amount of local churches with 149 congregations—80 of those are in the United States. As of 2018, United States membership is approximately 7,316 people. In 2005, there were 108 churches and 7,348 members in the United States. ==Restructuring== In March 2010 the 30th General Conference adopted a two-district conference model, called the North America Conference, which included USA, Mexico and Canada. The model called for two districts, USA and Canada. The USA district was allotted four Conference Superintendents and Canada one Conference Superintendent. The new conference structure reduced the number of boards with similar functions from 27 to 7. There were no changes made in local church structure, or powers and descriptions of the superintendents. Opponents to the plan were concerned that regional representation would be lost and that too much authority was being given to international headquarters. Supporters said the reforms were necessary for greater organizational heath and local church growth. These reforms came as a result of decades of discussion over whether the \\"congregational-connectional\\" EMC was to be more congregational or more connectional in its polity. ===Efforts toward greater congregationalism=== Then-General Superintendent Rev. Lloyd H. Garrett's report to a 1976 special session of the General Conference in Wichita, Kansas highlighted a strong congregational tradition within the EMC, though his suggested reforms (including the elimination of his own office) fell short: Garrett referenced a recent strengthening and giving of full-time status to the office of the District Superintendents. Garrett proposed in this speech merging the Annual and District Conferences to reduce overhead (which was successful) and eliminating the office of General Superintendent in favor of a cabinet of District Superintendents (which failed). Garrett announced he would resign his position regardless of the outcome.Garrett, Lloyd H., Report of the General Superintendent to the General Council and the Special Session of the General Conference of the Evangelical Methodist Church - 1976 (paper copy) A task force on restructuring given at the same convention by Rev. Gordon W. Johnson reinforced the importance of a General Superintendent office while addressing fears that the connectional element of the EMC was being forgotten. ===A move toward stronger connectionalism=== During a \\"Forum on the Future\\" held on September 11–14, 1984, in Duncanville, Texas, then-General Superintendent Rev. John Kunkle defended the more connectional tradition within the EMC: Reorganization discussions continued as exemplified in the annual reports of General Superintendent Clyde Zehr and Atlantic District Superintendent Dr. Charles Church. During this time the number of districts were reduced from nine to seven. General Superintendent Edward Williamson in 2000 began a 10-year study and analysis of the structure and discussed possibilities yearly at the annual district conferences in his reports. Former General Superintendent Lucian Smith, one the EMC's founders, stated that the EMC took the Methodist Episcopal \\"Book of Discipline\\" and adapted it for the EMC at two points—property ownership by the local congregation and the call of the pastor. All of the historic Methodist connectional aspects remained, according to Smith. In September 2007, the General Council (superintendents and other officials) unanimously proposed that the U.S. districts be changed into regions and merged into a single conference. This plan, called the \\"One Conference Model\\" and part of the CSP (Comprehensive Strategic Plan), was proposed to delegates at the Special General Conference in July 2008. According to this earlier plan, The General Conference would be held every three or four years and in-between General Conference years, two annual convocations would be held on the east and west coasts. The General Council pointed to the current level of independence of the various districts and deviation from the denomination's \\"Methodist moorings\\" of connectionalism. The motion to adopt the reorganization plan was approved but would have failed to gain the three-quarters support necessary for a revision in the Constitution, with 157-100 delegate votes (61.1 to 39.9%).http://emchurch.org/downloads/Special%20Called%20General%20Conference/MINUTES%20General%20Conf%202008.pdf In Spring 2008, five of the six District Conferences supported the presentation of the one-conference model to the 2010 General Conference. The five churches which now comprise the congregational National Association of Wesleyan Evangelicals were originally part of the Southern District Conference -- the one district which did not approve of the changes. Upon approval of the two-conference model in 2010 the office of General Superintendent was made synonymous with the title of Bishop. ==Other EMCs== In addition to many freestanding local churches in the U.S. that go by the name \\"Evangelical Methodist,\\" there are multiple associations that use the name, and one which shares a common heritage with the larger body. ===Evangelical Methodist Church Conference=== The Evangelical Methodist Church Conference (EMCC) is a Methodist denomination within the conservative holiness movement that was organized in 1927 in central Pennsylvania by Pilgrim Holiness Church evangelists William Straub and Daniel Dubendorf. This group of seven congregations is an antecedent of the God's Missionary Church denomination. As of 2019 its General Superintendent was the Rev. Brent Lenhart. ===Evangelical (Independent) Methodist Churches of America=== Though the Evangelical Methodist Church contained Holiness and non-Holiness Fundamentalists in its beginning, it experienced a schism early in its history in regard to the Wesleyan doctrine of sanctification and the security of the believer. A faction led by W.W. Breckbill (a founder from the earliest days of the EMC ) became known as either the Evangelical (Independent) Methodist Churches, the Fellowship of Evangelical Methodist Churches, the Evangelical Methodist Conference, or simply the Evangelical Methodist Church . The connection was established in 1953 by dissenting members of the EMC. They operate Breckbill Bible College in Max Meadows, Virginia, named for its preferred founder. This smaller EMC group is more into cultural separatism than the original denomination and does not teach the doctrine of Entire Sanctification as a crisis experience. They are strictly congregationalist in polity. They have more things in common with the distinctly Fundamentalist Conservative Holiness Movement than does the larger EMC body. Dr. James B. Fields is the general superintendent of this group, which claims churches in Suriname, Jamaica, Chile, Nigeria, France, Kenya and Malawi in addition to 16 congregations in the United States. It is headquartered in Kingsport, Tennessee. According to an observer, this schism mirrors a trend among many Protestant denominations: > The history of the Evangelical Methodist Church illustrates the tensions > inherent in a Fundamentalist-Holiness relationship. Founded in 1946 as a > protest against growing liberalism in the Methodist Episcopal Church, the > Evangelical Methodist Church contained both Holiness and non-Holiness > factions. Eventually, the tension grew too great, and in 1952 the > denomination split over the issue of entire sanctification. The non-Holiness > segment, led by W. W. (William Wallace) Breckbill, took the more ardently > Fundamentalist position, aligning itself with the American Council of > Christian Churches, a Fundamentalist alliance. In this case, mutual > opposition to liberalism was not sufficient to make up for deep differences > over the doctrine of sanctification. Once the split took place, those > opposed to entire sanctification found themselves more comfortable in the > Fundamentalist camp. This story reproduces in miniature the general outline > of Fundamentalist-Holiness interaction. Internationally, there are many denominations unrelated to the U.S. EMCs which share the name, including Evangelical Methodist Church in Bolivia, Evangelical Methodist Church in the Philippine Islands, and others. ==References *Evangelical Methodist Church International Web site *Profile of the Evangelical Methodist Church on the Association of Religion Data Archives website *Breckbill Bible College Category:Christian organizations established in 1946 Category:Methodist denominations in North America Category:Methodist denominations established in the 20th century Category:Fundamentalist denominations Category:Holiness denominations Category:1946 establishments in Tennessee ","title":"Evangelical Methodist Church"},{"id":"6206866","text":"Marine Fighter Attack Squadron 321 (VMFA-321) was a United States Marine Corps fighter squadron consisting of F/A-18 Hornets . Known as \\"Hell’s Angels\\", the squadron participated in action during World War II and was then transferred to the Marine Forces Reserve. The squadron was decommissioned on 11 September 2004. ==HistoryWorld War II=== VMF-321 was established 1 February 1943 at Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point, North Carolina, as a unit of Marine Aircraft Group 31, 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing. After a crash course in tactics and maneuvers, the squadron was off to the war in the South Pacific. They were initially stationed at Barakoma Airfield on Vella Lavella, a recently captured island base in the Solomon Islands. VMF-321 CO and ace Major Overend in 1945. First Lieutenant Robert B. See made the squadron's first kill four days after arriving on the island. While in the Solomon's, the \\"Hell's Angels\\" amassed a record of 39 kills of Japanese aircraft and an additional 11 probables, with only eight aircraft lost. At one time the squadron was scoring at least one kill and/or one probable a day with its F4U Corsair aircraft. Captain J. R. Norman, assisted by wingman Lieutenant Philip B. Talbott, once downed four planes in a single day.http://www.koreanwar2.org/kwp2/usmckorea/reference/vmf321.pdf Major Edmund F. Overend, the squadron's Commanding Officer, who had come to the squadron with 5.83 credited kills from his services with the American Volunteer Group in China,AVG Victory Credits accounted for three more confirmed kills. The squadron transferred north to the area around Guam, where pilots took over \\"milk run\\" bombings of neighboring islands and played a major role in knocking out Japanese bases from which attacks against American bomber bases were being launched. ===The Cold War=== After the war, the squadron returned home and was deactivated on 28 January 1946. Early in 1946 a group of Marine aviators in the Washington, D.C. area began organizing a reserve fighting squadron from the ranks of pilots, officers, and enlisted members who had served together in the war as VMF-321. This new VMF-321 became an organized Marine Corps Reserve fighting squadron in July 1946 at Naval Air Station Anacostia, Maryland, and was assigned 14 Corsair aircraft similar to the ones flown by the squadron during the war. On April 1, 1949, Marine Fighting Squadron 321 was redesignated Marine Fighter Squadron 321. The squadron was placed on alert January 13, 1951 and was activated on March 1, 1951 flying the F8F Bearcat during the Korean War. The 164-man unit began an intensive training program under the command of Major George Robertshaw, in preparation for deployment to the Far East. The squadron did not go to Korea as a unit. Instead it was declared an augmentation squadron and its members were assigned to regular Marine units to fill empty billets. Colourful Phantom tail markings. In the 1950s, the squadron flew the A-1 Skyraider and on 15 May 1958 they were redesignated Marine Attack Squadron 321 (VMA-321). In 1962, NAS Anacostia ceased fixed-wing flying operations and both it and adjacent Bolling AFB's runways closed due to airspace and traffic pattern conflicts with Washington National Airport. NAS Anacostia then became Naval Support Facility Anacostia with heliport operations only. At this point, all assigned USN and USMC flying units, to include VMA-321, relocated to nearby Andrews AFB, Maryland and the newly established Naval Air Facility Washington. On 1 July 1962, the squadron again became VMF-321 when it began flying the FJ-4B Fury. This was followed by a transition to the F-8 Crusader in January 1965. In October 1973. a new paint scheme, consisting of a black dorsal and vertical stabilizer prompted a temporary nickname changed to the \\"Black Barons\\". However, the squadron shortly returned to the \\"Hell's Angels\\" adding a pitchfork running through the \\" MG\\" on the vertical stabilizer. An F-4S of VMFA-321 at NAS Miramar in 1987. Marine Fighter Squadron 321 was redesignated Marine Fighter Attack Squadron VMFA-321 in December 1973, when it became the first Marine Air Reserve squadron to receive the F-4 Phantom II aircraft. The designation, which remains today, indicated the dual fighter/attack mission. Aircrew and maintenance personnel began preparing for the new aircraft long before its arrival, and on January 15, 1974, VMFA-321 made its first Phantom flight. Reservists from VMFA-321 appeared in a film produced for recruiting personnel into the Marine Corps Air Reserves. The film, which featured actor and former Marine Christopher George, was produced in the summer of 1976 at Andrews Air Force Base by J. Walter Thompson, which has held the Marine Corps recruiting account contract for decades. In 1985, VMFA-321 operated twelve F-4S Phantom aircraft and accumulated 12,344 mishap free hours. During the calendar year the squadron flew nearly 3,000 hours in support of a demanding aircrew training program. VMFA-321 was nominated for the Chief of Naval Operations Safety Award. ===1990–2004=== An F/A-18A of VMFA-321, 2004 In 1991, VMFA-321 stood down the Phantom and commenced transitioning to the F/A-18 Hornet. During 1996, they deployed to Norway and Scotland. 1998 found them back in Scotland. 1999 sent the Hells Angels to Egypt. 2000 was a third and final deployment to Scotland. 2001 saw the squadron report to NAF Washington on 12 September without prior notice. The squadron reported mission ready with 6 aircraft and pilots ready for CAP missions and actually launched sorties in support of what would become Operational Noble Eagle. The squadron was chosen for deactivation as part of the Department of the Navy’s Tactical Air Integration Plan. And after a final deployment to Karup, Denmark in June 2004, they officially stood down on 11 September 2004. Shortly after this the last CO of the squadron flew the last remaining plane belonging to the squadron to Quantico MCB where he crashed the plane on its final landing. The aircraft was repaired and it sits on display at TBS (The Basic School). ==See also== * United States Marine Corps Aviation * List of inactive United States Marine Corps aircraft squadrons ==ReferencesNotes=== : ===Bibliography=== * Crowder, Michael J.

It was the country home of investment financier and philanthropist Otto Hermann Kahn and his family. The name \\"Oheka\\" is an acronym using the first several letters of each part of its creator's name, Otto Hermann Kahn, which Kahn also used to name his yacht Oheka II and his ocean-front Villa Oheka in Palm Beach, Florida. The mansion was built by Kahn between 1914 and 1919, and is the second largest private home in the United States, comprising 127 rooms and over , as originally configured. Today, the castle is a historic hotel, with 32 guest rooms and suites, and is a popular wedding venue for socialites, celebrities, and dignitaries, as well as the backdrop to many photo shoots, television series and Hollywood films. The estate also offers a bar, restaurant, and mansion tours of the estate and gardens. In 2004, Oheka was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Oheka Castle is a member of Historic Hotels of America, the official program of the National Trust for Historic Preservation. ==HistoryEarly history=== In 1905, a previous country home of Kahn's, Cedar Court in Morristown, New Jersey, was virtually destroyed by fire. In constructing Oheka, Kahn determined to build a fireproof building, so he had his architects, Delano and Aldrich, design the building out of steel and concrete, making it one of the first totally fireproof residential buildings. In constructing the home, two years were spent building an artificial hill on which to place it, giving it views of Cold Spring Hills and Cold Spring Harbor. See also: Aerial view of the castle and its gardens (2009) Kahn commissioned the Olmsted Brothers to design the estate's grounds, centered on a formal axial sunken garden in the French manner, of clipped greens and gravel in parterres and water terraces, screened by high clipped hedging from the entrance drive that ran parallel to the main axis. Other features of the complex included an 18-hole golf course designed by golf architect Seth Raynor, one of the largest private greenhouse complexes in America, tennis courts, an indoor swimming pool, a landing strip, orchards, and stables. Several years after Kahn's death in 1934, the estate was sold. After the sale, it was used for several purposes, including as a retreat for New York City sanitation workers. In 1948, Eastern Military Academy purchased the castle and of its property, bulldozed the gardens and subdivided the rooms. The school occupied the house until it closed in 1979. For the next four years, the building remained empty, during which time over 100 documented arson attempts occurred, all of which the building survived, demonstrating Kahn's success in building a fireproof building. In 1946 the golf course and stables became part of the Cold Spring Country Club, and the greenhouse complex operated as Otto Keil Florist. Much of the remainder of the property was developed into single- family homes. Oheka Castle and gardens Oheka Castle courtyard view ===Restoration=== In 1984, Oheka was purchased by Gary Melius, a Long Island developer. Melius undertook the largest private residential renovation project in the United States to restore the house, which was in a state of almost total disrepair, and recreate the gardens from the original Olmsted plans. In 1988, unable to continue financing the massive project, Melius sold the property to Hideki Yokoi for $22.5 million.Pacelle, Mitchell. Empire: A Tale of Obsession, Betrayal, and the Battle for an American Icon 2002, , p.57. Ten years later, following a lawsuit, the building passed to one of Yokoi's daughters and her husband.Empire, p.269. They were unable to sustain the property themselves, so Melius reacquired it under a long-term lease and later re-purchased the estate, operating it as a weddings and events venue, luxury hotel and conference center. ===Later history=== Celebrities who have been married there include Curtis Martin, Kevin Jonas, Megyn Kelly, Joey Fatonehttp://celebritybrideguide.com/kelly-baldwin-and-joey-fatone-wedding Brian McKnight, former U.S. Congressman Anthony Weiner. and Comedian Yannis Pappas.

Remains of the genus are known from the Permian of the South African Karoo Basin's Tapinocephalus and Cistecephalus assemblage zones, both belonging to the Beaufort Group. The skull of Rhinesuchus had a flat triangular shape with blunt snout similar to some of the other large amphibians, and had a palate filled with small sharp teeth, suggesting that it hunted fish. Also, the small eyes were on top of the head suggesting that it approached its prey from below. It is a popular misconception that Rhinesuchus is named after the Rhine River in Europe; Rhinesuchus actually gets its name from the Greek word for nose. The type species is Rhinesuchus whaitsi. Two more species, R. africanus and R. wadiai, are considered to be nomen dubium. R. broomianus and R. beaufortensis have been synonymized with R. whaitsi, while R. capensis has been moved out of the genus into Rhinesuchoides. Muchocephalus has also been synonymized with R. whaitsi. The first rhinesuchid from outside southern Africa was described as Rhinesuchus wolgodvinensis (Yacovlev, 1916). The specimen, collected from Early Triassic beds from Russia, was considered the first Rhinesuchus from the Triassic, although currently it is considered, instead, a wetlugasaurid.

The show was a raunchy comedy that focused on the hard-luck life of a beauty school dropout who must work for the wealthy, spoiled Ridgeway family. The rest of the hired help are also quirky. The WB only aired seven episodes, the show ending on April 16, 2004, and canceled it in May 2004. == Summary == Maria is studying to be a beautician when she has to come home to nurse her sick mother. After her mother's death, Maria is forced to take her place as the wealthy Ridgeway family's maid. She soon discovers not only a class struggle between the Ridgeways and the help, but also an all-out war among the servants. == Cast  Main === * Camille Guaty as Maria, the maid * Al Santos as Ollie, the chauffeur * Brenda Strong as Arlene Ridgeway, the rich lady * Keri Lynn Pratt as Veronica Ridgeway, the pop-star daughter * Megan Fox as Cassandra Ridgeway, the spoiled daughter * Mindy Cohn as Maggie, the cook * Marika Dominczyk as Anna, the nanny * Graham Murdoch as Douglas Ridgeway, the \\"baby\\" * Antonio Sabato Jr. as Dwayne, the trainer === Recurring === * Tori Spelling as Molly, the dog walker * Esther Scott as Doris, the older nanny * Jack Axelrod as Grandpa Eddie * David Faustino as Adam Ridgeway, the oldest son ==EpisodesReception== The premiere of The Help was the most watched program in the Friday 9:30–10:00 time slot on The WB in the 2003–04 season. The premiere was more popular among women than men aged 12–34 (2.0/8 versus 1.3/5). Despite the premiere being the best performance in the time slot of the season on The WB the critics have nothing positive to say. Virginia Heffernan of The New York Times said the show \\"comes off like a school play, clumsily blocked, loudly acted and nearly shouted down by obligatory laughter and applause\\". Robert Bianco of USA Today pointed out that \\"this is the kind of show that opens with a doggie-doo joke and still finds a way to go downhill\\". Perhaps the harshest was Matthew Gilbert of The Boston Globe: \\"The WB's claim that 'The Help' is a 'biting satire' is only half true. No, it's not a satire, but yes, it does indeed bite. And it will be biting the dust before long, unless it can find a new cast, new writers, new producers, a new set, and an entirely new premise.\\" In her review of the 2003–04 season Kay McFadden, television critic for The Seattle Times, classified The Help as \\"Never should have aired\\". == References  External links == * Category:2000s American sitcoms Category:2004 American television series debuts Category:2004 American television series endings Category:Television series by Warner Bros.

The western terminus of the route was at an intersection with County Route 11 (CR 11) and CR 24 in Risingville, a hamlet within the town of Thurston. Its eastern terminus was at a junction with NY 415 in the town of Campbell. In between, NY 333 passed through the hamlet of Thurston. The route was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York and remained unchanged until April 1, 1997, when ownership and maintenance of the route was transferred from the state of New York to Steuben County as part of a highway maintenance swap between the two levels of government.

It headed eastward, following Michigan Creek along the base of a valley surrounding the waterway. Due to the terrain of the area, NY 333 intersected only a handful of roads, one of which was Cranberry Lake Road (CR 2), a north–south highway that met NY 333 midway between the hamlets of Risingville and Thurston. The route continued onward, turning northeastward toward Thurston Pond and the small hamlet of Thurston at the eastern edge of the small lake. Here, NY 333 curved back to the east as it met Savona–Thurston Road (CR 12) in the western half of the community. East of Thurston hamlet, NY 333 continued to run along the base of the Michigan Creek valley into the town of Campbell, where the valley met a larger valley surrounding the Cohocton River. The route proceeded eastward across the width of the latter valley, crossing over the river on its way into the riverside hamlet of Campbell, the largest community along NY 333\\\\. It proceeded eastward through the hamlet along Main Street to an interchange with the Southern Tier Expressway (then-NY 15 and NY 17) just east of the community. NY 333 ended just east of the Southern Tier at a junction with NY 415\\\\. The right-of-way also terminated at the junction. ==History== USGS topographic map of the Thuston area with NY 333 at center NY 333 was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York as a spur connecting U.S. Route 15 (US 15, now NY 415) in Campbell to the hamlet of Risingville in the town of Thurston. It remained unchanged until April 1, 1997, when ownership and maintenance of the route was transferred from the state of New York to Steuben County as part of a highway maintenance swap between the two levels of government.

It was built between 1926 and 1929 by the heiress to the Dodge automaker fortune, Matilda Dodge Wilson and her second husband, lumber baron, Alfred Wilson. Covering with 110 rooms,the structure is the fourth largest historic mansion museum in the United States, and is classified as one of America's Castles. In 1957, the mansion and the surrounding property and buildings were donated to the state of Michigan in order to fund Michigan State University–Oakland, now known as Oakland University. The structure was named a National Historic Landmark in 2012. ==History== Meadow Brook Farms originally belonged to Matilda's first husband, automotive tycoon John F. Dodge. He purchased the property along with the large white farmhouse off Adams Road as a holiday retreat for his family. The mansion is located on a estate off South Adams Road; Dodge added a nine-hole golf course, some of the holes of which still follow the current Katke-Cousins 18-hole course on the property. Meadow Brook Hall was constructed between 1926 and 1929 by Matilda Dodge Wilson and her second husband, Alfred Wilson at a cost of $4 million. Throughout her lifetime, Matilda resided in the hall for nearly forty years. Some of the family's time was spent vacationing at their summer home in Bar Harbor, Maine and winter home in Scottsdale, Arizona. The hall was also partially closed for a brief time during the depth of the Depression. Covering and with 110 rooms, the mansion is the fourth largest historic house museum in the United States. It was designed by William Kapp of the firm Smith, Hinchman & Grylls in a Tudor-revival style. The building features stonework and a plaster dining room ceiling created by Corrado Parducci. Much of the original artwork collected by the Wilsons is still found at Meadow Brook including paintings by Anthony van Dyck, Rosa Bonheur, Joshua Reynolds, John Constable and Thomas Gainsborough, as well as Tiffany glass, Stickley furniture, Meissen porcelain, and Rookwood pottery. The estate was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1979 and National Historic Landmark in 2012. The Living Room of Meadow Brook Hall In 1957, Alfred and Matilda Dodge Wilson donated the 1,500 acre estate to Michigan State University, along with $2 million to create a branch college campus, now known as Oakland University. The Wilsons lived in the on the property until Alfred's death in 1962. Mrs. Wilson lived in Meadow Brook Hall until her death in 1967. ==Concours d'Elegance== The Meadow Brook Concours d'Elegance was held annually during August on the grounds of Meadow Brook Hall from 1979 until 2010. This week-long event was one of the largest collector car shows in the world, and a social event in the tradition of the first Concours in 1920s Paris which was an exhibition of automotive design, craftsmanship, history and a tool for automobile manufacturers to market products. Over the years, the event also served as a fundraiser for the preservation of Meadow Brook Hall. On July 20, 2010, promoters announced that the Concours d'Elegance would leave Meadow Brook Hall after that year for the Inn at St. John's in Plymouth, Michigan. The event is now known at the Concours d'Elegance of America at St. John's. ==See also== * List of castles in the United States * List of largest houses in the United States * List of National Historic Landmarks in Michigan * National Register of Historic Places listings in Oakland County, Michigan ==References== ;Inline ;General *A&E; with Richard Guy Wilson, Ph.D.,(2000).

He was a son of Nathaniel Russell Sturgis (1779–1856) and, his wife, Susannah Thomsen (née Parkman) Sturgis. His younger brother was fellow merchant Henry Parkman Sturgis (father of author Maria Trinidad Howard Sturgis Middlemore), who served as United States Consul to the Philippines. His paternal grandparents were Russell Sturgis, a noted merchant, and his wife Elizabeth (née Perkins) Sturgis (a sister of merchant Thomas Handasyd Perkins), both of archetypical Boston Brahmin families. Through his grand-uncle Thomas Sturgis (the younger brother of his grandfather Russell), he was a second cousin of architect and art critic Russell Sturgis (who married Sarah Maria Barney, a daughter of Danford Newton Barney, a president of Wells Fargo & Company). Sturgis went to Harvard College, at the age of twelve, graduating with the class of 1823 where he was a member of the Phi Beta Kappa society. He studied law at Northampton, Massachusetts. ==Career== Russell and Sturgis's former office along the Pasig River in Manila, 1900. In 1828, after his second marriage, he made his first voyage abroad then practiced law in Boston for a time. He sailed for Canton in 1833 on behalf of opium trader John Perkins Cushing, settling for some time in Macau where Lady Elizabeth Napier, wife of British emissary William John, 9th Lord Napier, found him \\"very intelligent\\". While he was there, his portrait and those of three of his four children by second wife were painted by the English portraitist George Chinnery. In Asia, he entered a succession of trading firms (Russell & Sturgis of Manila; Russell, Sturgis & Co. of Canton; Russell & Co.), and in 1842 he became a full partner. In 1844, Sturgis retired to Boston to rejoin his children who had been sent there to school after their mother's 1837 death in Manila. He married, for a third time and decided to return to China with his family in 1851. The steamer on which they crossed the Atlantic arrived too late to catch the onward ship from London. In their interval there, Sturgis was asked by the senior member of Barings Bank to become a partner. He accepted and ultimately became head of the firm, succeeding fellow American Joshua Bates (who married his father's cousin, Lucretia Sturgis). In England, he lived at 17 Carlton House Terrace in London (today home to the Federation of British Artists and the Mall Galleries), and Givons Grove in Leatherhead. Although he never renounced his U.S. citizenship, Sturgis did not return to the United States and died in England in 1887. ==Personal life== Sturgis married three times. He married his first wife, Lucy Lyman Paine (1805–1828), on April 3, 1828. Lucy was a daughter of Henry Paine and Olive (née Lyman) Paine. Her paternal grandfather was Robert Treat Paine, the lawyer and politician who was a signer of the Declaration of Independence and served as the Massachusetts' first Attorney General. Lucy died, aged 22, on August 20, 1828, just four months after their marriage. On September 28, 1829, Sturgis was married to his second wife, Mary Greene Hubbard (1806–1837), a daughter of John Hubbard and Jane (née Parkinson) Hubbard. Before her death in Manila on September 17, 1837, they were the parents of four children, the youngest of whom (a daughter named Mary) died in infancy: * Nathaniel Russell Sturgis (1831–1899), who married Susan Codman Welles (1832–1862), a daughter of Benjamin Welles.

Due to its progressive style, it is constantly evolving into many newly developing branches with new contemporary styles. Although Sikh architecture was initially developed within Sikhism its style has been used in many non-religious buildings due to its beauty. 300 years ago, Sikh architecture was distinguished for its many curves and straight lines; Shri Keshgarh Sahib and the Sri Harmandir Sahib (Golden Temple) are prime examples. Sikh Architecture is heavily influenced by Mughal and Rajput styles. The onion dome, frescoes, in-lay work, and multi-foil arches, are Mughal influences, more specially from Shah Jahan's period, whereas chattris, oriel windows, bracket supported eaves at the string-course, and ornamented friezes are derived from elements of Rajput architecture. Apart from religious buildings, Sikh architecture includes secular forts, bungas (residential places), palaces, and colleges. The religious structure is called gurdwara (a place where the Guru dwells). The word gurdwara is a compound of guru (guide or master) and dwara (gateway or seat). So, it has an architectural connotation. Sikh gurdwaras are generally commemorative buildings connected with the ten gurus in some way, or with places and events of historical significance. Some examples are Gurdwara Dera Sahib (halting place), in Batala in Gurdaspur district. It was erected in memory of the brief stay of Guru Nanak along with his companions on the occasion of his marriage. Gurdwara Shahid Ganj (Martyr's Memorial) in Muktsar in Faridkot district commemorates the cremation spot of Sikhs who were killed in a battle between Guru Gobind Singh and the Mughals in 1705. Gurdwara Shish Mahal (hall of mirrors) in Kiratpur in Ropar district was made where Guru Har Kisan was born. There are over 500 historical gurdwaras.

Dhirendra Brahmachari was also yoga mentor of Indira Gandhi – a former Prime Minister of India He ran Ashrams in Delhi, Jammu, Katra and Mantalai (Jammu and Kashmir) and wrote books on yoga. ==Biography== Inspired by reading the Bhagavad Gita, he left home at the age of thirteen and went to Varanasi. His guru was Maharshi Kartikeya whose ashram was at Gopal-Khera, about twelve miles from Lucknow. Dhirendra Brahmachari studied yoga and associated subjects there.http://www.worldyogadirectory.com/Yoga-Teachers/Swami-Dhirendra- Brahmachari-1227.html In the 1960s he was invited to travel to the U.S.S.R. as a hatha yoga expert to train Soviet cosmonauts. Jawaharlal Nehru later invited him to teach yoga to his daughter, Indira Gandhi, to improve her health. He became influential politically in 1975–77 when Mrs Gandhi dissolved Parliament, declared a state of emergency and suspended civil liberties. In the late 1970s, Dhirendra Brahmachari promoted the benefits of yoga in a weekly program called \\"Yogabhyaas\\" which was broadcast on Doordarshan, the state-owned television network. He introduced yoga as a subject of study in Delhi administered schools, a considerable innovation. He was the owner of Vishwayatan Yogashram in the centre of Delhi, now known as the Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga. He also owned campuses in Jammu, Katra and Mantalai, plots of land he had received through his Indira Gandhi clout.

His ashram at Mantalai is spread over 1008 kanals of land with private airstrips, hangar, a zoo and a seven storey building in gandhi nagar, Jammu. Nowadays there are three known successors of Dhirendra Brahmachari yoga tradition: Bal Mukund Singh from India, Reinhard Gammenthaler from Switzerland and Rainer Neyer from Austria. ==Criminal charges== Mr. Brahmachari was charged with buying an aircraft in the United States during the Emergency imposed by Mrs Gandhi and smuggling it into the country without paying customs duties, but he was never tried. Dozens of other criminal cases were filed against him and many dragged on till his death. In one case, he was accused of illegally importing gun parts from Spain for his factory, which had a licence to make guns only with local materials. ==Death== Dhirendra Brahmachari died in a plane crash, along with his pilot, when they hit a pine tree on June 10, 1994, while landing at his religious retreat and yoga school in Mantalai. ==References== http://www.eng.vedanta.ru/library/brodov/Vasily_Brodov_Russian_Philosopher_and_Yoga_Practitioner.php == External links == * Sukshma Vyayam (A better way to health), film by N.S.

Irene's interest in geology brought her attention to Frederick Chapman - who was a palaeontologist at the National Museum of Victoria. Irene became his assistant and later replaced his role as a palaeontologist in the Department of the Interior - receiving half his salary, equipment and office space because she was a woman. Crespin began her research by examining and locating fossils across Australia. == Early life == Geologist Irene Crespin was born in Australia in the town of Kew, Victoria. Crespin was born to Victorian parents, her father Godwin George Crespin an auctioneer and her mother was Eliza Jane. Originally, Crespin dreamed of becoming a musician, but after attending the Mansfield Agricultural High School she found her inspiration to become a geologist. She took her B.A. from the University of Melbourne in 1919, in which she studied to become a teacher. Here, she fell under the influence of Frederick Chapman, whose assistant she became in December 1927. From here she assisted Chapman in his study and search to discover oils and minerals in the area. == Career == On 1 January 1936 she succeeded Chapman as a palaeontologist in the Department of the Interior. It was a high honor to continue with Chapman's work, but unfortunately Crespin was severely underpaid: her salary was half that of Frederick Chapman, and had to continue on working with insufficient tools and lesser than desirable working environment. A driving desire to continue her geological studies resulted in Crespin moving to Canberra to be in contact with the Commonwealth's geological adviser Walter George Woolnough. During her career she published some ninety papers—including notable work on foraminifera—as sole author and more than twenty in collaboration with other scientists.Margaret E. Bartlett, Crespin, Irene (1896 - 1980), Australian Dictionary of Biography, Volume 13, MUP, 1993, pp 532–533. In 1939, Crespin traveled to Java and Sumatra, Indonesia, to discuss with micro- palaenontologists who were in government service and industry, regarding the problems that existed with Tertiary correlation in the Indo-Pacific region. Crespin was invited to visit the US in 1951 to address the American Association of Petroleum Geologists. A fire broke out in 1953 in the Canberra offices of the B.M.R resulting in many of Crespin's books and work being destroyed. In 1961, Crespin decided to retire at the age of 65. == Later life == Crespin died in Canberra, on January 2, 1980.

The breed originated in the Sindh province of Pakistan, they are widely kept for milk production across Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and other countries. It originated in Hyderabad (Pakistan) and Bikaner (India). They have been used for crossbreeding with temperate (European) origin dairy breeds in many countries to combine their tropical adaptations (heat tolerance, tick resistance, disease resistance, fertility at higher temperatures, etc.) with the higher milk production found in temperate regions. It has been crossed with Jerseys in many places, including India, the United States, Australia, Sri Lanka, etc. ==Description== The Red Sindhi range in color from a deep reddish brown to a yellowish red, but most commonly a deep red. They are distinguished from the other dairy breed of Sindh, the Tharparkar or White Sindhi, both by color and form, the Red Sindhi is smaller, rounder, with a more typical dairy form, and with short, curved horns, while the Tharparkar are taller with a shape more typical of Zebu draft breeds, and with longer, lyre shaped horns. The bulls are usually of a darker color than the cows. ==Breeding== It has been crossed with include Holstein-Friesian, Brown Swiss and Danish Red. It has also been used to improve beef and dual purpose cattle in many tropical countries, as it is sufficiently meaty to produce good beef calves in such crosses and the high milk production helps give a fast-growing calf which is ready for market at one year. It is somewhat smaller than the very similar Sahiwal and produces a little less milk per animal as a result. This has caused it to lose favor with some commercial dairies in India and Pakistan, which have been phasing out their Red Sindhi herds by breeding to Sahiwal bulls for a few generations. The resulting cows, which are three- quarters Sahiwal and one-quarter Red Sindhi, can not be distinguished from pure Sahiwal cattle. Red Sindhi cattle are also used for milk production in Brazil, but this race of zebu is not popular as others. ==Brazilian Red Sindhi Cattle== Some Red Sindhi cows were imported to the Brazil in the middle of 20th century.https://asas.org/docs/default-source/wcgalp- posters/436_paper_8601_manuscript_880_0.pdf?sfvrsn=2 ==See also== * White Sindhi cattle * Sahiwal cattle * Zebu == References  * STATUS, CHARACTERISTICS AND PERFORMANCE OF RED SINDHI CATTLE Category:Cattle breeds Category:Cattle breeds originating in Pakistan Category:Animal breeds originating in Sindh Category:Red cattle Category:Cattle breeds originating in India ","title":"Red Sindhi"},{"id":"6207032","text":"Jack Gallagher may refer to: * Jack Gallagher (comedian) (born 1953), American comedian, actor and writer * Jack Gallagher (composer) (born 1947), American composer and college professor * Jack Gallagher (oilman) (1916-1998), Canadian oil and gas executive * Jack Gallagher (wrestler) (born 1990), British professional wrestler * Jack Gallagher, character in And Millions Will Die * John Andrew Gallagher, also called Jack ==See also== *Jackie Gallagher (disambiguation) *John Gallagher (disambiguation) ","title":"Jack Gallagher"},{"id":"6207033","text":"The 2006–2008 Cuban transfer of presidential duties was the handover of the title of president and presidential duties from longtime Cuban leader Fidel Castro to his brother Raúl Castro, the next-in-line-of-succession person in Cuba, following Fidel's operation and recovery from an undisclosed digestive illness believed to be diverticulitis. Although Raúl Castro exercised the duties of president, Fidel Castro retained the title of President of Cuba, formally the President of the Council of State of Cuba, during this period. Fidel had been in power since 1959 and held the title of President of Cuba since 1976. At the time of his operation in July 2006, he was 79 years old and the last governing communist leader from the Cold War era. Fidel felt proud to have not only thwarted the Bay of Pigs Invasion, failed CIA attempts to kill him, and acts of Cuban exile violence, but also outlived the Cold War and the USSR, and using the power of persuasion to help the Cuban people brave the crippling effects of the US embargo against Cuba and the aftermath of the collapse of the Soviet Union. While the radical left (especially Hugo Chavez and Evo Morales) praised Castro as a tireless defender of the poor and oppressed in Latin America and Africa while standing up to US hegemony in the Americas, Fidel Castro's sworn enemies, namely the US and Cuban-Americans, saw him as a ruthless tyrant who broke his promise to restore democracy to Cuba by imposing a repressive communist government on the island that muzzled all opposition and wrecked the Cuban economy. On February 19, 2008 Fidel announced that he would not stand for re-election as President at the next meeting of the National Assembly of People's Power. Raúl was elected President by the National Assembly on February 24, 2008. ==July 2006 announcement== The transfer of duties was announced in a proclamation read on state television at 8:15 p.m. by Castro's secretary, Carlos Valenciaga. The proclamation appeared on the Granma website that night and was printed in Cuba's national newspaper Granma, the next day. In his statement of delegation, Castro stated: \\"the operation has obliged me to take several weeks of rest, at a remove from my responsibilities and duties\\". The proclamation transferred to his brother the functions as First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Cuban Communist Party, Comandante of the Armed Forces, President of the Council of State, and of the Government of the Republic of Cuba. It transferred other functions to José Ramón Balaguer Cabrera, José Ramón Machado Ventura, Esteban Lazo Hernández, and Carlos Lage Dávila. Castro also announced in his statement that he had spoken to the Guayasamín Foundation, whose responsibilities included organizing his oncoming 80th birthday celebrations on August 13, 2006. He requested that the group postpone the anniversary until December 2, 2006, the 50th anniversary of the Granma Landing. The letter ended with the Cuban leader's customary pronouncements: \\"Imperialism will never be able to crush Cuba. The Battle of Ideas will continue advancing. ¡Viva la Patria! ¡Viva la Revolución! ¡Viva el Socialismo! ¡Hasta la Victoria Siempre! (Long live the Motherland! Long live the revolution! Long live socialism! Ever onward to victory!)\\". The transfer of power was in line with Article 94 of the Cuban Constitution, which states: \\"In cases of the absence, illness or death of the president of the Council of State, the first vice president assumes the president's duties\\". ==Illness timeline2006=== July * July 26 – Fidel Castro was present at the 53rd anniversary celebrations of the assault on Moncada Barracks. Prior to that, Castro had just returned from a visit to a Mercosur summit in Córdoba, Argentina, which included a confrontation with a group of journalists over the issue of providing a visa for Cuban dissident Dr. Hilda Molina, as well as a visit to Che Guevara's childhood home. In his announcement printed in the Cuban media, Castro stated that the \\"days and nights of continuous work, almost without sleep took its toll on my health, put me under extreme stress and my health was affected\\".Ailing Castro cedes power to brother Kansas City.com * July 31 – a proclamation was made transferring control of the responsibilities and functions of the government to Castro's brother, Raúl.

August * August 7 – Cuban intellectual and government member, Roberto Fernández Retamar, further fueled speculation of Castro's ultimate demise by saying at a news conference, \\"They (U.S. Government) had not expected that a peaceful succession was possible.

He had not been seen in public since the announcement of the handover. Televised images taken during Chávez's visit showed Castro sitting up and speaking enthusiastically in further evidence that he is recovering. * September 5 – the Cuban government released a letter from Castro stating, \\"It can be affirmed that the most critical moment has been left behind.

Douglas was unwavering in his support, saying, \\"At this challenging time for the people of Cuba, we of Caricom want them to know that we wish for President Fidel Castro a successful recovery, and soon. He has proven to be a great friend of the Caribbean and of all poor and developing countries struggling for a better life for their peoples.\\" He also warned against trying to create instability during the transition, adding: \\"We in CARICOM sincerely hope that as President Castro...recovers, and acting President Raúl Castro takes on the very demanding responsibilities as Head of State, that there would be no adventurism on the part of any and from whatever quarter, to create problems for the Cuban people...\\"Jamaican Observer Thereafter Saint Lucia's Prime Minister Dr. Kenny Anthony also issued a series of well wishes for his Cuban counterpart. Dr. Anthony said he was just as surprised as the Cuban people and the rest of the world by the sudden news of President Castro's illness. But, he added, he was \\"also confident that he is receiving the best medical care in the world, because the quality of health care in Cuba is exceedingly good and I'm sure he is being given the very best medical care. In his press release the Saint Lucian Prime Minister also said, \\"The Cabinet of Ministers, and indeed the people of Saint Lucia, have much admiration for the Cuban President and his personal interest in making humanitarian and social assistance available to Saint Lucia and the rest of the Caribbean, especially in the fields of health and education.\\" ===United States=== On July 31, just hours prior to the announcement of Castro's condition, U.S. President George W. Bush told WAQI-AM, a Spanish-language radio station in Miami, \\"If Fidel Castro were to move on because of natural causes, we've got a plan in place to help the people of Cuba understand there's a better way than the system in which they've been living under. No one knows when Fidel Castro will move on. In my judgment, that's the work of the Almighty.\\" On August 2, Senator Robert Bennett (R-Utah) said President Bush told him the administration was surprised by the announcement of Castro's illness, \\"The president's comment was that everybody was caught by surprise, and we'll have to wait and see what U.S. action is necessary. I think all of us can say we had no idea this was coming.\\" Senators met in Washington, D.C. to discuss \\"A Democratic Cuba After Castro\\", as many senators argued that the United States should have a plan in case the United States would need to offer any help to Cuba during a transfer of duties. Cuban-American Senator Mel Martinez stated that he and many other Cuban-Americans regard Raúl Castro as a temporary figure and not someone capable of leading Cuba into the future. There were celebrations among the large Cuban-American population of Miami, Florida, Jersey City, New Jersey, and several other smaller Cuban communities in the US opposed to Castro's regime. On August 3, 2006, the White House released the following statement: ===Latin America=== President of Venezuela Hugo Chávez and President of Bolivia Evo Morales both made statements of support for Castro's recovery. Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, the Brazilian president and a long-time friend of Castro, said \\"Cubans alone should decide on a possible presidential successor. The succession process is a decision the Cuban people will have to take\\". Numerous Latin American publications, including Peru's La República, and Bolivia's La Razón, ran front-page articles about the event, featuring pictures of a frail-looking Castro, head in hand. Others, such as Mexico City's La Crónica de Hoy and El Sol de México, focused on the bond between Castro and his brother Raúl, the former showing a picture of the two walking together, the latter a picture of an elderly Fidel with arm held aloft by Raúl. A headline in Peru's La República declared Castro's cessation of duties to be \\"the end of an era\\", while Venezuela's El Universal said the event was \\"unprecedented in 47 years of power.\\" On August 5, 2006, the Brazilian newspaper Folha de S.Paulo reported that Cuban authorities had informed Brazilian president Lula da Silva that Castro's health was much worse than what the Cuban government had previously admitted in public, contending that he was suffering from intestinal cancer and will be unable to resume control of the Cuban state. The Brazilian government quickly denied that the report was accurate. Folhas editors responded to the government's denials by saying their sources were Castro's top aides. ==See also== * Politics of Cuba ==References== Category:Presidents of Cuba Category:Fidel Castro Transfer of presidential duties Transfer Transfer Transfer Category:Government of Cuba ","title":"2006–2008 Cuban transfer of presidential duties"},{"id":"6207035","text":"James P. Fitch (July 4, 1887 – January 5, 1964) was a Scouting notable in the early history of the Boy Scouts of America (B.S.A.). He was born at Montserrat, Missouri, and attended Missouri State Normal School (now University of Central Missouri) at Warrensburg. It was there that he met Dr. Elbert K. Fretwell of Teachers College, Columbia University, who was a summer instructor at Warrensburg, and an early leader in the B.S.A. They formed a strong friendship, and Fretwell recruited Fitch to work for the B.S.A. during its first decade. In 1912, Fitch, a school teacher by vocation, was hired by the B.S.A. to travel on the Redpath Chautauqua circuit. Based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, he spent 2 1/2 years traveling around the mid-west setting up Scout troops in the towns and cities he visited. In 1915, he was hired as Camp Master at Owasippe Scout Camp near Chicago where he was the founder of \\"The Tribe of Owasippe.\\" When he was not employed at the camp, he was District Scout Executive for the North Shore District in Chicago. In 1917, Fitch was hired as the Council Scout Executive at Columbus, Ohio, and served there through 1919.Huffman, Minor (1967), History of Region Nine, Boy Scouts of America, 1920-1967, p. 7–8 In the Fall of 1919, Fitch was appointed Region Scout Executive for Region Nine (Texas, Oklahoma and New Mexico), and he served in that capacity until 1945. During these years, Fitch actively recruited supporters for the Scouting program. In 1938, one of these supporters, Oklahoma oilman Waite Phillips, donated part of his huge Philmont Ranch near Cimarron, New Mexico. This became Philturn Rocky Mountain Scout Camp. Three years later, in December 1941, just days after the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor, Phillips donated the rest of his ranch to Region Nine. In 1945, when Fitch retired as Region Nine Scout Executive, Phillips insisted that Fitch be appointed the General Manager of Philmont Scout Ranch and Phillips Properties for the B.S.A. In the early 1930s, Fitch visited the newly dedicated Worth Ranch Scout camp in Palo Pinto County, Texas, and made a copy of \\"The Worth Ranch Grace,\\" a simple grace before meals used at the camp. This handwritten copy of The Worth Ranch Grace is in the possession of Pete Normand of College Station, Texas. Normand, a former member of the Worth Ranch camp staff, is the son-in-law of James P. Fitch's only son, William D. Fitch. During Fitch's twenty-five years as Region Nine Scout Executive, his office was in Dallas, Texas. During these years he was the chapter advisor for the Alpha Omicron chapter of Alpha Phi Omega at Southern Methodist University, a Greek Letter Scouting fraternity. ==References== Category:People associated with the Boy Scouts of America Category:Scouting pioneers Category:1887 births Category:1964 deaths ","title":"James P.

A matrimonial nullity trial, governed by canon law, is a judicial process whereby a canonical tribunal determines whether the marriage was void at its inception (ab initio). A \\"Declaration of Nullity\\" is not the dissolution of an existing marriage (as is a dispensation from a marriage ratum sed non consummatum and an \\"annulment\\" in civil law), but rather a determination that consent was never validly exchanged due to a failure to meet the requirements to enter validly into matrimony and thus a marriage never existed.\\"Press conference details marriage law reforms\\", Radio Vatican, accessed 11 October 2015. The Catholic Church teaches that, in a true marriage, one man and one woman become \\"one flesh\\" before the eyes of God. Various impediments can render a person unable to validly contract a marriage. Besides impediments, marriage consent can be rendered null due to invalidating factors such as simulation or deceit, or to psychological incapacity. In 2015, the process for declaring matrimonial nullity was amended by the matrimonial nullity trial reforms of Pope Francis, the broadest reforms to matrimonial nullity law in 300 years.Pope Francis announces biggest changes to annulment process in centuries, The Washington Post, accessed 8 September 2015 Prior to the reforms, a declaration of nullity could only be effective if it had been so declared by two tribunals at different levels of jurisdiction. If the lower courts (First and Second Instance) were not in agreement, the case went automatically to the Roman Rota for final decision one way or another. ==Reasons for nullity== Certain conditions are necessary for the marriage contract to be valid in canon law. Lack of any of these conditions makes a marriage invalid and constitutes legal grounds for a declaration of nullity. Accordingly, apart from the question of diriment impediments dealt with below, there is a fourfold classification of contractual defects: defect of form, defect of contract, defect of willingness, defect of capacity. For annulment, proof is required of the existence of one of these defects, since canon law presumes all marriages are valid until proven otherwise.Code of Canon Law, Canon 1060 . *Defect of form: If the marriage ceremony is invalid (e.g. two Catholic persons being married outside of the Catholic Church) *Defect of contract: If it was not a marriage that was contracted, such as if there was a defect of intent on either side. This can occur if either party lacked the intent to enter into a lifelong, exclusive union, open to reproduction. In the Church's understanding, the marriage contract can only be between a woman and a man. *Defect of will: Because of \\"mental incapacity, ignorance, error about the person, error about marriage, fraud, knowledge of nullity, simulation, conditioned consent, force or grave fear\\". *Defect of capacity: If either party were married to another and thus unable to enter into the contract. Also, certain relationships of blood render the parties unable to enter into contract. ===Lack of canonical form=== Members of the Catholic Church are required to marry in front of a priest (or deacon), and normally with at least one other witness, which can be a layperson. The priest or deacon is not the minister of the sacrament; the husband and wife are the ministers by exchanging vows, though the cleric presides over the exchange of the vows and any Mass or nuptial liturgical celebration (CCC 1630). If one of the parties is Catholic, but there is a serious reason why the marriage should be celebrated in front of a civil servant or a non-Catholic minister, a dispensation can be granted. If no dispensation was granted and the couple did not observe this law, the marriage is considered invalid. Because the nullity of the marriage is clear from the circumstances there is no need for a canonical process to issue a Declaration of Nullity. The correction of this invalidity requires the couple to exchange their consent according to canonical form (commonly called \\"convalidation\\"). ===Impediments=== If one of the parties were prohibited from marrying by a diriment impediment (from the Latin for \\"interrupting\\"), the marriage is invalid. Because these impediments may not be known at all, the marriage is called a putative marriage if at least one of the parties married in good faith. Diriment impediments include: * One or both parties is below the absolute minimum age of 16 for males and 14 for femalesCode of Canon Law, canon 1083 * Antecedent and perpetual impotence (not to be confused with sterility)Code of Canon Law, canon 1084 * Ligamen, or being already married1983 Code of Canon Law, Can. 1085 * The situation in which one party is a Catholic and the other has not been baptized (unless a dispensation is granted)Code of Canon Law, canon 1086 * The man was ordained to holy ordersCode of Canon Law, canon 1087 * Either party made a public perpetual vow of chastity in a religious instituteCode of Canon Law, canon 1088 * Abduction with the intent of marriage (known as raptus), is an impediment as long as the person remains in the kidnapper's powerCode of Canon Law, canon 1089 *Impediment of Crime, bringing about the death of one's spouse, or the spouse of another, with the intention of marriageCode of Canon Law, Canon 1090 . * Consanguinity, or close relationship by blood, even if the relationship is only by lawCode of Canon Law, Canon 1091 . * Affinity, or close relationship by marriageCode of Canon Law, Canon 1092 . Some of these laws can be relaxed by a dispensation before the ceremony. For example, Catherine of Aragon and Henry VIII of England received a dispensation from the impediment of affinity (Catherine had previously been married to Henry's brother Arthur, who died). Henry later based his request for annulment from Catherine (which largely led to the reformation of the Church of England) on the grounds that the dispensation was improperly given in that his father, Henry VII, had pressured the Archbishop of Canterbury into granting the dispensation. The correction of this invalidity after the marriage requires first that the impediment has ceased or has been dispensed, and then a \\"convalidation\\" can take place or a sanatio in radice can be granted to make the marriage valid. ===Grounds for nullity=== A marriage may be declared invalid because at least one of the two parties was not free to consent to the marriage or did not fully commit to the marriage. Grounds for nullity include: * Simulation of consent; that is, the conscious and positive exclusion at consent by either or both of the contracting parties of one or all of the essential properties or \\"goods\\" of marriage: a) exclusivity of the marital relationship; b) the permanence of the marital bond; c) openness to offspring as the natural fruit of marriage (canon 1101§2) * Deliberate deceit about some personal quality that can objectively and gravely perturb conjugal life (canon 1098) * Conditional consent, if the condition at the time of marriage concerns the future, or if it concerns the past or present and is actually unfulfilled (canon 1102Note that consenting conditionally, even regarding past or present, is still illicit unless allowed by the ordinary) * Force or grave fear imposed on a person to obtain their consent (canon 1103) * A serious lack of the discretion of judgment at consent concerning the essential matrimonial rights and duties mutually to be handed over and accepted (canon 1095 n.2) *Psychic incapacity at consent to undertake the essential obligations of marriage (canon 1095 n.3). According to Canon 1095 a marriage can be declared null only when consent was given in the presence of some grave lack of discretionary judgment regarding the essential rights and obligations of marriage, or of some real incapacity to assume these essential obligations. Pope Benedict XVI in his address to the Roman Rota in 2009, echoing words of his predecessor John Paul II, has criticized \\"the exaggerated and almost automatic multiplication of declarations of nullity of marriage in cases of the failure of marriage on the pretext of some immaturity or psychic weakness on the part of the contracting parties\\". Calling for \\"the reaffirmation of the innate human capacity for matrimony\\", he insisted on the point made in 1987 by John Paul II that \\"only incapacity and not difficulty in giving consent invalidates a marriage\\". ==Process== Marriages declared null under the Catholic Church are considered as void ab initio, meaning that the marriage was invalid from the beginning. Some worry that their children will be considered illegitimate if they get an annulment. However, Canon 1137 of the 1983 Code of Canon Law specifically affirms the legitimacy of children born in both valid and putative marriages (objectively invalid, though at least one party celebrated in good faith). Critics point to this as additional evidence that a Catholic annulment is similar to divorce; although civil laws regard the offspring of all marriages as legitimate. However, there are some significant differences between divorce and annulment. Divorce is concerned merely with the legal effects of marriage. Annulment, however, is also concerned with the reality of whether or not a true marriage was ever formed. This leads to the second difference. At least in most countries, divorce is always possible. However, not all applications for marriage nullity are granted. An annulment from the Catholic Church is independent from obtaining a civil annulment (or, in some cases, a divorce). Although, before beginning an annulment process before an ecclesiastical tribunal, it has to be clear that the marriage cannot be rebuilt. Some countries, such as Italy, allow the annulment process to substitute for the civil act of divorce. In many jurisdictions, some of the grounds the Catholic Church recognizes as sufficient for annulment are not considered grounds for a civil annulment. In such cases, the couple will often need to be divorced by the civil authorities to be able to remarry in the jurisdiction. Once the Church annuls a marriage it would generally prefer that the marriage be subsequently annulled by the civil courts. However, should this not prove feasible, a civil divorce is acceptable. If someone has been married previously and the first spouse is still alive, he or she must have received a Declaration of Nullity before entering into a marriage in the Catholic Church, even if neither party in the marriage was Catholic (privilege of faith being separate cases). The Catholic Church treats as indissoluble and valid every marriage when it is the first marriage for both parties. However, the church does not recognise as valid a marriage when one of the parties is Catholic but the marriage was not celebrated before a Catholic priest (unless a dispensation was first obtained). Canon law presumes that all marriages are valid until proven otherwise.1983 Code of Canon Law, Canon 1060 Annulment respondents who want to use canon law to defend their marriage against declarations of invalidity have the right to have a competent advocate assisting them. An advocate is like a lawyer. Respondents have the right to read the petition (called libellus, meaning \\"little book\\") of the petitioner. The petition must describe, in a general way, the facts and proofs that the petitioner is using as the basis for alleging that parties' marriage is invalid. It is necessary that tribunal judges study the jurisprudence of the Roman Rota, since the rota is responsible to promote the unity of jurisprudence and, through its own sentences, to be of assistance to lower tribunals (Dignitas Connubii, art. 35, citing Pastor bonus, art.126). Annulment respondents can use case law from the Roman Rota to support their defense of marriage. In order to obtain a declaration of nullity, the parties must approach a Catholic diocesan tribunal. Most applications for nullity that are heard by the tribunal are granted because one or both of the parties are judged to have given invalid consent. In order to give valid consent, the parties must give it freely. They must have a basic understanding of what they are doing and have given some thought and evaluation to their decision to enter marriage (1983 CIC, Canon 1095). They must be capable of fulfilling the promises they make on the wedding day; that is, not suffer from any psychological infirmity (Canon 1095) that will prevent them from giving themselves in a partnership of the whole of life that has as its ends the good of the spouses and the procreation and education of children (canon 1055). They must intend the words that they speak on the wedding day; that is, intend to form a permanent and faithful partnership, open to sexual acts that are procreative (canon 1101). Serious failures in these areas can allow a possible successful application for marriage nullity. There are other reasons that might justify an allegation of invalid consent, such as a serious error concerning the person to whom marriage promises are made (Canon 1097), one party being seriously deceived by the other at the time of the wedding (Canon 1098) or one of the parties being subjected to force or grave fear without which the marriage would not be occurring (Canon 1103). Church tribunals are courts. As with any court, the person bringing the matter before the judges must prove his or her case; advocates and Tribunals will advise applicants as to how they can present the evidence necessary to prove a case. An affirmative decision is granted when the majority of Judges reaches the \\"Moral certainty\\" that the petitioner proved his case. Moral certainty cannot exist if, objectively speaking, there are probable indications of the contrary in a case, and it differs from other standard of decision (i.e. \\"beyond reasonable doubt\\"). Approximately 94% of petitions filed in the United States are granted, and although the United States has only 6% of the world's Catholics, it accounts for 60% of the annulments granted worldwide, leading Bai MacFarlane to suggest that the Church cooperates with the \\"evil of no-fault divorce\\". Pope John Paul II expressed concern over the relative ease with which an annulment can be obtained in the United States. The tribunal judges are tasked with distinguishing those unions that were flawed from the outset from those valid marriages that have broken down. ==Numbers== Worldwide, diocesan tribunals completed over 49,000 cases for nullity of marriage in 2006. Over the past 30 years about 55 to 70% of annulments have occurred in the United States. The growth in annulments has been substantial; in the United States, 27,000 marriages were declared null in 2006, compared to 338 in 1968. ==Other considerations== Pope John Paul II and Pope Benedict XVI were worried about the ease with which annulments were being granted, especially when premised on ill-defined grounds such as \\"immaturity or psychic weakness\\" or \\"psychic immaturity\\", an expression of concern that the term \\"annulment\\" is being regarded as synonymous with \\"divorce\\". Pope Francis expressed worries over the fact that probably \\"half of all marriages are null\\" \\"Francis’ Press Conference on Return Flight From Brazil (Part 2)\\", ZENIT, 2.08.2013 in the light of canon law. This observation was one of the reasons for calling an extraordinary synod of bishops on the family in October 2014.Douthat, Ross. \\"Against Walter Kasper (I)\\", The New York Times, 21 May 2014. Pope Francis later reformed the matrimonial nullity trial process in 2015. A declaration of nullity made by the Catholic Church is distinct from a civil divorce. A civil divorce may serve as proof for the ecclesiastical tribunal that the marriage cannot be rebuilt. In some countries, such as Italy, in which Catholic Church marriages are automatically transcribed to the civil records, a Church declaration of nullity may be granted the exequatur and treated as the equivalent of a civil divorce. ==Catholic view of Eastern Orthodox processAnnulments granted by Eastern Orthodox tribunals=== The Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches (CCEO), the body of Oriental canon law for the Eastern Catholic Churches, in Canon 780 follows the Second Vatican Council's teaching that the tribunals of the Eastern Orthodox Churches have a valid annulment process to declare a marriage null. If an Orthodox tribunal holds that the marriage was invalid from its inception, that decision would be accepted by a marriage tribunal in the Catholic Church. ===Eastern Orthodox economy=== Some of the Eastern Orthodox Churches allow a second or third marriage in oikonomia (\\"economy\\"), which is not permitted in the Catholic Church. This concept states that the first marriage was valid and the second is allowed in the economy of salvation. The Catholic Church would see this as contrary to divine law and therefore invalid. The same impediment would exist as with divorce or \\"dissolution\\" of a bond (annulment) that is not in the favor of the faith.Roman Replies and CLSA Advisory Opinions 2000 \\"13. Canon 779 - Juridical Status of An Annulment Granted by a Coptic Orthodox Church\\", F. Steven Pedone and James I. Donlon (eds), Canon Law Society of America, 2000, pp 39-51. ==Declaration of nullity of ordination== The term \\"declaration of nullity\\" can also apply to cases in which ordinations are invalidly conferred.Code of Canon Law Annotated, 2nd Edition (Woodridge: Midwest Theological Forum, 2004) trans. The Canon Law Society of Great Britain and Ireland, p. 1138. ==Notable Catholic annulments== * The marriage of US Senator Ted Kennedy and his first wife, Joan, was declared null after Edward claimed he had not been truthful at the time of getting married when he vowed to be faithful to his spouse. * Joseph Kennedy II's marriage to Sheila Rauch Kennedy was declared null after he claimed lack of mental fitness to enter into the marriage; this annulment was later appealed by Sheila to the Vatican, which overturned the ruling in 2007. * Eadwig, King of the English, has his marriage to Ælfgifu, declared null on grounds that they were too closely related. * Louis VII of France and Eleanor of Aquitaine had their marriage declared null by a papal court in 1152 as they were distant cousins, after the birth of two daughters and despite a proclamation by Pope Eugene III in 1149 that no word could be spoken against their marriage and that it might not be dissolved under any pretext; each would go on to marry closer cousins. == Recent controversies regarding the granting of annulments in Catholicism == Popes Benedict XVI and John Paul II criticized the Catholic Church on the issue of the overuse of annulments to marriage, but Francis made changes to canon law to make it easier to get annulments.Pope Francis Reforms Annulment Process: 9 things to know and share , Catholic Answers, accessed 8 September 2015 He also asked dioceses to charge no fees for annulments \\"insofar as possible.\\"Annulment reform seems to cultivate change of culture Jun 5, 2017 by Dan Morris-Young ==See also== *Catholic doctrine regarding the Ten Commandments ==References== Category:Annulment Category:Matrimonial canon law Category:Sacramental law Category:Tribunals of the Catholic Church Category:Roman Rota Category:Catholic Church legal terminology ","title":"Declaration of nullity"},{"id":"6207040","text":"Tricia Vessey (born October 8, 1972) is an American actress, writer and producer with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Creative Writing and Film Production from Brooklyn College, New York.

It is affiliated with Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center, the academic medical center whose clinical arm is Wake Forest Baptist Health. In 2019, U.S. News & World Report ranked Wake Forest School of Medicine 50th best for research in the nation and 64th best for primary care. The School of Medicine also ranks in the top third of U.S. medical schools in funding from the National Institutes of Health (NIH). ==History and background== Statue of Bowman Gray (now relocated) at the former entrance to the School of Medicine In 1902, the two-year Wake Forest College Medical School was founded on the college campus in Wake Forest, North Carolina. Thirteen students made up the charter medical class. Tuition was $37.50 per term; additional fees were charged for laboratories and student health care. The Southern Baptist denomination in 1919 began its first planning for a hospital directed primarily at the care of the poor. Applications were received from Raleigh, High Point, Charlotte, Greensboro, Salisbury and Winston-Salem. The Southern Baptists chose Winston- Salem, and an 88-bed hospital opened there in 1923. In the wake of a 1935 Carnegie Foundation report suggesting the dissolution of two-year medical schools, those schools began to consider alternatives. Meanwhile, the death of Bowman Gray, the president of R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. in Winston-Salem, also in 1935, led his family to consider how to best make use of $750,000 that he left to be put toward a community cause. The Gray family decided to offer the money to a medical school willing to relocate to Winston-Salem. After the University of North Carolina rejected a chance to obtain the money because it did not want to leave Chapel Hill, Wake Forest's medical school dean, Coy Cornelius Carpenter, in 1939 helped to forge a deal for the funds. In 1941, Bowman Gray School of Medicine opened on the campus of N.C. Baptist Hospital with 75 students, including 45 freshmen and 30 sophomores. The rest of Wake Forest University would follow the medical school to Winston-Salem in 1956, in an effort led by the family of R.J. Reynolds. The school became known for its innovative curriculum and prominent faculty members, including: * Camillo Artom, a renowned Italian biochemistry expert who fled Italy to escape fascism, and who, at Wake Forest, worked with lipids in research on atherosclerosis, among other subjects. * Richard Masland, a professor of psychiatry and neurology who later became director of the National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Blindness. He encouraged faculty to pursue research grants, which helped the school in its push toward research and growth as an academic medical center. *James Toole, a neurologist who opened the Stroke Center soon after arriving in 1962 and who wrote a widely used text, Cerebrovascular Disorders. A flurry of building projects beginning in the late 1950s and continuing today began a period of expansion that continues today. More than $700 million was spent on new buildings and equipment for the School of Medicine and medical center campus in the 1990s and 2000s. In 1997, the school was renamed Wake Forest University School of Medicine, and the medical school campus became the Bowman Gray Campus. On April 7, 2000, developer David Shannon announced plans for a three-story building in Piedmont Triad Research Park in downtown Winston-Salem which would house the medical school's physician assistant program. This would be the school's second department downtown; the Department of Physiology and Pharmacology had already moved into the research park's first building, Piedmont Triad Community Research Center. In 2011, the school's name would be changed slightly again, to Wake Forest School of Medicine, as a part of a restructuring that also renamed the institution's clinical component as Wake Forest Baptist Health. The School of Medicine's strong research focus is evident in its translational work, which raised about $345.5 million in licensing revenues from 2010-2014. The newer buildings and facilities that are a focus of research for students and faculty are Ardmore Tower, which is home to Brenner Children's Hospital, the J. Paul Sticht Center on Aging and Rehabilitation, the Comprehensive Cancer Center and Wake Forest Innovation Quarter. The latter is a 200-acre, mixed-used center in downtown Winston-Salem focusing on the biomedical and material sciences and information technology fields. Tenants at the Innovation Quarter include the Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine (WFIRM), which was established in 2004 and has risen to national prominence. WFIRM's scientists are working to engineer more than 30 different replacement tissues and organs and to develop healing cell therapies—all with the goal to cure, rather than merely treat, disease. Tiered learning classroom at Wake Forest School of Medicine Wake Forest School of Medicine - Bowman Gray Center for Medical Education In July 2016, the School of Medicine opened the Bowman Gray Center for Medical Education, a $50 million, state-of-the-art building in downtown Winston-Salem's Innovation Quarter. The new campus occupies 168,000 square feet in a former R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company plant next to Wake Forest Biotech Place, with half the cost being paid for by historic tax credits. ==Admissions and rankings== For the entering class of 2023, 10,703 students applied for admission, 504 were interviewed, and 326 were accepted for 145 spots giving rise to a 3% acceptance rate. ==Academics and curriculum== The School of Medicine is a member of the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) and is accredited by the Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME), which is jointly sponsored by the Council on Medical Education of the American Medical Association (AMA) and the AAMC. In 2017, the 'Wake Ready!' curriculum was implemented changing the focus from the traditional 2 preclinical + 2 clinical years of curriculum to three phases. During the first phase, Foundations, which is 18 months in length, basic science courses are integrated with both clinical and patient care organized by systems. Additionally, students learn about bedside clinical skills, bioethics and population health. The second phase, Immersion, is 12 months in length, allows students to rotate through a series of required clerkships in which the students are members of the medical team learning to treat patients in a hospital setting. Students complete 8 weeks of internal medicine, 7 weeks of surgery, 6 weeks of pediatrics, 2 weeks of ambulatory internal medicine, 7 weeks of obstetrics/gynecology & women's health, 4 weeks of family medicine, 4 weeks of psychiatry, 4 weeks of neurology, and 2 weeks of anesthesiology during this time. Additionally, radiology and basic clinical procedures are integrated longitudinally. The last phase, Individualization, is 14 months in length and allows for students to choose their rotations based on their interests and future career plans, including time for research or away rotations at other institutions. Students also have the opportunity to do electives in foreign countries and gain exposure to the differences in care in other countries. Students do clinical and research work primarily with Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center, Wake Forest Baptist Health—Brenner Children's Hospital, W.G. Hefner Salisbury Veterans Affairs Medical Center and the Virginia Tech-Wake Forest School of Biomedical Engineering and Sciences. ==Joint degree programs== The School of Medicine offers, in conjunction with Wake Forest University's Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, a joint M.D./Ph.D. degree from the M.D./Ph.D. Program It also offers a joint M.D./M.A. degree in bioethics. The joint Ph.D./M.B.A. program was established in 1999 by the Wake Forest University Graduate School of Arts and Sciences and the Schools of Business, with the goal of providing Ph.D. scientists with the opportunity to obtain advanced business training and internship opportunities. Finally, there is an M.D./M.S. offered in Clinical and Population Translational Sciences through Wake Forest University's Department of Public Health Sciences. ==Institutes and centers== Physicians, scientists and students at Wake Forest School of Medicine often work in the research- or education-based institutes and centers affiliated with the school. These include: Institutes and research-based centers * Childress Institute for Pediatric Trauma * Clinical and Translational Science Institute * Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine * Brain Tumor Center of Excellence * Center for Biomedical Informatics * Center for Biomolecular Imaging * Center for Cancer Genomics * Center for Diabetes Research * Center for Genomics and Personalized Medicine Research * Center for Integrative Medicine * Center for Worker Health * Comprehensive Cancer Center * Hypertension and Vascular Research Center * Maya Angelou Center for Health Equity * J.

Delivering Equal Access to Care (DEAC) is a student-run clinic serving uninsured, low-income residents of Winston-Salem. Oasis is an online magazine that publishes student artistic and literary works. Other student organizations include interest groups that correspond with particular specialties and Wake Forest chapters of the American Medical Association, Student National Medical Association and Operation Smile. Many students also are active in intramural sports organized through the university. A significant number of students also participate in research, and the Medical Student Research Program funds student research projects during the summer between their first and second years. The School of Medicine also participates in the Albert Schweitzer Fellowship program, with a number of students winning fellowships each year. ==Notable faculty and alumni== Anthony Atala, M.D. Thomas Marshburn, M.D. * William Allan, genetics * Anthony Atala, regenerative medicine and urology * Ken Blum, neuropsychopharmacology and genetics * Paul Bucy, neurology and neurosurgery * Coy Cornelius Carpenter, dean * Richard Cytowic, neurology * James Forrester, politician * Max Gomez, medical reporter * Tinsley Randolph Harrison, internal medicine * David L.

The area known as Moss Park is typically considered to be between Jarvis Street and Parliament Street, south of Dundas Street, an area dominated by public housing projects. According to one set of boundaries of the City of Toronto, it is roughly L-shaped, bounded on the north by Carlton Street to Parliament Street, on the east by Parliament Street to Queen Street East and the Don River, on the south by Eastern Avenue and Front Street, and on the west by Jarvis Street. This larger concept of the area includes the neighbourhoods known as Corktown and the Garden District, as well as a portion of Cabbagetown. ==Character== George Allan The neighbourhood is named after the original 'Moss Park' estate of the Allan family (which included William Allan and his son, George Allan), whose mansion stood on the west side of Sherbourne street, between Queen and Shuter streets. The Allan family's former mansion was later demolished during the 1960s 'urban renewal' redevelopment of the area into a housing project, with a large park and community centre on the site of the old estate. In the 1960s, many buildings were demolished to make way for three large public housing towers Much of the Moss Park area was originally built to supply homes for the workers in the industrial area to the south of the neighbourhood. During the 1960s, a large number of these buildings were demolished to make way for the Moss Park public housing project, a group of three large towers at Queen and Parliament streets (run by the Toronto Community Housing Corporation). The neighbourhood immediately around the housing complex is the area typically meant when referring to Moss Park today. This neighbourhood is comprised almost exclusively of rental units, and it houses many low-income families. According to Toronto Life, \\"Moss Park has long had a reputation among Torontonians as a notoriously downtrodden and dangerous neighbourhood.\\" It is home to several homeless shelters. The northeast corner of Jarvis and Queen streets is occupied by Moss Park Armoury, which is used by several regiments of the Canadian Forces Primary Reserve. These include the 25 Field Ambulance, the 48th Highlanders of Canada, the 7th Toronto Regiment Royal Canadian Artillery, and the Queen's Own Rifles of Canada. Several cadet units also use the facility. Along Queen Street, the predominant building style is the three to five-storey building, with retail businesses on the ground floor and walk-up apartments on upper floors. ===Landmarks=== * Moss Park Armoury * 252 Queen Street East – Kim's Convenience store front used by the television show of the same name ==Transportation== The 501 Queen Street and 505 Dundas Street streetcar routes operate east-west in the neighbourhood. Bus routes include the 75 Sherbourne along Sherbourne from Rosedale to Queen's Quay, and the 65 Parliament Street bus from Castle Frank subway station south to the Esplanade. ==In popular culture== The neighbourhood is the main setting for the TV series Kim's Convenience and features in on-location shoots. ==References *City of Toronto - Moss Park Neighbourhood Profile *Toronto neighbourhoods - Moss Park *Toronto Life rankings - Moss Park *Moss Park Home of William Allan – Lost Rivers Category:Neighbourhoods in Toronto ","title":"Moss Park"},{"id":"6207066","text":"Ariston of Collytus (; died c. 424 BC), was the father of the Greek philosopher Plato (originally named Aristocles).

He played key roles in the conquest of Fort Ticonderoga at the start of the war, during the American invasion of Canada in 1775-1776, and once again in 1777 during Lieutenant General John Burgoyne's invasion of the United States by way of Lake Champlain and the Hudson River. Brown was the first man to bring formal charges against Benedict Arnold, who was then a prominent American general. Brown died in battle at Stone Arabia in the Mohawk Valley in 1780. ==Early life== Brown was born in Haverhill, in eastern Massachusetts, the youngest son of Daniel Brown and Mehitable Sanford Brown. Soon after his birth, the family moved to Enfield in central Massachusetts and then to Sandisfield in Berkshire County, which was then frontier. Daniel Brown was one of the earliest settlers in Sandisfield and a \\"principal inhabitant.\\" Some confusion exists about John Brown's education. Without question, he attended Yale College, graduating in 1771, and he studied law under the guidance of his sister Elizabeth's husband, Oliver Arnold of Providence, Rhode Island, who was the state's attorney general and an uncle of New Haven, Connecticut, merchant Benedict Arnold. Most historians assume that Brown attended Yale first and then read law. However, Arnold died in the fall of 1770, making this chronology impossible.Henry Cruger Van Schaack, \\"Colonel John Brown, 'A Prophet Hath No Honor in His Own Country,'\\" Massachusetts Historical Society. David Humphreys, Yale classmate, soldier, poet, and friend Brown was a close friend to Yale classmate David Humphreys, who went on to be staff officer in the Continental army, a diplomat, George Washington's private secretary, and one of the Connecticut Wits. Both Humphreys and Brown were founding members of Yale's society of Brothers in Unity. Humphrey's lengthy poem \\"Address to the Armies of the United States of America\\" mentions Brown's death as a notable and tragic event in the Revolution. Brown began his law practice in Caughnawaga (Johnstown), New York, and was appointed king's attorney. He resigned that position, settled in Pittsfield, and was chosen as representative to the General Court of Massachusetts, the colony's legislature. == American Revolution  Mission to Canada === In March 1775, as a member of the Massachusetts Committee of Correspondence, Brown was sent to Montreal by way of Lake Champlain to meet with Canadians interested in joining the other 13 colonies in their dispute with the British government. He received support from Thomas Walker and other leading British-American merchants, but concluded, \\"There is no prospect of Canada sending Delegates to the Continental Congress.\\" He reported, \\"One thing I must mention, to be kept as a profound secret. The Fort at Ticonderoga must be seized as soon as possible, should hostilities be committed by the King' s Troops.\\" Peter Force, American Archives, Ser. 4, vol. 2: 244.Lanctot, pp. 38-39 === Fort Ticonderoga === Reconstructed Fort Ticonderoga As part of the Pittsfield militia company commanded by Colonel James Easton, Brown participated in the successful surprise attack on Fort Ticonderoga on May 10, 1775. Ethan Allen and Benedict Arnold clashed over who had overall command of the expedition. In this dispute, Brown was an Allen supporter.Lucius Chittenden, The Capture of Ticonderoga (1872). Allen selected Brown to carry the news of the victory to the Continental Congress in Philadelphia, an honor given to a young officer who has distinguished himself. === Summer and Fall Campaign 1775 === In the summer of 1775, Brown acted as a spy in Canada, reporting back to Major General Philip Schuyler and Brigadier General Richard Montgomery about British efforts to improve the fortifications at Fort St. John (Saint-Jean) on the Richelieu River and to build vessels-of-war to sail on Lake Champlain. On September 17, 1775 Brown with 80 men opened action north of Fort St John but was driven back by 200 British and Canadians but not before he destroyed a key bridge and captured supplies en route to the Fort. On September 24, Ethan Allen was captured while attempting to take Montreal. Brown's role is far from clear. Allen later claimed that he and Brown had agreed on a joint attack, but that Brown failed to follow through on his part of the plan.Ethan Allen, The Narrative of Colonel Ethan Allen, original edition 1779, Applewood Books, p. 15-16. In his The Natural and Political History of the State of Vermont (1798), Allen's brother Ira added Colonel Seth Warner to the plan. In this account, Brown and Warner found the nighttime crossing of the St. Lawrence too dangerous and went \\"quietly to rest.\\" \\"The conduct of Brown and Warner is hard to be accounted for, on any principles honourable to themselves,\\" Ira Allen wrote.Ira Allen, The Natural and Political History of Vermont (1969, original 1798), 46. However, at the time Brown received no criticism from commanding officers, who blamed Allen's \\"imprudence\\" alone for the disaster. Defenders of Brown have pointed to his reputation for heroism throughout the war and have questioned the truthfulness of Ethan and Ira Allen.John J. Duffy and H. Nicholas Muller III, Inventing Ethan Allen, University Press of New England (2014), 43-60. On October 18, 1775, Brown joined with James Livingston, 50 Americans, and 300 Canadians, to lay siege and capture the British Fort Chambly along with six tons of gun powder, 6000 musket cartridges, and 134 barrels of pork. The action was key to the surrender of Fort St. John and then the city of Montreal. General Montgomery wrote of Brown, \\"Upon this and all other occasions I have found him active and intelligent.\\"Richard Montgomery to Philip Sschuyler, October 20, 1775, American Archives, Ser. 4, 3: 1132-1133. On November 19–20, at Sorel on the St. Lawrence River, Brown forced the surrender of a British fleet of 11sails by exaggerating the size and number of the guns in the American batteries. Benedict Arnold later accused Brown and Colonel James Easton of plundering the captured British ships. === Winter 1775 === Unequipped for winter, many men from northwestern New England returned home after the surrender of Montreal. But Brown took command of a small regiment made up of those who remained and accompanied General Montgomery to Quebec where they joined with Benedict Arnold in besieging the city. Quebec in 1775 With many enlistments due to expire with the New Year, the small army was in turmoil. Three captains asked to be transferred to the command of someone other than Arnold. \\"I am much afraid my friend [blank] is deeply concerned in this business. I will have an eclaircissement with him on the subject,\\" wrote Montgomery. Many historians believe that the blank in Montgomery's letter represented John Brown.Richard Montgomery to Philip Schuyler, Dec. 26, 1775, American Archives, Ser. 4, 4:463-464.Justin H. Smith, Our Struggle for the Fourteenth Colony: Canada and the American Revolution (G.P. Putnam's Sons, 1907), 121-122.James Kirby Martin, Benedict Arnold, Revolutionary Hero: An American Warrior Reconsidered (New York University Press, 1997), 164. During the Battle of Quebec, fought in the early morning of December 31, Brown and Livingston were responsible for a diversionary attack on the upper walled city while Montgomery and Arnold attacked from opposite sides of the Lower Town. Montgomery was killed and Arnold was wounded; Brown's diversion failed. === Death at Stone Arabia === Brown was killed in action on his 36th birthday at the Battle of Klock's Field, on the Mohawk Valley frontier. ==See also== *Intelligence in the American Revolutionary War *Intelligence operations in the American Revolutionary War ==Notes== Brown died in the battle of Stone Arabia, see New York in the revolution published 1876 and many other sources. ==References== * * * ==External links== *Newsletter \\"Stone Arabia Battle Chapter, Sons of The American Revolution\\": March 1995 issue Category:1744 births Category:1780 deaths Category:Military personnel killed in the American Revolutionary War Category:Massachusetts militiamen in the American Revolution Category:Politicians from Pittsfield, Massachusetts Category:Yale University alumni Category: Politicians Category:Massachusetts politicians by city Category:American spies during the American Revolution ","title":"John Brown of Pittsfield"},{"id":"6207080","text":"Chief engineer in the engine room of MF Bastø II, a Norwegian ferry A chief engineer, commonly referred to as \\"ChEng\\" or \\"Chief\\", is the seniormost engine officer of an engine department on a ship, typically a merchant ship, and holds overall leadership and the responsibility of that department.Marine Chief Engineer As a person who holds one of the most senior roles on the ship, they must have excellent communication and leadership skills.

It was built on the original site of the University of Washington's first campus. The hotel opened in 1924, and in 1979, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places. ==History== After World War I, Seattle's Chamber of Commerce appointed a committee to work toward the goal of bringing a world-class hotel to the city. The committee identified an undeveloped portion of the city's Metropolitan Tract, a downtown area covering four blocks, as an ideal location for a new hotel. The Tract was also known as Denny's Knoll, after Arthur A. Denny, one of Seattle's founders, who had donated the land for the Territorial University, which would later become the University of Washington. The university had relocated to a campus north of Portage Bay in 1895, but still owned the downtown tract of land. The university's Board of Regents leased the land to the Metropolitan Building Company in 1904, with the agreement that it would be developed in trust for the university for the next 50 years. The Seattle Times held a contest to name the hotel. From 3,906 entries, the committee chose The Olympic. In 1922, once the lease had gone into effect, the Community Hotel Corporation chose New York architect George B. Post & Son to design the building; the local firm Bebb and Gould—a partnership between Charles Bebb and Carl Gould—were hired as the local supervising architects. Post created an Italian Renaissance design that was popular at the time, and this design remains one of the building's hallmarks today. Olympic Hotel, circa 1925 Builders broke ground on April 1, 1923, and construction began. The steel frame was started in January 1924, and by November, the building was completed. The total cost for construction was $5.5 million, with $800,000 going to furnishings alone. Upon its opening in 1923, the hotel was operated by Niagara Falls businessman Frank A. Dudley and the United Hotels Company. The Olympic Hotel's grand opening took place on December 6, 1924, with a grand dinner and dance attended by more than 2,000 Seattle residents and their guests. Hundreds more people lined the streets just to catch a glimpse of the new hotel. In 1953, the University of Washington's Board of Regents extended the hotel's lease. At the same time, they approved a plan to demolish the Metropolitan Theatre, around which The Olympic Hotel had been built. The theatre had been a Seattle institution since it opened on October 2, 1911. The theatre's last night was December 4, 1954, hosting a performance of What Every Woman Knows starring Helen Hayes. The theatre was torn down, and a new entrance to the hotel was built in its place. On August 1, 1955, Western Hotels assumed management of The Olympic Hotel. Western, later renamed Westin, operated the Olympic until September 1, 1980, when it was taken over by Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts, Four Seasons undertook a $60 million renovation and the hotel reopened in 1981. In the mid-1990s, the University of Washington sold a 64 percent stake in the hotel to Chicago-based real-estate investment firm JMB Realty. In 2003, UW and JMB sold the Olympic to Legacy Hotels, which turned management of the property over to Fairmont Hotels & Resorts. At that time, the hotel was renamed Fairmont Olympic Hotel. ==References== Category:National Register of Historic Places in Seattle Category:Fairmont Hotels and Resorts Category:Hotels established in 1924 Category:Hotel buildings completed in 1924 Category:Hotels in Seattle Category:Hotel buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in Washington (state) Category:United Hotels Company of America Category:Downtown Seattle Category:Historic Hotels Worldwide ","title":"Fairmont Olympic Hotel"},{"id":"6207110","text":"Perictione ( Periktiónē; fl. 5th century BC) was the mother of the Greek philosopher Plato.

These are distinguished from seismic intensity scales that categorize the intensity or severity of ground shaking (quaking) caused by an earthquake at a given location. Magnitudes are usually determined from measurements of an earthquake's seismic waves as recorded on a seismogram. Magnitude scales vary on what aspect of the seismic waves are measured and how they are measured. Different magnitude scales are necessary because of differences in earthquakes, the information available, and the purposes for which the magnitudes are used. == Earthquake magnitude and ground-shaking intensity == The Earth's crust is stressed by tectonic forces. When this stress becomes great enough to rupture the crust, or to overcome the friction that prevents one block of crust from slipping past another, energy is released, some of it in the form of various kinds of seismic waves that cause ground-shaking, or quaking. Magnitude is an estimate of the relative \\"size\\" or strength of an earthquake, and thus its potential for causing ground-shaking. It is \\"approximately related to the released seismic energy.\\". The relationship between magnitude and the energy released is complicated. See §3.1.2.5 and §3.3.3 for details. Isoseismal map for the 1968 Illinois earthquake. The irregular distribution of shaking arises from variations of geology and/or ground conditions. Intensity refers to the strength or force of shaking at a given location, and can be related to the peak ground velocity. With an isoseismal map of the observed intensities (see illustration) an earthquake's magnitude can be estimated from both the maximum intensity observed (usually but not always near the epicenter), and from the extent of the area where the earthquake was felt.. The intensity of local ground-shaking depends on several factors besides the magnitude of the earthquake,. one of the most important being soil conditions. For instance, thick layers of soft soil (such as fill) can amplify seismic waves, often at a considerable distance from the source, while sedimentary basins will often resonate, increasing the duration of shaking. This is why, in the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, the Marina district of San Francisco was one of the most damaged areas, though it was nearly 100 km from the epicenter.. Geological structures were also significant, such as where seismic waves passing under the south end of San Francisco Bay reflected off the base of the Earth's crust towards San Francisco and Oakland. A similar effect channeled seismic waves between the other major faults in the area.. == Magnitude scales == Typical seismogram. The compressive P-waves (following the red lines) – essentially sound passing through rock – are the fastest seismic waves, and arrive first, typically in about 10 seconds for an earthquake around 50 km away. The sideways-shaking S-waves (following the green lines) arrive some seconds later, traveling a little over half the speed of the P-waves; the delay is a direct indication of the distance to the quake. S-waves may take an hour to reach a point 1000 km away. Both of these are body-waves, that pass directly through the earth's crust. Following the S-waves are various kinds of surface-waves – Love waves and Rayleigh waves – that travel only at the earth's surface. Surface waves are smaller for deep earthquakes, which have less interaction with the surface. For shallow earthquakes – less than roughly 60 km deep – the surface waves are stronger, and may last several minutes; these carry most of the energy of the quake, and cause the most severe damage. An earthquake radiates energy in the form of different kinds of seismic waves, whose characteristics reflect the nature of both the rupture and the earth's crust the waves travel through.See , Chapters 2 and 3, for a very readable explanation of these waves and their interpretation. J. R. Kayal's excellent description of seismic waves can be found here. Determination of an earthquake's magnitude generally involves identifying specific kinds of these waves on a seismogram, and then measuring one or more characteristics of a wave, such as its timing, orientation, amplitude, frequency, or duration.See , pp. 20–21, for a short explanation, or MNSOP-2 for a technical description. Additional adjustments are made for distance, kind of crust, and the characteristics of the seismograph that recorded the seismogram. The various magnitude scales represent different ways of deriving magnitude from such information as is available. All magnitude scales retain the logarithmic scale as devised by Charles Richter, and are adjusted so the mid-range approximately correlates with the original \\"Richter\\" scale.. Most magnitude scales are based on measurements of only part of an earthquake's seismic wave-train, and therefore are incomplete. This results in systematic underestimation of magnitude in certain cases, a condition called saturation.. Since 2005 the International Association of Seismology and Physics of the Earth's Interior (IASPEI) has standardized the measurement procedures and equations for the principal magnitude scales, , , , and .IASPEI . === \\"Richter\\" magnitude scale === The first scale for measuring earthquake magnitudes, developed in 1935 by Charles F. Richter and popularly known as the \\"Richter\\" scale, is actually the , label ML or ML.. Richter established two features now common to all magnitude scales. First, the scale is logarithmic, so that each unit represents a ten- fold increase in the amplitude of the seismic waves.. As the energy of a wave is 101.5 times its amplitude, each unit of magnitude represents a nearly 32-fold increase in the seismic energy (strength) of an earthquake.. Second, Richter arbitrarily defined the zero point of the scale to be where an earthquake at a distance of 100 km makes a maximum horizontal displacement of 0.001 millimeters (1 µm, or 0.00004 in.) on a seismogram recorded with a Wood- Anderson torsion seismograph.; . Subsequently redefined by as 10 mm of motion by an quake at 17 km. Subsequent magnitude scales are calibrated to be approximately in accord with the original \\"Richter\\" (local) scale around magnitude 6.; , figure 2. All \\"Local\\" (ML) magnitudes are based on the maximum amplitude of the ground shaking, without distinguishing the different seismic waves. They underestimate the strength: * of distant earthquakes (over ~600 km) because of attenuation of the S-waves, * of deep earthquakes because the surface waves are smaller, and * of strong earthquakes (over M ~7) because they do not take into account the duration of shaking. The original \\"Richter\\" scale, developed in the geological context of Southern California and Nevada, was later found to be inaccurate for earthquakes in the central and eastern parts of the continent (everywhere east of the Rocky Mountains) because of differences in the continental crust.. All these problems prompted the development of other scales. Most seismological authorities, such as the United States Geological Survey, report earthquake magnitudes above 4.0 as moment magnitude (below), which the press describes as \\"Richter magnitude\\".The \\"USGS Earthquake Magnitude Policy\\" for reporting earthquake magnitudes to the public as formulated by the USGS Earthquake Magnitude Working Group was implemented January 18, 2002, and posted at https://earthquake.usgs.gov/aboutus/docs/020204mag_policy.php. It has since been removed; a copy is archived at the Wayback Machine, and the essential part can be found here. === Other \\"Local\\" magnitude scales === Richter's original \\"local\\" scale has been adapted for other localities. These may be labelled \\"ML\\", or with a lowercase \\"\`l\`\\", either M\`l\`, or M\`l\`., p. 59. (Not to be confused with the Russian surface-wave MLH scale..) Whether the values are comparable depends on whether the local conditions have been adequately determined and the formula suitably adjusted.See Datasheet 3.1 in NMSOP-2 for a partial compilation and references.  Japanese Meteorological Agency magnitude scale  In Japan, for shallow (depth < 60 km) earthquakes within 600 km, the Japanese Meteorological Agency calculates; , p. 78; . a magnitude labeled MJMA, MJMA, or M\`J\`. (These should not be confused with moment magnitudes JMA calculates, which are labeled Mw(JMA) or M(JMA), nor with the Shindo intensity scale.) JMA magnitudes are based (as typical with local scales) on the maximum amplitude of the ground motion; they agree \\"rather well\\". with the seismic moment magnitude in the range of 4.5 to 7.5,See also figure 3.70 in NMSOP-2. but underestimate larger magnitudes. === Body-wave magnitude scales === Body-waves consist of P-waves that are the first to arrive (see seismogram), or S-waves, or reflections of either. Body-waves travel through rock directly..  mB scale  The original \\"body-wave magnitude\\" – mB' or mB (uppercase \\"B\\") – was developed by and ; . See also . to overcome the distance and magnitude limitations of the scale inherent in the use of surface waves. is based on the P- and S-waves, measured over a longer period, and does not saturate until around M 8. However, it is not sensitive to events smaller than about M 5.5.. Use of as originally defined has been largely abandoned,. now replaced by the standardized ' scale.MNSOP-2/IASPEI , pp. 15–16.  mb scale  The mb or mb scale (lowercase \\"m\\" and \\"b\\") is similar to , but uses only P-waves measured in the first few seconds on a specific model of short-period seismograph.; . It was introduced in the 1960s with the establishment of the World-Wide Standardized Seismograph Network (WWSSN); the short period improves detection of smaller events, and better discriminates between tectonic earthquakes and underground nuclear explosions.; examines this at length. Measurement of has changed several times.. As originally defined by mb was based on the maximum amplitude of waves in the first 10 seconds or more. However, the length of the period influences the magnitude obtained. Early USGS/NEIC practice was to measure on the first second (just the first few P-wavesIASPEI .), but since 1978 they measure the first twenty seconds.; . The modern practice is to measure short- period scale at less than three seconds, while the broadband ' scale is measured at periods of up to 30 seconds.IASPEI/NMSOP-2 .  mbLg scale  Differences in the crust underlying North America east of the Rocky Mountains makes that area more sensitive to earthquakes. Shown here: the 1895 New Madrid earthquake, M ~6, was felt through most of the central U.S., while the 1994 Northridge quake, though almost ten times stronger at M 6.7, was felt only in southern California. From USGS Fact Sheet 017-03. The regional mbLg scale – also denoted mb_Lg, mbLg, MLg (USGS), Mn, and mN – was developed by for a problem the original ML scale could not handle: all of North America east of the Rocky Mountains. The ML scale was developed in southern California, which lies on blocks of oceanic crust, typically basalt or sedimentary rock, which have been accreted to the continent. East of the Rockies the continent is a craton, a thick and largely stable mass of continental crust that is largely granite, a harder rock with different seismic characteristics. In this area the ML scale gives anomalous results for earthquakes which by other measures seemed equivalent to quakes in California. Nuttli resolved this by measuring the amplitude of short-period (~1 sec.) Lg waves,. The \\"g\\" subscript refers to the granitic layer through which Lg waves propagate. . See also J. R. Kayal, \\"Seismic Waves and Earthquake Location\\", here, page 5. a complex form of the Love wave which, although a surface wave, he found provided a result more closely related to the scale than the scale.. Lg waves attenuate quickly along any oceanic path, but propagate well through the granitic continental crust, and MbLg is often used in areas of stable continental crust; it is especially useful for detecting underground nuclear explosions.. === Surface-wave magnitude scales === Surface waves propagate along the Earth's surface, and are principally either Rayleigh waves or Love waves.. See especially figure 1-10. For shallow earthquakes the surface waves carry most of the energy of the earthquake, and are the most destructive. Deeper earthquakes, having less interaction with the surface, produce weaker surface waves. The surface-wave magnitude scale, variously denoted as Ms, MS, and Ms, is based on a procedure developed by Beno Gutenberg in 1942; based on work by . for measuring shallow earthquakes stronger or more distant than Richter's original scale could handle. Notably, it measured the amplitude of surface waves (which generally produce the largest amplitudes) for a period of \\"about 20 seconds\\".. The scale approximately agrees with at ~6, then diverges by as much as half a magnitude.. A revision by , sometimes labeled MSn,. measures only waves of the first second. A modification – the \\"Moscow-Prague formula\\" – was proposed in 1962, and recommended by the IASPEI in 1967; this is the basis of the standardized Ms20 scale (Ms_20, Ms(20)).. A \\"broad-band\\" variant (Ms_BB, Ms(BB)) measures the largest velocity amplitude in the Rayleigh-wave train for periods up to 60 seconds.MNSOP-2 . The MS7 scale used in China is a variant of Ms calibrated for use with the Chinese-made \\"type 763\\" long-period seismograph.. The MLH scale used in some parts of Russia is actually a surface wave magnitude.. === Moment magnitude and energy magnitude scales === Other magnitude scales are based on aspects of seismic waves that only indirectly and incompletely reflect the force of an earthquake, involve other factors, and are generally limited in some respect of magnitude, focal depth, or distance. The moment magnitude scale – Mw or Mw – developed by and , is based on an earthquake's seismic moment, M0, a measure of how much work an earthquake does in sliding one patch of rock past another patch of rock.The IASPEI standard formula for deriving moment magnitude from seismic moment is =(2/3)(log–9.1). Formula 3.68 in . Seismic moment is measured in Newton-meters (Nm or Nm) in the SI system of measurement, or dyne-centimeters (dyn-cm) in the older CGS system. In the simplest case the moment can be calculated knowing only the amount of slip, the area of the surface ruptured or slipped, and a factor for the resistance or friction encountered. These factors can be estimated for an existing fault to determine the magnitude of past earthquakes, or what might be anticipated for the future.. An earthquake's seismic moment can be estimated in various ways, which are the bases of the Mwb, Mwr, Mwc, Mww, Mwp, Mi, and Mwpd scales, all subtypes of the generic Mw scale. See for details. Seismic moment is considered the most objective measure of an earthquake's \\"size\\" in regard of total energy. However, it is based on a simple model of rupture, and on certain simplifying assumptions; it incorrectly assumes that the proportion of energy radiated as seismic waves is the same for all earthquakes.; . Much of an earthquake's total energy as measured by is dissipated as friction (resulting in heating of the crust). An earthquake's potential to cause strong ground shaking depends on the comparatively small fraction of energy radiated as seismic waves, and is better measured on the energy magnitude scale, Me.NMSOP-2 . The proportion of total energy radiated as seismic waves varies greatly depending on focal mechanism and tectonic environment;See for an extended discussion. and for very similar earthquakes can differ by as much as 1.4 units.NMSOP-2 . Despite the usefulness of the scale, it is not generally used due to difficulties in estimating the radiated seismic energy.. Two earthquakes differing greatly in the damage done In 1997 there were two large earthquakes off the coast of Chile. The magnitude of the first, in July, was estimated at , but was barely felt, and only in three places. In October a quake in nearly the same location, but twice as deep and on a different kind of fault, was felt over a broad area, injured over 300 people, and destroyed or seriously damaged over 10,000 houses. As can be seen in the table below, this disparity of damage done is not reflected in either the moment magnitude () nor the surface-wave magnitude (). Only when the magnitude is measured on the basis of the body-wave () or the seismic energy () is there a difference comparable to the difference in damage. { class= - – ! Date !! ISC # ! Lat. !! Long. !! Depth !!

Seen also in . === Energy class (K-class) scale === K (from the Russian word класс, \\"class\\", in the sense of a category .) is a measure of earthquake magnitude in the energy class or K-class system, developed in 1955 by Soviet seismologists in the remote Garm (Tadjikistan) region of Central Asia; in revised form it is still used for local and regional quakes in many states formerly aligned with the Soviet Union (including Cuba). Based on seismic energy (K = log ES, in Joules), difficulty in implementing it using the technology of the time led to revisions in 1958 and 1960. Adaptation to local conditions has led to various regional K scales, such as KF and KS.; NMSOP-2 ; . K values are logarithmic, similar to Richter-style magnitudes, but have a different scaling and zero point. K values in the range of 12 to 15 correspond approximately to M 4.5 to 6.. Additional regression formulas for various regions can be found in . See also . M(K), M(K), or possibly MK indicates a magnitude M calculated from an energy class K.. === Tsunami magnitude scales === Earthquakes that generate tsunamis generally rupture relatively slowly, delivering more energy at longer periods (lower frequencies) than generally used for measuring magnitudes. Any skew in the spectral distribution can result in larger, or smaller, tsunamis than expected for a nominal magnitude., p. 124. The tsunami magnitude scale, Mt, is based on a correlation by Katsuyuki Abe of earthquake seismic moment () with the amplitude of tsunami waves as measured by tidal gauges.; . More precisely, is based on far-field tsunami wave amplitudes in order to avoid some complications that happen near the source. . Originally intended for estimating the magnitude of historic earthquakes where seismic data is lacking but tidal data exist, the correlation can be reversed to predict tidal height from earthquake magnitude.. (Not to be confused with the height of a tidal wave, or run-up, which is an intensity effect controlled by local topography.) Under low-noise conditions, tsunami waves as little as 5 cm can be predicted, corresponding to an earthquake of M ~6.5.. Another scale of particular importance for tsunami warnings is the mantle magnitude scale, Mm.. This is based on Rayleigh waves that penetrate into the Earth's mantle, and can be determined quickly, and without complete knowledge of other parameters such as the earthquake's depth. === Duration and Coda magnitude scales=== Md designates various scales that estimate magnitude from the duration or length of some part of the seismic wave-train. This is especially useful for measuring local or regional earthquakes, both powerful earthquakes that might drive the seismometer off-scale (a problem with the analog instruments formerly used) and preventing measurement of the maximum wave amplitude, and weak earthquakes, whose maximum amplitude is not accurately measured. Even for distant earthquakes, measuring the duration of the shaking (as well as the amplitude) provides a better measure of the earthquake's total energy. Measurement of duration is incorporated in some modern scales, such as and .. Mc scales usually measure the duration or amplitude of a part of the seismic wave, the coda.. For short distances (less than ~100 km) these can provide a quick estimate of magnitude before the quake's exact location is known., pp. 71–72. === Macroseismic magnitude scales === Magnitude scales generally are based on instrumental measurement of some aspect of the seismic wave as recorded on a seismogram. Where such records do not exist, magnitudes can be estimated from reports of the macroseismic events such as described by intensity scales.. One approach for doing this (developed by Beno Gutenberg and Charles Richter in 1942.) relates the maximum intensity observed (presumably this is over the epicenter), denoted I0 (capital I with a subscripted zero), to the magnitude. It has been recommended that magnitudes calculated on this basis be labeled Mw(I0),. but are sometimes labeled with a more generic Mms. Another approach is to make an isoseismal map showing the area over which a given level of intensity was felt. The size of the \\"felt area\\" can also be related to the magnitude (based on the work of and ). While the recommended label for magnitudes derived in this way is M0(An),. the more commonly seen label is Mfa. A variant, MLa, adapted to California and Hawaii, derives the Local magnitude (ML) from the size of the area affected by a given intensity.. M\`I\` (upper-case letter \\"\`I\`\\", distinguished from the lower-case letter in M\`i\`) has been used for moment magnitudes estimated from isoseismal intensities calculated per .. Peak ground velocity (PGV) and Peak ground acceleration (PGA) are measures of the force that causes destructive ground shaking.. In Japan, a network of strong-motion accelerometers provides PGA data that permits site-specific correlation with different magnitude earthquakes. This correlation can be inverted to estimate the ground shaking at that site due to an earthquake of a given magnitude at a given distance. From this a map showing areas of likely damage can be prepared within minutes of an actual earthquake.. === Other magnitude scales === Many earthquake magnitude scales have been developed or proposed, with some never gaining broad acceptance and remaining only as obscure references in historical catalogs of earthquakes. Other scales have been used without a definite name, often referred to as \\"the method of Smith (1965)\\" (or similar language), with the authors often revising their method. On top of this, seismological networks vary on how they measure seismograms. Where the details of how a magnitude has been determined are unknown, catalogs will specify the scale as unknown (variously Unk, Ukn, or UK). In such cases, the magnitude is considered generic and approximate. An Mh (\\"magnitude determined by hand\\") label has been used where the magnitude is too small or the data too poor (typically from analog equipment) to determine a Local magnitude, or multiple shocks or cultural noise complicates the records. The Southern California Seismic Network uses this \\"magnitude\\" where the data fail the quality criteria.. A special case is the Seismicity of the Earth catalog of . Hailed as a milestone as a comprehensive global catalog of earthquakes with uniformly calculated magnitudes,NMSOP-2 . they never published the full details of how they determined those magnitudes.; . Consequently, while some catalogs identify these magnitudes as MGR, others use UK (meaning \\"computational method unknown\\").. Subsequent study found many of the values to be \\"considerably overestimated.\\". Further study has found that most of the magnitudes \\"are basically for large shocks shallower than 40 km, but are basically for large shocks at depths of 40–60 km.\\". Gutenberg and Richter also used an italic, non-bold \\"M without subscript\\"Defined as \\"a weighted mean between M and M.\\" . – also used as a generic magnitude, and not to be confused with the bold, non- italic M used for moment magnitude – and a \\"unified magnitude\\" m (bolding added).\\"At Pasadena, a weighted mean is taken between m as found directly from body waves, and m, the corresponding value derived from M ....\\" . While these terms (with various adjustments) were used in scientific articles into the 1970s,E.g., . they are now only of historical interest. An ordinary (non- italic, non-bold) capital \\"M\\" without subscript is often used to refer to magnitude generically, where an exact value or the specific scale used is not important. ==See also== * Magnitude of completeness ==NotesSources== *. *. *. *. *. *. *. *. *. *. *. *. *. *. *. *. *. *. *. *, NUREG/CR-1457. *.

It was at this siege that Bohemond met travelling warriors on the First Crusade and left to join them with an army. After his victory, Marinus strengthened the defences of the city and added 20,000 Saracen troops to the navy.

For part of its route, it runs together with U.S. Highway 53. The route passes through the cities of Hermantown and Duluth. Highway 194 is also known as Central Entrance and Mesaba Avenue within Duluth. ==Route description== State Highway 194 serves as an east-west arterial route between Solway Township, Hermantown, the Miller Hill area of Duluth, the Duluth Heights neighborhood, and downtown Duluth. The highway is a spur route into the city of Duluth. Highway 194 runs concurrent with U.S. Highway 53 for a stretch, from Lindahl Road in Hermantown to Trinity Road, near Duluth's Miller Hill Mall. This four-lane stretch of Highways 53 and 194 is also known as the Miller Trunk Highway in the cities of Duluth and Hermantown. The Mesaba Avenue portion of Highway 194 offers an excellent view of the city of Duluth and Lake Superior. ==History== Highway 194 was authorized in 1933 and originally numbered State Highway 69. In 1935, this route was renumbered State Highway 94 when U.S. Highway 69 was extended into Minnesota from Iowa near Albert Lea. The route was paved by 1940. The route was renumbered again, to 194, circa 1959 to avoid duplication with Interstate Highway 94 that was being built in Minnesota during the early 1960s. The section of present day State Highway 194 between U.S. 53 in Hermantown and downtown Duluth was authorized in 1933. The original alignment of this section was from U.S. 53 (Miller Trunk Highway) down Central Entrance to 6th Avenue East and then to Second and Third Streets in downtown Duluth (where it intersected then-Highway 61 as Second / Third Streets downtown). In 1991, the alignment of State Highway 194 on the Duluth hillside was changed from 6th Avenue East to Mesaba Avenue, southbound to Interstate 35. The section of Highway 61 that was signed on Second and Third Streets in downtown Duluth was eliminated at this time, due to the new I-35 extension around downtown Duluth completed in 1992. ==Major intersectionsReferences== 194 Category:Transportation in St. Louis County, Minnesota ","title":"Minnesota State Highway 194"},{"id":"6207250","text":"\\"Georgia Historical Commission\\" stamped on one of old Georgia historical markers. Seal of Georgia on.an old historical marker, showing that the Georgia Historical Commission was under the State of Georgia until 1973. The Georgia Historical Commission was an organization created by the U.S. state of Georgia for purposes of historic preservation. The Georgia legislature created it in February 1951 to promote and increase knowledge and understanding of the history of Georgia. Its work, including the erection of hundreds of historical markers, was accomplished during a relatively brief existence. These markers are still standing today. The impetus for the creation of the commission came from several sources as local historical societies were launching restoration projects of statewide importance. These projects often needed not only financial and technical help but a way to coordinate plans with other state projects. Three Atlanta civic leaders lobbied for a state historical commission: Henry A. Alexander, an attorney who was appointed chairman of the first board of commissioners; Joseph Jacobs, a pharmacist; and Frank Boland, a physician who wanted a memorial for Crawford W. Long, a Georgian who was the first person to use ether as an anesthetic. Secretary of State Ben Fortson thought the project should be placed within his department, which already handled Georgia archives. Governor Herman Talmadge, after years of stormy political battles, was eager to support an initiative with wide appeal. The commission began its life inauspiciously: because the act that created it forbade state funding, it had no budget. In 1952, however, this roadblock was lifted, and the Commission emerged as a significant state agency. C. E. Gregory, a retired political editor of the Atlanta Journal, had been influential in the campaign to establish the commission and became its first executive secretary. He was succeeded in 1960 by his daughter, Mary Gregory Jewett, who had been the commission's staff historian. Eventually the commission had a staff of 15 and a nine-member board, headed for 15 years by Joseph B. Cumming. Such specialists as the architectural historian William R. Mitchell Jr. and the archaeologist Lewis H. Larson Jr., who was involved in a New Echota project, advised the board over the years. The commission also gained national recognition as a pioneer in state historic preservation. The most impressive of its major achievements was the acquiring, restoring, excavating, and developing of 20 historic sites, 15 of them staffed and seven with museums, including New Echota and the Chief Vann House Historic Site. The commission's other major work was erecting some 1,800 historical markers. In 1962, the approaching American Civil War centennial inspired the commission to set 750 Civil War markers in place before the observance in 1965. After 1966 the commission served as the state's review board for the National Register of Historic Places. In 1973, Governor Jimmy Carter's governmental reorganization dissolved the 22-year-old commission. The successful agency's dissolution has caused controversy and bitterness, but much of commission's work has remained as the Department of Natural Resources took over the commission's functions and maintains most of the sites and museums, and the Georgia Historical Society took over the marker program. The responsibility of maintaining several sites now belongs to local groups. ==References== *Jann Haynes Gilmore, Georgia's Historic Preservation Beginning: The Georgia Historical Commission (1951-1973).

The Madaba Map is of the Middle East, and part of it contains the oldest surviving original cartographic depiction of the Holy Land and especially Jerusalem. It dates to the 6th century AD. ==History== Reproduction of the Madaba Map The Madaba Mosaic Map depicts Jerusalem with the New Church of the Theotokos, which was dedicated on 20 November 542. Buildings erected in Jerusalem after 570 are absent from the depiction, thus limiting the date range of its creation to the period between 542 and 570. The mosaic was made by unknown artists, probably for the Christian community of Madaba, which was the seat of a bishop at that time. In 614, Madaba was conquered by the Sasanian Empire. In the eighth century, the ruling Muslim Umayyad Caliphate had some figural motifs removed from the mosaic. In 746, Madaba was largely destroyed by an earthquake and subsequently abandoned. American Colony Photo Department\\" The mosaic was rediscovered in 1884, during the construction of a new Greek Orthodox church on the site of its ancient predecessor. Patriarch Nicodemus I of Jerusalem was informed, but no research was carried out until 1896.Donner, 1992, p.11 In the following decades, large portions of the mosaic map were damaged by fires, activities in the new church and by the effects of moisture. In December 1964, the Volkswagen Foundation gave the Deutscher Verein für die Erforschung Palästinas (\\"German Society for the exploration of Palestine\\") 90,000 DM to save the mosaic. In 1965, the archaeologists Heinz Cüppers and Herbert Donner undertook the restoration and conservation of the remaining parts of the mosaic. ==Description== Place of John the Baptist's baptism at the mouth of the Jordan and (near-obliterated) lion hunting a gazelle The floor mosaic is located in the apse of the church of Saint George at Madaba. It is not oriented northwards, like modern maps, but faces east towards the altar in such a fashion that the position of places on the map coincides with the actual compass directions. Originally, it measured 21 by 7 m and contained over two million tesserae.http://www.uni- bonn.de/Aktuelles/Publikationen/forsch/forsch_4_November_2005/bilder/Kultur.pdf Ute Friederich: Antike Kartographie Its current dimensions are 16 by 5 m. ===Topographic representation=== The mosaic map depicts an area from Lebanon in the north to the Nile Delta in the south, and from the Mediterranean Sea in the west to the Eastern Desert. Among other features, it depicts the Dead Sea with two fishing boats, a variety of bridges linking the banks of the Jordan, fish swimming in the river and receding from the Dead Sea; a lion (rendered nearly unrecognisable by the insertion of random tesserae during a period of iconoclasm) hunting a gazelle in the Moab desert, palm-ringed Jericho, Bethlehem and other biblical-Christian sites. The map may partially have served to facilitate pilgrims' orientation in the Holy Land. All landscape units are labelled with explanations in Greek. The mosaic's references to the tribes of Israel, toponymy, as well as its use of quotations of biblical passages, indicate that the artist who laid out the mosaic used as his primary source the Onomasticon of Eusebius (4th-century CE). A combination of folding perspective and aerial view depicts about 150 towns and villages, all of them labelled. The largest and most detailed element of the topographic depiction is Jerusalem (), at the centre of the map. The mosaic clearly shows a number of significant structures in the Old City of Jerusalem: the Damascus Gate, the Lions' Gate, the Golden Gate, the Zion Gate, the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, the New Church of the Theotokos, the Tower of David and the Cardo Maximus. On Jerusalem's southwest side is shown Acel Dama (lit. \\"field of blood\\"), from Christian liturgy. The recognisable depiction of the urban topography makes the mosaic a key source on Byzantine Jerusalem. Also unique are the detailed depictions of cities such as Neapolis, Askalon, Gaza, Pelusium and Charachmoba, all of them nearly detailed enough to be described as street maps. Other designated sites include: Nicopolis (); Beth Zachar[ias] (); Bethlehem (); Socho (), now Kh. Shuweikah (southwest of Hebron); Beth Annaba (); Saphitha (); Jericho (); Modi'im (); Lydda (); Bethoron (); Gibeon (); Rama (); Coreae ();Where is now the \\"Old Roman Bridge\\" (Arabic: Mukatta' Damieh), near the confluence of the watercourse Naḥal Yabok, not far from Wadi Fara'a, and which once marked the entry into Judea when one passes over the midland countries. Maresha ();. This particular entry has inscribed in Greek uncials: \\"Morasthi, whence was Micah the prophet.\\" The text is said to have been borrowed from Eusebius' Onomasticon. Azotos Paralos (Ashdod-Coast) (); The Great Plain (), literally meaning, \\"The Tribe of Dan\\";Beside which is inscribed a verse taken from Judges 5:17, \\"Why did Dan remain in ships?\\" Jamnia () (Lit. \\"Jabneel, which is also Jamnia\\"), among other sites. ==Scientific significance== The mosaic map of Madaba is the oldest known geographic floor mosaic in art history. It is used heavily for the localisation and verification of biblical sites. Study of the map played a major role in answering the question of the topographical location of Askalon (Asqalan on the map).Jana Vogt: Architekturmosaiken am Beispiel der drei jordanischen Städte Madaba, Umm al-Rasas und Gerasa.

According to the map, the main entrance to the city was through a large gate opening into a wide central street. Until the discovery, archaeologists were not able to excavate this site due to heavy pedestrian traffic. In the wake of infrastructure work near the Jaffa Gate, large paving stones were discovered at a depth of four meters below ground that prove such a road existed.Dig uncovers ancient Jerusalem street depicted on Byzantine map ==Copies of the Madaba Map== A copy of the map is in the collection of the Archaeological Institute at Göttingen University. It was produced during the conservation work at Madaba in 1965 by archaeologists of the Rheinisches Landesmuseum, Trier. A copy produced by students of the Madaba Mosaic School is in the foyer of the Akademisches Kunstmuseum at Bonn.

The game features strategy-based combat in addition to traditional role- playing game elements in two-dimensional environments. It is the first game in the Albert Odyssey series, and was followed by two sequels, Albert Odyssey 2: Jashin no Taidou in 1994, and Albert Odyssey: Legend of Eldean in 1996. On June 12, 1996, Albert Odyssey was made available as a full game download on the Satellaview add-on as , and the original Albert Odyssey was re-released for Satellaview in March 1998. Players assume the role of Albert, the young heroic swordsman who lives in a fantasy world filled with monsters and mythical creatures. While much of the world remains in relative peace following a great war many years before, a military faction led by the dark magician Globus has emerged to conquer the newly pacified nations and expand their empire. With the help of Albert's friends as well as hired mercenaries, the player must travel the world and eventually confront Golbus and his forces to prevent another large-scale conflict. ==Gameplay== A typical battlefield scene Albert Odyssey is a role-playing video game with strategy elements where players must travel through a fantasy environment battling monsters and other enemies to advance the story. The game uses two-dimensional character sprites and environments accompanied by the Super Nintendo Entertainment System's Mode 7 graphics capabilities that give the impression of three dimensions. Players move their characters from a top-down perspective through towns and other peaceful areas, while the game's overworld and dungeons are rendered as large battlefields laden with enemies. Throughout the game, players take part in the story by interacting with non-player characters and performing story-driven quests that continually expand the game's narrative. Using a turn-based system, both the player and computer opponent take turns moving and attacking across the field. A player may choose to move, attack, perform magic, use an item in their possession to aid themselves, or retreat to the nearest safe area to rest or restock supplies. Once two characters come in contact with one another, a battle sequence ensues where the attacking character deals damage to the opponent, lowering their health. When the player or enemy's health reaches zero, they are defeated and ejected from the field. Player's advance by confronting and defeating enemies, gaining experience points in the process that go towards making characters stronger and learn new abilities. A character can be further augmented with progressively more powerful weapons and equipment can be purchased in towns or found on defeated enemies. Progress is recorded by using save points found in set areas throughout the game that utilize the Famicom's battery backup-up system. If all of a player's characters are defeated at any time, they are forced to restart the game from the last recorded save file. ==Audio== The music for Albert Odyssey was written and programmed by Sunsoft in-house composer Naoki Kodaka, with the game being his first Super Famicom and role-playing endeavor. On June 25, 1993, Sunsoft released an official soundtrack titled All Sounds of Albert Odyssey in Japan published by Datam Polystar featuring all background music and jingles from the game. Later that year, selected music from Albert Odyssey was performed by the Tokyo City Philharmonic Orchestra as part of the third Game Music Concert series in Tokyo, Japan, later made available as a commercial album the following December. The two tracks represented were \\"The Road Walked by Heroes\\" and \\"Hometown Tibelis\\", retitled as \\"Albert Odyssey Theme\\" and \\"God's People\\" respectively. ==Sequel== is a tactical role-playing video game developed and published by Sunsoft for the Super Famicom and released in December 1994. It is the sequel to the original Albert Odyssey and retains many of the same gameplay and story elements while featuring enhanced graphics and battle features. The game is set ten years after the previous title and follows the story of Dean, a young warrior who is enthralled by the exploits of the hero Albert who saved the world a decade earlier from an evil magician. Setting off on his own journey to investigate the conflict, Dean becomes entangled in an adventure of his own while meeting characters from the previous game. He soon learns that the world is once again in danger from an ancient evil god known as Okutoba, and must become a hero himself to stop him from throwing the world into darkness. ===Gameplay=== Like its predecessor, Albert Odyssey 2 is a traditional strategy-based role-playing video game featuring two-dimensional character and background graphics. While towns and other safe areas are presented in a top-down fashion where players can move about freely, the game's overworld and dungeons take the appearance of a grid- like strategy board filled with monsters and other enemies. Using the Super Famicom's Mode 7 graphics function, environments can scroll and zoom smoothly based on the player's point of view, and give the appearance of three- dimensions. Players advance the game's story by taking part in large-scale battles and interacting with non-player characters. The battle system in Albert Odyssey 2 has been modified slightly from the original. While players can still move in eight directions to engage opponents, the size of many battlefields, as well as the number of enemies represented, has been reduced, with the entire system becoming more streamlined. Characters move about the battle environment using a turn-based system where enemies and the player's party take turns attacking in phases, with one entire side acting before another. On a player's turn, characters may move, fight, use a magic attack, use an item from their inventory, or retreat to a nearby safe location. Battle are won when an entire enemy party has been defeated, yielding experience points that allow characters to gain levels and become stronger as well as give access to new abilities. Players record their progress using the game cartridge's built-in battery back-up system by accessing preset save points during gameplay. ==References * Official website at Sunsoft (archived) * Category:1993 video games Category:1994 video games Category:Satellaview games Category:Sunsoft games Category:Super Nintendo Entertainment System games Category:Tactical role-playing video games Category:Video games scored by Naoki Kodaka Category:Virtual Console games Category:Virtual Console games for Wii U Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Video games with 2.5D graphics ","title":"Albert Odyssey (1993 video game)"},{"id":"6207316","text":"Randy Duane Knorr (born November 12, 1968) is an American professional baseball player, coach, and manager.

Rudolf Leiding (4 September 1914 – 3 September 2003) was the third post-war chairman of the Volkswagen automobile company (Volkswagenwerk AG), succeeding Kurt Lotz in 1971. Leiding began his career with Volkswagen at Wolfsburg in 1945 where he was responsible for the repair of army vehicles. Professor Nordhoff then charged him with setting up the first postwar Wolfsburg assembly line, using such parts as he could find. Leiding's ingenuity at this task led to promotion, and Leiding found himself sent to the United States to organize the first VW service network there. Between 1958 and 1965 he was the first director of the VW works in Kassel. Subsequently, he transferred to Auto Union GmbH in Ingolstadt where he became chairman of the board, presiding during the company's development of the successful Audi 100. Leiding arrived at the top Volkswagen job with a reputation as a successful trouble-shooter. When Volkswagen under Nordoff acquired Auto Union/Audi, Leiding was sent to \\"sort out\\" morale and discipline, as general manager at the Ingolstadt plant. During his first week he took to standing at the plant entrance each day at 7 am in order to check on late arrivals for the morning shift, a technique he subsequently employed at other plants. Finding a compound filled with 28,000 unsold, unused and increasingly obsolete cars, he sent office staff onto the street to \\"get rid of them at any cost\\". Many friends and relations of Ingolstadt-based Audi employees acquired bargain unused cars as a result of the exercise. Demand for the Ingolstadt plant's output did not justify a night shift at this time, and Leiding took to walking through the plant at night in the company of a photographer. The next day departmental heads responsible for areas where examples of inefficiency or waste had been identified would receive photographs of the deficient work stations, with no comment beyond the signature of the general manager. It was reported that during his first year at Ingolstadt Leiding reduced production costs by 34%. During his time in charge of Volkswagen's Sao Paulo based operations Leiding oversaw the development of the Volkswagen SP2. In July 1968, Leiding left Ingolstadt to take on the chairmanship of Volkswagen of Brazil. His time in Sao Paulo saw the development of the Volkswagen SP2 to be launched in 1972, one year after he went back to Germany to assume his position as VW CEO. Over the space of three years from 1968 to 1971 he also achieved, a 50% increase in Volkswagen's Brazilian production. Beetle, and pictured here. Despite the lukewarm reception of Volkswagen retailers and service outlets to the recently introduced front-engined water-cooled Volkswagen K70, Leiding instead bet the company's future on the Fiat-inspired FWD configuration, using the Audi 80 project as a template for the successful Polo/Golf/Passat ranges. Less than three weeks after taking over from Lotz at Wolfsburg, Leiding halted work on EA266 (Development Project 266). This was the development of a sophisticated - from a production engineer's standpoint over-sophisticated - mid-engined successor to the Beetle being developed by a Porsche team under a well regarded young engineer named Piëch on Volkswagen's behalf. The move was hugely contentious at the time partly because the Beetle replacement project was well advanced: 16 Million Marks had already been invested in EA266. It was culturally contentious because it hinted at a rejection of the company's historical roots. Given the market's lukewarm reception to newer rear-engined air-cooled models such as the Volkswagen 411, Leiding's decision to use Audi products then in the pipe-line as a short-cut for Volkswagen to follow Europe's pace-setter manufacturers such as, above all, Fiat down the water-cooled front-engined front-wheel drive route makes perfect sense in the light of subsequent events. But contemporaries lacked the foresight necessary for that judgement. The extent of Volkswagen's problems was highlighted during the first four months of 1972 when the company's domestic sales of 151,086 were comfortably beaten by Opel, who sold 161,127 cars in West Germany in those months. In May of the same year Leiding was ready to go public with his rescue strategy, by now already moving towards implementation. He pointed out that the Volkswagen group was producing eight disparate “volume” models, including five that had been launched within the last five years as part of an urgent if unfocused attempt to reduce Volkswagen's dependence on the aging Beetle. In terms of components and production technology the group's newer models had virtually nothing in common with one another. The 1500/1600 introduced back in 1961 sold in respectable numbers, but volumes had never approached the levels necessary for a Beetle successor. Of the five more recent launches, four, the NSU Ro 80, the VW- Porsche 914, the 411/412 and the K70 were selling at levels that came nowhere close to justifying the levels of spending that had backed their development and launch, the 411 and K70 both having been intended as Opel Rekord rivals that could sell at the levels needed to provide an acceptable return on the necessary investment in production capacity and infrastructure at the company's new Salzgitter plant. Leiding described the key to his solution as the “Baukastensystem” (roughly translated as “modular assembly”) whereby an entire palette of cars could be designed, ranging from a rival for the super- mini class defining Fiat 127 right up to a full-size family car, all of them sharing the same essential design architecture and most of their components. This would minimise the necessary investment in tooling and training while maximising the flexibility with which production could be switched between models in response to unexpected marketplace changes. Leiding came to the challenge of turning round Volkswagen with experience and a good engineer's instinct for production engineering: what he now set out was no more than an extension of the strategy already implemented when in 1965 he had been sent by Heinrich Nordhoff, then the Volkswagen chief, to “sort out” the group's new acquisition at Ingolstadt. Essential to the plan was close integration of product and production planning. Volkswagen's development chief, Werner Holste, having recently left the company, Leiding announced that as chairman he would now himself take direct responsibility for development of the company's new product range, supported by a new position for the Production Director at Audi, Ludwig Kraus, the man who recently had secretly, and in direct contravention of instructions from Volkswagen's first autocratic chairman, developed to production readiness the Audi 100, a car which stood apart from the group's other new models of recent years because it was a success from both the engineering and the marketing perspectives. In 1973 the European auto-industry stood on the brink of an economic crisis that would prove more challenging than anything experienced for more than two decades. Ludwig Kraus himself was already 62 years old and now faded from prominence, but Leiding's plan for Volkswagen nevertheless unfolded very much as he had laid out to the press in the early summer of 1973. Even two years later, with the Beetle continuing to lose favour in the market place, Leiding enjoyed the doubtful privilege of presiding over Volkswagen's record 1974 loss of DM 800 Million. Nevertheless, 1974 was a critical year for another reason: it was the year in which Golfs started emerging for the Wolfsburg plant, and Leiding's successor reaped the reward of a DM 1,000 Million profit two years later in 1976. Under Leiding's leadership, the Volkswagen Golf was completed, and went on sale in Europe in June 1974, introduced in North America as the Rabbit seven months later. The Golf was credited with saving VW from possible bankruptcy after the company had relied on the Beetle too long. Rudolf Leiding left the company early in 1975 and was replaced by Toni Schmücker. He died on 3 September 2003, one day before his 89th birthday. ==Sources and further reading== Category:German automobile designers Category:People in the automobile industry Category:Volkswagen Group executives Category:Auto Union Category:1914 births Category:2003 deaths ","title":"Rudolf Leiding"},{"id":"6207376","text":"Big Bang (; stylized as BIGBANG) is a South Korean boy band formed by YG Entertainment. The group consists of four members: G-Dragon, T.O.P, Taeyang, and Daesung; former member Seungri retired from the entertainment industry on March 11, 2019. Dubbed the \\"Kings of K-pop\\", they helped spread the Korean Wave internationally and are one of the most influential acts in K-pop history. They are known for their trendsetting musical experimentation, self- production, and stage presence. Although their debut album, Bigbang Vol.1 (2006), was released to lukewarm reception, greater success followed with a string of hit singles: \\"Lies\\" (Korean: ), which topped Korean music charts for a record-breaking six consecutive weeks and won Song of the Year at the 2007 Mnet Km Music Festival and the 2008 Seoul Music Awards; \\"Last Farewell\\" (Korean: ); \\"Day by Day\\" (Korean: ); and \\"Sunset Glow\\" (Korean: ). After winning Artist of the Year at the 2008 Mnet Korean Music Festival and the 2008 Seoul Music Awards, the group released four Japanese studio albums—Big Bang (2009), Big Bang 2 (2011), Alive (2012), and Made Series (2016)—all of which were certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ). After a two-year hiatus in South Korea, the quintet returned with innovative and critically acclaimed records. Their fourth EP, Tonight (2011), won them the inaugural Best Worldwide Act Award at the 2011 MTV Europe Music Awards. Their fifth EP, Alive (2012), became the first Korean album to chart on the US Billboard 200. Their third studio album, Made (2016), was preceded by several chart-topping singles and won the group Artist of the Year awards at the 2015 Mnet Asian Music Awards for the third time and at the 2015 Melon Music Awards. Its supporting tour, the Made World Tour, attracted 1.5 million people and set a new record for the most-attended concert tour headlined by a Korean act in history at the time. Eighteen of Big Bang's singles have reached number one in South Korea and have collectively remained atop the Melon charts for a record 51 weeks. The group has reportedly sold over 150 million records globally, which would rank them among the best-selling boy bands in the world. Forbes Korea ranked them as one of the most powerful celebrities in South Korea in 2010, 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2016; and they were the first Korean artists to be included on the Forbes Celebrity 100 (2016) and 30 Under 30 list of most influential musicians in the world (2017). == History  2000–2006: Formation and debut === Prior to the group's debut, a few of the members were already exposed to the entertainment industry. G-Dragon and Taeyang were the first ones to receive training under YG Entertainment at the age of eleven. After G-Dragon was approached by YG Entertainment for possible candidates to start a boy group, G-Dragon contacted T.O.P, his childhood friend, leading to the latter to audition. At the time, T.O.P was an underground rapper under the stage name \\"Tempo\\". One of his most popular tracks was \\"Buckwild\\" with NBK Gray. Seungri first appeared on the reality television series Let's Cokeplay: Mnet Battle Shinhwa, a show in which idol group Shinhwa search for members to make up the \\"second-generation Shinhwa\\". The original lineup consisted of six members: the aforementioned ones along with Daesung and Hyun-seung, who were both auditioned in. Their formation was documented on television; prior to their official debut, Hyun-seung was dropped. The Internet broadcast of the documentary exceeded one million views. Big Bang held their official debut on August 19, 2006, at Olympic Gymnastics Arena in Seoul during the YG Family 10th Anniversary Concert, which was broadcast the following month. Their first single \\"Bigbang\\", released shortly thereafter, contained the songs \\"We Belong Together\\", featuring label mate Park Bom; \\"A Fool's Only Tears\\" (Korean: ; Revised Romanization: Nunmulppunin Babo); and \\"This Love\\", an adaptation of the American rock band Maroon 5 song, rewritten and performed by G-Dragon. The single went on to sell nearly 40,000 copies. The second single, \\"BigBang Is V.I.P\\", was released in September, eventually topping 32,000 copies sold. Their last single, \\"Bigbang 03\\", followed, with final sales nearing 40,000 copies. The quintet received the award of New Artist of the Month for October in the 2006 Cyworld Digital Music Awards. In December, the group held their first concert, The Real, at Olympic Gymnastics Arena for 12,000 fans. The release of their debut album, BigBang Vol. 1 – Since 2007 (2006) followed. Debuting at no. 3, the album went on to sell over 110,000 copies. === 2007–2008: Mainstream popularity and Japanese debut === Big Bang at MTV Fast Forward, Thailand, December 2007 On February 8, 2007, Big Bang released their live concert album, The First / Real Live Concert, which sold 30,000 copies by the end of the year. They also began the Want You Tour in support of Since 2007, visiting five cities: Incheon, Daegu, Changwon, Jeonju and Busan. Their first extended play, Always (2007), marked several changes for the group. Though members had previously involved themselves with writing and composing, the group took more creative control over their music, moving away from their hip-hop roots. G-Dragon composed and wrote most of the tracks, including the lead single \\"Lies\\". The EP also saw the introduction of electronic music for Big Bang. Receptions were fairly positive, most notably in regards to \\"Lies\\", which critics described as \\"through the roof\\". Released as the lead single, it became their first number one hit and the album sold over 120,000 copies. Topping music charts for six weeks, \\"Lies\\" went to become the first song to win the Song of the Month award from the Cyworld Digital Music Awards for two consecutive months, as well as gathering the highest monthly sales in Cyworld's history, with over 200,000 copies sold in September. Their second EP, Hot Issue, released in November of the same year, contained six tracks all written by G-Dragon, who was also the album's producer. Hot Issue followed its predecessor's success: the lead-single, \\"Last Farewell\\", topped various charts, including the Melon chart for eight consecutive weeks, becoming the longest-running number one hit by a boy group. It also garnered the Song of the Month (Digital Music) Award from Cyworld. \\"Fool\\" and \\"But I Love U\\", other tracks from the EP, also ranked within the top 10. The digital success lead Hot Issue's sales to be moved over 120,000 copies total in South Korea. They also staged their Big Bang is Great concert, with tickets selling out in 10 minutes. Due to over-performing and exhaustion, several members were hospitalized, halting promotional activities. Despite this, their albums and singles were in high demand, causing the record company to reprint and repackage them for re-release. Riding on the success of their EPs, the group collected numerous awards, including Best Male Group and Song of The Year for \\"Lies\\" in the 2007 Mnet Asian Music Awards. They later received the Artist of the Year and Digital Record of Year awards from the 17th Seoul Music Awards. The group earned a total of ₩12 billion ($11.5 million) by year's end. As 2007 came to a close, Big Bang ventured overseas to Japan. Their first Japanese EP, For the World (2008), charted at number 10 on the Oricon chart with minimal promotion. The group also held a concert at the JCB Hall in Tokyo Dome City. Big Bang returned to South Korea after their promotions in Japan ended. Although group activities were delayed due to solo projects, their third Korean EP, Stand Up, was released. Featuring artists such as Daishi Dance and the Korean rock-band No Brain, Stand Up exceeded the 200,000 mark in sales. \\"Day by Day\\", the lead single, topped several online charts and held the number one position for seven consecutive weeks. It also became one of the most successful singles of all-time in South Korea, selling over five million digital downloads in South Korea alone. The EP also included the top-five song \\"Heaven\\", (Korean: ; Revised Romanization: Cheonguk) the top-ten \\"Oh My Friend\\", and the top-twenty \\"A Good Man\\" (Korean: 착한 사람; Revised Romanization: Chaghan Salam) and \\"Lady\\". During the release of their Korean materials, Big Bang released the Japanese song, \\"Number 1\\", from their first Japanese studio album of the same name, performing the song on Japanese radio programs and TV shows; the album peaked at number three on the Japan's Oricon daily album chart. Their second Korean studio album, Remember (2008), yielded the number one single, \\"Sunset Glow\\", a remake of the song of the same name by Lee Moon- se, released in 1988. \\"Strong Baby\\", performed solely by Seungri, was released as the second single. The album went on to sell over 200,000 copies. Big Bang received their second Artist of the Year Award from the 2008 Mnet Asian Music Awards. At the end of 2008, it was reported that Big Bang earned a total of ₩36 billion ($34.5 million). === 2009–2011: Solo endeavors, Japanese activities, and commercial success === While the group was on a break in early 2009, members pursued solo activities. They reunited to collaborate with 2NE1, their label's new girl group who had been dubbed as \\"The Female Big Bang\\" at the time, for \\"Lollipop\\", a song used to promote a cell phone by LG Cyon. A music video was also filmed for promotion. Big Bang also released their third endorsement digital single \\"So Fresh, So Cool\\" to promote the beer brand \\"Hite\\", although Seungri was not in the commercial due to the fact he was not of drinking age. Their second self-titled Japanese studio album was released under Universal Music in August 2009 and was promoted with two singles: \\"My Heaven\\" and \\"\\". \\"My Heaven\\", a Japanese re-recording of their Korean single \\"Heaven\\" from Stand Up, debuted at number three on the Oricon Music Chart. \\"Gara Gara Go!\\" charted at the fifth spot and the album itself peaked at number three. Kicking off the new year with the 2010 Big Show concert at Olympics Gymnastics Arena, Big Bang flew to Japan to embark on their Electric Love Tour. Their third Japanese studio album, Big Bang 2 (2011) was preceded with three singles: , \\"Tell Me Goodbye\\", and \\"Beautiful Hangover\\". \\"Koe wo Kikasete\\" was used in the Japanese drama , and peaked at number four on the Oricon Chart. \\"Tell Me Goodbye\\" was included in the Japanese re-release of Korean drama Iris. The song proved to be popular and gained favorable reviews, winning Song of the Year at the 52nd Japan Record Awards. Two promotional singles were also released in their home country: the number one song \\"Lollipop Part 2\\" to once again promote LG Cyon's Lollipop phone, and \\"Shout of the Reds\\" featuring the Korean rock band Transfixion and figure skater Kim Yuna in support of the 2010 World Cup. For most of the year, members individually promoted their own work, including the introduction of the sub- unit GD & TOP with their collaboration album. Big Bang also won several notable awards, including the Best 5 New Artists award from the 24th Japan Gold Disc Awards as well as the Best New Artist award. Near the end of May, the group received the awards for Best Pop Video and Best New Artist from the MTV Video Music Awards Japan 2010. After nearly two-year hiatus as a full group, Big Bang returned to South Korea with their 2011 Big Show concert, showcasing songs from the upcoming EP Tonight. The album had a pre-sale order of 10,000 copies in Cyworld, beating the record set by TVXQ's 6,500 copies back in 2008, and moved 100,000 units in a week. Reception for the album was positive, with Choi Jun of Asiae complimenting the group's new direction in their music, acknowledging that during the two years hiatus, the group's \\"style and musical sensibility [had] deepened\\". Seven days after the album's release, it was reported that Big Bang had already earned ₩7 billion (US$6.6 million). Its lead-single of the same name became a chart-topper on the Gaon Digital Chart, while four other album tracks peaked within the top 10, including the number-two \\"Café\\" and the number four \\"What is Right?\\".

Their third Japanese tour, Love and Hope, kicked off in May in support of the album. All performances were sold out, and a total of 100,000 fans attended the tour. At the 2011 MTV EMAs, Big Bang won the Best Worldwide Act award as representatives of the Asia-Pacific region with over 58 million votes. \\"Love Song\\" also won Best Music Video at the 2011 Mnet Asian Music Awards. At the end of the year, Big Bang participated in the YG Family 15th Anniversary concert tour. This was followed by a release of their third Greatest Hits album The Best of Big Bang (2011) on December 14, which contained a Japanese version of \\"Day by Day\\". The album topped the Oricon Daily chart on its first day of release and went on to sell over 14,000 copies in the first week. It was reported that Big Bang earned ₩78 billion (US$69.4 million) in 2011 even though they had just promoted for half a year. The earnings included Big Bang's revenue concert for SBS's Big Bang Show, their 2011 Big Show Concert and their Love and Hope Tour in Japan. === 2012–2014: International breakthrough, first world tour, and hiatus === Big Bang performing in 2012 In January 2012, YG Entertainment began releasing teasers for Big Bang's fifth Korean EP Alive, which was released in both digital and physical formats in February. Preorders for Alive amounted to 260,000 copies in two weeks. Three singles were released to promote the album: \\"Blue\\", the lead single, was released a week prior to the album and reached the number one position on all major domestic charts; the second single \\"Bad Boy\\" peaked at number two and was the only K-Pop song to be included in Fuse's best songs of 2012 list; while the last, \\"Fantastic Baby\\", rounded at number three. The music video for the latter is currently the band's most popular, having received more than 310 million views on YouTube, the most watched video by a Korean group as of 2017.Fantastic Baby Video Internationally, Big Bang obtained five spots out of the top-ten on Billboard K-pop's Hot 100 and charted at no. 150 on Billboard 200, making them the first Korean artist with a Korean album to do so. Their popularity also boosted them onto the Billboard Social 50, entering at number twenty-four. They later received recognition from notable sites such as Time magazine, and a photo of the group was featured on the Grammy Awards homepage. The album release coincided with their annual concert, Big Show 2012, held at Seoul Olympic Park Stadium from March 2–4 to a sold-out crowd of 40,000 fans. This marked the official kick off of their first world tour, the Alive Galaxy Tour, in partnership with Live Nation. It was directed by renowned choreographer Laurieann Gibson, with Big Bang performing at 21 cities in over 13 countries, with a total attendance of 800,000 people. Concert footage from Big Show was broadcast in 160 countries through MTV World Stage, which pushed the promotion for their world tour. The Alive Galaxy Tour marked the group's first ever concerts in the United States, Hong Kong and Europe. Due to high demand, additional concerts were held in Los Angeles, New Jersey and London. The quintet also performed at three Japanese dome venues for the first time, becoming the first Korean artist to perform at all three of these venues during its tour. The group concluded the tour with concerts in Osaka in mid-January along with a three night stint at the Olympic Gymnastics Arena in Seoul later that month. The Japanese version of Alive was released on March 28 both digitally and physically, with two additional Japanese tracks. Included with the physical copy of their album was a bonus Japanese version of their hit song \\"Day by Day\\". It sold over 23,000 copies on its first day of release and peaked at number two on the Oricon charts, eventually selling over 200,000 copies total and certified gold by the RIAJ. Japanese promotions began with a performance at 2012's Springroove Festival alongside top American and Japanese hip hop artists. Big Bang was the first Korean act to be invited along with label-mates 2NE1. Following the success of their comeback, Big Bang released a special edition album titled Still Alive on June 3. It featured four new tracks including two new Korean tracks of which their lead single was titled \\"Monster\\", as well as Korean remakes of the two additional tracks in the Japanese version of Alive. The album sold over 100,000 copies in its first month of release. A special Monster edition of their Japanese Alive album was also released on June 20, following its Korean counterpart. The success of their special edition album further boosted the group's global recognition, peaking at no. 11 on the Billboard Social 50. On November 30, 2012, Big Bang received a total of three awards at the 14th Mnet Asian Music Awards, including Best Male Group and Artist of the Year. G-Dragon also took home Best Male Solo award at the event. They also received the Best Fan category award at the Italian TRL Awards. After promotional activities wrapped up, the members pursued individual activities for the majority of 2013 and 2014. Big Bang reunited in November 2013 for their Japan Dome Tour, holding concerts in six different dome arenas in Japan, being the first foreign act to do so. Gathering over 770,000 fans, the tour's total revenue, including tickets sold and merchandising sales, totalled $94 million. In October 2014, the group performed at the closing ceremony of the 2014 Asian Games held in Incheon, South Korea, wrapping up the Congratulatory Performance. A month later, the quintet embarked on their second Japanese dome tour, which was the first time that any overseas artist performed in five dome arenas of Japan for two consecutive years. By the end of 2014, Big Bang was the Korean artist that attracted the most concertgoers in Japan for the year and the second act overall. === 2015–2016: Critical acclaim, second world tour and tenth anniversary === Big Bang performing in Dalian, China during their Made World Tour in 2015 Big Bang was on hiatus for two years while G-Dragon experienced a \\"career slump\\" and was unable to find inspiration to write new music for the band, explaining that \\"In the past, even after coming back from a long, tiring day, I would write at least two songs at the dorm before I slept as if it were my duty. [In 2014], however, things just weren't working out for me so the album kept getting delayed.\\" In 2015, Big Bang made their comeback by releasing special project singles for their album Made: M, A, D, and E. The first single, M, released in May, included the two songs \\"Loser\\" and \\"Bae Bae\\", which debuted at number one and number two, respectively, on Billboard's World Digital Songs, making the quintet the first K-pop boy band to top the chart and the second Korean artist to occupy the top two slots simultaneously after labelmate Psy. \\"Loser\\" won Song of the Year at the 30th Golden Disk Awards, while \\"Bae Bae\\" won Song of the Year at the 13th Korean Music Awards. Both tracks were named by Billboard as one of the best K-pop songs of 2015, with \\"Loser\\" topping the list. The following month saw the release of A, which included \\"Bang Bang Bang\\" (Korean:뱅뱅뱅) and \\"We Like 2 Party\\", that also went on to occupy the number one and two positions on Billboard's World Digital Chart. \\"Bang Bang Bang\\" won Song of the Year at the 17th Mnet Asian Music Awards, and was the best-performing single of 2015 in South Korea according to the Gaon Digital Chart. D was released in July and included \\"Sober\\" (Korean: 맨정신; Revised Romanization: Maenjeongsin) and \\"If You\\". \\"If You\\" landed on Billboard's World Digital Chart at number two and topped the Gaon Digital Chart, while \\"Sober\\" charted at number two in their home country. The consecutive monthly releases concluded with E in August, with the songs \\"Zutter\\" (Korean: 쩔어; Revised Romanization: jjeoreo), featuring the sub-unit of GD & TOP, and \\"Let's Not Fall in Love\\" (Korean: 우리 사랑하지 말아요; Revised Romanization: Uri Saranghaji Marayo). The latter peaked at number one on the Gaon Digital Chart and on Billboards World Digital Songs chart. To promote their singles, Big Bang embarked on their second world tour which received critical acclaim and was commercially successful. Kicking off with two shows in Seoul on April 25 and 26, the tour gathered 1.5 million fans around the world, making it the largest tour by any Korean act. By the end of the year, Big Bang had earned over ₩150 billion (US$120 million). Despite the commercial success of the singles, the release of the full album was postponed to add new songs to the album and for the group to rest after four months of promotions. Big Bang continued touring into 2016 for their Made V.I.P Tour, visiting China, Macau, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan and the United States. The group was the highest earning artist of 2016 in Mainland China based on concert revenue, by earning US$70.3 million, accounting for 70% of the entire total box office of South Korean artists in China for the year. In April and May, they toured Japan for their Fantastic Babys Tour, meeting 280,000 fans. Several projects were launched to commemorate the group's 10th anniversary. The first was the documentary film Big Bang Made, which followed the group through their Made Tour in 2015, released on June 30, 2016. The band held a 10th anniversary concert tour, 0.TO.10, from July 2016 to January 2017, which included sold-out stadium shows at Yanmar Stadium Nagai in Osaka, Japan and at Seoul World Cup Stadium in Seoul, South Korea. The tour drew 781,500 attendees from 16 concerts in Japan, and made Big Bang the act with the biggest concert mobilization power for the year in Japan, the first time a foreign act has topped the list. Overall, they gathered a 1.1 million attendance for the tour. The band also held an art exhibition, titled A TO Z, to showcase the history of the group as well as to celebrate a decade with their fans. The exhibition ran from August 5 to October 30 at the S-Factory in Seoul. The exhibition travelled to Taipei, Taiwan from June 24 to August 22 in 2017. After a year of delay, Made was released in December 2016. Two singles were announced for the release: \\"Fxxk It\\" (Korean: 에라 모르겠다; Revised Romanization: Era Moreugedda), and \\"Last Dance\\". The two songs, along with \\"Girlfriend\\", took the three top places on the Gaon Digital Chart, selling over one million digital copies combined in five days. The same songs peaked at number 2, 3 and 4 on the Billboard World Digital Songs chart, selling 13,000 copies combined. The digital version of Made sold over 1 million digital copies on QQ Music, Kugou, and Kuwo, China's three major music platforms in a day. The album debuted at No. 172 on the United States Billboard 200 with 6,000 equivalent album units, 4,000 of which were in traditional album sales, earning the band their second entry on the chart. They also debuted at no. 1 on the World Albums chart and the Heatseekers Albums chart. In their home country, South Korea, the physical version of the album topped the Gaon Albums chart. Two final concerts were held at Gocheok Sky Dome in January 2017 to wrap up their 10th anniversary tour and Made's promotional activities. === 2017–2019: Touring, military service, and Seungri's retirement=== As per South Korea's mandatory military service requirement, T.O.P. enlisted for his two-year service on February 9, 2017, as a conscripted policeman. The remaining members continued promotions without him, holding their fifth annual Japanese dome tour, the Last Dance Tour, in November with 14 concerts in four cities with an attendance of 696,000 fans. The two final shows of the tour were also held at Gocheok Sky Dome in Seoul on December 30 and 31. In 2017, YG Entertainment released a reality program starring the group named Run, Big Bang Scout! through YouTube Red, which was the service's first original content to be produced in a country outside of the United States. The first episode of the program was free-released and has gathered over 12.7 million views on YouTube. The following year, the remaining members began their enlistment: G-Dragon on February 27, Taeyang on March 12, and Daesung on March 13, 2018. Seungri was initially announced to enlist on March 25, 2019. The single, \\"Flower Road\\", was released on March 13, 2018, as a goodbye to their fans. \\"Flower Road\\" set a record in China, reaching over a million sales in 3 days and 14 hours, the shortest amount of time for a Korean artist. The song also topped Billboard's World Digital Songs Chart, and the Gaon Digital Chart, where the song recorded the highest digital index of the year thus far. On March 11, 2019, Seungri announced his retirement from the entertainment industry due to scandals surrounding the Burning Sun nightclub, resulting in his departure from Big Bang. ===2019-present: Return=== On July 6, 2019, T.O.P was the first member to be discharged from the military. He was followed by G-Dragon on October 25, 2019. Taeyang and Daesung were discharged on November 10. On January 3, 2020, it was announced that Big Bang would be performing at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, which would have marked their first performance as a group in three years. In March, despite reports suggesting otherwise, all four members renewed their contracts with YG Entertainment and were preparing for a comeback that was eventually delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. == Artistry  Musicality === Big Bang have been praised for their individuality and ability to fuse a pop sound with rap, R&B; and dance elements. The quintet is known for experimentalism and for a \\"dominating style of music that surpasses genre boundaries\\". During the early days of their career, Big Bang's music was predominantly hip hop and pop rap, although they incorporated R&B; songs into their albums as well. A writer for Yahoo! Japan once compared their early materials to that of American hip-hop artists such as The Black Eyed Peas, stating that their songs included \\"catchy vocals, [...] rap and characters\\". The song \\"Ma Girl\\", Taeyang's first solo from the group's first album, was described as \\"[s]mooth, sexy and bass-heavy\\" and reminiscent of Omarion. Similarly, Seungri's first solo from the same album, \\"Next Day\\" (Korean: 다음날, Revised Romanization: Daeum Nal), was stated to have an \\"intense '90s Usher vibes\\". Their first EP Always (2007) was a musical departure from their previous efforts, with the group experimenting with electronic dance music and setting it as the new music trend in Korea. From their EP Hot Issue (2007), the \\"shibuya-kei-influenced\\" \\"Fool\\" (Korean: 바보; Revised Romanization: Babo) contained a \\"heavy dance beat paired with a smooth disco coating.\\" \\"Day by Day\\" from Stand Up (2008) was admired for \\"weaving in and out of tempos seamlessly and forcing a sense of anxiety on the listener through the beating undercurrent\\" and hailed as an \\"experiential masterpiece\\". They also collaborated with the Korean rock-band No Brain for the rock song \\"Oh My Friend\\". Alive (2012) was noted for showcasing the group's voice instead of their usual autotune, being described as having \\"a mature kind of intensity\\", with \\"Blue\\" being distinguished for including \\"more interesting electronic samples and production techniques\\" and \\"Bad Boy\\" described as having a \\"nostalgic\\" sentiment, being called a \\"perfect pop song\\" that \\"transcends language\\". In addition, their song \\"Monster\\" was praised for its use of mournful tone vocals in an orchestra sound. The group mixed a variety of electronic music with soft rock for their third album Made (2016). which was described as \\"career-exemplifying\\". \\"Loser\\" was cited for \\"introduc[ing] a more mature style\\" to the group \\"without losing the images they had enforced through previous releases\\", while \\"Bang Bang Bang\\" was noted for its modern EDM-inspired sound and \\"Bae Bae\\" for its \\"boundary-pushing elements\\" and becoming one of the first artist Korean artist to introduce Trap music to K-Pop. In \\"Let's Not Fall in Love\\", Big Bang was complimented for being at \\"their most tender\\", with the song being described as having a \\"lush production that evokes a range of emotions\\". \\"Girlfriend\\" was a \\"mellow hip- hop throwback to the group's early days\\". Members of the band have experimented with other genres for solo projects, thus the group has been described as \\"rich in variety\\" for their fans. Taeyang's EP Hot was mainly a collection of R&B; songs, with the singer stating that this genre was his \\"main focus\\". Daesung's first digital single, \\"Look at Me, GwiSoon\\" (Korean: , Revised Romanization: Nal Bwa Gwisoon), was a trot song, which drew criticism due to Big Bang's image as \\"hip-hop artists\\". For his debut album, Heartbreaker, G-Dragon incorporated a mix of dance, hip-hop, and R&B; songs. Justin McCurry from The Guardian said that \\"[e]ach of the five members has his own individual look, and their musical range is equally eclectic, covering R&B;, hip-hop, house, electro and pop.\\" Additionally, they have been described as \\"artistic superheroes\\" for showing \\"versatility and success in whatever they do\\" by rivaling companies. Their continued experimentation with a diverse range of musical styles and their distinct personalities have been highlighted as some of the main reasons for their popularity and longevity. The Chosun Ilbo explained their \\"strong lead among idol groups\\" as a result of the quality of their music, noting that \\"whenever Big Bang promotes new songs, they want to introduce something new and tell us new stories.\\" Internationally, Big Bang is often referred to as a \\"K-pop\\" group, a label which they do not appreciate, with G-Dragon commenting that, \\"We are Korean, so obviously they call our music K-pop. But we never thought of our music as K-pop. Our music is just our music.\\" In addition, T.O.P noted that \\"[y]ou don't divide pop music by who's doing it. We don't say, for instance, 'white pop' when white people make music.\\" === Songwriting and lyrical themes === The group is known for maintaining tight control over their career, heavily involving themselves since their debut in the production of their music and songwriting, as opposed to many Korean idol groups. G-Dragon is known as the member that is most heavily involved in the production of the group's materials, having a role in producing almost their entire discography spanning ten years, and credited as the main songwriter for the group's earlier hits such as \\"Lies\\", \\"Last Farewell\\", and \\"Day by Day\\". G-Dragon, T.O.P, and Taeyang also collaboratively wrote \\"Last Dance\\", with G-Dragon co-producing the song. Recurring themes in their lyrics deal with love and relationships. In \\"Bingle Bingle\\", a protagonist is pleading to his lover to take the next step in the relationship. In contrast, \\"Let's Not Fall in Love\\" halts a new relationship from growing, depicting the hesitation the risk of opening up to someone. Big Bang have also covered other topics in their songs. \\"Fantastic Baby\\" and \\"Bang Bang Bang\\" are often described as club music due to their lyrical contents, with the former described as having an \\"anarchistic\\" theme and the latter being labeled as the \\"party anthem of 2015\\". \\"Fxxk It\\"'s use of vulgarity was seen as evidence to their growing age. Their song \\"Loser\\" was an attempt to \\"humanize the group\\" by discussing their flaws. \\"Bae Bae\\" was noted for its metaphor about sex. \\"Sober\\" talks about chasing one's dream, while \\"Last Dance\\" is an ode to the band's time together. G-Dragon's contributions were praised by The Korea Times, who described him as a \\"genius singer- songwriter\\". The rapper himself describes Big Bang as \\"an idol group not born of talent but through effort.\\" A writer for Yahoo! Japan complimented the group for their involvement in their work, stating that \\"perhaps by contributing to their own materials, not only do they become in sync with one another, but each person's personality stands out.\\" === Stage and aesthetic === Big Bang performing at their Big Show concert in 2011 Big Bang has received praise for their stage presence and choreographies during live performances. Early in their career, the quintet was choreographed by Seungri and frequent collaborator Shaun Evaristo. While they once relied heavily on street dancing for their moves, they have made a transition towards other styles of choreography. One of the moves from their debut single \\"La La La\\", involving the group lifting their shirts to expose their abdomens, quickly gained popularity online and became one of the top searches on the internet. The choreography for \\"Last Farewell\\", in which the group incorporates the idea of \\"jump roping\\" as a dance move, also gained attention. The dance for \\"Bang Bang Bang\\", choreographed by Parris Goebel, was one of the most popular dances of 2015. Their stage fashion is also a highlight: Fuse TV noted that \\"their outfits are almost as entertaining as their performances.\\" The group first adopted the \\"hip-hop\\" concept for their debut. The release of Always in 2007 was accompanied by a change in image, with the group leaning towards a more preppy-punk style, including skinny jeans with Converse or high-top sneakers, which became a hit trend in South Korea. Taeyang also traded his cornrows for a faux hawk. Members of the group have also consistently altered their hairstyles and color throughout the years. Seen wearing brands such as Bape, 10 deep, Louis Vuitton, Jeremy Scott, and Phenomenon, Big Bang would also wear custom-printed hoodies for many of their performances and music videos. They were also credited for bringing back \\"old school\\" fashion into the mainstream, popularizing brands such as Nike and Reebok high-top shoes. Described as the \\"most fashionable\\" one in the group, G-Dragon was known to sport triangular scarves that were later nicknamed \\"Big Bang scarves\\" during their promotion of the single \\"Lies\\". T.O.P also gained a following for wearing sunglasses during performances. Their use of props during performances – including \\"an abundance of pyrotechnics, streamers[,] confetti\\", LED lights, fog, as well as digitalized \\"fire-breathing dragons and a rotor-spinning helicopter\\" – have been well received by critics. In a review of their world tour, The Muse admired the group for playing every song like it's the last, for their precision delivery and their individual strengths. At the peak of popularity for Psy's \\"Gangnam Style\\", The New York Times journalist Jon Caramanica noted how Big Bang's concert in New Jersey was the \\"true wild heart of K-pop\\" as opposed to Psy, highlighting their brightly colored costumes, choreography, and stage performance. In 2012, they ranked number one in the Philippines's Top 3 Mall of Asia Arena concerts, and their concert in Lima was named the best in South America for the year. When compared to Western artists such as Justin Bieber and One Direction, Big Bang's performance were noted for having their \\"edges [...] crisper, the sound louder, the dancing sharper\\". They were ranked second on the New York Times list of best concerts in 2012 for their Alive Tour at the Prudential Center in Newark, New Jersey. In March 2012, Krista Mahr, Time magazine's South Asia correspondent, wrote an article about her first K-Pop concert at the Olympic Gymnastics Arena in Seoul, describing the group as \\"K-pop gods\\" for their stage presence. Their Made World Tour in 2015 was a critical and commercial success, with the Los Angeles Times calling their Anaheim concert an \\"incredibly significant moment for K-Pop\\", praising the diversity of their songs and performances, noting how the concert \\"escalated the craft of live K-Pop — which sometimes doesn't live up to the overwhelming enthusiasm of its fans — into a sleeker and more adventurous kind of arena spectacular.\\" Including the group in their list of Best Concerts of the Year for the second time, The New York Times noted how the \\"electric, sleek and dizzyingly busy concert by one of South Korea's most vital K-pop acts made even its biggest American counterparts look like rank amateurs.\\" == Legacy == Big Bang is YG's most successful artist and was responsible for more than half of YG's albums sold in Korea from 2014 to 2017 before their hiatus due to military enlistment. They were the first Korean mainstream hip hop idols, being credited for the genre spreading throughout Asia as a representative of the Hallyu Wave. The Korea Times have called them \\"the icons of Korean pop [music]\\", and cited how G-Dragon's rise to one of the most accomplished songwriters in K-pop \\"has inspired many young idol-wannabes to become singer-songwriters.\\" Yonhap News Agency stated that the quintet has helped “spread K-pop as a cultural brand spanning the U.S., Europe, Latin America and the Middle East.\\" In 2011, BBC declared that \\"K-pop bands, including Big Bang, are making their mark around the world\\", citing the group's contribution to YG Entertainment's economic growth. After the group won the 2011 MTV Europe Music Award for Best Worldwide Act, Google announced that its subsidiary YouTube would launch its own K-pop channel in recognition of the popularity and success of K-pop. The British daily newspaper The Guardian also published an article discussing the importance of how the win had \\"shed light on the rise of Korean music across Europe\\". Jacques Peterson from The Sydney Morning Herald credited their success for giving a “idiosyncratic twist” on their genre that breaks the mould of the idol group formula. Suk Park, the president of DramaFever, has hailed them as the vanguard of K-pop. The Michigan Daily have described Big Bang as a rare group that \\"both innovates and defines the direction a genre takes\\", affirming that the group and its solo acts \\"have left a musical imprint that has affected the global music market.\\" Mark James Russell, an entertainment journalist based in Seoul, praised the group for defying categorization, stating how \\"[o]f all the mainstream acts, they’re doing the most to push boundaries of what is considered K-pop.\\" Anna Fifield from The Washington Post claimed that they \\"have defined and redefined South Korean pop music. They've defied the idea that so-called K-Pop is inevitably sugarcoated and factory-produced, and that boy bands are all about pretty faces and lip-synching.\\" Los Angeles Times praised their constant re-imagination of sound and image, calling Big Bang as \\"one of the most inventive, aesthetically visionary acts in its genre.\\" In an article published for the quintet's tenth anniversary, Billboard stated that \\"no act has enthralled the Korean music world in the past decade quite like Big Bang\\" later adding that they have \\"shaped the Korean music industry\\" and were enabled to \\"surpass international boundaries and shirk off the limitations of K-pop's youth-focused industry.\\" In recognition of their global popularity, Big Bang is a prominent face of South Korea when it comes to tourism. Their Big Show concerts were promoted by the South Korean Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism's Visit Korea Committee from 2010 to 2012, crediting the group's \\"big economic impact on the country.\\" In 2014, the national postal service of the country, Korea Post, honored them by releasing official postage stamps containning images of the group. In 2016, they were chosen as ambassadors for the country's \\"Creative Korea\\" tourism campaign. In 2016, Big Bang ranked second on Time magazine's polls for Most Influential People in the World, behind only American politician Bernie Sanders. The same year, Forbes listed the group at number 54 on their annual list of Celebrity 100, having earned $44 million from June 2015 to June 2016. Becoming the first Korean act to appear on the list, the group had the third highest annual earnings ever for a boy band, behind only One Direction and Backstreet Boys. Big Bang was named one of the most influential artists to impact the Hallyu Wave by The Korea Herald, being among the acts that best represent K-pop, and the \\"Top Male Idol Group in the Past 20 Years\\" in Dong-a Ilbo's survey of both the Korean public and music critics. Additionally, they were the highest ranking musicians in JoongAng Ilbo's \\"Most Powerful Figures In Korean Entertainment\\" list, placing at number four. In 2017, they became the first Korean artists to be included on Forbes 30 Under 30 list of musicians revolutionizing the modern music industry. Songs released by the group, such as \\"Lies\\" and \\"Fantastic Baby\\" are considered some of K-pop's biggests hits and most iconic songs ever. In their list of \\"The 21 Greatest K-Pop Songs of All Time\\", Spin magazine lists \\"Bad Boy\\" at number thirteen and the song \\"High High\\" by the duo GD & TOP at number seven. \\"Fantastic Baby\\" ranked at number twenty-two in Rolling Stone magazine's \\"50 Greatest Boy Band Songs of All Time\\" list.

Rapper BewhY, the winner of Show Me the Money 5, revealed he started rapping after listening to Big Bang, while IU started gaining popularity after covering songs by the quintet. Big Bang's influence extends beyond the music industry; they have shaped major trends in fashion. Dubbed \\"Big Bang fashion\\", their style has gained a following throughout Asia and made them a cultural phenomenon in South Korea. The clothes that members donned on stage were often copied and sold at Dongdaemun Market. In 2011, Big Bang collaborated with Japanese clothing retailer Uniqlo to create a line of T-shirts that quickly sold out. The Chicago Sun-Times called the members \\"five of the most daring, dapper dressers in the world\\" and praised their style as \\"bold, innovative and trend-setting\\". Their impact on the Korean fashion industry was highlighted in Vogue Korea's exhibition in Seoul. While the quintet have established themselves as fashion icons and have been named one of the most stylish boy bands by western media, they have also been criticized for appropriating hip- hop culture in their use of clothes, color coordination, and hairstyles. == Achievements == The quintet is known for their multiple hit songs, with the Gaon Chart reporting that music consumers have learned to trust the group's quality, calling them a \\"phenomenon\\" because their material is \\"consumed evenly by a variety of age groups.\\" This allowed them to win several Song of the Year awards from numerous award shows, including in the 13th Korean Music Awards, for \\"Bae Bae\\" and the 30th Golden Disc Awards for \\"Loser\\".

Latin show Mil Preguntas, Una Estrella con Candela Ferro (1,000 Questions, 1 Star). ==BiographyEarly life=== At an early age she realized she loved entertaining people, she would mimic Libertad Lamarque, a famous Argentine tango vocalist, and she would passionately recite poems by García Lorca, her favorite writer and one of the most influential Spanish writers of all time. She studied Communications at the University of Buenos Aires, thinking that she would be able to showcase her many talents through this career. At age 18, she began working in a local TV show called Domingo Total (Total Sunday), which was broadcast live every weekend. She also worked as an entertainment reporter for the show De Boca en Boca (From Mouth to Mouth) at ATC Television.

Le Bonheur has more than 700 medical staff representing 40 pediatric specialties. Approximately 170 patients per day are admitted, mostly from Tennessee and nearby states but also from around the world, mainly due to its nationally recognized brain tumor program, affiliation with St. Jude Children's Research Hospital and for being the home of the Children's Foundation Research Center. Le Bonheur functions as the region's primary level 1 pediatric trauma center. The hospital cares for 14,000 patients every year, including about 81,000 visits to the emergency department a year and 8,800 surgeries per year. Le Bonheur also serves as a teaching hospital affiliated with the University of Tennessee Health Science Center and offers training in general pediatrics and pediatric sub- specialties. The hospital has been recognized among the nation's \\"Best Children's Hospitals\\" by U.S. News and World Report. ==History== Le Bonheur was founded on June 15, 1952, by the Le Bonheur Club, originally a women's sewing circle, and was originally an orphanage dedicated to caring for poor children. The Le Bonheur Club members raised all of the money for the initial investment for the hospital. When the doors opened, the Le Bonheur Club President, Mrs. Howard Pritchard, stated: \\"The doors of Le Bonheur will never be found closed and will forever hereafter be open to those who come in need, seeking its help.\\" The medical center has gone through two major expansion projects. When Hurricane Katrina first hit New Orleans in August 2005, Le Bonheur (along with other hospitals) sent helicopters to Tulane Medical Center, Ochsner, and CHNOLA in order to help evacuate pediatric patients from the hospital. In February 2008, ground was broken on the new expansion by Le Bonheur executives. In December 2010, Le Bonheur Children's Hospital opened the emergency department in its newly renovated 12-story patient care tower. Le Bonheur maintains two ambulances equipped for critical care transport. == Methodist Le Bonheur Healthcare == In 1995, Le Bonheur became a part of the Methodist Healthcare System, which is supported by the Memphis, Mississippi and Arkansas conferences of The United Methodist Church. While it is primarily located in Memphis, the system also owns the Methodist Olive Branch hospital in Mississippi. The healthcare system began in 1918 with a farmer named John Sherard. === Collection practices === The system is known for suing patients who have difficulty paying, with 8,300 lawsuits between 2014 and 2018. ==Education== Le Bonheur is affiliated with the University of Tennessee Health Science Center and St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. It offers training in general pediatrics and several subspecialty areas of pediatrics.

Cigrand Bernard John Cigrand (October 1, 1866 – May 16, 1932), a dentist, has a strong claim to being considered the father of Flag Day in the United States.http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/wlhba/articleView.asp?pg=2&id;=1588 Born in Waubeka, Wisconsin, Cigrand practiced dentistry in Chicago, Batavia, and Aurora, and was the third dean of Columbian Dental College, now the University of Illinois at Chicago College of Dentistry, serving in that post from 1903 to 1906. Working as a grade school teacher in Waubeka, Wisconsin, in 1885, Cigrand held the first recognized formal observance of Flag Day at Stony Hill School in Waubeka. The school has been restored, and a bust of Cigrand also honors him at the National Flag Day Americanism Center in Waubeka. He moved to Chicago to attend dental school and, in June 1886, first publicly proposed an annual observance of the birth of the United States flag in an article titled \\"The Fourteenth of June,\\" published in the Chicago Argus newspaper. In June 1888, Cigrand advocated establishing the holiday in a speech before the \\"Sons of America,\\" a Chicago group. The organization founded a magazine, American Standard, in order to promote reverence for American emblems. Cigrand was appointed editor-in-chief and wrote articles in the magazine as well as in other magazines and newspapers to promote the holiday. On the third Saturday in June 1894, a public school children’s celebration of Flag Day took place in Chicago at Douglas, Garfield, Humboldt, Lincoln, and Washington Parks. More than 300,000 children participated, and the celebration was repeated the next year.Web page titled \\"Bernard J. CiGrand\\" at the National Flag Day Foundation website, retrieved May 8, 2008 From the late 1880s on, Cigrand spoke around the country promoting patriotism, respect for the flag, and the need for the annual observance of a flag day on June 14, the day in 1777 that the Continental Congress adopted the Stars and Stripes. He became president of the American Flag Day Association and later of the National Flag Day Society, which allowed him to promote his cause with organizational backing. Cigrand once noted he had given 2,188 speeches on patriotism and the flag. After joining the UIC College of Dentistry's teaching staff in 1899, Cigrand was elected by faculty to the Paris International Congress of Educators in 1900. He also was elected secretary of the faculty before becoming dean. After his deanship, he remained on the faculty well into the 1920s and was a frequent contributor to five Chicago newspapers Cigrand moved to Batavia, Illinois, in 1913 and built a house at 1184 South Batavia Avenue, which still stands. He practiced dentistry in the lower level of his home until 1920, when he moved his office to Aurora, Illinois. Cigrand continued to live in Batavia until 1932; he died shortly thereafter.Robinson, Marilyn, and Jeffery D. Schielke. John Gustafson's Historic Batavia. Batavia, Ill.: Batavia Historical Society, 1998, pp. 378–379. After 30 years of Cigrand's advocacy, President Woodrow Wilson proclaimed June 14 as Flag Day in 1916. (The United States Congress formally made the proclamation law in August 1949). Cigrand generally is credited with being the \\"Father of Flag Day,\\" with the Chicago Tribune noting that he \\"almost singlehandedly\\" established the holiday. ==References== *Brown, James.

The East Wing—the newest addition—explained the history of Hiroshima City before the bomb, development and decision to drop the bomb, the lives of Hiroshima citizens during World War II and after the bombing, and ended with information about the nuclear age and efforts for international peace. Included in this section was a model showing the damage done to the city. It had some important letters exchanged between scientists and top leaders of that era talking about atomic development and predicted result of its use. The West Wing, which was part of the old museum, concentrated on the damage of the bomb. Sections included Material Witness, which showed clothing, watches, hair, and other personal effects worn by victims of the bomb; Damage by the Heat Rays, a section that looked at what happened to wood, stone, metal, glass, and flesh from the heat; Damage by the Blast, focusing on the destruction caused by the after shocks of the blast, and Damage by the Radiation which went into detail about the health effects suffered by humans. The museum began major renovations in 2014. The East Wing reopened in April 2017, featuring more interactive displays and replacing the model of the city with a new version that uses projection mapping to demonstrate the effects of the bomb blast. When the East Wing reopened, the Main Hall was closed for seismic retrofitting until 25 April 2019. The exhibits were also renovated during this time to focus more on victim's belongings, and are now divided into four sections: an introductory exhibit in the East Wing, \\"Reality of the Atomic Bombing\\" and a gallery in the Main Building, \\"Dangers of Nuclear Weapons\\" in the East Wing, and \\"Hiroshima History\\" in the East Wing. ==List of notable visitorsGallery== image:Hiroshima museum.JPGFormer model of Hiroshima City flattened after the explosion.

In 1974, at the age of 16, he converted to Oneness Pentecostalism, but later began questioning the movement's teachings. Finally, in late 1979, he became an orthodox Christian. After earning a bachelor's degree in Philosophy from the University of Minnesota he attended Yale Divinity School, graduating cum laude with a Master of Divinity degree in 1982. He then attended Princeton Theological Seminary, earning a PhD in 1987, graduating magna cum laude. While at Princeton he was a classmate of Bart Ehrman and a student of Bruce Metzger. Boyd was then Professor of Theology at Bethel University for sixteen years. He resigned after there was a dispute between himself and some of the professors there over his open theism advocacy. Greg Boyd now teaches at Bethel University on an adjunct basis. In 1992 Boyd co- founded Woodland Hills Church. ==Thought== Greg Boyd Boyd's Princeton dissertation (published as Trinity and Process) was a critique of the process theology of Charles Hartshorne. Here, he attempts to construct a philosophical theology that retains the positive features of a process worldview, while avoiding its unorthodox implications. Boyd is also a former Oneness Pentecostal, and wrote the book Oneness Pentecostals and the Trinity (1992), critiquing the movement's anti-trinitarian view of God and other doctrines. Boyd is also known as one of the leading supporters of open theism, which he explores in the book God of the Possible (2000). In essence, open theism is the view that the future is partly open, and therefore known to God partly as a realm of possibilities. Proponents of the conservative or traditional view of God within the Baptist General Conference, such as John Piper, tried unsuccessfully to have the rules of the denomination changed to exclude Boyd and other open theists. He is widely known for his award-winning book Letters from a Skeptic (1994). This book is a collection of letters written by Boyd and his father Edward, who was an atheist at the time. Through the course of their correspondence, Boyd addressed many of the perennial intellectual challenges to the Christian faith, which led to his father's conversion. Boyd was featured in a front-page New York Times profile in July 2006, after losing 20% of his congregation because he refused to lend his public support to conservative political causes and directly challenged the highly politicized nature of American evangelical Christianity.\\"Disowning Conservative Politics\\" The New York Times, July 30, 2006 In his view, the Kingdom of God always looks like Jesus Christ. Jesus did not seek to maintain control or power over others, but instead sought to self-sacrificially serve and love them. Therefore, according to Boyd, the gospel cannot be associated with any particular political or nationalistic ideology. The congregational loss stemmed from his 2004 sermon series called \\"The Cross and the Sword.\\" As a result of the sermon series he authored the book The Myth of a Christian Nation: How the Quest for Political Power Is Destroying the Church (2006), in which he argues that a commitment to non-violence and to loving one's enemies lies at the heart of the teachings of Jesus. Boyd further discussed these views in the CNN documentary God's Warriors, which aired in August 2007. In a more recent book, The Myth of a Christian Religion: Losing Your Religion for the Beauty of a Revolution (2009), he presents his understanding of what the Kingdom of God is. In 2012, Woodland Hills Church began exploring Anabaptism and the possibility of affiliating with Mennonite Church USA and the Brethren in Christ. Boyd stated that \\"we've really been kind of growing in this direction since the church started, without knowing what Anabaptism was.\\" During the exploration, leadership asked the congregation to read Stuart Murray's The Naked Anabaptist, and the church has met with Anabaptist groups. Boyd in 2017 Boyd is known for his academic work on the topics of Satan, the problem of evil, spiritual warfare, and the demonic. He is authoring a series of books, titled Satan and Evil (produced by InterVarsity Press), two volumes of which have already been published: God at War: The Bible and Spiritual Conflict (1997) and Satan and the Problem of Evil: Constructing a Trinitarian Warfare Theodicy (2001). In between numerous other projects, he has been at work on the next installment of this series, tentatively titled The Myth of the Blueprint, which is now planned as a two-volume work with roughly 1,000 pages to each volume. Boyd is also a contributor to the 2012 book Understanding Spiritual Warfare: Four Views (eds. J. Beilby and P. R. Eddy, Baker Academic). Related to this, Boyd supports the Christus Victor model of the atonement. He is also a notable figure in New Testament scholarship and the Quest for the Historical Jesus. He is critical of liberal scholarship as typified by the Jesus Seminar as well as the individual work of scholars like John Dominic Crossan and Burton Mack. He has participated in numerous public debates, most notably with friend Robert M. Price and Dan Barker on the historicity of the New Testament and related matters. His first book in this area was Cynic Sage or Son of God? (1995). More recently, his book (co- authored with Paul Rhodes Eddy), The Jesus Legend: A Case for the Historical Reliability of the Synoptic Jesus Tradition (2007) won the 2008 Christianity Today Book of the Year Award (Biblical Studies category). He has written on, and advocates for, annihilationism. He was also one of the most prominent supporters of Rob Bell's controversial book Love Wins, offering an endorsement on the back of the book. Boyd appears in the 2012 documentary film Hellbound, encouraging Christians to have a more open mind about heaven, hell, and salvation. Boyd is also a contributor to the BioLogos Foundation and has written extensively about reconciling Christianity and evolution. ==Personal life== Boyd is a vegetarian and plays the drums. Boyd has grown children with his wife, Shelley, to whom he's been married for over thirty years. ==Books== *Trinity and Process: A Critical Evaluation and Reconstruction of Hartshorne's Di-Polar Theism Towards a Trinitarian Metaphysics (1992) *Oneness Pentecostals and the Trinity (1992) *Cynic Sage or Son of God?

It was innovative by its symmetrical design and use of interchangeable body parts. == Origin == The AMC Cavalier was part of three other prototypes that hinted at some of AMC's future production vehicles. In 1966, the Cavalier became part of \\"Project IV\\" touring the auto show circuit. This group of four show cars included the Vixen (a 4-seat coupe with \\"flying buttress\\" rear roof pillars), the AMX prototype (a 2-seat coupe that evolved into the real production car), and the AMX II (a notchback hardtop that was longer than the AMX). At the time, none of the concept cars carried the Rambler nameplate, which AMC started phasing out in 1966 in favor of AMC. Only the 4-door Cavalier sedan with 4 seats was designed by Dick Teague in AMC's advanced design studio. While the \\"Project IV\\" cars were being shown to the public, the automaker was already underway preparing for future production cars, and some of the Cavalier's design cues were incorporated into the new 1970 model year AMC Hornet, which required tooling and final stampings by summer 1969. == Innovations == The AMC Cavalier was unique in that the vehicle was a study in symmetry. It was built to demonstrate the use of numerous interchangeable body panels. For example, the fenders were identical (the opposite ends, e.g. left front and right rear). The doors were similarly shared with opposite sides (an idea originated by Cord on its prototype 935 Saloon) since the rear doors were hinged in the back (suicide door). The hood and decklid were also interchangeable. The Nash Metropolitan, which was sold by AMC up to 1962, also had interchangeable inner panels, but their outer skins were different. In addition to reducing tooling costs by thirty percent, the design objective of the AMC Cavalier was also to demonstrate how to reduce the costs of production. Another small independent automaker also sought to reduce manufacturing costs toward the end of its existence. Studebaker developed a concept car with a wheelbase for potential launch in 1967-1969. The fiberglass construction of the \\"Familia\\" design study featured interchangeable hood and trunk, doors, bumpers, head-light, and taillight housings, windshield and back window, as well as side windows. However, the Familia's concepts were not incorporated into Studebaker production cars. The AMC Cavalier also featured curved sides, as if a fuselage, punctuated by full wheel arches and riding on \\"mag\\" wheels with whitewall tires. The rear roof pillars (\\"C\\" pillar) were a \\"flying buttress\\" design providing the profile view of the car with a sweptback roof style to what appears to be a short rear deck. The rear window was recessed between the C pillars, making back area look similar to that of the General Motors' 1966-1967 \\"A\\" body platform two-door models, such as the Chevrolet Chevelle and Pontiac GTO. The swept-back panels and roof were covered in black vinyl to enhance the car's deep red metallic body finish. The AMC Cavalier featured a minimal amount of ornamentation compared to contemporary production cars, but was comparable to popular foreign makes as AMC was interested in marketing the car overseas. Utility was enhanced with dual-action scissor-type hinges on the deck lid so it could be opened like a normal trunk lid, or elevated to the height of the car's roof to accommodate tall, large, and bulky items in the trunk area. Safety was emphasized with wrap-around rear lights designed to illuminate alternate warning signals in green, yellow, and red. A built-in roll bar reinforcement allowed for the thin pillar posts and roof panel. Exterior door handles were replaced with flush, push-type door buttons. The dashboard of the AMC Cavalier was a schematic layout of the car; the vehicle's profile and interior cavities were represented in the design of the dashboard. Under the innovative body panel structure, the concept vehicle had a conventional front-mounted AMC V8 engine with rear-wheel drive (FR layout). The compact-sized AMC Cavalier rode on a wheelbase and offered seating capacity for six adults. == Legacy == According to Robert B. Evans, chairman of the automaker at the time, the innovative AMC Cavalier toured the auto show circuit to \\"help restore public confidence in AMC, where sales have sagged.\\" \\"The styling of this car totally works when contrasted with the other similarly sized offerings\\" during the mid-1960s that included the Chevrolet Corvair and the Ford Falcon. Except for the short hood giving it equal-length front and rear decks, many of the Cavalier's styling touches found their way into the AMC Hornet that was introduced for the 1970 model year. The Hornet was also designed under the direction of Richard A. Teague. \\"The Cavalier's strong horizontal lines, flat surfaces, minimal overhangs and blockish face were all visual hints to the 1970 AMC Hornet compact.\\" Although the production Hornets did not use interchangeable body parts, its front and rear bumpers were made from the same stamping. A coupe version of the Cavalier was also part of the \\"Project IV\\" concept tour, but was designed without parts swapping. This companion model, called the \\"Vixen\\" also forecast the 1970 Hornet appearance \\"in its simple blunt \\"face,\\" dual headlamps, long-hood/short-deck profile, and flared wheel openings.\\" Teague took the exact opposite of the Cavalier's symmetrical design for the 1973 \\"Hornet GT\\" concept car. This car featured differently styled sides and pillars to test ways of improving both visibility and roof strength, as well as gaining more interior space. == Postage stamp == The Sharjah Post Office issued a 3 dirham (Dh) airmail stamp in January 1971 depicting a drawing of the AMC Cavalier (Michel catalog stamp number 783). It is part of a \\"Post Day\\" series of stamps illustrating a pair of early and modern automobiles. The postage stamp shows a 1904 Rambler and the Cavalier is misidentified on the stamp as a 1970 car, probably because the concept vehicle looked so similar to the AMC Hornet that was introduced for the 1970 model year. == Name == American Motors planned to use the \\"Cavalier\\" name for a new pony car model to debut in 1968. By that time, however, General Motors had secured the rights to the \\"Cavalier\\" name, which it would use fourteen years later on the Chevrolet Cavalier. The second choice was selected: Javelin. == References == * American Motors Corporation, Public Relations Department, \\"Project IV\\" Press Releases (various dates). * Cavalier Category:Concept cars Category:Compact cars Category:Sedans Category:Rear-wheel-drive vehicles ","title":"AMC Cavalier"},{"id":"6207589","text":"Erin Brown (born Erin DeWright)Erin Brown.

This entry covers the history of the line and the station. The station and line was opened in 1881 with the passenger service being withdrawn in 1939 and the line closing in 1951 although a siding remained at the Wymondham end until 1976. ==Description== Ashwellthorpe station was located 2 miles and 76 chains from Forncett station and consisted of two platforms with the main station building which incorporated a two-storey stationmaster's house) being located on the down side. This was equipped with a booking office, toilets and a waiting room. A simple shelter was provided on the up platform and the signal box was located to the north of that. Two brick built cottages were also provided and located on the station approach road. A single siding goods yard was provided. ==HistoryGreat Eastern Railway (1881-1922)=== As early as 1853 Peter Bruff surveyed a link between Wymondham and Forncett on the Norwich to Ipswich line for the Eastern Counties Railway but the plans were not developed. During the 1870s railway companies backed by the Midland Railway and Great Northern Railway alerted the Great Eastern Railway to potential threats to its monopoly in the North Norfolk area. To address this a new line from Wymondham to Forncett was proposed to offer connections via a change at Forncett to the Norwich to Liverpool Street line. Construction started in April 1880 through an area of rolling farmland with a bridge over the River Tas. A year later in April 1881 with the line substantially complete, the contract for building Ashwellthorpe station was awarded to William Bell & Sons for £3,026. The line opened on 2 May 1881 although improvements at Forncett railway station (a footbridge and locomotive turntable) were not ready in time. The line was built as double track throughout, was 6 miles 16 chains long, and was controlled by three signal boxes (Forncett Junction, Ashwellthorpe and Wymondham North Junction). In 1882 the 1.50 pm departure from Wells arrived at Forncett at 3.08 pm in time to connect to the up express and arrive in Liverpool Street at 6.00 pm. In the opposite direction, a 5.50 pm departure from Liverpool Street would see an arrival of 9.15 pm. The line was primarily used for passenger diversions and freight that did not need to be routed via Norwich. However following flooding at Flordon (north of Forncett) in 1912 main line passenger services were diverted via Wymondham (where they would have reversed0 between 26 August and 2 October. After World War one through trains to Wells ceased and the 1922 showed six trains each way on the line operating Forncett to Wymondham only. ===London & North Eastern Railway (1923-1948)=== Following the passing of the Railways Act 1921 on 1 January 1923 the operation of the line and Ashwellthorpe station was taken over by the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER). Rationalisation at Forncett Junction followed with the abolition of the signal box and responsibility transferring to Forncett station signal box. The July 1939 timetable showed six passenger trains each way along the line on a weekday with the first up and last down operating from/to Dereham. However, the outbreak of World War II saw the passenger service withdrawn on 10 September never to be restored. Goods traffic meanwhile continued with Ashwellthorpe being serviced by a daily freight and a small number of freight trains running over the line. Airfield construction (of RAF Hethel) saw additional construction traffic use the station in 1941/42. ===British Railways (1948–1951)=== Following nationalisation in 1948 the station became part of the Eastern Region of British Railways. The passenger service had not been restored after the war and by the July 1950 timetable change the only remaining traffic was the weekday \\"as required\\" freight service typically worked by a former GER 0-6-0T. The line was closed in August 1951 although a two-mile stub was retained at the north end to store redundant rolling stock. In December 1954, the remains of the branch were used to stable the royal train overnight. Norwich based scrap firm A King and Sons took over the site in the 1960s and the site became the final resting place of many locomotives and carriages before closure in early 1976. Wymondham North Junction was removed on 3 August 1976 although the signal box had been closed at an earlier date. ==The site today== The station was located off the B113 road, east of Ashwellthorpe village towards Toprow. The former station site and part of the railway alignment are now used as industrial estate. The former station building has been adapted as an office on the site. ==References== * == See also == * List of closed railway stations in Norfolk * List of closed railway stations in Britain == References == * ==External links== * Ashwellthorpe station on navigable 1946 O.

It is classified as a feeder airport by the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines, an attached agency of the Department of Transportation and Communications that is responsible for the operations all airports in the Philippines, except the major international airports. Presently, the government is planning to develop the airport to support the commercial and tourism industry in the region, most especially Calicoan Island, an upcoming island resort for surfers and beachcombers. ==History== Aerial view of Guiuan Airfield during the Allied Occupation. Guiuan Airport was originally a United States Navy air base in World War II built by Seabees from the 61st and 93rd Naval Construction Battalions. After forces led by General Douglas Macarthur landed on Leyte on October 20, 1944, the first step towards the liberation of the Philippines from Japanese occupation, work began on improving or constructing several airfields around the area. The US Navy initially attempted to construct a strip on the Samar shore of San Pablo Bay. It was soon found to be unusable after heavy rain, so the project was abandoned. After a brief search, Navy engineers settled on Guiuan, a town on the southeast promontory of Samar. Work was conducted by the 93rd Seabees and the first plane landed on December 18, 1944. US Navy and US Army Air Force aircraft were operating on the field by Christmas 1944. The strip was used by corsairs of the marines stationed there as well as the 22nd and 5th Bombardment Groups of the Army Air Force.Maurer, Maurer (1983). Air Force Combat Units Of World War II. Maxwell AFB, Alabama: Office of Air Force History. . p.38 The 22nd Bombardment Group arrived on 21 January 1945.Maurer, p.73 The 61st NCB built the two airstrips that were the Guiuan Airbase. The 61st camp was right next to the ramp where the 22nd bomb group was and next to it the 5th bomb group. There were also about a dozen Corsairs, but you usually saw only six parked at the strip at any one time. Probably the biggest landing force to land at any airbase in the Pacific War took place at Guiuan before the invasion of Luzon. A typhoon was headed for the task force and all the flying aircraft that could go went in one formation from all the carriers to Guiuan which had two six thousand foot runways built by the 61st NCB. The formation flew over then broke up and landed at the front end near the B-24 ramps and at the middle of the strips. The planes were landing in formations and then taxied to parking areas maybe four aircraft huddled next to each of the B-24's of the 22nd and 5th bomb groups and planes down both sides of the runways.

For most of that time their line-up was Les Gock on lead guitar, Keith Lamb on lead vocals, Rick Lum on bass guitar and Chris 'Smiley' Pailthorpe on drums. They had top 10 hits on the Kent Music Report with their cover versions of \\"Bony Moronie\\" and \\"Glad All Over\\" (both 1975). The group frequently appeared on the TV pop music show, Countdown, and toured nationally. == History  Australian success: 1971-1977=== Hush were formed in the Sydney suburb of Seven Hills in 1971 as a five piece light pop group by Robin Jackson on guitar, John Koutts on drums, Keith Lamb on lead vocals, Rick Lum on bass guitar and Chris Nolan on keyboards. Jackson and Lamb had migrated to Australia from England at the same time. Nolan had previously been with Grandmars Observers. Hush released their debut single, \\"Over You\\", late that year via the Philips label. In April of the following year Les Gock (ex-Chariot) on lead guitar and Chris \\"Smiley\\" Pailthorpe on drums joined Lamb and Lum in the Hush four-piece line-up. They reached the state finals of national band competition, Hoadley's Battle of the Sounds, and issued a cover version of \\"White Christmas\\" as a single in December. Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, felt that \\"Gock gave the band a tougher sound in the guitar department.\\" During 1973 they supported concerts by the Jackson Five and by Status Quo. Hush first made the Kent Music Report singles chart in October 1973, with their own composition, \\"Get the Feeling\\", which reached No. 40. They followed with their debut album, Aloud 'n' Live, on WEA, reached No. 40 on the Kent Music Report albums chart. In February 1974, the band released \\"Man Eater\\", which peaked at number 88. Their second album, Get Rocked!, was issued in July 1974 on Wizard Records and peaked at No. 9 The Canberra Times Garry Raffaele declared, \\"May the saints preserve us from such musical sludge.\\" The title track provided Lamb with a memorable moment, he recalled in August 2004 that they were due to perform in Manjimup, Western Australia, \\"The mayor had heard we got the crowd to sing 'get fucked' during our song 'Get Rocked' ... which is something the crowd always did off its own bat. The police said the mayor didn't want us interfering with the local girls.\\" The group's highest charting original single, \\"Walking\\" (August 1974), was co- written by Gock and Lamb, which peaked at No. 22. They released their third album, C'mon We're Taking Over in November 1974, which reached No. 26 In 1975, Hush made an appearance on pop music TV show, Countdown, performing a rocked up, driving cover version of Larry Williams's \\"Bony Moronie\\". The song made No. 4 on the singles chart in September 1975, riding the wave of the glam-rock craze in Australia. The band's fourth studio album, Rough Tough 'n' Ready was released in November 1975 and peaked at No. 15\\\\. McFarlane felt that \\"One of the defining moments of Australia's 1970s pop legacy was undoubtably Hush performing \\"Boney Moroney\\".\\" He described how \\"Lamb wiggled his satin flares- encased bum, thrust out his crotch and leered at the camera with a mischievous look in his eyes (and all the little girls understood). [Gock] dashed around the set in stack-heeled boots and glam threads, with peroxided streaks in his flowing, jet-black hair. [Lum] hammed it up in a serious kind of way. [Pailthorpe] cheerfully revealed his goofy, gap-toothed grin whenever the camera panned across his face.\\" Their next cover version, \\"Glad All Over\\" (late 1975), which peaked at No. 8, was originally released by the Dave Clark Five. In August 1976 they added a second guitarist, Jacques De Jongh (ex- Shadowfax, Redhouse); Rick Lum left three months later and De Jongh moved over to bass guitar. They supported Alice Cooper on his tour of Australia during March 1977. The group released an album, Touché, in July of that year. McFarlane noticed they \\"tried to make a serious affirmation of [their] abilities\\" where the album \\"featured a rock side, A Touch of Decadence, and a slow side, A Touch of Class.\\" Pailthorpe left the group at the end of 1977 with Gock following soon after. === Post break-up: 1977-present=== After the band broke up in 1977 De Jongh and Lamb formed New Hush, a.k.a. Hush 2. De Jongh left in April 1978 to join John Paul Young and the All Stars. Lamb continued New Hush with Criston Barker on bass guitar (ex-Ash, Freeway, Hollywood), Con Gallin on guitar (ex-Fingerprint), Paul Grant on guitar (ex- Buster Brown, Hollywood) and Nat De Palma on drums (ex-20th Century). Lamb formed other bands including Keith Lamb Band, Larry and Airport. He was later a partner in an international embroidery company, Rajmahal, and co-author of a card game series, TAOC: The Art of Conversation. Lamb co-wrote songs for Status Quo, including the top 10 hit, \\"Ol' Rag Blues\\" (September 1983). According to McFarlane \\"in the lucrative world of advertising, [Gock] has established himself as one of the country's foremost music and sound designers. He has also produced the soundtracks for the film Puberty Blues and the television drama Water Rats.\\" Pailthorpe became an architect. De Jongh continued his music career and recorded material; he was also a chef. Lum worked in graphic design. In November 1979 Lamb reformed Hush for a one-off gig, Concert of the Decade, at the forecourt of the Sydney Opera House. Hush reunited in August 2004 for a Nordoff-Robbins charity event. The line-up of Gock, Lamb, Lum and Pailthorpe performed together for the first time in 25 years. Gock's son Adam joined them on stage. In September 2006 Hush toured Australia with other artists on the Countdown Spectacular Tour. Another original member, guitarist Robin Jackson, then-playing with Chris Turner & the Wolftones, re-joined Hush for that tour. After leaving Hush in 1972 Jackson had \\"dropped out of music for a bit. But late '76 I got the bug again and joined the '60s oriented group Punkz.\\" Punkz changed their name to Cheek in mid-1977 to avoid association with punk music; they had a top 50 hit with \\"So Much in Love\\" (January 1978). == Members == * Keith Lamb – lead vocals (1971–77, 1979, 2004, 2006) * Robin Jackson – lead guitar (1971–72, 2006) * John Koutts – drums (1971–72) * Rick Lum – bass guitar (1971–76, 2004, 2006) * Chris Nolan – keyboards (1971–72) * Les Gock – lead guitar (1972–77, 2004, 2006) * Chris Pailthorpe – drums (1972–77, 2004, 2006) * Jacques De Jongh – rhythm guitar, bass guitar (1976–77) == Discography  Studio albums === { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" border=\\"1\\" + List of albums, with selected chart positions and certifications ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:12em;\\" Title ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:16em;\\" Album details ! scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"1\\" Peak chart positions - ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\"AUS Australian chart peaks: *Top 100 (Kent Music Report) peaks to 19 June 1988: N.B.

Isabelle Carreau, from TV Squad, compared Serena and Dan's relationship to Friends main couple Ross and Rachel by saying that \\"the couple has a bumpy road ahead\\". Although, she felt that the couples scenes \\"felt a little flat\\" for her taste, and that she had expected \\"something juicier than what we were offered\\". She defined the episode as \\"an enjoyable episode filled with twists and turns and loads of backstabbing\\" and also defended Vanessa by saying that she's starting to like of the character \\"because of the calmness and maturity she can show\\". Michelle Graham, from Film School Rejects, had said that \\"Catherine’s comments on her need for Nate and how Blair’s relationship with Lord Marcus might be missing one thing is an interesting parallel\\", and also said that even though \\"it was nice to see Vanessa again\\", \\"she did come off very whiny and a tad annoying\\". She had also said that \\"Jenny’s sudden rise from intern to confidante of the designer felt incredibly contrived\\", and that the scene where Blair make-out with Chuck knowing that it's him, not Marcus makes \\"no-sense\\". However, she defined the scene of the girls catching Serena and Dan up to the park as \\"excellent\\". Buzz Sugar, from the BuzzSugar site, had said that she can't anything too serious on the series and that she's \\"loving how ridiculous this season is\\". However, she did enjoyed the scene of the little girls at the park and the bonding between Eleanor and Jenny. Kona Gallagher, from Television Blend, had said that she felt \\"silly\\" that Catherine was jealous of Nate and Vanessa's relationship, because at the end she's a married woman. She was confused and angry over the reason that lead to Serena and Dan's break-up by saying that it was such a \\"clichéd class war nonsense\\". She said that the episode overall had made \\"every relationship suddenly became completely contrived and laughable\\" and that pissed her off. Amber Charleville, from Firefox News, had said that Dan's reason to break-up with Serena \\"sounds more like bitter jealousy than righteous indignation\\" than something else, and that the episode overall \\"ties up a lot of loose ends, but makes others fray unbecomingly\\".

The Big Pasture was of prairie land, in what is now southwestern Oklahoma. The land had been reserved for grazing use by the Kiowa, Comanche, and Apache tribes after their reserve was opened for settlement by a lottery conducted during June through August 1901. The tribes, however, leased most of the land out to large ranchers and it became known as Big Pasture. The Big Pasture was maintained for grazing until June 5, 1906, when Congress passed an act (Chapter 2580, 34 Stat. 213) requiring that it be disposed of by allotting , in severalty, to each child born into the tribes after the act of 1900. The remaining land was sold by sealed bid in December 1906 and the proceeds placed in the U.S. Treasury for the tribes. This was the last large tract of land opened for settlement in Oklahoma Territory. ==History== If newspaper accounts are to be believed, Coronado crossed the middle of the Big Pasture in his search for QuiviraCooper, Chronicles of Oklahoma, 1957: \\"The Temple Tribune [Oklahoma], August 22, 1907, Eschiti, Oklahoma.--While excavating on a right-of-way near here a party of scraper drivers unearthed a historic tombstone that appears to have been set in a graveyard that once existed here. On the front of the marble slab is an inscription printed in undiscernable Spanish, above the inscription being the name, 'Don Juan Valerez El Padre, Madrid Senor de la Bonito Senorito.' Beneath the inscription is the date, '1542.'\\" The Big Pasture was the scene of a well publicized wolf hunt by Theodore Roosevelt in 1905. He especially wanted to see John \\"Jack (Catch 'm Alive)\\" Abernathy from Frederick catch wolves with his bare hands. This hunt and his visit with Quanah Parker are often cited as reasons for his determination to create the nearby Wichita Mountain Wildlife Refuge and to return buffalo to the wild. The Wichita Mountains had previously been designated only as a Forest Preserve when first put under protection by William McKinley in 1901. ==Geography== The Big Pasture covered a strip of land north and south and east and west in what is now parts of Comanche, Cotton and Tillman counties. The towns of Randlett, Devol, Grandfield, Loveland, and Hollister (from east to west) are located in what was the Big Pasture. Randlett is home to Big Pasture Public Schools, a consolidated school system serving Devol, Cookietown, and Randlett. Before settlement, the Big Pasture was mostly plains cut by two timbered draws. Captain Randolph B. Marcy in his Red River expedition in 1852 noted that the timbered regions he found along Cache Creek were the last of any size until he reached the foothills of the Rockies. ==FootnotesBibliography== *Cooper, Charles M. \\"The Big Pasture\\" Chronicles of Oklahoma 35:2 (April 1957) 138-146 (retrieved August 16, 2006). *Kappler, Charles (Editor). \\"ACTS OF FIFTY-SIXTH CONGRESS—FIRST SESSION, 1900\\"; Chapter 813, 31 Stat., 672.

McINTOSH COLLECTION) was a Scottish journalist and author best known for writing science fiction under the pen name J.T. McIntosh. ==Biography== Born in Paisley, Renfrewshire, Scotland, but living largely in Aberdeen, MacGregor used the pseudonym McIntosh (along with its variants J. T. MacIntosh, and J. T. M'Intosh) as well as \\"H. J. Murdoch\\", \\"Gregory Francis\\" (with Frank H. Parnell), and \\"Stuart Winsor\\" (with Jeff Mason) for all his science fiction work, which was the majority of his literature, though he did publish books by his own name. His first story, \\"The Curfew Tolls\\", was published in the magazine Astounding Science Fiction during 1950, and his first novel, World Out of Mind, was published during 1953. He did not publish any work after 1980. He died during 2008. Along with John Mather and Edith Dell, he is credited for the screenplay for the colour feature movie Satellite in the Sky (1956). During 2010 the National Library of Scotland purchased his literary papers and correspondence. ==Critical reception== John Clute writes that \\"McIntosh never lost the vivid narrative skills that made him an interesting figure of 1950s sf, but his failure to challenge himself or his readers in his later career led to results that verged on mediocrity. His early work warrants revival\\".\\"McIntosh, J T\\", The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction ==Partial bibliographyNovels=== *World out of Mind (Doubleday, June 1953) *Born Leader (Doubleday, January 1954; abridged in Museum Press and Corgi editions; also as Worlds Apart, Avon, 1956) *One in Three Hundred (Doubleday, 1954; from 3 novellas appeared in F&SF;, 1953-1954) *The Fittest (Doubleday, June 1955; also as The Rule of the Pagbeasts, Fawcett Crest, 1956) *When the Ship Sank (Doubleday, June 1959, as James Murdoch Macgregor) *Incident Over the Pacific (Doubleday, October 1960, as James Murdoch Macgregor)(also as A Cry to Heaven, Heinemann, March 1961) *Two Hundred Years to Christmas (Ace, 1961, dos-a-dos with Rebels of the Red Planet by Charles L.

They look similar but South Buffalo is smaller, while Buffalo is larger. Unlike much of the rest of the industrial Allegheny River valley, this area has been experiencing modest population growth in recent years. That has led to the district reorganizing their schools for the 2015-2016 school year, to eliminate two school buildings (the former Freeport Jr High School and the Freeport Kindergarten Center) and to open the new larger Freeport Area Middle School.

The income limit is $35,000 for homeowners. The maximum rebate for both homeowners and renters is $650. Applicants can exclude one-half (1/2) of their Social Security income, so people who make substantially more than $35,000 may still qualify for a rebate. Individuals must apply annually for the rebate. This rebate can be taken in addition to Homestead/Farmstead Property Tax Relief.

The old middle school gym had a cement floor and couldn't be used for sporting events. In the 1960s, the Cafe was added to the School. Before then the students would travel out in Freeport and eat at several restaurants. The Junior High school used to be the high school. In 1960, a new high school was built in Sarver. Some high school events, such as football games, were still at the junior high. As of 2008, scoreboards were installed at the senior high fields, and the high school sports have been moved to the senior high. The varsity football team played at the junior high until the 2016-2017 school year, when a new athletic complex was built adjacent to the high school and middle school campuses in Sarver. ==See also== * List of school districts in Pennsylvania ==References * Freeport Area School District website Category:School districts established in 1969 Category:School districts in Butler County, Pennsylvania Category:School districts in Armstrong County, Pennsylvania Category:Education in Pittsburgh area Category:1969 establishments in Pennsylvania ","title":"Freeport Area School District"},{"id":"6207793","text":"In mathematics, the geodesic equations are second-order non-linear differential equations, and are commonly presented in the form of Euler–Lagrange equations of motion. However, they can also be presented as a set of coupled first-order equations, in the form of Hamilton's equations. This latter formulation is developed in this article. ==Overview== It is frequently said that geodesics are \\"straight lines in curved space\\". By using the Hamilton–Jacobi approach to the geodesic equation, this statement can be given a very intuitive meaning: geodesics describe the motions of particles that are not experiencing any forces. In flat space, it is well known that a particle moving in a straight line will continue to move in a straight line if it experiences no external forces; this is Newton's first law. The Hamiltonian describing such motion is well known to be H=p^2/2m with p being the momentum. It is the conservation of momentum that leads to the straight motion of a particle. On a curved surface, exactly the same ideas are at play, except that, in order to measure distances correctly, one must use the metric. To measure momenta correctly, one must use the inverse of the metric. The motion of a free particle on a curved surface still has exactly the same form as above, i.e. consisting entirely of a kinetic term. The resulting motion is still, in a sense, a \\"straight line\\", which is why it is sometimes said that geodesics are \\"straight lines in curved space\\". This idea is developed in greater detail below. ==Geodesics as an application of the principle of least action== Given a (pseudo-)Riemannian manifold M, a geodesic may be defined as the curve that results from the application of the principle of least action. A differential equation describing their shape may be derived, using variational principles, by minimizing (or finding the extremum) of the energy of a curve. Given a smooth curve :\\\\gamma:I\\\\to M that maps an interval I of the real number line to the manifold M, one writes the energy :E(\\\\gamma)=\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\int_I g(\\\\dot \\\\gamma(t),\\\\dot\\\\gamma(t))\\\\,dt, where \\\\dot\\\\gamma(t) is the tangent vector to the curve \\\\gamma at point t \\\\in I. Here, g(\\\\cdot,\\\\cdot) is the metric tensor on the manifold M. Using the energy given above as the action, one may choose to solve either the Euler–Lagrange equations or the Hamilton–Jacobi equations. Both methods give the geodesic equation as the solution; however, the Hamilton–Jacobi equations provide greater insight into the structure of the manifold, as shown below. In terms of the local coordinates on M, the (Euler–Lagrange) geodesic equation is :\\\\frac{d^2x^a}{dt^2} + \\\\Gamma^{a}_{bc}\\\\frac{dx^b}{dt}\\\\frac{dx^c}{dt} = 0 where the xa(t) are the coordinates of the curve γ(t), \\\\Gamma^{a}_{bc} are the Christoffel symbols, and repeated indices imply the use of the summation convention. ==Hamiltonian approach to the geodesic equations== Geodesics can be understood to be the Hamiltonian flows of a special Hamiltonian vector field defined on the cotangent space of the manifold. The Hamiltonian is constructed from the metric on the manifold, and is thus a quadratic form consisting entirely of the kinetic term. The geodesic equations are second- order differential equations; they can be re-expressed as first-order equations by introducing additional independent variables, as shown below. Note that a coordinate neighborhood U with coordinates xa induces a local trivialization of :T^*M_{U}\\\\simeq U \\\\times \\\\mathbb{R}^n by the map which sends a point :\\\\eta \\\\in T_x^*M_{U} of the form \\\\eta = p_a dx^a to the point (x,p_a) \\\\in U\\\\times\\\\mathbb{R}^n. Then introduce the Hamiltonian as :H(x,p)=\\\\frac{1}{2}g^{ab}(x)p_a p_b. Here, gab(x) is the inverse of the metric tensor: gab(x)gbc(x) = \\\\delta^a_c. The behavior of the metric tensor under coordinate transformations implies that H is invariant under a change of variable. The geodesic equations can then be written as :\\\\dot{x}^a = \\\\frac{\\\\partial H}{\\\\partial p_a} = g^{ab}(x) p_b and :\\\\dot{p}_a = - \\\\frac {\\\\partial H}{\\\\partial x^a} = -\\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\frac {\\\\partial g^{bc}(x)}{\\\\partial x^a} p_b p_c. The flow determined by these equations is called the cogeodesic flow; a simple substitution of one into the other obtains the Euler–Lagrange equations, which give the geodesic flow on the tangent bundle TM. The geodesic lines are the projections of integral curves of the geodesic flow onto the manifold M. This is a Hamiltonian flow, and the Hamiltonian is constant along the geodesics: :\\\\frac{dH}{dt} = \\\\frac {\\\\partial H}{\\\\partial x^a} \\\\dot{x}^a + \\\\frac{\\\\partial H}{\\\\partial p_a} \\\\dot{p}_a = \\\\- \\\\dot{p}_a \\\\dot{x}^a + \\\\dot{x}^a \\\\dot{p}_a = 0. Thus, the geodesic flow splits the cotangent bundle into level sets of constant energy :M_E = \\\\\\\\{ (x,p) \\\\in T^*M : H(x,p)=E \\\\\\\\} for each energy E ≥ 0, so that :T^*M=\\\\bigcup_{E \\\\ge 0} M_E. ==References== * Terence Tao, The Euler-Arnold Equation, 2010: http://terrytao.wordpress.com/2010/06/07/the-euler-arnold-equation/ See the discussion at the beginning * Ralph Abraham and Jerrold E.

Three-helix bundles are among the smallest and fastest known cooperatively folding structural domains. The three-helix bundle in the villin headpiece domain is only 36 amino acids long and is a common subject of study in molecular dynamics simulations because its microsecond-scale folding time is within the timescales accessible to simulation. The 40-residue HIV accessory protein has a very similar fold and has also been the subject of extensive study. There is no general sequence motif associated with three- helix bundles, so they cannot necessarily be predicted from sequence alone. Three-helix bundles often occur in actin-binding proteins and in DNA-binding proteins. ==Four-helix bundles== Four-helix bundles typically consist of four helices packed in a coiled-coil arrangement with a sterically close-packed hydrophobic core in the center. Pairs of adjacent helices are often additionally stabilized by salt bridges between charged amino acids. The helix axes typically are oriented about 20 degrees from their neighboring helices, a much shallower incline than in the larger helical structure of the globin fold.Branden C, Tooze J. (1999). Introduction to Protein Structure 2nd ed. Garland Publishing: New York, NY. The specific topology of the helices is dependent on the protein – helices that are adjacent in sequence are often antiparallel, although it is also possible to arrange antiparallel links between two pairs of parallel helices. Because dimeric coiled-coils are themselves relatively stable, four-helix bundles can be dimers of coiled-coil pairs, as in the Rop protein. Four-helix bundle can have thermal stability more than 100 °C. Other examples of four-helix bundles include cytochrome, ferritin, human growth hormone, cytokine, and Lac repressor C-terminal. The four-helix bundle fold has proven an attractive target for de novo protein design, with numerous de novo four-helix bundle proteins having been successfully designed by rational and by combinatorial methods. Although sequence is not conserved among four-helix bundles, sequence patterns tend to mirror those of coiled-coil structures in which every fourth and seventh residue is hydrophobic. ==See also== *Knobs into holes packing ==References * SCOP cytochrome c fold * SCOP nucleic acid-binding three- helix bundles * SCOP four-helix bundles * SCOP Rop-like proteins * SCOP all- alpha proteins Category:Protein folds ","title":"Helix bundle"},{"id":"6207847","text":"Runoff voting can refer to: * Two-round system, a voting system used to elect a single winner, whereby only two candidates from the first round continue to the second round, where one candidate will win * Instant-runoff voting, an electoral system whereby voters rank the candidates in order of preference * Contingent vote, a two-round system of instant-runoff voting. * Exhaustive ballot, a reiterative voting system, whereby rounds of voting continue (with or without elimination) until one candidate achieves a majority, also called repeated balloting ","title":"Runoff voting"},{"id":"6207855","text":"While the City Sleeps, We Rule the Streets is the debut studio album by Cobra Starship.

During this time, Saporta went on a \\"vision quest\\", spending time with Native American tribes and smoking peyote. He began to create his vision for a new band, a melodic style of music heavily influenced by synthpop and hip hop. Upon returning home, Saporta rented a house in the Catskill Mountains and began writing what would become While the City Sleeps, We Rule the Streets. He posted a parody response to Gwen Stefani's \\"Hollaback Girl\\" titled \\"Hollaback Boy\\" on Myspace. The song gained Saporta notoriety on the internet and he eventually signed to Fall Out Boy bassist Pete Wentz's label, Decaydance Records. Gabe Saporta stated that most of the songs from this recording particularly concern his personal life and career: \\"Being from Jersey Means Never Having to Say You're Sorry\\" centers on feelings of emptiness and hopelessness, regarding the area he was (partly) brought-up in, while \\"The Ballad of Big Poppa and Diamond Girl\\" concerns a quiet young girl he met at a disco in Los Angeles. ==Music== On While the City Sleeps, We Rule the Streets Saporta abandons the \\"voice-quivering drama and super-intense rock\\" of Midtown in favor of \\"a more lighthearted, groove- oriented style\\". The album begins with an acoustic intro entitled \\"Being from Jersey Means Never Having to Say You're Sorry\\".

A British and Native American force captured the island soon after the outbreak of war between Britain and the United States. Encouraged by the easy British victory, more Native Americans rallied to their support. Their cooperation was an important factor in several British victories during the remainder of the war. ==Background== Mackinac Island was a U.S. fur trading post in the Straits of Mackinac between Lake Michigan and Lake Huron. Since the mid-seventeenth century, it had been important for its influence and control over the Native tribes in the area.McCoy, Raymond. (1946), p.55 British and Canadian traders had resented the island being ceded to the United States at the end of the American Revolutionary War.Elting, p.29 The United States Army maintained a small fort, named Fort Mackinac, on the island. The fur trade was the most important part of the economy of the large area known as the Northwest. Each spring, large numbers of Native Americans from modern Michigan, Minnesota and Wisconsin gathered at Mackinac or the (Canadian) North West Company's trading post at Sault Sainte Marie about distant to exchange furs for trade goods. Since the end of the American Revolutionary War, the British Government's policy had been to maintain friendly relations with the Native tribes,McCoy, Raymond (1946). p.55 and officers of the Indian Department distributed regular presents to them at the British military post at St. Joseph Island.Elting (1995), p.12 Many of the Native American tribes from the area were already opposed to the steady western expansion of American settlements and when war came, were eager to join forces with the British and Canadians or mount raids and attacks of their own. ==Outbreak of war== Upon learning of the outbreak of war, Major General Issac Brock sent a canoe party to inform Captain Charles Roberts of the news, and orders to capture Fort Mackinac. The British commander in Upper Canada, Major General Isaac Brock, had kept the commander of the post at St. Joseph Island, Captain Charles Roberts, informed of events as war appeared increasingly likely from the start of 1812. As soon as he learned of the outbreak of war, Brock sent a canoe party led by the noted trader William McKay to Roberts with the vital news, and orders to capture Mackinac. McKay reached St. Joseph Island on 8 July. With the assistance of the North West Company, Roberts immediately began to collect a force consisting of three men of the Royal Artillery, 47 British soldiers of the 10th Royal Veteran Battalion (which Roberts later described as being \\"debilitated and worn down by unconquerable drunkenness\\"Hitsman, p.74), 150 Canadian or métis (part-Indian) fur traders and voyageurs, 300 Ojibwa (Chippewa) or Ottawas who were at the island to trade skins.Dunnigan, Brian Leigh (2008) and 110 Sioux, Menominee and Winnebago who had been recruited from present-day Wisconsin by Indian agent Robert Dickson.Hitsman, p.72Wood, Edwin (1918). p. 285. As preparations for the expedition proceeded, Roberts received successive orders from Brock to cancel, and then to reinstate, the attack on Mackinac. Colonel Edward Baynes, the Adjutant General for all British forces in Canada, also sent orders for Roberts to concentrate on defending St. Joseph Island. However, on 15 July, Roberts received further orders from Brock which allowed him to use his own discretion. Fearing that the Native American contingents would drift away if they were not allowed to attack, Roberts immediately set out.Hitsman, p.73 His force was embarked in the armed schooner Caledonia belonging to the North West Company, seventy war canoes and ten bateaux. ==Capture of Mackinac== Fort Mackinac, Michigan Fort Mackinac was a log fort sited on a limestone ridge which overlooked the harbour at the south-eastern end of the island. The American garrison consisted of 61 artillerymen under Lieutenant Porter Hanks with seven guns, although only one of these, a 9-pounder, could reach the harbour. There were other weaknesses; the garrison relied for fresh water on a spring outside the fort, and the position was overlooked by a higher ridge less than a mile away. The United States Secretary of War William Eustis, who was apparently preoccupied with financial economies, had sent no communications to Hanks for several months. He sent word of the declaration of war on 18 June to the commanders in the northwest by ordinary rate post. The Postmaster at Cleveland, Ohio realised the importance of the news and hired an express rider to take it to Brigadier General William Hull, who was advancing on Detroit, but it was too late to save both Hull and Hanks from being taken by surprise by the outbreak of hostilities.Elting, p.27 Though he was unaware of events elsewhere, Hanks had heard rumours of unusual activity at St. Joseph Island. He sent a fur trader named Michael Dousman, who held a commission as an officer in the militia, to investigate. Dousman's boat was captured by the advancing British force, and Dousman apparently quickly changed sides. View of British Landing, c. 1898. British forces landed near the settlement on the night of July 16. Having learned from Dousman that the Americans at Mackinac were unaware of the outbreak of war, Robert's force landed at a settlement later named British Landing on the north end of the island, away from the fort, early on the morning of 17 July. They quietly removed the village's inhabitants from their homes, dragged a 6-pounder cannon through the woods to a ridge above the fort and fired a single round before sending a message under a flag of truce, demanding the surrender of the fort. Hanks's force was surprised and was already at a tactical disadvantage. The flag of truce had been accompanied by three of the villagers, who greatly exaggerated the number of Natives in Roberts's force.Elting, p.30 Fearing a massacre by the Natives,Wood, Edwin O. (1918). p.285 Hanks capitulated without a fight. The garrison of the fort was taken prisoner but was released on giving their parole not to fight for the remainder of the war. ==Aftermath== American Brig Gen William Hull abandoned his invasion of Upper Canada and garrisoned at Fort Detroit on August 3, upon learning that the British captured Mackinac. The island's inhabitants were made to swear an oath of allegiance to the United Kingdom or leave within a month. Most took the oath. Roberts arrested three deserters from the British Army and twenty alleged British citizens. There was no looting, although Roberts expropriated the goods in the United States storehouses and a government trading post and purchased several bullocks to feed the Natives. The British abandoned their own fort at St. Joseph Island and concentrated their forces at Mackinac Island. Of the Natives present, the Ottawa contingent had apparently remained aloof from the others. They and most of the Chippewas later dispersed. At least some of the \\"Western Indians\\" (those recruited from Wisconsin and other territories to the west) proceeded south to join the warriors with Tecumseh at Fort Amherstburg. The mere threat of their arrival prompted the American Brigadier General Hull to abandon his invasion of Canadian territory and retreat to Detroit on 3 August.Zaslow, p.17 The news of the loss of Mackinac also prompted several Native communities such as the Wyandots near Detroit, who had been friendly to the Americans or neutral, to rally to the British cause.Hitsman, p.75 Their hostility influenced the U.S. surrender at the Siege of Detroit shortly afterwards. Lieutenant Hanks was killed by a cannon shot at Detroit shortly before the surrender, while awaiting a court martial for cowardice. British control of Fort Mackinac and northern Michigan was not seriously challenged until 1814 when a large American force was dispatched to retake control of the area. However, the American force was defeated in the Battle of Mackinac Island and the Engagements on Lake Huron. ==NotesSources== *Dunnigan, Brian Leigh.

She was the first woman to serve as Mayor of Wellington. She was chairperson of the Greater Wellington Regional Council from 2007 until 2015, and since 2019 she has chaired the board of the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa. ==Early life and career== Wilde was born Frances Helen Kitching on 11 November 1948 in Wellington, New Zealand. She attended St Mary's College and later at Wellington Polytechnic (gaining a diploma in journalism) and Victoria University (graduating with a degree in Political Science). Upon finishing her education Wilde gained employment as a journalist. In 1968, she married Geoffrey Gilbert Wilde, and the couple went on to have three children before divorcing in 1983. She joined the Labour Party in 1972 and was later the editor of the party newsletter, New Nation. She later became the chairperson of the electorate in which she resided and a member of Labour's executive council in the Wellington region. == Political career Member of Parliament and Minister=== Wilde was a Member of Parliament for the seat, winning it from sitting National MP Ken Comber in the 1981 general election. Wilde retained the seat at the subsequent 1984 general election. In 1985, Wilde moved what became the Homosexual Law Reform Act 1986, which legalised homosexual acts in New Zealand between consenting men. The 16-month debate about the bill polarised the country, and sparked violent demonstrations and angry rallies at Parliament. Her other main legislative achievement in Parliament was an Adoption Reform Act, which made it possible for adopted people and their birth-parents to contact each other. Wilde was Labour's junior Parliamentary Whip from 1984 to 1987, before serving as an Associate Minister outside Cabinet in the Foreign Affairs, Housing, Conservation and Pacific Island Affairs portfolios and Minister for Disarmament and Arms Control in the second term of the Fourth Labour Government. When Geoffrey Palmer became Prime Minister, Wilde was promoted into Cabinet and appointed Minister of Tourism alongside her continuing roles as Minister for Disarmament and Arms Control and Associate Minister of External Affairs and Trade. Between 1990–92, in Opposition, she was Labour's spokesperson for Foreign Affairs and Tourism. ===Mayor of Wellington=== Fran Wilde Walk, the accessway to Sky Stadium In 1992 she resigned from Parliament to stand for Mayor of Wellington. Her seat was retained by Labour, with Chris Laidlaw winning the 1992 by-election caused by Wilde's resignation. She won the Mayoralty, and remained in office until 1995 when she chose to retire. During her time as Mayor, Wilde worked to improve Wellington's image and continuing on from the city's strong anti-nuclear sentiments she declared Wellington a Peace Capital in 1993. Wilde also spearheaded initiatives like the planning and construction of the WestpacTrust Stadium which features an elevated accessway to its entrance known as the \\"Fran Wilde Walk\\" which was opened in June 2005. After leaving the mayoralty Wilde was appointed the chair of the Housing New Zealand board and, from 1997 to 2003, chief executive of Trade New Zealand. ===Greater Wellington Regional Council=== Wilde returned to local politics in 2004, successfully contesting a seat on the Wellington Regional Council. It had been suggested that she would retire after a single term; however, Wilde was re-elected to the Regional Council in 2007 and was elected, by her fellow councillors, the chair of the council on 30 October that year. She was returned as both a councillor and the chair in 2010 and 2013. Wilde was a strong proponent of the super city proposal for Wellington. When the Local Government Commission rejected the proposal, Wilde received a letter signed by nine of her fellow councillors asking her to stand down as chair. Wilde stepped down from the chair's position from 30 June 2015, but remained a regional councillor. She was succeeded as chair by Chris Laidlaw and did not stand for re-election in 2016. === District Health Board === Wilde contested and was elected to the Capital and Coast District Health Board in 2016 and was appointed the deputy chair of the board. Wilde did not seek re- election in 2019. == Career after politics == Following her departure from the Regional Council, Wilde was appointed as the Chair of the Remuneration Authority. She has also served as the deputy chair and acting chair of the NZ Transport Agency. Wilde was appointed to the board of the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa in 2015. She became the board's deputy chair in January 2019, and has been its chair since 1 July 2019. Wilde is on the board of Kiwi Can Do, an organisation which helps unemployed New Zealanders get back into work. == Honours == In 1993, Wilde was awarded the New Zealand Suffrage Centennial Medal. Wilde was appointed a Companion of the Queen's Service Order for public services in the 1996 New Year Honours; a Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit in the 2012 New Year Honours for services to local-body affairs and the community; and a Dame Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit in 2017 for services to the State and the community. ==Family== She has three adult children from her first marriage to Geoffrey Wilde. Her husband Christopher Kelly was CEO of Landcorp and a former veterinary surgeon. ==See also== * LGBT rights in New Zealand ==NotesReferences== * * * ==External links== * Fran Wilde, left, in 1987 (photo) * GayNZ.com article on Fran Wilde Category:1948 births Category:Living people Category:Mayors of Wellington Category:New Zealand Labour Party MPs Category:Members of the New Zealand House of Representatives Category:New Zealand MPs for Wellington electorates Category:Women mayors of places in New Zealand Category:Wellington regional councillors Category:Women members of the New Zealand House of Representatives Category:Dames Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit Category:Companions of the Queen's Service Order Category:New Zealand Women of Influence Award recipients Category:Recipients of the New Zealand Suffrage Centennial Medal 1993 Category:People educated at St Mary's College, Wellington Category:People associated with the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa ","title":"Fran Wilde"},{"id":"6207934","text":"Dracula is an 1897 novel by Bram Stoker.

Villin is a 92.5 kDa tissue-specific actin-binding protein associated with the actin core bundle of the brush border. Villin contains multiple gelsolin-like domains capped by a small (8.5 kDa) \\"headpiece\\" at the C-terminus consisting of a fast and independently folding three-helix bundle that is stabilized by hydrophobic interactions. The headpiece domain is a commonly studied protein in molecular dynamics due to its small size and fast folding kinetics and short primary sequence. == Structure == Villin is made up of seven domains, six homologous domains make up the N-terminal core and the remaining domain makes up the C-terminal cap. Villin contains three phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate (PIP2) binding sites, one of which is located at the head piece and the other two in the core. The core domain is approximately 150 amino acid residues grouped in six repeats. On this core is an 87 residue, hydrophobic, C-terminal headpiece The headpiece (HP67) is made up of a compact, 70 amino acid folded protein at the C-terminus. This headpiece contains an F-actin binding domain. Residues K38, E39, K65, 70-73:KKEK, G74, L75 and F76 surround a hydrophobic core and are believed to be involved in the binding of F-actin to villin. Residues E39 and K70 form a salt bridge buried within the headpiece which serves to connect N and C terminals. This salt bridge may also orient and fix the C-terminal residues involved in F-actin binding as in the absence of this salt bridge no binding occurs. A hydrophobic “cap” is formed by residue W64 side chains, which is completely conserved throughout the villin family. Below this cap is a crown of alternative positive and negative charged localities. Villin can undergo post-translational modifications like tyrosine phosphorylation. Villin has the ability to dimerize and the dimerization site is located at the amino end of the protein. == Expression == Villin is an actin binding protein expressed mainly in the brush border of the epithelium in vertebrates but sometimes it is ubiquitously expressed in protists and plants. Villin is found localized in the microvilli of the brush border of the epithelium lining of the gut and renal tubules in vertebrates. == Function == Villin is believed to function in the bundling, nucleation, capping and severing of actin filaments. In vertebrates, the villin proteins help to support the microfilaments of the microvilli of the brush border. However, knockout mice appear to show ultra-structurally normal microvilli reminding us that the function of villin is not definitively known; it may play a role in cell plasticity through F-actin severing. The six-repeat villin core is responsible for Ca2+ actin severing while the headpiece is responsible for actin crosslinking and bundling (Ca independent). Villin is postulated to be the controlling protein for Ca2+ induced actin severing in the brush border. Ca2+ inhibits proteolytic cleavage of the domains of the 6 N-terminal core which inhibits actin severing. In normal mice raising Ca2+ levels induces the severing of actin by villin, whereas in villin knockout mice this activity does not occur in response to heightened Ca2+ levels. In the presence of low concentrations of Ca2+ the villin headpiece functions to bundle actin filaments whereas in the presence of high Ca2+ concentrations the N-terminal caps and severs these filaments. The association of PIP2 with villin inhibits the actin capping and severing action and increases actin binding at the headpiece region, possibly through structural changes in the protein. PIP2 increases actin bundling not only by decreasing the severing action of villin but also through dissociating capping proteins, releasing actin monomers from sequestering proteins and stimulating actin nucleation and cross linking. == Villin subdomain == The C-terminal subdomain of Villin Headpiece VHP67, denoted VHP35, is stabilised in part, by a buried cluster of three phenylalanine residues. Its small size and high helical content are expected to promote rapid folding, and this has been confirmed experimentally. Villin-4 C-terminal construct VHP76 in Arabidopsis thaliana has been shown to exhibit higher affinity for F-actin in increasing concentrations of Ca2+, which further confirms the function of villin. === Structure === It has a simple topology consisting of three α-helices that form a well-packed hydrophobic core. == Degradation and Regulation == Currently, it is theorized the regulation of plant villins are caused by degradation via the binding protein auxin, which targets the headpiece domain (VHP). == See also == * Supervillin == References  Further reading === * == External links == * Category:Proteins ","title":"Villin"},{"id":"6207957","text":"Richard Neale \\"Tuff\\" Hedeman (born March 2, 1963, in El Paso, Texas) is an American former professional bull rider. He won the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association (PRCA) bull riding world championship three times (1986, 1989 and 1991), as well as the 1995 Professional Bull Riders (PBR) world championship. He also won the 1993 world championship for the now-defunct Bull Riders Only (BRO) organization. Hedeman is a ProRodeo Hall of Fame and Bull Riding Hall of Fame inductee. He is also one of the co-founders of the PBR. In 1999, the PBR honored him with the PBR Legends and Heroes Celebration: Ring of Honor. He is known for having been one of rodeo icon Lane Frost's closest friends. Hedeman and the infamous bucking bull Bodacious had a few historic clashes. He later served as the President of the PBR and then the President and Ambassador of Championship Bull Riding (CBR). In 2018, he formed his own bull riding organization: the Tuff Hedeman Bull Riding Tour (THBRT). ==Professional career== Hedeman won many junior rodeos in his youth. In 1980, he won the high school rodeo bull riding and All Around titles in New Mexico. He won the team roping title and All Around designation again in 1981. After high school, he attended Sul Ross State University in Alpine, Texas. At Sul Ross, he was a member of the rodeo team, competing in bronc riding, team roping, steer wrestling, and bull riding. Hedeman filled his PRCA permit at a single rodeo in 1983 as a bronc rider. He was known for riding bulls that often had not been ridden. He often traveled with fellow bull riders and close friends Lane Frost, Cody Lambert, Jim Sharp, Clint Branger, and Ty Murray to save travel expenses. He married Tracy Stepp in May 1986. He qualified for eleven National Finals Rodeos (NFRs). By 1993, he had surpassed $1 million in career earnings and won the 1986, 1989, and 1991 world titles in the PRCA. A neck injury at the NFR in 1993 kept him out of the arena for the entire year of 1994. In 1994, he was portrayed by actor Stephen Baldwin in the Hollywood feature film 8 Seconds about the life of Lane Frost. He was actually a stunt double for Baldwin. Hedeman was instrumental in starting the Professional Bull Riders. In 1995, he won the PBR World Championship despite an encounter with Bodacious that resulted in numerous broken bones in his face. From 1993 to 1995, Bodacious had been out of competition for long periods due to an injury; however, he returned as a more dangerous animal, having developed a new bucking move \\"involving him bringing his rear up with his head to the ground, luring a rider to shift his weight forward, and then thrusting his head up full force, to smash the rider in the face\\". He was jerked down by Bodacious upon exiting the chutes, so the bull could thrust his head up and smash Hedeman’s face, shattering every major facial bone. Hedeman managed to walk out of the arena, but required several hours of reconstructive surgery for his face. He spent less than two months recuperating, and at the NFR later that year, he drew Bodacious again — this time, in round 7. At the request of his son, he decided to turn him out – getting off him when he left the chute – and received a standing ovation. Hedeman barely missed winning the PBR world title in 1996, losing to Owen Washburn as he came in second. He then finished third in the world during the 1997 PBR season. His last ride was at the PBR Bud Light Cup Series event in Odessa, Texas, in 1998, when he landed on his head after getting thrown off and herniated a disc in his previously injured neck. After some consideration, he officially retired in 1999. He was leading the PBR World Standings in 1998 at the time of his injury. Hedeman is one of the estimated seven to ten riders to have ever ridden Bodacious for the qualified 8 seconds, with the stand-out ride being a 95-point ride at the 1993 Bull Riders Only (BRO) World Finals in Long Beach, California. ==End of career, retirement, and after== After having been President for CBR, Hedeman then served as ambassador after abruptly leaving the PBR in 2004 for undisclosed reasons. He served as president of the PBR from 1992 to 2004, then as president of CBR from 2005 to 2011. He remained with CBR as ambassador and chute-boss from 2011 to early 2018. In early 2018, Hedeman left CBR (which folded later that same year) to start his own organization: the Tuff Hedeman Bull Riding Tour (THBRT). == Personal life == Hedeman lives on a ranch in Morgan Mill, Texas, outside of Fort Worth. His oldest son, Lane, is named after Lane Frost; his younger sons are Trevor and Ryker. Hedeman also added color commentary for both PBR and CBR event broadcasts on television when he was involved with those organizations. He spends his free time traveling to bull riding and team roping events. === Awards === * 1986, 89, 91 PRCA World Bull Riding Champion * 1987, '89 NFR Average Champion * 1993 First $1,000,000 Bull Rider * 1995 PBR Touring Pro Division Champion * 1995 PBR World Champion Bull Rider === Honors === * 1988 Cowboy Capital Walk of Fame * 1997 ProRodeo Hall of Fame * 1997 El Paso Athletic Hall of Fame * 1999 PBR Heroes & Legends Celebration: Ring of Honor * 2002 Texas Cowboy Hall of Fame * 2003 Cheyenne Frontier Days Hall of Fame * 2010 Texas Rodeo Cowboy Hall of Fame * 2016 Bull Riding Hall of Fame * 2017 Molalla Walk of Fame ==References * Tuff Hedeman Bull Riding Tour * Tuff Hedeman TV Category:1963 births Category:Living people Category:People from El Paso, Texas Category:People from Fort Worth, Texas Category:Ranchers from Texas Category:Sul Ross State University alumni Category:Bull riders Category:ProRodeo Hall of Fame inductees Category:Sportspeople from Texas Category:Professional Bull Riders: Heroes and Legends ","title":"Tuff Hedeman"},{"id":"6207963","text":"George Francis \\"Doc\\" Medich (born December 9, 1948), is a former professional baseball player who pitched in the Major Leagues from 1972–1982. He was a medical student at the University of Pittsburgh, and acquired the nickname \\"Doc\\" during his early baseball career. ==Early years== While in college, Medich (of serbian descent) pitched for the Pitt baseball team and played tight end on the Pittsburgh Panthers football team. ==Professional careerDraft and minors=== Medich was drafted by the New York Yankees in the 30th round of the 1970 Major League Baseball draft, and spent three seasons as a starting pitcher in their farm system, going 21-13 over that span with a 2.27 ERA. ===New York Yankees=== Medich received a call to the majors in September , facing four batters in his major league debut, giving up two singles and two walks. From there, Medich improved substantially, as he went 14-9 with a 2.95 ERA in to finish third in American League Rookie of the Year balloting. He was also the last Yankee winning pitcher at the original Yankee Stadium, pitching a shutout on September 29, 1973 against the Detroit Tigers. In , Medich won a career high 19 games for the Yankees, tied with teammate Pat Dobson for most wins on the team. Following a season in which he went 16-16 with a 3.50 ERA, the Yankees sent Medich to the Pittsburgh Pirates for Willie Randolph, Dock Ellis and Ken Brett on December 11, 1975.Durso, Joseph. \\"Yanks Send Bonds to Angels for Pair And Medich to Pirates for 3 Players,\\" The New York Times, Friday, December 12, 1975.

He threatened to retire, but later joined the A's, and went 10-6 with a 4.69 ERA. As he was slated to become a free agent at the end of the season, A's owner Charlie Finley attempted to sign Medich to an extension. Unsuccessful, he sold Medich's contract to the expansion Seattle Mariners in September. He was 2-0 with a 3.63 ERA in three starts for the Mariners before being placed on waivers, and selected by the New York Mets. He made one start for the Mets, losing to the Pirates.  Medich signed as a Free Agent with the Texas Rangers following the season, going 9-8 with a 3.74 ERA his first season with the club. His best season was the strike shortened season in which he went 10-6 with a 3.08 ERA, and tied for the AL lead with four shutouts with Richard Dotson, Ken Forsch, and Steve McCatty. In five seasons with the club, Medich went 50-43 with a 3.95 ERA. ===Milwaukee Brewers=== With the Rangers languishing in sixth place in the American League West, Medich's contract was sold to the Milwaukee Brewers, who were in first place in the American League East, on August 11, . On August 27, Rickey Henderson broke Lou Brock's record for most stolen bases in one season against the Brewers with Medich on the mound.Baseball's Top 100: The Game's Greatest Records, p.52, Kerry Banks, 2010, Greystone Books, Vancouver, BC, Medich reached the post-season for the only time in his career as a member of the Brewers. His only post-season appearance came in game six of the 1982 World Series. Already down 7-0 to the St. Louis Cardinals, Medich entered in the sixth inning, and gave up six runs (four earned) in two innings of work. ==Medical career== Twice during his baseball career, Medich went into the stands during a game to aid a fan who was suffering a heart attack. In 1976 in Philadelphia, he performed CPR and mouth-to-mouth resuscitation on a fan who died later that day. In a game on July 17, 1978, between the Texas Rangers and the Baltimore Orioles, he revived a man who was suffering a heart attack.Klingaman, Mike. \\"This Week in Sports\\", Baltimore Sun, July 18, 2016, page 2-Sports. The man survived and lived several more years. Shortly after receiving an M.D. degree from the University of Pittsburgh, Medich had his medical license suspended in Pennsylvania in 2002 due to a \\"guilty plea to twelve counts of knowingly or intentionally possessing a controlled substance obtained through prescriptions written to nonexistent patients and to people who never received the drugs.\\" Medich's license remains suspended and the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons voted to expel Medich.(Source: AAOS Bulletin – August 2006 – http://www2.aaos.org/bulletin/aug06/fline14.asp) ==References * Category:1948 births Category:Living people Category:New York Yankees players Category:Pittsburgh Pirates players Category:Oakland Athletics players Category:Seattle Mariners players Category:New York Mets players Category:Texas Rangers players Category:Milwaukee Brewers players Category:Baseball players from Pennsylvania Category:Major League Baseball pitchers Category:Pittsburgh Panthers baseball players Category:Pittsburgh Panthers football players Category:Oneonta Yankees players Category:Kinston Eagles players Category:West Haven Yankees players Category:Manchester Yankees players Category:American people of Serbian descent Category:People from Aliquippa, Pennsylvania Category:Players of American football from Pennsylvania ","title":"Doc Medich"},{"id":"6207984","text":"The Lycée français international de Pondichéry is an international French school in Pondicherry, Puducherry, India.

He is a Republican former member of the Louisiana State Senate for District 33 (Claiborne, Morehouse, Union, and West Carroll parishes), all of which border Arkansas in the northeastern section of his state. In an interview published on January 1, 2008, Barham listed his major LDWF issues would be coastal restoration and controlling invasive aquatic vegetation in lakes and waterways: \\"We'll be on the front lines of coastal restoration. It's a huge project. It's going to have an impact on fisheries, oyster leases, the environment — but we have no choice. We have to do it.\\" Though he left Wildlife and Fisheries in January 2016, Barham has returned to employment by state government. Later in the same month, he was named director of state parks and historic sites under new Lieutenant Governor Billy Nungesser, a friend with whom Barham worked in the aftermath of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill of 2010. ==Background== Barham was born in Monroe to Erle McKoin \\"Ninety\\" Barham (1916–1976) and Rosalie Smith Barham (1913–1999). He grew up on the family plantation in Oak Ridge in Morehouse Parish along with older brother, the late Erle Edwards Barham, who held this same Senate seat as a Republican from 1976 to 1980. Edwards Barham was the first Republican elected to the Louisiana Senate since Reconstruction. Edwards and Robert Barham were cousins of the late Democratic State Senator Charles C. Barham, who represented an adjoining district based about Ruston from 1964 to 1972 and again from 1976 to 1988.\\"Senate to consider honor for Barham\\", Baton Rouge Morning Advocate, May 5, 2010 Barham graduated from Oak Ridge High School. He received a bachelor's degree from Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge. In 1970, he entered the United States Army for a two-year stint as a medic in South Vietnam. In 1999, he became a colonel in the Louisiana National Guard. Barham also obtained a master's degree from the University of Louisiana at Monroe (then Northeast Louisiana State University). In 1994, he completed the \\"Agricultural Leadership Program\\" at LSU. He began full-time farming, Robert Barham Farms, Inc., in Oak Ridge in 1972. Barham and his wife, the former Melba Pipes (born 1954), have three children, Robert Erle, Rebecca, and Henry. His son, Robert Erle, is on faculty at Covenant College as an English professor.http://www.covenant.edu/news/08.16.12 ==Environmental interest== As LDWF secretary, Barham succeeded Bryant Hammett, a Democrat from Ferriday, who served as a state representative from 1992 to 2006. Hammett had been named to the position late in 2006 by then Governor Kathleen Blanco. When Barham was a boy, his father organized a group of Morehouse Parish landowners who established the Cooley Wildlife Refuge, which became the biggest bird- banding site in Louisiana. Barham fished, hunted, and explored the rivers, streams, lakes and woods of northeastern Louisiana as a teenager and later the entire state as an adult. Leslie Glasgow, the assistant United States Secretary of the Interior in the administration of U. S. President Richard M. Nixon, chose young Barham to work at Glacier National Park in northernmost Montana. Earlier, Glasgow had been a reform director of the Louisiana Wildlife and Fisheries Commission (1966–1968) and a biology professor at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge. Barham told the Monroe News-Star that his experience at Glacier park was \\"amazing. I was mentored by people like my dad and (Glasgow), who knew the importance of our natural resources. Louisiana has of Wildlife Management Areas. Another early mentor of Barham was Grits Gresham, the sports journalist who once hosted ABC's The American Sportsman and was a long-time advocate of saving the Louisiana wetlands.Philip Timothy, Death of Grits Gresham\\", Alexandria Town Talk, February 19, 2008 Barham received the 2009 Outstanding Legislator of the Year Award from the Louisiana Wildlife Federation and the 1999 National Award for Conservation of Natural Resources from the Daughters of the American Revolution. He received the John D. Newsom Award for Wildlife Stewardship. At the conclusion of his last regular legislative session in 2007, Barham told an interviewer that Louisiana should concentrate on anti-litter efforts and highway construction. He lamented that his state is one of the most littered in the nation and urged a public education and law enforcement angle to tackle the problem. He also said that the state should pave the first mile of each highway connecting to Arkansas, Mississippi, and Texas to the highest grade possible so as to give travelers coming into Louisiana a favorable first impression. In 2016, Barham was succeeded as wildlife and fisheries secretary by Charlie Melancon, a former member of the United States House of Representatives for Louisiana's 3rd congressional district, who has been selected by incoming Democratic Governor John Bel Edwards. Coincidentally, Melancon lost the 2010 U.S. Senate race to Republican David Vitter, who was defeated for governor in the runoff election held on November 21, 2015, by Edwards. In April 2017, in testimony before a House committee, Barham, as state parks director, termed Louisiana \\"the trashiest state in the nation. We should hang our heads in shame when Arkansas and Mississippi are cleaner than Louisiana,\\" Barham said. Subsequently, state Representative Stuart Bishop of Lafayette introduced legislation, approved by the House Education Committee, to require public schools to add litter prevention and awareness instruction for pupils in kindergarten to fifth grade. \\"I grew up on Bayou Teche, and it's filthy; I live half a mile from the Vermilion River, and it's filthy. It's a travesty what we are doing to our state. I'm tired of seeing cans and bottles floating down our bayous,\\" Bishop said in plugging for his bill. ==Barham in municipal and state politics== Barham was elected mayor of Oak Ridge in 1983 and served until 1988, when he became a village council member instead. He vacated the municipal post when he took his state Senate seat late in 1994. His affiliations include Ducks Unlimited, the American Farm Bureau Federation, the National Rifle Association, Louisiana Cotton Producers, and the American Legion. He is a member of the Masonic lodge and a Shriner. Barham is a Baptist. Barham was first elected as a Democrat in a special election for an unexpired state Senate term held on November 8, 1994, a heavily Republican election year nationally. He defeated then fellow Democrat Johnny Dollar, 13,932 votes to 10,765. He was reelected with 93 percent of the vote in the fall of 1995 for a full four-year term and was unopposed in 1999. Thereafter, he switched parties and ran in 2002 as a Republican for the vacant Fifth District U.S. House seat. He was unopposed again for the state Senate in 2003. Barham was term-limited and was ineligible to have sought reelection to the Senate in 2007. As a lawmaker, Barham was particularly identified with efforts to halt the dissolution of Louisiana's coastal wetlands. He and other members of his family are known as strong conservationists. His father helped to establish the Tensas Wildlife Refuge near Delhi in Richland Parish. ==The congressional race of 2002== In 2002, Barham was an unsuccessful Republican candidate for the United States House of Representatives for Louisiana's 5th congressional district, a position won by Rodney Alexander, a state representative from Jackson Parish, who in 2004 switched to Republican affiliation and remained in Congress until his retirement in 2013. Among Barham's congressional campaign donors were later State Representative Frank A. Hoffmann and former state Senator Billy Boles, both of Monroe, the Alexandria timberman Roy O. Martin, Jr., the Bastrop architect Hugh G. Parker, Jr., and the Lamar Advertising Company executive and former legislator Kevin P. Reilly, Sr., of Baton Rouge, Mike Walsworth, the Republican District 15 state representative from West Monroe, was elected to succeed Barham in the state Senate in the nonpartisan blanket primary held on October 20, 2007; he defeated the outgoing Democratic representative from District 14, Charles R. McDonald of Bastrop. In the congressional primary, Barham had sought to succeed U.S. Representative John Cooksey of Monroe, who made an ill-fated run in 2002 for the U.S. Senate against Mary Landrieu. Barham entered the primary against two other major Republican candidates, former U.S. Representative Clyde C. Holloway of Louisiana's 8th congressional district, since disbanded, a businessman from Forest Hill in Rapides Parish, and Lee Fletcher, a young Monroe businessman who had been Cooksey's former chief of staff. Barham ran fourth in the primary, with 34,522 votes (19 percent), a relatively strong showing in a multi-candidate field. ==See also== * List of American politicians who switched parties in office ==References== Category:1949 births Category:Living people Category:Politicians from Monroe, Louisiana Category:People from Morehouse Parish, Louisiana Category:Louisiana Democrats Category:Louisiana Republicans Category:Farmers from Louisiana Category:American army personnel of the Vietnam War Category:United States Army officers Category:Baptists from Louisiana Category:Louisiana state senators Category:State cabinet secretaries of Louisiana Category:Mayors of places in Louisiana Category:Louisiana city council members Category:Louisiana State University alumni Category:University of Louisiana at Monroe alumni Category:American conservationists ","title":"Robert J.

H. Talbot. \\"Hodoeporicon of Saint Willibald.\\" Soldiers of Christ : Saints and Saint's Lives from Late Antiquity and the Early Middle Ages. Ed. Thomas F. Noble and Thomas Head.

Willibald's father was Saint Richard the Pilgrim, and his mother Saint Wuna of Wessex. His brother was Saint Winibald and his sister was Saint Walburga.Bunson, Matthew, Margaret Bunson, and Stephen Bunson, comps. \\"Willibald (c. 700–786).\\" Our Sunday Visitor's Encyclopedia of Saints.

His shrine is at the Eichstätt Cathedral in Germany, where his body and relics from his journeys are preserved. His feast day is the 7th of July. ==Early life== Willibald was born in Wessex on 21 October around the year 700. His mother, Saint Wuna of Wessex, was reportedly a sister of Saint Boniface. His father, Saint Richard the Pilgrim, was a chieftain of Wessex. At the age of three, Willibald suffered from a violent illness. His parents prayed to God, vowing to commit Willibald to a monastic life if he was to be spared. Willibald survived and at the age of five entered the Benedictine monastery at Waldheim) and was educated by Abbot Egwald.Mershman, Francis. \\"Sts. Willibald and Winnebald.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 15. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 24 Apr. 2019 At the monastery he became accustomed to the Irish and Anglo-Saxon monastic ideal of peregrinatio religiosa, or pious rootlessness.Maier, Konstantin, \\"Willibald\\", in: Religion in Geschichte und Gegenwart. Consulted online on 01 September 2018 ==Travels== In 721 Willibald set out on a pilgrimage to Rome with his father and brother. After departing by ship the group arrived in Rouen, France visiting shrines and spending much of their time in prayer. Eventually they arrived in Lucca, a city in northern Italy. It was here that Willibald’s father became gravely ill and died. After burying their father Willibald and Winibald continued on their journey, travelling through Italy until they reached Rome. Here they visited the Lateran Basilica and St. Peter's. They spent some time in Italy, strengthening in devotion and discipline, but soon the two brothers became ill with the Black Plague (although Mershman says it was malaria). Hunebrec recounts the disease and miraculous recovery: > Then with the passing of the days and the increasing heat of the summer, > which is usually a sign of future fever, they were struck down with > sickness. They found it difficult to breathe, fever set in, and at one > moment they were shivering with cold the next burning with heat. They had > caught the black plague.

Willibald left Rome in 724, heading for Naples. From there, accompanied by two unnamed companions and brother, he departed by sea, visited Sicily and Greece along the way, and eventually arrived in Asia Minor. Winnebald had, after the departure of his brother for Palestine, lived in a monastery at Rome. ===Greece, Asia Minor, Cyprus and Syria=== In Asia Minor Willibald and his companions first arrived in the city of Ephesus. Here they visited the tomb of Saint John the Evangelist. They then continued on to Patara in Lycia, where they waited out the winter, and then travelled to Mount Chelidonium, almost dying of hunger and thirst as they attempted to cross. They departed by boat and arrived on the island of Cyprus. Following a stay in Cyprus they reached Antadoros (now called Tartus) where they had an audience with a Greek bishop and visited the church of Saint John the Baptist. ===Holy Land=== Willibald's journey then took him and a group of seven companions to Palestine (c. 723/24 - 726/27). There he visited Nazareth. From Nazareth he went to Bethlehem, and thence into Egypt. He returned to Nazareth, and thence travelled to Cana, Capharnaum, and Jerusalem, Butler, Alban. “Saint Willibald, Bishop of Aichstadt, Confessor”. Lives of the Fathers, Martyrs, and Principal Saints, 1866. CatholicSaints.Info. 3 July 2013 where he arrived on 11 November, 725. The pilgrimage continued to Bethlehem and the Church of the Nativity, Thecua, the Great Lavra of St Sabbas, the church at the spot where Philip the Evangelist baptised the Ethiopian eunuch, the port city of Gaza, Hebron, Saint George's hometown of Lydda, Joppa, Tyre and Sidon, Sebaste and other places in Samaria, Ptolemais, and again reached Tyre by way of the Ladder of Tyre. ===Return voyage=== After waiting for some time in Tyre, Willibald was able to sail to Constantinople. He remained in Constantinople for some two years (c. 726/27–729) and was provided with a small room in an annex of the Church of the Holy Apostles. He spent part of this time in Nicaea, visiting a church and studying documents from the First Council of Nicaea that was arranged by Emperor Constantine. He left Constantinople and sailed for Sicily arriving in Naples approximately seven years after he had left Italy. ==Monte Cassino== Willibald and his remaining companion, Tidbercht, joined the Benedictine community at Monte Cassino. Here Willibald taught the community about his travels. He would spend over ten years (c. 729–739) at Monte Cassino and another local Benedictine monastery where he served roles as, \\"sacrist, dean, and porter.\\"Bunson 858. According to David Farmer, his new-found monasticism was drastically shaped by his experiences in both England and Palestine, allowing him to play a major role in the reformation and future prosperity of the monastery.Farmer, David H., ed. \\"Willibald (Willebald) (d. 786/7).\\" The Oxford Dictionary of Saints. 2nd ed. 1987. It happened that in 738 Saint Boniface, coming to Rome, asked of Pope Gregory III that Willibald might be sent to assist him in his missions in Germany. The pope desired to see the monk, and was much delighted with the history of his travels, and acquainted him of Boniface’s request. ==Eichstätt, ordination, and missionary work== The Willibaldsburg above Eichstätt Upon arriving at Eichstätt, he was ordained a priest by Boniface on 22 July, 741 and asked to begin missionary work in the area. A year later, Boniface summoned him to Thuringia. While travelling, Willibald encountered his brother, Winibald, whom he had not seen for over eight years. Shortly thereafter he returned to Eichstätt to begin his work. In 742 he and Winibald founded the double monastery of Heidenheim. Winibald served as the first abbot. Following his death, Willibald's sister, Saint Walburga, was appointed the first abbess of the monastery.Watkins, OSB, Dom B., ed. \\"Willibald, St.\\" The Book of Saints: A Comprehensive Biographical Dictionary.

According to Bunson, Eichstätt was the site of Willibald's most successful missionary efforts, although specific details like the means of conversion and number of converts are not known. The monastery was one of the first buildings in the region and served as an important centre, \\"not only for the diocesan apostolate, but also for the diffusion and development of monasticism.\\"Farmer 440.

A member of the Democratic Party, he previously served as the Minority Whip in the Ohio House of Representatives. The district includes the western four-fifths of Cincinnati, as well as suburbs north and west of the city in Hamilton and Butler counties. He was formerly a four-term member of the Ohio House of Representatives, representing the 31st District from 2001 to 2009. His Ohio State House district included western Cincinnati and all of Addyston, Cheviot, Cleves and North Bend, Ohio. ==Early life, education and career== Driehaus (January 21, 2008) Driehaus, a 1984 graduate and class president of Elder High School in Cincinnati, studied political science at Miami University while earning a B.A. in 1988 and holds a Master of Public Administration (MPA) from Indiana University Bloomington earned in 1995. He served as a Peace Corps volunteer in Senegal where he worked with village groups and local schools as a natural resource volunteer to promote sustainable environmental practices from 1988-90. Driehaus then served as Associate Director of the Center for International Education and Development Assistance at Indiana University. While serving in this role, he coordinated the South African Internship Program, which was sponsored by the United States Information Agency that is the largest professional exchange program between the United States and South Africa. He formerly directed and served as consultant to the Community Building Institute, a collaborative effort of Xavier University and United Way & Community Chest that promotes citizen-led, asset-based community development. He is a member of the Price Hill Civic Club and serves on the Board of Seton High School. He was a part-time political science instructor at Xavier University. He began his political career as an aide for Cincinnati City Council Member Todd Portune and former U.S. Rep. Charlie Luken in the 1990s. ==Ohio House of Representatives== Driehaus (July 21, 2008) Driehaus served four consecutive terms. He served as Minority Whip of the Ohio House of Representatives from the beginning of his third term in January 2005 until he resigned from the position to be replaced by Fred Strahorn in December 2007 due to his campaign. Driehaus took a leadership role on issues such as election law and redistricting reform. He took issue with information privacy in the state. ==U.S. House of RepresentativesCommittee assignments=== * Committee on Financial ServicesHouse Financial Services Committee: Committee Members Retrieved April 21, 2009 ** Subcommittee on Housing and Community Opportunity ** Subcommittee on International Monetary Policy and Trade ** Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations * Committee on Oversight and Government ReformMembers of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform Retrieved April 21, 2009 ** Subcommittee on Information Policy, Census, and National Archives ** Subcommittee on National Security and Foreign Affairs Driehaus has been a highly regarded politician. The Cincinnati Enquirer named him legislative \\"Rookie of the Year\\" during his first term. In 2008, the ARC of Ohio and the Ohio Association of Election Officials named him Democratic Legislator of the Year. He had a reputation as an anti-abortion fiscal conservative. ==Political campaignsOhio House campaigns=== In 2000, Driehaus ran for the Ohio House of Representatives from the 33rd district, which at the time included Delhi Township, Price Hill, Sayler Park and other parts of western Hamilton County. The incumbent, Jerome Luebbers, had surrendered his seat due to term limits. In the 2002 redistricting, Driehaus' district became the 31st district and surrendered many Republican constituents. Driehaus has served the 31st Ohio House of Representatives district, which has included wards 19–22, 25 & 26 of Cincinnati as well as Cheviot, Cleves, North Bend, and Addyston since the 2002 redistricting. This district is fully contained within Ohio's 1st congressional district. It is also (along with districts 32 and 33) part of Ohio Senate district 9, which encompasses the south central portion of Hamilton County. Driehaus did not have an opponent in any of his Democratic primaries, and he earned at least 57% shares of the vote in each of his general elections for state legislature. === 2006 elections === Driehaus during third term in the Ohio House (October 11, 2005) Driehaus had been the choice of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) to run in Ohio's 1st congressional district for the 2006 United States House of Representatives elections, but he decided to run for re-election in his Ohio House of Representatives seat. He had been elected as the Minority Whip of the Ohio House of Representatives, replacing Dale Miller for the beginning of the 2005 session, in a November 2004 vote after being reelected to his third term. Driehaus survived his own challenge from Scott Gehring with a 2:1 victory margin in the 2006 election for his state house seat. Driehaus campaigning in 2008 Based on the 2000 and 2004 United States Presidential election the district has voted 1% more Republican than the nation as a whole. The district is regarded as a Democratically shifting maturing suburban district that is expected to vote more city-like as it becomes more dense. The district was one of four Republican Ohio congressional seats that the party had targeted for takeover, but Chabot held off Cincinnati Councilman John Cranley by a 52% to 48% margin and the Republicans held on to three of the four seats. === 2008 congressional campaign === Driehaus outside Great American Ball Park on day of League of Conservation Voters endorsement (July 21, 2008) Although Driehaus passed on the 2006 race, he began planning a run for the district in 2008 almost as soon as the 2006 election cycle ended. This was largely because he was barred from running for a fifth term in the state house. Ohio's 1st district was very high on the target list for the Democrats in both 2006 and 2008. Seven-term Republican incumbent Steve Chabot, elected in the Republican wave of 1994, had won the district consistently, but with varying margins. He had won the seat with less than 55% of the vote in four of his seven previous victories. Driehaus at IUPAT Obama-Biden rally in Cincinnati, Ohio (October 24, 2008) In previous elections, the 1st congressional district was hotly contested. It narrowly favored Democratic Ohio Governor Ted Strickland and United States Senator Sherrod Brown in 2006; and United States President George W. Bush narrowly outpaced Democratic nominee John Kerry by just 1 percentage point in the 2004 United States presidential election. Driehaus was recruited for the race by Democratic party officials, and he received early contributions for this race from Nancy Pelosi, Steny H. Hoyer, James E. Clyburn, and Chris Van Hollen, that were included in his 2007 second quarter financial filings. From the time of the first official announcement on May 3, 2007 and first financial filing deadline on July 15, 2007, the race has been closely watched in the national media, and Time described it as one of the 15 Congressional races to watch in the 2008 election. The DCCC has named the district's race as one of the thirteen that it is supporting in hopes of ousting a Republican incumbent in the 2008 United States House of Representatives elections. In the midst of the financial crisis of 2007–2010, especially the subprime mortgage crisis, one of the issues in the race has been the candidates stances on foreclosures. The race was considered to be close. As of October 14, 2008 (three weeks before election day), The Rothenberg Political Report considered the race to be a toss-up. A poll by Survey USA indicated that African-American turnout would probably determine who won the race.Survey USA poll of Ohio's 1st district, released September 22, 2008 Although a marginally Republican district, 27 percent of the district's voters are African-American — one of the highest percentages for a Republican-held district in the 109th Congress. The district includes nearly all of Cincinnati's African-American voters. In the November 4 election, Driehaus defeated incumbent Chabot with 52 percent of the vote, largely on the strength of a 16,000-vote margin in Hamilton County. Barack Obama carried the district with 55 percent of the vote. ===2010 congressional campaign=== Driehaus was challenged by Republican nominee and his predecessor, former U.S. Congressman Steve Chabot, as well as Libertarian nominee James Berns, and Green Party nominee Richard Stevenson. As Chabot was ahead in public opinion polls, the DCCC pulled its financial support for TV ads from the Driehaus campaign, indicating to NBC pundit Chuck Todd that they expected Driehaus to be defeated, which he was, 52% to 45%. In October 2012 Driehaus filed a criminal complaint against the Susan B. Anthony List claiming the organization violated Ohio law against making false statements in a campaign advertisement. He later asked that the complaint be dropped. Driehaus later sued the List, claiming the group caused his \\"loss of livelihood\\" by \\"defaming\\" him by saying he supported taxpayer funded abortion due to his vote for the Affordable Care Act.\\"Rep. Driehaus files defamation lawsuit over SBA List's abortion funding claims\\", catholicnewsagency.com; accessed April 21, 2014. The case was decided in favor of the Susan B.

This follows on his prior African Peace Corps experience as a volunteer. His wife and three children moved along with him. On June 29, 2011, he completed his staff training and was sworn in for service. ==Personal== Driehaus was raised in Green Township by H. Donald and Clare Driehaus, along with his seven siblings. He lives with his wife, Lucienne, and their, in Price Hill, Cincinnati. They are congregants at St. Teresa of Avila parish. His father, Don Driehaus, is a former Hamilton County Democratic Party co-chairman. He was succeeded in the Ohio House of Representatives by his sister Denise. Their father died on September 21, 2008, aged 75. In 2018, Driehaus launched GoodGovernmentGroup, a consulting firm based in Cincinnati. ==References External links == * Steve Driehaus for Congress official campaign site * Category:1966 births Category:Living people Category:Indiana University Bloomington alumni Category:Members of the Ohio House of Representatives Category:Miami University alumni Category:Peace Corps volunteers Category:Politicians from Cincinnati Category:Members of the United States House of Representatives from Ohio Category:Ohio Democrats Category:Democratic Party members of the United States House of Representatives Category:American expatriates in Senegal Category:21st-century American politicians Category:Elder High School alumni ","title":"Steve Driehaus"},{"id":"6208092","text":"Steven Earl McCatty (born March 20, 1954) is an American former professional baseball pitcher who played for the Oakland Athletics of Major League Baseball (MLB) from 1977 to 1985. He graduated from Troy High School in Troy, Michigan, in 1972. He coached the Washington Nationals from 2009 through 2015. ==Baseball careerPlaying career=== On August 10, 1980, McCatty pitched a 14-inning game against the Seattle Mariners, only to lose 2-1\\\\. During the 1981 strike-shortened season, McCatty finished the season with a 2.33 ERA, second in the American League to Sammy Stewart's 2.32 mark and was tied with three others for most wins with 14, including four shutouts, the last two of which were consecutive starts for McCatty. He also finished second for the Cy Young Award, behind Rollie Fingers. However, McCatty would never even approach his 1981 form again. A number of baseball historians and statisticians blame this on manager Billy Martin overworking McCatty and the other members of the 1981 staff. In 2006, Rob Neyer estimated that McCatty threw 131 pitches per complete game in 1981, a heavy workload for a young pitcher even then. However, McCatty never blamed Martin for his post-1981 decline. During a 1982 exhibition game against the San Diego Padres, McCatty stepped to the plate wielding a toy 15-inch bat but umpire Jim Quick would not allow him to hit. McCatty did this on orders from Martin, who was furious that the designated hitter rule was not allowed in National League ballparks, to use the toy bat as a protest. ===Coaching career=== After retiring as a player in 1986, McCatty remained in professional baseball working in radio and TV for the Oakland A's and with ESPN Major League Baseball. McCatty later moved on to coach several minor league baseball clubs, and was hired as pitching coach by the Detroit Tigers for the 2002 season. He subsequently coached for the Ottawa Lynx when it was the AAA affiliate of the Baltimore Orioles. During the offseason, McCatty works with youngsters of all ages to teach pitching mechanics at Jason Thompson Baseball in Auburn Hills, Michigan. In 2009, McCatty became the second pitching coach in Washington Nationals franchise history, replacing Randy St. Claire, who was fired, and McCatty was called upon to replace him after working at the Nationals' AAA affiliate. The Nationals fired McCatty and the entire coaching staff after the 2015 season.http://espn.go.com/mlb/story/_/id/13814518/washington-nationals-fire- manager-matt-williams ==References *Retrosheet Category:1954 births Category:Living people Category:American expatriate baseball players in Canada Category:American League wins champions Category:Baseball coaches from Michigan Category:Baseball players from Michigan Category:Buffalo Bisons (minor league) players Category:Chattanooga Lookouts players Category:Detroit Tigers coaches Category:Fort Myers Sun Sox players Category:Lewiston Broncs players Category:Major League Baseball broadcasters Category:Major League Baseball pitchers Category:Major League Baseball pitching coaches Category:Modesto A's players Category:Minor league baseball coaches Category:Oakland Athletics broadcasters Category:Oakland Athletics players Category:Ogden A's players Category:People from Troy, Michigan Category:San Jose Bees players Category:San Jose Missions players Category:Sportspeople from Detroit Category:Tucson Toros players Category:Vancouver Canadians players ","title":"Steve McCatty"},{"id":"6208108","text":"Ramón Eusebio Castro Ruz (14 October 1924 – 23 February 2016) was a Cuban revolutionary and activist. He was the eldest brother of Fidel and Raúl Castro and a key figure of the Cuban Revolution. ==Biography== Ramón, the eldest of the Castro brothers, the son of Ángel Castro, a Spanish-born rancher, and his second wife, Lina Ruz, grew up in the slums of Havana with his brothers. \\"Physically, he is stunningly like his brother Fidel, an enormous, heavy-set, gruff bear of a man, with a scraggly beard, a red face, a blustery manner, a ready teasing smile and bright dancing eyes,\\" wrote American journalist, Sally Quinn, who in 1977 was rare in being offered a unique opportunity to do an interview in Cuba. Habaneros and tourists alike would confuse Ramón for his brother Fidel, as they passed in the streets of Havana. He would declare \\"No, soy Mongo\\" using a childhood nickname that only his friends and family would know. Although not active in the armed rebellion like his brothers, Ramón Castro aided in the revolution as the quartermaster for the troops of Fidel and Raúl, sending them weapons and supplies. He also established and maintained pipelines from the cities to the troops in the field. He also manufactured an alcohol-based fuel for Cuba during a gasoline shortage. He later said he led a network of 1,200 men: \\"All of them were thieves. We stole things for the war.\\" After the revolution, the family farm that employed 400 people and produced sugar cane, oranges, cattle and lumber, along with its core 26 buildings became legal property of the state. He was allowed to retain . He was occasionally at odds with the new government. In November 1959, after Fidel denounced the newspaper Prensa Libre for opposing the revolution, Ramón came to the newspaper's defense. The government's official newspaper then denounced Ramón in an editorial on its front page that said he had not joined the insurgents alongside his brothers in the 1950s because of his \\"lack of courage and the permanent desire to make money\\". A year later he was attacked for his role in the Cuba Cane Growers Association, an organization that had been dissolved for its association with U.S. interests before the revolution and a lack of enthusiasm for the revolution after it succeeded. Before that season's harvest concluded, he called for raising wage rates for 200,000 laborers on private sugar cane farms to match those paid on cooperative farms. He worked as a consultant to government ministries and founded the state-owned companies that managed the production of oranges and the transportation of sugarcane. He was one of the founders of the Communist Party of Cuba in 1965 and served as a deputy in the National Assembly, the Cuban legislature. He studied and implemented improved production techniques in sugarcane and dairy farming. In the 1990s, he helped facilitate the importation of cattle from Florida, which led to the creation of a new breed of cattle. Of his brother's fame he said: \\"Fidel has one ambition. I have another. His thing is political. Mine is the street. I am free, and he's in a kind of a prison.\\" Unlike el presidente he continued to smoke cigars until the day he died. In 2007, when Fidel was recovering from surgery, Ramón told an interviewer that he \\"is doing very well, protected by the socialist saints.... All of us brothers are very resilient.\\" He and his wife Janice had three children, Ramón Omar, Lina, and Ángel Castro. Castro died on 23 February 2016. His death was announced in Granma, the official newspaper of the Cuban Communist Party. His brother, Fidel died 9 months later on 25 November 2016. ==ReferencesAdditional sources=== * Category:Cuban revolutionaries Category:People of the Cuban Revolution Ramon Category:1924 births Category:2016 deaths Category:Communist Party of Cuba politicians Category:University of Havana alumni Category:Military history of Cuba Category:1950s in Cuba Category:1960s in Cuba Category:1970s in Cuba Category:1980s in Cuba Category:1990s in Cuba Category:2000s in Cuba Category:Cuban people of Galician descent Category:People from Mayarí Category:20th-century Cuban people Category:21st- century Cuban people Category:20th-century Cuban politicians Category:21st- century Cuban politicians ","title":"Ramón Castro Ruz"},{"id":"6208121","text":"Oenothera lindheimeri 'Siskiyou Pink' Oenothera lindheimeri,ITIS Standard Report Page: Oenothera lindheimeri . accessed 8.1.2013Updated for ITIS by the Flora of North America Expertise Network, in connection with an update for USDA PLANTS (2007-2010) formerly Gaura lindheimeri, and commonly known as Lindheimer's beeblossom, white gaura, pink gaura, Lindheimer's clockweed, and Indian feather, is a species of Oenothera. The perennial plant is native to southern Louisiana and Texas.USDA Plants Profile: Gaura lindheimeri The specific epithet is after Ferdinand Jacob Lindheimer, a German-born botanist who collected extensively in Texas for Harvard University professor Asa Gray. ==Description== Oenothera lindheimeri is a perennial herbaceous plant growing to 50–150 cm tall, with densely clustered branched stems growing from an underground rhizome. The leaves are finely hairy, lanceolate, 1–9 cm long and 1–13 mm broad, with a coarsely toothed margin. The flowers are produced on a 10–80 cm long inflorescence; they are pink or white, 2–3 cm diameter, with four petals 10–15 mm long and long hairlike stamens, and are produced from the beginning of spring until the first frost.Munz, P.

Macmillan . ==Cultivation== Oenothera lindheimeri is commonly grown as an ornamental plant. It is used in either garden beds or pots for accent colour and a delicate texture. It grows best in full sun and can survive lengthy periods of drought. Several cultivars have been selected for varying flower color, from nearly pure white in 'Whirling Butterflies' to darker pink in 'Cherry Brandy' and 'Siskiyou Pink'. In some, the petals are white at dawn then turning pink before falling off at dusk. Although a perennial rated USDA Zone 5(6)-9 for hardiness it may not overwinter reliably, and is often treated as an annual outside its native areas. In colder climates a heavy winter mulch is necessary.Perennials.com This plant has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. ==Etymology== Gaura: Derived from Greek, meaning ‘superb’.

In the famous campaign, people from all walks of life (in this example, two red-haired sisters) donned \\"black eyes\\" to demonstrate their willingness to \\"fight\\" instead of \\"switch\\" from the Tareyton brand. \\"Us Tareyton smokers would rather fight than switch!\\" is the enduring slogan that appeared in magazine, newspaper, and television advertisements for Tareyton cigarettes from 1963 until 1981. It was the American Tobacco Company's most visible advertising campaign in the 1960s and 1970s. ==Beginnings== The slogan was created by James Jordan of the BBDO advertising agency. The first print advertisement appeared in Life magazine on October 11, 1963. The advertisements would appear solely in print between 1963 and 1966. In 1966, the first television advertisements with the slogan aired. The target of the campaign was to create a sense of loyalty amongst Tareyton smokers. That led to the \\"rather fight than switch\\" campaign, in which the makeup the models wore made it seem as if they were sporting black eyes, presumably earned in battles with smokers of other cigarettes. The slogan received grammar criticism from some quarters, which claimed correct usage should be \\"we\\" as the subject pronoun rather than \\"us\\", normally an object pronoun. https://www.mysanantonio.com/opinion/commentary/article/Grammar-and- ads-an-uneasy-marriage-9173643.php ==Television advertisements== Each commercial would begin in a predictable manner; the protagonist would do something that would be considered defiant (in one commercial, an old woman rocked sternly in her chair on her porch, while the rest of her development was being razed to make room for a condominium). In each commercial, the protagonist would say \\"Us Tareyton smokers would rather fight than switch!\\", usually only showing their side profile to the camera. After uttering the slogan, viewers would see the smoker's face, which had a noticeable \\"black eye\\" (in reality makeup), proving their willingness to fight for what they believed in, whether it be their tough decision of the day, or their choice to smoke Tareyton cigarettes. In the aforementioned example, the old woman's fighting spirit won out, and her house remained where it was, although the condominium was built alarmingly close to her property. Her son came to visit her, and it was revealed that he was a Tareyton smoker as well -- he also had a black eye. ==Later years== A Tareyton magazine advertisement from 1980. The new Light version showed the models sporting white makeup instead. Due to the success of the advertisement, Tareyton briefly enjoyed robust sales, which put them in the Top 10 of all American cigarette brands in the mid to late 1960s. The brand declined somewhat, to thirteenth, when the slogan waned in 1979. In 1971, radio and television advertisements for tobacco products were banned from American broadcasting stations, and Tareyton's television jingles ended. However, after the ban, the slogan continued to be used in magazines and newspapers, due to the slogan and the name recognition the brand received. In 1975, the slogan was used to advertise for the Tareyton \\"100\\". In 1976, the American Tobacco Company, which made Tareyton cigarettes, introduced Tareyton Light cigarettes. In the new advertisements, men and women sported \\"white eyes,\\" with an updated slogan: \\"Us Tareyton smokers would rather light than fight!\\" The two slogans would be used to sell the two separate variations until 1981, when market value declined. This slogan was notable in that it was the final slogan used for the Tareyton brand. Declining sales led to an end of advertising the brand. ==Cultural impact== The then-fresh slogan was adopted by supporters of Barry Goldwater during the 1964 campaign for the presidency. Goldwater appeared to have the nomination in hand as the primary season closed, but supporters of the moderate Republican William Scranton tried to mount a \\"Draft Scranton\\" reply. \\"Goldwater Girls\\" (mostly adult women) were seen at Scranton events wearing bandages and sporting signs saying \\"We'd rather fight than switch!\\". A 1964 single released on the Camp Records label parodied the slogan with the song \\"I'd Rather Fight Than Swish,\\" using the slang term swish, meaning to behave effeminately. Thomas \\"TNT\\" Todd, a civil rights activist, parodied the slogan to make a point regarding the Vietnam War in a 1967 speech. Todd was quoted as saying, \\"...Yet our best trained, best educated, best equipped, best prepared troops refuse to fight! Matter of fact, it's safe to say that they would rather switch than fight!\\" The audio clip of his speech was later used as the prelude to the 1989 Public Enemy single \\"Fight the Power.\\" ==References== Category:Advertising campaigns Category:American advertising slogans Category:Words and phrases introduced in 1963 Category:American television commercials Category:Tobacco advertising Category:1960s television commercials ","title":"Us Tareyton smokers would rather fight than switch!"},{"id":"6208170","text":"Hugh Riminton (born 1961) is an Australian foreign correspondent, journalist and television news presenter.

It is found throughout the North Island, and the top of the South Island. The Māori language name is '. Swamp maire grows in wetlands, where it develops breathing roots in waterlogged soils, but is also tolerant of reasonably dry situations. The creamy-white flowers in autumn are followed by bright red drupes around 3 cm in length in late winter. The fruit are edible and can be eaten raw or cooked. The fruits are rich in antioxidants.

The organization clearly defined \\"short stature\\" to be men 170 cm (5'7\\") or below and women 157.5 cm (5'2\\") or below in height.NOSSA FAQ The group advocated on behalf of short people and hoped to foster greater acceptance of short people within society. NOSSA was opposed to the prejudice known as heightism. The group defined heightism as, \\"a prejudiced attitude about human height that often results in discrimination. It is based on the belief that short stature is an inferior trait and therefore undesirable.\\"NOSSA web page on heightism (2006) The organization ran a series of public education programs, sponsored height- related research, acted as a media \\"watch-dog\\" group, provided legal assistance for those affected by heightism, hosted online discussion groups, and invited members to gather once a year for an annual convention. NOSSA ended in early 2013 due to lack of support. ==History== NOSSA was formed in New York City in 2005. The organization is run by a four-person board of directors (trustees) who are elected to serve four-year terms in office. In May 2006 the group's secretary made comments in support of a Nebraska judge's decision not to send a short man to jail over child sexual abuse charges, due to a risk of his stature affecting his safety in prison.Too short for prison ruling protested - Washington Times, May 27, 2006. The organization apologised for the comments and removed the trustee who had made them, as well as making a donation to the Nebraska Children and Families Foundation.NOSSA response to Mangano comments - NOSSA Blogspot page, May 27, 2006. Short Support Editor, Steven Goldsmith became the new Secretary. In July 2006, NOSSA began producing a podcast called, Standing Tall Against Discrimination. In May 2008, NOSSA was featured in the Canadian Documentary S&M; Short and Male.Short & Male Documentary - Short & Male Documentary Website, September 22, 2008. ==HGH controversy== In 2003, The Food & Drug Administration (FDA) approved the use of human growth hormone (hGH) for children well below the average height with no medically determined cause, also known as idiopathic short stature. GH therapy had been prescribed previously for only medically determined causes of reduced height. Most patients to which this therapy was now made available produce normal levels of growth hormone on their own. Some other biological cause(s) still place these children more than 2 standard deviations below average height. NOSSA announced its opposition to the use of human growth hormone for short, but otherwise healthy, children. The organization believes being short isn't a problem; the real difficulties lies in the social bias against short people. In part to define the organization's position on the matter, NOSSA representative and author Ellen Frankel LCSW stated, \\"What we need is education for those who discriminate against short people, not the genetic engineering of the victims of that prejudice.\\"About Heightism page - Beyond Measure website. Frankel states, \\"The growth hormone deficient child suffers from an underlying medical problem that affects the body's health in different ways. The non-growth-hormone-deficient child has no underlying medical problem. They simply present as a variation on the norm with regard to height. The decision to medically intervene on the healthy child's stature is socially based due to height discrimination and prejudice.\\" NOSSA HGH Issue Website, 2006. ==Cosmetic leg lengthening== Leg lengthening is a complex process that has traditionally been performed primarily on children to correct disproportional leg lengths. It has also been an option for people with dwarfism to gain height. More recently, the procedure has been used to give people with constitutional short stature two or three extra inches of height. (Constitutional short stature refers to people who are in the bottom fifth percentile of height in their region and do not display any deformities common with dwarfism.) NOSSA claims to receive hundreds of e-mails each year from people requesting more information on cosmetic leg lengthening. The group actively discourages short statured people from undergoing leg lengthening solely for cosmetic reasons. The group encourages anyone who is seriously considering the surgery to research the procedure and surgeon thoroughly before undergoing the procedure. NOSSA encourages people to accept and love themselves as they are.NOSSA position on cosmetic leg lengthening NOSSA website, December 2006. ==Princeton economist study== In August 2006, a study by Princeton University economists Anne Case and Christina Paxson, \\"Stature and Status: Height, Ability, and Labor Market Outcomes\\"Case, A. and Paxson, C. \\"Stature and Status: Height, Ability, and Labor Market Outcomes.\\" NBER Working Paper No. 12466, August 2006. concluded that tall people are smarter than their height-challenged peers. The researchers report, \\"On average, taller people earn more because they are smarter. As early as age 3 — before schooling has had a chance to play a role — and throughout childhood, taller children perform significantly better on cognitive tests. The correlation between height in childhood and adulthood is approximately 0.7 for both men and women, so that tall children are much more likely to become tall adults. As adults, taller individuals are more likely to select into higher paying occupations that require more advanced verbal and numerical skills and greater intelligence, for which they earn handsome returns.\\" Case and Paxson emphasized that the correlation between height and intelligence was due to non-genetic factors, such as health and nutrition in utero and in childhood. As they explained, \\"Our results say nothing about the relationship between cognitive ability and that part of height that is determined by genetic background. Our results speak to that part of height that is driven by health and nutrition. There are very many very smart short people (Einstein comes to mind) and, frankly, many not-so-smart tall people.\\" NOSSA Secretary Steven Goldsmith responded to the study by stating, \\"If a similar study made similar conclusions about any other minority group, there would be fierce outrage from those groups and sympathy from many who are not in those groups.\\"NOSSA Response to Princeton Economic Study. - NOSSA website, August 2006. NOSSA Advisor Ellen Frankel LCSW continued, \\"We understand racism. It's time we take a serious look at heightism.\\" In reporting on the study, the media simplified the connection that the economists had drawn between height and intelligence. Paxson and Case theorize a person genetically programmed to be 6'4\\" who reaches only 6'2\\" because of poor nutrition is not necessarily smarter than someone who with optimal nutrition has reached his full height potential of 5'4\\".Shortchanged article - New Yorker website, September 2006. ==eHarmony boycott== On April 2, 2007, NOSSA called for a boycott of the online dating website eHarmony. Their press release cited: :\\"Suspicions have been confirmed after numerous tests indicated that the exact same responses to the website’s membership questionnaire, with the exception of physical height, resulted in either approval of membership (when an acceptable tall height was submitted) or denial of membership (when a short height was submitted). These tests were conducted numerous times to ensure accuracy. The National Organization Of Short Statured Adults has requested a full explanation from the company. On June 1, 2007, NOSSA received a response from eHarmony in which the company denied that it had ever discriminated against short statured people.\\"http://nossaonline.org/pressrelease.html, eHarmony Discriminates Against Short Men. ==Legal programs== NOSSA provides legal assistance for members who present valid claims of height discrimination in employment, housing and other real estate, public accommodations, public service, and educational facilities.NOSSA Legal Assistance Program - NOSSA website, August 2006.

Established in 1963 with an initial size of about 20,000 hectares, the reserve was further expanded in 1975, covering an area of about 200,000 hectares in the Qionglai Mountains region. There are over 4,000 different species recorded in the reserve. According to China's Third National Giant Panda Survey, Wolong National Nature Reserve houses about 150 wild individuals of highly endangered giant pandas. The reserve is also a home to many other endangered species including: snow leopards, red pandas, golden monkeys, white-lipped deer and many precious plants. Before the devastating 2008 Wenchuan earthquake Wolong got up to 200,000 visitors every year. Its area is superseded by the Wolong Special Administrative Region. == Background == In June 1980, the China Conservation and Research Center for the Giant Panda was established at Wolong with the efforts of both World Wildlife Fund (WWF) and the Chinese government. To this date, researchers have conducted many breeding research projects on giant pandas and have successfully bred 66 panda cubs. == Location == Lilium regale, a local native flower A mountain stream runs through the Wolong Valley (where the reserve is); the stream is heavily armoured with boulders and smaller rounded stones. Stream waters are rather alkaline with pH levels in the range of 8.91. (Hogan, 2007) Water quality turbidity is quite high due to extensive sand and gravel mining in stream.Hogan, C.M., Lumina Tech, Environmental analysis of the Wolong National Nature Reserve (2007) According to a 2001 research by Dr. Jianguo Liu of Michigan State University, the rate of destruction is higher after the reserve's creation than before its creation.Liu, Jianuo, Marc Linderman, Zhiyun Ouyang, Li An, Jian Yang, and Hemin Zhang. \\"Ecological Degradation in Protected Areas: The Case of Wolong Nature Reserve for Giant Pandas.\\" Science 292.5514 (2001): 98-101. Web. February 18, 2016. Using NASA's satellite images and records of population, Liu's research team concluded that due to tourism and the increase in local population, the reserve is facing an unprecedented threat. \\"Tourists don't think they have an impact on panda habitat, but indirectly each visitor has some impact,\\" Liu said. \\"We don't see ourselves as a destructive force, but we are.\\"(April 6, 2001) Endangered Pandas Not Safe in Chinese Nature Reserve, Environment News Service. == Fauna == The giant panda is the most famous species of the reserve. Other typical larger Carnivora are the Ussuri dhole, Asian black bear, Asiatic golden cat, red panda, hog badger and yellow-throated marten. Hooved mammals are represented by Sichuan takins, wild boar, musk deer, mainland serows, Chinese gorals, tufted deer and sambar deer. Other noticeable mammals include golden snub-nosed monkeys, Tibetan macaques, complex-toothed flying squirrels, bamboo rats, and porcupines. Because the reserve comprises different altitudes, it includes tropical and temperate climate zones and harbors species typically for the tropics, like clouded leopards and sambar deer as well as species from temperate regions, like white-lipped deer, snow leopards and Turkestan lynxes. Camera-trap surveys conducted in the reserve area between 2005 and 2009 did not record any leopard. == 2008 earthquake== Many giant panda houses were broken in the 2008 Sichuan earthquake The region, including the Panda Research Center, was largely devastated by the catastrophic May 12, 2008 Sichuan earthquake, though the captive giant pandas were initially reported to be safe.(May 14, 2008). Pandas International.(May 13, 2008). Pandas 'safe' at park after quake. Immediately after the quake, officials were unable to contact the reserve. PRC's Foreign Ministry later said that a group of 31 British tourists visiting the Wolong panda reserve in the quake-hit area returned safe and uninjured to the provincial capital. The well-being of an even greater number of pandas in the neighbouring panda reserves initially remained unknown. Five security guards at the reserve were killed by the earthquake. Six pandas escaped after their enclosures were damaged. By May 20, two pandas at the reserve were found to be injured, while the search continued for another two adult pandas that went missing after the quake. By May 28, 2008, one panda was still missing, nine-year-old Mao Mao, a mother of five at the breeding centre. She was discovered on Monday, June 9, her body crushed by a wall in her enclosure. Panda keepers and other workers placed her remains in a small wooden crate and buried her outside the breeding centre. For the time being the giant pandas have been relocated to the Bifengxia Panda Base, which is also managed by the China Panda Protection and Research Center. == See also == * Bifengxia Panda Base * Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding * Dengsheng * Red panda * Sichuan Giant Panda Sanctuaries * Wildlife of China * Wolong Special Administrative Region == References  External links == * *Wolong National Nature Reserve In Bloomberg Category:Nature reserves in China Category:Biological research institutes Category:Nature reserves of Sichuan Category:Biosphere reserves of China Category:Protected areas established in 1963 Category:Tourist attractions in Sichuan ","title":"Wolong National Nature Reserve"},{"id":"6208379","text":"Looking north towards high cliffs that create The Gap near Watsons Bay. The Gap is an ocean cliff on the South Head peninsula in eastern Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. The area, which faces the Tasman Sea, is located in the eastern suburb of Watsons Bay, in the Municipality of Woollahra, near South Head. Although the cliff is a popular visitor destination, it has an infamy for suicides. ==History== tram passing through The Gap on its way to Watsons Bay, c. 1949. Prior to European settlement, The Gap was inhabited by the Birrabirragal Aboriginal clan who were part of the coastal Darug people. Shortly after the arrival of the First Fleet in 1788, the British established a makeshift signalling station on the ridge above The Gap. Its role was to give early warning to the colony of any approaching ship. A formal signal station was established in 1790, serviced by a bridle trail that developed into the Old South Head Road by 1811. Pilots based at Camp Cove in Watsons Bay would meet ships at the entrance to Port Jackson in order to guide them safely into Sydney harbour. In 1871, a year after the official withdrawal of Imperial British forces, the headland around The Gap became a military garrison when work began to build coastal artillery emplacements to defend the Port of Sydney. Construction was undertaken by the colonial government's militia under the command of British military engineers. The first barracks, which were occupied by members of the New South Wales Artillery, were completed by 1877. Extensions were added in 1880 to accommodate additional personnel. Many of the early barracks are still standing near The Gap. By 1895, the area was being used by the fledgling Australian Army as a gunnery school. In 1942 the Royal Australian Navy had established a radar training school nearby.Oldham (ed.), 100 Years of the Royal Australian Navy, p. 126 The facility was initially named HMAS Radar, but was later commissioned as on 14 March 1945. Torpedo and anti-submarine warfare training were relocated to Watson in 1956. Visitors are sometimes permitted to visit the clifftop chapel that was dedicated in 1962 to service personnel who served at The Gap. The Gap has been part of Sydney Harbour National Park since 1982. In 1990, the area was opened to the public to offer access to the spectacular cliff views and walks. ;Ship wreck In 1857 the sailing ship Dunbar carrying 63 passengers and 59 crew struck the rocky cliff at the foot of The Gap. The Dunbar, which was captained by James Green, had left England on 31 May 1857 arriving off Botany Bay shortly after dark on 20 August 1857. In poor visibility and stormy weather, Captain Green misjudged the entrance to the harbour. The Dunbar drove into the rocky cliff at the foot of The Gap causing the ship's topmasts to snap and the ship to turn broadside against the rocks because of the pounding of the waves. By light next day, crowds watched as breakers pounded victims' corpses against the rocks. Other bodies amid cargo and wreckage were washed inside Sydney harbour with the incoming tide; many of the dead were naked and had been mutilated by sharks. The funeral of the Dunbar victims was one of the longest processions ever seen in Sydney. The unidentified dead were buried in a common grave at Camperdown cemetery. A young sailor named James Johnson was the only survivor. He was rescued after clinging to a rocky ledge below The Gap for 36 hours. Johnson, who was later employed at the lighthouse near Newcastle, rescued another lone survivor from the wreckage of the steamer, SS Cawarra, in July 1866. The Dunbar's anchor was recovered more than fifty years later and placed on the cliffs at Watsons Bay with a memorial tablet. ==Geology, fauna and flora== The Gap is formed from Sydney sandstone making it part of the Sydney basin. The cliff was laid as sediment more than 200 million years ago in the Triassic period. During the Jurassic era, 40 million years later, a cataclysmic event resulted in an enormous crack forming within the strata. This fault allowed erosion from wave action to create the cliff line around Sydney. Tessellated basalt rock platforms lie at the base of the cliff because The Gap is bordered to the south and west by an older sequence of largely low-grade metamorphic and granitic rocks of the Lachlan Fold Belt. Northwards these rocks pass into the Hunter Region sequence that is transitional between the Sydney Basin and New England Fold Belt. The Gap itself forms a sequence that continues offshore to the edge of the Sahul Shelf. The total maximum thickness of rock formations within the Sydney Basin are in depth ranges of . The rock is a very porous stone. It is composed of very pure silica grains and a small amount of the iron mineral siderite in varying proportions, bound with a clay matrix. The Gap's warm yellow-brown colour is due to oxidation of the stone. Skinks and eastern water dragons can often be seen moving among the rocks. Seabirds, such as the silver gull and the Pacific gull use the cliff for nesting sites. The sandstone cliff has created nutrient-poor soils similar to those found around Sydney. As nutrients are scarce, plants which survive on The Gap cannot afford to lose leaves to herbivores so they defend their foliage with toxins. Vegetation includes the eucalypts which produces such toxins. ==Suicide location== The Gap is a well known place for suicides in Australia. The tall cliffs have made it a location for those wishing to end their lives. Between 2008 and 2011 numerous measures have been implemented to dissuade those at risk of suicide, these include security cameras to monitor the area, several purpose-built Lifeline counselling phone booths, and information boards from the Black Dog Institute and Beyondblue. An inward-leaning fence has also been erected to deter people from jumping. On the afternoon of 20 April 1936, noted Australian diarist Meta Truscott recorded how she and her uncle, Christopher Dunne, witnessed a suicide at The Gap. By chance, the pair shared a bench with a well-dressed, middle-aged man who was later identified as William Albert Swivell. As the three watched a ship sail through the Sydney Heads, her uncle asked the man if he knew its name, to which Swivell replied, \\"The Nieuw Holland.\\" Soon afterwards, the smartly-dressed man stood up and walked away; he climbed to the top of the cliff and jumped to his death. In June 1995, a 24-year-old model, Caroline Byrne, fell to her death at The Gap. Due to the notoriety of the area, police did not initially suspect foul play. However, in 2008, her then-boyfriend was convicted of pushing her over the edge, but in February 2012, he was acquitted of her murder on appeal. In November 2007, Charmaine Dragun, a 29-year-old newsreader who worked for 10 News First, jumped from The Gap after battling depression and anorexia. ===Angel of The Gap=== In 2009, Don Ritchie, a former Second World War Naval veteran and retired insurance agent, was awarded a Medal of the Order of Australia for preventing suicides at The Gap. From 1964, Ritchie saved 164 people from jumping from the cliffs by crossing the road from his property and engaging them in conversation, often beginning with the words, \\"Can I help you in some way?\\" Afterwards Ritchie would invite them back to his home for a cup of tea and a chat. Some would return years later to thank him for his efforts in talking them out of their decision. Ritchie, who was nicknamed the \\"Angel of The Gap\\", died in May 2012. ==Gallery== File:The Gap looking north.JPGThe Gap looking out over the Tasman Sea to the north File:The Gap looking south.JPGThe Gap looking out over Vaucluse the Tasman Sea to the south File:Watsons bay, New South Wales 2.1.jpgLooking south over Watsons Bay and Vaucluse with the City of Sydney and its harbour on the right ==See also== * Golden Gate Bridge, USA * Beachy Head, UK * Tōjinbō, Japan * Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge, China == References  * [CC-By-SA] * Green light for Gap safety Cameras to alert police Category:Cliffs of Australia Category:Suicide in Australia Category:Geography of Sydney Category:Sydney Harbour National Park ","title":"The Gap (Sydney)"},{"id":"6208423","text":"Woody T.

His father was an electrical engineer who graduated from the Birla Institute of Technology, Mesra. Kejriwal spent most of his childhood in north Indian towns such as Sonipat, Ghaziabad and Hisar. He was educated at Campus School in Hisar and at a Christian missionary Holy Child School at Sonipat. In 1985, he took the IIT-JEE exam and scored All India Rank (AIR) of 563. He graduated from Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, majoring in Mechanical engineering. He joined Tata Steel in 1989 and was posted in Jamshedpur. Kejriwal resigned in 1992, having taken leave of absence to study for the Civil Services Examination. He spent some time in Calcutta (present-day Kolkata), where he met Mother Teresa, and volunteered with The Missionaries of Charity and at the Ramakrishna Mission in North-East India and at Nehru Yuva Kendra. ==Career== Arvind Kejriwal joined the Indian Revenue Service (IRS) as an Assistant Commissioner of Income Tax in 1995, after qualifying through the Civil Services Examination.

Failure to abide by that condition would require him to repay the salary given during the leave period. He rejoined in November 2002. According to Kejriwal, he was not given any posting for almost a year, and kept getting his salary without doing any work; so, after 18 months, he applied for leave without pay. For the next 18 months, Kejriwal was on sanctioned unpaid leave. In February 2006, he resigned from his position as Joint Commissioner of Income Tax in New Delhi. The Government of India claimed that Kejriwal had violated his original agreement by not working for three years. Kejriwal said that his 18 months of work and 18 months of unpaid absence amounted to the stipulated three-year period during which he could not resign and that this was an attempt to malign him due to his involvement with the Indian anti- corruption movement. The dispute ran for several years until, in 2011, it was resolved when he paid his way out of the Service with the help of loans from friends. Kejriwal paid 927,787 as dues, but stated that this should not be considered as an admission of fault. After joining politics, Kejriwal claimed in 2013 that he had chosen public service over earning crores as an Income Tax Commissioner. This led to a controversy, with the IRS association pointing out that he has never been promoted to the rank of Commissioner of Income Tax. ==Anti-corruption activismParivartan and Kabira=== In December 1999, while still in service with the Income Tax Department, Kejriwal, Manish Sisodia and others found a movement named Parivartan (which means \\"change\\"), in the Sundar Nagar area of Delhi. A month later, in January 2000, Kejriwal took a sabbatical from work to focus on Parivartan. Parivartan addressed citizens' grievances related to Public Distribution System (PDS), public works, social welfare schemes, income tax and electricity. It was not a registered NGO - it ran on individual donations, and was characterised as a jan andolan (\\"people's movement\\") by its members. Later, in 2005, Kejriwal and Manish Sisodia launched Kabir, a registered NGO named after the medieval philosopher Kabir. Like Parivartan, Kabir was also focused on RTI and participatory governance. However, unlike Parivartan, it accepted institutional donations. According to Kejriwal, Kabir was mainly run by Sisodia. In 2000, Parivartan filed a public interest litigation (PIL) demanding transparency in public dealings of the Income Tax department, and also organised a satyagraha outside the Chief Commissioner's office. Kejriwal and other activists also stationed themselves outside the electricity department, asking visitors not to pay bribes and offered to help them in getting work done for free. In 2001, the Delhi government enacted a state- level Right To Information (RTI) Act, which allowed the citizens to access government records for a small fee. Parivartan used RTI to help people get their work done in government departments without paying a bribe. In 2002, the group obtained official reports on 68 public works projects in the area, and performed a community-led audit to expose misappropriations worth 7 million in 64 of the projects. On 14 December 2002, Parivartan organised a jan sunvai (public hearing), in which the citizens held public officials and leaders accountable for the lack of development in their locality. In 2003 (and again in 2008), Parivartan exposed a PDS scam, in which ration shop dealers were siphoning off subsidised foodgrains in collusion with civic officials. In 2004, Parivartan used RTI applications to access communication between government agencies and the World Bank, regarding a project for privatisation of water supply. Kejriwal and other activists questioned the huge expenditure on the project, and argued that it would hike water tariffs ten-fold, thus effectively cutting off the water supply to the city's poor. The project was stalled as a result of Parivartan's activism. Another campaign by Parivartan led to a court order that required private schools, which had received public land at discounted prices, to admit more than 700 poor kids without fee. Along with other social activists like Anna Hazare, Aruna Roy and Shekhar Singh, Kejriwal came to be recognised as an important contributor to the campaign for a national-level Right to Information Act (enacted in 2005). He resigned from his job in February 2006, and later that year, he was given the Ramon Magsaysay Award for Emergent Leadership, for his involvement with Parivartan. The award recognised him for activating the RTI movement at the grassroots, and empowering New Delhi's poor citizens to fight corruption. By 2012, Parivartan was largely inactive. Sundar Nagri, where the movement was concentrated, suffered from irregular water supply, unreliable PDS system and poorly done public works. Calling it \\"ephemeral and delusionary in nature\\", Kejriwal noted that Parivartan's success was limited, and the changes brought by it did not last long. ===Public Cause Research Foundation=== In December 2006, Kejriwal established the Public Cause Research Foundation in December 2006, together with Manish Sisodia and Abhinandan Sekhri. He donated his Ramon Magsaysay Award prize money as a seed fund. Besides the three founders, Prashant Bhushan and Kiran Bedi served as the Foundation's trustees. This new body paid the employees of Parivartan. Kejriwal used the RTI Act in corruption cases in many government departments including the Income Tax Department, the Municipal Corporation of Delhi, the Public Distribution System and the Delhi Electricity Board. ===Jan Lokpal movement=== In 2010, Kejriwal protested against corruption in the Commonwealth Games. He argued that the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) did not have any powers to take any action against the guilty, while CBI was incapable of launching an unbiased investigation against the ministers who controlled it. He advocated appointment of public ombudsman - Lokpal at the Centre and Lokayuktas in states. In 2011, Kejriwal joined several other activists, including Anna Hazare and Kiran Bedi, to form the India Against Corruption (IAC) group. The IAC demanded enactment of the Jan Lokpal Bill, which would result in a strong ombudsman. The campaign evolved into the 2011 Indian anti-corruption movement. In response to the campaign, the government's advisory body - the National Advisory Council - drafted a Lokpal Bill. However, the NAC's Bill was criticised by Kejriwal and other activists on the grounds that it did not have enough powers to take action against the prime minister, other corrupt officeholders and the judiciary. The activists also criticised the procedure for selection of Lokpal, the transparency clauses and the proposal to disallow the Lokpal from taking cognisance of public grievances. Amid continuing protests, the Government constituted a committee to Draft a Jan Lokpal Bill. Kejriwal was one of the civil society representative members of this committee. However, he alleged that the IAC activists had an unequal position in the committee, and the government appointees kept ignoring their recommendations. The Government argued that the activists could not be allowed to blackmail the elected representatives through protests. Kejriwal retorted that democratically elected representatives could not be allowed to function like dictators, and asked for a public debate on the contentious issues. The IAC activists intensified their protests, and Anna Hazare organised a hunger strike. Kejriwal and other activists were arrested for defying a police directive to give a written undertaking that they will not go to JP Park. Kejriwal attacked the government on this and said there was a need for a debate over police power to detain and release people at will. In August 2011, a settlement was reached between the Government and the activists. Besides the government, the Jan Lokpal movement was also criticised by some citizens as 'undemocratic' on the grounds that the ombudsman had powers over elected representatives. Arundhati Roy claimed that the movement was not a people's movement; instead, it was funded by foreigners to influence policy making in India. She pointed out that the Ford Foundation had funded the Emergent Leadership category of the Ramon Magsaysay Award, and also donated $397,000 to Kejriwal's NGO Kabir. Both Kejriwal and Ford Foundation termed the allegations as baseless, stating that the donations were made to support the RTI campaigns. Besides, several other Indian organisations had also received grants from the Ford Foundation. Kejriwal also denied the allegations that the movement was a plot against the ruling Congress by the RSS, or that it was an upper-caste conspiracy against the Dalits. By January 2012, the Government had backtracked on its promise to implement a strong Jan Lokpal, resulting in another series of protests from Kejriwal and his fellow activists. These protests attracted lower participation compared to the 2011 protests. By mid-2012, Kejriwal had replaced Anna Hazare as the face of the remaining protestors. In 2015 during the second term of AAP government in Delhi the Jan Lokpal Bill was passed by the assembly awaiting presidents approval ==Political careerEstablishment of AAP=== Kejriwal during the launch of AAP in Bangalore, in July 2013 One of the major criticisms directed at the Jan Lokpal activists was that they had no right to dictate terms to the elected representatives. As a result, Kejriwal and other activists decided to enter politics and contest elections. In November 2012, they formally launched the Aam Aadmi Party; Kejriwal was elected as the party's National Convener. The party name reflects the phrase Aam Aadmi, or \\"common man\\", whose interests Kejriwal proposed to represent. The establishment of AAP caused a rift between Kejriwal and Hazare. AAP decided to contest the 2013 Delhi Legislative Assembly election, with Kejriwal contesting against the incumbent Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit. Kejriwal became the fifth most-mentioned Indian politician on social media channels in the run-up to the elections. ===Chief Minister of Delhi (first term)=== In the 2013, Delhi Legislative Assembly elections for all 70 seats, the Bharatiya Janata Party won 31 seats, followed by Aam Aadmi Party with 28 seats. Kejriwal defeated incumbent Chief Minister, Sheila Dikshit of the Indian National Congress (INC), in her constituency of New Delhi by a margin of 25,864 votes. AAP formed a minority government in the hung assembly, (claiming support for the action gauged from opinion polls) with outside support from the eight INC MLAs, one Janata Dal MLA and one independent MLA. Kejriwal was sworn in as the second-youngest chief minister of Delhi on 28 December 2013, after Chaudhary Brahm Prakash who became chief minister at the age of 34. He was in charge of Delhi's home, power, planning, finance, services and vigilance ministries. On 14 February 2014, he resigned as Chief Minister after failing to table the Jan Lokpal Bill in the Delhi Assembly. He recommended the dissolution of the Assembly. Kejriwal blamed the Indian National Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party for stalling the anti- corruption legislation and linked it with the government's decision to register a First Information Report (FIR) against industrialist Mukesh Ambani, chairman and managing director of Reliance Industries. In April 2014 he said that he had made a mistake by resigning without publicly explaining the rationale behind his decision.\\"Quitting as Delhi CM was a 'mistake', admits Kejriwal\\", Hindustan Times, 11 April 2014. ===2014 General elections=== Kejriwal campaigning in Maharashtra during the 2014 Lok Sabha elections Kejriwal said in January, prior to his resignation as chief minister, that he would not contest a seat in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections. Party members persuaded him to change his mind, and on 25 March, he agreed to contest against the BJP prime ministerial candidate, Narendra Modi, from Varanasi. He lost the contest by a margin of around 3,70,000 votes. ===Chief Minister of Delhi (second term)=== Kejriwal led Aam Aadmi Party to win 67 of the 70 constituencies in the 2015 Delhi Assembly elections, leaving the BJP with three seats and the INC with none. In those elections, he was again elected from the New Delhi constituency, defeating Nupur Sharma by 31,583 votes. He took oath on 14 February 2015 as Delhi's chief minister for a second time at Ramlila Maidan. Since then his party has passed the Jan Lokpal Bill though with some differences. There has been a long-running dispute between Kejriwal's office and that of the Lieutenant-Governor of Delhi during Kejriwal's second term as Chief Minister. Various issues have been involved, relating which office has ultimate responsibility for various aspects of government, including some significant public appointments. Manish Sisodia characterised it as \\"It is a battle between the selected and the elected\\" and indicated after a legal setback that the government was prepared to take the issues to the Supreme Court of India./ Mohalla Clinics that are primary health centres in Delhi was first set up by the Aam Aadmi Party government in 2015, and as of 2018, 187 such clinics have been set up across the state and served more than 2 million residents. The Government has kept a target of setting up 1000 such clinics in the city before 2020 Delhi Legislative Assembly Elections. Mohalla Clinics offer a basic package of essential health services including medicines, diagnostics, and consultation free of cost. These clinics serve as the first point of contact for the population, offer timely services, and reduce the load of referrals to secondary and tertiary health facilities in the state. Beginning in October 2019, New Delhi began rolling out free bus transit for women on the Delhi Transport Corporation, with women traveling for free when using pink tickets carrying a message from Kejriwal. He has been criticized for his controversial remarks over Biharis and \\"outsiders\\". Shunglu Committee submitted a report to LG of Delhi raising questions over decisions of Government of Delhi. ==Legal affairs== Arvind Kejriwal has had a controversial history of allegations, subsequent defamation cases against him. In several cases Kejriwal has unconditionally apologised after allegations have been found baseless in defamation cases in courts and then he has issued apology letters to several leaders on the same. It started with Kejriwal releasing his list of most corrupt politicians in January 2014 that included several leaders across the political spectrum. Of the several on the list, Nitin Gadkari immediately filed a defamation suit against Kejriwal. Kejriwal further made allegations against finance minister Arun Jaitley for irregularities in DDCA. This was followed by Arun Jaitley filing a 10 crore defamation suit against Kejriwal. In the meanwhile in 2016, Kejriwal made allegations against Bikram Majithia, then revenue minister of Punjab of involvement in drug trade for which Majithia filed a defamation case against him and two others from Aam Aadmi party. Kejriwal apologised to Majithia a couple of years later in March 2018. Subsequently, Kejriwal also apologised to union minister Nitin Gadkari for his unverified allegations and also sought apology from former minister Kapil Sibal. Around the same time on 2 March 2016, Delhi High Court asked Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and suspended BJP MP Kirti Azad to file their written statements in a civil defamation suit of Rs 5 crores filed by DDCA for their alleged remarks against the cricket body regarding its functioning and finances. Following this in April 2018 Arvind Kejriwal and three others from his party including Sanjay Singh, Raghav Chaddha and Ashutosh apologised Arun Jaitley in a joint letter. In 2019, a criminal complaint was filed against him for his controversial comments on Biharis. In his affidavit to Election Directorate before the second term elections in 2015 Kejriwal had declared that he has 10 criminal charges and 47 total charges against him. ==Political views== Kejriwal discussed his views on corruption and the state of the Indian democracy in his book Swaraj. He advocates for a decentralisation of government and the involvement of the panchayat in local decisions and budgets. He claims that foreign multinational corporations have too much power in the decision making process of the central government and that the politicians at the Centre are not being held accountable for their actions and inaction after their election. ==Personal life== In 1995, Arvind married Sunita, a 1993-batch IRS officer. She took voluntary retirement in 2016 as Commissioner of Income Tax in the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal. The couple have a daughter named Harshita, and a son named Pulkit. Kejriwal is a vegetarian and has been practising the Vipassanā meditation technique for many years. He is diabetic. In 2016, Kejriwal underwent a surgery for his persistent cough problem. ==Awards and recognitions== * 2004: Ashoka Fellow, Civic Engagement * 2005: Satyendra K.

Jobseekers must look for work daily as new rules make work for dole mandatory for all aged 18 to 49. news.com.au. Retrieved 30 July 2014. On 20 March 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Work for the Dole was suspended, alongside all other mutual obligation requirements. ==Basic Work for the Dole== Placements are available in a wide range of areas including heritage, the environment, arts, community care, tourism, sport and making and maintaining community services and facilities. Most projects benefit the general community through services and adding value to civic assets; however, some projects in drought-affected areas are designed to benefit private enterprise (through the Drought Force scheme). Upon successful completion of a Work for the Dole placement, participants are usually eligible for a Training Credit to assist with accredited training ($800 for six months, less for less time), a Passport to Employment package of job application training, and a fortnightly transport supplement. Work for the Dole services are delivered through community or local government bodies. Job seekers may be required by the government to take part in Work for the Dole if they are aged 18 or 19 years, recently completed Year 12, getting the full rate of Youth Allowance, and have been getting payments for three months or more, or aged 18 to 59 years, getting the full rate of Youth Allowance or Jobseeker Allowance, and have been getting payments for twelve months or more. In addition, job seekers aged 18 and over who get either allowance can volunteer to participate in an activity at any time. Those participating in the program usually do so for 50 hours per fortnight. Each placement lasts for six months, and is followed by six months without obligation to participate. Work for the Dole participants may receive an extra $20.80 per fortnight, on top of their Allowance payments. Protective clothing is provided by the project sponsor if it is needed. Essential training, such as occupational health and safety training, is also provided. Transport costs are not separately covered however, and can easily absorb the additional payment – especially for those undertaking the \\"full time\\" version. Other mutual obligation options that have been on offer include approved training, volunteering, Drought Force; for 17-24 year olds the Green Army Program and PaTH Internships; and in remote areas the Community Development Program and Community Development Employment Projects. ==History== Work for the Dole was first proposed by the Liberal Party in 1987 and was enacted on a trial basis a year after it gained public support at the 1996 federal election in a Liberal/National coalition. Despite mixed feelings among younger people, at whom the program was aimed, there was little mainstream opposition when launched. On 1 July 1998, all job seekers aged 18–24 that had been claiming benefits for six months or more were required to join the scheme. From 19 April 1999, job seekers aged 17 or 18 and who had left Year 12 had to join the scheme after three months of job seeking. During the 2000 Summer Olympic Games, all those of an eligible age who had been unemployed for three months or more and lived in Sydney were required to participate. This temporary change was made to encourage people to take up casual work during the Games. In December 2000, Work for the Dole was expanded to include those aged 35–39. Additionally, those aged 40–49 could volunteer themselves for the scheme for the first time. On 1 July 2002, Training Credits were paid to those completing the scheme for the first time. The initial amount was $800 for six months work. In December 2002, the Drought Force initiative was enacted. Previously, all Work for the Dole projects directly benefited the public, community organisations or civic assets. However, this scheme expanded the scope to include work for privately owned agricultural properties in areas deemed to be experiencing exceptional circumstances (generally drought). On 1 July 2006, \\"Full Time Work for the Dole\\" was enacted for those seeking work for 12 months or more. They were directed towards a scheme identical to the standard form, except that the fortnightly hours of participation was increased to 50. Despite speculation otherwise, the Rudd government maintained Work for the Dole.13 May 2008. Work-for-dole to stay: Swan. The Age. Fairfax Media. Retrieved 5 July 2013. During the Gillard Government participation rates dropped significantly. In July 2015 Work for the Dole was scaled up, with wider age groups as part of the government's welfare policy under former Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott. The programme is administered by a network of private companies. Participants are required to perform a number of hours of community work to continue to receive Newstart allowance. In April 2016, 18 year old Josh Park-Fing died while on a Work for the Dole placement. In the 2016 Australian federal budget, an alternative to the Work for the Dole program was introduced, targeted at unemployed youth under 25: the Youth Jobs PaTH (Prepare-Trial-Hire) Programme, an internship programme. ==Reviews== A number of reviews of Work for the Dole have been undertaken; these include: *2007 Australian National Audit Office, Audit Report *2016 Australian National University's (ANU) Social Research CentreBiddle, N and M Gray (2015), Evaluation of the impact of Work for the Dole 2014–15 in selected areas, Report to the Australian Government Department of Employment., Australian National University Social Research Centre. Retrieved 17 February 2016Heath Aston, (11 February 2016) Work for the dole has little effect on finding work: review, Sydney Morning Herald. Retrieved 17 February 2016 ==Academic and media commentary== Judith Bessant, in \\"Civil Conscription or Reciprocal Obligation: The Ethics of 'Work for the Dole, queried the Government's justifications for the scheme, which centred on providing a means for young people to get back into the workforce by improving their work ethic as a misunderstanding of the causes of youth unemployment. Bessant went on to say there is no evidence that poor attitudes towards work, disorganisation or other personal deficits are the primary source of youth unemployment, rather it is the result of globalisation, the exportation of unskilled labour and increased application of labour-saving technologies in industry. From an economic perspective, Anne Hawke in Work for the Dole' - A Cheap Labour Market Program? An Economist's Perspective\\", praised the scheme for its potential, but noted that it was not fully voluntary; this would make it difficult for employers to establish whether a person had the positive workplace characteristics associated with voluntary participation, or the less desirable characteristics associated with compulsory participation. Several academics have pointed out that Work for the Dole is the embodiment of a paradigm shift in which welfare support is no longer being considered a \\"right\\", but rather \\"conditional support\\" in which unemployed people are expected to undertake their \\"mutual obligation\\". Shaver suggests this violates the assumption that all citizens are equal in the status, dignity and worth that are necessary for full participation in democratic society. Subsequent studies have investigated the impact of Work for the Dole in Australian society and found that because it compels or contracts individuals to contribute, it \\"may actually weaken their long-term commitment to society\\", while another has suggested it may be discriminatory because it was found to benefit men but not women. A 2013 examination of Department of Employment data revealed the program is one of the least effective ways to help people find jobs. Work for the Dole has also been criticised by the Australian Council for Social Services. The Australian Greens do not support the program, describing it as cruel and punitive. In 2015, ahead of reforms to the scheme which were implemented in July, Prime Minister Tony Abbott was criticised by sections of the media and other politicians for characterising the Work for the Dole scheme as an opportunity for employers to \\"try before they buy\\". The 2016 ANU's Social Research Centre review found that 2% of participants had gained employment since the latest iteration of the scheme was implemented. The Welfare Rights Centre and the Australian Council of Social Service both responded that the scheme was expensive and failed to deliver value for money.Heath Aston, (15 February 2016), Work for the dole is inefficient and unreasonable and should be dismantled: ACOSS, Sydney Morning Herald.

The sect has also found its way into martial arts films such as King of Beggars. The sect's members are mostly beggars as its name suggests, but some of them are from other walks of life. They are noticeable in public for their dress code and behaviour. The members adhere to a strict code of conduct and maintain the utmost respect for ranks and hierarchy. They uphold justice and help those in need through acts of chivalry. The Beggars' Sect is also one of the supporting pillars in the defence of Han Chinese society from foreign invaders. Cha, Louis. The Return of the Condor Heroes (神雕俠侶). Ming Pao, 1959. The sect has a wide network of communications and the members are reputed for their excellent information gathering skills. This is due to the sect's large size and the nature of its members, which allows them to blend into different parts of society easily. ==History== The sect was founded in the Han dynastyCha, Louis. The Legend of the Condor Heroes (神雕俠侶). Hong Kong Commercial Daily, 1957. and lasted for centuries. The sect plays significant roles in wuxia novels such as Demi-Gods and Semi-Devils (Northern Song dynasty) and the Condor Trilogy (Southern Song dynasty to Yuan dynasty). The Beggars' Sect was one of the largest and most respected martial arts sects in the wulin (martial artists' community) until the Yuan dynasty.Cha, Louis. Demi-Gods and Semi-Devils (天龍八部). Ming Pao, 1963. Its fame and popularity began to decline in the Yuan dynasty due to ill discipline among its members and incompetent leadership. ==Organisation== The sect is divided into various sections, including the \\"dirty clothing\\" section (污衣派) and the \\"clean clothing\\" section (淨衣派). The former is dominated by beggars while the latter is made up of non-beggars. It has many fenduo (分舵; branches) spread throughout the land and each of them is headed by a duozhu (舵主; branch master). Each member carries at least one pouch-like \\"bag\\" (袋子) and the number of bags he/she carries indicates his/her rank in the sect. The highest rank a member can attain is that of an elder (長老), which is second only to the chief. Elders carry nine \\"bags\\" each. The sect is headed by the chief (幫主), who represents the highest authority in the sect. Each chief is selected from a pool of nominees based on his/her prowess in martial arts, contributions to the sect, personal conduct, and popularity. The chief carries the revered Dog Beating Staff (打狗棒) as a symbol of leadership. The sect has some weird practices and customs, such as the one which allows all members to spit once on a newly elected chief as a form of salute. The Four Great Elders serve as the chief's deputies and reserve the right to strip the chief off his post if he/she fails in his/her duties. Besides, there are also elders with designated duties, such as the Elder of Discipline (執法長老), who enforces law and order in the sect. The Elder of Training (傳功長老) oversees the martial arts training of members. The sect holds monthly meetings to discuss their plans in the jianghu in a different location each time. ==Skills and martial arts== The most notable martial arts of the Beggars' Sect are the 'Eighteen Dragon-Subduing Palms' () and the 'Dog Beating Staff Technique' (). The chief is expected to have a profound mastery of both skills, especially the latter, which is only passed on from a chief to his/her successor. No other members, not including the elders, know the 'Dog Beating Staff Technique'. The sect has a battle formation known as the Dog Beating Formation (打狗陣). A typical member is usually armed with at least a wooden staff. Since members are not limited to only beggars, people from all walks of life, including scholars and soldiers, join the sect. As such, the sect's martial arts are rather diverse, since some members have learnt other forms of martial arts prior to joining the sect. For example, Wu Changfeng in Demi-Gods and Semi-Devils uses a customised saber movement while Chen Guyan carries a sack filled with poisonous creatures for use against enemies. ===Eighteen Dragon-Subduing Palms (降龍十八掌)=== # The Proud Dragon Repents (亢龙有悔) # The Dragon Soars in the Sky (飛龍在天) # The Dragon is Seen in the Fields (見龍在田) # The Swan Descends Gracefully (鴻漸於陸) # Use Not the Submerged Dragon (潛龍勿用) # Crossing Great Rivers (利涉大川) # Tremors that Shook the Land (震驚百里) # Diving into the Abyss (或躍在淵) # The Twin Dragons Fetch Water (雙龍取水) # The Divine Dragon Swishes its Tail (神龍擺尾) # A Sudden Advent (突如其來) # Timely Riding the Six Dragons (時乘六龍) # Dark Clouds but No Rain (密雲不雨) # With a Loss comes Confidence (損則有孚) # The Dragon Fights in the Wilderness (龍戰於野) # Treading on Ice (履霜冰至) # The Ram Charges into the Fence (羝羊觸藩) # Laughing Words (笑言啞啞) ===Dog Beating Staff Technique (打狗棒法)=== # A Fierce Dog Blocks the Path (惡狗攔路) # Whack Two Dogs with a Staff (棒打雙犬) # Oblique Hit on the Dog's Back (斜打狗背) # Flip the Dog Upside-down (撥狗朝天) # Retrieve the Staff from the Mastiff's Jaws (獒口奪仗) # Whack the Dog's Head with a Staff (棒打狗頭) # Reverse Jab the Dog's Bottom (反戳狗臀) # Lift the Mad Dog with the Staff (棒挑癩犬) # Squash the Dog's Back (壓扁狗背) # No Dogs Under Heaven (天下無狗) ==Notes== Category:Organizations in Wuxia fiction ","title":"Beggars' Sect"},{"id":"6208577","text":"Hattie Mae White Educational Support Center is the headquarters of the Houston Independent School District.

In 1911 General Knox was appointed the British Military Attaché in Russia.Neal Ascherson, \\"After Seven Hundred Years,\\" London Review of Books (24 May 2012), p. 8. A fluent speaker of Russian, he became a liaison officer to the Imperial Russian Army during First World War. During the October Revolution in Russia he observed the Bolsheviks taking the Winter Palace on 25 October 1917 (by the Julian or Old Style calendar, which corresponds to 7 November 1917 in the Gregorian or New Style calendar). :\\"The garrison of the Winter Palace originally consisted of about 2,000 all told, including detachments from yunker and ensign schools, three squadrons of Cossacks, a company of volunteers and a company from the Women's Battalion. :The garrison had dwindled owing to desertions, for there were no provisions and it had been practically starved for two days. There was no strong man to take command and to enforce discipline. No one had any stomach for fighting; and some of the ensigns even borrowed great coats of soldier pattern from the women to enable them to escape unobserved. :The greater part of the yunkers of the Mikhail Artillery School returned to their school, taking with them four out of their six guns. Then the Cossacks left, declaring themselves opposed to bloodshed! At 10 p.m. a large part of the ensigns left, leaving few defenders except the ensigns of the Engineering School and the company of women.\\" During the Russian Civil War, he was the head of the British Mission (Britmis) and notional Chef d'Arrière of the White Army in Siberia under Admiral Kolchak. He barely intervened in the combat operations, as Kolchak was unwilling to listen to his advice and to accept demands about a Russian Constituent Assembly after the war. In 1921 Knox published his memoirs, With the Russian Army: 1914–1917. In this book he also tells the story of heroine Elsa Brändström. At the 1924 general election, he was elected as a Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) for Wycombe, defeating the sitting Liberal MP Lady Terrington. He held his seat during the 1929 general election and through subsequent general elections, serving in the House of Commons until the 1945 general election. In 1934, Knox argued against Indian Independence by stating \\"India, diverse in races and creed and united only by Britain, is not ready for democracy.\\"S.P. Agrawal and J.C. Aggarwal,Information India : 1993–94. Global View. New Delhi : Concept, 1997. (p. 379).

He announced his retirement from the NFL in June 2018. He also worked as a National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I men's basketball referee from 1997 to 2018. Since the fall of 2018, Steratore has served as a rules analyst for CBS Sports, including the NFL on CBS, SEC on CBS, College Basketball on CBS, and CBS/Turner NCAA March Madness. Steratore entered the league as a field judge and was promoted to referee at the start of the 2006 season, one of two new referees (Jerome Boger being the other) for that season, following the retirements of Bernie Kukar and Tom White. He wore uniform number 114. Steratore was chosen to be the alternate referee of Super Bowl XLIV, which was held in Miami on February 7, 2010, and was chosen to be the referee for Super Bowl LII, played on February 4, 2018. Steratore was one of two active NFL referees (Bill Vinovich being the other) who also officiated NCAA Division I men's basketball games. ==CareerNational Football League=== Steratore took over briefly as referee during a regular-season game on December 28, 2003, between the Carolina Panthers and New York Giants after Bernie Kukar, the crew chief, was injured during a play in which he was hit in the back by the Giants' Clarence LeBlanc after a blocked punt. Steratore worked his first NFL playoff game as a referee between the Arizona Cardinals and the Carolina Panthers on January 10, 2009, at Bank of America Stadium in Charlotte, North Carolina. Exactly one year later, he refereed the Baltimore Ravens' 33–14 victory over the New England Patriots in an American Football Conference (AFC) Wild Card game at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts.Baltimore Ravens at New England Patriots, AFC Wild Card Playoff Game, Sunday, January 10, 2010 – National Football League. Steratore was involved in a controversial instant replay call during week 1 of the 2010 NFL season between the Detroit Lions and the Chicago Bears at Soldier Field in Chicago. Late in the fourth quarter, Lions receiver Calvin Johnson caught what was originally ruled as the winning touchdown for Detroit. After Steratore conferred with the officials he overturned the call to an incomplete pass, ruling that Johnson lost control of the ball while going to the ground before he \\"completed the process of completing the catch\\". Steratore was supported by the NFL and backed by its former vice president of officiating, Mike Pereira. The rule has since been referred to as the \\"Calvin Johnson rule\\". Steratore was selected as the first referee to officiate a game following the 2012 NFL referee lockout on September 27, 2012, a Thursday-night contest between the Cleveland Browns and the Baltimore Ravens. The Baltimore crowd cheered Steratore and his crew as they entered the field. Steratore was named as referee for the NFC Championship game on January 19, 2014, between the Seattle Seahawks and San Francisco 49ers. Steratore was the referee during the NFC divisional playoff game between the Dallas Cowboys and the Green Bay Packers on January 11, 2015, when a fourth-quarter, fourth-down catch by Cowboys wide receiver Dez Bryant was overturned using the \\"Calvin Johnson rule\\". The Packers challenged the call and after review, it was determined that the ball touched the ground before Bryant completed the catch. In a game on December 17, 2017 between the Dallas Cowboys and Oakland Raiders, Steratore took the controversial step of employing an index card normally used for recording penalties to assist him in determining whether the Cowboys had made the line to gain for a first down. His ruling that they had done so allowed Dallas to kick a late field goal in their 20-17 victory. Steratore was the referee for Super Bowl LII. === Retirement from NFL=== On June 22, 2018, NFL Senior Vice President of Officiating Alberto Riveron announced Steratore's retirement. ===CBS Sports and Turner Sports=== Following retirement, he joined CBS Sports as a rules analyst. CBS had not had a rules analyst on its staff since firing Mike Carey following the 2015 season. In addition to providing analysis for NFL officiating, Steratore also contributes in a similar role for the network's college football coverage, College Basketball on CBS and NCAA March Madness on CBS/TBS/TNT/truTV. Steratore is unusual in that most other networks have not used a rules analyst for basketball or for college football. ==Personal life== Steratore lives in his native Washington, Pennsylvania, a suburb of Pittsburgh. Gene has an older brother, Tony, also an NFL official, who is a back judge currently assigned to Jerome Boger's officiating crew. His father, Gene Steratore Sr., was a college football official and basketball referee.

The RFO performs under the aegis of the Muziekcentrum van de Omroep (Broadcasting Music Centre; NMBC), an umbrella organization bringing together the music departments of the various broadcasting associations affiliated to Nederlandse Publieke Omroep (Dutch Public Broadcasting). The RFO performs on NPO Radio 4 and gives public concerts in Amsterdam and Utrecht. It has also served as the orchestra for productions at De Nederlandse Opera. The RFO's programmes are decided by the above-mentioned Muziekcentrum, rather than directly by the orchestra's management and chief conductor. The current manager of the RFO is Wouter den Hond. ==History== Albert van Raalte founded the orchestra in 1945 and served as its first chief conductor. Past chief conductors have included Paul van Kempen, Bernard Haitink, Jean Fournet, Willem van Otterloo, Hans Vonk, and Sergiu Comissiona. Edo de Waart was chief conductor of the RFO from 1989 to 2004 and is now its conductor laureate. Jaap van Zweden was chief conductor and artistic director of the RFO from 2005 to 2012, and now has the title of honorair gastdirigent (honorary guest conductor, or principal guest conductor). In August 2010, the RFO announced the appointment of Markus Stenz as its eighth chief conductor, effective from the start of the 2012-2013 season, with an initial contract of three years. In October 2010, the coalition Dutch government announced plans for complete defunding of the Muziekcentrum van de Omroep by the year 2012, with the potential threat of the dissolution of the RFO. After protests, the Dutch Minister of Education, Culture and Sciences Marja van Bijsterveldt announced in December 2010 a partial restoration of funds to the NMBC at a level of €12 million-14 million. In December 2012, the RFO named Bernard Haitink as its patron, following his advocacy for the orchestra in the wake of the proposed defunding. Stenz concluded his tenure as the RFO's chief conductor in 2019. The current principal guest conductor of the RFO is James Gaffigan, since 2011. His RFO contract as principal guest conductor has most recently been extended through 2022. In March 2018, Karina Canellakis first guest-conducted the RFO, with concerts in Utrecht and Amsterdam. On the basis of this appearance, in May 2018, the RFO announced the appointment of Canellakis as its next chief conductor, effective with the 2019-2020 season, with an initial contract of 4 years. Canellakis is the first female conductor to be named chief conductor of the RFO.

It was written by Mick Jagger and Keith Richards and featured on the 1969 album of the same name. It was released as a single in Japan in February 1970. Ian Stewart plays piano on this track (his only appearance on the album) while Bill Wyman plays autoharp. The song opens with a slide piece and quickly moves into a solo acoustic guitar capo on the 3rd fret strumming the chords of A, D and E before bass, drums and piano join in, respectively. Wyman's autoharp can be heard somewhat faintly during the first verse with noticeable 'ping' sounds coming from it around the 0:40-0:50 mark but it is mostly inaudible throughout the track after the 0:55 ('she said my breasts') minute mark.

However, to Allmusic critic Richie Unterberger, the song is mainly about \\"emotional dependency,\\" with Jagger willing to accept a partner who wants to lean \\"on him for emotional support.\\" Unterberger also asserts that \\"Let It Bleed\\" may be \\"the best illustration\\" of the way the Rolling Stones make \\"a slightly sloppy approach work for them rather than against them.\\" He also praises Jagger's vocals, stating the song represents \\"one of his best vocals, with a supremely lazy approach that seems to be both affectionate and mocking at the same time.\\" ==Personnel== * Mick Jaggervocals * Keith Richardsguitar * Bill Wymanbass guitar, autoharp * Charlie Wattsdrums * Ian Stewartpiano * Ry Cooderslide guitar ==References== Category:The Rolling Stones songs Category:1969 songs Category:Songs written by Jagger/Richards Category:Song recordings produced by Jimmy Miller Category:1970 singles Category:London Records singles Category:Songs about drugs Category:Songs about sexuality ","title":"Let It Bleed (song)"},{"id":"6208614","text":"Luis Alfonso Robelo Callejas (born October 11, 1939), a Nicaraguan businessman, was the founder of the Nicaraguan Democratic Movement (MDN). He was one of the \\"moderates\\" on the five-members Junta of National Reconstruction that the Sandinistas claimed would rule Nicaragua following the overthrow of Anastasio Somoza Debayle. However, Robelo found that the real power lay with the FSLN National Directorate. After resigning from the Junta on April 22, 1981, Robelo went into exile in 1982. He brought his MDN into Edén Pastora's rebel Democratic Revolutionary Alliance. Later, he split with Pastora, and joined the United Nicaraguan Opposition (UNO) with Arturo Cruz, and Adolfo Calero of the Nicaraguan Democratic Force. After UNO's collapse, he joined the directorate of the new Contra umbrella group, the Nicaraguan Resistance. During the political turmoil, Robelo's first marriage, to Indiana Cardenal Caldera, ended in divorce. They had four children: Indiana Margarita, Luis Alfonso (who died at a year and a half old), Eliza, and Alejandra. He remarried a Costa Rican. Following the Esquipulas accord, President Oscar Arias of Costa Rica announced in January 1988 that Contra leaders could no longer live in his country. With his pregnant wife opposing a move from Costa Rica, he resigned from the directorate in early February. The post-Sandinista government of Violeta Chamorro appointed Robelo to be ambassador to Costa Rica.

The railway bridge was to be the last link in a railway network that linked Adelaide, Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane and was a major engineering feat at the time. The original railway bridge was built in 1889 and replaced by the current bridge in 1946. The 1946 bridge was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999. ==Before the bridge== On 7 April 1887, the single track section of the Main North line was opened between Hornsby and the Hawkesbury River. Passengers and goods heading north now unloaded at the River Wharf platform on the eastern end of Long Island, transferring to the double decker, rear paddled-wheeled steamer General Gordon for a three-hour trip out to Broken Bay and up Brisbane Water to Gosford where the train service recommenced. Once the Woy Woy Tunnel was opened on 15 August 1887, the trip was considerably shortened as the boat only had to cross the river and negotiate the lower reaches of Mullet Creek to reach Mullet Creek station. ==First bridge== The Union Bridge Company of New York was awarded the contract to construct the bridge in January 1886. The railways engineer-in-chief, John Whitton, who designed and built the railway was not invited to design the bridge due to fallout from a mid 1880s enquiry into railway bridges. However, subcontractors were also involved in the actual construction work. The piers consisted of concrete below water with sandstone masonry above. The spans were assembled on Dangar Island and floated or so across to the bridge site on barges. The bridge had seven spans of each for a total length of . Five of the piers were sunk to then record depths of between below high water. The bridge officially opened on 1 May 1889. ===Load testing=== At the time, it was the longest structure to be load tested in Australia and so two distinct and separate methods were used. Firstly, optical measurements were taken of the deformation under load at the centre of each span, taken by two sets of observers positioned atop the stone piers. The second test used a water gauge to accurately measure the deformation and the amount of deflection or \\"set\\" for each span. Load testing was carried out on 24 April 1889 in the presence of various dignitaries including Henry Deane, the Assistant Engineer in Chief of the New South Wales Government Railways. During the morning, each span was tested separately by slowly running trains out onto the span, taking the required measurements, backing the train off again and retaking the measurements. This was repeated for each span but on the second span it was found that the optical readings did not match the water gauge. The cause was found to be a slow leak in a connecting pipe of the water gauge equipment. There was only one water gauge available and as the leak would become worse as the equipment was moved from span to span for each reading it was decided to abandon this method and rely wholly on the optical readings. A speed test was undertaken during the afternoon by four locomotives, coupled in two pairs. They were started off by a flagman standing above the Long Island tunnel and the trains ran across the causeway from Hawkesbury River station through the Long Island tunnel and out across the bridge at maximum speed. ===Problems arise=== Although the track on either end of the bridge was single line, the bridge itself was constructed to double track width with an eye to the future duplication of the line. This led to the undesirable practice of the bridge being used as a crossing point for trains, thus regularly subjecting the structure to maximum stress loads. The bridge showed signs of problems within 12 months and the contractors were called back to repair some faults with the piers. Through the 1920s and 1930s, many design faults and problems became evident. By 1925 the original loading of the bridge was considered inadequate and in 1925 it was decided to strengthen the deck. The work took nearly six years between 1926–31 and numerous problems were experienced with the pin- jointed construction of the trusses, which while easy to assemble were difficult to maintain and strengthen. In 1938 a severe crack in one of the piers was discovered and it became necessary to replace the entire structure. The depth of sediment had made it impossible to reach bedrock with the foundations on the southernmost pier and it seems that this was the cause of the structural faults. The amount of traffic being carried (up to 100 trains a day) during World War II made the replacement extremely urgent and prior to the new bridge being brought into operation the speed limit on the old bridge was restricted to and finally down to with tracks altered to gauntlet configuration to ensure trains could not pass. ==Second bridge== Design and construction of a replacement bridge commenced in 1939, due to concerns that the original bridge would not hold up to extra loading and traffic caused by transport demands of World War II. Work commenced on the new bridge in July 1940 and despite best efforts it was not completed until after the war finished, opening for traffic on 1 July 1946. The new bridge was positioned to the west or upstream of the original bridge and consists of eight spans in three different lengths and piers sunk to depths of up to . New tunnels were bored through Long Island to the south and Cogra Point on the northern approach. in The design, foundation work and fabrication of the new bridge were undertaken by the New South Wales Government Railways and over 500 men worked on the project, with six dying during construction. A plaque commemorating the lives lost is at the southern end of the bridge, at the northern portal of the 1946 tunnel through Long Island. The spans for the new bridge were constructed adjacent to the bridge site on the northern side of Long Island, raised to the correct height, placed onto barges and floated out to the piers at high tide. Upon completion of the new bridge, the old bridge was removed, however the sandstone capped piers remain to this day. The construction docks remain in situ. ===Issues=== In 2016, a report revealed cracking in concrete pylons as well as \\"consistent defects\\" in the steel frame of the bridge. As a result, limits are planned to be imposed on the weight capacity of freight trains crossing the bridge, pending possible strengthening of sections of the bridge to allow heavier loads. ==DescriptionBridge=== The Hawkesbury River Rail bridge is an eight truss railway bridge, supported on reinforced concrete piers, west of the remnant piers and abutments of the 1889 bridge. The bridge crosses the Hawkesbury River from Long Island to the northern shore, approximately north of Hawkesbury River Railway Station. The bridge is a steel truss railway underbridge, consisting of two trusses, two trusses and four trusses, all on concrete piers supported on caissons. The bridge is symmetrical with two short Pratt trusses at the shore lines, then two large K-trusses, with four large Pratt trusses in between. At the southern end of the bridge, adjacent to the entrance of the current concrete lined railway tunnel are two plaques on a concrete pier: one plaque commemorates the opening of the bridge on 1 July 1946 and the other commemorates the lives lost during construction. ===Construction docks=== There are three construction docks immediately west of the southern abutment of the Hawkesbury River Rail Bridge. Only one of these is in RailCorp ownership. The docks were used for the construction of the steel trusses of the 1946 bridge. They are formed from rectangular cuttings into the bedrock. Each cutting contained a barge which supported the ends and middle of each large truss as they were being built. They were then floated from this position to specific piers and raised into their permanent position. The end of the dock in RailCorp ownership (the easternmost dock) has been extended in concrete and also has a set of steps providing access from the adjacent construction terrace next to the southern abutment of the bridge. This construction terrace has two footings made from concrete and steel plate, also associated with the construction phase. Under the abutment of the 1946 bridge there is a room containing a compressor and other materials. This space has a concrete vaulted ceiling and was originally an arched opening under the abutment and subsequently infilled. ===Surviving first bridge abutments=== The southern abutment is constructed in concrete and face Hawkesbury sandstone and rises approximately above the shoreline. It is classical in detail, particularly to the side elevations with the north-facing elevation constructed in ashlar stonework. Constructed on top of the abutment is a s concrete block staff building associated with the maintenance depot. Within this 1960s structure and affixed to the top of the abutment is a large cast iron plaque which formally sat on the crest of the first span of the former rail bridge. It commemorates construction of the bridge by the Union Bridge Company. On the southern abutment there is a range of historic graffiti dating from 1901 to the present day. North from this abutment are a series of large sandstone piers within the Hawkesbury River. The deck of the former bridge has been removed. The northernmost pier is relatively close to the shore and subsequently the northern abutment is less elaborate and imposing than the southern abutment. Immediately to the north of the southernmost abutment, but slightly off alignment, is a concrete footing on the shoreline at the mean high water mark, which may have been linked to construction of the former or current bridges. == Heritage listing == The current and former Hawkesbury River Rail Bridges have State heritage significance. It forms part of a railway precinct of exceptional significance, with elements in an outstanding setting that represent key events in the history of railway development in NSW and demonstrate high levels of engineering achievement and the changes in railway technology in NSW in the period between the 1880s and 1970s. The completion of the 1886 Hawkesbury River Railway Bridge saw the linkage not only of the significant Sydney to Newcastle Railway link but also in effect, the railway systems of South Australia, Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland were joined by continuous rail with the opening of the bridge. The Bridge was used by Sir Henry Parkes as a powerful symbol of Federation and he gave the address at the opening of the bridge, which has been claimed by some as his first Federation speech. The abutments and piers of the bridge as well as the 1886 Long Island tunnel are tangible reminders of these significant events and the symbolic power they had for people at the time not only in NSW but throughout Australia. Both the 1889 and 1946 bridges and associated infrastructure on Long Island also demonstrate the significant investment in the railway system of NSW in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The workmanship of both bridges demonstrates the significant pride and confidence in the railways at the time. The surviving sandstone elements of the former Hawkesbury River Bridge and the current Bridge have exceptional aesthetic value in their setting on the Hawkesbury River. The contrast of the man-made bridges and tunnels with the rugged and beautiful natural landscape of Hawkesbury River allows passengers and visitors to appreciate the engineering achievements of the railway line's construction. The vantage point of the approach to Long Island and the bridge also allows passengers to appreciate views of the natural landscape. Both of these factors have made the railway journey a destination in itself for generations of rail passengers. The 1889 Hawkesbury River Bridge, Long Island Tunnel, Woy Woy Tunnel and the heavy earthworks and tunnels of the Cowan bank were the key engineering works on the Sydney to Newcastle rail link (The Short North). Together they demonstrate a high degree of engineering achievement in building a railway line in difficult and dangerous terrain. The 1889 Hawkesbury River Bridge in particular was a major technical achievement at the time: it was the fourth largest bridge constructed in the world, one of its caissons reached 49m, had the deepest bridge footing in the world and it was the longest bridge in Australia, pushing bridge design and construction techniques to the limit. The bridge was also the first of the American designed truss bridges that were introduced to Australia in the late 1880s and 1890s and thus the first to utilise the American principles of lightweight bracing, pin joints and eye bar tension members. It was the only steel trussed bridge of its type in Australia when it was built and the first major use of steel for bridges with previous examples being built in wrought iron. Its remains are tangible evidence of the change in engineering technology from British to American at this time and the decline of John Whitton's British based design influence on the NSW railway system. There is enough extant fabric in the remaining abutments, piers and the Long Island tunnel to demonstrate the engineering achievements of the original Hawkesbury River crossing. The 1946 railway bridge was also a major technical achievement at the time of its construction, its large riveted steel trusses and its footings were still among the deepest in the world. It remains the longest purpose built rail bridge in the NSW network. The bridge itself as well as the remnant construction docks, platform and power station demonstrate the technical achievements in the construction of the bridge. The docks in particular provide direct evidence for the method of construction and the challenges associated with construction in this estuarine environment. Hawkesbury River Railway Bridge was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999. == Engineering heritage award == The bridge is listed as a National Engineering Landmark by Engineers Australia as part of its Engineering Heritage Recognition Program. == Gallery == Hawkesbury River Railway Bridges 1st & 2nd circa 1945.jpgOriginal and replacement under construction, Bridges over the Hawkesbury River (3126974784).jpgFirst and second bridges side by side NSWGR AD60 Class Locomotive.jpgSecond bridge - a pylon from the first bridge can be seen in the background ==See also== *Historic bridges of New South Wales *List of railway bridges in New South Wales ==References Attribution =* * Category:Bridges completed in 1889 Category:Bridges completed in 1946 Category:Hawkesbury River Category:Railway bridges in New South Wales Category:Transport on the Central Coast (New South Wales) Category:1889 establishments in Australia Category:Brooklyn, New South Wales Category:Central Coast Council (New South Wales) Category:Main North railway line, New South Wales Category:New South Wales State Heritage Register Category:Works of John Whitton Category:1946 establishments in Australia Category:Recipients of Engineers Australia engineering heritage markers Category:Truss bridges in Australia ","title":"Hawkesbury River railway bridge"},{"id":"6208651","text":"Benjamin Turner \\"Ben\\" Ramsey (December 28, 1903 – March 27, 1985) was a Texas politician who served in a succession of offices during the mid-20th century. He served in both Houses of the Texas Legislature, as secretary of state, 34th Lieutenant Governor, and as member of the Texas Railroad Commission. Ramsey was born on December 28, 1903, in San Augustine in San Augustine County in east Texas, the son of William Charles and Emma Jenkins Ramsey. He attended San Augustine public schools and worked on the family farm. After finishing high school, he worked three years in his father's law and abstract office, then enrolled at the University of Texas at Austin. He passed the state bar examination before graduation and was licensed to practice law in 1931. Ramsey was elected to the Texas House of Representatives and served two terms. Afterward he returned to San Augustine to practice law with his brother for five years. In 1940, he was elected to the first of two four-year terms to the Texas State Senate. He became a Senate leader in anti-deficit legislation and legislation to regulate labor unions. In 1949, Governor Beauford H. Jester chose Ramsey to be Texas Secretary of State. In 1950, Ramsey resigned from the position before being elected to statewide office as Lieutenant Governor of Texas and was re-elected in 1952, 1954, 1956, 1958, and 1960 for six two-year terms. When Governor Allan Shivers's conservative branch of Texas Democrats clashed with the state's more liberal Democrats, led by U.S. Senate Majority Leader (and future U.S. President) Lyndon B. Johnson and U.S. House Speaker Samuel T. Rayburn of Texas, the two factions agreed to support Ramsey as a member of the National Democratic Committee. In fiscal affairs, especially opposition to higher taxes, Ramsey was considered conservative. Despite this, he supported Governor Shivers in raising revenue necessary for higher teachers' pay, state hospitals, and prisons. Like Shivers, he was an enemy of labor unions. He strongly supported rural electrification, water conservation and development, paving of farm roads, and stricter laws regulation what he called \\"fly-by-night insurance companies.\\" On September 18, 1961, he resigned from the lieutenant governorship in the middle of his sixth term in office, after being appointed by Governor Price Daniel to the Texas Railroad Commission. The next year, he was elected to the unexpired term and in 1964 and 1970, was re-elected to full six-year terms. He served three two-year terms as chairman. Just before his appointment to the commission, Texas was successful in achieving control over offshore oil (see Tidelands controversy), and Ramsey helped composed the rules for Texas coastal drilling. He chose not to run for re-election to a third six-year term in 1976 and retired from public office in 1977 following 26 years in statewide elected office. Ramsey was married to Florine Hankla of San Augustine, and the couple had three daughters, Rita, Ann and MariBen. He died on March 27, 1985 and was buried in San Augustine. ==External links== * *Biographical sketch by Bob Bowman Category:1903 births Category:1985 deaths Category:Lieutenant Governors of Texas Category:Members of the Texas House of Representatives Category:Secretaries of State of Texas Category:Texas Democrats Category:Texas state senators Category:20th-century American politicians Category:People from San Augustine, Texas ","title":"Ben Ramsey"},{"id":"6208661","text":"RiffTrax is an American company that produces scripted humorous audio commentary tracks intended to be played in unison with particular television programs and films, featuring comedians Michael J. Nelson, Kevin Murphy, and Bill Corbett and others. The three comedians' commentating style originated from their earlier television series, Mystery Science Theater 3000 (MST3K), in which they would similarly mock (or \\"riff\\") films aloud while watching them. RiffTrax products are sold online and delivered by app, streaming video, and DRM-free download. It is also featured on Pluto TV, Twitch, and a channel on Samsung TV. ==History== The site was launched by Nelson and Legend Films in 2006 and is based in San Diego. In 2012, RiffTrax was purchased from Legend by Michael J. Nelson, Kevin Murphy, Bill Corbett and RiffTrax CEO David G. Martin. As of December 2014, RiffTrax had 13 employees. The movies chosen for Mystery Science Theater 3000 were predominantly low-budget B-movies because the show itself was low budget and producers could only afford films that had either its copyright expired or that had otherwise cheap licenses. The idea of RiffTrax came about after Mystery Science Theater 3000 was canceled and Nelson had researched and consulted a lawyer about the possibility of directly releasing DVDs of films with the commentaries included. But Nelson realized this initial idea was not feasible since he would be \\"sued out of existence.\\" Instead, the best way to distribute the commentaries would be to sell them independently of the films, to avoid having to obtain the rights to distribute the movies themselves. There would be no legal or monetary restrictions to prevent Nelson from producing them, though viewers would have to provide the movies themselves. Mike Nelson, Bill Corbett, and Kevin Murphy The early RiffTrax were almost all solo efforts on Mike's part, but it soon became apparent that there was a strong demand for them, and Nelson was quickly able to recruit more riffers for the project. Most official RiffTrax (not counting fan-made iRiffs and the spin-off RiffTrax Presents series) have a stable cast of Mike and former Mystery Science Theater 3000 co-stars Kevin Murphy and Bill Corbett, a line-up that is identical to that of The Film Crew and the three SciFi Channel seasons of MST3K. That said, the guest slots vary often; other MST3K alumni have been featured, such as Mary Jo Pehl and Bridget Nelson, in addition to Internet personalities Richard Kyanka (of Something Awful fame), Josh Fruhlinger (writer of The Comics Curmudgeon) and Chad Vader, as well as actors Neil Patrick Harris, Fred Willard, and Joel McHale, and parodist \\"Weird Al\\" Yankovic. Nelson has said that he would like to bring in other guests. The enthusiasm of guest riffers for the project led to the establishment of RiffTrax Presents, a series of tracks exclusively hosted by guest riffers and sanctioned by Nelson. The success of the guest format is such that \\"Three Riffer Editions\\" of some films previously solo riffed by Mike have been produced for the VOD service, which feature new riffs by Mike in conjunction with Murphy and Corbett, and Mike has ceased producing solo riffs since 2007. Most recent works created by Rifftrax are crafted by a small team of writers; longer works are divided into 20 to 30 minute sections for each writer to rewatch and develop riffs for before assembling the entire work. Rifftrax continues to release audio track riffs that can be used to play over the owner's own copy of a film as well as making versions friendly for films offered on online streaming services like Netflix. They have also since expanded to produce full length video-on-demand riffs for films that have entered the public domain or otherwise have been licensed cheaply, such as Night of the Living Dead and Santa Claus Conquers the Martians. Along with the feature length tracks, Corbett, Murphy and Nelson have created riffs for a number of short films, typically educational and safety films, similar to the shorts presented before features on Mystery Science Theater 3000. These include films by the Jam Handy Organization, Alfred P. Higgins Productions, Coronet Films and ACI Films, amongst others. Because these shorts are in the public domain, they can be downloaded with the commentary already recorded onto them. Shorts are usually released at least once, and often twice, a week In 2008, RiffTrax launched iRiffs, which allows fans to upload commentaries to be sold on the website. iRiffs users are paid 50% of the net revenue generated by their products. iRiffs differentiates from normal RiffTrax in that both serious and humorous commentaries can be uploaded. In February 2009, a contest was held by RiffTrax, in which a winning iRiffs user would be given $1,000 and a chance to develop a RiffTrax Presents title, receiving instruction and critique from Nelson, Murphy and Corbett. The winners of the contest were Doug Walker, Rob Walker and Brian Heinz of That Guy with the Glasses, who contributed an iRiff of The Lion King. The RiffTrax commentary they produced was for Batman Forever.Walker, Doug (2 August 2009). RiffTrax: Batman Forever announcement. ThatGuyWiththeGlasses.com. In October 2015, Rifftrax negotiated the rights to release available Mystery Science Theater 3000 episodes through Vimeo via an all-access subscription plan, with a new re-release uploaded each Monday; individual episodes could also be rented through the site, and in November 2015, RiffTrax also started to sell Mystery Science Theater 3000 episodes on their website. The RiffTrax.com releases contain a newly recorded introduction on each episode by either Michael J. Nelson, Bill Corbett, Kevin Murphy, or Bridget Nelson and Mary Jo Pehl. A substantial percentage from the episode sales on the RiffTrax website goes to the cast members of MST3K. On July 20, 2018, RiffTrax celebrated its twelfth anniversary. ===Live shows=== Birdemic As part of SF Sketchfest in San Francisco, California, Nelson, Murphy, and Corbett have appeared several times performing live riffs alongside a screening of a film. As of 2008, they have appeared three times, having riffed Daredevil and Over the Top (1987) in 2007 and Plan 9 from Outer Space in 2008, the last being shown in the historic Castro Theater. The RiffTrax crew have done live internet broadcasts on Ustream.tv, riffing public domain films and taking viewer questions. RiffTrax has teamed with NCM Fathom Events to host special one-night live RiffTrax events. Nelson, Corbett, and Murphy, along with special guests, perform their riffing to a live audience in one theater, which is simultaneously broadcast live to select theaters around the country, except in the Pacific Time zone, where a replay of the broadcast is shown. The first show was performed live at the Belcourt Theatre in Nashville, Tennessee on August 20, 2009, where Mike, Kevin, and Bill riffed Plan 9 from Outer Space, along with the short film Flying Stewardess and guest appearances by Veronica Belmont, Jonathan Coulton, and Rich Kyanka of Something Awful. An encore showing was shown on October 8 of that year. The second RiffTrax Live! show in theaters took place on December 16, 2009, where they riffed several Christmas short films, one featuring special guest Weird Al Yankovic. An encore showing was shown in theaters the next day. The third RiffTrax Live! show took place on August 19, 2010, with the trio riffing the cult classic Reefer Madness (its encore showing took place on August 24). A fourth live show riffing House on Haunted Hill, also filmed at the Belcourt, occurred on October 28, 2010, with special guest Paul F. Tompkins. A fifth took place on August 17, 2011, featuring the film Jack the Giant Killer. with the short What Is Nothing and two short videos created by SomethingAwful.com A sixth took place on August 16, 2012, featuring the film, Manos, The Hands of Fate. A seventh live event took place on October 25, 2012, featuring Birdemic: Shock and Terror. The live event featuring Starship Troopers took place on August 15, 2013. The ninth live event featuring Night of the Living Dead was performed on October 24, 2013 . On February 25, 2013, RiffTrax announced a Kickstarter campaign to raise money to secure the rights to riff Twilight, the first film of The Twilight Saga, for their live show in August 2013. Although the Kickstarter was successful, RiffTrax could not work a deal to secure the rights to Twilight and they, instead, used the funding to secure Starship Troopers. On May 12, 2014, RiffTrax announced another Kickstarter campaign to raise money to secure the rights to the 1998 version of Godzilla. The Kickstarter raised the goal of $100,000 within a day. On May 29, they announced a stretch goal of $250,000 to secure the rights to Anaconda for their Halloween show; the goal was reached on June 10, the day before the Kickstarter's end. For 2015, RiffTrax repeated the Kickstarter approach, successfully funding its four-movie event for the year, dubbed \\"The Crappening\\". The successful Kickstarter allowed them to riff on The Room, Sharknado 2: The Second One, Miami Connection, and Santa and the Ice Cream Bunny at different live events throughout the year. The Rifftrax riff of The Room will also be performed live during the 2015 Tribeca Film Festival's series of midnight special events. For 2016, RiffTrax used a Kickstarter campaign to successfully fund their events for the year, meeting their initial goal of $225,000 within four days after the start of the campaign, with $620,999 as the total amount raised. The first event was a riffing of the film Time Chasers on May 5, 2016 and used a high definition remaster of the film provided by its director, David Giancola. The second event was a Mystery Science Theater 3000 cast member reunion on June 28, 2016, and took place in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The format of the reunion was similar to RiffTrax's SF Sketchfest \\"Night of the Shorts\\" shows, using various educational shorts as riffing material. Alongside Nelson, Corbett, and Murphy, the guests were fellow MST3K cast members Joel Hodgson, Bridget Nelson, Mary Jo Pehl, Trace Beaulieu, Frank Conniff, and Jonah Ray.> The third event for 2016 was Toho's 1961 Kaiju classic Mothra on August 18, 2016 and featured a brand new widescreen print. The fourth RiffTrax event was the horror classic Carnival of Souls and took place on October 27, 2016. The print used was the 78 minute colorized version of the film previously released on DVD by Legend Films. For 2017, RiffTrax again used a Kickstarter campaign to successfully fund their events for the year, meeting their initial goal of $250,000 on March 8, 2017, sixteen days into the Kickstarter campaign. The first event was a new riff of Samurai Cop, on April 13, 2017. The second event was the \\"Summer Shorts Beach Party\\" on June 15, 2017. The format of the show was similar to the shorts shows from the SF Sketchfest \\"Night of the Shorts\\" and the MST3K Reunion Show. Alongside Nelson, Corbett, and Murphy, the guest riffers were Bridget Nelson, Mary Jo Pehl, Trace Beaulieu, Frank Conniff, and Paul F. Tompkins. The third event was the Doctor Who special The Five Doctors, held on August 17, 2017; which, for legal reasons, RiffTrax could not reveal this until the RiffTrax Kickstarter campaign had officially ended. RiffTrax had been wanting to do a Doctor Who episode for some time as a way to bridge into its fandom, but had to get permission from the BBC. The BBC had been hesitant, fearing that the nature of RiffTrax may have been mean-spirited, but after seeing some of Rifftrax's work, agreed to the use, feeling it would help promote Doctor Who in America. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, the normal live riffing shows had to be cancelled, but Rifftrax experimented with live virtual shows, using films available on Netflix and the Scener app to which viewed paid for watch the event through. These shows included riffs on the first episode of Stranger Things in July 2020, and the film Starship Troopers in September 2020. The list of live Rifftrax shows are: {  - ! Date !!

Each episode is one hour long featuring the three riffing on older National Geographic footage. According to Nelson, the idea for the series came from a National Geographic producer who was also a fan of RiffTrax. RiffTrax and National Geographic worked together to find the best footage to use. In 2015, three additional episodes of \\"Total Riff Off\\" were created (two as 2015 RiffTrax Live Kickstarter rewards), which were also later available for purchase as video-on-demand on the RiffTrax website. ==The Rifftones== In August 2008, Nelson, Corbett and Murphy formed a musical trio named The Rifftones, initially to compete in Quick Stop Entertainment's second Masters of Song Fu competition. They won the competition, beating fellow musicians Jonathan Coulton, Paul and Storm and, in the final round, Jason Morris. After the competition, they decided to continue creating songs as The Rifftones, making songs based on the movies they've riffed and releasing a CD collecting them, which is available on the RiffTrax site. ==Use== RiffTrax commentaries are synchronized at the start of the movie using a cue. To reassure consumers that the MP3 file is synchronized with the film, fictional character and riffer \\"DisembAudio\\" speaks occasional lines in exact synchronization with the movie. \\"RiffTrax Presents\\" commentaries feature a female synchronization voice, Debbie. Though RiffTrax are suggested to be played on an MP3 player or with computer software, they are sold as unrestricted MP3s, allowing users to choose the viewing method that suits them the best. A RiffTrax Player is also offered as a free download for Windows computers. The movies chosen for RiffTrax are based on two criteria: whether the movie lends itself towards a funny riffing, and whether the film is widely available on DVD. These criteria have resulted in a wide variety of genre and era of movies chosen to be riffed. The first audio commentary made available through the web site in July 2006 was for the 1989 film Road House, long cited by Nelson as the cheesiest movie ever made. ===RiffTrax Player=== The RiffTrax Player (RiffPlayer) is a program which automatically synchronizes the commentary playback to the DVD playback. The RiffTrax Player makes use of a commentary MP3 as well as a text file (.sync) containing the synchronization information of the DVD and the commentary. , the RiffTrax Player currently supports Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X Snow Leopard and up. ===RiffTrax On Demand=== RiffTrax On Demand features downloadable DRM-free video files of films with RiffTrax commentaries embedded. RiffTrax On Demand has released many short, public domain, and educational films similar to the ones that MST3K would sometimes mock before a full-length movie began. ==Featured catalogReferences * Category:Mystery Science Theater 3000 Category:Internet properties established in 2006 ","title":"RiffTrax"},{"id":"6208677","text":"The Henry Kuttner deities are supernatural entities created by horror writer Henry Kuttner for the Cthulhu Mythos universe of shared fiction. ==The Hydra== > There are innumerable tales of multi-headed monsters, all springing from the > actual entity of whose real existence a few have known through the ages. > This creature did not originate on earth, but in the gulfs Outside.

A multitude of living heads, some human and some alien, sprout from the ooze, sobbing and grimacing as if in great agony. The Hydra's worshippers trick others into sending the god sacrifices through a pamphlet known as On the Sending Out of the Soul. The last page contains a magical formula for astral projection. When followed, the formula always works as expected, harmlessly transporting the user in astral form to whatever destination is desired. However, unbeknownst to the user, the ritual also brings the subject into contact with the Hydra, which then merges with the individual's astral self, using it as a host. Anyone present where the astral traveler appears is decapitated, the victim's head taken to become part of the Hydra. Afterwards, the astral traveler is returned safely to his or her original body, suffering no ill effects, except perhaps receiving a terrible shock from the grisly scene so witnessed.Henry Kuttner, \\"Hydra\\", The Azathoth Cycle, pp. 50-63. ==Iod== When this entity is summoned, the invoker must have precautions or he will suffer a \\"swift & terrible doom\\". Iod will pursue the summoner, across alien dimensions if need be, and, upon catching him will suck out his spirit, leaving the soul trapped in the dead body, unable to move. Iod has been described (The description is from \\"The Hunt\\") \\"..it partook hideously of incongruous elements. Strange mineral and crystal formations sent their fierce glow through squamous, semi-transparent flesh... A thin slime dripped from membranous flesh...and as this slime floated down, hideous plantlike appendages writhed blindly in the air, making hungry little sucking noises. \\"...A great faceted eye watched ...and the ropeless tentacle began to uncoil purposefully...\\".The victim will feel unendurable cold and pain, and hear a brief whistling, as Iod draws out his spirit. ==Nyogtha== > Men knew him as the Dweller in Darkness, that brother of the Old Ones called > Nyogtha, the Thing that should not be.

According to the story, the Necronomicon refers to Nyogtha as \\"the Dweller in Darkness\\"—an epithet used by August Derleth in the story of the same name to refer to Nyarlathotep; thus, it may be that Nyogtha is yet another of Nyarlathotep's nigh-endless avatars. Nyogtha appears as a shapeless, dark mass. In his short story \\"Path of Corruption,\\" Steve Berman has a group of New Orleans-based hustlers worshipping Nyogtha. In the 1965 horror film Dark Intruder Nyogtha is mentioned towards the end as part of an inocation uttered by Professor Malaki to various demons, along with Goetic demons such as Astaroth and Asmodeus. ==Vorvadoss== Vorvadoss (The Flaming One, Lord of the Universal Spaces, The Troubler of the Sands, He Who Waits in the Outer Dark) first appeared in Kuttner's \\"The Eater of Souls\\". He appears as a cloaked, hooded being, enveloped in green flames, with fiery eyes. He may otherwise appear as a misty, silvery being with an inhuman face. He also appears in Kuttner's \\"The Invaders\\". In the Call of Cthulhu role-playing game, Vorvadoss is classified as an Elder God. ==Zushakon== Zushakon (or Zuchequon or Zul-Che-Quon) debuted in Kuttner's short story \\"Bells of Horror\\" (1939). The being is the son of Ubbo-Sathla, procreated by binary fission. Other sources, however, consider him the progeny of Shub-Niggurath and Hastur. Zushakon is the god of death to the Mutsun tribe of California. Zushakon has an intense hatred of light and will slay anyone who exposes one of his sacred artifacts to it. He can be summoned by the ringing of three specially consecrated bells. His arrival is heralded by the rapid darkening and chilling of the surrounding environment and the sound of flapping, as if produced by very large wings, steadily increasing in volume. Furthermore, all creatures nearby suffer an irritation of the eyes that is so severe, they are compelled to literally gouge them out. Upon his arrival, the surrounding shadows darken, thicken, swirl, and finally clot into his dreadful shape. It is not known whether the clot of darkness that forms is merely a gateway or the actual entity himself. According to the famed occult detective Doctor Anton Zarnak, who witnessed Zushakon's arrival during an unsuccessful attempt to exorcise him from a client, Zushakon is an earth elemental, and can be repelled by bright lights or by summoning the fire god Cthugha. The unfortunate victim, who died during the struggle, had dug up a mound that contained the remains of a Mutsun shaman. Inside, he found an obsidian tablet and a carving of a hooded, possibly winged, humanoid figure surrounded by toad-like beings prostrate in worship before it. Inscribed on the tablet was an ancient, now- extinct script promising death to anyone who exposed the contents of the barrow. It is very likely that the winged figure in the carving is Zushakon himself. After he departs, Zushakon may return yet again during the first earthquake or solar eclipse following an earlier, successful summoning of him. ==References== Kuttner deities, Henry Category:Lists of fictional deities ","title":"Henry Kuttner deities"},{"id":"6208678","text":"Cezary Trybański (born September 22, 1979) is a Polish basketball player.

He became prominent in politics during the Sandinista (FSLN) era. After repeatedly resigning from positions in protest, opinion divided between those who lauded him as a statesman and man of principle, and those who derided him as an ineffectual hand-wringer. ==Somoza opponent== Cruz grew up in Jinotepe, Nicaragua. His father Arturo Cruz Sánchez despised Anastasio Somoza García, despite the family's traditional Liberal loyalties. Cruz graduated from the military academy in 1944, but refused his commission rather than serve Somoza's dictatorship. He went on to attend Georgetown University in the United States. Cruz participated in a 1947 coup plot against Somoza, for which he was imprisoned for four months. After joining the April Rebellion of 1954, together with his brother-in-law, Adolfo Báez Bone, and Pedro Joaquín Chamorro Cardenal, he was jailed again for about a year,Cruz, Jr.: 34 says fourteen months, but Kinzer:224 and another source says eleven months. while Báez was executed. However, his wife persuaded him not to join Edmundo and Fernando \\"El Negro\\" Chamorro in their November 1960 rising, which included an attack on the Jinotepe barracks. He would avoid rebel politics for nearly two decades. In 1969, Cruz became an official at the Inter-American Development Bank in Washington, D.C.. There, he was approached by the FSLN in 1977. He became a member of Los Doce, the Group of Twelve establishment figures who voiced support for the Sandinista struggle against dictator Anastasio Somoza Debayle. Their backing of the Sandinistas' popular front convinced many Nicaraguans that the FSLN's appeal had broadened beyond its communist roots, and moved the country towards the full-scale insurrection that toppled the régime in July 1979. ==Sandinista opponent== Cruz was appointed head of the Central Bank of Nicaragua in post-Somoza Nicaragua. When the non-communist moderates resigned from the Junta of National Reconstruction in April 1980, after finding that the real power lay with the FSLN National Directorate, he joined the Junta as a replacement moderate on May 18. He too became frustrated with his impotence, but agreed to leave gracefully by becoming ambassador to the United States. The arrangement was announced on March 4, 1981. Cruz continued to clash with Sandinista policies, and resigned as ambassador in November 1981, returning to the IADB. However, he was a major ghostwriter for the speech delivered by Sandinista hero Edén Pastora at his press conference of April 15, 1982, in which Pastora declared his break with the FSLN National Directorate. Pastora's speech helped convince his son, Arturo Cruz, Jr., who was not then aware of his father's role, to also move from supporting the Sandinistas to joining Pastora's camp. When the Sandinistas announced in January 1984 that they would hold elections in November, the right-wing opposition umbrella group, the Coordinadora Democrática Nicaragüense, settled on Cruz as the only candidate acceptable to all factions. However, in the end he boycotted the election, saying it would not be free and fair. Years later he admitted that his decision not to run was a mistake and that he was on the payroll of the CIA. quoted in Afterwards, Cruz drifted deeper into the politics of the rebel Contras. He was a primary drafter of the San José Declaration of March 1, 1985, signed by many rebel leaders. The declaration evolved into the formation of the rebel umbrella group United Nicaraguan Opposition (UNO) on June 12, with Alfonso Robelo and the Nicaraguan Democratic Force's Adolfo Calero. However, with Calero's FDN comprising the great majority of UNO's forces, he found himself in another figurehead position. He continually threatened to resign unless he and Robelo were given real power. Despite Calero's eventual resignation in February 1987, he quit anyway on March 9. In 1999, he issued a statement asking the United States and Honduran governments to release all information about the death of his nephew, David Arturo Báez Cruz, a naturalized American citizen and former Green Beret who returned to Nicaragua to serve in Sandinista military intelligence, and died while acting as a military advisor with Honduran guerrillas. ==References== *Chamorro, Violeta Barrios de.

It is synonomous with Classical liberalism. Sartori imported the term from Italian in order to distinguish between social liberalism, which is generally considered a political ideology often advocating extensive government intervention in the economy, and those liberal theories of economics which propose to virtually eliminate such intervention. In informal usage, liberism overlaps with other concepts such as free trade, neoliberalism, right-libertarianism, the American concept of libertarianism and the laissez-faire doctrine of the French liberal Doctrinaires. Croce claims that \\"Liberalism can prove only a temporary right of private propriety of land and industries.\\"(Croce-Einaudi, 1988, p.139) The intention of Croce (and of Sartori) to attack the right to private property and to free enterprise separating them from the general philosophy of Liberalism (that is primarily a theory of natural rights), was always criticised openly by the quoted philosophers and by some of the main representatives of liberalism, such as Luigi Einaudi and Friederick Von Hayek. and the Nobel Prize winners' Milton Friedman (1976) and Friedrich von Hayek (1974). The differences between the economical concept of liberismI sostenitori dell'esistenza di una dottrina liberista la attribuiscono ad Adam Smith e al suo saggio La Ricchezza delle Nazioni, laddove questi utilizzò il termine \\"liberal policy\\" un paio di volte per indicare il commercio privo di dazi. Smith non vedeva di buon occhio l'assenza di regolamentazione statale, infatti dichiarò: «Raramente la gente dello stesso mestiere si ritrova insieme, anche se per motivi di svago e di divertimento, senza che la conversazione risulti in una cospirazione contro i profani o in un qualche espediente per far alzare i prezzi». and the economical consequences of the liberalismLa lingua francese parla di libéralisme politique e libéralisme économique (quest'ultimo chiamato anche laissez-faire, lett. lasciate fare), lo spagnolo di liberalismo social e liberalismo económico.

He was born and raised in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. ==High School Career and College Recruitment== A 6'7\\" forward, Banks attended high school in West Philadelphia. Nicknamed \\"Tinkerbell,\\" Banks was named to high school All-American teams his last three years of high school. By his senior year, he was considered one of the best players in the country, along with such players as Albert King and Magic Johnson. Banks was voted MVP of the 1977 Dapper Dan and named to the inaugural McDonald's All American team; there was not yet a designated McDonald's game, but Banks was named MVP when the McDonald's team played in the 1977 Capital Classic. Banks' decision to attend Duke University surprised close observers of amateur basketball. Recruited by virtually all colleges with major basketball programs, Banks was widely expected to choose to play for a winning program with a record of recruiting black players. UCLA and Villanova were considered the favorites. Banks has said that the only reason he even went on a recruiting visit to Duke was that a high school teacher had repeatedly emphasized Duke's academic opportunities. At the same time, Duke was a southern, small-town college that had never successfully recruited an elite black basketball player. In addition, while the Blue Devils had been to 3 Final Fours in the 1960s, the basketball program had been floundering and had just finished a losing season in which it finished last in the Atlantic Coast Conference. ===College Basketball Career=== At Duke, Banks started as a freshman alongside such players as Mike Gminski, Jim Spanarkel, and Kenny Dennard. After finishing last in the conference the prior year, the Blue Devils were ranked in the top 10 by the end of the regular season. Qualifying for the NCAA tournament for the first time in a dozen years, the Blue Devils reached the championship game in 1978, losing to Kentucky, 94-88. During that rookie season, Banks became the first Duke freshman to record a triple double and was named the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) Rookie of the Year. Banks' teams never again made it to the Final Four, though they did qualify for the NCAA tournament during two of the next three years. The team's overall record during his 4 years was 90-37. During the course of his 4 year Duke career, Banks averaged 16.8 points, 7.9 rebounds, and shot 53% from the field. During those final three seasons, Banks was named team MVP each year. During his senior season, playing for Mike Krzyzewski, Banks won the ACC scoring title over such players as James Worthy and Ralph Sampson. He was named to All American teams after two of his seasons. Banks is widely seen as a crucial recruit as Duke slowly transitioned into the world of integrated college basketball. While the sixth African American player in Duke's history, he was the school's first Black All American, setting the stage for Coach Krzyzewski's later recruiting success. Banks received his BA in English from Duke in May 1981, where he was one of the two graduation speakers selected from the student body. ===Professional Basketball=== Banks played six seasons and 468 games in the National Basketball Association. Competing for with the San Antonio Spurs and the Chicago Bulls, he averaged 11.3 points per game. His career high of 44 points was achieved against the Los Angeles Lakers in 1983. He recorded his first NBA triple-double with the Chicago Bulls. In the 1988–89 season, Banks played in Italy for Arimo Bologna. He went from Italy to continue his career as a member of the Maccabi Rishon Lezion basketball club in Israel. In 1993, he continued his play in Israel as a member of Hapoel Herzliya and took them to the Israeli Cup Championship game. Between these stints, Banks played the 1989–90 season with the La Crosse Catbirds of the Continental Basketball Association (CBA), averaging 15.3 points in 40 games.

His apprentices, followers and younger generations call him \\"Qigong\\" (\\"Grandpa Qi\\") to show their respect for him as an elder and their affection for him as a grandfatherly figure. is a fictional character in the wuxia novel The Legend of the Condor Heroes and its sequel, The Return of the Condor Heroes, by Jin Yong. Best known for his most powerful martial arts (the 'Eighteen Dragon-Subduing Palms' and the 'Dog Beating Staff Technique'), Hong Qigong is the chief of the Beggars' Sect and the \\"Northern Beggar\\" of the Five Greats. He is nicknamed \\"Nine Fingered Divine Beggar\\" after he severs one of his fingers to remind himself to be more time conscious as he has once failed a mission after overindulgence in fine cuisine. He plays a supporting role in the first novel by imparting his skills to Guo Jing and Huang Rong. Huang Rong succeeds him as the Beggars' Sect's chief. Although he appears as a happy-go-lucky old beggar who idles his time away, he actually uses his skills to help those in need and perform chivalrous deeds. ==In The Legend of the Condor Heroes== Little is known of Hong's past, except that he once mentioned that he was a slave of Jurchen officials in the Jin Empire before he joined the Beggars' Sect. He cut off his right forefinger in remorse after failing a mission, which cost a righteous man's life, because of his overindulgence in fine cuisine. Hong Qigong makes his first appearance in the novel during Guo Jing and Huang Rong's first adventure. Huang Rong is preparing a Beggar's Chicken and the fragrant scent titillates Hong Qigong's senses. He appears and asks to taste the food. Huang Rong examines his physical appearance closely, sees his Dog Beating Staff and missing finger, and concludes that he is the \\"Northern Beggar\\". Huang Rong asks Hong Qigong to teach Guo Jing martial arts. In return, she prepares fine cuisine every day for him. Hong Qigong succumbs to the temptation of delicious food and stays for almost a month with them. During that period of time, he teaches Guo Jing the 'Eighteen Dragon-Subduing Palms'. He was initially suspicious of Huang Rong when he recognises her as the daughter of his rival, Huang Yaoshi. He was reluctant to teach her martial arts but eventually imparts the 'Carefree Fist' to her. Hong Qigong leaves them after that and meets them again during their encounter with Ouyang Ke. The lecherous Ouyang Ke was attempting to kidnap Cheng Yaojia and rape her, but Guo, Huang and members of the Beggars' Sect save her. Hong Qigong helps them drive away Ouyang Ke. He then formally accepts Guo Jing and Huang Rong as his students and imparts the full set of the 'Eighteen Dragon-Subduing Palms' to Guo Jing. He also teaches Huang Rong the 'Rain of Petals' skill. Hong Qigong sets foot on Peach Blossom Island later and intervenes in the contest between Guo Jing and Ouyang Ke. Huang Yaoshi allows Hong Qigong, Guo Jing and Zhou Botong to leave Peach Blossom Island later on a damaged ship. The ship sinks in the middle of the sea but the trio are rescued by Ouyang Feng, whose ship sailed past the wreck. On board, Ouyang Feng uses all sorts of means to force Hong Qigong and Guo Jing to hand over the Nine Yin Manual. However, they deliberately wrote a corrupted version of the manual (with verses written in reverse manner) for him, in hope that he will be weakened after practising the skills wrongly. Hong Qigong and Ouyang Feng start fighting and the former was poisoned when the latter used snake venom on him, and the ship sank. Guo Jing and Huang Rong managed to rescue Hong Qigong and they settle on a nearby island. The Ouyangs also set foot on the island and the five of them are stranded there. Hong Qigong uses all his inner energy to heal himself by purging the poison from his body, but loses his powers in the process. Hong Qigong decides to pass his position as the Beggars' Sect's chief to Huang Rong and teaches her the 'Dog Beating Staff Technique'. When Hong Qigong, Guo Jing and Huang Rong manage to leave the island, Hong follows them on their adventures together with Zhou Botong. They venture into the palace, where Hong Qigong says he wants to taste imperial cuisine again. When he meets his students again, Guo Jing and Huang Rong now have a better understanding of the Nine Yin Manual and they pass their knowledge to him to help him recover faster. Hong Qigong is briefly mentioned again in the scene on Mount Hua before the novel ends. ==In The Return of the Condor Heroes== Hong Qigong makes a brief appearance in the sequel novel. He has regained his powers after losing them earlier in the first novel, and continues to roam the jianghu as a carefree old beggar hunting for culinary delights. He meets Yang Guo on Mount Hua and is impressed with the young man's chivalric nature. He also encounters his old rival, Ouyang Feng. Hong Qigong and Ouyang Feng fight with each other again – this time for a period of four days. The fight is interrupted when Yang Guo comes at intervals to serve them meals. The animosity between the two rivals is too strong for them to bear and they continue to pit their inner energies against each other for a full day. Both of them suffer from exhaustion but are unwilling to back down to uphold their ego. They decide to use Yang Guo, who has been an observer for the past few days, as an intermediate. They teach Yang Guo their respective skills and ask him to perform for each other to see. Hong Qigong teaches Yang Guo the 'Dog Beating Staff Technique'. Ouyang Feng had apparently lost after Yang Guo performed the last stance, 'No Dogs Under Heaven'. Ouyang Feng spends the following night thinking of a counter-move. The next morning, he asks Yang Guo to perform in front of Hong Qigong, who is shocked when he sees that Ouyang Feng has overcome his most powerful move. Hong Qigong finally realises that there will be no eventual victor between him and Ouyang Feng. He laughs hysterically and embraces his rival in defeat. At the same time, Ouyang Feng seems to have recovered from his insanity as he finally recognises Hong Qigong. The two of them die together in the midst of laughter and forgotten past feuds. Yang Guo buries them side by side on Mount Hua. ==Martial arts and skills== * 'Eighteen Dragon-Subduing Palms' (降龍十八掌) is the most powerful of all external martial arts mentioned in the novels. The skill is created based on the principles in the Yi Jing. * 'Dog Beating Staff Technique' (打狗棒法) is a set of 36 styles of staff techniques. The skill is only known to the Beggars' Sect's chief and passed down from each chief to his/her successor. * 'Carefree Fist' (逍遙遊) is a set of fist techniques created by Hong Qigong in his youth. The skill is smooth and visually appealing but lacks real power. * 'Rain of Petals' (滿天花雨) is created by Hong Qigong to counter Ouyang Ke's snake formation after he sees Huang Rong's sewing kit. It involves using common sewing needles as dart-like throwing weapons to pin down the snakes. * Guo Jing and Huang Rong pass their knowledge of the Nine Yin Manual (九陰真經) to Hong Qigong to help him recover from his battle with Ouyang Feng. Hong Qigong practises the skills in the book and regains his powers in the sequel novel. ==Notes== Category:Jin Yong characters Category:The Legend of the Condor Heroes Category:The Return of the Condor Heroes Category:Condor Trilogy Category:Fictional wushu practitioners Category:Fictional slaves Category:Fictional beggars Category:Literary characters introduced in 1959 Category:Characters in novels of the 20th century Category:Fictional Song dynasty people ","title":"Hong Qigong"},{"id":"6208872","text":"Sharon Prabhakar (born 4 August 1955) is an Indian pop singer, theatre personality and public speaker. ==Personal life== Prabhakar was born to a Punjabi father who was a public servant and a Christian mother who was a music teacher.

It was seen as a way for Seven to stay involved in football after losing the broadcast rights to the Australian Football League after the 2001 season. The show featured a handpicked team of amateur footballers coached by former VFL/AFL legend David Rhys-Jones which played against various Victorian football sides from the Western Region Football League second division, following the trials and tribulations of its players. Unlike normal clubs, the home audience were able to influence who was selected in the team each week by voting to keep their favourite players in the side. Viewers also got to vote on many of the club's other key aspects including its name, coach, captain and song. The show was considered trailblazing and generated a cult following, with several crowds at games featuring the Hammerheads pushing 5,000 spectators and many claiming the Hammerheads as their second favourite sporting team. After finishing the regular season in third position, the Hammerheads went on to win the Grand Final and claim the flag in their first – and only – season. Despite the show's success, it did not return to television. ==Controversy== The show also achieved its share of controversy and publicity. The Hammerheads attempted to have a woman, Debbie Lee, play on their team in competition games but were ultimately stopped by the league. There were also criticisms of personal attacks by coach Rhys-Jones on players.

The show runs from 6 p.m. to 10 p.m. Pacific Time and is hosted by Tim Conway, Jr. Conway rose to popularity as a longtime host on former FM talk station KLSX, first teamed with Doug Steckler who was followed as co-host by Brian Whitman. After the 2008 departure of Whitman, Conway hosted solo rather than adopting a new co- host. On February 19, 2009, both Whitman and Steckler were special guests on Conway's last show before KLSX flipped the format to Top-40. ==Show host== Tim Conway, Jr. is the son of the late American television and film comedian Tim Conway, and then wife Mary Ann. Tim Conway, Jr. resides in Burbank, California with his wife and daughter. ==KFI== Conway's weeknight show at KFI began on Monday, January 18, 2010, after Bryan Suits, who previously hosted the show at that time slot, decided to move back to Seattle. In line with the majority of KFI's programming, Conway discusses political topics, leaning hard towards the right with a comical libertarian slant. Through July 17, 2015, on Friday nights, Conway was joined by comedian/writer Doug Steckler, his former co-host on KLSX. On Tuesday nights Conway is joined by Mark Thompson. Conway often jokes about his costly love of gambling, especially his (usually) losing bets on the horses. He also retrospectively claims to have said, done, or is currently doing things, he has never actually done, in a completely believable manner. Thursday nights from 7-8pm used to be reserved for Conway's game show, What the Hell Did Jesse Jackson Say?, in which the host plays mostly unintelligible sound bites of Jesse Jackson and listeners call in to guess what Jackson is saying. The Conway Show stopped playing the game in 2017.

It is a member of the Fair Youth sequence, in which the poet expresses his love towards a young man. Sonnet 46 is continued in Sonnet 47. == Synopsis of Sonnet 46 == According to the first two lines, the heart wants one thing (emotional love) and the eye wants something different (physical beauty). The third and fourth lines make it clear that while the eye is fixated on the physical appearance of the young man, the heart would prefer not to see the person's physical appearance. Instead, it would focus on emotional love. Lines five and six state that the young man who is the object of the poem resides inside the speaker's heart, where he is unseen by the \\"crystal eyes\\". The seventh and eighth lines state that the eyes disagree with the heart and argue that they are capable of detecting of the beauty of a person. The third quatrain sets up the decision to be made about this 'battle'. Lines 9–10 explain that deciding this legal right of possession requires a jury of thoughts and these thoughts are all tenants of the heart. The jury decides the verdict and what share (moiety) the clear eye and dear heart will receive. The rhyming couplet offers the final decision. Author G. Blackmore Evans believes the 'outward part' refers to the external physical beauty; the eyes are granted the exercise of their physical attribute of sight.Evans, G. Blakemore (ed.). The Sonnets. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1996. p. 155 According to Evans, the 'right' of the heart perhaps suggests the 'natural right' making it a stronger word and emphasizing the superiority of the heart's claim: \\"'thy inward love of heart' is the spiritual/mental love of your heart and is a 'part' of you in value far beyond the 'due' accorded to the eyes because it is the 'essential' you, not merely the 'appearance'.\\" Evans, G. Blakemore (ed.). The Sonnets. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1996. 155 In both Sonnet 46 and Sonnet 47 the eye, as a party to the trial and to the truce is always used in the singular. The plural eyes is used in line 6 of Sonnet 46 and possibly (at least in the modern version of the text) in line 14 of Sonnet 47 but they do not refer there to the \\"defendant\\". In Sonnet 24 both singular and plural are used to refer to the eyes of the speaker. ==Structure== Sonnet 46 is an English or Shakespearean sonnet, composed of three quatrains followed by a final rhyming couplet, written in a type of metre called iambic pentameter based on five pairs of metrically weak/strong syllabic positions. The first line exemplifies a regular iambic pentameter: × / × / × / × / × / Mine eye and heart are at a mortal war, (46.1) :/ = ictus, a metrically strong syllabic position. × = nonictus. While this sonnet (like others) is based on an ABAB CDCD EFEF GG rhyme scheme, here rhymes f and g are identical—which, as critic Philip C. McGuire writes, is unusual in an English sonnet.(McGuire, Philip C. \\"Shakespeare's Non- Shakespearian Sonnets\\". Shakespeare Quarterly, Vol. 38, No. 3 (Autumn 1987), pp. 304–319) Moreover, not only are the same rhymes used, but identical words are employed (\\"heart\\" and \\"part\\" for both the f and g rhymes). Furthermore, the first quatrain rhymes \\"sight\\" with \\"right\\", and the \\"-t\\" sound at the end of each of these words is repeated in the third quatrain and couplet with “part” and \\"heart\\". McGuire suggests that the \\"blurring of formal divisions in sonnet 46 anticipates\\" the \\"league\\" that arises \\"betwixt mine eye and heart\\" in Sonnet 47. Sonnet 47 also includes the words \\"heart\\" and \\"part\\". ==Analysis== Sonnet 46, along with sonnets 24 and 47 (which are all sonnets referring to the eye and heart tension), is known as an absence sonnet. George Massey states that the sonnet has the look of a lover fondling the miniature of his beloved, and rejoicing that in her absence he has at least her portrait to dote on and dally with.Massey, George. Shakespeare's Sonnets Never Before Interpreted. New York: AMS Press, 1973. p. 185 The picture is not an actual portrait though, but rather a \\"visionary portrait of the Earl for the possession of which the eyes and heart contend.\\" It is an image engraved in one's heart and conjures a mental picture. Author J.W. Lever agrees that the sonnets taken into this group employ the theme of the Poet's absence from his Friend. The subject-matter is traditional – conceits on the eyes and heart, laments at separation, accounts of the sleeplessness or troubled dreams of the beloved. Lever believes, \\"conceits on absence become instruments of investigating the workings of poetic thought, its power to transcend space, its visionary quality.\\"Lever, J.W. \\"The Poet in Absence\\". Discussions of Shakespeare's Sonnets. Ed. Barbara Herrnstien. Boston: D.C. Heath and Company, 1964. p. 73 The conceit was equally witty, and also worked to advance the poet's understanding of himself, derived not from ideal principles but from observation and intuition. Because there is this apparent focus on the absent person, it seems logical that physical descriptions play into the remembrance of the absent. It is quite obvious that the body is the focus in this poem. There are 14 references to body parts (eye and heart). While the body was not an exploited object in Renaissance times, it was a focus of love nonetheless. Lever notes that it was commonplace of romance \\"entered through the eyes and penetrated to the heart.\\"Lever, J.W. \\"The Poet in Absence\\". Discussions of Shakespeare's Sonnets. Ed. Barbara Herrnstien. Boston: D.C. Heath and Company, 1964. 73 Furthermore, \\"Renaissance fancy…developed the conceit, with love engraving upon the heart the lady's image. The engraving became a portrait, with the eyes as windows through which it could be seen.\\" In a time when courtship was more formal and suitors or lovers were viewed from afar, it makes sense that one would struggle with relying on the eye for physical knowledge of the other, but need the heart to fully read and connect to the person. Shakespeare sets up the dispute between the heart and the eye as a legal battle that is to be decided by a jury (\\"quest of thoughts\\"). Legal terminology is abundant throughout the sonnet, with both the heart and eye making \\"pleas\\" for their cases. Eventually, a \\"verdict is determined\\" that the \\"outward part\\" of the body belongs to the eye while the \\"inward love of heart\\" belongs to the heart. Critic Paul Hammond focuses on the word \\"'cide\\" in line 9.Hammond, P. A Textual Crux in Shakespeare's Sonnet 46. Notes and Queries v. 253 no. 2 (June 2008) p. 187-8 He argues that neither \\"'cide\\" as in \\"decide\\" nor \\"side\\" as in \\"to support\\" or \\"to side with\\" make sense in the context of the poem. He states that the word was originally printed as \\"fide\\", which was a misprint of \\"finde\\", meaning \\"to determine and declare\\". He gives two reasons why he thinks this is the correct word: (1) \\"side\\" does not make sense in the context of the poem and (2) that \\"finde\\" continues the legal imagery of the sonnet. Battle imagery is also rife throughout the sonnet. It describes a \\"mortal war\\" between the heart and the eye, with both striving for different aspects of a person and preventing the other from attaining what it desires. They clash over \\"how to divide the conquest of thy sight\\". In the end, the sonnet suggests that a truce must be made between the heart and the eye. == Connections to Sonnet 47 == Sonnet 46 is strongly connected to Sonnet 47. The former raises the issue of the balance between the heart and the eyes, and the latter provides the resolution to this issue. As critic Joel Fineman writes, Sonnet 47 \\"rel[ies] on a verdict that is determined at the conclusion of Sonnet 46.\\"Fineman, J. \\"Shakespeare's 'Perjur'd Eye'\\". Representations, No. 7 (Summer 1984) pp. 59–86 While 46 focuses on the \\"war\\" between the heart and the eyes, 47 begins with the line \\"Betwixt mine eye and heart a league is took\\", suggesting that a truce has been made and the war has come to an end. The third quatrain and couplet from Sonnet 47 emphasize the equality of heart and eye, suggesting that they are complementary. While they are different parts of the body with different desires, they both find \\"delight\\" in the same thing: the young man. Fineman writes that \\"the difference between outward and inward is secured and reconciled because the vision of the eye and the thinking of the heart can be harmoniously apportioned between the clear-cut opposition of the clear eye's moiety and the dear heart's part.\\" In essence, they both want different parts of the same thing, and thus should function in harmony instead of in conflict. Both Sonnets 46 and 47 use the idea of a picture to describe the physical appearance of the young man. Sonnet 46 states, \\"Mine eye my heart thy picture's sight would bar\\" while Sonnet 47 says, \\"With my love's picture then my eye doth feast\\". ==ReferencesFurther reading *Analysis Category:British poems Category:Sonnets by William Shakespeare ","title":"Sonnet 46"},{"id":"6208991","text":"Jerome Leonard Boger ( ; born July 1, 1955) is an American football official in the National Football League (NFL) since the 2004 NFL season. He wears uniform number 23 since 2006; before that, he wore uniform number 109. He started in the league as a line judge and was promoted to referee in 2006 after two seasons. Along with Gene Steratore, he was one of two new referees for 2006, replacing retired officials Bernie Kukar and Tom White. Boger became the third African-American referee in the NFL after Johnny Grier (1988), who previously wore uniform number 23, and Mike Carey (1995). ==Personal== Boger played quarterback at Morehouse College in Atlanta, Georgia as a four-year starter and graduated in 1977. Realizing that he did not have the football skills to make it on a professional level, he decided to get into officiating, allowing him to stay close to the game. He started working high school and recreational league games before moving up to small colleges. He spent 11 years in the Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Conference and five seasons in the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference from 1996 to 2000. Boger has a son, Tra Boger, signed with the Green Bay Packers in the 2006 offseason, but was subsequently released. He later played defensive back in the Canadian Football League. Boger resides in Conyers, Georgia. Outside of officiating, he worked as an underwriter for Allstate Insurance in Atlanta. ==Officiating career== Boger has also served as a referee in Conference USA, Arena Football League, and NFL Europe (where he officiated in World Bowl XIV). Boger was promoted to referee in 2006. Boger served as referee for a game between the Dallas Cowboys and Tennessee Titans during the season. In the third quarter of the game, Titans' defensive lineman Albert Haynesworth was ejected for stomping on the head of Cowboys offensive lineman Andre Gurode. Haynesworth received a five- game suspension as a result of the incident, the longest suspension for an on- field incident in NFL history. Boger also served as referee in 2006 in a Monday Night game where the Chicago Bears defeated the Arizona Cardinals in one of the greatest comebacks in league history. During a game between the Cincinnati Bengals and St. Louis Rams, Boger was announcing a holding penalty against Rams' offensive tackle Harvey Dahl, when his open microphone picked up Dahl proclaiming \\"That's not fucking holding!\\" The obscenity was not only broadcast to the crowd at the Edward Jones Dome, but to the television audience watching on CBS as well. Dahl was penalized for unsportsmanlike conduct for his profane rant. Boger and Darrell Jenkins working Super Bowl XLVII. Boger was chosen to be the referee of Super Bowl XLVII, held at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome in New Orleans on February 3, 2013, only the second African-American to do so behind Mike Carey five years earlier. This caused several other NFL officials to question the leagues' officiating department's grading process, claiming that all of Boger's downgrades during the season were reversed. He was also the alternate referee of Super Bowl XLV, which was held on February 6, 2011 in Arlington, Texas. Boger has not received an on- field postseason assignment since officiating Super Bowl XLVII. Boger's 2020 NFL officiating crew consists of umpire Carl Paganelli, down judge Patrick Holt, line judge Rusty Baynes, field judge Joe Blubaugh, side judge Chad Hill, back judge Tony Steratore, replay official Roddy Ames, and replay assistant Ross Smith. ==References== Category:1955 births Category:African-American sports officials Category:American football quarterbacks Category:National Football League officials Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from the Atlanta metropolitan area Category:American businesspeople in insurance Category:People from Conyers, Georgia Category:Businesspeople from Georgia (U.S. state) Category:Morehouse Maroon Tigers football players ","title":"Jerome Boger"},{"id":"6209000","text":"\\"Factory Girl\\" is a song by the Rolling Stones which appears on their 1968 album Beggars Banquet. It is very similar to an Appalachian folk tune, especially due to its minimal arrangement, featuring Mick Jagger on vocals, Keith Richards on acoustic guitar, Rocky Dijon on conga drums, Ric Grech of Family on fiddle/violin, Nicky Hopkins plays Mellotron using the mandolin sound (as indicated by bootleg recordings) and Charlie Watts on tabla.[]. On his performance, Charlie Watts said in 2003, \\"On 'Factory Girl', I was doing something you shouldn't do, which is playing the tabla with sticks instead of trying to get that sound using your hand, which Indian tabla players do, though it's an extremely difficult technique and painful if you're not trained.\\" The song is composed of lyrics musing on the singer's relationship with a young woman, all while he is waiting for her to come out to meet him; Richards said of the song in 2003, \\"To me 'Factory Girl' felt something like 'Molly Malone', an Irish jig; one of those ancient Celtic things that emerge from time to time, or an Appalachian song. In those days I would just come up and play something, sitting around the room. I still do that today. If Mick gets interested I'll carry on working on it; if he doesn't look interested, I'll drop it, leave it and say, 'I'll work on it and maybe introduce it later.'\\" Jagger countered, saying, \\"The country songs, like 'Factory Girl' or 'Dear Doctor' on Beggars Banquet were really pastiche. There's a sense of humour in country music anyway, a way of looking at life in a humorous kind of way - and I think we were just acknowledging that element of the music. The 'country' songs we recorded later, like \\"Dead Flowers\\" on Sticky Fingers or \\"Far Away Eyes\\" on Some Girls are slightly different. The actual music is played completely straight, but it's me who's not going legit with the whole thing, because I think I'm a blues singer not a country singer.\\" Jim Beviglia ranked \\"Factory Girl\\" the 163rd best Rolling Stones song in Counting Down the Rolling Stones: Their 100 Finest Songs. Paste commented, \\"The Rolling Stones did an impressive job stepping outside their usual rockers to create this folk number\\" and ranked it 29th in its Top 50 Rolling Stones songs. Rolling Stone ranked it 91st in its countdown of the band's top 100 songs, calling it an \\"oddity that feels like a country song yet incorporates tablas, mandolins and a fiddle solo.\\" The song has been performed live in 1990, 1997 and 2013. A live recording from the Steel Wheels/Urban Jungle Tour made its way onto the 1991 live album Flashpoint. The song was also featured during the 1997 Bridges to Babylon Tour It was played in Los Angeles on 3 May 2013 and then a version of the song with different lyrics called \\"Glastonbury Girl\\" was performed at the Glastonbury festival on 29 June 2013. ==Personnel== *Mick Jaggervocals *Keith Richardsacoustic guitar *Charlie Wattstabla *Rocky Dijonconga drum *Nicky Hopkinsmellotron mandolin samples *Ric Grechviolin ==References== Category:1968 songs Category:The Rolling Stones songs Category:Song recordings produced by Jimmy Miller Category:Songs written by Jagger/Richards ","title":"Factory Girl (Rolling Stones song)"},{"id":"6209019","text":"Karen Austin (born October 24, 1955) is an American actress.

Their lands, prior to invasion, bordered the Yuba and Feather rivers. They were nearly destroyed during the California Genocide in the latter half of the 19th century. The Central and Southern Yana continue to live in California as members of Redding Rancheria. ==Etymology== The Yana- speaking people comprised four groups: the North Yana, the Central Yana, the Southern Yana, and the Yahi. The noun stem Ya- means \\"person\\"; the noun suffix is -na in the northern Yana dialects and -hi [xi] in the southern dialects. ==History== The anthropologist Alfred L. Kroeber put the 1770 population of the Yana at 1,500,Kroeber, p.883 and Sherburne F. Cook estimated their numbers at 1,900 and 1,850,Cook, 1976a:177, 1976b:16 while other estimates of the total Yana population before the Gold Rush exceed 3,000. They lived on wild game, salmon, fruit, acorns and roots.Pritzker, Barry M. (2000). A Native American Encyclopedia: History, Culture, and Peoples, p. 156. Oxford University Press. Their territory was approximately 2400 square miles, or more than 6000 km2, and contained mountain streams, gorges, boulder-strewn hills, and lush meadows. Each group had relatively distinct boundaries, dialects and customs.\\"Ishi's Hiding Place\\", Butte County, A History of American Indians in California: HISTORIC SITES, National Park Service, 2004, accessed 5 Nov 2010 After James W. Marshall discovered gold in 1848, tens of thousands of gold- miners and ranchers flocked into Yana territory. Yana territory was seized, especially the lands around the Yuba and Feather rivers, where the Yana fished for salmon, a major source of food. The food supply dropped dramatically, as gold mining damaged the streams and fish runs, and deer fled the crowded area. ==Yahi== The Yahi were the southernmost portion of the Yana. They were hunter- gatherers who lived in small egalitarian bands without centralized political authority, and were reclusive and fiercely defended their territory of mountain canyons. The Yahi initially numbered around 400.. The Yahi were the first Yana group to suffer from the Californian Gold Rush, as their lands were the closest to the gold fields. They suffered great population losses from the loss of their traditional food supplies and fought with the settlers over territory. They lacked firearms and armed white settlers intentionally committed genocide against them through multiple raids. The settlers were led by Indian hunter Robert Anderson, whose men launched two raids in 1865 which killed about seventy people combined. The massacre reduced the Yahi, who were already suffering from starvation, to a population of less than 100. On August 6, 1866, seventeen settlers raided a Yahi village at dawn. In the same year, more Yahis were massacred when they were caught by surprise in a ravine. Around 1867, thirty-three Yahis were killed after being tracked to a cave north of Mill Creek. Finally around 1871, four cowboys trapped and killed about thirty Yahis in Kingsley cave. ===Ishi=== Ishi, the last known survivor of the Yahi. The last known survivor of the Yahi was named Ishi by American anthropologists. Ishi had spent most of his life in hiding with his tribe members in the Sierra wilderness, emerging at the age of about 49, after the deaths of his mother and last relatives. He was the only Yahi known to Americans. Ishi emerged from the mountains near Oroville, California on August 29, 1911, having lived his entire life outside of the American culture. Professors from the University of California, Berkeley, read about him and brought him to San Francisco both for study and for his protection. Called the \\"last wild Indian\\", he had been treated as a curiosity by the public. Under the auspices of the anthropologist Alfred Kroeber, director of the Museum of Anthropology, Ishi lived there until his death from tuberculosis (then incurable) in 1916. His language was studied in 1911 by the linguist Edward Sapir, who had previously done work on the northern dialects. By tribal custom, he was not to reveal his name to an enemy. Rather, one would be introduced by a friend, and then the name could be offered. Since he was the last of his people, he had no friends, although he made some later at the University of California. Tradition demanded that he never speak his name. Researchers at the University of California, Berkeley gave him the name Ishi, the Yana word for \\"man\\". He accepted this and adopted the term \\"Mr. Ishi\\" when he learned enough English. Ishi worked as a research assistant at the Museum of Anthropology. He taught Saxton Pope, a professor at the medical school and his physician, how to make arrows and bows, and to hunt with them. Pope is considered the \\"father\\" of modern bow hunting, as he published extensively on techniques. ==See also== * Yana language * Yana traditional narratives * Indigenous peoples of California ==NotesReferences== * Cook, Sherburne F. 1976a.

The song is featured on their 1976 album Destroyer, and was the first Kiss single to feature a picture sleeve. The single reached number 74 in the U.S. and 73 in Canada. Although the full album version only ran 2:55 (2:59 on CD remasters), the song was still edited to 2:39 with an earlier fade. ==Overview== The song was written by Ace Frehley, Paul Stanley, Gene Simmons and Bob Ezrin. Ezrin took pieces of music written by the other three and organized them into one song. For example, one of the main riffs on \\"Flaming Youth\\" was from a song that Simmons wrote called \\"Mad Dog\\", which appeared on Kiss' 2001 release, The Box Set. The song's instrumentation features a calliope, the use of which was inspired by producer Bob Ezrin. In the United States, this was the first Kiss 45rpm 7 inch single to be produced with the tan \\"Casbah\\" label. However, it can be found from Canada and Japan with the dark blue \\"smoking man\\" label.

He is considered one of the nation's finest footballers of the 20th century. Century's Top 100 Players In 1907 he played for New South Wales in the first rugby match run by the newly created 'New South Wales Rugby Football League' which had just split away from the established New South Wales Rugby Football Union. He made his first national representative appearance in 1908. ==Club career== A , Pearce played his whole career of 157 matches for the Eastern Suburbs club between 1908 and 1921. Pearce was a member of the Eastern Suburbs side that won three consecutive premierships from 1911–13. He was also a member of the three Easts City Cup winning sides from 1914 to 1916. He was the first Eastern Suburbs player to register 100 matches with the club and the first in the New South Wales Rugby Football League premiership to play in 150 matches. ==Representative career== 1908 Kangaroos Pearce (3rd row 4th from right) Pioneer Kangaroos 1908–09 Sandy Pearce was a member of the side that played against the New Zealand ‘All Golds' in 1908 helping to establish the code in Australia. He went on the inaugural Kangaroo tour of England in 1908–09 where he was one of only five players from the thirty-five strong touring party to play in all three Test matches. He also played in 30 other minor matches on that tour, he also represented Australasia. Pearce, along with friend and team-mate Dally Messenger chose not to go on the 1911–12 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain. At 38 years of age he was again selected for the 1921–22 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain where he played in two Tests and nineteen minor games. In all he played in fourteen of the first seventeen test matches between Australia and England. Aged 38 years and 158 days for his final Test on 5 November 1921, he became the oldest player ever to represent Australia. He retired as Australia's most-capped rugby league player. Sandy Pearce and his son Joe Pearce later became the first father and son to represent Australia in rugby league. Sandy Pearce is listed on the Australian Players Register as Kangaroo No. 17.ARL Annual Report 2005. ==Family of champions== Pearce came from a family of sporting champions. His father Harry Pearce (nicknamed \\"Footy\\" because of the size of his feet) was a world champion sculler. Sandy's brother Walter was an outstanding long distance cyclist, sister Lilly Pearce was also a noted sculler and the first woman to ride an aquaplane on Sydney harbour. Nephew Bobby Pearce was probably the most recognised – a dual Olympic sculling gold medalist. Sandy's own son Joe Pearce followed in his footsteps playing rugby league for Eastern Suburbs and representing NSW and Australia in that sport. ==Accolades== He was awarded Life Membership of the New South Wales Rugby League in 1914.Referee, Sydney: Life Members of the NSW Rugby League- 13 May 1914.

The cortège for his funeral was said to be more than a mile long . Famous Rugby league players were the pallbearers including Dally Messenger, Peter Burge, Frank Burge, Arthur Surridge Reg Latta and George Clamback . He was buried at South Head Cemetery on Saturday 15 November 1930. Former Australian teammate Frank Burge, speaking at a function in Pearce's honour in 1940, had this to say > \\"Football has never had a gamer, rougher, tougher nor more loyal team > player. Old Sandy, a hooker, was easily the best I have ever seen in his > position. The fact that at 38 when he toured England in 1921 is sufficient > testimony to his skill.

His international rugby league debut against Great Britain in Brisbane on 6 June 1970 alongside Phil Hawthorne saw them together become Australia's 32nd and 33rd dual code rugby internationals. For family reasons, he made himself unavailable for the 1972 Rugby League World Cup and the 1973 Kangaroo Tour but he was selected for the 1975 World Cup series and captained Australia to victory in a game against New Zealand in that campaign. He is listed on the Australian Players Register as Kangaroo No.440.ARL Annual Report, 2005. page 54 He was part of the Roosters' premiership winning sides of 1974 and 1975, kicking two goals in the 1974 Grand Final and scoring two tries in the 1975 decider. During the 1976 NSWRFL season, Brass played as a for Eastern Suburbs in their unofficial 1976 World Club Challenge match against British champions St. Helens in Sydney. == Post playing == Brass coached the Tweed Heads Seagulls in the Group 18 competition in 1977-78. He had a long career in shopping centre management. In 1995 he was asked to join the board of Super League and remained on the Board when the truce between the warring factions was called in 1997 and the National Rugby League was formed. He remained on the board until 2005, when he was replaced by Gorden Tallis. ==References Sources == * Whiticker, Alan (2004) Captaining the Kangaroos, New Holland, Sydney Category:Australian rugby league players Category:Sydney Roosters players Category:Australian rugby union players Category:Australia international rugby union players Category:Dual- code rugby internationals Category:Australia national rugby league team players Category:Australia national rugby league team captains Category:Living people Category:Rugby league centres Category:Australian rugby league administrators Category:People educated at Sydney Boys High School Category:1946 births Category:Rugby league players from Sydney ","title":"John Brass"},{"id":"6209092","text":"Open Universities Australia (OUA) is an online higher education organisation based in Australia.

A board of directors, consisting of nominees from the universities which own the organisation, governs OUA. There are also up to five independent directors on the board at any one time. While the majority of enrolled students are based in Australia, courses are available to students globally. Most undergraduate courses offered have no first-year entry requirements and there are no quotas for most courses. Through OUA, students can enrol in hundreds of qualifications online, which are provided by Australian universities and other education providers. ==Background== Current university providers: * Australian Catholic University * Australian National University * Bond University * Charles Sturt University * Curtin University * Edith Cowan University * Flinders University * Griffith University * James Cook University * La Trobe University * Macquarie University * Murdoch University * RMIT University * Southern Cross University * Swinburne University of Technology * The University of Adelaide * University of New England * University of New South Wales * University of South Australia * University of Tasmania OUA is a member of the Elite Athlete Friendly University program (EAFU). A key factor in being part of EAFU is for the partner to support athletes to achieve academic excellence and recognise the challenges athletes face when combining education, career and a personal life with a high-performance sporting career. Professional athletes studying through OUA come from a range of sports including all football codes, tennis, athletics and diving. OUA also has partnerships with several Australian public and private organizations such as National Australia Bank, Westpac Group and the Commonwealth Department of Defence. ==History== Open Universities Australia was formed as the Open Learning Agency of Australia Pty Ltd (OLAA or OLA) in late 1993 as a private company. The organisation was originally owned by Monash University. In order to provide equal access to students across Australia's regional areas, they created a partnership with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and eight other universities. At this time, the federal government provided funding for the project. In 2004, OLA changed its name to Open Universities Australia (OUA), reflecting the changing demands and expectation of its students. In the same year, OUA students gained access to the new FEE-HELP scheme. FEE-HELP provides eligible students with deferred payment options for undergraduate and postgraduate units and courses and remains a popular option with OUA students. In June 2012, IBM used the organisation as an IT case study after implementing a new IT strategy. The move was aimed at supporting student performance and retention, while also giving the organisation an insight into marketing and sales options. In December 2012, the organisation placed a bid for a top level domain, .courses. The bid was made in a lottery draw, held by Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) to help assign new generic top-level domains. Open2Study was launched in March 2013 as a teaching, learning and assessment platform. It enabled universities to offer free courses online. It competed with global online learning platform providers such as Coursera and EdX. Open2Study closed in 2019. In July 2013, OUA acquired a 100 per cent interest in Interact Learning Pty Ltd, trading as e3Learning, an Australian online training and compliance provider based in Adelaide. Founded in 2001, e3Learning has 250 corporate customers across Australia, the United Kingdom and New Zealand and employs more than 70 staff. The City & Guilds Group acquired e3Learning from OUA in 2017. In December 2013, OUA launched Open Training Institute, a Registered Training Organisation (RTO) offering online Vocational Education and Training (VET).

Both a player and administrator, he was a leading figure in the birth of the sport in Australia. Flegg emigrated to Australia at an early age. He received his nickname 'Jersey' while still at school, after a meeting with the New South Wales (NSW) Governor of the time, Lord Jersey, who had bright red hair, similar to his own. ==Playing career== 'Jersey' played rugby football for the Adelphi club and represented New South Wales in the sport before moving to the new rebel code in rugby league's start up season – 1908. 'Jersey' played a leading role in the establishment of the Eastern Suburbs club, he chaired the founding meeting, was one of that club's two delegates to the New South Wales Rugby Football League (NSWRFL) as well as being a club selector. A front row forward with a reputation as a solid defender, Flegg captained the side in its inaugural season, including the club's first match and the NSWRFL's first premiership decider against neighbouring Sydney club and traditional rival, South Sydney. Flegg was also selected in a Sydney-based representative team during that first season. However, it is in administration that 'Jersey' is best remembered. ==Administrative career== In 1909, Flegg was made a New South Wales and Australian selector and in 1929 he was appointed to the position of president of the NSWRFL. In 1941 he became chairman of the Australian Rugby League Board of Control. At the time of his death in 1960, aged 82, he was still serving in these roles. A life member of the Australian, British and French Rugby Leagues, Flegg received further recognition when in 1961 the H. Jersey Flegg Cup was introduced. His contribution to rugby league extended over half a century and during his tenure at the head of the game's administration, rugby league prospered, cementing itself as the dominant football code throughout the Australian states of New South Wales and Queensland.

He later became chief salary cap auditor for the National Rugby League. An Australian international representative player, Schubert had a long club career which began with a sensational opening season for Eastern Suburbs, before fading out and re-inventing himself with Manly-Warringah and Western Suburbs so well that he regained his Australian jumper after having been in reserve grade a year prior. By the time his career closed Schubert had played 269 first grade games, which stood as the third highest in the history of the NSWRFL. In 1982, Schubert was a member of the 1982 Kangaroo tour, the team being the first to go through Great Britain and France undefeated, earning themselves the nickname \\"The Invincibles\\". Though he didn't play any of the tests on the tour, he played in 12 minor games and scored 3 tries. ==Playing career== Originally from the timber town of Wauchope, Schubert was selected to play for the Australian Schoolboys team in 1972. He was first recommended to Eastern Suburbs coach Jack Gibson in 1974. Although not out of school at the time, Schubert instantly became a regular first grader on the wing - in the process relegating the previous season's leading try scorer Bill Mullins to reserve grade! When Easts rugby union convert fullback Russell Fairfax was injured, Schubert was shifted to fullback with devastating effect. He scored fourteen tries that year and set up many others. In the grand final against St George the youngster was named as 'Man Of The Match' for his outstanding performance. Schubert's performance in that match earned him a place in the Australian team for that season's World Cup. In a match against Wales in Swansea he scored a hat-trick. In the tournament he did extremely well, twice scoring three tries in one match against Wales and briefly moving to lock forward - a move that foreshadowed his post-Eastern Suburbs career. During the 1976 NSWRFL season, Schubert played at as a for Eastern Suburbs in their unofficial 1976 World Club Challenge match against British champions St. Helens in Sydney. The following years saw Schubert fail to maintain the form of his debut season. However, his pace out wide was still good enough for him to be selected for the 1978 Kangaroo tour, on which he played ten matches but could not displace the incomparable Eadie from his Test place, nor even Chris Anderson from his wing berth. His return to Australia in 1979, however, saw such a decline that by the time Easts had returned to the top under the coaching of Bob Fulton, Schubert had been relegated to reserve grade and he was not seen in the club's 1980 grand final loss to Canterbury-Bankstown. Easts did not have him in their plans for 1981, but Schubert signed with Western Suburbs and, despite not being consistent, played in the club's reserve grade grand final win. However, it was a surprise when Schubert, returning to Easts after having put on quite a bit of weight, re-invented himself as a skilful ball-playing forward to such effect that, despite injuries preventing him playing in a second grand final, was chosen for his second Kangaroo tour in 1982. He was not as effective as on his previous tour and signed with the big-spending Manly club for 1983, playing a significant part in a most impressive season that faltered only at the last hurdle. Schubert was also Player of the Series in the 1983 KB Cup, but the following year he declined to yet again lose his first grade berth. Believing himself still with something to offer, Ian Schubert returned to Western Suburbs - who in the previous two years had been exceedingly lucky to remain in the NSWRL competition after losing almost all of their best players - to regain a first grade spot and offer experience to a youthful side. In the period 1986 to 1988, Schubert's experience was very valuable to Western Suburbs and undoubtedly helped develop many of the young players who moved the club off the bottom in the early 1990s. He was their leading pointscorer for the three years from 1986 to 1988 - remarkable for someone who was previously not a regular goalkicker. In fact, in his fifth-last appearance in first grade, Schubert kicked a field goal for the first time in his fourteen-year career. Schubert was later named as a second-rower and as vice-captain in the Western Suburbs Team of the Eighties. ==Later years== Even before he retired as a player in 1989, Schubert had been coaching Western Suburbs' reserve grade side. He showed his talent as a lower grade coach with Canterbury-Bankstown in the early 1990s but with the Super League split and Chris Anderson's tight grip could never get to coach first grade. In recent years Schubert has been back in the headlines in his new role as auditor for the National Rugby League's salary cap and a number of unsavoury comments concerning breaches of the regulations. On 22 April 2010, it was brought to his attention that the Melbourne Storm had been cheating the salary cap system for over five years, thus making headlines not only in New South Wales and Queensland but also the rest of the country and even overseas. ==ReferencesExternal reference== * Whiticker, Alan and Hudson, Glen; The Encyclopedia of Rugby League Players (3rd edition); published 1998 by Gary Allen Pty.

An Australian international and New South Wales representative , he played for the Eastern Suburbs, St George and Parramatta NSWRFL clubs in the 1960s and 1970s. Peard's nickname, 'Bomber', came from his revolutionary towering punt kick, popularly referred to as a bomb, which terrorised opposition players, especially the s and ers they were aimed at. It has now become a common feature of the modern game.https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=wmoRAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=r-cDAAAAIBAJ&pg;=2820,5865440 ==Playing career== Peard played in Eastern Suburbs lower grades before making his 1st grade debut in 1966. That year the Roosters failed to win a game. But the Roosters enjoyed more success over the next few years under the coaching of Jack Gibson. They reached the Semi-finals in 1967 and 1968. After failing to reach the finals for the next three seasons, Peard joined Graeme Langlands at the St George Dragons in 1972 and stayed for two seasons. In 1974 Peard, along with coach Jack Gibson, rejoined the Roosters for one of the most successful periods in the club's history. He was a key figure for the Roosters, winning back to back premierships in 1974 and 1975, and they were also a winner of mid-week and pre-season cups. In Easts 38–0, 1975 premiership victory over St George, Peard kicked 7 goals. At the end of the 1975 season Peard was selected to represent Australia in that year's Rugby League World Cup, scoring a try in Australia's 25-0 thumping of England at Headingley in Leeds. Peard joined the Parramatta Eels in 1976 and was named 'player of the year' that season, helping the club to its first ever Grand Final appearance where they faced one of the power teams of the 1970s, Manly-Warringah. His \\"bomb\\" came into play early in the Grand Final as Manly winger Tom Mooney dropped a bomb over his tryline leading to a try by Eels winger Jim Porter. Unfortunately for Peard and the Eels, the club's first premiership eluded them as Manly ran out 13-10 winners. Parramatta made their second Grand Final in succession in 1977, this time facing Peard's former team St George. It was to be the first drawn Grand Final in premiership history with the scores locked at 9-9 at full time. The replay was a disaster for the Eels as the Dragons ran riot, winning 22-0. By 1978, injuries had begun to take their toll and John Peard retired at the end of the 1979 season. ==Post-playing career== Peard moved on to coach Parramatta, Penrith Panthers, and became the coach of New South Wales for the 1988 State of Origin series, in which NSW lost the series 3-0 despite having home ground advantage for the first time since the Origin concept became a series in 1982. His tenure lasted just one series as he was sacked following the Blues' whitewash series defeat, leaving him the least successful coach in State of Origin history. Peard was later the assistant coach, then officially the first grade 'co-coach' alongside Mark Murray at the Sydney Roosters during 1993-94. Peard also worked for the ABC as a rugby league commentator, most notably alongside Warren Boland and Arthur Beetson. This usually involved being the sideline caller of Saturday afternoon NSWRL games, for which the ABC had the live TV coverage rights for decades until the advent of the Super League War in 1995. Peard was famous for his humorous rapport with Boland, and in particular former teammate Beetson. Peard is a life member of the Eastern Suburbs club. The John Peard Cup, which commenced in 2004, was named in his honour. Peard suffered a life-threatening stroke in 2002 and he documents his rehabilitation in his autobiography Fine Thanks Mate: John 'The Bomber' Peard on Football, Life and Second Chances, released in April, 2007. As part of the book promotion he appeared on The NRL Sunday Footy Show on 1 April 2007. ==FootnotesReferences== * Category:1945 births Category:People from Far North Queensland Category:Australian rugby league players Category:Sydney Roosters players Category:Australia national rugby league team players Category:St. George Dragons players Category:Australian rugby league coaches Category:New South Wales Rugby League State of Origin coaches Category:Parramatta Eels players Category:Parramatta Eels coaches Category:Penrith Panthers coaches Category:Living people Category:Australian rugby league commentators Category:Rugby league five- eighths Category:Rugby league players from Queensland ","title":"John Peard"},{"id":"6209124","text":"Johnny Mayes (born 29 April 1947) is an Australian former rugby league halfback who represented Australia in the 1975 World Cup. He also played in three consecutive premiership-winning teams from 1973 to 1975, the first for Manly-Warringah and the latter two for Eastern Suburbs. His feat of playing in three consecutive premiership sides for different clubs is comparable only with Glenn Lazarus in the early 1990s for Canberra and the Brisbane Broncos, who played in four premiership sides between 1989 and 1993. ==Club careerEastern Suburbs (1968–1972)=== Mayes had a slow start to his career with Eastern Suburbs owing to competition from established 1967–68 Kangaroo tour half Kevin Junee. He first played first grade in 1968, but was still mostly in reserve grade for several years. When Junee was injured in the years after winning the Rothmans Medal in 1970, Mayes spent a considerable amount of time in first grade and for part of 1972 actually relegated Junee to the reserves - though by finals time Junee had displaced him again, playing in the club's 19–14 Grand Final loss to Manly-Warringah. ===Manly-Warringah (1973)=== Being a similar type of halfback to Junee, Mayes naturally sought another club to be sure of a first grade berth and Manly, with Dennis Ward dropping out, picked him up for the 1973 season. Mayes' growth as a player that year was remarkable. He scored sixteen tries - four in one match against Penrith - and won Rugby League Week's Player of the Year award. He was freely tipped to go on the 1973 Kangaroo tour but was not chosen, and was, remarkably, swapped for Junee so he could return to Easts the following year. ===Eastern Suburbs (1974–1977)=== This rather unusual swap was surprisingly beneficial for Mayes. Junee was the 1974 season's leading try-scorer, whilst Mayes' courageous defence and frequent darting runs helped Easts develop a powerful attack and solid defence that ensured the team dropped only seven games under coach Jack Gibson in 1974 and 1975. In the 1975 Grand Final Mayes scored a brilliant try after an arcing run cross-field by winger Bruce Pickett and another one after running through a gaping hole, whilst he scored four tries for the second time against Canterbury-Bankstown. However, with Junee's return to Easts and the unexpected emergence of the relatively unknown Kevin Hastings, Mayes spent much of 1976 in reserve grade again despite actually being the incumbent Australian test halfback. During the 1976 season, Mayes played in Easts victory in their unofficial 1976 World Club Challenge match against reigning British champions St. Helens at the Sydney Cricket Ground.

Would it turn his life around? With enough money to get a home, car, license, would he get a job? He took the idea to Showtime, where he had written-directed-executive produced the limited series Out of Order and they said yes immediately. The only limits would be that the person chosen would have to pass a psychiatric evaluation and have a clean drug test. The production company PB&J; Television produced the documentary. On her show, Oprah Winfrey called it \\"a fascinating social experiment\\". It begins with the introduction of Ted Rodrigue, a homeless man living under a bridge in California. He begins by describing an average day of \\"survival\\" for him, which consists of collecting cans and bottles for recycling in order to eat, buy cigarettes, and beer for the day. He informs the audience that an average day brings in about $25, while a good day might see as much as $35. Ted reflects on the better days of his life, when his mother (a former alcoholic) and sisters accepted him. He is shown placing a collect call to his mother, ultimately having the charges denied by his mother. Ted blames his homelessness and lack of family support on their prejudice against him for being homeless and an undesirable childhood. Ted describes his mother as a \\"bar whore\\" who often brought strange men home from the bar on the weekends and that at the age of 12, he was given his first beer by his mother at one of her many social gatherings. His ability to \\"do as he pleases\\" by not having to answer to any authority figures, keeps him on the streets. Ted informs the filmmakers that he takes a lot of pride in his bicycle and is shown washing it at a car wash, although it has been over three months since he had a \\"real\\" shower. Through his recycling, Ted has befriended an 18-year-old Latino male named Michael (Mike), who works at the recycling plant. The film shows Ted doing his daily dumpster-dive, collecting cans for the day's food, cigarettes and beer, when he finds a briefcase amongst the rubbish. Ted stops to brush it off and opens it up slowly and finds that it is stuffed with cash. A note atop the money reads \\"What would a homeless person do if he were given $100,000?\\" Shocked and in tears, Ted comes to the realization that he is the recipient of a significant amount of money. Ted almost immediately buys a new bicycle, rents a motel room and takes his buddy Mike to an amusement park. The word gets out among the homeless community and Ted, who once couldn't find a girlfriend due to his poor dental hygiene, now enjoys female companionship in his motel room. As soon as Ted notifies his mother and sisters of his attainment of wealth, they begin to take his calls and his mother invites him to stay with her until he finds his own residence. The family is shown discussing how they are concerned for Ted's welfare. A week after finding the money, and having spent over $2,000, Ted is still in the motel and is asked to speak with an advocate for the homeless. The counselor asks Ted what he thinks about having the money, to which Ted replies that he really hasn't thought about it much and that he has too much time on his hands now since he no longer has to recycle. Ted makes plans to leave for Sacramento to stay with his mother, but before leaving, he buys Mike a car and promises to fly his lady friend to Sacramento once he gets there and settled, exclaiming as he gets into the van to leave for the airport \\"bang 'em and leave 'em\\", referring to his recent activities with the woman. The following weeks find Ted frequenting at the local bar, his spending averaging $10,000 a week. He then purchases a $35,000 Dodge Ram and another truck for one of his recently acquired girlfriends, rents an apartment and buys furniture. The filmmakers then request that he meet with a financial planner. Ted meets with him, but firmly announces to him that he has no intentions of working and does not wish to plan ahead as he is only concerned with today. Ted states his belief that the financial planner is only after his money and rips up his card. His sisters repeatedly try to convince Ted to seek employment, although he still believes he is \\"set for life\\". By this time, Ted has become resentful to the film producers for giving him the money. The film then ends telling the viewer that, six months after finding the money, Ted refuses to disclose his latest bank balance; however, his sisters fear that it is less than $5,000. On a December 1, 2006 airing of The Oprah Winfrey Show entitled: \\"Are You Ready For a Windfall?\\", Ted and filmmaker Wayne Powers were on the program to promote the documentary and speak on their account of the experiment. When asked by Oprah how much of the $100,000 he still had, Ted replied \\"none.\\" Ted also mentioned that he is homeless again, and content with his current circumstances. As of July 2007, Ted was back in Pasadena and working for the same recycling plant shown in the film.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAJcDBxYc_E&index;=1&list;=PLJ0HiJvVrq6q0NmEk2dcM8Dcy0mjRhFe2 ==References== 2\\\\. https://factswt.com/a-homeless-person-was- given-100000-which-he-blew-in-less-than-6-months/ * == External links == * Category:Showtime (TV network) original programming Category:2005 television films Category:2005 films ","title":"Reversal of Fortune (2005 film)"},{"id":"6209146","text":"Frank Loucks Hereford, Jr. (July 18, 1923 – September 21, 2004) was the president of the University of Virginia from 1974 to 1985.

Delacorte Press) There Should Have Been Castles is a 1978 romantic comedy novel by Herman Raucher. It is a roman a clef, with Raucher acknowledging that the male and female main characters are based on him and his wife, to whom he had been married for twenty years at the time of the book's publication. ==Plot== It is the 1950s. Ben Webber is a cocky but disillusioned young man who has spent the last few years of his life waiting for a neighborhood girl—in his eyes, the epitome of lost virtue and beauty—to reach the age of consent so that he can marry her. Ben comes frustrated with his life, though, and leaves his family home in New England to travel to New York in hopes of finding himself. Despite possessing a near-genius IQ, Ben feels no need to strive in academics, instead choosing to toil away in a number of dead-end, low-paying jobs, which he invariably quits or gets fired from after either telling off his boss or getting caught stealing. Down to his last few cigars and without a place to stay, Ben has a chance run-in with Don at a coffee shop; impeccably dressed and exquisitely mannered, Don is nonetheless just as destitute as Ben and facing eviction from his own apartment unless he can find someone to help with the rent. Ben and Don quickly become friends, and Ben moves into Don's apartment, which Ben discovers is actually owned by a trio of airline hostesses who rent the apartment out to Don at a low rate in exchange for providing them anonymous, strings-free sexual favors on their occasional stopovers in town. Ben, a virgin, is initiated into sex by one of the stewardess, and falls in love with her, only to discover shortly thereafter that she is engaged; after one last night, the stewardess relinquishes her third of the apartment and leaves New York, leaving Ben heartbroken and morose. Meanwhile, nineteen-year-old Ginnie Maitland, the daughter of a wealthy painter and an unfaithful socialite, runs away from home after her father commits suicide in the wake of her mother's running off with another man. Cutting herself off from her inheritance, Ginnie travels to New York in hopes of finding herself and becoming a dancer on Broadway. Alone in the big city, Ginnie falls in with a pair of middle aged men, one Jewish, one Japanese, who are attempting to open a restaurant which serves food based on traditional Kosher and Oriental dishes. Ginnie becomes a hostess for them, and manages to get a job with a dance troupe. At the same time, Ben has managed to become a mailroom clerk for a movie studio, and begins an arduous climb up the corporate ladder; shortly after getting a promotion into writing taglines, however, he's drafted into the U.S. Army. Shortly after Ben is drafted, Ginnie's apartment burns down; one of the members of the dance troupe informs her that one of his friends is currently seeking help to pay the rent, since his old roommate has been drafted. The \\"friend\\" turns out to be Don, and Ginnie takes up residence with him. Ben goes through boot camp and is assigned to a base run by Major Holdoffer, a young, boorish soldier who delights in exerting his authority over the men in his command. Ben documents his hellish experiences in letters home to Don, lamenting the lost loves in his life and yearning for purpose; after Don leaves the letters out one day, Ginnie begins reading them and starts writing Ben back. Her letters prove to be a shining ray of hope to Ben, and the two begin falling in love through their correspondence. While Ginnie remains chaste, though, in hopes of losing her virginity to Ben, Ben releases his sexual frustrations with an emotionally dead but sexually predatory middle aged woman named Maggie. In a bit of dramatic irony, the reader becomes aware that the woman is in fact Ginnie's runaway mother, having dumped her lover and moved on to one-night stands with soldiers. One day, Ben's unit is taken on a dangerous trek by Holdoffer through harsh terrain without proper equipment; in the middle of the night, Holdoffer intentionally gives negligent orders to an elderly soldier after learning that the man is gay, resulting in the soldier's death; the next morning, Holdoffer denies culpability demands that the hike go on. Later in the day, Holdoffer ignores Ben's warning that a machine gun is malfunctioning, and another soldier is fatally shot in the face. As Ben and another soldier prepare to attack Holdoffer, the gay lover of the elderly soldier who died of exposure fatally stabs Holdoffer in the kidney. In exchange for keeping his mouth shut about having warned Holdoffer of the faulty machine gun, the Army agrees to an honorable discharge Ben on a technicality. Ben sleeps with Maggie one last time and then heads back to New York, where he and Ginnie begin a passionate affair. With one another's support, Ginnie becomes a locally renowned dancer, and Ben manages to get one of his scripts read by a television executive, who buys it and turns it into a movie of the week. However, Ginnie's increasingly busy schedule, coupled with Ben's self-destructive nature, leads to the pair splitting after a disastrous night. While Ben makes a financially successful but debauched trip to Hollywood, Ginnie reaches national fame as a variety show fixture and through her engagement to a prominent socialite—neither being far from the other's mind.

It included part of the marathon during the 2000 Summer Olympics, and the blue line denoting the marathon's path still exists today. ==Description== Anzac Parade starts at Driver's Triangle, a small park at the intersection of Moore Park Road and South Dowling Street at Moore Park.Gregory's 2002 Street Directory, 66th Edition It is a southward extension of Flinders Street, on the border of Surry Hills and Paddington. At this intersection there is also an entrance to the Eastern Distributor. The street received its name in memory of members of the First Australian Imperial Force (later to become known as Anzacs) who marched down the street from their barracks (now a heritage listed part of the University of New South Wales) to Sydney Harbour, where they were transported to Europe during World War I. Anzac Parade passes south through the suburbs of Moore Park, Kensington, Kingsford, Maroubra, Matraville, Malabar, Chifley and Little Bay before ending at a loop at La Perouse. It was designated State Route 70 from 1974 until 2004. Major landmarks along Anzac Parade include the University of New South Wales (UNSW) and the National Institute of Dramatic Art (known as NIDA), where a number of well-known actors (including Mel Gibson, Cate Blanchett and Judy Davis) received their training. In February 2015, the Albert Cotter Bridge across Anzac Parade opened. This pedestrian and cycle bridge was built to improve access to events at the Sydney Cricket Ground and Sydney Football Stadium.Shared path bridge over Anzac Parade at Moore Park Road & Maritime Services March 2014 == Naming == Anzac Parade began life as a series of discrete roadways through south-eastern Sydney, which were unified under one name in 1917. These streets were: * Randwick Road, between Moore Park and Alison roads, Moore Park * Eastern Avenue, between Alison Road and Lorne Avenue, Kensington * Bunnerong Road, between Lorne Avenue and Kingsford Nine Ways * Broad Road, between Nine Ways and the present-day Anzac Parade–Bunnerong Road intersection at Little Bay * Bunnerong Road, between Little Bay and La Perouse.Randwick City Council – Historic street and place names A-F Quambi Avenue, which ran between La Perouse tram terminus and the nearby wharf, was added to Anzac Parade in November 1934. ==Public transport== Light rail construction on Anzac Parade in 2016 The road is served by frequent State Transit Authority bus services, including Sydney bus routes 370, 391–399, 400, L94, M10 and M50 to the City, Railway Square, Leichhardt, Maroubra, Westfield Eastgardens, Coogee, Little Bay and La Perouse The road also contains a bus-only lane prior to its intersection with Alison Road, as well as a separate parallel bus corridor accompanying its route through Moore Park. It is one of the busiest road based public transport routes in Sydney. This is due to the lack of rail infrastructure in the area and the Sydney Football Stadium, Sydney Cricket Ground, Randwick Racecourse and the University of New South Wales, Long Bay Gaol and NIDA all being located on this road. On 13 December 2012, the NSW Government announced a commitment to build a CBD and South East Light Rail from Circular Quay down George Street to Central station, then across to Moore Park and down Anzac Parade. South of Moore Park the line will spit into two branches – one continuing down Anzac Parade to the nine ways at Kingsford, and the second heading to Randwick via Alison Road. Many of the bus routes that currently traverse Anzac Parade to access the city will be replaced by feeder routes connecting to the light rail. Construction commenced in 2015. In April 2016, work began on a temporary six-lane diversion of Anzac Parade between the Albert Cotter Bridge and Lang Road while a tunnel was built below the road. Traffic was directed on to the temporary road from mid-2016. The original alignment was reinstated in April 2017.Bus route and road changes on Anzac Parade for light rail construction Transport for New South Wales 25 May 2016 South of Kingsford, Anzac Parade is a divided road with a wide grassy median strip. This median strip was formerly used by a tram service. The line was closed in 1961, when the route was replaced by buses.Keenan, D. Tramways of Sydney.

Christian youth ministry usually encompasses one or more of the following: * encouraging young people (whether they have professed a faith or not) to learn more about a given faith and to become more involved in spiritual life * providing open youth clubs or other activities for the common good of the young people, sometimes without an overtly religious agenda As well as organizing events and activities, youth ministry will usually include some form of religious instruction and pastoral oversight of young people. The doctrine of Sunday Sabbatarianism held by many Christian denominations encourages practices such as Sunday School attendance as it teaches that the entirety of the Lord's Day should be devoted to God; as such many children and teenagers often return to church in the late afternoon for youth group before attending an evening service of worship. ==ChristianityProtestantism=== In Protestant churches, the term \\"ministry\\" often implies the service of an ordained minister or pastor. In youth ministry, however, this is not always the case — a youth ministry leader may be an ordained member of the clergy, an employed lay person, or a volunteer. Titles applied to youth ministry leaders vary widely as well, even within denominations, using terms such as \\"Youth Minister\\", \\"Youth Pastor\\", or simply \\"Youth Worker\\". ===Catholicism=== Catholic youth work covers a worldwide range of activities carried out with young people, usually in the name of the Catholic Church and with the intention of imparting the Catholic faith to them and inviting them to practice and live out the faith in their lives. Activities in the field range from small scale youth groups attached to parishes or Catholic schools, to large international gatherings, such as World Youth Day. It is a field which has evolved much over recent decades, especially in comparison to more formal methods of education or catechesis within the church. Nearly all dioceses and a great deal of parishes have some form of youth provision running, although a great deal of areas particularly in the developed world are finding youth work both more difficult and rare as the numbers of young people regularly practicing the Catholic faith continue to decline. In contrast, though, the new and exciting developments of recent decades and particularly the influence of the new movements within the church are ensuring that youth work continues to be an active and fruitful field. Catholic young people Unlike the case in some Protestant churches, a youth minister in the Roman Catholic Church is not a member of the clergy. Ministry, including youth ministry, is considered one of the functions within the Church because most believe that people should start learning about God at a young age so they have more time to grow spiritually through adulthood. Therefore, it is more likely for a Catholic youth minister or youth ministry leader to be a lay person, rather than an ordained priest. ==Unitarian Universalism== There are organizations within the Unitarian Universalist Association (the primary organization of Unitarian Universalist congregations in the United States), as well as within the Canadian Unitarian Council (the national body for Unitarian Universalist congregations in Canada), which minister to and with youth, of which Young Religious Unitarian Universalists (YRUU) is the largest and most apparent. YRUU strongly emphasizes youth empowerment, along with youth-adult partnership. There are also specific youth-oriented programs, such as Coming of Age, and Our Whole Lives, a lifespan sexuality education program with a youth age group. ==Education and career path== Youth ministers may be trained in an education specifically to work with youth. Many Bible and Christian universities and colleges now offer undergraduate and graduate degrees in youth ministry. While youth ministry was previously considered a stepping stone on the way to becoming priests, nuns and other important vocations, the trend is currently moving toward treating it as its own vocation. Most congregations or places of worship have a strict vetting process for their youth ministers, including but not limited to background checks, educational requirements and previous relevant experience. ==Youth Ministry Resources== In the world of Youth Ministry, there is a lot of work that gets put into every week. To help feed the beast, there are a handful of resources available. Most notably is a company by the name of Download Youth Ministry, which sells games and sermon resources that are authored by other youth pastors around the country. ==See also== *Adolescence *Christianity in the United States#Youth programs *List of youth organizations *Youth development *Youth program *Youth subculture ==External links== * http://youthmin.org A collection of information, resources, and training for those involved in youth ministry. * http://theyouthcartel.com Youth ministry resources, coaching, and training events.

The novel is a prequel to Fox Volant of the Snowy Mountain and was written a year after its literary predecessor. ==Plot== The story is set in the Qing dynasty during the reign of the Qianlong Emperor ( 1735–1796). The protagonist, Hu Fei, is a young martial artist who was raised by Ping A'si after the death of his father, Hu Yidao. While travelling around the land in search of adventure, Hu Fei encounters Feng Tiannan, a ruthless villain, and wants to kill him to deliver justice for the victims. He also meets a young maiden, Yuan Ziyi, who shows signs of affection towards him. She stops Hu Fei from killing Feng Tiannan each time when he is close to killing Feng. Based on what Ping A'si told him, Hu Fei believes that Miao Renfeng is responsible for his father's death. He refrains from killing Miao after finding him, because Miao has been tricked by an enemy and temporarily blinded by a deadly poison. He is so impressed with Miao's sense of chivalry that he starts wondering if Ping A'si was mistaken about Miao. He decides to help Miao and journeys to find a cure for his eyes. He meets Cheng Lingsu, an apprentice of a deceased medicine guru known as the \\"King of Venoms\\". Hu Fei witnesses Cheng Lingsu defeating her three wicked seniors with her calm and wit. She agrees to help him cure Miao Renfeng's eyes. When Miao Renfeng regains his sight, he confesses that he did kill Hu Yidao unintentionally several years ago. Hu Fei is filled with sorrow upon hearing the truth and he leaves with Cheng Lingsu. Cheng Lingsu and Hu Fei become sworn siblings. While travelling together, they chance upon an election for a new leader of the wulin (martial artists' community) hosted by the general Fuk'anggan. The election is part of Fuk'anggan's plan to instigate turmoil in the wulin and keep it under the Qing government's control. Hu Fei and Cheng Lingsu disguise themselves and participate in the event. With help from Yuan Ziyi, the trio combine efforts to expose Fuk'anggan's plot and disrupt the election. They are attacked by enemies and Hu Fei is poisoned while shielding Cheng Lingsu with his body. Cheng loses her life trying to save Hu and reveals to him before dying that she loves him. Hu is filled with anguish after hearing that. After Cheng's funeral, he meets Yuan Ziyi, who tells him that she had already taken an oath to be a Buddhist nun in her childhood, and hence cannot be together with him even though she loves him. She places her palms together and recites a silent prayer for him before leaving. ==CharactersProtagonists=== * Hu Fei () is the protagonist of the novel. * Hu Yidao () is a forthright and gregarious hero whose skills are legendary.

It is located in Gyeongju. The temple is recorded to have been built in 634 under the auspices of Queen Seondeok. Today the temple is still used by a small group of worshipers but in its heyday, the temple covered several acres and was one of the four main temples of the Silla Kingdom used by the state to ask the Buddha to bless the kingdom. The ruins of Hwangnyongsa Temple lay nearby. It is part of the UNESCO world heritage site Gyeongju Historic Areas. ==National Treasure No. 30== Bunhwangsa Pagoda around Buddha's Birthday. A notable ruin at the temple is the Bunhwangsa Pagoda (Kr. Bunhwangsa Seoktap, literally \\"Stone Pagoda of Bunhwangsa\\"), the oldest dated pagoda from the Silla Kingdom. The pagoda is National Treasure of Korea No. 30 and was designated by the South Korean government on December 20, 1962. The pagoda is based on prototypes from the Tang Dynasty in China. However, unlike Tang pagodas which were made from brick, Silla architects used stones of black andesite cut like brick. Each story of the pagoda is progressively smaller in size and each story’s roof is made by placing bricks in a staircase-like fashion. Today, only three tiers of the pagoda remain. Ancient records state the pagoda originally stood nine stories tall. A close up view of one of the pairs of Mighty Diamond Men. Also, note the debris visible within the doorway. Although once hollow, the collapsed stories of the pagoda have filled the center of pagoda with debris. An excavation and partial restoration in 1915 by the Japanese uncovered a sarira, or relic box, of the cremated remains of a priest hidden in between the second and third stories. Precious artifacts such as gold and stone ornaments, coins, scissors, and a needle were also found in the pagoda which indicated that a woman of royal blood, perhaps even Queen Seondeok herself, had once owned the objects. Each side of the pagoda has what may have once been doors into the interior of the pagoda. Two figures guard each doorway and are known as Geumgan-yeoksa (literally \\"Mighty Diamond Men\\" from Skt \\"vajra-yakṣa\\") or Inwangsang, guardians of the Buddhist canon. Each corner of the one-step platform upon which the pagoda rests holds a guardian lion statue. Granite lotus blossoms also adorn the pagoda. A contemporaneous pair of stone pagodas were built at the Baekje Mireuksa Temple and the Bunhwangsa Pagoda is often compared with them although those stone pagodas more closely imitated wood architectural styles. ==Gyeongsangbuk-do Cultural Property Material No. 9== Bunhwangsa Hogukyongbyeoneojeong Located at the temple complex is a well called Hogukyongbyeoneojeong (호국용변어정) or Samnyongbyeoneojeong from the Silla period. The well's octagonal upper part extends above the ground 70 cm/27.6 in height while the lower part of the well is cylindrical. The structure of the well represents Buddhism's essence. ===Legend=== According to legend in the Samguk Yusa, in 795, the 11th year of King Wonseong, missionaries from the Tang Dynasty visited Silla. The missionaries changed three dragons protecting Silla into small fish and took them away to Tang China with them, hidden in bamboo. The next day two women, identifying themselves as two of the dragons' wives, living in Dongji (pond) and Cheongji (pond), came to the king and asked the king to retrieve their dragon husbands taken away by the Tang missionaries. The king immediately sent his men in to bring back the dragons, permitting them live in the Bunhwangsa well. ==Gyeongsangbuk-do Tangible Cultural Property No. 97== Monument pedestal of Hwajaengguksa (화쟁국사) erected in 1101 at the wish of King Sukjong. Only the stele, with its original calligraphy, remains. This monument appeared to have been destroyed in 1597 (the 30th year of King Seonjo's reign) when the temple was destroyed, and only the pedestal of the monument was left. The historical research of Chusa Kim Jeong-huI, who visited the temple at the end of the Joseon Dynasty, revealed that it was a monument erected by Wonhyo. Some of the inscriptions were written on the site of the Daedonggeumseokseo, which was discovered in the Bunhwangsa Temple compound in 1976, and are located in the museum of Dongguk university. ==Gyeongsangbuk-do Cultural Property Material No. 317== Yaksayeorae (약세여래), a statue built in 1774, during the 50th year of King Yeongjo. ==Flagpole holder== Also of note is the flagpole holder which survives from the Silla era. == See also == * Queen Seondeok of Silla * Hwangnyongsa * List of Korea-related topics * Mireuksa * Korean Buddhist temples * Korean Buddhism * National treasures of Korea * National treasures of North Korea ==References External links == * Asian Historical Architecture: Bunhwangsa Temple * Bunhwangsa Seoktap * Bunhwangsa Category:Korean pagodas Category:Stone pagodas Category:Pagodas in South Korea Category:Buddhist temples in Gyeongju Category:National Treasures of South Korea Category:Silla ","title":"Bunhwangsa"},{"id":"6209383","text":"Matthew Christopher Breeze (born 10 June 1972) is an Australian association football referee.

It had training pitches for the first team and youth categories as well as facilities for club members, such as swimming pools and recreational rooms. At the time, Real Madrid also had sections devoted to other sports, such as tennis, and these athletes trained there as well. The site also contained the Pabellón Raimundo Saporta, built in 1966, where Real Madrid's basketball team played its home games for 38 years. Some of Europe's greatest players, including Dražen Petrović and Arvydas Sabonis of later NBA fame, once called it home. ===Controversy=== By the end of the 20th century the land surrounding the Ciudad Deportiva was no longer on the outskirts of Madrid, but had become a transportation hub with the north of the city and a financial area. Its location along the Castellana further increased the land's value. With Real Madrid's debts mounting in the late 1990s, plans to re-zone and commercially develop the land were mooted several times, but it wasn't until the presidency of Florentino Pérez that these plans came to fruition. Although commonly believed to be a direct transaction in which Real Madrid sold the land to the Madrid city council, this is not in fact what happened. In 2000 there was a motion proposed, voted on, and approved in the Madrid parliament to re-zone the area of the Ciudad Deportiva, which until then was zoned for non- commercial purposes. In this vote, the Partido Popular (People's Party) and the Izquierda Unida (United Left) voted in favor, the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) voting against. The agreement between Real Madrid and the local government stipulated that in exchange for re-zoning the land Real Madrid would cede a portion of the land to the Government. Then, in public project bids, both Real Madrid and the Government sold their portions to four corporations, Repsol YPF, Mutua Automovilística de Madrid, Sacyr Vallehermoso and Obrascón Huarte Lain (OHL), for which Real Madrid earned an estimated 480 million euros. These four corporations were, as of August 2006, constructing four skyscrapers on the site which would become their headquarters as part of the Cuatro Torres Business Area. The government also gained land which they sold in public bidding, and a large amount of greenspace. Although unnamed clubs requested that the European Union investigate the transaction, the EU found no wrongdoing or evidence of state subsidies. ===Ciudad del Madrid=== With a portion of the funds obtained from the Ciudad Deportiva, Real Madrid constructed new training facilities in Valdebebas, which like the Ciudad Deportiva in 1963, are currently on the outskirts of the city. The new facilities, named Ciudad Real Madrid and inaugurated in 2005, are extremely modern and at 1.2 square kilometres are ten times larger than the former facilities. This is the widest sport facility built in the world. In these facilities we can find the training fields for all the teams of the different categories, the press room, restaurant, training fields for the first team, and the Alfredo di Stéfano Stadium (where the reserve team, Real Madrid Castilla plays its matches). Real Madrid President who was at the origin of this city, Florentino Perez, said about it: \\"If the Real Madrid is universal, this will be its capital. A city opened to anyone, a football dream: The Real Madrid city\\".

A nocturnal is an instrument used to determine the local time based on the relative positions of two or more stars in the night sky. Sometimes called a horologium nocturnum (time instrument for night) or nocturlabe (in French and occasionally used by English writers), it is related to the astrolabe and sundial. Knowing the time is important in piloting for calculating tides and some nocturnals incorporate tide charts for important ports. Even if the nightly course of the stars has been known since antiquity, mentions of a dedicated instrument for its measurement are not found before the Middle Ages. The earliest image presenting the use of a nocturnal is in a manuscript dated from the 12th century.Farre i Olive E., (1996): La Sphaera Horarum Noctis de Ramon Llull, \\"La Busca de Paper\\" n. 22, Primavera, p. 3-12 (edicion bilingue) Raymond Lull repeatedly described the use of a sphaera horarum noctis or astrolabium nocturnum.Raimon Lull, Liber Principorum medicinae in Opera omnia, vol.1, Chap. 36, par.30, Mainz, 1721; Earlier Lull mentions the nocturnal in his Nova geometria (1299). With Martín Cortés de Albacar's book Arte de Navegar, published in 1551 the name and the instrument gained a larger popularity.Harriet Wynter and Anthony Turner, Scientific Instruments, Studio Vista, 1975, It was described also c. 1530 by Petrus Apianus in his Cosmographicus Liber, republished later by Gemma Frisius with a widely circulated illustration of the instrument while being used by an observer. ==Construction== A nocturnal made in Vienna. Nocturnals have been most commonly constructed of wood or brass. A nocturnal will have an outer disc marked with the months of the year, and an inner disc marked with hours (and perhaps half hours, or quarter hours on the largest instruments) as well as locations for one or more reference stars. It will also have a pointer rotating on the same axis as the discs, sometimes extended beyond the rim. The axis, or pivot point, must be such that a star can be sighted through it; usually a hollow rivet is used. Since the instrument is used at night, markings may be exaggerated or raised. Often the inner disc has a diagram of the necessary constellations and stars, to aid in locating them. ==Usage== Operating scheme of a nocturnal. A nocturnal is a simple analog computer, made of two or more dials, that will provide the local time based on the time of year and a sighting of Polaris, the North Star, and one or more other stars. In the northern hemisphere, all stars will appear to rotate about the North Star during the night, and their positions, like the progress of the sun, can be used to determine the time. The positions of the stars will change based on the time of year. The most commonly used reference stars are the pointer stars from the Big Dipper (Ursa Major) or Kochab from the Little Dipper (Ursa Minor). The star Schedar in Cassiopeia may also be used, since it is on the opposite side of the sky from Ursa Major. The inner disc is rotated so that the mark for the chosen reference star points to the current date on the outer disc. The north star is sighted through the center of the device, and the pointer arm is rotated to point at the chosen reference star. The intersection of the pointer arm with the hour markings on the inner disc indicates the time. The instrument must be held upright, and should have a handle or similar hint as to which direction is down. It is not possible to convert the local time to a standard time such as UTC without accurate knowledge of the observer's longitude. Similarly, it is not possible to determine longitude unless the observer also knows the standard time from a chronometer. ==See also== * Sidereal time ==References *British Museum – Nocturnal from an astrological compendium *Simulation – Video and description, also, many devices *A working nocturnal in coin form Category:Navigational equipment Category:Astronomical instruments Category:Historical scientific instruments ","title":"Nocturnal (instrument)"},{"id":"6209434","text":"The Painted Turtle is a Summer camp located near Lake Elizabeth in Lake Hughes, California. The camp is for children who are faced with life- threatening and chronic illnesses. Many of these children would not have the opportunity to have a camping experience due to their illness. The year-round programming for campers and their families is provided free of charge. ==History== The Painted Turtle was founded in 1999 by Paul Newman and Page and Lou Adler. The camp was conceptualized by Adler and soon was able to get Newman to sponsor it as a part of his Hole in the Wall Gang Camps. The camp got its name from the painted turtle, a widespread species found in most of the United States (but not native to California). Adler says, \\"It's an animal that has a tough exterior and a soft interior, very much like these kids that we're serving.\\" The camp opened its doors in the Fall of 2003. The camp suffered damage during the Power House Fire in 2013. Several outbuildings and facilities were destroyed in the fire which caused the organization to cancel all summer sessions that had been planned for the year. Beside the direct damage from the fire itself, the air conditioning systems located in cabins and buildings throughout the camp had been compromised by smoke and ash and had to be cleaned. ==Camp experiences== Activities include horseback riding, ropes course, arts and crafts, woodshop, archery, team building experiences, fishing, boating, singing and dancing. Campers stay in small dormitory type housing units called bales. Many different groups come through the camp every year and stay for about a week. These groups include: #Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis (inflammatory bowel disease) #Skeletal dysplasia (dwarfism) #Asthma #Kidney transplant #Diabetes #Arthritis #Liver transplant #Spina bifida #Hemophilia #Muscular dystrophy #Primary immunodeficiency disease Several family weekends are also held in the spring and fall where families of children can get a taste of the camp experience. The facility also offers a program that takes the camp experience to children who are hospitalized and too ill to attend the camp. ==Corporate contributions== Several companies have made substantial contributions in order to help the foundation build the facilities at the camp. PacifiCare Health Systems (now part of UnitedHealth Group) provided funds to build the camps \\"Well Shell\\" building. This building is staffed by a team of medical professionals during camp sessions treating campers requiring routine treatment for their illnesses like infusions and Dialysis along with the normal scrapes, cuts and bruises suffered during their time at the camp. Rooms throughout the facility are decorated to resemble a tiki hut and other scenery. The Los Angeles Lakers provided the floor for the camp's gymnasium and Sea World provided funding for the camp's swimming pool which is shaped like a killer whale.Molina, Christina M. \\"The Magic of the Painted Turtle\\" 2011 August 4, The Tolucan Times. Retrieved 2012 August 18 ==Volunteers== The Painted Turtle is run with the help of volunteers. In 1995, the then Hole in the Wall Camps became The Phi Kappa Tau fraternity's national philanthropy program. Now known as SeriousFun Children's Network, the Fraternity recognises this camp and the entire network as their national philanthropy program. In June 2006 a national collegiate sorority, Delta Zeta, partnered with The Painted Turtle. Given this partnership the camp became a part of the sorority's national philanthropy program. ==See also== *Hole in the Wall Camps ==References * *Newsmaker: The Painted Turtle (30-min.

The trunk is erect, about 4 m tall and 12 cm in diameter. Fronds may be bi- or tripinnate and 1–2 m in length. The stipe of this species is partly persistent and is sometimes retained on the upper trunk. It is warty, bears conical spines, and is sparsely covered with scales. These scales may be either small and fringed or bullate. Sori are borne near the fertile pinnule midvein. They are protected by very small, often bilobed indusia. Large and Braggins (2004) note that A. incisoserrata is similar to Alsophila latebrosa, from which it differs in pinnule morphology and in having scales throughout the length of the stipe. ==References== incisoserrata Category:Endemic flora of Borneo ","title":"Alsophila incisoserrata"},{"id":"6209489","text":"Georges (George) Emile Léonard Theunis (28 February 1873 – 4 January 1966) was the 24th Prime Minister of Belgium from 16 December 1921 to 13 May 1925 and again from 20 November 1934 to 25 March 1935.

It is a portrait of life in Johannesburg – and \\"what-what\\": home, habit, change, memory, mortality, friendship, ghosts, gardens, walking, falling, selling, stealing ... Neither a novel nor a collection of short stories, the book consists of 138 short texts organised in two parts – Point A and Point B – followed by Notes and Sources, Itineraries and an Author’s Note. Written by a consummate literary artist, this is a unique dossier of city life and a selective self-portrait of the author – in Vladislavic’s words, “a bit like a map that shows only the side streets”. \\"Memory takes root only half in the folds of the brain: half’s in the concrete streets we’ve lived along.\\" – Lionel Abrahams, poet and author. From Portrait with Keys, Point A, section 68: “In Johannesburg, the Venice of the South, the backdrop is always a man- made one. We have planted a forest the birds endorse. For hills we have mine dumps covered with grass. We do not wait for time and the elements to weather us, we change scenery ourselves, to suit our moods. Nature is for other people, in other places ...” \\"The major themes of Portrait with Keys ... are the I-beams that make up the chassis. Subsidiary themes, such as crime and art and architecture, are the brakes and suspension ... The little snippets – for instance, the list of car-guards’ notes – are the city’s rivets and bolts exploded out along their dotted diameters.\\" \\\\- William Dicey, author and book designer. ==Reviews== * The Weekender * Mail & Guardian * The Star Tonight * The Citizen Category:South African books ","title":"Portrait with Keys"},{"id":"6209512","text":"Helicon () is an Israeli record label. ==History== Helicon Records was founded in 1985.

After retiring from football he took up coaching to become the reserve team coach for Wenzhou Tomorrow until he left at the beginning of the 2010 league season. ==Playing career== Zhang started his football career with his local football team Liaoning F.C. where he progressed to their senior team in 1994 league campaign at the dawn of full professionalism within the Chinese game. He was initially loaned out to third-tier club Beijing Shougang before he went on to make his debut for Liaoning where he soon made a name for himself when he was the club's top goalscorer in the 1997 campaign. By the following season he would show himself to be a prolific striker who helped guide Liaoning to promotion to the top tier. Once in the top division Zhang quickly adapted to the higher demands and narrowly saw Liaoning miss out on winning the league title. As a young, tall and strong prolific centre forward, Zhang quickly caught the imagination of the Chinese tabloid press who often referred to him as the David Beckham of China, however at the height of his popularity on April 26, 2000 he was involved in a serious car accident. It was discovered that Zhang was drink driving while driving some teammates and friends home, however while Zhang sustained minor injuries his teammate Qu Leheng sustained serious injuries, which resulted in Qu being left a paraplegic and consigned to a wheelchair for life. Qu would go on to successfully sue Zhang 2.34 million yuan (282,000 US dollars) for compensation on November 22, 2004. Zhang would also go on to make a public apology to Qu and despite publicly believing that the compensation was especially high he decided to abnegate his right to ask for a retrial. While his trail to Qu went on Zhang was able to return to his football career and made his international debut against Egypt in a friendly on January 17, 2001 that ended in a 0–0 draw. English club Leicester City were interested in signing Zhang on loan in November 2001 however, the Home Office was doubtful that he had not played regularly for the national team, rejecting his application for a work permit. Leicester did rekindle their interest in him in November 2004, after being recommended by Bobby Houghton, though he again failed in his work permit. Instead Zhang signed on for Shanghai Shenhua for a reported ten million yuan in the 2003 league season where he went on to win the league title in his debut campaign with them. Unfortunately in 2013 the Chinese Football Association would revoke the league title after it was discovered the Shenhua General manager Lou Shifang had bribed officials to be bias to Shenhua in games that season. Unable to replicate his performances from his youth Shenhua decided to loan Zhang to Australian side Queensland Roar where he played under Frank Farina. His time at the club was not a success and he only made six appearances, which was not helped by his pack-a-day smoking habit. Shenhua would eventually decide to sell Zhang back to his hometown club of Liaoning for 600,000 yuan in 2008, however he would not play for them and decided to retire at the end of the season. ==Career statisticsClub=== Last update: 23 Nov 2015 {  style=\\"text-align: center;\\" !Season!!Team!!Country!!Division!!Apps!!Goals - 1994align=\\"left\\"Liaoningalign=\\"left\\"1?? - 1995align=\\"left\\"Beijing Shougangalign=\\"left\\"2?? - 1996align=\\"left\\"Liaoningalign=\\"left\\"2?? - 1997align=\\"left\\"Liaoningalign=\\"left\\"2?11 - 1998align=\\"left\\"Liaoningalign=\\"left\\"2?14 - 1999align=\\"left\\"Liaoningalign=\\"left\\"1238 - 2000align=\\"left\\"Liaoningalign=\\"left\\"11711 - 2001align=\\"left\\"Liaoningalign=\\"left\\"11911 - 2002align=\\"left\\"Liaoningalign=\\"left\\"1135 - 2003align=\\"left\\"Shanghai Shenhuaalign=\\"left\\"12213 - 2004align=\\"left\\"Shanghai Shenhuaalign=\\"left\\"1103 - 2005align=\\"left\\"Shanghai Shenhuaalign=\\"left\\"1145 - 2006align=\\"left\\"Shanghai Shenhuaalign=\\"left\\"181 - 06/07align=\\"left\\"Queensland Roar FCalign=\\"left\\"160 - 2008align=\\"left\\"Liaoningalign=\\"left\\"100 } ===International goals=== {  style=\\"text-align: left;\\" !#!!Date!!Venue!!Opponent!!Score!!Result!!Competition - 1February 12, 2001National Stadium, Bangkok, Thailand1–02–22001 King's Cup - 2February 12, 2001National Stadium, Bangkok, Thailand2–02–22001 King's Cup - 3February 14, 2001National Stadium, Bangkok, Thailand1–05–12001 King's Cup - 4February 14, 2001National Stadium, Bangkok, Thailand2–05–12001 King's Cup - 5February 14, 2001National Stadium, Bangkok, Thailand4–05–12001 King's Cup - 6August 5, 2001Shanghai Stadium, Shanghai, China3–03–02001 Four Nations Tournament - 7February 3, 2004Tianhe Stadium, Guangzhou, China1–02–1Friendly - 8February 7, 2004Shenzhen Stadium, Shenzhen, China1–02–1Friendly } ==HonoursPlayer=== Club Liaoning F.C. *Chinese FA Super Cup: 1999 Shanghai Shenhua *Chinese Jia-A League: 2003 (revoked due to match-fixing scandal) Individual *Chinese Jia-B League Top Goalscorer: 1998 ==References * Player profile with Queensland Roar FC * Category:Chinese footballers Category:Beijing International Studies University people Category:1977 births Category:Chinese football managers Category:Footballers from Shenyang Category:Chinese expatriate footballers Category:China international footballers Category:Liaoning F.C. players Category:Shanghai Greenland Shenhua F.C. players Category:Brisbane Roar FC players Category:A-League players Category:Living people Category:Association football forwards ","title":"Zhang Yuning (footballer, born 1977)"},{"id":"6209537","text":"Malvina Pray (1827or?1830 -1906), known famously as Mrs. W. J. Florence. William Jermyn Conlin (July 26, 1831 – November 19, 1891) better known by his stage name William J. Florence, was a US actor, songwriter, and playwright. Florence awarded the ribbon of the French Societe Histoire Dramatique.Britannica, Micropædia Ready Reference, University of Chicago, Vol 4, p 839, 1988 He was also co-founder with Walter M. Fleming of the Shriners, a Masonic Order. ==Biography== Born of Irish parents and raised in New York City, Florence worked at various jobs before becoming a call boy at the Old Bowery Theater. While working to support his widowed mother and her seven younger children, he rehearsed plays at night, and in 1850 he began to do dialect impersonations. In 1853 he married Malvina Pray,Note. Sister of actress Maria Pray, wife of actor Barney Williams - Derby, George, White, James Terry - The National Cyclopedia of American Biography, Vol. 5, 1897, p. 440 - Mrs. Barney Williams Dead-The New York Times, May 7, 1911, p. 11 and thereafter the two generally appeared together on the stage; he usually as an Irishman and she as a Yankee. Florence gained national prominence with a forty-year career in which he excelled at playing the humorous and poetic Irish character. Ticket-of-Leave Man was presented by him more than one thousand times on national tours. In his later years he partnered with actor Joseph Jefferson as half of a comedy duo. Carolyn Grattan Eichin, From San Francisco Eastward: Victorian Theater in the American West, (Reno: University of Nevada Press, 2020), 221, 227-8 From Malvina's observation of wealthy American on vacation abroad, Florence asked Benjamin Edward Woolf to write The Mighty Dollar, that the couple would perform in over 2,500 times during the mid-1870s and well into the 1880s.The Mighty Dollar.- The Indiana Democrat; February 18, 1886; pg. 4 Conlin was fond of Florence, Italy, where he had an apartment, and adopted the city for his stage name.Gaylor Bronson Conlin, Sr., b. 1913, d. 10-17-2004 At some point after he became famous under this name, he secured the legal right to it. Florence's first success was in A Row at the Lyceum (1851); following this, he established his reputation as Captain Cuttle in Dombey and Son, Bob Brierly in The Ticket-of-Leave Man, and Sir Lucius O’Trigger in The Rivals. His last appearance was as Zekiel Homespun in a production of Heir-at-Law.

When civil war broke out between Ptolemy XIII and Cleopatra, Arsinoë sided with Ptolemy, escaping the palace in Ganymedes's company to take command of the army. She executed Achillas, who was the general of the army and Pothinus's co-conspirator in the murder of Pompey, and appointed Ganymedes in his stead.Julius Caesar, Commentarii de Bello Civili 3.112.10-12; De Bello Alexandrino 4; Cassius Dio, Roman History 42.39.1-2 and 42.40.1; Lucan, Pharsalia 10, 520-523 While Achillas besieged Alexandria, Ganymedes' army was in possession of the sources of the river, which gave him control of the canals that provided Alexandria with water, and, by extension, Caesar's water supply. With this in mind, he separated his portion of the river from Caesar's, and engineered machines to fill up Caesar's canals and cisterns with salt water. Several days of increasingly brackish water panicked Caesar's legionaries to the point where Caesar had to deal with the situation personally. Aware that Alexandria was built on limestone, and that limestone was porous, Caesar ordered wells built, restoring the water supply and calming his soldiers.De Bello Alexandrino 5-9; Cassius Dio, Roman History 42.38.4; Plutarch, Caesar 49.6 Two days after Caesar frustrated Ganymedes' ploy, the Thirty-Seventh Legion, traveling by sea and also desperately short of water, arrived in Egypt but was unable to land at Alexandria due to contrary winds. Caesar went out with his fleet to personally attend to the matter but several of his sailors, sent ashore to find water, were captured by Ganymedes' cavalry, who then informed their general of Caesar's location. Marshalling every ship at his disposal, Ganymedes then engaged Caesar in a naval battle, but Caesar prevailed,De Bello Alexandrino 10-11; Cassius Dio, Roman History 42.38.3 whereupon the disheartened Alexandrians almost gave up the fight. However, Ganymedes succeeded in rallying them once again, and prepared a larger fleet for another engagement, which this time he was sure he could win. This battle, however, against Caesar's admiral Euphranor, resulted in an even more devastating defeat for Ganymedes.De Bello Alexandrino 12-16; Cassius Dio, Roman History 42.40.3 Switching tactics, Ganymedes then focused on bombarding Caesar's forces. This failed to impress Caesar's veterans, although it did result in a stalemate. Afterward, a delegation of Alexandrians petitioned Caesar to return Ptolemy XIII to them, in exchange for Arsinoë, as they had grown weary of Arsinoë and Ganymedes and wished for their King to lead them. Soon, however, Caesar received reinforcements and won the decisive battle. Ganymedes subsequently perished in flight (47 BC).Florus, Roman History 2.13.60 == Notes  References == * Werner Huß, Ägypten in hellenistischer Zeit (Egypt in hellenistic times), Munich 2001, p. 716-718.

While in high school, Johnson began studying and performing improvised comedy through the Canadian Improv Games. She was also involved in high school plays at Kitsilano Secondary School as well as being in the senior youth ensemble at Arts Umbrella where she performed in such plays as A.R. Gurney's The Dining Room. Johnson moved to Blue Lake, California in 1998 to study full-time at the Dell'Arte International School of Physical Theatre. ==Career== Upon completion of her studies, Johnson moved to Toronto, Ontario, Canada, in 2000 to continue her work in clowning and non-literary theatre. In the next few years she would co- found a small physical theatre studio (Clown Hall), write and produce touring shows for her clown persona 'ruby', become a producer and featured performer for emerging live improv show Catch23 Improv, begin working with comedy collaborator Graham Wagner and act in an array of student and independent films. ===Iron Cobra=== In 2002, Johnson co-founded the improv comedy duo Iron Cobra (with Graham Wagner). The duo began as a loose, ad-hoc team at the competitive improv show Catch23 Improv and eventually moved on to larger shows, audio recordings and international touring. Iron Cobra toured to festivals in Atlanta, Edmonton, Minneapolis, Nashville, Vancouver, Winnipeg and Chicago with their particular brand of aggressive awkward comedy. Iron Cobra was nominated for one Canadian Comedy Award in 2004 as best improv troupe. They were also nominated for the local Tim Sims Encouragement Fund Award in 2004 and made their only television appearance as part of the attached Cream of Comedy show on the Canadian Comedy Network. Iron Cobra eventually disbanded officially in 2010 when Wagner moved to Los Angeles to pursue a career as a television writer.

In the early 2000s, she collaborated with a collection of emerging directors including her high school friend and roommate, Hazel Bell-Koski and Bell- Koski's fellow film students at Ryerson Polytechnic University. The most prolific of these collaborations would be with director Pat Mills with whom she worked on three projects over three years. Early titles include: Secondary High (2002); The Water Game (2002); The Affected Turtleneck Trio (2001); I'm Not Martin! (2000); and Uranium (2004).

He was noted as playing in bands formed by ex-Deep Purple singer Ian Gillan, and later worked extensively in composing soundtracks for film, television and commercials. Learning piano as a child, by the age of 13 he was earning money playing at weddings and birthdays in his neighbourhood of the East End of London. He went on to play in numerous dance bands, jazz ensembles and also became a session musician. His main musical passion is jazz and he has made several well-received albums together with his big band, the Mask Orchestra. He has also founded an independent record label, Provocateur. ==Career== In 1976 he was recruited as keyboardist to replace Mickey Lee Soule in the Ian Gillan Band. Over the time he developed an increasing interest in composing, and Gillan credits the Towns-penned 'Fighting Man' as pointing the direction in which Gillan should go. Gillan dissolved the band, with its jazz-rock leanings, and retained only Towns, putting together the rockier Gillan. Encouraged by Gillan, Towns co-wrote many of the songs for the new band. Whilst with the band he used his free time to seek opportunities to compose music beyond the Heavy metal direction of Gillan. His 1980 solo album remains unreleased, although one track was reworked for the 'For Gillan Fans Only' LP, and Making Faces was released in 1982. He submitted a demo soundtrack for the 1977 Mia Farrow-starring film Full Circle, which received reviews praising the music. With bassist John McCoy, Towns guested on Samson's 1979 album 'Survivors'. In 1982, Towns played with the Spanish rock band Barón Rojo, when they recorded Volumen Brutal. In 1982, Ian Gillan dissolved the band, and Towns decided to pursue soundtrack composing full-time. In that year he won the commission to write the score for the film Slayground. From then on he was in constant demand, particularly in British television, where his body of work is extensive, and includes Chiller, An Unsuitable Job for a Woman, The Buccaneers, The Crow Road, Dalziel and Pascoe, Ghostboat, Rockface, Into the Blue, The Blackheath Poisonings, Bodyguards, Cadfael, Clarissa, Capital City, Noah's Ark, Pie in the Sky, The Beggar Bride, Our Friends in the North, Between the Lines, Mobile, Cold Blood, Anglo-Saxon Attitudes, Doc Martin, Half Broken Things, Foyle's War, Ivanhoe, Hot Money, Deceit and Imogen's Face. He also composed the music for the popular children's animation series Angelina Ballerina as well as several other animation series and films for children including The World of Peter Rabbit and Friends, The Story Store, Truckers, The Willows in Winter, The Wind in the Willows, The Tale of Jack Frost, Oi! Get Off our Train, Toot and Puddle, Fungus the Bogeyman, The Sandman and Faeries. His other film credits include Rawhead Rex (1986), Bellman and True (1987), Vampire's Kiss (1988, starring Nicolas Cage), Getting It Right (1989), The Wolves of Willoughby Chase (1989), Hands of a Murderer (1990, starring Edward Woodward), The Puppet Masters (1994, featuring Donald Sutherland), Captives (1994, featuring Tim Roth), Space Truckers (1996, featuring Dennis Hopper), Guest House Paradiso (1999), Essex Boys (2000), Man Dancin' (2003), Crimson Rivers II: Angels of the Apocalypse (2004), and Red Mercury (2005). Several times he has worked for the German director Claudia Garde for the TV-series Tatort. Towns' principal musical passion is jazz and has released several albums with the big band he founded, the Mask Orchestra. A long-term collaboration with the Italian-born jazz singer Maria Pia De Vito began in 1996. ==References *Colin Town's official website *Colin Towns at Provocateur Records *Behind the Mask Unofficial Colin Towns Website * * *Colin Towns at Discogs Category:1948 births Category:Living people Category:English keyboardists Category:English film score composers Category:People from West Ham Category:Male film score composers Category:English television composers Category:English male composers Category:Musicians from London Category:Gillan (band) members Category:Ian Gillan Band members ","title":"Colin Towns"},{"id":"6209685","text":"Raymond Ronald Jones (born 25 April 1939, Thornton Heath, Croydon, Surrey), better-known as Wizz Jones, is an English acoustic guitarist, singer and songwriter. He has been performing since the late 1950s and recording from 1965 to the present. He has worked with many of the notable guitarists of the British folk revival, such as John Renbourn and Bert Jansch. ==Early days== Jones became infatuated with the bohemian image of Woody Guthrie and Jack Kerouac and grew his hair long. His mother had started calling him Wizzy after the Beano comic strip character \\"Wizzy the Wuz\\" because at the age of nine Raymond was a budding magician. The nickname stuck throughout his school years and when he formed his first band, \\"The Wranglers\\", in 1957 the name became permanent. Bert Jansch later said, \\"I think he's the most underrated guitarist ever.\\" In the early 1960s he went busking in Paris, France, and there mixed in an artistic circle that included Rod Stewart, Alex Campbell, Clive Palmer (Incredible String Band) and Ralph McTell. After a couple of years travelling throughout Europe and North Africa he returned to England and married his longtime girlfriend Sandy to raise a family. In 1965, his only single was released: Bob Dylan's \\"Ballad of Hollis Brown\\". By this time the skiffle boom was over but one of the stars of that movement, Chas McDevitt, used Jones' guitar-playing on five albums in 1965 and 1966. Another musician on those sessions was the bluegrass banjo-player, Pete Stanley. In 1966, Jones and Stanley released an album, Sixteen Tons of Bluegrass, but this partnership broke down in 1967, as Jones then turned solo. ==The folk period== Jones performing in Portugal, 2015 Jones started to become a singer-songwriter. His first solo album was Wizz Jones in 1969. Eight of the songs were written by his long-time friend Alan Tunbridge. Up to 1988, ten solo albums followed and he played on Ralph McTell's single \\"Easy\\" in 1974. Steve Tilston was also guided by Jones, through the early stages of his career. Jones was once described as having 'a right hand worthy of Broonzy', referring to the Blues Guitarist Big Bill Broonzy. Most of his recordings from this period are long out of print. He briefly joined acoustic folk-rock group Accolade (other band members Don Partridge, Brian Cresswell and Malcolm Poole) in 1971 as backing guitarist, and is featured on the group's second album Accolade II. Another brief excursion, as a member of the traditional folk band Lazy Farmer in 1975, produced an album that was reissued in 2006. Jones has always maintained a high level of popularity in Germany, since the mid–1970s, and he stills tours mainland Europe every year. The early 1990s were a quiet period. He almost disappeared from public view. When in the mid-1990s he appeared on the Bert Jansch television documentary Acoustic Routes, there was renewed interest in his work. In 2001, he led John Renbourn and other members of Pentangle on the album Lucky The Man. In 2007, The Legendary Me and When I Leave Berlin were reissued on CD by the Sunbeam record label. On 30 May 2012, Bruce Springsteen opened the sold-out Wrecking Ball concert at Olympic Stadium in Berlin, Germany, with Jones's song, \\"When I Leave Berlin\\". In 2015, Jones toured with John Renbourn, playing a mixture of solo and duo material, before Renbourn died in March that year. An album by the pair, titled Joint Control, was released in 2016. ==DiscographySolo albums=== *Wizz Jones (1969) *The Legendary Me (1970) *Right Now (*) (1972) *Winter Song (E.P.)

The Saab Variable Compression engine was a development project of Saab Automobile, for which it won an award both in 2000 and 2001. In a normal internal combustion engine, because cylinder bore diameter, piston stroke length and combustion chamber volume are almost always constant, the compression ratio (CR) for a given engine is almost always constant. One exception is the experimental Saab Variable Compression (SVC) engine, designed for the Saab 9-5. This engine uses a technique that dynamically alters the volume of the combustion chamber, thus changing the compression ratio. To alter the combustion chamber volume, the SVC 'lowers' the cylinder head closer to the crankshaft. It does this by replacing the typical one-part engine block with a two-part block, with the crankshaft in the lower block and the cylinders in the upper portion. The two blocks are hinged together at one side. By pivoting the upper block around the hinge point, the volume of the combustion chamber can be modified. In practice, the SVC adjusts the upper block through a small range of motion, using a hydraulic actuator. This design was originally patented by Gregory J. Larsen of Lakeland, FL USA.

Seoksu could also be placed in the pile of the stone and rubble used to surround the tomb and can be found carved on the bases of pagodas. ==Types== Stone animal statues, named seongmul (석물, 石物) came in various forms, including but not limited to lions, horses, oxen, elephants, pigs, tigers or the mythical animal haetae. ==King Muryong's tomb== Another view of the Seoksu One such figure was found in the center aisle of the tomb of King Muryeong. It is 30.8 centimeres in height, 48 centimeters in length, and 22 centimeters in width. The animal is somewhat realistic, depicting a tail and anus. However, a steel horn shaped like a leaf and flame patterns depicting wings which run from the left and right of the body and on the legs show that it is not based on a real creature. The Seoksu has a blunt mouth and a big nose without nostrils. The mouth has remnants of red paint on it, suggesting that the figure was once brightly painted. Although this Seoksu is of a lower quality than some of the other treasures found within the tomb, it is especially valuable because it is the first stone figure excavated buried with Baekje kings.

Their first record, Walking Home from Nicole's, was released one year later with significant help from singer/songwriter Karen Jo Fields. ==History== In November 2001, the band saw the addition of guitarist Jon Arild Stieng and the trio went on tour for the first time in the spring of 2002. Berczelly left the band and concentrated full-time on producing, which he has done for the band ever since. The band's next album, If I Told You, You Were Beautiful, was recorded in Stieng's house in Oslo that same summer, and was released in October. Keyboardist Harald Sommerstad joined Minor Majority for their subsequent tour of spring 2003. Prior to the Norwegian Quart-festivalen the same year, the band was extended further by drummer Halvor Høgh Winsnes (Fast Winston Doom of Thulsa Doom) and bassist Henrik Widerøe. The group was complete, and in the late summer, Up for You & I was recorded at Sommerstad's cabin near Halden in the south of Norway. The album was released in January 2004, and was an immediate success, boasting 24 weeks on the official Norwegian albums chart, a gold record, and numerous award nominations for best Norwegian pop album of the year. After the following tour of more than 100 gigs both nationally and abroad (France, Switzerland, and Germany), the band spent the greater part of 2005 in Berczelly's studio, and released their fourth album, Reasons to Hang Around, in January 2006. For it, they were awarded the Norwegian Grammy equivalent, Spellemannsprisen. 2007 saw the release of the compilation album Candy Store. After this release, Minor Majority embarked on a Norwegian tour in September, followed by tours of Germany, France, and Switzerland during the first four months of 2008. The band stated in 2007 that they intended to have a pause from making music, but that they eventually would make at least one more album.Minor Majority tar pause - Musikk - NRK In 2009 they released their next record, Either Way I Think You Know, which reached number eleven on the Norwegian charts.

When he was twelve, his father was laid off and the Scolopi, a religious foundation dedicated to the education of the poor, offered him a free place in seminary. He studied theology at Rome, then Letters and Philosophy at Florence. The foundation of the Centro d'Impegno Cristiano \\"Cenacolo\\" (Centre for Christian Commitment) in 1952 gave him the chance to intensify both his friendship with the charismatic mayor of Florence Giorgio La Pira, and his relationship with the author-priest Lorenzo Milani and the disciples of Jacques Maritain, known as the 'Little Brothers'. In 1958 Balducci founded the monthly review Testimonianze (\\"Testimonies\\"), which he directed for 34 years. In 1963 he openly defended the first Italian conscientious objector, Giuseppe Gozzini. His articles, and the subsequent trial, gave the bishop of Florence, monsignor Florit, the opportunity to \\"exile\\" Balducci. He stayed in Rome, very near the Second Vatican Council, until 1965 when, thanks to the direct intervention of Pope Paul VI, he went back to Tuscany. Not in Florence, however, where bishop Florit was still involved in his confrontation against La Pira, but at the abbey named Badia Fiesolana, two hundred yards from the border of the diocese of Florence. Despite the isolation of the abbey, he had less and less time for his studies, as most of his days were taken up by the magazine Testimonianze, by the publishing house \\"Cultura della pace\\", (\\"Peace culture\\"), by his cooperation with daily papers and other periodical and by his direct and unflagging attendance at dozens of demonstrations and debates all over Italy. He campaigned against the grounds of war, both before and after the Gulf War, and used the five hundredth anniversary in 1992 of the Christopher Columbus' discovery of the Americas, as the occasion to put the very foundations of modernity in question, and these campaigns became a point of reference for the large Italian peace movement. It was while returning from one of these debates that Ernesto Balducci was involved in a car accident. He was admitted to hospital in coma, and died on 25 April 1992. ==The Planetary Human== Ernesto Balducci analysed religions in relation to their capacity to be or not to be sources of a historic salvation. A salvation that does not remain in the alienating extra-historic and existential level. The most modern themes of the Protestant theology come together in this reflection, from Karl Barth to Dietrich Bonhoeffer, with their intention of dividing religion and faith and overturning the point of view focused on God for showing up the Human, instead. The post-religious human. In Balducci's view, the religions are the millenary legacy of cultural particularisms, as ideological, political, cultural and spiritual cohesion tools for cultural monads that, however, have lost their individuality. By facing up to the apocalyptic threats of modern war, now religions have two possible functions. Either a regressive function of protective recall to particular identities, or a prophetic ferment function for the transaction to the \\"planetary era\\". A ferment in deeper affinity with their very founding intuitions. According to Balducci, the reclamation of religious identities has to be based on a lay approach to the peace question in order to bring into play each of the various memories of mankind. All this without abandoning certain universal achievements of the Western culture, like the principle of the preeminence of conscience with respect to any law, the correlative principle of the State of Right and the Scientific Method. The synthesis of the \\"Planetary Human\\" aims to involve disparate subjects in the name of a fundamental subjectivity that identifies itself with the species. The crisis of modernity drives Balducci to define the terms of a newly- grounded Social contract of the World community. The Reason, stripped of the Western people's «hyperbolic subjectivity», plays a fundamental role, so far. By taking the suggestions of Ernesto de Martino, Balducci believes that the long \\"prehistory\\" of narrow communication among cultural \\"islands\\", in which the fear of the different has been a reflex that has cemented the tribe, is over. Even the aggressiveness against the other groups made sense as long as there were not the unifying frameworks of the planet. But the menaces to the survival of the human species unify the destiny of everyone. The mankind, from the \\"homination phase\\", goes on to the planetarization (globalization) phase. Balducci observes that Anthropology – originally based on the ontology of the \\"difference\\" (the others and us, peoples of culture and peoples of nature, civilized and primitives) – then discovered the possibility of different ways to be humans in the time and the space. By repudiating its own earlier assumptions, Anthropology recognizes the longing of each peculiar human expression towards a universal rule that joins humans, and them with nature. This is the sense that Balducci catches in various cultural itineraries: the structuralism of Claude Lévi-Strauss, the \\"ecology of mind\\" of Gregory Bateson, the generative grammar of Noam Chomsky. Balducci bases his thought on such yearning towards the universal. Many of its symbolizations are about the dialectic between particular and universal dimensions of the human. He borrows from Ernst Bloch the dialectic between the \\"cultured human\\" (homo editus) and the \\"hidden human\\" (homo absconditus), a dialectic between the being and the being able to of the human, an aspiration that is a transcendence without transcending, a «transcendence in the immanence» The Balducci crossing appears to be a sort of anthropologic teleology which represents an evolutionary trend that the human being can support or disclaim in its path. The reason, as said by Balducci, finds a brand-new categorical imperative: > «Act only according to that maxim by which you can at the same time will > that the human species would find the reasons and the guarantees of its > survival» (in La terra del tramonto). Balducci recognized in the declining freedom of action of states and in the growth of the cosmopolitan right an element deeply rooted in the evolutionary laws of human species. The faith in Man (a Pierre Teilhard de Chardin concept), the consideration that our species has always creatively got over many severe and extreme challenges, the chance of the \\"planetary human\\": all this things make sense to Balducci if the sense of belonging with a supranational community will generate a planetary political project. A project that matches the world community, an entity arising «on the strength of the evolutionary laws of the species, the same laws that lead from the tribe to the city, from the city to the nation-state.» In order to decipher the momentum towards the establishment of a world community, Balducci recalls two categories of the natural law: the pactum unionis and the pactum subjectionis. The former momentum is identified in view of the anthropologic pacifism, which horizon is a society that is made compact by relationships of spontaneous reciprocity and by the preferential option for non-violence. The second momentum relies on the perspective of the political realism, oriented to extend to the entire planet the process of unification relying upon the monopoly on the legitimate use of physical force. The dialectic between these two momentums has to give birth to the «new child» of the new era, the world community. > Novelty depends upon the womb of necessity. No wonder if there is the > darkness on the intermediate stages of its birth.

He was a member of the Couperin family of musicians, of which the most notable were his great uncle Louis and his cousin François. == Biography == Couperin was born in Paris. His mother died when he was only 17 months old and he was raised by his father, Nicolas, also a composer and the successor to François \\"Le Grand\\" as organist at St. Gervais Church in 1748. Nothing is known of Couperin's education, though his library at the time of death contained 885 books, unusual for a musician and evidence of scholarly interest. At age 21, Couperin's father died without leaving a will, making him the sole heir of both his parents. His inheritance included Nicolas's post at St. Gervais. In 1752, Couperin married Elisabeth-Antoinette Blanchet, a professional musician and the daughter of the best harpsichord maker in France, François-Etienne Blanchet. They had four children, three of whom became musicians. Couperin and his wife taught harpsichord lessons and she was the organist at the abbey of Montmartre. Following his departure from St. Gervais, Couperin's many posts included St. Barthélemy (to 1772), St Jean-en-Grève, the convent of the Carmes-Billettes, Notre Dame (from 1755), the Sainte Chapelle (from 1760), Sainte Marguerite, and the royal chapel (from 1770). Couperin died at age 61 in Paris in a traffic accident while hurrying from Vespers at Ste. Chapelle to St. Gervais. == Music == References to Couperin by his contemporaries, including Charles Burney, laud his improvisational virtuosity (often on the Te Deum hymn) and established his reputation as one of the two best organists of the era. Nevertheless, only one piece for organ exists today. Couperin did not publish his church music and he refused to write for the theater. His surviving works are almost exclusively for the keyboard, or keyboard and small chamber ensemble. Unlike many of his contemporaries, Couperin remained attached stylistically to la grande tradition française, and his pieces have been criticized for their lack of modernity. However, David Fuller cites his experimental impulse and urge to explore the possibilities of instruments. An example is his Simphonie de clavecins, the only work in existence that requires two harpsichords with genouillères (knee-levers that allowed diminuendos). ==Works== * 3 cantatilles (lost) : Le Printemps, La Jeunesse, La Vieillesse * Cantatille pour l’Amour Médecin (soprano, 2 violins, bass) (1750) * Pièces de Clavecin, Opus I (1751) * Sonates en pièces de clavecin, Opus II (1765) * Sonates en trio (1770) * Quatuors à deux clavecins (1773) * Symphonie * Dialogue entre le chalumeau et le basson, for organ (1775) * Variations pour clavecin: ** sur l’air Vous l’ordonnez (1775) ** Aria con variazione (1781) ** sur l’air Richard Cœur de Lion (1784) * Several motets of which only one remains: Motet au Saint Sacrement (1787) ===Pièces de Clavecin (1751)=== * La Victoire * Allemande * Courante, La de Croissy * Les Cacqueteuses * La Grégoire * L'Intrépide * Premier menuet, deuxième menuet * L'Arlequine ou la Adam, rondeau * La Blanchet * La de Boisgelou * La Foucquet * La Sémillante ou la Joly * La Turpin * Première gavotte, seconde gavotte * Premier menuet, second menuet * La du Breüil * La Chéron * L'Affligée * L'Enjouée * Les tendres Sentiments * Rondeau * Les quatre nations ** L'Italienne ** L'Angloise, rondeau ** L'Allemande ** La Françoise ==References== * David Fuller and Bruce Gustafson: \\"Couperin, Armand-Louis\\", Grove Music Online, ed.

Fishing tackle is the equipment used by anglers when fishing. Almost any equipment or gear used for fishing can be called fishing tackle. Some examples are hooks, lines, sinkers, floats, rods, reels, baits, lures, spears, nets, gaffs, traps, waders and tackle boxes. Gear that is attached to the end of a fishing line is called terminal tackle. This includes hooks, leaders, swivels, sinkers, floats, split rings and wire, snaps, beads, spoons, blades, spinners and clevises to attach spinner blades to fishing lures, and tools that make it easy to tie knots. Sometimes the term fishing rig is used for a completed assembly of tackle ready for fishing. Fishing tackle can be contrasted with fishing techniques. Fishing tackle refers to the physical equipment that is used when fishing, whereas fishing techniques refers to the manner in which the tackle is used when fishing. The term tackle, with the meaning \\"apparatus for fishing\\", has been in use from 1398 AD. Fishing tackle is also called fishing gear. However the term fishing gear is more usually used in the context of commercial fishing, whereas fishing tackle is more often used in the context of recreational fishing. This article covers equipment used by recreational anglers. ==Hook, line and sinker== Hook, line and sinker is a classic combination of tackle empowering an angler to catch fish. ===Hooks=== A fish hook The use of the hook in angling is descended, historically, from what would today be called a \\"gorge\\". The word \\"gorge\\", in this context, comes from an archaic word meaning \\"throat\\". Gorges were used by ancient peoples to capture fish. A gorge was a long, thin piece of bone or stone attached by its midpoint to a thin line. The gorge would be fixed with a bait so that it would rest parallel to the lay of the line. When a fish swallowed the bait, a tug on the line caused the gorge to orient itself at right angles to the line, thereby sticking in the fish's gullet. A fish hook is a device for catching fish either by impaling them in the mouth or, more rarely, by snagging the body of the fish. Fish hooks have been employed for millennia by anglers to catch fresh and saltwater fish. Early hooks were made from the upper bills of eagles and from bones, shells, horns and thorns of plants (Parker 2002). In 2005, the fish hook was chosen by Forbes as one of the top twenty tools in the history of man. Fish hooks are normally attached to some form of line or lure device which connects the caught fish to the angler. There is an enormous variety of fish hooks. Sizes, designs, shapes, and materials are all variable depending on the intended purpose of the hook. They are manufactured for a range of purposes from general fishing to extremely limited and specialized applications. Fish hooks are designed to hold various types of artificial, processed, dead or live baits (bait fishing); to act as the foundation for artificial representations of fish prey (fly fishing); or to be attached to or integrated into other devices that represent fish prey (lure fishing). ===Lines=== Fishing line with hooks attached A fishing line is a cord used or made for fishing. The earliest fishing lines were made from leaves or plant stalk (Parker 2002). Later lines were constructed from horse hair or silk thread, with catgut leaders. From the 1850s, modern industrial machinery was employed to fashion fishing lines in quantity. Most of these lines were made from linen or silk, and more rarely cotton.Henshall, James (Dr.), Book of the Black Bass (1881) Modern lines are made from artificial substances, including nylon, polyethylene, dacron and dyneema. The most common type is monofilament made of a single strand. Anglers often use monofilament because of its buoyant characteristics and its ability to stretch under load. Recently alternatives such as fluorocarbon, which is the least visible type, and braided fishing line, also known as 'superlines' because of their small diameter, minimal amount of stretch, and great strength relative to standard nylon monofilament lines. Important parameters of a fishing line are its breaking strength and its diameter (thicker, sturdier lines are more visible to fish). Factors that may determine what line an angler chooses for a given fishing environment include breaking strength, diameter, castability, buoyancy, stretch, color, knot strength, UV resistance, limpness, abrasion resistance, and visibility. Fishing with a hook and line is called angling. In addition to the use of the hook and line used to catch a fish, a heavy fish may be landed by using a landing net or a hooked pole called a gaff. Trolling is a technique in which a fishing lure on a line is drawn through the water. Snagging is a technique where the object is to hook the fish in the body. ===Sinkers=== Three types of small lead sinkers A sinker or plummet is a weight used when angling to force the lure or bait to sink more rapidly or to increase the distance that it may be cast. The ordinary plain sinker is traditionally made of lead. It can be practically any shape, and is often shaped round like a pipe-stem, with a swelling in the middle. However, the use of smaller lead based fishing sinkers has now been banned in the UK, Canada and some states in the US,MPCA Home > Sustainability > Reduce Reuse Recycle > Nontoxic Tackle: Let's get the lead out! since lead can cause toxic lead poisoning if ingested. There are loops of brass wire on either end of the sinker to attach the line. Weights can range from a quarter of an ounce for trout fishing up to a couple of pounds or more for sea bass and menhaden. The swivel sinker is similar to the plain one, except that instead of loops, there are swivels on each end to attach the line. This is a decided improvement, as it prevents the line from twisting and tangling. In trolling, swivel sinkers are indispensable. The slide sinker, for bottom fishing, is a leaden tube which allows the line to slip through it, when the fish bites. This is an excellent arrangement, as the angler can feel the smallest bite, whereas in the other case the fish must first move the sinker before the angler feels him. ==Fishing rods== Fishing with a fishing rod A fishing rod is an additional tool used with the hook, line and sinker. A length of fishing line is attached to a long, flexible rod or pole: one end terminates with the hook for catching the fish. Early fishing rods are depicted on inscriptions in ancient Egypt, China, Greece and Rome. In Medieval England they were called angles (hence the term angling). As they evolved they were made from materials such as split Tonkin bamboo, Calcutta reed, or ash wood, which were light, tough, and pliable. The butts were frequently made of maple. Handles and grips were made of cork, wood, or wrapped cane. Guides were simple wire loops. Modern rods are sophisticated casting tools fitted with line guides and a reel for line stowage. They are most commonly made of fibreglass, carbon fibre or, classically, bamboo. Fishing rods vary in action as well as length, and can be found in sizes between 24 inches and 20 feet. The longer the rod, the greater the mechanical advantage in casting. There are many different types of rods, such as fly rods, tenkara rods, spin and bait casting rods, spinning rods, ice rods, surf rods, sea rods and trolling rods. Fishing rods can be contrasted with fishing poles. The line on a fishing rod is controlled with a specialised reel which allows accurate casting. A fishing pole does not have a reel. Instead the line is just tied directly to the tip of the pole, or is tied to some sort of elastic mechanism at the tip. Poles can be up to 18 m in length and are made of optional sections which can be slotted together by the angler. ==Fishing reels== A spinning reel A fishing reel is a device used for the deployment and retrieval of a fishing line using a spool mounted on an axle. Fishing reels are traditionally used in angling. They are most often used in conjunction with a fishing rod, though some specialized reels are mounted on crossbows or to boat gunwales or transoms. The earliest known illustration of a fishing reel is from Chinese paintings and records beginning about 1195 A.D. Fishing reels first appeared in England around 1650 A.D., and by the 1760s, London tackle shops were advertising multiplying or gear-retrieved reels. Paris, Kentucky, native George Snyder is generally given credit for inventing the first fishing reel in America around 1820, a bait casting design that quickly became popular with American anglers. ==Fishing bait== ;Natural baits Green Highlander, an artificial fly used for salmon fishing. The natural bait angler usually uses a common prey species of the fish as an attractant. The natural bait used may be alive or dead. Common natural baits include bait fish, worms, leeches, minnows, frogs, salamanders, nightcrawlers and other insects. Natural baits are effective due to the lifelike texture, odour and colour of the bait presented. The common earthworm is a universal bait for fresh water angling. In the quest for quality worms, some fishers culture their own worm compost or practice worm charming. Grubs and maggots are also considered excellent bait when trout fishing. Grasshoppers, flies, bees and even ants are also used as bait for trout in their season, although many anglers believe that trout or salmon roe is superior to any other bait. Studies show that natural baits like croaker and shrimp are more recognized by the fish and are more readily accepted. A good bait for red drum is menhaden. Because of the risk of transmitting whirling disease, trout and salmon should not be used as bait. Processed baits, such as groundbait and boilies, can work well with coarse fish, such as carp. For example, in lakes in southern climates such as Florida, fish such as bream will take bread bait. Bread bait is a small amount of bread, often moistened by saliva, balled up to a small size that is bite size to small fish. ;Artificial baits Many people prefer to fish solely with lures, which are artificial baits designed to entice fish to strike. The artificial bait angler uses a man-made lure that may or may not represent prey. The lure may require a specialised presentation to impart an enticing action as, for example, in fly fishing. Recently, electronic lures have been developed to attract fish. Anglers have also begun using plastic bait. A common way to fish a soft plastic worm is the Texas rig. ==Bite indicators== A bite indicator, also referred to as a strike indicator, is a mechanical or electronic device which indicates to an angler that something is happening at the hook end of the fishing line. There are many types of bite indicators—which work best depends on the type of fishing. Devices in wide use as bite indicators include fishing floats, which float in the water and dart about if a fish bites, and quiver tips, which are mounted onto the tip of a fishing rod. Bite alarms are electronic devices which bleep when a fish tugs a fishing line. Floats and quiver tips are visual bite detectors, while bite alarms are audible bite detectors. In fly fishing a commonly used indicator is the \\"hopper dropper rig\\". With this technique a nymph or wet fly is hung from the bottom of a floating dry fly. This doubles the chance of a strike from a fish. ==Spears== Filipino Negritos traditionally used bows and arrows to shoot fish in clear water.March, Alden (1899) The history and conquest of the Philippines and our other island possessions; embracing our war with the Filipinos in 1899 Page 39. Spearfishing is an ancient method of fishing conducted with an ordinary spear or a specialised variant such as a harpoon, trident, arrow or eel spear. Image of an eel spear.Spear fishing for eels . Harpoons are spears which have a barb at the end. Their use was widespread in palaeolithic times.Guthrie, Dale Guthrie (2005) The Nature of Paleolithic Art. Page 298. University of Chicago Press. Cosquer cave in Southern France contains cave art over 16,000 years old, including drawings of seals which appear to have been harpooned. Tridents are spears which have three prongs at the business end. They are also called leisters or gigs. They feature widely in early mythology and history. Modern spears can be used with a speargun. Some spearguns use slings (or rubber loops) to propel the spear. Polespears have a sling attached to the spear, Hawaiian slings have a sling separate from the spear, in the manner of an underwater bow and arrow. A bow or crossbow can be used with arrows in bowfishing. ==Nets== Fishing for salmon with a hand net on the Fraser River, Canada Fishing nets are meshes usually formed by knotting a relatively thin thread. Between 177 and 180 the Greek author Oppian wrote the Halieutica, a didactic poem about fishing. He described various means of fishing including the use of nets cast from boats, scoop nets held open by a hoop, and various traps \\"which work while their masters sleep\\". Ancient fishing nets used threads made from leaves, plant stalk and cocoon silk. They could be rough in design and material but some designs were amazingly close to designs we use today (Parker 2002). Modern nets are usually made of artificial polyamides like nylon, although nets of organic polyamides such as wool or silk thread were common until recently and are still used. Hand nets are held open by a hoop, and maybe on the end of a long stiff handle. They have been known since antiquity and may be used for sweeping up fish near the water surface like muskellunge and northern pike. When such a net is used by an angler to help land a fish it is known as a landing net. In the UK, hand- netting is the only legal way of catching glass eels and has been practised for thousands of years on the River Parrett and River Severn. Cast nets are small round nets with weights on the edges which is thrown by the fisher. Sizes vary up to about four metres in diameter. The net is thrown by hand in such a manner that it spreads out on the water and sinks. Fish are caught as the net is hauled back in.Casting net. ==Traps== Vietnamese traditional fish trap. Fishing traps are culturally almost universal and seem to have been independently invented many times. There are essentially two types of trap, a permanent or semi-permanent structure placed in a river or tidal area and pot- traps that are baited to attract prey and periodically lifted. They might have the form of a fishing weir or a lobster trap. A typical trap can have a frame of thick steel wire in the shape of a heart, with chicken wire stretched around it. The mesh wraps around the frame and then tapers into the inside of the trap. When a fish swims inside through this opening, it cannot get out, as the chicken wire opening bends back into its original narrowness. In earlier times, traps were constructed of wood and fibre. ==Fish stringer== A fish stringer is a line of rope or chain along which an angler can string fish that have been caught so they can be immersed and kept alive in water.Toth, Mike (2000) The Complete Idiot's Guide to Fishing Basics Second edition, pp. 158–159, Penguin. . ==Fly fishing tackle== Fly fishing tackle is equipment used by, and often specialised for use by fly anglers. Fly fishing tackle includes fly lines designed for easy casting, specialised fly reels designed to hold a fly line and supply drag if required for landing heavy or fast fish, specialised fly rods designed to cast fly lines and artificial flies, terminal tackle including artificial flies, and other accessories including fly boxes used to store and carry artificial flies. ==Tackle boxes== Typical tackle box with rod and bait bucket Fishing tackle boxes have for many years been an essential part of the anglers equipment. Fishing tackle boxes were originally made of wood or wicker and eventually some metal fishing tackle boxes were manufactured. The first plastic fishing tackle boxes were manufactured by Plano in response to the need for a product that didn't rust. Early plastic fishing tackle boxes were similar to tool boxes but soon evolved into the hip roof cantilever tackle boxes with numerous small trays for small tackle. These types of tackle boxes are still available today but they have the disadvantage that small tackle gets mixed up. Fishing tackle boxes have also been manufactured so the drawers themselves become small storage boxes, each with their own lids. This prevents small tackle from mixing, and can turn each drawer into a stand-alone container which can be used to carry small tackle to a rod some distance from the main tackle box. ==Tackle industry== Worldwide, the recreational fishing tackle industry is big business, worth over five billion US dollars annually in the United States alone.2006 National Survey of Fishing, Hunting, and Wildlife-Associated Recreation U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service, page 9. Notable brands include The Shakespeare Company, Orvis, Lindy Legendary Fishing Tackle and Simms Fishing Products. ==NotesReferences== * Burdon (1951) A Consideration of the Classification of Fishing Gear Asia- Pacific Fishery Commission, Technical paper. * FAO: Fishing gears and methods * FAO: Search Technology Fact Sheets: Fishing Gear type * Fridman AL and Carrothers PJG (1986) Calculations for fishing gear designs (FAO fishing manual), Fishing News Books. * Klust, Gerhard (1982) Netting materials for fishing gear FAO Fishing Manuals, Fishing News Books. .

Colonia Dublán began as a Mormon colony, located in the state of Chihuahua, Mexico. It is now a part of Nuevo Casas Grandes Municipality. It is one of two surviving Mormon colonies in Mexico (the other being Colonia Juárez). ==History== The Edmunds Act, or Edmunds Anti-Polygamy Act of 1882, was passed by the United States Congress in response to unrest about the Mormon practice of polygamy. It made polygamy a felony in U.S. territories and revoked polygamists' voting rights and their ability to serve on juries. These restrictions applied not only to those practicing polygamy but also to all members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints who professed belief in the church's doctrine of plural marriage. The Edmunds-Tucker Act of 1887 provided further sanction, making polygamy punishable by fines and imprisonment. Mormons who practiced polygamy did not discontinue the practice; rather, they tried to maintain it in secret. As a result, many children were either kept hidden or their paternity was kept hidden. These families, which were already complicated, were struggling under the new legal strictures. Federal marshals frequently patrolled the Utah territory on horseback looking for polygamists, and many of the church leaders were arrested. Many of the community's business and political leaders were forced underground, disrupting the community at large. Several men were called in 1875 to serve missions in Mexico, where they preached to Mexican people and scouted for land for potential future colonization. These missionaries were impressed with the city of Chihuahua, which had many buildings and churches, including a cathedral. Other groups of missionaries followed. In 1879, a Belgian man named Emilio Biebuyck who had been to Utah and was very influential in Mexico had permission from the Mexican government to establish colonies in the Mexican states, with land and subsidies to be given to colonizers. He petitioned the Council of the Church to accept this offer, but the Council determined they were not yet ready to establish colonies in Mexico. In 1885, several church leaders rented 300 acres of land in northern Chihuahua, and Mormon members began to plant crops. Other Mormon families from Utah and Arizona soon joined their fledgling community. Six weeks after the original settlers began to cultivate the area, the colonists numbered 350. Certain local officials became suspicious of the increase in the Mormon refugees and their activities. They appealed to the Secretary of the State of Chihuahua, characterizing them as an armed band and implying they had nefarious intentions. The settlers were given orders to leave within 16 days. Some of the church leaders were given an audience with the governor of Chihuahua, who had had dealings with Mormons in the past and been favorably impressed. He welcomed them as colonists. The first Mormon pioneers arrived in Mexico in 1885, founding Colonia Díaz. In 1888, George M. Brown of Provo, Utah, made a deal with German-Mexican Lewis Huller for of land north of what was then the Casas Grandes River. The colony, which was originally called Colonia Huller, was first settled by George Lake, a Mormon colonist, with many others following in the spring of 1889. However, due to a problem with the deal between Brown and Huller, titles to the land could not be given to them. Instead, the colonists were forced to rent from locals or make their own individual purchases. When it was founded, the nearest train station to the colony was Gallego, away. Since a large percentage of goods consumed by the colony had to be imported from the United States, prices were high. In 1897, a railroad was built from Ciudad Juárez to a point twelve miles (19 km) outside of Dublán. The railroad proved extremely valuable for the colony, as goods could be cheaply imported and exported.Romney (1938), pp. 95-101 The Mexican colonies were founded to provide shelter from the Mormons' perceived persecution and legal restrictions of the United States, and also created new opportunities to do proselytizing. Families that participated in this colonization effort did so with the intention to build a home refuge for their families and intended for their posterity to remain there. While they escaped the threat of persecution for practicing polygamy, they faced other difficulties in the form of disease, political unrest, conflict with the Mexican population, and drought. The colonists suffered under extreme poverty as they built their homes and farms and did whatever low-paying jobs they could find. But after years of effort, the colonies began to flourish and demonstrated industry and culture. They were laid out in the same foursquare design with wide streets used in Salt Lake City and bore a strong resemblance to other Mormon settlements. Mexican revolutionaries saw much to be disgusted by: they were Americans, they were wealthier than their Mexican neighbors, and they enjoyed many privileges given them by the government of Porfirio Diaz. In addition, they made no secret of their loyalty to the United States and perpetuated racial segregation. Consequently, the Rebels forced them out in 1912. They were given an order to leave their homes and return to the United States on July 28. Within two days, almost all of the colonist had fled, with the hope that this would be a temporary exile. But when some of the residents returned in the autumn of 1912 and later in 1915, they discovered that the warring factions had burned most of the settlers' property and little could be salvaged from the rubble. Most of the colonists resettled in Utah and Arizona. A few of the original settlers returned to Colonia Dublan and Colonia Juarez, but none of the other six colonies were ever resettled.Unloading supplies brought by railroad for the U.S. army In 1916, Colonia Dublan was chosen for the headquarters of the Pancho Villa Expedition for its proximity to the railroad.Toulmin (1935), pp. 49, 91, 101, 115-116William G. Hartley, Lorna Call Alder & H. Lane Johnson, Anson Bowen Call: Bishop of Colonia Dublán, 2007, pp. 86-99. The community was also the birthplace of George W. Romney, governor of the U.S. state of Michigan and father of 2012 U.S. presidential candidate Mitt Romney. ==Present day== Colonia Dublán is currently a very small town located just north of Nuevo Casas Grandes. Most of the remaining colonizers engage in agriculture and produce crops such as peaches, apples, pecans and chile. There is also significant production of wheat and cattle. Most members of the Mormon community are now of Mexican descent. The remaining descendants of the colonizers belong to the LDS Church and continue to serve a role within that church in Mexico. ==NotesReferences== *Hardy, Blaine Carmon, 1934- (1963).

The Second Angel is in part what is known as hard science fiction and frequently uses footnotes to bring attention to complex scientific explanations throughout the novel. == Plot summary == In The Second Angel, passages of narrative by an omniscient narrator alternate with lengthy, discursive commentaries on the characters, and complex observations on human nature and blood by a first-person, intrusive narrator, who claims to be the omniscient narrator telling the story, but deliberately refrains from disclosing his or her identity until the last chapter. It is the late 21st century, when 80% of mankind have been infected with a virus called HPV2 (human parvovirus 2), or P2, whose spread was accelerated with the discovery and use of synthetic blood. P2 disrupts the blood's ability to carry hemoglobin around the body, greatly shortening the host's life. The only known cure for P2 is a complete blood transfusion with healthy blood, coupled with a dose of the drug ProTryptol 14. With only 20 percent of the world's population free of P2, the price of a litre of healthy blood has reached almost two million dollars. In the novel, blood has replaced gold and diamonds as a valuable commodity (gold was extracted in great quantity from the sea and is now valued at about $200 a kilogram). Uninfected people reside in \\"Clean Bill of Health\\" (CBH) zones within cities to avoid contact with the sick, for vamping (murder for the purpose of blood theft) is a major risk for healthy individuals. Standard procedure for those who are uninfected is to perform autologous donations to enable them to completely replace it in the event of becoming infected. The healthy blood reserves are kept in state-of-the-art blood banks around the world, the largest being the First National Blood Bank on the Moon. Due to the high incidence of theft in these banks, they are guarded by the most sophisticated security systems. The greatest designer of blood banks is Dana Dallas, who works for one of the largest security firms in the world, and has designed several state-of-the-art blood banks, including the First National Blood Bank. His ingenious security systems have never before been bypassed or robbed. His boss, Simon King, grows concerned when he hears that Dallas's daughter Caro has been diagnosed with thalassemia, an illness that can only be cured by a lifetime of regular healthy blood transfusions, as despite his high position in the company Dallas would never be able to afford to pay for this treatment. Rather than risk Dallas leaking industrial secrets to the highest bidder, he orders Rimmer, the company's security officer, to kill Dallas, his wife and his daughter. His wife and daughter are indeed killed, but by chance Dallas survives and realises that the company had meant to kill him too. Dallas escapes to relative safety outside the city's Clean Bill of Health zone, hiding in a hyperbaric hotel. Dallas is now set on revenge and recruits a team funded by himself and a mafia boss to rob the First National Blood Bank on the moon. The robbery goes according to plan with only a few complications. On the way back to Earth, Dallas is told by his personal computer that a quantum computer has actually evolved in the bloodbank; the intrusive, omniscient narrator turns out to be this computer (a super-computer that opportunistically used the millions of litres of blood stocked in one place to re-create itself, using the unique storage and duplicating capacity of DNA); it has gained access to the memories of the characters by \\"merging\\" with them when they had a blood transfusion. The blood contains extremely advanced nanomachines which activate an ability to live longer, and be far more resistant to human limitations such as the need for food, water and oxygen; it enables them to survive in a state of suspended animation for years at a time. The supercomputer wanted to combine humans and computers with nanomachines in order to explore the galaxy. While Dallas and his crew are asleep on their way back to Earth, the supercomputer (unbeknownst to the humans) activates their new hibernation state and sets their course to deep space.

His main contribution to internal medicine was the introduction of the lumbar puncture for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. After 1874, his main area of research was pulmonary medicine. ==Biography== Born at Frankfurt an der Oder, Heinrich was the son of prominent physician Hermann Quincke and the younger brother of physicist Georg Hermann Quincke. He received his doctorate in 1863 from the University of Berlin, having studied previously at the University of Heidelberg and at the University of Würzburg under Rudolf Virchow and Albert von Kölliker. In 1865, Quincke worked with physiologist Ernst Wilhelm von Brücke at the University of Vienna, and in 1866, he became the assistant to the surgeon Robert Ferdinand Wilms. He was an \\"Assistenzarzt\\" (subordinate physician) in internal medicine under Friedrich Theodor von Frerichs at the Charité in Berlin until 1870. In 1873, Quincke became a professor of internal medicine at the University of Berne. Five years later, he moved to the University of Kiel and became a professor emeritus in 1908. He died in Frankfurt am Main, where he had been giving lectures until his death. Quincke received an honorary doctorate (LL.D) from the University of Glasgow in June 1901. ==Discoveries== He was perhaps the first (1882) to recognize angioedema which is often referred to as \\"Quincke's edema\\". \\"Quincke's pulse\\", with redness and pallor seen under the fingernails, is one of the signs of aortic insufficiency. \\"Quincke's puncture\\" is a somewhat outdated eponym for lumbar puncture, used for the examination of the cerebrospinal fluid in numerous diseases such as meningitis and multiple sclerosis.

The Kaplińskis were a Frankist family; his grandfather Eliasz Adam Kapliński was one of the last known Frankists. Leon Kapliński studied law and philosophy in Warsaw and Wrocław (Breslau). He was engaged in revolutionary underground groups, fled from the part of Poland under Russian rule, was briefly held and interrogated by the Prussian police, and took part in the revolutionary movement in 1848. In the same year, Kapliński emigrated to Paris where he spent most of his remaining years. He took part in Polish émigré political activities, closely connected with the circle of Hotel Lambert and the Czartoryski family, accompanied the Count Witold Czartoryski during his trip to the Balkans and the Near East. Kapliński also edited the periodical Ephémérides Polonaises. He was married to Helena Michalina Hryniewiecka. In 1871 he moved back to Poland, living mostly in Kraków, and died in 1873 in Milosław. He befriended several well-known Polish artists and writers, including Henryk Rodakowski, Jan Matejka, and Cyprian Kamil Norwid. Kapliński studied art in Poland and later in Paris. His first known works are copies of paintings by famous Italian artists; later he became known and appreciated for his patriotic historical paintings as Wernyhora (1855). His best works are portraits: of his mother Julia (1860), the writer Bohdan Zaleski (1857), Count Adam Jerzy Czartoryski (about 1860), and an autoportrait as a Templar (about 1872). Many of his paintings and other works have perished or been lost. Mainly influenced by classical Italian art and his contemporary Rodakowski, L.K. continued the tradition of academic painting and had no interest for the emerging modernist tendencies of the mid-nineteenth century. He won some recognition in France, participating in the Paris art salons. L.K. wrote some poems and a short novel Nad Wisłą (On Wisla). ==Selected paintings== File:Stefan Czarniecki 111.PNGStefan Czarniecki File:Sword-bearer and Wacław.PNGWacław and his Sword-Bearer; illustration from Maria by Antoni Malczewski File:Kap portret.jpgPolitical activist, Jan Kanty Działyński (1829-1880) File:JKChodkiewicz.JPGJan Karol Chodkiewicz ==ReferencesFurther reading== * == External links == Category:1824 births Category:1873 deaths Category:19th-century Polish painters Category:19th-century male artists Category:Polish activists Category:Polish painters of Jewish descent Category:Polish male painters ","title":"Leon Kapliński"},{"id":"6209926","text":"Ivan Vedar (), born Danail Nikolov, a.k.a. Yani Ingiliz, Johny English, Ovanes Efendi (equivalents of the name Ivan), Denkooglu (after Deniu, Danail), was born in Razgrad, present-day Bulgaria in 1827. He is often referred to as the founder of freemasonry in Bulgaria. He was proficient in many Indo-European languages, Latin, and various Arabic dialects. == Biography == During Danail's early years, his father, the architect Karastoyan, was requested to build a house for a local Turk, an important person. (Bulgaria was under Ottoman rule then.) The requester refused to pay, a row flared up with knives taken out, and, in order to save his father, Danail killed the Turk. What followed was a change of his name and life under cover. He studied in a college in Malta, where he picked up many languages, he worked as a sailor on an English ship, travelling between London and Melbourne, he was an interpreter in Turkish institutions in Tsarigrad, he taught languages in İzmir to the sons of Turkish notables (including Midhat Pasha). During the Crimean war he travelled over Black Sea harbours, possibly as a Russian spy. He continued his studies in the medical school in Bucharest, where he got his pseudonym Vedriy or Vedar (meaning cheerful) from the professors Dr Peter Protić and Dr Georgi Atanasović, because of his easy-going temper. In 1863 in the Tsarigrad branch of Oriental Lodge he was initiated into masonry. He managed to reach the 33rd degree, the last one, according to the Old and Accepted Scottish Rite. An even more colourful lifestyle followed — he worked on the first Bulgarian railway Rousse–Varna, then as a trade representative in Manchester, he married the daughter of a respected architect from Rousse, he taught at Robert College, he was a correspondent for different European newspapers. Midhat Pasha appointed him a \\"secretary of the external correspondence\\", which lets him frequently keep in touch with foreign diplomats. He provided financial aid to some uprisings and the revolutionary movement in Rousse, among whose members he had already established friendly relations. He interceded for Zahari Stoyanov to become a librarian in the Zora cultural club. His lobbying lifted off the decision of Delaver Pasha to massacre a great part of the population in Rousse in 1877. After the Liberation of Bulgaria, Ivan Vedar installed the first Bulgarian regular masonic lodge Balkan Star () in Rousse in 1880, among whose members are Nikola Obretenov, Zahari Stoyanov, Ilarion Dragostinov, Toma Kardzhiev, and which was visited incognito by the king-to-be Alexander Batenberg. Later, new lodges were founded in Varna (where the first Great lodge was located for a short time), Sofia, and some other cities, but in 1887 Vedar was forced to \\"put asleep\\" all lodges, because of the danger that their activity gets spoiled by political and interpersonal struggles, so common in the young and inexperienced country. In the end of his life, he assigned all of his property to the state, saying he had given enough to his children — education and upbringing. The bones of Ivan Vedar were moved to the Pantheon of National Revival Heroes, and a monument in his honour was put nearby. Modern masonic organisations in Bulgaria issue a medal with his name. == The event in Rousse in 1877 == Ivan Vedar's monument In the end of August, Russian forces fiercely attacked the Turkish quarter in Rousse, which the almost completely razed to the ground. That enraged the Turkish governors and they decided to massacre the whole Bulgarian population in Rousse — all of them were taken out in the field near the Vladikova bahcha (the present Youth's Park), where they spent several days and nights. Vedar managed to slip out of his surrounded house though paying a bag of gold. He dropped in at the Italian counsul Enrique de Gubernatis, together with whom they invited the influential Turk hajji Mehmed Alia to ascend with them to the Leventa hill, in order to lobby with Delaver Pasha, the commander of the Egyptian forces positioned around the city. When they came in at the pasha's, the three of them made the masonic sign with a hand. Realizing that he was talking to a higher-ranking brother, he promised Ivan brotherly cooperation. When the delegation came down from Leventa, they found the population surrounded by the regular Egyptian army, which guarded them from the Cherkez and bashi-bazouk soldiers. The result was an exodus from a secure death for 4000 Rousse citizens and of setting the city ablaze. == References == Category:1827 births Category:1898 deaths Category:People from Razgrad Category:Bulgarian Freemasons ","title":"Ivan Vedar"},{"id":"6209942","text":"A libertine is one free from the restraint of social norms and religious morals.

Crean was born in London to parents Surgeon-Major Thomas Crean VC and Victoria Heredia. Crean, who had a background in competitive fencing, began choreographing fights in 1932 when he was working in England as an actor in The Legends of Don Juan. He and his partner Rex Rickman were frequently hired to stage fight scenes for theatrical productions as well as in films such as The Master of Ballantrae (1953) and Sword of Sherwood Forest (1960). They both ran the Sophy School of Fencing in London and used it to teach many celebrities sword work for stage and films. He worked with actors including Paul Scofield, Laurence Olivier, Trevor Howard, Alec Guinness, Douglas Fairbanks Jr. and Errol Flynn, often performing as Flynn's stunt double in films. Crean travelled to the Canadian Stratford Theatre Festival in 1962 to serve as the fight arranger for Macbeth, directed by Peter Coe. After his second season in 1963, he decided to make Stratford, Ontario his home and worked as the festival's fight director until 1983. Among festival productions for which he arranged the swordplay, The Three Musketeers, directed by John Hirsch in 1968, received great acclaim for its stage action. Crean returned from retirement in 1988 to assist fight director Jean-Pierre Fournier for The Three Musketeers as directed by Richard Ouzounian. Crean's choreographic philosophy included tenets such as matching the combat to the character and included research into various historical and cultural forms of swordplay. His system of stage combat safety protocols were highly influential around the world. Those guidelines were codified through the Society of British Fight Directors, for which Crean was a fight master. He was also a certified fight master with Fight Directors Canada as well as being an honorary member of the Society of American Fight Directors. Crean continued to work as an actor, sometimes taking small roles in shows for which he had done fight arranging and also performing his one-man show about Rudyard Kipling, The Sun Never Sets, at Stratford's Avon Theatre in 1970. His autobiography, More Champagne, Darling (), was published in Toronto by McGraw- Hill Ryerson in 1981. The annual Paddy Crean International Stage Combat Conferences, named in honour of Mr. Crean, present a wide range of seminars run by prominent stage combat and martial arts instructors.

The fact that chlorotoxin binds preferentially to glioma cells has allowed the development of methods for the treatment and diagnosis of several types of cancer. == Sources == Chlorotoxin can be purified from crude leiurus, which belongs to the scorpion toxin protein superfamily. == Chemistry == Chlorotoxin is a small toxin and at pH 7 is highly positively charged. It is a peptide consisting of 36 amino acids, with 8 cysteines forming 4 disulfide bonds. Chlorotoxin has a considerable sequence homology to the class of small insectotoxins. == Target == Chlorotoxin is the first reported high-affinity peptide ligand for Cl− channels and it blocks small conductance chloride channels. Each chloride channel can be closed by only one ligand molecule. Using a recombinant chlorotoxin it was demonstrated that chlorotoxin specifically and selectively interacts with MMP-2 isoforms which are specifically upregulated in gliomas and related cancers, but are not normally expressed in brain. == Toxicity == Chlorotoxin immobilizes the envenomated prey. Duration of paralysis depends on the amount of chlorotoxin injected. In crayfish, chlorotoxin at 1.23-2.23 µg/g body wt produced a loss of motor control beginning about 20 seconds after injection which progressed to a rigid paralysis of the walking and pincer legs that was complete about forty seconds later. Within ±90 s of injection the tail musculature was immobilized. No recovery was noted for 6 hours, at which time the crayfish were destroyed. At 0.5 µg/g, chlorotoxin induced the same progressive paralysis with a slower onset. Recovery of crayfish was noted after 2 hours. The injection on insects produced similar results to those observed in crayfish. == Possible therapeutic use == The fact that chlorotoxin binds preferentially to glioma cells compared with non-neoplastic cells or normal brain has allowed the development of new methods for the treatment and diagnosis of several types of cancer. CLTX has the ability to interact with chloride channels in membrane protein in glioma cells, so this prevents transmembrane chloride fluxes but this interaction does not happen for the neurons and normal glial cells. This suggests a potential treatment for cancer. A report showed the anti-invasive effect of chlorotoxin on glioma cells mediated by its interaction with MMP-2, which allows the penetration of normal and tumor cells through tissue barriers. Chlorotoxin exerts a dual effect on MMP-2: it inhibits the enzymatic activity of MMP-2 and causes a reduction in the surface expression of MMP-2. This result implies the use of chlorotoxin as a highly effective drug of therapeutic potential for diseases that involve the activity of MMP-2. TM-601 which is the synthetic version of chlorotoxin is under phase II clinical trial. Iodine-131-TM-601 is used to treat malignant glioma. TM-601 is also a candidate for targeting gliomas because it crosses blood-brain and tissue barriers and binds to malignant brain tumor cells without affecting healthy tissue. Phase II trials are being conducted on the use of Chlorotoxin for imaging and radio therapy in Glioma. CTX: Cy5.5 bioconjugate which is a combination of chlorotoxin and a fluorescent material named, Cy5.5 was used by Researchers at Seattle Children’s Hospital Research Institute and Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center to demarcate cancer cells from the surrounding normal cells. This gives surgeons a better chance of removing all of the cancerous cells without injuring the surrounding healthy tissue. CTX: Cy5.5 is a fluorescent molecule emitting photons in the near infrared spectrum and hence can be visualized in the operating room with the aid of infrared glasses. Studies in mouse models have shown that Cy5.5 can identify tumors with as few as 2000 cancer cells, making it 500 times more sensitive than MRI.

It has about 3,800 inhabitants. It is located in the Bohemian Forest, close to the border with Germany. ==Geography== Volary is located southeast of Bobík (Schreiner, 1264 m above sea level), which is separated from the south by a ridge from the Vltavická brázda (Vltava furrow). The town is crossed by the Volarský creek. Six kilometers south of Volary the Hot Vltava and Cold Vltava unite in the Mrtvý Moor to form the Vltava River. To the north of Volary lies the Small Stone Mountain (874 m nm) and the U Myslivem rise (891 m), in the northeast of Vysoký Les (942 m), the Zlatá stezka (Golden Path, 920 m), the Ořechovka (919 m) and the Kamenac (899 m) east of Větrný (Lichtenberg, 1051 m) southeast of the Na Skále (1011 m), the Doupná mountain (Schusterberg, 1052 m), the Křemenná (stone layer 1085 m) and the Mechový vrch (Maystadt, 1012 m), in the southwest lies Lískovec (Sipplberg, 834 m) west the Smolna hora (883 m) and in the northwest Dvorský vrch (Brix, 914 m nm ), the Jedlová (Stoeger Mountain, 1088 m above sea level), the High Mark and Bobík. ==History== Volary is located within the southern part of the Bohemian Forest. According to archaeological findings, the Šumava area was not significantly populated during the Paleolithic era – the Stone Age (dates back to 9000 BC). The initial settlements of a more permanent character appeared in the southwest of Bohemia during the Bronze Age (3,000 to 1,000 years BC). In the 1st century AD, the forest was inhabited by Gallo-Romans as well as by Germanic tribes in its northern part.http://dbrockway.weebly.com The Celts were however gradually forced out by the Germanic tribe (the Marcomanni), who left the Celtic agricultural settlements desolated. With the departure of the Marcomanni, the forests were left to evolve with almost no human influence. The Šumava forests began to change character only with the arrival of the Slavs in the 6th century, who found a refuge in the middle of the impenetrable forests. The cultural landscape began to penetrate the wooded surroundings. The gradual but disorganized and fairly subtle form of colonisation of the region of Bohemia surrounding Volary continued until the late 11th century when the first mass and more or less organized colonisation of Šumava began, under the rule of Ottokar I of Bohemia. Since then the nature in Šumava, including the forested landscape developed under the strong influence of human activity. The borderline virgin forests receded, making way for fields and pastures, and thus in the 13th century, the colonisation of the Bohemian borderland began.http://dbrockway.weebly.com Volary was first documented in 1359 in connection with the Prachatice Councillor Andreas de Wallerii. At the beginning of the 15th century Volary had grown into the most important part of the Passau salt trade, forming a stage in the Bohemian part of the \\"Golden Trail\\" or \\"Golden Path\\".:cs:Zlatá stezka Volary became a market place in that time for traders and travellers on the route. The Prachatická Golden Trail that passes through Volary is one of the oldest salt routes in Bohemia (some documents state that the Golden Trail was probably used in prehistoric times; the first written records of this important business channel originate from the 11th century). The Prachatická Golden Trail leads to Old Prachatice (about 70 km in a straight line) from its origin in the south of Passau, Bavaria.:cs:Zlatá stezka From the 13th century AD until 1945–1946, much of the region around Volary was cohabited with ethnic German Bohemians, many of whom migrated to the region as woodcutters. Until the Hussite wars Volary was among the possessions of the Vyšehrad Dynasty and then it fell to the royal chamber. Later, traffic was severely affected in the Golden Path through wandering mercenary gangs. in 1437 King Sigismund mortgaged the Volary dominion to Jan Smil of Krems. Jan Smil clashed with Ulrich von Rosenberg in numerous feuds and was taken prisoner in 1439 to the Krumlov castle. Then Raubritter Habart Lopata of Hrádek seized Volary and used it as a hideout for his raids on by traveling salesmen on the Gold Trail; in 1441 Volary was captured and razed. In 1444 Ulrich von Rosenberg took possession by means of a forged document the reign Volary, which he in 1457 the brothers Prokop and Johann von Rabenstein left. From 1503 Volary was again under the control of the Lords of Rosenberg, under which Volary received the right to free extraction of timber and firewood, and the farming of cattle in the stately forests up to a distance of four hours. In 1506 Peter von Rosenberg granted privileges of exclusive territories between Prachatice and the Bavarian border and Volary was first mentioned as a market town. During its heyday of the Passau salt trade of the 16th century in Volary there were 13 Pubs and four forges for mule trains. At that time also took place the construction of the typical local alpine houses. In 1591 Sigmund Stoeger of Wilhelm von Rosenberg granted the privilege of operating a Spiegelhütte in Volary. Peter Wok von Rosenberg extended the Volary privileges in 1596 for the right to seize horses and charge foreign Säumer that differed to the detriment of the market from the Golden Path and elsewhere their goods sold, where the confiscated property in half fell to the Volary market and the authorities. The beginning of the 17th century belonged to the reign of Catherine of Gutenstein and then fell back to the Court Chamber. King Rudolf II. Confirmed in 1608 the market town all privileges except for the confiscation law for Ross and charge. Ferdinand II gave the dominion of Volary on 23 December 1622 to Hans Ulrich von Eggenberg. The Thirty Years' War led to the decline of the salt trade on the Gold Route, instead it served the imperial army as a supply route. After the war trading on the Golden Path never returned to its previous level due to high protective tariffs on Bavarian and Passau salt and increased imports of Austrian salt from Gmunden. In 1679 a major fire destroyed 45 houses. In 1693 the brothers Johann, Georg and Kaspar Stegbauer in Volary donated a hospital for four Pfründler. During the Spanish War of Succession Joseph I. finally banned the import of Bavaria and Passau salt to Bohemia and picked up the salt in Prachatice law. After the princes of Eggenberg in 1717 became extinct in the male line, the rule of the Prince fell to the Schwarzenberg, in whose possession it remained until 1848. In the 18th century, following the abolition of the salt trade, the Golden Path sank into insignificance; this also led to the demise of Volary. Major fires occurred in the years 1715, 1719 and 1754. In 1754 the Church of St. Catherine was burned down after a lightning strike, according to its reconstruction, the church was consecrated in 1756. The market was led by a regulated magistrate. In 1807, the mirror glass factory was shut down. Since the use and grazing rights in the state forests ended, in the 18th century forestry operations led to increasing irrigation, leading to its closure by Joseph II. The use only for packhorses on the old Golden Path was dropped in the 19th century as a transport route to Bavaria and the mule track's regional importance further decreased, replaced by roads to Prachatice or upper Vltava. 1833 built-born Wallern owner of the domain Liboch, Jakob Veith another Gestift of 2000 guilders, which served the better subsistence of the magistrate. In 1838 the intervening villages of Vimperk dismembered into three parts including Volary. In the villages north of Prachatice Czech was the spoken language, German was spoken in the south. To rule the protection and Municipality of Prachatice, the market of Volary and the villages were sealed Biel (Běleč) Danetschlag (Rohanov), Lhota (Bělečská Lhota), Tieschowitz, Weyrow (Výrov) and Zdenitz (Zdeníce). The official seat of government was located in Prachatice. St Catherine's church in Volary In the late 19th century the market town of Volary consisted of 224 houses with 2069 German speaking inhabitants. Under the patronage of the authorities, the parish church of St Catherine and the school were built and maintained. There was also in a public chapel of St. Florian and a town hall. The main sources of income were agriculture, cattle breeding and cattle fattening, linen weaving and the production of yarns. Every year Volary sold about 400 steers to Prague. The deposited borough was surrounded by agriculturally used meadows with numerous wooden houses, hay barns and traditional alpine architecture which gave the area along with the special construction of the houses an alpine character. The mostly wooden houses of Volary were built on flat land, close to each other, combined with large stones, gabled roofs and gabled fronts. At this time residents called \\"Wallinger\\" or \\"Wallerer\\" kept their old customs and traditions against outside influences. During the 1800s to early 1900s there were up to 73 business establishments. In Volary two annual fairs were held, but their meaning was only slight. For market Volary were the Magdalene yards (Svatá Magdaléna, seven houses and a chapel for St. Magdalena), Spanolahof (Spanolerův Dvůr) and fence mill (four houses), Gemeindmühle (mlýn Obecní, two houses), Austen mill Schoberhof, Sippelhöfe (Sipplovy Dvory, four houses), Prix yards (Brixovy Dvory, five houses), Stoeger huts (Stögrova Huť, nine houses with Brettsäge) Grünhof (Zelené Dvory, two houses), Ratschinhof, Jägerhaus (Myslivny, two houses) and Nuskohof. Volary was vicarage for Neuhäuser (Nové Chalupy) and upper snow village. After the abolition of patrimonial Volary (1849) along with the districts Stoeger hut and St. Magdalena it formed a town in the judicial district Prachatice. On July 22, 1863, a major fire destroyed 59 houses, the church and the school; the next day Volary was hit by a storm, in which the long-Wiesenbach burst its banks. During the reconstruction after the fire of 1863, the typical Volary houses were not built entirely of wood, but partly with walls of stone and brick. Overall between 1856–1882 in the town there were eight major fires mostly consisting of wooden houses. In 1865 a post office was opened in Volary, and in 1869 there was a telegraph office. From 1868, the municipality belonged to the district Prachatice. Various records have indicated a heavy storms dating back to the 1700s and particularly of October 27, 1870 which left the Volary forests (as in the entire Bohemian Forest), damaged due strong wind breakage. Historically, the Bohemian Forest around Volary has suffered impacts of deforestation and monoculture planting of forests, bark beetle infestations, salvage logging, and windstorms. On April 30, 1871 Volary was raised by Emperor Franz Joseph I to the status of town and received a coat of arms; at that time 2712 people lived in the town. In 1873 a state vocational school for woodworking was opened. On November 3, 1874, Judicial District Volary was formed and brought the town to the seat of a district court. In 1879 a brewery was built, as well as numerous wood processing companies and sawmills and a bicycle chain factory were in the second half of the 19th century in the town founded. The State College for woodworking moved in 1894 a newly constructed school building. 1899 Volary received a rail connection in the course of the extension of the railway line Číčenice-Prachatice. In the same year the railway Lenora-Volary went into operation, the section between Lenora and Vimperk was inaugurated in 1900. Ten years later, the rail link was extended to the Bavarian Haidmühle. In the Census of 1910, the town had 3,573 residents. Until the founding of Czechoslovakia, the town was part of Austria- Hungary. During the First Republic an increasing influx of Czechs took place. In 1923 Volary was connected to the electricity grid. 1924 was a new dairy in operation. In 1930 the town had 3,905 inhabitants. In pre-World War II there was a Czech school and a Czech kindergarten as well as several Czech clubs. In 1939, there were 4,099 people in Volary. During World War II the owner of Metallwarenfabrik Knäbel and Co. OHG, Oskar Knäbel, took over (in 1941) the management of the former paper mill Franzensthal in the valley of the Warm Vltava under the code name \\"Möbelwerke Franzensthal AG\\" and built an underground production plant of the Messerschmitt AG.:de:Volary ===Volary Death March=== The \\"Volary Death March\\" involved more than 1,300 Jewish women over the course of over 550 miles and 106 days and nights. On January 20, 1945, around 1,000 female Jewish prisoners were evacuated from a camp at Schlesiersee in Western Poland. The women and girls had been sent there from Auschwitz-Birkenau a few months earlier, in order to dig anti-tank trenches to slow the Red Army’s advance. More than a thousand others had to march southwest toward Germany. As they passed more camps, such the one at Grünberg, more women had to join the death march. Survivors attest that girls were forced to march \\"without hair, wearing wooden shoes without socks, wrapped in rags.”http://www.jspacenews.com/death-march-volary-goal-everyone-die-along- way/ After the addition of about 300 inmates from Grünberg, on January 29, 1945 approximately 1,350 women set off for a 106-day-long march. For trying to escape or simply stumbling they could be, and were, murdered at any time in the course of those three months. Any prisoners who could no longer walk, the SS guards leading the march killed. If someone escaped, they made a row and shot every other one. They would never eat more than once a day. The women marched without shoes, with just wooden clogs. There were bitter winter winds and heavy snow.http://www.jspacenews.com/death-march-volary-goal-everyone-die- along-way/ The penalty for attempting to escape was death by execution or the butt of a rifle. By March 6, 1945, the 1,350 women had been reduced to 621. The remaining prisoners arrived at the Helmbrechts camp in Germany. They were forced into a hut with just two buckets for waste between them. When the hut became dirty, they were whipped. The women received almost no food, and no medical treatment. When one young woman, Frania Reifer, was found with photos of her murdered family, she was forced to spend the whole day standing barefoot in the freezing snow.http://www.jspacenews.com/death-march-volary- goal-everyone-die-along-way/ May 11, 1945: German civilians are forced to walk past the bodies of 30 Jewish women starved to death by German SS troops in a march across Czechoslovakia from Helmbrechts concentration camp. Buried in shallow graves in Volary, Czechoslovakia, the bodies were exhumed by German civilians working under the direction of Medics of the 5th Infantry Division, US Third Army. The bodies were later placed in coffins and reburied in the cemetery in Volary. But hellish as Helmbrechts was, it was merely the halfway point. The women were forced onwards, until those who were still standing made it to Volary in Czechoslovakia on May 5, 1945. There, American forces liberated the women. Of the 1,350 forced on the death march, only 118 were still living. Those who were alive were in terrible condition; although the Americans took them to an improvised hospital, twenty-six died within days. The women were in dire condition, suffering from malnutrition, dysentery, frostbite, injuries to their feet, and riddled with lice. Yet some survived. 17 victims of the death march were buried in a mass grave near Volary, another eight women died in a nearby military hospital.http://www.jspacenews.com/death-march-volary-goal-everyone-die-along- way/ Many other victims of the death march were exhumed at Mlýn in Kvilda, Polka, Cudrovice, Můstek and Blanický; 95 predominantly Jewish women were buried in a separate cemetery next to the cemetery of Volary. ===Post-war events=== Following the end of World War II, the town was returned to Czechoslovakia. As of March 1946, the German population were expelled due to the Beneš decrees. In 1961 Chlum (with Dolni Sněžná, Horní Sněžná, Nové Chalupy and shares of Jodlovy Chalupy) and Mlynářovice were incorporated into Volary (with Cudrovice, Milešice and Plešivec). As of October 1, 1951 a Border control unit of the Czechoslovak army was stationed in Volary, which was dissolved after the fall of the Iron Curtain. Since 1995, the town carries a banner showing a silver angle or a lying V in the green field. Part of the historic center was declared in 1995 to protect the Volary wooden houses conservation area. ==Transport== Through Volary the state road I / 39 leads between Vimperk and Horni Planá, which branches off to Prachatice from the center in the road II / 141. The town lies on the railway lines Číčenice- Haidmühle and Strakonice-Volary. ==Twin towns – sister cities== Volary is twinned with: * Grainet, Germany * Waldkirchen, Germany * Wallern an der Trattnach, Austria ==References * Official website *The death march to Volary, at Yad Vashem website Category:Cities and towns in the Czech Republic Category:Populated places in Prachatice District Category:Prácheňsko Category:Bohemian Forest ","title":"Volary"},{"id":"6209978","text":"Wallern may refer to the following places: * Wallern im Burgenland, in Burgenland, Austria * Wallern an der Trattnach, in Upper Austria, Austria * the German name for Volary, Czech Republic * SV Wallern, Austrian football club ","title":"Wallern"},{"id":"6209997","text":"Mark's Keyboard Repair is the debut studio album by American musician Money Mark, originally released on the Mo' Wax label in 1995.

It is found off the coastline of southeastern Australia and northern New Zealand, generally inhabiting near-shore rock and coral reefs at depths down to 50 metres. Its main range comprises the southeast coastline of Australia, in the state of New South Wales; New Zealand populations are suspected to be nonbreeding, so are a result of drifting larvae. However, spawning aggregations have been recorded off northern New Zealand. This grouper grows to 200 cm in length and at least 68 kg in weight. The species is a generalised carnivore, preying on crustaceans and fish. It has a typical grouper appearance. Colouration varies from a dark grey-black colour to the more usual blotched or banded black and white pattern. The species is a protogynous hermaphrodite, with individuals starting as females and changing to males at an estimated 100–110 cm in length and 29–30 years of age. Drastic but localised declines in saddletail grouper stocks due to line fishing were first noted around heavily populated areas in the early 1900s. However, in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, E. daemelii populations suffered a severe decline due to the rise in popularity of spear fishing. Due to the species' large size, slowness, curiosity, territorial habits, and use of inshore habitats, it was extremely vulnerable to spear fishing. The species was heavily targeted by spear fishermen and caught in large quantities. After more than two decades of severe spear fishing-driven decline, the New South Wales fishery department belatedly banned the spearing or taking of black cod in 1983, and subsequently listed the species as vulnerable under New South Wales fisheries legislation. The Australian Government listed it as vulnerable under national environmental legislation in 2012. ==References== * Günther A (1876). ‘Serranus Daemelii’.

In the summer of 1941 renovations began and the owner Hank Sophie converted it into a bowling alley, cashing-in on the bowling craze that began in mid-20th century America. It started as a twelve lane pin boy bowling alley and thrived throughout the 40s and 50s. In 1956 it was expanded and AMF automatic pinspotters were installed and the remodeled Fireside was expanded by four lanes bringing the total to 16. ==Ownership== The Fireside Bowl was owned and operated by Hank Sophie until 1966 when Rich Lapinski and Alec \\"Mac\\" McGuire bought the bowling alley from an ailing Hank Sophie. Lapinski and McGuire operated it together until 1971 when Lapinski bought out McGuire. From 1971 until 1990 Lapinski operated it as a thriving bowling alley. As the neighborhood changed and Fireside fell into disrepair Lapinski handed the establishment to his son Jim. The neighborhood was getting rough and business slowed so Fireside began to showcase live music on a part-time basis in 1994. ==Music venue== While the bowling lanes were used less and less, music was filling in on more nights. There was still bowling on a few nights, in particular the Bucktown Bowling League made up of several neighborhood establishments took to the lanes every Monday night as they had been doing for many years. However, music was now the primary focus. Gradually, more and more shows were held there until 1999 when the City of Chicago wanted to expand the nearby Haas Park. For the next several years the cloud of eminent domain hung over Fireside, but it continued to host shows promoted by Brian Peterson and Dave Eaves. As time went on and the neighborhood changed neighbors became increasingly more vocal about the live music acts. Then in 2003 the City of Chicago dropped the eminent domain suit and it was decided by the owners and family, with talks to the alderman concerning it continued status that if Fireside was to continue over the long term it needed to get back to its roots of bowling. ==Back to bowling== In the Summer of 2004 renovations were made to update things such as automatic scoring, new lanes and equipment and upgrades to the building and its amenities. It restated as a bowling alley without ever closing in the fall of 2004. Since then Fireside has retaken its status as Logan Square's neighborhood bowling alley. In 2010 the Fireside Bowl started hosting live music again. ==Popular culture== Several external scenes from the 1992 film Rapid Fire, featuring Brandon Lee and Powers Boothe prominently show the Fireside. In the film it was used as the headquarters of Boothe's character Det. Mace Ryan and his team. In 2000, The Fireside earned a mention in the song \\"Goodbye Forever\\" by Chicago-based band, the Alkaline Trio. The song appears on the Alkaline Trio's self-titled album, and includes the line \\"Remember last April when we saw U.S. Maple? / Somehow the singer showed Fireside exactly how I feel.\\" The bowling scenes from the 2006 film The Break- Up, featuring Vince Vaughn and Jennifer Aniston, were filmed at the Fireside. Fireside can be seen in an episode of Fox TV show The Chicago Code entitled \\"Hog Butcher\\", which aired on Feb 14, 2011. Fireside plays host to a scene in NBC's Chicago Fire in the episode entitled \\"Headlong Toward Disaster\\", which aired on February 15, 2015. The Fireside Bowl is the topic of the Allister song \\"Somewhere on Fullerton\\" and is also mentioned in a song by The Methadones called \\"Suddenly Cool\\". Both are Chicago based bands. Fireside is featured in several scenes of the 2018 film Widows. ==References *The original bookers of the club * Fireside Bowl official website * Fireside Bowl's profile on Citysearch *Information on Fireside at metromix.com *Archives of The Chicago Shows List, a weekly listing of Chicago music happenings * Fireside Bowl returns to Logan Square on WBEZ Category:Music venues in Chicago Category:Bowling alleys ","title":"The Fireside Bowl"},{"id":"6210106","text":"The Technical University metro station () is situated intermediate on Saburtalo Line in Tbilisi, Georgia.

In the 1980s, a terminal emulator was a piece of software necessary to log into mainframes and thus access e-mail. Prior to the rise of the Internet, computer files were exchanged over dialup lines, requiring ways to send binary files over communication systems that were primarily intended for plain text; programs implementing special transfer modes were implemented using various de facto standards, most notably Kermit. == Chat == In 1985 the first decentralized chat system was created called Bitnet Relay, whereas Minitel probably provided the largest chat system at the same time. In August 1988 the Internet Relay Chat followed. CU-SeeMe was the first chat system to be equipped with a video camera. Instant messaging featuring a buddy list and the notion of online presence was introduced by ICQ in 1996. In the days of the Internet boom, web chats were very popular, too. Chatting is a real-time conversation or message exchange that takes place in public or in private groupings called chat rooms. Some chatrooms have moderators who will trace and block offensive comments and other kinds of abuse.

He is known as a reporter, writer, and political analyst. Through his writing in various newspapers, Adinegoro has made a great contribution in developing journalism and the Indonesian language. His name was immortalized as a journalism award in Indonesia: the Adinegoro Award.Indonesians in Focus: Iwan Gayo – Daily – Daily, Indonesian News Indonesians in Focus. Planet Mole (2006-03-23).

Retrieved on 2014-08-24. ==Early life== Djamaluddin was born on August 14, 1904, in Talawi, Sawahlunto, West Sumatra. His father Tuanku Oesman Gelar Bagindo Khatib was a \\"penghulu andiko\\" or \\"regent\\" of Indrapura. Coming from a ruling family, Djamaluddin had the privilege to be educated in Dutch schools. After graduating from the Europeesche Lagere School (ELS), Djamaluddin and his brother Muhammad Yamin continued their study in Hollands Indische School (HIS) in Palembang. Then he moved to Batavia to study in the medical school: School tot Opleiding van Inlandsche Artsen (STOVIA). After studying he spent his spare time to read and write many articles for the Tjahaja Hindia magazine. As suggested by Landjumin Datuk Tumenggung, who runs the magazine, Djamaluddin used Adinegoro as his pseudonym in his writings. Because of his great interest in becoming a reporter, Adinegoro left STOVIA and traveled to Europe to study journalism. ==Career== During his stay in Utrecht, The Netherlands, Adinegoro had the opportunity to work as a voluntary assistant for several newspapers. After that he moved to Berlin, Munich, and Warzburg to study journalism, geography, cartography, and philosophy. From Germany, Adinegoro visited the Balkan countries, Southeast Europe, Turkey, Greece, Italy, Egypt, Abyssinia and India that gave him ideas to write. Adinegoro’s travel journal first appeared in Pandji Pustaka magazine and was published as a book, A Journey to the West. At that time his inspired writing has gained attention from the youths in the Dutch East Indies. His writing was readable, filled with knowledge, popular and easy to understand by readers who didn’t have high education. In mid-1931 Adinegoro returned to Indonesia. He worked in Balai Pustaka Jakarta and received an assignment to lead Pandji Pustaka magazine as well as a writer in Bintang Timoer. Not long afterwards Adinegoro accepted an offer to lead a newspaper Pewarta Deli in Medan. Under Adinegoro’s leadership, Pewarta Deli had many improvement and changes, not only in terms of layout and news reporting, but also in the choice of articles. The attention of all Pewarta Deli’s readers was aimed at the brilliance of Adinegoro’s writings. Uniquely, his articles about the war in Abyssinia and the civil war in Spain were attached on a map that showed the location of the war, making it easier for readers to understand the reports. During that time attaching pictures or maps in a local media was uncommon. On August 25, 1932 Adinegoro married Alidar binti Djamal, a woman from Sulit Air, Solok, West Sumatera, his friend from STOVIA, with whom he had five children. Although living a life of scarcity, Adinegoro had a high commitment as a reporter and writer who produced two literary works: Darah Muda and Asmara Jaya. In Pewarta Deli editorial, Adinegoro expressed his thoughts about colonialism, the struggle for independence, nationalism and education. His writing is always sharp and elegant. Because of his brilliance in choosing words, Adinegoro always managed to escape the legal traps made by the Dutch colonial government in Persbreidel-Ordonantie. The colonial government was always suspicious due to his activities in the nationalist movements. During the Japanese occupation, Adinegoro led the Sumatera Shimbun daily. After being assigned as a General Department Chief of Sumatera Chūō Sangi Kai, Adinegoro moved to Bukittinggi. After the proclamation of independence, Adinegoro was assigned as head of Sumatera National Committee. He encouraged the people of Sumatera to carry out the President’s command: to take over the government from the Japanese and declare Proclamation of Independence along with the local leaders. Besides running the Kedaoelatan Rakjat newspaper, Adinegoro also established Antara newswire service Sumatra branch. In 1947 Adinegoro’s health was declining, and he moved to Jakarta. After regaining his health, he started to write again for Waspada daily in Medan. Adinegoro’s spirit was raised again when he and his press colleagues set up a weekly, Mimbar Indonesia. In this well-known magazine he wrote about foreign affairs politics, which became his expertise. Due to his wide-ranging knowledge, Adinegoro’s writings always attracted people’s attention. For example, his writing and report on the Roundtable Conference was very amazing, smart, and informative. He was able to see problems clearly and provided criticisms and arguments in a very smooth manner. In a short time Mimbar Indonesia became recognized among the Indonesia press. Since October 1951, Adinegoro led the Indonesian Press Bureau Foundation (Yayasan Pers Biro Indonesia Aneta/PIA) which liquidated the colonial press bureau. PIA has published Indonesian, Dutch, English bulletins, as well as bulletins for finance and economy, and also news in English. Once after the PIA became a part of Antara Newswire Agency, Adinegoro became Antara’s Bureau Head of Education, Research and Documentation. Adinegoro on a 1966 stamp Among the press society, Adinegoro was known as a teacher who was very concerned about the youths. Adinegoro was one of the founders of Sekolah Tinggi Publisistik in Jakarta and Faculty of Publicity (now known as Faculty of Communication) at Padjadjaran University, Bandung. Adinegoro's concern about the freedom of the press when political animosity increased affected his health. Several times his health was declining and Adinegoro had to be hospitalized in Carolus Hospital, Jakarta. On January 8, 1967 the Indonesian journalist died. He now rests in Karet Bivak Public Cemetery in Central Jakarta. ==Bibliography Books === * Revolusi dan Kebudayaan (1954) * Ensiklopedia Umum dalam Bahasa Indonesia (1954), * Ilmu Karang-mengarang * Falsafah Ratu Dunia === Novel === * Darah Muda.

Founded by Canon James K. O'Neill in Belfast, Ireland, in 1915, it was named in honour of the Irish saint, Columbanus. Initially established as a mutual benefit society for working class Catholics, it has developed into a fraternal benefit society dedicated to providing charitable services to all areas of the Irish community. There are 68 councils across all 32 counties on the island of Ireland. Membership in the order is open to all practicing Catholic men and their families aged 18 and over. There is a youth division of the order open to younger men ages 16 and up, called the Associate Knights of St Columbanus. The Order is a founding member of the International Alliance of Catholic Knights. The Pope John Paul II Awards are a Knights of St Columbanus project which they financially support throughout Ireland. The Award was established in 2006 in the Diocese of Derry and recognises and encourages active involvement of those 16-18 years old in the life of their parish and community. == History  Formation === Canon James Kearney O'Neill, founder of the Knights of St Columbanus. Fr. James Kearney O'Neill, of Ballycastle, Co. Antrim, founded the Order of the Knights of St Columbanus in 1915 \\"to cherish fraternal charity and to develop practical Catholicity among its members, to promote and foster the cause of the Catholic faith and Catholic education\\".Rogers, F. (2012). Canon James Kearney O'Neill (1857-1922): Founder of the Knights of St Columbanus. 1st ed. Belfast. O'Neill was influenced heavily by social teachings of the Church, in particular the encyclical Rerum Novarum.Knights of St Columbanus, (2017). History of the Order. Knightsofstcolumbanus.ie. Available at: http://www.knightsofstcolumbanus.ie/history/history-of-the-order/ (Accessed 23 February 2017) This key encyclical, issued by Pope Leo XIII in 1891, addressed the unjust condition of the working classes at that time and promoted membership in labour unions, while rejecting aspects of both socialism and capitalism.Rerum novarum, §3 O'Neill witnessed such injustices first-hand in his role as parish priest of Sacred Heart Parish in industrial, turn of the century Belfast. By 1920, following the Partition of Ireland, events such as the shipyard expulsions in East Belfast, where Catholic workers were forcibly removed from the yards, began a two-year spate of attacks, predominantly affecting Catholic civilians in the city. Estimates suggest that between 1920 and 1922, over 450 people lost their lives with 1,100 people injured and 650 homes and businesses destroyed. Effigies depicting Catholics being hanged from buildings were also seen during this time. These events are widely known as the 'Belfast Pogroms'. Additionally, all local government representatives were from Protestant, unionist backgrounds at this time, therefore the needs of the Catholic nationalist population could not be addressed.National Archives of Ireland, (2017). What was Belfast like in the early 20th century?. The National Archives of Ireland. Available at: http://www.census.nationalarchives.ie/exhibition/belfast/main.html (Accessed 23 February 2017) In the face of these situations, an organisation which sought to serve the Catholic population in Belfast was direly needed. Working with Bishop John Tohill, O'Neill arranged regular meetings at which the social teachings of Pope Leo XIII and Pope Pius X were discussed. This marked the beginning of the order as it is known today, by educating its members in social principles which can be applied to practical, real life situations. The order was placed under the patronage of St Columbanus for his missionary zeal in bringing the Good News to all, in addition to infamously standing up for what's right in the face of adversity, an issue faced by many of the early Knights. The motto ‘Instaurare omnia in Christo’ meaning ‘To restore all things in Christ’ comes from Pope Pius X. As a keen follower of the pontiff, O’Neill adopted the same motto to which Pius X dedicated his pontificate in his first encyclical E Supremi. In it, the dire need for Catholic action on the topics of education, respect for property, maintaining order, and justice in the social classes was expressed.Heschmeyer, J. (2014). 9 Ways to Restore All Things in Christ [online] The Catholic Gentleman. Available at: http://www.catholicgentleman.net/2014/10/9-ways-restore-things-christ/ (Accessed 23 February 2017) The Order was first announced in The Irish Catholic on 10 April 1915. An order with similar views and motives to the Knights of St Columbanus, known as the Columban Knights, was merged with the KSC. Over a year later, four new primary councils had been established in Belfast with more following in Armagh, Cork, Derry, Dublin, Lurgan, Newry and Portadown. It is thought that these councils spread throughout the country through travelling businessmen associated with the Order. Canon O'Neill died on 18 March 1922 and is buried at St Patrick's Church, Ballyvoy, Co. Antrim. The Order celebrates an annual Mass at the church in his honour. It is attended by Knights from all counties on the island of Ireland. === In Politics === Following Irish independence in 1922, the Knights became more involved in Irish politics. At one stage, they had a significant presence in the Revenue. Indeed, it is thought that former Irish President Seán T. O'Kelly was a member of the Knights of St. Columbanus, much to the displeasure of Éamon de Valera.McCormack, Blackwell Companion to Modern Irish Culture (2001) p. 524. Members also held some key positions on hospital boards in the country in the mid-20th century, alongside the mostly Protestant Freemasons.Dáil Éireann 10 June 1953 By the 1970s, the Knights had become involved in the politics of tertiary level education, associated with University College Dublin, while the Freemasons were affiliated with Trinity College, Dublin.Dáil Éireann 16 July 1969 The Knights had also been critical of the Dalkey School Project when it was first set up in 1979 as a multi-denominational school.Multi-Denominational Schools in the Republic of Ireland 1975-1995 , Professor Áine Hyland, paper given at Conference Education and Religion organised by C.R.E.L.A. at the University of Nice. 21–22 June 1996, Educate Together The Knight's involvement in these sectors has drawn criticism since the 1950s, mostly in Irish parliament, Dáil Éireann. As a result, the number of individual members of the Knights who sit on hospital, education and government boards has been far less significant since the 1990s. The Order as a whole however, maintains views on matters of politics and education. One example of this was the Order's opposition to the repeal of the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland which legally permits abortions in the country under a broader range of circumstances. The Order also maintains support for Catholic education in Ireland. == Organisation == The Order follows a tripartite structure, with Supreme, Provincial and Primary levels. There are around 70 Primary Councils across the island of Ireland, each led by a Grand Knight. These councils normally operate at a town level and overall constitute the largest portion of the Order. Each Primary Council sends delegates to make up their Provincial Council, of which there are 12 across the island and each is led by a Provincial Grand Knight. Provincial Councils in turn send delegates to the Supreme Council. The Supreme Council has two levels: the Council of Directors, responsible for the running of the Order from a national perspective and the Supreme Executive, a sub-committee of the Council of Directors, controlling and directing the 12 Provincial Councils. Each level of organisation in the Order is responsible for governing the finances, faith development, charitable enterprises and recruitment of members at each lower level. The Supreme Knight is the most senior member of the Order. He is elected for a three-year term by the Supreme Council at the Stated Annual Meeting, following elections by every Primary Council. The Stated Annual Meeting rotates around each Provincial Area year on year and is attended by representatives of every Primary Council in Ireland. Any amendments to the Constitution of the Order or other major changes occur at these meetings. Provincial Grand Knights are elected by the members of the Primary Councils in each Provincial Area for three-year terms. Primary Grand Knights too are elected by their local Primary Council for three-year terms.

Once approved, the knight-elect is initiated at a special Mass, usually with several others, attended by the Supreme or Deputy Supreme Knight. During this Mass, the knight-elect receives his robes and a penal cross, a sign of Catholic persecution in Ireland. Meetings of Primary Councils are chaired by the Grand Knight and start with an opening prayer. Generally, the council chaplain offers some faith teaching and the meeting goes on to discuss fundraising and other projects, concluding with a final prayer. Much of the work of the Knights involves assisting with church ceremonies, although the Order often raises funds for both their own charitable ventures and that of other organisations. A national project undertaken by Area 3 in 2017 involved the sourcing and subsequent tour of Ireland with a relic of Saint Teresa of Calcutta on the 20th anniversary of her death. This scheme involved Knights from all parts of the country, including the Associate Knights of St Columbanus who were responsible for promoting the tour on Facebook, YouTube and Instagram to make the tour more accessible to younger Catholics. The duties of the Knights involved ensuring that the relic was safely transported around the country and that it was always guarded when available for veneration. Another project of note is the Christmas Day Dinner which has been run by the Order since 1924. The Knights provide a hot meal on Christmas Day for the poor and homeless of Dublin City and the surrounding areas. Both projects have received significant media attention. == Associate Knights of St Columbanus == Logo of the Associate Knights of St Columbanus A recipient of an Amazon Kindle Fire Tablet is shown how to use her device. Newry, 2016The Associate Knights of St Columbanus is the youth section of the order. The scheme was Initially introduced in the mid-2000s in St Colman's College, Newry by Canon Francis Brown for 6th Form students (16–18 years). These Associate Knights followed a similar structure to that of the main Knights of St Columbanus and maintained a membership of around 30 students each year. These Associates were initiated as with the main knights and wore the same robes. In 2013, the Associate Knights were opened up to young men from outside the College. The structure of the Associates also changed so that they no longer followed that of the main Knights. Instead, they would hold their own meetings, as a sub-division of the Newry Primary Council (CK10). The Associates are no longer initiated as with the main knights, rather they participate in a very simple part of a normal Mass where they are presented with the penal cross, but no robes. This way, the Associate Knights are distinct from the older age-profile of the main Knights, while maintaining the fraternal and supportive link to Order. The Associate Knights in Newry meet on a twice-monthly basis where each meeting starts with a faith-development session followed by discussion of their apostolic projects. The faith- development sessions are led by questions the Associate Knights have about their faith and are answered by an invited priest or permanent deacon. These meetings are led entirely by the Associate Knights to promote leadership skills among its members. Members are able to join by contacting the Newry Primary Council or through the Associate Knights' social media. Members are between 16 and 21 years old. Some of their apostolic projects include assisting with the work of St Vincent de Paul, facilitating special church services such as for examinations, and ReKindling Faith in the Housebound. This scheme aims to provide housebound members of the local community with Kindle Fire tablets purchased through locally fundraised money. Recipients of the tablets are then able to watch local Mass and other church services streamed via webcam. This initiative has received national acclaim as a way of enabling people to participate in their local community, who otherwise would not have been able to do so.Cullen, P. 2016. ReKindling Faith In the Sick and Housebound. http://www.knightsofstcolumbanus.ie/latest-news/rekindling-faith- in-the-sick-and-housebound/ (Accessed 28 September 2016). In 2017, the Associate Knights began operating from the Catholic Chaplaincy at Queen's University Belfast. Their meetings followed a similar structure to those in Newry, with the faith-development led by the resident chaplain. The Associates at QUB are supported by the Drumbo and Carryduff primary council of Knights (CK29). In November 2019, the Associate Knights became a full council of Knights, adopting the vacant Council 19 as their number. This represented the first university council in the Order, similar to the College Councils of the Knights of Columbus.Knights of Columbus#Membership Membership is promoted via stalls at University Freshers Fairs and social media. As the youngest students at university are 18, the upper limit is also higher at 25 to span the most common age of university students. Some of their apostolic projects include the Mary's Meals Backpack Scheme, ShelterNI sleep-outs in aid of homeless charities, providing food to the homeless of Belfast, organising guest speakers and supporting the outreach of the Chaplaincy. == Pope John Paul II Award == The Award was launched by the Papal Nuncio to Ireland Most Rev. Dr. Giuseppe Lazzarotto on 7 November 2006 in the Diocese of Derry. It is coordinated from its head office in Derry, Northern Ireland, and created by Fr Paul Farren in his role as director of the Derry Diocesan Catechetical Centre. Pope John Paul II was chosen as the Award's namesake because of his love, belief, confidence and commitment to young people. The Knights of St Columbanus chose the Award as its National Project and have financially supported the Award throughout Ireland. It enables young people to take an active part in the life of their Church, community and society. In the spirit of Canon O’Neill's vision for education, the Award facilitates awareness of the role of the Catholic Church in the world and to engagement at a deep level with Christ. The Award is non-competitive, flexible and voluntary. Awards are earned by taking part in parish and social activities. There are three awards, Gold, Silver and Bronze, earned by spending 1 hour per week over 8, 14 or 20 weeks respectively. Those who have completed the Gold Award have a further option of completing the Papal Cross Award. As well as the feeling of personal achievement that participants hope to gain from taking part in the award, it is hoped that participation will help to show future employers and educators that they are young people who can make an ongoing commitment to a task. The first patron of the Award was the then Bishop of Derry, Most Rev. Dr. Séamus Hegarty, who said of the Award: \\"the purpose of this initiative is to enable young people to live their faith and to witness to that faith lived out in the parish community\\". The current Bishop of Derry, Most Rev. Dónal McKeown, is the current patron. Since 2006, the Award has been running successfully in schools and parishes throughout Ireland and the UK. It is continuing to expand. In 2017, the Award celebrated its 10-year anniversary with a pilgrimage to Rome and the Vatican. Past and current participants of the Award visited some of the churches and chapels of the cities and got the chance to participate in a Mass in St Peter's Basilica and to visit the tomb of Pope John Paul II. The Knights were represented on the pilgrimage by Associate Knights of St Columbanus from Newry: 181 pilgrims came from 12 dioceses in Ireland. The pilgrimage was captured as part of a UTV documentary 'A New Order'. A televised Mass was also celebrated by Bishop Dónal McKeown on RTÉ with past and current participants of the Award and Supreme Knight Gerald Harbinson on 18 December 2017. == Centenary == In 2015 the Order celebrated its 100th anniversary. The year began with a Eucharistic celebration on Sunday 12 October in Athlone. After this several events were held to mark the occasion; *The Schools Public Speaking Competition was created. This encourages students from all over the island to compete in addressing some contemporary issues faced by Catholic youth today. The 2015 competition was a success and, as of 2017, had become an annual event. *A Day Conference took place in Maynooth College on Saturday 13 June 2015 on the theme of Building a Person-Centered Economy. *An Icon of St Columbanus was completed and presented to the Order at the 2015 Annual Stated Meeting. *A hymn entitled 'Prayer of St Columbanus' was composed especially for the centenary. *A new logo was created and used for the year. *A Columban Way walk, 'Turas Columbanus', was organised. *An Order Pilgrimage to Rome and Bobbio (where St Columbanus spent time) was undertaken that April. == See also == * Knights of Columbus, founded in the United States in 1882. == References  External links == * Official web site of the Knights of Saint Columbanus (archived) * International Alliance of Catholic Knights * Drumbo & Carryduff Council of Knights of St Columbanus (archived) * Pope John Paul II Award Website: http://thepopejohnpauliiaward.com *Associate Knights of St Columbanus Newry Facebook Page: https://www.facebook.com/Newry.Associates/ *Associates at QUB Facebook Page: https://www.facebook.com/AssociatesQUB/ Category:Christian organizations established in 1915 Saint Columba ","title":"Knights of Saint Columbanus"},{"id":"6210195","text":"Chen Shanshan (; born November 21, 1983) is a Chinese classical guitarist.

Born in Cirebon, West Java, as the son of R. Koesoema, who was a surveyor at a local sugar factory, Affandi finished his upper secondary school in Jakarta. He gave up his studies to pursue his desire to become an artist. Beginning in 1934, Affandi began teaching himself how to paint. He married Maryati, a fellow artist. One of his children, Kartika also became an artist. ==Early life== Affandi was born in 1907, in Cirebon. His father was R. Koesoemah. When he was a child, his father wanted him to be a doctor; however, Affandi was interested in drawing. ==Artistic career== In the 1950s, Affandi began to create expressionist paintings. The piece Carrying the First Grandchild (1953) marked his newfound style known as \\"squeezing the tube\\". Affandi painted by directly squeezing the paint out of its tube. He came across this technique by accident, when he intended to draw a line one day. As he lost his patience when he was looking for a missing pencil, he applied the paint directly from its tube. The resulting effect, as he found out, was that the painted object appeared more alive. He also felt more freedom to express his feelings when he used his own hands, instead of a paint brush. In certain respects, he has acknowledged similarities with Vincent van Gogh. Like most of his Indonesian contemporaries, Affandi grew up largely cut off from the mainstream of modern art. It wasn't until the late 1930s that the first exhibitions of major Western artists – from Gauguin to Kandinsky and Picasso – were held in Batavia (today's Jakarta). Affandi was particularly fascinated by the Javanese wayang, or shadow-play. He followed his family to Bandung and then to Batavia, honing his skill at drawing and then at oil painting. By the time he began painting seriously, in 1940, he had at various times been a housepainter, a cinema ticket-collector, and a billboard artist. He would save paints left over from the posters and his other jobs and paint landscapes. Soon he was exhibiting – and, as a surprise to himself – actually selling. With his wife's consent, he decided to devote the first ten days of each month to his trade, and the remaining twenty to his art. His only teachers were a few reproductions that he saw in copies of Studio, an art magazine from London. He felt a kinship with the Impressionists, with Goya and with Edvard Munch, as well as the earlier masters, Breughel, Hieronymus Bosch and Botticelli. Their influence began to show in his paintings. But the grim realities around Affandi made an even greater mark on him. In Yogjakarta one day, just after the Pacific War, Affandi sat painting a market place where folk were grubbing about, half- starved and half-naked. Infuriated at his seeming unconcern, a youth threw dust at the artist and his canvas, shouting: \\"This man is mad! While our people are naked he paints them on canvas and makes a bad painting we cannot understand.\\" Affandi himself said: > One day an art collector looked in my studio and said he couldn't select any > of my paintings because the paintings he saw hurt his feelings. He asked me > why I didn't make paintings of beautiful objects: landscapes, girls, and so > forth. I too like beautiful things, but they do not necessary provide > inspiration for my work. My subjects are expressive rather than beautiful. I > paint suffering – an old woman, a beggar, a black mountain ... My great wish > is that people learn a little from my work. I do know the danger of doing > paintings with this in mind. I have no intention of becoming a social > propagandist, and I must be careful. One day, in India, visiting a village > with my Daughter Kartika, I saw a dead body covered by a mattress. Kartika > said, \\"That's a good subject for you.\\" I felt very touched by what we had > seen, but I told her I would not paint it. My next painting was of a flower, > in reality very fresh, but which on my canvas lacked all life. Some of Affandi's most creative years were spent in India, where he travelled and painted from 1949 to 1951. From there he went to Europe, showing his paintings at the major capitals (among them Paris, London, Brussels, Rome). He has visited the United States thrice, teaching at Ohio State University and painting a mural at the East-West Center in Hawaii. He has shown also at the São Paulo Biennale and travelled through Asia, and was planning for a trip around the world, to do a series of paintings for an art collector in Japan. As a renowned artist, Affandi participated in various exhibitions abroad. Besides India, he also displayed his works in the biennale in Brazil (1952), Venice (1954), and won an award there), and São Paulo (1956). In 1957, he received a scholarship from the United States government to study arts education. He was appointed as an Honorary Professor in Painting by Ohio State University in Columbus. In 1974, he received an honorary doctorate from University of Singapore, the Peace Award from the Dag Hammarskjoeld Foundation in 1977, and the title of Grand Maestro in Florence, Italy. ==Museum== Affandi, self-portrait on a 1997 stamp In Yogyakarta, where he has lived since 1945, Affandi designed for himself a free-form house that has become a stopping place for tourists as well as tourists visiting the old town. The place also functions as a museum to display his paintings. The museum has around 250 of Affandi's paintings. Affandi says that he was struck with the idea for its architecture one day during a rainstorm. He had been walking in the surroundings hills, and took shelter under a huge tree with large leaves. The roof of Affandi's house is shaped like a leaf from this tree, and the high single room sits elevated on structures that resemble two tree trunks. Additional support is provided by the tree trunks richly carved by the famous Balinese sculptor, Nyoman Tjokot. Affandi had two wives. The only child from his first marriage, Kartika, has become a painter herself. A few years later, the artist took a second wife, who has borne him three children. One of his more memorable paintings shows him nude, holding a newborn grandchild, under a blue sky filled with stars. Regrettably, the high air humidity and temperature are causing concerns about the condition of the paintings. The Affandi Foundation, who manages the museum, finds it difficult to manage the museum properly, due to a lack of funds and revenue. Before his death, Affandi spent a lot of time sitting around in his own museum, observing his paintings. He said once, \\"I want to die in simplicity without giving anyone unnecessary trouble, so I could go home to Him in peace.\\" ==Death== Affandi died on May 23, 1990 at the age of 83. He is now buried in the museum complex, as he wished to always be surrounded by his family and his workers. ==FootnotesReferences== * East-West Center, East-West Treasures, Selected Works from the Permanent Collection, East-West Center, Honolulu, 2010, p. 8-9. * ==External links== * NY Times obituary * Affandi Museum Category:1907 births Category:1990 deaths Category:People from Cirebon Category:Indonesian artists ","title":"Affandi"},{"id":"6210198","text":"Performing Chicken is an EP by Money Mark released on Fido Speaks/Love Kit Records in 1994 as a 10\\" mini-album.

Haripad is bordered on the east by Pallippad, Veeyapuram and Karuvatta to the north, Kumarapuram and Karthikapally to the West, and on the south by Nangiarkulangara. Haripad is close to the Arabian Sea and connects Mavelikara and Thrikkunnappuzha. It is known as the land of art, artists, land of snake boats, land of music, dance and drama. A main feature of Haripad which attracts even the foreigners is the \\"Payippad Jalolsavam\\". It is believed that the currently worshiping idol of Lord Subrahmanya was brought from Kandalloor with escort of snake boats and Valla Sadya. The Rajiv Gandhi Combined Cycle Power Plant (NTPC, Kayamkulam) is located in Haripad Assembly Constituency. Haripad derived its name from either Aripad (Ari meaning Rice), or \\"Harigeethapuram\\". The population of Haripad is 16,445, as of the 2011 census. ==History== Earlier it was known as Arippatt, the name Haripad came into prominence only in the 20th century. Some scholars say that it means place near water(ari- arike pat place During the period of European colonization, In the opinion of the Dutch Governor Gollanez the sea coast between Quilon and Purakkad which the Dutch called 'Martha\\" and which region was known as Karthikappally consisted of two regions or nation states, Karnoppally (present-day Karunagapally) and Karimpali. More specifically, Haripad was located in Karimpali which was the area between Kayamkulam and Purakkad and was also known as Vettimana. The capital of Vettimana was Karimpalil palace (near the present-day Haripad Railway Station), but at some point it was moved to Karthikappally. In 1742 Marthanda Varma defeated Karthikappally region and added it to Travancore State. During the period of the kingship, Haripad was a Town, the remaining town hall stands as proof. Also during this period, Haripad was the administrative center of Karthikappally Taluk, and it was from Haripad that the major portion of rice for the state was produced. It is believed that famous poet Kerala Varma Valiakoi Thampuran was kept under house arrest in Haripad Ananthapuram Palace and during his stay at Haripad he wrote 'Mayoora Sandesham' in which he expressed his grief of being separated from his dear wife. In 1921 Haripad got municipal town status, however in 1941 it was downgraded to a non-municipal town. Finally, in 1954 it was changed into a Panchayat. In 2015, it was again upgraded to municipality. Prof. Sudha Suseelan is the 1st chairperson in Haripad Municipality ==Geography== Haripad is a town and municipality in Alappuzha District of Kerala State in India. Its coordinates are Latitude : 9°18′0″N and Longitude : 76°28′0″E, and lies at an elevation of 13 meters. It is bordered on the east by Pallippad, Karuvatta to the north, Kumarapuram and Mahadevikadu to the West, and on the south by Nangiarkulangara.[1] Haripad is close to the Arabian Sea and connects Mavelikkara and Thrikkunnappuzha. Haripad Railway station is located in the heart of the town. Kayamkulam Junction is one of the major Railway stations which is at a distance of 14 kilometers. The nearest airport is at Kochi which is at a 3 h 5 min away (114.1 km) via NH66 Being located in southwestern India, the summer months are characterized by moderately high temperature and high humidity. Monsoon brings rains between late April and July with the best weather being from November to March. As Haripad locates close to the coast heavy annual rainfall is received. ==Arts and culture== The two most famous temples in Haripad are Subrahmanya Swamy temple and Mannarasala Temple. The Subrahmanya Swamy temple in Haripad is one of the oldest temples in Kerala. Dedicated to Subrahmanya Swamy, it is believed that the temple was established even before the advent of Kali Yuga. The temple was consecrated on the Pushya star of Makara Masa. This day is celebrated as the founding day of the temple every year. It is believed that Lord Vishnu appreaded as a saint to consecrate the temple. In 1096 of the Malayalam calendar, the temple caught fire, but the golden flag mast (erected 1067) and the Koothambalam were saved from the fire. The current temple was built during the period of King Chithira Thirunal Balarama Varma, who reigned from 1930 to 1949 (Gregorian Calendar). This temple holds three festivals yearly. The Chithira Ulsavam which starts on the day of Vishu and lasts ten days. The Mannarasala Temple is a Nagaraja temple situated near Haripad. Like most snake temples, it is nestled in a forest glade, and has over 30,000 images of snakes along the paths and among the trees. It is the largest such temple in Kerala. Women seeking fertility come to worship there, and upon the birth of their child, they come again to hold thanksgiving ceremonies, often bringing new snake images as offerings. Sri Ramakrishna Asram at Haripad is the first one in the State of Kerala established in 1913. Another main feature of Haripad which attracts even the foreigners is the Payippad Jalolsavam, a three-day water festival conducted on the nearby Payippad Lake. It is believed the current idol of Lord Subrahmanya was brought from Kandalloor with escort of snake boats and vallasadya. Payippad Jalolsavam is conducted to renew this memory. ==Government== Haripad is the headquarters of Karthikappally taluk, which includes 18 small villages: Arattupuzha, Cheppad, Cheruthana, Chingoli, Haripad, Kandallor,Mahadevikad, Karthikappally, Karuvatta, Keerikkad, Krishnapuram, Kumarapuram, Muthukulam, Pallippad, Pathiyoor, Puthuppally, Thrikkunnapuzha, Veeyapuram.

Animals, plants and fungi all produce triterpenes, including squalene, the precursor to all steroids. ==Structures== Triterpenes exist in a great variety of structures. Nearly 200 different skeletons have been identified. These skeletons may be broadly divided according to the number of rings present. In general pentacyclic structures (5 rings) tend to dominate. {  - ! Number of rings !! Examples -  0  Squalene -  1  -  2  Polypodatetraene -  3  Malabaricane -  4  Lanostane, Cucurbitacin -  5  Hopane, Oleanane, Ursolic acid } ==Triterpenoids== Cholesterol: one of the simplest but most important triterpenoids By definition triterpenes are hydrocarbons and possess no heteroatoms; functionalized triterpenes should instead be called triterpenoids. However this distinction is not always adhered to in scientific literature, with the two terms triterpene and triterpenoid often being used interchangeably. Triterpenoids possess a rich chemistry and pharmacology (e.g. cholesterol) with several pentacyclic motifs. Lupane, oleanane and ursane show particular promise as anti-cancer agents. ===Steroids=== Steroids feature a cucurbitane core, although in practice they are biosynthesised from either lanosterol (animals and fungi) or cycloartenol (plants) via the cyclization of squalene. Steroids have two principal biological functions, being either key components of cell membranes or signaling molecules that activate steroid hormone receptors. Important sub-classes include sterols and cucurbitacins. ===Triterpenoid saponins=== Triterpenoid saponins are triterpenes which belong to the saponin group of compounds, making them triterpenoid glycosides. They are produced by plants as part of their self-defense mechanism with important sub-classes including ginsenosides and eleutherosides. Triterpenes are biosynthesized through the head-to-head condensation of two FPP units to form squalene. In turn, squalene serves as precursor for the formation of triterpenoids, including bacterial hopanoids and eukaryotic sterols.

Its title varies according to the English translation, and it has also been published under the titles The Seducer of Seville and the Stone Guest and The Playboy of Seville and the Stone Guest. The play was first published in Spain around 1630, though it may have been performed as early as 1616.Brockett and Hildy (2003, 144). Set in the 14th century, the play is the earliest fully developed dramatisation of the Don Juan legend.Brockett and Hildy (2003, 144) and Bunn (1998, 1112). ==Main characters== * Don Juan – protagonist (a young noble); relentlessly seduces all women possible by promising them marriage * Duchess Isabela – Duchess that Don Juan tricks; she was going to marry Duke Octavio * Don Gonzalo – nobleman and military commander, Doña Ana's father * Doña Ana – noble woman and Don Gonzalo's daughter; is engaged to Don Juan for a time (but the engagement is broken off) ==Secondary characters== * Octavio – Duke, Isabela's lover * Don Pedro – Don Juan's sympathetic uncle * Tisbea – peasant girl seduced by Don Juan * Catalinón – Don Juan's servant * Don Diego – Don Juan's father * Marqués de la Mota – another womanizer, who is in love with Doña Ana * Aminta – another peasant girl seduced by Don Juan * Batricio – peasant man who is newly married to Aminta * Fabio – Isabela's servant ==SummaryAct One=== The play begins in Naples with Don Juan and the Duchess Isabela who, alone in her palace room, have just enjoyed a night of love together. However, when Isabela wants to light a lamp, she realizes that he is not her lover, the Duke Octavio, and screams for help. Don Juan's uncle, Don Pedro, comes to arrest the offender. But Don Juan cleverly reveals his identity as his nephew and Don Pedro assists him in making his escape just in time. Pedro then claims to the King that the unknown man was Duke Octavio. The King orders Octavio and Isabela to be married at once, with both of them to be held in prison until the wedding. At home, after Octavio speaks of his love for Isabela, Don Pedro comes to arrest him, claiming that Octavio had violated Isabela the previous night. Octavio, of course, had done no such thing, and starts to believe that Isabela has been unfaithful to him. He flees from Don Pedro, planning to leave the country. By the seashore of Tarragona, a peasant girl named Tisbea happens to find Don Juan and his servant, Catalinón, apparently washed up from a shipwreck. She tries to revive Don Juan, who wakes and immediately declares his love for her. Tisbea takes Juan back to her house, intending to nurse him back to health and mend his clothes. Back in Seville, the King speaks to Don Gonzalo, a nobleman and military commander, about arranging a marriage between Don Juan and Gonzalo's daughter, Doña Ana. Gonzalo likes the idea and goes to discuss it with his daughter. Back at the seashore, Don Juan and Catalinón flee, apparently after Don Juan has already seduced Tisbea. Catalinón scolds him, but Don Juan reminds him that this is not his first seduction, and jokes that he has a medical condition in which he must seduce. Catalinón says that he is a plague for women. Tisbea catches up with the two men, and Don Juan assures her that he intends to marry her. Tisbea is so overcome with grief and anger over what happened that she exclaims \\"fuego, fuego\\" meaning that she is burning up with hate and a desire for revenge. She is also overcome with shame at the undoing of her honor and flings herself into the ocean. ===Act Two=== In Seville, Don Diego, Don Juan's father, tells the king that the man who seduced the Duchess Isabela was not Octavio, but Don Juan, and shows a letter from Don Pedro as proof. The King declares Don Juan banished from Seville and retracts his plans to have him marry Doña Ana. Just then, Octavio arrives, begging the king's forgiveness for having fled earlier. The King grants it, and allows him to stay as a guest in the palace. Next, Don Juan and Catalinón arrive and talk to the Marquis de la Mota, who is a womanizer nearly as bad as Don Juan. The Marquis confesses, however, that he is actually in love with his cousin Doña Ana, but laments that she is arranged to marry someone else. Mota says he is going to visit Ana, and Don Juan sends Catalinón to follow him in secret. Don Juan's plans are also helped along when a servant of Ana's, having just seen Don Juan talking to Mota, asks that he give to Mota a letter from Ana. In the letter, Ana asks Mota to visit her during the night, at 11 o'clock sharp, since it will be their one and only chance to ever be together. Mota comes back again, apparently not having found Ana at home, and Don Juan says he received instructions from Ana that Mota should come to the house at midnight. Mota lends Don Juan his cape at the end of the scene. That night at Don Gonzalo's home, Ana is heard screaming that someone has dishonored her, and her father, Don Gonzalo, rushes to her aid with his sword drawn. Don Juan draws his own sword and kills Don Gonzalo. With his final breath, Don Gonzalo swears to haunt Don Juan. Don Juan leaves the house just in time to find Mota and give him his cape back and flees. Mota is immediately seen wearing the same cloak as the man who murdered Don Gonzalo and is arrested. The next day, near Dos Hermanas, Don Juan happens upon a peasant wedding and takes a particular interest in the bride, Aminta. The groom, Batricio, is perturbed by the presence of a nobleman at his wedding but is powerless to do anything. ===Act Three=== Don Juan pretends to have known Aminta long ago and deflowered her already, and by law she must now marry him. He goes to enjoy Aminta for the first time and convinces her that he means to marry her at once. The two of them go off together to consummate the union, with Juan having convinced Aminta that it is the surest way to nullify her last marriage. Elsewhere Isabela and her servant, Fabio, are travelling, looking for Don Juan, whom she has now been instructed to marry. She complains of this arrangement and declares that she still loves Octavio. While travelling, they happen upon Tisbea, whose suicide attempt was unsuccessful. When Isabela asks Tisbea why she is so sad, Tisbea tells the story of how Don Juan seduced her. Isabela then asks Tisbea to accompany her. Don Juan and Catalinón are back in Seville, passing by a churchyard. They see the tomb of Don Gonzalo, and Don Juan jokingly invites the statue on the tomb to have dinner with him and laughs about how the hauntings and promised vengeance have not yet come. That same night, as Don Juan sits down for dinner at his home, his servants become frightened and run away. Don Juan sends Catalinón to investigate, and he returns, horrified, followed by the ghost of Gonzalo in the form of the statue on his tomb. Don Juan is initially frightened but quickly regains control of himself and calmly sits to dine while his servants cower around him. Gonzalo invites Juan to dine again in the churchyard with him, and he promises to come. At the Alcázar, the King and Don Diego, Don Juan's father, discuss the impending marriage to Isabela, as well as the newly arranged marriage between Mota and Doña Ana. Octavio then arrives and asks the King for permission to duel with Don Juan, and tells the truth of what has happened to Isabela to Diego, who was until now unaware of this particular misdeed of his son. The King and Diego leave, and Aminta appears, looking for Don Juan since she thinks he is now her husband. Octavio takes her to the king so that she can tell him her story. In the churchyard, Don Juan tells Catalinón about how lovely Isabela looks and how they are to be married in a few hours. The ghost of Gonzalo appears again, and he sets out a table on the cover of a tomb. He serves a meal of vipers and scorpions, which Juan bravely eats. At the end of the meal, Gonzalo grabs Don Juan by the wrist, striking him dead. In a clap of thunder, the ghost, the tomb, and Don Juan disappear, leaving only Catalinón, who runs away in terror. At the Alcazar, every single character who has been wronged by Don Juan is complaining to the King, when Catalinón enters and announces the strange story of Don Juan's death. All the women who have claim to Don Juan as their husband are declared widows, and Catalinón admits that Ana escaped from Don Juan before he could dishonor her. Mota plans to marry Ana, Octavio chooses to marry Isabela, Tisbea is free to marry again if she chooses, and Batricio and Aminta go back home. ==Adaptations== The play was adapted into Italian in Florence in 1657. ==ReferencesSources== * Banham, Martin, ed. 1998.

Its mission is to develop cadets mentally and physically for service as commissioned officers in the Turkish Army. ==Other Military Colleges== It is not to be confused with: * Ottoman Military College / Army War College (Kara Harp Akademisi/Enstitüsü ) which trained regular officers to become staff officers, * Armed Forces College (Silahlı Kuvvetler Akademisi/Müşterek Harp Enstitüsü) * National Security Collage (Milli Güvenlik Akademisi/Milli Savunma ve Güvenlik Enstitüsü) which civilian students (high- level state executives) attends along with high level military officers. ==History== 263x263px 263x263px 255x255px Kızılay252x252px In recognition of intense demands of science and technology on modern warfare, the Ottoman State abolished the Janissaries and founded the Military Academy in Istanbul in 1834 as an institution devoted to the arts and science of warfare by the order of Sultan Mahmud II. The Academy produced its first graduates in 1841. After the foundation of military high schools in 1845, the Academy continued to give education with a four-year curriculum. The Academy had primarily trained artillery and cavalry officers until 1908. The Military Academies that were founded in five army centers in Adrianople (now known as Edirne in English), Manastır (now Bitola, North Macedonia), Erzincan, Damascus and Bagdad were closed after a short while. Later, only the Military Academy in Constantinople continued education and training. By applying an intensive training program to train soldiers for the fronts during the consecutive war periods, Turkish Military Academy (TMA) started training and education on 1 July 1920 in Abidin Pasha Mansion in Ankara during the Truce Period. TMA produced its first graduates on 1 November 1920. Atatürk hereby penned down his feelings in the book of honor: \\"Turkish Grand Assembly is pleased to see that the first officers of independence who are trained with the national oath of ‘Either independence or death!’ are introduced to our nation and entrusted with their missions.\\" Following the Lausanne Treaty, TMA started education in Constantinople (known in English as Istanbul after 1930) again. Having been transferred to Ankara, the TMA started education in a new building on 25 September 1936. Academy's two-year education period was rearranged as to be a three-year education in 1948, two years in 1963, three years in 1971, and finally four years in 1974. While TMA offered bachelor’s degree in Mechanical Engineering, Civil Engineering, Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Administration/Management between the years 1974-1991, the Academy made a gradual transition to Systems Engineering program. Systems Engineering Program produced its first graduates in 1994. With the Army Regulation for the Military Academies that was passed on 11 May 2000 in the Turkish Grand National Assembly, TMA was recognized as a higher education institution and thus, this served as a basis for the TMA to be organized in a university structure as a contemporary higher education institution. The construction of the monument has started September 1995 and it was opened on October 8th, 1997. After 2016 Turkish coup d'état attempt Military academy (along with Military Academy, Air Force Academy and the all other military educational instutions) became part of the new National Defence University which is formed under Ministry of National Defence. ==Alumni== Mustafa Kemal Atatürk graduated from Manastır Military High School being top of his class with another cadet, Ahmet Tevfik from Selanik, who had the same grades as him, in mid-December in 1898, and thus completed secondary education. Until mid-March in 1899, he had been on-leave. He boarded a ship in Selanik to travel to İstanbul, the capital city at that time, to continue his education in Military Academy. He left Macedonia where he had spent all his childhood and early teenage years for the first time. His enrollment in Military Academy, where he would build up a new life and, his thoughts and his personality world mature, was on 1 March 1315-13 March 1899. His epaulet number was 1283. Cadet Mustafa Kemal was recorded as \\"tall, white skinned Mustafa Kemal 96\\", son of Ali Rıza Efendi, who was one of the customs officers coming from Kasım Paşa District in Selanik, and was written down into the enrollment book which was intended for \\"1315 enrollments.\\" In the book, he was between 1282 Ahmet Tevfik Efendi from Selanik (96) and 1284 Recep Fahri from Manastir Vilayet (95). In that year, Mustafa Kemal was in the first section of the first grade comprising six sections which might have had over 900 or 736 cadets according to different sources. The commander of the Military Academy was General Mustafa Zeki. He was the commander who served most, for 22 years, between 1884 and 1906. He was a wise commander. He would read and write a lot. In order to educate patriotic officers, he worked hard and cared about the cadets. He graduated many famous commanders like Mustafa Kemal, İsmet İnönü, Kazım Karabekir and Fevzi Çakmak. In addition to General Mustafa Zeki, that General Goltz's being \\"the inspector for military schools\\" and General Esat's (Bültani) being the school principal provided the necessary foundation to make the curriculum modern. They redesigned the curriculum after having examined the curriculums in German, French and Belgium schools. Then, The Military Academy had been transformed in education and training. Probably, Mustafa Kemal and his fellow soldiers’ biggest chance was their enrollment in this new period. ==Entry process== There are roughly 4,000 cadets attending the Turkish Military Academy at any one time. In order to enter the academy, prospective cadets must graduate from a high school then pass necessary exams and various tests. Only students displaying the potential to become officers are accepted. The Academy is the only source of commissioned officers for the Turkish Army. After graduation, cadets are required to serve for 15 years. ==Organization== The academy is made up of one regiment and four battalions, or (Turkish Tabur for singular, Taburlar for plural, and Taburu in singular-possessive constructions (like in Battalion of Izmir, which would be Izmir Taburu)), named after famous campaigns during the Turkish War of Independence (except Malazgirt). 1st Battalion is the Anafartalar Battalion, 2nd is the Dumlupinar Battalion, 3rd is the Sakarya Battalion and 4th is the Battle of Manzikert. Each battalion has a separate building, which contains a number of facilities including barracks, dining halls, classrooms, day rooms and study rooms. The cadet regiment has a cadet chain of command which rotates during the school year. The cadet regiment also has a chain of command of regular army officers in mentoring and leadership roles. The cadets are distinguishable and organized by their graduating class as well as their cadet unit. In their classroom uniform, each cadet wears a thin gold bar on their epilate for each year they have been at the academy. Senior cadets, with four bars, also wear the color of the branch of the Turkish Army that they will be entering upon graduation on their collar. For example, green for infantry and gray for armor. The under three classes wear blue on their collar which signifies that they have not yet chosen a branch. The cadet also wears an identification number, a four digit number issued upon entrance to the academy. Atatürk's cadet number, 1283,Cadet 1283 Mustafa Kemal in the official website of the Turkish Military Academy. has been reserved and will not be issued to another cadet. The cadet dress uniform is the same as the Turkish Army officer's uniform, except for the addition of two gold cords looped from the right shoulder across the front right suspending two metal pins. One pin is long, and symbolizes peace while the other is short and symbolizes war. ==See also== * Turkish Air Force Academy * Turkish Naval Academy * Turkish National Police Academy ==References *Kara Harp Okulu Category:1834 establishments in the Ottoman Empire Category:Clemens Holzmeister buildings and structures Category:Military units and formations established in 1834 ","title":"Turkish Military Academy"},{"id":"6210317","text":"Jizerka with the Bukovec Hill Jizerka from Kořenov road (August 2009) Jizerka () is part of municipality Kořenov in Jablonec nad Nisou District. The hamlet located in the Bohemian part of Jizera Mountains, on the border with Silesia, Poland. In the 15th century first inhabitants settled in the area to look for gemstones. The oldest written reference is from 16th century. The settlement was called Bukowec. At the end of the 18th century there were 7 buildings and the inhabitants made a living from forestry and smuggling. In 1829 glassworks were opened. At the peak of the glass industry Jizerka had a population of approximately 450 people. There was a school, pub, sawmill, bakery, blacksmith and other craftsmen. In 1911 the wood-fired glassworks were closed. Coal-fired factories located in the valleys were more efficient. At the same time, tourism began to take off. Some houses became hostels, others pubs. After World War II most of the buildings were nationalised. In the 1980s massive deforestation took place. In the 1990s the buildings were privatised and Jizerka became a recreation centre again. ==External links== *Jizerka.net Category:Czech Republic–Poland border crossings ","title":"Jizerka (Kořenov)"},{"id":"6210326","text":"Christia Sylf was the pseudonym of Christiane Léonie Adélaïde Richard, born 28 September 1924 in Paris, died on 28 November 1980 in Entrevaux (Alpes-de- Haute-Provence). She was a French writer of the fantastique. ==Overview== Christia Sylf's novels were pure heroic fantasy. Kobor Tigan't (1969) and its sequel, Le Règne de Ta [The Reign Of Ta] (1971), take place thirty thousand years ago, during the reign of the Giants, a mythical pre-Atlantean race which preceded ours. The novel tells of the conflict between the sorcerous Queen- Mother, Abim, and her daughters Opak, who rules Kobor Tigan’t, the five- levelled City of the Giants, and her sister, Ta. The world of Kobor Tigan’t is inhabited by a race of reptilian bisexual humanoids, the T’los, who are used as sex slaves by the Giants. The novels also features the crystal-like Elohim, messengers of occult alien powers from beyond, dragons and a host of other fantastic creatures. The Kobor Tigan’t novels are clearly heroic fantasy, yet would be hard to compare to anything published in England or America. They contain numerous erotic scenes as well as esoteric elements that one rarely finds in the more literary worlds of J. R. R. Tolkien or Robert E. Howard. They are written in a rich, colorful prose, and even include a glossary of the language of the Giants. Sylf continued her saga with Markosamo le Sage [Markosamo The Wise] (1973), this time with a story featuring the reincarnations of all her principal characters, but taking place twenty thousand years ago, during the Age of Atlantis. A fourth volume, La Reine au Coeur Puissant [The Strong-Hearted Queen] (1979), carried on with a tale taking place in Ancient China, two thousand years ago. Sylf had announced the publication of five more volumes in her series: La Geste d’Amoïnen [The Saga Of Amoinen], taking place in Nordic Finland; Amiona la Courtisane [Amiona The Courtesan], taking place in Renaissance Venice; Ertulie de Fons l’Abîme [Ertulia Of Fons-The-Abyss], taking place during the reign of the French King Louis XIV; and the two-volume L’Apocalypse de Kébélé [Kebele's Apocalypse], featuring her immortal narrator and taking place in the far future. Unfortunately, these works were never published because Sylf died in the early 1980s, soon after the publication of La Reine au Coeur Puissant [The Strong- Hearted Queen] (1979). Reportedly, she was working on an additional novel, taking place in Ancient Egypt, which was left uncompleted. Her companion was her illustrator, Kerlam. ==Bibliography== * Kobor Tigan't (1969) * Le Règne de Ta [The Reign Of Ta] (1971) * Markosamo le Sage [Markosamo The Wise] (1973) * La Patte de Chat [The Cat's Paw] (coll., 1974) * La Reine au Coeur Puissant [The Strong-Hearted Queen] (1979) ==External links== * french fan site Category:French women writers Category:French fantasy writers Category:1924 births Category:1980 deaths ","title":"Christia Sylf"},{"id":"6210336","text":"\\"Just Let the Sun\\" is the second released from Skin's second album Fake Chemical State.

In 1982 he founded China's first school of classical guitar, the Chen Zhi School of Classical Guitar. In 1986 he assumed the post as council director of the China Beijing Guitar Society. As initiator and artistic director, Chen Zhi organized the first China International Guitar Festival in 1987 and numerous events since then.为祝贺陈志教授从教50周年 He is honorary council member of the CICEC (China International Culture Exchange Center).CICEC Council Member also He has hosted the radio program Classical Guitar Lesson Once a Week since 1984.

Chen has written several books and many articles about the classical guitar, which were published in China. He has lectured in Japan, Spain, Portugal, GermanyGuitar-Symposium, Iserlohn Germany - 1 2 and several other nations. ==Teaching== Chen Zhi is self-taught as teacher.Xuefei Yang interviewed by Macer Hall 2008 marked the 50th anniversary of Chen Zhi's teaching career. His teaching from around the 1990s is such, that based on his students' technical abilities, he is regarded as one of today's top classical guitar teachers (see Quotations below). He primarily teaches young students (often ranging in age from 9 to 15) and some follow a formal track linking middle school, high school and conservatory; many reach a high ability at a young age. He stresses memorization and uses games, competition and rewards. A number of his students, notably Yang Xuefei, Wang Yameng, Su Meng, Li Jie have won international competitions. While he is well known as a teacher, Chen Zhi is himself not an advanced classical guitar player, and no concert performer. In classical guitar demonstration videos, it is always his students that play; with himself just giving explanations, transmitting basic skills, relating how to approach technical aspects, methodology, etc. ===Phases of teaching=== Chen Zhi notes that the guitar and teaching has been an extensive part of his life (teaching since 1958) and experimented a lot with different guitar technique and approaches. He identifies six different phases of teaching/instrumental approaches (changing various technical ideas, etc.), beginning in the 1950s with very basic rudimentary insufficient technique; through later phases in which he had contact with western concert performers (1980s), and began changing the technique he taught (e.g. with nails, different hand-position), up to the last phase, which stabilized around 1996, or later: when he slowly began to arouse increasing interest in the West, due to the high level of his students. He identifies different students who are representative of the various teaching phases.我的教学感受和心得 (Chen Zhi) == References Further reading== *The guitar World of Chen Zhi by Deng Ying (China reconstructs, Volume 36; edited by Zhongguo fu li hui; published by China Welfare Institute, 1987) ==Publications== *Classical Guitar Masterpieces Playing, 古典吉他名曲指导 Performance: Li Jie - Pedagogue: Chen Zhi (Shine Horn, 先恒) (VCD, cover back) (info) *古典吉他基础教程 名师教音乐系列 古典吉他基础教程 (广东东田文化企业有限公司, Guangdong Dongtian Culture Enterprise Co.,Ltd.) , (info, info2) *古典吉他技巧与表现 (info) *Guitar Art (吉他艺术) (info, info, info) ===Early Publications=== *古典吉他定级标准曲目 (info) *吉他广播讲座 (info, info) *吉他博览集 (info) ==External links== *Guitarists strike the right chord at SZ Article : Chen Zhi + concert of students Wang Yameng and Su Meng (News Guangdong) ===Biography=== *Biography (www.almaguitar.com) *A Brief Introduction of Chen Zhi *Biography (www.guitarchina.com) *Biography (www.mlguitar.net) *Biography (www.guitarchina.com) *Biography (www.zhguitar.com) *Biography (www.ccom.edu.cn) *Biography ===Articles=== *1 2 Interview with Chen Zhi (www.mlguitar.net) *论陈志古典吉他教学艺术 - The classical guitar teaching art of Chen Zhi (12 3) by 李先龙 (Xian-Long Li) ===Photos=== *Cover Photo of Classical Guitar Magazine *Photo of a Masterclass (Chen Zhi is seen holding a metronome) *Teaching in the context of a guitar festival 1, 2 Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:Chinese classical guitarists Category:People's Republic of China musicians Category:Central Conservatory of Music faculty ","title":"Chen Zhi (guitarist)"},{"id":"6210361","text":"The Church of St John Gressoney-Saint-Jean (Gressoney ; ; ) is a town and comune in the Aosta Valley region of north-western Italy. ==Geography== The town is situated in a valley formed by the torrent Lys which is fed by the Lys glacier. == History, Walser culture and language == Kindergarten and elementary school in Gressoney.

It was based on the successful Scandinavian show Kerry's Getting Married, which revolves around a single woman's quest to find a partner and get married. It was produced by Screentime, which purchased the format from Strix Television. The show debuted on Tuesday, 1 August 2006, and was hosted by Jo Stanley from FOX FM Melbourne. She was also joined by Ryan Phelan, anchor of Sports Tonight, and Christine Chinchen, a relationship counsellor. Guests included comedian Matt Hardy, wedding planner Kathy Apostolidis, and Bree Amer. The show's theme song was a cover of Dusty Springfield's \\"Wishin' and Hopin'\\", sung by Neighbours star Stephanie McIntosh. The track appears on her album Tightrope. ==OverviewThe Bride=== Yasmin Dale, a 29-year-old recruitment manager, was the star contestant in the show. Her goal during the series was to find a groom during the nine-week run of the show and marry him in a wedding broadcast live on Channel Ten at the end of the series. Dale was not the original subject of the show. The original bride was a woman named Rene, and the show was subsequently originally titled and advertised as Rene's Getting Married. However, the original contestant pulled out of the show and pursued a relationship independent of the program two weeks before the premiere of the series, thus facilitating the need for a title and contestant change.Bride to wannabe, The Age, 27 July 2006 ===The potential grooms=== On the first episode, viewers were introduced to the first six candidates to be Yasmin's husband: Vincent, Adam, Athan, Max, Peter and Deryn. At the end of the first episode the panel of \\"experts\\" had whittled the number down to three: Vincent, Peter and Deryn. Viewers were then given around 24 hours to vote to decide which of these three would receive the honour of a date with Yasmin. In the second episode, Vincent was the first of the three to be eliminated. Later, Peter was chosen as the lucky man. ==Cancellation== The program was axed by Network Ten on Sunday, 6 August 2006, just four episodes into its projected nine-week run. Network Ten's chief programming officer, David Mott, said that \\"Ten has a reputation for taking risks with new formats, as evidenced by our success with The Biggest Loser, Thank God You're Here and The Wedge—to name just three hits we've launched this year. While we all had very high hopes for Yasmin's Getting Married, it is clear at this early stage that our audience has not embraced this bold new initiative. We have therefore elected to cease production on the Screentime-produced reality program and move on.\\" A statement from the network cites disappointing ratings as the primary reason for the cancellation. Network Ten and Screentime have indicated that Yasmin will have to find the love of her life by more conventional means, although they will assist her with the costs of the wedding. As of now, Yasmin is still waiting for her chance to finally walk down the aisle.Yasmin's Wedding called off, eBroadcast Australia, 6 August 2006 The show was replaced with episodes of Futurama in the same 7 p.m. timeslot. ===Legacy=== The show was sometimes a target in the first series of The Chaser's War On Everything, when they created a bogus reality TV show called Chasmin's Getting Married. They also purported that the 2006 Census showed that \\"100% of people don't want to marry Yasmin.\\" Also they did a parody in the popular segment \\"In Other News\\", which included Chas Licciardello in a wedding dress running through Sydney trying to find a man, in all the wrong places. ==References External links == * Category:Australian reality television series Category:Interactive television Category:Network 10 original programming Category:2006 Australian television series debuts Category:2006 Australian television series endings Category:Wedding television shows Category:Television series by Screentime ","title":"Yasmin's Getting Married"},{"id":"6210370","text":"Fénis (Valdôtain: ) is a town and comune in the Aosta Valley region of north- western Italy.

A selvage (US English) or selvedge (British English) is a \\"self-finished\\" edge of a piece of fabric which keeps it from unraveling and fraying. The term \\"self-finished\\" means that the edge does not require additional finishing work, such as hem or bias tape, to prevent fraying. In woven fabric, selvages are the edges that run parallel to the warp (the longitudinal threads that run the entire length of the fabric), and are created by the weft thread looping back at the end of each row. In knitted fabrics, selvages are the unfinished yet structurally sound edges that were neither cast on nor bound off.McCall's Sewing Book, Random House: 1968: 198, 224 Historically, the term selvage applied only to loom woven fabric, though now can be applied to flat-knitted fabric. The terms selvage and selvedge are a corruption of \\"self-edge\\", and have been in use since the 16th century.\\"Selvage.\\" The Oxford English Dictionary. 2nd ed. 1989. == In textiles In woven cloth=== In textile terminology, threads that run the length of the fabric (longitudinally) are warp ends. Threads running laterally from edge to edge, that is from left side to right side of the fabric as it emerges from the loom, are weft picks. Selvages form the extreme lateral edges of the fabric and are formed during the weaving process. The weave used to construct the selvage may be the same or different from the weave of the body of the fabric cloth. Most selvages are narrow, but some may be as wide as . Descriptions woven into the selvage using special jacquards, colored or fancy threads may be incorporated for identification purposes. For many end-uses the selvage is discarded. Selvages are 'finished' and will not fray because the weft threads double back on themselves and are looped under and over the warp.A. Richard Horrocks, Subhash Anand, Textile Institute, Handbook of technical textiles Chapter 4.3 Selvedge Construction, Woodhead Publishing: 2000, , 559 pages: 74-75 Handwoven selvages vs. industrial selvages There is a slight difference between the selvages in handweaving and in industry, because while industrial looms originally very closely mimicked handweaving looms, modern industrial looms are very different. A loom with a shuttle, such as most hand weaving looms, will produce a very different selvage from a loom without a shuttle, like some of the modern industrial looms. Also in industry sometimes the selvage is made thicker with a binding thread. Selvages of fabrics formed on weaving machines with shuttles, such as hand looms, are formed by the weft turning at the end of each pick (pass of the weft thread) or every second pick. To prevent fraying, various selvage motions (or \\"styles\\") are used to bind the warp into the body of the cloth. Selvages are created to protect the fabric during weaving and subsequent processing (i.e. burnishing, dyeing and washing) but ideally should not detract from the finished cloth via ripples, contractions or waviness. In handweaving the selvage is generally the same thickness as the rest of the cloth, and the pattern may or may not continue all the way to the edge, thus the selvage may or may not be patterned. A plain weave selvage is the other option, where the last few threads on either side are woven in plain weave. In industry the selvage may be thicker than the rest of the fabric, and is where the main weft threads are reinforced with a tight weft back binding to prevent fraying. More simply, they \\"finish\\" the left and right-hand edges of fabric as it exits the loom, especially for the ubiquitous \\"criss-cross\\" simple or tabby weave, referred to in industry as taffeta weave.Kate Heinz Watson, Textiles and Clothing American School of Home Economics, Chicago: 1907 Selvages on machine-woven fabric often have little holes along their length, through the thick part, and can also have some fringe. The type or motion of selvage depends on the weaving technique or loom used. A water- or air-jet loom creates a fringed selvage that is the same weight as the rest of the cloth, as by the weft thread is drawn via a jet nozzle, which sends the weft threads through the shed with a pulse of water. The selvage is then created by a heat cutter which trims the thread at both ends close to the edge of the cloth, and then it is beaten into place. Thus it creates a firm selvage with the same thickness as the rest of the cloth.  Usability of the selvage  In the decorative embellishment of garments, especially in decorative pleat or ruffles, a selvage used as a ruffle is \\"self-finished\\", that is, it does not require additional finishing work such as hem or bias tape to prevent fraying.Colette Wolff, The art of manipulating fabric, KP Craft: 1996 , 311 pages: pp299 Very often fabric near the selvage is unused and discarded, as it may have a different weave pattern, or may lack pile or prints that are present on the rest of the fabric, requiring that the selvage fabric be cut off or hidden in a hem. Since industrial loomed fabric often has selvages that are thicker than the rest of the fabric, the selvage reacts differently. It may shrink or \\"pucker\\" during laundering and cause the rest of the object made with it to pucker also. Thicker selvages are also more difficult to sew through. Quilters especially tend to cut off the selvage right after washing the fabric and right before cutting it out and sewing it together. For garments, however, the selvage can be used as a structural component as there is no need to turn under that edge to prevent fraying if a selvage is used instead.The British Rayon and Synthetic Fibres Manual, Harlequin Press: 1954, 364 pages: pp232 Using the selvage eliminates unnecessary work, thus the garment article can be made faster, the finished garment is less bulky and can be stitched entirely by machine. This is of major benefit for the mass- produced ready-to-wear clothing of modern society. However, it is less used in homemade clothes because of the tendency of the selvage to pucker. ===In knitted cloth=== Applying the term selvage to a hand-knitted object is still relatively new. Most books on fabric define a selvage as the edge of a woven cloth. However, the term is coming into usage for hand-knitted objects. The edges of machine-knitted fabric on the other hand are rarely if ever referred to as selvages. Selvages in knitting can either bear a special pattern worked into the first and last stitches or simply be the edge of the fabric. The two most common selvage stitches are the chain-edge selvage and the slipped-garter edge, both of which produce a nice edge. The chain-edge selvage is made by alternating rows of slipping the first stitch knitwise and knitting the last stitch, with rows of slipping the first stitch purlwise and purling the last stitch. The slipped garter edge is made by slipping the first stitch knitwise and knitting the last in every row. Other selvages include a garter stitch border one stitch wide, or a combination of the above techniques. Knitting selvages makes the fabric easier to sew together than it would be otherwise. It also makes it easier to pick up stitches later, and is a good basis for crocheting a further decorative edge.June Hemmons Hiatt (1988) The Principles of Knitting, Simon and Schuster, pp. 163–168. ==In printing and philately== Part of a sheet of postage stamps from Australia showing selvage at the bottom.

Toad has recently left his home town to begin a new life in Ann Arbor where his co-dependent, folk-singing sister Jenny (Amy Raasch) lives with her verbally abusive fiancé, a law student named Calvin (Aaron Williams). Jenny currently sees a suicidal therapist (Peter Hawkins) four times a week and armed with her acoustic guitar, drives away patrons from a local coffee house where she slings cappuccinos with her best friend Squeeze (Melissa Zafarana). Squeeze is a closet genius whose easy-going outlook and unconditional support keep her live-in boyfriend Hank (David Wilcox) from the brink. Hank is a painter who cannot paint because he spends his time baking delicious pastries and practicing for The Oprah Winfrey Show. In Ann Arbor, the civilians listen to Julian (Julian Rad), a nihilistic dee-jay whose frustration and lingering optimism goad him to find the truth by cutting through blind idealism, pop culture, and politically correct bumper stickers. Once in Ann Arbor, Duncan encounters these and other eccentric characters, and through his simple outlook and curiosity, he changes their lives forever. *** Duncan's Letter to Julian in The Four Corners of Nowhere: Dear Julian, I think it all started with the Declaration of Independence — the idea that we had the inalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. That pursuit is what took America from the revolution to the computer age in 200 years. But the progress has come at a price. The obvious being the people that were exploited to make it possible; the not so obvious being us, the first group of people that were given no obvious frontiers to conquer. We hear stories about the good old days that don't seem to apply anymore. It's a generation gap that leaves us without role models. But the bright side is that without role models, there are no roles. Thirty years ago that girl you talked to probably would have married her fiancé because it would have been expected, but she ended up leaving him. Maybe that's what the 60s were all about — getting rid of the roles. But what do we replace them with? Without any guidance, the choices become overwhelming. Sometimes it just makes everything feel hopeless. So we destroy our bodies in the search of an ideal. Try to salvage relationships that don't work. We feel we must do something, instead of doing something that we feel. It is the prison of self-imposed momentum, and the sad part is that we get used to it. It reminds me of a song I heard the other day. It's called \\"The Going Nowhere Fast.\\" But the people I have met here have shown me another side of Nowhere. They've pointed out the beautiful irony that stagnation makes it easy to stop and smell the roses, if we just let it. What would we be if we had nothing to rebel against? Well we could finally be ourselves, the first group of people who stopped looking for the answers long enough to appreciate the questions. And all we have to do is to make our own Declaration of Independence. We can embrace the right to life and liberty by simply realizing that happiness exists — not to pursue, but to accept. After that the only challenge would be to make sure with the rest of our lives that we weren't just another fad. I don't know, Julian, it's an idea. ** ==Starring== * Mark McClain Wilson as Duncan * Amy Raasch as Jenny * Eric Vesbit as Toad * David Wilcox as Hank * Melissa Zafarana as Squeeze * Aaron Williams as Calvin * Julian Rad as Julian * Dean Weathers as Transiet Poet ==External links== * **Cast photo on IMDb *Trailer for Four Corners of Nowhere on YouTube *Copies in Libraries and Archives on WorldCat *In a corner of Nowhere by David Green *Film review in Variety *1995 interview from Sundance Film Festival *1995 television interview on The Movie Show *Movle clip of Duncan's letter (starts at 1:08 in the video) *March 1, 1998 article in The Michigan Daily *Tribute playlist on 8tracks.com Category:1995 films Category:American comedy films Category:American films Category:English- language films Category:Films directed by Stephen Chbosky Category:1995 directorial debut films ","title":"The Four Corners of Nowhere"},{"id":"6210439","text":"Montjovet (Valdôtain: ) is a town and comune in the Aosta Valley region of north-western Italy. Montjovet lies in the lower Aosta Valley, between France and Switzerland. Though it only has an area of 18.7 square kilometers, the commune has 50 villages and hamlets, and a number of hills, the highest of which is Mont Lyan, at 2174 metres. Historically, the parish was under the control of the Bishop of Aosta. The current main parish church, Parrocchia della Natività della Vergine Maria, opened in 1837. ==History== The parish has a long history, and was mentioned as being under the control of the Bishop of Aosta in Pope Alexander III's ecclesia sancti Eusebii de Plubeio of 20 April 1176. In the 13th century, a massive landslide altered a lot of the terrain in the commune, destroying the original parish church. The seat of the parish was at Borso for a period, and it was originally administered by diocesan priests. It was ceded in 1433 to the provost of Saint-Gilles of Verrès, which it remained under until the mid 18th century when it was returned to Borso. For a period, the Challant family of nobles had the right to appoint the parish priest at the Parrocchia della Natività della Vergine Maria church. ==Geography== Part of the Evançon Mountain Community in the lower Aosta Valley, it is strategically placed between France and Switzerland. Montjovet has the largest number of villages of any commune in the valley, with 50. It covers an area of 18.7 square kilometers, with numerous plains and hills, including the 370 metre hill Plout on the border with Verrès, up to the highest point, Mont Lyan, at 2174 metres. ==Landmarks== The Town Hall The current parish church, Parrocchia della Natività della Vergine Maria, commenced construction in 1830 and was consecrated on 3 May 1837. The Parrocchia di Saint Germain church was consecrated on 1 May 1704, and retains a 16th century bell tower from a previous church. The rectangular church has a large portico at the entrance. Chiesa del Grand Hoel was built in 1630 and underwent reconstruction in 1830. Chiesa Meran was built in 1775, while the Chiesa Barmachande was erected in 1878. Other churches include Chiesa Rodoz, Chiesa Guaz, Chiesa Plout, Chiesa Barmas, Chiesa Estaod, Chiesa Ciresan and Chiesa Chenal. ==References *Official site Category:Cities and towns in Aosta Valley ","title":"Montjovet"},{"id":"6210442","text":"the town in winter Oyace (Valdôtain: ) is a town and comune in the Aosta Valley region of north-western Italy. ==Notes== Category:Cities and towns in Aosta Valley ","title":"Oyace"},{"id":"6210443","text":"Eau et rivières de Bretagne (Water and rivers of Brittany) is the second most important environmental organisation in Brittany, the first being the SEPNB (Société pour l'Étude et la Protection de la Nature en Bretagne – Society for the Study and Protection of Nature in Brittany) now called Bretagne Vivante (Living Brittany).

He was noted for his light music compositions. Allmusic journalist, Bradley Torreano stated \\"Ray Martin created a legacy for himself in British popular music through his work with his orchestra during the 1950s. His regular appearances on radio and television kept him in the public spotlight, while his position at EMI Records made him an influential producer at the label. His use of pseudonyms has blurred the path of his career through the years, making his many contributions even harder to keep track of. But his original compositions are what really made him popular; tracks like \\"Marching Strings\\" have become stables [sic] of many public and city bands and orchestras since their release\\". ==Career== Raymond Stuart Martin was born as Kurt Kohn in Vienna, Austria, and was initially a violinist. He went to the State Academy of Music and Fine Art in Vienna. In 1938, he immigrated to England and was a Carroll Levis discovery. Around this time, Ray was viewed by the British government as possible German spy during World War II, so he was arrested and placed on the ship HMT Dunera that took him and many others to Australia where he was interned at Hay, Tatura and Loveday prisoner of war camps. He returned to England in October 1941, joining the British Army having been officially cleared. As he was multilingual, he served in the Intelligence Corps for six years. He became an arranger and composer for the Royal Air Force Band. During this time, he also managed to rescue his brother, who was imprisoned in a concentration camp or possibly a prisoner of war camp. After the war's end, he worked in radio for the British Forces Network in Hamburg, Germany, and later formed his own orchestra for a programme called Melody from the Sky which had over 500 performances. He became the conductor of the BBC Northern Variety Orchestra and also worked for EMI as a record producer and arranger. In this period he wrote many scores for TV and movies, including the score to the acclaimed Diana Dors film Yield to the Night in 1956. He moved to the US in 1957, where he worked on both Broadway and Hollywood productions. In 1959 he arranged two LPs of Classic US Television Themes named Impact and Double Impact on RCA-Victor for Buddy Morrow and his Orchestra – one of the first such collections on record. Martin composed more than 2,000 works, many of which were recorded for RCA and Polydor. He returned to the UK in 1972, but was comparatively unproductive. In 1980 he moved to South Africa, where he died in Johannesburg, from cancer in 1988 at the age of 69. ==Selection of his light music titles== * \\"Melody from the Sky\\" * \\"Once upon a Wintertime\\" * \\"Blue Violins\\" * \\"Waltzing Bugle Boy\\" * \\"Airborne\\" * \\"Ballet of the Bells\\" * \\"Tango of the Bells\\" * \\"Marching Strings\\" (composition credited to Marshall Ross, a pseudonym) – was used as the theme tune for BBC school quiz show, Top of the Form * \\"Begorrah\\" * \\"The Sound of Sight\\" ==Chart singles== *\\"Blue Tango (1952) – UK No. 8 *\\"Swedish Rhapsody\\" (1953) – UK No. 4 *\\"The Carousel Waltz\\" (1956) – UK No. 24 ==ReferencesFurther reading== *Oxford Companion to Popular Music by Peter Gammond - published by Oxford University Press - ==External links== *Robert Farnon Society: Ray Martin biography (by David Ades) * *Profile of Ray Martin at spaceagepop.com Category:1918 births Category:1988 deaths Category:Musicians from Vienna Category:Ivor Novello Award winners Category:English conductors (music) Category:British male conductors (music) Category:English record producers Category:RCA Victor artists Category:Deaths from cancer in South Africa Category:Light music composers Category:Easy listening musicians Category:20th-century British conductors (music) Category:20th-century composers Category:20th-century English musicians ","title":"Ray Martin (orchestra leader)"},{"id":"6210448","text":"John James Robertson (23 May 1898 – 6 October 1955) was a Scottish Labour Party politician who served as a Member of Parliament from 1945–1951.

It is a form of a circle dance. ==Technique== The dancers link little fingers in a long line, swinging their arms, and moving to their left by taking longer steps in that direction than when stepping right. In the generic case the arm movements consist first of two circular motions going up and back (at about chest level) followed by one in the opposite direction (down then front); these are done quite close to the body. This is then followed by a circle in the same sense as the last (down then front) but with full arm extension and extending behind the body. The cycle then repeats. ===Steps=== Stepping is on the beat throughout, moving to the left on the close arm circles and in place (or sometimes to the right) on the second two. The stance is upright, with soft knees. A full set of steps takes 8 times, divided in two half-steps: *1st half-step, 4 times: ** 1st time: the left foot moves on the left ** 2nd time: the right foot joins the left foot ** 3d time: the left foot moves again ** 4th time: the feet don't move, the body still supported by the left foot *2nd half-step, 4 times: ** 5th time: the right foot joins the left foot ** 6th time: the left foot marks time (up & down in one time) ** 7th time: the right foot marks time (up & down in one time) ** 8th time: the feet don't move, the body stands on the right foot. It is easy to do this dance within a short time of practice; this allows full beginners to quickly join the line during the festoù noz. ===Customs=== At a bal there will be several lines forming, with the leader leading his/her line in some pattern. The leader (person at the left-hand end of the line) will lead the line into a spiral or double it back on itself to form patterns on the dance floor, and allow the dancers to see each other. An dros often have songs associated with them, and these are usually sung as a verse-chorus or call-response, with the leader singing the verses or calls. The musicians will sometimes play from the middle of the dance floor, and the dancers will then often form a spiral around them. ==See also== *Dabke *Faroese dance *Fest Noz *Hora *Khigga *Kolo *List of ethnic, regional, and folk dances by origin *Syrtos *Tamzara, another circle dance where the participants interlock their pinkies *Yalli ==External links== * A YouTube video of the dance—which begins at 1:18 Category:Breton dances Category:Circle dances ","title":"An Dro"},{"id":"6210462","text":"Roslags Näsby railway station Roslags Näsby is a neighbourhood in the southern part of Täby Municipality, north of Stockholm.

It is found at great depths worldwide in tropical to temperate oceans but is absent from the northern Pacific and northwest Atlantic Oceans. ==Description== Stomias boa boa is a long, slender fish. The head is small, the mouth has a protuberant lower jaw and sharp, pointed teeth. It is very scary looking due to its \\"sharp fangs,\\" say local fishermen. There is a large fleshy barbel projecting from the chin with a pale stalk, a dark spot at the base of the bulb and a dark filament. The dorsal fin has no spines and 17 to 22 soft rays and the anal fin has 18 to 22 soft rays. The dorsal and anal fins are positioned on the slender caudal peduncle and the caudal fin is forked. The skin is covered in small hexagonal scales. The maximum length of this fish is about . Like many fish of deep oceans, it has large eyes and is transparent and silvery in appearance with iridescent speckles. ==Distribution and habitat== Stomias boa boa has a wide distribution, being found in the eastern Atlantic Ocean, the western Mediterranean Sea, the west coast of Africa as far south as Mauritania and southern Africa from Angola to the Cape of Good Hope. On the other side of the Atlantic it is found from the Northwest Territories of Canada to Argentina. It is also known from Chile and the sub-Antarctic region of the Indian Ocean south to Heard Island. It usually inhabits waters deeper than in the daytime but migrates upwards towards the surface during the night. ==Ecology== Stomias boa boa is a predator and mainly feeds on fish. It is itself preyed on by the deepwater hakes Merluccius paradoxus and Merluccius capensis, the blackmouth catshark Galeus melastomus and the swordfish Xiphias gladius. Stomias boa boa has large light-producing photophores behind the eyes and other smaller ones scattered across the body in a geometrical pattern, mostly on the ventral surface. Special organs near the eyes detect the amount of illumination in the surrounding water and this enables the fish to adjust the amount of light its photophores emit. The bioluminescence can be turned on and off at will and may confuse potential predators. Other species of fish emit light in a similar way, and the particular arrangement of photophores in the scaly dragonfish permits individuals to identify other fish of the same species. ==References== * Tony Ayling & Geoffrey Cox, Collins Guide to the Sea Fishes of New Zealand, (William Collins Publishers Ltd, Auckland, New Zealand 1982) Category:Stomiidae Category:Fish described in 1810 ","title":"Scaly dragonfish"},{"id":"6210466","text":"view of the town with the Parish church Pré-Saint-Didier (Valdôtain: ) is a town and comune in the Aosta Valley region of north-western Italy, at above sea level. ==Transportation== The terminus of the regional railway is located there, although with no services since 2015.

Jacks, directed by Robert Wise, that stars Richard Burton, James Mason, and Robert Newton. The film's storyline concerns the Siege of Tobruk in North Africa during World War II. ==Plot== During mid-April 1941 in North Africa, German Field Marshal Erwin Rommel (James Mason) and his Afrika Korps have driven the British Army into headlong retreat toward Egypt and the vital Suez Canal. Standing in Rommel's way is Tobruk, a constant threat to his supply lines. The 9th Australian Division are charged with holding the port for two months, at which time they are to be relieved. The defending Allied general (Robert Douglas) chooses British Captain \\"Tammy\\" MacRoberts (Richard Burton), an experienced field officer, to take command of a company of newly arrived, untried Australian troops. The no-nonsense MacRoberts is disliked by the undisciplined Australians. He is surprised to see in their ranks his former schoolmaster, Tom Bartlett (Robert Newton). Bartlett, an alcoholic, later explains that after being dismissed from his job in Britain due to his drinking, he went to Australia and joined the army while intoxicated. MacRoberts offers to transfer him to a safer billet, but Bartlett turns him down. Meanwhile, the inexperienced troops are sent directly into the front lines, where they dig foxholes and prepare for Rommel's attack. The Allied general masses his artillery where he guesses the Germans will strike. His gamble pays off. Under cover of a sandstorm, they attack exactly where the general predicted and head directly at MacRoberts' men. but the Germans are beaten back. As a result, MacRoberts is elevated to battalion command and made a lieutenant colonel. It is decided to erode the Germans' confidence further by sending out small commando raids every night. MacRoberts' patrols do their part in exacting a toll on the enemy. But during a successful raid on a Nazi ammunition dump, MacRoberts is wounded and captured. While he is being treated by a German doctor, he meets Rommel, who has been shot by a strafing Spitfire. Although he is respectful to the field marshal, MacRoberts defiantly points out that Tobruk is a thorn in his side. Rommel is bemused by his brashness and orders that he be treated well. Later, MacRoberts escapes capture during an air raid on a German truck convoy, and he makes his way back to Allied lines. The siege of Tobruk carries on for months. As a result, MacRoberts fears his men are becoming weary and will need to be relieved from action. But an order comes down from the general, asking MacRoberts to take his best company and hold a key position for three days. Nine days later, after constant attacks and shelling by the Germans, MacRoberts believes his men can take no more and orders a retreat. Surprisingly, the self-admitted coward, Bartlett, begs him to hang on. To MacRoberts' surprise, the rest of his men refuse to abandon the hill. Bartlett takes over the forward observation post, where survival is measured in hours. Eventually, the Australians hear bagpipes announcing the arrival of a relief column. After a hard-fought 242 days, the Allies have relieved Tobruk. ==Cast== * Richard Burton as Captain \\"Tammy\\" MacRoberts * James Mason as Field Marshal Erwin Rommel * Robert Newton as Tom Bartlett * Robert Douglas as the General * Torin Thatcher as Colonel Barney White * Chips Rafferty as Sergeant \\"Blue\\" Smith * Charles \\"Bud\\" Tingwell as Lieutenant Harry Carstairs (as Charles Tingwell) * Charles Davis as Pete * Ben Wright as Mick * Michael Pate as Captain Currie (uncredited) * John Alderson as Australian Corporal (uncredited) ==History== The film is based on the Australian 9th Division, who were charged with the defence of Tobruk under the command of General Leslie Morshead. Hoping to survive against overwhelming odds for two months, the garrison held off the best of Rommel's Afrika Korps for over eight months. Morshead was a distinguished Australian citizen-soldier, but is depicted in the film as the anonymous \\"General\\" and played by English actor Robert Douglas. ==ProductionDevelopment=== The film was a quasi-sequel to The Desert Fox: The Story of Rommel (1951), which had been successful critically and commercially, particularly in England. It was, reportedly, partly made to portray a less likeable General Rommel, after criticism that film had been too friendly to the Germans. Rommel is again played by James Mason only this time he usually speaks in German and is not sympathetic. The title \\"Desert Rats\\" was selected to refer to the earlier title \\"Desert Fox\\". Mason wore Rommel's real scarf in the film, which had been given to him by the general's widow. In October 1951 Fox announced that Robert L. Jacks would produce and Sam Fuller, who saw active duty in World War II and who had just made Fixed Bayonets for Fox, would direct. The film was based on a book, The Siege of Tobruk by Gregory Rogers, and filming was to start in January 1952. Zanuck said research revealed a few Americans were involved in the siege but none appeared in the final film. Filming was delayed and Fuller dropped out to work on other films. In July 1952 Fox announced that that filming would take place in September and the three leads would be played by Michael Rennie, Robert Newton and James Robertson Justice. (Rennie and Newton had just made Les Misérables together). The script was written by an American, Richard Murphy, who was familiar with Australian servicemen from his time being a liaison officer with the Ninth Division in New Guinea, after its withdrawal from the Middle East in 1942. Filming was pushed back further. In October Fox replaced Rennie with Richard Burton, who had just appeared in My Cousin Rachel for the studio and signed a contract with Fox to make one film a year for ten years. (Instead, as he had done in The Desert Fox several years earlier, Rennie delivered an uncredited voiceover.) The same month Robert Wise was assigned to direct. Several genuine Australian actors were cast, including Chips Rafferty, Charles Tingwell, Michael Pate and John O'Malley. Tingwell and Rafferty had just made Kangaroo (1952) for Fox in Australia and were flown to Hollywood. Richard Boone, who had just made Kangaroo with Rafferty and Tingwell, was announced for an important role. He ended up not appearing in the film. In November, Robert Newton's casting was confirmed, as was that of James Mason, who would reprise his role as Rommel. Filming started December 1952. Australian journalist Alan Moorehead was used as a consultant and the technical adviser was an Englishman now in the Canadian Army, Lieutenant George Aclund, who took part in the defence of Tobruk. The battle sequences were shot near Borrego Springs, a Californian desert town. Some background scenes were taken from the documentary Desert Victory (1943). ==Inaccuracies== The title of the film is a misnomer: The \\"Desert Rats\\" were actually the British 7th Armoured Division, the name coming from their jerboa shoulder flash. The Australian 9th Division besieged at Tobruk were denigrated as being \\"caught like rats in a trap\\" by German propaganda, the Australians calling themselves \\"the Rats of Tobruk\\" with pride as a result. Also, Erwin Rommel is described as a field marshal at the time of the siege when he was actually a lieutenant-general; he would become a field marshal in June 1942, after the fall of Tobruk. Chips Rafferty and Charles Tingwell had both served in the army, and said they tried to correct inaccuracies in the script, but were only partly successful. \\"The script was full of Cockney idiom\\", said Rafferty. \\"I was invited to look over it a week before shooting began, and managed to get some of it changed into Australian slang.\\" \\"There's one scene in which the sergeant – myself – refuses to obey the colonel's order, while two lieutenants stand idly by\\", added Rafferty. \\"That will raise some Ninth Division eyebrows.\\" A key plot point involved the Australian general deliberately letting German tanks through the defences. \\"To my knowledge there was no such plan to let the Germans in through the outer defences\\", said Tingwell. \\"But whenever difficulties of that sort were mentioned the Hollywood experts claimed to be working on a script based on the actual battle plans of the campaign.\\" Other criticisms made of the film include the fact no British officer was ever placed in command of an Australian battalion in Tobruk, and there was no raid on the ammunition dump as depicted, although there was one on the Twin Pimples, held by Italy, and there is no depiction of the British, Polish or Indian troops who were there. Prior to the film being screened, Chips Rafferty admitted it was likely the film would be criticised by ex- servicemen. \\"To tell the truth, I think there's going to be a bit of a howl\\", he said. This prediction proved to be correct. Lieutenant-General Sir Leslie Morshead said that, \\"The story is wholly foreign to the Tobruk I knew, and to its force which comprised almost as many gallant, purposeful British troops as those of the Ninth Division, all of whom I had the honour to command.\\" ==Reception== The film received generally good reviews from British critics, although they complained the British contribution to the campaign had been minimised. Australian critics were also positive despite the historical inaccuracies. The film was banned in Egypt. During production, 20th Century Fox offered Charles Tingwell, who had also appeared in Fox's Kangaroo, a seven-year contract, but he turned it down because he wanted to keep working in Australia.Charles Tingwell interview at Australian Biography ==See also== * The Rats of Tobruk (1944 film) * Western Desert Campaign * North African Campaign ==References* * Category:1953 films Category:1950s war films Category:American films Category:American war films Category:American black-and-white films Category:Cultural depictions of Erwin Rommel Category:North African campaign films Category:World War II films based on actual events Category:Films set in Libya Category:Films shot in California Category:20th Century Fox films Category:Films directed by Robert Wise Category:Films scored by Leigh Harline Category:Siege films ","title":"The Desert Rats (film)"},{"id":"6210584","text":"the castle Verrès (Valdôtain: ; Issime ) is a town and comune in the Aosta Valley region of north-western Italy near Verrès Castle and Cly Castle. ==References== Category:Cities and towns in Aosta Valley ","title":"Verrès"},{"id":"6210588","text":"Wilhelm Rust Wilhelm Rust (August 15, 1822 – May 2, 1892) was a German musicologist and composer.

It is located in the downtown area of the city at the intersection of Richards and Dunsmuir streets. The construction of the cathedral began in 1899 on the site of an earlier church by the same name. It opened on the Feast of the Immaculate Conception on December 8, 1900, was blessed the day after, and was consecrated in 1953. The style has been described as resembling the medieval Chartres Cathedral in France. The church was elevated to the status of cathedral in 1916. It is listed on the Vancouver Heritage Register and is a legally protected building. ==HistoryOriginal structure (1887–1899)=== The parish was established in June 1885 and Father Patrick Fay, the chaplain to Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) workers, was chosen as pastor. He officiated the first mass of the parish on the feast of Our Lady of the Rosary in the same year at an unknown location. Although masses were held in Blair's Hall and Keefer's Hall, it became apparent that a new and permanent church was necessary to cope with the growing number of parishioners, which consisted of 69 families. In order to pick a site for the new church, legend has it that Father Fay went to the Coal Harbour waterfront, looked south towards the forested land (present-day Downtown Vancouver) and chose the area that contained the tallest tree. Construction began in 1886 and the wooden church was completed and blessed in the following year. Two years later, the church was enlarged and a bell tower was added. ===Present-day cathedral=== With the rapid growth of Vancouver at the time, plans were made for a greater expansion of the church. Because Fay was transferred in 1892 and died shortly after, Father Eumellin succeeded him in overseeing the plan for construction from 1893 to 1897. Then, the new pastor of the church, Father James McGuckin, took over the project. By that time, the number of parishioners had outgrown the size of the church building. In order to fund the construction of the new church, the Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate (OMI) – the religious order McGuckin belonged to – mortgaged their headquarters in France, and before his death, Fay worked as a CPR foreman for a construction crew. Initially, parishioners and the OMI were skeptical of the project; the parish was already heavily in debt when McGuckin became pastor, the Catholic community in Vancouver – though \\"rapidly growing\\" – was still \\"relatively small\\" in number, and a friend of McGuckin who was a contractor was unable to provide the funds he had initially pledged. These problems culminated in the construction project being labelled \\"McGuckin's Folly\\". The original church circa 1889, featuring the newly built bell tower Despite these doubts, the cornerstone of the new church was laid on July 16, 1899, by Archbishop Adélard Langevin of Saint Boniface. Thomas Ennor Julian and H.J. Williams were hired to be the architects, and in just 491 days, the construction was completed. At the time it was finished, the building was praised as \\"the finest piece of architecture west of Toronto and north of San Francisco.\\" The new Church of Our Lady of the Holy Rosary opened on December 8, 1900 – the Feast of the Immaculate Conception – and was blessed one day later by Archbishop Alexander Christie of Portland, Oregon. By the end of the decade, it became \\"the most financially important parish\\" in the archdiocese, since it was the only church that not only could break-even, but could also churn out a surplus. Because of this, Archbishop Timothy Casey wanted to make the church the cathedral for the metropolitan see. The OMI were extremely reluctant to give up their church, and even attempted to give Casey money so that he could buy land elsewhere to build a new cathedral. Nonetheless, the church was elevated to the status of cathedral in 1916, but the Oblates were permitted to remain. The OMI – which administered the parish since 1893 – eventually left in 1927 after difficulties arose from the mortgage agreement that had helped pay for the construction of the cathedral. This was coupled with the \\"growing manpower shortage\\" caused by a declining number of members joining the order. Since a Catholic church can only be consecrated once it has become free from debt, the cathedral did not have its rite of consecration held until October 3, 1953, fifty-three years after it first opened. The ceremony – which commenced just after daybreak – was officiated by the Archbishop of Vancouver William M. Duke, with the subsequent solemn pontifical Mass celebrated by Michael Harrington, the Bishop of Kamloops. Approximately thirty-five bishops from across Canada and the United States attended the event, which coincided with Duke's golden and silver jubilees of his priestly ordination and consecration as a bishop, respectively. On October 7, 1952, the feast day of the cathedral's namesake, a gunman entered the church and fired a round from his rifle at the altar. No one was hurt and he was arrested shortly after. A minor tilt in the bell tower of the cathedral was detected in April 1959, probably due to the drilling and blasting of a nearby tunnel. Many significant events have taken place at the cathedral. In 1936, it hosted an archdiocesan-level Eucharistic Congress, the first congress ever to be celebrated in Western Canada. Forty-eight years later, in 1984, Pope John Paul II visited the church as part of his pastoral visit to Canada. In late September 2001, the cathedral became the first place in Canada to host the relics of Saint Thérèse of Lisieux during her reliquary's three-month-long tour of the country. Over the years, several notable people had their funeral requiem mass said at the cathedral, including beloved local lifeguard and swim instructor Joe Fortes (1922), Chief Dan George of the Tsleil-Waututh Nation (1981), and former Vancouver police commissioner William Cameron Murphy in 1961. The funeral of Fortes in February 1922 saw the cathedral filled to capacity, with thousands of others braving the rain and cold weather to view the funeral procession on the streets of Vancouver. Requiem masses were also held at the cathedral for popes Pius XI (1939) and John Paul II (2005), while an interfaith requiem was also held for former Governor General of Canada Georges Vanier in 1967. ==Architecture== altar and sanctuary of the cathedral The cathedral, built in a French Gothic style, is cruciform in the shape of the Latin cross. The exterior walls of the church were built from sandstone originating from Gabriola Island, while its foundations were made of granite. The two bell towers – which are asymmetric – have been labelled as the cathedral's \\"most prominent visual feature\\". The taller steeple was originally designed to have flying buttresses at the bottom. The interior features columns that support the nave which are made from red Scagliola marble. The cathedra is situated at the centre of the sanctuary, surrounded by an oak altar-piece and two towers of reredos. In total, the dimensions of the church building are long, wide and tall, with the taller steeple rising to . Over the years, the cathedral has undergone a series of renovations. In late 1932, the \\"tin scales\\" that covered spire of the taller steeple were cleaned and repaired, and the cross atop of it was repainted. The reordering of the sanctuary took place in the 1960s after the Second Vatican Council. Refurbishing also took place prior to Pope John Paul II's visit to the cathedral in 1984. The cathedral was completely re-roofed from 1995 to 1997, with zinc being utilized on the roof to resemble slate. In December 2002, some of the carpeting was removed and replaced with Italian ceramic tiles, and the inside of the church was repainted from 2004 to 2006. ===Bells=== When the cathedral was first built, seven bells – representing the sacraments – were cast at the Fonderie Paccard in Annecy-le- Vieux, Savoy, France and were blessed on October 21, 1900. However, they were soon found to be out of tune and were sent back to Europe, this time to a foundry near Bristol. This time, eight bells were made in order to complete an entire octave when rung. They were reinstalled in the cathedral in 1906 and operate on change ringing. They are one of the few peal of bells hung in the English style found in North America, and one of three in British Columbia – the others are located at Westminster Abbey in Mission and Victoria's Christ Church Cathedral. The bells were notably rung on Dominion Day in 1911 – the first peal ever to be rung in Canada – and on February 12, 2010, in honour of the opening of the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver. ===Organ=== The pipe organ was restored in 2000 and contains 2,899 pipes. The cathedral's pipe organ was originally built and inaugurated in the autumn of 1900. Manufactured by the Karn–Warren Organ Company in Woodstock, Ontario, the organ is the \\"oldest romantic-style organ\\" in the province \\"remaining in its original location\\". Over the years, the instrument's condition deteriorated due to \\"general wear and tear\\", shoddy repairs and water damage caused by the leaking roof. As a result, the organ was dismantled in 1999 and transported to Casavant Frères in Saint-Hyacinthe, Quebec. It was restored within two years and returned to the church, where it was blessed in Easter of 2000. In that same year, an organ concert series was hosted at the cathedral for the first time, and has been held annually since. ===Stained glass windows=== There are currently 21 stained glass windows at the cathedral. The most renowned ones are the five windows made by Canadian artist Guido Nincheri. They depict Our Lady of the Holy Rosary, the Baptism of Our Lord, Jesus Healing the Sick, Jesus with the Children and the Assumption. The window showing Our Lady of the Holy Rosary featured on Canada Post's annual Christmas stamp in 1997. Furthermore, the Institute for Stained Glass in Canada documented the stained glass windows at the cathedral. ===Sculpture of Homeless Jesus=== The sculpture Homeless Jesus of the Canadian Artist Timothy Schmalz A copy of the bronze sculpture Homeless Jesus by Canadian artist Timothy Schmalz was installed in front of the cathedral in the spring of 2017. It shows a life- size man with a long overcoat lying on a park bench. His face is hidden underneath a hood, and his bare feet have stigmata.Chandler Walter: 'Homeless Jesus' sculpture can be found at Holy Rosary Cathedral in Vancouver, Daily Hive, Calgary, 18 August 2017, retrieved on 24 January 2020 According to Stanley Galvon, the rector at the time, the statue is intended to be \\"a catalyst to make people think about\\" the city's homelessness crisis. ==Modern day== The cathedral made news in 2007, with the Vancouver Police Department having to be called in on a weekly basis; cathedral staff claimed they were \\"under siege\\" by panhandlers who frequented the building and who were involved in at least one incident daily. These revelations came to light when a homeless man mugged an 81-year-old parishioner in the cathedral on August 1 of that year and was caught on camera. On March 23, 2008, First Nations protesters disrupted an Easter Sunday Mass at the cathedral by demonstrating on the outside steps. They ordered the Church to \\"get off native land\\" and demanded that they disclose the burial locations of children who died in residential schools. A similar protest occurred on October 30, 2011, when a splinter group from the Occupy Vancouver movement marched to the cathedral from the Vancouver Art Gallery. They attempted to enter the cathedral and occupy it but were thwarted by Vancouver police officers and Knights of Columbus. Sunday Mass was celebrated without a congregation for the first time in the cathedral's history on March 22, 2020. This came as a result of the Archdiocese suspending all public masses starting from March 21 onwards, in response to the 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic. ==See also== *List of heritage buildings in Vancouver ==NotesReferencesFurther reading== * * ==External links== * Holy Rosary Cathedral * Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Vancouver Category:Churches in Vancouver Category:Gothic Revival architecture in Vancouver Category:Gothic Revival church buildings in Canada Category:Roman Catholic cathedrals in British Columbia Category:Heritage buildings in Vancouver ","title":"Holy Rosary Cathedral (Vancouver)"},{"id":"6210597","text":"Daharki () is a city in Ghotki District in the Sindh province of Pakistan.

When he defected to the United Kingdom in 1992 he brought the archive with him. The official historian of MI5, Christopher Andrew,\\"Just How Intelligent\\" The Guardian, February 18, 2003 wrote two books, The Sword and the Shield (1999) and The World Was Going Our Way: The KGB and the Battle for the Third World (2005), based on material in the archives. The books purport to provide details about many of the Soviet Union's clandestine intelligence operations around the world. In July 2014, the Churchill Archives Centre at Churchill College released Mitrokhin's edited Russian-language notes for public research. The original handwritten notes by Vasili Mitrokhin are still classified.KGB papers, kept secret since 1992, released by British archive ==Investigations after publication of the books== The publication of the books prompted parliamentary inquiries in the UK, Italy, and India.The Mitrokhin Inquiry Report ===UK inquiry=== After the first book (Andrew and Mitrokhin, The Sword and the Shield, 1999) was published in the UK, an inquiry was held by the House of Commons' Intelligence and Security Committee (ISC). Its findings, \\"The Mitrokhin Inquiry Report\\", were presented to Parliament in June 2000. The Committee expressed concern that the Secret Intelligence Service (MI6) knew the names of some spies years before the publication of the book, but took a decision, without informing the proper prosecuting authorities, not to prosecute them. This decision, ISC believed, was for the Law Officers to take, not the SIS. The ISC interviewed Mitrokhin. He was not content with the way the book was published, he told them, and felt he had not accomplished what he intended when writing the notes. He wished that he had retained \\"full control over the handling of his material\\". SIS stated that they were clearing the UK chapters with the Home Secretary and the Attorney General, as required before publication of the book, but, the Committee found, they did not do so. In addition, ISC thought, \\"misleading stories were allowed to receive wide circulation\\", and the Committee found that SIS had handled neither the publication nor related media matters appropriately. ===Italy inquiry=== In Italy, Silvio Berlusconi, who was Prime Minister at the time, established the Mitrokhin Commission in 2002 to investigate information about the KGB connections in Italy claimed in the Mitrokhin Archives. The Mitrokhin Commission ended in a scandal, and without evidence to tie any Italian politician.Slate, December 11, 2006 An Italian minister said that the archive \\"is not a dossier from the KGB but one about the KGB constructed by British counter-espionage agents based on the confession of an ex-agent, if there is one, and 'Mitrokhin' is just a codename for an MI5 operation.\\" ===India inquiry=== In India, a senior leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party, L. K. Advani, requested of the Government a white paper to file defamation suits against Christopher Andrew.\\"Advani seeks white paper on KGB charges\\", The Hindu, October 3, 2005. The spokesperson of the Indian Congress party referred to the book as \\"pure sensationalism not even remotely based on facts or records\\" and pointed out that the book is not based on official records from the Soviet Union. ==Origin of the notes== Vasili Nikitich Mitrokhin originally started his career with the First Chief Directorate of the KGB (Foreign Espionage) in Undercover operations. After Nikita Khrushchev's Secret Speech, Mitrokhin became critical of the existing KGB system and was transferred from Operations to the Archives. Over the years, Mitrokhin became increasingly disillusioned with the Soviet system, especially after the stories about the struggles of dissidents and the 1968 Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia, which led him to conclude that the Soviet system was un-reformable.\\"Christopher Andrew, \\"Vasili Mitrokhin\\", The Guardian, 4 February 2004. By the late 1960s, the KGB headquarters at the Lubyanka Building became increasingly overcrowded, and the Chairman of the KGB, Yuri Andropov, authorized the construction of a new building outside of Moscow in Yasenevo, which was to become the new headquarters of the First Chief Directorate and all Foreign Operations. Mitrokhin, who was by that time the head of the Archives department, was assigned by the director of the First Directorate, Vladimir Kryuchkov, with the task of cataloging the documents and overseeing their orderly transfer to the new headquarters. The transfer of the massive archive eventually took over 12 years, from 1972 to 1984.\\"\\", Los Angeles Times, 3 February 2004.Andrew, Mitrokhin Archive, p. 48–52. Unbeknownst to Kryuchkov and the KGB, while cataloging the documents, Mitrokin secretly took his own copies and immensely detailed notes of the documents which he smuggled to his dacha and hid under the floorboards. Mitrokhin made no attempt to contact any Western intelligence service during the Soviet Era. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union (in 1992) he traveled to Latvia with copies of material from the archive and walked into the American embassy in Riga. Central Intelligence Agency officers there did not consider him to be credible, concluding that the copied documents could be faked. He then went to the British embassy and a young diplomat there saw his potential. After a further meeting one month later with representatives of MI6, operations followed to retrieve the 25,000 pages of files hidden in his house, covering operations from as far back as the 1930s. ==Content of the notes== Notes in the Mitrokhin Archive claim that more than half of the Soviet Union's weapons are based on US designs, that the KGB tapped Henry Kissinger's telephone when he was US Secretary of State, and had spies in place in almost all US defense contractor facilities. The notes allege that some 35 senior politicians in France worked for the KGB during the Cold War. In West Germany, the KGB was said to have infiltrated the major political parties, the judiciary, and the police. Large-scale sabotage preparations were supposedly made against the US, Canada, and elsewhere in case of war, including hidden weapons caches; several have been removed or destroyed by police relying on Mitrokhin's information.KGB in Europe, 472–476 ===Prominent KGB spies named in the files=== * Melita Norwood (codenamed Hola), a British civil servant who had access to secrets while working at the British Non-Ferrous Metals Research AssociationUK House of Commons, Hansard Debates, 21 Oct 1999, Columns 587–594 * John Symonds (codenamed Scot),Andrew and Mitrokhin, The Mitrokhin Archive: The KGB in Europe and the West (London, 1999) pp. 559–563. a former Detective Sergeant at New Scotland Yard, who had left the UK under suspicion of corruption * Raymond Fletcher (codenamed Peter), a British journalist and subsequently MP; also alleged to have been recruited by the StB and the Central Intelligence AgencyAndrew, Mitrokhin Archive, p. 526–527. * Iosif Grigulevich, an NKVD assassin who, under the false identity Teodoro B.

For example, FSLN leader Carlos Fonseca Amador was described as \\"a trusted agent\\" in KGB files.The KGB in Europe, page 472–473. Quote: \\"Sandinista guerrillas formed the basis for a KGB sabotage and intelligence group established in 1966 on the Mexican US Border.\\"Hearings of the U.S. House of Representatives, 26 Oct 1999. Nikolai Leonov was Sub-Director of the Latin American Department of the KGB between 1968–1972. In 1998 he gave a lecture where he made statements that contradicted these claims. For instance he said that the KGB was not allowed to recruit members from Communist or other left wing parties. Daniel Ortega agreed to \\"unofficial meetings\\" with KGB officers. He gave Nikolai Leonov a secret program of the Sandinista movement (FSLN), which stated the FSLN's intent to lead class struggle in Central America, in alliance with Cuba and the Soviet bloc.The KGB and the Battle for the Third World, p. 121 However, Leonov stated that he became friends with many Latin Americans including some leaders, and that he and other Soviets supported the struggles of left wing groups. But he clarifies that he did not let people know that he was a KGB agent and that his relationships with them did not involve intelligence. ===Middle Eastern figures accused of being informants or agents of the KGB=== On September 2016, a work by two researchers (DR. I. Ginor and G. Remez) stated that Mahmoud Abbas (also known as 'Abu Mazen'), the President of the Palestinian National Authority, worked for the Soviet intelligence agency. According to a recently released document from the Mitrokhin Archive, entitled \\"KGB developments – Year 1983\\", Abbas apparently worked under the code name \\"Krotov\\", starting early 1980s. ===KGB operations revealed in the files=== * Blackmailing Tom Driberg (code-named Lepage), British MP and a member of the Executive Committee of the Labour Party in the 1950s. Driberg had spied on the Communist Party of Great Britain for MI5 in the 1930s. In 1956, while visiting Moscow to interview his old friend Guy Burgess for a biography, he was blackmailed by the KGB into removing references to Burgess's alcoholism, due to their having photos of him in a homosexual encounter.Andrew, Mitrokhin Archive, p. 522–526. * Attempts to increase racial hatred in the US by mailing forged hate letters to militant groupsAndrew & Mitrokhin, The Mitrokhin Archive: The KGB in Europe and the West (London, 1999) pp. 310–311. * Bugging MI6 stations in the Middle EastAndrew, The KGB in Europe, p. 443. * Bugging Henry Kissinger when he was serving as United States Secretary of StateAndrew, The KGB in Europe, pp. 451–453. * Obtaining documents from defense contractors including Boeing, Fairchild, General Dynamics, IBM, and Lockheed Corporation, providing the Soviets with detailed information about the Trident and Peacekeeper ballistic missiles and Tomahawk cruise missilesAndrew, The KGB in Europe, p. 454. * Supporting the Sandinista movement. The leading role in this operation belonged to the General Intelligence Directorate of Communist Cuba.KGB in Europe, pages 503–505 *KGBs direct link to Prime Minister of India, Indira Gandhi (code-named Vano). \\"Suitcases full of banknotes were said to be routinely taken to the Prime Minister's house.

Patil is reported to have said that Mrs. Gandhi did not even return the suitcases\\".Andrew & Mitrokhin, The Mitrokhin Archive II- The KGB and the World, The Special Relationship With India: Part I, p. 311-312. Systematic control of the Indian Media was also revealed- \\"According to KGB files, by 1973 it had ten Indian newspapers on its payroll (which cannot be identified for legal reasons) as well as a press agency under its control.65 During 1972 the KGB claimed to have planted 3,789 articles in Indian newspapers - probably more than in any other country in the non-Communist world. According to its files, the number fell to 2,760 in 1973 but rose to 4,486 in 1974 and 5,510 in 1975.66 In some major NATO countries, despite active-measures campaigns, the KGB was able to plant little more than 1 per cent of the articles which it placed in the Indian press\\"Andrew & Mitrokhin, The Mitrokhin Archive II- The KGB and the World, The Special Relationship With India: Part I, p. 323. ===Accused but unconfirmed=== * Richard Clements, journalist and editor of the Tribune, and later an advisor to Michael Foot and Neil Kinnock as leaders of the British Labour Party. Clements was not named in Andrew and Mitrokhin's book in 1999, but an article in The Sunday Times made the allegation that he was the unidentified agent of influence codenamed DAN.Rufford and Penrose, 'KGB Claims Kinnock Aide Was Agent Dan', The Sunday Times, September 19, 1999 According to the Mitrokhin Archive, DAN disseminated Soviet propaganda in his articles in the Tribune, from his recruitment in 1959 until he severed contact with the KGB in the 1970s.Andrew and Mitrokhin, The Mitrokhin Archive, pages 529 and 555 Clements denied the allegation, saying that it was an over-inflated claim and \\"complete nonsense\\", and that the allegation was not subsequently repeated.'Richard Clements' (Obituary), The Times, November 28, 2006 Those defending Clements against the charges included David Winnick and Andrew Roth.Audrey Gillan, \\"Ex- Editor dismisses spy claim\\", The Guardian, September 20, 1999 * Romano Prodi (see Italian Mitrokhin Commission). ===Disinformation campaign against the United States=== Andrew described the following active measures by the KGB against the United States:Christopher Andrew and Vasili Mitrokhin (2000).

The story was spread by Russian-born biologist Jakob Segal.KGB in Europe, pages 318–319 ===Installation and support of communist governments=== According to Mitrokhin's notes, Soviet security organizations played key roles in establishing puppet Communist governments in Eastern Europe and Afghanistan. Their strategy included mass political repressions and establishing subordinate secret police services at the occupied territories. The KGB director Yuri Andropov took suppression of anti-Communist liberation movements personally. In 1954, he became the Soviet Ambassador to Hungary, and was present during the 1956 Hungarian Revolution. After these events, Andropov had a \\"Hungarian complex\\": Andropov played a key role in crushing the Hungarian Revolution. He convinced reluctant Nikita Khrushchev that military intervention was necessary.The KGB in Europe, p. 327. He convinced Imre Nagy and other Hungarian leaders that the Soviet government had not ordered an attack on Hungary while the attack was beginning. The Hungarian leaders were arrested and Nagy was executed. During the Prague Spring events in Czechoslovakia, Andropov was a vigorous proponent of \\"extreme measures\\". He ordered the fabrication of false intelligence not only for public consumption, but also for the Soviet Politburo. \\"The KGB whipped up the fear that Czechoslovakia could fall victim to NATO aggression or to a coup.\\" At that moment, Soviet intelligence officer Oleg Kalugin reported from Washington that he had gained access to \\"absolutely reliable documents proving that neither CIA nor any other agency was manipulating the Czechoslovak reform movement.\\" But, Kalugin's messages were destroyed because they contradicted the conspiracy theory fabricated by Andropov.The KGB in Europe, page 334–335. Andropov ordered many active measures, collectively known as operation PROGRESS, against Czechoslovak reformers.The KGB in Europe, page 328. ===Assassinations attempts and plots=== * Attempted poisoning of the second President of Afghanistan Hafizullah Amin on 13 December 1979. Department 8 of KGB succeeded in infiltrating illegal agent Mitalin Talybov (codenamed SABIR) into the presidential palace as a chef. However, Amin switched his food and drink (as if he expected to be poisoned), and his son-in-law became seriously ill; he was flown to a hospital in Moscow.The World Was Going Our Way: The KGB and the Battle for the Third World, pages 400-402 The poison was manufactured in the secret KGB laboratory which had prepared ricin for the attack on Bulgarian writer Georgi Markov in London in 1978. * Preparations to assassinate Josip Broz Tito, the president of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. In the late 1940s, the same KGB laboratory manufactured a powdered plague for use by an assassin who had been vaccinated against plague.KGB in Europe, pages 464–466Vadim J. Birstein.

Delta (2000) This assassination was prepared by the famous KGB agent Iosef Grigulevich, who had previously organized the assault on Leon Trotsky's villa in Mexico.KGB in Europe, pp. 114–115 However, Grigulevich was recalled at the last moment, due to the sudden death of Joseph Stalin. * In 1962, plans to assassinate several \\"particularly dangerous traitors,\\" including Anatoliy Golitsyn, Igor Gouzenko, Nikolay Khokhlov, and Bohdan Stashynsky were approved by the KGB head Vladimir Semichastny.KGB in Europe, pages 477–478 Khoklov was poisoned by radioactive thallium, allegedly due to his refusal to work as a KGB assassin and kill George Okolovich, chairman of the National Alliance of Russian Solidarists.KGB in Europe, pages 466–467 ===Penetration of churches=== The book describes establishing the \\"Moscow Patriarchate\\" on order from Stalin in 1943 as a front organization for the NKVD, and later, for the KGB.KGB in Europe, pages 634–661 All key positions in the Church, including bishops, were approved by the Ideological Department of CPSU and by the KGB. The priests were used as agents of influence in the World Council of Churches and in front organizations such as World Peace Council, Christian Peace Conference, and the Rodina (\\"Motherland\\") Society founded by the KGB in 1975. The future Russian Patriarch Alexius II said that Rodina was created to \\"maintain spiritual ties with our compatriots\\" and to help organize them. According to the archive, Alexius worked for the KGB as agent DROZDOV, and received an honorary citation from the agency for a variety of services.The vice-president of Rodina was P.I. Vasilyev, a senior officer of the Nineteenth (Soviet emigré) department of the First Chief Directorate of the KGB. KGB in Europe, page 650.) ===Support of international Liberation Movements=== The Andrew and Mitrokhin publications briefly describe the history of the PLO leader, Yasser Arafat, who established close collaboration with the Romanian Securitate service and the KGB in the early 1970s.The KGB and the Battle for the Third World, pages 250–253 The KGB provided secret training for PLO guerrillas.The KGB and the Battle for the Third World, page 145 However, the main KGB activities and arms shipments were channeled through Wadie Haddad of the PFLP organization, who usually stayed in a KGB dacha BARVIKHA-1 during his visits to the Soviet Union. Led by Carlos the Jackal, a group of PFLP fighters carried out a spectacular raid on the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries office in Vienna in 1975. Advance notice of this operation \\"was almost certainly\\" given to the KGB. Many notable operations are alleged to have been conducted by the KGB to support international terrorists with weapons on the orders from the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, including: * Transfer of about one hundred machine-guns, automatic rifles, Walther pistols, and cartridges to the Marxist Official Irish Republican Army by the Soviet intelligence vessel Reduktor (operation SPLASH) in 1972, supposedly to fulfill a personal request for arms from Cathal Goulding, relayed through Irish Communist Party leader Michael O'Riordan. He has denied the allegations.KGB in Europe, page 502 * Transfer of anti-tank grenade RPG-7 launchers, radio-controlled SNOP mines, pistols with silencers, machine guns, and other weaponry to the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine through Wadi Haddad, who was recruited as a KGB agent in 1970 (operation VOSTOK, \\"East\\").The operation was personally approved by Leonid Brezhnev in 1970. The weapons were delivered by the KGB vessel Kursograf. KGB in Europe, pp. 495–498 ==Italian Mitrokhin Commission== In 2002, the Italian Parliament, then led by Silvio Berlusconi's right-wing coalition, the Casa delle Libertà, created a commission, presided over by Senator Paolo Guzzanti (Forza Italia) to investigate alleged KGB ties to opposition figures in Italian politics. The commission was shut down in 2006 without having developed any new concrete evidence beyond the original information in the Mitrokhin Archive.\\"Spy expert at centre of storm\\", The Guardian, 2 December 2006 However, former FSB officer Alexander Litvinenko said that he had been informed by FSB deputy chief, General Anatoly Trofimov (who was shot dead in Moscow in 2005), that \\"Romano Prodi is our man [in Italy]\\".The Litvinenko murder: Scaramella - The Italian Connection , by Lauren Veevers, The Independent A British Member of the European Parliament for London, Gerard Batten of United Kingdom Independence Party, demanded a new inquiry into the allegations. ==Preparations for large-scale sabotage in the West== Notes in the archive describe extensive preparations for large-scale sabotage operations against the United States, Canada, and Europe in the event of war, although none was recorded as having been carried out, beyond creating weapons and explosives caches in assorted foreign countries.The KGB in Europe, page 472–476 This information has been corroborated in general by GRU defectors, Victor SuvorovVictor Suvorov, Spetsnaz, 1987, Hamish Hamilton Ltd, and Stanislav Lunev.Stanislav Lunev. Through the Eyes of the Enemy: The Autobiography of Stanislav Lunev, Regnery Publishing, Inc., 1998. The operations included the following: * A plan for sabotage of Hungry Horse Dam in Montana.The KGB in Europe, page 473 * A detailed plan to destroy the port of New York (target GRANIT). The most vulnerable points of the port were determined and recorded on maps. * Large arms caches were hidden in many countries to support such planned terrorism acts. Some were booby-trapped with \\"Lightning\\" explosive devices. One such cache, identified by Mitrokhin, was found by Swiss authorities in the woods near Fribourg. Several other caches in Europe were removed successfully.The KGB in Europe, page 475–476 A KGB radio equipment cache was found in woods outside of Brussels, Belgium in 1999. * Disruption of the power supply across New York State by KGB sabotage teams, which were to be based along the Delaware River in Big Spring Park. * An \\"immensely detailed\\" plan to destroy \\"oil refineries and oil and gas pipelines across Canada from British Columbia to Montreal\\" (operation \\"Cedar\\") was prepared; the work took twelve years to complete.The KGB in Europe, page 473–474 ==Reception and reviews== The historian Joseph Persico wrote that \\"several of the much-publicized revelations [from the book], however, hardly qualify as such. For instance, the authors tell how the K.G.B. forged a letter from Lee Harvey Oswald to E. Howard Hunt, the former C.I.A. officer and later Watergate conspirator, in order to implicate the C.I.A. in the Kennedy assassination. Actually, this story surfaced in Henry Hurt's Reasonable Doubt, written 13 years ago. Similarly, the story that the K.G.B. considered schemes for breaking the legs of the ballet dancer Rudolf Nureyev for defecting to the West was first reported in a book written six years ago.\\" And he added that \\"it does seem odd that a key K.G.B. archivist never had access to a copying machine, but had to copy thousands of pages in longhand. Still, the overall impact of this volume is convincing, though none of the material will send historians scurrying to rewrite their books.\\"Joseph E. Persico, Secrets From the Lubyanka - \\"The Sword and the Shield\\" Review, New York Times, 31 October 1999 The Central European Review described Mitrokhin and Andrew's work as \\"fascinating reading for anyone interested in the craft of espionage, intelligence gathering and its overall role in 20th-century international relations,\\" offering \\"a window on the Soviet worldview and, as the ongoing Hanssen case in the United States clearly indicates, how little Russia has relented from the terror-driven spy society it was during seven inglorious decades of Communism.Stout, Robert. Central European Review. Vol 3, No 18. 21 May 2001.\\" David L. Ruffley, from the Department of International Programs, United States Air Force Academy, said that the material \\"provides the clearest picture to date of Soviet intelligence activity, fleshing out many previously obscure details, confirming or contradicting many allegations and raising a few new issues of its own\\" and \\"sheds new light on Soviet intelligence activity that, while perhaps not so spectacular as some expected, is nevertheless significantly illuminating.David L. Ruffley, \\"Review of Christopher Andrew and Vasili Mitrokhin, The Sword and the Shield: The Mitrokhin Archive and the Secret History of the KGB\\" , History Net, April 2002\\" Reg Whitaker, a professor of Political Science at York University in Toronto, gave a review at the Intelligence Forum about the book where he wrote that \\"The Mitrokhin Archive arrives from a cache under a Russian dacha floor, courtesy of the British intelligence community itself, and its chosen historian, Chris Andrew\\" and that the book \\"is remarkably restrained and reasonable in its handling of Westerners targeted by the KGB as agents or sources. The individuals outed by Mitrokhin appear to be what he says they were, but great care is generally taken to identify those who were unwitting dupes or, in many instances, uncooperative targets. Jack Straw (then Home Secretary) stated to the British Parliament in 1999: \\"In 1992, after Mr. Mitrokhin had approached the UK for help, our Secret Intelligence Service made arrangements to bring Mr. Mitrokhin and his family to this country, together with his archive. As there were no original KGB documents or copies of original documents, the material itself was of no direct evidential value, but it was of huge value for intelligence and investigative purposes. Thousands of leads from Mr. Mitrokhin's material have been followed up worldwide. As a result, our intelligence and security agencies, in co-operation with allied Governments, have been able to put a stop to many security threats. Many unsolved investigations have been closed; many earlier suspicions confirmed; and some names and reputations have been cleared. Our intelligence and security agencies have assessed the value of Mr. Mitrokhin's material world wide as immense.Commons Hansard Debates 21 Oct 1999 : Column 587\\" The author Joseph Trento commented that \\"we know the Mitrokhin material is real because it fills in the gaps in Western files on major cases through 1985. Also, the operational material matches western electronic intercepts and agent reports. What MI6 got for a little kindness and a pension was the crown jewels of Russian intelligence.Joseph John Trento, The Secret History Of The CIA, pp. 474–475\\" Scholar Amy Knight said that \\"While The Sword and the Shield contains new information ... none of it has much significance for broader interpretations of the Cold War. The main message the reader comes away with after plowing through almost a thousand pages is the same one gleaned from the earlier books: the Soviets were incredibly successful, albeit evil, spymasters, and none of the Western services could come close to matching their expertise.

It is one of the most famous manors of the region, and is located on the right bank of the Dora Baltea at the centre of the inhabited area of Issogne. As a seigniorial residence of the Renaissance, the Castle has quite a different look from that of the austere Verrès Castle, which is located in Verrès, on the opposite bank of the river. Issogne Castle is most noteworthy for its fountain in the form of pomegranate tree and its highly decorated portico, a rare example of medieval Alpine painting, with its frescoed cycle of scenes of daily life from the late Middle Ages. ==HistoryMiddle ages=== The earliest mention of the castle of Issogne is in a Papal bull issued by Pope Eugene III in 1151, which refers to a fortified building at Issogne, the property of the Bishop of Aosta. Some walling discovered in the cellars of the current castle may be evidence of a Roman villa, dating from the 1st century BC, on the site. Tensions between the Bishop of Aosta and the De Verrecio family, lords of the nearby town of Verrès, reached boiling point around 1333, when the castle of Issogne, the episcopal seat, was attacked and damaged by fire. Issogne remained the seat of the bishop until 1379, when the bishop of Aosta submitted to the jurisdiction of the then lord of Verrès, Yblet of Challant. Ibleto transformed the episcopal stronghold into an elegant princely residence in Gothic style, with a series of towers and buildings enclosed by an encircling wall. When Yblet died in 1409, the feud and castle of Issogne passed to his son Francis of Challant (French: François de Challant), who in 1424 received the title of Count of Challant from the Duke of Savoy. Francesco died in 1442, leaving no male heir. A long succession struggle between Francesco's daughter Catherine of Challant and her cousin James of Challant-Aymavilles (French: Jacques de Challant-Aymavilles) was won by James, who thus became the second Count of Challant and the new lord of Issogne. ===Renaissance=== From about 1480, further alterations were made to the Castle by James's son Luigi di Challant, and continued after his death in 1487 by his cousin, the prior George of Challant-Varey (French: Georges de Challant-Varey), to whom James's wife Marguerite de la Chambre had granted custody of his sons Philibert and Charles. George had new wings erected to connect the already existing buildings, unifying the complex into a single horseshoe shape surrounding a central courtyard. The decorations of the portico and the celebrated pomegranate fountain date to this period. The Castle hosted many illustrious guests, including the future emperor Sigismund of Luxemburg as he returned to Germany in 1414, and King Charles VIII of France in 1494. Work on the Castle ended with the death of George of Challant in 1509. Philibert of Challant became the new lord of Issogne, and made the Castle a residence for himself, his wife Louise d'Aarberg and his son René of Challant, under whom the Castle reached its greatest splendour and hosted a rich and refined court. ===Decline and rebirth=== Renato di Challant left no male heir at his death in 1565. His possessions passed to Giovanni Federico Madruzzo, husband of René's daughter Isabelle, giving rise to an inheritance dispute between the Madruzzo family and Isabelle's cousins of the Challant family that lasted for more than a century. The lordship of Issogne and its Castle passed from the Madruzzo family to the Lenoncourt family, then in 1693 to Cristina Maurizia Del Carretto di Balestrina, and was finally returned to the Challant family in 1696. In 1802, the last count of Challant, Giulio Giacinto, died, and the Challant family was extinguished. The Castle, already abandoned for some years, fell into decay and its furniture was removed. In 1872 the owner of the Castle, Baron Marius de Vautheleret, was forced to sell it at auction. It was acquired by the Turin painter Vittorio Avondo, who restored it, furnishing it with some of its original furniture bought back from the antique market, and with copies of furniture of the period. Avondo donated the Castle to the Italian state in 1907; in 1948 it passed to the Aosta Valley region. The Castle may be visited by guided tour. ==Interior of the Castle== From the exterior, the Castle looks like a fortified residence of fairly unprepossessing appearance, without any particular decoration, with angular turrets a little higher than the rest of the building. The Castle is situated at the centre of the inhabited area of Issogne. The Castle was built to a quadrangular plan, three sides of which are occupied by the building and the fourth, oriented towards the south, comprises an Italian Garden, enclosed within a surrounding wall. ===The courtyard and portico=== The internal courtyard, enclosed within the three sides of the building, and the garden form one of the most interesting spaces of the Castle. At one time, one reached this space by passing from the countryside through principal gate and under a portico. Today, for practical reasons, the secondary entrance on the west side is used. This entrance faces an expansive field. On the facades that face the courtyard, one finds the so-called \\"Miroir pour les infants de Challant\\", a series of frescoed heraldic arms that show the diverse branches of the Challant family and the principal matrimonial alliances of the house. The \\"miroir\\" was created in order to preserve a record of the family history and to transmit it to future generations. The surrounding wall of the garden, on the other hand, was decorated with monochromatic images of legends and heroes of antiquity, now unfortunately almost entirely obliterated. At the centre of the courtyard, one finds the celebrated 'pomegranate fountain'. From the octagonal stone bowl of the fountain emerges a pomegranate tree made of wrought iron from which jets of water are sprayed. Strangely, although the fruit of the tree is clearly to be understood as that of the pomegranate the leaves, perhaps for symbolic reasons intended by the artist, are those of another tree - the oak. George of Challant probably had the fountain constructed as a wedding gift for the wedding of his favourite, Philibert of Challant, when Philibert married Louise d'Aarberg in 1502. It appears that the tree is to be read symbolically as the expression of the desire to unite the fertility and unity of the family represented by the pomegranate, with its seed-filled fruit, with the strength and antiquity signified by the oak. Amongst the branches of the pomegranate-oak, and somewhat difficult to discern, tiny dragons have been inserted. The east side of the courtyard is occupied by the portico with its round arches and cross-vaults. The principal entrance of the Castle opens onto this portico and the interior of the building is nowadays also reached from this portico. The geometric decoration of the ribbing of the cross-vaults is typical of the rate of the fifteenth century. The lunettes of the portico are decorated with frescoes giving realistic and humorous depictions of scenes daily life and the trades of the period. They represent an important iconographic testament to life between the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. The 'lunette of the guard house' shows some soldiers, accompanied by some prostitutes, seated at a table and intent on playing cards or tric-trac. Their weapons and armour (including cuirasses, crossbows and halberds) are hung up on a rack attached to the wall. In the 'lunette of the bakery', recently kneaded bread is being pushed into an oven; a butcher turns meat on a spit while a cat tries to steal it from him. In the 'lunette of the tailor's shop', pieces of cloth are measured and cut, while on the shelves of the rear of the apothecary's shop, numerous jars of herbs and other medicines are shown. The 'lunette of the market' shows a fruit and vegetable market busy with numerous customers and vendors dressed in costumes of the period. Lastly, in the 'lunette of the small goods seller's shop', some forms of the typical Fontina cheese are shown; these are considered to the oldest representations of this cheese. Besides their æsthetic function, these frescoes probably have a celebratory function, and are probably intended to show the abundance and peace obtained in the region thanks to the leadership of the lord of the Castle. The entire cycle has been attributed to an artist known as 'maître Colin' due to a graffito in the 'lunette of the guard house' that identifies 'Magister Collinus' as the author of the work. The same artist is known as the author of some paintings in the chapel on the first floor of the Castle. ===The ground floor=== The Castle comprises a total of about fifty rooms, although only about ten of them may visited with the guided tour. A door in the portico leads to the dining room, roofed by a vault and furnished with nineteenth-century furniture that Vittorio Avondo had made on the basis of Renaissance models. The dining room was joined to the kitchen by means of a service-hatch. The kitchen is divided into two parts by a wooden grate, creating two distinct spaces probably originally intended for the preparation of different types of food. The larger space, adjacent to the dining room, is provided with a large fireplace and an oven, while the smaller part includes a fireplace of smaller dimensions and a sink. On the northern side, next to the staircase that leads to the second floor, one finds the so-called 'hall of justice' or 'lower halls', the principal presentation space of the Castle. It is a large hall on a rectangular plan, with the walls completely covered in a fresco of a fictive loggia with columns of marble, alabaster and transparent crystal. Scenes of the hunt, courtly life and northern landscapes are represented. The cycle of decoration culminates with the judgement of Paris, in which the commissioner of the work, George of Challant, is actually represented as Paris. The frescoes of this hall, probably completed before the death of George of Challant in 1509, have been attributed to the Master of Wuillerine, an artist thought to have been of the Franco-Flemish school, as may be deduced from the presence in the landscapes of houses with sharply- pitched roofs and windmills of the type typical in northern Europe. The Master of Wuillerine is also the author of an \\"ex voto\\" for the collegiate church of Saint Ursus at Aosta. The ceiling is of wood with the trusses left exposed. Placed along the walls on the long sides of the hall are placed carved wooden stalls, nineteenth-century recreations of the late-Gothic originals conserved in the Turin City Museum of Ancient Art. The rear wall of the hall is pierced by a large stone fireplace decorated by a griffin and a lion that hold the arms of the Challant family aloft. The other rooms of the ground floor, which may not be visited, house the dispensary of the Castle, service rooms for the use of the kitchen (including a small goods store), the prisoner, the room reserved for the use of pilgrims, and rooms for the falconer, the guards, as well as other service rooms. ===The first floor=== The first floor of the Castle contains the rooms of the lords of the manor. They were also adapted by Vittorio Avondo when he acquired the Castle in the 19th century to his own personal use. One reaches this floor by means of a stone spiral staircase adjoining the 'hall of justice'. The same spiral staircase also provides access to the rooms of the ground floor as well as directly to the courtyard. The staircase if formed from a series of stone steps of trapezoidal shape. The wider part of the step is immured into the wall and the narrower part finished with a cylindrical element. Overlapping vertically in a series of steps, these cylindrical elements form a central column that give the staircase a significant static strength. The ceiling of the ramp is created by leaving the lower surface of the upper steps exposed, thus giving the appearance of a continuous ribbon that draws one on as one ascends the staircase. One of the first rooms that one encounters as one climbs the staircase is the so-called 'chamber of Marguerite de la Chambre'. This was the private room first of Marguerite de la Chambre, wife of Luigi of Challant, and then of Mencia de Bragança, the wife of René of Challant. The room is covered by a wooden ceiling with exposed trusses. At the top of the wall, and located in the spaces between the exposed trusses, a frieze showing Marguerite's arms can be found. The furnishings of the room include a large stone fireplace and a canopied bed, a nineteenth-century copy of an original to be found in the Ussel Castle. Next to the bedchamber can be found the private oratory of Marguerite de la Chambre, a small square room covered by a cross vault. This oratory is entirely covered in fresco, with scenes showing the Assumption of the Virgin, the martyrdom of St Catherine and St Margaret. One of these frescoes shows Marguerite herself praying in the company of her two daughters- in-law and her three sons. The entire cycle was repainted in 1936. Next to Marguerite's room, and accessible either through it or by means of the staircase, is the large rectangular hall covered with a wooden ceiling called the 'chambre de Savoie' (the Savoy Chamber) in the inventory compiled at the death of Renato di Challant in 1565. At the back of this hall there is a large stone fireplace upon which are depicted the arms of the Savoy family, after which the room was originally named, and the united arms of the Challand and La Palud families, brought together by virtue of the wedding of Amadeus of Challant-Varey and Anne de La Palud, parents of the Prior George of Challant. The furnishings of this room reflect its organisation in the nineteenth century by Vittorio Avondo, who displayed his collection of antique arms and armour him; for this reason, the room has been called the 'hall of arms'. Completing the furnishing of the room is a series of pieces of furniture that are nineteenth-century copies of Late Gothic originals. The last space that may be visited on the first floor is the chapel, situated in the eastern wing of the Castle, above the portico of the courtyard. This is a long and narrow room, covered by a series of cross-vaults that divide the space into five bays. A wooden railing divides the room into two spaces, thus probably separating the lords of the manner from their services. The wooden stalls in this room, placed against the wall, are nineteenth-century copies that Vittorio Avondo had made, while the winged altar is original to the Castle, having been made at the start of the sixteenth century. Avondo bought this altar back on the antique market after it had been sold by the previous proprietors of the manor. The wings of the polyptych and the frescoes of the chapel, showing scenes of the Nativity, the Prophets, the Apostles and the Doctors of the Church, have been attributed to Maître Colin, the same artist who created the lunettes of the portico in the courtyard and who had worked on the decoration of the collegiate church of Saint Ursus in Aosta, of which George of Challant was prior. Among the spaces that cannot be visited on the guided tour there are the private rooms of René of Challant, of his daughters Philiberte and Isabelle, of Cardinal Cristoforo Madruzzo (uncle of Giovanni Federico Madruzzo, the husband of Isabella di Challant) and their antechambers and access spaces. ===The second floor=== The second floor is reached by continuing to ascend the stone spiral staircase. Corresponding to the rooms of Marguerite de la Chambre we find those spaces reserved to George of Challant. One of George's rooms, also known as the 'Chambre de Saint Maurice'La Veillà du Val d'Aoste because of the coffered ceiling, the coffers of which contain the cross of the Order of Cavaliers of Saint Maurice, is furnished in a way corresponding to the furnishings of Marguerite's room underneath it. The room features a canopied bed of the sixteenth century and a credenza and a commode made in the nineteenth century at the direction of Avondo but in the late Gothic style. The room is warmed by a large stone fireplace decorated with the arms of George of Challant upheld by a griffin and a lion. From the room of George of Challant, one enters his private oratory, located again in correspondence to that of Marguerite. This, too, is a small space on a quadrangular plan, covered with a cross vault and completely frescoed. The frescoes, the work of the same anonymous Northern artist who decorated Marguerite's chapel, show the scene of the crucifixion, a pietà, and the entombment of Christ. George, the commissioner of the work, is depicted kneeling at the foot of the cross. As with many other paintings in the manor, the frescoes of George's oratory were repainted during a restoration in 1936. From the principal staircase, one reaches the so-called 'Hall of the King of France', situated next to the rooms of George of Challant and over the 'hall of arms'. Its name would seem to have derived from probably having been the room in which Charles VIII of France stayed during his passage through Italy in 1494. In the sixteenth century, this was the wedding chamber of René of Challant and his wife Mencia. The room is covered by a coffered ceiling and is warmed by a fireplace decorated with the lilies of the royal arms of France. The room is furnished with furniture in part bought back by Avondo, as for example the canopied bed with the arms of the Challant-Aymavilles branch acquired from a peasant in Ussel, and in part by nineteenth-century reconstructions. Passing through the room of the King of France and through a series of access rooms, one reaches the 'Chamber of the Tower', situated in the north-west corner of the manor in the most ancient part of the Castle. The different windows of the room permitted a view of the Castles of Arnad and Verrès as well as of the Villa Castle in Challand. This space was probably used as a signalling tower. In case of danger, the lords of manor would have been able to take securer refuge in the more easily defended Verrès Castle. To reach the last room that can be visited on this floor, it is necessary to pass through a loggia covered with a cross vault. This last room is located at the south-west extremity of the Castle. In an inventory of 1565, it is called the 'Chamber of the Emperor', probably in honour of the stay of the Emperor Sigismond of Luxemburg in 1414. The room is now called the 'Chamber of the Little Countess' in honour of the countess Isabelle of Challant, the daughter of René of Challant and Mencia de Bragança. It is furnished with a sixteenth- century bed of Tyrolese origin, reconstructed furniture commissioned by Avondo in the nineteenth century and a stone fireplace decorated with the arms of George of Challant. In the eastern wing of the Castle, which may not be visited, one finds a loggia roofed with a cross vault and positioned in a location corresponding to the chapel, some rooms and access spaces, and the stairs that lead to the roof of the castle. According to a legend, the ghost of Bianca Maria Gaspardone would appear on the roof on moonlit nights. Gaspardone was the first wife of René of Challant. Gaspardone abandoned her marriage René after only some months, having become tired of the long absences of her husband. She was subsequently condemned to death for procuring the assassination of her former lover Ardizzino Valperga by Don Pietro di Cardona, her then current lover; she was executed at Milan in 1526. Fernando Neri, Storia e Poesia (Torino: Chiantore, 1944), Chapter 3 ‘La Contessa di Challant’, pp. 87–88. ===The graffiti=== One of the characteristic features of the Issogne Castle, apart from the famous frescoes and the pomegranate fountain, is the numerous graffiti that have been left in the course of centuries by visitors to and guests of the Castle, the servants and lords of the manor themselves. These graffiti have been preserved because the Castle has never undergone major change, and they provide valuable evidence about daily life in the Castle. These graffiti, usually incised on the walls, are present throughout the Castle but in particular are visible in the portico of the courtyard, in the corridors, and in the embrasures of the doors and windows. The graffiti are mostly in French or Latin, and amongst them one finds visitors' reflections on how sad or happy they are to be leaving the Castle, a great number about life or money, confessions of being in love, and mocking jibes. The frescoed lunettes of the portico show, in addition to the signature of the painter Master Colin, comments on one or other of the professions depicted, while in the gallery that leads from the 'Chamber of the Little Countess', one may read an epitaph for the death of Count René de Challant ('XI julii 1565/obiit Renatus/comes de Challant', i.e. 'On the 11th of July 1565, René, count of Challant, died') and expressions of sadness on the occasion of the anniversary of that date. ==ReferencesInternal links== *George of Challant ==External links== * Issogne Castle - Aosta Valley Tourism Office official website Category:Houses completed in 1509 Category:Castles in Aosta Valley Category:Buildings and structures in Aosta Valley Category:Museums in Aosta Valley Category:Historic house museums in Italy ","title":"Issogne Castle"},{"id":"6210666","text":"\\"Die Zeiger der Uhr\\" (\\"The Hands of Time\\") was the German entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 1966, performed in German by Margot Eskens.

Bettmann is considered to have \\"virtually invented the image resource business.\\"100 Years of Bettmann ==Biography== Bettmann was born in Leipzig, Germany to Hans Isidor, who was an orthopedic surgeon and physician, and Charlotte Bettman.Csoma, Jessica and Lana Thompson. \\"Otto Bettmann.\\" In Immigrant Entrepreneurship: German-American Business Biographies, 1720 to the Present, vol. 5, edited by R. Daniel Wadhwani. German Historical Institute. Last modified November 21, 2014. His parental home was across the road from the Thomaskirche, the church where Johann Sebastian Bach worked as cantor and music director from 1723-50. As a child of Jewish parents, he was unaware that going to a synagogue on Friday and singing the praises of Christ on Sunday was somewhat unusual and continued to participate until his voice changed. His musical talent not limited to voice, he studied piano from the age of six. That discipline lasted his entire life, allowing him at age ninety-three, to still play Bach's Art of Fugue. He had wanted to be a doctor like his father but his brother Ernest already was being groomed for that profession. Without the support of his father, it would be impossible and his father had told him many times that one doctor in the family would be enough. In 1921, he enrolled in the University of Leipzig and studied history, German literature, and philosophy. At that time a university education consisted of spending time at a number of schools. Otto went to Freiburg for two years then returned to Leipzig to complete his dissertation. His title, \\"The Emergence of Professional Ethics in the German Book Trade of the Eighteenth Century\\" addressed the issue of copyright legislation. In retrospect this thesis became the raison d'être of his life and his claim to posterity. After university, he was fortunate to work for a family friend, Henri Hinrichsen, the owner of a music publishing company, C.F. Peters. Looking forward to expanding his business, Hinrichsen planned to open an office in the United States and Otto thought he would manage that branch but was told that he was not aggressive enough to handle the work. Otto quit and moved to Berlin and, in 1929, wrote his first book, Staat und Menschheit (State and Humanity). Other than the cultural stimulation and excitement of a new independent life, he felt the need to prepare himself for a more stable life and he returned to Leipzig to matriculate in library school. One year later, he had his degree and with that security in hand, made his way back to Berlin. There he worked in the Hunst Bibliothek in charge of the Griesebach collection. Part of this collection was locked in a cabinet because it contained Japanese erotic woodcuts. As he locked and unlocked the cabinets for scholars and observed the intensity of their desire to see forbidden images, he pondered on the possibility of his own archive. Politically, the time was approaching complete censorship and book burning. In 1935, he immigrated to the United States from Nazi-controlled Germany, \\"arriving with a few personal effects and two steamer trunks bursting with photographs, line drawings, engravings, and art reproductions.\\" He spent the next five decades adding to his collection of images and meeting some of the cultural icons of the times such as Alfred Kinsey, Peter Max, and Stanley Marcus, a diverse collection of people. Artists, musicians, writers and people from all over the world would write to him, often sending little gifts. In 1974 he published the book The Good Old Days-They Were Terrible! debunking the wrongly nostalgic view of the Gilded Age, describing in vivid detail hazards of pollution, dangerous traffic, low-quality housing, rural hardships, serf- like labor conditions, rampant crime (police corruption endemic), unhealthy food or drink, lack of public health (helped by horrible sanitation problems), brutal education methods with grindingly difficult lessons, slow traveling and even perils in leisure activities which menaced people. He played Dr. Waxman in the 1983 movie Lovesick. He married Anne Gray who already had three children: Wendel, Mel, and Beverly. Otto was accepted into their family and became the father. He had four grandchildren: Debby, Ellen, Rowie and Julia. ==Notes== (Page not found 4 Feb. 2014 at https://web.archive.org/web/20120101152239/http://corporate.corbis.com/citizenship/bettmann- archive/.) ==Sources== *Bettmann, Otto L.

A larger church in Kimberley, Northern Cape. The Methodist Church of Southern Africa (MCSA) is a large Wesleyan Methodist denomination, with local churches across South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, Lesotho, Swaziland and a more limited presence in Mozambique. It is a member church of the World Methodist Council. The church is the largest Mainline Protestant denomination in South Africa – 7.3% of the South African population recorded their religious affiliation as 'Methodist' in the last national census.For a discussion of Church membership statistics in South Africa please refer to Forster, D. \\"God's mission in our context, healing and transforming responses\\" in Forster, D and Bentley, W. Methodism in Southern Africa: A celebration of Wesleyan Mission. Kempton Park. AcadSA publishers (2008:97–98) The denomination has nearly 2 million members. ==History== Methodism in Southern Africa began as a result of lay Christian work by an Irish soldier of the English Regiment, John Irwin, who was stationed at the Cape and began to hold prayer meetings as early as 1795.Millard-Jackson, J \\"Who called the tune? Methodist Missionary policy in South Africa during the 19th century\\" in Forster, D and Bentley, W.: Methodism in Southern Africa: A celebration of Wesleyan Mission. Kempton Park. AcadSA publishers (2008:31). The first Methodist lay preacher at the Cape, George Middlemiss, was a soldier of the 72nd regiment of the British Army stationed at the Cape in 1805.Forster, D. \\"God's mission in our context, healing and transforming responses\\" in Forster, D and Bentley, W.: Methodism in Southern Africa: A celebration of Wesleyan Mission. Kempton Park. AcadSA publishers (2008:80) This foundation paved the way for missionary work by Methodist missionary societies from Great Britain, many of whom sent missionaries with the 1820 English settlers to the Western and Eastern Cape. Among the most notable of the early missionaries were Barnabas Shaw and William Shaw.Grassow, P. \\"William Shaw\\" in Forster, D and Bentley, W.: Methodism in Southern Africa: A celebration of Wesleyan Mission. Kempton Park. AcadSA publishers (2008:13-25) The largest group was the Wesleyan Methodist Church, but there were a number of others that joined together to form the Methodist Church of South Africa, later known as the Methodist Church of Southern Africa to reflect its cross-border mission. Peter J. Harley, born 24 November 1931 in Acres Goodwood, Cape Town, is the longest serving Local Preacher in the Cape of Good Hope District. Renowned throughout for the futuristic type of youth programs which today is the norm, teaching young people in disadvantaged areas about terms such as organograms, resource, co-ordinator,liaison,scrounger as far back as 1969, way ahead of its time. From 1969 through 1974 they drew up to 450 of the youth in the area, unfailingly attending its activities week by week. An outspoken and challenging local preacher, the preached word more often than not sending parishioners home with much food for thought as the unadulterated word is preached as a pure Methodist. The originator of many Bible Study groups throughout the Peninsula of which some are still in operation. Many young people originally from that group have advanced to become leaders in various fields with much thanks and gratefulness to the commitment and dedication of Peter Harley for the spreading of the Gospel and above all: teaching others to teach. The MCSA rejected the apartheid ideology from the beginning and was a vocal critic of the Nationalist government policy throughout the apartheid era. A notable politician with Methodist roots was Nelson Mandela, who addressed the annual conference in a 1994, praising the work of the church throughout the era of minority-rule. Faced by government pressure to divide along racial lines, the 1958 conference declared its \\"conviction that it is the will of God for the Methodist Church that it should be one and undivided, trusting to the leading of God to bring this ideal to ultimate fruition\\". Six years later the first African to serve as president of conference was elected. The life of the MCSA reflects the strains and tensions of an apartheid society. In spite of this, the conference, connexional executive and synods have long since been non-racial. The idea of a one and undivided church has still to be realized at the congregational level. The Methodist Church of southern africa has been best church since it began. ==Gender and sexuality== On issues of gender and human sexuality, the denomination is more liberal than other denominations in African countries. For example, the Methodist Church of Southern Africa has allowed and supported the ordination of women in ministry. In 2019 the Methodist Church of Southern Africa inducted Purity Malinga as Presiding Bishop, making her the first female Bishop in the church. Additionally, the denomination has opposed discrimination against members of the gay and lesbian community. In particular, the denomination opposed the anti-gay legislation being proposed in Uganda. In 2013, the denomination announced that it was in the midst of conversation regarding how to approach same-sex relationships. Currently, “Conference recognises that any decision and subsequent action on the issue of civil unions between same sex partners must await the outcome of the on-going process of engagement as specified by Conference 2005 and, in the interim, expects Methodist Ministers to continue to offer pastoral care to homosexual individuals.\\" In a case concerning a married lesbian pastor, the Western Cape High Court determined that \\"the Methodist church did not have a rule prohibiting its ministers from marrying someone of the same sex\\". Additionally, another court determined that the denomination \\"even accepts same-sex relationships (as long as such relationships are not solemnised by marriage), which means it is not at the core of the Church’s beliefs\\". At the Constitutional Court, the Church said that \\"it tolerates homosexual relationships but requires its ministers not to enter into same-sex marriages.\\" Regarding a specific case involving a lesbian minister, the MCSA \\"allowed her to be in a homosexual relationship whilst being a minister, and allowed her to stay in the Church’s manse with her partner, but drew the line at recognising her same-sex marriage.\\" In 2016, the Rev Londiwe Zulu, an openly lesbian Methodist pastor, participated in a panel on human sexuality. ==Structure== The church is Connexional and organised along episcopal lines. The MCSA operates today across six countries in Southern Africa. The organisation as a whole is referred to as a \\"Connexion\\", which in turn is made up of 12 Districts: *Limpopo *Cape of Good Hope *Central *Highveld and Swaziland *Natal Coastal *Natal West *Grahamstown *Clarkebury *Kimberley, Namibia & Bloemfontein *Northern Free State & Lesotho *Queenstown *Mocambique. *Botswana Representatives from across the Connexion meet together every year at an annual Conference, as is Methodist tradition. The Conference elects a \\"presiding bishop\\", who acts as the leader of the Connexion as a whole. Each district is led by a bishop and a District Executive, with the main decision- making body at a district level being the annual synod. At a local level are the circuits, consisting of a number of church congregations, known as \\"societies\\" (modelled on the early Methodist societies). The circuits, of which there are hundreds, are grouped into districts. ==References *The official website of The Methodist Church of Southern Africa Category:Methodist denominations Category:Protestantism in Africa Category:Members of the World Council of Churches ","title":"Methodist Church of Southern Africa"},{"id":"6210715","text":"Yustin Djanelidze (Russian: Юстин Джанелидзе, ; 27 October 1883 – 14 January 1950) was a Soviet lieutenant general, Hero of the Soviet Union of Georgian ethnicity and a pioneer of cardiac surgery in the 20th century.

The first record of a central district office is in Sao Hai at Tambon Sala Li Lao. The Mueang Saraburi office was moved to Tambon Pak Phriaw, Mueang Saraburi District in 1896. At the same time, the Sao Hai district office was moved to Tambon Suan Dokmai. Three years later it was moved again to Tambon Sao Hai near Chao Poo Shrine. In 1924 the owner of Sao Hai fresh market donated 12,800 m2 of land about 500 m from the old location to build a new district office and police station for the district. The name of the district means 'crying pillar', which originates from a local legend. At the time the city pillar of Bangkok was built, the king asked for the most beautiful pillars from all over the country to be sent to the capital. The one sent from Saraburi was nearly perfect, but it arrived after a pillar had been chosen and thus was only made a secondary pillar. The pillar became very sad, floated back to Saraburi on the Chao Phraya and Pa Sak Rivers, and sunk there. Later villagers heard the wails and erected the pillar there, which gave the tambon and thus the district its name. It is now in the Chao Mae Takhian Tong Shrine within the Wat Sung Temple, near the district office of Sao Hai District. ==Geography== Neighbouring districts are (from the northwest clockwise) Ban Mo, Phra Phutthabat, Chaloem Phra Kiat, Mueang Saraburi, and Nong Saeng of Saraburi Province; and Tha Ruea of Ayutthaya Province. The main river of the district is the Pa Sak River. == Administration == The district is divided into 12 sub-districts (tambon), which are further subdivided into 103 villages (muban). There are three townships (thesaban tambon): Sao Hai and Ban Yang each cover parts of the same-named tambon, Suan Dok Mai covers tambon Suan Dok Mai.

He later died at Evin prison, causing an international outcry. ==Background and imprisonment== Akbar Mohammadi was from the city of Amol in northern Iran. The son of Muhammad Mohammadi, Akbar had a brother, Manuchehr, and a sister, Simin. During the July 1999 protests, Manuchehr was arrested and accused of taking a \\"leading role\\". Apparently due to his connection with Manuchehr, Akbar was also arrested and reportedly given a death sentence for his role in the protest. In an appeal in November 2000, Akbar's sentence was reduced to seven years' imprisonment. Three years later, an additional two years were added to Akbar's sentence following charges that he had given interviews to foreign media and made \\"political statements\\". Akbar and Manuchehr's family was for sometime unaware of their location. When the family discovered that Akbar and Manuchehr had been arrested, their father Muhammad and their sister Simin began to lobby on their behalf; both were themselves arrested and sent to Evin prison, with Simin reportedly being beaten before her father. ==Death== On July 30, 2006, Akbar Mohammadi died in Evin prison. He had been on a hunger strike for more than a week, reportedly protesting the refusal by the authorities to allow him to seek medical treatment for injuries suffered as a result of torture.

It was the German entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 1969. Malmkvist was the second of three female Scandinavian schlager artists to represent Germany in the Contest in the late 1960s and early 1970s, the first being Norwegian Wenche Myhre in 1968 with \\"Ein Hoch der Liebe\\" and the third Danish Gitte Hænning with \\"Junger Tag in 1973.

Midnight Zoo debuted on 31 July 2006 and was broadcast from Sydney. It was shown live throughout Victoria and in the capital cities of Sydney and Brisbane, and ran from 12:30 am to 2:00 am Weekday mornings. The final airing of the show was on 21 October 2006. The show was hosted by Steven O'Donnell, Angie Richards, and Charlotte Connell. == Etymology == The somewhat unusual name of the show stems from the name of the show's creator, Jack Dita aka 'The Zoo Keeper'. The presence of 'Midnight' in the name also hints at the show's late timeslot. == Cast == Midnight Zoo was hosted by: Angie Richards - Host, Hollywood Set Charlotte Connell - Host, Bikini Beach Cabana Set Steven O'Donnell - Host, Cash Corner Set Each host was allocated a location, as shown above. == Format == Midnight Zoo was similar in concept to the Ten Network's 'Up Late Game Show', hosted by former Big Brother housemate, Simon Deering aka Hotdogs. The 90 minute runtime of Midnight Zoo was split into three 30 minute slots. Each slot was allocated to one host/location pair. The puzzles were mostly Brainteasers and questions relating to popular culture and are regarded as relatively simple (for example, 'Name a movie starting with B'). Money is awarded via the gameboard, which dictates the amount of money won for a particular answer. A puzzle featured in a previous slot was carried over to the next slot, suggesting that one puzzle can sometimes occupy the entire 90 minute runtime. To maintain interest in the show over the course of its duration, there were several segments featured during each slot. These were mostly to encourage callers during slow periods, which in turn encourages human interaction with the show. These include: Cash Grab - A 5-minute period where all money on the game board is doubled. Double Money - If successful, the next 2 callers will be awarded double their winnings. Call Rush - A \\"short amount of time\\" where callers are further encouraged to call by on-screen graphics. All segments came with the added incentive of being featured on live television as a caller. At the same time, a puzzle's jackpot amount steadily increased throughout the show. As an added bonus, all successful callers were offered a chance at the Bonus Board. The Bonus Board featured 12 numbers, of which the contestant much choose 3. If the contestant chose all three correctly, their winnings were increased by a jackpot amount which varies from $2500–$12000 ==Criticism and problems== On 11 August 2006 satirical comedy series The Chaser's War on Everything featured a segment on the influx of late night phone-in quiz shows. The segment mocked the standard of all late night quiz programs and their questions. For Midnight Zoo, particular reference was made to the female hosts wearing bikinis . One Australian TV critic has even classed Midnight Zoo as the worst of the genre based on the use of bikinis.Midnight Zoo review Channel Seven's morning program Sunrise showed a clip one morning of the show the night before where a picture of Sunrise host David Koch was used in a \\"name that face\\" type game. The Sunrise team criticised Midnight Zoo for spelling his name wrong and the show in general. == Probability == The only probability present on Midnight Zoo that can be computed is the chance of success on the Bonus Board. This is equal to 12c3 = 1 in 220. The relative ease of the questions featured on Midnight Zoo suggest easy winnings for contestants. However, one must consider two important factors present in the game that restrict successful callers. Firstly, one must consider the chance of actually being chosen as a contestant. Secondly, one must consider the number of possible answers for the questions with respect to the number of available answers on the game board. == Pricing and procedure == Midnight Zoo contestants are charged a maximum of 55c/per minute (more from mobiles). The method of player selection was handled by registering interest via SMS or landline. When selected, players would receive a call from Midnight Zoo. Problems arising from this method include Midnight Zoo's use of a private line, eliminating a number of mobile users who ignore such calls. ==References== Category:Phone-in quiz shows Category:Seven Network original programming Category:Australian game shows Category:2000s Australian game shows Category:2006 Australian television series debuts Category:2006 Australian television series endings Category:Television shows set in Melbourne Category:Television shows set in Sydney Category:Television shows set in Brisbane ","title":"Midnight Zoo"},{"id":"6210807","text":"\\"Glamorous Sky\\" is Mika Nakashima's 16th single overall, her 1st under the name Nana starring Mika Nakashima, and the second most successful single in her career after \\"Stars\\".

The film was made by RKO and produced by Edmund Grainger from a screenplay by Alan Le May based on the story by DeVallon Scott. ==Plot== Robert Newton and Linda Darnell in Blackbeard the Pirate The film follows British Navy Lieutenant Robert Maynard (Keith Andes), who sets out to earn a reward by proving that privateer Henry Morgan (Torin Thatcher) also engages in piracy. Maynard poses as a surgeon on board the ship of pirate Charles Bellamy, who he believes is in league with Morgan. Once Maynard and fellow spy Briggs come on board, they discover that the pirate Blackbeard (Robert Newton) has murdered Bellamy and taken over as captain. Also on board is Edwina Mansfield, a pirate's daughter, who was going to marry Bellamy. Blackbeard knows that Morgan loves Mansfield and will pursue her. Blackbeard orders Maynard to remove a bullet from his neck, and demands sailor Gilly watch him. Gilly slips Maynard a note begging him to slit the pirate's throat, but Maynard declines. Maynard slips into the Blackbeard's quarters and finds Bellamy's logbook, which he hopes will contain evidence that Bellamy gave Morgan stolen goods. Maynard then defends Edwina against the unwanted advances of a lecherous pirate, killing him with his dagger. She tells Maynard that she agreed to marry Bellamy to escape from Morgan, from whom she has stolen treasure, which is now hidden in a clothes chest. Blackbeard breaks open one of Edwina's chests but discovers only letters in which Edwina implicates Morgan as Bellamy's ally. Maynard tries to steal the letter, but Blackbeard stops him, noting that if Morgan were arrested, all of his loot would go to the King. Blackbeard finally identifies the treasure chest and claims it. ==Cast== * Robert Newton as Captain Edward Teach * Linda Darnell as Edwina Mansfield * William Bendix as Ben Worley * Keith Andes as Robert Maynard * Torin Thatcher as Sir Henry Morgan * Irene Ryan as Alvina, a lady in waiting * Alan Mowbray as Noll * Richard Egan as Briggs * Skelton Knaggs as Gilly * Dick Wessel as Dutchman * Anthony Caruso as Pierre La Garde * Jack Lambert as Tom Whetstone * Noel Drayton as Jeremy * Pat Flaherty as Job Maggot ==Production== The film was based on an original story by DeVallon Scott.

He toured and recorded with John Scofield and the Vanguard Jazz Orchestra among others, and played on over 500 albums. == Biography == Irwin attended North Texas State University with Norman Wisdom, studying classical music. Although he started out playing alto sax and clarinet (achieving first chair All State clarinet while at Westchester High School in Houston) he soon switched to the bass and joined the university's \\"Two O'Clock Lab Band.\\" After working with pianist Red Garland in Dallas, Irwin moved to New York. There he played with Charles Brackeen, and later landed his first steady gig in trumpeter Ted Curson's group in 1975. He accompanied such vocalists as Jackie Paris, Betty Carter, Annie Ross, Ann Hampton Callaway, Tania Maria and Mose Allison. Influences include bassists Al Jackson Sr. and Eddie Jones. Irwin's first major recording session was in New York City on May 20 & 21, 1976, with Brazilian pianist Dom Salvador, My Family (for Muse Records).Liner notes on LP back cover of My Family, Muse Records, May 20 & 21, 1976] Beginning in 1977, Irwin played with Art Blakey for three years. The Jazz Messengers recorded several of Irwin’s compositions including \\"Kamal.\\" Irwin also worked with Chet Baker, Mel Lewis, Joe Lovano, Stan Getz, Johnny Griffin and Horace Silver as well as with Brazilian musicians Duduca Fonseca and Portinho. From 1992 to 1995, Irwin played with guitarist John Scofield. He can be heard on his Blue Note recordings What We Do, Hand Jive and Groove Elation. His battle with liver cancer, which was ultimately fatal, raised awareness of jazz musicians without medical insurance. The Jazz Foundation of America and Englewood Hospital and Medical Center created the Dennis Irwin Memorial Fund to pay for cancer screenings for uninsured jazz and blues musicians. Irwin died in Manhattan on March 10, 2008, the same day as a Jazz at Lincoln Center benefit concert in his honor featuring performances by Wynton Marsalis, Tony Bennett, and Jon Hendricks, in addition to Lovano and Scofield. His partner was singer Aria Hendricks, daughter of Jon Hendricks. His son, Michael Irwin, is a trumpet player in New York City. == Selected discography == With Art Blakey and The Jazz Messengers * Gypsy Folk Tales (Roulette, 1977) * Heat Wave (Pony Canyon/After Beat, 1977) * In My Prime Vol. 1 (Timeless, 1977) * In My Prime Vol. 2 (Timeless, 1977) * In This Korner (Concord Jazz, 1978) * Reflections in Blue (Timeless, 1978) * Night in Tunisia: Digital Recording (Polygram, 1979) * One by One (Palcoscenico, 1979 [1981]) * Works of Art (Recall, 2002) With Joshua Breakstone *Echoes (Contemporary, 1987) *Self-Portrait in Swing (Contemporary, 1989) *9 by 3 (Contemporary, 1991) *Walk Don't Run (King, 1992) * Let's Call This Monk!

It was manufactured by Lear Siegler and had a 12-inch screen displaying 12 or 24 lines of 80 characters. It set a new industry low single unit price of $995. Its \\"dumb terminal\\" nickname came from some of the original trade publication advertisements. It quickly became commercially successful because of the rapid increase of computer communications speeds, and because of new minicomputer systems released to the market which required inexpensive operator consoles. ==Antecedents== Lear Siegler, Inc. (LSI) manufactured its first video display terminal in 1972 – the 7700A. In 1973 LSI hired a new head of engineering, Jim Placak. He and his team created the ADM-1 in late '73. It set a new pricing low in the industry at $1,500. Its lower cost was primarily due to a unique single printed circuit board design. In early 1973 the LSI division in Anaheim, California that manufactured these and other products hired a management team for this product line – a VP, national sales manager, and one regional sales manager – for the western region. The regional manager was Dennis Cagan who came from an LSI competitor. The ADM-1 was followed by the ADM-2 in early '74. It had expanded functionality and a detached keyboard. It set another new industry low single unit price of $1,195. The initials \\"ADM\\" were referred to as meaning \\"American Dream Machine\\" in some advertising. ==ADM-3== The clam shell ADM-3 followed and the first manufactured units were introduced at 1975 National Computer Conference in Anaheim, Calif., May 19–22, 1975, in booth 2348 at a price of $995. Its innovative wave soldered single board design, which included the keyboard and all connectors, was packaged in an original clam shell enclosure. Within weeks of the launch of the ADM-3, Cagan started to book very large orders. Its 'Dumb Terminal' nickname came from some of the original trade publication ads, and quickly caught on industry wide. Due to two emerging trends the device immediately became the best selling in the industry. Computer communications speeds were rapidly increasing, and a wave of general purpose and dedicated single application minicomputer systems were hitting the market from dozens of manufacturers. These required inexpensive operator consoles that could match the speeds. With no fast low cost printers available, the ADM-3 (painted in a variety of custom colors for the OEMs) became the de facto standard. By December 20, 1976, the widely used Teletype Model 33 KSR electromechanical printing terminal, which could only print ten characters per second, sold for $895 or $32/month, while the ADM-3, which could display up to 1,920 characters per second, went for $995 or $36/month. ==ADM-3 options== The original ADM-3 terminal displayed only capital letters. In 1976, an option was added to allow it to display both lower and upper case. The standard version of the terminal displayed only twelve (rather than twenty-four) rows of eighty characters. In those days RAM was expensive, and halving the display size halved the RAM requirement (and likewise all uppercase required only six bits per character to be stored rather than seven). Further optional add-ons included a graphics card enabling it to emulate a Tektronix 4014 and an extension port which would allow daisy chaining several ADM-3As on a single RS-232 line. ==ADM-3A== In 1976, the ADM-3A was introduced. The ADM-3A added support for control codes to move the cursor around on the screen, and directly position the cursor at any point in the display. It did not, however, support “clear to end of line” or “clear to end of screen”, or other more advanced codes that appeared in later terminals, such as the VT52 and VT100. The ADM-3A's overall setup was controlled by 20 DIP switches under the nameplate at the front of the machine, beside the keyboard, including speed from 75 to 19,200 baud. The advanced configuration options allowed split speed connection, sending at one rate, and receiving at another. == Hardware == ADM-3A keyboard layout The 5×7 dot matrix characters were displayed in amber, green, or white phosphor on black (the cursor was 7×9). The keyboard had 59 keys. The 12-inch monochrome CRT was mounted in the top half of the case, which was hinged in the back and opened like a clamshell. The CRT was typically made by Ball Brothers. Unlike later terminals, such as the VT100, the ADM-3A did not use a microprocessor in its implementation, but instead used TTL. It did, however, use RAM chips, rather than the Circulating Memory used by earlier terminals, such as the Datapoint 3300. == Legacy == The use of the HJKL keys for moving the cursor in the vi editor and its descendants originated from the ADM-3A, University of California, Berkeley's Teletype Model 33 replacement, just prior to the vi editor's creation;http://ftp.fibranet.cat/UnixArchive/Documentation/Unix_Review/Berkeley_Unix_History.pdfhttps://episodiccontentmag.com/2016/06/03/rogue_chapter1/ the cursor-movement arrows were printed on those four keys.ADM-3A Operators Manual The \`Home\` label printed on the key may have additionally led to the establishment of the tilde character (\\"~\\") as the representation of the home directory in many Unix shells. The , , , and labels printed on the , , , , and keys were a visual reference to the control characters , , , , and that were required to move the cursor left, down, up, right, and to the top/left corner (or \\"Home\\" position) of the terminal, respectively.

Finally, the control key was located above, not below, the shift key—in the same place where most modern PC keyboards put the Caps Lock key.Very early PC keyboards also had the Ctrl key located above the shift key, just like the ADM-3A's keyboard. Many standard Unix key combinations were designed with the QWERTY layout and the ADM-3A's original Ctrl key placement in mind. Many of those key combinations are still in use today, even on non-Unix operating systems. Seasoned computer users familiar with the original layout often claim that the different position of the Ctrl key on modern PC keyboard layouts makes the use of Ctrl key combinations more cumbersome. Solutions exist for many operating systems to switch around the Caps Lock and Ctrl keys in software, thus making the PC keyboard layout more closely resemble the ADM-3A's keyboard layout. The legacy of the ADM-3A's keyboard also lives on in Japan, where the local layout follows it almost exactly. Local Mac keyboard layouts even retain the ADM-3A's position of the Control key, transposing it with the Caps Lock key. ==See also== * Teletype Model 33 == Notes  References  External links == * Lear Siegler ADM-3A on the terminals wiki * Lear Siegler ADM 3A * Lear Siegler, Inc.

The first name means in Slovak royal and refers to royal meadows. The second name comes from the appellative of the Hungarian origin terhe (burden) borrowed to the Slovak language before the 12th century as tärcha > ťarcha but later also as tercha with Slovak possessive suffix -ova. It refers to legal obligations of the citizens. ==History== The village was established in 1580, but the area was inhabited even before its establishment. Originally a Vlach settlement from the period of Vlach colonization, it slowly began to change to an agricultural settlement, as many new settlers in the 17th century came to the village. In the 19th century, several droughts and plagues depopulated the village, as many emigrated to the US, Canada and Argentina. Near the end of World War II, half of the wooden part of the village was burned down. During the first post- war years, it was reconstructed as part of two-year plan. The village is most famous for being the birthplace and town where Juraj Janosik grew up. In 2013 Music of Terchová was inscribed on the UNESCO's Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?lg=en&pg;=00011&RL;=00877 ==Geography== The municipality lies at an altitude of 514 metres and covers an area of 84.542 km2. It has a population of about 4,073 people. The village lies in a valley in the Malá Fatra mountains, about 25 km east of Žilina.

Published fortnightly during term-time by a team of up to 100 student volunteers, the paper has a circulation of 2,500 and is distributed free across campus and the surrounding student area to a projected readership of 15,000–20,000. ==History== The University of Sheffield has a history of student journalism that predates its inception as a university when it received its charter in 1905. Following the Second World War, a new newspaper was set up at the University called Darts, The name stemmed from a sister arts publication, Arrows, which had been around since the 1930s, with the new venture seen as a smaller entity than its sibling – a dart being a sort of miniature arrow. (The paper was ultimately to outlive its brethren, which closed in the late 1980s.) In the 1997/98 academic year a new editorial team took charge of Darts and decided to change the name. In the present day, Darts is the name of the part of the Comment section which provides a satirical and comical take on recent news stories and events. On 28 November 1997 the newly rebranded Steel Press was unveiled. In style the paper was not particularly different from what had come before, yet over the following nine years underwent many changes. Ranging in appearance from something not dissimilar to the Daily Express to its eventual appearance as the Daily Mirror of student publications, the Sheffield Steel Press as it was known (Sheffield Steel as it appeared on the cover) continued to provide a proving ground for young journalists hoping for a career in the media or simply looking for an interesting diversion during their time at the University of Sheffield. In 2008, Sheffield Steel Press merged with Sure Radio and the website to make a fully converged student media called Forge Media. This consists of the newspaper Forge Press, Forge Radio and ForgeToday.com, as well as the more recent Forge TV. On 4 July 2012, Forge Media was named Best Student Media at the NUS Awards. The award recognised the many hours of hard work put in by the members of the Forge Press, Forge Radio and Forge TV teams, as individual teams and as one fully converged media package, displaying a wide range of multimedia skills and including hundreds of members of the student body, and reaching large audiences. == Organisation == The organisation's editor is an unpaid position for a current student. As of June 2020, the Editor is Kate Procter, and the Deputy Editors are Emily Evans and Alex Brotherton. The editorial team consists of usually two co- editors for each section, but some have one or three. The team is elected at the Annual General Meeting before Easter of each year, and takes over the running of the paper for the last issue of the academic year. The sections of the paper are: News, Features, Opinion, Lifestyle, Break, Arts & Theatre, Music, Screen, Games, Science & Tech, and Sport. Skills required of an editor range from management of teams of volunteers, to page layout and graphic design using programs such as Adobe InDesign and Adobe Photoshop, as well as communication, organisation and flexibility. The newspaper also has an online presence, forgetoday.com, which contains all articles published in the fortnightly paper, as well as additional content and archived editions. Since 2003 the University of Sheffield Union of Students has employed a non-student in a support role which holds no editorial power and is designed to aid the day-to-day running of the organisation. In 2006 this role was expanded, retitled to 'Media Development Officer', to support all student media and any student or society who wants to use the Media Hub facilities. This role was held by Robert Ellerington from 2006 to 2010. Robert was succeeded by former Radio 1 DJ Mary Anne Hobbs in October 2010, who in turn was succeeded by Mikey Smith in September 2011 after her return to broadcasting with XFM. Following a staff restructure, the role was expanded again to include Theatre Groups and Film Unit and re-titled 'Specialist Development Coordinator – Media & Performance'. Initially this role was held by Beth Cunningham, before being taken over by Freyja Gillard in 2016. ==External links== *University of Sheffield *Forge Media Category:University of Sheffield Category:Student newspapers published in the United Kingdom Category:Publications established in 1950 Category:1950 establishments in England Category:Newspapers published in Yorkshire Category:Biweekly newspapers published in the United Kingdom Category:Free newspapers ","title":"Forge Press"},{"id":"6210946","text":"Garden West is the main area of Jamshed Town in Karachi, Sindh, Pakistan.

BBC One broadcast the programme, which was hosted by Graham Norton, on Saturday evenings from 29 July through 16 September 2006. The title derives from the refrain of \\"Maria\\", a song from the first act of The Sound of Music. ==FormatCreation=== The lead role of Maria von Trapp in the new West End production of The Sound of Music, to be staged by Andrew Lloyd Webber and David Ian, was to be played by American actress Scarlett Johansson. Negotiations fell through, and after a four-year search for an actress to fill the role, it was revealed in November 2005 that Lloyd Webber had approached the BBC to allow the public to cast the role through a Popstars-style talent search, the first time that such a format had been used. This was the first programme to allow the public to cast a leading role in a West End show, and it was initially criticised. However, it won International Emmy and Royal Television Society awards and became the first of a series of collaborations between the BBC and Lloyd Webber, including Any Dream Will Do, I'd Do Anything, and Over the Rainbow. The series also led to versions and similar series abroad. ===Expert panel=== Andrew Lloyd Webber led the search for the musical theatre performer. To assess and train the potential Marias and judge them during the live shows, an expert panel was chosen. The panel comprised: *Andrew Lloyd Webber – musical theatre composer and producer, co-producer of the new stage production *David Ian – theatre producer, co-producer of the new stage production *John Barrowman – musical performer, dancer, singer and actor *Zoe Tyler – voice coach, singer and performer, vocal coach to the finalists Lloyd Webber also asked Denise van Outen to participate in the series, but she turned him down, saying that she \\"felt uncomfortable about being on the panel and giving my criticism\\". She later became a judge on follow-up series, Any Dream Will Do. ===Auditions=== Open auditions were held around the UK in April and May 2006, open to both professionals and amateurs over the age of 17. The top 200 made it through to the London callbacks where they performed for Ian, Barrowman and Tyler to secure one of 50 places at Lloyd Webber's \\"Maria School\\", where over four days they would receive vocal and drama training from the expert panel. Several additional performers were selected over this fifty contestant limit; one being Briony, who had been rejected initially due to nerves hampering her performance, but who returned for a second chance and was allowed in by Ian. A further four, whom the panel had rejected, were contacted by Lloyd Webber himself as he personally believed them to be potential Marias. During \\"Maria School\\", contestants were eliminated to leave twenty, who were then taken to Lloyd Webber's house, where they performed for fifty people from the entertainment business. Ten finalists were then chosen by the panel and taken through to the live studio finals. The series started on Saturday 29 July 2006, and the first two programmes followed the audition stages of the competition before revealing the final ten at the end of the second programme. ===Live finals=== The final ten contestants then competed in the live studio finals held on Saturday nights over six weeks. Each week the contestants sang and performed during the live show, receiving comments from the judges following their performance. The public then got a chance to vote for their favourite Maria, and the two contestants with the fewest votes performed a sing-off in front of Lloyd Webber, who then decided which Maria to keep in the contest. This was repeated with the top ten, the top nine and the top eight. With the top seven and top five, two were voted off in the program, and there were two different sing-offs. Lloyd Webber had no say in the final casting decision, when in the concluding edition of the series it was left to the public to choose who should play Maria out of the final two contenders, Connie Fisher and Helena Blackman. After more than 2 million votes were cast, the winning entrant was revealed as Fisher, who won a six-month contract to play Maria in the West End production, performing six out of the eight weekly shows. The profits from the telephone votes went to a bursary for young performers. Lloyd Webber also donated his fee to the bursary. ==Finalists== Ten potential Marias were selected as finalists who would appear on the live shows. Abi Finley and Aoife Mulholland auditioned together having known each other from college, and both made it to the finals. One of the original 10 finalists, Emilie Alford, withdrew from the competition after deciding it was not for her. She was replaced by Siobhan Dillon, who lost a place in the final ten following a sing-off against Alford and Laura Sicurello in front of Lloyd Webber. This earned her the nickname \\"Second Chance Maria\\". {  + Finalists - ! Finalist ! Age* ! From ! Dress colour !

The series also helped the careers of the other finalists, some of whom later took leading roles in West End shows. Semi-finalist Aoife Mulholland also took up the role of Maria in April 2007 for two shows a week, after Fisher was advised to reduce her performances to six per week. ==After the series== Following the final, Lloyd Webber was criticised after it was revealed that actress Emma Williams had been hired to perform the two performances per week that Fisher would not. Prior to The Sound of Music opening Williams \\"withdrew her services\\", reportedly because her role had been downgraded from four shows per week to two, leaving Fisher to perform all eight shows unless indisposed. The £4 million production opened at the London Palladium on 15 November 2006 to positive reviews, leading to a £1.1 million increase in ticket sales in one day. In January 2007, Fisher was chosen by the London Critics' Circle to win their award for best newcomer, sharing the prize with Andrew Garfield. Reducing her performances to six per week in March 2007 following an order to rest her voice, her run in the show was extended until 23 February 2008, when actress Summer Strallen took over the role following a tie-in with the Channel 4 soap Hollyoaks. Fisher has also made numerous appearances on stage and on television, released two albums, and performed the lead role in the ITV1 drama Caught in a Trap on 26 December 2008. She reprised her role as Maria in a UK tour of the production in July 2009. Several of the other final ten contestants have taken on leading roles in musicals following the series. Aoife Mulholland was cast in December 2006 as Roxie Hart in the West End musical Chicago, and took on the role of Maria in the West End production for two shows per week in April 2007 after Fisher's reduction in performances. In July 2007 Siobhan Dillon started in the role of Patty Simcox in the musical Grease and later went on to play the lead role of Sandy in January 2010.GREASE celebrates its 1000th performance and announces a new cast of Rydell High 2010 with SIOBHAN DILLON as Sandy Fellow finalist Helena Blackman played Nellie Forbush in a UK tour of South Pacific. Mulholland originated the role of Brooke Wyndham in the West End production of Legally Blonde, and Dillon took over the role of Vivienne Kensington in October 2010.Denise Van Outen, Siobhan Dillon and Carley Stenson to Join West End's Legally Blonde A follow-up programme How Do You Solve a Problem Like Maria? – Connie's Story aired on 27 December 2006 and followed Fisher during rehearsals for her new role up to and including the opening night. Fisher and several other finalists appeared in a special programme on 24 December 2007 with the winner and finalists from Any Dream Will Do titled When Joseph Met Maria. ==Reception== Lloyd Webber and the BBC were criticised by the actors union Equity. They stated that they believed their members would find the series \\"demeaning to their profession\\" and that it was not a \\"proper way\\" to choose a performer. The series opened to mostly negative reviews from the press. In response to the criticism, Lloyd Webber told The Times: > \\"This programme is providing a platform for musical theatre that it has > never had before. The only people upset with Maria are a few precious > luvvies who think things should be done a certain way.\\" Lloyd Webber and the BBC were also criticised for giving the production \\"11 hours of free publicity on prime-time television\\" and that the series could be \\"considered commercial advertising\\". The BBC Trust's Editorial Standards Committee disagreed, saying that the corporation retained \\"editorial control of the programme\\" and avoided \\"disproportionate prominence for Lloyd Webber and the production\\". The first programme attracted 5.1 million viewers with a 32% audience share, with 4.9 million viewers (30% share) watching the first of the live finals, and 4.7 million (23% share) viewing the results programme. The series dropped to a low of 4.4 million viewers (24% share) against the third series of The X Factor on ITV1, which started the week before. The X Factor continued to gain higher viewing figures as the weeks progressed, with the final of Maria? attracting 5.5 million viewers (28% share) for the main show and 7.7 million (35% share) for the results show. Following the conclusion of the series on a ratings high and positive reviews for Fisher following her opening night, the series was followed by a number of similar series from both the BBC and other broadcasters in the UK and abroad. It was credited with helping London theatres reach record ticket sales and attendances in 2007 and, according to The Independent, for \\"persuading a new, younger audience to see the shows in the flesh\\". The series was shown on BBC America in the United States from June 2009. It was described as being \\"refreshing in its simplicity\\" in a \\"landscape that lately seems dominated by audition-heavy musical competitions\\" by LA Times critic Mary McNamara, but Brian Lowry of Variety didn't feel that it would be successful in the U.S. ===Awards=== The series won three awards, and received nominations for another two: *2007 International Emmy Awards: winner – non-scripted entertainment *2006 Royal Television Society Awards: winner – best entertainment programme *2007 Broadcast Awards: winner – best entertainment programme *2007 British Academy Television Awards: nominated – best entertainment programme * 2007 Broadcasting Press Guild Awards: nominated – best comedy/entertainment == Ratings == {   - !

This was followed in 2008 by I'd Do Anything, which sought a lead to play Nancy and three young performers to play the lead in a production of the musical Oliver!. In 2010, Over the Rainbow cast Dorothy and a dog to play Toto in the forthcoming stage production of the 1939 film The Wizard of Oz. The BBC also collaborated with Lloyd Webber to find a performer for Britain's entry into the Eurovision Song Contest 2009 through Eurovision: Your Country Needs You. On 20 August 2006, it was reported that Lloyd Webber had taken legal action against David Ian. Lloyd Webber reportedly wanted to take the format to the United States to cast a Broadway theatre production of Grease. Lloyd Webber discovered that Ian had already brought the idea to NBC, who announced they will look for unknowns to play Sandy Dumbrowski and Danny Zuko, via reality TV show Grease: You're the One that I Want! with Ian and BBC Worldwide, leaving Lloyd Webber furious. Ian said \\"I don't understand the problem. Andrew has no connection with the stage show Grease, which I have successfully produced in the UK. There is a new production of Grease on Broadway in the spring of 2007, that's why I've been asked to judge on You're The One That We Want.\\" This was followed in the UK with the ITV1 series Grease Is the Word, with Ian as a judge. It aired against Any Dream Will Do in 2007. Op zoek naar Evita (Looking for Evita) was produced in the Netherlands in 2007, followed by Op zoek naar Joseph (Looking for Joseph) in 2008, Op zoek naar Mary Poppins (Looking for Mary Poppins) in 2009 and Op zoek naar Zorro (Looking for Zorro) in 2011 and even Op zoek naar Annie (Looking for Annie) in 2012. In 2008 a Canadian version of the show with the same title, searched for a Maria for an upcoming Toronto production of The Sound of Music; this show was initiated by Lloyd Webber, and was aired on CBC Television. John Barrowman was part of the judging panel along with Simon Lee and Canadian vocal coach Elaine Overholt. Lloyd Webber filled in for Lee in the final weeks of the series. In 2009 Vtm aired a Flemish version titled (Looking for Maria). ==References* Category:BBC Television shows Category:British reality television series Category:Singing talent shows Category:International Emmy Award for Best Non-Scripted Entertainment winners Category:2006 British television series debuts Category:2006 British television series endings Category:The Sound of Music ","title":"How Do You Solve a Problem like Maria?"},{"id":"6211126","text":"Mirdha is surname of Jats found in Jodhpur Marwar region of Rajasthan, India.

The village lies in the middle part of the Balkan Mountains, 15 km east of Gabrovo and just north of the Shipka Pass. It is noted for its well- preserved Bulgarian National Revival architecture and history, and is thus a well-known tourist destination in the area. Bozhentsi was established after the incursion of Ottoman Turks in Veliko Tarnovo, the former capital of the Second Bulgarian Empire, in the 16th century. Many residents of the capital then fled to settle in remote and secure parts of the mountains. According to the legend, among them was the young female noble (bolyarka) Bozhana; she chose to hide in the area where the village is today and became its namesake. The noble's sons engaged in trade and the village gradually grew to become an important trade junction during the National Revival towards the middle of the 18th century. The main production consisted of leather, wool, beeswax and honey. The village of Bozhentsi was proclaimed an architectural and historical reserve in 1964 and is part of UNESCO's cultural monuments. The National Revival architecture has been preserved in Bozhentsi due to this, and there is a ban on the construction of any buildings that do not fit with the village's style. As the settlers during the Ottoman rule were mostly wealthy people, many of the houses have two storeys, the first being used as a cattle-shed and the second being inhabited by the owners. Characteristic features of the Bozhentsi architecture are the verandas, the stone-plate roofs, the corner fireplaces and the ceiling woodcarvings. The pavement of the streets in the village is only cobblestone. The Prophet Elijah basilica, featuring a nave and two aisles, is a remarkable example of the National Revival style. Domes can be seen hidden under the ceiling, as well as massive stone walls and the typical Bozhentsi arches. The church was erected in 1835, and the village's influential residents were allowed to construct a belfry, which was usually strictly forbidden by the Ottoman authorities. The former class school was constructed in 1872 and was situated in an imposing building near the entrance to the village. It is today a gallery and its first storey would once accommodate a hall and a library, with the classrooms being located on the second storey. A Roman bridge lies east of the village and a forest path leading to Tryavna begins on the other side. ==External links== ;Information * Bojenci at Bojenci.eu * Bozhentsi at Visit.bg * Bozhentsi at Journey.bg * Bozhentsi at BGGlobe.net * Info for Bozhentsi ;Photos * Artistic photos from Bojentsi * Photos from Bojenci * Nikola Gruev's photo gallery of Bozhentsi * Photos from Bozhentsi * Pictures from Bozhentsi architectural reserve Category:Villages in Gabrovo Province Category:Tourism in Bulgaria ","title":"Bozhentsi"},{"id":"6211202","text":"John Hall Thompson Source: Library and Archives Canada John Hall Thompson (1810 - October 27, 1893) was a Canadian court commissioner and political figure.

These devices may be for one-time use (a thermal fuse), or may be reset manually or automatically ( a thermal switch). ==Thermal fuse== A thermal fuse protecting the windings of a small motor A thermal fuse is a cutoff which uses a one-time fusible link. Unlike a thermal switch which may automatically reset itself when the temperature drops, the thermal fuse is more like an electrical fuse: a single-use device that cannot be reset and must be replaced when it fails or is triggered. A thermal fuse is used when the overheating is a result of a rare occurrence, such as failure requiring repair (which would also replace the fuse) or replacement at the end of service life. Joe Cieszynski, David Fox, Electronics for Service Engineers,Routledge, 1999 , p.175 One mechanism is a small meltable pellet that holds down a spring. When the pellet melts, the spring is released, separating the contacts and breaking the circuit. The Tamura LE series, NEC Sefuse SF series, Microtemp G4A series, and Hosho Elmwood D series, for example, may use alloy pellets that contain copper, beryllium, and silver to melt at a precise temperature. Thermal fuses are usually found in heat-producing electrical appliances such as coffeemakers and hair dryers. They function as safety devices to disconnect the current to the heating element in case of a malfunction (such as a defective thermostat) that would otherwise allow the temperature to rise to dangerous levels, possibly starting a fire. Unlike electrical fuses or circuit breakers, thermal fuses only react to excessive temperature and not to excessive current (unless the excessive current is sufficient to cause the thermal fuse itself to heat up to the trigger temperature). For example, in a surge protector thermal fuses may be wired in series with the varistors; when the varistors conduct, the fuse heats up and disconnects the power, which eliminates the risk of fire which can occur when the varistors are overloaded. ==Thermal switch== Two thermal switches Schematic symbol for a thermal overload switch A thermal switch (sometimes thermal reset or thermal cutout (TCO)) is a device which normally opens at a high temperature (often with a faint \\"plink\\" sound) and re-closes when the temperature drops. The thermal switch may be a bimetallic strip, often encased in a tubular glass bulb to protect it from dust or short circuit. Another common design uses a bimetallic shallow dome-shaped cap which \\"clicks\\" to an inside-out inverted cap shape when heated, such as the \\"Klixon\\" brand of thermal cutouts. Alan R. Earls, Robert E. Edwards, Raytheon Company: The First Sixty YearsArcadia Publishing, 2005 , page 9 Unlike a thermal fuse, a thermal switch is usually reusable and is therefore suited to protecting against temporary situations which are common and user-correctable. Thermal switches are used in power supplies in case of overload, and also as thermostats, and overheat protection in some heating and cooling systems. They are found in virtually every refrigerator, microwave, clothes dryer, space heater, and many more appliances found throughout the home. Another type of thermal switch is a PTC (Positive Temperature Coefficient) thermistor; these thermistors have a \\"switch\\" temperature at which the resistance suddenly rises rapidly, limiting the current through the circuit. When used in conjunction with a thermistor relay, the PTC will switch off an electrical system at a desired temperature. Typical use is for motor overheat protection. These devices are not a true “switch” as they do not disengage completely and there is always some resistance across the switch. Devices also apply PTC tech as a PTC thermistor sensor, this is different from a cutout and can confuse amateur electronic technicians. Thermal switches are included in some light fixtures, particularly with recessed lights, where excessive heat is most likely to occur. This may lead to \\"cycling\\", where a light turns off and back on every few minutes. Flashing incandescent Christmas lights take advantage of this effect. Some flasher bulbs interrupt power when heated, while other twinkle/sparkle mini-bulbs momentarily shunt current around the filament. Thermal switches are part of the normal operation of older fluorescent light fixtures, where they are the major part of the starter module. GE trademarked the name \\"Guardette\\" for the thermal protection switches used on their refrigeration compressors. Thermal switches on microprocessors often stop only the fetching of instructions to execute, reducing the clock rate to zero until a lower temperature is reached, while maintaining power to the cache to prevent data loss (although a second switch, with a higher triggering temperature, usually turns off even the cache and forces the computer to reboot). This mitigates the impact of programs resembling power viruses on the processor's longevity, while still accommodating their possible legitimate uses; it can also make overclocking possible with less risk. ===Manual reset=== Some thermal switches must be reset manually after they have been tripped. This design is used when an automatic and unattended restart would create a hazardous condition, such as sudden startup of a powerful motor without warning. These types of thermal cutouts are usually reset by pressing a push-button by hand or with a special tool. ==See also== * Thermistor ==References *Explanation of thermal cutoff switch *The ethics of thermal fuses Category:Electric power systems components Category:Safety switches Category:Fuses ","title":"Thermal cutoff"},{"id":"6211225","text":"Salford is a village and civil parish about west of Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire.

Some scholars and historians trace the foundation around the 4th-5th century BC in the area of Salentino hamlet, a few kilometers from the modern town, on a hill overlooking a fertile plain area. Probably the greater fertility of the land in the valley, the abundance of spring water that flowed into the ground a few feet from the surface, or some devastation were the causes that led the people of Salentino to move to the current city center. The city's prosperity has been historically connected to its large underground aquifer. In the early Christian era it was an episcopal see, but was later destroyed by foreign invasions. Under the Aragonese domination a castle was built here.

He was voiced by J.D. Hall. *A character called Guran had cameo appearances in some episodes of Defenders of the Earth, which featured Flash Gordon, The Phantom, and Mandrake the Magician. However, as the series took place in the future, it is presumed to be one of Guran's descendants. *In the 1996 The Phantom film, Guran makes a brief appearance played by Radmar Agana Jao. In this version he is much younger than the Phantom, and is portrayed as an Asian, rather than African as he is in the comics. He also wears a turban and a more traditional set of clothing, rather than his strange hat and unique dress sense in the comic. *In the 1943 Phantom movie serial, a character named Moko is clearly inspired by Guran, and serves as the Phantom's assistant and helper throughout the film. *In the 2010 SyFy miniseries, Guran is recast as an educated native woman (Sandrine Holt) of the Bengalla jungle who eventually befriends Kit Walker the 22nd (Ryan Carnes) the son of the 21st Phantom (Kit Walker the 21st) and Diane Walker. It is possible, although there is no evidence to support this, that Guran is her family name and that she is descended from the original Guran. ==References * Character profile at ChronicleChamber.com Category:Comics characters introduced in 1936 Category:The Phantom characters Category:Fictional kings Category:Fictional princes ","title":"Guran"},{"id":"6211251","text":"Adelfia (meaning brothers, in Greek; Barese: ) is a town and comune in the Metropolitan City of Bari, Apulia, southern Italy. The town is a combination of two smaller towns, being Montrone and Canneto. ==History== The urban center is constituted by two former villages (Canneto and Montrone) that were separated for a long time. Canneto was founded by the Normans of Robert Guiscard between 1080 and 1090, on the place of an ancient center (probably to be identified with Celiae), documented from ceramics and more recent graves from the 4th century. Montrone was founded in 980 by Greek refugees. Both had been subdued to varied feudal lords until 1806 when feudalism was abolished in the Kingdom of Two Sicilies. The two centers were united in 1927 under the artificial name of Adelfia, from the Greek term adelphòs, meaning brotherhood. Between the 19th and the 20th century, they suffered a considerable emigration towards the United States. The city life is today mainly connected to that of the nearby Bari. Adelfia has a strong Christian Catholic tradition, therefore the Adelfiesi (citizens of Adelfia) still celebrate in different moments of the year the two Saint Patrons: San Trifone (in Montrone area) and San Vittoriano (in Canneto area). The local fair, the Mass, and fireworks competition typical of these festivities bring together the citizens with thousands of pilgrims coming from all over the world. The celebrations happen respectively in November and July each year. ==References== Category:Populated places established in 1927 Category:Cities and towns in Apulia ","title":"Adelfia"},{"id":"6211261","text":"The Order' of Ethiopia (iBandla lamaTopiya) was an African religious group from the Methodist Church which originated from the Ethiopian movement started by 18th century African theologians such as Tiyo Soga, Nehemiah Tile, Mzimba, Mangena Mokoena, James Mata Dwane and others. After trying to associate themselves with the African Methodist Episcopal Church (A.M.E.) in search of establishing an authentic African Church, they ended up forming relations with the Anglican Church of the Province of Southern Africa, It was founded and initially led by James Mata Dwane. Dwane left the A.M.E church as he did not feel his episcopal status was valid, and thus along with the likes of M. Mpumlwane and Nehemiya Tile left the church. They sought talks with the Church of the Province and in 1900 a compact was signed by the seven bishops of the province to be in communion with the Ethiopian Church. This involved a decision to consecrate bishops, priest and deacons for the Order. Dwane was made a deacon in 1900, ordained as a priest in 1911 and he died in 1916 as the Provincial superior of the order a presidential title equal to that of an Anglican bishop. == End of the order == In July 1999 the provincial synod of the Church of the Province of Southern Africa was petitioned by Bishop Sigqibo Dwane, the first bishop of the order, to rescind its Canon 48, which dealt with the relations between the CPSA and the Order of Ethiopia. The order then decided, on 27 August 1999, to change its name to the Ethiopian Episcopal Church, and declared that the Ethiopian Episcopal Church was the successor in title to the Ibandla laseTiyopia / Order of Ethiopia. == Bibliography == * * Category:Anglicanism in South Africa ","title":"Order of Ethiopia"},{"id":"6211272","text":"Binetto (Barese: ) is a town and comune in the Metropolitan City of Bari, Apulia, southern Italy. ==References== Category:Cities and towns in Apulia ","title":"Binetto"},{"id":"6211280","text":"In thermodynamics, a departure function is defined for any thermodynamic property as the difference between the property as computed for an ideal gas and the property of the species as it exists in the real world, for a specified temperature T and pressure P. Common departure functions include those for enthalpy, entropy, and internal energy. Departure functions are used to calculate real fluid extensive properties (i.e. properties which are computed as a difference between two states). A departure function gives the difference between the real state, at a finite volume or non-zero pressure and temperature, and the ideal state, usually at zero pressure or infinite volume and temperature. For example, to evaluate enthalpy change between two points h(v1,T1) and h(v2,T2) we first compute the enthalpy departure function between volume v1 and infinite volume at T = T1, then add to that the ideal gas enthalpy change due to the temperature change from T1 to T2, then subtract the departure function value between v2 and infinite volume. Departure functions are computed by integrating a function which depends on an equation of state and its derivative. == General expressions == General expressions for the enthalpy H, entropy S and Gibbs free energy G are given by :\\\\frac{H^\\\\mathrm{ig}-H}{RT} = \\\\int_V^\\\\infty \\\\left[ T \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial Z}{\\\\partial T}\\\\right)_V \\\\right] \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}V}{V} + 1 - Z :\\\\frac{S^\\\\mathrm{ig}-S}{R} = \\\\int_V^\\\\infty \\\\left[ T \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial Z}{\\\\partial T}\\\\right)_V - 1 + Z\\\\right] \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}V}{V} - \\\\ln Z :\\\\frac{G^\\\\mathrm{ig}-G}{RT} = \\\\int_V^\\\\infty (1-Z) \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}V}{V} + \\\\ln Z +1 - Z == Departure functions for Peng–Robinson equation of state == The Peng–Robinson equation of state relates the three interdependent state properties pressure P, temperature T, and molar volume Vm. From the state properties (P, Vm, T), one may compute the departure function for enthalpy per mole (denoted h) and entropy per mole (s): :h_{T,P}-h_{T,P}^{\\\\mathrm{ideal}}=RT_C\\\\left[T_r(Z-1)-2.078(1+\\\\kappa)\\\\sqrt{\\\\alpha}\\\\ln\\\\left(\\\\frac{Z+2.414B}{Z-0.414B}\\\\right)\\\\right] :s_{T,P}-s_{T,P}^{\\\\mathrm{ideal}}=R\\\\left[\\\\ln(Z-B)-2.078\\\\kappa\\\\left(\\\\frac{1+\\\\kappa}{\\\\sqrt{T_r}}-\\\\kappa\\\\right)\\\\ln\\\\left(\\\\frac{Z+2.414B}{Z-0.414B}\\\\right)\\\\right] where \\\\alpha is defined in the Peng-Robinson equation of state, Tr is the reduced temperature, Pr is the reduced pressure, Z is the compressibility factor, and :\\\\kappa = 0.37464 + 1.54226\\\\;\\\\omega - 0.26992\\\\;\\\\omega^2 :B = 0.07780\\\\frac{P_r}{T_r} Typically, one knows two of the three state properties (P, Vm, T), and must compute the third directly from the equation of state under consideration. To calculate the third state property, it is necessary to know three constants for the species at hand: the critical temperature Tc, critical pressure Pc, and the acentric factor ω. But once these constants are known, it is possible to evaluate all of the above expressions and hence determine the enthalpy and entropy departures. == References == * Poling, Prausnitz, O'Connell: The Properties of Gases and Liquids, 5th Ed., McGraw- Hill, 2001. p. 6.5. * Kyle, B.G.: Chemical and Process Thermodynamics, 3rd Ed., Prentice Hall PTR, 1999. p. 118-123. ==Correlated terms== * Residual property (physics) Category:Thermodynamics Category:Fluid mechanics Category:Equations ","title":"Departure function"},{"id":"6211283","text":"Danny Sleath (born 14 December 1986, in Matlock) is an English footballer who most recently played for Conference North side Tamworth, where he played as a midfielder. ==Playing careerMansfield Town=== Born in Matlock, Derbyshire, Sleath is a graduate of the Mansfield Town youth academy and signed his first professional contract in the summer of 2006.

It has a sober façade divided by false columns with a big rose window. Of the three portals, the central one has a rich series of sculptures: two stone lions supporting columns with carved capitals showing vegetable motifs; these in turn support is a lunette with basreliefs of Christ and the twelve apostles. The frame has instead scenes from the New Testament. The interior was plastered in the 18th century, but was restored to the original Romanesque style in 1959. It has a nave and two aisles; the transept has three apses. The diocese of which the building was the cathedral was founded at some date between a bull of Pope John XIX in 1025, which does not mention it among the suffragan sees of Bari, and the bull Quia nostris temporibus of Pope Urban II in 1089, which does list it among them. Its bishop Raus, the first whose name is known, took part in the Third Lateran Council in 1179. Its last bishop died on 1 January 1798.

He sees klezmer as his \\"musical home,\\" saying \\"I can write music within klezmer, improvise, do experimental stuff, be an interpreter and a preservationist. Every side of me can be fulfilled within this form.\\" In 1996, he formed his own band Klezmer Madness! While firmly rooted in traditional klezmer folk tunes, the band \\"hurls the tradition of klezmer music into the rock era.\\" Klezmer Madness! has toured internationally to major venues and festivals including Carnegie Hall, the Library of Congress, Stanford Lively Arts, San Francisco Performances, Hancher Auditorium, the Krannert Center, the Venice Biennale, Kraków Jewish Culture Festival, BBC Proms, Saalfelden Jazz Festival, La Cigale, the Marciac festival, WOMEX, the New Morning in Paris and many others. In 2001, the rapper Socalled gave him an album that blended klezmer and hip-hop rhythms. Impressed by how \\"clever and funky it was,\\" Krakauer incorporated Socalled into Klezmer Madness!, and the group began attracting a younger audience. In 2006, Krakauer and Socalled formed the band Abraham Inc. with trombonist Fred Wesley (James Brown, Parliament Funkadelic, Count Basie Orchestra). Abraham Inc.'s music mixes klezmer, funk, and hip hop. The band has performed at The Apollo Theater and Symphony Space in New York, The Krannert Center in Illinois, Hancher Auditorium in Iowa, The Miller Outdoor Theater in Houston, The Strathmore in Maryland, Cal Performances, The Heineken Open'r Festival in Poland, The Cracow Jewish Culture Festival, the Transmusicales de Rennes, and Jazz a la Villette in Paris. Abraham Inc released the album Tweet Tweet in 2009 on Krakauer's own Table Pounding Records label. The album peaked at No. 1 in Funk and No. 1 in Jewish and Yiddish Music, and at No. 35 in music sales on Amazon. It reached No. 7 on Billboard's Jazz Chart and was featured at No. 40 on the Billboard Heatseekers Chart. In 2019, the band reunited and released a new album, Together We Stand, in response to the United States Muslim ban. Krakauer has performed with orchestras internationally including the Dresdener Philharmonie, the Pacific Symphony, the Weimar Staatskapelle, Detroit Symphony, Phoenix Symphony, Colorado Music festival orchestra, Quebec Symphony, Seattle Symphony, Amsterdam Sinfonietta, New World Symphony, Brooklyn Philharmonic, Komische Oper orchestra and the Orchestre Lamoureux. The clarinetist has also collaborated with composer Ofer Ben-Amots. Ben-Amots' composition Klezmer Concerto was specifically written for Krakauer to perform with string orchestra, harp and percussion. Other career highlights include touring with the Emerson String Quartet; performing during the inaugural season of Carnegie Hall's Zankel Hall with renowned jazz pianist Uri Caine; an eight-year tenure with the Naumburg Award-winning Aspen Wind Quintet; tours with Music from Marlboro; composing the music for Offering, an homage to the victims of September 11 by modern dance duo Eiko and Koma; numerous performances of David Del Tredici's Magyar Madness, commissioned by Music Accord for Krakauer and the Orion String quartet; and performing in the International Emmy Award-winning BBC documentary Holocaust, A Music Memorial from Auschwitz with music by Osvaldo Golijov. Krakauer also performs with South African pianist Kathleen Tagg as the Krakauer-Tagg Duo. Playwright and screenwriter Tony Kushner has said \\"Listening to David Krakauer had a tremendously powerful effect [on me]. It helped me discover Yiddish again, which was hugely important.\\" ==Osvaldo Golijov's The Dreams and Prayers of Isaac the Blind== Krakauer partnered with the Kronos Quartet for the premiere recording of Osvaldo Golijov's The Dreams and Prayers of Isaac the Blind, released in 1997 on Nonesuch Records. Though the original composition was created for clarinet with string quartet, Golijov created an orchestral arrangement for the conductor-less chamber orchestra A Far Cry. The premiere orchestral recording was created with Krakauer as featured soloist and included on A Far Cry's 2014 album Dreams & Prayers, which was nominated in the Best Chamber Music/Small Ensemble Performance category of the 57th Grammy Awards. ==The Big Picture== Krakauer's album The Big Picture, which re- imagined themes from films such as Sophie's Choice, Life is Beautiful, The Pianist, and Radio Days, was released in North America on February 18, 2014. The album received 4.5 stars from Bill Milkowski at The Absolute Sound,, 4 stars from All About Jazz, and was a DownBeat Magazine Editors' Pick. The accompanying show features original graphic projections by New York City visual-effects firm Light of Day and premiered with an eight show run at the Museum of Jewish Heritage in New York City. ==Ancestral Groove== Krakauer's album Checkpoint with his 4-piece band Ancestral Groove was released in Europe on March 3, 2014 on Label Bleu. The band supported the album with concerts throughout Europe, including a performance at the grand opening of the Museum of the History of Polish Jews on October 29, 2014. == Awards and honors == He received a Grammy nomination in 2014, a Juno nomination in 2015, the Preis der Deutschen Schallplattenkritik in 2002 and a Diapason D'Or in 1998. == Discography == * Klezmer Madness!

Founded around the 7th and 8th centuries, the village started as a Roman encampment, according to legend. It was called the \\"Castrum Maximi\\" which developed into the word Casamassima. In the old city there are walls dating well back into the early 10th century, although the first recorded document stating the presence of Casamassima is the Codice Diplomatico of 962. This dates the town to be from the Byzantium Era. Before that, however, it was probably under the control of lords from other feudal systems nearby, such as Acquaviva delle Fonti or Conversano. In 1348 it was overtaken and destroyed by Hungary's army during their campaign upon the Kingdom of Naples. Casamassima tried to resist Hungarian armies, wanting to side with the Queen of Naples, but were not strong enough. Rutigliano surrendered at first glimpse of the Hungarian soldiers and cried out obedience, but the Casamassimese were determined to fight back. The Hungarians began their siege. The men of Casamassima gathered wood and other burnable items and lit the bell tower located in the square of Casamassima ablaze. After two days the tower began to crumble and many perished. Other cities, such as Bari, Palo del Colle, and Corato did not succumb because of their usage of fortifying walls and moats. Afterwards it was rebuilt, only to then be controlled by the Principality of Taranto under the Kingdom of Naples, which eventually fell to the House of Durazzo in 1394. ==Transportation== The settlement is connected with the Bari- Putignano railroad line and the Bari-Gioia Del Colle-Taranto highway. ==See also== *Polish Cemetery at Casamassima ==References *Official website Category:Cities and towns in Apulia ","title":"Casamassima"},{"id":"6211318","text":"Cassano delle Murge (Barese: ) is a town and comune in the Metropolitan City of Bari, Apulia, southern Italy. ==Notable people== *Antonio Quatraro, European Commission official. ==References== Category:Cities and towns in Apulia ","title":"Cassano delle Murge"},{"id":"6211320","text":"Marrakesh or Marrakech is a city in Morocco, North-Western Africa.

It is the fifth and final game in the Human Grand Prix / F1 Pole Position series (with the F1 Pole Position branding skipping over the previous III and IV editions), featuring Formula One branding. F1 Pole Position 64 is based on the 1996 Formula One season, although the Japanese version did not have licenses from the FIA or the FOCA. ==Gameplay== Monaco street circuit, driven in a Ferrari F310. The game features all the tracks from the 1996 season, at a time when the racing began in Australia, and ended in Japan. Teams are set up with relevant drivers (with Jacques Villeneuve being replaced with a generic driver known as \\"Driver-X\\" due to Villeneuve not licensing his likeness), however there is a roster- feature included, which allows the player to reassign drivers to different teams (including assigning the same driver to more than one role), and even removing a real driver and replacing him with unknown drivers named \\"Driver <1~6>\\" (Driver 2's image, date of birth and nationality all match that of Ralf Schumacher, who did not begin his F1 career until ). If the player finishes overall first in the World Grand Prix mode, they can change engines between teams as well. Both driver and engine swapping will significantly affect the performance of the car. The car can be controlled with either the analog stick or D-pad on the standard Nintendo 64 controller. Weather is variable, and inclement weather can occur in the middle of a race. On the bottom left corner of the screen are different indicators for car conditions: a fuel gauge and five indicators, one for each part of the car (in order: wings, tires, suspension, brakes and gearbox), all of which change color according to the car's condition, from blue to yellow to red to flashing red. When an indicator reaches the latter, the player risks retiring from the race if it isn't fixed in time. The main Grand Prix Mode allows players to progress through the racing calendar, with each race being ten laps; there are also battle mode (single race format) and time trial modes. Battle mode allows the player to choose what drivers to race against as well as standard options like laps and weather options. The game features internal vehicle damage (see bottom left of screen shot) but no external, apart from smoke that would appear if a driver blew their engine. The game only allows players to drive by default a maximum of 10 laps on every track, however by holding down a button when one is selecting how many laps to do, the player can exceed that limit and race up to 30 laps. ==Reception== Next Generation reviewed Human Grand Prix, the Japanese version of the game, rating it two stars out of five, and stated that \\"This a game for the starving, desperate Nintendo fan who simply has to have an F1 racing game, quality be damned.

They reviewed that \\"All in all, the game will satisfy F1 enthusiasts and may even nab general racing fans as well. With all of its modification choices, tons of courses, modes of play, and real-life racers and courses, F1 is a game worth a look.\\" However, most reviewers commented that even with the improvements made for the U.S. release, the amount of pop-up is unacceptable, the controls are poor, the music is dull and generic, and the engine sounds are high-pitched and completely unrealistic. IGN and GamePro also criticized the lack of any multiplayer, though IGN and Next Generation noted that players can still compete with each other by using the Controller Pak to transfer their records. The most widespread compliment for the game was that the courses are challenging to master.

Why butterflies and moths matter: Butterflies and moths are important parts of the ecosystem. They are beautiful and inspirational and people enjoy seeing them in their gardens and the countryside. They are sensitive to change and their fortunes help us assess the health of our environment. Two-thirds of butterfly and moth species are in decline. This is a warning that cannot be ignored. Butterfly Conservation aims to maintain and enhance landscapes for butterflies and moths. The charity provides advice to landowners and managers on how to conserve and restore habitats. BC staff and volunteers work to gather extensive butterfly and moth data and conduct research to provide the scientific evidence that underpins and informs the charity's work.

Klaverjas is not the popular name of the game. Regarding different researches this name can be found on limited places /example: Vipklaverjass.nl /. The game is broadly more popular as Klaverjassen in Holland. The correct statistic between both names can be found researching with a special marketing tools. The actual relation of the search popularity Klaverjas/Klaverjassen is about 1:10. The game is closely related to the card game klaberjass, which is popular internationally and also known as Bela, and various other names. It is one of the most popular card games in the Netherlands, traditionally played in cafes and social clubs.Rules of Card Games: Klaverjas at Pagat.com The game offers a considerable level of complexity and depth. It has numerous variants, but universal fundamental rules exists. ==History== The name dates to 1890–95 from the Dutch word klaverjas, combining klaver (the suit of clubs, literally \\"clover\\") plus jas, the original name for the highest trump card.Random House Unabridged Dictionary 2006 at Dictionary.com According to Scarne,John Scarne Scarne on Card Games: How to Play and Win at Poker, Pinochle, Blackjack, Gin and Other Popular Card Games pg. 414 Dover Publications (2004) its origin has been variously claimed by the Dutch, Swiss, French, and Hungarians. However, Parlett unequivocally states that the family of games to which Klaverjas belongs originated in the Netherlands and is now most highly developed in Switzerland. ==Rules== The game is played clockwise by four players in two teams, partners sitting opposite as in whist. It uses a piquet deck, i.e. a set of 32 cards in the four French suits: Ace, King, Queen, Jack and 7–10. All cards are dealt to the players, in batches of 3–2–3 or 4–4. ===Bidding=== Starting with the elder hand, the first player prepared to do so chooses a trump suit and thereby becomes obliged to win the deal. Various versions handle the special case when all players pass differently. ===Trick-play=== As in most trick-taking games, players must follow suit if they can, and the highest trump in the trick, or in the absence of trumps the highest card in the suit of the first card, takes the trick. But there are additional restrictions on the cards that may be played. There are two variants; both agree that following a trump lead all players must head the trick if they can. Rotterdam rules: A player who cannot follow suit must trump if possible. A player who plays a trump must head the trick if possible, even if the player's partner currently heads the trick. Amsterdam rules: Undertrumping is only allowed when it cannot be avoided. A player who cannot follow suit and whose partner is not heading the trick must head the trick if possible. Aces and tens are high, i.e. cards in ordinary suits rank Ace, 10, King, Queen, Jack, 9, 8, 7. The Jack (\\"Jas\\") and nine (\\"Nel\\") in the trump suit, however, are the highest trumps. Thus trumps rank Jack, 9, Ace, 10, King, Queen, 8, 7. ===Scoring=== { border=\\"1\\" cellspacing=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"5\\" style=\\"border- collapse: collapse; text-align: center\\" align=\\"right\\" + Card values - ! efefef;\\"  Plain Suit Rank !  !

A  10  K  Q    8  7 } The point values of cards are as in Jass and Belote. In addition, the last trick (\\"Slag\\") scores 10 points. Accordingly, the card values and the last trick add up to a total of 162 points. Additional points are scored by players who have certain combinations in a single trick: Four cards of the same rank (very rare) – 100 (or 200 for four jacks), 3 or 4 consecutive cards in the same suit – 20/50, King and Queen of trumps (\\"Stuk\\") – 20. These additional points combinations are called \\"roem\\", and must be declared explicitly, otherwise they don't count. There is a reward of 100 points if the other team doesn't get any tricks. This is called a march (\\"pit\\"). At the end of each round, all points are tallied (card values and the last trick plus roem). It is up to the team of players who made the deal to win more points than the opposing team. If they obtain half of the points or less, then all points go to the opposing team (162 plus all the roem). This is called \\"nat\\". Normally the game is played over 16 rounds. At the end of the game, all points are summed up and the team who has the most points overall wins the game. ==Variants== There are a wide number of variants of the game, with different names and spellings. The South African version of the game is known as Klawerjas. ==Popular culture== It is the famous two-hand game played by the Broadway characters in Damon Runyon’s stories. ==Notes and references Bibliography == * Parlett, David (2008).

The Italian-language libretto was by Pietro Metastasio, and he described it as a componimento drammatico. This libretto had first been set by Antonio Caldara in 1735. For Gluck's rework, the piece is often considered as an azione teatrale, even though Metastasio and the composer both retained the original designation. The work was first performed for the Austrian royal family at the Schloss Hof on 24 September 1754, on the occasion of the visit of the Empress Maria Theresa to the household of Saxe- Hildburghausen.Howard, Patricia, \\"Music in London: Opera – Le cinesi\\" (September 1984).

The only other character is Lisinga’s brother Silango, who has just returned from Europe. To entertain him, they perform arias in contrasting styles: * Lisinga sings a tragic scena, as the character of Andromache. * Sivene and Silango sing a pastoral duet as shepherdess and shepherd, respectively. The two already share romantic feelings towards each other. * Tangia, who is envious of Silango's affection towards Sivene, sings a comic aria that pokes fun at a young Parisian dandy standing before a mirror, and thus indirectly satirising Sivene. The characters agree that each style has its drawbacks. The opera concludes with a ballet, The Judgment of Paris, sung as a vocal quartet. ==Recordings== * Deutsche Harmonia Mundi EL 16 9575 1: Isabelle Poulenard, Gloria Banditelli, Anne Sofie von Otter, Guy de Mey; Orchestra of the Schola Cantorum Basiliensis; René Jacobs, conductorRushton, Julian, Review of recording of Le cinesi (May 1987).

It is known for its ancient Carnival, for textile manufacturing companies and for karst caves. ==Physical Geography== Putignano rises in a hilly position in the Murgia of trulli and caves, at an altitude of 372 m s.l.m. The territory, which covers an area of 99.11 km² and has an altitude of between 293 and 456 m asl, is morphologically made up of a series of terraces composed of layers of limestone positioned on irregular levels. ==Origin of the name== There are various conjectures around the origin of the toponym: -from Potamos (river), because the city was in ancient times crossed by a canal from the ancient center of Frassineto, near Gioia del Colle; -from Puteus insanus (pit that makes folle) or from Puteus janus (in Hebrew wine), because of the ancient custom of depositing the must in the country cisterns; -from Apollo Pithunis (slayer of the snake Python) from which Pethunianum derives. This is due to the alleged presence of a sanctuary of Apollo inside a cave near Monte Laureto, a high hill in the Agro putignanese; -from Pytna, ancient center of the island of Crete, from which an ancient tribe is thought to have lived in the territory in ancient times; -from puteus (in Latin pozzo), due to the large quantity of wells present in the territory; -from an ancient noble name, Potinius, Putinius, from which the Latin form Putinianum would have derived. ==History== Putignano would have originated from an ancient Peuceta center. This is witnessed by numerous archaeological finds such as vases, coins, weapons, found in ancient burials. It is conceivable, in the absence of further evidence, that it prospered during the age of Magna Graecia, until it subsequently became a Roman municipium. The center decayed over the centuries. Around the year 1000 the territory of Putignano became the property of the Benedictine monks who resided in the Abbey of Santo Stefano di Monopoli. Since then small families of peasants began to live in the territory of Putignano in the service of the Benedictines. Over the years the population progressively increased, so that a small agricultural center was born, which developed over the centuries. The Benedictine domination dates back to some events concerning Frederick II of Swabia. He loved to hunt in the territories of Bari, in fact he also had a residence in Gioia del Colle. Putignano was also dear to him, so much so that he had a castle built immediately outside the town. Preparing to enter the city, the people of Putignano denied him access, on the advice of the Benedictines, siding with the Pope who had excommunicated the emperor. From then on his love for the city became hatred for the infidelity he suffered, destroying the castle, of which today no trace remains and severely ruining the walls. The fights of the bishop of Conversano were added to the fury of Frederick II to obtain spiritual jurisdiction over the territory. However, for a long period of time, Putignano enjoyed (as happened in the nearby city of Rutigliano) the status of ecclesia nullius diocesis, that is it did not belong to any diocese and was under the direct dependence of the Holy See. In 1317, due to some disagreements between the Benedictine monks, he handed Putignano into the hands of the order of the Knights of Jerusalem. The feud was declared a slave and whoever obtained the investiture was called Balì and had temporal and spiritual power. In this period the Adriatic coast was the victim of Turkish raids. For this reason it was decided to transfer a Byzantine icon with the effigy of the Virgin and the relics of Santo Stefano from the Abbey of Santo Stefano in Monopoli in safer territories. Putignano was chosen, where a church was built for the conservation of these objects. It is also said that on the occasion of the procession for the transfer of the relics the Propaggini celebrations originated, the opening event of the Putignano Carnival. The period of greatest splendor lived under the dominion of the Gerosolimitani or Cavalieri di Malta, was that of the Balì Carafa government. In 1472 he had a new wall built to replace the old one damaged by Frederick II. He built it larger and more imposing, with 14 round towers and 12 quadrangles, surrounded by a large moat. It also allowed the opening of a second door, Porta Barsento, in addition to the existing Porta Grande. In 1477 he completed another great work. He rebuilt the Church of San Pietro Apostolo, building it much larger and giving it a great artistic and architectural value. It was in fact the first church built in Putignano and had become small and decadent, because it dates back to the period of the first peasant nucleus of the year 1000. During the seventeenth century Putignano developed notably, becoming an important agricultural center and accumulating great wealth and works of art, kept in the numerous churches of the city and in the many convents established. At the end of the eighteenth century, however, even Putignano was victim of the requisitions of property of the French, who carried away all the church bells (except the largest of the church of San Pietro, still existing today) and numerous paintings and sacred furnishings. In 1806, three olms were planted by the French in Putignano in memory of the ideas of democracy and freedom. Of these, one is still in existence today. In the Risorgimento numerous people from Putignano joined the Garibaldi Thousand, including Captain Francesco Saverio Tateo, one of the insurgents of Villa Glori. After the unification of Italy, Putignano grew and developed. During the fascist dictatorship it was visited twice by Prince Umberto II of Savoy, a friend of the Romanazzi-Carducci family, a noble Putignanese family. Putignano reached its full development during the fifties and sixties, in which the development of the textile industry flourished and the Carnival took its current form. In addition, numerous infrastructures were built, including the hospital, which made Putignano one of the main centers of south-eastern Bari. ==EventsCarnival=== The Putignano Carnival is one of the longest in duration. In fact it starts on December 26 with the \\"Propaggini\\" event. It recalls the arrival in Putignano of the relics of Santo Stefano from the abbey of Monopoli. During this day the putignanesi perform in theatricals in the vernacular, accusing and mocking local authorities about the problems of the country that have remained unresolved. Then there are the carnival Thursdays, there are seven of them and they are counted starting from January 17 (Feast of Sant'Antonio Abate). Every Thursday is dedicated to every category of the Putignano population, which is called to celebrate the carnival, so we have Thursday: Monsignori, priests, nuns, widows and widows, Pazzi (single boys), married women, of the Cornuti (married men). The most important is that of the cuckolds, as it reminds the population that the carnival is about to end. During the horned Thursday, the \\"Accademia delle Corna\\" elects the \\"Great Horned of the Year\\" among the leading members of the population. The carnival ends on Shrove Tuesday, with the last evening parade and the carnival funeral. Famous are the papier-mâché giants, generically called \\"allegorical carts\\"; they parade during the four carnival parades, generally held on a Sunday, except on Shrove Tuesday. The Putignano Carnival is the best known of Southern Italy but also the oldest in Europe. Its first edition dates back to 1394. ==Monuments and places of interestReligious architectures=== * Chiesa di Santa Maria La Greca e di Santo Stefano protomartire e patrono con la reliquia del cranio di S.Stefano e consacrata il 28 aprile 1522; *Chiesa di Santa Maria di Costantinopoli; * Convento delle Carmelitane e annessa chiesa; * Chiesa di San Lorenzo e Madonna del Pozzo; * Cappella del Purgatorio; *Chiesa della Maddalena; *Grotta di San Michele in Monte Laureto (in periferia); * Chiesa di Santo Stefano Piccolo; * Chiesa rupestre della Madonna delle Grazie; * Chiesa dei SS.

Conspicuous is the presence of words of Greek origin, acquired during the period of the Magna Graecia and during the later Byzantine domination: Ceras (cherry), derives from εράσιον; Panar (wicker basket), derives from Παναριον; Grast (vase with plant), derives from γράστις, which means grass; Zeit (boyfriends), comes from Ζυγή, which means pair, couple. ==Movie set== Putignano was chosen as the setting for the fiction The General of the Brigands (2012) by Paolo Poeti. Some scenes were shot in the Palazzo del Balì. ==Economy== In the past, the economy of the city was principally based on agriculture, but in more recent times the population has transformed it into an industrial centre. Numerous families have founded companies in industries such as food production (taralli are one example) and the manufacture of dresses for wedding and children's religious functions. ==Culture== Putignano is well known for its Carnival, which is the oldest (dating to 1394) and longest-lasting Italian carnival, as it starts the day after Christmas and finishes the day before Ash Wednesday. There are four Carnival parades, three taking place on the last month's Sundays and one in the evening of the last day of carnival, Shrove Tuesday. As of 2005, the Carnival Foundation added a summer parade that usually takes place in July. The name of the city has also been given to an asteroid of this solar system, 7665 Putignano. ==Transport== The town is served by Putignano railway station, with regional services to Bari and Martina Franca. ==Services== In this town there is a big high school that offers three different orientations specializing students in: *classical subjects *scientific subjects *languages ==References *Official website *Carnival of Putignano *Putignano nel mondo Category:Cities and towns in Apulia ","title":"Putignano"},{"id":"6211439","text":"Lambrequin is a French word for various applications of textiles.

On 10 March 2014, Hasi replaced John van den Brom as head coach.Van den Brom makes way for Hasi at Anderlecht UEFA.com, 10 March 2014 Following two and a half seasons with the club, Hasi was sacked on 26 May 2016 after losing the league title to rivals Club Brugge. ===Legia Warsaw=== On 4 June 2016, Hasi was appointed as the new manager of Legia Warsaw. Due to poor results, Hasi was relieved of his duties on 18 September 2016 following a 2–3 league home defeat against Zagłębie Lubin. ===Olympiacos=== On 9 June 2017, Hasi was unveiled as the new manager of Greek team Olympiacos F.C., penning a two-year contract worth €600k per annum. The board chose him over other candidates based on his experience in UEFA Champions League qualifying matches, with the objective of leading the Reds to the competition's group stage after a year's absence. The feat was officially accomplished on 22 August 2017, as the team pulled off a 3–1 aggregate victory (2–1 at home and 1–0 away) over Rijeka in the competition's playoffs. Criticized for his substandard defensive coaching and man management, Hasi was relieved of his duties on 25 September 2017, due to a string of negative results including a 2–3 Champions League group stage home defeat against Sporting CP, and successive league fixtures without a win, culminating to a 3–2 away loss to arch-rivals AEK despite being 0–2 up after just over 60 minutes of play. ==Career statisticsClub=== :Source: {   - ! colspan=3  Club performance ! colspan=2  League ! colspan=2  Cup ! colspan=2  League Cup ! colspan=2  Continental ! colspan=2  Total - !

He was later the United States National Security Advisor from 1977 to 1981, under the administration of President Jimmy Carter. Regarding the landmass of Eurasia as the center of global power, Brzezinski sets out to formulate a Eurasian geostrategy for the United States. In particular, he writes that no Eurasian challenger should emerge that can dominate Eurasia and thus also challenge U.S. global pre-eminence. Much of Brzezinski's analysis is concerned with geostrategy in Central Asia, focusing on the exercise of power on the Eurasian landmass in a post-Soviet environment. In his chapter dedicated to what he refers to as the \\"Eurasian Balkans,\\" he uses Halford J. Mackinder's Heartland Theory.

It is part of the Murge karst landscape. ==Geography and territory== Ruvo's territory is known for its vineyards, olive groves and sowable fields, and is one of the largest in the province of Bari. Its wooded area is very interesting, with many downy oak trees (Quercus pubescens). Ruvo's territory consists of the Italian Alta Murgia National Park and shows typical elements of the Apulian karst landscape: sinkholes, karst valleys also known as \\"lame\\", among which are the upper course of Lama Balice and various caves. Two important caves are the \\"Grave della Ferratella\\" (the deepest cave in the Apulia region), and the nearby \\"Abisso di Notarvincenzo\\" (the deepest in Ruvo). They are located near the wide and green Ferratella \\"Lama\\" (valley) which must be considered as the Gate of the National Park of Alta Murgia. ==History== Fresco of dancing Peucetian women in the Tomb of the Dancers, fourth or fifth century BC The most ancient archaeological findings from the area date to the 9th century BC, when the Peucetians were settled in the area. Evidence of their presence is documented through a series of remains, most notably the fresco found in the Tomb of the Dancers. The fresco, which depicts peucetian women dancing, is one of the most important archeological findings in Ruvo and is now exhibited in the Naples National Archeological Museum. In the 3rd century BC, after peacefully succumbing to greek rule and falling under Athenian patronage, Ruvo flourished: the now polis engaged in commerce with the rest of Greater Greece, Greece and most of the Pre-Roman civilizations in italy and had power and strength to never be seen again. With the Greek demise, it naturally fell under Roman rule. Under the Roman Empire it was first a military stronghold and later a municipium, but during the Imperial times it started to lose power and importance. After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, it went under the Byzantines tutelage, then the Saracens and the Normans. Later Ruvo became part of the county of Conversano. After the Aragonese and French dominations it was a fief of the Carafa family, until the abolition of feudalism in 1806. ==Main sights== The Clock Tower, in the Historic Center The Remains of Ruvo's Castle in Matteotti Square Ruvo's historic center is one of the most important historical centers in Apulia. During the course of history, it was destroyed three times. In Ruvo's Historic Center there are buildings and sites that hold historical and archeological importance, such as the Cathedral, the remains of Ruvo's Castle, Palazzo Caputi, Palazzo Spada, Palazzo and Museum Jatta, Palazzo Avitaja, the Redentore Church, the Purgatory Church, the Ipogeo under the Cathedral with remains of the Paleo-Christian church and Roman Tombs, the Clock Tower, the Dante Alighieri Park, the Matteotti Square, Cavour Street, Giovanni Jatta Street, the remains of the medieval defensive walls with the towers, Vittorio Veneto Street, Cathedral Street, Madonna of Calentano Church (in the countryside, in the hamlet of Calentano). Cathedral of Ruvo di Puglia The Cathedral is a prime example of Apulian Romanesque architecture. The façade has three portals and numerous decorations, depicting Catholic symbols that traditionally belong to the Christian allegory, as well as griffins and other mythical figures. There are two rose windows. The interior has a nave and two aisles ending with a transept. Among the numerous works of art are a wooden statue and the reliquary of Saint Blaise, a fresco portraying the Madonna and Child with St. Sebastian, a panel of the Virgin of Constantinople and a noteworthy wooden cross. Under the church are the remains of the Palaeo- Christian church and Roman tombs. The Jatta Museum (In Italian: Palazzo Jatta)The Jatta Museum is the only Italian museum to have a private family collection dating back to 1800. It conserves and exhibits to this day the vases, tools and remains excavated by the Jatta Family. The most notable item is the Vase of Talos, the most famous in the entire collection.

The SMLLatest draft of the SML specification specification defines model concepts, and the SML-IFLatest draft of the SML-IF specification specification describes a packaging format for exchanging SML- based models. SML and SML-IF were standardized in a W3C working group chartered to produce W3C Recommendations for the Service Modeling Language by refining the “Service Modeling Language” (SML) Member Submission,“Service Modeling Language” (SML) Member Submission addressing implementation experience and feedback on the specifications. The submission was from an industry group consisting of representatives from BEA Systems, BMC, CA, Cisco, Dell, EMC, HP, IBM, Intel, Microsoft, and Sun Microsystems. They were published as W3C Recommendations on May 12, 2009.SML and SML-IF Recommendation Press Release In the market and in applying by vendors, SML is seen as a successor/replacement for earlier developed standards like DCML and Microsoft's (in hindsight) proprietary System Definition Model or SDM. See http://download.microsoft.com/documents/uk/msdn/architecture/infrastructure/infrastructure_and_business_priorities.ppt Powerpoint relating SDM and DCML for a historically helpful relation between SDM and DCML, and http://www.hp.com/hpinfo/newsroom/press/2006/060731b.html?jumpid=reg_R1002_USEN Joint press release about SML for the joint pressrelease announcing SML. In the Microsoft section of it the sequel role to SDM is mentioned. == Fast Formal Facts about SML == The Service Modeling Language (SML) is a language for building a rich set of constructs for creating and constraining models of complex IT services and systems. SML-based models could include information about configuration, deployment, monitoring, policy, health, capacity planning, target operating range, service level agreements, and so on. An SML model is a set of interrelated XML documents. An SML model could contain information about the parts of an IT service, as well as the constraints that each part must satisfy for the IT service to function properly. Constraints are captured in two ways: ; XML Schema documents : constrain the structure and content of the XML instance documents in a model. SML uses XML Schema 1.0, but allows later versions as well. SML also defines a set of extensions to XML Schema to constrain references, and identity constraints (key, unique, ...) that apply to sets of documents. ; Rule documents : constrain the structure and content of documents in a model. SML uses Schematron and XPath 1.0 for rules, but allows later versions as well. Once a model is defined, one of the important operations on the model is to establish its validity. This involves checking whether all model documents satisfy the XML Schema and rule document constraints. ==SML-Based Models== One anticipated use for SML is to define a consistent way to express how computer networks, applications, servers and other IT resources are described or modeled so businesses can more easily manage the services that are built on these resources.Common Model Library - link no longer resolves This enables a hierarchy of IT resource models to be created from reusable building blocks rather than requiring custom descriptions of every service, thus reducing costs and system complexity for customers. Models provide value in several important ways: # Models focus on capturing all invariant aspects of a service/system that must be maintained for the service/system to be functional. They capture as much detail as is necessary, and no more. # Models are units of communication and collaboration between designers, implementers, operators, and users; and can easily be shared, tracked, and revision controlled. This is important because complex services are often built and maintained by a variety of people playing different roles. # Models drive modularity, Re-use, and standardization. Most real-world complex services and systems are composed of sufficiently complex parts. Re-use and standardization of services/systems and their parts is a key factor in reducing overall production and operation cost and in increasing reliability. # Models represent a powerful mechanism for validating changes before applying the changes to a service/system. Also, when changes happen in a running service/system, they can be validated against the intended state described in the model. The actual service/system and its model together enable a self-healing service/system – the ultimate objective. Models of a service/system must necessarily stay decoupled from the live service/system to create the control loop. # Models enable increased automation of management tasks. Automation facilities exposed by the majority of IT services/systems today could be driven by software – not people – for reliable initial realization of a service/system as well as for ongoing lifecycle management. ==References * W3C Service Modeling Language Working Group home page * W3C public working drafts of SML/SML-IF specification Category:XML markup languages ","title":"Service Modeling Language"},{"id":"6211465","text":"Sammichele di Bari (Barese: ) is a town and comune in the Metropolitan City of Bari and region of Apulia, southern Italy.

Kasser received his Ph.D. in Psychology from the University of Rochester in 1994, and after one additional year of teaching at Montana State University, he accepted a position at Knox College in Galesburg, Illinois, where he was a professor of psychology. He retired from Knox in 2019 and was named Emeritus Professor. He has authored over 120 scientific articles and book chapters on materialism, values, goals, well-being, and environmental sustainability, among other topics. His first book, The High Price of Materialism, was published in 2002 (); his second book (co-edited with Allen D. Kanner), Psychology and Consumer Culture, was released in 2004. In 2009 he co-authored a book (with Tom Crompton) Meeting Environmental Challenges: The Role of Human Identity. In 2013 he wrote Lucy in the Mind of Lennon, a psychological biography that explores the meaning of John Lennon's song, Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds. Most recently, in 2018, he collaborated with the cartoonist Larry Gonick on HyperCapitalism: The modern economy, its values, and how to change them. Kasser's books have been translated into 7 languages. Since the early 2000s, Kasser has consulted with activist and civil-society organizations who work against the commercialization of children and who work towards a more inwardly rich lifestyle than what is offered by consumerism.

Spence was born in Newport, Kentucky to Philip and Virginia (Berry) Spence. He was graduated from the University of Cincinnati in 1894 with a degree in law and was admitted to the bar that same year. He married Ida Bitterman on September 6, 1919. He was very active in local and state politics, serving first in the Kentucky Senate, 1904–1908, then as city solicitor of Newport, 1916-1924. In 1930 he was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives from the 5th District; he held this position from March 4, 1931 until January 3, 1963 when most of his district was merged with the neighboring 4th District of fellow Democrat Frank Chelf. He lost the ensuring primary to Chelf. At the time of his retirement, Spence was one of the oldest members to serve in the House; he was 88 years old at the end of his career. Spence chaired the U.S. House Banking and Currency Committee (1943–1963, except for four years when Republicans controlled Congress). He was a delegate to the 44-nation Bretton Woods Conference in 1944, to promote fair commerce. This led to creating the International Monetary Fund and Bank, and Spence's sponsoring legislation in Congress. Spence was a strong supporter of the New Deal and the Fair Deal. During President Roosevelt's administration, he supported the Agricultural Adjustment Act, the National Industrial Recovery Act, the Social Security Act, and the Reconstruction Finance Corporation. While Spence did not sign the 1956 Southern Manifesto and voted in favor of the 24th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, he voted against of the Civil Rights Acts of 1957 and 1960. Altogether Spence was a quiet man, who was not a good public speaker. However, he was known for his impartial leadership and could get critical legislation passed. His background in banking is credited for leading him to sponsor the Export-Import Federal Deposit Insurance Act, which doubled insured savings accounts from $5,000 to $10,000. The Brent Spence Bridge of I-75/I-71 which crosses the Ohio River at Covington, Kentucky is named for him. He resided in Fort Thomas, Kentucky at the time of his death.

The show was produced from Nine's Richmond studios in Melbourne. Its main Director was Rick Maslan. Quizmania was first broadcast live on Nine Network stations GTV, TCN, QTQ, and NTD, and affiliates NBN and WIN Television on 25 July 2006. The show was unique in that it was broadcast live to South Australia, Western Australia, and Northern Territory with the presenters welcoming all three states to the show half an hour after it started, due to all three states being thirty minutes behind the Australian east coast. Similarly during daylight saving months, Queensland viewers were welcomed an hour later when the broadcast began in that state. Sometimes due to varying program schedules in each capital city or regional area, some cities and/or areas did not broadcast Quizmania while other cities and/or areas still received the broadcast. Only contestants aged 18 or over were allowed to participate. Underage callers were a regular occurrence on the show especially during school holidays. ==Programme history== When it first aired on Tuesday 25 July 2006, Quizmania was to soon run in direct competition with the established The Up-Late Game Show on Channel Ten, returning a week later on Monday 31 July, after the 2006 Big Brother series had ended with its UpLate late-night show finished. A few days after, Seven Network introduced a similar phone-in quiz show, Midnight Zoo. Both competing programmes soon ceased broadcasting – Midnight Zoo only lasted three months. Quizmania remained on air for the longest period. During the 2007 Big Brother series, Quizmania faced competition with the return of the UpLate program (see Notable dates). ==Axing== The show's contract with the Nine Network was not renewed, and the announcement to staff of the end of production was made on 31 May 2007. The 207th and final show was broadcast live on 24 June 2007. Quizmania was replaced by The Mint on 31 July, another quiz show once again taking its title from a UK quiz show of the same name. It was produced solely by the Nine Network, discontinuing the association with Fremantle Media. ==Hosts== Quizmania originally started out with three hosts, Nikki Osborne, Amy Parks and Brodie Young. In early January 2007, Katrina Conder and Suze Raymond were added to the lineup. On 12 May 2007, Nikki Osborne hosted her last Quizmania show after she announced a few days earlier that she was leaving to work on the new Channel Nine show The Nation with Mick Molloy. Amy now works as a news reporter on Seven News Melbourne. Two hosts appeared on weekday episodes. On Fridays and Saturdays there were three hosts due to the four-hour running time. ==Games== Some of the games played on Quizmania include: ===Tower game=== This game was created by Quizmania in Britain. It consisted of seven blank spaces increasing in value, ranging from anywhere up to $500. At the top of the tower was either be a phrase with a missing word or a topic to guess. For example, one game could be HOT _____, viewers could call in and guess hot weather, hot water, hot pants, etc. Alternatively, the game could be \\"Boys Names Beginning With T\\" and viewers could call and guess Trevor, Timothy, Thierry, etc. Games of this type came under particular criticism because they appeared specifically designed so as not to have any solid 'right or wrong' type answers. For example, the viewers might simply be asked to \\"name a rock band\\", while a graphic will appear on screen with 10 spaces to represent the 10 bands that need to be named. The problem with this is that there is no way to verify in advance what bands were actually on the list - essentially, it was down to the discretion of the Quizmania team to declare which bands are and are not on the list. ===Word Search game=== Viewers were to find a certain type of word in a grid. Words were written horizontally, vertically, diagonally or also back-to-front. Words found in the grid normally won the player $50. ===Beat the Break=== Before January 2007, a game took place during the ad-breaks, where they gave the viewers a multiple choice question with two silly answers and the correct answer. Viewers then had to call in during the ad-breaks and, if they gave the correct answer, won $50. ===The Quizmania Gold Mine=== This game was first introduced on 4 April 2007 and had two parts to it. The first part is where a viewer calls up and correctly answers a dingbat, a graphic on the screen which features a picture of two different objects (for example, a car and a set of keys). The viewer had to say the correct answer (car keys) to receive $50. Then the viewer got to pick from a wall of 15 gold cards pinned to it numbered from 1 to 15. Some had no prizes behind them, others had Savvytel starter kits (mobile phone credit) or minor cash prizes but only one has the \\"Gold Mine\\" which jackpots after each unsuccessful caller until someone picked the numbered card with the \\"Gold Mine\\" on it. After that, a tower game was played for the remainder of the episode. ==Incentives== Periodically, an incentive to call in was displayed on the screen. One or more incentives may have been offered at any one time. These included: *A bonus offer, when the next caller or callers would be offered a certain amount of extra cash if they say a correct answer. *A \\"speed round\\", where many calls are taken with reduced banter. *Caller countdown clocks, where a countdown timer was placed on the screen and the host mentioning that a call would be taken any time from now until the clock hits zero (the length of the countdown clock varied from three minutes to fifteen seconds). *Double, triple or quadruple the normal amount of money on offer. *A second guess, where if the first answer mentioned by a caller was wrong, they got to say another answer (this offer was very rare). *A caller or callers will receive $50 just for getting through to the studio even if they got the answer wrong (this offer was very rare). *The possibility of receiving a Savvytel mobile phone starter kit with $20 credit (usually given away at random if the producers like the answer given but is not an answer in the current game). ==Notable dates== {  !

Most of the time, the problem was fixed within 5–10 minutes and the show resumed where it dropped off from. There have also been a couple of serious technical problems which have forced Quizmania to cease for the night and be replaced with other programming. ===Severe technical problems=== Nikki Osborne and Amy Parks co-hosting while the phones were down. On 3 August 2006, the show experienced severe technical problems resulting in the current quiz being postponed several times, and presenters Nikki Osborne and Amy Parks ad-libbed for the duration of the breakdown. The show was delayed and alternative programming (two episodes of The Drew Carey Show) was shown instead. On 11 January 2007, the show experienced severe technical problems again, resulting in the quiz being postponed several times. Again, Nikki Osborne and the production crew ad-libbed through the breakdown, reminding viewers to not call until the problem was fixed. At one stage when the problem appeared to have been fixed and the competition resumed, one woman who called through and gave a correct answer was disconnected before she could give her details to producers. This required Osborne to tell her, on the air, to ring the Quizmania office at Channel Nine the next day to receive her $500 winnings. The show was suspended again, and alternative programming was eventually shown at approximately 1.30am with Eve followed by The Avengers. ==See also== * The Up-Late Game Show * Midnight Zoo ==ReferencesOfficial Quizmania MySpace page * Quizmania Fansite * Category:2006 Australian television series debuts Category:2007 Australian television series endings Category:Australian game shows Category:2000s Australian game shows Category:English-language television shows Category:Nine Network original programming Category:Phone-in quiz shows Category:Television shows set in Melbourne Category:Television series by Fremantle (company) ","title":"Quizmania (Australian game show)"},{"id":"6211559","text":"Taj Mihelich (born 31 August 1973 in Ann Arbor, Michigan) is a World Champion American Freestyle BMX rider.

After years riding for the company Hoffman Bikes, he started Terrible One with Joe Rich, by releasing the \\"Barcode\\" bike frame, largely based on Taj's signature bike design at Hoffman Bikes. It was rumored that Taj was displeased with the way that his signature frame was holding up after Hoffman Bikes moved their manufacturing overseas, and that he didn't want his name attached to something that he felt was of substandard quality. Taj was also sponsored by Etnies, where he designed several signature shoes as well as appearing in the widely recognized \\"Forward\\" video featuring the Etnies BMX team. In late March 2006, via the company's website, Taj announced that he would be leaving his half of Terrible One to Joe Rich.

She was known to have 2 golden rings that \\"disappeared\\" from her tray. The rumors of the school being haunted, strange things happening around 4:44 AM and the disappearance of children soon emerge, but Mika's older sister and her friends decide to go after Mika despite this.

Tsunemitsu originally began his focus on ghost stories around town, but found an unusually large amount of them centered on school. He began to narrow his focus to school-based ghost stories, and asked his students for them, which led to his receiving over 160 stories in two weeks. In 1990, the first volume of these stories by Tsunemitsu was released under the title Gakkō no Kaidan. The stories were aimed at children and published by Kodansha and became very popular in Japan. The stories were later adapted into television where they were bought by Kansai Television who televised a six episode miniseries in 1994.

The parish evolved from the medieval manors of Brembreste (Bramshott today), Lidessete (Ludshott), Ciltelelei (Chiltlee), the royal forest of Woolmer and fragments of two other manors. Bramshott Manor is described in the Domesday Book as held by Edward of Salisbury from the king with two freemen, thirteen tenants (of restricted freedom) and two mills. Ludshott Manor, lying to the north of Bramshott Manor, is recorded with four tenants and a mill. Chiltlee Manor lay to the south of Bramshott Manor and was recorded as being held by the king, William the Conqueror, with four tenants and land for two ploughs, worth fifty three shillings (£2.65). These four manors lay on the edge of the royal forest of Woolmer, with the origins of Liphook perhaps built as smallholdings to serve huntsmen. The village grew until the 14th century but was checked by the Black Death. It seems some people escaped from the manors to Liphook to evade taxes of the Lord. Since the 16th century development of Bramshott has been intertwined with that of Liphook. Military Cemetery, Bramshott St. Mary's Church holds the graves of 318 Canadian soldiers stationed at nearby Bramshott Camp during the First World War, including many victims of the influenza outbreak of 1918-20. Part of the ancient parish of Bramshott used to be in the county of Sussex, comprising an irregularly shaped protrusion of that county's territory containing Holly Hills and Griggs Green. This reached as far north as the lake at Canforth Park Farm.Book of Reference to the Plan of the Parish of Bramshott in Sussex, Ordnance Survey 1874 In addition Bramshott had a small enclave within Sussex, comprising Croft House Farm near Folly Mere.Ordnance Survey 6 inch sheet XLIV surveyed 1870 ==Environment== Bramshott Chase is an area of National Trust woodland adjacent to the London-Portsmouth Road popular for walking. ==Notable people== The actor Boris Karloff, born William Henry Pratt in London, lived in retirement in Bramshott until his death in 1969. ==ReferencesFurther reading== * * * ==External links== * Anglican Churches of St Mary, Bramshott and Liphook Church Centre (link inactive November 2014) * Historical information and links on GENUKI Category:Villages in Hampshire ","title":"Bramshott"},{"id":"6211625","text":"Location of Bardejov District in the Nitra region.

Ascoli Satriano (known as Asculum) was a city of the Dauni. It was then a small cluster of habitations in a wider network of scattered villas. The economy was operated by slave labour and focused on grain cultivation. Ascoli Satriano was the site of two early Roman battles (see Battle of Asculum).Information about this war can be found in Plutarch's Lives (Pyrrus 2 1), Polybius, Dionysius of Halicarnassus (XX 1—3), and Livy. Later Sulla established a military colony there. As the Western Roman Empire began to collapse in the fourth and fifth centuries, many of the surrounding farms were abandoned with a retraction of cultivation and a re-growth of woodlands. In the mid-9th century the Saracens razed the city. In 1040 it rebelled against the Byzantines and, the following year, a decisive battle was fought nearby which granted the Normans control over southern Italy. An earthquake in 1456 totally destroyed Ascoli Satriano, and forced relocation of the surviving inhabitants to the site of the current town. Re-growth of the town however was interrupted by periodic outbreaks of plague and typhus into the early 19th Century. From the end of the nineteenth century the Ascoli Satriano was affected by increasing emigration to the Americas, reaching a peak between 1903 and 1914, stopping during the periods of the First World War and Italian fascism. After the bombing of Foggia in 1943, Ascoli Satriano was freed by British and American forces. Ascoli Satriano was mentioned by the Irish writer James Joyce in his novel Ulysses. After the Second World War, Ascoli Satriano, close to Cerignola, was the center of significant labor struggles against landlordism, sharecropping and low wages, and strikes, demonstrations and land occupations became frequent. Trade unionists and politicians made passionate speeches to organize to support the demands of the working classes in Piazza Cecco d'Ascoli (today Piazza Giovanni Paolo II). == Main sights == *The Romanesque-Gothic Cathedral (12th century) *Church of St. John the Baptist (12th century) *Church of the Incoronata (15th century) *The Museum Center of Ascoli Satriano houses the Marbles of Ascoli Satriano, a set of marble artifacts from the 4th century BCE believed to been taken from a tomb of an elite prince of the region. == People== *Biagio Ciotto, American politician. *Michele Placido, actor and film director == References  *The Museum Center of Ascoli Satriano * A late Roman villa at Faragola (Ascoli Satriano), ITALY Dipartimento di Scienze Umane, Area di archeologia - Università degli Studi di Foggia.

Spataro was born in Vasto, Italy to Anna and Alfonso Nasci, who were a high-class Italian family, in the urban center within the province Chieti. After studying in his birth city of Vasto, Spataro transferred to a boarding school called Montecassino in 1908, the adjustment to this new life made easier by the death of his father in 1910. In 1914, Spataro incepted his time at Facolta di Giurisprudenza in Rome, and earned his diploma in 1919. During the First World War, Spataro served as a \\"corpo specializzato del Genio, later to be promoted as an official. Already distinguished within the main catholic- roman journalist firms, he became an exponent member of FUCI. In 1919, he was elected vice president, later advanced as president of FUCI in 1920. Following his presidency at FUCI, Spataro was elected vice-president at another organization called Pax Romana. Eventually, Spataro’s close relations with Luigi Sturzo- led to his membership to the Roman sector of the Partito Popolare Italiano, or the Italian Popular Party in 1919. From 1921 to 1925, Spataro served as the sole national vice-secretary. In 1923, Spataro married Letizia De Giorgio, and later had 3 children: Alfonso, Anna and PierGiorgio. Following his marriage, in June 1925, Spataro became the principal organizer of the international “V” congress of the party. Soon after, from 1945-1946, he became the vice secretary of internal affairs, in 1946, he was elected member of the National council and president of RAI. Through his control of this radio, and then television programming, Spataro was able to create the basis for his future Democratic-Christian control over the media. He held this post, until 1950, when he stepped down as president of RAI to assume position as minister of communications. In 1953, Spataro became minister of social work, and between 1953-1954, Spataro rose as vice secretary of the Partito Popolare. In 1960, he became the minister of “Marina mercantile” and the minister of internal affairs as well as the minister of transportation. In 1959, Spataro resumed his work as minister of telecommunications until 1962. Between 1964 until his death in 1979, Spataro served as president of the Istituto Luigi Sturzo, in Rome, Italy. ==Timeline== 12 June 1897 Spataro is born in Vasto 1908 Goes to boarding school, Montecassino for further studies 1910 Father, Alfonso Nasci dies 1914 Attends Facolta di Giurisprudenza (law school) in Rome 1919 Receives degree in law 1920 Elected president of FUCI 1921 Elected President of Pax Romana 1923 Marries Letizia De Giorgio 1924-1925 Serves as sole vice president and representative of the company which manages publications of ”Il Popolo” June 1925 Spataro chosen as principal organizer of the international “V Congress” of the Partito Popolare 1945-1946 Spataro serves as vice internal affairs secretary 1946 -Becomes member of National Council and is nominated president of RAI 1950-1953 Becomes minister of telecommunications 1953-1954 Appointed minister of social work and vice secretary of the Partito Popolare 1958-1959 Becomes minister of “Marina mercantile” 1960 Appointed Minister of Transportation 1960-1962 Became minister of telecommunications (again) 1964-1979 Served as President of the Istituto Luigi Sturzo 1979 Died in Rome == References == *1945 CARLO TRABUCCO, La prigionia di Roma: diario dei 268 giorni dell'occupazione tedesca, Roma, Edizioni SELI. *1979 GABRIELE DE ROSA, Giuseppe Spataro.

The game was developed by Probe Entertainment for Microsoft Windows and PlayStation and Iguana Entertainment UK for the Nintendo 64 and published by Acclaim Entertainment. A remastered version was released in 2018 for Microsoft Windows, macOS, Linux and Xbox One. ==Gameplay== Forsaken is primarily a multiplayer first-person shooter. The game may be played in single-player or multiplayer modes. The game is based on a 3D-engine that allows unlimited 360-degree movements. ===Single-player=== The single-player mode has four difficulty modes: easy, normal, hard and total mayhem. Each has progressively stronger enemies and less ammo to spare. Due to the near-impossible challenge presented by the latter mode, Acclaim provided the patch 1.00 that (among other things) decreased the difficulty of the game dramatically. There are 15 levels which have to be completed by the player — sometimes within a time limit — and occasionally include a huge end-boss against which the player must exhaust a fair amount of ammunition while dodging excessive retaliatory fire. In order to complete a mission, different efforts must be made by the player such as finding the exit or activating triggers to open locked doors. The primary objective is to destroy the enemies within a level. The enemies are static (turrets launching homing missiles, drones, other mercenaries, etc.), though not all will be spawned at the start of a level. Each level includes a hidden crystal, and once all are collected a secret map is unlocked. ===Multiplayer=== There are six different types of multiplayer games: Free For All (deathmatch), Team Game, Capture The Flag, Flag Chase, Bounty Hunt, and Team Bounty Hunt. There are various sub-options for each. ==Plot== In the distant future, the advancement of science has exceeded humanity's ability to control it. During a subatomic experiment, an accident causes an uncontrollable fusion reaction, utterly destroying the surface of the planet Earth. One year later, Earth has been classified as \\"condemned\\" by the ruling imperial theocracy, meaning that it is now legal for anyone to salvage anything left on the planet. Mercenaries from all over come to raid the dead planet, forced to battle not only each other, but the robot sentinels that the government has left behind. ==Development== The game was developed by Probe Entertainment during the 1996–1998 period as the company became merged into its parent company (Acclaim). At that time, Microsoft's newly bought and re- branded rendering layer (DirectX) had just started to dominate PC development. Fergus McGovern headed the development team. The game was heavily technology driven at the beginning and was titled ProjectX. This was changed to Condemned when the story elements were added although it was later changed to Forsaken due to a potential naming conflict. A Sega Saturn version of the game was announced, but cancelled as part of Acclaim's general withdrawal of support for the system. Due to the heavy technology focus of the game it was often bundled with hardware to show off the cards and was used as a benchmark for many years after the initial release of the game. This game has an ESRB rating of \\"M for Mature\\". It was so rated for violent deaths in the introductory cutscene and the player character's death. The Swarm (Dominic Glynn and Stephen Root) performed and produced the Forsaken soundtrack which features dynamic drum and bass and electronica tracks. An album featuring many of the original tracks and remixes, was released on No Bones Records. Various employees of Acclaim Studios Teesside, the developer who worked on the Nintendo 64 port of the game, made plans for a sequel to Forsaken, which were permanently scrapped when Acclaim closed the studio down in 2002. ==Reception== The Nintendo 64 version of Forsaken received \\"generally favorable reviews\\" according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. Edge stated that, although the PlayStation version feels familiar to Descent, it refined and updated the formula with features such as its auto-levelling system and orientation aid. In Japan, where the PlayStation version was ported for release and published by Acclaim Japan on 2 September 1999,, Famitsu gave it a score of 24 out of 40. Hyper gave the game 92% and said, \\"Unless someone pulls some wonder game out of the bag at E3, this one looks like it's going to be the all-formats game of the year. If you like action shooter games, this is a must-have.\\" N64 Magazine gave it 87% and said it was \\"certainly the N64's best 'serious' game since GoldenEye,\\" and \\"a game that, although not for the fainthearted, holds a genuinely rewarding experience for those who are prepared to persevere.\\" Next Generation reviewed the Nintendo 64 version of the game, rating it three stars out of five, and stated that \\"Overall, this is solid, enjoyable stuff with not a hint of originality to cloud the fun.\\" Next Generation reviewed the PlayStation version of the game, rating it three stars out of five, and stated that \\"All in all, this is a decent title. Probe has mixed together the best elements of Descent and Quake and added some pretty tricky enemy AI, resulting in a game that shines, although in slightly different ways, on each platform.\\" Next Generation reviewed the PC version of the game, rating it three stars out of five, and stated that \\"Forsaken is a good game that will provide a nice distraction until players get their hands on the big guns like Sin, Half-Life, and Duke Nukem Forever.\\" ==References * Official website for remastered version * Category:1998 video games Category:Acclaim Entertainment games Category:Cancelled Sega Saturn games Category:Commercial video games with freely available source code Category:Dystopian video games Category:First-person shooters Category:Linux games Category:macOS games Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:Nintendo 64 games Category:PlayStation (console) games Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom Category:Video games with 6 degrees of freedom Category:Video games with variable translation control Category:Windows games Category:Xbox One games Category:Zero-G shooters ","title":"Forsaken (video game)"},{"id":"6211708","text":"Broome Pearling Lugger Pidgin is a pidgin that sprang up in Broome, Western Australia in the early 20th century to facilitate communication between the various groups working in the pearling industry there—Japanese, Malays, Torres Strait Islanders, Koepangers, Hakka Chinese, Filipinos, a small number of Koreans, and local Indigenous Australians, mainly of the Bardi people but also Nyulnyul, Jabirr Jabirr, Jukun, Yawuru and Karajarri people.

These are now housed in the Aiani Archaeological Museum. The excavations in the city of Aiani, brought to light the oldest pieces of matt-painted (black and white) pottery ever found. Some of the matt-painted pottery dates back to the 15th-14th century BC (Μycenaean era). Amongst the archaic pottery, some of the oldest samples of writing were found.

It is about an agency - existing out of time and whose members are dead - which police the multiverse of parallel realities. ==Plot== Indigo Prime is an extra-dimensional agency dedicated to the maintenance and repair of breaks and distortions across the multiverse. However, they're not above making a few 'alterations' for any rich clientele that approach them (although it appears that this is never at the expense of the harmony of the multiverse itself). Their base of operations exists outside the multiverse and time itself in a hypothetical 'nullzone', which every event in time and space throughout the multiverse transects. All Indigo Prime agents are chosen, upon their death, based on the presence of a certain gene (the \\"Rembrant Index\\") that occurs in one in twelve million people across the multiverse; given a new body, and then trained in a range of abilities to assist them in their job. Each agent also specializes in a role - known job descriptions are: Sceneshifters (who manipulate the physical world), Seamsters (who deal mainly with time) and Imagineers (who can influence minds and dreams). ==Characters== * Major E. Kurtz Arcana – Director * Clive Vista – Director ;Current, active agents * Redman and Dak – Danny Redman is Indigo Prime's newest recruit; a young British soldier resurrected for service when his reality's humankind was wiped out by a global plague of deadly mushroom spores; a plague deliberately engineered by a race of underground-dwelling Neanderthals. Unthur Dak is one of these Neanderthals, an Indigo Prime agent who had spent decades in 'deep cover' and rejoins the agency to act as Danny's handler. * Winwood and Cord – Respectively, Max and Ishmael. 'Seamsters'. * Crippen and Kiss – 'Imagineers'. Mariah Kiss is a powerful empath and psychic. Hawley Crippen may be the notorious murderer himself, or an alternate world version. * William S.

The Brussels Journal bills itself as a member of the OpinionJournal Federation but does not appear among the list of members on OpinionJournal's own site.

Beliën removed the article. The article has been noted as an important event in the development of a harsher climate towards immigrants in Belgium.

Written in 1980, it is an intricate fresco of Communist Romania and the horrors of the Stalinist era. The book's overt depiction of political repression at an early stage of Communist rule was allowed to pass through censorship following the change in tone to more nationalist and anti-Soviet attitudes under Nicolae Ceauşescu. A screen version of the book, directed by Șerban Marinescu and starring Ștefan Iordache in the role of Petrini, was released in 1993. ==Plot summary== A long epic, written in first-person, Cel mai iubit... is the life-story confession of a prisoner waiting for his trial. Victor Petrini, a promising intellectual in the 1950s and a lecturer in Philosophy, seduces his best friend's wife, Matilda, who eventually becomes his wife. Nonetheless, and despite the birth of their daughter, the sexual attraction between them is exhausted shortly after their wedding. Victor is arrested by the repressive secret police (the Securitate), wrongly accused of being connected to a terrorist organisation, and sentenced to prison and forced labor - the verdict constitutes a brutal end to all his projects and ideals. During his several-year-long confinement, at first in the Romanian version of the Gulag, then on a lead mine in the Northern Carpathians, he is divorced and forsaken by his wife, and hardens his character in order to survive. Eventually, he even manages to attack and kill one of the torturers engaged in his re-education (a crime which is successfully hidden from the authorities). Once released, Petrini has to start back from zero. He gets a job as pest controller (killing rats) and accommodates to a new, proletarian and suburban existence. A few years later, he manages to obtain employment as a bookkeeper in a state-owned company, where he meets Suzy, with whom he falls in love. Shortly after, in self-defence, he kills Suzy's ex-husband by throwing him out from a cable railway, and has to return to jail. ==References== * ==External links== * *Romanian literature Category:1980 novels Category:Romania in fiction Category:Romanian novels Category:Novels set in Romania ","title":"Cel mai iubit dintre pământeni"},{"id":"6211789","text":"Ghayth Armanazi (born 1943) is a Syrian media specialist and former diplomat based in London, England. ==Background== He was Head of the London Mission of the Arab League from 1992-2000.

Regarding Syrian communities in other countries, Armanazi has sought to highlight their dynamism and adaptability, pointing out that Syrian expatriates have been able to assimilate well into the various societies which have received them. ==See also== * Foreign relations of Syria ==External links== (Photo:) * https://web.archive.org/web/20071009040946/http://www.thedohadebates.com/files/images/March05_02.jpg * https://web.archive.org/web/20070424175901/http://meconsult.clients- lounge.de/join.php/mec/team * https://web.archive.org/web/20060710200826/http://caabu.org/index.asp?homepage=about&article;=ghayth_armanazi * http://www.britishsyriansociety.org/board.asp#c * http://www.creativesyria.com/discussion/bio.php?TopicAuthorID=244 Category:1943 births Category:Living people Category:Alumni of the University of London Category:Syrian diplomats Category:People from Damascus Category:University of Colorado alumni ","title":"Ghayth Armanazi"},{"id":"6211800","text":"Michael Gerard Ingham (born 9 July 1980) is a semi-professional footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for club Tadcaster Albion. He has played in the Football League for Carlisle United, Darlington, York City, Wrexham, Doncaster Rovers and Sunderland and at senior international level for the Northern Ireland national team. Ingham started his career with Northern Irish club Cliftonville before moving to England with Sunderland in the Premier League in 1999. He was loaned out by the club on eight occasions before eventually joining former loan club Wrexham on a permanent deal in 2005. After leaving the club in 2007 he joined Hereford United, where he made one appearance, and a year later dropped into non-League football with York City. He played for them in the 2009 FA Trophy Final at Wembley Stadium and after gaining the captaincy in 2010 he returned to Wembley Stadium to play in the 2010 Conference Premier play-off Final. Ingham was victorious with York in the 2012 FA Trophy Final and the 2012 Conference Premier play-off Final at Wembley Stadium, the latter meaning the club was promoted to League Two. Born in England, Ingham has represented Northern Ireland at international level. He was capped once by the under-18 team before winning four caps for the under-21s in 2001. He earned three caps for Northern Ireland, gaining his first against Germany in 2005. He was last capped against Wales in 2007. ==Club careerEarly career=== Ingham was born in Preston, Lancashire to a Northern Irish family. Despite being born in England, he was educated in Northern Ireland and studied A-levels at St Malachy's College, Belfast. As a teenager, he lived near the ground of Irish League Premier Division club Cliftonville, and played for amateur clubs Newington Youth Club and Malachians in the Northern Amateur Football League before starting his career with Cliftonville in 1998. He won the Irish FA Charity Shield and made 35 appearances during the 1998–99 season after replacing Paul Reece as the team's goalkeeper. ===Sunderland=== Having been watched by a number of clubs, Ingham joined newly promoted Premier League club Sunderland on 28 July 1999 for a £30,000 fee following a trial in February. He was loaned out to Third Division club Carlisle United on 1 October 1999, making his Football League debut the following day in a 1–1 home draw against Southend United. He finished the successful spell with seven appearances for Carlisle. He returned to Northern Ireland by rejoining former club Cliftonville on loan for the first three months of 2000–01 on 11 August 2000 to gain more first-team experience, saying \\"That's why I jumped at the chance of three months back in my old jersey. There was an option to join Lincoln City instead but they were only offering reserve games.\\" He finished this spell with 22 appearances, before being recalled by Sunderland in early January 2001. He made his Sunderland debut by starting in a 4–2 defeat away to Sheffield Wednesday in the League Cup on 12 September 2001, which proved to be his only appearance of 2001–02. This appearance resulted in former club Cliftonville receiving a payment from Sunderland, which was agreed when he was transferred to Sunderland. He joined Stoke City of the Second Division on a one-month loan on 18 December 2001, where he failed to make any appearances after joining as cover for Neil Cutler following an injury to Gavin Ward. Ingham was forced further down the Sunderland pecking order after the signing of Thomas Myhre in July 2002 and he joined Second Division club Stockport County on a one-month loan on 23 August. He made his only appearance in a 3–1 victory away to Lincoln in the League Cup on 10 September 2002 and the loan was extended for a second month, before being recalled by Sunderland in October due to an injury crisis. Despite this, he was forced further down Sunderland's pecking order after they signed Mart Poom on loan from Derby County and after considering handing in a transfer request he joined Third Division club Darlington on a one-month loan on 22 November 2002. He made three appearances before returning to Sunderland in December. He played for Sunderland in a friendly against Hull City for the opening of their new ground, the KC Stadium, which made him the first away goalkeeper at the ground, while also being the last to play at Hull's former ground, Boothferry Park. This was his final appearance for Darlington in a 1–0 victory over Hull, during which he denied Stuart Elliott from scoring on three occasions. He joined Third Division club York City on 24 January 2003 on a one-month loan after goalkeeper Alan Fettis left to join Hull, who Ingham made his debut against a day later in a 0–0 away draw. His loan at York was extended for second and third months in February and March 2003 and he finished the spell, in which he performed well, with 17 appearances. His second Sunderland appearance came in a 4–2 home defeat against Huddersfield Town in the League Cup on 23 September 2003 and in a reserve match in January 2004 he was sent off for head butting West Bromwich Albion's Simon Brown. He was signed by Second Division club Wrexham on 15 March 2004 a one-month loan following an injury to Andy Dibble, which was extended until the end of 2003–04 on 16 April. He finished this spell with 11 appearances for Wrexham, as well as playing in the 4–1 victory over Rhyl in the FAW Premier Cup Final. In May 2004, he threatened to leave Sunderland if he was not guaranteed first-team football the following season. After training with Blackpool, Ingham joined League One club Doncaster Rovers on 1 November 2004 on a one-month loan, playing in two matches. Ingham was set to join Coventry City on transfer deadline day in March 2005, but Sunderland cancelled the transfer due to an injury to Poom. His league debut for Sunderland came in a 2–1 home defeat against Reading on 9 April 2005, which he entered as a 45th-minute substitute for the injured Myhre. Despite suffering a neck injury while on the team bus, he made his first league start in the following match, a 2–2 away draw with Ipswich Town on 17 April 2005. After the match, manager Mick McCarthy said \\"He knows he's playing for a future elsewhere and I think that overall he's handled a bloody tense situation really well\\". He finished 2004–05 with two appearances for Sunderland and on 8 May 2005 was released by the club. ===Wrexham and Hereford United=== Ingham agreed a move to League Two club Wrexham in May 2005 on a two-year contract, and the transfer was completed on 5 July when he signed the contract. He picked up a calf injury after returning to Wrexham, which saw him miss their match against Leyton Orient on 17 September 2005. He suffered another injury on his return against Macclesfield Town on 24 September 2005, which on this occasion was a groin problem. Ingham returned to fitness ahead of their 4–2 home victory over Torquay United on 15 October 2005. He finished 2005–06 with 43 appearances for Wrexham. He underwent an operation on a hernia in May 2006. Ingham made his final appearance of 2006–07 in Wrexham's 2–1 away defeat to Milton Keynes Dons on 17 March 2007, in which he picked up a hamstring injury. He later suffered from a virus in April 2007. He finished the season with 37 appearances, after which he was released by the club, due to his place in the team being taken by Anthony Williams. In July 2007, Ingham had a trial with Scottish Premier League club Gretna, playing in a pre-season friendly against Welsh Premier League club The New Saints. However, he suffered a finger injury and the move to Gretna did not take place. On 17 August 2007, he signed forLeague Two club Hereford United on an initial one-month contract as cover for Wayne Brown, which was later extended until the end of 2007–08. His debut came in the Football League Trophy at home to Yeovil Town on 9 October 2007, which Hereford lost 4–2 in a penalty shoot-out after a 0–0 draw after extra time, with Ingham making \\"good saves\\" from Kevin Betsy and Simon Gillett. He picked up a hand injury in March 2008 that was expected to keep him out of the team for six weeks, meaning he finished the season with one appearance. ===York City=== Ingham playing for York City in the 2009 FA Trophy Final Ingham was released by Hereford at the end of the season, after which he moved down to the Conference Premier by rejoining former club York City on 14 May 2008 on a two-year contract. He suffered a thigh injury during a pre-season friendly against Harrogate Railway Athletic, meaning he missed York's opening match against Crawley Town on 9 August 2008, which led to the loan signing of Artur Krysiak from Birmingham City. Ingham recovered from his thigh injury ready for York's fourth match of 2008–09 against Northwich Victoria. Despite this, Josh Mimms played in goal and Ingham eventually made his first appearance of the season in a 1–1 home draw against Barrow on 25 August 2008. He saved a penalty kick during a penalty shoot-out against Mansfield Town in the Conference League Cup third round, helping York win the shootout 4–2, which followed a 1–1 home draw after extra time. He picked up a hamstring injury during a 1–1 away draw with Histon on 9 December 2008, and returned in York's next match, a 2–0 away win over Northwich in the FA Trophy on 16 December. Ingham saved the final penalty in a shoot-out victory at home to Kidderminster Harriers in an FA Trophy third round replay on 11 February 2009, giving York the victory 13–12 on penalties. He started in the 2009 FA Trophy Final at Wembley Stadium on 9 May, which York lost 2–0 to Stevenage Borough. Ingham finished his first permanent season at York with 52 appearances. Clubman of the Year for the 2009–10 season Utook over the captaincy following the absences of Daniel Parslow and David McGurk from the team in March 2010. He signed a new two-year contract with York in the same month. Ingham was named as York's Clubman of the Year for 2009–10 before their final home match of the season prior to play-offs against Grays Athletic. He was also named the Community Player of the Year, which recognised his community work in York. He played in both legs of York's play-off semi-final victory over Luton Town, which finished 2–0 on aggregate. He started in the 2010 Conference Premier play-off Final at Wembley Stadium on 16 May, which York lost 3–1 to Oxford. He finished the season with 55 appearances for York. Ingham was replaced as captain in October 2010 following the signing of Chris Smith, with manager Gary Mills commenting \\"I'm not a fan of goalkeeping captains and that's no disrespect to Michael Ingham. He took the decision on the chin with no problems.\\" Ingham was named the Conference Player of the Month for November 2010 after he kept six clean sheets and conceded one goal throughout that period. He dedicated the award to his defence, saying \\"The lads have been brilliant all month, in particular the back five. I accept this trophy on behalf of them\\". He was sent off in the 15th minute of York's 5–0 defeat away to Luton on 18 January 2011 after fouling Claude Gnakpa outside the penalty area. He finished 2010–11 with 51 appearances and in July 2011 signed a new two-year contract with York. Ingham after playing for York City in the 2012 Conference Premier play-off Final Ingham won the 2012 FA Trophy Final with York at Wembley Stadium on 12 May, in which the team beat Newport County 2–0. Eight days later, he played in the 2–1 victory over Luton in the 2012 Conference Premier play-off Final at Wembley Stadium on 20 May, seeing the club return to the Football League after an eight-year absence with promotion to League Two. Ingham finished 2011–12 with 55 appearances for York and in July 2012 signed a new two-year contract with the club. Ingham started York's match away to League One team Doncaster in the League Cup first round on the opening day of 2012–13 on 11 August 2012, which they lost 4–2 in a penalty shoot-out following a 1–1 draw after extra time. He then played in York's first Football League fixture since their promotion, a 3–1 defeat at home to Wycombe Wanderers on 18 August 2012. He finished the season with 51 appearances. Ingham left York after rejecting a new contract in July 2016. ===Tadcaster Albion=== On 1 August 2016, Ingham signed for newly promoted Northern Premier League Division One North club Tadcaster Albion, having earlier joined i2i Sports, the club's owners, as a goalkeeping coach. He had made 21 appearances in all competitions by the time the 2019–20 season was abandoned and results expunged because of the COVID-19 pandemic in England. ==International career== Ingham was capped once for Northern Ireland at under-18 level, making his only appearance in a 2–1 home defeat to the Republic of Ireland on 9 March 1999 in 1999 UEFA European Under-18 Championship qualifying. After being understudy to David Miskelly for two under-21 matches in 2000, Ingham made his debut in a 2–0 home defeat to the Czech Republic on 23 March 2001 in 2002 UEFA European Under-21 Championship qualifying. Having made his last under-21 appearance in a 4–0 defeat to the Czech Republic on 5 June 2001 in another qualifier, his international career at this level concluded with four caps. Ingham was called into the senior Northern Ireland squad in August 2002 after Roy Carroll was released. He was called into the Northern Ireland B squad in May 2003, but was forced to withdraw because of injury. Ingham's form during a loan at Wrexham saw him placed on standby for Northern Ireland's match with Serbia and Montenegro in April 2004. He was named in the Northern Ireland squad for their tour of the Caribbean in May 2004, but dislocated a finger in training in June, which meant he missed out on making his debut. He earned his first cap for Northern Ireland in a 4–1 home defeat against Germany in a friendly on 4 June 2005, the Irish Football Association (IFA)'s 125th anniversary match. He came on as a substitute for Maik Taylor on 76 minutes, conceding one goal scored by Lukas Podolski. On reflection of this match, Ingham said \\"The reaction of the crowd when I came on was amazing. To be honest I was holding back the tears as I never thought I would get such a reception. I was the proudest man in the ground.\\" For this match, he was offered insurance by the IFA, due to him not yet being under contract at Wrexham. This appearance would result in a £30,000 payment for former club Cliftonville, which came as a part of the deal for Sunderland to sign him, but by August 2005 this had still to be received by the club. The Premier League was called into the situation by Cliftonville, as they had only received the first part of the payment after he made his first-team debut for Sunderland. Ingham himself was also due a £20,000 bonus for this appearance. Ingham was on the bench for Northern Ireland as they beat England 1–0 in a 2006 FIFA World Cup qualifier on 7 September 2005. He received call ups for friendlies against Portugal in November 2005 and Estonia in March 2006, although he only made the bench for both matches. He was named by Northern Ireland in their end-of-season tour of the United States in May 2006, starting in the 1–0 defeat against Uruguay at the Giants Stadium on 21 May. By November 2006, he had established himself as Northern Ireland's third-choice goalkeeper behind Taylor and Carroll. Ingham came on as a substitute for the second half of Northern Ireland's 0–0 draw against Wales in a friendly on 6 February 2007, giving him his third and most recent international cap. ==Personal life== Ingham married his wife on 7 June 2008. He was arrested along with York teammates Michael Gash, Craig Nelthorpe and Michael Rankine in August 2009 following an incident involving two other men at a Subway outlet on a night out. The four appeared at York Magistrates' Court on 14 January 2010 after being charged with affray. Ingham pleaded not guilty to the charge of affray and this was accepted after the prosecution deemed his involvement in the incident to be minimal after appearing at York Crown Court on 1 September 2010. ==Career statisticsClub=== { class= style=text-align:center + Appearances and goals by club, season and competition - !rowspan=2Club !rowspan=2Season !colspan=3League !colspan=2FA Cup !colspan=2League Cup !colspan=2Other !colspan=2Total - !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals - Cliftonville 1998–99 Irish League Premier Division 180      180 - rowspan=7Sunderland 1999–2000 Premier League 000000colspan=2—00 - 2000–01 Premier League 0000colspan=2—colspan=2—00 - 2001–02 Premier League 00colspan=2—10colspan=2—10 - 2002–03 Premier League 0000colspan=2—colspan=2—00 - 2003–04 First Division 0000100010 - 2004–05 Championship 200000colspan=2—20 - !colspan=2Total !2000200040 - Carlisle United (loan) 1999–2000 Third Division 7000colspan=2—colspan=2—70 - Cliftonville (loan) 2000–01 Irish League Premier Division 200      200 - Stoke City (loan) 2001–02 Second Division 0000colspan=2—colspan=2—00 - Stockport County (loan) 2002–03 Second Division 00colspan=2—10colspan=2—10 - Darlington (loan) 2002–03 Third Division 3000colspan=2—colspan=2—30 - York City (loan) 2002–03 Third Division 170colspan=2—colspan=2—colspan=2—170 - Wrexham (loan) 2003–04 Second Division 110colspan=2—colspan=2—colspan=2—110 - Doncaster Rovers (loan) 2004–05 League One 1000colspan=2—1020 - rowspan=3Wrexham 2005–06 League Two 400101010430 - 2006–07 League Two 310302010370 - !colspan=2Total !710403020800 - Hereford United 2007–08 League Two 0000001010 - rowspan=9York City 2008–09 Conference Premier 40020colspan=2—100520 - 2009–10 Conference Premier 43040colspan=2—80550 - 2010–11 Conference Premier 45050colspan=2—10510 - 2011–12 Conference Premier 43010colspan=2—110550 - 2012–13 League Two 460201020510 - 2013–14 League Two 190101010220 - 2014–15 League Two 190200010220 - 2015–16 League Two 3000000030 - !colspan=2Total !2580170203403110 - rowspan=4Tadcaster Albion 2016–17 Northern Premier League Division One North 11020colspan=2—10140 - 2017–18 Northern Premier League Division One North 28010colspan=2—30320 - 2018–19 Northern Premier League Division One East 26020colspan=2—50330 - !colspan=2Total !65050colspan=2—90790 - !colspan=3Career total !4730260804705540 } ===International=== :Source: { class= style=text-align:center + Appearances and goals by national team and year - !National team!!Year!!Apps!!Goals - rowspan=3Northern Ireland 200510 - 200610 - 200710 - !colspan=2Total30 } ==Honours== Cliftonville *Irish FA Charity Shield: 1998 York City *Conference Premier play-offs: 2012 *FA Trophy: 2011–12 Individual *York City Clubman of the Year: 2009–10 ==References *Profile at the Tadcaster Albion A.F.C. website * Category:1980 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Preston, Lancashire Category:English footballers Category:Association footballers from Northern Ireland Category:Northern Ireland youth international footballers Category:Northern Ireland under-21 international footballers Category:Northern Ireland international footballers Category:Association football goalkeepers Category:Cliftonville F.C. players Category:Sunderland A.F.C. players Category:Carlisle United F.C. players Category:Stoke City F.C. players Category:Stockport County F.C. players Category:Darlington F.C. players Category:York City F.C. players Category:Wrexham A.F.C. players Category:Doncaster Rovers F.C. players Category:Hereford United F.C. players Category:Tadcaster Albion A.F.C. players Category:NIFL Premiership players Category:English Football League players Category:National League (English football) players Category:Northern Premier League players Category:People educated at St Malachy's College ","title":"Michael Ingham (footballer)"},{"id":"6211809","text":"Franciszka Themerson (28 June 1907 - 29 June 1988) was a Polish, later British, painter, illustrator, filmmaker and stage designer. ==Biography== The daughter of the artist, Jakub Weinles, Themerson was born in Warsaw in 1907. She graduated from the Chopin University of Music and the Warsaw School of Fine Arts with a distinction, in 1931. From 1938 to 1940 she lived in Paris, and then from 1940 lived in London until her death in 1988. She was principally a painter, although, throughout her life, she worked in several other fields of the visual arts: illustration, stage and graphic design. Themerson collaborated with her husband, the writer Stefan Themerson, on experimental films, Apteka [The Pharmacy] (1930), Europa (1931–1932), Drobiazg Melodyjny [Musical Moment] (1933), Zwarcie [Short Circuit] (1935) and Przygoda Czlowieka Poczciwego [Adventure of a Good Citizen] (1937), only the last of which survives, along with two films they made together in Britain, Calling Mr Smith(1943), an account of Nazi atrocities in Poland and The Eye and the Ear (1944/45), investigating the visualisation of music. A \\"remake\\" of Europa was made in Poland in the 1980s, and an incomplete copy of the original film was found in an archive in Berlin in 2019. She illustrated books for children written by her husband and others, and in 1948 she founded with her husband the quirky publishing company, Gaberbocchus Press, of which she was the art director. The press was named after a Latinisation of 'Jabberwocky', from Lewis Carroll's 'Alice', coined by Carroll's uncle, Hassard Dodgson. In 31 years the Gaberbocchus Press published over sixty titles, including works by Alfred Jarry, Kurt Schwitters, Bertrand Russell and the Themersons themselves. Alfred Jarry’s Ubu Roi was its flagship publication, published in many editions and still in print. The Gaberbocchus edition is a most apposite evocation of the spirit of Jarry's grotesque fable. The text, which was hand- written directly onto lithographic plates by the translator, Barbara Wright - interspersed with Themerson's conté crayon illustrations - is printed on bright yellow pages. Themerson's contributions as illustrator enormously enhanced the graphic originality of design of Gaberbocchus books. Apart from appearing in many journals worldwide, several collections of her drawings have been published as books: Forty Drawings for Friends, London 1940-42 (1943), The Way It Walks (1954), Traces of Living (1969) and Music (1998). Themerson's theatrical designs included marionette productions of Ubu Roi, Ubu Enchainé and Brecht's Threepenny Opera, mostly made for the Marionetteater in Stockholm, in the 1960s, which toured worldwide for decades, to international acclaim. Many of them were subsequently exhibited at London's National Theatre in 1993. Her major solo exhibitions - of paintings and drawings - include those at Gallery One One OneGallery One in 1957 and 1959; Drian Galleries, 1963; Zachęta, Warsaw, 1964; New Gallery, Belfast, 1966; Demarco Gallery, Edinburgh, 1968; A retrospective at the Whitechapel Art Gallery, 1975; Gruenebaum, New York City, 1978; Łódź, Warsaw, Wrocław, 1981–1982; Nordjyllands Kunstmuseum, Aalborg, 1991; Gardner Centre, University of Sussex, 1992; Gdańsk, 1993; Redfern Gallery, 1993; National Theatre, 1993; Royal Festival Hall, 1993.

A collection of Themerson's greeting cards, called Gaberbocchus some of the old favourites is in the collection of the National Library of Poland. ==Books illustrated by Franciszka Themerson published by the Gaberbocchus Press== * Aesop, The Eagle & the Fox & The Fox & the Eagle: two semantically symmetrical versions and a revised application, (devised by Stefan Themerson). 1949 *Stefan Themerson & Barbara Wright.

It was released as the first single from the group's fifth studio album, Pop Life and was issued several months prior to the release of the album. The Pop Life album marked a break for Bananarama from their long-standing relationship with the Stock Aitken Waterman (SAW) production trio. \\"Only Your Love\\" was co- written and produced by Youth. The album version of the song was remixed for its single release. The song's primary rhythm, complete with 'Woo Woo' hoots, directly references \\"Sympathy for the Devil\\". This led Jonathan Ross to jokingly thank 'The Rolling Stones' after Bananarama had performed the song on his TV show. The song also contains samples of \\"Loaded\\" by Primal Scream, \\"Fool's Gold\\" by The Stone Roses and “Funky Drummer” by James Brown . Upon its release \\"Only Your Love\\" received positive critical reviews. The song was not released as a single in the United States. \\"Only Your Love\\" peaked at number 27 in the UK singles chart, which the group considered to be a disappointment. The single did not fare much better in other countries, hitting number 49 in New Zealand and 51 in Australia. ==Music video== The music video, directed by Philippe Gautier, which makes use of silhouettes against multicoloured backdrops, features the girls on a studio set made to look like a cross between a train and a jungle gym. They perform the song while dancing provocatively with various male dancers. The dancing features more physical contact between the girls and the male dancers than any of their other videos. The performance on the train is interspersed with shots of the girls singing on the front of the train engine in sunglasses and oversized dresses. ==Remixes== ; CD 1 single #\\"Only Your Love\\" (Milky Bar Mix) - (8:12) #:Remixed by Robin Goodfellow #\\"Only Your Love\\" (Youth & Thrash on the Mix) - (4:17) #\\"Only Your Love\\" (Hardcore Instrumental) - (3:27) ; CD 2 single #\\"Only Your Love\\" (7\\" Mix) - (4:02) #\\"Only Your Love\\" (Milky Bar Mix) - (8:12) #:Remixed by Robin Goodfellow #\\"Only Your Love\\" (Hardcore Instrumental) - (3:27) #\\"Only Your Love\\" (Youth & Thrash on the Mix) - (4:17) ; CD 3 single #\\"Only Your Love\\" (Milky Bar Mix) - (8:12) #:Remixed by Robin Goodfellow #\\"Only Your Love\\" (Hardcore Instrumental) - (3:27) #\\"Only Your Love\\" (Youth & Thrash on the Mix) - (4:17) #\\"Only Your Love\\" (Paris Texas Instrumental) - (5:33) ; Other versions #\\"Only Your Love\\" (Album Version) - (3:58) #\\"Only Your Love\\" (Instrumental) #\\"Only Your Love\\" (The Monkey Drum Mooch) - (7:20) #:Remixed by Terry Farley #\\"Only Your Love\\" (A Tribute to Barry Mooncult Mix) - (5:40) #:Remixed by Terry Farley ==Charts== {  !align=\\"left\\"Chart (1990) !align=\\"left\\"Peak position - align=\\"left\\"Australia (ARIA Chart) align=\\"center\\"51 - align=\\"left\\"New Zealand (RIANZ) align=\\"center\\"49 - align=\\"left\\"UK Singles (Official Charts Company) align=\\"center\\"27 - } ==References * Category:1990 singles Category:Bananarama songs Category:London Records singles Category:Songs written by Sara Dallin Category:Songs written by Martin Glover Category:1990 songs ","title":"Only Your Love"},{"id":"6211869","text":"The Darwin Dam is an offstream earthfill embankment saddle dam without a spillway, located in Western Tasmania, Australia.

Each game has its own set of rules and a guide to learn how to play. ==Gameplay== The Golden Nugget Las Vegas hotel and casino is the setting for the following games: *Blackjack: The goal of blackjack is to get the total point value of cards to 21 without going over. *Craps: The objective of craps is to bet on the outcome of dice rolls. *Five- card draw: Like most poker games, the point of five card draw is to have the best hand after the final betting round. *Roulette: The goal of roulette is to correctly guess which slot the ball will stop on when the wheel stops spinning. *Seven-card stud: The goal is to have the best hand over other opponents. *Video poker: The goal of video poker is to make the best possible hand. Unlike other poker games, there are no opponents. The player wins a certain multiplier of the bet based on their hand. Only Jacks or Better video poker are included in this cartridge. *Texas hold 'em: Objective is to have a better hand than the opponents. *Big Six wheel: Similar to roulette, this game has players trying to successfully predict what symbol the wheel will stop on. *Mini-Baccarat: The goal of mini-baccarat is to guess which hand is closer to 9 without going over. *Slot machines: In order to win in slots, players must match a winning combination of symbols. These symbols vary from slot machine to slot machine. There are six different slot machines in this game (Card Bonanza, Catch of the Day!, Motherlode, Sports Fanatic!, Wheels of Fire!, Miner 49er!). Other options include a Big Winners list as well as a Slideshow of the actual Golden Nugget Las Vegas hotel and casino. ==Audio== The audio in this game is a mixture of \\"people in the background of the casino, dice rolling, cards flipping, chips stacking, tokens entering slots, the dealer talking to [the player] and a variety of other things\\".http://www.gamespot.com/n64/puzzle/goldennugget/player_review.html?id=551704 The background music is a laid back piano score while the sound effects all ring true. The male dealer is voiced by Chris Rausch and the female dealer by Donna Rawlins. They have very few standard dealer lines. ==Reception== IGN gave Golden Nugget 64 a 7.8 out of 10 overall praising the gameplay and the graphics despite little criticism about the sound stating \\"the theme music is nasty\\".IGN Reviews Golden Nugget 64 (N64) ==Other games== A previous game, Golden Nugget, was released for Microsoft Windows in 1996 and PlayStation in 1997.

There she meets Takahashi Tetsuya, a trombone-playing student who loves Curtis Fuller's \\"Five Spot After Dark\\" song on Blues-ette; Takahashi knows Mari's sister Eri, who he was once interested in, and insists that the group of them have hung out before. Meanwhile, Eri is in a deep sleep next to a television and seems to be haunted by a menacing figure. Mari crosses paths with a retired female wrestler, Kaoru, now working as a manager in a love hotel called \\"Alphaville\\". Kaoru needs Mari to talk to a Chinese prostitute who had just been beaten in the love hotel by an office worker, Shirakawa. The group then tries to track down Shirakawa, and includes the Chinese Mafia group that 'owns' the prostitute. In the love hotel Mari also hears stories from some of the staff working there and takes a glance at the other world hidden below the one we are aware of. Parts of the story take place in a world between reality and dream, and each chapter begins with an image of a clock depicting the passage of time throughout the night. == Characters == * Mari Asai, a 19-year-old student learning Chinese philology. As a child she went to a school for Chinese children. Mari is rather reserved when talking to strangers but however is keen on \\"making everything right\\". * Tetsuya Takahashi, a trombone-playing student who, however, wants to stop practising music and start learning law. He is rather optimistic and doesn't want to live a big life. * Kaoru, a retired female wrestler now working as a manager in the love hotel, \\"Alphaville\\". She is trustworthy, honest and always seeking justice. * Shirakawa, an office worker who beat a Chinese prostitute in \\"Alphaville\\". ==Structure== The story is broken down in small chapters of varying length and has a real-time timeline. Some chapters are describing the situation happening with Eri Asai, and some describe the night of Mari Asai. However, as always, Haruki Murakami links the two stories in the end. The novel is filled with symbols that can be understood in many different ways. Such strong symbols as music, night, light, cameras and not working television are used, and the author leaves it to his readers to interpret them in one way or another. ==Reception== The novel received a 64% rating from the book review aggregator iDreamBooks based on 17 critics' reviews. A common point of criticism was the ending, or apparent lack thereof, which many critics found retroactively soured the rest of the book. ==References * Comprehensive After Dark resource page * The Guardian review * Strange Horizons review * After Dark at the Internet Book List Category:Novels by Haruki Murakami Category:2004 Japanese novels Category:Novels set in Tokyo Category:Kodansha books ","title":"After Dark (Murakami novel)"},{"id":"6211900","text":"The Limerick Senior Hurling Championship is an annual club competition between the top hurling clubs in Limerick.

He held the WBC light welterweight title from 2006 to 2008 and challenged once for the IBF light welterweight title in 2000. At regional level, he held the British and Commonwealth light welterweight title from 2002 to 2005; the EBU European Union light welterweight title in 2003; and the EBU European light welterweight title from 2004 to 2005; and the British welterweight title in 2012. ==Professional careerEarly professional years=== Witter's first fight as a professional took place in January 1997 and scored a draw over Cameron Raeside at the Green Bank Leisure Centre in Derbyshire. He scored his first win as a professional in his next fight, travelling to Yarm to beat John Green over six rounds. Five more fights happened in 1997 (all wins) for Witter to end the year with a record of 6-0-1. Witter's next year as a professional started in the same way as his first; a draw over Mark Grundy! Despite this he fought four more times during the year meaning that at the end of only his second year as a pro he had compiled of record of 12-0-2 scoring decent wins along the way over the likes of Jan Piet Bergman (35-1) and Mark Winters (13-1). The beginning of 1999 begun with a two-round win over Malcolm Melvin. ===IBF light-welterweight title challenge=== Witter gained four more victories, then in June 2000, with a record of 15-0-2, he was given a late-notice shot at a world title against American Zab Judah. The fight, which took place in Glasgow in Scotland on the undercard of Mike Tyson's fight with Lou Savarese, ended with first career defeat for the Englishman.Boxrec  Results for 24 June 2000 Witter lasted the distance but lost on points to the champion. Speaking of the fight later on in his career and when he himself had finally won a World title, Witter said \\"It was a shot in the dark. During my first few years as a pro, I was struggling like mad financially, so when the shot came about it meant a really big payday. I thought: if I don't take it, I've got nothing - all my savings were gone and all my loans were on top of me. As far as the fight went, I didn't have enough experience. I wasn't even British champion and I had nine days to prepare for a shot at Judah, one of the best fighters in the world. I lost on points, but I learned so much. It taught me that I deserved to be at that level.\\"The Guardian  Interview with Junior Witter ===British, Commonwealth and European champion=== Witter's response to his first defeat was to go the traditional route towards another crack at a World belt. Witter fought six more times since the Judah defeat beating the likes of Steve Conway (TKO 4) and Colin Mayisela (TKO 2) before, in March 2002, meeting Alan Bosworth for the vacant British light welterweight title claiming the belt with a stoppage in the third round. Witter's next fight saw him pick up the vacant Commonwealth title with a win over Ghanain Laatekwei Hammond. Two more fights in 2002 saw him beat Lucky Sambo in a non-title fight and Italian Giuseppe Lauri in an eliminator for the WBO light welterweight title. Only two fights in 2003 saw the double champion add to his collection when in April 2003 he beat Belgian Jurgen Haeck for the European Union title. A first defence of his Commonwealth title took place in September at the MEN Arena in Manchester with a win in the 2nd round giving victory over Kenyan Fred Kinuthia. Witter finally challenged for the full European title in June 2004 beating Italian Salvatore Battaglia at the Ice Arena in Nottingham. The year ended for Witter with a first defence of his European crown at the Conference Center in Wembley beating Polish fighter Krzyztof Bienias.Britishboxing.net  Witter tells us to recognise ===Route to a second world title challenge=== In February 2005, Witter travelled to Los Angeles for a WBC Light Welterweight eliminator against Australian-based Lovemore N'dou. The fight which also doubled as a further defence of his Commonwealth title ended with a 12-round points decision win for the man from Bradford. In July of the same year Witter returned to the Ice Arena in Nottingham to score a win over Ukrainian Andriy Kotelnik in a close fought fight which was also a defence of his European title.BBC Sport  Laboured Witter defeats Kotelnik Witter finished the year with a win over fellow Brit Colin Lynes in a fight which saw his British, Commonwealth and European titles all on the line at the same time. The fight, this time at the York Hall in London, ended with another points victory over 12 rounds for Witter. ===WBC light-welterweight champion=== September 2006 finally saw Witter win a world title when he challenged American Demarcus Corley for the vacant WBC light welterweight belt at the Alexandra Palace in Wood Green.BBC Sport  Witter handed World title chance Eighteen fights and eighteen wins since losing to Zab Judah in 2000 Witter had finally achieved the pinnacle of his career so far.

Following his loss to Bradley, Witter declared he would continue fighting at a professional level and vowed to return to the ring to reclaim his WBC crown. Bradley commented that he would be happy to offer Witter a rematch if the money was right. ===Comeback=== Following the Bradley defeat Witter returned to the ring on 8 November 2008 and scored a third-round knockout of Argentinian Victor Hugo Castro. He knocked his opponent down in the second but was unable to finish it due to the bell instead finishing the fight early in the following round. Witter was then given the chance to fight for his old WBC title when in May 2009, Timothy Bradley was stripped of the belt for choosing not to fight his mandatory challenger Devon Alexander.ESPN  Bradley stripped of WBC title This handed Witter an opportunity to fight Alexander for the now vacant belt. The contest took place in California on 1 August 2009 with Alexander proving too strong for the former champion with Witter, claiming an elbow injury in round four, having to retire at the end of round eight.BBC Sport  Witter loses to classy Alexander The injury meant that Witter did not fight again til 19 February 2011, a year and a half since the loss to Alexander.Boxingnews24  Junior witter vs. Victor Puiu The fight, this time in Ontario, Canada, resulted in another loss for Witter as he was beaten over 10 rounds by Romanian boxer Victor Puiu for the WBC International silver welterweight title.Eastsideboxing  Have we seen the last of Junior Witter?

It appears on the group's fifth studio album Pop Life and was released as the album's second single. The track was co-written and produced by Youth with additional production and remix by Shep Pettibone. \\"Tripping on Your Love\\" had been originally slated as the second single from the album, and some promotional singles of the song were sent to radio stations in late 1990. Around this time, group member Sara Dallin contracted meningitis, which delayed the release of the single some months. When she recovered, London Records decided \\"Preacher Man\\" was a better choice for a single and so it was released in December 1990. \\"Tripping on Your Love\\" was eventually released as the album's fourth single. The pop/dance tune became the highest-charting and biggest- selling single released from the Pop Life album, climbing to number 20 in the UK singles chart. The single was Bananarama's last appearance in the UK top 20 until \\"Move in My Direction\\" in 2005. In Australia, the single peaked at #147 on the Australian ARIA singles chart. \\"Preacher Man\\" was not released in the United States. The song was performed on The Original Line Up Tour in 2017-2018. Despite being recorded after she left, original member Siobhan Fahey has always liked the song and chose to include it in the setlist. ==Critical reception== Caroline Sullivan from Smash Hits wrote that the song sounded like \\"everything they did with S/A/W\\" and noted \\"the chugging beat, same slick strings and the harmonica solo.\\" ==Music video== The music video featured a man tied to a chair in the interrogation room of a prison. As he breaks down and goes crazy, the girls, as well as various other carnival-like costumed entertainers such as a midget and a girl in a winged outfit, appear as hallucinations before him. These scenes are intercut with the girls performing the song in front of candles. Harmonica player Johnny Mars appears on the video..

Stasik then conducted a retrospective study of the incidence of bladder cancer among workers restricted to this subcohort. His investigation revealed eight subjects in whom bladder carcinomas were diagnosed between 1967 and 1985. Two of them had already died. The standardized incidence rate for bladder carcinomas in the 4-COT subcohort was 73 times higher than expected.

It was the fourth final of the world's oldest football competition, the Football Association Challenge Cup (known in the modern era as the FA Cup). Heading into the final, the Royal Engineers were playing in their third final after losing the 1872 and 1874 finals while the Old Etonians were playing in their first FA Cup final. 1874–75 Competition Results by Macario Reyes on the RSSSF Prior to the final, the Royal Engineers had played one more match than the Old Etonians with the Etonians getting a bye in the second round due to the odd number of the teams that had entered the tournament. 2,000 people saw the match which ended in a 1–1 draw, Henry Renny-Tailyour scored for the Engineers but Alexander Bonsor replied to have the match end in a draw and have the final being replayed for the first time with two goals from Renny-Tailyour sealing the Royal Engineers' first and only FA Cup title. ==Route to the final== The Engineers, who lost the final on two of the three previous occasions, kicked off with a resounding 3–0 win over Marlow. They kept the scoring feat up in the next round, beating Cambridge University 5–0. The Quarter Final was a closely fought match against Clapham Rovers, just prevailing 3–2. The Semi- final produced a repeat fixture of the final of 1874, as the Engineers faced Oxford University. This time, the Engineers won 1–0. The Old Etonians started off against the Swifts, which proved a very tough match. After two drawn games, the Etonians managed to pull off a 3–0 victory. In the second round they received a bye which led them into the quarter-finals. Following a win against Maidenhead, they played Shropshire Wanderers. An extremely close match was just edged out by a single goal to nil. ==Final matches== The first match was notable chiefly because it was played in a \\"howling gale\\". The conditions considerably favoured the Etonians team, which had the wind at its backs for all but 10 minutes of the 90, and all 30 minutes of extra time (teams in this period changed ends after every goal- this game was the last to feature this rule).Motson, John, \\"Motson's FA Cup Odyssey: The World's Greatest Knockout Competition”, Robson Publishing, 2005 Cuthbert Ottaway received an ankle injury after 37 minutes into the final, following a collision with Richard Ruck, and was forced to leave the field; in his absence, the Old Boys were regarded as fortunate to have held on for a 1–1 draw. Ottaway failed to recover in time for the replay, held only three days later, and Etonians also lost the services of three other players who had prior commitments. Unable to obtain adequate replacements, the Old Boys arrived at the ground an hour late and lost the delayed replay 0–2. Henry Renny-Tailyour scored all three goals in both matches for the Engineers.

He has made over 350 appearances in the Football League for Norwich City, Bristol Rovers, Wrexham, Hartlepool United and Grimsby Town, before joining Welsh Premier League sides Neath, Llanelli and Aberystwyth Town. He earned 6 full international caps for Wales, scoring once from between 1998 and 2006. He also previously earned 14 caps for the Wales U21 team. ==Club careerNorwich City=== A product of the Norwich City youth team, Llewellyn broke into the first team at Norwich in the 1997–1998 season making a total of 16 appearances with 4 goals. After injury in the 2002–03 season, he lost his place and went on loan to Bristol Rovers; he was released in June 2003 from Norwich. In the 6 years that Llewellyn spent in the first team it was rumoured that on more than one occasion an unknown Premiership club had had an offer of 3 million pound plus rejected by Norwich, who were keen to keep hold of the player dubbed, 'The New Giggs.' It was this title that earnt him cult hero status at Norwich, indeed a group of supporters known as, 'The Barclay Boys,' regularly sang a song about their Welsh Wizard to visiting supporters, 'Try and spell his effing name, effing name, effing name, try and spell his effing name, Chris Llewellyn.' ===Wrexham=== Llewellyn signed for Wrexham and a strong 2003–04 season saw him recalled to the Welsh squad in May 2004 and come on a sub to win his third cap against Norway. He took part in the club's Football League Trophy win in 2005. ===Hartlepool United=== Later, he signed for Hartlepool United but only stayed one season and returned on a free to Wrexham on 29 June 2006. He scored once for Hartlepool in an FA Cup tie against Tamworth. ===Return to Wrexham=== On the final day of the 2006–2007 season, Wrexham needed to avoid defeat against Boston United to avoid relegation to the Conference National. After coming from 1–0 down, Llewellyn scored the goal which handed the Red Dragons a 2–1 lead before they eventually won 3–1 and preserved their Football League Two status. He was released by Wrexham in May 2008 following the club's relegation to the Football Conference. ===Grimsby Town=== He joined Grimsby Town on a two-year contract in July 2008. He made his league debut in the opening game of the season, in the goalless draw with Rochdale. He made 32 appearances in all competitions for Grimsby, 17 as substitute. ===Neath=== Llewellyn was released by Grimsby at the end of the 2008–09 season and joined Welsh Premier League side Neath Athletic. After scoring five times in the opening five games of the season, Neath manager Andrew Dyer praised Llewellyn's performances and described him as \\"the best striker in the league\\". However, he scored just four times during the rest of the season. ===Llanelli=== In June 2010, he left Neath by mutual consent to sign for Llanelli. Llewellyn scored in the 2010–11 UEFA Europa League second leg tie against FK Tauras Tauragė. He joined Aberystwyth Town on loan in January 2012. He left Llanelli in June 2012 after being released. ===West End=== In June 2012, Llewellyn was appointed player- assistant manager at Welsh Football League side West End alongside manager Anthony Wright. ==Coaching career== In December 2012, Llewellyn joined Swansea City as a full-time youth coach. In February 2014, Llewellyn became manager of Swansea City Under 21s. Llewellyn replaced Kristian O'Leary who was promoted to the role of Assistant First Team Coach. In 2015, the Under-21s won the 2014-15 Professional U21 Development League 2. In doing so, the under-21s became the first Swansea City Academy age-group to win an English national development trophy. Ahead of the 2015-16 season, Llewellyn took charge of the under-18s team alongside Eric Ramsay. ==International career== He gained Welsh B and under-21 honours. He later won full honours and made his Welsh debut against Malta in 1998. He was recalled to the full Wales squad in May 2004 and come on a sub to win his 3rd cap against Norway. Llewellyn scored his first international goal for Wales against Liechtenstein in November 2006 alongside his ex Norwich City strike partner Craig Bellamy. ==References * *Career information at ex-canaries.co.uk *Welsh Premier profile Category:1979 births Category:Living people Category:Footballers from Swansea Category:Welsh footballers Category:Wales youth international footballers Category:Wales under-21 international footballers Category:Wales B international footballers Category:Wales international footballers Category:Norwich City F.C. players Category:Bristol Rovers F.C. players Category:Wrexham A.F.C. players Category:Hartlepool United F.C. players Category:Grimsby Town F.C. players Category:Neath F.C. players Category:Llanelli Town A.F.C. players Category:English Football League players Category:Cymru Premier players Category:Aberystwyth Town F.C. players Category:Association football midfielders Category:Colchester United F.C. non- playing staff ","title":"Chris Llewellyn"},{"id":"6212003","text":"Rare Birds is a 2001 Canadian comedy/drama film.

Barclay recognized his interest in writing detective fiction at an early age, inspired by the works of Ross Macdonald, who had grown up in Kitchener, Ontario. After graduating from high school Barclay studied literature at Trent University in Peterborough, Ontario, where one of his teachers was the noted novelist Margaret Laurence. While attending university, he began a correspondence with Macdonald that proved inspirational for Barclay. They met once, at which time Macdonald inscribed one of his books to Barclay: \\"For Linwood, who will, I hope, someday outwrite me\\". After graduation with an English literature degree from Trent, he could not sell any of his novels so he found work on a number of local newspapers beginning with the Peterborough Examiner. He subsequently moved to the Toronto Star in 1981. In 1993, following the death of Gary Lautens, he began to write a thrice-weekly humour column for the paper. He also released podcasts of his articles and published three collections: Mike Harris Made Me Eat My Dog, Father Knows Zilch: A Guide for Dumbfounded Dads, and This House Is Nuts!. Between 2004 and 2007, while still writing his column, he published four mystery/comedies, all featuring a sleuth named Zack Walker who works as a newspaper columnist by day. The books were published in the United Kingdom and were modestly successful. His break came in 2007 when he published No Time for Goodbye. A runaway bestseller in the UK, it quickly sold a million copies there and elsewhere. He took a one-year sabbatical to promote his novel and he had planned to return to the Star in September 2008. But on June 28, 2008, he wrote his last column, announcing his retirement from the newspaper. His 2012 novel Trust Your Eyes was a finalist for the Crime Thriller Book Club Best Read from the UK Specsavers Crime Thriller Awards.ITV Press Centre (25 October 2013). \\"Winners unmasked at Specsavers Crime Thriller Awards 2013 on ITV3\\". ITV Press Centre. Retrieved 19 February 2014 At the time of its publication, it was announced that Trust Your Eyes had been optioned by a Hollywood studio. Barclay made the cover of Variety Magazine because of the bidding war it had caused between Universal Studios and Warner Bros.. Barclay lives in Oakville, Ontario, with his wife of more than three decades, Neetha, with whom he has two children - Spencer and Paige. ==BibliographyNon- fiction=== *Last Resort: A Memoir (2000, finalist for the Stephen Leacock Medal for Humour) ===Humour=== * Mike Harris Made Me Eat My Dog *Father Knows Zilch: A Guide for Dumbfounded Dads *This House Is Nuts! : Surviving the Absurdities of Everyday Life ===Fiction=== {  !

The primary goal of this method of computing is to be able to anticipate and prepare for potentially problematic situations prior to their occurrence, despite any adverse conditions of a computer system or any mistakes made by other users. This can be achieved through adherence to a variety of general guidelines, as well as the practice of specific computing techniques. Strategies for defensive computing could be divided into two categories, network security and the backup and restoration of data. == Network security == Users put their computers at risk when accessing the Internet and other networks. The use of either of these allows others to gain access to a user's system and important information. By implementing certain strategies, defensive users aim to reduce the risk associated with network access. === Firewall === A firewall is a collection of security measures that protects a computer from harmful inbound and outbound traffic on the Internet and prevents the unauthorized access of computer systems.http://www.cs.unm.edu/~treport/tr/02-12/firewall.pdf, A History and Survey of Network Firewalls These security measures are integrated into the form of special software that runs autonomously either on individual computer systems, or externally through built in software within routers and modems. Not all firewall software will protect computers from sending unauthorized or harmful outbound traffic. An important defensive computing strategy is to seek and implement quality firewall software that filters both inbound and outbound traffic.http://news.cnet.com/8301-13554_3-9923976-33.html, The Pillars of Defensive Computing === Anti-malware software === A basic strategy for all defensive computer users is to install and use anti-malware software. Firewalls may not completely protect a computer. Malicious software may be able to get through a firewall and onto a system. Anti-Malware such as anti- virus, anti-phishing and email filtering software offer some protection against harmful software that reside within a computer. The amount of malicious software available over the Internet is steadily increasing.https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp- dyn/content/article/2008/03/19/AR2008031901439.html, Antivirus Firms Scrambling to Keep Up It is important for defensive users to use to anti- malware that is both effective and easily updated in order to combat new strains of malicious software that are developed. The other side of anti malware is that it contains serious vulnerabilities itself https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2016/06/how-to-compromise-enterprise- endpoint.html Security Products Contain Critical Vulnerabilities. A malware could use vulnerabilities of anti-malware to launch malicious code. Anti- malware works by scanning files an network connections for known signatures. Those signatures can never be up to date. To be able to scan network connections, encryptions (SSL/TLS) need to be bypassed or even broken by anti- malware software. When monitoring emails anti-malware opens all attachments for analysis, a bug in this scanner can be used as a starting point for malware. Attackers just need to send malware to a mailbox that is scanned automatically. It is questionable if malware scanners are even useful at all. Ex Mozilla developer Rober O'Callahan writes in his blog that anti malware software should be disabled (except windows defender)https://robert.ocallahan.org/2017/01/disable-your-antivirus-software- except.html Disable Your Antivirus Software (Except Microsoft's) === Skepticism === An important aspect of defensive computing is for users to be skeptical of the data to which they have access via the Internet.http://www.melbpc.org.au/pcupdate/2206/2206article6.htm , How To Protect Yourself From Virus Infection Malicious software can exist in a multitude of different forms and many are misleading to general computer users and even some anti-malware software. Defensive users think critically about the information they can access, to reduce their chances of downloading and spreading malicious software. Strategies include scanning email attachments prior to opening them and manually filtering suspicious emails from inboxes. Users should be aware of persuasive subject lines and headings in emails from any address, as they may actually contain malicious software or spam, which can mislead users into false advertisement resulting in identity theft. Defensive users can scan files they download prior to opening them and can also configure their computers to show file extensions, revealing potentially dangerous files that appear harmless. Skepticism can also be applied to the websites visited by users. As with emails, users can be led to false advertisements. Also, malicious software can unknowingly be downloaded and infect a computer, just by visiting a certain website. == Backup and recovery procedures == Despite the efforts of a defensive computer user, the loss of important data can occur due to malware, power outages, equipment failure and general misuse. Although the loss of data cannot be completely prevented, defensive users can take steps to minimize the amount of data lost and restore systems to their previous state. === Backup of files === A defensive strategy against unintentional data loss is the regular backup of important files. Users can make multiple copies of important data and store them either on the same computer or on another device such as a compact disc or an external hard drive.http://www.microsoft.com/protect/yourself/data/what.mspx, How to Decide what Data to Back Up Users can also upload important files to the Internet, provided they have access to Internet storage services. === Restoration === Some operating systems give users the option of performing a procedure that restores a computer to a predetermined state. If no option is available, a user can obtain the appropriate restoration software for their system. In the event of a system failure or a serious case of data loss, a user can restore any lost or changed files and remove any malicious files that did not previously exist. == Good practices for protecting data == * Regularly backup important files, documents and emails. * Do not use the administrator account for day-to-day activities. * Keep software up-to-date with the latest versions. * Keep antivirus and antispyware up-to-date with latest versions. * Use different passwords * Disable auto run feature from USB flash drives. Some viruses, specially worms, spread automatically through USB flash drives http://news.cnet.com/8301-13554_3-10027754-33.html, Be safer than NASA: Disable autorun * Always connect to the Internet behind a firewall * When in doubt, throw it out == See also == * Stopping e-mail abuse * Phishing * Computer insecurity * End-user computing * Network security * Computer worm * Computer security * Defense strategy (computing) == References  * Defensive computing priorities by Michael Horowitz December 2009 Category:Computer security Category:Backup ","title":"Defensive computing"},{"id":"6212032","text":"Kamvounia () is a former municipality in Kozani regional unit, West Macedonia, Greece.

It features 40 cars based on the Hot Wheels series of toys. It also features Kyle Petty's 1999 NASCAR stock car, as it was sponsored by Hot Wheels. The game features music from artists like Primus, Metallica, The Reverend Horton Heat and Mix Master Mike. ==Gameplay== Gameplay on the Nintendo 64. The focus of the game is racing one of a selection of vehicles through various themed race tracks. Secret tracks can be unlocked by winning races and new cars can be used by finding 'Mystery Car' bonuses hidden in each track. Six vehicles participate in each race. The game features a total of 40 playable vehicles. Stunts can be executed by holding the directional pad or analog stick in certain directions while in mid-air to add to the turbo meter for increased speed. As seen in the hint screens, using the controller to perform various stunts from jumping-off points gains 'Turbos' which allow short bursts of speed. The car in use will take damage based on running into obstacles or other cars. Power-up icons found around the track give various performance enhancements. ==Reception== Hot Wheels Turbo Racing received above-average reviews on both platforms according to video game review aggregator GameRankings. Doug Trueman reviewed the Nintendo 64 version of the game for Next Generation, rating it three stars out of five, and stated that \\"All in all, a fun title and a great party game, but perhaps a bit childish for hardcore racing fans.\\" Scott McCall of AllGame called the Nintendo 64 version \\"somewhat fun and original to play,\\" but criticized its \\"average\\" sound effects and \\"very limited and repetitive\\" songs, which he felt were of poor quality. McCall called the game \\"a little disappointing in the graphics department,\\" writing that it \\"seems like a CD-ROM game that was ported to the cartridge format quickly and cheaply. It's noticeable because of the limited, muffled sound, the lackluster graphics, and the lack of a four-player mode.\\" Joe Ottoson of AllGame wrote a positive review of the PlayStation version and praised its soundtrack, although he noted that the sound effects \\"aren't quite as high budget, but the screeching tires and colliding cars provide a convincing supplement to the action.\\" Ottoson wrote that the game's vehicles \\"resemble their real-life counterparts and the game speeds along without any slowdown,\\" while also stating that its race tracks \\"seem to stick with the toy stunt track origins of the subject matter by using an array of vibrant colors on the backgrounds. They often reminded me of something that had escaped from a Tim Burton movie with the prodigious usage of stripes and cheerful colors.\\" Levi Buchanan of GameFan praised the Nintendo 64 version for its \\"Good bands,\\" but criticized the game itself as \\"Mediocre,\\" writing, \\"The game must have so few merits, that they need a professional soundtrack to add a bullet point to the list of features on the back of the box. [...] Nothing in Hot Wheels raises it above the level of average.\\" Buchanan felt that the Hot Wheels license was the only difference separating the game from other racing games. Jeff Gerstmann of GameSpot praised both versions for their graphics and wrote that the game \\"captures the look and feel of those popular little cars and manages to deliver a surprisingly excellent gaming experience along the way. At first glance, it's easy to dismiss Hot Wheels Turbo Racing as just another racing game. [...] But the cars and tracks are what make it so different. [...] It's a shame that many will underestimate Hot Wheels Turbo Racing just because it's got the toy-car license attached to it. The driving is great, and the stunt aspect of the game gives it a skateboard-like feel. It's definitely poised to become a sleeper hit.\\" GamePro praised the Nintendo 64 version for its soundtrack and wrote, \\"The graphics look much cleaner on the N64 than the PlayStation, with the accurately modeled cars looking less blocky. [...] While the N64 version looks better than the Playstation version, the controls are not as tight. The Playstation's dual analog sticks are more responsive than the cluttered default button arrangement on N64, which also offers a less precise analog stick for steering. But quibbling aside, the N64 offers solid controls for the cars.\\" GamePro wrote that one of the top attributes of the game \\"is how it perfectly integrates performing tricks with successful racing.\\" Reviewing the PlayStation version, GamePro considered one of the game's best aspects to be its use of the console's DualShock controller, and wrote, \\"There are some mud spots that the game gets mired in. Although the 3D models of the cars are right on the money, they are somewhat blocky and the rolling, flipping, and twisting metal does tend to go on for longer than it should. Collisions with opposing racers have a sometimes unpredictable outcome, making the action very frustrating when trying to win the Hot Wheels Cup. Worst of all, though, is that there's no damage meter to clue you in when you're about to blow up. Nitpicking aside, Hot Wheels Turbo Racing does pulse- pounding fun like few other titles. EA makes perfect use of the Hot Wheels name, including the classic loops and car colliding track designs, to insure lots of repeat play-ability in this fun and fresh racer.\\" Game Revolution, which felt that the game was best suited for young children, praised the PlayStation version for its soundtrack but called the graphics a \\"mixed bag,\\" writing, \\"The cars and tracks look pretty good and the frame rate is pretty fast, but the look of the tracks doesn't seem quite right. In my imagination, Hot Wheels would be raced on toy tracks through the back yard, on table tops, or in toy rooms. Instead, the tracks are a mix of real-life terrain, industrial areas and other random places. If the designers had truly wanted to capture the feel of racing little toy cars, they should've taken this into consideration and let you burn rubber in the kitchen. What we're left with is a game that tries to put toy cars into a quasi-real environment. There are plenty of jumps and loops, but their toy-like qualities clash with the natural environments. On the plus side, the cars look true to life and really bring back some memories.\\" Matt Casamassina of IGN praised the graphics of the Nintendo 64 version, writing that Stormfront Studios had \\"successfully translated the look of Hot Wheels plastic tracks into the world of polygons. Hot Wheels Turbo Racing features roads that glow bright red, stripe yellow and orange, green, blue -- everything but black, really. While these tracks are most definitely reminiscent of the toy courses they were inspired by, as a game we must admit that they still come off looking overly tacky and far too bright in appearance. [...] Because background graphics are of a much more realistic tone, the end effect is certainly unique, if not confusing. We end up with rainbow roads stretching through realistic environments. A bit odd to be sure, but it works. Vehicles, meanwhile, which are the classic Hot Wheels collection, come to life with solid polygon models and detailed textures. The colorful environments themselves, it must be said, are not overly detailed.\\" Casamassina noted that the game had a \\"very polygon look,\\" giving background objects and roads a \\"blocky appearance\\". Casamassina felt that the game looked outdated in comparison to other racing games of that time, and wrote that he preferred \\"the wide-open, go-anywhere racing environments and heavy car physics of the Rush series to Hot Wheels' seemingly weightless cars and sometimes confined 3D tracks. With that said, the title comes recommended as a good racer that's going to appeal to stunt-lovers and not simulation junkies.\\" Max Everingham of IGN praised the PlayStation version for its soundtrack and noted gameplay similarities to the San Francisco Rush games, which also incorporated high jumps and mid-air stunts; Everingham said that Hot Wheels Turbo Racing's version of this concept was \\"fun, but it's also really easy. The learning curve is short and the long-term play life is moderate. Taking cues from Beetle Adventure Racing, Hot Wheels is also packed with alternate courses and secrets. Here, it's still intriguing finding them all, but it doesn't feel as original or as compelling.\\" Everingham called the graphics \\"a little too bright and in your face,\\" and concluded, \\"If you wished SF Rush had more control and less randomness, then you'll love this. Hot Wheels does a little of everything pretty well, but doesn't execute everything well enough to remain a standout game for more than a month.\\" ==References * Category:1999 video games Category:Hot Wheels video games Category:Nintendo 64 games Category:PlayStation (console) games Category:Racing video games Category:Video games based on toys Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games ","title":"Hot Wheels Turbo Racing"},{"id":"6212071","text":"Neapoli () is a town and a former municipality in Kozani regional unit, West Macedonia, Greece.

Although he coveted a peerage and spent a fortune in pursuit of that aim, he had to be content with a baronetcy. Lloyd claimed descent from ancient Welsh families and placed great emphasis on these connections. He rebuilt Bronwydd as a Victorian Gothic fantasy 1853-1856\\\\. The house is now a ruin, in the process of clearance. Lloyd restored the old castle at Newport, Pembrokeshire as a seat for his 'Marcher Lordship' of Cemais and Llangynllo Church. His chivalric fantasies left the estate deeply in debt. ==Early life== He was the son of Thomas Lloyd of Cilrhiwe and Bronwydd, Cardiganshire, who had been the High Sheriff of Cardiganshire in 1814. His mother, Ann, was the daughter of John Thomas of Llwydcoed, Carmarthenshire. His father played an active role in Pembrokeshire politics and nominated Lord Emlyn as member for the county in 1841. He was educated at Harrow School and Christ Church, Oxford. In 1840, he joined the 13th Light Dragoons, and was a commander in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada with the 82nd Foot. ==Landowner== Upon the death of his father in 1845, Lloyd returned to Wales, and on 21 January 1846 he married Henrietta Mary, fourth daughter of George Reid, Esquire, of Watlington Hall, Norfolk, and Jamaica. He served as High Sheriff of Cardiganshire in 1851. He inherited the title of 24th Marcher Lord of Cemaes, which gave him authority to hold a Court Leet and other ceremonial occasions such as beating the bounds at Newport, Pembrokeshire. Very little authority rested with these ancient privileges by this time although he has the right to appoint the Mayor of Newport. Lloyd spent a fortune on the renovation of Newport Castle as the seat of his 'marcher lordship' and seeking elevation to the peerage. He had to be content with being created a baronet in 1863. ==Political career== Throughout the 1850s, Lloyd was frequently named as a potential candidate for election to the House of Commons, either to represent Cardigan Boroughs or the more prestigious Cardiganshire county constituency. However, he was constantly reluctant to face a contested election, possibly for reasons of cost as his extravagance in rebuilding both Newport Castle and Bronwydd left the estate heavily indebted, but also due to his reluctance to create divisions among the predominantly Conservative landed gentry of Cardiganshire. For several decades, and unofficial understanding saw the county seat had been held by a Conservative while the Whig-supporting Pryse family of Gogerddan held the borough seat. Evatually, Lloyd served for a single term as member for both the county (1865–68) and the boroughs (1868-74) ===Early political activity=== An old fashioned Whig Liberal, Lloyd was first mooted as a Liberal parliamentary candidate in 1852, when there was a requisition urging him to contest the Cardigan Boroughs in opposition to Pryse Loveden of Gogerddan. He declined. In 1854, following the resignation of Colonel W.E. Powell who had served as MP for Cardiganshire for 38 years. The Earl of Lisburne emerged as the favoured candidate but given his Conservative political views, there was speculation that he would be opposed by a Liberal candidate. Lloyd was mentioned as the most likely to stand. However, support from the Pryse family of Gogerddan was not forthcoming and Lloyd chose not to contest the seat. Lloyd was mentioned as a possible candidate for Cardigan Boroughs at the 1857 General Election, in opposition to John Lloyd Davies who had unexpectedly captured the seat at the 1855 by-election. However, Edward Pryse, a member of the influential Gogerddan family chose to contest the seat, and was supported by Lloyd. Subsequently, a requisition was presented to Lloyd to contest the county seat in opposition to the Earl of Lisburne, and even at a late stage he was expected to go to the poll and is to have a chance of success. However, Lloyd withdrew and Lisburne was returned unopposed. ===The 1859 General Election=== In 1859 it was again suggested that Lloyd would contest the county seat. Although scarcely a radical, Lloyd received strong support from the Welsh language radical press. The Aberdare-based Gwladgarwr, for example, deprecated the fact that two Conservatives, namely Colonel Powell of Nanteos and Arthur Saunders-Davies, were contesting Cardiganshire. In Baner Cymru, Thomas Gee was more strident, and strongly supported Lloyd. However, Lloyd again refused the invitation, citing a reluctance to take advantage of a division in the Conservative party in the county. Reluctance to oppose a fellow member of the landed gentry would be a charge levied against Lloyd at the subsequent election. Powell was returned by a fairly narrow margin. Lloyd, meanwhile, became involved in Pembrokeshire county politics, proposing Sir Hugh Owen of Orielton as Liberal candidate at the by-election held in January 1861. Owen, like Lloyd was in favour of \\"a slow and safe reform\\" rather than more radical politics, but was defeated at the election by the Conservative candidate, George Lort Phillips. ===The 1865 General Election=== Prior to the 1865 General Election, Colonel Powell, the sitting member for the Cardiganshire county constituency had indicated his intention to retire. As a leading landowner in the south of the county, Lloyd emerged as the Liberal candidate. However, when Powell reversed his decision, Lloyd issued an address stating that he would not oppose the sitting member. This reflected the fact that the Powell family, with one short interval in the 1850s, had held the county seat since 1816 and their claim to the seat had been widely accepted by the landowners of the county. The result was that both Henry Richard and David Davies, Llandinam offered themselves as alternative Liberal candidates. A selection meeting was arranged to be held at Aberaeron, but shortly before this took place, Powell again announced his retirement. Lloyd now stated that he would now fight the seat after all and Richard withdrew in his favour. David Davies, however, did not withdraw, and proceeded to oppose Lloyd. Davies had a number of advantages, including the employment opportunities created by his railway building schemes. However, Lloyd was supported by those landowners who were associated with the Whig tradition, including Pryse family of Gogerddan who heavily influenced the politics of Aberystwyth. Also, a significant minority of nonconformists supported Lloyd. Lloyd won the seat with a majority of 361 votes. Lloyd was ahead in four of the six polling districts,including Cardigan, where Lloyd polled 360 votes against a mere 65 for Davies. Lloyd trailed Lloyd by a narrow margin in the Lampeter district and was only heavily defeated in the Tregaron area, a result attributed to the coming of the railway and Davies's Calvinistic Methodist connections. Despite his victory, the contest had been a costly one for Lloyd. His opponent was a wealthy man, who had deposited £10,000 in an Aberystwyth bank as \\"ale money for the battle\\". After the election, Davies made significant contributions to chapels in the north of the county where Lloyd had won by a small margin. As the next election approached, Lloyd announced that he would not bear the cost of another contested election for the county. He was however prepared to transfer to the borough seat in the event that the sitting member, Colonel Edward Pryse, decided to retire. ===Member for Cardigan Boroughs, 1868-74=== In 1868, Lloyd wished to avoid the financial burden of another contested election. When a Conservative, Ernest Vaughan, nephew of the Earl of Lisburne, announced that he would contest the county seat as a Conservative candidate, a contest was inevitable and Lloyd was determined not to stand even though his erstwhile opponent David Davies offered £500 to start a fund to contest the election. A few weeks earlier, a Liberal meeting at Aberaeron offered him the opportunity of contesting the county again but at the same time the sitting member for Cardigan Boroughs, Edward Pryse, was obliged to step down to allow Lloyd to be returned for that constituency. The county seat was in due course won by Evan Mathew Richards and Lloyd served as member for Cardigan until 1874. By 1873 there were rumours of potential opposition to Lloyd by a wing of the Liberal Party that did not consider his views to be sufficiently advanced. However, David Davies indicated that he would not oppose Lloyd for the boroughs seat. Lloyd died on 21 July 1877 and was buried six days later in the family vault at Llangunllo church. He was succeeded by his son, Sir Marteine Lloyd, 2nd Baronet. ==NotesReferencesSourcesBooks and journals=== *James & Thomas, 'Wales at Westminster' * * *Leslie Baker-Jones, 'The Wolf and the Boar: The Lloyds of Bronwydd Cardiganshire: Lords Marcher of Cemais' ===Online=== * == External links == * Category:1820 births Category:1877 deaths Category:Baronets in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom Category:High Sheriffs of Cardiganshire Category:Members of Parliament for Cardiganshire Category:Liberal Party (UK) MPs for Welsh constituencies Category:People educated at Harrow School Category:Alumni of Christ Church, Oxford Category:UK MPs 1865–1868 Category:UK MPs 1868–1874 ","title":"Sir Thomas Lloyd, 1st Baronet"},{"id":"6212104","text":"Fiorina may refer to: ==People with the surname== * Alejandro Fiorina (born 1988), an Argentine footballer * Betty Fiorina (c. 1920–2010), an American politician * Carly Fiorina (born 1954), business executive and 2016 presidential candidate * Morris P.

Vrteski was signed from the Australian Institute of Sport and was the youngest player in the A-League for the 2006-07 season.

Known for his versatility, his main position is as a central midfielder, but he also played regularly at fullback during his career. Hughes played over 100 games for each of Notts County, Reading and Leeds United. ==Playing career== Hughes began his career at Oldham Athletic making 44 appearances scoring once before joining Notts County, where he made 130 appearances scoring 18 times. At Notts County Hughes helped earn them the Division Three championship. ===Reading=== He joined Reading on 5 July 2001 on a three-year deal as a replacement for Darren Caskey, but Notts County and Reading failed to agree a transfer fee and this was later set at around £250,000 by a tribunal. Hughes became an important player for Reading and helped earn the side promotion to the First Division of The Football League, finishing second in the Nationwide League Division Two. His earlier seasons at Reading had seen him play in his preferred midfield role and he flourished, going on to make 183 appearances and scoring 19 times. ===Norwich=== Hughes joined Norwich from Reading on 21 July 2005 for a fee believed to be around £500,000. He endured a tough start to his Norwich career, as his own form and that of the team was poor for much of the 2005–06 season. In 2006–07 season, new manager Peter Grant used him more as a utility player, covering on either wing or full back position. Hughes played 41 games that season. ===Leeds United=== Hughes moved to Leeds United on a two-year deal on 9 August 2007 for an undisclosed fee. Hughes joined Leeds the same day that the club was docked 15 points in League 1. In an interview, Hughes explained his reasons for leaving Norwich: \\"Dennis Wise told me the challenge and the position the club was in. He wants fighters and I felt the challenge of playing for Leeds United and Dennis Wise was too good to turn down ... The manager at Norwich told me he didn't want me to leave, but I didn't want to stay and be a squad player.\\" He scored his first and what turned out to be only goal for Leeds on 19 April against Millwall, tapping in from close range to finish a flowing move that Hughes had himself started on the edge of Millwall's box. His first season at Leeds saw Hughes play an important squad role by being used in a variety of positions, which saw Leeds get to the playoff final against Doncaster Rovers in League One. Leeds lost the game 1–0 and remained in League One. The following season Hughes again was played in a variety of roles, and was mainly used off the bench. Leeds after a stuttering start managed to get into the play-offs after new manager Simon Grayson rejuvenated Leeds. Leeds lost out in the semi-finals of the play-offs against Millwall after losing 2–1 on aggregate. At Leeds, Hughes was mainly used as a utility player, playing in various positions. He started the 2009–10 season playing for Leeds at left back due to the absence of Ben Parker through injury. Hughes missed a few games himself with an injury but returned to the Leeds side playing in either full back position, eventually ousting loan signing Tony Capaldi at left back. Hughes played for Leeds against Manchester United when Leeds won 1–0 at Old Trafford on 3 January 2010 in the FA Cup. However, Hughes picked up an injury against Manchester United and was not fit enough to be involved in the following game against Wycombe Wanderers, but returned to the line-up in the next game, against Exeter City. He played left back for Leeds when they earned a 2–2 draw against Tottenham Hotspur in the FA Cup on 23 January. Hughes played an instrumental part as Leeds were promoted to the Football League Championship after finishing in second place in League One and thus earning automatic promotion. Of the 33 games Leeds won, Hughes started in 32 of them. On 26 May 2010, Hughes signed a new one-year deal with the club. After being an unnamed substitute against Derby County, Hughes came on as a second-half substitute in the following game against Lincoln City. He also came on as a half time substitute in the 1–0 win against Watford where he played at left back after regular left back Fede Bessone picked up an injury. On 8 January 2011, Hughes came on as a second-half substitute and helped earn Leeds a 1–1 draw against Arsenal. Leeds were 1–0 up from a Robert Snodgrass second half penalty, before Arsenal equalised in the 90th minute when Cesc Fabregas also scored a penalty.http://www.leedsunited.com/news/20110108/late- leveller-denies-united-arsenal-scalp_2247585_2260931 Hughes left the club after waving goodbye to the fans after the FA Cup Replay at Elland Road against Arsenal, where he was an unused substitute.http://www.leedsunited.com/news/20110119/gallant-united-bow- out_2247585_2270990 Hughes' totemic status at Leeds was due more to his willingness to work hard in whichever position he was asked to play, his humility, and his rapport with fans and teammates, than to any exceptional football ability. The esteem he is held in by the club's fans is evident in the popular chant 'Andy Hughes is fucking brilliant', and in the continued use of a photograph of him as the website banner of fan magazine The Square Ball, even after he left the club. ===Scunthorpe United=== On 21 January 2011, it was announced Hughes would join Scunthorpe United on an 18-month contract. ===Charlton Athletic=== On 1 August 2011, Hughes was transferred from Scunthorpe to Charlton Athletic. He made his debut on 13 August 2011 after coming on as a substitute against his former club Notts County. He made 15 league appearances in the 2011–12 season, however he played his last game of the season in January in a 4–0 FA Cup loss to Premier League side Fulham after sustaining an Achilles injury while playing golf. The injury consequently needed surgery and kept him out until February the following year. After 13 months out with injury, Hughes played his first game in a 0–0 draw in a development squad match against Millwall in which he was one of three over 21 players permitted. He returned to the first team starting line-up on 30 March 2013 in the 3–2 win against Bolton Wanderers, and made his first appearance for the side since returning to the Championship. On 29 May 2013 Hughes signed a new one-year contract to stay with the club till 2014. On 7 May 2014, it was confirmed that Hughes was leaving Charlton. ==Coaching career== On 22 July 2014, Hughes joined Football League Championship club Bolton Wanderers as their Professional Development Coach. Hughes also continued his registration as a player with the Bolton squad, taking his career into a nineteenth season. On 3 October 2014 it was announced that Hughes and fellow coach Lee Turner would take charge of Bolton in the interim following the departure of manager Dougie Freedman. In his only game in caretaker charge, Bolton lost 2–1 at home against Bournemouth In December 2015, Hughes joined Championship club Rotherham United as their First Team Development Coach. He left the club in February 2016. On 3 March 2016, he joined Crystal Palace's first team coaching setup and took his first session at the club's training ground. Hughes played for Alan Pardew while the duo were at Reading, between 2001 and 2003. Hughes had a positive impact in his short spell with the team keeping its premiership status for a record 4th consecutive season and reaching the FA cup final only to lose to Manchester United in extra time . On 26 May 2016, he joined fellow Championship side Huddersfield Town as their new first-team coach, replacing the departed Mike Marsh, who joined up with the England national under-17 football team. The decision to bring Hughes in as first team coach proved yet again to be a success and have another positive impact with in the club, assisting David Wagner in gaining promotion to the Premier League and creating history in their first full season together. When Wagner left Huddersfield by mutual consent in January 2019, Hughes stopped working with Huddersfield on a day-to-day basis and his departure, along with that of assistant head coach Christoph Bühler, was officially confirmed at the end of the 2018–19 season upon Huddersfield's relegation from the Premier League. The following season Hughes was approached for his services by newly promoted Sheffield United to take the role of lead U23 coach which he accepted after turning other first team opportunities down . Hughes spent a full season in charge of the U23s enjoying and learning the Sheffield Utd identity and tactical principles of their exciting system under LMA manager of the year Chris Wilder and his loyal assistant Alan Knill. On 12 August 2020, he joined Sheffield Wednesday as first team coach. ==Managerial statistics== {  style=\\"text- align: center\\" - !rowspan=\\"2\\"Team !rowspan=\\"2\\"Nat !rowspan=\\"2\\"From !rowspan=\\"2\\"To !colspan=\\"5\\"Record - !G!!W!!D!!L!!Win % - align=leftBolton Wanderers (caretaker)  align=left3 October 2014 align=left12 October 2014 10010.00 } ==HonoursClub=== ;Notts County *Division Three Champions: 1997–98 ;Reading *Division Two Runners Up (Promoted): 2001–02 ;Leeds United *League One Runners Up (Promoted): 2009–10 *League One Playoff final runner up 2007–08 ;Charlton Athletic *League One Champions (Promoted): 2011–12 ===Personal=== ;Club Awards *Leeds United Player of the Year Awards – 2007–08: The chairman's Special Award *Leeds United Player of the Year Awards – 2008–09: Best Contribution to the Community Award ==Career statistics== {  style=\\"text- align: center;\\" - !rowspan=\\"2\\"Season !rowspan=\\"2\\"Club !rowspan=\\"2\\"Division !colspan=\\"2\\"League !colspan=\\"2\\"FA Cup !colspan=\\"2\\"League Cup !colspan=\\"2\\"FL Trophy !colspan=\\"2\\"Play-offs !colspan=\\"2\\"Total !colspan=\\"2\\"Discipline - !Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!! alt=A yellow card !! alt=A red card -  2012–13  rowspan=2Charlton Athletic  Championship  1  0  0  0  0  0  –  –  –  – ! 0 !! 0  0  0 -  2011–12  League One  15  0  2  0  2  0  1  0  –  – ! 20 !! 0  0  0 -  2010–11  rowspan=1Scunthorpe United  Championship  19  0  0  0  0  0  –  –  –  – ! 19 !! 0  0  0 -  2010–11  rowspan=4Leeds United  Championship  10  0  1  0  2  0  –  –  –  – ! 13 !! 0  0  0 -  2009–10  League One  39  0  5  0  3  0  4  0  –  – ! 51 !! 0  3  0 -  2008–09  League One  27  0  2  0  2  0  1  0  0  0 ! 32 !! 0  0  0 -  2007–08  League One  40  1  1  0  0  0  0  0  2  0 ! 43 !! 1  10  0 -  2006–07  rowspan=2Norwich City  Championship  36  0  3  0  2  0  –  –  –  – ! 41 !! 0  5  0 -  2005–06  Championship  36  2  0  0  2  0  –  –  –  – ! 38 !! 2  5  0 -  2004–05  rowspan=4Reading  Championship  41  0  3  0  2  0  –  –  –  – ! 46 !! 0  2  0 -  2003–04  Division One  43  3  1  0  4  0  –  –  –  – ! 48 !! 3  4  0 -  2002–03  Division One  43  9  1  0  1  0  –  –  2  0 ! 47 !! 9  3  0 -  2001–02  Division Two  39  6  2  0  0  0  1  0  –  – ! 42 !! 6  3  0 -  2000–01  rowspan=4Notts County  Division Two  30  5  5  2  2  1  0  0  –  – ! 37 !! 8  0  1 -  1999–00  Division Two  35  7  2  0  4  0  1  0  –  – ! 42 !! 7  4  0 -  1998–99  Division Two  30  0  3  0  1  0  1  0  –  – ! 35 !! 0  2  0 -  1997–98  Division Three  15  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  –  – ! 15 !! 0  1  0 -  1997–98  rowspan=3Oldham Athletic  Division Two  10  0  1  0  1  0  1  0  –  – ! 13 !! 0  0  0 -  1996–97  Division One  8  0  0  0  1  0  –  –  –  – ! 9 !! 0  1  0 -  1995–96  Division One  15  1  3  0  0  0  –  –  –  – ! 18 !! 1  0  0 - ! colspan=3Career Total !502!!35!!33!!2!!27!!1!!12!!0!!4!!0!!575!!37!!43!!1 } :(correct as of 26 August 2012) ==References * Andrew Hughes profile at scunthorpe-united.co.uk * Category:Living people Category:1978 births Category:Footballers from Stockport Category:English footballers Category:Association football midfielders Category:Oldham Athletic A.F.C. players Category:Notts County F.C. players Category:Reading F.C. players Category:Norwich City F.C. players Category:Leeds United F.C. players Category:Scunthorpe United F.C. players Category:Charlton Athletic F.C. players Category:Bolton Wanderers F.C. players Category:English Football League players Category:Bolton Wanderers F.C. non-playing staff ","title":"Andrew Hughes (footballer, born 1978)"},{"id":"6212141","text":"Pego may refer to: * Pego (Abrantes), a Portuguese parish, located in the municipality of Abrantes * Pego, Alicante, a Spanish municipality located in the province of Alicante ","title":"Pego"},{"id":"6212169","text":"The Pakistan Hockey Federation () is the governing body for the sport of field hockey in Pakistan.

The Pakistan Hockey Federation came into being in 1948,History of Pakistan Hockey Federation on Pakistan Olympic Association website Retrieved 13 January 2020 following the independence of Pakistan in 1947. Prior to this, players from what is now Pakistan had competed internationally alongside players from what is now India. In the beginning, the Federation's membership included the provincial hockey federations of Punjab, Sindh, Balochistan, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, Bahawalpur, East Bengal and the Pakistani Armed Forces Sports Board. Pakistan played their first international game in London when they defeated Belgium 2-1 at the 14th Olympic Games on 2 August 1948. The first President of PHF was Ghazanfar Ali Khan with Baseer Ali Sheikh as the Honorary Secretary. The Pakistan national side soon established a strong reputation in international competition, helping to maintain interest in the game in Pakistan which assisted the growth of the Federation. However, no full-time central office or secretariat, as such, was established until the 1960s. The office of the Pakistan Hockey Federation, located at the National Hockey Stadium was developed into a secretariat in 1971. It was during the second term as president of Air Marshal Nur Khan from 1978 that Pakistani hockey entered a golden age. National Senior, National Junior and Women hockey teams were all competing internationally. On the personal initiative of Air Marshal M. Nur Khan, the FIH introduced the World Cup tournament and the Champions Trophy tournament, which are now rated among field hockey's major international tournaments, alongside the Olympics. However, the 1976 Olympics in Montreal had seen the introduction of artificial turf to international hockey competition. Pakistan was unable to build many artificial turf pitches compared to the Europeans and thus the strength of the national side began declining slowly. ==Affiliated associations== * Azad Jammu and Kashmir Hockey Association * Balochistan Hockey Association * Federally Administered Tribal Areas Hockey Association * Gilgit-Baltistan Hockey Association * Islamabad Hockey Association * Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Hockey Association * Punjab Hockey Association * Sindh Hockey Association ==Presidents== # Raja Ghazanfar Ali Khan (1948–50) # Chaudhry Nazir Ahmed (1950–52) # Khan Abdul-Qayyum Khan (1952–54) # Nawab Mushtaq Ahmed Gurmani (1955–56) # Mian Naseer Ahmed (1956–59) # General Muhammad Musa (1960–66) # Air Marshal Nur Khan (1967–69) # Lieutenant General Khwaja Mohammad Azhar Khan (1969–71) # Nawab Sadiq Hussain Qureshi (1971–76) # Air Marshal Nur Khan (1976–84) # Air Vice-Marshal Waqar Azeem (1984–86) # Air Marshal Azim Daudpota (1986–90) # Air Chief Marshal Farooq Feroze Khan (1990–91) # M Nawaz Tiwana (1991–93) # Air Vice-Marshal Farooq Umar (1993–96) # M Nawaz Tiwana (1996–97) # Akhtar Rasool Chaudhry (1997–99) # Arif Ali Khan Abbasi (1999–2000) # General Aziz Khan (2000–05) # Tariq Kirmani (2005–06) # Mir Zafarullah Khan Jamali (2006–2008) # Qasim Zia (2008-2013) # Akhtar Rasool (2013-2015) # Brigadier (Retired) Khalid S.

A critical apparatus () in textual criticism of primary source material, is an organized system of notations to represent, in a single text, the complex history of that text in a concise form useful to diligent readers and scholars. The apparatus typically includes footnotes, standardized abbreviations for the source manuscripts, and symbols for denoting recurring problems (one symbol for each type of scribal error). :The fullness of the critical apparatus may excite surprise. The object of a critical apparatus, as I conceive it, is to enable the earnest student to form his own text. It is therefore an editor's duty to give all the material variants of all the independent manuscripts. It is particularly his duty in a case like the present where there are many passages of which he can give no satisfactory explanation. ==Shakespearean studies== Many editions employ a standard format for a critical apparatus, as illustrated by a line from Hamlet, which the Oxford Complete Works (1988) prints as follows:William Shakespeare, The Complete Works (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1991), p. 682 The apparatus for the line might be rendered as:Suggested by Stanley Wells and Gary Taylor, William Shakespeare: A Textual Companion (New York: W. W. Norton & Company, 1997), p. 408. The format of the apparatus has several parts: * The location of the variant in the text (act, scene, line number) * The lemma, which is the portion of the text to which the note applies * A right bracket (]) * The source from which the edition took its reading * A list of variants, in each case followed by the source in which the variant is found, and set off with a semicolon. To save space, frequently cited sources are usually assigned an abbreviation called a siglum. In Shakespeare editions, F always signifies the First Folio; the second through fourth folios are referred to as F2 through F4 respectively. Similarly, Q1 is the first quarto, Q2 the second quarto, and Q3 the third. In the example given, the first folio (F) and the three early quartos (Q1 to Q3) each have a different reading of the line in question. The editors have concluded that all four early sources are corrupt, and instead have adopted a reading suggested by G. R. Hibbard. Other editors of the play may choose a different reading of the line. The apparatus summarizes all of the textual evidence, allowing readers to assess for themselves whether the editor has made the best choice. Sometimes the editor will add a commentary, defending the choice made, explaining why other readings were rejected, or discussing how other editors have treated the passage. This format has been used for critical apparatuses of Shakespeare and many other authors. In variorum editions, the apparatus is often placed at the bottom of the page. Sometimes a three-part format is employed, with the main text at the top of the page, textual variants in the middle, and the editor's commentary at the bottom. This remains the most common format for Shakespeare editions, although the Oxford Complete Works breaks with tradition by putting its critical apparatus in a separately published volume. ==New Testament studies== The first printed edition of the New Testament with critical apparatus, noting variant readings among the manuscripts, was produced by the printer Robert Estienne of Paris in 1550. The Greek text of this edition and of those of Erasmus became known as the Textus Receptus (Latin for \\"received text\\"), a name given to it in the Elzevier edition of 1633, which termed it as the text nunc ab omnibus receptum (\\"now received by all\\"). The Novum Testamentum Graece (1st edition 1898, 28th edition 2014) uses a system of sigla created by Caspar René Gregory in 1908, and extended by Kurt Aland, known as Gregory–Aland numbering; these sigla are widely used in academic writing about the Greek text. The most important uncials are given Hebrew, Roman, or Greek letter names: ( Codex Sinaiticus), A ( Codex Alexandrinus), Dp (Codex Claromontanus), or Ξ (Codex Zacynthius). The papyri are assigned the Blackletter character \\\\mathfrak{P} followed by a superscript number. Here, Papyrus Oxyrhynchus 208 + 1781 (parts of the Gospel of John) is and the Chester Beatty Papyri, which contains the Gospels and Acts, is . The superscript numbers follow the order of registration, and do not reflect the age of the manuscript or order of importance. The minuscules are given plain numbers, and the lectionaries are notated by script (ℓ), ranging from ℓ 1 up to ℓ 2463. ==From footnotes to endnotes== In the United States, bibliographer Fredson Bowers (1905–1991) established a tradition of putting the critical apparatus at the back of the book, leaving the edited text clear of apparatus. This has the advantage of leaving the main text uncluttered with editorial details that may not be of interest to the general reader. However, this format is a disadvantage to scholarly readers, who are not able to see all of the textual evidence in one place. ==Wikipedia studies== Although Wikipedia has a sophisticated apparatus for ensuring quality control, this differs from a critical apparatus, which is intended as an aid in recovering the original form of a text from the past, because Wikipedia is oriented towards the perfection of knowledge availability in the future. However, the \\"View history\\" feature can be seen as roughly analogous, with the user names corresponding to sigla, a systematic categorization of edits (\\"rollback\\"), shorthand for edit summaries, and abbreviations for marking edits (m minor; N new) corresponding to other symbols and markings to quickly delineate recurring editorial phenomena. The ability to regenerate earlier iterations of the article is something that a traditional critical apparatus could not do: scholars had to mentally reconstruct the text, and they became quite adept at this skill. ==Electronic representation== The de facto standard for the representation of critical apparatus in digital scholarly editions is to follow the recommendations of the Text Encoding Initiative.See http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/TC.html While other formats are also used in digital literary studies this has become the most accepted storage format.

Its mobility and firing range and the effectiveness of its 44 kilogram shell made it the most important weapon of all German infantry divisions. A total of 6,756 examples were produced. It replaced the earlier, First World War-era design of the 15 cm sFH 13, which was judged by the Krupp-Rheinmetall designer team of the sFH 18 as completely inadequate. The sFH 18 was twice as heavy as its predecessor, had a muzzle velocity increase of forty percent, a maximum firing range 4.5 kilometers greater, and a new split-trail gun carriage that increased the firing traverse twelvefold. The secret development from 1926–1930 allowed German industry to deliver a trouble-free design at the beginning of German re-armament in 1933. It was the first artillery weapon equipped with rocket-assisted ammunition to increase range. The sFH 18 was also used in the self-propelled artillery piece schwere Panzerhaubitze 18/1 (more commonly known as Hummel). The sFH 18 was one of Germany's three main 15 cm calibre weapons, the others being the 15 cm Kanone 18, a corps-level heavy gun, and the 15 cm sIG 33, a short-barreled infantry gun. ==Design and development== Development work on the sFH 18 began in 1926 and the gun was ready for production by 1933. The model year was an attempt at camouflage. The gun originated with a contest between Rheinmetall and Krupp, both of whom entered several designs that were all considered unsatisfactory for one reason or another. In the end the army decided the solution was to combine the best features of both designs, using the Rheinmetall gun on a Krupp carriage.sFH 18 The carriage was a relatively standard split-trail design with box legs. Spades were carried on the sides of the legs that could be mounted onto the ends for added stability. The carriage also saw use on the 10 cm schwere Kanone 18 gun. As the howitzer was designed for horse towing, it used an unsprung axle and hard rubber tires. A two-wheel bogie was introduced to allow it to be towed, but the lack of suspension made it unsuitable for towing at high speed. The gun was officially introduced into service on 23 May 1935,Haubitzen und Mörser and by the outbreak of war the Wehrmacht had about 1,353 of these guns in service. Production continued throughout the war, reaching a peak of 2,295 guns in 1944. In 1944, the howitzer cost 40,400 RM, 9 months and 5,500 man-hours to make. ===Variants=== Several other versions of the basic 15 cm were produced: *The 15 cm sFH 36 was a version with a greatly reduced weight that was an attempt to improve mobility, but as it used various light alloys to achieve this saving it was considered too costly to continue production. *The 15 cm sFH 40 was another improved version, featuring a slightly longer barrel and a new carriage that was suitable for vehicle towing and allowed the barrel to have wider firing angles and thereby improve range up to 15,400 m. However this version was even heavier than the sFH 18 (at ) and was found to be too difficult to use in the field. Some of these barrels were later fitted to existing sFH 18 carriages, creating the sFH 18/40. *A further modification was the sFH 18/43, which changed to a split breech that allowed for the use of bagged charges instead of requiring the gunners to first put the charges into casings. *Two further attempts to introduce a newer 15 cm piece followed, but neither the 15 cm sFH 43 or 15 cm sFH 44 progressed past the stage of wooden mock-ups. {  + Production of sFH 18, pcs. !

The Chinese were desperately short on artillery guns and other heavy weapons, but the few 15 cm sFH 18 units the Chinese did have hopelessly outclassed their Japanese counterparts which were mainly the Type 38 15 cm howitzer and Type 4 15 cm howitzer, forcing the Japanese to introduce the Type 96 15 cm Howitzer. Some earlier pieces (about 24) of sFH18 in China were designed specially with a 32/L barrel, known as sFH18 32/L; the maximum range was increased to 15 km. Against the Soviet Union however, the sFH 18 proved to be greatly inferior to the Red Army corps artillery 122 mm gun (A-19) and 152 mm ML-20 gun-howitzer, whose maximum range of and allowed it to fire counter- battery against the sFH 18 with a and advantage respectively. This led to numerous efforts to introduce new guns with even better performance than the ML-20, while various experiments were also carried out on the sFH 18 to improve its range. These led to the 15 cm sFH 18M version with a removable barrel liner and a muzzle brake that allowed a larger \\"special 7\\" or 8 charge to be used. The 18M increased range to , but it was found that the liners suffered increased wear and the recoil system could not handle the increased loads in spite of the brake. This led to a more interesting modification, the introduction of the 15 cm R. Gr. 19 FES ammunition, which used a rocket- assisted round that could reach and give it some level of parity with the A-19 and ML-20. Several countries continued fielding the sFH 18 after the war in large numbers including Czechoslovakia, Portugal and many South American and Central American countries. Finland bought 48 sFH 18 howitzers from Germany in 1940 and designated them 150 H/40. These guns were modernized in 1988 as the 152 H 88, and they were used by the Finnish Army until 2007. ==Versions== 152 mm houfnice vz.18/47 in Svidnik museum *15 cm sFH 18 – standard version *15 cm sFH 36 - lightened version *15 cm sFH 18M – modification of sFH-18 with muzzle brake and replaceable barrel liner *15 cm sFH 18/40 – sFH 40 barrels on sFH 18 carriages *15 cm sFH 18/43 – a sFH 18 development to accept bag charge with sliding-block breech *15 cm sFH 18/32L – Chinese (Republic of China) version with longer barrel and longer range of 15 km *152 mm houfnice vz.18/47 – Post war Czech modification with a shorter barrel that was rebored to 152 mm, and a double-baffle muzzle brake. ==Operators== Eastern Front. 152 H 88-40.

He is a sports columnist for the Sydney Morning Herald. He was a school teacher with an interest in team psychology who enjoyed some success as a schoolboy coach before embarking on a professional coaching career in the NSWRFL Premiership. ==Family and early life== Roy was the eldest of seven children to author and journalist Olga Masters and her school teacher husband. His siblings include current affairs journalist Chris Masters, Ian Masters, a Los Angeles radio show host, Quentin Masters, a London-based film producer, Sue Masters television Producer and Deb Masters.Apter The Coaches: The Men Who Changed Rugby League == Coaching == Masters had little experience as a professional rugby league footballer having played country football as a hooker of, \\"only average ability \\" during his early teaching years at Tweed River High. He qualified as a teacher in 1963 and following posts at Tweed River and Armidale, Masters taught at Tamworth High School and coached their rugby league side to victory in the prestigious University Shield schoolboys competition.In 1972 he was selected as coach of the inaugural Australian Schoolboys representative side which featured such future stars as Ian Schubert, Craig Young, Les Boyd and Royce Ayliffe. The side toured Great Britain, going undefeated on the tour and scoring 108 tries in their 11 games to their opponents one. Masters' senior coaching career in the NSWRL commenced with a minor role with the Penrith Panthers in 1974 as one of five members of the coaching panel. At the time he was still a social science teacher at Doonside High School. In 1976 he shifted to the Western Suburbs Magpies to coach their under 23s side when Don Parish was the head coach. In 1978 he was appointed as head coach largely due to the support of senior players Tommy Raudonikis and Les Boyd. Masters re-built the Magpies, who had been in decline since suffering three successive grand final losses to St George from 1961 to 1963. He coached the Magpies to a minor premiership in 1978 and they played with consistent high quality during this period. Many acclaimed players blossomed under his tutelage, including Boyd, John Dorahy and John \\"Dallas\\" Donnelly; while the tough, uncompromising halfback Tommy Raudonikis led the side on-field. Masters was a master of psychology, famously terming the Western Suburbs the \\"fibros\\" (a type of asbestos sheeting commonly used in houses in the area) in contrast to their rivals of the period the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles, whom he described as the \\"silvertails\\". This reflected both the socio-economics of the respective Sydney suburbs and the financial situations of the clubs. He created this term after an fiery exhibition match between the two sides in Melbourne when Masters was happy to spread a false rumour that the Sea Eagles had stayed at a luxury resort while Wests had to make do with a two-star hotel. \\"I've been a battler all my life. I can communicate with a team like Wests. I form a close personal relationship with each of my players because I'm one of their kind.\\" Masters said of his time at the club. Masters left Western Suburbs when it emerged that the Magpies' affiliated leagues club at Ashfield would no longer be able to support the incomes of his key \\"fibros\\" players. Masters moved on to St. George Dragons in 1982, reaching the Grand Final in 1985 but losing to Canterbury-Bankstown 7-6. Masters is regarded as one of the finest coaches to have never won a premiership because he was seemingly able to help financially struggling clubs to perform above their ability. He was awarded the Dally M coach of the year in 1985. In September 2004 Masters was named as coach of the Western Suburbs Magpies team of the century. == Journalism == Masters is a columnist at The Sydney Morning Herald, and also appears on the ABC-TV sports panel show Offsiders. He was also a Rugby League Commentator for Channel Seven when the Seven network had the free to air TV rights for Australian Tests from 1990 to 1993. Masters did not support Super League when it emerged in 1995 and is well known for his support for rugby league traditions. He is also respected for his analytical skill, and is highly regarded by current players, a rarity for a member of the media. Masters also covers soccer, boxing and a variety of other sports, famously criticising American jingoism at the opening ceremony of the 2002 Salt Lake City Winter Olympic Games. He is a strong supporter of John O'Neill, the Australian Rugby Union chief executive (and former Football Federation Australia CEO) who led the federation to the 2006 FIFA World Cup. However, Masters has criticised FFA chairman Frank Lowy in a series of articles detailing Australian soccer's financial problems, in spite of the Socceroos' success at the World Cup. He questioned whether Lowy, Australia's second richest man, would repay an Australian Sports Commission loan of over A$3 million, to help develop a national league. In a letter to the Sydney Morning Herald, Lowy questioned Masters' journalistic credibility, saying among other things that Masters was a \\"Rugby League commentator\\". Masters then revealed that his great uncle James \\"Judy\\" Masters was a former captain of the Australian national team.

It is in Swaledale and is part the district of Richmondshire and the civil parish of Muker. The village lies on the B6270 road that runs through Swaledale from east to west and is west of Reeth. The name \\"Thwaite\\" comes from the Old Norse word þveit, meaning 'clearing, meadow or paddock'.'Oxford Dictionary of British Place-Names', A.D. Mills, Oxford University Press. ==History== The village was the home and birthplace of Richard and Cherry Kearton, who were pioneers in wildlife photography at the end of the 19th century. The Kearton name lives on in the Kearton tea rooms and guesthouse in the centre of the village and the Kearton Country Hotel. Local legend has it that the bridge over Thwaite Beck, was washed away during a fierce thunderstorm in the late 19th century. No-one was injured but a pig, that was taken by the waters, managed to climb out of the beck further downstream. A flash flood did hit the village in 1899, which resulted in the destruction of some outbuildings and gardens. Due to the de-population of Thwaite at that time (because of the decline in the mining industry) many of the structures were not repaired. Thwaite has two long distance walking paths running through it: the Coast to Coast and the Pennine Way. There are two parts to the Coast to Coast; one that goes north of Thwaite and across the hills to Reeth and the other goes through the village and across the valley floor. The Herriot Way also runs through the village, which as it passes through Thwaite, is on the same course as the Pennine Way. ==Aircraft crash== On the 28 January 1943, a Handley Page Halifax of No. 1659 Heavy Conversion Unit RAF (HCU), crashed on the eastern side of Great Shunner Fell. All crew were rescued from the aircraft by Sergeant C L Pudney, although 3 later died of their wounds. After rescuing his crew, Sgt Pudney trekked the into Thwaite to raise the alarm. Whilst Sgt Pudney was awarded the George Medal for his heroic actions, he was unable to receive the award as he was killed when the No. 405 RCAF Squadron Halifax he was flying in was struck by lightning and crashed at King's Lynn on the 13 June 1943. ==Thwaite in popular culture== Thwaite has been cited as the setting of Misselthwaite Manor in the book The Secret Garden by Frances Hodgson Burnett. However, in the book Space and Place in Children's Literature it states that the Thwaite in the book bears no relation to Thwaite in North Yorkshire. ==References Category:Villages in North Yorkshire Category:Swaledale ","title":"Thwaite, North Yorkshire"},{"id":"6212265","text":"\\"N.W.O.\\" (New World Order) is a song by American rock band Ministry, released as the opening track and second single from their fifth studio album Psalm 69: The Way to Succeed and the Way to Suck Eggs (1992). An industrial metal song, it was co-written and co-produced by the band’s frontman Al Jourgensen and bassist Paul Barker, and is widely regarded as a protest against then- President George H. W. Bush, featuring samples from his speeches. The song was nominated for a Grammy Award under the Best Metal Performance category in 1993, and was featured in the soundtrack album of Ralph Bakshi’s 1992 film Cool World. In 1994, the song was used in a Spin Magazine commercial which featured Jourgensen, among others. In 2015, \\"N.W.O.\\" was ranked #10 in the VH1 \\"Top 10 Hardest Hitting Heavy Metal Political Anthems\\" list. The promotional single, featuring two mixes of \\"N.W.O.\\" and a non-album instrumental track \\"Fucked\\", has been released around the same time with its parent album, and topped out on the Billboard Modern Rock chart at no. 11. The music video for “N.W.O.” was directed by Peter Christopherson. The majority of the video is a mix of police beatings, riots, and gunfights. It also includes a scene in which a woman dressed as the Statue of Liberty is beaten by police in a manner similar to the famous amateur video of Rodney King being beaten by police. The video was featured on Beavis and Butt-Head along with another track from Psalm 69, \\"Just One Fix\\". The song was featured in the video game Need for Speed: The Run. ==Samples== Samples from Apocalypse Now are included in this track: Dennis Hopper's character exclaiming \\"It's alright!\\" as the patrol boat is approaching the colonel's fort, as well as the siren that was used during the scene. There is also a loop of the guitar solo coming from a transistor radio in the grenade launcher's bunker. Footage from the music video of the Octopus is from the Japanese film Space Amoeba. Footage of the turtle is from the film franchise Gamera. ==Track listingPersonnel== Credits adapted from the liner notes of the “N.W.O.” single, Psalm 69: The Way to Succeed and the Way to Suck Eggs and Greatest Fits. * Al Jourgensen – vocals and guitars on “N.W.O.”, programming, production * Paul Barker – bass guitar on “N.W.O.”, programming, production * Bill Rieflin – drums on “N.W.O.” * Howie Beno – programming, editing * Paul Manno – remix engineer * Paul Elledge – cover design ==ReferencesCategory:1992 singles Category:Ministry (band) songs Category:Protest songs Category:1992 songs Category:Sire Records singles Category:Warner Records singles Category:Songs written by Al Jourgensen Category:Songs written by Paul Barker Category:Song recordings produced by Al Jourgensen ","title":"N.W.O.

Transport around Brisbane is managed by the Queensland Government and the councils of the local government areas which make up the metropolitan area, including the Brisbane City Council, with or without cooperation with external operators such as Airtrain Citylink. Most public transport in Brisbane is co-ordinated by TransLink. Rail services are operated by Queensland Rail, through its City network system. Bus services are operated by both the Brisbane City Council's Brisbane Transport subsidiary and private operators, and uses the road network as well as dedicated bus lanes and busways. Ferry services on the Brisbane River are operated by Transdev Brisbane Ferries. Road transport is via the standard residential street network managed by the Brisbane City Council and the connecting arterial road network which is managed by Department of Transport and Main Roads. The Brisbane Airport Corporation manages Brisbane Airport. ==Cycling== Brisbane is constructing a number of cycle routes and dedicated, off-road bikeways. The South-East Bikeway is a bicycle only bikeway running adjacent to the South East Freeway. It empties onto the Goodwill Bridge at South Bank, which in turn, connects with the Bicentennial Bikeway underneath the Riverside Expressway. The Bicentennial Bikeway continues along the Brisbane River to Toowong. A limited number of buses used to carry cycle racks on the front but this service is no longer available. Bicycles are easy to transport on the CityCats, and many stops have bicycle racks. During peak hour, bicycles on Queensland Rail's (QR) City network services are restricted to counter-peak- flow services (i.e. You have to be travelling away from the city in the morning, and to the city in the afternoon). Exceptions to this are relatively uncommon such as fold up bicycles fitting within certain dimensions. Riding a bicycle on QR property is always forbidden. A bike station in the King George Square busway station offers many amenities including showers and locker rooms for members. Subscriptions for a Velib style community bike hire scheme called citycycle by JCDecaux for Brisbane started on 1 September 2010 with bikes available from 1 October 2010 at 150 stations from the University of Queensland to Teneriffe. Lime scooters were introduced in November 2018 as a trial with a temporary exemption as the scooters can travel at which is faster than the permitted by Queensland legislation. ==Brisbane Riverwalk== Brisbane is notable for its Brisbane Riverwalk network, which runs along much of the Brisbane River foreshore throughout the inner-city area, with the longest span running between Newstead and Toowong. Another popular stretch runs beneath the Kangaroo Point Cliffs between South Brisbane and Kangaroo Point. Several spans of the Riverwalk are built out over the Brisbane River. ==Public transport== Brisbane's public transport system is provided by rail, buses, ferries and taxis. A large tram network closed in 1969. A smaller trolleybus system closed at the same time, with routes on both systems being replaced by buses. TransLink is a division of the Department of Transport and Main Roads that manages the planning, co-ordination, integrated ticketing and zoning for public transport services covering Brisbane and the rest of South East Queensland. It contracts Queensland Rail, private bus operating companies and Brisbane Transport to operate public transport services in allocated operating areas for a negotiated price, and keeps all fare receipts. Passengers pay common fares, based on the number of zones travelled through, on all the public transport modes covered - trains, buses and ferries, irrespective of who operates the service. In 2007, Translink introduced the go card smartcard- based ticketing system. Paper tickets are still available, but travel using the go card costs significantly less than using a paper ticket. Rail services are operated by Queensland Rail. Ferries are operated by Transdev Brisbane Ferries. Contracted buses that serve the regional areas outside and across the Brisbane boundary are operated by private companies. After some years of decline, Brisbane's public transport system is being revitalised and finding greater patronage, with significant investment in railway station upgrades, busways, reorganised bus routes and new buses. However, patronage remains a far cry from public transport's heyday in the 1940s, when the tram system alone carried 160 million passengers annually. By comparison, Brisbane Transport buses carried 53 million passengers in 2005, although Brisbane's population has doubled since the 1940s. This figure climbed to 77 million in 2010. The region is divided into seven fare zones radiating outwards from the Brisbane central business district (CBD), with Brisbane's built-up area falling within zones 1–3. Bus services are operated by public and private operators whereas trains and ferries are operated by public agencies. The CBD is the central hub for all public transport services with services focusing on Roma Street, Central and Fortitude Valley railway stations; King George Square, Queen Street and Roma Street busway stations; and North Quay, Riverside and QUT Gardens Point ferry wharves. Various smaller transfer hubs, such as the Cultural Centre busway station, are located at various strategically placed points of public importance and public interest in the city, including the Queensland Cultural Centre, South Bank Parklands and shopping malls, which are usually within dense population centres. Many busway stations are co-located with (e.g. Roma Street station) or are near to train stations (e.g. Cultural Centre bus station and South Brisbane railway station), facilitating transfers between modes. In December 2005, TransLink began all-night public transport services on Friday and Saturday nights, under the name of NightLink. These bus routes have numbers prefixed with the letter N, and often carry security guards. The Beenleigh, Ipswich and Caboolture rail lines also operate into the early morning hours. ===Rail=== Queensland Rail NGR train at Oxley station The Queensland Rail City network consists of 152 train stations along 13 suburban rail lines and across the metropolitan area, namely: the Airport line; the Beenleigh line; the Caboolture line; the Cleveland line; the Doomben line; the Exhibition line; the Ferny Grove line; the Ipswich/Rosewood line; the Redcliffe Peninsula line; the Shorncliffe line; and the Springfield line. The network extends to the Gold and Sunshine coasts, which are fully integrated into the network on the Gold Coast line and Sunshine Coast line. The Airtrain service which runs on the Airport line is jointly operated between the City of Brisbane and Brisbane Airport. 55 million passenger trips were taken across the network in 2018–19. Construction of the network began in 1865 and has been progressively expanded in the subsequent centuries. Electrification of the network was completed between 1979 and 1988. The Cross River Rail project includes a twin rail tunnel ( long) which will pass under the Brisbane River to link two new railway stations at Albert Street in the CBD and Wooloongabba is under construction and scheduled to be completed in 2024. ===Buses=== Main bus services in inner-city Brisbane Brisbane has a large dedicated bus rapid transit network, the Brisbane busway network. The network comprises the South East Busway, the Northern Busway and the Eastern Busway. The main network hubs are the King George Square, Queen Street, and Roma Street busway stations. Brisbane City Council operates Most of its suburban and urban bus services under the TransLink integrated public transport scheme. TransLink is responsible for all timetabling and ticketing on Brisbane City Council (Brisbane Transport) buses, which Brisbane Transport constructs, leases back (a sell and leaseback scheme operating between the Council and State) and operates. Outer suburb bus service providers include: Bribie Island Coaches,Route Info Bribie Island Coaches Brisbane Bus Lines, Caboolture Bus Lines,Caboolture Bus Lines TransLink Hornibrook Bus Lines,Routes Hornibrook Bus Lines Kangaroo Bus Lines,Public Transport Kangaroo Bus Lines Logan City Bus Service, Mt Gravatt Bus Service,Public Transport Mt Gravatt Bus Service Park Ridge Transit,Urban Bus Queensland Thompson Bus Services,Urban Runs Thompson Bus Services Transdev QueenslandUrban Services & Night Link Transdev Brisbane and Westside Bus Company. Buses at an interchange Buses generally operate on a 05:00 to midnight timetable throughout the week, with some Friday and Saturday night 24-hour services. This puts the bus network out of the reach of early morning shift workers. In addition to the local bus routes, most routes in Brisbane are express (CityXpress) and don't observe minor stops. Buses on some routes, prefixed with a P, accept no cash, only pre-purchased tickets or go cards. BUZ (Bus Upgrade Zones) are high- frequency express routes, pioneered by Brisbane City Council, that provide services on main corridors at least every 15 minutes on any day of the week from 6am to 11pm.BUZ services . Brisbane City Council. Retrieved on 3 June 2011. During peak hours, 'Rocket' buses bypass most intermediate stops, while 'Bullets' (such as the Browns Plains 142) don't stop between the CBD and their final destinations. The CityGlider is a high-frequency route operating between Newstead and West End via the CBD. The Maroon [City]Glider operates between Ashgrove and Stones Corner via South Bank. Other CityGlider routes are planned. CityGlider services require prepaid tickets (i.e. go cards). They use branded buses stopping only at specified CityGlider stops, and run every 5 minutes in peak hours and every 10 to 15 minutes outside peak hours.CityGlider services . Brisbane City Council. Retrieved on 3 June 2011. The 'Great Circle Line' bus routes operate on a large anti-clockwise (route 598) and clockwise (route 599) loop around Brisbane's outer suburbs. They are used for travel between suburbs, particularly the larger shopping centres, without the need to travel through the CBD. Buses often provide free transport between major shopping centres (for example Westfield Carindale), and the Gabba or Lang Park for sporting match events. The free City Loop and Spring Hill Loop bus services provide high-frequency public transport access within the Brisbane CBD, and between the Brisbane CBD and Spring Hill. The City Loop operates clockwise and anti-clockwise in the Brisbane CBD from designated red-sign bus stops, using distinctive red buses. The Spring Hill Loop operates on a continuous loop between the CBD and Spring Hill, stopping at yellow-sign bus stops, using distinctive yellow buses. The 'Brisbane Explorer' (superseding the 'City Sights' services) was a non-TransLink prepaid hop-on, hop-off service that visits Brisbane's landmarks, including Mt Coot-tha, on a two-hour journey. Services suspended in 2017. During the Christmas period, a special 'Christmas Lights' service operates (tickets must be pre-purchased), often with buses decked inside with Christmas decorations. A new bus rapid transit system, branded the 'Brisbane Metro' was announced in 2016 by the Brisbane City Council. The proposed 21 kilometre metro will service the Brisbane CBD every 3-minutes during peaks times and would be capable to transport 22,000 passengers an hour. Subjects to approvals, the Brisbane City Council expects the detailed design and construction of the project to commence in 2019 with metro services commencing by 2023. ===Ferries=== CityFerry CityCat catamaran ferry Transdev Brisbane Ferries operates three ferry services along the Brisbane River, CityCat, CityFerry and CityHopper. Brisbane's ferries, and particularly its catamaran CityCats, are considered iconic to the city. The CityCat high-speed catamaran ferry service, popular with tourists and commuters, operates services along the Brisbane River between the University of Queensland and Northshore Hamilton, with wharves at UQ St Lucia, West End, Guyatt Park, Regatta, Milton, North Quay, South Bank, QUT Gardens Point, Riverside, Sydney Street, Mowbray Park, New Farm Park, Hawthorne, Bulimba, Teneriffe, Bretts Wharf, Apollo Road and Northshore Hamilton. The CityFerry service operates smaller vessels for popular cross-river routes, namely: Bulimba–Teneriffe, New Farm Park–Norman Park, and Holman Street–Eagle Street Pier–Thornton Street. The free CityHopper service operates smaller vessels along a route between North Quay and Sydney Street, stopping at South Bank, Maritime Museum, Thornton Street, Eagle Street Pier, Holman Street and Dockside. ===Taxis=== Three cab companies operate in Brisbane: Yellow Cabs (whose vehicles are painted orange), Black and White Cabs and 13Cabs (2018). All three companies offer services under the same fare system (regulated by the Queensland government). They may pick up passengers from anywhere in the metropolitan and regional areas of Brisbane via casual or permanent bookings cab ranks. As well as standard taxis, both provide Maxi-Taxis designed to accommodate up to 10 people and with disability access. They also operate luxury vehicles (Silver Service for Yellow, Business Class for Black and White). All cabs now are also fitted with GPS tracking systems for driver location and have debit/credit card EFTPOS facilities. ===Public Transport Statistics=== According to data released by Moovit in July 2017, the average amount of time people spend commuting with public transport in Brisbane & South East QLD, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 68 min. 22.6 percent of public transport riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transport is 13 min, while 18.7 percent of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transport is 9 km, while 20 percent travel for over 12 km in a single direction. 50px Material was copied from this source, which is available under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License . ==Roads== Brisbane's road system was planned around large, spacious suburban areas. Dense suburbs now rely on several main road corridors that split through and between these areas and provide the only link to the CBD and other areas of Brisbane. Logan Road, Moggill Road, Old Cleveland Road and Gympie Road are but a few of these multi-lane corridors that come out of the CBD and snake through the suburbs. As a result, traffic congestion has become a major problem and it was the promise of a new underground road system, nicknamed TransApex, that helped former Lord Mayor Campbell Newman win the 2004 local government election. Moggill Road, Taringa Bypasses such as the Inner City Bypass, Clem Jones Tunnel, and the Airport Link are intended to help to circulate traffic away from the inner-city areas and main roads via limited-access roads above the ground, and tunnels below that have higher speed limits and exits to particular suburbs. Existing high speed cross-suburban motorways such as the Western Freeway, Centenary Motorway, Pacific Motorway and Gateway Motorway provide alternative routes to main roads and connect up to main highways and other arterial roads. Other tunnels are also being planned to link all the various motorways in Brisbane together as part of TransApex, but only two have been scheduled for completion within the next decade. Route signage is achieved by means of a system of Metroads, consisting of the most important arterial roads in metropolitan Brisbane including most motorways, and less important State Routes. Multiple freeways connect Brisbane to other cities, including the Pacific Motorway, the Bruce Highway and the Ipswich Motorway, all of which are part of the National Highway System. Brisbane is approximately 1,000 km away from Sydney, the closest major capital city. ===Bridges=== The Eleanor Schonell Bridge, a pesdestrian and bus bridge between Dutton Park and the University of Queensland's St Lucia campus The Brisbane River creates a barrier to road transport routes. In total there are sixteen bridges over the river, mostly concentrated in the inner city area. The road bridges (which usually also include provision for pedestrians and cyclists) by distance from the river mouth are the Sir Leo Hielscher Bridges, the Story Bridge, the Captain Cook Bridge, the Victoria Bridge, the William Jolly Bridge, the Go Between Bridge, the Eleanor Schonell Bridge, the Walter Taylor Bridge the Centenary Bridge and Colleges Crossing. There are three railway bridges, namely the Merivale Bridge, the Albert Bridge and the Indooroopilly Railway Bridge. There are also three pedestrian only bridges: the Goodwill Bridge, the Kurilpa Bridge and the Jack Pesch Bridge. The three Houghton Highway bridges, over Bramble Bay between Brighton and the Redcliffe Peninsula, are the longest bridges in the state. ==Airports== Etihad Airways Boeing 777 at the International Terminal at Brisbane Airport Brisbane Airport, leased by the Brisbane Airport Corporation and located north-east of the city centre, is the biggest airport in Australia in terms of land size. Brisbane Airport is the third busiest airport in the country behind Sydney and Melbourne Airports respectively. Separated into domestic and international terminals, Brisbane Airport has frequent passenger and freight flights, providing direct flights to every capital city in Australia as well as many destinations in Asia, Oceania, and the Middle East. Virgin Australia, the second largest airline in Australia, is headquartered in Brisbane, while other major airlines Qantas and Jetstar Airways both fly from Brisbane Airport. The Airport railway line provides a link between the Domestic and International Terminals at Brisbane Airport and the city, taking approximately 20 minutes to travel from Central station to the Airport stations. Archerfield Airport, located in Brisbane's southern suburbs, caters to general aviation. Other local airports can be found at Caboolture and Redcliffe. ==Seaports== Brisbane's seaport, Port of Brisbane on Fisherman's Island, and Brisbane Airport from space, Landsat montage The Port of Brisbane is on the lower reaches of the Brisbane River and on Fisherman's Island at the river's mouth; it is the third most important port in Australia for value of goods.Australian Sea Freight Australian Department of Transport and Regional Services Container freight, sugar, grain, coal and bulk liquids are the major exports. Most of the port facilities are less than three decades old, and some are built on reclaimed mangroves and wetlands. Historically, Brisbane's port facilities were located as far upstream as the central business district. The economic region near the river's mouth including the port, airport and refineries is known as the Australia TradeCoast. ==Historic== Historically Brisbane had a network of trolleybuses and trams, both of which were closed in 1969 in favour of an expanded bus fleet. The Brisbane Tramways Trust experimented with providing bus services in the 1920s but these proved impractical due to mechanical unreliability and Brisbane's poor road surface quality. The first permanent bus services were introduced in 1940 as a supplement to Brisbane's tram services. In 1948 the council municipalised a number of privately run bus operators and expanded its own fleet of buses. The first tram lines to close were the Lower Edward Street to Gardens route, and the Upper Edward Street to Gregory Terrace route in 1947, the latter due to the very steep grades on that line. Diesel-engined buses initially replaced tram services on these lines, however these were replaced by trolleybuses on 12 August 1951. The council also intended to introduce a trolleybus service to the new University of Queensland campus at St Lucia and purchased enough trolleybus chassis from the United Kingdom for the route. However, it was vigorously opposed by residents and the plan was abandoned. The council then found itself with surplus trolleybuses but no route on which to run them, so it decided to run the trolleybuses from Herston to Stanley Bridge, East Brisbane, commencing in 1952. Several other trolleybus routes were subsequently established in the eastern suburbs. The first of these replaced a tram route, along Cavendish Road, in 1955. Other trolleybus routes to Seven Hills and Carina did not involve tram route closures. The depot and workshops for the trolleybuses was located in Milton on Milton Road between Hale and Castlemaine Streets. The former depot was demolished to make way for the redeveloped Lang Park. The tramway closure was notable for the speed with which it was carried out. Several hundred replacement buses were purchased from British vehicle manufacturer Leyland, at the time the largest single bus purchase in the world. The sudden acquisition of so many buses was to have repercussions in later years. Initially the Leyland Panther buses proved unreliable, and as a result, older front-engined mounted buses such as the Leyland Mk III Regals, dating from the 1940s, were retained well past their normal replacement date. Once the problems with the Panthers were ironed out, overall fleet numbers and maintenance requirements were reduced. Nevertheless, the fleet retained many older buses from the 1950s and early 1960s. In 1975, the Whitlam Labor federal government made $80 million available to the Bjelke- Petersen National Party Queensland state government, intended to be passed on to Brisbane City Council for the purchase of new, replacement buses. The government refused to transfer the funds to the council, instead using the money to restore Parliament House and construct the Parliamentary Annexe building. As the replacement bus fleet aged, their maintenance requirements steadily increased, at a time when labour and spare parts costs had risen sharply. Further, as the tram replacement buses started to wear out at about the same time and needed replacement, the council was faced with another large capital outlay. Subsequently, in 1976, the council was able to negotiate federal funding, enabling them to purchase Volvo B59 buses, its first fleet acquisitions in seven years. Patronage on the buses continued to decline, despite the best efforts of the Department of Transport hampered by rising fuel and labour costs, together with tightening budgets, leading to further cuts in services. An ageing bus fleet, some of which had been in service since the 1940s, made the service increasingly unattractive. A further hindrance was the council's own aggressively pro-car 1964 City Plan, requiring all developments to include car parking, but did not require the provision of any facilities that might advantage public transport. By the 1980s, the decline in patronage was halted, although costs continued to outstrip ticket revenue. ==Future infrastructure== Brisbane's population growth has seen great strains placed upon South East Queensland's transport system. The State Government and Brisbane City Council have responded with infrastructure plans and increased funding for transportation projects, such as the South East Queensland Infrastructure Plan and Program. Most of the focus has been placed on expanding current road infrastructure, particularly tunnels and bypasses, as well as improving the public transport system. These include the creation of a new public transport mode, the Brisbane Metro. ==See also== * Bus transport in Queensland * Transportation in Australia ==References Category:Transport in Queensland Category:Economy of Brisbane ","title":"Transport in Brisbane"},{"id":"6212288","text":"Hartest is a small village and civil parish in the Babergh district of the English county of Suffolk. It is located halfway between Bury St. Edmunds and Sudbury on the B1066 road in the Glem valley. Brockley is two miles north. The village of Hartest dates back to before 1086 and features in the Domesday Book. The name 'Hartest' is thought to mean either 'Stag Hill' or 'Stag Wood'. It is claimed that there are no other villages, towns or cities in the world of the same name. The village is centred on the large village green, fringed by an array of brightly coloured cottages, the village hall or institute, the medieval All Saints church and the Crown public house, formerly Hartest Hall the local landowner's seat. There is an annual fete held on the village green at the end of August each year. Running east of the village centre is Hartest Hill, the steepest in Suffolk. Former Special Envoy for the Archbishop of Canterbury and Islamic Jihad Organization hostage, Terry Waite lives in the village. ==Local Features and Landmarks== On the north side of the village green stands a large boulder named the 'Hartest Stone'. This boulder, thought to have been placed on that spot in the early 18th century, has attracted speculation over its origins. One theory is that the boulder was moved by sled from the nearby Somerton Hill to celebrate the Peace of Utrecht and the Duke of Marlborough's victories in the War of the Spanish Succession. Another theory suggests the boulder was moved (for the same reasons) from Somerton Common. A third theory suggests the boulder was found in a clay pit owned by one Mr Carter, who had the stone moved to its current location. Local traditions say that the boulder will turn over at the stroke of midnight and sitting on the boulder at midnight will bring a wife or good fortune. Hartest Wood stands on the outskirts of Hartest. The wood was planted in 1999 as part of the Woodland Trust's 'Woods on your doorstep' scheme to commemorate the new millennium. The wood contains 187 oak trees, representing every household in Hartest at the time. At the centre of the woods an art installation designed by Geoffrey Clarke called 'The Gift' can be found. The village pub, The Crown (previously 'the Crown Inn') stands on the South side of the green. The Crown is a sixteenth century Grade II Listed building and was previously used as a Moot Hall for the village and surrounding area. ==References *Parish Council website Category:Villages in Suffolk Category:Babergh Category:Civil parishes in Suffolk ","title":"Hartest"},{"id":"6212289","text":"Downer is the New Jersey state soil.
