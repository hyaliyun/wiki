The screenplay by Bernard Slade is based on his 1975 play of the same title. The film stars Alan Alda and Ellen Burstyn. ==Plot synopsis== In 1951, at an inn on the Mendocino County coast, Doris (Ellen Burstyn), a 24-year-old housewife from Oakland, meets George (Alan Alda), a 27-year-old accountant from New Jersey at dinner. They have a sexual tryst, then agree to meet once a year to rekindle the sparks they experienced at their first meeting, despite the fact that both are happily married with six children between them. They discuss their spouses, Harry and Helen. Over the course of the next 26 years, they develop an emotional intimacy deeper than what one would expect to find between two people meeting for a clandestine relationship just once a year. During the time they spend with each other, they discuss births, deaths -including George's son Michael dying in Vietnam, which changes George politically - and the marital problems each experiences at home, while they adapt themselves to the social changes affecting their lives. At their meeting in 1977, George tells Doris that his wife, Helen, died of cancer earlier in the year, and that Helen revealed to a friend that she had known of the affair for ten years, but never told George she knew. Now a widower, George proposes to Doris who refuses to accept because of her loyalty to, and respect for, Harry. Rejected, George leaves for good‚Äîbut he returns, and they promise to continue the affair as long as they are able. ==Production== The movie is structured as six episodes, each occurring approximately five years apart. Between the scenes are shown a series of photos that depict cultural and political events that had ensued in the years between each segment, such as Harry S. Truman, Nikita Khrushchev, Lucille Ball, Elvis Presley, and John F. Kennedy. The episodes are period-specific, often making references to what was actually happening during the time portrayed. For example, in the segment set in 1966, Doris is caught up in the protest movement at Berkeley, while George takes a Librium and reveals that he'd voted for Barry Goldwater, and later that his son had been killed in Vietnam. Exteriors for the film were shot at the Heritage House Inn, a well-known resort and bed & breakfast in Little River, California, seven miles south of Mendocino, California. The shell of the cottage was built on a temporary foundation overlooking the Pacific Ocean, but the interior was filmed on the Universal Studios sound stage in Los Angeles. After filming was completed, Universal paid for the shell to be relocated to a permanent foundation and the interior was outfitted with the studio furnishings. The cottage became a popular romantic getaway, so popular in fact that the Heritage House eventually partitioned the cottage in half and added a second bathroom to the opposite end. One half of the cottage was called \\"Same Time\\" and the other half called \\"Next Year\\". The Heritage House closed due to foreclosure in December 2008.Heritage House closing, up for auction The \\"Same Time, Next Year\\" cottage still stands, updated and remodeled, and the Heritage House reopened in the Summer of 2013. ==Theme song== Paul McCartney had composed a title song for the film, which he recorded with Wings, that was not used. He later released it as the B-side of a single in 1990. The theme song ultimately used was \\"The Last Time I Felt Like This,\\" written by Marvin Hamlisch and Alan and Marilyn Bergman and performed by Johnny Mathis and Jane Olivor. ==Critical reception== While Bernard Slade's acclaimed stage play earned a storm of praise, the movie received mixed reviews. Janet Maslin of the New York Times wrote \\"Mr. Slade's screenplay isn't often funny, and it's full of momentous events that can't be laughed away...As directed by Robert Mulligan...Same Time, Next Year is both less and more than it could have been. By moving the action outdoors once in a while, or into the inn's restaurant, Mr. Mulligan loses the element of claustrophobia that might have taken an audience's mind off the screenplay's troubles. But he substitutes the serenity of a California coastal setting, and gives the film a visual glamour that is mercifully distracting. Mr. Mulligan seems to have been more interested in sprucing up the material than in preserving its absolute integrity, and under the circumstances, his approach makes sense... Mr. Alda isn't terribly playful, and he reads every line as if it were part of a joke, which only accentuates the flatness of the script. Miss Burstyn, on the other hand...brings so much sweetness to Doris's various incarnations that the character very nearly comes to life.\\"New York Times review Variety called the film \\"a textbook example of how to successfully transport a stage play to the big screen\\" and added \\"The production of Bernard Slade's play, sensitively directed by Robert Mulligan, is everything you'd want from this kind of film. And it features two first class performances by Ellen Burstyn and Alan Alda.\\"Variety review ==Awards and honors== *Academy Award for Best Actress (Ellen Burstyn, nominee) *Academy Award for Best Cinematography (Robert Surtees, nominee) *Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay (Bernard Slade, nominee) *Academy Award for Best Original Song (\\"The Last Time I Felt Like This,\\" nominee) *Golden Globe Award for Best Actress ‚Äì Motion Picture Musical or Comedy (Burstyn, winner) *Golden Globe Award for Best Actor ‚Äì Motion Picture Musical or Comedy (Alan Alda, nominee) *Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song (nominee) *Writers Guild of America Award for Best Adapted Screenplay (Slade, nominee) The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists: * 2002: AFI's 100 Years...100 Passions ‚Äì Nominated ==See also== *One Day (2011 film) Film with similar plot. ==ReferencesCategory:1978 films Category:American romantic comedy-drama films Category:American films Category:1970s romantic comedy-drama films Category:Films scored by Marvin Hamlisch Category:American films based on plays Category:Films directed by Robert Mulligan Category:Films featuring a Best Musical or Comedy Actress Golden Globe winning performance Category:Films produced by Walter Mirisch Category:Films set in California Category:Films set in hotels Category:Two-handers Category:Universal Pictures films Category:Adultery in films Category:Films set in 1951 Category:Films set in 1956 Category:Films set in 1961 Category:Films set in 1966 Category:Films set in 1972 Category:Films set in 1977 Category:1978 comedy films Category:1978 drama films ","title":"Same Time, Next Year (film)"},{"id":"20152788","text":"Harry Samuel Broudy (July 27, 1905 ‚Äì June 24, 1998) was a Polish-born American professor of the philosophy of education. ==Early life and education== Broudy was born in Filip√≥w, Grodno Governorate (part of the Russian partition of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth) in the Russian Empire on July 27, 1905, but his family emigrated, and moved to Milford, Massachusetts in 1912. Broudy attended the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for a year, but then transferred to Boston University, where he received his Bachelor's degree in German literature and philosophy in 1929. From there, he went to Harvard University and earned his Masters degree and Ph.D. there (both in philosophy), completing the doctorate in 1935. His thesis title was The Metaphysical Presuppositions of Personal Existence. == Career == Broudy worked for a short time at the Massachusetts Department of Education, where he supervised correspondence education. He taught philosophy of education and educational psychology at North Adams State Teachers College from 1937 until 1949, then moved to Framingham State Teachers College from 1949 until 1957. He moved to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign as a professor of the philosophy of education in 1957, where he spent the rest of his career at Illinois. He retired from the full time appointment in 1974 and was appointed as a professor emeritus, in which role he stayed active until the early 1990s. ==Work== Broudy's philosophical views were based on the tradition of classical realism, dealing with truth, goodness, and beauty. However he was also influenced by the modern philosophies existentialism and instrumentalism. In his textbook Building a Philosophy of Education he has two major ideas that are the main points to his philosophical outlook: The first is truth and the second is universal structures to be found in humanity's struggle for education and the good life. Broudy also studied issues on society's demands on school. He thought education would be a link to unify the diverse society and urged the society to put more trust and a commitment to the schools and a good education. ==Awards and honors== Broudy was appointed as a laureate of Kappa Delta Pi in 1968. Volume 25, issue 4 of the Journal of Aesthetic Education was dedicated to essays in honor of Broudy. == Personal life == Broudy was naturalized as a United States citizen in 1936.

Trained by the father and son team of Ben and Jimmy Jones, Mark-Ye-Well was ridden by Eddie Arcaro in most of his major races. ==Racing career== At age two, the colt was taken out of training as a result of a stifle joint problem and did not return to racing until February 1952. Brought back slowly, the then three-year-old colt did not compete in any of the 1952 U.S. Triple Crown races, but by mid-year he had developed into one of the top runners in his age group in the United States.

She spent her most productive years in Iowa. Her father, Prof. N.R. Smith, was a playwright and an authority on Shakespeare. She was married to New York City poet and editor Oliver I. Taylor. Harrington was the anonymous author of Emma Bartlett, or Prejudice and Fanaticism, a fictional reply to Uncle Tom‚Äôs Cabin, intended to expose the hypocrisy of Know-Nothingism. Harrington‚Äôs family moved to Ohio, then Kentucky, where Harrington worked as a teacher. Later, she taught in Chicago. Harrington lived in various Iowa cities, including Farmington, Keosauqua, Burlington, Ft. Madison and Keokuk. She began her writing career with the Louisville Journal, whose editor opposed secession and was an important influence in keeping Kentucky in the Union. In her Letters from a Prairie Cottage, Harrington included a children's corner with tales about taming and raising animals and of a cat who adopted orphan chicks. Harrington also wrote other children‚Äôs books, including a primer and a speller. Pollard's work in the field of reading represented a pioneer effort in terms of creating a sequential reading program of intensive synthetic phonics, complete with a separate teacher's manual and spelling and reading books, and moving into a broad based graded series of literature readers. Her series is important for its high correlation of spelling and reading instruction, for its concern for the interests of children, for its incorporation of music into the process of learning to read, and as the forerunner for other phonics systems. Her readers were used in every state in the Union and were still in use in Keokuk, Iowa, as late as 1937. Few women have single-handedly contributed so much to the field of reading. In 1869, she published a book of poems entitled Maymie, as a tribute to her ten-year-old daughter who died that year. Emma Bartlett received mixed reviews when it was published in 1856. The Ohio Statesman gave her a very good review but the Cincinnati Times said, \\"We have read this book. We pronounce the plot an excellent one and the style charming, but she has failed to fulfill the intended mission of the book.\\" It accused her of also showing prejudice and fanaticism typical of the politicians that she tried to defend. In 1870, Harrington published \\"In Memoriam, Maymie, April 6th, 1869\\", a meditation on death and suffering, written on the occasion of the death of Harrington's young daughter. In 1876, Harrington published ‚ÄúCentennial, and Other Poems,‚Äù to commemorate the one hundredth anniversary of the Declaration of Independence, and the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia, the first official World's Fair to be held in the United States. The volume included many poems about Iowa, as well as selected poems of Harrington's father, Prof. N.R. Smith, and illustrations of the Centennial grounds in Philadelphia. Kate Harrington, or Rebecca Harrington Smith Pollard wrote all of her life. She was 79 years old when she produced the poem, ‚ÄúAlthea‚Äù or ‚ÄúMorning Glory,‚Äù which relates to Iowa. She died in Ft. Madison on May 29, 1917. ==Bibliography== * ==References== Category:American women poets Category:American children's writers Category:1831 births Category:1917 deaths Category:Writers from Iowa Category:American educators Category:Reading skill advocates Category:American women children's writers ","title":"Kate Harrington (poet)"},{"id":"20152798","text":"Swallowing Darkness (2008) is the seventh novel in the Merry Gentry series written by Laurell K.

Working chiefly in Siena, he was first recognized to be working as an artist in 1453 and continued his work nearly until his death in approximately 1518. During his lifetime, he was influenced by many various artists and in the 1480s, Benvenuto's style changed drastically.Cot√©, Cynthia. \\"Benvenuto di Giovanni.\\" Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press, accessed 21 February 2017, http://www.oxfordartonline.com/subscriber/article/grove/art/T008000. Though Benvenuto did explore into other fields of work, painting was consistently a part of his life. His son, Girolamo di Giovanni, followed in his footsteps and also became a painter. In fact, there have often been instances in which the work of one the two has been confused for that of the other.Thomas N. Maytham. \\"An Expulsion from Paradise by Benvenuto Di Giovanni.\\" Bulletin of the Museum of Fine Arts 55, no. 300 (1957): 44-46. https://www.jstor.org/stable/4171262. Nevertheless, Benvenuto left behind significantly more works. Some of his works were both signed and dated, some were only signed, and some were only dated. However, regardless of debate over date or authorship, Benvenuto left behind a significant number of works, both ones that are quite well known as well as others that are more minor in their distinction. His pieces that are signed, dated, and still existing have dates spanning a period of 43 years. In addition to the works that he left behind, he also left behind a legacy through the artists that he influenced during his lifetime. The Washington predella group: Agony in the Garden, The Way to Calvary, Crucifixion, Resurrection, and Descent into Limbo). == Life and influences == Annunciation, 1470 Born to a bricklayer in Siena, Benvenuto remained there for his entire life, only occasionally venturing to nearby cities for his work. The first records of him as an artist are of his contributions to the Siena Baptistery in 1453. His work here was likely in collaboration with il Vecchietta, as it is believed that Benvenuto was trained in his workshop. Outside of Vecchietta, Benvenuto was also likely to have worked under Sano di Pietro because they share a number of similarities stylistically. Benvenuto was commissioned to do a number of works in the Siena Cathedral during his life that included choral miniatures, pavement designs, and frescoes. However, he was not the only artist requested to work in the cathedral; artists and painters such as Matteo di Giovanni, Francesco di Giorgio Martini, and Neroccio di Bartolomeo de' Landi were also commissioned, or hired, for nearly the same jobs. This commonality led to Benvenuto and the other artists having a significant amount of influence upon one another's style. Other painters that had works in the Siena Cathedral were Liberale da Verona and Girolamo da Cremona. What sets these artists apart is that it is believed that their pieces in the cathedral were what led to Benvenuto's great shift in style in the 1480s. In 1482, he was commissioned to paint Donation of the Keys to St. Peter in the Antiphonary of the Birth of St. John. It was at this time that he saw Liberale and Girolamo's recent works in the cathedral that incorporated bright colors and manipulated light. As a result of this, he began to do the same in his paintings. Additionally, not only did his style shift in this way, but he also began to experiment with the concept of spatial distortion that was common in paintings by Vecchietta and Donatello. He used a very naturalistic style for his figures, but paired them with a brightly colored and sharply lit background. The combination of his efforts to depict realistic figures, to strategically utilize colors, and to manipulate space in order to give his paintings depth led to a style that was both distinct and uniquely his. These shifts in his style can be seen in paintings such as Maest√† and Ascension. Outside of painting, Benvenuto also explored other personal endeavors. In 1466, he married Jacopa di Tommaso de Cetona. After their marriage, he served at least two terms in a public office. Together, they owned a vineyard and also had seven children. The only child that much is known about is Girolamo, as he was Benvenuto's only follower. However, Girolamo is regarded as both less gifted and less influential, largely because he only survived his father by six years.\\"GIROLAMO DI BENVENUTO DI GIOVANNI DEL GUASTA.\\" Benezit Dictionary of Artists. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press, accessed 28 February 2017, http://www.oxfordartonline.com/subscriber/article/benezit/B00075004. Expulsion from Paradise, 1470s == Major works  Annunciation === It is known that Benvenuto painted at least two versions of the Annunciation. His first Annunciation is the earliest known painting by him, dated in 1466. Despite this being his first work, there was little evidence of the influence of his teacher, Vecchietta. Rather, this work was very clearly inspired by Simone Martini's 1333 painting of the same name. Many other Annunciation works by other artists during Benvenuto's lifetime prioritized landscapes and backgrounds, but Benvenuto employed a more simple, gold background that was typical in works of the early Trecento. Benvenuto's 1466 version resides in the church of St. Girolamo in Volterra. Benvenuto's growth as an artist is evident through comparison of his 1466 Annunciation with his 1470 version. In 1466, Benvenuto opted for a more subtle coloration in his work. However, in 1470, while many of his contemporaries still utilized softer palettes, Benvenuto chose to paint with rich, deep colors that pleased the viewer's eye. This shift in style is likely to have been inspired by two artists that were quite famous during the latter part of the Quattrocento, Girolamo da Cremona and Liberale da Verona. Additionally, Benvenuto traded in his previous flat gold background for one of detailed scenery, including lush gardens, mountains, and lakes. === Expulsion from Paradise === This painting, done by many artists, depicts Adam and Eve being cast out of the Garden of Eden by the archangel, Jophiel. However, Benvenuto's version stands out from the others because his depiction of Eden is far more realistic than that of other artists. He paints Eden as a lush green forest rather than a land full of a myriad of plants and animals. He expertly constructs the figures in a way that makes the subjects come alive through the intermingling of their arms and angling of their bodies. Most likely painted between 1480 and 1500, this exhibits Benvenuto's later style that combines realistic backgrounds and dramatic subjects. At this time, nothing is known of this painting's provenance, or ownership, before 1921, when it became a part of the Engel-Gros Collection. In fact, even the validity of who may be the artist of this painting underwent speculation. Expulsion from Paradise is unsigned and was originally attributed to Benvenuto's son, Girolamo. The credit continued to be given to his son for quite a while, until it was also given to Cosimo Tura, and then finally to Benvenuto, which was settled upon by art historians.Thomas N. Maytham. \\"An Expulsion from Paradise by Benvenuto Di Giovanni.\\" Bulletin of the Museum of Fine Arts 55, no. 300 (1957): 44-46. https://www.jstor.org/stable/4171262. Despite the credit eventually being given to Benvenuto, it is likely that this confusion arose in the first place due to their probable collaboration on the piece. Towards the end of his life, Benvenuto regularly worked with his son, which this piece seems to exhibit. The design itself appears to be Benvenuto's, but certain aspects point towards the assistance of his son. The details of the figures' faces, as well as their shaping, is in a style that is typical of Girolamo. == Minor works  The Adoration of the Magi === 231x231px This theme is one that has been depicted in Italian paintings since the Middle Ages, but it became particularly popular with Sienese painters after Bartolo di Fredi created his triptych to decorate the altar of the Three Kings in the Siena Cathedral. After this creation, Bartolo's influence began to be seen in nearly every Sienese painting of the same theme, including Benvenuto's. However, the influence of other artists is evident as well. It is believed that Benvenuto's version was inspired by Gentile da Fabriano's 1423 version that was commissioned by the Church of Santa Trinit√†. Benvenuto's work now resides in the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., but is currently not on exhibit. The date of the painting is unknown, with estimates ranging from 1460 to 1490. The difficulty in deciphering the date largely comes from the wear on the work, with most of the original painting being now covered by retouches. Nevertheless, when compared to Bevenuto's dated pieces, many art historians are convinced that it was completed between 1470 and 1475. This conclusion is a result of the perspective of the painting, or the way in which the flat painting is made to seem three-dimensional. Much like his 1470 Annunciation, the apparent vanishing point of the painting is lower than the horizon of the background would suggest. === Madonna and Child with Saint Jerome and Saint Bernardino of Siena === 251x251px Unlike many of Benvenuto's works, this one in particular has consistently been attributed to him without any confusion. Nevertheless, its date is still unclear. In most paintings of this theme, Madonna's child is held in her arms, but Benvenuto depicts him seated in front of her. The child is holding a pomegranate that is representative of both the Church and the blood of Christ. The choice to not place the child in Madonna's arms as well as the inclusion of the pomegranate are both artistic decisions that don't appear in Italian paintings until significantly after 1470, thus, the painting's date has been approximated as c. 1480/1485. Much of the confusion with the date of this painting revolves around the fact that it doesn't quite fall into either Benvenuto's early, flat and crisp, style or his later, brightly colored and more detailed, style. It is far simpler than nearly all of his paintings, likely due to his patron's request. Recently, the first expressions of doubt of his attribution have surfaced due to this stark contrast. Nevertheless, attribution still lies in Benvenuto's hands. === The Crucifixion === 200x200px Framed alongside four other of his works (Agony in the Garden, The Way to Calvary, The Resurrection, and The Descent into Limbo), this predella set of paintings details the struggles of Christ. It is believed that these paintings were created in or around 1491 due to the similarities in the landscapes of The Crucifixion and Benvenuto's 1491 Ascension. In The Crucifixion, various prominent biblical figures within this story can be seen in Benvenuto's portrayal of the event. Longinus is depicted on horseback slightly behind Christ, holding the spear that he had pierced Christ with earlier. In the bottom left corner of the painting is the Virgin, Saint John, Mary, the mother of James, the Magdalene, and the three holy women. The Virgin is the figure that is fainting and the others are the ones surrounding and supporting her. Painting the Virgin Mary fainting is an artistic choice that was very common in fourteenth-century Sienese representations of this event. However, what was not common, was Benvenuto's choice to include the children on the hill in the upper left corner. They are, from a distance, pointing towards and spectating the cruelty that is occurring in the center of the painting. This inclusion had never been made before, thus, it exemplified Benvenuto's creativity and inventiveness. == Extant signed and dated paintings == Benvenuto has 11 signed and dated paintings that are still surviving. Their dates of creation span 43 years. {  !Name of Painting !Year of Creation !Current Location - Annunciation 1466 Church of San Girolamo (Volterra) - Nativity 1470 Duomo (Volterra) - Annunciation 1470 Church of San Bernardino (Sinalunga) - Madonna triptych 1475 Church of San Michele Arcangelo (Montepertuso) - Madonna & 2 saints 1479 National Gallery (London) - Madonna of Mercy 1481 Monte dei Paschi (Siena) - Madonna & 4 Saints 1483 Church of San Domenico (Siena) - Ascension 1491 Church of San Eugenio (Siena) - Madonna & 2 Saints 1497 Church of Santa Flora e Lucilla (Torrita) - Ascension 1498 Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York) - Madonna & 2 Saints 1509 Church of Santa Lucia (Sinalunga) } == Legacy == As stated previously, Benvenuto's only known follower was his son, Girolamo. Nonetheless, it is believed that he did have influence upon other artists during his life. Specifically, works by the Sienese painter, Andrea di Niccol√≤, show significant evidence of Benvenuto's influence. In her dissertation, Diane Vatne details this connection, showing that Andrea and Benvenuto had a lifelong relationship, beginning with Benvenuto writing Andrea's tax returns in 1481 and continuing through Benvenuto's influence upon Andrea's work. However, it must be noted that Andrea was not a follower or student of Benvenuto, the latter's influence was a mere result of proximity, both physically and emotionally. Benvenuto's influence is the most evident in Andrea's 1502 version of the Crucifixion. In this painting, the sharpness and intensity of the drapery, figures, and colors point directly towards the influence of Benvenuto's later style. Other works are less obviously influenced by Benvenuto, but still hold characteristics that point towards his impact upon Andrea. These characteristics are largely ones pertaining towards Benvenuto's distinct naturalistic depiction of figures, crisp backgrounds, and intentional draping of clothing that are evident in Andrea's works.Vatne, Diane. 1990. \\"Andrea Di Niccolo, c. 1445-c. 1525: Sienese Painter of the Renaissance.\\" Order No. 9030434, Indiana University. http://search.proquest.com/docview/303862274. == References Further reading== * (see index; plates 69-70) ==External links== Category:1430s births Category:1500s deaths Category:People from Siena Category:15th-century Italian painters Category:Italian male painters Category:16th-century Italian painters Category:Sienese painters ","title":"Benvenuto di Giovanni"},{"id":"20152862","text":"The following is an episode list for the American television sitcom Rude Awakening, which ran from August 1, 1998 until February 15, 2001.

The town is located northwest of Papineauville. The municipality includes the settlements of Montpellier and Lac-Schryer. Its western portion consists mostly of undeveloped Laurentian Hills, part of the Papineau-Labelle Wildlife Reserve. ==History== In the late 19th century, pioneers arrived in the area searching for work in logging and agriculture. In 1882, in the north-west of what would later become the village, the forestry company W.C. Edwards opened a project to exploit timber at Muskrat Lake. Under the supervision of foreman, a man named Schraire, the log drivers brought logs down the creek to Lake Schryer to reach the saw mill downstream of the lake. Settlement occurred slowly along the shores of Lake Schryer. In 1892, Louis Beaulieu, called Montpellier, settled here on a farm and opened a post office and general store. After his marriage to Albina Bissonnette, they settled in the village known as Montpellier today. Shortly after, Moses Faubert left Mulgrave Township and settled here with his sixteen children. Several other families from neighboring townships came to reside in the village, contributing to the development of the small community. In 1900, construction began on a chapel at the village center. On 25 September 1902, the mission of Notre-Dame-de-la- Consolation was founded, and on 21 October 1907, the Archbishop of Ottawa decreed the establishment of the parish. On 23 October 1920, the Municipality of Montpellier was formed, matching the boundaries of the parish. In 1998, the southern portion of the Lac-des-√âcorces Unorganized Territory was annexed by Montpellier, adding about and more than doubling its size. ==Demographics== Mother tongue: * English as first language: 3.0% * French as first language: 94.9% * English and French as first language: 1.0% * Other as first language: 1.0% ==Local government== List of former mayors: * Rh√©o Faubert (2001‚Äì2005) * St√©phane S√©guin (2005‚Äì2009) * Pierre Bernier (2009-2013) * St√©phane S√©guin (2013‚Äìpresent) ==References * Category:Incorporated places in Outaouais Category:Municipalities in Quebec ","title":"Montpellier, Quebec"},{"id":"20152908","text":"WLKM may refer to: * WLKM-FM, a radio station (95.9 FM) licensed to Three Rivers, Michigan, United States * WRCI, a radio station (1520 AM) licensed to Three Rivers, Michigan, United States, which held the call sign WLKM until September 2008 * WLKM machine gun ‚Äî Polish rotary machine gun.

A nearly complete reconstruction was assembled from four prints in Eastern European archives. The restored film received its North American premiere at the San Francisco International Film Festival on May 3, 2015. Fescourt used four cameramen to best capture movement, and often filmed in real locations mentioned in the novel, including the prison of Chateau d'If. The film has been critically praised as \\"an epic triumph of the silent cinema at its height,\\" distinguished by its combination of commercial cinema dramatics and techniques used by French impressionist filmmakers (including micro-flashbacks, extreme close-ups, zip-pans, energetic moving camera, and extreme shifts in focus). The BFI's Silent Film Guide writes that \\"the elegance and orchestration of the film-making is extraordinary\\" and praises the lavish scenes at the Paris Opera and Monte Cristo's mansion as \\"staggeringly opulent.\\" ==See also== *1929 in film ==References * *Monte Cristo (1929) at SilentEra *The Forgotten: \\"Monte Cristo\\" (1929) at Mubi: Notebook Category:1929 films Category:Films based on The Count of Monte Cristo Category:French films Category:French silent feature films Category:French historical adventure films Category:1920s historical adventure films Category:French black-and-white films ","title":"Monte Cristo (1929 film)"},{"id":"20152991","text":"The 1999 City of Imola motorcycle Grand Prix was the eleventh round of the 1999 Grand Prix motorcycle racing season.

They were intended for service on branch lines, for goods train duties on main lines and for shunting (rail) work. A total of 420 locomotives were built by various manufacturers for the Prussian state railways as well as 6 units for the Cronberg Railway, which had been taken over by the state railways in 1914. In 1923 they were included by the Deutsche Reichsbahn as DRG Class 90.0-2 in their initial numbering plan with running numbers 90 001 to 90 328. In 1925 the final plan recorded locomotives with the numbers 90 001 - 021, 90 024 - 90 115, 90 117 - 122 and 90 125 - 231 as well as the incorrectly designated Class 91 group with the numbers 91 088, 91 089, 91 109 - 114 and 91 301 and 302. They were joined later by 90 234 from the Bremen harbour railway, 90 235 - 237 from the Saar Railway and 90 241 - 245 from the L√ºbeck-B√ºchen Railway, that had ordered six new T 9.1 engines in 1900 and 1903, and later bought four more, second-hand, locomotives from the Prussian state railways. Several examples of this engine were handed over to foreign railway administrations and some of them later returned to the Deutsche Reichsbahn fleet during the Second World War as 90 246 - 251. Two T9.1 have been preserved: One at the Bochum-Dahlhausen Railway Museum as \\"C√∂ln 1833\\", later \\"C√∂ln 7270\\"Deutsche Gesellschaft f√ºr Eisenbahngeschichte (DGEG), which was restored and has been displayed in front of the Starlight Express Theatre in Bochum since 9 November 2015,Lokalkompass Bochum, the other is in the South German Railway Museum at Heilbronnhttp://www.eisenbahnmuseum- heilbronn.de/haupttext_t9_1.html as \\"C√∂ln 1857\\". T 9.1 C√∂ln 1833, since 1906 C√∂ln 7270 (Borsig 4431/1893), May 8, 2015 at Interlok workshop, Pila, Poland, after complete reconstruction. ==T 9 - Elberfeld variant== The T 9 Elberfeld variant of the Prussian state railways was a goods train tank locomotive with an 0-6-2 wheel arrangement. These vehicles were planned for service on the line between Elberfeld and Cronenberg. For that purpose the firm of George Krauss built four examples, which were very similar to the Bavarian D VIII, because the Prussian T 3 was deemed to be too underpowered. After the locomotives had proved their worth, Henschel built another 33 examples. In the 1923 DRG renumbering plan for steam locomotives the locomotives were grouped into DRG Class 90.3 with running numbers 351 - 363. In addition they were joined by T 9.1 engines with numbers 90 154, 155, 167, 180 - 183. In the 1925 numbering plan only locomotive 90 116 was left. She was retired in 1931. Seven of these locomotives were handed over to private railways where they were in service until the 1950s. ==T 9 - Langenschwalbach variant== The Langenschwalbach variant of the T 9 with the Prussian state railways was a 0-6-2T tank locomotive. They were planned for service on the Aartalbahn between Wiesbaden and Langenschwalbach (today Bad Schwalbach), because this line, with inclines of up to 3,3%, had proven too steep for the Prussian T 3 engines on duty there. As a result, it was decided in 1889 to build eight new locomotives for the 21.4 km long route. The engines had Allan valve gear, the carrying axle was designed as an Adams axle and the steam dome was located on the front boiler ring. Various brake systems were tested on these locos. In the 1923 renumbering plan, three locomotives were earmarked for renumbering to 90 002, 066 and 067. However, by 1925 they had been retired. In 1930, following the takeover of the Bremen harbour railway, two more locomotives of this type joined the Deutsche Reichsbahn as numbers 90 232 and 90 233. However they were retired in the same year. ==T 9 - Upper Hessian Railway== The single Upper Hessian Railway variant of the T9 was a goods train tank locomotive with a 0-6-2T wheel arrangement. It was built in 1895 by Krauss to a Bavarian design shortly before the transfer of this Hessian state railway to the Prussian state railways. It was given the number 26 by the Upper Hessian Railway; the Prussian state railway initially designated it as \\"Frankfurt 1871\\" and in 1906 as \\"Frankfurt 7205\\". ==T 9.2== Class T 9.2 of the Prussian state railways were goods train tank locomotives with a 2-6-0T wheel arrangement. They had the same range of tasks as the T 9.1, and its main dimensions were largely the same. The reason for its design was a fear that the riding qualities of the T 9.1 were too poor. As a result, it was given a leading axle instead of a trailing axle. Of the 235 machines built, 154 units were incorporated by the Deutsche Reichsbahn in its 1923 renumbering plan and designated as DRG Class 91.0-1. According to the 1925 numbering plan, 111 locomotives were taken over as 91 001‚Äì087, 91 090‚Äì108, 91 115, as well as the wrongly classified 90 023, 90 024, 90 123 and 90 124. The locos with running numbers 91 116‚Äì121 came from the Bremen harbour railway (91 116) and the Saar Railway. They were joined in 1938 by numbers 91 131‚Äì136 from the Brunswick State Railway. In the Second World War, locomotives 91 137‚Äì149 came from Poland. After the war there were only a few left in service. The Deutsche Bundesbahn retired its last machine in 1953 and the Deutsche Reichsbahn (GDR) followed suit in 1966. The Reichsbahn engine, 91 134, has been preserved and since August 2006 has been owned by the Mecklenburg Railway Society (Mecklenburgische Eisenbahnfreunden) in Schwerin. ==T 9.3== Class T 9.3 of the Prussian state railways were tank locomotives that were used both in passenger and freight train services. A total of 2,060 were of this type were built for the Prussian state railways (including those engines from the East Prussian Southern Railway which was nationalised in 1903). The Royal W√ºrttemberg State Railways procured a further 10 examples as the W√ºrttemberg T 9. The Imperial Railways in Alsace-Lorraine had bought a total of 132 T 9.3s. Even various private railways took delivery of the T 9.3. In 1925 it was included by the Deutsche Reichsbahn as DRG Class 91.3-18 and 91.20 in its numbering plan. This was an evolutionary development of the Prussian T 9.2, in which the main difference was the use of a Krauss-Helmholtz bogie instead of an Adams axle. That meant that its top speed could be increased to 60 km/h, and later even to 65 km/h. The Reichsbahn took over 1,503 machines from Prussia as 91 303 - 1805, of which ten T9.3s originally came from the Imperial Railways in Alsace-Lorraine; 31 from the Saar Railway as 91 1806 - 1836 and 10 W√ºrttemberg T 9s as 91 2001 - 2010. In the Second World War more locomotives were added from Belgium as numbers 91 1837 - 1844. On 1 April 1949,The day when almost all the private railways in East Germany were nationalised. the Deutsche Reichsbahn (GDR) took over yet more T 9.3s from private railway companies, with the numbers 91 6501, 6576, 6577, 6581 and 6582, some of which had been converted to superheating. Their retirement began after 1945 and was completed in the Deutsche Bundesbahn in 1964 and in the Deutsche Reichsbahn (GDR) in 1971. Six T 9.3s remained in Austria after the Second World War. Two were handed over to the SZD in 1948 (91 1700 and 1822), two were rather quickly retired (91 1421 in 1951 and 91 1314 in 1952). The remaining two engines, 91 1207 and 91 1347, formed √ñBB Class 691 retaining their serial numbers. Both were used in the St. P√∂lten region and retired in 1957.

While Governance, Risk Management, and Compliance refers to a generalized set of tools for managing a corporation or company, Legal GRC, or LGRC, refers to a specialized ‚Äì but similar ‚Äì set of toolsAdams, R., Mann, G., & Hobbs, V. (2017). ISEEK, a tool for high speed, concurrent, distributed forensic data acquisition. Paper presented in Valli, C. (Ed.). The Proceedings of 15th Australian Digital Forensics Conference 5‚Äì6 December 2017, Edith Cowan University, Perth, Australia utilized by attorneys, corporate legal departments, general counsel and law firms to govern themselves and their corporations, especially but not exclusively in relation to the law.Musthaler, Linda and Brian. Governance, risk management and compliance and what it means to you. Network World, March 7, 2007. Other specializations within the realm of governance, risk management and compliance include IT GRC and financial GRC. Within these three realms, there is a great deal of overlap, particularly in large corporations that have legal and IT departments, as well as financial departments. ==Legal governance== Legal governance refers to the establishment, execution and interpretation of processes and rules put in place by corporate legal departments in order to ensure a smoothly-run legal department and corporation.Konkle, Joshua L. Legal risk management requires a corporate strategy, mindset and commitment. DCIG,January 9, 2008. ==Legal risk management== Legal risk management refers to the process of evaluating alternative regulatory and non-regulatory responses to risk and selecting among them. Even with the legal realm, this process requires knowledge of the legal, economic and social factors, as well as knowledge of the business world in which legal teams operate.US Army Corps of Engineers Glossary. August 1998. In an organizational setting, risk management refers to the process by which an organization sets the risk tolerance, identifies potential risks and prioritizes the tolerance for risk based on the organization's business objectives, and manages and mitigates risks throughout the organization. ==Legal compliance== Legal compliance is the process or procedure to ensure that an organization follows relevant laws, regulations and business rules. The definition of legal compliance, especially in the context of corporate legal departments, has recently been expanded to include understanding and adhering to ethical codes within entire professions, as well. There are two requirements for an enterprise to be compliant with the law, first its policies need to be consistent with the law. Second, its policies need to be complete with respect to the law. The role of legal compliance has also been expanded to include self-monitoring the non-governed behavior with industries and corporations that could lead to workplace indiscretions.Bauer, Christopher. An ethics self-exam: ethical compliances is not just an issue for external review; auditors must look inward to ensure their own integrity is not compromised. Bnet, June 2004. Within the LGRC realm, it is important to keep in mind that if a strong legal governance component is in place, risk can be accurately assessed and the monitoring of legal compliance be carried out efficiently. It is also important to realize that within the LGRC framework, legal teams work closely with executive teams and other business departments to align their goals and ensure proper communication. ===Legal Consistency=== Legal Consistency is a property that declares enterprise policies to be free of contradictions with the law. Legal Consistency has been defined as not having multiple verdicts for the same case International Law and International Relations: An International Organization Reader. By Beth A. Simmons, Richard H. Steinberg Contributor Beth A. Simmons, Richard H. Steinberg Edition: illustrated Published by Cambridge University Press, 2007\\\\. , . The antonym Legal Inconsistency is defined as having two rule that contradict each other.Legisprudence: A New Theoretical Approach to Legislation : Proceedings of the Fourth Benelux-Scandinavian Symposium on Legal Theory By Luc Wintgens Contributor Luc Wintgens Edition: illustrated Published by Hart Publishing, 1998 , Other common definitions of consistency refer to ‚Äútreating similar cases alike‚Äù.Law and justice in the courts of classical Athens By Adriaan Lanni Published by Cambridge University Press, 2006 , In the enterprise context, legal consistency refers to ‚Äúobedience to the law‚Äù.The Measurement of Moral Judgment By Anne Colby, Lawrence Kohlberg Contributor Lawrence Kohlberg Edition: illustrated Published by CUP Archive, 1987 , In the context of legal requirements validation, legal consistency is defined as, \\" Enterprise requirements are legally consistent if they adhere to the legal requirements and include no contradictions.\\"Hassan, Wa√´l. PhD Thesis. University of Ottawa. University of Ottawa Press. 2009 ===Legal Completeness=== Legal Completeness is a property that declares enterprise policies to cover all scenarios included or suggested by the law. Completeness suggests that there are no scenarios covered by the law that cannot be implemented in the enterprise. In addition, it implies that all scenarios not allowed by the law are not allowed by the enterprise. Enterprise policies are said to be legally complete if they contain no gaps in the legal sense. Completeness can be thought of in two ways:Armour, J. Share Capital and Creditor Protection: Efficient Rules for a Modern Company Law. ESRC Centre for Business Research - Working Papers wp148, ESRC Centre for Business Research. 1999. Some scholars make use of a concept of ‚Äòobligational‚Äô completeness such as Ayres and Gertner.Ayres, Ian and Gertner, Robert (1992), ‚ÄòStrategic Contractual Inefficiency and the Optimal Choice of Legal Rules‚Äô, 101 Yale Law Journal 729 According to this usage, a system or a contract is ‚Äòobligationally‚Äô complete if it specifies what each party is to do in every situation, even if this is not the optimal action to take under some circumstances. Others discuss ‚Äòenforceability‚Äô completeness in the sense that failing to specify key terms can lead a court to characterize a system as being too uncertain to enforce (May & Butcher v the King 1934),Cases and Materials on Contracts By S. M. Waddams, Waddams, S. M., 1942-, Waddams, Trebilcock, mccamus, Neyers, Waldron Edition: 3 Published by Emond Montgomery Publication, 2005 , and hence a system may be complete with respect to enforceability. This leads to the following definition: enterprise regulations or requirements are legally complete if it specifies what each party is to do in each situation while covering all gaps in the legal sense. ==History== Lebogang says.Kim, Won-Kyu. The effect of industrial restructuring policy post-financial crisis. September/October 2007. Like the Sarbanes-Oxley act, legal industry thought leaders saw a need for a new framework for legal GRC, and borrowed heavily from IT, RIM and other industries to try to come up with new, clear processes and rules to make navigating the choppy waters of the post-financial crisis legal world go as smoothly as possible. ==OrganizationsLegal GRC Center for Innovation=== The Legal GRC Center for Innovation is a nonprofit institute for the advancement of the concepts and applications of Legal GRC. The LGRC Center for Innovation serves as a forum for legal industry leaders to discuss and determine ways to systematize and streamline within the legal industry. The membership of the LGRC-CFI is made up of a group of [thought leaders] in the legal, business, IT, and RIM fields. They meet in online forums and at periodic conventions and summits to determine best practices for Legal GRC. The LGRC-CFI also publishes a blog and several industry-specific white papers regularly. The LGRC Center for Innovation addresses legal governance, risk management, and compliance exclusively. ===Institute on Governance=== The Institute on Governance (IOG), although it does not address LGRC exclusively, is a useful resource for knowledge on governance in general, and has collected some significant basics about legal governance online. The IOG is an independent, Canadian, nonprofit [think tank] founded in 1990 to promote better governance for public benefit. Through our research and services we help public organizations and societies realize their objectives by putting good governance into practice. ===Association of Corporate Counsel=== The Association of Corporate Counsel (\\"ACC\\"), formerly the American Corporate Counsel Association (\\"ACCA\\"), is an association of in-house counsel, attorneys who work for corporations. The association publishes the magazine ACC Docket and arranges one of the United States‚Äô largest annual meetings for in-house attorneys. ACC was founded in 1982. It currently has more than 24,000 members from over 10,500 corporations in 77 countries.[1] The ACC does not address LGRC exclusively, but can be credited with laying some foundations for corporations ‚Äì the original practitioners of governance, risk management, and compliance ‚Äì and legal departments to begin to work together on overarching issues of governance, risk management, and compliance. ==References External links == *Institute on Governance home page *Legal GRC Center for Innovation home page Category:Business law ","title":"Legal governance, risk management, and compliance"},{"id":"20153126","text":"The 1999 Rio de Janeiro motorcycle Grand Prix was the fifteenth round of the 1999 Grand Prix motorcycle racing season.

Set in a police station in Brighton in the 1950s, it tells the story of Inspector Steine (Michael Fenton Stevens) and his colleagues Sergeant Brunswick (John Ramm) and Constable Twitten (Matt Green), plus the station charlady Mrs Groynes (Jan Ravens in Series 1 and Samantha Spiro from Series 2 onwards). Guest stars have included Janet Ellis, Mark Heap, Allan Corduner and Carla Mendonca. The programme was inspired by the opening rolling caption about crime in Brighton at the beginning of the film Brighton Rock, which claimed that Brighton was now (in the 1950s) free of crime. Lynne Truss has written that: \\"This highly unrealistic reassurance prefacing Brighton Rock was the inspiration for the comedy series Inspector Steine...I wanted to write about a celebrity police inspector in the 1950s who innocently (and touchingly) believed precisely what he had been told at the movies\\"[from Lynne Truss website http://www.lynnetruss.com/pages/content/index.asp?PageID=95] Four series of six episodes each were broadcast from 2007 to 2011, followed by a one-off Christmas episode \\"The Christmas of Inspector Steine\\" which was broadcast as part of the Afternoon Drama strand on BBC Radio 4 on 23 December 2013. ==Series 1== { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"width:100%; margin:auto;\\" - !

He is currently the head coach of the Switzerland national team, having previously managed a string of Swiss clubs as well as Italian side Lazio. He is an ethnic Croat from Bosnia and Herzegovina. He holds both Swiss and Bosnian passports. ==Early life== Petkoviƒá was born in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1963.

Both of his parents worked as educational workers, resulting in several transfers to other schools due to the family‚Äôs frequent moving. They first lived in Vrelo Bosne and then when he was five years old, in Had≈æiƒái near Sarajevo. ==Playing career== A midfielder with good technique, Petkoviƒá started playing football in Ilid≈æa as an eleven-year-old before joining the youth sector of his hometown side FK Sarajevo as a fifteen-year-old. He remained at FK Sarajevo and began his professional career there in the early 1980s. Petkoviƒá made only a handful of appearances in a strong Sarajevo side led on the pitch by Bosnia's player, Safet Su≈°iƒá. Petkoviƒá was a part of the Sarajevo side that won the 1984‚Äì85 Yugoslav First League, making only two league appearances for them. His time at Sarajevo was interrupted by two brief stints elsewhere, first a successful time with Rudar Prijedor, where Petkoviƒá showed a good of scoring form, and then a season in the Yugoslav Second League with NK Koper, which finished last and were relegated. Petkoviƒá emigrated from Yugoslavia in 1987, leaving FK Sarajevo and moving permanently to Switzerland, where he joined second division club Chur 97. After a season with Chur, Petkoviƒá moved to the Swiss top division, joining a strong Sion side. Sion achieved a third- place finish in the Nationalliga but Petkoviƒá left the club at the end of the season after only making six league appearances. After leaving Sion, Petkoviƒá moved back into the lower tiers, first joining Martigny-Sports before returning to his first Swiss club, Chur 97. Petkoviƒá enjoyed a career as a regular goalscoring midfielder in the Swiss second division, which included two more stints at Bellinzona and Lugano. Petkoviƒá completed his playing career as a player-manager with Bellinzona and Malcantone Agno, the latter having later merged with financially stricken Lugano. ==Managerial career== After his retirement from playing, he became a coach and his first job was player-manager at Bellinzona in 1997. In 2004, he took over the reins at Lugano before returning to Bellinzona for the fourth time in his career, where he led the club to the 2008 Swiss Cup final, only to lose out to Basel, and promotion to the Swiss Super League. At the beginning of the 2008‚Äì09 season, he was appointed as manager of Young Boys. After taking charge at the club, Petkoviƒá installed a 3‚Äì4‚Äì3 formation and took the Bern side to a second-placed league finish. After two more seasons with Young Boys, he was sacked after a 1‚Äì1 draw against Luzern on 7 May 2011. The club finished in third place in the league behind their rivals Z√ºrich and Basel. In 2011, he became the new manager of Turkish side Samsunspor. He resigned from that position in January 2012 with the club in the relegation zone. On 15 May 2012, he was named the new temporary manager of Sion until the end of the 2011‚Äì12 season. On 2 June 2012, Petkoviƒá became the new manager of Italian side Lazio in Serie A. With the club, he won the Coppa Italia in 2013, thanks to a goal from Senad Luliƒá. On 23 December 2013, it was announced that Petkoviƒá was to succeed Ottmar Hitzfeld as the manager of the Switzerland national team after the 2014 FIFA World Cup. As a result, Claudio Lotito fired Petkoviƒá claiming a breach of the contract due to not having been duly informed by Petkoviƒá about the latter's ongoing negotiations with the Swiss Football Association. Petkoviƒá was sacked as Lazio manager on 4 January 2014 and was replaced by Edy Reja. The legal dispute concerning the contract termination between S.S. Lazio and Petkoviƒá is still ongoing. Since his appointment to the national team spot in July 2014, Petkoviƒá has so far guided the Swiss to the round of 16 stages of both the UEFA Euro 2016 in France and the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia. ==Charitable work== While living in Switzerland, Petkoviƒá worked for Caritas Ticino, a Catholic relief development and social service organisation, for five years.Caritas-ticino.ch: Auguri a Vladimir Petkovic ==Managerial statistics== { style=\\"text-align:left\\" - !rowspan=\\"2\\"Team !rowspan=\\"2\\"From !rowspan=\\"2\\"To !colspan=\\"5\\"Record - ! ! ! ! ! - Bellinzona July 1997 May 1998 - Malcantone Agno 1999 2004 - Lugano June 2004 June 2005 - Bellinzona October 2005 June 2008 - Young Boys August 2008 8 May 2011 - Samsunspor 1 July 2011 27 January 2012 - Sion 15 May 2012 1 June 2012 - Lazio 2 June 2012 4 January 2014 - Switzerland 1 July 2014 Present - !colspan=\\"3\\"Total } ==HonoursPlayer=Club=== Sarajevo *Yugoslav First League: 1984‚Äì85 ===Manager=== Malcantone Agno *1.

It was also the first national title in the university's Division I history.\\"NCAA CHAMPS! Loyola Wins First NCAA Lacrosse Title, 9‚Äì3, Over Terps,\\" Loyola University Maryland Athletics, Monday, May 28, 2012. Loyola, a Jesuit university with over 3,700 undergraduates, has produced 13 USILA First Team All-Americans, 25 Second Team All-Americans, 18 Third Team All-Americans, and 68 Honorable Mention All-Americans.Media Guide, pg 48 The Greyhounds local rivals are the Johns Hopkins Blue Jays, located just down Charles Street. The annual lacrosse game played between these two institutions is known as the \\"Battle of Charles Street\\". The program also has another significant rival in Baltimore, maintaining an annual series with the Towson Tigers since 1959. ==HistoryBeginnings=== The Loyola Greyhounds men's lacrosse team was founded in 1938 and coached by Jack Kelly. Kelly coached five seasons before leaving after 1942, with an overall winning record consisting of 21 wins and 14 losses. The Greyhounds struggled after Kelly left, going through two coaches in two seasons, both of which did not break .250. In 1947 began the reign of the program's longest active coach until that time, Bishop Baker. Baker coached for six consecutive seasons, almost breaking even with wins and losses. He was followed by John Mohler, who only coached for one year. ===Charles Wenzel=== For 17 seasons, from 1954 to 1970, the Greyhounds were coached by Charles Wenzel. Under Wenzel, the Greyhounds went .379. ===Dave Cottle=== Men and women's lacrosse play home games at the Ridley Athletic Complex From 1983 to 2001, for almost two decades under Head Coach Dave Cottle, Loyola saw growth in to their lacrosse program. In 1982, Loyola moved up from NCAA Division II lacrosse. Starting in 1983, Cottle brought the Greyhounds national attention. The Greyhounds advanced to the 1990 NCAA Division I Men's Lacrosse Championship game where they were defeated by the Syracuse Orangemen. The 1990 championship, however, was revoked from Syracuse when investigations deemed the activity between coach Roy Simmons, Jr.'s wife Nancy and star player Paul Gait illegal. She signed the lease of his car earlier that season. Though the NCAA has yet to remove Syracuse from the record book, Loyola was the runner up and technically is the next in line for the trophy. In 1999, the Greyhounds went undefeated in the regular season before losing in the quarterfinals of the 1999 NCAA tournament. His run lasted 19 seasons, beginning in 1983 through 2001, Cottle coached his teams to a winning record of 181 wins and 70 losses, including a run of 14 straight seasons where Loyola received an NCAA tournament bid. ===Charley Toomey=== Following Cottle's long coaching tenure, Loyola hired Bill Dirrigl as their head coach. After four seasons Dirrigl was fired and Loyola graduate Charley Toomey took over as head coach in 2006. In both 2007 and 2008, Toomey led the Greyhounds to the NCAA Men's Lacrosse Championship tournament.Media Guide, pg 43 The 2010 and 2011 NCAA lacrosse championships were held at M&T; Bank Stadium. Loyola, worked in conjunction with Johns Hopkins, Towson, and UMBC to run these events. The Hounds failed to advance to the 2009 NCAA lacrosse playoffs despite having the ninth place RPI, the third highest strength of schedule, and a 9-5 record. Instead Brown gained the slot because of their wins over Cornell and University of Massachusetts. Brown had an RPI of twelve, their schedule ranked a low of thirty six, and were ranked third in the Ivy League.http://www.baltimoresun.com/sports/college/lacrosse/bal- sp.mendraw04may04,0,3410512.story Coach Toomey compared the 2009 Greyhound's dilemma to that of the 2006 Harvard squad saying, \\"I can remember in 2006, Harvard gets in at 6-6, losing their last three games, and they said, ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs not a numbers thing, it‚Äôs a strength-of-schedule thing.‚Äô ‚Ä¶ So what is it going to be? Is it going to be big wins or numbers? If it‚Äôs numbers, we look doggone good. If it‚Äôs about big wins, then we might be on the outside looking in.\\"http://weblogs.baltimoresun.com/sports/lacrosse/blog/2009/05/postscript_from_loyola_at_john.html Harvard made the tournament over Toomey's squad that season, the reason being that their 'big wins' were not as competitive as Harvard's record, RPI and SOS. RPI vs. Big wins has been a very large argument in the NCAA tournament selection process the past few years.http://www.baltimoresun.com/sports/college/lacrosse/bal- sp.preston04may04,0,1823874.column The Greyhounds captured the first national championship in Loyola's Division I history in a 9‚Äì3 victory over Maryland at Gillette Stadium on May 28, 2012. They finished at 18‚Äì1, establishing a new program record for most wins in a campaign. Its only loss was a regular- season-ending 10‚Äì9 overtime defeat at home to Johns Hopkins on April 28.\\"Last Second Overtime Goal Lifts No. 10 Hopkins Over No. 1 Men's Lax,\\" Loyola University Maryland Athletics, Saturday, April 28, 2012.

He also set the school record for most goals in a single season with 54. Sawyer, who had previously set the school's new single-season scoring mark earlier in the season, was Loyola's first-ever Tewaaraton Trophy finalist.\\"Sawyer Named Tewaaraton Award Finalist,\\" Loyola University Maryland Athletics, Thursday, May 10, 2012. ==Season Results== The following is a list of Loyola‚Äôs season results since the institution of NCAA Division I in 1971 (Loyola competed in NCAA Division II until 1983): {  - align=\\"center\\" ‚Ä†NCAA canceled 2020 collegiate activities due to the COVID-19 virus. ==Players== The Greyhounds have graduated many All-American players: 13 first team, 25 second team, 18 third team, and 68 honorable mentions.

It is a two tier system in which the majority of pupils in the Craigavon Borough Council Area and parts of Armagh City and District Council Area attend Junior High Schools for 3 years before transferring to Senior High Schools to complete their compulsory education in Key Stage 4.Southern Education and Library Board - Post Primary Education It does not exclude the possibility of academic selection at age 11 through the 11 Plus exam, whereupon pupils may proceed to the grammar school system on completion of primary education or carry on to other secondary schools. For those who opt out of the 11 Plus or don't pass it, they may go through an academic selection process at age 14 by taking internal exams that are set by the individual grammar schools, and entering the grammar sector at age 14. The Dickson Plan wasn't affected by the education reforms being pressed by Northern Ireland Education Minister, Caitr√≠ona Ruane, which required the controversial removal of academic selection at age 11 in the rest of Northern Ireland. However, The Dickson Plan is in the process of being demolished by the Education Minister John O'Dowd, who is planning to amalgamate the Junior High Schools and the Senior Education Schools, and creating a Comprehensive system throughout Northern Ireland. This is causing controversy throughout the local area. Mr O'Dowd, has in light of overwhelming parental support for the Dickson plan, backed down from abolishing the system. Over 80% of parents were in favour of maintaining the present system. Mr O'Dowd has had to bow to this support. However, three Catholic schools ( St Paul's Junior High, St Mary's Junior High and St Michael's Grammar) within the Lurgan area have recently opted out of the Dickson plan and amalgamated to form a new school. The new school is called St Ronan's College and is a non-selective co-educational comprehensive school which will cater for up to 1600+ pupils. A completely new school will be built at a cost of ¬£32 million and is due to open its doors in 2019. In the meantime St Ronan's will operate from three sites.

In 2001, after a poorly timed effort to begin a career in travel television-- that was unfortunately derailed by the September 11 attacks--he switched his focus to a cooking show. He produced his own test screening and distributed the tape to local San Diego television stations. San Diego's Fox affiliate XETV-TDT offered him a 2-3 minute slot during its morning news program. The job was unpaid‚Äîa situation that changed after his work earned a Regional Emmy from the National Television Academy's Pacific Southwest Chapter. In January 2005, Zien moved to County Television Network (CTN), San Diego County's public-access television, after CTN offered him a half-hour time slot on their station. His Sam the Cooking Guy show spread to other cities through agreements with sister cable companies; his work was recognized with more Regional Emmys and a book deal from John Wiley and Sons. Zien's next break came from the Discovery Health Channel, where Zien signed a deal to shoot the first season of a series called Just Grill This! The network was subsequently purchased by the Oprah Winfrey Network and not renewed for a second season In 2008, Zien appeared on NBC's The Today Show in a segment with Kathy Lee Gifford and Hota Kotb. After being interrupted repeatedly during the first half of the segment, Zien suddenly spoke emphatically - \\"Please, can I talk? I watch the show every day, everybody has issues with a lot of chatter back here. Pay attention, one minute.\\" A clip of the segment appeared on YouTube following its airing and in days had surpassed 2,000,000 views, with most commenters applauding Sam for his firm stance in the face of the NBC hosts. == Youtube Channel == On May 23, 2011, Zien premiered The Sam Livecast, an Internet cooking show originating from his home kitchen. Its thrice weekly episodes feature food-related and other subject matter, After 200 live episodes, the production switched to a live-to-tape format. Since moving away from the live streamed format, The Sam Livecast has transitioned into a YouTube channel under a different name - Sam the Cooking Guy - and experienced a surge in subscribers and views, reaching one million subscribers by early August 2019. == Restaurant == In July 2018, Zien opened his first restaurant - Not Not Tacos - a casual dining establishment featuring Zien's unique take on non-traditional tacos. Located within the Little Italy Food Hall in the Little Italy area of Downtown San Diego, Zien serves tacos such as Korean Short Rib, Pulled Pork with Macaroni and Cheese, Seared Salmon and Meatloaf. In March 2020, Zien opened a second restaurant in the Little Italy Food Hall, called Graze by Sam. == Cookbooks == Zien has written three cookbooks, all published by John Wiley & Sons: *Just a Bunch of Recipes (2008, ) *Awesome Recipes and Kitchen Shortcuts (2010, ) *Just Grill This!

The resulting applications can be run in a web browser or as standalone desktop applications. It contains a stand-alone Python-to-JavaScript compiler, an Ajax framework and widget toolkit, and through use of these components, developers can write comprehensive applications, to run in all major web browsers, without writing any JavaScript. Pyjs is a port of Google Web Toolkit (GWT) from Java to Python.pyjs README ==Development== Using pyjs, developers can write web applications in Python instead of JavaScript. The application is compiled to JavaScript. Also included is an Ajax library and widget setThe ui Module Class Hierarchy that provides access to the Document Object Model (DOM) of modern JavaScript-capable web browsers. The Ajax library and the widget set library are a hybrid mix of Python and JavaScript. Just as with Google Web Toolkit, pyjs is not its libraries, and neither is it just another Ajax framework. Ajax frameworks are strictly limited to providing pre-prepared specific functionality, written almost exclusively in tailor-made JavaScript. Both GWT and pyjs, being JavaScript compilers, allow the developer to work in the language with which they are familiar (Java or Python, respectively), to write their own custom widgets, either entirely from scratch or based on the existing available widgets, yet still target the full range of modern browsers. So, far from presenting web developers with a fait-accompli Ajax framework, pyjs gives you the freedom to develop your own. ==Design== The pyjs compiler is written in the programming language Python, and uses it to compile its input into JavaScript, walking the abstract syntax tree of the program being compiled. Although the compiler is stand-alone, the primary use of pyjs is for web development, so there is additional infrastructure for building web applications. The DOM.py model library is an abstraction layer - a thin layer of Python on top of JavaScript code snippets - use of which provides access to the full Document Object Model of the target browser platform. As with any compiler, the JavaScript snippets are treated as inline assembler. Furthermore, on top of the DOM.py model library is an additional abstraction layer, ui.py, which provides the most useful layer to web developers: a full suite of widgets with which desktop application developers will be familiar. At present, the list of available widgets is a mixture of the complete set of widgets that were available in Google Web Toolkit 1.2, along with a few more that have been forward-ported from GWT 1.5. ==Components== The major Pyjs components include: ;pyjs Python-to-JavaScript Compiler :Translates the programming language Python into JavaScript. ;Python builtin and standard emulation library :JavaScript implementations of the commonly used modules, builtins and classes in the Python standard runtime library (such as strings, lists, dictionaries, tuples, sets, getattr, map, filter, range, etc.; basic exception handling, a basic datetime and a basic math module). ;pyjs DOM libraryDOM module :Modules for manipulating the browser DOM. ;pyjs Web UI moduleui module :A module for creating widgets as if the web browser was a desktop widget engine. ;pyjs Desktop ports :Support for running pyjs apps as pure Python, under Trident (MSHTML), Gecko (XULRunner) or WebKit. Pyjs Desktop is conceptually close to GWT \\"Hosted\\" mode, except that the applications can be deployed live, under pyjs Desktop, rather than be used exclusively as a debugging tool. ==pyjs Desktop== The widget set library that comes with pyjs is so similar to PyQt and PyGTK that a port of pyjs was made to run pyjs applications on the desktop, called pyjs Desktop (formerly PyjamasDesktopPyjamasDesktop history, Python Wiki before May 2012 and originally hosted separately prior to version 0.6). The project uses Webkit, XULRunner or MSHTML as the underlying technology, and it is through these browser engines that pyjs manipulates the DOM model of the application. Together pyjs and pyjs Desktop allow writing cross-platform, cross-desktop, cross-browser and cross-widget applications that run on the web and on the desktop.Pyjamas - Python Applications for Desktop and Web, Luke Kenneth Casson Leighton (August 30, 2008)Coding in Pyjamas: Apps for Desktop and the Web Luke Kenneth Casson Leighton (November 7, 2008) ==History== Pyjamas was started by James Tauber as a port of the UI Widget Set and the DOM support libraries from Google Web Toolkit to the Python language. Tauber then wrote the original pyjs compiler. In 2008, Luke Leighton took over the project, updated the UI Widget Set, improved the compiler and created the three pyjs Desktop runtimes. Bernd Dorn and his colleagues from Lovely Systems did some dramatic compiler improvements released in version 0.5. Kees Bos is responsible for the majority of improvements and the enhanced Python interoperability in the compiler, such as the yield keyword support and long data types. C Anthony Risinger also joined as lead and administrator of the project. In 2012, the project was driven by an extensive community, but on May 2, due to disagreements between project leaders, some members created a pyjamas fork. This new team created pyjs.org, led by Anthony Risinger and including the person who owned the domain. Meanwhile, Luke Leighton continued his work on his own fork through a new domain pyj.be and continues to develop and maintain pyjamas on this branch. There was controversy over the copying of the mailing list data from the old server to create the new mailing list of Google Groups. This was raised as a violation of the UK Data Protection Act by Luke Leighton. Whether this was actually a legal violation is not really clear and is open to interpretation. This was a community driven open source project. According to many in the community, both Luke and Anthony were co-administrators of the project and co-leads to it. It was being forked by a team including Anthony, one of the administrators who had privileges for the server, which Luke Leighton owned. The mailing list was part of the domain. So the ownership of the mailing list data itself isn't very clear. Though Luke claims he personally owned the mailing list and that using it to create a new mailing list for the new pyjs.org fork of the project constituted stealing, many in the community feel differently. Many feel that this was an open source community project and Luke Leighton was a co-lead and co-administrator. Hence the mailing list was actually a community property of the pyjs.org community and not the personal property of Luke. Even though the ownership of the mailing list data is not entirely clear, when some members complained about being subscribed to the new google groups mailing list, immediate action was taken by the maintainers of the new pyjs.org fork to remove everyone from the new google groups and invited all the members to voluntarily join the new google groups. This being exactly the same approach that Leighton took when he decided to move the pyjamas mailing list from google groups where it was originally created before Leighton took over leadership of the project. The current membership of the Google Groups owned and maintained by both forks of the original pyjs.org is now voluntary, created through invitation, and does not violate any privacy and data protection laws. There are no unresolved legal issues at this time nor any pending lawsuits with either forks of the pyjamas project. Both forks were actively developed and had formed their own community following. ==Forks== There were two forks of the Pyjamas/Pyjs project: one maintained by the new Pyjs team and another maintained by Luke Leighton. ===Pyjs.org=== The Pyjs.org fork, has gone through active development. * New GitHub based infrastructure * Travis CI based continuous integration for both build, install and automated testing * pip install and VirtualEnv based development environment * Separation of pyjs tools from pyjs GWT widgets to allow other widgets sets to be developed * Built-in Closure compiler integration * GI Introspection/WebKit-GTK based pyjs-desktop runner ===Pyj.be=== Pyj.be, continued to be maintained by Luke Leighton and was still active with bug fixes and new development. As of early 2015, however, the website is not available anymore. ==Critics== Pyjs has been criticized by heavy users for several aspects:Why Pyjamas Isn't a Good Framework for Web Apps , Alexander Tsepkov (July 29, 2012) * Browser detection instead of feature detection * Bloat and boilerplate hell (Python feature coverage is favored over speed and size) * Debugging (perfect with Pyjs Desktop, but that is broken for more than 3 years) * Python is not Java, DOM is not a Desktop (the underlying GWT unnecessarily fakes a desktop GUI) On the other hand, as a dynamically typed language Python is a specifically good fit for compiling code to JavaScript, actually a more natural fit than GWT's original Java-to- JavaScript approach.Thinking alike, comment by user cananian (Nov 5, 2008) ==Alternatives== Most alternatives to Pyjamas are translators rather than frameworks.Pyjamas Alternatives for Web Development , Alexander Tsepkov (September 17, 2012) * Brython * GlowScript * py2js * PyCow * Pyjaco * PyvaScript * RapydScript * Transcrypt ==References * Pyjs Home Category:Free software programmed in Python Category:JavaScript libraries Category:Rich Internet application frameworks Category:Software using the Apache license Category:Web development software Category:Widget toolkits ","title":"Pyjs"},{"id":"20153381","text":"Yemi≈üanlƒ± may refer to: *Yemi≈üanlƒ±, Oghuz, Azerbaijan *Yemi≈üanlƒ±, Qabala, Azerbaijan ","title":"Yemi≈üanlƒ±"},{"id":"20153398","text":"The Whitefish Point Underwater Preserve was established in 1987 to protect and conserve shipwrecks and historical resources on of Lake Superior bottomlands in Whitefish Bay and around Whitefish Point, Michigan. The formation of the Michigan Underwater Preserves helped stop controversy over artifact removal from shipwrecks of this area. The preserve is now known for deep, well preserved shipwrecks in clear water accessible to scuba divers with technical skill and experience. The preserve is one of the last places in the Great Lakes to observe shipwrecks without zebra mussel encrustation. ==History== Shipwrecks along the southern Lake Superior coast known as the \\"Graveyard of the Great Lakes\\" dramatically increased after the first lock on the St. Marys River opened this coastline to shipping in 1855. Every vessel entering or leaving Lake Superior must pass Whitefish Point. The Whitefish Point Light first established in 1849 is arguably the most important light on Lake Superior. More vessels have been lost in the Whitefish Point area than any other part of Lake Superior. Between the loss of the Invincible in 1816 and the sinking of the SS Edmund Fitzgerald in 1975, the Whitefish Point area has claimed at least 240 ships. Vessels are funneled through Whitefish Bay downbound and upbound from the Soo Locks. Poor visibility from forest fire smoke, snow squalls, and Lake Superior's notorious fogs had deadly consequences with the traffic congestion. Lake Superior's of open water and storms from the northwest can build immense seas with offshore waves of or more. Such a storm sank the SS Edmund Fitzgerald from Whitefish Point in 1975. Sport diver Harrington reported that many of the shipwrecks of the Whitefish Point Underwater Preserve were \\"stripped of important artifacts in the 1970s and early 1980s. The State of Michigan filed a lawsuit against the Great Lakes Shipwreck Historical Society (GLSHS) for illegal removal of artifacts from Great Lakes bottomlands. The Michigan Department of Natural Resources (DNR) obtained a search warrant in 1992 and raided on the GLSHS's offices and Great Lakes Shipwreck Museum. The DNR found evidence the Shipwreck Society had: Many of the artifacts removed from shipwrecks by the GLSHS without permits are displayed at the Great Lakes Shipwreck Museum at Whitefish Point by a settlement agreement with the state of Michigan. The sport diving community raised a furious outcry over the disparity of special treatment for the museum divers who received no criminal prosecution while individual sport divers were prosecuted freely during the late 1980s and 1990s for removal of artifacts from shipwrecks. To this day many sport divers boycott the Great Lakes Shipwreck Museum. ==Preserve formation== The Whitefish Point Underwater Preserve was established in 1987 to protect some of the region's most sensitive underwater natural and cultural resources with the central objective to provide enhanced management of shipwrecks. The Whitefish Point Underwater Preserve is administered through the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality Submerged Lands Program and the Michigan Department of History, Arts and Libraries of the Michigan Historical Center. Scuba divers and history enthusiasts now help ensure the integrity of the preserve which is considered an underwater museum. == Features == Many of the twenty-three known shipwrecks lying in depths from to are moored to protect the wrecks and enhance the safety of divers. The preserve has good visibility and offers deep water diving on a variety of shipwrecks. The preserve is one of the last places in the Great Lakes to observe shipwrecks without zebra mussel encrustation. Dry suits are recommended due to cold temperatures and unprotected coves or bays.

Between announcement and stable release, a number of Community Technology Preview (CTP) releases were made. On March 27, 2015, Microsoft released Small Basic version 1.1, which fixed a bug and upgraded the targeted .NET Framework version from version 3.5 to version 4.5. Microsoft released Small Basic version 1.2 on October 1, 2015. Version 1.2 was the first update after a four-year hiatus to introduce new features to Small Basic. The update added classes for working with Microsoft's Kinect motion sensors, increased the number of languages supported by the included Dictionary object, and fixed a number of bugs. On February 19, 2019, Microsoft announced Small Basic Online (SBO). It is open source software released under MIT License on GitHub.https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Small-Basic- Blog/Announcing-Small-Basic-Online-1-0-Public- Preview/ba-p/353682https://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/52801.microsoft- small-basic-online-v1-0-cs-installation-guide.aspx ==Language== In Small Basic, one writes the illustrative \\"Hello, World!\\" program as follows: TextWindow.WriteLine(\\"Hello, World!\\") Microsoft Small Basic is Turing complete. It supports conditional branching, loop structures, and subroutines for event handling. Variables are weakly typed and dynamic with no scoping rules. ===Conditional branching=== The following example demonstrates conditional branching. It requests the current temperature in Fahrenheit and comments on the answer. TextWindow.Write(\\"Enter the temperature today (in F): \\") temp = TextWindow.ReadNumber() If temp > 100 Then TextWindow.WriteLine(\\"It is pretty hot.\\") ElseIf temp > 70 Then TextWindow.WriteLine(\\"It is pretty nice.\\") ElseIf temp > 50 Then TextWindow.WriteLine(\\"Don't forget your coat.\\") Else TextWindow.WriteLine(\\"Stay home.\\") EndIf ===Looping=== This example demonstrates a loop. Starting from one and ending with ten, it multiplies each number by four and displays the result of the multiplication. TextWindow.WriteLine(\\"Multiplication Tables\\") For i = 1 To 10 TextWindow.Write(i * 4) EndFor \`While\` loops are also supported, and the demonstrated \`For\` loop can be augmented through the use of the \`Step\` keyword. The \`Step\` keyword is used in setting the value by which the counter variable, \`i\`, is incremented each iteration. ===Data types=== Small Basic supports basic data types, like strings, integers and decimals, and will readily convert one type to another as required by the situation. In the example, both the \`Read\` and \`ReadNumber\` methods read a string from the command line, but \`ReadNumber\` rejects any non-numeric characters. This allows the string to be converted to a numeric type and treated as a number rather than a string by the \`+\` operator. TextWindow.WriteLine(\\"Enter your name: \\") name = TextWindow.Read() TextWindow.Write(\\"Enter your age: \\") age = TextWindow.ReadNumber() TextWindow.WriteLine(\\"Hello, \\" + name + \\"!\\") TextWindow.WriteLine(\\"In 5 years, you shall be \\" + ( age + 5 ) + \\" years old!\\") As Small Basic will readily convert among data types, numbers can be manipulated as strings and numeric strings as numbers. This is demonstrated through the second example. TextWindow.WriteLine(Math.log(\\"100\\")) 'Prints 2 TextWindow.WriteLine(\\"100\\" + \\"3000\\") ' Prints 3100 TextWindow.WriteLine(\\"Windows \\" + 8) ' Prints Windows 8 TextWindow.WriteLine(Text.GetLength(1023.42)) ' Prints 7 (length of decimal representation including decimal point) In the second example, both strings are treated as numbers and added together, producing the output 3100. To concatenate the two values, producing the output 1003000, it is necessary to use the \`Text.Append(text1, text2)\` method. ==Libraries Standard library === The Small Basic standard library includes basic classes for mathematics, string handling, and input/output, as well as more exotic classes that are intended to make using the language more fun for learners. Examples of these include a Turtle graphics class, a class for retrieving photos from Flickr, and classes for interacting with Microsoft Kinect sensors. To make the classes easier to use for learners, they have been simplified. This simplification is demonstrated through the code used to retrieve a random mountain-themed image from Flickr: For i = 1 To 10 pic = Flickr.GetRandomPicture(\\"mountains\\") Desktop.SetWallPaper(pic) Program.Delay(10000) EndFor  Turtle graphics  Small Basic includes a \\"Turtle\\" graphics library that borrows from the Logo family of programming languages. For example, to draw a square using the turtle, the turtle is moved forward by a given number of pixels and rotated 90 degrees in a given direction. This action is then repeated four times to draw the four sides of the square. For i = 1 to 4 Turtle.Move(100) ' Forward 100 pixels Turtle.Turn(90) ' Turn 90 degrees right EndFor More complex drawings are possible by altering the turning angle of the turtle and the number of iterations of the loop. For example, one can draw a hexagon by setting the turn angle to 60 degrees and the number of iterations to six. === Third-party libraries === Small Basic allows the use of third-party libraries. These libraries must be written in a CLR-compatible language, and the compiled binaries must target a compatible .NET Framework version. The classes provided by the library are required to be static, flagged with a specific attribute, and must use a specific data type. An example of a class to be used in Small Basic is provided below, written in C#. [SmallBasicType] public static class ExampleClass { public static Primitive Add(Primitive A, Primitive B) => A + B; public static Primitive SomeProperty { get; set; } public static Primitive Pi => (Primitive)3.14159; } If available, the Small Basic development environment will display documentation for third-party libraries. The development environment accepts documentation in the form of an XML file, which can be automatically generated from source code comments by tools such as Microsoft Visual Studio and MonoDevelop. ==ReferencesComputer Science for Kids by Kidware Software * Learn to Program with Small Basic by No Starch * The Basics of Small Basic discussion with Vijaye Raji and Erik Meijer on SmallBasic * Introduction to Small Basic discussion with Vijaye Raji and Robert Hess on SmallBasic * Microsoft Small Basic for .NET Review of Microsoft Small Basic, with sample application * Category:Microsoft Small Basic Tasks implemented in Microsoft Small Basic on rosettacode.org Small Basic Category:BASIC programming language family Category:Educational programming languages Category:.NET programming languages Category:Computer-related introductions in 2008 Category:Microsoft free software Category:Programming languages created in 2008 Category:Articles with example C Sharp code Category:Software using the MIT license ","title":"Microsoft Small Basic"},{"id":"20153740","text":"Bengur Bryan & Co., Inc. is an investment banking firm founded in 1991 with offices in Baltimore, MD.

Syria's response was the shelling of the Israeli settlements of Upper Galilee from the Golan Heights as they had done for years. Two Syrian artillery battalions with M46 Soviet 130mm guns and two companies with heavy mortars and dug-in German World War II Panzer IV tanks were positioned along the Golan escarpment. In 1976, Israeli defense minister Moshe Dayan said that Israel provoked more than 80% of the clashes with Syria. Jan M√ºhren, a former UN observer in the area at the time, told a Dutch current affairs programme that Israel provoked the majority of the border incidents with Syria, to annex more land.* Israel suffered the loss of 2 civilians and 16 more wounded.

It is time to finish the job.\\" While Prime Minister Levi Eshkol, himself a kibbutznik from Degania Bet, was highly sympathetic to the pleas, Defense Minister Moshe Dayan was reluctant to open multiple fronts at the same time and worried about possible Russian intervention on behalf of the Syrians. Haim Ber, the spokesman of the settlements in the north, called Eshkol and shouted in desperation \\"We're being shelled non-stop! We demand that the government free us from this nightmare!\\" ===Thursday, June 8, 1967 (day 4)=== On June 8, the Israeli Air Force (IAF) bombarded the Syrian positions on the Golan Heights throughout the day in an attempt to silence the Syrian guns and to press the Syrian government to rethink its position as Egypt and Jordan had now agreed to a cease fire. It seemed the war was over after four days. At 1910 hrs on Thursday evening, Eshkol tried once more to overcome Dayan's objections. ==Friday, June 9, 1967 (day 5)== Bird's eye view of Tel Azaziat, Burj Babil, Tel Faher, Zaura At 0600 hrs on Friday, June 9, Brig. Gen. Dado Elazar of the Northern Command was woken up by a phone call from Dayan: \\"Can you attack? Then attack.\\" Dayan had changed his mind. He told his chief of staff, \\"If the Syrians sit quietly, I won't approve any action against them, but if in spite of all our restraint they continue shelling, I will recommend to the Cabinet that we take the entire Heights.\\" Operation Hammer had been planned as a night attack. It was dangerous enough even in darkness, but an assault on the Golan Heights during daylight would be suicidal. The offensive was planned for 1130 hrs to give the IAF enough of time to continue its bombardment and to give the Israeli combat engineers time to create a path through enemy mine fields. Fortunately the winter rains had exposed many of the mines and the Syrians had not replaced them. The IAF was dropping some 400 tons of ordnance on the Heights from Mount Hermon in the north to Tawfiq (near Hamat Gader) in the south, including some captured rockets from Egyptian stocks. Contrary to Syrian expectations, the IDF was not planning to launch the initial attack via the Customs House road (opposite Gadot), but where the enemy least expected it, in a large pincer movement: in the north from the Galilee Panhandle, and on the opposite side from south of the Sea of Galilee. The 8th Armored Brigade of Colonel Albert Mandler was moved from the Sinai theatre to Kfar Szold in the northern part of the Galilee Panhandle. It had only 33 serviceable M50 and M51 Sherman tanks. Within minutes, the Syrian guns opened fire, not against the advancing troops, but still to the Israeli settlements. Of the eight armored bulldozers five never made it to the top. The Syrians started to confront them with heavy fire. ===First breakthrough=== M3 Half-track at Tel Faher A breakthrough was achieved between Givat HaEm and Tel Azaziat. Soon the tanks overran the abandoned Syrian position at Gur el Askar, shortly afterwards the strongpoint at Na'amush, while the Syrians were fleeing from the post. Three hours after the 8th Armored Brigade began the offensive, the 1st Golani Infantry Brigade crossed the border at the same place to launch the assault on the entrenchments of Tel Faher and Tel Azaziat. The attack on Tel Faher was difficult while the capture of Tel Azaziat was done relatively easy. The horseshoe-shaped fort was two kilometers inside the Golan Heights, protected with multiple guns, extensive mine fields and three belts of two-sided sloping fences and coiled barbed-wire. Despite the artillery bombardments the position remained relatively intact. The leading officer found the planned climb to the rear of Tel Faher to be impassable and the battalion commander decided to continue northward. They approached the position where it was strongest instead from the rear. From a few hundred meters they came under heavy fire from Syrian tanks. Three out of nine Sherman tanks and seven out of 20 half-tracks disabled by gunfire.◊™◊ú ◊î◊™◊¢◊ú◊ï◊™ ◊î◊ß◊®◊ë ◊¢◊ú ◊™◊ú ◊§◊ê◊ó◊®, ◊©◊ú◊û◊î ◊û◊ü Soldiers' barracks The internal Syrian army report showed failure in leadership, leading to chaos and desertion: > With the enemy just 700 meters away, under heavy shelling, the platoon in > the front trench prepared for the battle.

Oren, p.283 ===The First Platoon Attack=== Entry to bunker The battalion commander and the leading company with only 25 soldiers that were now separated from the rest of the battalion arrived under Tel Faher. The battalion commander Lieutenant- Colonel Moshe 'Musa' Klein ordered the 25 Golanis, who survived the initial Syrian fire, to attack the position from two flanks. Both the southern part and the northern were heavy protected with bunkers, trenches and a double row of wire. Inside waited a company of the Syrian 187th Infantry Battalion with an arsenal of anti tank guns, machine guns and 82 mm mortars. Its Syrian captain remembered : \\"It was one of our most fortified positions. It placed the Israelis directly in our crosshairs.\\" Northern flank The Syrian commander of the northern part ordered his men not to fire until the Israelis reached the wire to catch them in a kill zone. Only minutes later, his deputy reported that \\"the Jews are already inside.\\" The battle continued for more than three hours. Of the group of 11 who fought on the southern part 3 Israeli soldiers survived, and of the northern group of 10 only Corporal Yitzhak Hamawi survived. ◊™◊ú ◊î◊™◊¢◊ú◊ï◊™ ◊î◊ß◊®◊ë ◊¢◊ú ◊™◊ú ◊§◊ê◊ó◊®, ◊©◊ú◊û◊î ◊û◊ü > \\"We ran, Musa (Klein) and I through the trenches.

They penetrated no deeper than 8 miles into Syrian territory, but established a five mile wide bridgehead between Zaura and Qela. They used the night of 9/10 June to regroup and resupply its forces. At the same time the Syrian Government was pleading with other Arab countries for military support, but no assistance was forthcoming. Syria realized that they now stood alone against the IDF. The Golan Heights had fallen in just 31 hours.The Six Day War 1967: Jordan and Syria, by Simon Dunstan, p.88 ===Medals of valor=== Following Israeli soldiers were decorated in April 1973 with a medal of valor.Medal of Valor *David Shirazi (posthumously) Private David Shirazi was part of the assault team that had to climb up the 100m rigged slope under heavy Syrian mortar and machine gun fire to reach the barbed wire fence. Wire cutters would have taken too long. He lay himself across the wire and told his comrades to use his body as a bridge. After the last one got through he untangled himself and ran after them into the Syrian position. When the machine gunner fell wounded, he took his weapon and continued the attack until he was killed some minutes later. *Moshe Drimmer (posthumously) Private Moshe Drimmer belonged to a group of nine combat soldiers who had to clear the path of mines for the tanks. A few hundred meters from Tel Faher he came under heavy fire. His half-track was hit and burst into flames. Nevertheless, he turned the machine gun inside the burning vehicle towards the Syrian position and gave covering fire to his comrades. He continued firing until his vehicle was hit again and exploded. *Natanel Horovitz Lieutenant Natanel Horovitz was the commander of one of the three tanks that reached Qela. His commander, Lieutenant-Colonel Arye Biro, was badly wounded by splinters but continued to lead until he collapsed and had to be evacuated. He sent Natanel Horovitz to take the lead. Horovitz' company raced through the relatively weak outpost of Gur el Askar, continued towards Na'amush. There he should have been united with another company to storm Na'amush, but due to delays, he continued on his own. He successfully passed the Ukda position. Suddenly he realized that he was storming Sir Adib, which he had been trying to avoid. But he was fully engaged and had no other choice than continue his assault. Captain Yuval Ben-Arzi tried to contact Horovitz to tell him to storm Qela, but couldn't reach him, because the hatch was hit and wounded him in the head. His blood had shorted the radio intercom in his helmet. The second in command, Major Rafael Mokady was dead and several other officers dead or wounded, the battle group was at a crisis point. Only the wounded Lt. Horovitz was still advancing. In the end, he entered the enemy stronghold with just two other tanks and captured the position. Later he rose to a senior rank in the IDF. *Shaul Vardi Sergeant Shaul Vardi was one of the tank commanders that stormed Qela. On the way to Qela he had destroyed several fortified Syrian positions. But when his tank was hit, he got wounded in the face and was unable to see for a while. When he recovered his sight, he continued to fight. His tank was hit for a second time and this time knocked out. Armed with only Uzi SMGs and hand grenades, he and his men continued to clear Syrian positions. Only after the objective was achieved, he allowed himself to be evacuated to hospital. ==Today== IDF memorial site Golani Battalion flag Many of the trenches and bunkers of Tel Faher are in the same condition as they were on capture. It was the 1st Golani Brigade that captured the pivotal position at a cost in casualties. The place is now called Mitzpe Golani or Golani Lookout. ==References== Category:Geography of Northern District (Israel) Category:Geography of Syria ","title":"Tel Faher"},{"id":"20153873","text":"The 2005 France rugby union tour of South Africa and Australia was a series of matches played in June and July 2005 in South Africa and Australia by France. ==Matches== South Africa: 15.Percy Montgomery, 14.Jean de Villiers, 13.Marius Joubert, 12.De Wet Barry, 11.Bryan Habana, 10.Jaco van der Westhuyzen, 9.Fourie du Preez, 8.Jacques Cronje, 7.Danie Rossouw, 6.Schalk Burger, 5.Victor Matfield, 4.Albert van den Berg, 3.Eddie Andrews, 2.John Smit (capt.), 1.Os du Randt, ‚Äì replacements: 17.CJ van der Linde ‚Äì No entry : 16.Hanyani Shimange, 18.Juan Smith, 19.Joe van Niekerk, 20.Ricky Januarie, 21.Jaque Fourie, 22.Brent Russell France: 15.Julien Laharrague, 14.Julien Candelon, 13.Florian Fritz, 12.Yannick Jauzion, 11.Cedric Heymans, 10.Frederic Michalak, 9.Jean-Baptiste Elissalde (capt), 8.Julien Bonnaire, 7.Olivier Magne, 6.Yannick Nyanga, 5.Romain Millo- Chluski, 4.Pascal Pape, 3.Sylvain Marconnet, 2.Sebastien Bruno, 1.Olivier Milloud, ‚Äì replacements: 16.William Servat, 17.Pieter de Villiers, 18.Gregory Lamboley, 19.Remy Martin, 20.Dimitri Yachvili, 21.Damien Traille, 22.Nicolas Brusque South Africa: 15.Percy Montgomery, 14.Jean de Villiers, 13.Marius Joubert, 12.De Wet Barry, 11.Bryan Habana, 10.Jaco van der Westhuyzen, 9.Ricky Januarie, 8.Jacques Cronje, 7.Danie Rossouw, 6.Schalk Burger , 5.Victor Matfield, 4.Albert van den Berg, 3.CJ van der Linde, 2.John Smit (capt.), 1.Lawrence Sephaka, ‚Äì replacements: 17.Gurthro Steenkamp, 18.Juan Smith, 19.Joe van Niekerk, 20.Fourie du Preez, 21.Jaque Fourie, 22.Brent Russell ‚Äì No entry : 16.Hanyani Shimange France: 14.Vincent Clerc, 13.Yannick Jauzion, 12.Damien Traille, 11.Cedric Heymans, 10.Frederic Michalak, 9.Dimitri Yachvili (capt.), 8.Julien Bonnaire, 7.Remy Martin, 6.Yannick Nyanga, 5.Thibault Privat, 4.Pascal Pape, 3.Pieter de Villiers, 2.William Servat, 1.Sylvain Marconnet, replacements: 17.Olivier Milloud, 18.Gregory Lamboley, 19.Olivier Magne, 20.Jean-Baptiste Elissalde, 21.Benoit Baby, Julien Laharrague ‚Äì No entry: 22.Julien Laharrague Australia: 15.Chris Latham, 14.Wendell Sailor, 13.Stirling Mortlock, 12.Matt Giteau, 11.Lote Tuqiri, 10.Stephen Larkham, 9.George Gregan (capt), 8.David Lyons, 7.George Smith, 6.Rocky Elsom, 5.Nathan Sharpe, 4.Mark Chisholm, 3.Al Baxter, 2.Jeremy Paul, 1.Bill Young, ‚Äì replacements: 16.Stephen Moore, 17.Matt Dunning, 18.Alister Campbell, 19.John Roe, 20.Chris Whitaker, 21.Morgan Turinui, 22.Mat Rogers France: 15.Nicolas Brusque, 14.Julien Laharrague, 13.Yannick Jauzion, 12.Benoit Baby, 11.Cedric Heymans, 10.Frederic Michalak, 9.Jean-Baptiste Elissalde (capt.), 8.Julien Bonnaire, 7.Olivier Magne, 6.Remy Martin, 5.Pascal Pape, 4.Gregory Lamboley, 3.Denis Avril, 2.Dimitri Szarzewski, 1.Olivier Milloud, ‚Äì replacements: 16.Sebastien Bruno, 17.Sylvain Marconnet, 18.Thibault Privat, 19.Yannick Nyanga, 20.Pieter de Villiers, 21.Damien Traille, 22.Julien Candelon == References == * * Category:2005 rugby union tours Category:Rugby union tours of Australia Category:France national rugby union team tours 2005 Category:2005 in South African rugby union Category:2005 in Australian rugby union Category:2004‚Äì05 in French rugby union Category:History of rugby union matches between Australia and France ","title":"2005 France rugby union tour of South Africa and Australia"},{"id":"20153899","text":"The Cabiri, a Seattle-based non-profit physical theater troupe, was founded in 1999 by Artistic Director John S. Murphy. In 2001, the troupe became legally incorporated (under the organization The Anunnaki Project) and obtained 501(c)(3) status from the IRS. The mission of The Cabiri and The Anunnaki Project is to preserve the mythologies of cultures that have passed into antiquity, utilizing theatrical, storytelling dance performances, educational presentations, and a free online encyclopedia of terms from folklore and mythology. Since its inception, the troupe has utilized a variety of mediums to present \\"performative mythology,\\" theatrical depictions of tales from folklore and mythology. Tales from Babylonian mythology, Celtic mythology, Chinese mythology, Greek mythology, Italian folklore, Japanese mythology, Romanian folklore, Russian mythology, Sumerian mythology, and other mythos have been utilized in past productions. The Cabiri's early work consisted primarily of street theater and performance art including fire dancing, stilt walking, and juggling. In 2001 the company began incorporating aerial dance on low-flying trapeze, aerial sling, aerial hoop (lyra), and other apparatus. Aerial dance has since become the primary performance focus of the troupe. In 2006, the organization expanded its activities to include aerial dance instruction for adults. The troupe draws from accredited academic resources that have undergone peer review when creating new work, and strives to educate the public about folklore and mythology via its theatrical productions. The organization's work has been presented to thousands of audience members throughout North America in the last decade and has been featured in a variety of media and arts-related publications. ==Performance history== * The Genesis of Ereshkigal (July 2000): utilizing puppetry, physical theatre, and fire performance, this early production depicted Ereshkigal's abduction by Kur and Enki's rescue attempt. * The Kojiki of Amaterasu (September 2001): one of the final performances on the stage at the old Seattle Opera House, the story of Japanese solar goddess Amaterasu. * Vasalisa the Beautiful (March 2002): a tale from Russian folklore, in which Baba Yaga, the forest witch encounters the lovely Vasalisa and sets before her three impossible tasks. * Dance of the Calusari (May 2003): in collaboration with Radost Folk Ensemble, explored Romanian folklore and the Calusari folk dancers. * The Ghost Game (October 2006): survey of folklore and mythology regarding ghosts; premise inspired by Hyaku Monogatari, a Japanese ghost story game. * Garden of Dreams (June 2007): nine tales depicting folklore and mythology of plants from a variety of cultures. * Gods of the Night (July 2008): seven Mesopotamian planetary gods and Inanna's epic descent to the Underworld and encounter with Ereshkigal, Queen of the Sumerian Underworld. * The Ghost Game: Tales of 13 Witches (October 2008): nine performances exploring the witch archetype in folklore and mythology. * The Ghost Game: Dead Gods (October 2009): six vignettes depicting deaths of deities from folklore and mythology. * Carpathian Dawn (April 2010): a full length production drawing tales from Slavic mythology including the bathhouse spirit Bannik, house spirits Domovoi, and primary god Svarog. * The Ghost Game: Devil In the Deep Blue Sea (October 2010): seven vignettes exploring tales from bodies of water, including the Slavic Rusalka, the Scottish Each uisge, Japanese Kappa, Ondine, and Egyptian Apep. * The Ghost Game: Winternacht (October 2011): vignettes exploring tales of winter, including the Slavic Marzanna, the Himalayan Yeti, Algonquian Wendigo, and Russian Father Frost, and Hittite Telepinu. * Tarhun: Legend of the Lightning God (April 2012): a full-length production depicting the storm god Tarhun and his battles against various foes including the great serpent Illuyanka, frost god Hahhimas and rock golem Ullikummi. == Publishing == In April 2012, the organization published its first book \\"Tarhun: Legend of the Lightning God.\\" Co-authored by Mark Teppo and John Murphy, the text explores Hittite mythology, focusing upon storm god mythos and includes a novelization of the script for the theatrical production by the same name. . == Photos == Image:Ishtar.jpg Members of The Cabiri performance troupe as \\"Ishtar\\", June 2009 Image:Cabiri-Nergal.jpgThe Cabiri performance troupe in \\"Nergal\\", July 2008 ==External links== *Official website *The Anunnaki Project website Category:1999 establishments in Washington (state) Category:Charities based in Washington (state) Category:Dance education in the United States Category:Dance organizations Category:Non-profit organizations based in Seattle Category:Performing groups established in 1999 Category:Theatre companies in Washington (state) Category:Theatrical organizations in the United States Category:Dance in Washington (state) ","title":"The Cabiri"},{"id":"20153901","text":"Kremers is a German and Dutch surname, a variation of Kramer. may refer to: *Erwin Kremers (born 1949), German football (soccer) player *Gidons Krƒìmers (born 1947), Latvian violinist and conductor *Helmut Kremers (born 1949), German football (soccer) player *Jimmy Kremers (born 1965), American baseball catcher *Johan Kremers (born 1933), Dutch Commissioner of the province of Limburg *Nienke Kremers (born 1985), Dutch field hockey player ==See also== *Kramer (disambiguation) *Kr√§mer Category:Dutch-language surnames Category:German-language surnames ","title":"Kremers"},{"id":"20153906","text":"Old Money is the eighth studio album by American guitarist and composer Omar Rodr√≠guez-L√≥pez, his first with Stones Throw Records who released CD and MP3 versions on November 10, 2008 and a vinyl version in February 2009.Stones Throw Online Store Rodr√≠guez-L√≥pez explained that the album is \\"loosely based on the concept of exploitative industrialists and, well, their old money.\\" Rodriguez-Lopez has hinted that this record was a thematic sequel to the 2006 album Amputechture by his band The Mars Volta.Stones Throw Records Website Review aggregate site Metacritic calculates a score of 70/100 for the album, but erroneously referred to it as \\"The debut album for the Mars Volta guitarist\\".

The Midland Railway took over the line in 1845 and made a number of improvements, including replacing the original Bagworth station with a new one on 1 August 1849. The Ellis family created the colliery and village of Ellistown in 1873 and the Midland renamed the station Bagworth and Ellistown on 1 October 1894. The Midland Railway became part of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway under the Grouping of 1923. The Leicester to Burton line became part of the London Midland Region of British Railways under the transport nationalisation of 1948. British Railways closed the station to passenger traffic on 7 September 1964. ==Reopening proposals== In the 1990s BR planned to restore passenger services to the Leicester to Burton upon Trent Line as the second phase of its Ivanhoe Line project.

The new millennium ushered in Filgate's various original bands, with live performances and album releases from Cinema, Universal Language (2000), Blast Room, Rock is Dead (2005), and a special guest appearance on legendary singer Chubby Checker's single Knock Down The Walls (2007), featuring a notable guitar solo by Filgate. In 2008, Filgate became established as a solo artist with his highly acclaimed instrumental album Worlds Within. Several songs have appeared as soundtrack music for major networks including A&E;'s 'Gene Simmons Family Jewels' and 'World of Cars' from Disney/Pixar resulting in sales, radio and web play in more than twenty countries worldwide. Additional solo releases from Filgate include Letting Go (2010), The Epic Singles (2011), 2 (2012), and a collection of works titled Progressive Collective (2012). Filgate's guitar work appeared once again on a Top 40 single from Chubby Checker called Changes in 2013. The Song was released on RED / Sony and Produced by the hill & hifi, aka. Mike Rogers and Gary Lefkowith. Another solo release Whistle-Stop (2013) soon followed. Filgate also composed and contributed a song called Strange How Things Come Back Around in 2014 for the album Blue Horizon by his former band Wishbone Ash. Most recently, for the summer of 2015 is the newly released epic instrumental track Pink Flamenco. ==References== Category:Wishbone Ash members Category:Living people Category:1965 births ","title":"Roger Filgate"},{"id":"20153971","text":"Correlated double sampling (CDS) is a method to measure electrical values such as voltages or currents that allows removing an undesired offset. It is used often when measuring sensor outputs. The output of the sensor is measured twice: once in a known condition and once in an unknown condition. The value measured from the known condition is then subtracted from the unknown condition to generate a value with a known relation to the physical quantity being measured. This is commonly used in switched-capacitor operational amplifiers to effectively double the gain of the charge sharing opamp, while adding an extra phase. When used in imagers, correlated double sampling is a noise reduction technique in which the reference voltage of the pixel (i.e., the pixel‚Äôs voltage after it is reset) is subtracted from the signal voltage of the pixel (i.e., the pixel‚Äôs voltage at the end of integration) at the end of each integration period, to cancel kTC noise (the thermal noise associated with the sensor's capacitance). == See also == * Dark-frame subtraction ==References== Category:Electricity Category:Measurement ","title":"Correlated double sampling"},{"id":"20153980","text":"These are the daytime Monday‚ÄìFriday schedules on all three networks for each calendar season beginning September 1953.

The pro-Soviet Party for Progress and Socialism supported the Morrocan government in Western Sahara.

He has been a newspaper reporter, columnist,http://www.syracuse.com/news/index.ssf/2012/01/syracuses_wsyr_radio_fills_jim.html photojournalist and editor, as well as a magazine writer and commentator on radio and television and a television reporter and manager. He is the author of \\"The Early Years,\\" a collection of newspaper columns, as well as a collection of essays, and four short novels. Lonsberry is a native of Canisteo, New York.http://www.canisteovalleynews.com/local/local- news/17287-lonsberry-blasts-modern-day-democratic-party.html == Radio shows == Once using the promotional tagline \\"The most fired man in Rochester media,\\" Lonsberry hosts two radio talk shows featuring a mix of news, political commentary, callers, and day-to-day anecdotes. One show airs on WHAM (AM) in Rochester, New York from 8 AM to 12 PM ET. The other airs on WSYR (AM) in Syracuse, New York from 3 PM to 6 PM. website. Lonsberry almost always expresses a conservative opinion about the issues he discusses on his talk shows. Typically, Lonsberry spends most of his shows discussing local and state issues‚Äîless frequently discussing national issues. Lonsberry also discusses life and family issues. Lonsberry is married to his third wife. He and his first wife divorced and his second marriage was annulled. When Lonsberry is absent, progressive talk radio host George Kilpatrick has occasionally filled in for him, a situation that brought Kilpatrick a certain degree of hate mail.http://www.syracuse.com/news/index.ssf/2014/03/liberal_voice_of_syracuse_radio_george_kilpatrick_leaves_wsyr_after_20_years.html == Merchandising == In February 2009, Lonsberry coined the term FUBO and began selling T-shirts and other merchandise with the term at fubowear.com. This term, an acronym for the phrase \\"F-ck U Barack Obama\\", is often used on his radio show to express disgust with the actions and policies of the US President. He also promotes NOBO (NO Barack Obama) apparel and accessories. == Controversy, firing, rehiring, and latest firing == While Lonsberry was working as a talk show host for WHAM-Rochester in late 2003, an orangutan had temporarily escaped its cage in Rochester's Seneca Park Zoo. Lonsberry made the comment while monkey sounds played, \\"a monkey's loose up at the zoo again --and he's running for county executive.\\" He was insinuating that Mayor Johnson was unfit for the position. The two candidates were Maggie A. Brooks, a white woman who was then county clerk, and William A. Johnson, Jr., a black man who was then mayor. Lonsberry never mentioned the three-term mayor by name. WHAM radio said in a statement that \\"although Mr. Lonsberry expressed a willingness to change, it became obvious to us that he is not embracing diversity.\\"(http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1355/is_18_104/ai_110076584). Lonsberry was later fired from WHAM-AM for the remarks (but not from KNRS, both Clear Channel radio stations). When WHAM ratings in his time slot plunged, he was rehired following completion of sensitivity training. During his absence, many fans of his Rochester show boycotted the station and its sponsors until he was returned to the airwaves. On June 16, 2010, Lonsberry was fired from KNRS in Salt Lake City, Utah, where he'd hosted show weekdays between 5 AM to 9 AM MT for a decade. In Lonsberry's daily web column, he indicated that the station attributed his firing to his lower listener ratings following the introduction of the Portable People Meter. Lonsberry also suggests that his opposition to Republican primary candidate for US Senate, Mike Lee, a Utah-based attorney whose employer, a law firm whose clients includes one of KNRS's advertisers, may have been a factor in his firing. Lonsberry writes: :Of course, being suspicious is my stock-in-trade, and the timing of my termination and the stand I‚Äôve been taking on the looming senatorial primary and the fact I‚Äôve been opposing a candidate who made $600,000 from one of our largest advertisers last year, does make me wonder. Strings get pulled in the real world, and politics is hardball, and our program‚Äôs effort helped tip the nominating convention, so it‚Äôs not impossible that I lost my job in Salt Lake so that somebody else could get a job in Washington. Lonsberry vocally supported Mike Lee's primary-election opponent, Tim Bridgewater, a businessman and former Chairman of the Utah County Republican Party.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHQvcK19kIA The Bridgewater Campaign subsequently pulled all its ads from radio station KNRS. Interest in Lonsberry's firing from KNRS was high with over a thousand reader comments‚Äîseveral times the normal response‚Äîto Lonsberry's weekday blog. Lonsberry fans also started a grassroots listener campaign with the objective of restoring Lonsberry to his position (www.bringbobbacktoutah.com). Lonsberry returned to the Utah airwaves in February 2011 on radio station KLO 1430AM. On December 20, 2011, Lonsberry announced that he was doing his last morning broadcast on KLO due to an upcoming schedule change at WHAM. Lonsberry no longer broadcasts in the Utah radio market. While the content of Lonsberry's Rochester and Salt Lake City shows were politically and socially conservative, his approach in two broadcast markets differed due to local content and interests. The former Salt Lake City show was more genteel and included frequent religious references whereas the Rochester show is more raucous and occasionally risqu√©. (On the WHAM show, Lonsberry frequently mentions his affinity for women's breasts.) Lonsberry broadcasts his Rochester show from the WHAM studio, although he occasionally originates the program from his home. In November of 2019, Lonsberry was ridiculed online after comparing the word ‚Äúboomer‚Äù to the N-word. The phrase \\"OK boomer\\" had been used on the video sharing app TikTok by Generation Z and millennials to show their resentment toward baby boomers. Dictionary.com chimed in on the controversy, noting that \\"Boomer is an informal noun referring to a person born during a baby boom, especially one born in the U.S. between 1946 and 1965\\" and \\"The n-word is one of the most offensive words in the English language.\\" == Author == Lonsberry is a former columnist for the Rochester Times-Union. Lonsberry currently writes a weekday column published on his own website. Lonsberry has also been published in The Washington TimesColumn in the Washington Times and on the National Rifle Association's website, nra.com. Lonsberry has authored five books: *A Various Language () *Baghdad Christmas () *Hopiland Christmas () *Santa Monica Christmas (). *A Joseph Avenue Christmas () == Religion == Lonsberry was an missionary for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) on the Navajo and Hopi reservations in the American Southwest. Lonsberry was excommunicated from the church for bad conduct some time before 2001. Although less frequently than on KNRS, he continues to discuss religious topics on his WHAM show and still considers himself an adherent of Mormonism. He has written in defense of the veracity of the Book of MormonLonsberry and of Mormonism's place in broader Christianity. Lonsberry avoids publicly discussing his former membership status in the LDS Church but has often discussed topics related to the church during his radio shows.Famous Mormons in the Media These religious discussions were frequent on the former Salt Lake City show but are discussed much less often with the Rochester and Syracuse area audiences. As of 2019, Lonsberry's Twitter bio states that he has since reconciled with and rejoined the LDS Church. == References == * Talk show webpage for WHAM * Talk show webpage for KNRS == External links == * Web column * Personal biography Category:Latter Day Saints from New York (state) Category:American radio personalities Category:American television talk show hosts Category:American male writers Category:Living people Category:1959 births Category:People excommunicated by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Category:People from Canisteo, New York Category:American Mormon missionaries in the United States ","title":"Bob Lonsberry"},{"id":"20154172","text":"The 11th (Craigavon) Battalion, Ulster Defence Regiment was formed from companies of the 2nd Battalion Ulster Defence Regiment (2 UDR) and the 3rd Battalion Ulster Defence Regiment in 1972.

It was thought this was because the former county adjutant was discouraging his men from recruitment with the UDR.Potter p. 29 It also had, along with 7 UDR the highest percentage of Catholic recruits,Potter p. 57 with two becoming Permanent Staff Instructors.Potter, chapter 4 The company commander (OC) of C Company, (Newry), 3 UDR, had been OC of the disbanded TA company of the Royal Irish Fusiliers in the town and was pleased to see that virtually all of his TA soldiers were on parade, in the TA Centre, in exactly the same drill hall as they had previously used, for the first night of the new regiment. Many of these men were Catholic ex- servicemen. The OC noted there were also some former B Specials in the room and observed they did not initially associate with the others ‚Äì not on the grounds of religion but because the former TA soldiers all knew each other socially and sat together on canteen breaks whereas the former specials kept to their own group of comrades, but within a week both had melded together.Potter p. 35 ===Appointment of NCOs and officers=== The appointment of Non-commissioned officers (NCOs) was carried out in a variety of ways. In most cases, men were selected who had previously held non-commissioned rank in any of the armed forces or the USC. In C Company, Newry, many of the recruits had formerly been soldiers in the local territorial company of the Royal Irish Fusiliers, including the company commander. It was a simple matter to appoint men who had previously been his NCOs and he supplemented these with former sergeants from the USC. The filling of senior NCO posts in this manner did have a drawback in that many men of comparatively young ages who had considerable years of service before retirement or promotion created a \\"promotion block\\"Potter pp. 34‚Äì35 Many of the men had previously served with the armed forces and, as a result, were given rank immediately. Two of these were made Permanent Staff Instructors and one was appointed as Company Sergeant Major of C Company, Newry.Potter p. 58 The second in command of the battalion, the most senior appointment for a part-time soldier, with the rank of major, was also Catholic. This led to a complaint from the chairman of the Ulster Special Constabulary association who claimed that: in 3 UDR preference for promotion and appointments was being given to Catholics. This wasn't true of course. In some battalions where former special constables were in the majority, they were the ones being given a promotion and it could equally have been claimed in those cases that Protestants were given an unfair advantage. Ultimately, the policy was to promote those with experience. ==History== Along with the other 6 original battalions, 3 UDR commenced operational duties on 1 April 1970. Battalion Headquarters were located at Ballykinler Army Base which is also home to Abercorn Barracks where another British unit would be on a 2-year posting.Ballykinler Bases were also located in Kilkeel and Rathfriland. It was the first battalion to be raised. The first commanding officer (CO) was Lt Col Desmond Woods MC and bar.Lt-Col Desmond Woods - Telegraph Woods had won the MC with the Royal Ulster Rifles in Palestine during 1938, at that time he was the youngest holder of the award. He won his bar to the MC in Italy in 1944 Prior to his appointment as Commanding officer of 3 UDR he had been the County Commandant of the Ulster Special Constabulary for County Down from 1958. In his earliest days as CO, Woods made it clear that he welcomed Catholics into his battalion. This was not welcomed by his former adjutant from the B Specials who started a campaign to discourage former specials from joining. This man had been retained in the USC after the force was disbanded in order to ensure that all weapons were handed in, so he still had ample contact with the men in order to make his case.Potter p. 28 The first training major (TISO - training int and security officer) was Major GJ Entwistle, Royal Regiment of Fusiliers, who was sent to the old hutted camp at Ballykinlar.Potter p. 27 Part of his job was to find accommodation for the various companies of the new battalion. Where possible accommodation was sought in army bases although the old Ulster Special Constabulary platoon huts were vacant and available. To have used those would have attracted criticism from people who were already claiming that the UDR was the B Specials under a new name. In 1989 the battalion recorded over 900,000 man-hours of duty and the notable success of, in a joint operation with the Royal Ulster Constabulary, discovering a \\"highly sophisticated\\" arms factory which turned out homemade submachine guns for a loyalist terror group.Ryder p. 191 ==Company structure== Only one of the USC Sub-District Commandants was able to join the battalion as the others were too old.

Czech students arrive from the 7th class in primary school, and so the ECP is a 6-year school. It is a member of the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference. The College has around 370 students, of whom around 70% are Czech, and 30% from foreign countries, such as those in Eastern Asia, Russia, Eastern Europe, among others. ==History== In 1990 the suggestion was made at a meeting of British diplomats with President Vaclav Havel to set up a new school in Prague similar to the Prague English Grammar School, which had flourished intermittently in Prague between 1927 and 1954. In 1992 a new charity, The English College Foundation, began raising funds. The intention was to found a secondary school which would provide an academic education on British lines, meet the intense demand for English and contribute to the development of Czechoslovakia's emerging democracy. The project was endorsed by the three main political parties in the UK, and President Havel and the Prince of Wales agreed to be Joint Patrons of the English College. By 1994 a suitable building had been found, conveniently situated next to the metro station in Vysocany twelve minutes from the centre of Prague, and the school opened its doors in September that year. Following the death of Vaclav Havel in 2011, Karel Schwarzenberg agreed to become its Czech Patron. The College is governed by a volunteer Board of Governors drawn from the Czech Republic and the UK and is a not-for-profit organisation. ==Campus== The College is situated at the metro station Vysoƒçansk√° and near a shopping centre with a food court. The school buildings include specialised science laboratories, an art centre and music room, a computer centre, a well- equipped library, a multi purpose hall and an all-weather outdoor area. ==Curriculum== The curriculum consists of two leading, internationally- recognised educational programmes, the IGCSE and International Baccalaureate (IB). Along with completing the IB Diploma in the sixth year, the students also obtain the Czech Maturita, which is the legal document representing the completion of Czech secondary education, and allows them to apply to Czech universities. Czech language is present as a part of the Maturita although for non-Czech speakers, a programme without Czech is also available. ==Extracurricular activities== The College provides numerous in-school and out-of-school activities including rock-climbing, chess and poetry slams and many opportunities to become involved in charity fundraising and voluntary activities. ==References== COBIS - Council of British International Schools https://www.cobis.org.uk/uploaded/COBIS_-_Our_Schools/Inspection_reports/BSO- English-College-in-Prague.pdf IB - International Baccalaureate https://www.ibo.org/programmes/find-an-ib-school/ibaem/t/the-english-college- in-prague----anglicke-gymnazium/ HMC - The Headmasters' & Headmistresses' Conference https://www.hmc.org.uk/schools/the-english-college-in-prague/ British Chamber Of Commerce https://www.britishchamber.cz/business/english-college-in-prague-anglicke- gymnazium-o-p-s/ Category:Schools in Prague Category:Educational institutions established in 1994 Category:International schools in the Czech Republic Category:International Baccalaureate schools in the Czech Republic Category:1994 establishments in the Czech Republic Prague ","title":"English College in Prague"},{"id":"20154249","text":"The Suntop Homes, also known under the early name of The Ardmore Experiment, were quadruple residences located in Ardmore, Pennsylvania, and based largely upon the 1935 conceptual Broadacre City model of the minimum houses. The design was commissioned by Otto Tod Mallery of the Tod Company in 1938 in an attempt to set a new standard for the entry-level housing market in the United States and to increase single-family dwelling density in the suburbs. In cooperation with Frank Lloyd Wright, the Tod Company secured a patent for the unique design, intending to sell development rights for Suntops across the country. SunTop in perspective, Patent D114,204, ventilating windows are opened. The first (and only) of the four buildings planned for Ardmore was built in 1939, with the involvement of Wright's master builder Harold Turner, after initial construction estimates far surpassed the project budget set by the Tod Company. There were several reasons that construction of the other three planned units did not move forward, including the escalation of the World War, high construction costs and later, protests by local residents against multi-family housing in the neighborhood. Fire damaged or destroyed two of the four original dwellings. The first was badly damaged only a few years after construction was completed, and remained as a burned-out shell for several decades before it was restored by a private owner using Wright's original plans and early concepts. A second residence was lost to fire in the 1970s during an interior restoration, but was rebuilt with extensive changes to the plan and ceiling heights. The carports of several residences have been enclosed to provide more interior space. Later projects modeled on the quadruple dwelling unit included the Cloverleaf Quadruple Housing project (1941/42) for the U.S. Government on a tract near Pittsfield, Massachusetts. A change in housing administration and complaints from local architects that they, not an \\"outsider,\\" should design the project, prevented construction. ==Floorplan and features== The Ardmore Experiment was designed so each building had four individual Usonian dwellings around a central point, in a radial pinwheel plan. The living spaces of each unit were stacked vertically instead of horizontally. This is a departure, because horizontal arrangement was typical of Wright's residential work at the time. However, most of this work was for wealthy families. A single floor is more comfortable, but more expensive in land. The arrangement combined the usual suburban front and rear yards into single outdoor spaces or gardens. In planning the initial Tod Company development, Wright arranged four buildings (16 dwellings) asymmetrically on the lot so that no unit's view directly faced another (or any existing neighbor). This maximized privacy and shared green space at the same time. The prototype Suntop building has four separate quadrants. Each quadrant is an individual dwelling designed for , stacked in four floors. The dwellings are separated by fireproof, soundproof brick walls. The walls cut off all sight lines from any part of any dwelling to any part of the other dwellings in the building. The floor-plans reduce the effects of noise by placing a dwelling's daytime activities (e.g. kitchen, bath, etc.) on one side of each wall, and the adjacent dwelling's night time activities (bedrooms, etc.) on the other side of the same wall. The walls also contain all vents to the roof, including the heater and fireplace chimneys. The barrier walls go below grade, dividing a single, small, economical central excavation into four small basement heater rooms. A walk-through logically starts outside the combined driveway and entrance walkway, which lead to the carport. (In the patent drawing, the carport opening is below the narrower, second-story parapet.) From the entrance, the planked parapets of the balcony and terrace help privacy by cutting off sight-lines to the windows of the master bedroom and penthouse bedrooms on the roof terrace. (This is why those windows are not visible in the patent drawing.) The planked parapets shade the garden and walk. The parapets also make each unit's balcony and terrace safe even for small children. They also reinforce each other visually. In some drawings, planters line the parapets, with greenery spilling down them. Owners liked the parapet design well-enough to adopt it for garden walls. The balcony shelters the carport's entranceway and its pedestrian entrance on the inside right. The door in the carport provides access to the street, the carport and basement with one door. Combining the sidewalk and driveway permits more garden space, and also reduces land and construction costs. Inside the carport, the left wall is the left barrier wall. In the carport's back are some cabinets and the two-flight stair to the basement. It leads to a small below-grade furnace room under the rear floor of the carport. Wright considered basements \\"waste\\" so this is an interesting variation from other Usonian houses. It may be an attempt to maximize the convenient living space by placing utilities out of the way. Utilities are literally centralised for all four units, reducing piping. The floorplan could utilize only electric, oil or gas heat: No coal chute or bin is shown. However, coal heat was common at the time. With minor design changes, including a fuel bin and chute, the heater below the carport permits a vendor to deliver solid fuels by gravity. The basement heater room is below habitable areas, separated from them by masonry walls and two floors, reducing fire risks. The basement is also suitable for a storm shelter. Its walls are bearing walls, it is below grade, and the stair leading to it opens to a barrier wall, protecting the basement entrance from wind-borne projectiles. Like most Usonian houses, Suntop utilizes radiant hydronic heating in the first-floor slab, with radiators in upper rooms. Gravity convection efficiently circulates heated water to the living areas. In each dwelling, the heater room and its water-heater is also directly under the second floor bathroom, and near the second floor kitchen. This can enable instant-on hot water, at some cost in fuel to keep return hot-water loops warm. Wright even designed custom cedar radiator covers for Suntop. Returning to the carport, the main pedestrian entrance is sheltered just inside the right side of the ground-floor carport. Passing in, on the left the three habitation levels are joined by a single four-flight staircase. It connects the main pedestrian entrance on the first floor, the second floor's mezzanine, kitchen, bath and bedrooms and the third floor's bedrooms, and roof terrace. The upper levels wrap around the stairs. The stairs separate private spaces. The pedestrian entrance leads directly to the outside rim of the first-floor's large living room. The entrance faces the dramatic two-story-tall corner window. It dramatically brings the garden inside. The walls of the living room are lined with built-in cedar closets, a fireplace, padded seating, book- shelves and a table. The window has a corner niche on its outside. In some drawings, a small vertical tree (an Italian cypress or small Lombardy poplar) is in a planter there, and seems inside the room. The living room can be finished with small sectional sofas or chairs to make conversational niches around the fireplace, window corner and, in the corner opposite the entrance, the library corner and its table. These naturally form social spaces for entertainment and family. Two-story walk-through ventilation windows open to the garden at the sides of the large corner window. These windows open between the conversational areas and both of them open opposite to the kitchen on the mezzanine. The library corner is in the quiet corner opposite the entrance. Its built-in table or desk is next to the corner window, with a built-in sofa under the bookshelves and room for chairs on two sides of the table. Modern owners extended the built-in sofa for the entire wall, from the library corner to the fireplace under the mezzanine. Wright's trademark Usonian fireplace is two-sided, a square on the inside corner of the first-floor living room. The fireplace's brick matches the exposed brick of the barrier wall and the adjacent bearing wall (the rear of the carport is behind it). The fireplace economically uses the corner masonry for its chimney. Since the chimney is mostly in heated areas, the chimney will remain warm, and draw in winter without a backdraft. In the upper stories, the chimney and other ventilation ducts (including the furnace, water-heater, room vents, kitchen and bathroom drain vents) are built into the barrier wall. Passing by the cedar closets, back to the house entrance, a short two-flight staircase goes up to the second floor. The lower flight's staircase is over the basement stairs, which open to the carport. The upper flight's staircase space is used and concealed by cedar closets facing the living room. The stairs go to the mezzanine's dining loft. Against the second-story's barrier wall (to the right of the patent drawing), a galley kitchen faces the dining area in the mezzanine, A portion of the mezzanine's ceiling is contiguous with the living room ceiling, but half of the mezzanine has a ceiling a couple of feet (2/3m) higher. This clerestory line joins to the upward stairwell. Clerestory windows in this gap light and ventilate the kitchen's work area, bedroom hall opening, central mezzanine, and the stairwell upward. The clerestory windows open onto the roof terrace. Wright hoped that when the windows were open, a mother working in the kitchen might be able to supervise children on the roof terrace, and vice versa if the mother were on the terrace. The crowded mezzanine excuses its tight spaces with a cozy nautical flavor: This is from a combination of the galley kitchen, exposed, finished joinery, overhead clerestory, planked ceiling, wood paneling, and built-in dining table. Some owners noticed this and emphasized it with their decor. The mezzanine opens down to the living room and its dramatic windows. A dining booth is built into the outside corner of the mezzanine, overlooking the corner window of the living room and its entrance- way. The booth's inward-facing seat is the inner side of the mezzanine's parapet. In Wright's drawings, the outer face of the mezzanine's parapet has planters with greenery visible from the outer living room. These would freshen the air, and green complements the red and brown of Wright's materials. Plants here would even be visible outside, through the large windows, and would unify the garden outside with the garden inside. A decorative, Art Deco Usonian lamp lights the mezzanine's dining-table. It's near the outer corner of the mezzanine, at the level of the living-room ceiling. It lights the mezzanine and kitchen much as the clerestories would. It can serve as a nightlight for the mezzanine, its kitchen, the second story hall, the first-floor's living room entranceway and the outer living room. From the outside, it is clearly visible for long distances through both sides of the two-story living-room window, to welcome guests and family. Its light can't reach or disturb any of the four bedrooms. (Inhabitants have related humorous stories about the difficulty of changing its light-bulbs.) The inner wall of the mezzanine opens to a hall. Turning right leads first to a linen closet, then past a corner to the left, to help preserve privacy, the hall reaches an enclosed commode and bathroom. To the left from the mezzanine, behind the stairwell's wall, a short hall leads to the nursery and the master bedroom. The second-floor nursery is to the inside of the master bedroom. Placing the nursery next to the master bedroom permits parents easy access at night. When entering the master bedroom, one faces the outside windows and door to the second-floor parapet over the carport. To the right are built-in twin beds, and shelves or dressers. A changing-table or desk is to the left. Further left, beyond the changing table is the door to a walk-in-closet. The closet is over the stairs. The master bedroom and nursery are over the carport, aiding privacy. The master bedroom and closet also have outside windows. Furniture can be lifted from the outside driveway to the parapet and into the bedroom. Lighting and ventilating the inner rooms of the second floor (nursery, bath and commode) may have challenged Wright, because they don't adjoin exterior walls or the roof. A 6-foot-square (approx. 2m-square) central light well reaches from the roof skylight through the third floor to light and ventilate the bath. The nursery's wall with the master bedroom aligns with the upper penthouse wall, and has clerestory windows high on the walls, facing the roof terrace. The nursery therefore has a ceiling two feet (80cm) higher than the master bedroom. Inhabitants report that the commode, closets and other parts of the inner rooms are also lit and ventilated by clerestories to the light well or roof terrace, concealed in built-in joinery. The second-story master bedroom is designed for privacy. It has no shared floors or walls with spaces that are inhabited at the same time. It's around a corner and down a short hall from the dining mezzanine. Closets separate it from the nursery. The staircase and walk-in wardrobe separate it from the dining mezzanine and upper living room. It's on the \\"night\\" side of the barrier wall, opposite the empty wall over the library corner of the adjacent unit. It's over the carport, and below the roof terrace. It has a window and door to the small balcony over the carport and entrance, but the parapet stops sight lines from the yard and driveway. On the third \\"penthouse\\" story, the L-shaped outside terrace wraps around the penthouse. Wright's drawings show clothes-lines and drying clothes on the terrace, sunlit, yet protected from tampering. The planked parapet of the terrace prevents views from the garden or driveway to the terrace, clotheslines, penthouse or clerestory windows. Some drawings show plants hanging from the parapet. The terrace is also the roof of the living room. The upper flights of stairs lead up from the internal mezzanine on the second floor to a tiny hall on the outer corner of the penthouse. The stairwell is lit by clerestory windows to the terrace, and large windows in the corner of the penthouse hall. The hall windows survey the roof terrace. The hall leads right to the two bedrooms and the terrace door. The larger bedroom, for guests or older children, is over the kitchen, against the right barrier wall. The smaller bedroom, suitable for young children, is over the nursery. The bedrooms' plans show large windows facing the terrace with closets, built-in twin or bunk beds, night-stands and shelves. The closets adjoin the second- floor bathroom's lightwell, permitting natural light in the closets and on two sides of the bedrooms. The windows of the bedrooms are on different sides of the penthouse, making them private from each other. The third-story roof terrace's outside door opens from the penthouse hall to a two-foot (60 cm) stair descending to the outside terrace. At the base of the penthouse, this elevation contains clerestory windows from the third-story terrace to the internal second-story nursery, stairwell and central mezzanine. ==Criticism== Two dwellings (half of all that were ever built) have burned. The design fails modern fire safety regulations. Drawings show only a door in the back of the carport to keep a car's heavy fuel vapors away from open flames in the below- grade furnace room. Fires apparently stopped after the carports were converted to living space. The design might economically address fire safety by eliminating the basement, saving excavation costs. Modern appliances would fit on a rear shelf in the carport. A simple storm cellar could be optional. Sprinklers are also inexpensive, offset by reduced fire insurance. Construction was expensive because of Wright's obsession with high-finish joinery. Wright's luxury materials, cantilevers and clerestories are also inherently costly. Textured cement is a Wright material. Textured tilt-up concrete barrier walls might be possible, with some loss of amenities. 3D-printed masonry on a steel frame might economically build almost all amenities, including cantilevers, clerestories, built-in furniture and parapets. Printed built-ins could utilize catalog fittings and upholstery. The floor plan was for commodity housing. Modern owners complained about the small size of the house and the small bedrooms. Some owners converted the carports to living space. One converted it from a four bedroom house (in plan) to two bedrooms, and added a bath. Many modern owners would expect a commode or bath on each floor, possibly even for each bedroom. The second and third floor's dining area, kitchen and bedrooms can be uncomfortable for older adults to reach. (To be fair, it was designed for young families.) Groceries had to be carried upstairs. A dumbwaiter, laundry and garbage chutes would help. The needed space might be had by using circular stairs. A redesign for older adults might \\"unscrew\\" the floors, putting one apartment on each floor, rotated for privacy, reclaiming the stairwell-area for bathrooms or bedrooms, yet using the same land. This loses much privacy, natural light and the dramatic twelve-foot ceiling of the great room. Wright's trademark flat roof leaked. The problem was not completely fixed until modern roofing materials solved the issue, at some expense. A low-density reinforced concrete roof with a few percent of rise and a wax or asphalt infusion could hip the roof, balcony and terrace, reducing leaks, yet leave the terrace usable. The insulation (e.g. by pumice aggregate) of the low-density concrete would reduce condensation on rafters (i.e. dry rot), ice-dams on the roof (leaks), and cooling problems that are normally reduced by a vented attic. The outside design would appear unchanged: The parapet could conceal the slight hip and thicker roof. (Wright designed flat roofs to avoid the \\"waste\\" of attics.) Wright expressed concern about ventilation in this design, because each dwelling only has two open sides. A modern design might utilize zoned air circulation, with a heater, whole-house fan and air-conditioning. The patent drawing shows two-story ventilation windows edging the corner window, but modern photos show single-story glass garden doors on the first floor, with screened, tilt-in upper windows. The mezzanine's clerestories should exhaust hot air too, but they are in the wind-shadows of the barrier walls, preventing both breezes and Bernoulli suction. They are small, preventing convection, and their mechanism is high and may be hard to reach. A breeze across the chimney should draw air into the fireplace, but the damper might too often be closed. Also the chimney may reach only the top of the barrier wall, and it may be too short to reach the fast outside air needed for the Bernoulli effect. Double- insulating the dramatic windows and glass doors would reduce heating and cooling costs. Correct solar design of the terrace's shade line on the windows would keep the sun out in the summer, yet permit solar heat in the winter. North-facing units might be solar-heated with mirrors on the garden fence. A solar roof on the penthouse could reduce the cost of electricity for air- conditioning or a heat-pump. A hinge and latch could make it easy to change the Usonian lamp's light bulbs. ==References== * Storrer, William Allin. The Frank Lloyd Wright Companion.

It was surveyed in 1961 by G. E. Wilford of the Malaysian Geological Survey, who predicted that Mulu would yield many more caves in the future. The cave, which is also known as Gua Payau or Gua Rusa by the local Penan and Berawan people, is said to have received its name because of the deer that go there to lick salt-bearing rocksTsen, 1993 and shelter themselves. ==Description and survey history== The cave was extensively mapped by a Royal Geographical Society expedition in 1978. They produced measurements of wide and high in one section that passed through the mountain for a distance of . The next survey in 2009 increased the acknowledged passage length to and connected Lang Cave, another show cave within the park, to the Deer Cave System. This survey, made by the Hoffman Institute at Western Kentucky University, revealed the maximum cross-sectional area to be in the large southern passage. This was documented at 169 m wide with a ceiling height of . The northern passage registered the greatest ceiling height at with a cross-sectional width of . The main entrance of Deer Cave was measured at . ==Geologic history== Main passage inside Deer Cave, showing waterfalls cascading from the ceiling over high. An explanation of the cave's formation is strongly interconnected with the geological history of the island of Borneo itself. Between 40,000,000 BC and 20,000,000 BC, a thick layer of sedimentary rocks known as limestone, composed largely of compressed sea shells, developed in lagoons created by coral reefs. The movement of the Asian and Australian tectonic plates caused the crust to buckle and elevate the land once more, giving birth to the island of Borneo and the Mulu mountains, around five million years ago. Since then, the landscape was hacked by constant erosion from precipitations and winds. The mountain‚Äôs surface is composed mostly of limestone, which dissolves when in contact with fresh water, and thus has been slowly sculpted into a karst. Rainwater also infiltrates the porous sedimentary rocks after going through the soil and progressively dissolves the limestone, widening the pores and cracks and creating caves of impressive dimensions such as the Deer Cave. This natural process, which is still working, will cause the cave to widen even more in the future. ==Access and tourism== Bat observatory in front of the Deer Cave entrance. Tourism access to the cave (and to the entire park) was opened in 1984. The landscape attracts around 25,000 visitors from countries all over the world every year. To access Deer Cave, one must first enter the Gunung Mulu National Park, by way of Kota Kinabalu or the nearby city of Miri. Malaysian Airlines operates flights of approximately 30 minutes from Miri to Mulu. The park can also be reached by boat from Marudi, but a special booking must be made since no regular boat covers that area. Access to Deer Cave from the National Park entrance is via a plank walkway which passes through regions of lowland and limestone tropical rainforest with immense trees and limestone outcrops. This walk is considered an additional attraction to visitors as it takes them through the rainforest (of about )Malaysia at Asean-tourism.com and by an ancient Penan Burial Cave. Some artificial lighting is provided within the cave, but flashlights are recommended for personal use in darker areas. Visitor attention may be drawn to a specific formations - unique stalagmites and also to a specific formation near the cave entrance which bears a distinct resemblance to the profile of Abraham Lincoln. To the northeast the cave opens into the so-called Garden of Eden, an approximately wide, circular depression encircled with tall limestone walls from three sides and a mountain slope from the fourth. The Garden of Eden is a karst valley or sinkhole with a volume of 150 million cubic meters, its bottom is covered with rainforest. ==Fauna== In 2008, Prince Albert II of Monaco visited the Gunung Mulu National Park to launch a new camera system as part of the Bat Observatory, which is located near the entrance of the Deer Cave. Known as the Bat Cam, the surveillance technology allows visitors and scientists to observe approximately 3 million bats (over 30 species) that live inside the Deer Cave without affecting their habitat or habits, providing a valuable tool for the study of cave fauna.Mulu Park Batcam A viewing area has also been built outside, below the cave entrance, so that visitors can view the nightly \\"bat exodus\\" as they exit the cave and stream away in tight formation. At least 12 bat species are found in Deer Cave.Hall, Leslie S. The Magic of Mulu.

In 1970 the first issue was published by an anarchist community using an occupied building in Oslo as their editorial office. Since then it has been Norway‚Äôs only wide-reaching publication rooted in anarchism. This makes Gateavisa not only Norway‚Äôs oldest radical countercultural publication but also one of the world‚Äôs oldest continuously published anarchist magazines. The magazine covers everything from fine arts, music and pop cultural matters to serious news topics and academics. Historically it's one of the leading sources when it comes to providing a foundational and radical critique of the Norwegian society. Gateavisa is known for its provoking satire, unorthodox journalism, underground comics, short stories, and poetry. Society, culture, and history have been viewed with a radical non-affiliated lens rooted in the anarchist tradition. New subcultures and cultural expressions have often first been introduced to the public through the pages of Gateavisa. Radical ideas and movements national as well as international have been presented and provided with context and history before being interpreted and critiqued. You will find interviews with whomever the staff finds interesting or funny. It may be anyone from activists, a criminal, a local original, freak or vandal, but there will also be interviews with artists, musicians, writers, and thinkers both national and international. The rejection of moralism and censorship has been central since Gateavisas founding. The publication has consistently been opposed to drug prohibition and any form of kink-shaming and oppression of sexual minorities, as well as capital, power and naturally, the police. Gateavisa has always advocated in favour of prostitutes, S&M;, porn actors (but against their exploitation) and pornography. All of the publication‚Äôs different adorations have regarded all and any authority and hierarchy as suspicious and therefore one of Gateavisas enduring themes have always been a critique of power, and a pragmatic scepticism regarding all formal institutions. ==References * Official website * World Cat info * Category:1970 establishments in Norway Category:Anarchist works Category:Biannual magazines Category:Magazines established in 1970 Category:Magazines published in Norway Category:Norwegian-language magazines Category:Political magazines published in Norway Category:Magazines published in Oslo Category:Monthly magazines published in Norway ","title":"Gateavisa"},{"id":"20154375","text":"Paris 1313: The Mystery of Notre-Dame Cathedral is a video game released in 2001, developed by Dramaera and is a co-production between Index+, Canal+ Multimedia, France Telecom Multimedia and Micro√Øds.

The 3D adventure game was developed by Cryo Interactive Entertainment, and was jointly published by Cryo, Canal+ Multimedia and the R√©union des Mus√©es Nationaux. It was followed in 2001 by Versailles II: Testament of the King. The game revolves around Lalande, a young valet de chambre, who is called by Alexandre Bontemps in the early morning of the summer solstice 1685 after a strange pamphlet is discovered (which at the bottom figures a title of Aesop's fables: 'the frogs and Jupiter'), written by a schemer who threatens to set fire to the castle, all-the-while littering it with satirical pamphlets and clues which, if correctly pieced together could save the castle from its potential fate; the player has until nightfall to investigate the castle and surrounding areas. Versailles 1685 was a commercial success, with sales of 500,000 units in Europe alone by 2000. ==Plot== After attending the king's awakening, Lalande starts his search in the antechambers. Under a large painting \\"Supper at Ema√ºs\\" he finds a small key in one of four pots. After eavesdropping on a conversation between Hardouin Mansart and Jean Racine he stumbles across Charles Lebrun, who asks him to look for his lost painting sketches which he needs later in the morning. In a downstairs dressing room, he finds a pair of scissors and a pamphlet in which Lebrun is satirized, with a peculiar hint lying at the bottom of the page. Upstairs he manages to open a sealed chest in an upper secluded blue boy bedroom, which exposed reads another of Aesop's titles: 'the hens and the chicks'. While delivering an errand for Bontemps he is given a second pamphlet by the queen's usher, this time dispraising the royal family, with a series of numbers at the bottom. Lalande reports to Bontemps, then finds a key inside a cupboard, which he uses to open a buffet where he retrieves Lebrun's sketches. In one of the conversations in the Hall of Mirrors, an unknown courtier (in talk with the princess of Conti) is alluded to, potentially referred to as 'the marquis de Scaparella'. Lalande finds Lebrun in the war salon who, to his letdown tells him they are not his sketches. Lalande doubles back and is intercepted by the king's son who tells him that a deceitful drawing lay on top of the pile. Lebrun is reassured, thanks him and hands him another sketch from the pile which he once more claims isn't his. In front lies an artist's palette (from which the first pamphlet alluded to one of the colours), prevalent in the king's salon. Lalande reaches for a golden-coloured paintbrush and passes it over the sketch, whereby a third Aesop title is revealed: 'the birds and the kite'. After attending the start of the noon mass, Lalande finds himself in the grand appartement, where he stands opposite a restricted \\"chamber of secrets\\" to which the guard tells him he can only enter with Bontemps' written permission. For the while, he makes his way through the cue of apartments, browsing for clues along the way. Running adjacently leftwards to the last three rooms is the minstrel's gallery (where Jean-Baptiste Lully) can be seen at work and that can only by accessed via a discreet locked doorway in the Apollo salon, which he manages to open by retrieving the key from a swiss guard at the bottom of the ambassador's staircase. Going left, he spots the unknown courtier inserting a key into a drawer across the Venus salon. In a partitions' booklet he remarks a scripture aimed at Lully, whom irritated, also remarks a particular writing style. Lalande implores him to decipher the hidden message - who agrees, for an errand in return. After two visits to Jean Racine (in talk with the marquise de Montespan above the ambassadors' fountain) - while having retrieved the second key and a third pamphlet along the way - Lully finishes the transcription, which reads: 'the mice and the hanging cat'. Lalande finds Bontemps in the courtyard, who grants him authorization to enter the chamber. Inside the small dark room stands a table with a set of medals (as mentioned in the second pamphlet - to which there is one exception) in the drawer, which he calks with a burin and paper picked up along the way. The king's brother lets him know that all medals bear carvings of Bourbon monarchs, except for Charles VIII - a Valois. On the medal is inscribed an inintelligible epigraph to which Lalande implores the aid of the marquis de Croissy. In the ministers' wing, Lalande is left the lengthy translation of the epigraph from the marquis' desk (on which also lies the map of a fort). Referring to the numbers at the bottom of the second pamphlet he selects the letters by order of occurrence, unraveling yet another of Aesop's titles: 'the head and the wolf'. Browsing through the hoard of bookshelves he retrieves a fourth pamphlet, discrediting the marquis de Louvois and Vauban (the defense minister) that also hints toward three other maps of forts hidden in Louvois' office. Covered by Bontemps, Lalande is able to seep inside, where he finds the names of three towns in a drawer and an embedded vault of which the three four-digit code lines each seem to correspond to an event associated to the towns. With a spyglass, Lalande heads for the Hall of Mirrors, where he manages to get a glimpse of two of the dates on the ceiling,.. The three maps inside the vault, superposed to the one in the first office reveal another Aesop title: 'the fox and the crane'. Heading back to Bontemps he is intercepted by Madame de Maintenon who hands him yet a fifth pamphlet (a cloze text on the king's religious policy). During the king's afternoon work session, Lalande seeks help from the Cardinal de Bouillon in the Grand appartement to fill in the gaps of the pamphlet (who manages to deduce ¬´ dragonnade ¬ª, a term employed by the Protestants to describe the harsh royal repression measures); Lalande makes his way down to the sacristy of the chapel (to the left at the bottom of the ambassadors' staircase) where he finds a third key in one of the drawers with a paper depicting the king healing scrofula; with the help of the P√®re Lachaise he manages to fill in the remaining gaps; the underlined word particles yield yet another of Aesop's titles: 'the file and the dragon'. Lalande now turns his attention toward the hint at the bottom of the third pamphlet... Shedding light in the Jupiter salon and using a ladder to reach the scaffolding (intended for earlier purposes) he sights a small box trapped in the chandelier. Perhaps his most arduous task now awaits him. Unable to reach it, he begs Bontemps for assistance who gives him a key granting access to the mechanical framework above. Tensely making his way up the staircase behind the Apollo salon he reaches the attic pathway (where he also notices further along a big, suspicious overhanging large box; too far out to reach) and actuates the pulley. The luster falls with a loud crash... Relieved of having avoided the worst he collects the box and finds a lengthy paper inside, with eight sets of instructions (no doubt that each one corresponds to the eight Aesop titles gathered hitherto) that also mentions the presence of four keys spread around the castle, the last one hidden in an orange tree. After receiving a raw chiding from Bontemps he is invited to join the promenade. Lalande is now in the orangery, earnestly in search of the fourth missing key, harrowing through the rows of orange pots, one by one... but all in vain. Conveying his disarray to Andr√© le N√¥tre, the gardener reassures him that other orange trees lye in the Hall of Mirrors. Lalande approaches the Bosquet d'Esope, a labyrinth containing ornate fountains with one of Aesop's many fables displayed underneath. The paper instructs the reader with an eightfold task of selecting one or more letters, each from a given line and position of occurrence. Proceeding by order of titles gathered throughout the day, Lalande is somewhat baffled by the senseless of the string of letters obtained. In the rotunda at the far end of the grove, he comes across the Duc du Maine, lying in discomfort who implores for help, Lalande doubles back to the apothecary, relieves the duke, then retrieves a map eliciting the correct path in which the labyrinth is designed to be ambled through. Back from square one, then proceeding accordingly, Lalande is gladdened to retrieve a meaningful message: \\"I am going away, but the State will always remain.\\" After a cordial outdoor supper, the courtiers and courtesans are escorted back to the castle at nightfall. After the women wish goodnight to his majesty, the sconce is handed as of custom to one of the visiting courtiers, the Marquis de Scaparella (who Lalande recognizes); to all's horror he sets the hearth of the antechamber alight and after bidding good evening, eludes his fellow courtiers... Lalande must act quickly to reach the bomb spotted earlier. He finds a ladle in the king's salon then harrows hurriedly through the remaining orange trees in the Hall of Mirrors. Managing to find the fourth and last key he dashes up the antechamber staircase, along the attic passageway. He manages to retrieve the bomb which he spotted earlier. Alleviated, he inserts the four keys and enters the phrase code... the bomb deactivates. Lalande is congratulated by his majesty - who offers him the role of ambassador. == Development == This gif shows a sample of the development process for each set. While the Ambassadors' Staircase was destroyed in 1752, the developers painstakingly reconstructed it using 800 documents from the archivists: R√©union des Mus√©es Nationaux and Textuel publishers. The set was modeled using 3D Studio 4, then maps and textures were plotted in consultation with the Curator of the Museum of Versailles. Next, characters were placed into the space according to the storyboards. Lastly, the lights were added, and the virtual cameras were placed for the computer to render. Through collaboration with the Museum of Versailles, the developers recreated the Palace of Versailles as it was during the reign of Louis XIV in computer-rendered form, a process that took over two years. == Reception == Versailles 1685 was a commercial success, and sold 150,000 units in its first few months of release. According to French newspaper Les √âchos, it sold 300,000 copies by late 1998. Cryo Interactive's marketing manager, Mattieu Saint-Dennis, reported 500,000 sales for Versailles in Europe alone by December 2000. Of this number, France accounted for 180,000 copies. Kipp Cheng of Entertainment Weekly praised the \\"exquisite\\" 3D environments.

It was headquartered at Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada, and operationally located at Tonopah Test Range Airport, Nevada. It was inactivated on 5 October 1989. The United States Air Force F-117A Stealth Fighter program began on 15 October 1979 with the activation of the Tactical Air Command 4450th Tactical Group (TG) at the Tonopah Test Range Airport, Nevada. The 4450th Tactical Group was a pathfinder unit, moving the F-117A from the research and development stage to becoming a fully operational weapons system. On 10 November 1988, the Air Force officially announced the F-117A's existence to the public, and set the 4450th on the road to inactivation. On 5 October 1989, its F-117A aircraft, equipment personnel and mission were transferred to the 37th Tactical Fighter Wing was transferred from George Air Force Base, California, to carry out the F-117's sensitive worldwide mission. ==History== In 1978, the Air Force awarded a full-scale development contract for the YF-117A Nighthawk to Lockheed Corporation's Advanced Development Projects. On 17 January 1981 the Lockheed test team at Groom Lake accepted delivery of the first full Scale Development (FSD) prototype #79-780, designated YF-117A.DREAMLAND: Fifty Years of Secret Flight Testing in Nevada By Peter W. Merlin At 6:05 a.m. on 18 June 1981, Lockheed Skunk Works test pilot Hal Farley lifted the nose of YF-117A #79-780 off the runway of Groom Lake. ===Origins=== FSD-1, later F-117A 79-10780 inside a hangar prior to the first flight of the Nighthawk, June, 1981. Meanwhile, Tactical Air Command (TAC) decided to set up a group-level organization to guide the F-117A to an initial operating capability. That organization became the 4450th Tactical Group (Initially designated \\"A Unit\\"), which officially activated on 15 October 1979 at Nellis AFB, Nevada. Its first home was an isolated corner of Nellis known as the Lake Mead Base, officially designated Nellis Area Two. Officially activated on 15 October 1979, by early 1980 a handful of officers and enlisted men recruited into the program and were told that they were laying the groundwork for a unit whose mission would be to run avionics tests and evaluations for A-7D Corsair II weapon systems. Eight A-7D aircraft were transferred from England AFB, Louisiana in June 1981, which was converting to the A-10 Thunderbolt II. The A-7s were given the \\"LV\\" tailcode (for Las Vegas) and had a dark purple/black paint motif. The aircraft were assigned nominally to the 57th Fighter Weapons Wing and in addition, the group acquired the prototype A-7K two-seat dual control trainer from Edwards AFB (73-1008) that had been converted from its original A-7D configuration in 1978. In doing so, the group became the only active-duty unit to fly the A-7K. The first order of business was to set up acceptance procedures for the aircraft and develop an A-7D training program.Pace, Steve (1992) F-117A Stealth Fighter, Aero Publishers; 1st edition The A-7 had been chosen as an interim trainer because its cockpit layout and avionics were considered similar to those in the F-117. It was also a single-seat attack fighter, as the F-117 programmed to be. Training demands, however, soon forced the 4450th to delegate initial A-7D training and checkouts to the Arizona Air National Guard 162d Fighter Wing at Tucson, which was responsible for training Air National Guard pilots in the aircraft. Pilots assigned to the 4450th required a minimum of 1,000 fighter hours, and nearly all of the initial cadre for the F-117 were A-7D pilots due to the similar flight characteristics of the A-7D and F-117. Initially pilots in the program were sent to the 152nd Fighter Squadron, Arizona Air National Guard at Tucson for a quick refresher course in A-7Ds that included academics, simulator time and six or seven flights to re- qualify them in the Corsair. When other fighter pilots began to be assigned, they were assigned to either a three or six-month course. depending on their experience in fighters. Two A-7D Corsair IIs of the 4450th TG Flying over Hoover Dam, 1986. Shown are 70‚Äì1006, the other being the 4450th TG Commander's aircraft These operations continued at Nellis until 15 October 1982 under the guise of an avionics test mission when the Corsairs were moved north to Tonopah Test Range Airport to provide a cover story for the increased activities at the airport.37th TFW History and Lineage of the F-117 Stealth Fighter Organizations Flying squadrons of the 4450th TG were the 4450th Tactical Squadron (Initially designated \\"I Unit\\") activated on 11 June 1981, and 4451st Tactical Squadron (Initially designated \\"P Unit\\") on 15 January 1983. The 4450th TS, stationed at Groom Lake, was the first F-117A squadron, while the 4451st TS was stationed at Nellis AFB and was equipped with A-7D Corsair IIs painted in a dark motif, tail coded \\"LV\\". Lockheed test pilots put the YF-117 through its early paces. A-7Ds was used for pilot training before any F-117A's had been delivered by Lockheed to Groom Lake, later the A-7D's were used for F-117A chase testing and other weapon tests at the Nellis Range 15 October 1982 is important to the program because on that date Major Alton C. Whitley, Jr. became the first 4450th TG pilot to fly the F-117A. Everyone aware of the top-secret flight waited with an expectancy reminiscent of the early space launches. Though Major Whitley could remember scrambling from an alert pad at night as a young lieutenant in South Vietnam, it is doubtful that he was any more keyed up in combat than he was on that night, sitting in an operational F-117A at the end of the runway. The flinty sparkle of the stars in the desert sky seemed to accentuate the vast blackness, reminding him that night operations were always scary. Finally cleared for takeoff, Major Whitley pushed the throttles forward and scanned the F-117's instruments for any warnings as the aircraft lumbered noisily down the runway. After passing the point of no return, he gripped the controls hard, willing the F-117 into the air. Then, as he climbed into the darkness, he thought about the small American flag he had stuffed into the pocket of his G-suit for this historic occasion. He would be the first Night Hawk to go aloft in an F-117. It would make a great story for his grandchildren. As far as Major Whitley could tell, his children might be grown before he could tell them about it. ===Baja Scorpions=== By early 1982, four more YF-117A airplanes were operating out of the southern end of the base, known as the \\"Southend\\" or \\"Baja Groom Lake.\\" After finding a large scorpion in their offices, the testing team (Designated \\"R Unit\\") adopted it as their mascot and dubbed themselves the \\"Baja Scorpions.\\" Testing of a series of ultra-secret prototypes continued at Groom Lake until mid-1981, when testing transitioned to the initial production of F-117 stealth fighters. The F-117s were moved to and from Groom Lake by C-5 under the cloak of darkness, in order to maintain program security. This meant that the aircraft had to be defueled, disassembled, cradled, and then loaded aboard the C-5 at night, flown to Lockheed, and unloaded at night before the real work could begin. Of course, this meant that the reverse actions had to occur at the end of the depot work before the aircraft could be reassembled, flight-tested, and redelivered, again under the cover of darkness. In addition to flight-testing, Groom performed radar profiling, F-117 weapons testing, and was the location for training of the first group of frontline USAF F-117 pilots. Production FSD airframes from Lockheed were shipped to Groom Lake for acceptance testing. As the Baja Scorpions tested the aircraft with functional check flights and L.O. verification, the operational airplanes were then transferred to the 4450th TG.Baja Scorpions The R-Unit was inactivated on 30 May 1989. Upon inactivation the unit was replaced by Detachment 1, 57th Fighter Weapons Wing (FWW). In 1990 the last F-117A (#843) was delivered from Lockheed. After completion of acceptance flights at Groom Lake of this last new F-117A aircraft, the flight test squadron continued flight test duties of refurbished aircraft after modifications by Lockheed. In February/March 1992 the test unit moved from Groom Lake to the USAF Plant 42 in Palmdale and was integrated with the Air Force Systems Command 6510th Test Squadron. Some testing, especially RCS verification and other classified activity was still conducted at Groom Lake throughout the operational lifetime of the F-117. The recently inactivated (2008) 410th Flight Test Squadron traces its roots, if not its formal lineage to the 4450th TG R-unit. ===Tonopah Test Range Airport=== Groom Lake was too small to be useful as the base for an operational unit. In addition, there were security concerns because an operational unit based at Groom Lake would involve many more people who could see things that they should not. Therefore, a new covert base had to be established for F-117 operations.Groom Lake An F-117A and A-7D refueling over the Nevada desert The USAF decided to build facilities at the Tonopah Test Range Airport. It was constructed in the 1950s, and during the 1960s and 1970s it was used for clandestine testing of acquired Soviet aircraft by the Tactical Air Command 4477th Test and Evaluation Squadron. The facility is not perfect from a security standpoint, since it is overlooked by public land and is 32 miles from the town of Tonopah. However, the security surrounding the Tonopah Test Range was effective. It was designated for the operations of the first USAF F-117 unit, the 4450th Tactical Group (TG).4450th Tactical Group Beginning in October 1979, the Tonopah Airport base was reconstructed and expanded for the F-117 mission. The 6,000 ft runway was lengthened to 10,000 ft. Taxiways, a concrete apron, a large maintenance hangar, and a propane storage tank were added.Tonopah Test Range Airport On 17 May 1982, the move of the 4450th TG from Groom Lake to Tonopah was initiated, with the final components of the move completed in early 1983. The \\"Baja Scopion\\" unit remained at Groom Lake until the last production F-117 was delivered from Lockheed in July 1990. During the operational lifetime of the F-117, personnel from Tonopah and later Holloman AFB were temporarily deployed to Groom Lake for checkout flights of classified elements of the aircraft. 4450th Tactical Group test pilots stand in front of one of their F-117As The 4450th achieved initial operational capability on 28 October 1983, with a total of 14 production F-117A aircraft on hand plus its A-7D trainers. A second group of nine A-7Ds were added to the squadron from Air National Guard squadrons along with a second A-7K trainer to accommodate the increasing number of pilots assigned to the F-117s. A total of approximately 20 A-7D aircraft used in developing the F-117, along with two A-7K trainers. The stealth fighter turned out to be easy to fly, and it was concluded that no two-seat trainer version was required. There was a ground-based training simulator. To avoid having the 4450th's aircraft seen during the day by Soviet reconnaissance satellites, all F-117 flying took place at night. During the day, the aircraft were kept inside special hangars. Its A-7Ds were parked outside on the ramp, and training flights were flown during the day to deceive Soviet Intelligence about the true mission of Tonopah. Thus, the impression that activities there were only the cover story of avionics tests and evaluations involving some old A-7Ds, which was well known to Soviet intelligence. Tonopah Airport continued to grow with more production F-117s being delivered from Lockheed and the size of the 4450th growing to accommodate mission requirements. New construction at the airport was split between two areas known as the Industrial Area and the Main Camp. Modern, two-story brick dorms were built. Eventually a recreation center was built, with a bowling alley, gymnasium, racquetball courts, and weight room, as well as a book and video library. Tonopah became much like any other isolated Air Force base, but it lacked dependents, and nights in the Man Camp were punctuated by the distant sound of jet aircraft taking off and landing. Group personnel worked four days per week and would be flown to Tonopah either on Monday or Tuesday morning using Key Airlines contractor- provided Boeing 727 and later 737 passenger jets from Nellis AFB. On Thursday or Friday afternoons, the reverse would take place, leaving only essential personnel at Tonopah over the weekend. At Nellis, the passenger jets sitting at the flight line became a common sight. If the base personnel knew‚Äîand many of them did‚Äîthat the contractor aircraft were there to ferry most of the 2,500 inhabitants of Tonopah to work, they didn't talk about it. It was part of what became known as the \\"Night Hawk spirit\\", the devotion to a secret worth keeping. It pervaded Tonopah and its sister base at Nellis, where thousands of family members knew not to ask where their loved ones went for four days each week. Due to the sensitive nature of being assigned to the 4450th, there were few transfers out of the unit once personnel were assigned. Airmen and Officers went through a thorough security investigation, far more than what airmen went through for \\"normal\\" assignments. OERs and APRs were reviewed, background investigations were conducted, and before an assignment was approved to the unit, each member's personnel and security file were reviewed and approved by the 4450th's commanding officer. Personnel signed security oaths, and in the case of a separation or transfer out of the unit, a through de-briefing was conducted to remind the personnel of the sensitive nature of the work they did and not to discuss any element of their assignment. Beirut 1983 During October 1983, the US government ordered the Department of Defense to plan an attack on the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and PLO sympathizers/terrorists in Southern Lebanon in response to the destruction of the US Marine barracks at Beirut Airport. The Seventh Fleet in the Mediterranean was moved into position off the coast of Lebanon and the 4450th at Tonopah TTR was put on alert. Five to seven F-117A aircraft were armed and their Internal Navigation Systems aligned to targets in the area. The plan called for the F-117As to fly from Tonopah TTR to Myrtle Beach AFB, South Carolina, where they would be put in hangars. They would wait 48 hours for the crew to rest and then fly the aircraft non-stop from Myrtle Beach to southern Lebanon. The attack was planned against positively identified locations of the terrorist groups that were known to be responsible for the car bomb and the deaths of 183 Marines of the peace keeping force in Beirut. Caspar Weinberger, the Secretary of Defense, decided to scrub the mission just 45 minutes before the aircraft were to take off for Myrtle Beach. The F-117As were taken off alert, disarmed and had their INS systems reprogrammed for training purposes. Operation Team Spirit 1984 In early 1984 the P-unit A-7D's deployed to Kunsan Air Base, South Korea to participate in Team Spirit 1984. The word was purposely leaked that the 4450th TG A-7Ds were carrying supersecret atomic antiradar devices that would render the airplane invisible. To maintain the deception, each A-7D was outfitted with old napalm canisters painted black with a flashing red danger light in the rear. The canisters carried a radiation warning tag over an ominous- looking slot on which was printed: \\"Reactor Cooling Fill Port.\\" When the 4450th TG deployed carrying these bogus devices, Air Police closed down the base and ringed the field with machine gun-toting jeeps. They forced all the runway personnel to turn their backs to the A-7s as they taxied past, and actually had them spread-eagled on the deck with their eyes closed until the 4450th TG A7s took off. Operation El Dorado Canyon By 28 February 1986 Lockheed had delivered 33 F-117As, giving the Air Force two operational squadrons of F-117As. During this time, Libya's Colonel Muammar al-Gaddafi had been challenging the US Navy for about a year and a half and had also sponsored a number of terrorist activities in Europe. After a few aerial incidents which resulted in the loss of a number of Libyan aircraft, and a terrorist attack in West Germany that was positively linked by the United States to Libya, the US government decided to strike back. On 15 April 1986 a bombing raid was planned under the code name Operation El Dorado Canyon. The F-117A was identified as the best suited weapons system for the mission. Although senior officers at Tactical Air Command knew of the F-117A's capabilities, the theater commanders knew nothing of its capabilities or its existence. As a result, the raid was carried out using carrier based Navy A-6 Intruders, A-7 Corsair IIs, F/A-18 Hornets, and USAF F-111s assigned to the USAFE 48th TFW at RAF Lakenheath, England. Once again, the F-117As were within less than one hour from launch when Caspar Weinberger scrubbed the mission. He felt that the aircraft was too valuable to risk on such insignificant targets and the F-117A's participation in the raid was canceled. Crashes The 4450th TG's mission continued to evolve under a cloak of secrecy, as all Tonopah training flights conducted at night under the cover of darkness until late 1988. With more production F-117s aircraft being delivered by Lockheed, the 4453d Test and Evaluation Squadron (TES) (\\"Z Unit\\") was activated on 4 October 1985 at Tonopah.

In the meantime, training continued out in the Nevada desert. On 11 July 1986, Major Ross E. Mulhare flew into a mountain near Bakersfield, California, while flying production aircraft number seven (81-10792). Major Mulhare seems to have made no attempt to eject and was killed instantly, his aircraft disintegrating upon impact. A recovery team was dispatched to the crash site, and the area was cordoned off. Every identifiable piece of the crashed plane was found and removed from the area to prevent them from falling into the wrong hands. Some rather odd stories and rumors began to circulate about this incident in an attempt to explain the high amount of secrecy as well as to throw the media or the merely curious off the track. One cover story that appeared was that Major Mulhare was flying a Soviet MiG-23 when he crashed. There was a report that the recovery crew had dug and sifted the soil to a distance of 1,000 yards from the last recognizable debris and to a depth of 6 feet to make sure that no one snooping in the area would ever find any piece of the aircraft. Another story was that to mislead scavengers, the recovery crew had taken the remains of a crashed F-101A Voodoo that had been at Groom Lake for over 20 years, broken them up, and scattered them throughout the area. In an article not long afterward, The Washington Post quoted unnamed defense sources as saying that roughly 50 stealth aircraft were operational and combat-ready, although the true figure was about half that large. Within days, The Sacramento Bee published an article describing the base facilities at Tonopah. On 14 October 1987, while flying production aircraft number 30 (tail number 84-0815), Major Michael C. Stewart crashed in the Nellis range just east of Tonopah. He apparently made no attempt to eject, and was killed instantly. The official cause was never revealed, but fatigue and disorientation may have played a role. There was no moon that night, and there were no lights on the Nellis range to help the pilot to distinguish the ground. Reportedly, the mission included certain requirements that were deleted from the final accident report. It is possible that Stewart was going supersonic when he crashed and that he had become disoriented during high- speed maneuvers and had simply flown his plane into the ground. During the F-117A testing program, there were three A-7Ds lost in flight operations, one over the Nellis Range, one on a cross-country flight near Tinker AFB, Oklahoma, and a third which made headlines in the media when an A-7D (69-6207) crashed into a Ramada Inn at Indianapolis, and the media curiosity rose quickly when it was discovered that the pilot of the A-7 was assigned to the 4450th TG, identified as the home unit of the pilot killed in the publicly unexplained 1986 Bakersfield crash. Noting that the 4450th at Nellis apparently flew the only A-7Ds left in the active forces, a number of experts publicly speculated that the A-7Ds were being flown to sharpen pilot daytime attack skills, since it was widely rumored in the press that the Air Force stealth aircraft were known to fly only at night. ===Security leaks=== In 1979, public leaks about the stealth fighter began to appear in the aviation press, but at the time it was little more than gossip. During the summer of 1980, the pace of stealth leaks picked up. In the week of 10 August, Aviation Week and Space Technology, The Washington Post, and ABC News all carried stories on stealth. (Up to this point, the popular press had ignored stealth). The stories said that stealth technology was being developed for several types of aircraft, including bombers. They reported that it used RAM and curved surfaces to reduce the radar return.(The latter was entirely inaccurate).Peebles, Curtis, (1999), Dark Eagles, Presidio Press; Revised edition, 1980 was an election year and on 22 August 1980, Defense Secretary Harold Brown held a press conference: \\"...I am announcing today a major technological advance of great military significance. This so-called 'stealth' technology enables the United States to build manned and unmanned aircraft that cannot be successfully intercepted with existing air defense systems. We have demonstrated to our satisfaction that the technology works\\". The Brown press conference set off a firestorm of charges by Republicans that the Carter Administration was using stealth technology to curry voters in the wake of the Iran Hostage Crisis and the failure of the Desert One rescue mission. However, the fact was that the public disclosure of the concept and possibilities of stealth aircraft, which few in the public and press could understand, did not change the outcome of the November 1980 election. The incoming Reagan administration increased the secrecy surrounding the stealth program. Although several projects would remain unknown for a decade and more, the effort was not entirely successful with the stealth fighter. In large part to the 1980 announcement by Secretary Brown, aerospace circles published speculative articles, By 1983, artists' conceptions of the \\"F-19\\" began to appear (F-19 was the speculative name of the aircraft, since the F-18 designation was the Navy derivative of the F-17, and Northrop used the F-20 designation for its privately funded F-5E Tiger II replacement). The general pattern was a long SR-71-like fuselage, elliptical wings at the rear, a bubble canopy, canards, and twin inward-canted fins. As it was now known the SR-71 had a reduced RCS, it was assumed the \\"F-19 Stealth Fighter\\" was similar. Among those following the stealth story was the Testor Corporation. In 1985, they began work on a conceptual model of the F-19 which appeared in stores. ===Declassification=== Although the erroneous reports effectively hid the true information, it was clear that the wall of secrecy around the F-117A was breaking down. On 22 August 1986, a story in The Washington Post said that about fifty aircraft were operational, that the F-19 designation was incorrect, and that the plane was described as \\"ugly\\" due to its bulging, nontraditional shape. The plane's base was also identified as being Tonopah Airport. In January 1988, Armed Forces Journal revealed the aircraft's actual designation was the F-117 Nighthawk. More important, the \\"big secret\\" of stealth, faceting, was starting to leak out. In 1986, there were reports that the F-19 was not smooth, but rather had \\"a multi-faceted outer-body surface\\" and a \\"cut-diamond exterior\\". This was described as being thousands of flat surfaces, none more than eight square inches in size, which did not share the same \\"reflectivity angle.\\" The F-117A actually used large panels, but the basic principle was the same. F-117A Nighthawk 79-7084 shown in a hangar at Nellis AFB, Nevada, while attached to the 57th Fighter Weapons Wing (Detachment 1). Bringing the F-117A out of the Black would have a number of advantages. The plane could be used in Red Flag exercises and could become part of standard war planning. There were benefits for the pilots too. With daylight flights possible, the fatigue from the late hours would be lessened. Night flights could start earlier and not have to race with the dawn. This would make the pilots' home lives easier. The problem was, ironically, that 1988 was also a presidential election year, and pressure from Congress forced the Air Force to wait until after the November election to officially announce the F-117's existence (harking back to the 1980 stealth announcement). On 10 November 1988, the Air Force brought the F-117A from behind a \\"black veil\\" by publicly acknowledging its existence, but provided few details about it. The press release stated that the F-117A was assigned to the 4450th Tactical Group at Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada. The aircraft was based at the Tonopah Test Range Airport in Nevada. It also contained the facts that the first flight had been made in June 1981, that three had crashed, and that fifty-two had been delivered out of a total of fifty-nine ordered from Lockheed. A single photo was also released. The angular shape came as a surprise to the press and the public, as did the out- of-sequence \\"century-series\\" designation. No information was given out as to the F-117A's dimensions, cost, range, or speed. The official confirmation of the F-117A's existence, however, had little impact on Tonopah operations. Pilots began occasionally flying the F-117A during the day, but base personnel were still ferried to and from work each Monday and Friday from Nellis. Everyone associated with the project was still forbidden to talk about what they did for a living, and the program remained shrouded in secrecy. ===Inactivation=== T-38 Talon 68‚Äì8016 at Tonopah Airport T-38s replaced the A-7Ds in early 1989 after the public announcement of the F-117A's existence. In January 1989, the AT-38 Talon replaced the A-7D in the unit's inventory as a measure to streamline the F-117A's training operation, and the squadrons A-7Ds were transferred to several Air National Guard squadrons. The A-7Ks were transferred to the Arizona Air National Guard at Tucson for use at the ANG A-7 training school there. With the 1988 public announcement of the existence of the F-117A program, the formerly clandestine 4450th Tactical Group, which had transitioned the F-117 from a development to operational weapons system was put on the road to inactivation when the Air Force decided to increase the 4450th TG to a Wing level organization. As part of the phasedown of operations at George AFB, California, the 37th Tactical Fighter Wing was reassigned, without equipment or personnel to Tonopah Test Range Airport on 5 October 1989, and assumed the aircraft, personnel, equipment and mission of the provisional 4450th Tactical Group. As part of the transition from the provisional group to 37th TFW, the F-117A squadrons were inactivated and re- designated as follows:A short history of the 37th Training Wing.

It was invented by John Platt in 1998 at Microsoft Research. SMO is widely used for training support vector machines and is implemented by the popular LIBSVM tool. The publication of the SMO algorithm in 1998 has generated a lot of excitement in the SVM community, as previously available methods for SVM training were much more complex and required expensive third-party QP solvers. == Optimization problem == Consider a binary classification problem with a dataset (x1, y1), ..., (xn, yn), where xi is an input vector and is a binary label corresponding to it. A soft-margin support vector machine is trained by solving a quadratic programming problem, which is expressed in the dual form as follows: :\\\\max_{\\\\alpha} \\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\alpha_i - \\\\frac12 \\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\sum_{j=1}^n y_i y_j K(x_i, x_j) \\\\alpha_i \\\\alpha_j, :subject to: :0 \\\\leq \\\\alpha_i \\\\leq C, \\\\quad \\\\mbox{ for } i=1, 2, \\\\ldots, n, :\\\\sum_{i=1}^n y_i \\\\alpha_i = 0 where C is an SVM hyperparameter and K(xi, xj) is the kernel function, both supplied by the user; and the variables \\\\alpha_i are Lagrange multipliers. == Algorithm == SMO is an iterative algorithm for solving the optimization problem described above. SMO breaks this problem into a series of smallest possible sub-problems, which are then solved analytically. Because of the linear equality constraint involving the Lagrange multipliers \\\\alpha_i, the smallest possible problem involves two such multipliers. Then, for any two multipliers \\\\alpha_1 and \\\\alpha_2, the constraints are reduced to: :0 \\\\leq \\\\alpha_1, \\\\alpha_2 \\\\leq C, :y_1 \\\\alpha_1 + y_2 \\\\alpha_2 = k, and this reduced problem can be solved analytically: one needs to find a minimum of a one-dimensional quadratic function. k is the negative of the sum over the rest of terms in the equality constraint, which is fixed in each iteration. The algorithm proceeds as follows: # Find a Lagrange multiplier \\\\alpha_1 that violates the Karush‚ÄìKuhn‚ÄìTucker (KKT) conditions for the optimization problem. # Pick a second multiplier \\\\alpha_2 and optimize the pair (\\\\alpha_1,\\\\alpha_2). # Repeat steps 1 and 2 until convergence. When all the Lagrange multipliers satisfy the KKT conditions (within a user-defined tolerance), the problem has been solved. Although this algorithm is guaranteed to converge, heuristics are used to choose the pair of multipliers so as to accelerate the rate of convergence. This is critical for large data sets since there are n(n-1)/2 possible choices for \\\\alpha_i and \\\\alpha_j. == Related Work == The first approach to splitting large SVM learning problems into a series of smaller optimization tasks was proposed by Bernhard Boser, Isabelle Guyon, Vladimir Vapnik. It is known as the \\"chunking algorithm\\". The algorithm starts with a random subset of the data, solves this problem, and iteratively adds examples which violate the optimality conditions. One disadvantage of this algorithm is that it is necessary to solve QP-problems scaling with the number of SVs. On real world sparse data sets, SMO can be more than 1000 times faster than the chunking algorithm. In 1997, E. Osuna, R. Freund, and F. Girosi proved a theorem which suggests a whole new set of QP algorithms for SVMs. By the virtue of this theorem a large QP problem can be broken down into a series of smaller QP sub-problems. A sequence of QP sub-problems that always add at least one violator of the Karush‚ÄìKuhn‚ÄìTucker (KKT) conditions is guaranteed to converge. The chunking algorithm obeys the conditions of the theorem, and hence will converge. The SMO algorithm can be considered a special case of the Osuna algorithm, where the size of the optimization is two and both Lagrange multipliers are replaced at every step with new multipliers that are chosen via good heuristics. The SMO algorithm is closely related to a family of optimization algorithms called Bregman methods or row-action methods. These methods solve convex programming problems with linear constraints. They are iterative methods where each step projects the current primal point onto each constraint. == See also == * Kernel perceptron == References == Category:Optimization algorithms and methods Category:Support vector machines ","title":"Sequential minimal optimization"},{"id":"20154504","text":"Hot tapping, or pressure tapping, is the method of making a connection to existing piping or pressure vessels without the interrupting or emptying of that section of pipe or vessel. This means that a pipe or tank can continue to be in operation whilst maintenance or modifications are being done to it. The process is also used to drain off pressurized casing fluids and add test points or various sensors such as temperature and pressure. Hot taps can range from a ¬Ω inch hole designed for something as simple as quality control testing, up to a 48-inch tap for the installation of a variety of ports, valves, t-sections or other pipes. Hot Tap Procedures: A. A hot tap saddle, service saddle or welded threadolet, valve installed, assembly is pressure tested and hot tap machine attached. B. Valve opened, hot tap completed, coupon or cut portion retained by latches on pilot drill. Pressure is contained within the hot tapping machine. C. Cutter and coupon retracted and valve closed. Fluid is drained and hot tapping machine is removed. The tapped valve is now ready for the contractor's tie-in or IFT's linestop/stopple equipment to be inserted.https://www.hottap.com/pipeline-hot-tapping- services.php Hot tapping is also the first procedure in line stopping, where a hole saw is used to make an opening in the pipe, so a line plugging head can be inserted.

T. K. Chari (5 June 1909 - 5 January 1993) was Head of the Department of Philosophy at Madras Christian College from 1958 to 1969 and the most prominent among contemporary Indian philosophers who paid close attention to psi phenomena. Chari published extensively on extremely diverse topics, such as logic, linguistics, information theory, mathematics, quantum physics, philosophy of mind, and, of course, psi research. == Early life == Cadambur Tiruvenkatachari Krishnamachari (CTK) was born on 5 June 1909 in Tiruvellore, South India. He was the third son of Tiruvenkatachari and Padmammal. He had two older brothers - C.T.Rajagopal, a noted mathematician, and C.T.Venugopal. They had a young sister - Kamala. They were grand nephews and niece of the illustrious brothers - Sir.P.Rajagopalachari KCSI, CIE and P.Narasimhachari - Justice in High Court of Burma (Myanmar). CTK and his family lived in Triplicane (Chennai) on Big Street and all of them studied in Hindu Higher secondary school. He did his intermediate in Presidency College, Chennai. Following the two years in the intermediate college, he got his BA (Honors) from Madras Christian College (MCC) and distinguished himself by also winning the Samuel Sathyanathan Gold medal for Philosophy. He then became a tutor and lecturer at American College, Madurai. In 1940, he joined MCC as an assistant professor. == Career == CTK was contributing scholarly articles to scientific magazines and journals even before he got his doctorate or before becoming a professor at MCC. His first paper ‚Äì ‚ÄòAn Epistemological approach to the special theory of relativity' was published by Mind in April 1937. Towards the end of 1952 he started to work on his doctoral thesis - 'On some spatial representations of time and their significance for problem of precognition'. His supervisor was Professor Parthasarathy (Major) and in 1953, his thesis was sent to a board of three judges that included Sir Karl Popper at University of London. He was awarded his PhD with top honors, something that was widely expected. At the same time the University allowed him to convert his BA (Honors) degree to be an MA degree. By 1958, he was appointed the Head of the Department of Philosophy. From then to his retirement in 1969, he and his family lived at Staff Bungalow 15 (behind Bishop Heber Hall) on the Madras Christian College Campus at Tambaram. Following his retirement, he continued as a (University Grants Commission) professor until 1976. He also was the acting head of the department of Philosophy until 1971. The family moved outside the college campus to a house which they called 'The Cloister' where CTK and Mythili lived out the remainder of their lives. == Contemporaries == In 1955, Gardner Murphy visited Dr. Chari at the request of Eileen Garrett - a medium and one of the founding members of the Parapsychology Foundation, after which Dr. Chari became a regular contributor to various parapsychological magazines. == Interests == He wrote much about philosophy of science, social impact of the philosophy, metaphysics, psychology, parapsychology, cognitive sciences and quantum mechanics. Apart from written articles for various journals, he also had his speeches broadcast on radio occasionally, of which 'Philosophy of Bertrand Russell' - is the only documented one as it was later published by All India Radio === Reincarnation and astrology === He had a long and engaged battle of wits with Ian Stevenson who studied reincarnation across South East Asia and published a lot of cases favoring the phenomenon. CTK was skeptical, and questioned Dr. Stevenson's research in the Journal for American Society of Psychical Research. He similarly discussed the research and views of Dr. B. V. Raman, who was the founder of the Indian Astrological magazine. == Later years == In the 1980s, he slowly wound down his research activities, though his correspondence with various scholars continued to the very end. His last contribution was a paper titled 'Paranormal Religious Thanthology' to Christian Parapsychologist in March 1992. Mythili died in Jan 1992 and CTK died within a year in Jan 1993. == References  Publications == By C. T. K.

It is a derivative of fluorouracil, being a lypophilic-masked analog of 5-FU that can be administered orally. ==Biology== Carmofur prodrug is ingested and taken up in the intestine, overcoming the problem of 5-FU degradation by dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase. Once inside a cell, carmofur prodrug is converted into 5-FU. ==Mechanism of action== The mechanism of action of carmofur prodrug is traditionally thought to be the generation of 5‚ÄìFU. However, carmofur is a highly potent acid ceramidase (AC) inhibitor. Ceramide influences cancer cell survival, growth and death. Inhibition of AC activity sensitizes tumor cells to the effects of antineoplastic agents and radiation. Carmofur, much more effective than temozolomide, has been reported as the small-molecule drug capable of killing adult and pediatric glioblastomas. ==Medicinal uses== Product marketing for carmofur started in 1981. Carmofur has also been used as adjuvant chemotherapy for curatively resected colorectal cancer patients in China, Japan, and Finland for many years. Trials and meta-analyses have confirmed that the drug is effective on patients with this cancer type, extending their survival. Carmofur has been shown to inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 main protease, and is therefore a promising lead compound to develop new antiviral treatment for COVID-19. ==Adverse effects== As fluorouracil, carmofur has been known to induce leukoencephalopathy, characterized by progressive damage to white matter in the brain with stroke-like symptoms. A clinical trial for small hepatocellular carcinoma was stopped prematurely because 56% of the treated patients had unacceptable side effects. Moreover, the treatment had no survival advantage for stage 1 and 2 cancer patients. This may be a reason why carmofur was never pursued for FDA-approval in the US. == Chemical synthesis== Ozaki et al. has reported carmofur synthesized by treating 5-FU with phosgene and hexylamine. Xiong et al. reported an alternative approach for carmofur synthesis.

Grover taught courses on Recreational Reading, The History of the Book, and Literary Personalities. He established the first bookstore in Winter Park, The Bookery, and began a publishing venture, The Angel Alley Press.

Cowles, daughter of Judge Cowles of San Diego in 1858. They had two sons Alfred and Addison. ==Early years== Dr. French was born in Middlesex, New York on January 20, 1822. He was the son of Harvey and Amanda Hazelton French. His father was a veteran of the War of 1812. He attended local schools before moving to Michigan where he attended Albion Seminary. While in Hillsdale County he studied medicine and practiced as a doctor for some years. In 1845 he went to Fort Leavenworth, Kansas where he enlisted in the US Army at the start of the Mexican American War and entered the service as a private even though he was a practicing physician in civilian life. ==Middle years== Dr. French's goal was to make his fortune in the world, and he set out to do that in December 1845. His plans were interrupted by the Mexican-American War, in which he served. After he was discharged in early 1847, he resumed his quest for adventure, purchased a large ranch northeast of Los Angeles in the late 1840s, assisted some lost settlers who had mistakenly wandered through California's Death Valley, and opened a mining town in south central California. The residents of that town named the village after Dr. French ‚Äî they called it Darwin, California. The town is still in existence as of 2017. Dr. French had heard that there was a possible silver lode in the midst of Death Valley. Despite that it was largely unexplored, Dr. French led an expedition into the valley in 1850 but found no silver. In 1860, Darwin led another party into Death Valley in a second attempt to find silver, again without success. The route he took can still be observed in Death Valley National Park. Two other landmarks are named after him, Darwin Falls and Darwin Wash. The 1846 journey of General Stephen Kearny and his Army of the West across the wilderness of the southwestern United States has been the subject of many books and articles. Dr. French was on that march and captured a vivid account of the Battle of San Pasqual, in which he fought. ==The Battle of San Pasqual, Dec. 6, 1846== Dictation from Poway, California by Dr. E.D.

This process serves as a control, or temporary valve, that can be removed after alterations or valve replacements have been made. With a hot tap previously made on a line, a line stopper is attached to a temporary valve, and the valve is opened. The line stopper is hydraulically or mechanically pushed into the line to seal the pipe. The main is supported by the line stop sleeve. After performing the necessary service, the stop is removed, and a blind flange is installed on the sleeve. There are various types of line stopping heads. The oldest and still most widely used method of line plugging is the pivoting head style line stop. This technology dates back to the 1930s. The pivot head line stop requires a full size on size hot tap in order to be inserted into the operating piping system. Other methods include the folding head line stop, which enters the pipe through a reduced branch hot tap; the Sure-Stop line stop, which intersects the pipe and does not seal inside the pipe like other methods; and the HTP, which is a high temperature, high pressure system that will stop the flow on existing pipes at operating temperatures above what other methods of line stops can safely stop. A single line stop can be used to stop off and abandon a shutdown. Two or more line stops can be used in tandem to isolate and bypass many intersecting lines at once. Fluid in the line is bypassed, leaving a workable dead section to alter, repair, or add a valve while service provided by this line is continued.

Calabresi is Clayton J. and Henry R. Barber Professor of Law at Northwestern University Pritzker School of Law. He is the nephew of Guido Calabresi, a U.S. Appellate judge and former dean of the Yale Law School. ==Biography== Calabresi graduated from the Moses Brown School in Providence, Rhode Island, in 1976. He then attended Yale College, graduating cum laude in 1980. He received his J.D. degree from Yale Law School, where he was the Note & Topics Editor of the Yale Law Journal. After law school, he served as law clerk for Judge Ralph K. Winter of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, Judge Robert H. Bork of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, and Justice Antonin Scalia of the United States Supreme Court. While at Yale Law School, Calabresi and two Yale College friends, Lee Liberman Otis and David McIntosh, founded the Yale chapter of the Federalist Society, one of the Society's three original chapters. In 2019, he was chairman of the Society's board of directors. Calabresi is an active libertarian-conservative author and commentator. Calabresi joined the faculty of Northwestern Law School in 1990. He has been a visiting professor at Yale Law School (in the fall semesters of 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016), and a visiting professor of political theory at Brown University, where he has taught since 2010. ==Political life== Calabresi served under presidents Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush from 1985 to 1990. During that time, he advised Attorney General Edwin Meese III, and Reagan Domestic Policy Chief T. Kenneth Cribb, and wrote campaign speeches for Vice President Dan Quayle. Calabresi supports legally recognizing same-sex marriages. In 2016, Calabresi endowed the Abraham Lincoln Lecture on Constitutional Law at Northwestern Priztker School of Law in Chicago. The lecture's purpose is to show Lincoln's enormous talent as a constitutional lawyer and to reflect on what legal changes Lincoln's legacy might appropriately call for today. With Gary S. Lawson, Calabresi has argued that the Mueller Probe was unlawful. In July 2020, Calabresi wrote a New York Times editorial condemning a tweet by President Trump that floated postponing the 2020 election.

MesoHABSIM is an augmentation of this system, designed during a restoration study of the Quinebaug River.Northeast Instream Habitat Program. Northeast Instream Habitat Program ‚Äì Quinbaug River 10 November. 2008. The changing spatial distributions of physical attributes of a river as a result of variations in flow and the biological responses of aquatic species to these changes, provide the basis for simulating the consequences of ecosystem alteration, and consequently the justification of restoration measures. MesoHABSIM modifies the data acquisition technique and analytical approach of similar models by changing the scale of resolution from micro- to meso-scales. Due to this increase in scale, the model takes variations in stream morphology along the river into account and allows for application in larger-scale projects. == Data collection and analysis == Mesohabitat types are defined by their hydromorphological units (HMUs), such as pools and rapids, geomorphology, land cover and other hydrological characteristics. Mesohabitats are mapped under multiple flow conditions at extensive sites along the river. Fish data is collected in randomly distributed mesohabitats where habitat surveys are also conducted. This allows modeling of available fish habitat at a range of flows. Rating curves represent the changes in relative area of suitable habitat in response to flow and allow for the determination of habitat quantity at any given flow within the range of surveys. These rating curves can be developed for river units of any size allowing conclusions to be drawn about the suitability of channel patterns or habitat structures for various species of fish for specific sections as well as for the entire river. Rating curves can also be used to evaluate the benefits of various restoration measures on the entire fish community. In combination with hydrologic time series, rating curves are used to create Continuous Under Threshold (CUT) curves for the analysis of frequency, magnitude and duration of significant habitat events. The CUT curve technique described by Capra et al. (1995)Capra, H., B. Pascal, and Y. Souchon. 1995. A new tool to interpret magnitude and duration of fish habitat variations. Regulated Rivers: Research and Management. 10: 281‚Äì289. defines critical thresholds and determines what habitat variability and availability is necessary to support the target river fauna. CUT curves evaluate durations of unsuitable habitat under a specified threshold by comparing continuous durations in days under this threshold to the cumulative durations in the study period. A highly useful product of the CUT curves are reference tables that can be used to determine how long a given species can tolerate unsuitable conditions depending on its life stage. == Results == To use physical habitat models to analyze and predict ecosystem potential, compositions must also be determined of the native fish community and a subset of species must be selected for model development. The development of a Reference Fish Community (RFC) is based on the Target Fish Community approach, described by Bain and Meixler (2000).Meixler. 2000. Defining a Target Fish Community for Planning and Evaluating Enhancement on the Quinebaug River in Massachusetts and Connecticut. Report for Quinebaug River Study Agencies. Cornell University, Ithaca, NY A comprehensive list of species is generated from literature sources and available regional data collected on relatively intact river reaches. The species are ranked on the basis of abundance in long-term fish collection data from multiple rivers of similar character. Securing habitat for naturally occurring dominant species (ecology) should preserve the most profound characteristics of the ecosystem, providing survival conditions for the majority of the aquatic community and therefore a reference for restoration efforts. The simplest way to create a river habitat model is therefore to select the five to ten highest ranking species for model development. It can then be assumed that community structure reflects habitat structure; therefore, the most common species should indicate the most common habitat. Since habitat availability forms the structure of aquatic fauna, the affinity between the structure of the river habitat and the structure of the fish community can be used as a measure of habitat quality. The results of MesoHABSIM creates the framework for integrative analysis of many aspects of the ecosystem. It also allows managers to recreate reference conditions and evaluate possible instream and watershed restoration measures or alterations (such as dam removals or changes in water withdrawals). From the perspective of resource managers, it not only allows for quantitative measures of ecological integrity, but also creates a basis for making decisions where trade-offs between resource use and river restoration need to be considered. == Publications involving the MesoHABSIM Model == *Parasiewicz, P.

In 1938, when he was twelve he moved to Argentina with his family in order to escape Fascist persecution. In Buenos Aires he completed his studies and in 1943 he began his career in journalism, as the director of Italia libera (Free Italy). ===Career=== After the war he left Argentina and returned to Modena with his family, just in time to take part in the national referendum, on June 2, 1946, for the Italians to choose between Monarchy and Republic. At twenty, he continued his journalism career in Modena and managed the newspaper Gazzetta di Modena for almost two years, until he chose to live in Israel. From 1951 to 1953, he was a correspondent from London for the Turin daily Gazzetta del Popolo. From 1953 to 1959, he wired his pieces from Rome to the Milan evening newspaper Corriere di Informazione. ===Important assignments=== In 1960, Levi moved to Moscow. There, until 1962, he was a correspondent for the Corriere della Sera and then, until 1966, a correspondent for Il Giorno. In 1966 he moved to RAI, where he was the chief newscaster until 1968 (this was an innovative change on Italian TV, because previously the News were read by professional \\"speakers\\" and not by journalists). Levi returned to the press in 1969, as correspondent for the Turin newspaper La Stampa, a job he kept until 1973, when he became the managing director of that very newspaper and its evening edition Stampa Sera. He remained in Turin until 1978. From 1979 to 1983, he collaborated with The Times, editing its international section. In 1988, he was appointed Chief Editor of Corriere della Sera and from 1998 to July 3, 2007, he was Adviser for External Relations to two Italian presidents, first Carlo Azeglio Ciampi and then Giorgio Napolitano. ===Television=== Besides the TV News which he led in the 60s, Levi was involved in numerous TV programs, mainly produced for RAI. Among these: Tam Tam (1981), Punto sette and Punto sette, una vita. Then, for Channel 5, Tiv√π Tiv√π with Angelo Campanella (from 1985 to 1987). Thereafter, again for RAI: I giorni dell'infanzia (1993), Emozioni TV (1995) and Gli archivi del Cremlino (The Kremlin Archives) (1997), a program which he also authored. In 1999, on RAI1, he directed C'era una volta la Russia (Once Upon A Time, Russia). ===Death=== Levi died on 24 August 2020 in his hometown in Rome at the age of 94. ==QuoteBibliography== A selection among the many books and essays published by Arrigo Levi: * ' (RAI, 1966) (with Alberto Ronchey) * Il potere in Russia da Stalin a Breznev (Il Mulino, 1967) * La televisione all'italiana (1969, Etas Kompass) * Viaggio fra gli economisti (1970, Il Mulino) ** Journey Among The Economists (1974, Open Court) * PCI, la lunga marcia verso il potere (1971, Etas Kompass) * Un'idea dell'Italia (1979, Mondadori) * Il comunismo da Budapest a Praga 1956 ‚Äì 1958 (with Enzo Bettiza, Adolfo Battaglia e Ennio Ceccarini) (1969, Edizioni della voce) * Ipotesi sull'Italia (1983, Il Mulino) * La Democrazia nell'Italia che cambia (1984, Laterza) * Intervista sulla DC (1986) * Noi: gli italiani (1988, Laterza) * Tra Est e Ovest (1990, Rizzoli) * Yitzhak Rabin. 1210 giorni per la pace (1996, Mondadori) * Le due fedi (1996, Il Mulino) * La vecchiaia pu√≤ attendere: ovvero l'arte di restare giovani (1997, Mondadori) * Rapporto sul Medio Oriente (1998, Il Mulino) * Russia del '900: una storia europea (1999, Corbaccio) * Dialoghi di fine Millennio (1999, Rizzoli) (with Andrea Riccardi and Eugenio Scalfari) * Dialoghi sulla fede (2000, Il Mulino) (with Vincenzo Paglia and Andrea Riccardi) * ' (2004, Il Mulino) * Cinque discorsi tra due secoli (2004, Il Mulino]) ==Prizes and recognition== * Knight Grand Cross (1991) * Trento Prize for Journalism (1987) * as Best Correspondent for the year 1995 * Ischia International Journalism Award (2001) * Guidarello Prize (2006) ==References== Category:1926 births Category:2020 deaths Category:Italian journalists Category:Italian male journalists Category:Italian male writers Category:Jewish Italian writers Category:Italian Jews Category:People from Modena Category:Recipients of the Order of the Cross of Terra Mariana, 3rd Class ","title":"Arrigo Levi"},{"id":"20154890","text":"A bridge is a type of social tie that connects two different groups in a social network. ==General bridge== In general, a bridge is a direct tie between nodes that would otherwise be in disconnected components of the graph.Ahn, Luis von. \\"Thresholds and Collective Action.\\" Sept. 16, 2008. http://scienceoftheweb.org/15-396/lectures/lecture07.pdf This means that say that A and B make up a social networking graph, n_1 is in A, n_2 is in B, and there is a social tie e between n_1 and n_2.

Local bridges differ from regular bridges in that the end points of the local bridge once the bridge has been deleted cannot have a tie directly between them and should not share any common neighbors. Also if the local bridge is deleted the distance between these two nodes will be increased to a value strictly more than two.David Easley and Jon Kleinberg. \\"Networks, Crowds, and Markets: Reasoning about a Highly Connected World\\".

Author Malcolm Gladwell characterizes people that habitually act as bridges as Connectors in his book The Tipping Point. Bridges and local bridges are powerful ways to convey awareness of new things, but they are weak at transmitting behaviors that are in some way risky or costly to adopt.

In 1990, the long-standing squadron nickname of \\"Taskmasters\\" was replaced with \\"Warhawks,\\" illustrating the renewed commitment to training the best and brightest for battle in the newest of \\"Hawks.\\" HS-10 transitioned eight entire fleet HS squadrons in addition to the normal replacement pilot/aircrew load. Additionally, the Warhawks provided training for Navy Helicopter Combat Squadrons (HCS), U.S. Coast Guard personnel in their initial transition to the HH-60J \\"Jayhawks,\\" and pilots from Germany's Naval Air Arm. In addition to providing training support for numerous organizations, HS-10 had a secondary role of Search and Rescue. In its 38-year history, HS-10 successfully completed more than 100 rescues of both civilian and military personnel along the coast of Southern California. Tactics development and evaluation was a natural role for HS-10, as most of the permanently assigned personnel had significant fleet experience in the ASW and Combat Search and Rescue (CSAR) mission areas. This expertise was instrumental in the development of SH-60F training plans and tactical procedures for the fleet's operational carrier battle groups. As the armed forces experience a period of downsizing, the capability to effectively operate in the \\"joint\\" and \\"combined\\" arenas was even more critical. To this end, HS-10 forged ahead with exchange instructor pilots from the U.S. Air Force, Canada, Australia, and Germany. The U.S. Navy deactivated HS-10 on July 12, 2012.http://www.navy.mil/view_image.asp?id=127606 ==References *HS-10 official website Category:Helicopter anti-submarine squadrons of the United States Navy ","title":"HS-10 Warhawks"},{"id":"20154922","text":"Nicholson is an unincorporated community in Kenton County, Kentucky, United States, located directly south of Independence. ==Geography== Nicholson is centered at the intersection of Kentucky Routes 17 and 16. ==Government== Emergency Medical Services, fire prevention and suppression is provided by the Independence Fire District with policing provided by the Kenton County Police. ==Library== The William E.

On 30 October 1964, the two countries exchanged notes, establishing diplomatic relations between the two. Political ties Political relations between the Soviet Union and Zambia were challenged by Chinese presence in Zambia, and the cordial attitude of the Kaunda government towards the West, however, Kaunda visited the Soviet Union on state visits in 1974 and 1987. The Soviet embassy in Lusaka (now the Russian embassy) was the largest embassy in Southern Africa. Relations between the two countries soured in 1976, when Kaunda said on the Soviet and Cuban presence in Angola, \\"(t)hey drove colonialism and fascism out the front door, only to let a plundering tiger and its cubs in the back door.\\" Soviet support for the Zimbabwe African People's Union, which operated primarily out of Zambia, helped to stop relations from detiorating further, and ties became warmer after Abel Muzorewa, the Prime Minister of Zimbabwe Rhodesia launched airstrikes inside Zambia in 1979. After the strikes, Zambia unsuccessfully sought Western military aid, which saw Zambia turning to East Germany for military aid. In 1981, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the United National Independence Party established ties. Several Soviet delegations visited Lusaka with a view to turn UNIP into a Marxist-Leninist party, and UNIP officials made reciprocal visits to Moscow. The African National Congress moved its headquarters to Lusaka in 1984, and it was in Lusaka that the ANC devised strategy, with the covert assistance of Soviet military and intelligence personnel. In aid of this goal, the Soviet embassy in Lusaka was the largest in Southern Africa, and was staffed by 129 officials, including \\"approximately 25 KGB and GRU officials with diplomatic cover, and another 50 without\\". Military ties Between 1979 and 1983, the Soviet Union exported US$180 million in arms to Zambia, comprising seventy percent of Zambia's arms imports. Imports included MiG-21 fighter aircraft, tanks, armoured personnel carriers, S-125 surface-to-air missiles and radar equipment. To train Zambian Defence Force personnel to use and maintain the equipment, the Soviets had some 500 military personnel based in Zambia.

On 31 December 1991, Zambia recognised the Russian Federation as the successor state to the Soviet Union, after the latter's dissolution. Russia has an embassy in Lusaka, and Zambia has an embassy in Moscow. The current Ambassador of Russia to Zambia is Boris Malakhov, who was appointed by Russian President Dmitry Medvedev on 6 October 2008, and presented his Letters of Credence to President of Zambia Rupiah Banda on 22 January 2009. The current Ambassador of Zambia to Russia is Frederick Shumba Hapunda. ===Economic ties=== Trade and economic relations between Russia and Zambia are regulated by bilateral agreements; and a trade agreement signed by the Soviet and Zambian governments in Lusaka on 17 December 1971. In 2008, bilateral trade between Russia and Zambia increased from the 2007 level of US$11.4 million to US$17 million. Russian imports from Zambia were mainly of tobacco, and Russian exports to Zambia comprised agricultural machinery, motorcycles, and food. ===Cultural ties=== On 25 August 1966, the Soviet and Zambian governments signed an agreement on cultural co-operation, which carried over to the Russian Federation. A Russian Centre of Science and Culture opened in Lusaka in 1989. The centre, which operates within the framework of the Federal Agency for Commonwealth of Independent States, Compatriots Living Abroad and International Humanitarian Cooperation, and in co-operation with the Russian Embassy in Lusaka, carries out political activities with the aim of strengthening relations between Russia and Zambia, by providing the public with objective information on the domestic and foreign policies of Russia, and by providing Russian language training. As of 2013, approximately 1,450 Zambians are enrolled and studying in Russia, making Zambia the largest recipient of Russian government sponsored scholarships in sub-Sahara Africa. ==References * Documents on the Russia‚ÄìZambia relationship from the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs *Embassy of Russia in Lusaka Zambia Zambia Category:Bilateral relations of Zambia ","title":"Russia‚ÄìZambia relations"},{"id":"20154931","text":"\\"Let the Good Times Roll\\" is a jump blues song recorded in 1946 by Louis Jordan and his Tympany Five.

It belongs to the Oriental Art section of the museum. The Egyptian exposition is hosted in a single large hall on the ground floor on the eastern side of the Winter Palace. The hall serves as a passage to the exhibition of Classical Antiquities in other Hermitage buildings and is situated right under St. George's Hall. It was redesigned for the exhibition by Alexander Sivkov in 1940 and earlier served as the main buffet of the Winter Palace. ==History== Limestone stele of a chief potter, 18th century BC The collection was established in 1852, the year the museum was made open to the public, when it purchased the collection of statuettes from Countess Alexandra Lavalle, previously stored in her mansion on English Embankment, and received the items collected in Egypt by Maximilian, Duke of Leuchtenberg, including two black basalt sarcophagi of the Late Period, now displayed in the middle of the hall, as well as the sculpture group of Theban governor Amenemheb with his wife and mother (14th century BC). In 1853 the statue of Sekhmet (15th century BC), brought by Alexei Norov from Theban Necropolis of the Eleventh dynasty of Egypt in the 1830s, was moved from the Imperial Academy of Arts to the Hermitage. Some items were purchased for the museum from antiquities traders in Egypt and collections of Russian merchants or received as gifts. In 1862, the collection expanded significantly, as the Castiglione collection, which was purchased by the Imperial Academy of Sciences from Carlo Ottavio Castiglione in Milan in 1826 and consisted of more than 900 items, core of the Egyptian museum of the Kunstkamera, was transferred to the Hermitage. However, there were no Egyptologists in Russia at that time. Vladimir Golenishchev became the first Russian Egyptologist and started to work in the Hermitage in the 1870s. At the insistence of Golenishchev in 1881 the remainder of the Egyptian museum of the Kunstkamera was moved to the Hermitage. The Hermitage collection continued to grow in the 1880s, when Coptic written monuments and two fragments of Egyptian water clocks were acquired. In 1891, Golenishchev published the first complete inventory of the collection. Since the 1870s Golenishchev had collected an impressive private Egyptian collection, which was sold to the Pushkin Museum in Moscow in 1909, shortly before he emigrated. For a few years, as the building for the Moscow museum was being constructed, the items were also stored in the Hermitage. Soviet Orientalist Vasily Struve was in charge of the Hermitage's Egyptian collection from 1918 to 1933. The highlights of the exhibition include the mummy of priest Petese (10th century BC) and a fragment of a tablet of Ramesses II's Egyptian‚ÄìHittite peace treaty (13th century BC). ==Other Egyptian antiquities in Saint Petersburg== Other notable Egyptian antiquities in present-day Saint Petersburg include the two sphinxes of Pharaoh Amenhotep III, adorning the Quay with Sphinxes in front of the Academy of Arts Building on Universitetskaya Embankment since 1832. ==See also== * Oscar Eduardovich Lemm ==Further reading== *Bolshakov, Andrey O.

Other movie theater exhibitors commissioned film advertising but Madalena's work is the largest archive of this type of work to survive.Voice of Silent Era Film Still Makes Itself Heard, Nick Madigan, Daily Variety, July 9, 1988 == Early life == Batiste Madalena was born in Italy and immigrated to the United States in 1904.Paintings from a Picture Palace , by Judith Katten, American Heritage, December, 1983 He enrolled at the Mechanics Institute, later to become the Rochester Institute of Technology to study art. During his artistic training Madalena studied under influential advertising artist J. C. Leyendecker. In 1924 he had won just won a scholarship to the Art Students League of New York when he received a communication from inventor and photographic manufacturer George Eastman, who had just built the Eastman Theatre in Rochester, NY.Exhibit Pays Tribute to Movie Posters, by Yardena Arar, St. Petersburg Times (Florida), February 17, 1992 Boasting 3,350 seats, the Eastman Theatre was the third-largest cinema in the United States at the time and the flagship in a first-run chain of movie Theatres.Museum of Modern Art Press Release, October 10, 2008 == Work for the Eastman Theatre == Mr. Eastman disliked the publicity materials created by the movie studios and persuaded 22-year-old Madalena to postpone his studies and remain in Rochester to create original posters for his Theatre. \\"He told me, 'You do anything you want,' \\" Mr. Madalena recalled. \\"The only thing was, the posters had to be seen from the trolley car that stopped in front of the Theatre. The trolley was pretty far away, so the posters had to be big, not fancy and finicky. The point was to get people to cross the street and stop for a while at the Eastman.\\" Between 1924 and 1928 the artist created an average of seven posters a week, a total of about 1,400 posters for the Eastman Theatre. He was paid $4.50 per poster. The silent films he created advertisements for include Laugh, Clown, Laugh starring Lon Chaney, Madame Sans-Gene starring Gloria Swanson, and The Mysterious Lady starring Greta Garbo. == Technique == Madalena worked from publicity photographs sent to the Eastman Theatre by the movie studios. Each of his posters measured approximately 48\\" x 24\\" to fit into the theatre's glass covered advertising cases. He hand painted the images using gouache, tempera and conte crayon on posterboard. The influence of C. Coles Phillips ‚Äúfadeaway‚Äù style can be seen in some of Madalena's works, for example his poster for Up Stage with Norma Shearer. Other characteristics include bold colors and the use of stylish freehand lettering. In a review of Madalena's show at the Barnsdall Art Gallery, LA Times art critic William Wilson referenced the early Kandinsky as a predecessor of Madalena. == Later career == In 1928 Mr. Eastman sold his Theatre to the Paramount-Publix chain and the original advertisement scheme was abandoned. That same year Mr. Madalena opened his own commercial art studio where he worked until his retirement in the late 1960s. == Rediscovery == A few weeks after he left the employ of the Eastman Theatre, Madalena happened to pass the building. \\"I'd been at the Y.M.C.A. for a cup of coffee,\\" he said. '\\"On my way back, it was raining, and I cut through behind the Theatre. That's when I saw my posters, thrown out with the trash. It made me sore,\\" he said. \\"They were soaking. They messed up the best ones. I cleaned and saved the ones I could. But later, I couldn't bother with them. I had other things to do.\\"One Artist‚Äôs View of 1920‚Äôs Flicks, by Douglas C. McGill, The New York Times, March 17, 1986 The 225 paintings the artist was able to save remained in storage in Madalena's attic until 1973. With the encouragement of his children Rita and Richard, Madalena entered some of the posters in a local art show in 1975. Los Angeles documentary film maker, Steven Katten, was visiting Rochester that week for a filmmakers' convention. Just as they had been designed to do nearly 50 years before, the posters caught his eye from the sidewalk. \\"I was struck by them,'\\" he said. \\"They were powerful. I went back to Los Angeles, but I found that I kept thinking about these things. Every time I saw another movie poster, I unconsciously compared it to them. After a time, I called Mr. Madalena from Los Angeles and said, 'Listen, let's talk.' \\" Mr. Katten and his wife, Judith, bought the entire poster collection for an undisclosed sum. Steven and Judith Katten periodically loan the artwork to museums and galleries. They have also donated some of Madalena's work to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. == Exhibitions == Steven and Judith Katten arranged a traveling exhibit of the paintings through the Art Museum Association that ran into 1985. In the March 1986, Hirschl & Adler Galleries of New York City organized the first exhibit of Madalena's work in Manhattan. Exhibitions of Madalena's art at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences included a February 1992 showing of 20 paintings and a July 1998 exhibition showcasing 70 of Madalena's posters. In October 2008 the Museum of Modern Art in New York City organized Batiste Madalena: Hand-Painted Film Posters for the Eastman Theatre, 1924‚Äì1928, from October 2009 to April 2010. The show included 53 posters along with screenings of some of the films the posters were created to advertise. ==Notes  References == * Batiste Madalena: Poster Paintings for the Movies, Hirschl & Adler Galleries, 1986 * Movie Posters: The Paintings of Batiste Madalena, by Batiste Madalena and Judith Katten, 1986 * Now Playing: Hand-Painted Poster Art from the 1910s through the 1950s, by Anthony Slide, 2007 Category:1902 births Category:1988 deaths Category:American artists Category:American poster artists ","title":"Batiste Madalena"},{"id":"20155033","text":"Mister Guitar is the eleventh studio album recorded by guitarist Chet Atkins, released in 1959.

He was married for a time to American photographer Dorothea Lange. Together with Fernand Lungren (1857-1932), another California (i.e. Santa Barbara, California) based artist, Maynard Dixon is considered one of the finest artists having dedicated most of their art on the U.S. southwestern cultures and landscapes at the end of the nineteenth century and the first half of the twentieth century. \\"Thunder Over Ship Rock\\" Steven Stern Fine Arts Maynard Dixon \\"Rattlesnake Ridge\\" (1942) ==Biography== Dixon was born in Fresno, California, into a family of aristocratic Virginia Confederates who had found a new home there after the American Civil War. His mother, Constance Maynard, a well-educated daughter of a Navy officer from San Francisco, shared her love of classic literature with the young boy and encouraged him in his writing and drawing. His father was Harry St. John Dixon. Dixon moved to San Francisco and studied briefly in 1893 with Arthur Mathews at the California School of Design where he became a close friend of the Tonalist painter Xavier Martinez, with whom he traveled to Monterey, Carmel, and Point Lobos. In 1900 Dixon visited Arizona and Mexico and a year later he accompanied artist Edward Borein on a horseback trip through several western states. Also in 1900 Dixon arranged for the debut exhibition of the soon-to-be-famous sculptor Arthur Putnam in the ‚Äújinks room‚Äù of the San Francisco Press Club. Dixon's sketching trip thru Arizona and Guadalajara in March and April 1905 with Martinez garnered much attention in the press. Dixon moved into Martinez's Montgomery Street atelier; their joint studio exhibitions were usually held on Saturdays. An online facsimile of the entire text of Vol. 1 is posted on the Traditional Fine Arts Organization website. To insure a steady income he worked as an illustrator for local newspapers and magazines (including the Overland Monthly and Sunset magazine), and illustrated numerous books, such as Clarence E. Mulford‚Äôs Hopalong Cassidy. For his first exhibition in the southwest Dixon contributed four oils to the show of Modern Art From The American West curated by the well-known impressionist Jennie V. Cannon at the University of Arizona in Tucson in December of 1912. In 1917 to support America‚Äôs entry into World War I Maynard Dixon joined Lee F. Randolph, Bruce Nelson, and other prominent artists on a committee to redesign the U.S. Army camouflage. During his long tenure in northern California he became a prolific contributor to art exhibitions. His first publicized exhibition was a show of ‚Äúregional artists‚Äù in Alameda, California during the spring of 1899.Alameda Daily Argus: 29 April 1899, p.1, p. 19; 9 May 1899, p.1; 17 May 1899, p.1 Thereafter he exhibited at almost every major venue: California Society of Artists (1902); Bohemian Club (1903-1928); San Francisco Art Association (1903-1931); Newspaper Artists League (1903); Press Club (1904); Hotel Del Monte Art Gallery (1907-1909); Panama-Pacific International Exposition (1915); Gump's Gallery (1920 ‚Äì solo exhibition); San Francisco Print Rooms (1920 ‚Äì this show was later sent to Honolulu); San Francisco's Don Lee Galleries (1923); Oakland Art Gallery (1926-1928); Galerie Beaux Arts (1925-1930); University of California, Berkeley (1928); California State Fair (1928); and Golden Gate International Exposition (1939). In March 1926 he acted as co-curator with Laura Adams Armer for an exhibit of ‚ÄúPueblo and Navajo Arts & Crafts‚Äù at the Paul Elder Gallery of San Francisco under the under the auspices of the Indian Defense Association of Central and Northern California. In 1927 Dixon joined several prominent artists in a boycott of the Bohemian Club Annual Exhibition when works of the more ‚Äúmodern‚Äù artists were excluded. During February 1930 he was one of a handful of artists, which included Ralph Stackpole, Otis Oldfield, Helen Katharine Forbes, and several others, who contributed to a Galerie Beaux Arts show where the subject of every painting was the same female model. During the summer of 1931 he exhibited with the most prominent artists of the west, including William Ritschel, Armin Hansen, Granville Redmond, and Leland Curtis, at the Tahoe Tavern on Lake Tahoe. Between 1935 and 1943 he was a member of the Society of the Thirteen Watercolorists that exhibited at the: San Francisco Museum of Art, California Palace of the Legion of Honor (museum), Stanford University Art Gallery; and the de Young Museum. For a time he lived in New York with his young wife and baby daughter Constance, but soon returned to the western United States where he said he could create \\"honest art of the west\\" instead of the romanticized versions he was being paid to create. Shortly after he began a new life in San Francisco, his first marriage ended. Dixon developed his style during this early period, and western themes became a trademark for him. In San Francisco, Dixon was considered a colorful character with a good sense of humor. He often dressed like a cowboy and seemed determined to impart a western style, most often in the form of a black Stetson hat, boots, and a bola tie. Dixon contributed to the murals that adorn a banquet hall at the Mark Hopkins Hotel, including that of Queen Califia shown accompanied by two of her woman warriors Influenced in part by the Panama Pacific International Exposition of 1915, Dixon began to search for a new expression, moving away from impressionism and into a simpler, more modern style. Meeting and marrying Dorothea Lange, a portrait photographer from the east, had a great influence on his art. They married in 1920 and by 1925, the year their first son Daniel Rhoades Dixon was born, Maynard's style had changed dramatically to even more powerful compositions, with the emphasis on design, color, and self-expression. A true modernist emerged. The power of low horizons and marching cloud formations, simplified, and distilled, became his own brand and at once were both bold and mysterious. In 1929 his second son was born, John Eaglefeather Dixon. During the Great Depression, Dixon painted a series of social realism canvases depicting the prevailing politics of maritime strikes, displaced workers, and those affected by the depression. Simultaneously, Lange captured on film images of the migrant workers in the Salinas Valley and the city breadlines, images that eventually brought her fame. In 1933 the Dixons spent the summer in Zion National Park with sojourns to the hamlet of Mount Carmel, Utah. Lange was called back to San Francisco, a separation that led to the couple's divorce in 1935. Maynard Dixon Home Two years later, Dixon married San Francisco muralist Edith Hamlin. The couple left San Francisco two years later for southern Utah, the source of some of Dixon's greatest art. In 1939, the couple built a summer home in Mount Carmel, where Dixon found new friends and became reacquainted with the local natural landscapes. He lived near the cottonwood trees along an old irrigation ditch and took short hikes to a plateau where he loved the quiet. Dixon spent winter months in Tucson, where the couple also had a home and studio. Dixon continued to create simple but powerful compositions in which non-essential elements were distilled or eliminated. In 1946, Maynard died at his winter home in Tucson. In the spring of 1947, his widow Edith brought his ashes to Mount Carmel where she buried them on a high bluff above the art studio being built on the property. This had been at his request and she felt it a fitting tribute where friends could come to pay respects and view the land that he loved. In addition to painting, he also wrote poetry. An article in the California Historical Quarterly described his poetry as \\"very competent and sometimes superb\\". ==Legacy== There are two museums devoted to Maynard Dixon and his works. The Maynard and Edith Hamlin Dixon House and Studio, operated by the Thunderbird Foundation, offers guided tours by appointment of his home and studio in Mount Carmel, Utah. The foundation is working to establish a separate museum and regional art center that would feature works by Maynard Dixon and his circle, Milford Zornes and his circle, as well as contemporary work by local artists. The Maynard Dixon Museum is located inside the Mark Sublette Medicine Man Gallery in Tucson, Arizona. Works by the artist include paintings, watercolors, pastels, drawings, poetry, and illustrations.https://www.maynarddixon.org/ The world's largest collection of Dixon's works is owned by Brigham Young University, where it can be viewed at the Museum of Art.https://moa.byu.edu/maynard-dixon-highlights/ ==Exhibitions== * \\"Maynard Dixon's American West,\\" Western Spirit: Scottsdale Museum of the West, Oct 2019 - July 2020 * \\"Along the Distant Mesa: An Homage to Maynard Dixon\\", Medicine Man Gallery, Tucson, Arizona, March-April 2019 * \\"Maynard Dixon‚Äôs New Mexico Centennial\\", El Museo Cultural - Objects of Art, Santa Fe, New Mexico.

From January 1991 to August 1995, he held various positions within the government of the Serbian Autonomous Region of Krajina, which later evolved into the Republic of Serbian Krajina (RSK), including Chief of the Police in Knin, Secretary for Internal Affairs of the SAO Krajina, Deputy Commander of the Territorial Defense of the SAO Krajina, Minister of Defense of the SAO Krajina, Minister of the Interior of the SAO Krajina and of the RSK and, from 25 January 1994 onwards, President of the RSK.Trial Judgment, paras 445-46. The events giving rise to this trial took place between August 1991 and December 1995 in the SAO Krajina and the RSK. The Trial Chamber found that Martiƒá participated in a joint criminal enterprise (JCE) with other individuals, the common purpose of which was the establishment of an ethnically Serb territory through the displacement of the non-Serb population. Martiƒá participated in the JCE by providing substantive financial, logistical and military support to the SAO Krajina and the RSK, by actively working together with the other JCE participants to fulfill the objective of a united Serb state, by exercising his authority over the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MUP) of the SAO Krajina and the RSK, by fuelling an atmosphere of insecurity and fear through public statements, and by participating in the forcible removal of the non-Serb population. ==Trial court== The trial lasted for 143 days. During the trial the prosecution called 45 witnesses and had 901 exhibits.See Case information Sheet. The defense presented 22 witnesses and had 90 exhibits. The Trial Chamber concluded that Martiƒá incurred individual criminal responsibility pursuant to Article 7(1) of the Tribunal‚Äôs Statute (\\"Statute\\").ICTY Statute.

The Trial Chamber concluded that the crimes fell within the common purpose of the JCE, or were \\"foreseeable to Martiƒá\\", and convicted Martiƒá under the basic form of JCE for Counts 10, 11, and 1 (in part) and under the extended form of JCE for Counts 3 to 9, 12 to 14 and 1 (in part).Trial Judgment, paras 452-455. The Trial Chamber acquitted Martiƒá of Count 2, extermination as a crime against humanity.Trial Judgment, paras 406, 517. The Trial Chamber further found that Martiƒá ordered the shelling of Zagreb on 2 and 3 May 1995 with Orkan Rockets, containing cluster munitions. It held that he incurred individual criminal responsibility pursuant to Article 7(1) of the Statute for ordering under Count 15, murder as a crime against humanity; Count 16, murder as a violation of the laws or customs of war; Count 17, inhumane acts as a crime against humanity; Count 18, cruel treatment as a violation of the laws or customs of war; and Count 19, attacks on civilians as a violation of the laws or customs of war.Trial Judgment, paras 460, 470-473 and 518.

On 21 May 2002, during his initial appearance, and then again on 23 January 2003 he pleaded not guilty to all the charges held against him in the indictment. The trial commenced before the ICTY on 13 December 2005. ==Appeals Chamber== The Appeals Chamber of the ICTY accepted appeals from both Martiƒá and the Prosecutor. The Defense requested a finding of not guilty or a re-trial on the basis of alleged errors of law and fact. The Prosecution presented one ground of appeal, asking for a revision of the sentence due to an alleged error of law. Appeals hearings took place on 25-26 June 2008. The Appeals Chamber dismissed nine grounds of Martiƒá‚Äôs appeal and accepted two sub-grounds of the fifth ground of appeal, reversing Martiƒá‚Äôs convictions relating to specific alleged crimes committed in Benkovac, Cerovljani, Vukoviƒái, and Poljanak. The Appeals Chamber rejected Martiƒá‚Äôs argument that the Trial Chamber erred in failing to take into account relevant contextual factors, in particular, the political objectives of the Serb leadership. The Appeals Chamber granted the Prosecution‚Äôs sole ground of appeal in which it claimed that the Trial Chamber erred in law when it found that persons hors de combat, i.e., soldiers who are incapable of taking part in the hostilities (for example because injured or detained), could not be victims of crimes against humanity. The Appeals Chamber concluded that the reversals on appeal did not warrant a reduction in sentence. On 8 October 2008 the Appeals chamber upheld the Trial Chamber‚Äôs ruling. In June 2009 he was transferred to Tartu Vangla prison in Estonia serve out his sentence.

Founded by Dr. Birute Galdikas, one of three anthropologists (The Trimates) to study great apes under the guidance of Dr. Louis Leakey, OFI continues to rescue and rehabilitate orangutans, preparing them for release back into protected areas of the Indonesian rain forest. In addition, OFI promotes the preservation of rain forest, an issue that continues to be of interest in various publications such as the New York Times (January 25, 2007), Los Angeles Times (October 19, 2008), and National Geographic Magazine (November 2008: \\"Borneo's Moment of Truth.\\") OrangutanP1 Orangutan Foundation International, originally called the Orangutan Research and Conservation Project, was founded by Dr. Birut√© Mary Galdikas and former husband Rod Brindamour in 1986. The couple started the project to study the ecology and behavior of wild orangutans. The focus later turned towards conservation, protection, rehabilitation, and education of orangutans, which has been an area of interest in various publications including New York Times (January 25, 2007), Los Angeles Times(October 19, 2008), and National Geographic Magazine (November 2008: \\"Borneo's Moment of Truth.\\") The OFI's research facilities are located in the Indonesian owned part of Borneo,the third largest island in the world. Camp Leakey is where the research on orangutans is conducted and also where rehabilitated orangutans are released. ==Mission== The Orangutan Foundation International's mission is to: Support protection, conservation, and understanding about orangutans and their natural habitat while caring for orphaned orangutans and helping them make the transition back into the rain forest. The OFI also educates the public and the government about orangutans, rain forest, and the issues around conservation and protection of the apes and their environment. ==History== The Orangutan Foundation International was founded in 1986 by Dr. Birute Galdikas. The precursor to the OFI was the Orangutan Research and Conservation Project (ORCP), founded in 1971 by Galdikas with the help of Louis Leakey as moral and financial support. While working toward her Ph.D at UCLA, Dr. Galdikas went to see Leakey who was a guest speaker at the school. During the presentation Galdikas learned that Leakey had sponsored both Jane Goodall and Dian Fossey who also worked with primates and decided to ask him to sponsor her as well. Leakey agreed, and Galdikas, Goodall, and Fossey became The Trimates. In honor of Leakey, Galdikas' named the base camp Camp Leakey. The first work of the ORCP was taking orangutans that were being kept as pets from government officials and others. The formation of the ORCP gave Dr. Galdikas the opportunity to conduct 100,000 hours of observation of orangutans. In 1986, the ORCP morphed in the OFI. The new insight from Galdikas' research with the Asian Ape (orangutan) drew a lot of media attention. Galdikas' found that she needed something to turn the attention into positive action and created the OFI. The OFI's goals were a little bit different from its mother. The OFI is \\"aimed specifically at conservation, rehabilitation, research, and education\\". Lawyer John Beal visited Camp Leakey in 1979 and after his return to the United States, aided Galdikas' and others in the establishment of The Orangutan Foundation in Los Angeles, California which is headquarters for the OFI ==Camp Leakey== What started out to be just two small huts is now a functional research facility. Camp Leakey is where all of the research the OFI conducts on orangutans is done. Others other than the OFI have studied and researched at Camp Leakey including graduate and undergraduate students from multiple institutions such as Universitas Nasional, a college in Indonesia, and universities in the United States. The camp now consists of about 19 miles of trails, rainforest, and swamp land for the rehabilitated orangutans and the wild orangutans that made their home there. The OFI takes in ex-captive, hurt, and orphaned orangutans. Once the ape is in the care of the Dr. Galdikas and her staff, it is raised (if it is young) or treated for any diseases or injuries in the Care Center. The orangutans in the care center are taken each day by their keepers to Camp Leakey to be allowed to play in their natural habitat. This is done to slowly acclimate the orangutans back into the forest so one day they can be released. Once the orangutan is old enough and deemed suitable, it is released back into the wild. Some orangutans never learn to fend for themselves and for that reason can never leave the care center and the staff. Some orangutans do not want to leave the base of the OFI (where the staff eats and lives) and will venture back from time to time to visit the staff and volunteers. ==Controversy== The efforts of Dr. Galdikas and staff have brought about some controversy. An article from Nature says, \\"The orphaned apes were often psychologically damaged and difficult to control. Some even attacked guests and staffers.\\" Some researchers questioned the value of the information gained from studying the orphaned apes. The critics question if the behavior of the apes mirrors that of a wild orangutan or not. Other people began wondering if the released orangutans would transmit diseases brought by people to the wild orangutan population. ==OFI in the media== *IMAX film: Born to be Wild ==Sister organizations and partners== *Orangutan Foundation Canada *Australian Orangutan Project *Birut√© Galdikas Ecology and Support Foundation ==See also== *InfiniteEARTH ==References External links == * Orangutan Foundation International *Star Bulletin story about Rusti (an orangutan) and the OFI *Smithsonian Magazine article about OFI. *mongabay.com article about Dr. Galdikas and her work. *Science.ca profile for Dr. Biru√© Mary Galdikas and her work *Muskingum University page about Dr. Galdikas Category:International environmental organizations Category:Environmental organizations based in California Category:Nature conservation organizations based in the United States Category:Animal welfare organizations based in the United States Category:Orangutan conservation ","title":"Orangutan Foundation International"},{"id":"20155110","text":"Detour for Emmy is a young adult novel by Marilyn Reynolds.

Accessed 10 November 2008. ==Naval career== After the outbreak of the Second World War, Adams was assigned to the destroyer . On 11 September 1939, Walker ran down and went through her sister ship, , and was jammed in her. As the weather and conditions were good, both ships were able to be saved. During the crisis, Adams carried Vanquishers safe with its confidential material inside to the deck of Walker, but found that after the situation had calmed down the next morning that he was unable to lift it. He served on the in 1941 and saw action in the Western Approaches of the coast of Great Britain, as part of the St. Nazaire Raid and the landings of Allied troops in North Africa and Sicily. He underwent training and qualified as a torpedo and electrics specialist in 1943, and was able to use this knowledge to prepare escorts for convoys crossing the North Atlantic. On 15 December 1942 he was Mentioned in Despatches for his actions aboard Cleveland in an engagement with E-Boats. After the war, he commanded the destroyer and served in the Admiralty's torpedo and anti-submarine warfare division, among other staff appointments. He was promoted to lieutenant commander on 1 June 1948, and commander on 31 December 1950. He was then given command of the Royal Yacht Britannia, which included taking Princess Margaret to the West Indies, Queen Elizabeth II to Portugal and a world tour for Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, serving from 1954 to 1957. As a result, he was appointed a Member of the Fourth Class of the Royal Victorian Order in the 1957 Queen's Birthday Honours. Membership of the Fourth Class was subsequently renamed as Lieutenant of the Royal Victorian Order, entitling holders to the postnominal letters LVO. He was promoted captain on 31 December 1956. Adams commanded from May 1964 to January 1966. The ship was deployed in the Indian Ocean and the Far East. She arrived east of Suez with 848 Naval Air Squadron and a strong force of Royal Marines. During the Indonesia‚ÄìMalaysia confrontation, Albion sent two flights of Wessex helicopters to support marine and army border patrols from bases in Borneo and Sarawak. He was promoted rear admiral on 7 January 1966. In 1966, serving as Assistant Chief of Naval Staff (Policy), Adams was assigned to the Ministry of Defence and became chairman of the Future Fleet Working Party, reporting to Admiral of the Fleet Sir Varyl Begg. Building on his experience with the Albion, Adams' working party recommended a \\"through-deck cruiser\\" that would carry vertical take-off jet fighters and deploy helicopters, insisting that this approach was the logical conclusion of his research. Begg, who believed that missiles would replace planes, exploded with anger and rejected Adams's report publicly. Begg told him that he would never be employed again. Adams retired on 12 February 1968, and was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) in that year's Queen's Birthday Honours, but was invited to the launch of the aircraft carrier in 1977, which was a vindication of his approach. ==Company director and later life== After leaving the Royal Navy, Adams served as Director of the Paper and Paper Products Industry Training Board from 1968 to 1971. From 1972 to 1973, he was Director of the Employers' Federation of Papermakers and Boardmakers and then served from 1974 to 1983 as Director General of the British Paper and Board Industry Federation. Adams was the author of The Adventure of Charlie the Cone, stories about a traffic cone that he made up for his children during long car trips. He married the former Mary Parker in 1943.

Its migration followed the sea and land trading routes of the medieval world. This migration has been studied for centuries as an example of how the spread of contagious diseases is impacted by human society and economics. The disease is caused by Yersinia pestis, which is enzootic (commonly present) in populations of ground rodents in Central Asia. Morelli et al. (2010) reported the origin of the plague bacillus to be in China. An older theory places the first cases in the steppes of Central Asia, and others, such as the historian Michael W. Dols, argue that the historical evidence concerning epidemics in the Mediterranean and specifically the Plague of Justinian point to a probability that the Black Death originated in Central Asia,http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/206309.php where it then became entrenched among the rodent population.Michael W. Dols, \\"The Second Plague Pandemic and Its Recurrences in the Middle East: 1347‚Äì1894\\" Journal of the Economic Social History of the Orientvol. 22 no. 2 (May 1979), 170‚Äì171. Nevertheless, from Central Asia it was carried east and west along the Silk Road, by Mongol armies and traders making use of the opportunities of free passage within the Mongol Empire offered by the Pax Mongolica. It was reportedly first introduced to Europe at the trading city of Caffa in the Crimea in 1347.Biological Warfare at the 1346 Siege of Caffa. Emerging Infectious Diseases, 8 (9), 971-975. https://dx.doi.org/10.3201/eid0809.010536. The Genoese traders fled, bringing the plague by ship into Sicily and the south of Europe, whence it spread. ==Preexisting conditions== Regardless of its origin, it is clear that several preexisting conditions such as war, famine, and weather contributed to the severity of the Black Death. In China, the 13th-century Mongol conquest disrupted farming and trading, and led to widespread famine. The population dropped from approximately 120 to 60 million.Ping-ti Ho, \\"An Estimate of the Total Population of Sung-Chin China\\", in √âtudes Song, Series 1, No 1, (1970) pp. 33‚Äì53. In Northern Europe, new technological innovations such as the heavy plough and the three-field system were not as effective in clearing new fields for harvest as they were in the Mediterranean because the north had poor, clay-like soil. Food shortages and skyrocketing prices were a fact of life for as much as a century before the plague. Wheat, oats, hay, and consequently livestock, were all in short supply, and their scarcity resulted in hunger and malnutrition. The result was a mounting human vulnerability to disease due to weakened immune systems. The Medieval Warm Period ended in Europe sometime in the 13th century, bringing harsher winters and reduced harvests. Heavy rains in late 1314 began several years of cold and wet winters. The already weak harvests of the north suffered. In the years 1315 to 1317, a catastrophic famine, known as the Great Famine, struck much of Northwest Europe. The famine came about as the result of a large population growth in the previous centuries, with the result that, in the early 14th century the population exceeded the number that could be sustained by farming. The Great Famine was the worst in European history, reducing the population by at least ten percent. Records recreated from dendrochronological studies show a hiatus in building construction during the period, as well as a deterioration in climate. This was the economic and social situation in which the predictor of the coming disaster, a typhoid epidemic, emerged. Many thousands died in populated urban centres, most significantly Ypres. In 1318 a pestilence of unknown origin, sometimes identified as anthrax, affected the animals of Europe, notably sheep and cattle, further reducing the food supply and income of the peasantry. The European economy entered a vicious circle in which hunger and chronic, low-level debilitating disease reduced the productivity of labourers, and so the grain output was reduced, causing grain prices to increase. This situation was worsened when landowners and monarchs like Edward III of England (r. 1327‚Äì1377) and Philip VI of France (r. 1328‚Äì1350), out of a fear that their comparatively high standard of living would decline, raised the fines and rents of their tenants.Bennett and Hollister, Medieval Europe, p. 327 Standards of living then fell drastically, diets grew more limited, and Europeans as a whole experienced more health problems. ==Asian outbreak== Charles Creighton, in his History of Epidemics in Britain (1891), describes the tendency to retrospectively describe the origins of the Black Death in China despite evidence for it: \\"In that nebulous and unsatisfactory state the old tradition of the Black Death originating in China has remained to the present hour\\".Charles Creighton's A History of Epidemics in Britain, Cambridge: At the University Press. 1891. pg 143. In fact, Creighton provides extensive evidence that the outbreaks that were consistent with the European disease post-date the European epidemic by several years.Charles Creighton's A History of Epidemics in Britain, Cambridge: At the University Press. 1891. pg 153. On the heels of the European epidemic, a widespread disaster occurred in China during 1353‚Äì1354. Chinese accounts of this wave of the disease record a spread to eight distinct areas: Hubei, Jiangxi, Shanxi, Hunan, Guangdong, Guangxi, Henan, and Suiyuan,Suiyuan was a historical Chinese province that now forms part of Hebei and Inner Mongolia. throughout the Mongol and Chinese empires. Historian William McNeill noted that voluminous Chinese records on disease and social disruption survive from this period, but no one has studied these sources in depth.McNeill, William H. (1976). Plagues and People. New York: Anchor Books. . It is probable that the Mongols and merchant caravans that were poorly quarantined and underreported by the Mongol government inadvertently brought the plague from central Asia to the Middle East and Europe. The plague was reported in the trading cities of Constantinople and Trebizond in 1344. ==European outbreak== The Black Death rapidly spread along the major European sea and land trade routes In October 1347, a fleet of Genovese trading ships fleeing Caffa reached the port of Messina in Sicily.\\"At the beginning of October, in the year of the incarnation of the Son of God 1347, twelve Genoese galleys were fleeing from the vengeance which our Lord was taking on account of their nefarious deeds and entered the harbour of Messina. In their bones they bore so virulent a disease that anyone who only spoke to them was seized by a mortal illness and in no manner could evade death. ...Not only all those who had speech with them died, but also those who had touched or used any of their things. When the inhabitants of Messina discovered that this sudden death emanated from the Genoese ships they hurriedly ordered them out of the harbor and town. But the evil remained and caused a fearful outbreak of death.\\" Michael Platiensis (1357), quoted in Johannes Nohl (1926). The Black Death, trans. C.H. Clarke. London: George Allen & Unwin Ltd., pp. 18‚Äì20. By the time the fleet reached Messina, all the crew members were either infected or dead. It is presumed that the ships also carried infected rats and/or fleas. Some ships were found grounded on shorelines, with no one aboard remaining alive. Looting of these lost ships also helped spread the disease. From there, the plague spread to Genoa and Venice by the turn of 1347‚Äì1348, spreading across Italy. From Italy the disease spread northwest across Europe, striking France, the Crown of Aragon, the Crown of Castile, Portugal and England by June 1348, then turned and spread east through Germany and Scandinavia from 1348 to 1350. It was introduced in Norway in 1349 when a ship landed at Ask√∏y, then proceeded to spread to Bj√∏rgvin (modern Bergen). From Norway it continued to Sweden, by which point it hade already spread around Denmark. Finally it spread to north- eastern Russia in 1351; however, the plague largely spared some parts of Europe, including the Kingdom of Poland, isolated parts of Belgium and the Netherlands, Milan and the modern-day France-Spain border. At Siena, Agnolo di Tura wrote: ==Middle Eastern outbreak== The plague struck various countries in the Middle East during the pandemic, leading to serious depopulation and permanent change in both economic and social structures. As it spread to western Europe, the disease also entered the region from southern Russia. By autumn 1347, the plague reached Alexandria in Egypt, probably through the port's trade with Constantinople, and ports on the Black Sea. During 1348, the disease travelled eastward to Gaza, and north along the eastern coast to cities including Ashkelon, Acre, Jerusalem, Sidon, Damascus, Homs, and Aleppo. In 1348‚Äì49, the disease reached Antioch. The city's residents fled to the north, most of them dying during the journey, but the infection had been spread to the people of Asia Minor. Mecca became infected in 1349. During the same year, records show the city of Mawsil (Mosul) suffered a massive epidemic, and the city of Baghdad experienced a second round of the disease. In 1351, Yemen experienced an outbreak of the plague. This coincided with the return of King Mujahid of Yemen from imprisonment in Cairo. His party may have brought the disease with them from Egypt. ==Recurrence== In England, in the absence of census figures, historians propose a range of pre-incident population figures from as high as 7 million to as low as 4 million in 1300, and a post-incident population figure as low as 2 million.Secondary sources such as the Cambridge History of Medieval England often contain discussions of methodology in reaching these figures that are necessary reading for anyone wishing to understand this controversial episode in more detail. By the end of 1350 the Black Death had subsided, but it never really died out in England over the next few hundred years: there were further outbreaks in 1361‚Äì62, 1369, 1379‚Äì83, 1389‚Äì93, and throughout the first half of the 15th century. The plague often killed 10% of a community in less than a year‚Äîin the worst epidemics, such as at Norwich in 1579 and Newcastle in 1636, as many as 30 or 40%. The most general outbreaks in Tudor and Stuart England, all coinciding with years of plague in Germany and the Low Countries, seem to have begun in 1498, 1535, 1543, 1563, 1589, 1603, 1625, and 1636. The plague repeatedly returned to haunt Europe and the Mediterranean throughout the 14th to 18th centuries, and still occurs in isolated cases today. The plague of 1575‚Äì77 claimed some 50,000 victims in Venice. In 1634, an outbreak of plague killed 15,000 Munich residents. Late outbreaks in central Europe include the Italian Plague of 1629‚Äì1631, which is associated with troop movements during the Thirty Years' War, and the Great Plague of Vienna in 1679. About 200,000 people in Moscow died of the disease from 1654 to 1656. Oslo was last ravaged in 1654. In 1656 the plague killed about half of Naples' 300,000 inhabitants. Amsterdam was ravaged in 1663‚Äì1664, with a mortality given as 50,000. The Great Plague of London in 1665‚Äì1666 is generally recognized as one of the last major outbreaks. A plague epidemic known as the Great Northern War plague outbreak, that followed the Great Northern War (1700‚Äì1721, Sweden v. Russia and allies) wiped out almost 1/3 of the population in the region. An estimated one-third of East Prussia's population died in the plague of 1709‚Äì1711. The plague of 1710 killed two-thirds of the inhabitants of Helsinki. An outbreak of plague between 1710 and 1711 claimed a third of Stockholm's population. During the Great Plague of 1738, the epidemic struck again, this time in Eastern Europe, spreading from Ukraine to the Adriatic Sea, then onwards by ship to infect some in Tunisia. The destruction in several cities in what is now Romania (such as Timi»ôoara) was formidable, claiming tens of thousands of lives. ==References== Migration Category:Second plague pandemic ","title":"Black Death migration"},{"id":"20155307","text":"Motherwell Shopping Centre is an outdoor shopping centre located in the centre of Motherwell, North Lanarkshire, Scotland.

A number of epidemiologists and since the 1980s have challenged the traditional view that the Black Death was caused by plague based on the type and spread of the disease. The confirmation in 2010 and 2011 that Yersinia pestis DNA was associated with a large number of plague sites has renewed focus on plague as the leading hypothesis, but has not yet led to a final resolution of all these questions. ==Plague== Yersinia pestis seen at 2000√ó magnification. This bacterium, carried and spread by fleas, is generally thought to have been the cause of millions of deaths. Several possible causes have been advanced for the Black Death; the most prevalent is the bubonic plague theory. Efficient transmission of Yersinia pestis is generally thought to occur only through the bites of fleas whose mid guts become obstructed by replicating Y. pestis several days after feeding on an infected host. This blockage results in starvation and aggressive feeding behaviour by fleas that repeatedly attempt to clear their blockage by regurgitation, resulting in thousands of plague bacteria being flushed into the feeding site, infecting the host. However, modelling of epizootic plague observed in prairie dogs, suggests that occasional reservoirs of infection such as an infectious carcass, rather than \\"blocked fleas\\" are a better explanation for the observed epizootic behaviour of the disease in nature. One hypothesis about the epidemiology‚Äîthe appearance, spread, and especially disappearance‚Äîof plague from Europe is that the flea-bearing rodent reservoir of disease was eventually succeeded by another species. The black rat (Rattus rattus) was originally introduced from Asia to Europe by trade, but was subsequently displaced and succeeded throughout Europe by the bigger brown rat (Rattus norvegicus). The brown rat was not as prone to transmit the germ-bearing fleas to humans in large die-offs due to a different rat ecology. The dynamic complexities of rat ecology, herd immunity in that reservoir, interaction with human ecology, secondary transmission routes between humans with or without fleas, human herd immunity, and changes in each might explain the eruption, dissemination, and re-eruptions of plague that continued for centuries until its unexplained disappearance. ===Signs and symptoms of the three forms of plague=== The plague comes in three forms and it brought an array of signs and symptoms to those infected. The classic sign of bubonic plague was the appearance of buboes in the groin, the neck, and armpits, which oozed pus and bled. Most victims died within four to seven days after infection. The septicaemic plague is a form of \\"blood poisoning\\", and pneumonic plague is an airborne plague that attacks the lungs before the rest of the body. The bubonic plague was the most commonly seen form during the Black Death. The bubonic form of the plague has a mortality rate of thirty to seventy-five percent and symptoms include fever of 38‚Äì41 ¬∞C (101‚Äì105 ¬∞F), headaches, painful aching joints, nausea and vomiting, and a general feeling of malaise. The second most common form is the pneumonic plague and has symptoms that include fever, cough, and blood-tinged sputum. As the disease progressed, sputum became free flowing and bright red and death occurred within 2 days. The pneumonic form of the plague has a high mortality rate at ninety to ninety-five percent. Septicemic plague is the least common of the three forms, with a mortality rate close to one hundred percent. Symptoms include high fevers and purple skin patches (purpura due to DIC). Both pneumonic and septicemic plague can be caused by flea bites when the lymph nodes are overwhelmed. In this case they are referred to as secondary forms of the disease. David HerlihyHerlihy, The Black Death and the Transformation of the West (1997) Harvard University Press: Cambridge, MA, p. 29. identifies from the records another potential sign of the plague: freckle-like spots and rashes. Sources from Viterbo, Italy refer to \\"the signs which are vulgarly called lenticulae\\", a word which bears resemblance to the Italian word for freckles, lentiggini. These are not the swellings of buboes, but rather \\"darkish points or pustules which covered large areas of the body\\". The uncharacteristically rapid spread of the plague could be due to respiratory droplet transmission, and low levels of immunity in the European population at that period. Historical examples of pandemics of other diseases in populations without previous exposure, such as smallpox and tuberculosis transmitted by aerosol amongst Native Americans, show that the first instance of an epidemic spreads faster and is far more virulent than later instances among the descendants of survivors, for whom natural selection has produced characteristics that are protective against the disease. ===Molecular evidence for Y. pestis=== In 2000, Didier Raoult and others reported finding Y. pestis DNA by performing a \\"suicide PCR\\" on tooth pulp tissue from a fourteenth- century plague cemetery in Montpellier. Drancourt and Raoult reported similar findings in a 2007 study. However, other researchers argued the study was flawed and cited contrary evidence. In 2003, Susan Scott of the University of Liverpool argued that there was no conclusive reason to believe the Montpellier teeth were from Black Death victims. Also in 2003, a team led by Alan Cooper from Oxford University tested 121 teeth from sixty-six skeletons found in 14th century mass graves, including well-documented Black Death plague pits in East Smithfield and Spitalfields. Their results showed no genetic evidence for Y. pestis, and Cooper concluded that though in 2003 \\"[w]e cannot rule out Yersinia as the cause of the Black Death ... right now there is no molecular evidence for it.\\" Other researchers argued that those burial sites where Y. pestis could not be found had nothing to do with the Black Death in the first place. In October 2010 the journal PLoS Pathogens published a paper by Haensch et al. (2010), a multinational team that investigated the role of Yersinia pestis in the Black Death. The paper detailed the results of new surveys that combined ancient DNA analyses and protein-specific detection which were used to find DNA and protein signatures specific for Y. pestis in human skeletons from widely distributed mass graves in northern, central and southern Europe that were associated archaeologically with the Black Death and subsequent resurgences. The authors concluded that this research, together with prior analyses from the south of France and Germany :\\"...ends the debate about the etiology of the Black Death, and unambiguously demonstrates that Y. pestis was the causative agent of the epidemic plague that devastated Europe during the Middle Ages.\\" Significantly, the study also identified two previously unknown but related clades (genetic branches) of the Y. pestis genome that were associated with distinct medieval mass graves. These were found to be ancestral to modern isolates of the modern Y. pestis strains Orientalis and Medievalis, suggesting that these variant strains (which are now presumed to be extinct) may have entered Europe in two distinct waves. The presence of Y. pestis during the Black Death and its phylogenetic placement was definitely established in 2011 with the publication of a Y. pestis genome using new amplification techniques used on DNA extracts from teeth from over 100 samples from the East Smithfield burial site in London. Surveys of plague pit remains in France and England indicate that the first variant entered western Europe through the port of Marseilles around November 1347 and spread through France over the next two years, eventually reaching England in the spring of 1349, where it spread through the country in three successive epidemics. However, surveys of plague pit remains from the Netherlands town of Bergen op Zoom showed that the Y. pestis genotype responsible for the pandemic that spread through the Low Countries from 1350 differed from that found in Britain and France, implying that Bergen op Zoom (and possibly other parts of the southern Netherlands) was not directly infected from England or France in AD 1349, suggesting that a second wave of plague infection, distinct from those in Britain and France, may have been carried to the Low Countries from Norway, the Hanseatic cities, or another site. === Vectors of Y. pestis === Historians who believe that the Black Death was indeed caused by bubonic plague have put forth several theories questioning the traditional identification of Rattus sp. and their associated fleas as plague's primary vector. A 2012 report from the University of Bergen acknowledges that Y. pestis could have been the cause of the pandemic, but states that the epidemiology of the disease is different, most importantly the rapid spread and the lack of rats in Scandinavia and other parts of Northern Europe. R. rattus was present in Scandinavian cities and ports at the time of the Black Death but was not found in small, inland villages. Based on archaeological evidence from digs all over Norway, the black rat population was present in sea ports but remained static in the cold climate and would only have been sustained if ships continually brought black rats and that the rats would be unlikely to venture across open ground to remote villages. It argues that while healthy black rats are rarely seen, rats suffering from bubonic plague behave differently from healthy rats; where accounts from warmer climates mention rats falling from roofs and walls and piling high in the streets, Samuel Pepys, who described trifling observations and events of the London plague of 1665 in great detail, makes no mention of sick or dead rats, nor does Absalon Pederss√∏n in his diary, which contains detailed descriptions of a plague epidemic in Bergen in 1565. Ultimately, Hufthammer and Wall√∏e offer the possibility of human fleas and lice in place of rats.Hufthammer, Anne Karin and Wall√∏e, Lars. 2012. Rats cannot have been intermediate hosts for Yersinia pestis during medieval plague epidemics in Northern Europe. Journal of Archaeological Science. University of Oslo researchers concluded that Y. pestis was likely carried over the Silk Road via fleas on giant gerbils from Central Asia during intermittent warm spells.Black Death plague now blamed on giant gerbils, not ratsGerbils, Not Rats, May Have Caused Bubonic Plague, Study Finds Michael McCormick, a historian supporting bubonic plague as the Black Death, explains how archaeological research has confirmed that the black or \\"ship\\" rat (Rattus rattus) was already present in Roman and medieval Europe. Also, the DNA of Y. pestis has been identified in the teeth of the human victims, the same DNA which has been widely believed to have come from the infected rodents. Pneumonic expression of Y. pestis can be transmitted by human-to-human contact, but McCormick states that this does not spread as easily as previous historians have imagined. According to him, the rat is the only plausible agent of transmission that could have led to such a wide and quick spread of the plague. This is because of rats' proclivity to associate with humans and the ability of their blood to withstand very large concentrations of the bacillus. When rats died, their fleas (which were infected with bacterial blood) found new hosts in the form of humans and animals. The Black Death tapered off in the eighteenth century, and according to McCormick, a rat-based theory of transmission could explain why this occurred. The plague(s) had killed a large portion of the human host population of Europe and dwindling cities meant that more people were isolated, and so geography and demography did not allow rats to have as much contact with Europeans. Greatly curtailed communication and transportation systems due to the drastic decline in human population also hindered the replenishment of devastated rat colonies. ==Alternative explanationsEvidence against Y. pestis=== Although Y. pestis as the causitive agent of plague is widely accepted, recent scientific and historical investigations have led some researchers to doubt the long-held belief that the Black Death was an epidemic of bubonic plague. The arguments are based on differences in mortality levels, disease diffusion rates, rat distribution, flea reproduction and climate, and distribution of human population. In 1984, Graham Twigg published The Black Death: A Biological Reappraisal, where he argued that the climate and ecology of Europe and particularly England made it nearly impossible for rats and fleas to have transmitted bubonic plague. Combining information on the biology of Rattus rattus, Rattus norvegicus, and the common fleas Xenopsylla cheopis and Pulex irritans with modern studies of plague epidemiology, particularly in India, where the R. rattus is a native species and conditions are nearly ideal for plague to be spread, Twigg concludes that it would have been nearly impossible for Yersinia pestis to have been the causative agent of the plague, let alone its explosive spread across Europe. Twigg also shows that the common theory of entirely pneumonic spread does not hold up. He proposes, based on a reexamination of the evidence and symptoms, that the Black Death may actually have been an epidemic of pulmonary anthrax caused by Bacillus anthracis. In 2002, Samuel K. Cohn published the controversial article, ‚ÄúThe Black Death: End of the Paradigm‚Äù. Cohn argues that the medieval and modern plagues were two distinct diseases differing in their symptoms, signs, and epidemiologies. Cohn's argument that medieval plague was not rat-based is supported by his claims that the modern and medieval plagues occurred in different seasons (a claim supported in a 2009 article by Mark Welford and Brian Bossak), had unparalleled cycles of recurrence, and varied in the manner in which immunity was acquired. The modern plague reaches its peak in seasons with high humidity and a temperature of between and , as rats' fleas thrive in this climate. In comparison, the Black Death is recorded as occurring in periods during which rats' fleas could not have survived, i.e. hot Mediterranean summers above . In terms of recurrence, the Black Death on average did not resurface in an area for between five and fifteen years after it had occurred. In contrast, modern plagues often recur in a given area yearly for an average of eight to forty years. Last, Cohn presents evidence displaying that individuals gained immunity to the Black Death, unlike the modern plague, during the fourteenth century. He states that in 1348, two-thirds of those suffering from plague died, in comparison to one-twentieth by 1382. Statistics display that immunity to the modern plague has not been acquired in modern times. In the Encyclopedia of Population, Cohn points to five major weaknesses in the bubonic plague theory: * very different transmission speeds ‚Äì the Black Death was reported to have spread 385 km in 91 days (4.23 km/day) in 664, compared to 12‚Äì15 km a year for the modern bubonic plague, with the assistance of trains and cars * difficulties with the attempt to explain the rapid spread of the Black Death by arguing that it was spread by the rare pneumonic form of the disease ‚Äì in fact this form killed less than 0.3% of the infected population in its worst outbreak (Manchuria in 1911) * different seasonality ‚Äì the modern plague can only be sustained at temperatures between 10 and 26 ¬∞C and requires high humidity, while the Black Death occurred even in Norway in the middle of the winter and in the Mediterranean in the middle of hot dry summers * very different death rates ‚Äì in several places (including Florence in 1348) over 75% of the population appears to have died; in contrast the highest mortality for the modern bubonic plague was 3% in Bombay in 1903 * the cycles and trends of infection were very different between the diseases ‚Äì humans did not develop resistance to the modern disease, but resistance to the Black Death rose sharply, so that eventually it became mainly a childhood disease Cohn also points out that while the identification of the disease as having buboes relies on accounts of Boccaccio and others, they described buboes, abscesses, rashes and carbuncles occurring all over the body, the neck or behind the ears. In contrast, the modern disease rarely has more than one bubo, most commonly in the groin, and is not characterised by abscesses, rashes and carbuncles. This difference, he argues, ties in with the fact that fleas caused the modern plague and not the Black Death. Since flea bites do not usually reach beyond a person's ankles, in the modern period the groin was the nearest lymph node that could be infected. As the neck and the armpit were often infected during the medieval plague, it appears less likely that these infections were caused by fleas on rats.Samuel K. Cohn, The Black Death Transformed: Disease and Culture in Early Renaissance Europe (London: Edward Arnold Publishers, 2002), 81. ===Ebola-like virus=== In 2001, Susan Scott and Christopher Duncan, respectively a demographer and zoologist from Liverpool University, proposed the theory that the Black Death might have been caused by an Ebola-like virus, not a bacterium. Their rationale was that this plague spread much faster and the incubation period was much longer than other confirmed Y. pestis‚Äìcaused plagues. A longer period of incubation will allow carriers of the infection to travel farther and infect more people than a shorter one. When the primary vector is humans, as opposed to birds, this is of great importance. Epidemiological studies suggest the disease was transferred between humans (which happens rarely with Yersinia pestis and very rarely for Bacillus anthracis), and some genes that determine immunity to Ebola-like viruses are much more widespread in Europe than in other parts of the world. Their research and findings are thoroughly documented in Biology of Plagues.Scott, Susan and Duncan, Christopher. (2004). Return of the Black Death: The World's Greatest Serial Killer West Sussex; John Wiley and Sons. . More recently the researchers have published computer modeling demonstrating how the Black Death has made around 10% of Europeans resistant to HIV. ===Anthrax=== In a similar vein, historian Norman Cantor, in In the Wake of the Plague: The Black Death and the World It Made (2001), suggests the Black Death might have been a combination of pandemics including a form of anthrax, a cattle murrain. He cites many forms of evidence including: reported disease symptoms not in keeping with the known effects of either bubonic or pneumonic plague, the discovery of anthrax spores in a plague pit in Scotland, and the fact that meat from infected cattle was known to have been sold in many rural English areas prior to the onset of the plague. The means of infection varied widely, with infection in the absence of living or recently dead humans in Sicily (which speaks against most viruses). Also, diseases with similar symptoms were generally not distinguished between in that period (see murrain above), at least not in the Christian world; Chinese and Muslim medical records can be expected to yield better information which however only pertains to the specific disease(s) which affected these areas. Cutaneous anthrax infection in humans shows up as a boil-like skin lesion that eventually forms an ulcer with a black center (eschar), often beginning as an irritating and itchy skin lesion or blister that is dark and usually concentrated as a black dot. Cutaneous infections generally form within the site of spore penetration between two and five days after exposure. Without treatment about 20% of cutaneous skin infection cases progress to toxemia and death. Respiratory infection in humans initially presents with cold or flu- like symptoms for several days, followed by severe (and often fatal) respiratory collapse. Historical mortality was 92%.Bravata DM, Holty JE, Liu H, McDonald KM, Olshen RA, Owens DK (2006), Systematic review: a century of inhalational anthrax cases from 1900 to 2005, Annals of Internal Medicine; 144(4): 270‚Äì280. Gastrointestinal infection in humans is most often caused by eating anthrax-infected meat and is characterized by serious gastrointestinal difficulty, vomiting of blood, severe diarrhea, acute inflammation of the intestinal tract, and loss of appetite. After the bacteria invades the bowel system, it spreads through the bloodstream throughout the body, making more toxins on the way. ==References== Category:Black Death ","title":"Theories of the Black Death"},{"id":"20155430","text":"Kunming Institute of Botany, or KIB (), founded in 1938, is a research institution in the field of Botany, which is located in Kunming, the capital of Yunnan Province, China.

There are also over 200,000 specimens of fungi, lichens, and mosses, many of which were donated by mycologist Mu Zang. The Institute also has a botanical garden. Currently there are around 5,000 species of vascular plants in the botanical garden. There are several sections, with specific collections, such as: * Arboretum * Collection of herbs. * Endangered species and rare species. * Aquatic species. * Gardens of specimens of the genus Camellia, Magnolia, and Begonia. * Ferns All the plants that are hosted in the botanical garden are a foundation on which to work, for the research and experience of the staff of scientists at the Institute. Studies are conducted to improve the cultivation of plants of economic interest, with a view to better use, both nutritionally and industrially. Currently a digital database of the botanical garden is being prepared, as well as of wild plants in the province of Yunnan. ==Germplasm Bank of Wild Species== A comprehensive research and preservation facility for the germplasm of rare and endangered plants, wild animal species and microorganisms was completed in 2007 at the KIB. With an investment of 148 million yuan (18.5 million U.S. dollars) over two years, the \\"Southwest China Germplasm Bank of Wild Species\\" facility was established by the Kunming Institute of Botany (KIB) with the help of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). The bank is a key player in China's biotech industry and a pioneer in the nation's biodiversity conservation and bioresource development strategy. According to the KIB, the bank sees itself as a leading storage facility of Asian species within 15 years of its foundation, and expects to make significant contributions to the development of the biotech industry and life science research by providing valuable resources, information and expertise. Within the next five years, the bank is expected to collect 6,450 wild species, 4,000 of which will be plant seed species. Within 15 years, its collection will reach 19,000 species. The bank comprises a seed section, an in-vitro micro-propagation unit, a microorganism bank, an animal germplasm bank, a DNA bank, an information center and a garden. Stretching across an undulating landscape and climatic zones ranging from the tropical to the frigid, Yunnan is home to a multitude of plant species linked together by a complex network of phylogenetic relations, and accounts for more than 50 percent of China's plant diversity. It is China's largest seed bank. ==See also== *Wu Zheng-yi, director of KIB *Cai Xitao, botanist *Kunming Institute of Zoology *Xishuangbanna Tropical Botanic Gardens *List of herbaria ==References== *CAS -- Kunming Institute of Botany - China International Science and Technology Cooperation *Botanic Gardens and the Development of National Germplasm Conservation Strategies *29 October 2008,Kew‚Äôs Millennium Seed Bank deposits UK flora collections as part of China seed bank launch ==External links== *Official website *Kunming Branch of CAS *The Flora of China a collaborative project *flickr images Category:Botanical gardens in China Category:Research institutes of the Chinese Academy of Sciences Category:Buildings and structures in Kunming Category:Education in Kunming ","title":"Kunming Institute of Botany"},{"id":"20155442","text":"250px Joey and the Twisters was an American twist group, formed from remnants of the original Royal Teens around 1961.

The Twisters never released an album, but did release several singles on Duel Records, including remakes of Bobby Darin's \\"Jailer, Bring me Water,\\" Bobby Freeman's \\"Do You Want to Dance,\\" and \\"Bony Maronie,\\" and penned \\"Peppermint Twist Time\\" in honor of the club that gave them a home. They did launch on a national tour, the highlight of which was playing the Dream Room in New Orleans, and they appeared on Dick Clark's American Bandstand on New Year's Day, 1962. The group dissolved as the twist fell out of fashion. Joey Villa continued playing as a solo artist. Bob Azzara and Louis Burgio, along with friend Flip Cesario, who briefly played with the Royal Teens, later formed the band Mardi Gras. ==Members== * Joey Villa - Vocals * Bob Azzara - piano * Louis Burgio - drums * Frankie Natale - saxophone * Rich Malfitano - saxophone * Flip Cesario - guitar ==References Category:Musical groups from New York City Category:Doo-wop groups ","title":"Joey and the Twisters"},{"id":"20155443","text":"George Henry Rowdon, born at Midsomer Norton, Somerset on 6 October 1914, and died in Bath in February 1987, played in one first-class cricket match for Somerset in the 1936 season.

The Black Death in medieval culture includes the effect of the Black Death (1347‚Äì1350) on art and literature throughout the generation that experienced it. Although contemporary chronicles are often regarded by historians as the most realistic portrayals of the Black Death, the effects of such a large-scale shared experience on the population of Europe influenced poetry, prose, stage works, music and artwork throughout the period, as made evident by writers such as Chaucer, Boccaccio, and Petrarch, and artists such as Holbein. ==Chronicles== Man playing chess with death in a c. 1480 mural by Albertus Pictor in T√§by church in Sweden Much of the most useful manifestations of the Black Death in literature, to historians, comes from the accounts of its chroniclers; contemporary accounts are often the only real way to get a sense of the horror of living through a disaster on such a scale. A few of these chroniclers were famous writers, philosophers and rulers (like Boccaccio and Petrarch). Their writings, however, did not reach the majority of the European population. For example, Petrarch's work was read mainly by wealthy nobles and merchants of Italian city-states. He wrote hundreds of letters and vernacular poetry of great distinction and passed on to later generations a revised interpretation of courtly love. There was, however, one troubadour, writing in the lyric style long out of fashion, who was active in 1348. Peire Lunel de Montech composed the sorrowful sirventes \\"Meravilhar no¬∑s devo pas las gens\\" during the height of the plague in Toulouse. Although romances continued to be popular throughout the period, the courtly tradition began to face increasing competition from ordinary writers who became involved in producing gritty realist literature, inspired by their Black Death experiences. This was a new phenomenon, made possible because vernacular education and literature, as well as the study of Latin and classical antiquity, flourished widely, making the written word steadily more accessible during the fourteenth century. For example, Agnolo di Tura, of Siena, records his experience: The scene di Tura describes is repeated over and over again all across Europe. In Sicily, Gabriele de' Mussi, a notary, tells of the early spread from the Crimea: Friar John Clyn witnessed its effects in Leinster, after its spread to Ireland in August 1348:Williams, Dr. Bernadette. (2007).The Annals of Ireland by Friar John Clyn. Dublin: Four Courts Press. ==In literature== In addition to these personal accounts, many presentations of the Black Death have entered the general consciousness as great literature. For example, the major works of Boccaccio (The Decameron), Petrarch, Geoffrey Chaucer (The Canterbury Tales), and William Langland (Piers Plowman), which all discuss the Black Death, are generally recognized as some of the best works of their era. La Danse Macabre, or the Dance of death, was a contemporary allegory, expressed as art, drama, and printed work. Its theme was the universality of death, expressing the common wisdom of the time: that no matter one's station in life, the dance of death united all. It consists of the personified Death leading a row of dancing figures from all walks of life to the grave ‚Äì typically with an emperor, king, pope, monk, youngster, beautiful girl, all in skeleton-state. They were produced under the impact of the Black Death, reminding people of how fragile their lives were and how vain the glories of earthly life. The earliest artistic example is from the frescoed cemetery of the Church of the Holy Innocents in Paris (1424). There are also works by Konrad Witz in Basel (1440), Bernt Notke in L√ºbeck (1463) and woodcuts by Hans Holbein the Younger (1538). Israil Bercovici claims that the Danse Macabre originated among Sephardic Jews in fourteenth century Spain (Bercovici, 1992, p. 27). The poem \\"The Rattle Bag\\" by the Welsh poet Dafydd ap Gwilym (1315‚Äì1350 or 1340‚Äì1370) has many elements that suggest that it was written as a reflection of the hardships he endured during the Black Death. It also reflects his personal belief that the Black Death was the end of humanity, the Apocalypse, as suggested by his multiple biblical references, particularly the events described in the Book of Revelation. Thomas Nashe wrote a sonnet about the plague entitled \\"A Litany in Time of Plague\\" which was part of his play Summer's Last Will and Testament (1592). He made countryside visits to remove himself from London in fear of the plague. Rich men, trust not in wealth, Gold cannot buy you health; Physic himself must fade. All things to end are made, The plague full swift goes by; I am sick, I must die. Lord, have mercy on us! Beauty is but a flower Which wrinkles will devour; Brightness falls from the air; Queens have died young and fair; Dust hath closed Helen‚Äôs eye. I am sick, I must die. Lord, have mercy on us! ==Influence on European folklore== The Black Death quickly entered common folklore in many European countries. In Northern Europe, the plague was personified as an old, bent woman covered and hooded in black, carrying a broom and a rake. Norwegians told that if she used the rake, some of the population involved might survive, escaping through the teeth of the rake. On the other hand, if she used the broom, then the entire population in the area were doomed. The Plague-hag, or Pesta, were vividly drawn by the painter Theodor Kittelsen. Women during and after the Black Death also benefited from the growing importance of vernacular literature because a broader cultural forum became available to them which had previously been restricted to men by the Latin church. And so, they began writing and fostering through patronage the writings and translations of others. For example, in France, Christine de Pizan (1364‚Äì1430) became the first woman in Europe to support herself by writing. She wrote in many different literary forms, such as an autobiography and books of moral advice for men and women, as well as poetry on a wide range of topics. In her treatise The Letter to the God of Love, she responded to Jean de Meun's anti- woman writings found in his conclusion of Romance of the Rose. Her treatise marked the first instance in European history where a woman was able to respond to such diatribes in writing. It also led to a debate among de Meun and Pizan sympathizers which lasted until the sixteenth century. ==Celebrations== Some communities put on dances or other celebrations, either to cheer people up in dire times, or in a superstitious attempt to ward off the disease. According to tradition in Munich, these included the Sch√§fflertanz (barrel-maker's dance, dating to 1517)Sch√§fflertanz (2012) and the Metzgersprung (butcher's jump),Markets and festivals: time for traditions which are still performed there and in other cities. ==See also== *Plague doctor *Beak doctor costume *Plague doctor contract *Jewish persecutions during the Black Death *Erfurt massacre (1349) ==References== Category:Black Death Category:Medieval culture Category:Late Middle Ages ","title":"Black Death in medieval culture"},{"id":"20155488","text":"Sainsbury's Freezer Centres was a former frozen food chain, operated by the then-largest UK supermarket chain (now the second largest supermarket chain) Sainsbury's. The company decided to open the shops in response to competition from specialist frozen food chains, such as Bejam. It also allowed Sainsbury's to make use of its valuable freehold counter service stores (that were too small for conversion to self-service). The first shop opened at Southbourne near Bournemouth in 1974. It was not an immediate success as many of the elderly residents living in the area did not own a freezer. Only 11% of households at that time owned freezers. Nine other branches that followed suit in that year, however, had greater success. They sold about 3,000 lines, many with deep discounts. In 1975, new build stores or refurbished ones had frozen food departments built into them. Chippenham was the first branch to have this integrated. By 1980, there were 21 freezer centres, and by 1982, 49% of households owned a freezer. Sainsbury's sold Sainsbury's Freezer Centres to Bejam in 1986.

It encourages innovation and advocates for change in policy and practice through focused research, development and training. ==Focus== * Criminal justice - the Centre identifies effective methods of supporting and diverting people with mental health problems in the criminal justice system * Employment - the Centre develops and promotes new ways of helping people with mental health problems get and keep work * Recovery - the Centre helps mental health services across the UK to support people more effectively to make their own lives better on their own terms * Children - the centre undertakes work which aims to improve the life chances of children through the support they need early in life * Mental and Physical Health - the Centre recognises the strong association between mental and physical ill health and works with partners to review the evidence on cost of co-morbidities, as well as carrying out related research on liaison psychiatry * Workplace training - we train managers and staff to understand, identify and support people with depression and anxiety at work ==History== The Centre for Mental Health began in March 1985 as the National Unit for Psychiatric Research and Development (NUPRD). It was founded by the Gatsby Charitable Foundation, an independent grant-making trust set up by Lord Sainsbury of Turville to 'advance education and learning in the science and practise of mental health care, to promote research into mental health and publish the useful results and to assist the provision of mental health care for those in need of it'. The aim was for NUPRD to tackle these issues by working in a different way to other organisations. NUPRD was initially staffed by a small group of people working in an office at Lewisham Hospital. After 1989, it was renamed the Research and Development for Psychiatry (RDP), moving into the current offices on Borough High Street. RDP eventually became the 'Sainsbury Centre for Mental Health' in February 1992. It was at the centre of developing and helping to implement the National Service Framework for Mental Health, and in 1995, evaluated the Blackthorn Trust garden (in Maidstone, Kent) and its therapies for two years. From 2006, the Centre changed its work to focus on mental health and employment, in which it already had an established programme, as well as a new area of work on mental health and the criminal justice system. A new look and logo were subsequently introduced in 2007 to accompany this change in focus. The Gatsby Charitable Foundation, one of the Sainsbury Family Charitable Trusts, provided the Centre's core funding each year from 1985 until 2009, when it announced that it would begin to spend out its funds, its annual grant to the Centre ceasing the following year. A final grant covering three years was then announced by the foundation in the summer of 2010.

He is known for his high-wire performances without a safety net. He holds 11 Guinness World Records for various acrobatic feats, but was best known as the first person to walk a tightrope stretched directly over Niagara Falls. Wallenda walked 1,800 feet on a steel cable over Masaya Volcano in Nicaragua, his longest walk, on March 4, 2020. Wallenda is a 7th-generation member of The Flying Wallendas family, and he participated in various circus acts as a child. He made his professional tightrope walking debut at age 13, and he chose high-wire walking as his career in 1998 after joining family members in a seven-person pyramid on the wire. In 2001, he was part of the world's first eight-person high-wire pyramid. He performed with his family at various venues from 2002 to 2005, forming his own troupe in 2005. He performed with Bello Nock in 2007 and 2008 in a double version of the Wheel of Steel that he helped invent. In 2009, he set new personal bests for highest and longest tightrope walks, completing a total of 15 walks above in the air that year. In 2008, while performing with Ringling Bros., Wallenda set Guinness World Records for longest and highest bicycle ride on a high-wire at above the ground in New Jersey. He nearly doubled the height record in 2010 to . On the same day in 2010, he upped his personal best by tightrope walking over in a single performance. He set a world record in 2011 by performing on the Wheel of Death atop the 23 story Tropicana Casino and Resort. Later that year, he and his mother tightrope walked between the two towers of Condado Plaza Hotel in Puerto Rico. The feat was a re-creation of the one that killed Karl Wallenda, Nik's great- grandfather and primary source of inspiration. On June 10, 2011, Wallenda hung from a helicopter off the ground using only his toes to hold on. Some time after that, he walked on top of a turning Ferris wheel at the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk, CA. Wallenda crossed Niagara Falls on June 15, 2012 on a live ABC special, following a two-year legal battle involving both sides of the Canada‚ÄìUnited States border to gain approval. He was required to wear a safety harness for the first time in his life. A reality show aired on the Science Channel which followed his feats. In 2013, he released a memoir entitled Balance. He became the first person to high-wire walk across the Grand Canyon on June 23, 2013. The feat aired live on Discovery breaking rating records for the network. He followed that up with Skyscraper Live, a live Discovery special that aired on November 2, 2014, in which he completed two tightrope walks and set two new Guinness World Records: one for walking the steepest tightrope incline over 600‚Äô up between two skyscrapers, and the other for the highest tightrope walk while blindfolded. Wallenda is married with three children, and considers his Christian faith to be a central aspect of his life. ==Background== Wallenda is a seventh-generation member of The Flying Wallendas family of aerialists. His ancestors were primarily of Austro- Hungarian descent and have been circus performers since the 1700s; they have been doing balancing acts without nets since Karl Wallenda made the family famous for the feat in the 1920s. Nik Wallenda is a direct descendant of Karl, whom he calls his role model and his \\"biggest hero in life\\". Several members of the family have died while training or performing. In 1962, the troupe's famous seven-person pyramid collapsed, killing two family members and paralyzing Wallenda's uncle Mario. In 1978, his great-grandfather Karl Wallenda died after falling from a tight rope at age 73 in Puerto Rico. ==Early life== Wallenda was born in Sarasota, Florida on January 24, 1979 to Delilah Wallenda and Terry Troffer. His parents bought him a swing set when he was two. Before Troffer had even finished assembling it, Wallenda climbed up to the crossbar and did a somersault. Around the same time, he began performing with his family in their circus act. His first public performance was at SeaWorld San Diego in 1981. He began to play on the wire at age two, walking back and forth while holding his mother's hand. At age four, he started walking the wire on his own, learning primarily from his father. He would play on his parents' practice wire with his older sister Lijana, two feet off the ground. His parents would throw objects at him as he practiced, and even shot him with a BB gun to train him to deal with distractions. At age six, he first visited Niagara Falls and immediately decided that one day he wanted to walk a tightrope across it. He spent most of his youth on the road, living in a mobile home as his parents performed across America. Wallenda transitioned from being a clown, to juggling, to a dog act. He made his professional tightrope walking debut at age 13. When he graduated from high school, his parents encouraged him to go to college and explore his options. With live circus losing popularity, becoming a performer did not seem like a viable career path. Wallenda briefly considered becoming a doctor, and was accepted into college. However, his plans changed in 1998 when he participated in a re-creation of Karl Wallenda's seven-person pyramid on the high-wire in Detroit, alongside his father, mother, and other family members. ==Career== Nik Wallenda has produced a variety of large-scale productions for amusement parks and similar venues in several countries. The acts often feature him alongside family members, especially his wife Erendira. Wallenda's children are sometimes part of the act. His youngest child, Evita, has been performing balancing feats since she would balance in the palm of her father's hand at six months old. Wallenda's shows have incorporated water and diving feats, the Wheel of Death, incline motorcycles, aerial silk and aerial hoop, the globe of death, and tightrope walking. \\"We've performed nearly every circus or daredevil skill there is\\", claims Wallenda. \\"I like to mix it up\\", he says. \\"It keeps [our family] on our toes and gives the public something new to see every year.\\" Wallenda's father, Terry Troffer, serves as his safety coordinator, having retired from acrobatics after 36 years in the business. Troffer's brother Mike serves as chief engineer. Wallenda has never had a serious accident, describing the worst injury of his life as a broken toe while playing football. Wallenda lies down on the tightrope while performing at Canada's Wonderland theme park Wallenda performs without a safety net or harness. \\"My great-grandfather taught that safety nets offer a false sense of security\\", he explains. He notes that a safety net is no guarantee ‚Äì an uncle was killed while performing despite falling into a safety net. However, he says he does not have a \\"death wish in any way. I plan on living and dying a natural death when I'm old.\\" Asked about fear, he remarked \\"I would say the only thing I fear is God\\". He adds that his Christian faith allows him to \\"know where I'm going to go when I die ... I'm not scared of dying.\\" Wallenda says that the high-wire performance is not a daredevil act or a mere stunt, but rather an athletic feat requiring great physical training. \\"I see a stunt as somebody who gets in a barrel and goes over the edge and hopes they don't hit a rock\\", he said commenting on his walk across Niagara Falls. \\"What I do is very calculated. I train a long time for it and I consider it more of an art. I guess I don't get offended by [people] calling it a stunt, but to me it's more of an art than anything.\\" He aims to be \\"over-prepared\\" for every event he does, training six hours a day, six days a week. He does ten hours of weight training and five hours of aerobic exercise each week. Even so, he says wire walking is primarily a mental skill. Wallenda has developed several tricks that he often incorporates into his high-wire routine including stopping to make a phone call, sitting on the wire, and lying down on the wire. He is said to be \\"obsessed\\" with the technological aspects of his acts, insisting on calculating every detail himself. When asked why he risks his life on the high-wire, he replied \\"I do this because I love what I do ... If I won the lottery tomorrow, I'd still be doing what I do.\\" \\"Walking the wire to me is life\\", he adds. Wallenda and his family spend roughly 48 weeks per year on the road. As of 2013 Wallenda has a contract with the Discovery Channel for near-exclusive broadcast of his acts. He carries a US$20-million insurance policy. He has called his career \\"extremely lucrative, more lucrative than I would have ever dreamed of\\". He plans to retire at age 50. ===Early career=== In 2001, Wallenda appeared with seven other family members at Japan's Kurashiki Tivoli Park in an attempt at the world's first ever eight-person high-wire pyramid. After five months of four hours per day, six days a week preparation, the family successfully walked across a tightrope in six minutes, setting a Guinness World Record. Nik Wallenda cited Karl Wallenda as the primary inspiration for the feat, and stated that \\"it was a landmark experience for our profession, as well as our family and me personally\\". From 2002 to 2005, Wallenda performed alongside his wife, children, and other family members at Wet 'n Wild Emerald Pointe in Greensboro, North Carolina. They also toured the United States as part of various circuses. One early act featured Wallenda riding a motorcycle across the high-wire in the air. In 2005 Wallenda and his wife, Erendira, took their act to Raging Waters in San Dimas, California, while his mother and sister stayed at Wet 'n Wild. Throughout this time period, Wallenda continued to participate in the family's signature seven-person pyramid. In 2006, McDonald's sponsored a show in Detroit. To promote the restaurant's new coffee, Nik Wallenda and his older sister Lijana did an act where they met in the middle of a high-wire and sat down to have some coffee, after starting on opposite ends. After exchanging several toasts, Nik stood up and stepped over his sister. As the siblings headed back to their platforms, a crane winch malfunctioned, preventing Lijana from exiting the wire. After Nik descended to the ground, a crane was moved to reduce the tension on the wire and he rode a hook up to rescue his sister. ===Wheel of Steel=== In 2007 and 2008, Wallenda was a featured performer in the Ringling Brothers production Bellobration, performing with Bello Nock on a newly contrived, double version of the Wheel of Steel. At the beginning of the act, Wallenda and Nock stood balanced atop twin circles 39 feet in the air. To the audience, the circles appeared to be connected until the act started with a burst of fireworks. The wheels then split, sending the performers in opposite directions without safety nets or harnesses. To stay on the device, the duo had to move in unison, running at up to 20 miles an hour. Vibrations were transferred from one wheel to the other, meaning each performer was affected by what the other was doing. At the top of each arc the performers were rendered weightless, while being subjected to several times the force of gravity at the bottom. Wallenda walks a tightrope over Baltimore's Inner Harbor The act was set around a story line. During the first half of the circus, Wallenda's wife, Erendira, played the love interest of Nock. After intermission, Wallenda and Nock \\"battled\\" it out on the Wheel, competing for her heart. To enhance the entertainment value, they mixed jumping rope, somersaults, and leaps into the routine. In all, the Wheel performance lasted seven minutes. Also part of the same show was a sway pole performance by Nock and Wallenda's wife. Using poles that swayed as much as in all directions, the couple did a series of tricks that included climbing up and sliding down the poles, swinging all around, and jumping from pole to pole. In all, sixteen members of the Wallenda family were part of Bellobration. The double Wheel of Steel was invented by Wallenda and Nock. The two had grown up together in Sarasota and had talked about teaming up for years before coming up with the double Wheel concept, drawing up the initial plans on a tablecloth during dinner in 2005. They then spent nine months building the device in Nock's backyard workshop, and a further four months testing it and designing a performance. The greatest challenge was to find a way to split the wheels while they were still spinning. \\"There were a lot of back-to-the-drawing-board moments\\", Wallenda later recalled. Ultimately, the problem was solved via a system of piston-like pneumatic cylinders. Wallenda's uncle, Timothy Stephenson, who is an engineer for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), suggested that an axle be built of custom-blended, hardened steel alloy to keep it from breaking. In the end, the device cost more than $100,000 to produce. ===Record-setting bicycle ride=== On October 15, 2008, Wallenda performed on a live broadcast of Today. The plan was to walk and then bicycle off the roof of the Prudential Center in Downtown Newark, New Jersey, across a suspended high-wire 13 and 1/2 stories (135 feet) above the ground. Starting at 8:30am, he first walked across the cable with a balancing pole. Halfway through, he sat down on the wire and called the Today show hosts. \\"Where are you?\\" he asked, joking that he was expecting to carry one of the show's hosts across the wire on his shoulder. Sitting down on the wire is easy, he said, it is getting back up that is tricky. A few steps before completing the walk, Wallenda stopped and waved to the crowd. When he resumed, he wobbled and had to bend his knees to regain balance. \\"I actually slipped\\", he said later. \\"I lost focus there for a moment\\" because of some unexpected tape on the wire. He completed the walk in about five minutes. Wallenda then crossed the high-wire on an ordinary bicycle with the tires and handlebars removed. Near completion, he paused, causing the bike to slide backward as it lost grip on the wire. He regained control and finished, then jumped onto the roof of Prudential Center and hugged his wife and three children. He explained in an interview: \\"The back wheel started to slip ... It was a little nerve-racking at the end.\\" Five years later, he said the slip was closest he ever came to disaster. \\"It really shook me up\\", he recalled. By completing the ride, Wallenda set the world record for both highest and longest bike ride on a high-wire. A representative from Guinness World Records was on hand to present him with a certificate documenting the achievement. ===Walk Across America Tour=== In 2009, Wallenda took his high-wire act to ten Cedar Fair amusement parks in what was dubbed as the \\"Walk Across America Tour\\". The tour began with a walk at Worlds of Fun in Kansas City and ended at Carowinds, where Wallenda twice walked across the North Carolina-South Carolina state line on the high-wire. As part of the tour, he walked at Kings Island in Mason, Ohio from the front gate to the Eiffel Tower on August 15. Traveling at above the ground, it was the highest walk of his career at the time. He completed the walk in about 25 minutes as several thousand people watched. Wallenda walking the high-wire at Kings Island on August 15, 2009 On July 3, Wallenda wire walked over the Allegheny River in Pittsburgh as the headline act of the 2009 Three Rivers Regatta. He paused several times during the performance to kneel and wave to the crowd. At one point, he had to stop for a few minutes to regain his balance in the strong winds and rain. Although Wallenda's team had ordered an ungreased wire, it was covered in oil when it arrived. To compensate, Wallenda did the walk in his socks rather than in his tightrope shoes. At , the 25-minute walk was the longest of his career to that point. In total, Wallenda completed 15 high-wire performances at 100 or more feet in the air during 2009. In 2010, he performed in his home town of Sarasota for the first time. On February 4, he walked from the roof of One Watergate Condominium to the roof of The Ritz-Carlton Hotel. The performance lasted 12 minutes and was aired on national television. From February 12‚Äì28, he anchored a version of The Flying Wallenda seven-person pyramid at Circus Sarasota. ===The Bahamas=== On August 30, 2010, Wallenda performed at the Atlantis Paradise Island resort in the Bahamas. For the first part of his act, he rode a bicycle along a high-wire above the ocean. The ride set a new Guinness World Record for highest bike ride on a high-wire, nearly doubling Wallenda's own record from 2008. Following the bike ride, Wallenda tightrope walked over the resort's marine habitat filled with barracuda, piranha, and sharks. It was the longest walk of his career. Between the morning bike ride and the late afternoon tightrope walk, Wallenda's father and safety coordinator Terry passed out from a combination of heat and stress and was rushed to the hospital. Performing without his father watching \\"was one of the hardest decisions I ever made in my life\\", Wallenda said, \\"but my family history and my family tradition is that the show must go on\\". It was the first time in his career that he performed without the assistance of his father. In addition, he had to battle rain, strong winds, and lightning in the area to complete the feats. ===Wheel of Death record=== On April 28, 2011, Wallenda visited the Tropicana Casino and Resort in Atlantic City, New Jersey for a pair of performances. In the first, he walked a tightrope inside the casino's shopping center. Performing with a balancing pole, in the air, he dropped to one knee and then onto his back during the performance. He walked both forwards and backwards before completing the journey. Afterwards, Wallenda said he had previously noted the casino's raised ceiling painted with a sky scene and said to himself \\"I've gotta walk there!\\" Later in the day, Wallenda went outside to perform the Wheel of Death off the roof and over the side of the casino's 23rd floor. In the act, he walked inside the wheel for roughly 10 rotations, then climbed atop it where he walked and jumped rope around it. Part of the act, he performed blindfolded. The performance set a world record for the greatest height at which the Wheel had ever been performed. It was also the first time anyone had performed the act off the side of a building. ===Puerto Rico=== On June 4, 2011, Wallenda completed a high-wire crossing between the two towers of the ten-story Condado Plaza Hotel in San Juan, Puerto Rico. The performance was a recreation of the act that had killed his great grandfather Karl Wallenda in 1978. For the performance, Wallenda's mother, Delilah (Karl's granddaughter), joined him. The mother and son team started at opposite ends of the wire. When Delilah reached the middle of the wire, roughly the spot Karl had fallen, she sat down on the wire and Nik stepped over her before the two continued to opposite ends of the wire. At one point during the performance, Nik knelt down on the wire and blew a kiss in honor of his great-grandfather's memory. After the feat, Wallenda said he was \\"not scared at all\\", but admitted that the circumstances of Karl's death had haunted him for years. \\"This has been a dream of mine to recreate this walk\\", he explained. \\"To be able to walk in his exact footsteps is an extremely huge honor, and I did this for him as much as I did it for my family to get some closure.\\" He also called the walk the biggest and most emotional moment of his career to that point. \\"I can't even put it into words. It was so emotional\\", he said a week later. ===Hanging from a helicopter=== On June 10, 2011, Wallenda performed while hanging from a helicopter above Silver Dollar City in Branson, Missouri. First he hung from a trapeze with two arms, then one arm, then his legs, and finally by his teeth. In so doing, Wallenda set his sixth world record. He called it his most difficult feat to date, and remarked that training \\"was very difficult. It was very painful. I had neck problems for months afterwards\\". For the next couple months, Wallenda performed daily shows at Silver Dollar City with his family. The highlight of the show was a three-person \\"Chair Pyramid\\" on the high-wire. Wallenda and Jonah Finkelstein rode bicycles across the wire while Delilah Wallenda sat in a chair atop a balance bar they carried. In the middle of the performance, Wallenda would purposely act like he was losing control and move the balance bar erratically to heighten the drama. He would then shout \\"Watch it, Mom!\\" before regaining control. Acting off balance was the hardest part of the act, according to Wallenda. ===Niagara Falls crossing=== Nik Wallenda waves to the crowd at his tightrope walk across Niagara Falls in 2012 On February 15, 2012, Nik Wallenda received official approval from Ontario's Niagara Parks Commission (NPC) to walk a tightrope across Niagara Falls, a dream he had had since he was a child. The plan called for crossing the Niagara River and its deep gorge from the American side at Goat Island or at the smaller Luna Island, and making his way across the river to land at the Canadian side near the site of Table Rock. The American Falls and Bridal Veil Falls would be behind him and to his right, while the Canadian Falls would be on his immediate left and behind. The approval came after nearly two years of lobbying governments in both the United States and Canada. In October 2010, Wallenda was approached by Roger Trevino, the executive vice president of Niagara Falls Redevelopment, at an amusement trade show. Trevino later recalled: \\"I went up to Wallenda and said 'Have you ever thought about walking across the falls?' and he said 'ever since I was a little kid', and then he asked about the steps involved.\\" Wallenda later remarked \\"I believe people are brought into my life for a reason... I take everyone seriously because you just never know [who you are talking to]\\". Trevino next contacted New York State Senator George Maziarz. After Maziarz met Wallenda, he went to work at drafting a bill granting Wallenda a one-time exemption to the state's anti- stunting laws. Dennis H. Gabryszak co-sponsored the bill, and it passed the State Senate and Assembly nearly unanimously. The bill was signed into law by governor Andrew Cuomo on September 23, 2011. On the Canadian side, things went less smoothly. In June 2011, public statements by NPC board members made it clear that they were opposed to Wallenda's plan. After an October meeting with Wallenda, the twelve-person board voted on December 7 to maintain their anti- stunting rules. NPC officials, led by chair Janice Thomson, feared Wallenda's plan could bring back the days when amateur daredevils routinely got themselves injured or killed at the Falls, and also believed it would cheapen the area's natural beauty. \\"It's sensationalism, and that's not what the falls is supposed to be about\\", said Thomson. In response, Wallenda funded an economic impact survey conducted by Enigma Research. The results suggested direct revenue potential of $20.5 million for the city, with up to $122 million of \\"legacy effects\\" over the next five years. The survey also predicted worldwide viewership of 460 million people. Wallenda further promised to fund all the necessary safety-contingencies and to leave no footprint on the environment. Seeing the economic benefits, Ontario Minister of Tourism Michael Chan convinced the NPC to take a second look. On February 15, 2012, the commission voted unanimously to give Wallenda's plan the go ahead, provided that he paid rigging and commission costs of C$105,000. Wallenda described the legal battle as the biggest challenge of his career and \\"probably more remarkable\\" than the walk itself. He attributed the eventual success to divine intervention. \\"God's hand is involved in every step of my life\\", he explained. \\"I believe doors were opened for me that weren't opened for others\\". Six previous high-profile wire walkers had failed in their attempts to gain approval to walk the Falls since 1971. In preparation for the event, municipal authorities on both sides of the border met to discuss the long-term economic impact of the event, and how to capitalize efficiently on the large number of tourists expected at the Falls when it was held. The event was expected to bring in millions of dollars in tourist revenue on both sides of the border. The Niagara Parks Commission has stated it will be at least twenty years before another major stunt is approved. Wallenda taking his first steps on the tightrope spanning Niagara Falls. Wallenda hopes that eventually he can make the Niagara Falls region a prominent aspect of his business. \\"I do plan on spending a lot of time in this community\\", he told local reporters months before his historic walk. \\"This isn't a one-off event where I'll show up and do an event and be gone. I would like to make this my second home and bring a full-time show here that I would be performing throughout the season along with all my family members as well.\\" The Discovery Channel had Wallenda under contract and negotiated with several of the major television networks for broadcast rights. On May 11, 2012, the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) and Lincoln Square Productions announced they had secured worldwide broadcasting rights for the event. Josh Elliott and Hannah Storm were chosen to host the coverage. In Canada, CTV's coverage of the event, although a direct feed from ABC, invoked simultaneous substitution over ABC network broadcasts in some parts of Canada. On his final performance before heading to Niagara for training, Wallenda walked above Baltimore's Inner Harbor. According to Wallenda, it was the first time anyone had attached a high-wire to a barge; he remarked that the configuration made the walk \\"a little more unstable\\" than normal. Near the end of the journey, he had a significant slip, but managed to regain his balance quickly. He called the slip \\"a wake-up call\\" for Niagara. \\"My friend was up in the basket and I started talking to him, and it was just enough of a distraction\\", he explained. \\"The wire kind of moved a little bit and I just misstepped. It's why I've trained for so long: you stay on the wire. Your heart jumps up into your throat and two seconds later, you're fine.\\" The May 9 event was sponsored by Ripley's Believe It or Not which was opening a museum on the harbor. When it opened it June, a feature exhibit allowed visitors to walk on a piece of the wire Wallenda had used in Baltimore. To prepare for the Niagara event, Wallenda practiced in the parking lot of Seneca Niagara Casino for eleven straight days. He had fire trucks spray him with water and brought in a high-powered fan to try to simulate the conditions he would face over Niagara Falls. Practices were open to the public. Wallenda's safety coordinator and father, Terry Troffer, said the training was primarily mental. \\"This is a mental game. It's convincing himself that ... it's just a different location\\", Troffer explained. Eleven days before the scheduled walk date, Wallenda faced a new challenge. Official permits had not yet been granted in New York and park officials were threatening to cancel the event over payment issues. Wallenda's managers claimed to be on schedule with the US$225,000 the state was charging him. The park commission claimed that Wallenda's failure to sign the necessary paperwork was holding things up. To avoid negative publicity, Wallenda's manager, David Simone, withdrew $75,000 from his personal account to foot the bill. Permits were issued the next day. However, two days before the event, New York parks threatened to pull the permits as Wallenda's team still owed over $10,000. According to Wallenda, \\"the U.S. side was just nasty to deal with toward the end. They were accusing us of lying and saying we weren't fulfilling the contract.\\" However, he said the local officials were great to work with, blaming higher-ups in Albany for the problems. Maziarz acknowledged there were \\"some tense moments\\", but said there was never any chance of the event not happening. Ultimately, a wire transfer by ABC resolved the issue. No similar issues arose on the Canadian side. Wallenda practicing for his Niagara walk at Seneca Niagara Casino On the day of the walk, June 15, 2012, crowds estimated in the tens of thousands gathered on the American side of the falls. On the Canadian side, the crowd was estimated at 120,000 people. Due to the location, the wire could not use supports and had to be custom made. As a result, the wire was able to sway significantly in the breeze, making the crossing more difficult than it would have otherwise been. It was the first time in Wallenda's career that he performed without guy wire stabilizers. The wire was two inches (five centimeters) in diameter, significantly wider than the 5/8 of an inch wire Wallenda typically uses, and weighed roughly 8.5 tons (7,700 kg). The extra width was necessary to make the cable strong enough to withstand the tension required. Getting it across the Falls was a major technological challenge. On June 12, a helicopter flew a yellow rope across the canyon. The rope was attached to the steel high-wire and a giant winch was used to slowly pull the wire across as the crew slowly increased tension to support the increasing weight. Weighted pendulums were attached every to keep the wire from twisting. To make the walk accessible to viewers worldwide, it was held after dark, with the first step coming at 10:16 p.m. local time (02:16 June 16 UTC). The time was also advantageous to Wallenda, as half of the volume of water going over the Falls is diverted for power generation purposes after dusk. Wallenda wore a microphone for the event which allowed Troffer to talk with him, while the public listened in, throughout the walk. Wallenda's chosen path took him across the widest part of the falls. He slowly inched his way across the slippery wire, praying and praising Jesus Christ as he went. As he took his first steps over the water, walking on a downward slope, he told reporters, \\"It's a beautiful view ... A dream in the making.\\" Later he described the first step over the falls as the toughest part of his journey. \\"Mentally, your mind goes, 'What are you doing?'\\" he recalled. When he reached the midpoint, he was roughly lower than where he started due to the sag of the wire. The second half of the walk brought him uphill, back to the same elevation at which he began. Wallenda did not falter or totter in the slightest during his walk, nor did he stop to do any extra tricks during the walk (as he often does). Talking to ABC reporters live, as he entered the final phase of the trip he admitted, \\"I'm drained ... My hands are going numb. I feel like I'm getting weak.\\" Later he said, \\"my forearm just started to cramp worse than it ever has been before\\", attributing it the stress of the day. Near the end, he stopped, got down on one knee, and blew a kiss to the crowd. He got up, pumped his fist, and ran the final few steps. He completed the crossing at 10:41 p.m. EDT, 25 minutes after he started. In so doing, Wallenda became the first person to cross directly over Niagara Falls on a high-wire. In the 1800s, a few tightrope walkers had crossed over the Niagara Gorge down river, but none had ever crossed directly over the Falls. He also set the world record for longest walk over a waterfall. Prior to Wallenda, the last person to cross the river on tightrope was James Hardy in 1896. According to Wallenda, it was the longest unsupported tightrope walk in history. He carried his passport on the trip and was required to present it to Canadian border guards waiting for him upon his arrival on the Canadian side of the falls. ABC required Wallenda to wear a safety harness for the walk. After the decision was made in mid-May, a spokesperson for ABC explained: \\"We had always made clear from the beginning that significant safety precautions would need to be taken. This is the outcome of that.\\" Wallenda was not happy about the decision, stating \\"It's disheartening‚ÄîI wanted to do it without anything.\\" The Niagara Parks Commission indicated it was unaware of such a requirement when they were considering approval. During the walk, Wallenda told his dad that he felt \\"like a jackass\\" wearing the harness. Many observers predicted he would remove the harness partway through the walk, but ultimately he did not do so. Before the crossing, Wallenda had promised that he only would remove the harness if it became a hazard during the walk. \\"When I first found out about it, there was no doubt in my mind I was going to take it off\\", he later said. \\"But as [the event] got closer and closer, I realized I had to honor my word. I've always said I'm a man of integrity.\\" He also acknowledged that removing the harness would have created contractual problems with ABC. \\"The way a TV network works, if something goes wrong, they fire people\\", he said. \\"If I would have dropped that tether, four people would have been fired because I'm too selfish to care or because it's all about me.\\" In addition to the harness, Wallenda wore a waterproof track suit and shoes custom made by his mother for the walk. Part moccasin, part ballet shoe, the shoes were designed to get a good grip when wet. Wallenda surrounded by the mist of Niagara Falls, midway through his crossing Project costs were between US$1.2 and $1.3 million, necessitating ABC's financial support (and with it, their demand of a safety harness). \\"I'd dare say that never in the history of the circus industry has there been one event that costs this much\\", said Wallenda. The production was a serious financial strain on Wallenda. \\"It's been a tough situation all around\\", he said a week before the event, blaming the lingering fight over the safety harness for inhibiting sponsorship deals. When production costs ran over the original estimate of $1 million, he appealed to the public for help using the fundraising website Indiegogo. He eventually met his goal of $50,000. Additionally, Niagara Falls, Ontario, mayor Jim Diodati asked local businesses to chip in, saying he hoped to raise $250,000. Ultimately, he helped generate about $200,000 of support from local business associations. The main causes of the overrun were the need to produce two custom cables ‚Äì one for the performance and a shorter one for practice ‚Äì and the need to hire a new helicopter company to set up the cable at the last minute, after the original one discovered they did not hold the necessary licenses. After the event, Wallenda said he had probably lost money on the event; however, he added, it was \\"clearly worth it\\" in the long term. With all but one bill accounted for, Wallenda said he lost less than $50,000 on the event. The fundraising, combined with several contractors lowering their bills, helped him get close to budget. \\"I think people still have the impression that Nik Wallenda is going to walk away from this thing making millions of dollars, but that's not the case\\", he commented. After completing the walk, Wallenda said it was more difficult than he had expected. \\"That mist was thick. It was hard to see at times. The wind was wild. It'd come at me one way and hit me from the front, and hit me from the back.\\" Weather instruments showed gusts up to 14 mph during the walk. Wallenda further remarked that the turbulent waters below made it difficult for him to see the wire. Before the walk, Jay Cochrane, a veteran wire walker who had unsuccessfully petitioned to walk Horseshoe Falls for 30 years, said of the local weather \\"Unpredictable is a mild word. It is unforgiving ... [Horseshoe Falls] can spray mist anywhere from 380 to 590 feet in the air. I've seen it, I've measured it.\\" He added that walking Horseshoe Falls was an opportunity \\"like none other in history.\\" Long-time circus performer, Jackie LeClaire, remarked \\"aerialists always try to calculate risk. Nik couldn't do that because this walk had never been done before.\\" Local historian, Paul Gromosiak, who has researched daredevil activity in the Niagara region for his books, said Wallenda's proximity to the falls made his act far more dangerous than any prior act. After talking briefly with reporters, Wallenda called his grandmother, who reportedly had been too frightened to watch the walk, in order to let her know he made it safely. In a news conference shortly thereafter, Wallenda remarked \\"I feel like I'm on cloud nine right now ... The impossible is not quite the impossible if you set your mind to it.\\" He credited a combination of prayer, concentration, and preparation for his success. The crowds present at Wallenda's tightrope crossing. On June 16, Engima Research estimated that one billion people had seen or heard about Wallenda's walk, up from an estimate of 410 million prior to the event. Niagara Falls, Ontario, mayor Jim Diodati declared that \\"the stars aligned perfectly\\" allowing the event hit its \\"full potential\\". Media representatives from Australia, China, France, Germany, Great Britain, Korea, and the Middle East were on hand to cover the event. Overnight Nielsen Ratings indicated that the two-hour special was the most watched television broadcast in the United States for the night. Initial estimates put the show at a peak rating of 7.7, representing almost 13 million viewers during the last half-hour of the program. When final numbers were released, the viewership number was upped to 13.3 million for the final half- hour, and an average of 10.3 million for the entire two-hour special. Viewership peaked at around 16 million. It was ABC's highest rated Friday night program since November 2007, and the highest non-sports summertime program on any of the major networks in six years. The program, together with the NBA finals, helped ABC beat their nearest competitor by 36% in total viewers and 88% in the important 18‚Äì49 demographic for the week. In Buffalo, New York the show peaked at a 48.5 rating/67 share for the last half-hour, meaning two out of every three TV viewers at the time in that area were watching the event. The rating possibly represented the highest summertime viewership for any program in history there. In Canada, the program averaged 3.9 million viewers, with viewership peaking as the walk ended with 6.8 million watching. The program set a new summertime record for most watched non-sports special. Viewership was highest in Toronto where the production brought in a 20.8 rating/50.4 share, meaning more than half of the city's television were tuned in. The morning after walking Niagara Falls, Wallenda drove his family to the airport so they could rejoin the Fabulous Wallendas Famous Family Circus in Branson, Missouri. Later on June 16, Niagara Falls, New York, mayor Paul A. Dyster presented Wallenda with the key to the city. He also said that the city may erect a permanent memorial on Goat Island to document Wallenda's feat. Dyster had initially been skeptical of the event, but was won over by Wallenda's personality. \\"The way he's been conducting himself since he's been in Niagara Falls has won him a lot of friends\\", Dyster explained. On the Canadian side, Diodati said he would like to erect a statue of Wallenda at Table Rock with a green screen photo booth to allow visitors to \\"participate\\" in the historic walk. On June 27, Janice Thomson said plans were in the works to install plaques near Table Rock and on White Water Walk. Previously, she described the event as a complete success, remarking that it had showcased the river's natural beauty to an international audience. On July 20 it was revealed that Niagara Falls, New York, was attempting to bill Wallenda an additional $25,000 for police and fireman overtime. City officials cited the state law passed to allow the walk, which read \\"Mr. Wallenda shall pay ... reasonable costs associated with security or law enforcement stemming from this activity\\". Dyster said to forgive the alleged debt would amount to \\"a gift of public funds\\". Wallenda called the request \\"disgusting and sad\\", saying \\"This was a great thing for the area ... [They] gave me a key to the city, and now they want to ask for more money?\\" He noted that the city staged a downtown festival to take advantage of the crowds, and said he should not have to pay the security costs related to the festival. His lawyer, John P. Bartolomei, said Wallenda was only responsible for money spent by the city in the park itself, which had already been more than paid. He also noted that Wallenda's contract was with the state parks commission, not the city itself. Senator Maziarz called the city's position \\"shortsighted\\" and accused Dyster of being \\"disingenuous\\". He noted that Dyster had been against the walk from the beginning and that the city had never tried to bill other entertainers for costs associated with their acts. On July 24, the city council passed a resolution encouraging Dyster to stop pursuing the alleged debt by a 4‚Äì1 margin. Dyster responded by stating he was legally obligated to continue his efforts, remarking \\"Since the council didn't establish the fee I'm not sure if the council can forgive it\\". He did, however, say he would ask the state comptroller for second opinion. On the Canadian side, Diodati and the NPC said Wallenda had fulfilled all financial obligations. Diodati added that he was not billing Wallenda for $10,000 of unbudgeted costs incurred by the city. \\"We're treating this event as an investment, not as an expense. We're quite happy with the way this turned out\\", he said. Wallenda says that the experience has made him less likely to stage a permanent attraction on the American side of the falls. According to The Buffalo News Wallenda was seen picking up cigarette butts and other trash long after most of the media had left. He grabbed a shovel and helped fill in the hole left by apparatus. \\"It's just something that has to be done\\", he said. \\"I'm not scared of working.\\" \\"We take great pride in being a zero-impact operation\\", he said prior to the event. A parks official said the area was clean and back to normal by 3 p.m. the day after the walk. Wallenda reiterated that he hopes to develop a lasting presence in Niagara Falls. \\"There will always be a piece of my heart in Niagara Falls\\", he remarked. \\"I do see a future here and hope to have a show in this area and hope to spend more time here.\\" He did, however, rule out a repeat performance saying, \\"No. That's not really my thing. I've done it. It's done.\\" Research released by Niagara University's Hospitality Training and Research Center on July 1, suggested that Wallenda's walk had brought in $3.3 million of revenue for the city of Niagara Falls, New York. The research indicated that 38,000 people gathered on the American side of the falls to watch the act, 41% of which were from out of town. Among the out-of-town visitors, 52% came specifically to see Wallenda. Niagara Tourism and Convention Corporation reported that hotel bookings and related business was up 30% in the two weeks after the walk. Website traffic and sales of multiple attraction passes experienced similar increases. Hotel occupancy in Niagara Falls, New York rose to 81.6% in June 2012, from 76.5% in June 2011. On the Canadian side, no official effort was made to calculate the economic impact, although Enigma Research said the event \\"might have done better\\" than the $21.5 million the company estimated before the event. Wallenda's feat has also been credited with creating a \\"surge of interest in circus and circus arts across the world\\". ===Nik Wallenda: Beyond Niagara=== A reality show, originally titled Danger By Design, following Wallenda and his family premiered on The Science Channel on June 18, 2012. The show's pilot had previously aired in 2010 under the title Life on a Wire, before Discovery decided to hold the show until after the Niagara Falls walk. The pilot episode, which tracked Wallenda's high-wire walk and bicycle ride in The Bahamas, was described as \\"a sometimes painfully candid look at the creative tensions ‚Äî and the strong familial bond ‚Äî between Wallenda and his dad, Terry Troffer, who got so stressed out during preparations for that stunt he wound up in the hospital\\" by the Sarasota Herald-Tribune. Later episodes showcased Wallenda hanging from a helicopter by his teeth, preparing for the Wheel of Death in Atlantic City, blowing himself up in a box, and retracing the steps of Karl Wallenda's fatal last act in Puerto Rico. The show focused on the science and engineering that go into Wallenda's acts. After two episodes had aired, the show was renamed Nik Wallenda: Beyond Niagara. The next week, on July 2, it was put \\"on hold\\" by The Science Channel. Wallenda said the decision was \\"not that surprising\\" given the limited marketing efforts and multiple name changes. The Science Channel declined to comment on the decision. ===After Niagara=== On June 20, 2012, Wallenda rejoined his family in Branson. He was greeted by a parade in his honor at the Silver Dollar theme park. For Wallenda, it was back to business as usual. \\"I never want to get complacent\\", he said in a press release. \\"I could get hurt just as easily on a wire here as walking over Niagara Falls.\\" On August 9 Wallenda conducted a tightrope walk across the Atlantic City beach from Sovereign Avenue to the Tropicana Resort, roughly in the air. According to him, the walk was a unique challenge due to potentially dangerous ocean winds. Additionally Wallenda was surprised by the large amount of sand that stuck to the wire and considered cancelling as a result. \\"I learned a lesson\\", he remarked. \\"There was a lot of sand on the cable and it actually made it a little bit slippery, definitely eerie at the beginning\\". Ultimately, he completed the half-hour walk without any visible difficulty. Large crowds were reported for the public event, with attendance estimates ranging from 100,000 to 150,000. Wallenda believes that the feat marked the first time that a wire walker attempted such a walk on any beach. The beach walk was done to promote Wallenda's new show, \\"Beyond the Falls: Nik Wallenda and the Wallenda Family Experience\\", which premiered at the Tropicana Resort on August 12. The show featured Nik, wife Erendira, mother Delilah, cousin Blake, and about a dozen other performers in a variety of circus acts including contortion, quick-change artistry, and juggling. Michael Richter served as the lead clown and the show ended with the Wallendas doing a bicycle pyramid on the wire. Amy Rosenberg of The Philadelphia Inquirer described the show as \\"an old fashion vaudeville variety act\\" and remarked \\"I dug the show and so did all the little kids around me\\". ===Balance=== On June 4, 2013, Wallenda's memoir, Balance: A Story of Faith, Family, and Life on the Line, was published by FaithWorks. Ghost written by David Ritz, the book details his family history, Christian faith, and his circus career. Ritz got in touch with Wallenda after his Niagara walk to pitch the idea. He then spent several months following Wallenda around and asking questions. Erendira, who has an excellent memory, supplied much of the dialogue. Balance weaves in themes of faith throughout, as it chronicles Wallenda's childhood, adolescence, and adult career, with particular emphasis on the ups and down of his marriage and personal life. It concludes with the Niagara Falls crossing. \\"One of the challenges of writing a book\\", Wallenda commented, \\"is there's things you probably don't want people to know about you ... It was very emotional telling these stories at times ... It is a challenge to reveal your life story.\\" Reviewer John Law remarked, \\"Wallenda is really juggling two books with Balance ‚Äì one about his tireless belief in God's plan, and the stuff readers actually want to know: The hardships, the drama, the thrill of life on a wire.\\" He said the book felt \\"rushed\\", likely in an attempt to get it out before Wallenda's crossing of the Grand Canyon, but said it is \\"worth it for the chapter on the Falls\\". ===Canyon walk=== On June 23, 2013, Wallenda highwire walked across the Little Colorado River Gorge in Navajo territory outside Grand Canyon National Park's borders about 40 miles east of the main tourist facilities. The event, billed as a \\"Grand Canyon crossing\\" and titled Skywire Live with Nik Wallenda, aired live worldwide on the Discovery Channel with a 10-second delay. Opinions varied on whether the event was truly a walk across the Grand Canyon. The Reuters news agency described the location as simply \\"the Grand Canyon\\", while the Associated Press described it as a \\"gorge near the Grand Canyon.\\" According to the United States Geological Survey, the Grand Canyon geological area includes the Little Colorado River Gorge. Wallenda originally obtained permits to walk across the canyon in 2008, and planned to make the trip as early as 2009. However, the walk was delayed due to substantial logistical hurdles. When the opportunity to cross Niagara Falls arose, the Grand Canyon walk was put on hold. Shortly after crossing Niagara Falls, Wallenda said he would try to make the Grand Canyon crossing \\"within a year\\". In August 2012, he said that he was \\"98 percent\\" certain that the walk would take place in May or June 2013 and said he would get \\"something in writing\\" that no safety harness would be required for the walk. On March 18, 2013, Wallenda announced that he had come to terms with The Discovery Channel for television rights. Little Colorado River gorge near Grand Canyon National Park. According to Wallenda, \\"There's a lot of updrafts and downdrafts, and the winds are hard to predict [in the Canyon]\\". To prepare for the winds, Wallenda walked a wire twice daily along the banks of a Sarasota river with fans watching. He used wind machines to simulate wind gusts up to and practiced during the heavy rain of Tropical Storm Andrea. Wallenda said it was \\"hard to prepare for [the updrafts] ... when it comes down to Mother Nature, we're not in control.\\" Wallenda Training for Canyon Walk At , the walk was the highest of Wallenda's career, about seven times as high as the Niagara crossing. He covered a distance of approximately in 22 minutes, 54 seconds, using a wire. He carried a balancing pole weighing . As the walk began, Wallenda realized the wire had become slippery due to gathered dust. He spat on his hands and rubbed his shoes for better grip. Shortly thereafter, he stopped and crouched down on the wire due to wind gusts. He later stopped a second time to break the bounce of the wire that his walking had induced. Throughout the walk, Wallenda could be heard praying, repeatedly saying \\"Thank you, Jesus.\\" Wallenda ran the last few steps then jumped off and kissed the ground. Completing the walk in 22 minutes, 54 seconds, Wallenda became the first person to highwire walk across a Grand Canyon area gorge. After the walk, Wallenda said it was more difficult than he had expected and that \\"it took every bit of me to stay focused\\". He said that dust had accumulated in his contacts and called the walk unusually stressful. However, he called the view breathtaking, and said the opportunity \\"was a dream come true.\\" Skywire Live drew an average of 10.7 million viewers in the United States, making it the highest rated program of the night. During the walk itself, viewership increased to 13 million. It became the highest rated live program in Discovery's history and won 71% of TV-related social media usage for the day. ===Skyscraper Live=== Spectators watch as Wallenda walks the rope from Marina City (right) to the Leo Burnett Building (left) in Chicago. During a live interview on Skywire Live, Wallenda said for his next feat he would like to walk between the Chrysler Building and the Empire State Building in New York City. The following day the New York City Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said the city would not grant permission for a stunt like that. Wallenda was unable to get permission to do the walk in New York City, but, in April 2014, announced he was scouting skyscrapers in Chicago, Illinois for a televised tight walk event for the Discovery Channel. Wallenda said he was very interested in tight walking between the Willis Tower with another nearby skyscraper. On November 2, 2014, Discovery aired the special, entitled Skyscraper Live, and an official mobile game, SkyBalance by Nik Wallenda, was developed by Tapinator, Inc. to coincide with the event. In the special, Wallenda completed two tightrope walks, setting two new Guinness World Records: one for walking the steepest tightrope incline between two buildings (19 degrees) and the other for the highest tightrope walk while blindfolded. ===Volcano Live=== On March 4, 2020, Wallenda successfully walked across the Masaya Volcano in Nicaragua, his longest stunt in terms of time on the wire. Before Nik's stunt, his wife Erendira performed an aerial routine over the mouth of the volcano. The couple had decided to add the extra performance the morning before the event, with Nik expressing nervousness before his wife took to the wire. Like her husband, Erendira donned a gas mask and a pair of goggles for protection from the volcanic fumes. During his walk, ABC required Wallenda to use a guide wire, to the chagrin of some viewers. Despite the required safety equipment, Wallenda was visibly buffeted by the wind and had to slow down to catch his bearings several times during the walk. During the last part of his ascent out of the crater, Wallenda removed his protective equipment to address the crowd. ===Future plans=== In the long run, Wallenda's goal is to achieve global recognition and celebrity. \\"I've had a vision for my name since I was very young, that I was going to take it to the top of my industry\\", he says. His wirewalking \\"wishlist\\" includes traversing the Bosphorus continental divide in Turkey and Inca ruins at Machu Picchu. He would like to do an event with the Eiffel Tower and Egypt's pyramids. \\"There's a lot of expectations on my end\\", he says, adding that he wants to \\"[reinvent] the circus\\". \\"Whenever we're someplace unique or different\\", says Erendira, \\"he's always looking around ‚Äì 'Oh, I could string a wire from here to there and walk there.'\\" Wallenda, who spent the summer of 2014 in Western New York with shows at Darien Lake and the Erie County Fair, hopes to develop a longer- term tourist attraction near Niagara Falls honoring stuntmen such as his family.Fink, James (May 9, 2014). Wallenda still working toward Niagara Falls plans. Business First. Retrieved May 10, 2014. ==Personal life== In 1999, Wallenda proposed to his future wife Erendira (n√©e Vasquez, from famous Mexican circus family) on a wire high during a performance in Montreal, Quebec. Having just performed a seven-man pyramid act with his family, he stayed on the platform while the family descended. He walked to the middle of the wire and got down on one knee, proposing to Erendira in front of 25,000 people. A week later, they were married. \\"I don't know if either of us could be married to someone who didn't perform\\", says Erendira. \\"I can't see either of us ever being happy sitting behind a desk.\\" Wallenda walks a tightrope at Canada's Wonderland theme park Wallenda credits God for his success, saying that what he does on the high-wire is a gift from God. He grew up in \\"a Bible- believing, God-fearing family\\" and describes himself as a \\"born-again Christian\\". Faith is \\"the most important part of my life\\", he says. According to family friend Michael Mascitto, \\"When he started doing some of these bigger stunts, he realized that he was developing a platform, or rather God was giving him a platform, to use his abilities for God's glory\\". Mascitto says Wallenda's faith has been strengthened as his profile grew. \\"He truly believes it's because God has given him this platform for a reason ‚Äî to glorify Him ... Him with a capital H.\\" Before every wire walk, Wallenda joins his family in prayer and he always wears a cross as he performs. He remarks, \\"The Bible says pray without ceasing and I'm always praying.\\" He denies that his stunts \\"test\\" God. \\"To test God would be to never train, never practice, and then to walk across the Grand Canyon; or to jump off a building, or throw myself in front of a truck\\", he says. Wallenda says he tries to live \\"an upright life\\" and be a good example. Despite his success, Wallenda wants people to think of him as just a regular guy. \\"I want people to like me, just for who I am\\", he says. \\"What you get is a regular person. I want people to relate to me.\\" Friends described him as a lighthearted guy who is always cracking jokes. Wallenda describes himself as a challenge-driven person. \\"Don't tell me 'It can't be done', because I'll find a way to do it\\", he says. \\"My whole thing\\", he says, \\"is I don't want to just break records. I want to set myself apart from any record that's been done before.\\" Wallenda lives by the mantra \\"Never Give Up\\". He believes that through hard work, one can achieve anything they desire. \\"I think [challenges are] what life is about\\", he remarks. \\"We all go through challenges. But once we get through them, we look back and say look how much our lives have changed by going through that challenge.\\" Wallenda and his wife own and operate Wallendas Inc. They have three children: Yanni, aged 21, Amadaos, 18, and Evita, 15. The children are free to choose their own professions, Wallenda says. Evita is said to be the most interested in following in her father's footsteps. \\"In the back yard we have a wire that's two feet off the ground and that's what's fun for my daughter. Kids want to do what their parents do\\", Wallenda remarks. Erendira and the children are always nearby; the six days they were separated from Nik while he prepared for Niagara Falls was the longest separation in nine years. ==References*Nik Wallenda: Beyond Niagara TV program official website *\\"SkyWire Live\\" (Grand Canyon walk) official website *\\"Skyscraper walk live\\" (Chicago walk) official website ===Niagara Falls crossing=== *Article on the technical and physical challenges faced by Wallenda and his team *Article on the Wallendas family history with detailed graphic of Niagara Falls crossing and pictures of past exploits by Nik Wallenda *Economic study (pdf) on walk's potential impact commissioned by Wallenda *Original proposal for the walk made by Wallenda ===Other feats=== *Today show video of record setting bicycle ride *Video of performance at Tropicana Casino, including Wheel of Death performance atop the building Category:1979 births Category:Acrobats Category:American evangelicals Category:American circus performers Category:American people of German descent Category:American stunt performers Category:Living people Category:Niagara Falls Category:People from Sarasota, Florida Category:Tightrope walkers Category:The Flying Wallendas ","title":"Nik Wallenda"},{"id":"20155507","text":"Jean-Yves Mvoto Owono (born 6 September 1988) is a French professional footballer who plays as a defender for Nybergsund.

Ralph Levett (1600 ‚Äì c. 1660) was an English Anglican minister who served as domestic chaplain to an aristocratic family from Lincolnshire with Puritan sympathies, who subsequently installed him as rector of a local parish. A graduate of Christ's College, Cambridge, where he became a prot√©g√© of the prominent Puritan minister John Cotton, Levett later married the sister of the wife of his friend Rev. John Wheelwright, another well-known early Puritan settler of New England. ==BiographyEarly life=== Ralph Levett was born in 1600 in High Melton, South Yorkshire to an old Yorkshire family, the Levetts, previously seated at Normanton and Hooton Levitt.Levett of High Melton, ThurcroftWeb, thurcroftweb.co.uk His father, Thomas Levett, was of middling rank in the local gentry, not owning the manor at High Melton, but identified as 'gent.' in local records.The Will of Thomas Levett of High Melton, Gent., 7 October 1622, The New England Historical and Genealogical Register, Vol. LXVII, Henry Fitz-Gilbert Waters, New England Historic Genealogical Society, Published by the Society, Boston, 1913 Ralph Levett's mother was Elizabeth Mirfin of a family who owned the manor of Thurcroft.Mirfin/Myrfin of Slade Hooton, Thurcroft, Brookhouse, Thurcroft Web, thurcroft.web.co.uk Deed of Mirfin to Levett and Eyre, Sawn Moor Manor, Sheffield Archives, Marrian Deeds, ThurcroftWeb, thurcroft.web.co.uk Levett enrolled at Christ's College, Cambridge, in 1617, where he took his B.A. and M.A. degrees, and was ordained in 1624, when he was named a deacon at York. Following his ordination, Levett spent time in the Boston household of Rev. John Cotton, a leading Puritan of his day. The practice of taking in postgraduate students for training in a Puritan rector's household was a well- established one, and Cotton had many such Cambridge acolytes, who came to learn the ways of carrying on a Puritan ministry.The Correspondence of John Cotton, Sargent Bush (ed.), Omohundro Institute of Early American History & Culture, University of North Carolina Press, 2001 ===Ashby cum Fenby=== Following his time in Cotton's household, Levett took up his post as private chaplain with the household of Sir Christopher Wray in Ashby cum Fenby, Lincolnshire.The Levett family of High Melton and the Wrays of Yorkshire had common dealings for centuries, and Ralph Levett would have been known to the Wrays, even though Sir Christopher Wray had relocated to Lincolnshire in the sixteenth century. The Levetts were related to many Yorkshire families familiar to the Wrays, such as the Wests of Firbeck Hall, the Wentworths, the Mirfields (Mirfins), Gargraves, Bosviles, Westbys, the Lindleys, Copleys, Hansons and other gentry families. Wray was the grandson of Sir Christopher Wray, Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales and a wealthy politician, having enriched himself with profits from the Royal mint. Sir Christopher Wray was lord of several manors in Yorkshire, as well as four others, including Grainsby, in Lincolnshire.History, Gazetteer, and Directory, of Lincolnshire, and the City & Diocese of Lincoln; William White, Simpkin, Marshall & Co., London, 1882 His son Sir William, (1555‚Äì1617) was created baronet, and was the father of two sons: Sir John Wray and, by his second wife Frances, daughter of Sir William Drury of Hawstead, Suffolk, Sir Christopher Wray (1601‚Äì1646). Although originally from Yorkshire, Levett apparently decided to remain in Lincolnshire. His post within the Wray family household, known as Puritan sympathisers, shielded Levett to some degree from the persecution by Archbishop William Laud of clergymen with Puritan sympathies. In 1636, by contrast, Levett's friend Wheelwright, whom he apparently knew at Cambridge, was driven from his post at Bilsby by the ecclesiastical authorities, and departed for the Massachusetts Bay Colony.Rev. John Wheelwright's lifelong friend Sir Henry Vane, Member of Parliament and an early colonial Governor of Massachusetts, married Frances Wray, daughter of Sir Christopher Wray. (Wheelwright was following John Cotton, who himself had fled to Massachusetts three years earlier to avoid imprisonment for nonconformity. American Jezebel: the uncommon life of Anne Hutchinson, the woman who defied the Puritans; Eve LaPlante, HarperCollins, New York, 2004 ) Still, the rigours of ministering to an aristocratic, if Puritan-inclined household, meant that Levett sometimes wrote to his former mentor Cotton for advice on handling tricky situations. In 1627 the novice Levett wrote Cotton, inquiring how to pray appropriately for his patroness when she was in the congregation, and Levett asked for particular guidance on dealing with entertainments he witnessed at Christmastime, including \\"cardinge\\" (card playing) as well as \\"mixt dancinge.\\" Valentine's Day caught Levett unawares when he was approached by the household's \\"2. young Ladyes\\" and asked to draw a name from a hat. \\"His Puritan principles,\\" writes Sargent Bush in his The Correspondence of John Cotton, \\"were clearly being challenged as he considered what was an appropriate response for him as a minister of God on the one hand and an employee of the family on the other. So he looked to his mentor for advice.\\" In Cotton's responses, one senses the subtle nuances required of some Puritan thinkers, as well as the collegial nature of the early Puritan ministerial cadre. Cotton gave Levett advice on how to pray for his patroness without appearing to flatter her, and he warned Levett against 'carding' and drawing names at Valentine's as they were 'lotteries.' Cotton had no problem with dancing, except \\"lasciuious dauncinge to wanton dittyes & in amorous gestures & wanton dalliances especially after great feasts.\\" In 1632, five years after Levett's letter to Cotton, Lincolnshire records show the marriage of \\"Mr. Ralfe Levit and Anne Hutchinson\\" in Bilsby, the parish of Rev. John Wheelwright and not far from Ashby cum Fenby.The New York Genealogical and Biographical Record, Vol. XLV, New York Genealogical and Biographical Society, New York, 1914 Anne Hutchinson was the daughter of Edward Hutchinson of Alford, and the sister of Mary Hutchinson, Wheelwright's second wife. Mary Hutchinson, John Wheelwright's wife, was the sister-in-law of her brother William Hutchinson's wife, another Anne Hutchinson, who later became prominent in the Massachusetts Antinomian controversy. ===Grainsby=== St Nicholas, Grainsby and the rectory Unlike his Puritan friends, Levett elected to remain in England. He left his post as domestic chaplain to the Wray family for the post of rector in a manor owned by his Wray patrons. In 1633 he began signing the transcripts at the church at Grainsby as 'Radulphus Levet, rector.' On 3 April 1635, when the previous rector Thomas Humphrey was buried, 'Ralph Levitt, M.A.' was presented to the rectory of the tiny village of Grainsby by Frances, widow of Sir William Wray.The New England Historical and Genealogical Register; Henry Fitz-Gilbert Waters, New England Historic Genealogical Society, Published by the Society, Boston, 1913 Perhaps the Wray family's endorsement provided Levett some measure of protection, or his brother's position as Chancellor and Commissary to the Archbishop of York helped shield him from persecution. Levett apparently held the living of Grainsby until at least 1649, when he signed the transcripts as 'R. Levet, rector.'Even in the 19th century, tiny Grainsby village, located seven miles south of Grimsby, only had some 15 houses and 114 inhabitants. In his Lincolnshire (Penguin Books, 1964) Nikolaus Pevsner noted that St Nicholas's Church had a tall Norman doorway and an order of shafts with scallop capitals. He described the hamlet as \\"attractive\\" with a \\"poplar-lined lane.\\" The tiny village seems an obscure outpost for a Puritan rector--but perhaps that was just the point. His son Francis graduated at Queens' College, Cambridge, also became a minister, and was rector of Little Carlton, Lincolnshire, from 1662 until 1711. (When the emigrant Rev. John Wheelwright finally disposed of the last of his Lincolnshire property in 1677, Massachusetts records attest that it was \\"purchased of Francis Levett, gentleman,\\" likely the son of his old friend Ralph Levett).Wheelwright Deed, Suffolk Deeds, Suffolk County, 1899 ===Family=== Ralph Levett's two brothers were both prominent Oxford-educated lawyers. His brother Thomas LevettA 'Radulphus filius Thomae Levett Jr.,\\" i.e. Ralph Levett son of Thomas Levett Jr., was baptised at St Andrew's Church, Kirk Ella, East Riding, Yorkshire, in 1638. It is possible that Rev. Ralph Levett's brother Thomas named a son after him. served as High Sheriff of Rutland, and his brother John Levett was a well-known figure in York legal circles, frequently representing the Archbishop of York. The two improvident brothers apparently dissipated what was a large estate of properties scattered across Yorkshire.The New England Historical and Genealogical Register, Henry Fitz-Gilbert Waters, New England Historic Genealogical Society, Published by the Society, Boston, 1913 Thomas Levett was well known as an antiquarian, and his disposal of monastic charters descended in the Levett family to Roger Dodsworth for publication was an important event in Yorkshire historical circles. Another brother, Peter Levett, also graduated from Christ's College, Cambridge, and became parish priest at Cantley, South Yorkshire, and Boynton, East Riding of Yorkshire, successively. ==References== *Sargent Bush, ed.

Prior to that, it was only a small colony encompassing roughly the 30-km-long peninsula on which Freetown is located. Initially, the British and Creoles (freed slaves and their descendants) of the Freetown colony had only a very limited involvement in the affairs of the African kingdoms around them; such as it was, it consisted mostly of trading and missionary activity. Over the course of the 19th century this involvement gradually increased. The colonial government was, in particular, interested in fostering trade as this provided it with its main source of revenue, in the form of customs duties and other taxes. This inevitably drew it into engagement with the African kingdoms, mainly by making treaties with the kingdoms or sending military expeditions against them. The treaties usually committed an African chief to protect merchants and maintain peaceful relations with his neighbours so that trade would not be disturbed; in return, the British would pay him a gift or annual stipend. The military expeditions were against chiefs who acted detrimentally to the colony's business interests by evicting traders, restricting trade, or warring with neighbours. After the Slave Trade Act 1807 abolishing slavery, the government also began pressing the chiefs, by treaty or force, to refrain from the slave trade. Since the wars between the chiefdoms were mostly slave- procuring wars, or otherwise intimately connected with the slave trade, suppression of the slave trade and promotion of \\"legitimate\\" trade in other products were both key to reducing wars between chief. In addition to commercial and anti-slave-trade motives for the British incursions into the Sierra Leone hinterland, military officers posted to Sierra Leone needed battle victories to enhance their reputations; and British felt culturally superiority and assumed that Europeanising natives was a proper and upright activity. ==List of interventions== This article lists some of the interventions into the Sierra Leone hinterland in the 19th century. { width=\\"100% - ! width=\\"40%\\"  Treaties !

Hundreds of additional carriers are impressed from villages along the way, sometimes by arresting their chiefs and flooging them if the carriers do not perform properly. In the early morning darkness of 23 December, at Waima (40 miles or 65 km past Panguma) this force and a small French force under Lieutenant Gaston Maritz mistake each other for the Sofa and engage in a gun battle, each suffering heavy casualties.

In 1898, the Sierra Leone chiefs sought to free themselves of British control in a rebellion called the Hut Tax war. It was the last large armed confrontation between British and Africans in Sierra Leone. The Africans' defeat ushered in the country's modern colonial period, which lasted until political independence in 1961. ==Sources== Arthur Abraham, Mende Government and Politics Under Colonial Rule.

Police actions on protests aimed at Chen suppressed the display of Taiwan's national flag and the playing of Taiwanese songs. This prompted a group of 400 students in Taipei, Taiwan to begin a sit-in in front of the Executive Yuan in protest of Taiwan's . == Background == The name chosen by the students for their initiative, \\"Wild Strawberry\\", makes a pair of references. The word wild recalls the Wild Lily student movement of 1990, which led to vast political reforms and Taiwan's first general democratic elections. The word strawberry makes ironic use of the term \\"strawberry generation\\", a description of Taiwan's youth employed pejoratively by their elders to portray the newest generation as \\"soft\\", lacking strength of character and political convictions. == Demonstrations == Protesters stage a sit-in, a female protester is holding a sign reading \\"human rights\\" () Protesting student Sit-ins began with students in Taipei in front of the Executive Yuan. On 7 November 2008, police began removing protesters from the scene and taking them to separate locations around the city. Having made a regrouping plan earlier, the students reconvened at Liberty Square in front of the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall. Following the lead of the students in Taipei, six other sit-in protests sprang up around Taiwan: * Kaohsiung, November 7 * Tainan, November 7 * Taichung, November 9 * Changhua, November 9 * Hsinchu, November 10 * Chiayi, November 12 == Student demands and government responses == The student-led sit-in protests were conducted in response to incidents of police violence and abuse of power during the visit of Chen Yunlin to Taiwan. The original protesters in Taipei issued a statement with the following demands: #A public apology by President Ma Ying-jeou and Premier Liu Chao-shiuan for police misconduct. #The immediate resignations of National Police Agency Director-General and National Security Bureau Director-General (). #An immediate review and amendment of the Assembly and Parade Law to ensure the right of peaceful assembly and expression. Government responses to the Wild Strawberry petition included these actions: *On 11 November 2008, Premier Liu made a statement to the Liberty Times as saying, \\"I will not apologize. With this kind of thing, you just wait one or two days and it will pass.\\" *President Ma Ying-jeou addressed the students on 13 November 2008, saying that, while he believed there was room for improvement in Wang Cho-chiun and Tsai Chao-ming's handling of public assembly issues, he saw no reason for them to step down. *On 11 December 2008, Wild Strawberry and Tibetan demonstrators at Liberty Square were forced by police to leave the site for failure to comply with the existing Assembly and Parade Law. *On 24 December 2008, an amended version of the Assembly and Parade Act passed its initial review at the legislature's Internal Administration Committee. The amended version of the law remained controversial at the time of drafting in May 2009. Proposed changes fell short of student demands for a law in Taiwan that resembles assembly laws in European Union nations and the United States that give priority to constitutional guarantees of rights to peaceful assembly and free speech. While the proposed amendments would make the new law generally more permissive than one crafted during the martial law period, proposals continued to give state police substantial powers of veto over the content and location of citizen rallies. == WildBerry House == On 4 January 2009, the movement stopped sit-ins.

Blakeney was second president of the British Fascisti from 1924 to 1926, and was later active in the Imperial Fascist League, The Britons, the British Union of Fascists, and the Nordic League. Edith and her close friend L. Fry (Paquita de Shishmareff) (1882-1970) spent about 10 years (1922-1931) researching many of the most important secret societies existing at that time in Europe and in the Middle East. They detailed their findings in Occult Theocrasy (2 vols.) (Chatou, France: British American Press, 1931-1933), a work whose publication was completed shortly after Edith's death. \\"Occult Theocrasy\\" is now widely regarded as a \\"conspiracy classic.\\" The work summarizes what was known at that time about the organizations and secret societies which collectively form what is now referred to, variously, as the Cabal, the Illuminati, the One World Government, the Secret World Government, or the New World Order. Although Occult Theocrasy is not an authoritative work in the strict sense, some sections of it are vastly more informative and revealing than others. Also, as a whole, Occult Theocrasy was more comprehensive and up-to-date in its subject-matter than any other similar work available in the English language at that time. The work contains overt antisemitic elements and attributes much of world history to a conspiracy of Jews. It gives credence to the infamous Protocols of the Elders of Zion, and has two chapters that express praise for the mission of the Ku Klux Klan.

Lord Queenborough, a son of Lord Alfred Paget (himself the fifth son of Henry Paget, 1st Marquess of Anglesey), was widowed from first wife, the former Pauline Payne Whitney (a daughter of fellow Americans William C. Whitney and Flora Payne Whitney), who died in 1916. After Pauline's death, Paget resigned from the House of Commons and was elevated to the peerage as Baron Queenborough. Edith's marriage to Lord Queenborough took place at the New York townhouse of Edith's parents, which was located at 1048 Fifth Avenue on the corner of 86th Street in Manhattan. Lord Queenborough was in New York visiting his late wife's brothers, Harry Payne Whitney and Payne Whitney and attending the Harding inauguration. After their marriage, the Pagets lived at Camfield Place, near Hatfield, Hertfordshire, England. The interiors of the house were designed by Edith herself.Robert Sencourt, Heirs of Tradition.

The battle saw the last remnant of the German East Asia Squadron destroyed, when was cornered and sunk in Cumberland Bay. ==Background== After escaping from the Battle of the Falkland Islands, and several auxiliaries retreated into the Pacific Ocean in an attempt to resume commerce raiding operations against Allied shipping. These operations did little to stop shipping in the area, but still proved troublesome to the British, who had to expend resources to counter the cruiser. On 8 March, his ship low on supplies and in need of repairs, the captain of Dresden decided to hide his vessel and attempt to coal in Cumberland Bay near the neutral island of M√°s a Tierra. By coaling in a neutral port rather than at sea, Dresdens Captain L√ºdecke gained the option of being able to intern the ship if she was discovered by enemy vessels. British naval forces had been actively searching for the German cruiser and had intercepted coded wireless messages between German ships. Although they possessed copies of captured German code books, these also required a \\"key\\" which was changed from time to time. However, Charles Stewart, the signals officer, managed to decode a message from Dresden for a collier to meet her at Juan Fernandez on 9 March. A squadron made up of the cruisers and along with the auxiliary cruiser found Dresden in the harbour because her sailors had joined a football match on the shore. The British ships cornered Dresden in neutral Chilean territorial waters in the bay on 14 March, challenging her to battle. ==Battle== Dresden sinking, Le Miroir 20 June 1915 Glasgow opened fire on Dresden, damaging the vessel and setting it afire. After returning fire for a short period of time, the captain of Dresden decided the situation was hopeless as his vessel was vastly outgunned and outnumbered, while stranded in the bay with empty coal bunkers and worn out engines. Captain L√ºdecke gave the order to abandon and scuttle his vessel. The German crew fled the cruiser in open boats to reach the safety of the island, which was neutral territory. The British cruisers kept up their fire on Dresden and the fleeing boats until the light cruiser eventually exploded, but it is unclear whether the explosion was caused by the firing from the British ships or from scuttling charges set off by the Germans. After the ship exploded, the British commander ordered his ships to capture any survivors from Dresden. Three Germans were killed in action and 15 wounded. The British suffered no casualties. ==Aftermath== With the sinking of Dresden, the last remnant of the German East Asian Squadron was destroyed, as all the other ships of the squadron had been sunk or interned. The only German presence left in the Pacific Ocean was a few isolated commerce raiders, such as SMS Seeadler and Wolf. Because the island of M√°s a Tierra was a possession of Chile, a neutral country, the German Consulate in Chile protested that the British had broken international law by attacking an enemy combatant in neutral waters. The wounded German sailors were taken to Valpara√≠so, Chile, for treatment, where one later died of wounds received during the action. The 315 of Dresdens crew who remained were interned by Chile until the end of the war, when those who did not wish to remain in Chile were repatriated to Germany.

The clock has four dials and was made by the Self Winding Clock Company. It was installed in 1913. Photo from December 23, 2009. The Self Winding Clock Company (SWCC) was a major manufacturer of electromechanical clocks from 1886 until about 1970. Based in New York City, the company was one of the first to power its clocks with an electric motor instead of winding by hand. A patented clock mechanism automatically rewinds the main spring each hour by the small electric motor. A contact switch mounted on the clock's center shaft is activated after the clock has run for one hour and the main spring is rewound one revolution. This rewinding occurs each hour. The power for the motor is supplied by batteries and the batteries last about one year. ==History== The Self Winding Clock Company clock movement was patented by one of the company founders, Chester Henry Pond (1844‚Äì1912) in 1884 (Patent No. 308,521). Pond was also a principal in the Gamewell Fire Alarm-Telegraph Company. He was an accomplished instrument maker and a pioneer in the developing field of electricity. He designed a small electric motor and matched it with a conventional clock mechanism. In 1886, Pond patented a correction device that used an electric current to activate a mechanical lever attached to the clock movement. This correction attachment would move the clock hands precisely to the hour (Patent No. 339,688). If the clock is not absolutely accurate, it would be corrected when receiving the hourly time signal over a telegraph line from a master clock calibrated to the US Naval Observatory. This correction was referred to as synchronizing, and many SWCC clocks were fitted with this option. The original SWCC factory was located at 205 Willoughby Avenue in Brooklyn, New York. This site was across from the Pratt Institute, and now is part of the Pratt Institute campus. Charles Pratt (1830‚Äì1891), the founder of Pratt Institute, was also one of SWCC‚Äôs original founders and the company started business in his buildings. The SWCC factory remained in Brooklyn until they moved to 75 Varick Street, New York at some time in the 1950s, to apparently make room for expansion at the Pratt Institute. In addition to doing the clock manufacturing in Brooklyn, SWCC had business offices at various locations in New York city throughout its long history. ==Self Winding Clock Company clock movements== SWCC Style F Vibrator movement Seven styles of SWCC movements. Styles C and B from 1886 to Style F from 1898 When Self Winding Clock Company started producing clocks, the vast majority of the actual clock movements were made by the Seth Thomas Clock Company and the remainder were made by the E. Howard & Co.. The most expensive clocks could be equipped with the higher grade movement made by E. Howard. SWCC then fitted their motor-winding components and synchronizing apparatus to the movements. The movements were mounted in cases of various designs, often in case styles similar to those of companies like Seth Thomas and E. Howard. The SWCC appears to have been manufacturing their own clock movements by 1892, for they are all stamped \\"Self Winding Clock Co\\". Earlier movements were stamped with Seth Thomas or E. Howard markings. The unique feature of SWCC clocks was the fact that the clocks were wound electrically. The success of SWCC depended upon the clocks being reliably wound every hour without failure. The hourly winding motor was the one element of the clock that was most likely to fail. Over a span of about 15 years, the design of the SWCC movements went through a series of modifications aimed at improving reliability. The first six different styles all had the winding motor added to the SWCC movement. The final design, termed the \\"F\\" movement or Vibrator movement, was a major improvement. This movement, with minor modifications, was used for the next 60 plus years. In this design, the motor proved to be much more reliable and was now an integral part of the movement rather than added on below the clock works. The \\"F\\" movement motor employed a vibrating up and down motion rather than rotary motion to re-wind the mainspring. SWCC imprinted all of their movements with serial numbers. The serial numbers were used for inventory purposes and were assigned in ascending order. It is possible to approximately date the time of manufacture of a movement based on the serial number. The first \\"F\\" movements were made in 1898 and were made into the 1940s. However, it is not possible to automatically date a particular clock by the movement serial number. SWCC had a practice of exchanging clock movements rather than servicing a movement and then returning it to the same clock. This results in rarely finding a SWCC clock with its original movement. Identification tag numbers also often do not match movement serial numbers because the tags were not changed when the movement was exchanged. The total number of \\"F\\" movements manufactured could be confusing. The lowest serial numbers are in the 33,000 range and the highest is in the 402,000 range. There were large numbering gaps and it has been calculated that probably around 200,000 movements were produced. ==The Self Winding Clock Company and the Western Union Time Service== SWCC Western Union clock SWCC Western Union clock interior The relationship between the two separate companies began with an agreement between Self Winding Clock Company and Western Union (WU) being entered into in June 1889. This agreement was for the transmission of time signals over Western Union telegraph lines to synchronize clocks made by Self Winding Clock Company. SWCC owned the clocks and WU installed and maintained them for a monthly fee, ranging from $1.25 to $2.00 per clock per month. SWCC was paid a percentage of the rental fee for providing clocks for the WU customers. If the clock movements required major repairs, they were sent to a SWCC repair facility and a replacement movement was installed by WU at the customer location. The partnership between SWCC and WU ended in 1963 when, as part of a lawsuit settlement, WU purchased all the rental clocks from SWCC. By the late 1960s, the time-service business had run its course and ceased to be profitable. Most of the clocks were simply abandoned. These clocks are sought after by many clock collectors. ==Notable clocks created by the Self Winding Clock Company== The SWCC clock's were usually used in synchronized time systems. Time systems that consisted of many clocks linked electrically to a master clock. The majority of the systems were installed in businesses, factories, banks, schools, and universities. Many railroads also relied on SWCC synchronized clock systems. Some clocks were sold as individual timepieces but most clocks were a part of time systems. SWCC offered many very elegant designs for their clocks and the clocks could be purchased to match any decor. These were essentially catalog items. There were however many special one-of-a-kind clocks and clock systems that were installed by SWCC. These were intended to be very important architectural statements. Two of the most significant installations were the clocks in the Grand Central Terminal and the enormous four-dial clock and lighting system for the Metropolitan Life Insurance building. The two pictured clocks of the Grand Central Terminal and the outside clocks on the Metropolitan Life Insurance building were just part of each property's very complex synchronized time systems. Grand Central Terminal had a master clock that controlled all the clocks at the terminal. Metropolitan Life had two separate master clocks. One controlled the motors for the four outside clocks, rang the bells in the bell tower and controlled the spectacular and very complex outside lighting system. Another SWCC master clock controlled 184 slave clocks throughout the original building. Complex SWCC synchronized systems were also installed in the London Underground. The underground installation started in 1905 and eventually included about 600 SWCC clocks.

After a disorganized upbringing he studied audiovisual arts, Dutch literature and English at the University of Groningen. He did not finish any of these studies. From 1998 on Hulst has been working for a number of prominent Dutch and Belgian newspapers and magazines, like Vrij Nederland, Esquire, Knack Focus, NRC Handelsblad, De Groene Amsterdammer, and De Standaard. In 2006 he made his literary debut with the novel Jij en ik en alles daartussenin (translation: You and me and everything in between.) In 2007 he produced, together with cartoonist Raoul Deleo, a hybrid between literary non-fiction and graphic novel, called De eenzame snelweg (translation: The lonely highway). It's the impressionistic story of a cross- country trip the authors made, commemorating fifty years of On the Road by Jack Kerouac. The book was nominated for a stripschap-penning and the Prix Saint-Michel. In May 2009 Hulst publishes Wolfskleren (translation: Wolf's Clothes), a novel that coincides with a rock-album by Hulst's Sponsored by Prozac-project. Hulst also is one of the main drivers behind the Dutch- language band De Meisjes. In 2012 his semi-autobiographical novel Kinderen van het Ruige Land (translation: Children of the Savage Land) was published to both critical and commercial acclaim, winning several smaller literary awards. After his publisher Meulenhoff failed to submit the book for both the Libris and Gouden Boekenuil-awards, two of the most important literary accolades for Dutch writers, Hulst changed publishers. At Anthos he published the travel book Buitenwereld, binnenzee (2014, translation: Outside World, Inner Sea) and the novels Slaap zacht, Johnny Idaho (2015, trans: Sleep Tight, Johnny Idaho) and En ik herinner me Titus Broederland (2016, Brotherland), both of which were awarded the Harland Awards Book Prize. In 2017 he published the travel book Motel Songs, which was accompanied by the musical album of the same name. That book was awarded the Bob den Uyl Prize for Best Dutch travel book. In 2018 Hulst published the novel Zoeklicht op het gazon (trans: Searchlight on the Lawn), a psychological portrait of Richard Nixon. Together with Wim Melis, curator of the Noorderlicht photo festival in Groningen, Hulst has created the photobook The Pursuit of Happiness (2009). As editor and essayist he co- created the Noorderlicht-publications Warzone (2010), which was about the war experiences of soldiers on international missions, and The Sweet and Sour Story of Sugar (2013). ==External links== * Official Website (in Dutch) Category:1975 births Category:Living people Category:People from Hoogezand- Sappemeer Category:Dutch musicians Category:21st-century Dutch novelists Category:Dutch male novelists Category:Jack Kerouac ","title":"Auke Hulst"},{"id":"20155837","text":"Beaumonts may refer to: * J B Beaumont * Beaumont children disappearance, an Adelaide, South Australia, incidence of 1966 ","title":"Beaumonts"},{"id":"20155864","text":"Pan teaching his eromenos, the shepherd Daphnis, to play the pipes, 2nd century AD Roman copy of Greek original c. 100 BC, found in Pompeii Deities depicted with horns or antlers are found in many different religions across the world. ==Horned goddess Hathor== Close-up of a triad statue depicting the pharaoh Mekaura being held by the goddess Hathor. Hathor is commonly depicted as a cow goddess with head horns in which is set a sun disk with Uraeus. Twin feathers are also sometimes shown in later periods as well as a necklace. Hathor may be the cow goddess who is depicted from an early date on the Narmer Palette and on a stone urn dating from the 1st dynasty that suggests a role as sky-goddess and a relationship to Horus who, as a sun god, is \\"housed\\" in her. Hathor had a complex relationship with Ra, in one myth she is his eye and considered his daughter but later, when Ra assumes the role of Horus with respect to Kingship, she is considered Ra's mother. She absorbed this role from another cow goddess 'Mht wrt' (\\"Great flood\\") who was the mother of Ra in a creation myth and carried him between her horns. As a mother she gave birth to Ra each morning on the eastern horizon and as wife she conceives through union with him each day. Bat was a cow goddess in Egyptian mythology depicted as a human face with cow ears and horns. By the time of the Middle Kingdom her identity and attributes were subsumed within the goddess Hathor. The worship of Bat dates to earliest times and may have its origins in Late Paleolithic cattle herding. Bat was the chief goddess of Seshesh, otherwise known as Hu or Diospolis Parva, the 7th nome of Upper Egypt. The imagery of Bat as a divine cow was remarkably similar to that of Hathor the parallel goddess from Lower Egypt. The significant difference in their depiction is that Bat's horns curve inward and Hathor's curve outward slightly. It is possible that this could be based in the different breeds of cattle herded at different times. ==Cult of the bull deities== In Egypt, the bull was worshiped as Apis, the embodiment of Ptah and later of Osiris. A long series of ritually perfect bulls were identified by the god's priests, housed in the temple for their lifetime, then embalmed and encased in a giant sarcophagus. A long sequence of monolithic stone sarcophagi were housed in the Serapeum, and were rediscovered by Auguste Mariette at Saqqara in 1851. The bull was also worshipped as Mnevis, the embodiment of Atum-Ra, in Heliopolis. Ka in Egyptian is both a religious concept of life-force/power and the word for bull. Mnevis was identified as being a living bull. This may be a vestige of the sacrifice of kings after a period of reign, who were seen as the sons of Bat or Hathor (see:horned goddess Hathor), the ancient cow deity of the early solar cults. Thus, seen as a symbol of the later sun god, Ra, the Mnevis was often depicted, in art, with the solar disc of their mother, Hathor between its horns. Isis with horns The Canaanite deity Moloch (according to the bible) was often depicted as a bull, and became a bull demon in Abrahamic traditions. The bull is familiar in Judeo-Christian cultures from the Biblical episode wherein an idol of the Golden Calf is made by Aaron and worshipped by the Hebrews in the wilderness of Sinai (Exodus). The text of the Hebrew Bible can be understood to refer to the idol as representing a separate god, or as representing the God of Israel himself, perhaps through an association or syncretization with Egyptian or Levantine bull gods, rather than a new deity in itself. Exodus 32:4 \\"He took this from their hand, and fashioned it with a graving tool and made it into a molten calf; and they said, 'This is your god, O Israel, who brought you up from the land of Egypt'.\\" Nehemiah 9:18 \\"even when they made an idol shaped like a calf and said, 'This is your god who brought you out of Egypt!' They committed terrible blasphemies.\\" Calf-idols are referred to later in the Tanakh, such as in the Book of Hosea, which would seem accurate as they were a fixture of near-eastern cultures. King Solomon's \\"bronze sea\\"-basin stood on twelve brazen bulls, according to 1. Kings 7:25. Young bulls were set as frontier markers at Tel Dan and at Bethel the frontiers of the Kingdom of Israel. ==Ram deities in ancient Egypt== Banebdjedet The ram was revered in ancient Egypt in matters of fertility and war. Early gods with long wavy ram horns include Khnum and the equivalent god in Lower Egypt, Banebdjedet, the \\"Ram Lord of Djedet\\" (Mendes), who was typically shown with four ram heads to represent the four souls (Ba) of the sun god. Banebdjedet may also be linked to the first four gods to rule over Egypt, Osiris, Geb, Shu and Ra-Atum, with large granite shrines devoted to each in the Mendes sanctuary. The Book of the Heavenly Cow describes the \\"Ram of Mendes\\" as being the Ba of Osiris, but this was not an exclusive association.Handbook of Egyptian mythology, Geraldine Pinch, p 114-115, Oxford University Press, 2004, List of Egyptian gods associated with the ram: * Khnum (one of the earliest Egyptian deities) * Heryshaf (a ram god of Heracleopolis) * Kherty (a variant of Aken, The chief deity in Egyptian mythology) * Andjety (precursor of Osiris, Auf \\"Efu Ra\\"). * Horem Akhet (a god depicted as a sphinx with the head of a man, lion, or ram) * Banebdjedet (ram god linked to the first four Egyptian gods: Osiris, Geb, Shu, Ra-Atum) * Amun (the ram deity that inspired the cult of Ammon) ==Cult of Ammon== Roman cast terracotta of ram-horned Jupiter Ammon, 1st century AD (Museo Barracco, Rome) The worship of Ammon was introduced into Greece at an early period, probably through the medium of the Greek colony in Cyrene, which must have formed a connection with the great oracle of Ammon in the Oasis soon after its establishment. Ammon had a temple and a statue, the gift of Pindar, at Thebes,Pausanias, Description of Greece ix.16 ¬ß 1 and another at Sparta, the inhabitants of which, as Pausanias says,Pausanias, Description of Greece iii.18 ¬ß 2 consulted the oracle of Ammon in Libya from early times more than the other Greeks. At Aphytis, Chalcidice, Ammon was worshipped, from the time of Lysander, as zealously as in Ammonium. Pindar the poet honoured the god with a hymn. At Megalopolis the god was represented with the head of a ram (Paus. viii.32 ¬ß 1), and the Greeks of Cyrenaica dedicated at Delphi a chariot with a statue of Ammon. Such was its reputation among the Classical Greeks that Alexander the Great journeyed there after the battle of Issus and during his occupation of Egypt, where he was declared the son of Amun by the oracle. Alexander thereafter considered himself divine. Even during this occupation, Amun, identified by these Greeks as a form of Zeus,Jerem. xlvi.25 continued to be the principal local deity of Thebes. The Cyrenaican Greeks built temples for the Libyan god Amon instead of their original god Zeus. They later identified their supreme god Zeus with the Libyan Amon.Oric Bates, The Eastern Libyans. Some of them continued worshipping Amon himself. Amon's cult was so widespread among the Greeks that even Alexander the Great decided to be declared as the son of Zeus in the Siwan temple by the Libyan priests of Amon.Mohammed Chafik, revue Tifinagh... Ram statues line the entrance to Amun's Temple Although the most modern sources ignored the existence of Amun in the Berber mythology, he was maybe the greatest ancient Berber god.H. Basset, Les influences puniques chez les Berb√®res, pp 367-368 He was honored by the Ancient Greeks in Cyrenaica, and was united with the Phoenician/Carthaginian god Baal-hamon due to Libyan influence.Mohammed Chafik, Revue Tifinagh... Some depictions of the ram across North Africa belong to the lythic period which is situated between 9600 BC and 7500 BC. The most famous Amun's temple in Ancient Libya was the temple at the oasis of Siwa. The name of the ancient Berber tribes: Garamantes and Nasamonians are believed by some scholars to be related to the name Amon.Helene Hagan, The Shining Ones: An Etymological Essay on the Amazigh Roots of the Egyptian civilization, p. 42. In Awelimmiden Tuareg, the name Amanai is believed to have the meaning of \\"God\\". The Ancient Libyans may have worshipped the setting sun, which was personified by Amon, who was represented by the ram's horns.James Hastings. In Carthage and North Africa Baal-hamon was especially associated with the ram and was worshiped also as Ba øal Qarnaim (\\"Lord of Two Horns\\") in an open-air sanctuary at Jebel Bu Kornein (\\"the two-horned hill\\") across the bay from Carthage. Silver tetradrachmon (ancient Greek coin) issued in the name of Alexander the Great, depicting Alexander with the horns of Ammon. The Egyptian god Ammon-Ra was depicted with ram horns. Rams were considered a symbol of virility due to their rutting behavior. The Horns of Ammon may have also represented the East and West of the Earth, and one of the titles of Ammon was \\"the two-horned.\\" Alexander was depicted with the horns of Ammon as a result of his conquest of ancient Egypt in 332 BC, where the priesthood received him as the son of the god Ammon, who was identified by the ancient Greeks with Zeus, the King of the Gods. The combined deity Zeus-Ammon was a distinct figure in ancient Greek mythology. According to five historians of antiquity (Arrian, Curtius, Diodorus, Justin, and Plutarch), Alexander visited the Oracle of Ammon at Siwa in the Libyan desert and rumors spread that the Oracle had revealed Alexander's father to be the deity Ammon, rather than Philip.Green 2007. p.382Plutarch, Alexander, 27 Alexander styled himself as the son of Zeus-Ammon and even demanded to be worshiped as a god: > He seems to have become convinced of the reality of his own divinity and to > have required its acceptance by others ... The cities perforce complied, but > often ironically: the Spartan decree read, 'Since Alexander wishes to be a > god, let him be a god.' Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, Alexander III, 1971 ==By continentEurope=== Cernunnos on the Pillar of the Boatmen Pan was a Greek god of shepherds and flocks, of mountain wilds and rustic music. Depictions in Celtic cultures of figures with antlers are often identified as Cernunnos (\\"horned one\\" in Latin). The prime evidence for this comes from a pillar in Paris which also features the Roman god Jupiter.Green, Miranda J. Animals in Celtic Life and Myth. pp. 227‚Äì228 Cocidius was the name of a Romano-British war-god and local deity from the region around Hadrian's Wall, who is sometimes represented as being horned.Green, Miranda J. Symbol and Image in Celtic Religious Art. p. 112. He is associated with warfare and woodland and was worshipped mostly by military personnel and the lower classes.Malcolm Todd, A Companion to Roman Britain, P. 209 The horned figure on the Gundestrup Cauldron. Eliphas Levi, the 18th century French occultist, believed that the pseudohistorical god Baphomet (that the Roman Catholic Church had claimed was worshipped by the heretical Knights Templar), was actually the horned Libyan oracle god (Ammon), or, the Goat of Mendes.Witches: true encounters with wicca, wizards, covens, cults, and magick by Hans Holzer Page 125 For many years scholars have interpreted the Gundestrup Cauldron's images in terms of the Celtic pantheon. The antlered figure in plate A has been commonly identified as Cernunnos. ===Africa=== A ram-shaped oracle god whose name is unknown (Baal Hamon ‚Äì Phoenician / Carthaginian ) was worshiped by Libyan tribes at Siwa. The figure was incorporated by the Egyptians into depictions of their god Amun that's considered an \\"Interpretatio graeca\\" of the Greek Zeus-Ammon. Adherents of Odinani (the traditional folk religion of the Igbo people of south-eastern Nigeria) worship the Ikenga, a horned god of honest achievement, whose two horns symbolise self-will. Small wooden statues of him are made and praised as personal altars.Vernantius Emeka Ndukaihe, Achievement as Value in the Igbo/African Identity: The Ethics LIT Verlag, 2007 ===Asia=== The Pashupati seal, a seal discovered during the excavation of Mohenjo-daro in Pakistan has drawn attention as a possible representation of a \\"proto-Shiva\\" figure.Flood (1996), pp. 28‚Äì29. This \\"Pashupati\\" (Lord of animal-like beings ‚Äì Sanskrit ')For translation of ' as \\"Lord of Animals\\" see: Michaels, p. 312. seal shows a seated figure with horns, possibly ithyphallic, surrounded by animals.For a drawing of the seal see Figure 1 in: Flood (1996), p. 29. Several Indus Valley seals show a fighting scene between a tiger-like beast and a man with horns, hooves and a tail, who has been compared to the Mesopotamian bull-man Enkidu, also a partner of Gilgamesh, and suggests a transmission of Mesopotamian mythology (see Indus-Mesopotamia relations).

This reverence suggests the divinity of its object, another anthropomorphic figure standing inside the fig tree. In the ancient Near East, the gods and goddesses, as well as their earthly representatives, the divine kings and queens functioning as high priests and priestesses, were distinguished by a horned crown. A similar crown is worn by the two anthropomorphic figures in the fig deity seal. Among various tribal people of India, horned head-dresses are worn by priests on sacrificial occasions.\\" in ===Americas=== The Horned Serpent appears in the mythologies of many Native Americans. Details vary among tribes, with many of the stories associating the mystical figure with water, rain, lightning and thunder.

The Douay‚ÄìRheims Bible translates the Vulgate as, \\"And when Moses came down from the mount Sinai, he held the two tables of the testimony, and he knew not that his face was horned from the conversation of the Lord.\\"Ruth Mellinkoff. The Horned Moses in Medieval Art and Thought (California Studies in the History of Art, 14). University of California Press; First Edition (June 1970) ==Influence on demonology== Pan having sex with a goat ===Christian demonology=== The idea that demons have horns seems to have been taken from the Book of Revelation chapter 13. The book of Revelation seems to have inspired many depictions of demons. This idea has also been associated with the depiction of certain ancient gods like Moloch and the shedu, etc., which were portrayed as bulls, as men with the head of a bull, or wearing bull horns as a crown. ===Baphomet of Mendes=== The satanic \\"horned god\\" symbol known as the baphomet is based on an Egyptian ram deity that was worshipped in Mendes, called Banebdjed (literally Ba of the lord of djed, and titled \\"the Lord of Mendes\\"), who was the soul of Osiris. According to Egyptian Mythology: A Guide to the Gods, Goddesses, and Traditions of ancient Egypt, the book's author Geraldine Harris, said the ram gods Ra-Amun (see: Cult of Ammon), and Banebdjed, were to mystically unite with the queen of Egypt to sire the heir to the throne (a theory based on depictions found in several Theban temples in Mendes). Occultist Eliphas Levi in his Dogme et Rituel de la Haute Magie (1855), combined the images of the Tarot of Marseilles' Devil card and refigured the ram Banebdjed as a he-goat, calling it the \\"Baphomet of Mendes,\\" (or, \\"Goat of Mendes\\"). The inaccurate description can be traced back to Herodotus' Histories Book II, where Herodotus describes the deity of Mendes as having a goat's head and fleece, when Banebdjedet was really represented by a ram, not a goat. The Devil in the Rider-Waite Tarot deck. The Baphomet of L√©vi was to become an important figure within the cosmology of Thelema, the mystical system established by Aleister Crowley in the early twentieth century. Baphomet features in the Creed of the Gnostic Catholic Church recited by the congregation in The Gnostic Mass, in the sentence: \\"And I believe in the Serpent and the Lion, Mystery of Mystery, in His name BAPHOMET\\" (see: Aleister Crowley: Occult). L√©vi's Baphomet is the source of the later Tarot image of the Devil in the Rider-Waite design. The concept of a downward- pointing pentagram on its forehead was enlarged upon by L√©vi in his discussion (without illustration) of the Goat of Mendes arranged within such a pentagram, which he contrasted with the microcosmic man arranged within a similar but upright pentagram. The actual image of a goat in a downward-pointing pentagram first appeared in the 1897 book La Clef de la Magie Noire by Stanislas de Guaita, later adopted as the official symbol‚Äîcalled the Sigil of Baphomet‚Äîof the Church of Satan, and continues to be used among Satanists. ===Neopaganism=== Francisco de Goya's Witches Sabbat (1789), which depicts the Devil flanked by Satanic witches. The Witch Cult hypothesis states that such stories are based upon a real-life pagan cult that revered a horned god Few neopagan reconstructionist traditions recognize Satan or the Devil outright. However, many neopagan groups worship some sort of Horned God, for example as a consort of the Great Goddess in Wicca. These gods usually reflect mythological figures such as Cernunnos or Pan, and any similarity they may have to the Christian Devil seems to date back only to the 19th century, when a Christian reaction to Pan's growing importance in literature and art resulted in his image being translated to that of the Devil. Image of a 19th- century Sabbatic Goat ===Witch-cult hypothesis=== In 1985 Classical historian Georg Luck, in his Arcana Mundi: Magic and the Occult in the Greek and Roman Worlds, theorised that the origins of the Witch-cult may have appeared in late antiquity as a faith primarily designed to worship the Horned God, stemming from the merging of Cernunnos, a horned god of the Celts, with the Greco-Roman Pan/Faunus, a combination of gods which he posits created a new deity, around which the remaining pagans, those refusing to convert to Christianity, rallied and that this deity provided the prototype for later Christian conceptions of the Devil, and his worshippers were cast by the Church as witches. ===Beelzebub=== Striding figure with ibex horns, a raptor skin draped around the shoulders, and upturned boots ,ca. 3000 BC, Mesopotamia or Iran, Metropolitan Museum of Art There is an implied connection between Satan and Beelzebub (lit. Lord of the Flies), originally a Semitic deity called Baal (lit. \\"lord\\"). Beelzebub is the most recognized demon in the Bible, whose name has become analogous to Satan. Occult and metaphysical author Michelle Belanger believes that Beelzebub (a mockery of the original name Jewish Encyclopedia) is the horned god Ba'al Hadad, whose cult symbol was the bull.The Dictionary of Demons: Names of the Damned By Michelle Belanger -Page 56 According to The Encyclopedia of Witches, Witchcraft and Wicca, Beelzebub reigned over the Witches' Sabbath (\\"synagoga\\"Witch hunts in the western world: persecution and punishment from the ... Page 87 - by Brian Alexander Pavlac), and that witches denied Christ in his name and chanted \\"Beelzebub\\" as they danced.The Encyclopedia of Witches, Witchcraft and Wicca by Rosemary Ellen Guiley. p. 97 Beelzebub was also imagined to be sowing his influence in Salem, Massachusetts: his name came up repeatedly during the Salem witch trials, the last large-scale public expression of witch hysteria in North America or Europe, and afterwards Rev. Cotton Mather wrote a pamphlet entitled Of Beelzebub and his Plot. ==Neopaganism== In 1933, the Egyptologist Margaret Murray published the book, The God of the Witches, in which she theorised that Pan was merely one form of a horned god who was worshipped across many European cultures. This theory influenced the Neopagan notion of the Horned God, as an archetype of male virility and sexuality. In Wicca, the archetype of the Horned God is highly important, and is thought by believers to be represented by such deities as the Celtic Cernunnos, Indian Pashupati and Greek Pan. Horned God in Wiccan based neopagan religions represents a solar god often associated with vegetation, that's honoured as the Holly King or Oak King in Neopagan rituals.

It has a broad spectrum of activity against Gram-positive organisms and a limited range of Gram-negative organisms.Antimicrobial Therapy in Veterinary Medicine, by Steeve Giguere, P. M. Dowling, It is found naturally as a fermentation product of Streptomyces fradiae.Tylosin, marvistavet.com (dead link 12 December 2018) Tylosin is used in veterinary medicine to treat bacterial infections in a wide range of species and has a high margin of safety.Tylan 200 Injectable - Product data sheet PA9063DENZP - Elanco Animal Health It has also been used as a growth promotant in some species, and as a treatment for colitis in companion animals. == Mode of action == Like other macrolides, tylosin has a bacteriostatic effect on susceptible organisms, caused by inhibition of protein synthesis through binding to the 50S subunit of the bacterial ribosome. == Spectrum of activity == Tylosin has a wide spectrum of activity against Gram-positive bacteria including Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Corynebacterium, and Erysipelothrix. It has a much narrower Gram-negative spectrum of activity, but has been shown to be active against Campylobacter coli, and certain spirochaetes.Tylosin, drugs.com It has also been shown to be extremely active against Mycoplasma species isolated from both mammalian and avian hosts.Tylosin-Tylan, petplace.com The following represents MIC susceptibility data for a few medically significant pathogens: * Mycoplasma bovis: 0.06 - 4 Œºg/ml * Staphylococcus aureus: 0.5 - >128 Œºg/mlhttp://antibiotics.toku-e.com/antimicrobial_1177_5.html == Clinical use == Tylosin has been used to treat a variety of different diseases throughout the world. Differing formulations and licensing conditions mean it may not be a recognized method of treatment for certain conditions in certain countries. In general, tylosin is licensed for the treatment of infections caused by organisms susceptible to the drug, but it has also been used as a treatment of colitis in small animals, as a growth promotant in food-producing animals, and as a way of reducing epiphora (tear staining) around the eyes of white-faced dogs. In these cases, the result is positive only when using the tylosin in the form of tartrate, a chelating porphyrin. No marketing authority exists for the use of other tylosin forms as a tear-stain remover, thus it is not legal to use it for such purposes; the exception is as a prescription-only medicine of last resort by veterinarians under the cascading rule (UK) or the extra- label use rule (US). Examples of bacterial infections that could potentially be treated with tylosin include respiratory infections, metritis, and acute mastitis in cattle; mastitis in sheep and goats; enteritis, pneumonia, erysipelas, and infectious arthritis in swine; and soft-tissue infections in small animals. While tylosin may be one appropriate therapeutic choice in theory for the conditions listed above, many other antibiotics may be preferable for treating a specific infection, and tylosin will not be the first choice. It is also used as a growth promoter for a variety of terrestrial and aquatic animals grown for human consumption.Hirsch R, Ternes T, Haberer K, Kratz KL (1999). Occurrence of antibiotics in the aquatic environment. The Science of the Total Environment, 225:109-118. == Available forms == Tylosin is available in injectable, intramammary, and oral formulations with different product ranges available in different countries. == Composition == Tylosin is a mixture of four major components: tylosins A, B, C, and D. Tylosin A is considered the major component of tylosin (comprises about 90% of tylosin); however, tylosins B, C, and D contribute to the overall potency of tylosin.Loke, M. L., and F. Ingerslev. \\"Stability of Tylosin A in Manure Containing Test Systems Determined by High Performance Liquid Chromatography.\\" == Precautions and contraindications == Administration of tylosin should be avoided in animals with a known hypersensitivity to the product, or to other macrolides. Oral administration can result in diarrhoea and gastrointestinal disturbance. This is particularly true of horses, such that it can be fatal.Tylan, americanlivestock.com (dead link 23 April 2020) Tylosin also has a foul taste that is difficult to disguise. The injectable formulations of tylosin can cause pain, inflammation, and itchiness around the injection site. Since tylosin has a relatively poor spectrum of activity against Gram-negative organisms, it may not be a sensible therapeutic choice in the treatment of infections caused by unknown, potentially unsusceptible organisms. == Drug interactions == Tylosin may increase digitalis blood levels, thus its toxicity, and may be antagonistic to chloramphenicol or lincosamides. Colorimetric assays of serum ALT and AST may be falsely elevated by macrolide antibiotics. == References == Category:Macrolide antibiotics Category:Veterinary drugs ","title":"Tylosin"},{"id":"20155892","text":"Mitemcinal (GM-611 or 3'-N-dimethyl-11-deoxy-3'-N-isopropyl-12-O-methyl-11-oxo-8,9-didehydroerythromycin) is a motilin agonist derived from the macrolide antibiotic, erythromycin. It was discovered in the labs of Chugai Pharma. Mitemcinal is orally administered and it is believed to have strong promotility (or prokinetic) effects. Promotility drugs relieve symptoms of reflux by speeding the clearance of acid from the oesophagus and stomach.Promotility agents The parent compound, erythromycin, has these characteristics, but mitemcinal lacks the antibiotic properties of erythromycin. Presently, erythromycin is commonly used off-label for gastric motility indications such as gastroparesis. If mitemcinal can be shown to be as effective a promotility agent, it would represent a significant advance in the GI field as treatment with this drug would not carry the risk of unintentional selection of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. This concept greatly intrigued Chugai, and the company pursued it as an ideal candidate for a long-term prokinetic agent to treat lower gastrointestinal deficiencies including gastroparesis. The Phase II trials did not detect an increase in gastric emptying among the population of diabetic gastroparesis patients above placebo. The Conclusion of the cited reference does not indicate that there was no benefit. On the contrary, the study said there was an increase in gastric emptying. Thus, although Chugai was able to demonstrate the required safety of the compound, development of this drug has stalled due to a lack of convincing efficacy data. ==Notes and references== Category:Macrolides ","title":"Mitemcinal"},{"id":"20155904","text":"In 1939 Montague won a one-hole golf match against Bing Crosby, using a shovel, a baseball bat, and a rake instead of golf clubs John Montague (August 25, 1903 ‚Äì May 25, 1972) was an American golfer, who also played some minor- league baseball. Under the name LaVerne Moore, which was his original birth name, he was charged with armed robbery and assault over a 1930 case in upper New York State. He was acquitted in a 1937 trial. Montague's life was covered in mystery and numerous stories about his extraordinary golf skills and physical strength. At the time of his arrest he lived with Esther Plunkett, and friends believed they were married.:File:John Montague with wife 1938.jpg After leaving the jail, he could not regain his previous golf shape, due to gained weight and lack of practice. Hence he focused on his real estate business and private golf matches with celebrities. His 1937 charity game against Babe Ruth, Babe Didrikson, and Sylvania Annenberg drew approximately 10,000 spectators. Montague qualified for the 1940 U.S. Open, but performed poorly there. He died of heart problems, in obscurity, at a residence motel in Studio City, California. ==References== Category:American male golfers Category:Golfers from New York (state) Category:Sportspeople from Syracuse, New York Category:1903 births Category:1972 deaths ","title":"John Montague (golfer)"},{"id":"20155935","text":"Tekin Kurtulus (born 16 September 1968, Usak, Turkey)https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1566069/bio is a German actor of Turkish descent.

He was born in Sheffield as the next to youngest child of Arthur William Thompson and Annie Willy. Too young to go to war, Thompson was encouraged to play for Sheffield school. ==Playing career== Thompson first joined Barnsley in 1917 as a 16-year-old amateur, he was on a trial and he managed to play in the afternoon match after the inside left was unable to; he scored a hat trick. He turned professional upon moving to Birmingham in 1918, a move he regretted later, as Manchester United and Liverpool were both looking to sign him. After this brief spell he moved to Swansea Town in 1922. In six seasons with Swansea he played nearly 200 league games scoring almost 100 goals as an inside forward, asgot part of the so- called \\"great little team\\" (being lower than average height), winning a Third Division South winners' medal in 1924‚Äì25, scoring the final goal to take them into the second division. In Swansea's first season in the Second Division, his 19 goals helped Swansea finish in fifth place in the league. He also featured prominently in Swansea's 1925‚Äì26 FA Cup run in which they reached the semi-final, where they were beaten 3‚Äì0 by the eventual winners, Bolton Wanderers. During the cup run, Thompson scored four goals, including the opening goal against Arsenal in a 2‚Äì1 victory in round 6 (quarter finals). The following season, Thompson was the club's leading goalscorer with 26 league and four cup goals, including a hat-trick on 8 January 1927 in a 4‚Äì1 FA Cup victory against Bury. On 17 March 1928 he was signed by Arsenal for ¬£4,000 but his career at Arsenal was plagued by a knee injury. He made his debut in a 2‚Äì0 defeat by Portsmouth on 28 March 1928 and at first shared the inside left position with Harold Peel, playing 17 times in 1928‚Äì29, scoring five goals as the side's penalty expert. However, with his injury restricting him, despite many operations, he only made nine more appearances in four seasons for Arsenal, and spent most of his time there regularly coaching the reserve team and under him they were the London Combination Champions from 1928‚Äì1931, and they won the London FA Challenge cup in 1930‚Äì1. After not making any appearances at all in 1932‚Äì33 he left Arsenal for Crystal Palace, having made 27 appearances and having scored six goals in total. He retired from professional football the following season. After Thompson retired, he reinstated as an amateur briefly at Islington Corinthians and later coached Tottenham Hotspur's reserve team, as well as a spell as a scout with Arsenal. Between 1947 and 1956 he was Arsenal's so called 'man in black' who watched the team arsenal was to play the next week, he featured in advertisements for Sandeman's Port, but no one ever discovered his identity, even when the daily express got a picture of him. On 26 August 1968 Len Thompson died of a heart attack aged 67.records created by Mike Thompson, Leonard Thompson's son. ==Honours== ;Swansea Town *Third Division South winners: 1926‚Äì27 == References == Category:1901 births Category:Footballers from Sheffield Category:English footballers Category:Barnsley F.C. players Category:Birmingham City F.C. players Category:Swansea City A.F.C. players Category:Arsenal F.C. players Category:Crystal Palace F.C. players Category:Tottenham Hotspur F.C. non- playing staff Category:Arsenal F.C. non-playing staff Category:1968 deaths Category:Association football inside forwards ","title":"Leonard Thompson (footballer)"},{"id":"20155989","text":"Oscar Wayne Tyrone (born August 1, 1950) is a former Major League Baseball player.

He was among Mexico's most-wanted drug lords. He joined the ranks of the Gulf Cartel in the late 1990s after he had served as a policeman in Matamoros, Tamaulipas. Under the tutelage of Osiel C√°rdenas Guill√©n, Costilla S√°nchez became a lieutenant for the cartel and started controlling several drug trafficking activities for the organization. In 1999, two U.S. federal agents were stopped at gunpoint in Matamoros by several gunmen of the cartel while conducting an investigation. Among the dozen heavily armed men were C√°rdenas Guill√©n and Costilla S√°nchez. After the tense standoff, the agents persuaded the gunmen to let them go but Costilla S√°nchez and the other cartel members earned a U.S. indictment. When C√°rdenas Guill√©n was arrested and extradited to the United States in 2003 and 2007 respectively, Costilla S√°nchez took the control of the cartel along with Antonio C√°rdenas Guill√©n, who was later killed in a gunbattle in November 2010. Amid the power struggles, Los Zetas separated from the cartel to work independently, transforming northeastern Mexico into a \\"war zone\\" with daily confrontations and gruesome assassinations. Costilla S√°nchez was arrested by the Mexican marines in the city of Tampico, Tamaulipas, on 12 September 2012. The Gulf Cartel, however, was suffering from an infighting by the time of his arrest. == Criminal career == Costilla S√°nchez was born on 1 August 1971 in the city of Matamoros, Tamaulipas; he is the son of a woman who worked as the principal of a middle school in Matamoros. At the age of 21, he became a municipal police officer in Matamoros and worked from 1992 to 1995, where he became familiar with the drug trade. Costilla S√°nchez then left the police and formed a kidnapping ring called \\"Los Sierra.\\" He joined the works of the Gulf Cartel in the late 1990s and become a lieutenant during the reign of then-leader Osiel C√°rdenas Guill√©n. The Gulf Cartel is responsible for the importation and distribution of thousands of kilograms of cocaine and marijuana into the United States annually. After the arrest of the cartel leader Osiel Cardenas, Costilla S√°nchez took control and became partner with Antonio C√°rdenas Guill√©n, Heriberto Lazcano and H√©ctor Manuel Sauceda Gamboa (El Karis). Sauceda was killed in a gun battle with the Federal Police on 17 February 2009, and Heriberto Lazcano transformed Los Zetas into his own cartel in 2010, becoming rival to the Gulf Cartel. Costilla S√°nchez is one of a number of high-ranking members of the Gulf Cartel who has been indicted in the United States for drug trafficking activities. Costilla S√°nchez has also been indicted for threatening U.S. law enforcement officials in November 1999. In that incident, FBI and DEA agents in Mexico were forcibly stopped at gunpoint by a group of heavily armed men, allegedly including Costilla S√°nchez and other key members of the Gulf Cartel. Costilla S√°nchez and the other cartel members were said to have pointed AK-47 rifles at the U.S. federal agents and threatened to kill them. After a tense standoff, the FBI and DEA agents were allowed to leave. When Osiel was arrested in 2003, Costilla S√°nchez joined the drug lord's brother, Antonio C√°rdenas Guill√©n, in running the Gulf Cartel's operations. The power struggle after Osiel's extradition in 2007 prompted for Los Zetas, the mercenary gang formed by ex-commandos of the Mexican Army and the former armed wing of the cartel, to separate and former their own criminal organization. Both groups officially went to war in early 2010, after a Zeta leader was assassinated allegedly under orders of Costilla S√°nchez. The fight between the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas transformed northeastern Mexico into a \\"war zone\\" with daily gunfights, decapitations, and other gruesome slayings. After the death of Antonio in a gunfight with the Mexican Marines on 5 November 2010, Costilla S√°nchez took full control of the Gulf Cartel and began directing the daily drug trafficking activities of the organization. The recent fights between Los Metros and Los Rojos, the two subgroups within the Gulf Cartel, were reportedly caused by Costilla S√°nchez, who set up his rivals to get arrested or killed by the government. Among other charges, Costilla S√°nchez is accused of being involved in the 2004 assassination of the journalist Francisco Arratia Saldierna, who covered drug trafficking and organized crime reports in Matamoros. In addition, the Proceso magazine alleges that Costilla S√°nchez had some connections with high-ranking military officials in the Mexican Armed Forces between 2011 and 2012. === Standoff with U.S. agents === On 9 November 1999, two U.S. agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) were threatened at gunpoint by C√°rdenas Guill√©n, Costilla S√°nchez, and approximately fifteen of his henchmen in Matamoros. The two agents travelled to Matamoros with an informant to gather intelligence on the operations of the Gulf Cartel. C√°rdenas Guill√©n demanded the agents and the informant to get out of their vehicle, but they refused to obey his orders. The incident escalated as C√°rdenas Guill√©n threatened to kill them if they did not comply and as his gunmen prepared to shoot. The agents tried to reason with him that killing U.S. federal agents would bring a massive manhunt from the U.S. government. C√°rdenas Guill√©n eventually let them go and threatened to kill them if they ever returned to his home turf. The standoff triggered a massive law enforcement effort to crackdown the leadership structure of the Gulf Cartel. Both the Mexican and U.S. government increased their efforts to apprehend C√°rdenas Guill√©n. Prior to the standoff, he was regarded as a minor player in the international drug trade, but this incident catapulted his reputation and made him one of the most-wanted criminals. The FBI and the DEA mounted numerous charges against him and issued a US$2 million bounty for his arrest. ===Gulf-Zeta cartels split=== In the late 1990s, Osiel C√°rdenas Guill√©n, the former leader of the Gulf Cartel, began recruiting members of the Mexican Army to protect his territory, personnel, and drug trafficking operations. These original deserters, who were known as Los Zetas, came from the Special Forces squadron of the army, arguably the best trained branch of the Mexican military. Upon the arrest and extradition of C√°rdenas Guill√©n in 2003 and 2007 respectively, Los Zetas strengthen its role in the Gulf Cartel, but managed to retain its alliance. Nonetheless, that alliance lasted until early 2010, when disagreements reached a turning point. On 18 January 2010, several members of the Gulf Cartel kidnapped V√≠ctor Pe√±a Mendoza, a leader of Los Zetas nicknamed Concord 3 and a close associate and friend of Miguel Trevi√±o Morales, alias Z-40. When he was held captive, Pe√±a Mendoza was asked to switch alliances and join the Gulf Cartel, but he refused, earning a beating and an execution, presumably carried out by Samuel Flores Borrego. Trevi√±o Morales heard about the incident and issued an ultimatum to Flores Borrego and Costilla S√°nchez: Both of the Gulf Cartel leaders ignored the command, and Trevi√±o Morales did not wait to avenge the death of his friend. On 30 January 2010, Trevi√±o Morales kidnapped and murdered 16 Gulf Cartel members in Reynosa, Tamaulipas, marking the start of the cartel war between the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas in the Mexican states of Tamaulipas, Nuevo Le√≥n, and Veracruz that has left thousands of people killed. Los Zetas used violent and intimidation tactics to expand, emerging with a notorious reputation as Mexico's most violent drug trafficking organization. Through these tactics, it has managed to take control of most of the territories \\"owned\\" by the Gulf Cartel where they had once essentially served as a single organization. ===PRI candidate assassination=== On the morning of 28 June 2010, Rodolfo Torre Cant√∫, the leading candidate of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) for the Tamaulipas state elections, was heading to the airport in Ciudad Victoria to close his campaign in Valle Hermoso and Matamoros, Tamaulipas six days before the elections. While heading to the airport, Torre Cant√∫'s convoy was ambushed by armed assailants, killing the candidate and six other people who were in his entourage. His death marked the highest-profile murder in the Mexican Drug War and the highest-profile assassination in Mexico since the death of Luis Donaldo Colosio, the PRI presidential candidate for the 1994 elections. By 2011 and into 2012, the Mexican authorities still did not have solid evidence to prosecute Torre Cant√∫'s assassins. Nonetheless, Costilla S√°nchez was linked to Torre Cant√∫'s assassination by the PGR and the DEA agencies on 20 September 2012. Reportedly, Torre Cant√∫ was killed by an armed squad directly linked to Costilla S√°nchez for refusing to protect the cartel's investments that allowed money laundering from drug proceeds. Tamaulipas' former governor, Tom√°s Yarrington, has also been linked to Torre Cant√∫'s death by the DEA since February 2012. ===Arrest=== The Mexican Navy arrested Costilla S√°nchez on 12 September 2012 at the residential Lomas de Rosales neighborhood in Tampico, Tamaulipas without firing a single bullet. Around 30 marines chased a convoy of gunmen that led to the house where Costilla S√°nchez was staying. Hours before the arrest, five men working for Costilla S√°nchez were apprehended in R√≠o Bravo, Tamaulipas. Costilla S√°nchez was presented on camera on the morning of 13 September 2012, handcuffed and wearing a long-sleeve shirt. Ten bodyguards of Costilla S√°nchez were also arrested during the operation. Ernesto Banda Chaires, one of the detainees, is believed to be the regional boss of the cartel in Tampico. In the Wednesday arrest, the Mexican authorities confiscated several assault rifles, pistols encrusted with jewelry, and a number of expensive-looking watches. When asked if he had anything to say about his criminal charges and if he had a lawyer, Costilla S√°nchez shook his head. His arrest came a few days after the apprehension of Mario C√°rdenas Guill√©n, the leader of one of factions in the cartel. Moreover, Costilla S√°nchez is currently detained at the installations of the SIEDO, Mexico's intelligence agency. Costilla S√°nchez was an evasive capo who preferred to stay low-profile. Only two photographs of him were ever made public prior to his arrest. It is likely that Costilla S√°nchez will be extradited to the United States, raising political implications for the top politicians in the states of Tamaulipas and Veracruz who have been accused of taking bribes from the Gulf Cartel. Among them is Tom√°s Yarrington, the former governor of Tamaulipas who is now a fugitive. If the testimonies end up being damaging, President Enrique Pe√±a Nieto will have to take steps to clean up the image of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which governed Mexico for 71 years and was tainted with an image of corruption. In addition, with Costilla S√°nchez's capture, the Gulf Cartel appears to be extremely weakened and the stage is set for Mexico's two largest criminal organizations ‚Äì the Sinaloa Cartel and Los Zetas ‚Äì to fight for the turf of the Gulf Cartel. This will be troubling for the government, which has vowed to reduce the drug violence that has left more than 55,000 dead in six years. Two days after the arrest of Costilla S√°nchez, 16 people were killed as a result of the Gulf Cartel infighting in two separate attacks carried out in Nuevo Laredo and San Fernando, Tamaulipas. Reportedly, a message was left aside the bodies, which were dumped in public view. Theoretical aftermaths The capture of Costilla S√°nchez and Mario C√°rdenas Guill√©n leaves the Gulf Cartel without a definite successor. Both arrests, in effect, wipe out the traditional old-time bosses of the cartel, putting an end to a generation of drug traffickers. When C√°rdenas Guill√©n was arrested on 4 September 2012, it looked as if Costilla S√°nchez had finally won the leadership of the Gulf Cartel. Throughout the end of 2011 and until the time of his arrest in 2012, Costilla S√°nchez had carried out a campaign to put down C√°rdenas Guill√©n and his faction ‚Äì the Rojos ‚Äì by reportedly setting up its members to get arrested or killed. His attempts to successfully put down his rivals allegedly gave him the protection of some high-ranking officials in the Mexican Armed Forces. Nonetheless, Costilla S√°nchez's own tactics backfired after a group of his henchmen arrested in R√≠o Bravo, Tamaulipas reportedly betrayed him and notified the authorities of his whereabouts. It is also possible C√°rdenas Guill√©n's declarations resulted in the apprehension of Costilla S√°nchez as well. Without a clear successor of Costilla S√°nchez, his faction ‚Äì the Metros ‚Äì could come to an end, although it is still likely that there are other old-crime bosses of lesser importance still trying to keep the Gulf Cartel operating. With the arrest of a Gulf Cartel representative in Colombia on 10 September 2012, the drug business could be disrupted even further. One clear benefactor of the fall of the Gulf Cartel is its rival group, Los Zetas. It is also possible that several within the Gulf Cartel may decide to join the Sinaloa Cartel or Los Zetas, although the latter seems unlikely given the bitter feelings between both groups. The Mexican government has essentially gotten rid of the leadership in both the Metros and the Rojos factions in the Gulf Cartel. The first possible group to take control of the smuggling routes in Tamaulipas is Los Zetas, who can decide to make a violent push into the last territories of the Gulf Cartel and finally take control of Matamoros, Tamaulipas. That city is the birthplace of the Gulf Cartel and has been the stronghold of the cartel ever since its creation. By taking Matamoros, Los Zetas will not only take a valuable drug corridor from the hands of the cartel, but it can score a major \\"psychological victory\\" over the Gulf Cartel. As of mid-2013, however, Los Zetas is also experiencing a power struggle within its own ranks, so the future of the Gulf Cartel is difficult to predict. The Mexican authorities believe that the next leader of the Gulf Cartel could be a woman, presumably one of the two sisters of Osiel, Antonio, and Mario. While women leading Mexico's \\"macho\\" criminal underworld is quite unusual, it is not entirely unprecedented. Enedina Arellano F√©lix of the Tijuana Cartel now manages the organization along with her son Luis Fernando S√°nchez Arellano. Another woman, Sandra √Åvila Beltr√°n, served as an important link between the Sinaloa Cartel and the Norte del Valle Cartel in Colombia until her arrest in 2007. The authorities believe that if one of the C√°rdenas Guill√©n sisters takes over leadership of the Gulf Cartel, it could serve to unite the broken organization. Nonetheless, InSight Crime argues that if the Gulf Cartel's last chance to regain its hegemony lies on a female successor, there is little chance that the cartel will ever recover. As previously reported by the agency, \\"drug queens\\" in Mexico tend to have difficulty commanding their cartels, and have been forced to work alongside men to legitimize their positions. In addition, the arrest of Costilla S√°nchez opens a bigger role for the Sinaloa Cartel in the state of Tamaulipas. Since their leader Joaqu√≠n \\"El Chapo\\" Guzm√°n and the Gulf Cartel tend to be \\"business-oriented,\\" both organizations may possibly strengthen their alliances by acknowledging that \\"violence is bad for business.\\" This is one reason why the Gulf Cartel and El Chapo might fight off Los Zetas together. Mario Ram√≠rez Trevi√±o, the right-hand man of the fallen Samuel Flores Borrego, was the next in line after Costilla S√°nchez. Nonetheless, whoever decides to lead the Gulf Cartel will most likely have a close relationship with El Chapo. The Gulf Cartel is knowledgeable of the trafficking routes and operations in Tamaulipas, and it would not be convenient for the Sinaloa Cartel to take them \\"out of the picture.\\" If the Sinaloa Cartel manages to have significant presence in Tamaulipas, the population can expect a decrease in violence just like in Tijuana and Ciudad Ju√°rez, which saw downturns in drug-related homicides after the Sinaloa Cartel gained control of the smuggling routes. ==Extradition and case== On 30 September 2015, Costilla S√°nchez was extradited to the U.S. along with twelve other criminals, including former high-ranking Beltr√°n Leyva Cartel leader Edgar Valdez Villarreal. On 1 October, he declared himself not guilty of the charges imposed at a federal court in Brownsville, Texas. On 26 September 2017, he pleaded guilty to conspiracy to possess narcotics with intent to distribute cocaine and cannabis, in addition to two counts of assault on federal agents for the standoff in 1999. His sentencing was scheduled for 18 January 2018. ==Gulf Cartel infightingBackground=== In the late 1990s, Osiel C√°rdenas Guill√©n, the former leader of the Gulf Cartel, had other similar groups besides Los Zetas established in several cities in Tamaulipas. Each of these groups were identified by their radio codes: the Rojos were based in Reynosa; the Metros were headquartered in Matamoros; and the Lobos were established in Laredo. The infighting between the Metros and the Rojos of the Gulf Cartel began in 2010, when Juan Mej√≠a Gonz√°lez, nicknamed El R-1, was overlooked as the candidate of the regional boss of Reynosa and was sent to La Frontera Chica, an area that encompasses Miguel Alem√°n, Camargo and Ciudad Mier ‚Äì directly across the U.S.‚ÄìMexico border from Starr County, Texas. The area that Mej√≠a Gonz√°lez wanted was given to Samuel Flores Borrego, suggesting that the Metros were above the Rojos. Unconfirmed information released by The Monitor indicated that two leaders of the Rojos, Mej√≠a Gonz√°lez and Rafael C√°rdenas Vela, teamed up to kill Flores Borrego. C√°rdenas Vela had held a grudge on Flores Borrego and the Metros because he believed that they had led the Mexican military to track down and kill his uncle Antonio C√°rdenas Guill√©n (Tony Tormenta) on 5 November 2010. Other sources indicate that the infighting could have been caused by the suspicions that the Rojos were \\"too soft\\" on the Gulf Cartel's bitter enemy, Los Zetas. When the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas split in early 2010, some members of the Rojos stayed with the Gulf Cartel, while others decided to leave and join the forces of Los Zetas. InSight Crime explains that the fundamental disagreement between the Rojos and the Metros was over leadership. Those who were more loyal to Mario C√°rdenas Guill√©n stayed with the Rojos, while those loyal to Jorge Eduardo Costilla S√°nchez, like Flores Borrego, defended the Metros. Originally, the Gulf Cartel was running smoothly, but the infighting between the two factions in the Gulf Cartel triggered when Samuel Flores Borrego was killed on 2 September 2011. When the Rojos turned on the Metros, the largest faction in the Gulf Cartel, firefights broke throughout Tamaulipas and drug loads were stolen among each other, but the Metros managed to retain control of the major cities that stretched from Matamoros to Miguel Alem√°n, Tamaulipas. ==Alleged ties with the Mexican military== The power struggle within the Gulf Cartel in northeastern Mexico throughout 2011 and 2012 was a sign of the organization's decline. Part of the shifting landscape, according to Proceso magazine, is attributed to the alleged protection the Mexican Armed Forces gave to Costilla S√°nchez. An anonymous source told the magazine that Costilla S√°nchez set up his rivals, the C√°rdenas Guill√©n family, to get arrested or killed by the Mexican Navy, consequently allowing him to emerge as the leader of the Gulf Cartel. Costilla S√°nchez reportedly gave millions of dollars to the Navy to allow him to operate freely in Tamaulipas, and in return the Navy reportedly protected his faction by ceasing to target them and going against the C√°rdenas Guill√©n clan. The last days of Costilla S√°nchez's leadership began on 3 September 2012, when several banners were reportedly put up in Ecatepec, State of Mexico, accusing the capitan of the Mexican Naval Infantry, Marina Efra√≠n Mart√≠nez Talamantes, of protecting Costilla S√°nchez. Nine days later, Costilla S√°nchez was arrested in an operative where not a single shot was fired. The anonymous source said that the Navy arrested him because the accusations were starting to gain some weight, while others said that once the Navy was done \\"using Costilla S√°nchez\\" to their advantage, they \\"betrayed him\\" so that his capture could serve as a symbolic medal for the Navy and the administration of Felipe Calder√≥n. The sources stated that before his arrest, Costilla S√°nchez was allegedly seeking to forge an alliance with Miguel Trevi√±o Morales (Z-40), one of the leaders of Los Zetas, the former armed wing of the Gulf Cartel. InSight Crime, however, states that the fact that the whole article relies on a single anonymous source and that there are no voice recordings raises suspicions about the reliability of the story. The agency does recognize that Costilla S√°nchez's ties with the Navy were possible, but indicated that \\"if his enemies were looking to make life difficult both for him and for the military units operating in Tamaulipas, feeding falsehoods to reporters would be an easy way to do so.\\" ==Bounty== Costilla S√°nchez was placed among the most-wanted drug lords in Mexico, and the government was offering a 30 million pesos (US$2.3 million) bounty for information leading to his arrest. In the United States, he has been charged with 12 counts of drug trafficking and money-laundering and is also wanted for assaulting a federal law enforcement officers in 1999 in Matamoros, Tamaulipas. The U.S. Department of State was offering a reward of up to US$5 million for information leading to his arrest and/or conviction. Costilla S√°nchez has several aliases, including but not limited to: Cos, El Coss, Costi, El Judas, George XX, and Sombra. ===Kingpin Act sanction=== On 20 July 2009, the United States Department of the Treasury sanctioned Costilla S√°nchez under the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act (sometimes referred to simply as the \\"Kingpin Act\\"), for his involvement in drug trafficking along with three other international criminals. The act prohibited U.S. citizens and companies from doing any kind of business activity with him, and virtually froze all his assets in the U.S. == See also== *List of Mexico's 37 most-wanted drug lords *M√©rida Initiative *Mexican Drug War *War on Drugs ==ReferencesBibliography== * ==External links== * Mexico 'Gulf cartel boss' caught ‚Äî International Business Times (Video) * Mexico Announces Capture of Gulf Cartel Leader (archive) ‚Äî New York Times * Presenta SEMAR a \\"El Coss\\", presunto l√≠der del c√°rtel de Golfo ‚Äî Federal government of Mexico (Video) Category:People of the Mexican Drug War Category:Gulf Cartel members Category:1971 births Category:Mexican prisoners and detainees Category:Living people Category:People from Matamoros, Tamaulipas Category:People sanctioned under the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act Category:People involved in the 1999 Matamoros standoff ","title":"Jorge Eduardo Costilla S√°nchez"},{"id":"20156107","text":"Geerdijk was a railway station in Geerdijk, The Netherlands.

Leonard, starring Robert Taylor, Brian Donlevy, Charles Laughton, Walter Brennan, and, in her film debut, Marilyn Maxwell. Suggested by a story by Laurence Kirk, and with an original story by Captain Harvey Haislip and R. C. Sherriff, the film's screenplay was written by George Bruce, John L. Balderston, and Herman J. Mankiewicz. ==Plot== During World War II, well-connected, Harvard-educated Lieutenant Gregg Masterman (Robert Taylor) enjoys his cushy posting as junior aide to Rear Admiral Stephen \\"Old Ironpants\\" Thomas (Charles Laughton), playing tennis and arranging social events. During a chance encounter, he gives bad advice to up-from-the-ranks Lieutenant Commander Martin J. Roberts (Brian Donlevy) out of spite. As a result, Thomas gives Roberts command of an obsolete, World War I-vintage destroyer, the Warren. To his dismay, however, Masterman finds himself assigned by Thomas as Roberts' new executive officer. When Masterman learns that Henry Johnson (Walter Brennan), the ship's civilian caretaker, was a member of the Warren's original crew, he helps him reenlist and serve aboard his beloved ship. Despite his awkward beginning, Masterman begins to turn into an effective officer under Roberts' tutelage, though Roberts has to constantly remind him that he cannot put the welfare of one person over that of the mission. On their way to rendezvous with a convoy commanded by Thomas, they are attacked by a Japanese airplane. Then, Johnson sustains a serious head injury during a storm, leaving him delirious and believing he is back in World War I. Finally, they rescue two pregnant women and 20 babies, survivors of a torpedoed ship. For comic relief, the crewmen (especially Masterman) have to deal with their unusual passengers. One woman gives birth just before they sight the convoy. An aircraft hit cripples Thomas's flagship, damaging the steering mechanism. Thus, when a Japanese battleship sights the convoy, it is all up to the Warren. Roberts informs Masterman of his plan of attack. He intends to set up a smoke screen, hide behind it, and then emerge to launch a torpedo salvo. When the captain is injured, Masterman assumes command. During the battle, Johnson takes over the helm when a crewman is knocked out. It takes two attempts, but the Warren sinks the enemy. ==Cast== *Robert Taylor as Lieutenant Gregg Masterman *Charles Laughton as Rear Admiral Stephen Thomas *Brian Donlevy as Lieutenant Commander Martin J.

The original intention was that the film would be about the Royal Navy in the Atlantic Ocean, but after the U.S. entered the war, the story was changed to focus on the U.S. Navy in the Pacific, the first naval war film made by MGM. ==Release== The film premiered on New Year's Eve 1941 in a number of cities, including Boston, Providence, Rhode Island, Washington, D.C., Chicago, Norfolk, Virginia, San Diego, California, and San Francisco,\\"Overview\\" on TCM.com but MGM had previously screened the film for naval officers on bases in California. ==ResponseCritical response=== The critical response to the film was not good, with the reviewer for Yank magazine saying that the film was \\"not about The War, but about Hollywood's War,\\" and other reviewers comparing it to In Which We Serve, the 1942 British naval film written by and starring No√´l Coward and directed by Coward and David Lean, with the earlier film being deemed superior. Bosley Crowther, the film critic for The New York Times, thought that Charles Laughton's performance was not his best, an opinion that Laughton himself agreed with, saying that it was like something out of H.M.S. Pinafore. ===Box office=== Despite the poor reviews, Stand By for Action was successful at the box office.

Heidi 4 Paws was syndicated to public television stations in the United States through American Public Television and WTTW Chicago in November/December 2008. Based on the 1881 novel of the little Swiss orphan by Johanna Spyri, Heidi 4 Paws closely follows the original 1880 best-selling novel, but with a canine twist. The young Heidi is sent to live with her reclusive Grandfather high in the Alps. Just as Heidi adjusts to her new life in the mountains, she is taken away by her social worker. Heidi finds herself living in the big city with Clara Sesehound, who has been made an invalid after a debilitating illness. Although Heidi comes to love Clara, her quest to return to the mountains dominates her stay. In the end, she is able to reunite with her beloved Grandfather. When Clara later comes to visit, she miraculously regains her ability to walk. Heidi 4 Paws is the first in an intended series of eight films that retell classic stories with live action dogs playing all the roles. ==Origins== Inspired by the 1930s MGM shorts, Dogville Comedies, children's television series such as Wishbone, and the family film Babe, writer/director Holly Goldberg Sloan (Angels in the Infield, and The Big Green) created the 4 Paws brand as a way to revitalize classic literature for a new generation. Three partners, Tim Goldberg, Tim Ellis, and Chuck Sloan, joined forces to create Goldberg Sloan, and made Heidi 4 Paws independently, without financial support from a major studio. The film took over four years to make, and features a blend of live action photography, 3D animation and visual effects. ==Characters== * Heidi: a golden Labrador puppy, Heidi is a precocious orphan who is abandoned into the care of her gruff Grandfather * Grandfather: a crusty sheepdog, Grandfather is an Alpine hermit whose life is changed by the love of his little grandpuppy, Heidi * Peter the Goatherd: a whippet, Peter the Goatherd is in charge of caring for Grandfather's goats, Daisy and Dusky. He becomes Heidi's first real friend * Clara Sesehound: a cockapoo mix, Clara is a wealthy invalid who asks her father for a companion and gets more than she bargained for in Heidi * Grandmamma Sesehound: a kind Labrador, Grandmamma brings peace to the Sesehound household and teaches Heidi how to read * Detie: a beagle, Detie is Heidi's social worker * Sebastian: an apricot poodle, Sebastian is the butler in the Sesehound household * The Doctor: a lovable old terrier, the Doctor is a good family friend of the Sesehound's whose kindness to Heidi helps to diagnose her chronic homesickness * Miss Rottenmeier: Clara's strict and fussy governess who takes an immediate disliking to Heidi but when Heidi leaves, she misses her and catches a cold * Mr. Sesehound: a German Shepherd, Mr. Sesehound is Clara's often absent but well-meaning father ==Cast== * Meghan Strange - voice of Heidi * Richard Kind - voice of Grandfather * Julian Sands - voice of Peter the Goatherd * Kimberly Beck - voice of Clara Sesehound * Angela Lansbury - voice of Grandmamma Sesehound * Joanne Baron - voice of Detie * Steve Guttenberg - voice of Sebastian * Stephen Rea - voice of The Doctor * Majandra Delfino - voice of Miss Rottenmeier * Marshall Bell - voice of Mr. Sesehound * Mike Fishburn - voice of Mr. Usher the teacher ==Other== Sixteen different dogs have roles in the film. All but two of the sixteen dogs were rescue animals, coming from local animal shelters. Only the title role of Heidi, played by eight-week-old purebred yellow lab puppies, and an apricot poodle playing the butler Sebastian, were from breeders. The title character of Heidi was played by nine different puppies. Since the dogs grew as filming progressed, they were only able to work for a week at a time before they had outgrown their role and their costumes. ==References== * Teamer, Shaunese.

He was the father of Henry Melville Whitney and William Collins Whitney, founders of the Whitney family business interests. ==Early life== Whitney was born on May 19, 1811, in the part of South Deerfield, Massachusetts that was then known as \\"Bloody Brook\\". He was the son of Stephen Whitney (1784‚Äì1852), a merchant manufacturer, and his second wife, Mary (n√©e Burgess) Whitney (1786‚Äì1868), the daughter of Dr. Benjamin Burgess. Among his siblings was Susan Whitney (wife of James I. Wakefield) and Mary Ann Whitney (wife of Theodore Billings). From his father's first marriage to Persis Locke, he was the younger half-brother of Stephen Whitney. Through his maternal aunt, Mercy (n√©e Burgess) Dawes, he was a first cousin of Republican Senator and Representative Henry L. Dawes. The Whitney family were descended from John Whitney (1590‚Äì1673) of London who settled in 1635 at Watertown, Massachusetts. ==Career== In 1835, when he was only 24, Whitney was elected and commissioned brigadier general of the 2nd Brigade of the Massachusetts State Militia, which he was largely influential in reorganizing. Upon succeeding to the management of his father's manufacturing business in 1838, he moved it to Conway, Massachusetts, where he became a large manufacturer.The National Cyclopaedia of American Biography, Vol. X, p. 154-155. New York: James T. White & Company, 1909. Reprint of 1900 edition. A Jacksonian Democrat, Whitney was town clerk of Conway from 1843 to 1852. He represented Conway in the legislature of 1851 and, in the same year, he was appointed sheriff of Franklin County. In 1853, he was elected to the convention for the revision of the state constitution, in which he was prominent in the deliberations of the delegates. Whitney again represented Conway in the legislature of 1854. In 1854, Whitney was appointed superintendent of the federal armory at Springfield, Massachusetts, by President Franklin Pierce, holding the position until 1860. He was a delegate to the Democratic National Convention of 1856 in Cincinnati, which nominated James Buchanan, and also that of 1860 in Charleston, which was wracked by sectional dissension before finally nominating Stephen A. Douglas. When Whitney left the Springfield Armory in 1860, President Buchanan appointed him Collector of Customs for the Port of Boston. He was removed, however, by the incoming Republican administration of Abraham Lincoln in 1861. Whitney then went into business in Boston. In February 1866, he joined Boston interests in organizing the Metropolitan Steamship Company, of which he was elected president. His son Henry was named its agent at Boston. The company operated steamships between Boston and New York City on the \\"outside line\\" around Cape Cod. The line named the iron steamer SS General Whitney in his honor in 1873. A member of the Massachusetts State Senate from the 1st Norfolk District in 1872, Whitney was president of the Democratic State Convention of 1876, which nominated Charles Francis Adams, Sr. for governor, and also that of 1878, which nominated Josiah G. Abbott for governor. ==Personal life== On November 23, 1836, Whitney married Laurinda Collins (1810‚Äì1908) in Somers, Connecticut. Laurinda, a daughter of William Collins and Eunice (n√©e) Collins, was a descendant of William Bradford, the Governor of Plymouth Colony. The Whitneys were the parents of two sons and four daughters, of whom the following received historical mention: * Henry Melville Whitney (1839‚Äì1923), who married Margaret Foster Green, daughter of Admiral Joseph F.

By the LM IA period (ca. 1450), or the end of the First Palace Period, these wares decline in distribution and \\"vitality\\".Dickinson, Oliver. 1994. The Aegean Bronze Age. Cambridge University Press. They have traditionally been interpreted as a prestige artifact, possibly used as an elite table-ware. The designs of kamares ware are typically executed in white, red and blue on a black field. Typical designs include abstract floral motifs. Surviving examples include ridged cups, small, round spouted jars, and large storage jars (pithoi), on which combinations of abstract curvilinear designs and stylized plant and marine motifs are painted in white and tones of red, orange, and yellow on black grounds. At this time, this characteristic type of pottery was produced, with red, orange and white painted decoration on a dark background. The Kamares style was often elaborate, with complex patterns on pottery of eggshell thinness. This small drinking cup shows a simple version. Sets of cups and jugs have been found, and it has been suggested that these may have been used in ritual, though Kamares pottery presumably also graced the dining tables of the First Palaces. Surprisingly, the first Kamares pottery found in excavation came from Lahun in Egypt, and was discovered by Flinders Petrie. It is now in the British Museum.

It stands on or near the spot of a Roman bridge, whose existence became known in the 1990s through the find of an ancient bridge inscription. == Roman bridge  Inscription stone === The Latin inscription stone was found at the antique site at Kemerarasƒ±, which lies at the foot of the Oinoanda hill (Urluca). Since ancient times, the place has been an important junction of the upper Xanthos valley. The existing Ottoman bridge runs parallel to the modern highway bridge. Lying face upwards, and largely intact, the limestone block measures 130 cm high, 64 cm wide and c. 42 cm thick. At the right side of the front face, a medium-sized chip makes textual additions necessary. Further difficulties arise from a number of peculiar spelling mistakes, which leads to the assumption that the mason was probably a Greek speaker.All data: === Dating === The inscription, and thus also the construction of the bridge, are dated to the reign of the Roman governor in Lycia, Eprius Marcellus, who is known to have held the office in the year 54 AD. By comparing its contents with the known chronology, Milner dates the construction more precisely to 50 AD, making a connection with road building activities which started in the wake of the Roman annexation of Lycia seven years earlier under the supervision of Marcellus‚Äô predecessor Quintus Vernanius. Probably, the Roman bridge should be understood as part of the Roman efforts to consolidate their hold on to the newly acquired province by improving the road system to move troops around more swiftly.All data: === Inscription text === Transcription (with additions): :TI CLAVDIVS DRVSI F :CAESAR DEVS AVG GER :MANICVS PONTIFE[x] :MAX TR[I]BVNICIAE P[ot] :X COS V IMP X II DES[ig] :P P PONTEM PER T [CL?] :EPRIVM MARCELLVM :[l]EG AVG PROPR SO A (Corrected and amended) translation: :Ti(berius) Claudius son of Drusus Caesar, God, Augustus, Germanicus, chief pontiff, with tribunician power for the 10th time, consul for the 5th time, with imperatorial acclamation for the '12th' (18th) time, co(n)s(ul) des[ig(nate)], Father of the Fatherland, (built) the bridge by the agency of T(itus) [Cl(odius)?] Eprius Marcellus, praetorian [l]egate of the Aug(ustus), so(dalis) A(ugustalis). == See also == * List of Roman bridges * Bridge near Kemer * Roman architecture * Roman engineering == References  Sources == * Category:Roman bridges in Turkey Category:Ottoman bridges in Turkey Category:Deck arch bridges Category:Stone bridges in Turkey Category:Latin inscriptions Category:Buildings and structures in Muƒüla Province Category:Arch bridges in Turkey ","title":"Bridge at Oinoanda"},{"id":"20156504","text":"La Grange is a historic home located at La Plata, Charles County, Maryland, United States.

He held the position for 15 years until his death in 1867.Former Provosts of Trinity College, Dublin From 1820 to 1827 he was the Donegall Lecturer in Mathematics at Trinity College Dublin. MacDonnell advocated Catholic Emancipation, at a time when it was unpopular within Trinity. His broad views encompassed both politics and education, and the significant changes he brought about are testament to firmness of character. His period of office is noted for the number of new statutes brought in, which transformed the college code of laws. It gave Trinity \\"a fresh impetus in its career and usefulness\\".The Gentleman's Magazine 1857 ‚Äì Obituary Another source described him as 'clever but very lazy'.Luce, J V ; Trinity College, Dublin: the first 400 years, p. 99 MacDonnell was said to have had 'an excellent dry sense of humour', demonstrated on one occasion when showing a lady around the impressive Trinity College Library, Dublin. She, clasping her hands together, exclaimed, 'Oh Mr. Provost, pray Mr. Provost, have you read all these books?', to which he replied, 'in time my dear lady, in time'. On another occasion, after the plates had been cleared between the courses of a dinner he was hosting, his butler quietly placed a sugar cube on his bald head. Engaging his guests on a serious subject, his parrot would by then have flown into the dining room and seated itself on the Provost's head to eat the sugar cube, as the Provost continued with his philosophical musings, giving the impression of being completely unfazed. ==Sorrento Terrace, Dalkey== Sorrento Terrace from Killiney Hill MacDonnell had inherited Knocklyon House near Dalkey, but after his mother died there the previous year, in 1837 he leased it out and bought a plot of land by the sea front at Dalkey, where he built a new country retreat, Sorrento Cottage, now owned by The Edge of the Irish rock band U2. Named after Sorrento on the Bay of Naples, the allure of Sorrento Terrace is its situation and the view across Killiney Bay to the Wicklow Mountains, the Great Sugar Loaf taking the place of Mount Vesuvius. In the early 1840s, MacDonnell devised a plan for the construction of 22 houses right into the corner near the boundaries of the cottage, a huge undertaking at the time that was stalled almost immediately due to the Great Famine - the family having decided to help those around them rather than themselves. In 1845, the family had built the first and largest of the terrace residences, 'Sorrento House', and then MacDonnell leased the rest of the land to his son, Hercules Henry Graves MacDonnell, who from the 1850s built the remaining houses at a price of ¬£1,000 each. The family stipulated that each house had to adhere strictly to the design of architects Frederick Darley and Nathaniel Montgomery. The houses today are known as 'millionaire's row', famous for being the most expensive row of houses in Ireland.What is it about Sorrento Terrace that has made it Ireland's most sought after address? ==Family== In 1810, Richard MacDonnell married Jane Graves, daughter of the Very Rev. Richard Graves, and sister of Robert James Graves. They were the parents of fourteen children, including Sir Richard Graves MacDonnell and Major-General Arthur Robert MacDonnell.A genealogical survey of the peerage of Britain as well as the royal families of Europe He was the uncle of Francis Brinkley and Richard Charles Mayne, and the uncle and guardian of Edmund Allen Meredith, the principal of McGill University in Montreal. ==References== Category:1787 births Category:1867 deaths Category:Donegall Lecturers of Mathematics at Trinity College Dublin Category:Fellows of Trinity College Dublin Category:Irish mathematicians Category:People from County Cork Category:Provosts of Trinity College Dublin ","title":"Richard MacDonnell (scholar)"},{"id":"20156679","text":"My Life as a Snypa is the first album by the rap group Snypaz.

The trilogy consists of three songs that feature the same basic title, tune and chorus lyric: \\"Out Come the Freaks\\" (1981), \\"(Return to the Valley of) Out Come the Freaks\\" (1983), and \\"Out Come The Freaks\\" (1987) (later issued as \\"Out Come the Freaks (Again)\\".) Despite the three songs' abundant similarities, each song is distinctive, as differing lyrics in the verses of each song tell stories about different societal outcasts. As well, each recording had a different contemporary sound, a thoroughly different arrangement, and reworked the melody while still retaining the chorus vocal: Woodwork squeaks, and out comes the freaks. ==Recordings\\"Out Come the Freaks\\" (1981)=== The original recording was the opening song on the groups d√©but album Was (Not Was). This version began with the chorus sung several times simultaneously by a number of vocalists before the rhythm section is introduced. The single became a club hit in the US and peaked at #16 on the Billboard Hot Dance Club Play Chart. The song's parent album was later renamed Out Come The Freaks when it was remastered and expanded in 2004. A companion remix album is titled (The) Woodwork Squeaks. ===\\"(Return to the Valley of) Out Come the Freaks\\" (1983)=== The second recording is slower and sparser as opposed to the post-disco sound of the original. This version is sung by Harry Bowens, who sings the Woodwork Squeaks chorus as more of a refrain than a chant. This version adds a new introductory verse which sets up the concept of the song. The final chorus replaces the words \\"the freaks\\" with a succession of song titles including \\"Papa's Got A Brand New Bag\\" and \\"The Shadow of Your Smile\\", implying a more positive spin on the idea of a \\"freak\\" to counterpoint the earlier verses. \\"(Return to the Valley of) Out Come the Freaks\\" was the only single from Born to Laugh at Tornadoes to chart in the UK, and was also their first hit in that country, hitting the UK top 50. This version of the song also appears as a hidden track (at the end of track 11, Walk The Dinosaur) on the compilation album Hello Dad... I'm In Jail. ===\\"Out Come the Freaks (Again)\\" (1988)=== The third \\"Out Come The Freaks\\" recording was released in 1987 and included on the group's most successful album What Up, Dog?. It was eventually also released as one of the final singles from the album in the UK, and again peaked just inside the UK top 50. The song was listed as \\"Out Come the Freaks\\" on the album but reference to the songs reworked status was acknowledged in the inclusion of the subtitle 'Again' on the single's release. The single version was also alternatively titled \\"(Stuck Inside of Detroit With the) Out Come the Freaks (Again)\\". This recording was once again dominated by the vocal of Harry Bowens, but a female vocalist sang the chorus refrain. The arrangement was more upbeat than the second recording but had a tighter Funk and Synth-Pop sound. The introductory verse was retained but the other verses were changed to feature different characters to the earlier versions. Instead of song titles, the more positive final chorus listed real people such as Leon Trotsky and John Coltrane. ===\\"Look What's Back\\" (1990)=== A fourth song related to \\"Out Come the Freaks\\" called \\"Look What's Back\\" appears as the final track on the group's fourth album Are You Okay? in 1990. The song is a 43-second acoustic camp-fire rendition in which the group chants the chorus: 'Woodwork squeaks, and out comes the freaks'. ==Remixes== ;\\"Out Come the Freaks\\" * Album Version ‚Äì 5:37 * Seven Inch ‚Äì 4:28 * Extended Version ‚Äì 6:39 * Dub Version ‚Äì 6:10 * \\"Tell Me That I'm Dreaming (Souped Up Version)\\" / \\"Out Come the Freaks (Dub Version)\\" ‚Äì 12:50 * Classic 12\\" Version ‚Äì 7:12 * Predominantly Funk Version ‚Äì 12:25 ;\\"(Return to the Valley of) Out Come the Freaks\\" * Album Version ‚Äì 4:22 * Seven Inch ‚Äì 3:45 * Extended Version ‚Äì 8:45 ;\\"Out Come the Freaks (Again)\\" * Album Version ‚Äì 4:35 * The Mighty Mook Mix * The Bobby Maggot Mix ==Chart positions== { !

He played in four of the first five games but missed the rest of the season due to a shoulder injury. In 2005, he recorded his first touchdown, his first 1,000-yard receiving season and his first CFL All-star selection. He was part of the 2005 Alouettes' foursome of 1,000-yard receivers, tying the record (set by the 2004 Alouettes receivers of Ben Cahoon with 1183 yards, Jeremaine Copeland with 1154 yards, Thyron Anderson with 1147 yards, and Kwame Cavil with 1090 yards) for most 1,000-yard receivers on one team in a season. Kerry Watkins' 1364 yards receiving on the 2005 Alouettes team combined with the performance of Watkins' fellow Alouette receivers Terry Vaughn (1113 yards), Ben Cahoon (1067 yards), and Dave Stala (1037 yards) making the 2005 Alouettes only the second team in CFL history to have four receivers on one team reaching the 1,000-yard receiving mark in one season. Watkins' 2005 season was statistically his best, setting career highs in receptions (97), yardage (1,364) and longest reception (75 yards) while also scoring the second-most touchdowns in a season with nine. In 2008, Watkins scored ten touchdowns. Watkins would go on to record five straight 1,000-yard seasons between 2005 and 2009 while falling just short in 2010 with 970 after he missed five games due to injury. He won Grey Cup championships with the Alouettes in 2009 and 2010, making a critical 17-yard catch in the 2009 game to put the Alouettes in field goal range to kick the winning points. His 2011 season was curtailed due to injury where he only managed to catch 31 passes for 395 yards and three touchdowns. Nonetheless, he finished the season in second place on the Alouettes all-time receptions list at 515 catches, behind all-time franchise and CFL leader Ben Cahoon.

He worked in Rome beginning sometime around 1456 and was active until 1476. He is most famous for his bronze medallion work under Pope Paul II. Cristoforo did a number of medals and jewellery for royal and noble commissions. == Life == Cristoforo di Geremia's date of birth is unknown. He was most likely the son of Geremia di Nicolino dei Geremei, a Mantuan goldsmith whose name was prevalent in documents from Mantua between the years of 1438 and 1480. Cristoforo di Geremia died at the age of 46, while at what was considered the peak of his professional career. Cristoforo di Geremia studied at the Mantuan school and was most influenced by Mantegna, who was a mentor to Cristoforo. Many of Mantegna's techniques are seen in Cristoforo's work. Although very little is known about his early professional career, it is known that Cristoforo was very interested in the art of antiquity. Many of his works contain various nuances gathered from ancient Roman coins. === Early works in Rome === Cristoforo di Geremia arrived in Rome around 1456. He spent the majority of his life in Rome, but his teachings from the Mantuan school were the most influential on his work. Cristoforo worked independently until 1461, when he was employed by Cardinal Lodovico Trevisan, a known admirer and collector of ancient art. With Cardinal Trevisan as his patron, Cristoforo traveled with the commander of the papal troops to Perugia in 1461 and to Florence in 1462. During this time, Cristoforo di Geremia was also employed by the Gonzaga family. He stayed as a guest for a month with Lodovico at the Gonzaga court. Upon his departure, he gifted his hosts four antique busts. Cristoforo also produced a characterized portrait of Lodovico Trevisan in medallion form. The medallion shows Cristoforo's passion for the art of antiquity through the construction of the profile of Trevisan. The medal is similar to the busts of a late Roman emperor. The reverse of Trevisan's medal is also indicative of Roman ties based on other coins of that period. It is rumored that in 1466, Cristoforo made jewelry for Borso d'Este, Duke of Ferrara. === Under the papacy === After Trevisan died in 1465, Cristoforo was employed by the papal court. Pope Paul II employed Cristoforo di Geremia as his primary medallist. Pope Paul II is considered the first pontiff to realize the potential of medals as an instrument of the state and for personal propaganda. Because of this, he had more medals produced than any other 15th century Pope.De Winter, Patrick M. ‚ÄúRecent Accessions of Italian Renaissance Decorative Arts, Part I: Incorporating Notes on the Sculptor Severo Da Ravenna.‚Äù The Bulletin of the Cleveland Museum of Art, vol. 73, no. 3, 1986, pp. 74‚Äì138., www.jstor.org/stable/25159934. While in service to the Pope, Cristoforo primarily produced variations of two different medals. The first was oval shaped and made to commemorate his pontification and political shrewdness. The second medal was circular and was produced to recognize his various campaigns at the Palazzo San Marco. One side has Pope Paul II's profile. The inscription on it reads \\"PAVLO VENETO PAPE II - ITALICE PACIS FVNDATORI - ROMA\\", which translates to \\"Pope Paul II Venetian - Founder of the Peace of Italy - Rome\\". The back shows Pope Paul II's coat of arms, from his status as the Venetian cardinal Pietro Barbo, and includes a rampant lion, the papal keys, and a tiara. The medal was produced in conjunction with the pope's announcement of peace in the Basilica of San Marco on April 25, 1468. Versions of the medal were most likely distributed to notable attendees of the event as well as sent to secular rulers of the peninsula. As with many of Cristoforo's works, this papal medal has components inspired by antiquity. There is evidence that the profile side of the medal resembles the denarius of Emperor Hadrian. The inscription assimilates Pope Paul II to Augustus stemming from the inherently imperial nature of the peace proclamation in 1468. One of the most prominent commissions that brought Cristoforo fame was the restoration of the equestrian statue of Marcus Aurelius in 1468. In 1469, he was commissioned to make medals for the restoration of the Palazzo Venezia. The pope strategically employed Cristoforo to use the antique concepts he was known for, but had him also cater to Pope Paul II's liking. Under the papacy, Cristoforo made a plethora of medals for Pope Paul II. Pope Paul II often buried medals in the foundations of buildings he was restoring. Many of these medals have since been recovered and attributed to Cristoforo di Geremia, despite the lack of a signature. === Signed works === There are two surviving medals signed by Cristoforo di Geremia. The first shows Constantine the Great on the front and a pseudo-classical group on the back. Although the intended meaning of the back is unknown, some attribute the representation to the Constantinian Peace of the Church. Others argue that the two figures and the inscription are the deliberate imitation of a Roman coin, the inspiration deriving from a sestertius of Plotina when Cristoforo was making his medal of Constantine. The two figures, the Emperor and the Church are clasping hands. The second signed medal from Cristoforo di Geremia shows Alfonso V of Aragon, King of Naples. It features Alfonso V's bust and was probably inspired by Pisanello's work on Alfonso V. The back of the medal shows Alfonso enthroned and crowned by Bellona and Mars. Cristoforo di Geremia was superseded by his nephew, the medallist Lysippus the Younger, who, along with other artists, borrowed figures and compositions from Cristoforo. == Works == {  !Work !Year !Work Type !Front !Back - Lodovico Trevisan 1461-1465 Bronze Medal 250px 250px - Pope Paul II  Bronze Medal 250px 250px - Constantine the Great 1468 Bronze Medal 250px 250px - Alfonso V of Aragon  Bronze Medal 250px n/a - Cardinal Guillaume d'Estouteville 1461-1481 Bronze Medal 250px 250px - Sacrifice to Priapus ca. 1470 Plaquette 250px 250px } == References == Category:1410 births Category:1476 deaths Category:Italian medallists Category:15th-century Italian sculptors Category:Italian male sculptors Category:People from Mantua ","title":"Cristoforo di Geremia"},{"id":"20156782","text":"Anna & Bella is a 1984 Dutch animated short film from the Netherlands.

While working for a publishing company, she signed a recording contract with RCA Records in 1963. She released several singles that did not become successful. In 1969, she signed with Decca Records. Her first charting single was 1971's \\"Hold to My Unchanging Love\\". This was followed by \\"Love Me\\", which became a top 40 hit and prompted the release of her debut studio album. In 1973, Pruett released the single \\"Satin Sheets\\", which became her biggest hit. The song spent several weeks at number one on the Billboard Hot Country Singles chart and crossed over to number 28 on the Hot 100. Its corresponding album of the same name also topped the Billboard Country Albums chart in July 1973. Pruett followed the song's success with \\"I'm Your Woman\\", which also became a top ten hit on the country songs chart. Her self-titled third studio album was released in June 1974 and peaked at number 19 on the country albums chart. The album also included the single, \\"You Don't Need to Move a Mountain\\", a top 20 hit on the country chart in 1974. Pruett issued her fourth studio album, Honey on His Hands, in 1975, which reached the top 50 of the country albums survey. It spawned four singles, three of which became top 30 hits on the country chart. Its highest charting hit was \\"Welcome to the Sunshine (Sweet Baby Jane)\\" (1974). Pruett recorded a series of singles that became minor hits during the rest of the 1970s. In 1977, she briefly moved to Mercury Records, where she had one top forty hit with \\"I'm Living a Lie\\".

She received her Master's degree in photography and the history of photography from the Royal College of Art, London, where she studied with Bill Brandt. She is known for experimental portrait photography, most notably her trilogy The Sleepers (2003), The Travelers (2005), and The Narcissists (2008), and her groundbreaking project The Bound (2016). Heyert is the author of numerous books of and about photography including The Glass-House Years (Allanheld and Schram, 1979), Metropolitan Places (Viking Studio Books, 1989), The Sleepers (Sei Swann, 2003), and The Travelers (Scalo Verlag, 2006), The Narcissists (Silvana Editoriale, 2008) and The Outsider (Damiani 2017). ==Career== After shooting around the world for publications such as The New York Times, New York Magazine, Vogue and British Vogue, Elle Decor, and Architectural Digest, and for clients including Ralph Lauren, Cartier, American Express, and Tiffany & Co. her successful career allowed her to close her commercial studio in 1999, to return to a more personal exploration of photography. She began The Sleepers with the idea of experimenting with unconventional forms of portrait photography. Within three years she was offered her first one-person show of these works, which opened at the Edwynn Houk gallery in New York, in January 2003. The Sleepers, a series of monumental toned black and white photographs of sleeping nudes, is a meditation on the mystical world of sleep and the emotional journey we travel in our unconscious state. Reviewing the exhibit The New Yorker wrote that the work: \\"conjures thoughts of human fragility and impermanence even if the sleepers have become heroic sculptures rising from a deep slumber.The New Yorker, February 3, 2003\\" Sei Swann published a monograph of The Sleepers, with an essay inspired by the works, written by the playwright John Guare, in January 2003. Heyert's obsession with sleep and the unconscious led her inevitably to photograph The Travelers, a series of large-scale color post- mortem portraits. The photographs stirred discussion and controversy when they were first exhibited in New York. The New York Times, in a feature article about the works, described these photographs as a \\"peek beneath the surface at the vibrant, living face beneath the mask of death.The New York Times, Bringing Back the Dead, Photographer Captures Undertakers Art, February 16, 2004, Alan Feuer\\" Scalo Verlag published her book, The Travelers, in March 2006. At the end of the year Photo-Eye Magazine named The Travelers one of the best photography books of 2006.Photo-Eye Magazine, Booklist, Best Books of 2006, April, 2007, Darius Himes The 30 x 40 inch photographs have been widely exhibited internationally: at the Mus√©e de l'√âlys√©e in Lausanne, Switzerland; at the Hayward Gallery in London; in Austria in New Art/New York: Reflections of the Human Condition; and in a solo museum show at the Malmo Museer in Sweden. In May 2007, 18 life size prints of The Travelers were exhibited on a small island in Naarden, The Netherlands, accessible only through an ancient stone tunnel, as part of an exhibition entitled In Memoriam. The works have also been the subject of television programs by ARD Kulturweltspiegel in Germany and by TVE Spain, a National Public Radio program, and feature articles in Sueddeutsche Zeitung, El Mundo, in the Swiss publications Le Temps and Femina, and Vrij Nederland among others. Heyert's work has been extensively reviewed and discussed in leading international publications such as The New York Times, the Times of London, Le Monde, and Stern and in contemporary publications such as The Drawbridge and Dazed and Confused. Her photographs are part of the permanent collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, the J. Paul Getty Museum, and the Beinecke Library of Rare Books, and Manuscripts at Yale as well as numerous private collections. Her most recent projects include The Bound (2016), which explores the body as a site for experimentation and transformation, and The Outsider (2017), a conceptual photography project shot in China. She is currently at work on The Idol, a new series that explores religion and popular culture, and the ways society creates myths and false images about women. ==ReferencesBooks== *The Glass-House Years (1979) *Metropolitan Places (1989) *The Sleepers (2003) *The Travelers (2006) *The Narcissists (2008) *The Outsider (2017) ==External links== *elizabethheyert.com * https://web.archive.org/web/20081206160841/http://www.houkgallery.com/heyert- travellers/heyert.html *Kind Assassin, Essay by John Guare, The Sleepers * Interview by Stacey D'Erasmo, The Sleepers *Interview by Stacey D'Erasmo, The Travelers *The New York Times, Bringing Back the Dead Category:1951 births Category:Living people Category:Alumni of the Royal College of Art Category:American photographers Category:American women photographers ","title":"Elizabeth Heyert"},{"id":"20156881","text":"Block diagram of feedback control of a dynamical process. Bode's sensitivity integral, discovered by Hendrik Wade Bode, is a formula that quantifies some of the limitations in feedback control of linear parameter invariant systems. Let L be the loop transfer function and S be the sensitivity function. In the diagram, P is a dynamical process that has a transfer function P(s). The controller, C, has the transfer function C(s). The controller attempts to cause the process output, y, to track the reference input, r. Disturbances, d, and measurement noise, n, may cause undesired deviations of the output. Loop gain is defined by L(s) = C(s)P(s). The following holds: :\\\\int_0^\\\\infty \\\\ln S(j \\\\omega) d \\\\omega = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty \\\\ln \\\\left \\\\frac{1}{1+L(j \\\\omega)} \\\\right d \\\\omega = \\\\pi \\\\sum Re(p_k) - \\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2} \\\\lim_{s\\\\rightarrow\\\\infty} s L(s) where p_k are the poles of L in the right half plane (unstable poles).

There are many subcategories of members checks, including; narrative accuracy checks, interpretive validity, descriptive validity, theoretical validity, and evaluative validity. In many member checks, the interpretation and report (or a portion of it) is given to members of the sample (informants) in order to check the authenticity of the work. Their comments serve as a check on the viability of the interpretation. Member checking can be done during the interview process, at the conclusion of the study, or both to increase the credibility and validity (statistics) of a qualitative study. The interviewer should strive to build rapport with the interviewee in order to obtain honest and open responses. During an interview, the researcher will restate or summarize information and then question the participant to determine accuracy. Member checks completed after a study are completed by sharing all of the findings with the participants involved. This allows participants to critically analyze the findings and comment on them. The participants either affirm that the summaries reflect their views, feelings, and experiences, or that they do not reflect these experiences. If the participants affirm the accuracy and completeness, then the study is said to have credibility. These member checks are not without fault, but serve to decrease the incidence of incorrect data and the incorrect interpretation of data. The overall goal of this process is to provide findings that are authentic, original and reliable. == Positive Aspects of Member-Checking == Member checking provides an opportunity to understand and determine what the author intended to do through their actions. It gives them the ability to correct errors and challenge what are perceived as wrong interpretations. Member checking provides the opportunity to volunteer additional information which may be stimulated by the playing back process. Gets respondent on the record with their reports. Provides people that respond the opportunity to assess adequacy of data and preliminary results as well as to confirm particular aspects of the data. The ability to summarize the preliminary findings. The major problem with member checking however is that it relies on the assumption that there is a fixed truth of reality that can be accounted for by a researcher and can be confirmed by a respondent, which may not be true. In fact, member checks are not consistent with the philosophy of non positivistic qualitative research methods. See positivism for more information on philosophy of approach. == Interviewing and Member Checking == There are two interview styles to promote discussion between interviewees and the interviewers during member checks. The first, Confrontation Style is only effective when there is a trusted, warm, and open relationship between the interviewer and the interviewee. This style promotes discussion empowering the interviewee to have confidence to \\"fight back\\" when his/her opinion is questioned. The second, Dialogue and Power, focuses on the inherent power struggle between the interviewer and the interviewee. Interviewers must be aware of this imbalance of power and promote discussion from the interviewee by valuing opinions and reinforcing equal collaboration between the two.Tanggaard, L. (2008). Objections in research interviewing. International Journal of Qualitative Methods, 7(3), p 15-29. In an informal sense, member checks are carried out verbally throughout the conduct of fieldwork. The researcher constantly checks his or her understanding of the phenomenon by utilizing techniques such as paraphrasing and summarization for clarification. It is best to ask permission to visit the participant again at the time of the unstructured interview. Interviews are used as a way for the respondent to express their emotions and thoughts about their experiences and allow the interviewer to have a better understanding of a situation. When the member check procedure is used in a sample of people who were not the original participants in the study, the procedure can be used to assess transferability. If the people who were not the original participants do not agree with the information, then the findings can be said to be biased or not transferable since transferability is the process of being able to apply the findings from one study to others in similar situations. A question to ask is whether the findings \\"ring true\\" in others' experiences.LoBiondo- Wood, G & Haber, J. \\"Nursing Research.\\" Mosby Elsevier (2006) It is critical to use member checking in qualitative research studies because these types of studies often involve interpretation.Byrne, M.M. (2001).Evaluating the findings of qualitative research. AORN Journal. Retrieved November 23, 2008 from http://findarticles.com/p/articles Thus, without allowing participants to validate the accuracy of their findings, one-sidedness will become a major concern. Since the most important issue in evaluating the rigor of qualitative research is trustworthiness, using the strategy of member checks, (along with other techniques such as independent audit, prolonged engagement, triangulation, peer debriefing), is critical to minimizing distortion.Rubin, A., Babbie, E.R. (2008).Research methods for social work. Belmont, CA:Thomson Brooks/Cole. Prolonged engagement aids in the ability to detect and account for distortions that might be in the data. It also helps to become oriented to the situation so content is appreciated and the researcher builds trust.http://www.qualres.org/Home-Prol 3690.html. In general, member checks are a useful function in research, especially when there are questions about the adequacy of understanding based on limited time of exposure. Thus, a member check can serve to counterbalance concerns about whether engagement was sufficiently prolonged == Pertinent Questions == Before you begin \\"member checking,\\" consider and answer each of the following questions: *What is being checked? If it is simply a check that participants have the demographic characteristics you recorded for them, or recall a discussion as you do, the task may be simple, but this is hardly validating your interpretation. Most commonly what is being \\"checked\\" is how you have \\"seen\\" the situation. What account of this interpretation are you to give out for rechecking? *With whom are you checking? Who are the relevant \\"members\\" and what is their relation to you and to your research topic? *Who is checking whom? It is never appropriate to think in terms of an \\"us and them\\" dichotomy, in which you are doing research on \\"them.\\" *How would you interpret agreement? This is a crucial question. If the participants agree with your analysis, given that they are probably not researchers, this would be surprising. (It may be a matter for concern. One of the goals that can be set for a good project is that it showed something the participants could not see.) *What follows if \\"they\\" agree? This is a major ethical issue. If a participant agrees to your account and even to its publication, this does not clear you of the responsibility of considering the implications of publishing. Perhaps they are unable to see future fallout from your report? Perhaps those consulted have an interest in your publishing a critique of others? *How does one interpret disagreement? There are of course two different situations to consider: everyone disagrees with you, or (a different issue) there is disagreement between members on your interpretation. By now it should be clear that respondent checking does not establish truth of your report. Think before you start the feedback processes, all the different reasons why disagreements might appear. It is very likely that if you have made a good job of your research, the report exposes or even hurts some participants. You may have probed motives and interests, revealed the ways high intentions disguise messy politics or fear. Perhaps your task included confronting the participants with this analysis, but do you expect them to agree and if they did, what would that tell you? *What was it they responded to? How partial was the interpretation? == Advantages and Disadvantages of Member Checks  Advantages === The greatest advantage in a member check is that the researcher can verify the entirety and completeness of the findings, which is a measurable tool of the accuracy of the findings. Other Advantages:Cohen D, Crabtree B. \\"Qualitative Research Guidelines Project.\\" July 2006. http://www.qualres.org/HomeMemb-3696.html *Provides an opportunity to understand and assess what the participant intended to do through his or her actions *Gives participants opportunity to correct errors and challenge what are perceived as wrong interpretations *Provides the opportunity to volunteer additional information which may be stimulated by the playing back process *Gets respondent on the record with his or her reports *Provides an opportunity to summarize preliminary findings *Member checks can be useful in action research projects, where researchers work with participants on a continuing basis to help with change. *It lessens the risk of participants reporting at a later date that the researcher misunderstood their contributions or claiming investigative error. *Enables an assessment of what the participant intended by making exact comments or taking specific actions *Shows high credibility and face validity *Prevent personal biases from being included within the quantitative research study. *Prevent false information from being presented as reliable research. === Disadvantages === There are multiple disadvantages related to member checks that may occur throughout the process. *Research findings cannot be easily conveyed to the participant. This is most commonly the case in addiction and criminal research. Additionally, findings may be difficult to understand. *Member check exercises can make extensive demands on the participants' time. *Sometimes the content of transcripts and the research topic can be exploitative and/or distressing. *Research participants may refuse to participate in member check, especially if an extended period of time has elapsed since research study. *Participants may tell the researcher what they believe the researcher wants to hear. *Member checking relies on the assumption that there is a fixed truth of reality that can be accounted for by a researcher and confirmed by a respondent. *Members may relay accounts during an interview that they later regret or see differently. Members may deny such stories and want them removed from the data *Members may not be in the best position to check the data. They may forget what they said or the manner in which a story was told *Different members may have different views of the same data. *It requires skills and experience from the researcher and can be expensive and time consuming. *Member checks (respondent validation) are part of a process of error reduction, which also generates further original data, which, in turn, require interpretation, rather than as a straightforward check on validity.Pope, C., & Mays, N. (2006). Qualitative Research in Health Care. Malden, MA: Wiley- Blackwell. *The very subjectivity of the inquiry leads to difficulties in establishing the reliability and validity of the approaches and information. *Its scope is limited due to the in-depth, comprehensive data gathering approaches required.Key, James Research Design in Occupational Education Module r14 Qualitative Research http://www.okstate.edu/ag/agedcm4h/academic/aged5980a/5980/newpage21.htm == Objections to Member Checks == Many writers establish internal validity ‚Äì truthfulness and representation of the reality of the participants ‚Äì by showing that they have carried out a ‚Äòmember check‚Äô as Lincoln and Guba (1985) suggest. However, some researchers disagree with the use of a member check. Many researchers have noted that when the essence of the participants' experiences are similar, their stories represent social reality. Accordingly, phenomenology (science) is defined as a philosophy or method of inquiry based on the premise that reality consists of objects and events as they are perceived or understood in human consciousness and not of anything independent of human consciousness. In qualitative research, phenomenological methods are used to learn and construct the meaning of the human experience through intensive dialogue with persons who are living the experience. The researcher's goal is to explain the meaning of the experience to the participant. This is achieved through a dialogic process, which is more than a simple interview.Evidence-Based Nursing#Methodology Therefore, in their opinion, a member check can adversely transform the data through the process of analysis and writing. Phenomenologists believe each individual has his/her own unique perspective, inhabits a social world, and recognizes others‚Äô reality to some extent. They believe that for an account to have validity, its readers will have grasped not only the essence of the phenomenon but also understood something of the human condition they have in common with the participants-‚Äìintersubjective understanding.Holloway, I. \\"Qualitative Research in Healthcare.\\" McGraw-Hill (2005) == Member Check Considerations == Member checks by research participants are increasingly recommended in qualitative research. There are differences, however, in qualitative research that suggests member checks may need to be approached with caution.Reference World.com Although member checking has been used for verification of the results, it is not always a true verification strategy. Many methodologists caution against using member check as verification by defining what participants say to be correct because it may actually pose a threat to the validity instead. This is due to results of studies being combined, made neutral, and abstracted from other participants as well as investigators wanting to be more responsive to their participants and restrain some of their results. Ultimately this causes the researcher's study to be invalid.Morse, J.M., Barrett, M., Mayan, M., Olson, K., and Spiers, J. (2002).Verification Strategies for Establishing Reliability and Validity in Qualitative Research. International Journal of Qualitative Methods 1, (2).

Many consider member checking to be the best method of establishing credibility, but one of the main drawbacks is the way in which the researcher views the research as being intended to generalize the findings. This may clash with the participant‚Äôs view that their account is specific and solely their experience. Due to the different views regarding interpretation of data, member checks may be better suited as being identified as a tool for error reduction, rather than a verification protocol.Mays, N., Pope, C. (2000). Assessing quality in qualitative research. British Medical Journal, 320, 50-52. Member checks can be used as a technique to evaluate the problems with the study process such as practical, theoretical, representational, and moral flaws to ensure the honesty of the research procedures.Sandelowski, Margarete PhD, RN, FAAN. December 1993. \\"Methods of Inquiry.\\" Advances in Nursing Science 16(2):1-8. Retrieved November 30, 2008. http://www.advancesinnursingscience.com/pt/re/ans/abstract. The process of a member check also is important in revealing missing information that should be addressed before concluding the study. This is a step of reevaluation within a study that allows for researchers to implement changes and conduct further interviews in areas where a study is weak. However, the responses received from participants may not always be accurate and should be carefully reviewed by researchers. It is important for researchers to review responses in order to avoid altering sound data. Participants in a study may have knowledge of incomplete or incorrect information that leads to misinformed responses. Likewise, they may also respond falsely in order to avoid social judgment or societal views on the subject, despite anonymity. Participants‚Äô responses may also stem from myth- based knowledge or delusional thinking (Douglas, 1976). When hypotheses are formed, researchers often have predictions on the outcome; therefore, it is vital that researchers avoid their own biases to data. Avoidance of bias can be aided by having separate researchers review the member check responses rather than by those who conducted the interviews. There are no clear-cut means of clearly avoiding incorrect participant feedback or researcher bias from tainting gathered research. However, if researchers can minimize these factors they can strengthen the external validity of their research.Lincoln, Y. S., Guba, E. G., & Guba, E. (1985). Naturalistic inquiry: The paradigm revolution. London: SAGE. Although member checks are considered very beneficial to credibility of the study, there is not a lot of information or understanding on how member checks should be performed. In recent studies, two methods have been identified. The first is to send the transcripts or summaries are sent to the original participants to be confirmed. The second uses a member check group session with each group member being shown a summary of the analysis. Regardless of the method used to peer review or member check research it must be done to ensure quality research and improve upon the research being performed before it is submitted for publication and considered as a reliable study. == Notes  References == *Arminio, J., Jones, S., Torres, V.

Gittinger. The system has been used by scientists in studying personality and by clinicians in clinical practice. A major feature of the PAS is that a personality profile can be systematically interpreted from a set of Wechsler Scales subtest scores.Krauskopf and Saunders, 1994, p1-10. The PAS has two aspects which distinguish it from other personality models. They are the use of the Wechsler subtests, an objective test, to determine a personality and the use of a developmental model in which the description of personality includes development through adolescence. Krauskopf has proposed that differential aptitudes are the \\"cause\\" of personality differences. Krauskopf, 1998 The reason is that people prefer to use aptitudes they feel they are better at than ones where they feel weaker. Krauskopf calls this hypothesis \\"radical\\" because so little attention has been paid to the idea. With this \\"radical hypothesis\\", the use of an intelligence test, the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale to obtain personality information makes sense. ==Description== This very brief description is based primarily on the most recently published description of the PAS Krauskopf and Saunders, 1994, Chapter 3 although there is no disagreement with other descriptions.Gittinger, 1992, 1973a, 1973bMarks, 1979, Chapter 11 The PAS is based on premises (among others) that behavior is determined by both heredity and environment and behavior is determined by an interacting system of traits. Furthermore, these traits can be modified through learning to such an extent that some might be nearly opposite to the original genetic direction. Gittinger's original formulation defines three primitive dimensions to which must be added general ability level which is referred to in the PAS as Normal Level. There is an additional dimension related to psychological energy. In the theory, gender and age also affect the final personality description. The first dimension is Internalizer-Externalizer which is an ability to manipulate internal stimuli or symbols without being distracted by the external world. This is similar, but not identical, to the familiar introversion-extroversion dimension. The internalizer relies more on his own experience and internal landscape and is likely to be less active than externalizers. The externalizer is dependent on input from the outside and is more dependent on relating for the sake of relating. Gittinger called this the intellectual dimension. The Regulated-Flexible dimension can be viewed by thinking of a regulated person as one who can see details within a whole, but not the whole. The regulated person is more stimulus bound and less able to see the \\"big picture\\". The regulated person is more procedurally oriented and emotionally insulated. The flexible person is involved with relationships and has attention diverted from step by step procedures. In theory, the regulated person has a high sensory threshold which is therefore satisfied less often than a flexible person. Gittinger called this the procedural dimension. The Role Adaptable-Role Uniform dimension refers to a person's skill in meeting demands that others make of him. It is thus a social dimension. The behavior related to this dimension is generally without awareness. The adaptable person easily plays a variety of roles, being charming and moving easily in many different situations always making good first impressions. The role uniform person is able to handle only a few social roles at best and is often said to be socially inept. The behavior is most apparent in new social situations, since the role uniform may comfortable and accepted in a very familiar situation. The role adaptive can suffer from making good first impressions and then not understanding the unrealistic expectations others place upon him. Gittinger called this the social dimension. A compensation (or lack thereof) is learned behavior a person adopts in childhood to go against their natural dimensions. This is done to gain better coping skills which their natural dimensions do not be initially provide. Once developed, compensation tends to be strongly ingrained and resistant to external pressure. Finally, modification (or lack thereof) , much like compensation, is a learned behavior to counter the individual's initial dimensions but it is developed in adulthood and is much more fragile and resistant to pressure. This behavior is learned to cope with adult responsibilities. As the environment places demands upon a person to learn to compensate for weaknesses, the person may compensate to such an extent as to actually appear to have the opposite primitive trait. For example, a primitive externalizer may compensate and appear more as an internalizer. However, there are differences between an uncompensated primitive externalizer and a compensated internalizer. The compensated adjustment is a more tense adjustment and requires more rehearsal and more display of consistency. Also, a person who is compensated often reacts negatively to seeing their primitive trait displayed in others. A person may compensate in none, one, two or all three dimensions. The PAS calls the adjustment including compensation the basic level. The PAS defines an additional level of adjustment called the contact or surface level. At the surface level, there are four possible adjustments. A person who is not compensated may either become modified, that is, attempt to display the opposite of their primitive trait on the surface or they may remain completely uncompensated and unmodified, retaining their primitive trait. A person who is compensated at the basic level may revert towards their primitive trait on the surface (this is called a controlled adjustment) or continue to move towards the opposite (this is called a repressed adjustment). A person makes adjustments in all three dimensions independently. For example, a person might have a modified adjustment in one dimension, a controlled adjustment in another, and a repressed adjustment in the third. === Subtest scales === Externalizer-Internalizer Dimension { class=\\" mw-collapsible autocollapse\\"; style=\\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border: none;\\" - !rowspan=1Dimmensioncolspan=1Compensationcolspan=1Modificationcolspan=1Description - E Low Low Primitive E - E Low High Suppressed E - E High Low Controlled E - E High High Repressed E - I Low Low Primitive I - I Low High Suppressed I - I High Low Controlled I - I High High Repressed I - } Regulated-Flexible Dimmension { class=\\" mw-collapsible autocollapse\\"; style=\\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border: none;\\" - !rowspan=1Dimmensioncolspan=1Compensationcolspan=1Modificationcolspan=1Description - F Low Low Controlled F - F Low High Repressed F - F High Low Exploited F - F High High Modified F - R Low Low Modified R - R Low High Exploited R - R High Low Repressed R - R High High Controlled R - } Unacceptable-Acceptable Dimmension { class=\\" mw-collapsible autocollapse\\"; style=\\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border: none;\\" - !rowspan=1Dimmensioncolspan=1Compensationcolspan=1Modificationcolspan=1Description - U Low Low Primitive U - U Low High Suppressed U - U High Low Controlled U - U High High Repressed U - A Low Low Controlled A - A Low High Repressed A - A High Low Suppressed A - A High High Exploited A - } A key feature of the PAS is that the profile of a particular person may be derived from their scores on the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale. The development of the PAS actually began when John Gittinger noticed certain behaviors which seemed to relate to subtest scores on the Wechsler. Over the years, as he observed many people, he developed the full theory and the method of translating Wechsler scores into PAS profiles. Many refinements in the method used to produce PAS profiles from Wechsler scores were made with the 2001 method and one much older method the most extensively used by psychologists using the PAS. ==Applications== The PAS has been used for many applications over the years. A sample of applications include education, career analysis, self-help, and intelligence gathering. DuVivier DuVivier, 1992 discusses the importance of working with individual differences when analyzing college student success and drop-out rates with particular attention to avoiding drop-out. She uses an \\"Impressionistic Model Analysis\\" based on the PAS. Downs Downs, 1973 studied college students majoring in mathematics and mathematics education. In the study, most students in both groups were primitive regulated, in fact, compensated regulated. Pure mathematics majors tended to be primitive and basic role uniform whereas mathematics education majors tended to be primitive role adaptive. Meyers Meyers, 1973 studied several police forces and discovered that police tended to be either primitive role adaptive or compensated role uniform people. Wilton Wilton, 2006, p iv and Appendix describes an entire toolbox of building life skills, everything from child training to dealing with obnoxious people to building security. She bases her work on her understanding of individual differences which she credits foremost to John Gittinger and the PAS. DeForest DeForest, 1991 describes the use of the PAS in two aspects of intelligence gathering in Vietnam. One use was to develop interrogation methods appropriate to the personality type of the subject. According to the DeForest's report of the work, Vietnamese were very similar to each other, especially at the primitive level, and this led to develop of a consistent method of interrogation. The PAS was also used to identify personalities that were likely to remain loyal, as opposed to ones who would flip-flop according to who they were dealing with at the moment. This was used to select subjects from among captives or deserters to return to enemy locations to gather intelligence. ==CIA connection== John Gittinger, the developer of the PAS, worked as a psychologist for the Central Intelligence Agency during the time he developed the PAS. Early publications describing the PAS appeared in academic publications and did not mention Gittinger's employer. Gittinger, 1973a, 1973b While the PAS has been used in many contexts such as education and clinical work, it was developed by John Gittinger who worked with a number of other CIA employees. Gittinger and his PAS work were related to a wide range of projects, some of which were part of the set of projects known as Project MKUltra. Gittinger was a witness and identified as a CIA psychologist at Senate hearings into Project MKUltra. The transcripts of the select committee on intelligence and the subcommittee on health and scientific research of the committee of human resources for the ninety-fifth congress first session, August 3, 1977, hearings are available online. For example, see Rutgers law library site accessed June 19, 2008 or this better formatted version accessed June 19, 2008. The testimony in these transcripts does not mention the PAS, but do include testimony of Gittinger. The relationship of Gittinger, the PAS and MKULTRA is discussed by Marks in chapter 11 of his book based upon examination of thousands of documents.Marks, 1979, Chapter 11 Earlier articles on the PAS in professional and academic journals never mentioned John Gittinger's employer. While Marks' book is critical of the CIA and the MKULTRA project, Marks reports of Gittinger's passion for his personality system and describes it quite thoroughly. Marks also reports that Gittinger was very concerned that Marks' 1974 article connecting Gittinger, the PAS, and the CIA would damage Gittinger's professional career. Marks also reports that Gittinger was \\"humiliated\\" by the 1973 hearings saying Gittinger was interested in talking about his personality system, not the drug and sex scandals being pursued by the Senate committee. Note that Gittinger retired from government service in 1978. The use of the PAS by a CIA psychologist in the field is described in DeForest's book.DeForest, 1992 The book describes the work of a psychologist, Bill Todd (a pseudonym) in Vietnam. Treverton says that this book \\"is one for intelligence fans, not an assessment but a lively tale of a spymaster and his agents-\\" Treverton, 1990 Manning's review in the New York Times says, \\"Orrin DeForest, the principal author of the book, certainly comes across as a disaffected C.I.A. person, and its contents are certainly self-serving. Whether the book is also misleading is difficult for someone outside the spook fraternity of hired dissemblers to ascertain. Nevertheless, Slow Burn has its virtues anyway.\\"Manning, 1990 ==Literature== The PAS was developed primarily during the 1950s and 1960s with continued refinement since then. Due to the uniqueness of the developer, John W. Gittinger, and the nature of John Gittinger's career, the literature is somewhat unusual in two ways. First, while there are many journal articles published about the PAS and research using the PAS, only a small number are authored or co-authored by John Gittinger. Second, much research has been conducted which has not been published. Krauskopf and Suanders' book Krauskopf and Saunders, 1994 has the most thorough discussion of the theory of the PAS, how it relates to other theories in psychology, and of research concerning the PAS. This book has a very extensive bibliography of both research on the PAS itself and works using the PAS. Gittinger's major work, a 1964 work called the _PAS Atlas_ contains the most complete description of the wide range of possible personality profiles. The _PAS Atlas_ was never formally published by Gittinger. A revised version, which improved readability and usability, was published in 1992. Gittinger, 1992 Gittinger did publish two shorter descriptions of the PAS in academic journals with coauthor J. F. Winne in 1973. Winne and Gittinger, 1973a Winne and Gittinger, 1973b An extensive summary of the relationship of the Wechsler and the PAS is available from Matarazzo in chapter 14 (Personality and Related Correlates of the Wechsler Scales) of the standard reference on the Wechsler. Mattarazzo, 1972 ==The PAS and MBTI== Krauskopf and Saunders discuss how the PAS relates to other differential concepts. Krauskopf and Saunders, 1994, Chapter V Due to personal interactions at conferences, perhaps the relationship of the MBTI Myers-Briggs Type Indicator to the PAS has received more discussion and thought than other comparisons. The two systems have relationships but an individual's profile in one system is not readily derived from the profile of the other. Krauskopf and Saunders, 1994, Pages 66, 69, 127. Research and conference discussions suggest that conscious choices as defined by preferences made on the MBTI questionnaire define an individual's MBTI profile. Similarity, choices in one's life-style define a person's PAS third or surface dimension. In the PAS terms, the face one shows to the world is the result of an individual's conscious and unconscious screening process. Like the MBTI profile, the PAS surface dimension reflects who a person is or how he/she wants to be seen. The MBTI and PAS diverge on the source of what goes into one's public persona. The first two dimensions of the PAS represent measurable, developmental interactions of Nature and Nurture at play in forming one's \\"basic\\" or core personality. Based on motivations emanating from the basic personality, the surface persona is the result of an individual's largely, but not entirely, conscious choices to maximize strengths and to minimize weaknesses. Once the individual's basic or core personality is formed, it is immutable. In contrast, the surface dimension is subject to subtle transformations through life experiences such as education, therapy, illness, trauma, and/or aging. So, while both the MBTI and the third dimension of PAS result from conscious choices about the identity a person wishes to project, these respective models vary as to the sources governing the decisions going into the choice of one's public persona. ==FootnotesReferences== * *Downs, R.R.

After the 1968 Games, Fox, then a sergeant in the REME, announced his retirement but he was dissuaded by his coach, Ron Bright, and remained in the sport for another eight years. During that period he set a fine example to the tyros of the sport and following his final individual effort at the 1972 Olympics he won a team gold medal in Modern Pentathlon at the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, with Danny Nightingale and Adrian Parker.

He now runs a construction business in London. In 2011, Spence was jailed for 13 weeks for his part in a fraud scam involving a chain of car washes.http://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/news/criminal-network-is-brought-to- justice-after-six-years-of-fraud-1-4028973 ==Early career== He first started in Hill climb events and moved into single seater racing in 1981 when he entered Formula Three. After a single Formula Three race, in the 1981 British Grand Prix support race, finishing 27th, Spence dropped back to the junior ranks for the next season. In 1982, he was champion in the Donington Park Formula Ford 1600. His good form continued in 1983, winning the EFDA Townsend Thorsen European Formula Ford 2000 Championship. During 1983, he returned to Formula Three with Eddie Jordan Racing for a one-off outing in the European Championship. ==Formula Three== Come 1984, Spence had signed for Mint Engineering ‚Äì Warmastyle Racing, for his first full season off British Formula Three, in their Ralt-Volkswagen RT3/84. By only the fourth round, his experience of racing in Europe paid dividends, by winning the Grote Prijs van Zolder, at Zolder. In a season dominated by Johnny Dumfries, Spence scored two more wins, with back-to-back races at Donington Park and Oulton Park. Although he was Dumfries closest rival for the title, Spence was pipped third place by Allen Berg. Spence stayed in British Formula Three, in 1985 for another crack at the title with PMC Motorsport, abroad a Reynard-Volkswagen 853. He had a brilliant start to the season, winning four of the first six races, two at Thruxton, one at Silverstone as well as retaining the Grote Prijs van Zolder. By the mid-season break he led the standing by five points from Andy Wallace. However, the Reynard's early season advantage had vanished, as the Ralt RT30 came on strong, winning all the remaining rounds. During this period, his team, PMC Motorsport folded, leaving him to quickly build another team, now using a Ralt RT30. Despite this, he was only two points adrift of the championship lead going into the final two rounds. With a DNF in at Zandvoort, and an 11th place at Silverstone, this saw Spence drop to third in the end-of- year standings. ==Formula 3000== He got a drive in the second year of the International Formula 3000 Series in 1986. This was very much thought of as the proving ground for drivers who wished to get a drive in Formula One, after replacing Formula Two. Driving for Eddie Jordan Racing part way of the season before switching to Onyx Racing, his first season was an unsuccessful one, with a best place finish of sixth at the Birmingham Superprix. In 1987, he drove for Murray Taylor Racing. After a poor start, he had a strong finish to the year, with two podiums in the final two races. A second place at Le Mans followed by a third place finish at Jarama, saw him finish the season in tenth place. 1988 was a terrible season for him. He drove for three different teams through the year, Team Ralt, Madgwick Motorsport and Onyx Racing, in three different cars. Despite entering all the rounds he only finished one race, with an eleventh place at Le Mans, he finished the season with no points. At the end of 1988, he retired from racing. ===Birmingham Superprix Protest=== He is most famous in the Formula 3000 championship for an incident that took place during the 1988 Birmingham Superprix. During the first lap, German driver Volker Weidler spun his car, blocking the circuit and causing a traffic jam of other cars behind him. With the front of the field driving away, Spence was furious that the race was not being red flagged. When the marshalls tried to push his car round, he kept his foot on the brake pedal in protest. With the car unable to be pushed and Spence not getting out, a track side crane was used to hoist his car off the track. The crane lifted the car up in the air with him still inside, waving his arms around for the marshalls to put him back down. ==Stateside== Spence made his racing comeback in 1992, in the SCCA Toyota Atlantic Championship. Abroad a Reynard-Toyota 92H, sponsored by Virgin Airways, Spence won his first two races in the United States; at Miami and Phoenix. Adding a further victory at Watkins Glen in the sixth round, helped Spence to finish fourth in the final standing, earning him a total of US$43,625. As this series supporting the Champ Cars, this should have assisted Spence upwards, however 1993 brought just two drives in Toyota Atlantics, not starting one nor finishing the other. 1984 was no better. In two outings for Euromotorsport, Spence at least finished; 4th place in the Monterey Sports Car Grand Prix, at Laguna Seca and 14th in an IMSA Supercar race in Phoenix. ==BTCC== After five-year break, Spence returned to racing as an independent in the 1999 British Touring Car Championship in an ex-works Renault Laguna for Arena International. His time in the BTCC did not go well. The first part of the season was full of incidents, ending at the fifth meeting of the season at Oulton Park when he crashed the car over the catch fence at Lodge corner. After this, he was replaced in the team by 1991 champion Will Hoy. He ended the season eighteenth with three points. ==Racing recordCareer highlights=== {  style=\\"font-size: 95%;\\" - ! Season !

Oshaka School in Kamakuland is a world-renowned school where only those who are pure and clearheaded descendants of Priest Sanzo's clan may be admitted. The trio of villains firmly believe they are genuine descendants of Priest Sanzo's clan, although they are of uncertain lineage. They study hard to enter the school in spite of their repeated failure. One day, three intelligent children are called in by the principal and asked to find a set of missing copper plates scattered all over the world. The plates are to be used to complete a puzzle board, which will bring honor to the Oshaka School. The conversation is overheard by the trio of villain, and they decide to stop the youngsters. The story is aimed at a more adult audience, with the female villain often losing her clothes during the story. Generally, the story parodies previous series, spoofing various recurring themes and set pieces, such as giant robots, good vs. evil, being a villain, transforming/upgrading existing machines to become much stronger, authorities, and the social life of working adults. The show was cancelled after twenty episodes because of very low audience rate.

With European settlement in the 19th century large areas were cleared for pastoral farming and for logging. The export wood chip industry was as the main cause of forest clearance on private land after 1970 and by the 1980s 95% of forest loss was due to wood chipping. The native forest were replanted with plantations of fast growing species such as Pinus radiata. After protests from environmentalists the exporting of wood chips from indigenous forests was stopped by the government in 1996. ==See also== *Forestry in New Zealand ==References *Quarterly Wood Chip Statistics at the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry *The Forestry Mulching Pros Category:Environmental issues in New Zealand Category:Forestry in New Zealand Category:Environmental issues with forests ","title":"Woodchipping in New Zealand"},{"id":"20157084","text":"Park Hotel may refer to: ==Hotels China === * Park Hotel Shanghai, the tallest building in Asia until 1952 === India === * The Park Hotels, chain of Hotels === Norway === * Scandic Park Hotel, chain hotel in Sandefjord, Norway ===Singapore=== * Park Hotel Group, chain of hotels ===United Kingdom=== * Park Hotel, Preston === United States === *Park Hotel (Hot Springs, Arkansas), listed on the NRHP in Arkansas *Park Hotel (Seguin, Texas), listed on the NRHP in Texas *Park Hotel (Salt Lake City, Utah), listed on the NRHP in Utah *Park Hotel and Cabins, listed on the National Register of Historic Places in Marquette County, Michigan *Astor House, New York, New York, a hotel previously known as the Park Hotel that was demolished in early 20th century ==Other== * Park Hotel (album), a 1986 album by Italian singer-songwriter Alice * Park Hotels & Resorts, a real estate investment trust == See also == * The Park (disambiguation) * Park Plaza Hotels & Resorts, a hotel chain once owned by Park Hotels International, LLC ","title":"Park Hotel"},{"id":"20157100","text":"V√°clav Anto≈° (19 January 1905 - 23 January 1978) was a Czech freestyle swimmer who competed for Czechoslovakia in the 1924 Summer Olympics and in the 1928 Summer Olympics.

Hood, Texas Ron Rocco is an American artist who has worked in New York City, Rotterdam in the Netherlands, Berlin, Germany and China. His work entails performance, mixed media installations and sculptural constructions employing a mix of found objects and prepared elements. Fields of interest: Installation art, Photography, Printmaking, Sculpture, 3D Design, Performance, Video sculpture, Video Art ==Early life and education== As a child Ron Rocco traveled with his parents to Germany, where his father served as an American soldier in the post-war occupation army. The artist attributed his early experience with German culture as a defining element in the background to his interest in Europe and his sometimes social and political themes. In the late 1950s and '60s Rocco grew up in the Bronx in New York City. His was an ethnically Italian neighborhood, surrounding Arthur Avenue, known as the Little Italy of the Bronx. The neighborhood scrap metal yards, inspired an early interest in working with metals, and a sense of the latent potential of found materials to evoke memory and associations. Rocco went on to study the visual arts at Purchase College, State University of New York, with classmates Jon Kessler and Fred Wilson, studying with sculptor Tal Streeter, photographer and musician John Cohen and printmaker Antonio Frasconi. Later he began graduate study at the Center for Advanced Visual Studies at M.I.T. under the instruction of the German Group Zero artist, Otto Piene, filmmaker Ricky Leacock, and anthropologist Heather Lechtman. Here Mr. Rocco began projects, which would result in his Guggenheim, New York performance entitled Zaroff‚Äôs Tale. ==Early career== Rocco's earliest work in sculpture grew out of an interest in the tension generated forms, made famous by the American artist, Kenneth Snelson and German architect, Frei Otto. Mr. Rocco‚Äôs work was based on arced segments of aluminum or wood, in constructions which displayed a balance between tensile and compression forces, subject to the effects of gravity. His exploration of these structures appeared in the exhibition, Models for Large Sculpture, presented at the Arnot Art Museum in Elmira, New York and later in a solo exhibition at Toronto's Galerie Danielli. While residing in Ithaca, New York Rocco's work through a public commission from Festival Ithaca and the National Endowment for the Arts in 1977, resulted in Altair, a matrix of arc segments and stainless steel cable, occupying an area of , suspended five stories above the city center. Meketra a second large scale commission from this period was exhibited at Cornell University‚Äôs Herbert F. Johnson Museum of Art. Altair installation by Ron Rocco, 1977 Plastic tubing, aluminum, stainless steel cable. In the period of 1979-80, Mr. Rocco returned to New York City and it was during this time that he met and was influenced by the work of German artist, Joseph Beuys who was producing his solo exhibition at the Guggenheim Museum at the time. As a result of this new influence later work in tension sculptures began to encompass performance activities, employed string figures taken from Inuit and Oceanic sources; forms, which in their traditional context possessed a social facet, in the communication of communal beliefs and ritual. Mr. Rocco used these as mechanisms for presentation to his audience in performance works like Zaroff's Tale Guggenheim Museum, New York), A String form for Binding Nations United Nations, New York) and Laser Sculpture Dance Herbert F. Johnson Museum of Art in Ithaca, N.Y.. ==Work in performance and electronic media== Building on earlier work at M.I.T.'s Visual Language Workshop and Owego, New York‚Äôs Experimental Television Center, Rocco authored computer software to produce an early image processing system for video. His works \\"Plotzensee\\" (2000) and \\"Berlin Diaries\\" (2000) can be found in the Experimental Television Center Repository, in the Rose Goldsen Archive of New Media Art. This resulted in his 1985 collaboration with dance choreographer Mel Wong and The Mel Wong Dance Company. Together they presented, Buddha Meets Einstein at the Great Wall during an American tour and at New York's Asia Society. This presentation used dance in combination with pre-recorded and real-time computer/video image processing to explore varying perceptions of time from both an American and Asian viewpoint. It was a performance that New York Times dance critic, Jennifer Dunning called one of the most successful integration of video imagery and modern dance. At the time, Mr. Rocco clarified, \\"The formal concerns of movement in dance could accentuate the effects of my equipment on the flow of time, providing a suitable format for the beauty and complexity of this subtle video processor\\". This performance was funded by a 1984 Inter-Arts Grant from The National Endowment for the Arts and the Sony Corporation, and may well have been the first live, on-stage application of computer generated imagery for dance. Other media projects in-residence at Canada‚Äôs Banff Center in Alberta, involved musician David Hykes, of The Harmonic Choir. Together they developed a computer assisted laser/video work, which generated kinetic cycles of visual phenomena from Mr. Hykes‚Äôs music. One such installation, provided real-time, graphic representation of sound, employing a laser scanner and a digitally processed, video feedback loop to create images that were abstract and strikingly calligraphic. This appeared in the work, In Light of Sound, one of Mr. Rocco‚Äôs Andro-Media Series installations, at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York City. The New York State Council on the Arts funded event in collaboration Mr. Hykes and his Harmonic Choir used the two-thousand-year-old tradition of Mongolian overtone chanting, practiced by these musicians, to control the visual phenomena created by the system of scanning lasers, video displays and computer processor. Working in the later '90s, Mr. Rocco explored the potential of web based projects in works like Rabinal Achi/Zapatista Port Action of 1997, a collaboration with Ricardo Dominguez, for the M.I.T /List Center Gallery's exhibition PORT/Navigating Digital Culture, and Communicating Vessels with Dutch artist Arnold Schalks. Rabinal Achi/Zapatista Port Action, was a fusion of drama and social commentary into a work spanning eight hundred years of Mayan History. Eight broadcast events were produced (via Pseudo Media in New York), bringing together news clips, interviews and discussion groups from Chiapas, Mexico, and the U.S. along with Mayan theater, for the List Gallery exhibition and the Internet. Rabinal Achi/Zapatista Port Action was a composite work, and used a VRML bridge, to join live audio and video streams, chat groups and an enactment of the Rabinal-Achi, a classic Mayan theater work of highland Guatemala. Communicating Vessels, was presented as a maritime contribution to the Snug Harbor Cultural Center's program in 1998. As a site specific and web based project located at the St. George terminal of the Staten Island Ferry, this project joined maritime subjects, navigation technology and historical documents to explored the relationship of Snug Harbor Cultural Center's past, as a home for retired seamen, to the present refuge for aged sailors in Sea Level, North Carolina. Through interviews with the residents of the North Carolina facility, Communicating Vessels presented the Atlantic Ocean as the connective element between the two locations via the Internet, using an information kiosk at the St. George site to present the web site, track ferry navigation via software provided by MapTech corporation, and to distribute newspapers and other publications. Communicating Vessels, was funded by the Netherlands Consul to North America and CBK Centrum Bildende Kunst, Rotterdam. ==Sculpture and European projects== Resident in New York 1979-1989 on the Lower East Side and later in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, Rocco‚Äôs sculptural work focused on New York Real Estate as a defining force in the life experiences of artists. A Poet Dies on 12th Street, 1982 Posted mail, vinyl, wood, audio electronics and fluorescent light. Eviction Plan, 1990 Valise, glass, legal paperwork, red neon and rubber stamp. Works like A Poet Dies on 12th Street and Eviction Plan stem from his experiences as a tenant organizer at this time, and document cases of murder and arson as side- products of these economic forces. Focusing on the balance between the natural and man-made world, Mr. Rocco‚Äôs 1989, Waterline Project in Amsterdam, Netherlands was created for the Dutch foundation ArtGarden. The project consisted of three outdoor sculptures in a park-like environment, and commented on the Dutch accomplishment of redefining natural boundaries between earth and sea. The project was produced with the joint support of The Netherlands-America Foundation, Art Matters, The New York Foundation for the Arts and The Foundation for Contemporary Performance Arts, Martin Air Holland, Regency Art Transfer of New York and the generous assistance of the Dutch Consulate to the United States and The Department of Cultural Affairs of the City of New York. The Horizon is Nothing More than the Limit of Our Sight, Mr. Rocco‚Äôs 1990 installation for the Brooklyn Museum of Art in New York, in addressing the natural and man-made worlds used the horizon to define a perceptual boundary. This installation implied the possibility of a new social awareness, by people sharing interests of greater ecological benefit. Confronting a video landscape, and traversing the maze of barriers which comprise this work, the spectator explores the conceptual limits, which isolate us from this awareness. Other projects during Mr. Rocco‚Äôs later European residencies at K√ºnstlerhaus Bethanien and Die K√ºnstFabrik in Berlin, Germany as well as Kunst & Complex in Rotterdam, Netherlands, resulted in exhibitions in 1991-93. The Berlin Project, fruit of his work at K√ºnstlerhaus Bethanien‚Äôs International Studio Program, was a body of art works which identified distinct facets of Berlin's evolving social dynamic. The objects showcased, referenced the socialist realism found in eastern parts of the city, as well as commercial elements taken from the west. The project, part of which is housed in Berlin‚Äôs Berlinische Galerie, utilized images taken from the streets and transit system of the city, as well as historical references, to reveal the new rules in an economic struggle beginning in the city at that time. Private Parts, the product of his residency at Kunst & Complex in 1993, focused on self-examination, an examination defined as transcending the individual. This body of work, which delineated personal issues such as age, masculinity, and health, took on more global meaning, in the context of addressing questions of human frailty, genocide and social values during times of transition. In this body of work, Mr. Rocco often refers to elements of control and order, and environments bordering on social cataclysm, through images of sinking ships, deserted streets and disoriented swimmers. He identified this work, ‚Äúfunctioning as a diary of thoughts and images, from a year of painful transformation in Europe, posting warnings of all that is at stake in the search for peace and unification in Europe‚Äù. ==Amerika== Perhaps because of long periods in residence outside the United States, or due to his earlier experiences in opposition to the Vietnam War, Rocco began to articulate a new view of American culture. Structures of Detention, an edition of photo-silk screen prints on bound editions of The New York Law Journal, document a social dynamic between crime and punishment. Houses of Detention and Federal Buildings in New York City, provide the counterpoint to court proceedings and records outlined within each page‚Äôs text. In these artworks there is a dialog established between the pages and these buildings, which provide an opportunity for social commentary and dark humor. Other works like The Pursuit Series, drawings made from television images of police activity and 30 Minutes B & W photographs in an enlarged contact sheet format focus on an American fascination with representations of criminal behavior, policing, and criminal justice. Post 9/11 as the U.S. began its ventures into war in Iraq and Afghanistan, Rocco's work became more critical of the escalating violence. Works like StarBlind and Bloody State confronted the blind march to war and its aftermath. An installation work from the end of the decade Bail Out questioned the accounting that resulted in the rescue of Wall Street in a humorous work, which included an overturned accountant's ledger, the spilled cyphers, and a golden lined parachute with its requisite air blower. The installation Shake Up! from his 2010 New York exhibition at Dam Stuhltrager Gallery, curated by Lynn del Sol is an artwork addressing issues of environmental degradation and the reality of Global Warming. It records the moment of shock; the rude awakening after a turning point. Shake Up! is the moment after the earth moves and we find ourselves in a hostile new environment. It also symbolizes the hoped for heed of the 'wake up call' to humanity. Shake Up! 2010 Photo-etched aluminum, video projection, micro-crystalline wax & vinyl fabric with ink. ==China== In 2011, Rocco visited China for the first time. He explains the circumstances of his visit in this way, \\"In the 80's I worked extensively with dancer, choreographer Mel Wong and his dance company. During that time Mel invited me to visit him in Hong Kong, while he was an artist in residence in that city. Although fascinated by the prospect of visiting Hong Kong, at that time the visit was not possible. From that point on a deep regret at missing this opportunity began to develop. I promised myself I would not miss the next opportunity when one developed. In 2011, such an invitation was offered and in keeping with my promise I came to Hong Kong. During that visit, on the suggestion of a friend, I took a ferry to Zhuhai, China. It is no exaggeration to say my interest in relocating to Zhuhai was like love at first sight.\\" Once in China new possibilities appeared. Mr. Rocco completed a master's study in Spatial Design at the University of St. Joseph in Macau, and in his thesis he discusses the developments of this period. Key to this was an interest in teaching. Mr. Rocco says he reflected on the words of Joseph Beuys when Beuys said, ‚ÄúTeaching is my greatest work of art‚Ä¶the rest is the waste product, a demonstration. If you want to express yourself you must present something tangible. But after awhile this has only the function of a historic document. Objects aren‚Äôt very important any more. I want to get to the origin of matter, to the thought behind it.‚Äù (Artforum magazine interview with Willoughby Sharp in 1969). \\"Beuys saw the role of an artist as a teacher or shaman who could guide society in a new direction.‚Äù (Sotheby's catalog, 1992). To Mr. Rocco it was clear Beuys chose the classroom as his canvas in orchestrating an open forum for intellectual exchange and frequently applied ‚Äúphilosophical concepts to his pedagogical practice.‚Äù (Wikipedia-Beuys). Rocco began teaching in China, combining art concepts with other interests in guiding his students to further their future success. In 2014, Mr. Rocco met and began working with a local architect, Josh Wu, consulting on several projects Mr. Wu was engaged in. Since then, they have together completed several architectural projects in Zhuhai, which include the interior design of the G Flowers store in the city's Gongbei district, an exterior and interior redevelopment of a building for the Contemporary Music Institute in Beishan, and most notably the redesign of a 400 year old ancestral hall in the same Beishan village for the Chengchuan Art Gallery. ==Selected solo exhibitions== * CTS creative thriftshop /Dam Stuhltrager Gallery, Brooklyn, N.Y.

Qara Iskander, the ruler of Kara Koyunlu was murdered there in 1436 by his son Shah Kubad. ==History== Alinja is mentioned in historical records for the first time in the seventh century atlas, the Ashkharhatsuyts, commonly attributed to Anania Shirakatsi, under its original Armenian name, Yernjak. It is described as the first district of the Kingdom of Armenia's province of Syunik'. Darbinyan, M. ¬´‘µ÷Ä’∂’ª’°’Ø¬ª (Yernjak). Armenian Soviet Encyclopedia.

This fortress once controlled, and gave its name to, Yernjak province, which comprised the whole valley down to the Araks river. A separate Armenian tradition states that the province was named after Lady Yernjik, a member of the royal family of the Syunik' princes. The Armenian historian Stepanos Orbelian noted its formidable position, describing it as the \\"impossible to penetrable Yernjak\\" (’°’∂’∞’∂’°÷Ä’´’∂ ’°’¥’∏÷Ç÷Ä’∂ ‘µ÷Ä’∂’ª’°’Ø). The province belonged to the Arshakuni kings of Armenia until their kingdom was dissolved in 428 A.D. The Armenian king Smbat I Bagratuni captured the canton and the fortress from the Arabs, who had taken them in 698. However, the emir of ƒÄzarbƒÅijƒÅn, Yusuf Ibn Abi'l-Saj, put the fortress under siege for a year and captured it, awarding it to the Muslim emir of Goght'n.Ter-Ghevondyan, Aram. (1976), The Arab Emirates in Bagratid Armenia, trans. Nina G. Garso√Øan. Lisbon: Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation, p. 70. The long and arduous struggle between King Smbat and emir Yusuf ended at Yernjak, where the latter put the former to death in 914. However, by the end of the tenth century Yernjak was back in the hands of the princes of Syunik'. Harutyunyan, Babken H.

After the dissolution of the Bagratuni Kingdom of Armenia in 1045, in the following centuries the region passed into the hands of external powers. It was taken by the Seljuks in the eleventh century, and by the Mongols in the thirteenth century. Yernjak was invested by the forces of Tamerlane but the fortress managed to withstand the siege for thirteen years, until it was taken in 1401.Bedrosian, Robert (1997). \\"Armenian during the Seljuk and Mongol Periods,\\" in The Armenian People From Ancient to Modern Times, Volume I: The Dynastic Periods: From Antiquity to the Fourteenth Century, ed.

It is located 5 km in the north-west from the district center, on the right bank of the Aras River, on the plain. Its population is busy with farming and animal husbandry. There are secondary school, cultural house, two libraries, communication branch, and a medical center in the village. It has a population of 482. ==History== The modern site of Gulustan was originally the location of a district of the city of Julfa. Prior to population removals started under Shah Abbas in 1604, Julfa was an Armenian city of 40,000 people. The city was at the time the center of Armenian culture, and it included a fortress, a massive bridge, and the largest medieval Armenian Cemetery on earth. After the population removals, the site was degraded to the status of a small village, with a population of a few hundred, mostly Armenian residents. During the Nagorno Karabakh War, the Armenians of the village were ethnically cleansed, and The Armenian Cemetery, the only significant vestige of the once great city of Julfa left in the village, was destroyed in what is viewed as an act of Cultural Genocide, akin to the Talibans Destruction of the Buddhas of Bamian.https://iwpr.net/global-voices/azerbaijan-famous-medieval-cemetery- vanishes == Culture and sights == Medieval Gulustan tomb close to the village === Gulustan Tomb === The architectural monument of the Middle Ages near the village of Gulustan, Julfa region. The Gulustan tomb which was built under the influence of the Momuna Khatun Tomb at the beginning of the 13th century belongs to the tower shaped tombs group of Azerbaijan. The twelve-faced body of the tomb was built of red sandstone, but the pedestal with the original structure (the corners are in form of the projected cubic) was built of the hewed stone. Despite of other tombs of Azerbaijan the vault of the Gulustan tomb is situated on the land surface (in the pedestal). The pedestal looks like the projected pyramid outside but inside is cylindrical. The projected pyramid which is square in plan (6.6 x 6.6 cm) turns to the right twelve-faced in the upper part outside and twelve-faced upper chamber is situated on it. The upper tent cover of the tomb was completely destroyed. In accordance with this to identify if the cover looked like a pyramid or conic form is very difficult. The tomb surfaces were decorated with the carving geometric ornaments and were framed with the decorative arches. Each face of the tower is completed with the arches, by means of salient forking. Inside the recesses were covered with the neat designs as it exists in the tombs of Ajami Nakhchivani. When glanced at the designs in all twelve faces, it becomes clear that the succession existing here is completed by means of three kinds of geometric designs repeatedly. The joined part of the body with the stand, also the place passing to the dome, were encircled with the carved enforcement of stalactit shape. The assembling of the ornaments with other decorative elements and their connection give a rather more vivid and elastic image to the monument. The space structure of the Gulustan tomb is the unexampled specimen on the basis of a square from the circle, from cubic capacity to conic and thus the artistic ‚Äì technical solution of the symmetric systems pass to one another. As the widespread area of these kinds of tombs is Anadolu, it is possible to regard the Gulustan tomb as the key indicator of the background unity of the central Azerbaijan and the tombs of the Anadolu Saljug. According to the symmetry between the architectural forms, cut and neatness of the designs the Gulustan tomb is differed from these stone tombs for its advantage.http://www.nakhchivan.az/portal-en/tarixi-abide/gulustan.htm ===Cuƒüa (Jugha)=== Cuƒüa (Jugha) - the settlement of the Middle Ages in the north-west from the Gulustan village. It is limited by the high mountain range in the north, by the Araz River in the south, and by the ancient cemetery in the west. The settlement in the form of narrow stripe on the left bank of the Araz River is lies towards from west to east. The residential buildings were completely destroyed in the area, remains of the building (especially burned bricks) were scattered in the around. From here were discovered the products of the glazed and unglazed ceramic in the pink colored decorated with the ornaments of various compositions, the copper coins and other examples of the material culture. There exist the archaeological monument of the Middle Ages in the west end of the place of residence. Its area is about 10 hectares. The grave monuments were from different periods, consists of the ram stones, stone graves, the chest and head stones made in the form of a rectangular prism. On the gravestones meets images of various subjects (especially the image of a winged dragon). According to the findings and grave monuments, it is assumed that the main activity period of the Cuƒüa belongs to the 11-17 centuries. There are also the grave monuments of the last period in the area. === Mineral water === The Gulustan mineral water is in the bed of the Alinjachay (Alinja River), at 2.5 km distance from the village of Gulustan, in the territory of Julfa region. The mineral water is extracted from the well of 135 m in depth which was drilled in 1962. The water is carbonic aerated, less mineralized, hyrocarbonated with natrium-calcium-magnezium.

They also bore the Greek inscription \\"Œ§Œ•Œ°ŒüŒ• ŒôŒïŒ°ŒëŒ£ ŒöŒëŒô ŒëŒ£Œ•ŒõŒüŒ•\\" (Tyrou hieras kai asylou, \\"of Tyre the holy [city] and [city] of refuge\\"). The coins were the size of a modern Israeli half-shekel and were issued by Tyre, in that form, between 126 BC and AD 56. Earlier Tyrian coins with the value of a tetradrachm, bearing various inscriptions and images, had been issued from second half of the fifth century B.C.Historia numorum: a manual of Greek numismatics. Syria, &c.; After the Roman Empire closed down the mint in Tyre, the Roman authorities allowed the Jewish rabbanim to continue minting Tyrian shekels in Palestine, but with the requirement that the coins should continue to bear the same image and text to avoid objections that the Jews were given autonomy. They were replaced by First Jewish Revolt coinage in 66 AD. The Tyrian shekels were considered tetradrachms by the Greeks, as they weighed four Athenian drachmas, about 14 grams , more than earlier 11-gram shekels but regarded as equivalent for religious duties at that time., citing David Hendin's Guide to Biblical Coins and Y. Meshorer's Ancient Jewish Coinage. Because Roman coinage was only 80% silver, the purer (94% or more) Tyrian shekels were required to pay the temple tax in Jerusalem. The money changers referenced in the New Testament Gospels (Matt. 21:12 and parallels) provided Tyrian shekels in exchange for Roman currency when this was required. ==See also== *History of currency *List of historical currencies *Shekel *Carthaginian shekel, generally roughly half a Tyrian shekel *Jerusalem shekel *Bar Kochba shekel ==References== Category:Jews and Judaism in the Roman Empire Category:Coins in the Bible Category:Tyre, Lebanon ","title":"Tyrian shekel"},{"id":"20157297","text":"Maplewood is an unincorporated community in Door County, in the town of Forestville, Wisconsin, United States.

He had been the MP here since re-gaining the seat from the Liberal at the January 1910 general election. ==History== Eddisbury had been won by the Unionists at every election since the seat was created in 1885, with the exception of the Liberal landslide election of 1906, when the Liberal Arthur Stanley won the seat. The Liberals came closest to winning the seat back in 1923 when the Unionist majority was only 196 votes. At the previous General Election in 1924, the result was a comfortable Unionist win; ==Candidates== It was a straight fight between the Unionist, Lieutenant-Colonel Roderick George Fenwick-Palmer and the Liberal, Richard Russell, Labour having decided not to contest the seat.The Times, 28 February 1929 The Labour Party had a weak organisation in the constituency and rarely fought the seat. Russell, a 57-year-old local government Alderman on Birkenhead Town Council, had the advantage of having fought the seat at the two previous general elections and had been nursing the constituency. Thirty- seven-year-old Fenwick Palmer (a descendant of Sir Robert Peel) was Chairman of Wrexham Conservative Association so was new to most electors in the constituency, although he was well known in Cheshire hunting circles.The Times, 5 March 1929 ==Campaign== On 1 March, nationally, Liberal leader, David Lloyd George launched the Liberal programme for the upcoming General Election, titled We Can Conquer Unemployment. The main issues in the election concerned agriculture, and the controversial land programme of Liberal leader David Lloyd George.The Times, 6 March 1929 This was unsurprising given the essentially rural nature of the constituency. ==Result== The result was a Liberal gain from the Unionists.The Times, 22 March 1929 The Liberal victory in a seat not won since 1906, helped fuel speculation that the Liberal Party might win a General Election, expected within months. ==Aftermath== A couple of months later, Russell held the seat at the 1929 general election against the same Unionist opponent, with a slightly reduced majority. By the time of the next general election (held in 1931) Russell had joined the Liberal National faction of the Liberal Party, and he was returned without opposition. In 1935 he was again returned unopposed as a Liberal National. ==External links== *Portrait of Richard Russell * http://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/person/mp55695/richard-john- russell?search=sas&sText;=Richard+John+Russell *Portrait of Fenwick-Palmer * http://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/person/mp67323/roderick-george- fenwick-palmer ==References== Category:1929 elections in the United Kingdom Category:By-elections to the Parliament of the United Kingdom in Cheshire constituencies Category:1929 in England Category:20th century in Cheshire ","title":"1929 Eddisbury by-election"},{"id":"20157435","text":"K…ôrimb…ôyli (also, Karimbayli, known as Leninabad until 1999)Az…ôrbaycan Respublikasƒ±nƒ±n 5 oktyabr 1999-cu il tarixli, 708-IQ n√∂mr…ôli Qanunu is a village and municipality in the Babek Rayon of Nakhchivan, Azerbaijan.

The material from New Routes and Melody Fair, augmented by her singles-only releases and unissued material, was released in 2007 as Lulu: the Atco Sessions, 1969 - 1972. ==Track listingSide one=== #\\"Good Day Sunshine\\" (John Lennon, Paul McCartney) #\\"After the Feeling is Gone\\" (Terry Woodford, George Soul√©) #\\"I Don't Care Anymore\\" (Jerry Williams, Gary U.S. Bonds, Maurice Gimbel) #\\"(Don't Go) Please Stay\\" (Burt Bacharach, Bob Hilliard) #\\"Melody Fair\\" (Barry Gibb, Maurice Gibb, Robin Gibb) #\\"Take Good Care of Yourself\\" (Jim Doris) ===Side two=== #\\"Vine Street\\" (Randy Newman) #\\"Move to My Rhythm\\" (Fran Robbins) #\\"To the Other Woman (I'm the Other Woman)\\" (Jerry Williams, Gary U.S. Bonds) #\\"Hum a Song (From Your Heart)\\" (Richard Ross) #\\"Sweet Memories\\" (Mickey Newbury) #\\"Saved\\" (Jerry Leiber, Mike Stoller) ==Personnel== *Lulu - vocals *The Dixie Flyers :Jim Dickinson - piano, guitar :Charlie Freeman - guitar :Michael Utley - organ :Tommy McClure - bass guitar :Sammy Creason - drums *The Memphis Horns :Jack Dale - trombone :Andrew Love, Ed Logan - tenor saxophone :Floyd Newman - baritone saxophone *Additional personnel :Felix Cavaliere - Latin percussion :The Sweet Inspirations, Eddie Brigati, David Brigati, Nancy Kirkpatrick, Chuck Kirkpatrick - backing vocals *Technical staff :Chuck Kirkpatrick, Ronnie Albert - engineers :Grant Gravitt - photography Category:1970 albums Category:Lulu (singer) albums Category:Albums produced by Jerry Wexler Category:Albums produced by Tom Dowd Category:Albums produced by Arif Mardin Category:Atco Records albums ","title":"Melody Fair (album)"},{"id":"20157611","text":"Bag√† is a Spanish municipality located in the comarca of Bergued√†, in Catalonia. Traditionally, Bag√† is considered the capital of Alt Bergued√†, the mountainous northern half of the comarca. ==Location== Bag√† is located at the head of the valley of the Llobregat river, at the feet of the high mountains of the Cad√≠ range. The town itself is at 785 metres above sea level. Bag√† is 20 kilometers to the north of Berga, and 7.5 kilometers to the south of the T√∫nel del Cad√≠, a tunnel which crosses the Cad√≠ range, connecting with the region of la Cerdanya. The municipality includes a small exclave to the west. ==History== Bag√† was founded in the 9th century A.D. when the region of Bergued√† was repopulated by Wilfred the Hairy. The noble family of Pin√≥s dominated most of Alt Bergued√† throughout most of the Middle Ages and administered its domains from the town of Bag√†, giving the town some importance. The town was redesigned in the 13th century by Galceran IV de Pin√≥s, and is a rare example of medieval city planning. The town grew rapidly and by the beginning of the 14th century a new neighbourhood had to be built outside the town's walls to accommodate its growing population. Bag√† was also granted a weekly market (which continues to this day) consolidating its role as a regional capital. As a curiosity, some medieval documents refer to a ‚ÄúHugo of Bag√†‚Äù being the founder of the Knights Templar, though this is uncertain. ==Population== The population of Bag√† has increased in recent years primarily due to an influx of people from the smaller towns surrounding it. { align=\\"center\\" rules=\\"all\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"4\\" style=\\"border: 1px solid #999; border-right: 2px solid #999; border-bottom:2px solid #999\\" + style=\\"font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.1em; margin-bottom: 0.5em\\" Population demographics !1900 !! 1930 !! 1950 !! 1970 !! 1981 !! 1986 !! 2006 -  align=center800 align=center1,021 align=center1,275 align=center2,388 align=center2,130 align=center2,154 align=center2,178 } ==Economy== The economy of Bag√† once centered on the textile industry and mining. These industries provided the basis for the economy in the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries. Since the collapse of these industries, the region‚Äôs economy has focused on rural tourism, as well as winter sports tourists filtered from the nearby region of Cerdanya Plaza in Bag√† ==The Fia-faia== The Fia-faia is a celebration of the winter solstice dating from pre-Christian times which takes place in Bag√† every Christmas Eve. A bonfire is set in the mountains to the west of the town, where the sun sets. After dark, inhabitants of the town set faies, or bundles of Cephalaria leucanta alight and carry them from the bonfire to the central square of the town, where they are left on the ground. Children then jump over the fires, singing ‚ÄúFia-faia, Fia-faia, que nostro senyor ha nascut a la palla‚Äù, or ‚ÄòFia- faia, for our Lord is born in the hay‚Äô. Afterwards, bread is toasted over the fires and eaten with all i oli or quince paste. ==Sites of interest== *St. Esteve de Bag√† is the parish church of the town, built between the 14th and 15th centuries. *Santuari de la Mare de D√©u del Paller is a neoclassical sanctuary two km outside town, dedicated to the town's patroness, the ‚ÄúVirgin of the Haystack‚Äù *Pla√ßa Porxada, the town's central square, built in the 13th century ==References * Government data pages Category:Municipalities in Bergued√† Category:Populated places in Bergued√† ","title":"Bag√†"},{"id":"20157617","text":"An airplane game, also known as the Plane Game, was a style of pyramid scheme in the 1980s first active in North America and then in Western Europe. alt=First, 1 \\"Captain\\" paid when 8 \\"passengers\\" arrived at the bottom. Second, 2 \\"Co-Pilot\\". Third, 4 \\"Crew\\". Fourth, 8 \\"Passengers\\" must pay into the scheme before the layers above can advance. The common version of the system involved joining an \\"airplane\\" by paying a \\"pilot\\" to become one of eight \\"passengers\\". Published in print edition as \\"'Plane Game' taking many for a big ride\\". Passengers started at the fourth step from being paid. Already on the airplane were four \\"flight attendants\\" who were a step ahead, and two \\"co-pilots\\" next in line behind the pilot. Once a pilot collected $12,000 from passengers to retire, the group split into two \\"airplanes\\", with each co-pilot becoming the pilot of the new airplane, taking half the participants and promoting everyone a level. Bringing in new passengers sped up everyone's progression towards retiring as a pilot. However, the structure of the scheme results in a participant losing the entire payment unless 14 new participants join. The scheme had spread from New York to Texas to California then South Florida by early 1987, with police raiding meetings in all four states, and reports of more airplane schemes operating in Dallas. In Dade County, Florida, at least one recruiting session was reported with 1,000 attendees. Though common versions at the time required passengers to pay $1,500 to receive $12,000 as a pilot, some airplanes were being run with $5,000 passengers and a $40,000 pilot payout. The scheme has also gone by the names Concorde and Golden Galaxy with similar names for the steps. Cash Club, Victoria operated in the same way but with different amounts and the steps renamed to \\"club member\\", \\"committee member\\", \\"vice-president\\", and \\"president\\". \\"Krona Klub\\" was a similar scheme with more complex payout rules, as was a so-called game variously called \\"Cosmic Adventure\\", \\"Flying Saucer\\", or \\"Flying Starship\\". The scheme resurfaced in 2020, conducted over Instagram and other social media platforms, going by a variety of names including Loom Game and Wheel. ==References * Originally written in Spring 1993.

It extended northward from the current site past the current location of the Lachine Canal to Lac √† la Loutre, which was then located at the foot of the Falaise Saint-Jacques, where the Turcot yards are today. The area was essentially agricultural, and remained so until the Lachine Canal bisected the area in 1825; Lac √† la Loutre was dried out. Chemin de la Rivi√®re-Saint-Pierre (now avenue de l'√âglise) was built to join Chemin de la C√¥te-des-Argoulets (Boulevard LaSalle) with the Chemin de la C√¥te-Saint-Paul (Rue Saint-Patrick). With the canal providing water power for factories, workers started to move in nearby, forming the nucleus of the community in the triangle bounded by the Lachine Canal, Rue Angers, and Avenue de l'√âglise. The village of C√¥te-Saint- Paul was founded in 1874. The first √âglise Saint-Paul was built in 1875, and a town hall and railway station soon followed. The western part of the village separated in 1878, forming the Parish Municipality of C√¥te-Saint-Paul, later Ville-√âmard. The balance of the village of C√¥te-Saint-Paul became a town in 1894 and was renamed Saint-Paul in 1897. Clockwise from the north, the town of Saint-Paul was bounded by the Lachine Canal, the Grand Trunk Railway, the north bank of the Aqueduct Canal, the property line behind the lots on the west side of Frontenac Street (now Rue Leprohon), a property line just north of Rielle Street (now Rue Laurendeau), First Avenue (now Rue le Caron), and St. Louis Street (now Rue Briand).Pinsoneault, Adolphe Rodrigue.

Available online from Biblioth√®que et Archives nationales du Qu√©bec; consulted July 5, 2011. In 1910, Saint-Paul merged into the city of Montreal at the same time as neighbouring Ville-√âmard. Industrial development continued and the remaining agricultural lands were converted to housing. However, like the rest of the Lachine Canal area, the neighbourhood went into decline with the construction of the St. Lawrence Seaway. The construction of the D√©carie Expressway and the Turcot Interchange in 1964 tore through the heart of old Saint-Paul, though it spared the institutional buildings along Avenue de l'√âglise. In 1978, the Montreal Metro reached C√¥te-Saint-Paul with the construction of Jolicoeur metro station.\\"Fiche du secteur: C√¥te-Saint- Paul.\\" Grand r√©pertoire du patrimoine b√¢ti de Montr√©al. Accessed 4 July 2011. In 2002, the area became part of the borough of Le Sud-Ouest. Today, the western limit of the neighbourhood C√¥te-Saint-Paul is not precisely defined, but it is somewhat expanded to the west of the official limit in its days as an independent town, with the building-up of the agricultural land since then and the destruction of the town's centre. ==Geography== The neighbourhood is bordered to the south by Desmarchais Boulevard, to the west by Monk Boulevard, to east by the aqueduct, and to the north by the Lachine Canal and the railroad track bordering Pointe-Saint-Charles. C√¥te-Saint-Paul can be accessed by the De La V√©rendrye exit on Quebec Autoroute 15. ==Infrastructure== The neighbourhood is served by the Jolicoeur Montreal Metro station. It is crossed and bordered by the Lachine Canal and the Aqueduct Canal. Parc de La V√©rendrye and Parc Saint-Paul offer recreation, and the Aqueduc and Lachine Canal bicycle paths are linked by a path through the C√¥te Saint-Paul industrial area east of the D√©carie Expressway. ==References== Category:Neighbourhoods in Montreal Category:Le Sud-Ouest Category:Heritage sites in Quebec (Cultural Heritage Act) ","title":"C√¥te-Saint-Paul"},{"id":"20157657","text":"Accidental Friendship is a 2008 Hallmark Channel original film directed by Don McBrearty, and written by Anna Sandor based on a true story. It stars Chandra Wilson and Ben Vereen. ==Plot== Homeless woman Yvonne Caldwell (Chandra Wilson) is a woman with good reason to be bitter: she has lost everything except her two beloved dogs, Bebe and Man-Man. With her one friend, Wes (Ben Vereen), Caldwell lives the daily struggle of being homeless in Los Angeles until a chance encounter caused by her dogs leads to a friendship with LAPD officer Tami Baumann (Kathleen Munroe), and hope for a better life begins in earnest for Yvonne. Friendship between the two women seemed improbable, but their friendship provided a base of support and respect for Yvonne and Tami for more than five years. ==Cast== * Chandra Wilson as Yvonne Caldwell * Kathleen Munroe as Tami Baumann * Ben Vereen as Wesley \\"Wes\\" Smith * Gabriel Hogan as Kevin Brawner * Alison Sealy-Smith as Tami's colleague and friend ==True story== In real life, Yvonne Caldwell met Officer Tami Baumann, an officer at LAPD‚Äôs 77th Street Division, in 2003. It was Yvonne‚Äôs three dogs that caught Tami‚Äôs attention, and the overwhelming care she took of the strays. Tami, who was well known in the department for her love of animals ‚Äì and who had been finding homes for strays since she was a child ‚Äì used this connection to form a bond with Yvonne. Over time, Yvonne began to open up to Tami, relating her gradual fall into poverty, a tale of struggling with abuse and abandonment which led to a long battle with alcoholism. By mid-2001, her prized SUV was her home and only possession, but that too was taken from her when she couldn‚Äôt afford the fees to release it from impound after it was stolen. Fortunately, Tami was eventually able to convince Yvonne to enter rehab and embark on a program designed to save her life. ==Critical reception== The film was generally well-received by critics. Variety stated that the director \\"doesn't stoop to the usual gimmicks,\\" and called the script \\"thoughtful.\\" They also thought the story was \\"simple\\" and \\"meaningful,\\" and said it was \\"more of a character study than a message movie.\\" Marilyn Moss of The Hollywood Reporter gave it a milder review, stating that the film \\"stretches it a bit in the sentimental category,\\" but still \\"holds a grip without too much effort,\\" yet at the same time \\"there is hardly anything to set a spark.\\" She also said, \\"When the corn doesn't get in the way of the story, this movie is believable and affecting.\\" Chandra Wilson was praised for her portrayal as a \\"bitter\\"; Moss stated that \\"she easily takes hold of the frame whenever she's in it.\\" ==Award and honors== Chandra Wilson was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Miniseries or Movie for her performance. ==References *Accidental Friendship on Hallmark Channel's website * Category:2008 television films Category:2008 drama films Category:Hallmark Channel original films Category:American drama films Category:American films Category:American films based on actual events Category:Films about homelessness Category:Films set in Los Angeles ","title":"Accidental Friendship"},{"id":"20157667","text":"The Rock Creek Woods Historic District is a national historic district located north of Kensington, Montgomery County, Maryland (although the postal address is Silver Spring).

While this early version is commonly referred to as \\"Happy Rabbit\\", animation historian David Gerstein disputes this, saying that the only usage of the term was from Mel Blanc himself; the name \\"Bugs Bunny\\" was used as early as August 1939, in the Motion Picture Herald, in a review for the short Hare-um Scare- um.Motion Picture Herald: August 12, 1939 \\"...With gun and determination, he takes to the field and tracks his prey in the zany person of \\"Bugs\\" Bunny, a true lineal descendant of the original Mad Hatter if there ever was one...\\" Several published first person accounts, encyclopedic references, and Warner Bros.' own published material describe the inception of the name and of the character. A model sheet by Charlie Thorson describes this prototype character as \\"Bugs' Bunny\\" (note the apostrophe) but in most of the cartoons the character is unnamed. Virgil Ross, the animator for A Wild Hare describes how the character came to be named in the interview published by Animato! magazine #19. Mel Blanc often told the story of the creation of the character and its name. He suggested that the character be named after the character's initial director, Ben \\"Bugs\\" Hardaway. Blanc's own book, That's Not All Folks published by Warner Books in 1988, describes the \\"tough little stinker\\" that was the eventual version of the redesigned character as directed by Avery. Warner Brothers' own published descriptions of the creation of the character's name can be found in Animation Magazine published in 1990. Therein it is described that the Hardaway unit's model sheet came to be known by fellow animators as \\"Bugs' Bunny\\". == Early appearances  Porky's Hare Hunt === Ben Hardaway and Cal Dalton introduced the first version of the character in Porky's Hare Hunt (released April 30, 1938). In the cartoon Porky Pig is hunting and fires at several rabbits. Soon, Porky and his dog meet the rabbit and try to outwit him in the forest. Porky and the rabbit get in a long fight and soon the hare thinks he has won and that the war is over; Porky, however, finds the rabbit and the Bunny doesn't have any brainstorms to protect him. The rabbit shows Porky a photo of himself and of how many children he has with his wife. However, when Porky's about to shoot him, the gun fails. After Porky attempts to shoot down and procure the rabbit, the rabbit asks Porky: \\"Do you have a hunting license?\\" As Porky reaches for his pocket to obtain the document, the hyperactive hare suddenly snatches it out of Porky's grasp, rips it in two, remarks, \\"Well you haven't got one now...hoohoohoohoohahahahah..hoo hoo hoo ha ha ha!\\" and makes a getaway by twisting his ears as though they were a helicopter propeller, flying away. Ultimately the rabbit wins when Porky throws dynamite into the cave in which the hare is hiding and the rabbit throws the dynamite back at him. Porky is in the hospital and the rabbit comes to him with some flowers. Porky tells the hare that he'll be out in a few days. The very hyper rabbit then pulls on the leg holders in Porky's bed, adding to the his injuries, and runs off into the forest. === Prest-O Change-O === Leon Schlesinger gave Chuck Jones the next cartoon, Prest-O Change-O (released March 25, 1939). In this cartoon two rogue dogs are being pursued by a dog catcher until they hide in an abandoned house. There they encounter a trunk owned by Sham-Fu the magician (unseen). They open it, and all manner of magic tricks come out of the trunk, including his pet rabbit. The rabbit tricks the two dogs repeatedly, causing them endless frustration, until he is bested by the bigger of the two dogs, who bops him with a lampshade. === Hare- um Scare-um === Schlesinger assigned Hardaway and Dalton to direct the next short, Hare-um Scare-um (released August 12, 1939). It starts with a man reading a newspaper article stating that meat prices have soared (and that customers are sore). Angry, he declares that he will hunt his own meat to get back at the government for the price inflation. He then tells his dog he is going hunting for rabbits. A rabbit lays a trap for the dog, and the dog gets scared of the sound. The bunny then plays \\"Guess Who\\" with the dog, with the dog answering in barks. The hunter then sees rabbits, aims his gun, then runs over to where it was. When he gets there, there is a spinning wheel with rabbit signs. The hunter then sees the hare sleeping. The hunter starts pouring salt on the rabbit's tail, but the rabbit quickly changes position so that the hunter is salting a celery stalk instead. The rabbit starts eating it and says, \\"Celery, mighty fine nerve tonic. Boy, have I got nerve.\\" The hare runs in a cave, and the hunter runs after him. Before he reaches the cave, an elevator appears and the hunter collides with it. The rabbit then opens it and says, \\"Main floor, leather goods, pottery, washing machines and aspirin, going up!\\" and closes it as the elevator goes up. The elevator floor goes back down, the hare opens it and says, \\"You don't have to be crazy to do this ‚Ä¶ but it sure helps,\\" closes it and the elevator goes down. The bunny then dresses in girl-dog drag. The dog then sees the rabbit in drag; he thinks it is a dog, then he notices it is the rabbit. The hare then pretends he is a policeman, and the hunter then finds the rabbit. He explains to the hunter how poor he is. He then shocks the hunter, who falls to the ground. The hunter then tells the now-hiding hare he can whip the rabbit and his whole family, then he's suddenly surrounded by a lot of rabbits that look like the first rabbit. === Elmer's Candid Camera === Jones directed the next cartoon, Elmer's Candid Camera (released March 2, 1940) which features the first appearance of Elmer Fudd. In this cartoon, Elmer has come to the country to photograph wildlife. As he tries to photograph a rabbit, the rabbit finds him a convenient victim to harass. This tormenting eventually drives Elmer insane, causing him to jump into a lake and nearly drown. The rabbit saves him, ensures that Elmer is all right now - and then kicks him straight back into the lake. == Full form == This was followed by Tex Avery's A Wild Hare, released July 27, 1940, which is considered the debut of Bugs Bunny in full. Avery changed several of the rabbit's characteristics: his voice became a cross between the Bronx and Brooklyn accents, the color of his gloves became white, as did the color of his mouth, and his ears were changed slightly as well. The cartoon was so successful that Warner Bros. decided to keep him on as a recurring character, eventually becoming the studio's most popular cartoon character. The character's name, previously only used on model sheets, became the official all-purpose name as well, with one modification: the apostrophe was dropped from his first name (now pronounced \\"bugs\\" rather than \\"bugs-es\\"). A title card saying \\"featuring Bugs Bunny\\" was inserted into his next appearance, Elmer's Pet Rabbit, after initial production of that cartoon wrapped up, though that cartoon showed Bugs with many of his pre-Wild Hare characteristics. Bugs Bunny's personality continued to evolve over the years, from a largely \\"screwball\\" character (a la Daffy Duck), to a mixture of \\"screwball\\" and \\"everyman\\" characteristics. His definitive design was created in 1943 by Bob Clampett, who requested one of his animators, Bob McKimson, to create new model sheets of Bugs for the short Tortoise Wins by a Hare. Bugs' define look would be adopted by each unit slowly (though Chuck Jones, Robert McKimson and Friz Freleng had slight variations). Bugs' look was modified again for the 2011 series The Looney Tunes Show, for the 2015 series Wabbit (retooled as New Looney Tunes in the second season), and for Looney Tunes Cartoons in 2020, which returns to using the yellow gloves from the earliest color appearances ==Cameos== *The rabbit made two cameos in 1939 and 1940, both starring Porky and both by Bob Clampett. The two cameos were Patient Porky and Naughty Neighbors. *In the Touchstone Pictures and Amblin Entertainment film, Who Framed Roger Rabbit, the character can be seen walking through the Maroon Cartoon studio lot for three-quarters of a second before the shot changes. *In a deleted sequence from the film Looney Tunes: Back in Action, Bugs Bunny, upon being zapped by a magical idol, transforms into the character. This sequence can be seen in the \\"Deleted Scenes\\" featurette on the DVD release. == References == Category:Fictional hares and rabbits Category:Looney Tunes characters Category:History of animation ","title":"Development of Bugs Bunny"},{"id":"20157902","text":"William Ronald \\"Roy\\" John (29 January 1911 ‚Äì 12 July 1973) was a Welsh international footballer who played as a goalkeeper for Manchester United, Newport County, Sheffield United, Stoke City, Swansea Town and Walsall as well as the Wales national team. ==Football career== Born in Briton Ferry, John began his career with Briton Ferry Athletic before joining Swansea Town in 1927. At this time he was an outfield player, originally a full-back (where he was \\"not greatly appreciated\\") before initially moving forward to play as a half-back, where he gained a reputation as \\"a resolute tackler with a useful kick\\". He left Swansea in May 1928, having not played a Football League game for them. He then joined Walsall, where he played for the reserve side as a half-back. Following the departure of Fred Biddlestone to Aston Villa in January 1930 and an injury to the reserve goalkeeper, manager Sid Scholey asked John to try out for the custodian's shirt. John did so well in a practice match that he was quickly promoted to first-team goalkeeper. Within months he made his international debut, when he played for Wales against Ireland on 22 April 1931. His debut match ended in a 3‚Äì2 victory to the Welsh. One writer of the time described him as \\"dashing and daring ‚Äì a gay cavalier who laughs fortune in the face\\". After 88 league games for Walsall, he was transferred to Stoke City in April 1932, where he was part of the team which won the Football League Second Division title in 1932‚Äì33. The local media described John's performances during that season as \\"simply brilliant\\". He struggled though in the First Division and was sold to Preston in the summer of 1934. After six months at Preston North End, John moved to Sheffield United in December 1934, for a transfer fee of ¬£1,250. He made 29 League appearances for the Blades, before he was sold to Manchester United in June 1936, for a fee of ¬£600. His debut for the club finished in a 1‚Äì1 draw with Wolverhampton Wanderers on 29 August 1936. He transferred to Newport County in March 1937, having made 15 appearances for United. He moved back to Swansea Town four months after joining Newport. In 1938, he helped Swansea reach the final of the Welsh Cup, where they were defeated by Shrewsbury Town in a replay. He remained at the Vetch Field club until the Second World War cut his career short. He officially retired on 11 November 1939, when he became a hotel manager. During the war, John guested for several clubs in the north-west of England, including Southport, and in September 1942 he played for a Wales XI against the R.A.F. ==International career== John made 14 appearances for Wales in full internationals, helping Wales win the British Home Championship in 1933 and 1934. During his time as the Wales goalkeeper, he alternated with Bert Gray and Len Evans. ==Career statisticsClub=== Source: {  style=\\"text-align: center;\\" - !rowspan=\\"2\\"Club !rowspan=\\"2\\"Season !colspan=\\"3\\"League !colspan=\\"2\\"FA Cup !colspan=\\"2\\"Total - !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals - rowspan=\\"5\\"Walsall 1928‚Äì29 Third Division North 400040 - 1929‚Äì30 Third Division North 10000100 - 1930‚Äì31 Third Division North 37040410 - 1931‚Äì32 Third Division North 37010380 - !colspan=2Total !88!!0!!5!!0!!93!!0 - rowspan=\\"4\\"Stoke City 1931‚Äì32 Second Division 100010 - 1932‚Äì33 Second Division 40020420 - 1933‚Äì34 First Division 30030330 - !colspan=2Total !71!!0!!5!!0!!76!!0 - rowspan=\\"3\\"Sheffield United 1934‚Äì35 Second Division 22020240 - 1935‚Äì36 Second Division 700070 - !colspan=2Total !29!!0!!2!!0!!31!!0 - Manchester United 1936‚Äì37 First Division 15000150 - Newport County 1936‚Äì37 Third Division South 10000100 - rowspan=\\"3\\"Swansea Town 1937‚Äì38 Second Division 17000170 - 1938‚Äì39 Second Division 23010240 - !colspan=2Total !40!!0!!1!!0!!41!!0 - !colspan=3Career Total !253!!0!!13!!0!!267!!0 } ===International=== Source: { class= style=\\"text-align: center\\" - !National team!!Year!!Apps!!Goals - rowspan=7Wales 193110 - 193230 - 193330 - 193420 - 193510 - 193620 - 193820 - !colspan=2Total!!14!!0 } ==Honours== ;Stoke City *Football League Second Division champions: 1932‚Äì33 ;Swansea Town *Welsh Cup finalists: 1938 ;Wales *British Home Championship: 1933, 1934 ==References * Profile at StretfordEnd.co.uk * International career details Category:1911 births Category:1973 deaths Category:People from Briton Ferry Category:Welsh footballers Category:Wales international footballers Category:Association football goalkeepers Category:English Football League players Category:Swansea City A.F.C. players Category:Walsall F.C. players Category:Stoke City F.C. players Category:Preston North End F.C. players Category:Sheffield United F.C. players Category:Manchester United F.C. players Category:Newport County A.F.C. players Category:Wales wartime international footballers Category:Southport F.C. wartime guest players ","title":"Roy John (footballer)"},{"id":"20157906","text":"Society Burning is an American coldwave industrial rock act composed of Daveoramma, Twitch, and Boom chr Paige. The group was founded in Las Cruces, New Mexico, United States, as a side project of Daveoramma's in 1991 by the moniker ‚ÄòThe Watchmen‚Äô (a tribute to the Alan Moore graphic novel). ==History== Shortly before the release of project's first self produced work, Daveoramma brought on guitarist Boom chr Paige. They caught the attention of Chase of Cargo/Re-constriction records that same year. The band gained recognition via Usenet newsgroups and the nascent Internet, being one of the first acts to embrace the technology as a marketing vehicle. The duo released another self produced work in 1992, gaining attention from Chase again, as well as German label Kugel Blitz. Both labels released compilations featuring the band, but the band was forced to change its name upon discovering another band already using their moniker. The resulting name ‚ÄòSociety Burning‚Äô (ripped from a quote from a Denver, Colorado newscast) was chosen in time for both record labels to use it on separate compilation appearances. During this time the band enlisted the help of Michael Smith of Fiction 8 for assistance with keyboards on-stage. In 1993, the band met Steven Seibold of Hate Dept., who would go one to produce/re-engineer the song ‚ÄúHuman Waste‚Äù for the Re- Constriction compilation Thugs 'n' Kisses. This would be the beginning of an odd precedent set by Re-Con and the band for 'premixing', or releasing the remixed material before releasing the original versions of their work. In 1995, Society Burning signed to Re-Constriction. The following year, the label issued the premix cd Entropy Lingua. In 1997, Re-Constriction then issued their album Tactiq. Over the next two years, the musicians worked mostly independently: Daveoramma worked with a cast of voices to bridge songs for the parody/tribute album Cyberpunk Fiction while Boom chr Paige worked as remixer for artists including Le√¶ther Strip, Purr Machine, THD, Urania, Hexedene, and Battery. The band parted ways in 1999, following the closure of Re- Constriction. Daveoramma relocated to Los Angeles, California, Twitch remained in Denver, Colorado, and Boom chr Paige is currently located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The band regrouped 2007, writing material for a new release on their own Audiocomm International Publishing label in addition to finalizing and releasing their previously unreleased 1994 album State of Decay in late 2009. October 2010 saw the release of their sixth album Internal Combustion. ==DiscographyAlbums and EPs=== * Is God in Showbusiness Too?

The Motueka electorate had 311 registered electors for the 1861 election. Localities within the electorate were Motueka and Mapua. The Motueka electorate took in about half the area of the prior electorate; the other half had gone to the electorate. ==History== From the 3rd to the 10th New Zealand Parliament, Motueka was represented by five Members of Parliament (counting Monro, who was unseated following a petition). Curtis and Parker had previously represented the electorate. David Monro represented the electorate in 1871 until he was unseated by Parliament on a petition.

In , Hudson was unexpectedly beaten by 24-year-old George Black of the United Party. The Reform Party looked for potential candidates to win back the electorate, and a young farmer who was not even a member, Keith Holyoake, was suggested. Holyoake, who had been saving money to go overseas, was chosen in June 1931 from five candidates to contest Motueka, and his savings went into the election campaign instead. Meanwhile, there was a desire by parts of the United Party to enter into a coalition with the Reform Party to avoid vote splitting on the centre-right, but it was not until September that the United‚ÄìReform Coalition was announced. Black had voted with the Labour Party in March 1931 on the Finance Bill and was expelled from the United Party the following day, thus becoming an Independent. At the , Black beat Holyoake. In October 1932, Black committed suicide, and this caused the 1932 Motueka by-election, which was won by future prime minister Holyoake.

He had one season for Worcestershire at the end of his career. Grove appeared for Warwickshire's Second XI in the Minor Counties Championship as early as 1933, but his first-class debut was five years later in June 1938 against Northamptonshire, when he took 3-53 including the wicket of opposing captain Robert Nelson at Edgbaston. His two other first-class games that summer brought Grove no wickets, but in 1939 he took 37, including two five-wicket hauls, and (said his Wisden obituarist) showed promise before the Second World War intervened. Obituary. Wisden Cricketers' Almanack 1983. He played a number of matches during the war, but his first-class career did not resume until 1947. He took 98 wickets that season, and though this figure was reduced to 60 the following year, he managed at least 80 every season from 1949 until the end of his Warwickshire career in 1953. A notable performance in 1950 was his first-innings 8-38 against the West Indians, which helped Warwickshire to become the only county that season to defeat the tourists. He passed fifty on five occasions in his career, all between 1947 and 1949, including one century: 104 not out against Leicestershire in late August 1948; he scored his runs in 80 minutes. In 1951, Grove's benefit year, he took 100 wickets in a season for the first time, finishing with 110 at 18.52. The 1952 season saw him top this total as he helped Warwickshire to the County Championship title: he picked up 118 wickets, including ten or more in a match on four occasions, and claimed a career best 9-39 versus Sussex in June. As of 2008, only Jack Bannister (twice) has recorded better innings figures for Warwickshire since Grove's achievement. Grove ended his Warwickshire career after the 1953 season, and then had a single year with Worcestershire, playing only the middle part of the season. Although he took 8-66 against Gloucestershire in late May, he was not particularly successful, finishing the year with 42 wickets at an average of slightly over 30. His final first-class outing came against Derbyshire in mid-July, and was an unsuccessful experience for Grove: he took 0-68 in the match and made a duck in his only innings. He later played club cricket in the Birmingham League. ==NotesReferences== * * Category:English cricketers Category:Warwickshire cricketers Category:Worcestershire cricketers Category:1912 births Category:1982 deaths Category:North v South cricketers ","title":"Charles Grove"},{"id":"20158013","text":"Silvio Bosco Front√°n Vega (born March 24, 1984 in Paysand√∫, Uruguay) is an Uruguayan soccer player currently playing for Deportivo Pasto in the Colombian Categor√≠a Primera A.

Yeats based the character largely on the real-life bard Owen Roe O'Sullivan (Eoghan Ruadh √ì S√∫illeabh√°in). In his first appearances, in fact, Hanrahan's name is O'Sullivan the Red, with Yeats later altering the name to Hanrahan the Red and ultimately Owen \\"Red\\" Hanrahan and making him more of an amalgam of the bardic tradition and a heavily folkloric character. Hanrahan first appears in Yeats' work in the mid-1890s as the author of various poems and songs. He is the central figure of a half-dozen short stories, collectively titled Stories of Red Hanrahan, in 1897. In the first of these short stories, Hanrahan is described at the outset as \\"the hedge schoolmaster, a tall, strong, red-haired young man,\\" who first appears as he enters a \\"barn where some of the men of the village were sitting on Samhain Eve.\\" This description identifies Hanrahan with Irish folklore in several ways; schoolmasters were often nationalistic poets; red-headed men often possess magical powers; and supernatural occurrences often take place on Samhain.Hirsch, \\" 'And I Myself Created Hanrahan'\\", p. 885. In later stories, Hanrahan, in his wandering, is confounded both by women and by several supernatural experiences. ==References * Stories of Red Hanrahan at Project Gutenberg ==See also== * Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak, \\"Principles of the Mind\\": Continuity in Yeats's Poetry,\\" MLN, Vol. 83, No. 6, Comparative Literature (Dec., 1968), pp. 882-899 Category:Characters in short stories Category:Male characters in literature Category:Fictional schoolteachers Category:Literary characters introduced in 1897 Category:Fictional English people ","title":"Owen Red Hanrahan"},{"id":"20158101","text":"The following ships of the Indian Navy have been named Chakra: * was formerly the K-43 leased in 1987 from Russia and returned in 1991 * was formerly the Nerpa leased from Russia in 2011 and currently in service Category:Indian Navy ship names ","title":"INS Chakra"},{"id":"20158113","text":"Vincent Cespedes Vincent Cespedes (born 14 September 1973 in Aubervilliers, Seine-Saint-Denis) is a French philosopher, writer and composer.

Originally an early railroad suburb, the opening of streetcar lines led to the expansion of the district in the early 20th century. Takoma Park houses built between 1883 and 1900 are fanciful, turreted, multi-gabled affairs of Queen Anne architecture with Stick Style and Shingle Style influence. Buildings developed after the turn of the 20th century tend to be 1-2 story brick structures with simple ornamentation, although a few display characteristics of such styles as Art Deco and Tudor Revival.

Those elections had shown changes in party representation, with three parties, namely the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP), the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP), winning 75% of the seats. On the Unionist side, the DUP arrived at a position of near parity with the UUP, outpolling the latter by 851 votes, although the UUP managed to win more seats overall. Other changes on the Unionist side saw the disbandment of two smaller Unionist parties: the Unionist Party of Northern Ireland in September 1981 and the United Ulster Unionist Party in May 1984. On the nationalist side, while the SDLP maintained its dominant position, a greater number of elected candidates supporting the H-Block protest were elected. In total 36 candidates endorsed by the H-Block committee were elected of whom 21 belonged to the IIP. The representation of the centrist APNI was almost halved as their number of seats was reduced from 70 in 1977 to 38 in 1981. ===Northern Ireland Assembly and New Ireland Forum=== Following the end of the Hunger Strike, attention focused on attempts by the new Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Jim Prior, to restore devolution. This eventually led to the establishment of the Northern Ireland Assembly which was elected in October 1982. However nationalist parties boycotted the forum and the SDLP instead threw its efforts into the New Ireland Forum. This forum, established in May 1983, reported in May 1984 and represented the combined efforts of the nationalist parties to obtain a solution to the constitutional issue. However the report was rejected by British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher who rejected each of the three proposals with the words ‚Äúthat is out‚Äù in a response that became known as the \\"out, out, out\\" speech.Irish Times, 20 November 1984, p1 accessed 10 April 2009 ===Sinn F√©in=== The entry into electoral politics of Sinn F√©in (SF) became a significant issue in the run up to the elections. SF polled over 10% in the 1982 Assembly election, winning five seats. At the 1983 Westminster election, the party increased their vote share to 13.4% and maintained that level of support in the 1984 European election. The party won their first council seat in a by-election in March 1983, with Seamus Kerr polling 60% in Omagh ‚ÄòArea D‚Äô This was followed by the election of Alex Maskey and Sean McKnight to Belfast City Council in June 1983 and February 1984 respectively. In Dungannon and Fermanagh, independent councillors Seamus Cassidy and John Joe McCusker joined SF. Prior's successor as Secretary of State, Douglas Hurd, refused to ban SF and also rejected calls by unionists for an anti-violence declaration to be signed by all candidates.Northern Ireland: The District Council Elections of 1985, S Elliott and FJ Smith, Queens University 1986, ===Rates=== The expansion of services, particularly leisure began to have an impact in rates at a time when the Rate Support Grant was being cut. The grant was reduced by 1% in 1985. Belfast Leisure Services in particular accounted for 22.7% of the City budget. Rates overall had risen by 8% in the financial year from 1984 to 1985, a figure above the rate of inflation and resulted in the cancellation of a proposed ice rink in Belfast, while that in Bangor had to receive private funding. Since the 1980‚Äì1981 financial year, rates had risen by 51.7% ranging from a 17.9% rise in Castlereagh to 80% rises in Omagh and Newry and Mourne. ==LegislationBoundaries=== The Local Government (N.I.) Act 1972, Section 50 (1) required a review of local government boundaries and electoral areas in 1981, however it was not until 28 October 1982 that Prior reappointed Sir F. Harrison, who had conducted the previous review in 1971 and 1972. Provisional recommendations were published on 20 May 1983. These led to additional representations and nineteen public hearings before revised recommendations were published on 18 January 1984. Following six further public hearings, the final report was sent to the Secretary of State on 29 May 1984. The report recommended no change in the number of councils or their names. The number of wards was increased from 526 to 566. Moyle was the only council to lose a ward. With the wards drawn the government decided that a new procedure would be used to group them together to form District Electoral Areas (DEA). In 1972 the wards had been grouped together into areas of four to eight wards with each area electing a number of councillors equal to the number of wards that it contained. This had been done by the Chief Electoral Officer, a fact that had been criticised for potentially affecting his impartiality. The District Electoral Areas Commissioner (N.I.) Order was laid before Parliament on 15 December 1983. This provided for the appointment of a commissioner and set him the task of creating electoral areas containing five to seven members. These were to have names rather than an alphabetic designation as before. The debate over the Order in January and February 1984 centred on the merits of STV, the narrower number of councillors in each DEA and the names issue. Unionists argued for DEAs electing four to six councillors. ==CampaignResultsOverall=== {  - ! colspan=\\"2\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  PartyLocal Government Elections 1985, Northern Ireland Elections ! colspan=\\"2\\"  Councillors ! colspan=\\"2\\"  Votes - ! style=\\"text-align: right;\\" valign=\\"top\\"  Total ! style=\\"text-align: right;\\" valign=\\"top\\"  +/- ! style=\\"text-align: right;\\" valign=\\"top\\"  % share ! style=\\"text-align: right;\\" valign=\\"top\\"  Total -  align=\\"right\\" 189  align=\\"right\\" +37  align=\\"right\\" 29.5  align=\\"right\\" 188,497 -  align=\\"right\\" 142  align=\\"right\\" 0  align=\\"right\\" 24.3  align=\\"right\\" 155,297 -  align=\\"right\\" 102  align=\\"right\\" -2  align=\\"right\\" 17.8  align=\\"right\\" 113,967 -  align=\\"right\\" 59  align=\\"right\\" N/A  align=\\"right\\" 11.8  align=\\"right\\" 75,686 -  align=\\"right\\" 34  align=\\"right\\" -4  align=\\"right\\" 7.0  align=\\"right\\" 45,038 -  align=\\"right\\" 9  align=\\"right\\" -28  align=\\"right\\" 1.6  align=\\"right\\" 10,297 -  align=\\"right\\" 8  align=\\"right\\" +6  align=\\"right\\" 1.3  align=\\"right\\" 8,780 -  align=\\"right\\" 6  align=\\"right\\" +6  align=\\"right\\" 1.2  align=\\"right\\" 7,597 -  align=\\"right\\" 4  align=\\"right\\" +1  align=\\"right\\" 1.6  align=\\"right\\" 10,415 -  align=\\"right\\" 4  align=\\"right\\" -17  align=\\"right\\" 1.2  align=\\"right\\" 7,459 -  align=\\"right\\" 3  align=\\"right\\" -2  align=\\"right\\" 0.5  align=\\"right\\" 3,139 -  align=\\"right\\" 2  align=\\"right\\" +1  align=\\"right\\" 0.6  align=\\"right\\" 3,612 -  Protestant Unionist  align=\\"right\\" 1  align=\\"right\\" +1  align=\\"right\\" 0.5  align=\\"right\\" 2,970 -  align=\\"right\\" 1  align=\\"right\\" 0  align=\\"right\\" 0.2  align=\\"right\\" 1,285 -  align=\\"right\\" 0  align=\\"right\\" N/A  align=\\"right\\" 0.2  align=\\"right\\" 1,029 -  Newtownabbey Labour  align=\\"right\\" 1  align=\\"right\\" 0  align=\\"right\\" 0.1  align=\\"right\\" 792 -  align=\\"right\\" 0  align=\\"right\\" N/A  align=\\"right\\" 0.1  align=\\"right\\" 782 -  Labour and Trade Union  align=\\"right\\" 0  align=\\"right\\" N/A  align=\\"right\\" 0.1  align=\\"right\\" 556 -  Independent Democratic Unionist  align=\\"right\\" 0  align=\\"right\\" N/A  align=\\"right\\" 0.1  align=\\"right\\" 429 -  align=\\"right\\" 0  align=\\"right\\" 0  align=\\"right\\" 0.1  align=\\"right\\" 387 -  align=\\"right\\" 0  align=\\"right\\" -2  align=\\"right\\" 0.0  align=\\"right\\" 276 -  align=\\"right\\" 0  align=\\"right\\" 0  align=\\"right\\" 0.0  align=\\"right\\" 245 -  All Night Party  align=\\"right\\" 0  align=\\"right\\" N/A  align=\\"right\\" 0.0  align=\\"right\\" 235 -  align=\\"right\\" 0  align=\\"right\\" 0  align=\\"right\\" 0.0  align=\\"right\\" 187 -  align=\\"right\\" 0  align=\\"right\\" -2  align=\\"right\\" 0.0  align=\\"right\\" 131 -  Independent Workers' Party  align=\\"right\\" 0  align=\\"right\\" N/A  align=\\"right\\" 0.0  align=\\"right\\" 113 -  align=\\"right\\" 0  align=\\"right\\" N/A  align=\\"right\\" 0.0  align=\\"right\\" 35 -  align=\\"right\\" 0  align=\\"right\\" -1  align=\\"right\\" 0.0  align=\\"right\\" 30 } ===By council=== Antrim Ards Armagh Ballymena Banbridge Belfast {  - !colspan=\\"4\\" align=\\"center\\"  CourtBelfast City Council Elections 1985‚Äì1989, Northern Ireland Elections - ! colspan=\\"2\\" align=\\"center\\" width=200  Party ! width=150 Candidate ! width=60 1st Pref -  align=\\"right\\" George Seawright  align=\\"right\\" 2,970 -  align=\\"right\\" Hugh Smyth  align=\\"right\\" 1,761 -  align=\\"right\\" Ted Ashby  align=\\"right\\" 1,420 -  align=\\"right\\" Herbert Ditty  align=\\"right\\" 1,197 -  align=\\"right\\" Joe Coggle  align=\\"right\\" 894 -  align=\\"right\\" Fred Cobain  align=\\"right\\" 804 -  align=\\"right\\" W.

He was the older brother of botanist and theologian Georg K√ºkenthal (1864‚Äì1955). K√ºkenthal specialized in the Octocorallia and on marine mammals. He edited, along with Thilo Krumbach, a landmark series of eight volumes in the Handbuch der Zoologie series which extensively reviewed and compiled the state of zoological knowledge of the time. ==Life== K√ºkenthal was born to August K√ºkenthal (1826-1910) and Minna Wimmer (died 1917) and went to school at Wei√üenfels and Halle before joining the University of Munich where he studied mineralogy and later zoology at Jena, earning his doctorate at the latter institution in 1884 for studying lymphoid cells in annelids. He travelled around the North Sea with B. Wei√üenborn and joined the zoology department Jena under Ernst Haeckel in 1885. In 1886, with support from the Senckenberg Natural History Society, he participated in an expedition to Borneo and the Moluccas. He specialized in the study of Octocorallia, a taxonomic subclass that includes sea pens, sea fans and soft corals. In 1887 he obtained his habilitation, becoming a professor of phylogeny at Jena two years later. From 1898 he served as professor of comparative anatomy and zoology at the University of Breslau (Wroc≈Çaw) and as director of the zoological museum which in the present day is the Museum of Natural History, University of Wroc≈Çaw (\\"Muzeum Przyrodnicze Uniwersytetu Wroc≈Çawskiego\\" in Polish).

K√ºkenthal was principally interested in comparative anatomy and conducted embryological and comparative anatomical investigations of whales and other marine mammals. He was a supporter of Haeckel's biogenetic law. His other area of interest was the systematics of coelenterates and cnidarians. He published the Leitfaden f√ºr das Zoologische Praktikum (1898) and from 1913 he edited along with Thilo Krumbach the Handbuch der Zoologie. He has over twenty zoological species named after him, including Calamorhabdium kuekenthali (Batjan iridescent snake), Emoia kuekenthali (Kuekenthal's emo skink),Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011).

In March, 1950, Windmills applied for entry into the Western Australian Soccer Football Association. The desire was to field one team of Dutch migrants who aspired to play their traditional sport in their new country.

New Routes, the d√©but album release by Lulu on Atco Records, was produced by the label's top Atlantic Records production team: Tom Dowd, Arif Mardin and Jerry Wexler. Wexler had been interested in Lulu ever since 1964, when his business associate Bert Berns had recorded her on \\"Here Comes the Night\\". Her 1969 signing to Atlantic's Atco label was facilitated by Lulu's becoming engaged to Maurice Gibb of Atco's top musical artists, the Bee Gees. New Routes was preceded by the October 1969 release of the track \\"Oh Me Oh My (I'm a Fool for You Baby)\\", which gradually reached #22 on the Billboard Hot 100 in February 1970. New Routes debuted on Billboard 200 chart in February, peaking at #88.

Nam Le (Vietnamese: L√™ Nam) (born 1978) is a Vietnamese-born Australian writer, who won the Dylan Thomas Prize for his book The Boat, a collection of short stories. His stories have been published in many places including Best Australian Stories 2007, Best New American Voices, Zoetrope: All-Story, A Public Space and One Story. In 2008 he was named a 5 under 35 honoree by the National Book Foundation. ==Life and early career== Nam Le came to Australia from Vietnam with his parents, when he was less than a year old, as a boat refugee.Metherell, Gia (2008) \\"Vietnamese refugee wins top English literary award\\", The Canberra Times, 11 November 2008 He attended Melbourne Grammar School and the University of Melbourne, from which he graduated with a BA (Hons) and LLB (Hons). His Arts thesis supervisor was the Australian poet Chris Wallace-Crabbe. He worked as a corporate lawyer and was admitted to the Supreme Court of Victoria in 2003/2004. Le decided to turn to writing, and in 2004 attended the Iowa Writers' Workshop in the United States where he completed a Masters in Creative Writing. He became fiction editor at the Harvard Review. His first short story was published in Zoetrope in 2006. Nam Le also held fellowships at the Fine Arts Work Center in Provincetown in 2006, and at the Phillips Exeter Academy, in 2007. In an interview on Australian ABC radio, he said he turned from law to writing due to his love of reading: \\"I loved reading, and if you asked me why I decided to become a writer, that's the answer right there, because I was a reader and I was just so enthralled and thrilled by the stuff that I'd read that I just thought; what could be better? How could you possibly better spend your time than trying to recreate that feeling for other people\\". In the same interview he said that his first writing was poetry. He returned to Australia in 2008, but is moving to Great Britain to take up a writing fellowship at the University of East Anglia. When asked about his source of inspiration, Nam Le said in 2008 that \\"I‚Äôd say I‚Äôm most inspired by my parents for the choices and sacrifices they‚Äôve made. It still boggles me\\". ==Style== Regarding his style, Nam Le said in an interview that \\"one of the demarcations is writers that deal primarily with language, the more lyrical minded writers, and writers that are more structurally oriented. I always used to...I started out writing poetry and reading poetry, and so I always knew that that was the side that I was most predisposed to, and so I actually had to be quite careful in these stories to not overdo that impulse, to not throw too many images or indulge too many lyrical flights of fancy.\\" ==The Boat== The book, first published in 2008, comprises seven short stories which take the reader to such places as Colombia, New York City, Iowa, Tehran, Hiroshima, and small-town Australia. In the opening story, Love and Honor and Pity and Pride and Compassion and Sacrifice, he writes about a Vietnamese-born character called Nam Le who is attending a writing workshop in Iowa. In a conversation with Michael Williams he said about the practice of using a narrator close to \\"self\\" in a story: > A lot of people presume if I'm writing a narrator who has clear parallels to > me, that's just sheer inertia; that there's a natural adaptation from so- > called life to so-called text. But any careful reader or writer would > understand how much artifice and contrivance go into making this self- > standing and self-contained. Actually it's tougher: if I stick in something > that has more resonance for me than is communicated on the page, then that's > a failure of my charge as a writer . . . I'm not creating a good enough > space for the reader to come in and fully partake in that scene or that > language or that line.\\" Each story provides \\"a snapshot of a pivotal point in the characters' lives\\". Nam Le has said of his Vietnamese heritage and writing that: > My relationship with Vietnam is complex. For a long time I vowed I wouldn‚Äôt > fall into writing ethnic stories, immigrant stories, etc. Then I realized > that not only was I working against these expectations (market, self, > literary, cultural), I was working against my kneejerk resistance to such > expectations. How I see it now is no matter what or where I write about, I > feel a responsibility to the subject matter. Not so much to get it right as > to do it justice. Having personal history with a subject only complicates > this ‚Äî but not always, nor necessarily, in bad ways. I don‚Äôt completely > understand my relationship to Vietnam as a writer. This book is a testament > to the fact that I‚Äôm becoming more and more okay with that. Australian short story writer Cate Kennedy, interviewing Nam Le, said that The Boat has put the short story back in \\"the literary centre stage\\". ==Awards and nominations== *2010: PEN/Malamud Award *2009: Anisfield-Wolf Book Award *2009: Prime Minister's Literary Award for Fiction: Winner of the $100,000 (AUS) prize for \\"The Boat\\" *2009: Queensland Premier's Literary Awards Australian Short Story Collection - Arts Queensland Steele Rudd Award *2009: Vance Palmer Prize for Fiction: Shortlisted for The Boat *2009: New South Wales Premier's Literary Awards Book of the Year and UTS Glenda Adams Award for New Writing for The Boat *2008: Dylan Thomas Prize for The Boat *2008: National Book Foundation's \\"5 Under 35\\" Award *2008: Frank O'Connor International Short Story Award: Longlisted *2007: Pushcart Prize *2007: Michener-Copernicus Fellowship ==External links== * * ==References== Category:1978 births Category:Living people Category:Vietnamese refugees Category:Australian people of Vietnamese descent Category:Australian male short story writers Category:Academics of the University of East Anglia Category:Writers of Vietnamese descent Category:Academics of Vietnamese descent Category:Iowa Writers' Workshop alumni Category:Vietnamese writers Category:PEN/Malamud Award winners ","title":"Nam Le"},{"id":"20158591","text":"Piers IslandPiers Island is an island in British Columbia, Canada, located on the boundary of Discovery Passage, a waterway which with nearby Haro Strait forms the section of the Canada‚ÄìUS border separating the Gulf Islands in British Columbia, of which Piers is a part, from the San Juan Islands of Washington state. ==Name== The island is named for Henry Piers (d. 1902), a Royal Navy surgeon who served on and and at the Pacific Station (Esquimalt), later Deputy Inspector of Hospitals and Fleets. ==History== In the early 1930s a portion of the island was a penal colony used to house Sons of Freedom (a group of Doukhobor extremists.) ==References== * Category:Islands of the Gulf Islands ","title":"Piers Island"},{"id":"20158607","text":"This is the discography of Japanese pop singer melody.. ==AlbumsStudio albums=== {  !Album # !Album information !Peak Position !Sales Total !Chart Run - bgcolor=\\"#F0F8FF\\" 1st / Debut Sincerely *Released: January 21, 2004 *Languages: Japanese, English *Catalog#: TFCC-86145 align=\\"center\\"3 87,294 14 weeks - 2nd Be as One *Released: April 12, 2006 *Languages: Japanese, English *Catalog#: TFCC-86202 align=\\"center\\"5 78,587 10 weeks - bgcolor=\\"#F0F8FF\\" 3rd Ready to Go! *Released: July 4, 2007 *Language: Japanese *Catalog#: TFCC-86225 align=\\"center\\"6 45,184 2 weeks - 4th Lei Aloha *Released: April 9, 2008 *Language: Japanese *Catalog#: TFCC-86252 align=\\"center\\"15 20,609 7 weeks } ===Compilation albums=== {  !Album # !Album information !Peak Position !Sales Total !Chart Run - bgcolor=\\"#F0F8FF\\" 1st The Best of Melody: Timeline *Released: October 8, 2008 *Length: 1:11:14 *Language: Japanese align=\\"center\\"4 42,155  - } ===Featured albums=== {  !Album # !Album information !Peak Position !Sales Total !Chart Run - bgcolor=\\"#F0F8FF\\" 1st Astromantic *Artist: M-Flo *Released: May 26, 2004 *Featured Track: #2 ‚Äì Miss You *Language: Japanese align=\\"center\\"-  -  - - 2nd Cosmicolor *Artist: M-Flo *Released: March 28, 2007 *Featured Track: #4 ‚Äì Stuck in Your Love *Language: Japanese align=\\"center\\"-  -  - - bgcolor=\\"#F0F8FF\\" 3rd aThe Popular Music *Released: July 11, 2007 *Featured Track: Manatsu No Dekigoto *Language: Japanese align=\\"center\\"-  -  - - 4th Alpen Best: Another Edition *Released: December 15, 2007 *Featured Tracks: Crystal Love, Next to You *Language: Japanese align=\\"center\\"-  -  - - bgcolor=\\"#F0F8FF\\" 5th Daybreak *Artist: Tanaka Roma *Released: June 4, 2008 *Featured Track: #2 ‚Äì Boyfriend/Girlfriend *Language: Japanese align=\\"center\\"84  -  - - 6th Ryohei Best *Artist: Yamamoto Ryohei *Released: September 3, 2008 *Featured Track: Miss You (M-Flo Loves Melody & Yamamoto Ryohei) *Language: Japanese align=\\"center\\"-  -  - } ==Singles== {  !Single # !Single information !Peak Position !Sales Total !Chart Run - bgcolor=\\"#F0F8FF\\" 1st / Debut align=\\"left\\"\\"Dreamin' Away\\" *Released: February 19, 2003 *Studio Album: Sincerely *B-sides: Now, 24 Seven *Length: 14:50 *Language: Japanese *Catalog#: TFCC-89058 align=\\"center\\"33 20,054 8 weeks - 2nd \\"Simple as That/Over the Rainbow\\" *Released: June 18, 2003 *Studio Album: Sincerely *Length: 11:04 *Language: Japanese *Catalog#: TFCC-89070 align=\\"center\\"19 14,608 5 weeks - bgcolor=\\"#F0F8FF\\" 3rd \\"Crystal Love\\" *Released: November 27, 2003 *Studio Album: Sincerely *B-side: Do You Hear What I Hear?

He worked at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics (KWIP) and contributed to the German nuclear energy project, also known as the Uranium Club. After World War II, he helped rebuild the KWIP branch at Hechingen, was a professor at the University of T√ºbingen and Ankara University, and then a research scientist for the German firm GKSS. ==Education== From 1929 to 1935, Fischer studied at the Rheinische Friedrich- Wilhelms-Universit√§t Bonn, the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit√§t M√ºnchen, and the Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universit√§t (today, the Humboldt-Universit√§t zu Berlin). He received his doctorate at the University of Berlin under Walther Nernst and A. Deubner.Hentschel and Hentschel, 1996, Appendix F; see the entry for Fischer. ==Career== After receipt of his doctorate, Fischer was a teaching assistant to W. Friedrich at the University of Berlin from 1935 to 1936. In 1937, he became an assistant under Peter Debye and Werner Heisenberg at the Kaiser-Wilhelm Institut f√ºr Physik (KWIP, Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics) in Berlin- Dahlem; today, the KWIP is known as the Max-Planck Institut f√ºr Physik). He completed his Habilitation in 1939, and he then also became a Privatdozent at the University of Berlin in 1942. During World War II, Fischer worked in the German nuclear energy project, also known as the Uranverein (Uranium Club). His contributions included determination of the rate of neutron multiplication in heterogeneous uranium-moderator combinations. In the latter years of World War II, Berlin scientific organizations moved equipment and personnel out of the city to escape effects of Allied air raids. The KWIP had partly evacuated to Hechingen and Haigerloch in southern Germany. The Uranmaschine (nuclear reactor) B 8 (B-VIII) was constructed in Haigerloch. The construction of the reactor utilized 1.5 tons of heavy water, 1.5 tons of uranium, and 10 tons of graphite. The configuration was uranium in the form of cubes (40 chains of 9 cubes each and 38 chains of 8 cubes each) in heavy water surrounded by graphite. The report on the B 8 experiment was written by Fritz Bopp, Erich Fischer, Werner Heisenberg, and Karl Wirtz from the KWIP and Walther Bothe, Peter Herbert Jensen, and Oskar Ritter from the Institut f√ºr Physik (Institute for Physics) of the Kaiser-Wilhelm Institut f√ºr medizinische Forschung (KWImF, Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Medical Research), in Heidelberg. Fischer, and to a lesser extent Bopp, were found by blood tests to have suffered damage from neutron radiation exposure.Hentschel and Hentschel, 1996, 377 and 377n73.Bericht √ºber den Versuch B8 in Haigerloch, as cited in Hentschel and Hentschel, 1996, 377n73.Walker, 1993, 84, 103 and 152. After 1945, Fischer helped to rebuild the Hechingen branch of the KWIP. In 1948, Fischer transferred to the Eberhard Karls Universit√§t T√ºbingen and became a lecturer on experimental physics; in 1950, he became a nichtplanm√§√üiger Professor (supernumerary professor) there. In 1956, he became a full professor at the Ankara University. From 1956, he was employed at the newly founded German firm GKSS, where he conducted research for the construction of nuclear reactors.GKSS Mission Statement. ==Internal Reports== The following reports were published in Kernphysikalische Forschungsberichte (Research Reports in Nuclear Physics), an internal publication of the German Uranverein. The reports were classified Top Secret, they had very limited distribution, and the authors were not allowed to keep copies. The reports were confiscated under the Allied Operation Alsos and sent to the United States Atomic Energy Commission for evaluation. In 1971, the reports were declassified and returned to Germany. The reports are available at the Karlsruhe Nuclear Research Center and the American Institute of Physics.Hentschel and Hentschel, 1996, Appendix E; see the entry for Kernphysikalische Forschungsberichte.Walker, 1993, 268-274. *Erich Fischer Bestimmung des Absorptionsquerschnittes von Uran f√ºr langsame Neutronen G-79 (26 June 1941) *Fritz Bopp, Erich Fischer, Werner Heisenberg, Carl-Friedrich von Weizs√§cker, and Karl Wirtz Untersuchungen mit neuen Schichtenanordnungen aus U-metall und Paraffin G-127 (March 1942) *Werner Heisenberg, Fritz Bopp, Erich Fischer, Carl-Friedrich von Weizs√§cker, and Karl Wirtz Messungen an Schichtenanordnungen aus 38-Metall und Paraffin G-162 (30 October 1942) *Fritz Bopp and Erich Fischer Einfluss des R√ºckstrumantels auf die Neutronenausbeute des U-Brenners G-249. *Fritz Bopp, Walther Bothe, Erich Fischer, Erwin F√ºnfer, Werner Heisenberg, O.

The club currently (2019) competes in the Football West State League Division 1. ==History== Formed in 1970 the club was first named Ashfield Dynamo after its location in an industrial area. A dynamo is a machine that produces energy, so was a fitting name for the newly founded, \\"energetic\\" club. It competed in the Semi Professional League Division 2 in 1976. Following the Australian Soccer Federation decision to ban all ethnic names at all levels of competition, the club was renamed Ashfield Soccer and Sports Club. The fact that \\"Dynamo\\" was not ethnically linked in any way, seemed to be forgotten by the governing body at the time. In 1996 a partnership with Bunbury Tricolore, saw the name changed to Ashfield-Bunbury and the club won its first title in 1998. In 2001 Bunbury Soccer Club decided to strike out on their own (as South West Phoenix FC) and the name changed back to Ashfield Soccer and Sports Club. This did not deter the club, as they won their second title in the same year. 2010 saw the name shortened to Ashfield Sports Club. ==Honours== *First Division Winners ‚Äì 1998 (Ashfield/Bunbury), 2001 (Ashfield) *First Division Runners Up ‚Äì 2006, 2007, 2014, 2015 *Third Division Winners ‚Äì 1988 *Cup Runners Up ‚Äì 2013 *Night Series Lower Division Runners Up ‚Äì 2007, 2010 ==Season history== {  style=\\"text-align:center; font-size:90%;width:50%; text- align:center\\" +Ashfield FC League History !Season !!

John Trudeau (c. 1927 ‚Äì November 3, 2008) was an American musician who expanded the music department at Portland State University and helped co-found the outdoor Britt Festival of performing arts in Jacksonville, Oregon, the first of its kind in the Pacific Northwest.Kettler, Bill. \\"Britt founder's 'passion for music' remembered: Services pending for Jacksonville festival creator John Trudeau\\", Mail Tribune, November 8, 2008. Accessed November 10, 2008. In 1951, Trudeau came to Portland, Oregon to join the Oregon Symphony as its principal trombone player. Trudeau first came to Southern Oregon in 1955 with the Portland Symphonic Brass Ensemble for a performance at the Oregon Shakespeare Festival in Ashland, Oregon, whose founder suggested the creation of a classical musical festival in the area. Trudeau began a search, hoping to find an area that would be like Tanglewood in Massachusetts, home of the Tanglewood Music Festival. Together with Sam McKinney they established the Britt Festival in 1963 as a two-week-long celebration of music in Jacksonville, described by The Oregonian as \\"a picturesque former gold-mining town in southern Oregon\\". The two had been searching for a site and found it in an area that had been homesteaded by Peter Britt in the 1850s, and recognized that the site's natural acoustics made it appropriate for outdoor performances. The only such festival on the West Coast of the United States when it was created, the stages were constructed with plywood and canvas, with lights set inside tin cans. By the time of Trudeau's death in 2008, the event had grown to a four-month-long performing arts event from June into September, featuring top names in classical, dance, pop, rock and musical theater and inspiring dozens of other festivals throughout the West. Starting as an instructor, Trudeau spent 32 years at Portland State, rising to full professor, and was later appointed department chairman and ultimately dean of the School of Fine and Performing Arts. In 1977, he hired the members of the Florestan Trio as artists-in-residence and faculty members in the music department. With the group's appointment, the music department was able to attract better-qualified students. The university orchestra, which Trudeau conducted, expanded in size and improved in quality. Trudeau died at age 81 on November 3, 2008 from complications related to congestive heart failure.Stabler, David. \\"The longtime leader of PSU's Music Department dies at 81S.

Myers criticizes utilitarian views, especially \\"negative\\" utilitarianism, which holds that ethics require nothing more than the minimization of harm, and of deontological views, which emphasize social duties and adhering to social norms, i.e. rules. As an alternative to utilitarianism and deontology, Myers explores the ethics of character and identity, self-knowledge and shared life. ==Biographical information== Born in 1974, in Guelph, Ontario, Canada, Brendan was raised in Elora Ontario, a small village north of Guelph in Wellington County, Ontario. He was born the eldest son of an Irish-Canadian family and completed a bachelor's degree in drama and philosophy in 1996 and then a master's degree in philosophy in 1999, both from the University of Guelph. While at university, he became more involved in ethics and environmentalism and he converted from Catholicism to paganism, becoming an activist member of the neo-pagan community. Myers continued his academic career in Ireland, and eventually completed a doctoral dissertation entitled \\"Time and the Land\\" at the National University of Ireland, Galway. ==Professional life== His first published work was a play entitled Visions of a Better Way, which won a competition for high school students run by University of Guelph's department of English. Myers attended the University of Guelph for undergraduate studies in drama, starting in January 1992. He further attended Memorial University of Newfoundland, reading folklore there in 1994. Myers then began his master's studies at Guelph in 1998, majoring in philosophy. In 2000, he published a dissertation titled \\"Animism, Spirit, and Environmental Activism\\", and was matriculated. For the two years following, he served as president of a labour union (CUPE local.) Myers began doctoral studies in philosophy at the National University of Ireland, Galway in 2001, touring the European continent, especially England and Germany. He completed doctoral studies in 2005 with a dissertation entitled \\"Time and the Land: Four Approaches to Environmental Ethics, Climate Change, and Future Generations\\". ==Pagan activism== Myers returned to Canada in late 2005, and taught philosophy at several universities and colleges in Ontario and Quebec. In 2007, he worked as a contract researcher for the Government of Canada studying Aboriginal values and ethics, morals and logic in relation to police work and peacekeeping and consensus government. In 2008 he was awarded the Mount Haemus Award for research in Druidry, from the OBOD in association with Salisbury Cathedral.

The station was manned year-round until the late 1930s when it became a summer-only station. It was one of the first National Park Service-built facilities in Glacier. The design pre-dates the standardized National Park Service Rustic style, using a similar but simplified construction technique resembling pioneer construction.

Merriam Distinguished Service Professor in the Department of Economics at the University of Chicago where he remained a research associate (professor) until 2018. ==Biography== Robert Townsend was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 1948. He is the brother of John S. Townsend, a professor of physics at Harvey Mudd College. Townsend received his B.A. from Duke University in 1970 and Ph.D. from the University of Minnesota in 1975. He began teaching at Carnegie Mellon University in 1975, and became a Professor at the University of Chicago in 1985 where he stayed full-time until moving to MIT in 2008. From 1987 to 1989 Townsend was also editor of the Journal of Political Economy. In addition to his professorships, Townsend is the Principal Investigator and Project Director of the Enterprise Initiative, funded by the John Templeton Foundation, and the Principal Investigator of the Consortium on Financial Systems and Poverty, funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Additionally, he is a consultant for numerous institutions, including the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, the World Bank, and Banco de Espa√±a. Townsend is a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and of The Econometric Society, as well as an Elected Member of the National Academy of Sciences. He was the recipient of the Jean- Jacques Laffont Prize in 2011, and a Frisch Medal in 1998 for his work on village India and in 2012 for the structural evaluation of a large-scale microfinance program in Thailand; Townsend is the award's only two-time winner. ==Research== Townsend began his work as a theorist in general equilibrium models and contract theory/mechanism design, but is known primarily for his work on revelation principle, costly state verification, optimal multi-period contracts, decentralization of economies with private information, models of money with spatially separated agents, and forecasting the forecasts of others. His contributions in econometrics include the study of risk and insurance in developing countries. Since 1997, Townsend's Thai Project has undertaken large scale village surveys in Thailand to analyze the interaction between household decisions and community behavior at the level of families, villages, regions, and the nation. The Townsend Thai study was the first of its kind and has been the stepping stone for many other applied and theoretical projects in economic development and contract theory. Townsend's work has demonstrated innovation in the combination of theory and data, as well as the ability to work across various sub-fields. A documentary film about his research and field work in Thailand, titled Emerging Thailand: The Spirit of Small Enterprise, was created in 2012. ==Films== In 2012, a series of documentary films was created about the people and research behind the Townsend Thai Project. The series consists of one main film and a set of smaller, shorter films that highlight the work of entrepreneurs in rural Thailand. * Emerging Thailand: The Spirit of Small Enterprise (34:15) * Portraits of Thailand: Silkworm Farmer (2:37) * Portraits of Thailand: Rubber Farmer (3:05) * Portraits of Thailand: Food Cart Owner (1:51) * Portraits of Thailand: Dairy Farmer (2:21) ==Books== *(with Sombat Sakunthasathien and Rob Jordan) \\"Chronicles from the Field: The Townsend Thai Project\\" (MIT Press, 2013).

The role had most notably been portrayed by Michael Graziadei from 2004 to 2013. Daniel is the son of Phyllis Summers (Michelle Stafford, Gina Tognoni) and Danny Romalotti (Michael Damian), however a later storyline revealed that Daniel's biological father is a man named Brian Hamilton. Daniel's major storylines have included a love story and marriage with Lily Winters (Christel Khalil, Davetta Sherwood), of which their parents disapproved, as well as being married to Amber Moore (Adrienne Frantz). Most recently, Daniel fathered a child named Lucy after the mother, Daisy Carter (Yvonne Zima), raped Daniel. Other storylines include his strong friendship with Kevin Fisher (Greg Rikaart), the death of Cassie Newman (Camryn Grimes), and short-lived romances with Abby Newman (Marcy Rylan, Melissa Ordway) and Eden Baldwin (Jessica Heap). ==Casting== Cam Gigandet's portrayal of Daniel was short-lived as he was let go shortly after his arrival. The character was first portrayed by twins Desiree and Hannah Wheel from 1994 to 1996, after which Michael McElroy took over the recurring role from 1996 to 1997. Chase MacKenzie Bebak portrayed Daniel from 1997 to 1998, followed by Roland Gibbons, who had a brief stint until the character was written out. Subsequently, the character was rapidly aged, with Cam Gigandet assuming the role on March 10, 2004.The Young and the Restless recap (March 10, 2004) - Soapcentral.com The actor was fired after only a few days, and he last aired as Daniel on May 6, 2004. The role was recast with Owen Beckman, but the actor was also fired soon after landing the role; as opposed to Gigandet, Beckman's scenes were deleted when Michael Graziadei was cast in the role,The Young and the Restless news: Gigandet, Beckman out (April 26, 2004) - Soapcentral.com who debuted on May 10, 2004. In May 2009, Graziadei signed a new contract with the soap, but in 2012, he chose not to renew his contract. He made his last appearance on January 3, 2013. However, Graziadei later reprised the role for four episodes from July 30 to August 2, 2013 to help usher his onscreen mother, Michelle Stafford, out of the series. In July 2016, Entertainment Weekly reported at Graziadei will briefly return on August 25, 2016, coinciding with The Young and the Restless's 11,000 episode. ==Storylines== Daniel was born off-screen on August 17, 1993; his birth year has since been revised to 1987. Daniel first arrived in Genoa City in 2004 after returning from boarding school to live with his mother, Phyllis Summers. Because she did not raise him as a child, Daniel resented Phyllis as well as her boyfriend, chemist Damon Porter. Daniel then befriended Kevin Fisher, who was desperate to regain some respect after performing some not so nice deeds. Daniel agreed to help him out in exchange for hooking him up with Mackenzie Browning. The two had a lowlife named Alex come on to Lily Winters too strong, so that Kevin could rescue her and that she would like him. Alex went too far and slipped her a date rape drug and attempted to rape her. However, Kevin did arrive in time to \\"save\\" her. When Alex kept threatening Daniel and Kevin, Phyllis found out, and she and Damon scared Alex enough to get him out of town. Daniel then decided to give Phyllis a chance. Michael Graziadei and Christel Khalil as Daniel Romalotti and Lily Winters Daniel had a romance with Lily Winters in 2005, after he was involved in an accident with Cassie Newman, resulting in her death. Suffering memory loss from the accident, Daniel could not remember that fourteen-year-old Cassie was driving in an ill-fated attempt to drive a drunken Daniel home herself. Daniel and Lily then ran away to Los Angeles to escape vehicular homicide charges, and a Romeo and Juliet-style romance unfolded. The fugitives were caught, and Daniel was soon exonerated. Lily's furious parents, Neil and Dru Winters, soon sent her away to boarding school, leaving Daniel devastated. Lily returned in February 2006, and they reunited and eloped in Las Vegas. Later on, Alex returned to blackmail Daniel and Kevin. Daniel then decided to come clean to Lily, who then told her parents. However, she decided to forgive him as did her parents. In early 2007, Daniel began a flirtation with the conniving Amber Forrester, of which Lily was unaware. He then began helping her in her mission to keep her new husband, Cane Ashby, so that she could get her hands on his newfound family's money. To say thank you, Amber gave Daniel a pass to watch a video of her on an adult website, which eventually led to Daniel becoming addicted to pornography. After Lily figured out that Amber was the person that had a picture of her naked breasts on Daniel's cellphone, she realized that she couldn't trust her husband any longer and subsequently kicked him out. When Neil found out about Daniel's recent behavior, he fired him from his job at Newman Enterprises. Daniel then moved in with Kevin and Amber. Daniel, Amber, and Kevin found a princely sum of money ($700,000 to be precise) belonging to Plum, one of Amber's beaus from her Strangers By Night days. They found the money next to Plum's dead body and decided to keep it all a secret. They then received a visit from John Bonacheck who claimed to be looking for Plum and his money because Plum had stolen it from his war buddy, Carson McDonald. It turned out Bonacheck was a rogue member of the FBI who wanted the money for himself and even kidnapped Amber, Cane and Carson. Once they were rescued, Daniel, Kevin and Amber were arrested. However, Kevin's brother and lawyer, Michael Baldwin, had the charges against them dropped. All of this commotion caused Daniel and Lily to end their marriage. Lily then began a relationship with Cane, while Daniel soon began a flirtation with A.D.A. Heather Stevens, after she began to show her more sensitive side, which was a big deal considering that she was attempting to prosecute him, Kevin and Amber. She also managed to send his mother to prison for extortion, although she was released after two months. After Daniel threw Heather a party to cheer her up in the midst of her court cases, and he and a drunken Amber had sex. Since the encounter made their living together awkward, Amber moved out. However, the two were unable to stay away from each other, and they had sex again, which ended with Daniel discovering that Amber had kept some of the stolen money that they got from Plum. Although she tried to convince him and Kevin to keep it, they decided to burn it. Daniel then got Amber a job at his mom, Nicholas Newman, Jack Abbott, and Sharon Newman's new magazine Restless Style. While at the launch party for the magazine, Amber helped convince Daniel to mend the rift between him and his father, Danny Romalotti, who came to perform at the event. He and Amber then began an actual relationship. Daniel's father offered him a job on his tour as an assistant photographer, which Daniel accepted. Daniel returned home on July 10, 2008, and he found out from his girlfriend, Amber, that his mother, Phyllis Summers Newman, had been trying to break them up by making Amber believe that Daniel had been cheating on her. Soon after, she informed him that she slept with Adrian Korbel out of inadequacy, whereupon he angrily and suddenly broke up with her and left her apartment, much to her devastation. He struggled to get over the break-up via rebound dates with Colleen Carlton. On October 15, 2008, Amber and Daniel got back together. In early 2009, Daniel started his painting and drawing with Amber at his side as a fashion designer. In mid 2009, Daniel was asked to make a fake copy of a 'Terroni,' and he would get paid a sum of money for it. Later, it is believed that he and Jana Hawkes, Kevin's wife, killed the man who asked him to do this in an alley. Daniel managed to stay out of jail long enough to meet Deacon Sharpe, Amber's ex-lover and father of Amber's adopted child, Eric Sharpe, when she was in Los Angeles. Then, Daniel was put in jail, leaving Amber to get him out of jail herself. While Daniel was in jail, he received a phone call from Deacon, claiming to be Michael, Daniel's lawyer. On the other end, he heard Amber and Deacon having sex. When Amber visited him later, he yelled at her, asking her why she did that and what was he supposed to do now that he was going to propose to her. Amber and Daniel consequently broke up. Daniel was soon released, due to the DVD that Deacon sent to the A.D.A, Heather Stevens. On September 14, 2009, Daniel proposed to Amber, calling her his \\"soul mate\\". Two months later, he and Amber were finally married. The couple ignored the fact that the date was Friday the 13th, which was often associated with bad luck. Their marriage began to fall apart over Amber's obsession of her adoptive son, Eric Forrester Sharpe, and Daisy Callahan's personal obsession with Daniel. Daisy was the daughter of Sheila Carter and Tom Fisher, making her Kevin's half-sister. She drugged and had sex with a barely conscious Daniel, who thought he was having sex with his wife, Amber, while her aunt, Sarah Smythe, posing as Lauren Fenmore, attempted to kill Phyllis on another scheme with Patty Williams, who was posing as Dr. Emily Peterson. Amber then realized that Daniel didn't betray her. However, her fear over Eric's safety led to her abandoning him, and therefore ending their marriage. Amber left Genoa City with Eric in tow, and a heartbroken Daniel finally gave up on their marriage. Daniel decided not to give up on his friendship with Jana Hawkes just because she and Kevin were getting a divorce. Jana was touched by Daniel's kind words. Soon after, Daniel began a flirtation with a now grown-up, Abby Newman. In October 2010, a powerful storm hit Genoa City, and Daniel decided to help a worried Abby look for her mother, Ashley Abbott. When the storm became too much, the two took shelter at Crimson Lights. Daisy then returned to town, pregnant with Daniel's daughter. Phyllis did not believe that the pregnancy was possible, and she ordered a paternity test. It was confirmed that Daniel was the father; however, he did not take the news well. He ultimately agreed to have Daisy stay with him until the baby was born, which caused friction between him and Kevin, who planned to become the baby's guardian once she was born, being that the baby would be his niece. On New Year's Eve, Daniel searched for Daisy when she went into labor and escaped from Jana, who was supposed to be driving her to the hospital. He ultimately found her on the side of the road, stopped on her way to Canada and about to give birth. He helped her deliver their baby girl. As Daniel was holding his daughter, Daisy took a flashlight and hit Daniel over the head with it. He was later found and taken to the hospital for his injuries inflicted by Daisy. A few days later, Daniel was released and brought home. Meanwhile, Abby was sent to rehab by her parents, Victor Newman and Ashley Abbott, in order for her to keep her mouth shut about the truth regarding Tucker McCall's accident. Upon returning to Genoa City from rehab, Abby tried to reconnect with Daniel, since they both got caught up in their own lives and grew apart. Diane Jenkins arranged for paparazzi to come to GloWorm, where Daniel and Abby were talking. Daniel thought that Abby set the entire thing up as a publicity stunt for her alter ego, the \\"Naked Heiress\\". He told her that what they had was over because he didn't want to deal with her constant need for attention. In February 2011, Daniel found out from a DNA test that Billy and Victoria Abbott's baby daughter, Lucy Abbott, was his biological child. Daisy left her baby in a safe house after she knocked Daniel out. The couple who found the baby gave it to Primrose DeVille in exchange for money. Primrose worked on the black market, selling abandoned children to couples who could afford to skip the adoption process. When Victoria found out that she could not have any more children, Billy decided to adopt a baby girl from Primrose for her, and he paid $2 million for their daughter, Lucy. Upon seeing Lucy, Daniel knew that she was his daughter, which was confirmed after the DNA test. Daniel wasn't sure whether he would let her be raised by Billy and Victoria or if he would file for custody of her. He decided in the end that it was better for Lucy to have Billy and Victoria as her parents because he saw how much that they love her. He did, however, confide in his friend and ex-wife, Lily Ashby, as they have both lost someone that they loved in a way. Being that Lily lost her husband, Cane Ashby, who faked his own death in order to protect Lily and their twins, and Daniel lost his daughter, although that choice was his own. In May 2011, Lucy and Delia Abbott, Billy's daughter with his ex-wife Chloe Mitchell, were kidnapped by Lucy's nanny, Jana Hawkes. Daniel came clean to both Billy and Victoria about being Lucy's biological father. Daniel then signed away his parental rights, despite the objections of an angry and outraged Phyllis, who wanted custody of Lucy herself, now that she knew that Billy got the baby off the black market. Daniel tried to reason with his mother that he was doing the right thing and that Lucy was with parents that love her. Phyllis, however, refused to listen to Daniel, and she vowed to fight for custody of her granddaughter. On June 17, 2011, Daisy was awarded custody of Lucy with the judge overruling the Abbott's adoption. Daniel was livid at his mother for what she did, and he disowned her. On July 7, 2011, Daniel kissed Lily at Jimmy's Bar, not knowing that Cane was watching. On August 18, 2011, Lily helped Daniel celebrate his birthday with her brother, Devon Winters, Noah Newman and his friend Hunter, and Kevin and his \\"sister\\" (Michael Baldwin's half sister who Kevin treats as a sister), Eden Baldwin, at Jimmy's Bar. Lily then took Daniel back to the Athletic Club where she rented a room for the two of them, making it clear that she wanted to pursue a romantic relationship with him. While they were half-naked and making out on the bed, Lily began to flash back to her life with Cane, and she told Daniel that she couldn't have sex with him, and she walked out. The next day, Lily went to Daniel's apartment to apologize for leading him to believe that she wanted something that she really wasn't sure that she wanted. During their heartfelt talk, the two got caught up in the moment and made love. Daniel told her that he wasn't expecting it, but it just felt right, and she agreed with him. However, Daniel hurt his budding relationship with Lily when he told her father, Neil, that Lily was allowing Cane to visit their children again. Neil then berated Lily for allowing Cane back into her life. Angered that Daniel would tattle on her to her father, she told him that she wanted him to stay away from her. Cane and Lily would later reunite, much to Daniel's dismay. On November 8, 2011 Daniel finds out from Daisy that Avery Bailey Clark is his aunt. Unhappy over Lily's decision to stay with Cane despite his warnings, Daniel turns to Eden Baldwin, who is unhappy over her former boyfriend Noah Newman not wanting to be with her anymore, as a shoulder to cry on. Both talk about their broken relationships, and their friendship becomes something more. Daniel then finds himself being a source of comfort and support to Chloe Mitchell after Kevin is forced to leave her at the altar, no thanks to a mobster's daughter named Angelina, who has a major crush on Kevin. Daniel continues to be Chloe's shoulder to cry on when she finds out that Kevin is not only back in town but also married to Angelina. Chloe goes to the party being held in their honor at Gloworm and slaps Kevin in the face, leaving him devastated. She then leaves with Daniel. Daniel, with help from Angelina, get Kevin and Chloe back together and watches them marry on March 27, 2012. Daniel then finds himself in a difficult position when he discovers that Daisy wants custody of Lucy. Phyllis evens goes as far as hiring Ricky Williams to get close to Daisy so that whatever information he gets from her can be used against her in the custody hearing. It proves, however, not to work as Daisy wins custody of Lucy, and Daniel is forced to wait six months before he can try again. Fearing for his daughter's safety, Daniel proposes to Daisy, who accepts, and the two elope. The marriage proves to be an unhappy one as Daisy is happy to finally have what she wants while Daniel is only married to her for Lucy's sake. Deeply hurt over her husband's unwillingness to love her and his mother's hatred of her, Daisy decides to team up with Ricky Williams to get him to help her and Lucy leave town. However, when Daisy turns up missing, Daniel is the prime suspect despite the fact that Ricky is the one setting him up. Daniel, despite his ill-will towards Daisy, regrets that she has died for Lucy's sake. He is forced to come to terms with the fact that his mother attempted to kill Paul and Christine in 1994. And on top of all of this, he has begun to develop new feelings for Heather, although things get complicated as she is leading the case against Phyllis. Daniel and Heather ended up kissing several times, which angered Phyllis, calling Daniel a traitor to their family. To appease the public, Daniel and Heather agreed to start dating in private. After a lengthy period of absence (which according to Christine, is because he went back to Chicago to search for Daisy, who had been residing at Fairview, very much alive, but was recently released), Daniel returned to Genoa City and announced that he and Heather would be moving with Lucy to Savannah, Georgia. Daniel made his last appearance on January 3, 2013. Daniel returned six months later, in July 2013, when Phyllis fell into a coma. He made known his intentions to take Phyllis to a facility outside of Savannah where she would be taken care of; despite resistance from Avery, Phyllis' loved ones eventually agree to let Daniel take his mother back with him to Georgia. Since then, Daniel has been mentioned infrequently whenever characters go to visit Phyllis in Georgia. Most recently, after Phyllis awoke from her coma and escaped her treatment facility, Jack Abbott called Daniel to clue him in. In August 2016, Daniel briefly returned to Genoa City to attend the engagement party of his half-sister Summer Newman and her fiance Luca Santori, before their engagement was called off when it was revealed by Victoria's boyfriend Travis Crawford that Luca was responsible for the destruction of the oil rigs owned by Newman Enterprises, and Luca was arrested for that crime and sent to prison. He also met Cassie's long-lost twin sister Mariah Copeland, and he told her of how he was involved in Cassie's death. He later also visited his old friend Kevin before he left town again to go back to Savannah, GA, and gave him advice about his rekindled relationship with Chloe and also met her daughter Bella. == See also == *Daniel and Lily == References == Category:The Young and the Restless characters Category:Television characters introduced in 1994 Category:Fictional adoptees Category:Fictional artists Category:Male characters in television ","title":"Daniel Romalotti"},{"id":"20158999","text":"The St. Mary Utility Area Historic District comprises a support area of Glacier National Park with employee housing and support buildings in the prevailing National Park Service Rustic style.

It acts as a potent and selective agonist for the nociceptin receptor, also known as the ORL-1 (opiate receptor like-1) receptor, with over 100x selectivity over other opioid receptors. It produces anxiolytic effects in animal studies equivalent to those of benzodiazepine drugs, but has no anticonvulsant effects and does not produce any overt effects on behaviour. However it does impair short-term memory, and counteracts stress-induced anorexia. It also has antitussive effects, and reduces the rewarding and analgesic effects of morphine, although it did not prevent the development of dependence. It has been shown to reduce alcohol self-administration in animals and suppressed relapses in animal models of alcoholism, and ORL-1 agonists may have application in the treatment of alcoholism. Ro64-6198 was able to be recognised as a discriminative stimulus by rats distinct from other opioid receptor ligands, but was not able to produce the conditioned place preference thought to be indicative of addictive potential. Consequently, while the role of ORL-1 receptors in the body is complex and remains poorly understood, Ro64-6198 has demonstrated multiple pharmacological actions and has been very useful in the study of the ORL-1 receptor system, especially in relation to anxiety and anorexia; however, due to poor oral bioavailability, Ro 64-6198 will most likely not be pursued clinically. Studies in primates showed it to have analgesic effects but without producing respiratory depression or reinforcing effects. == References == Category:Opioids Category:Lactams Category:Nitrogen heterocycles Category:Hoffmann-La Roche brands Category:Nociceptin receptor agonists Category:Spiro compounds ","title":"Ro64-6198"},{"id":"20159044","text":"Oleksander Barvinsky () (June 8, 1847 ‚Äì December 25, 1926) was an important western Ukrainian cultural figure and politician, a founder of the Christian Social Party in western Ukraine. He also was a member of the Austrian parliament, chaired the Shevchenko Scientific Society and held the post of secretary of education and religious affairs of the West Ukrainian National Republic. It was during his chairmanship that the Shevchenko Scientific Society was turned into a well established academy of sciences. ==Biography== Oleksander Barvinsky was born on June 8, 1847 in Shliakhnyntsi, a village near Ternopil in western Ukraine (at the time, part of Austria‚ÄìHungary), into the family of a Ukrainian Catholic priest. From 1868 he began teaching at gymnasiums (secondary schools) in western Ukraine until 1888, when he began teaching at Lviv's teacher's seminary and later the theological seminary. Collaborating with Panteleimon Kulish, Barvinsky helped create textbooks for Ukrainian schools, and was largely responsible for the use of Ukrainian orthography and for the term of Ruthenian-Ukrainian within the schools in eastern Galicia.Encyclopedia of Ukraine, \\"Oleksander Barvinsky\\" written by Elie Borschak In 1890, Barvinsky was one of the initiators of the \\"New Era\\" policy among Ukrainian political leaders, calling for rapproachment between Poles and Ukrainians. Even after most Ukrainian leaders abandoned this approach by 1894, Barvinsky along with Anatole Vakhnianyn refused to reconsider their positions and together with him formed the political party \\"Catholic Ruthenian-Social Union\\". A prominent community organizer and Ukrainophile activist, in 1891 he was elected to the Austrian parliament in Vienna, where he served until 1907. From 1894 until 1904 he was a member of the local Galician Diet. In 1917 Barvinsky became a member of the Austrian upper chamber (House of Lords). When Austria-Hungary fell apart following the First World War, Barvinsky became the minister of education and religious affairs of the West Ukrainian National Republic,State Secretariat of the Western Ukrainian National Republic retiring from political life after the Poles captured the capital of Lviv. == References Bibliography== * Small Dictionary of History of Ukraine/Chief Editor Valeriy Smoliy. \\"Lybid\\".

Dukes of Chikovani ruled a historic province, Lechkhumi in northwestern Georgia. At the end of the 17th century, General Katso Chikovani became influent in Mingrelia, a western Georgian principality. After him, his son became the ruler and assumed the dynastic name of Dadiani. ==History== After assuming control, Princes of Chikovani under the title of Dadiani moved their seat to Zugdidi, the capital of the Principality of Mingrelia, where they resided at the Dadiani Mansion till the abdication of Nikolas, Prince of Mingrelia The House of Chikovani first came to prominence after General Katzo Chikovani (d. 1682), Prince of Salipartiano, was promoted to the post of the Chief Minister at the court of Levan III of Mingrelia. As he strengthened his position among the nobles of western Georgia, General Chikovani eliminated members of many prominent houses, including those of the ruling Dadiani House. When Levan III died in 1681 without leaving a male heir, his natural son Levan IV was forced to abdicate, and General Chikovani'son took over the leadership of the Principality of Mingrelia. General Chikovani's increased power facilitated the ascent of his son George to the Mingrelian Throne. George became a ruler of the principality and after adopting the title of Dadiani became known as George IV Dadiani of Mingrelia. Beginning with George IV till Nikolas Dadiani, Prince of Mingrelia, all members of the ruling Dadiani family were by blood members of the House of Chikovani. The lineage lasted until the principality was abolished in late 1800s by the Russian Empire which took advantage of internal instability, Ottoman Invasions during the Crimean War, and a subsequent request for help from Ekaterine Dadiani, the Last Princess of Mingrelia. The Chikovani branch that remained without the ruling title of Dadiani traces its origins to General Chikovani's second son Jesse who did not assume the dynastic title. Princess Tamar now lives in New York and is an investment banker. She still has memorabilia like the Chikovani coat of arms and some ancient artillery. ==References External links == * Category:Noble families of Georgia (country) Category:European nobility Category:Families of Georgia (country) ","title":"House of Chikovani"},{"id":"20159067","text":"The George W.

The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980 for having local significance in architecture, agriculture, and settlement. ==Architecture== The house is two stories tall and is built in the Eastlake style. It has a distinctive silhouette, with multiple roof shapes, dormers, a square tower, and tall brick chimneys. The large front porch has wooden posts and balusters, with a pediment over the entrance. The exterior is embellished with stone window trim, transoms, scalloped wooden shingles in the gables, and belt courses. It was designed by prominent Minneapolis architect Charles S. Sedgwick. The house is significant for its architecture, although it is not an outstanding example of a Charles Sedgwick-designed Eastlake house when compared to other houses. (Sedgwick also designed other properties listed on the National Register, such as the George R. Newell House and Westminster Presbyterian Church in Minneapolis, and the First National Bank and the Nehemiah P. Clarke House in St. Cloud, Minnesota.) ==History== In addition to its architectural notability, the house recalls the agricultural roots of Edina. The owner, George W. Baird, moved from Pennsylvania to Minnesota in 1857 and bought a farm in the Edina Mills area. Baird was a promoter of scientific farming practices and pioneered in livestock breeding, and he is credited with bringing the first Merino sheep to Minnesota. Baird and his wife Sarah helped found the Minnehaha Grange Hall in 1873 and both served as Grange Masters there at different times. Sarah Baird also led the state Grange for 18 years. In 1936, of the farm were platted as the County Club District, which itself is listed on the National Register. The home is in an excellent state of preservation, thanks to attention from current and previous owners.

It is classified a state-controlled district road, and is part of State Route 90. The eastern section is also known as Hooker Boulevard. ==Route description== From a grade-separated interchange with the Pacific Motorway in Nerang, Nerang‚ÄìBroadbeach Road heads south-east through Carrara, parallel to the Nerang River. After , the western section of the road ends at a roundabout with Gooding Drive and Robina Parkway, near the Carrara Markets. Gooding Drive connects to the eastern part of Nerang‚ÄìBroadbeach Road, which is also known as Hooker Boulevard. This section continues through to Gold Coast Highway in Broadbeach, Queensland, Retrieved 30 March 2014 from Street-directory.com.au. over a distance of . ==History== An interchange with the Pacific Motorway opened on 29 November 1999, designed to reduce congestion and facilitate the upgrading of the then Pacific Highway to freeway standards, for an expected 60,000 vehicles per day. The $52 million interchange was predominately funded by the Commonwealth government, as part of the Pacific Highway upgrade between Brisbane and Newcastle. Widening the road to a four-lane dual carriageway, between Garden Grove and Goodings Corner, was undertaken a few years later. The public were consulted about the upgrade during the planning stage in 1998. The first stage of the project involved a new traffic light intersection at an extended Nielsens Road, which was completed by December 2001. The second phase, completed one year later, deviated Nerang‚ÄìBroadbeach Road to meet Gooding Drive at the Robina Parkway roundabout, with the previous alignment becoming a local road with on-street parking. The third section of work, at Ross Street, upgraded the intersection and duplicated the Ross Street Bridge. It commenced in September 2002, and continued through to 2003. ===Commonwealth Games=== In November 2011, the Gold Coast won the hosting rights for the 2018 Commonwealth Games, but locals were concerned about traffic infrastructure and congestion. This included along Nerang‚ÄìBroadbeach Road to the Gooding Drive roundabout. Diverting buses through residential streets was considered as part of improvements for Nerang‚ÄìBroadbeach Road, which was opposed by 396 people in petition tabled in parliament by Mermaid Beach MP Ray Stevens. In December 2011 it was revealed that public transport projects would be brought forward in time for the games, including an expanded light rail network and bus lanes along Nerang‚ÄìBroadbeach Road. By April 2012, a new shared path for bicycles and pedestrians had been constructed from west of Alaska Avenue to Bermuda Street, and cycle lanes had been marked for the section between Riverview Road and Lawrence Drive. Future projects were also planned for, to provide further cycle lanes as well as bus priority measures along various sections of the road.

TALX was acquired by Equifax Inc. in February 2007. The Work Number allows credentialed verifiers to receive immediate confirmation of an individual's employment and income for verification purposes. The fee for this information is revealed only after the requester answers several personal questions. It is used by over 50,000 organizations to verify employment data. Some organizations that use the Work Number include Fannie Mae, Hilton Hotels, Rent-A-Center, the United States Postal Service, Domino's Pizza, the University of Pennsylvania, and the University of Missouri System. Founded in 1995, The Work Number has over 225 million employment records. The Work Number is an example of outsourcing of a Human Resources department function. Additionally, the adoption of The Work Number causes a change in the financial responsibility for verification of employment. In typical organizations, the cost of a verification of employment is borne completely by the employer and the actual cost of service is absorbed into the human resource department budget. In organizations using The Work Number, the cost is borne by the requestor of verification, who purchases either a single verification or a package of multiple verifications from TALX. ==Data collected== The Work Number collects weekly salary information, which is as up to date as the last pay period and can go back many years. It also collects length of employment, job titles, \\"location information\\", and \\"other kinds of human resources- related information, such as health care provider, whether someone has dental insurance and if they‚Äôve ever filed an unemployment claim.\\" ==AdvantagesCost savings=== The service reduces the amount of time required for Human Resource departments to respond to employment verification requests. If Human Resource departments manage a large number of employees, such as universities, seasonal employers, etc. the amount of time savings and cost savings could be considerable. ===Access control=== Employees of a company or organization using The Work Number's services receive an account that is set up for them on the website. Current, and presumably, former employees can log on to The Work Number at any time. Employees cannot control access to their records by any entity or person which knows their social security number. If the employee wishes for a requestor to see his or her salary history, the employee logs on and obtains a 6-digit code, which he or she passes on to the requestor. Without that particular 6-digit code, the requestor is not allowed to view salary of the employee. Equifax advertises and sells some data to third parties. Companies including \\"mortgage, auto and other financial services credit grantors\\" may request pay rate information similar to a credit report. Also, \\"debt/collection agencies may request employment information\\" to verify someone's place of employment. ===Instant availability of records=== Additionally, as soon as the requester receives permission from an applicant to access the record, and the fee is paid (if required), it is instantly available. ===Objective nature of records=== The system reports factual information only, such as length of employment and job title. Some employers feel this reduces the risk of legal liability over the subjective content of personal references. Similarly, if an employee is concerned that a supervisor might share unfavorable information or be unwilling to verify employment, The Work Number provides some protection from this, as the system only reports objective data. It does not include performance reviews. ===Additional HR services=== The Work Number, if set up for this service by the employer, may provide duplicate copies of W-2 forms through the employee's online portal. ===Social services fee waiver=== The Work Number generally charges for verification data. However, fees are waived for Federal, State, or County Social Service Departments, who are providing benefits such as the Food Stamp program or TANF to their low-income/welfare applicants. The reports are sent by fax and may take a few days to be sent. Certain expedited services or advanced services may have fees attached. To qualify for reduced or waived fees, the agency must register with The Work Number using an official fax number. Agencies that can take advantage of this service include eligibility programs, public housing, child support enforcement, and other public assistance needs. A \\"batch service\\" for multiple requests is also available. ==Criticisms2013 sale of sensitive personal information=== In January 2013, The Work Number was criticized for selling access to people's ostensibly private data, especially salary data, to third parties, without the informed consent of the subject. Organisations affected included Columbia University, and third parties included debt collection companies. The director of policy and advocacy at the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse stated, \\"I think [this] is something that would be offensive to many people. One typically considers salary information to be shared by your employer just with IRS.\\" ===2017 exposure of Americans' salary data=== On 8 October 2017, Brian Krebs reported that The Work Number exposed the salary histories for employees of tens of thousands of U.S. companies to anyone in possession of the employee's Social Security number and date of birth. For roughly half the U.S. population, both of the latter pieces of data are known to be in possession of criminals, following Equifax's May-July 2017 security breach. ===Identity theft concerns=== Recently, internet security issues at sites that contain \\"sensitive\\" information has become a big business for hackers. Questions regarding the safety of various websites that offer services (such as The Work Number) that contain this information may be compromised by hackers (and may be a future target for hackers) and a problem for internet security officials. ===Profit motive=== The Work Number charges a fee to the requesting party for each Employment Verification. Requestors can choose a \\"pay per use\\" plan or can select a package which includes a certain number of verifications per month. Because a fee (up to $45.95 per verification) is required, this increases the financial cost of verifying an individual's employment. There is a risk this cost could be passed on to the applicant. ===Mandatory usage policies=== Some organizations are making use of The Work Number mandatory as the only way for employees or verifiers to receive information about a staffer's employment. This limits the availability of personalized, subjective, or qualitative references. It also requires a fee be paid each time a verification is required. ===Inaccurate or out of date information=== Some consumers have complained to the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse that \\"the data in its database is inaccurate,\\" or that \\"when they try to use the information for employment verification, their titles are outdated or otherwise misrepresent their work history.\\" == See also == * Equifax * Human resources * Outsourcing * TALX ==ReferencesDatabase of companies that use The Work Number Category:Economic databases Category:Business process outsourcing companies ","title":"The Work Number"},{"id":"20159131","text":"The Roes Creek Campground Camptender's Cabin, also known as the Rising Sun Campground Ranger Cabin, in Glacier National Park is an example of the National Park Service Rustic style.

He was the son of priest and politician Nicolai Wergeland, and a brother of the poet Henrik Wergeland and feminist writer Camilla Collett. His cousin was military officer Harald Nicolai Storm Wergeland. In 1859 he returned to Christianssand, where he stayed the rest of his life. ==Career== Joseph Frantz Oscar Wergeland photographed in the 1860s Wergeland became a military officer in 1834, a First Lieutenant in 1839, Lieutenant Colonel in 1866, Colonel in 1868, and Major General in 1880. Wergeland had many talents. He worked 11 years as a cartographer for the Norwegian Mapping and Cadastre Authority, where he drew the first official Norwegian county maps (the first issued was Christians Amt in 1845). He drew the first large and detailed map of Norway for use in schools. He was a teacher in drawing and calligraphy at the Norwegian Military Academy. He was orderly officer for the King. He was a member of the committee for the Hoved Line, Norway's first railway line, and several road constructions. As an eager sportsman and skier, he initiated military skiing divisions, and wrote a book about the history of skiing and its military applications. He is regarded as the founder of the sports clubs Christianssand ski- og sk√∏yteklubb (1862) and Oddersjaa (1875). A significant number of letters from the Wergeland family is preserved, largely due to Oscar, who kept the letters he received from other family members. He had a good relationship with his sister Camilla, and her articles from travels to European cities inspired his landscape work in Christianssand, as he constructed the Wergeland park and the Ravnedalen park, planted Baneheia (former grazing land) with trees by use of soldiers, and transformed several main roads into large avenues. The Wergeland Park was constructed in 1859-60. It is surrounded by many old and important buildings, such as the Cathedral (1696/1737/1885), Latinskolen (1736/1855) and the City Hall (1864).

Hart, 4th edition (New York: Oxford University Press, 1965). The poem, written in quatrains of iambic tetrameter for three lines, followed by a catalectic line of only three iambs, relates the story of a hopeless romantic who spends his days thinking about what might have been if only he had been born earlier in time. Some scholars have suggested that the character of Miniver is meant to be Robinson's self-aware skewering of his own sense of being an anachronism or throwback, but others have indicated that, while this may be true, Miniver also represents a critique of Robinson's culture in general.http://www.english.uiuc.edu/maps/poets/m_r/robinson/miniver.htm Regardless, the character portrait is similar to Robinson's Richard Cory in its presentation of a deeply discontented individual who is unable to integrate with society and is bent on self-destruction, albeit at different paces.http://litmed.med.nyu.edu/Annotation?action=view&annid;=215 Robinson's preoccupation with these sorts of characters is one of the reasons why some have dubbed him \\"America's poet laureate of unhappiness.\\"http://www.poetryfoundation.org/archive/poem.html?id=174244 ==References in popular culture== * In Woody Allen's 2011 film Midnight in Paris, the lead character Gil is compared to Miniver Cheevy by a condescending friend of his fiancee. * In Joseph Heller's Catch-22, Major Major Major Major is also compared with Miniver Cheevy because of his late birth. * Helene Hanff compared herself to Miniver Cheevy in her 1970 book 84, Charing Cross Road. * In The Gourds' song \\"All The Labor\\", one of the characters is referred to as a \\"fun lovin' Miniver Cheevy\\". http://www.metrolyrics.com/all-the-labor-lyrics- gourds.html * In Anne Rice's novel \\"The Wolf Gift\\", (published 2012) reference is made to the hero Reuben's father - \\"His private nickname for himself was \\"Miniver Cheevy\\".\\" ==External links== *Critiques of this poem ==Notes== Category:American poems Category:Works by Edwin Arlington Robinson ","title":"Miniver Cheevy"},{"id":"20159342","text":"is the fifth studio album released by the Japanese rock band Asian Kung-Fu Generation, released on November 5, 2008.

He is well known for being a Confederate brigadier general during the American Civil War and for his death during the Siege of Petersburg. ==Early life== Archibald Gracie III was born on December 1, 1832 to Archibald Gracie II (1795‚Äì1865), who married Elizabeth Davidson Bethune (d. 1864). He was born into a wealthy New York City familyHis grandfather, another Archibald Gracie, built Gracie Mansion in 1799. with interests in exporting cotton from Mobile, Alabama.Thomas McAdory Owen, Marie Bankhead Owen, History of Alabama and Dictionary of Alabama Biography, s.v. \\"Gracie, Archibald\\" reports that his mother was \\"a Miss Bethune, of Charleston, S.C.\\"; \\"Bethune\\" was also a prominent family in New York. After his elementary education, Gracie traveled to Germany for five years of further studying at the University of Heidelberg.Gerard A. Patterson's Rebels from West Point: The 306 U.S. Military Academy Graduates Who Fought for the Confederacy (2002) pg. 126. After arriving back in the United States Archibald started his education at West Point, at the time of Robert E. Lee's superintendency. Gracie came to Lee's attention when, after intentionally stepping on fellow cadet Wharton J. Green's heels while marching, he was challenged to a fight on the parade grounds. When a teacher broke up the fight, which Gracie was losing badly, Green fled, and Gracie refused to tell who he'd been fighting. Days later, Green went into Lee's office to admit his role and demand an equal punishment. Lee decided to punish neither of them, and Gracie and Green became fast friends. ==Career== After graduating in 1854, he was appointed a second lieutenant and set off as an escort to Governor Isaac Stevens, who was on the way to the Walla Walla Council of 1855.Thomas McAdory Owen and Marie Bankhead Owens' History of Alabama and Dictionary of Alabama Biography (1921) pg. 686. In 1857, Gracie resigned his post to join his father's firm, established during the 1840s in Mobile, Alabama, as agents of the London banking firm of Baring brothers. Later Gracie became the President of the Barings Bank of Mobile.Daly, Maria Lydig; Harold Earl Hammond, and Jean V. Berlin, Diary of a Union Lady, 1861-1865 (2000) pg. 33 It was here in Mobile that he joined the Washington Light Infantry and became its captain. By the orders of Governor Andrew B. Moore, Archibald and his men took the Mount Vernon Arsenal. ===Civil War service=== When Alabama seceded in 1861, Gracie enlisted in the Confederate States Army. In June 1861, he was created a major of the 11th Alabama Regiment. From March to April 1862, he commanded a small company of sharpshooters, who were some of the first to reinforce General Magruder during the Battle of Yorktown. In July of that year, Gracie was put in command of a brigade near Chattanooga, Tennessee, consisting of the 43rd Alabama Infantry, 55th Georgia Infantry, 12th Georgia Infantry, 1st Georgia Artillery, and 1st Florida Dismounted Regiment. Through his successes in Huntsville, Tennessee, he was promoted to brigadier general on November 4, 1862, at the age of 29. His company was the guard of the rear of General Bragg's army in Harrodsburg during his retreat from the Battle of Perryville, and during his retreat after the Tullahoma Campaign. General Gracie's command took an active role during the Battle of Chickamauga, where he lost over 700 men. Gracie and his unit then joined General James Longstreet's army at the Battle of Bean's Station. During this battle, Gracie was shot in the arm, causing temporary paralysis of his little and ring fingers.Welsh, Jack D., Medical Histories of Confederate Generals (1999) pg. 85 After his recovery, he was sent to Richmond to join General Beauregard. While there, he had a horse shot out from under him, but came away relatively unscathed. During the Siege of Petersburg, General Robert E. Lee was at \\"Gracie's Mortar Hell\\" inspecting Gracie's defenses. When Lee raised his head over the wall to glance at the Union position, Gracie climbed the wall in front of him. Lee then stated, \\"Why, Gracie, you will certainly be killed.\\" Gracie replied, \\"It is better, General, that I be killed than you. When you get down, I will.\\"Smith, Derek, The Gallant Dead: Union and Confederate Generals Killed in the Civil War (2005) pg. 303 ===Siege of Petersburg=== Woodlawn Cemetery, The Bronx. The fallen marker, (since restored) is the general's. Gracie grave marker, fallen off base, since has been restored Between July and December 1864, Gracie served in the trenches of Petersburg, Virginia, during the Siege of Petersburg. On December 1, Gracie's 32nd birthday, his second child, a girl, was born, and he was to take a leave to see the baby on December 3. On December 2, however, Archibald Gracie was looking out at the Union lines through his telescope when an artillery shell exploded in front of him, killing him instantly. Because of his actions at the Battle of Chickamauga, Gracie's name was put into consideration for a promotion to a major general, but his death caused the consideration to be suspended. Francis \\"Frank\\" Orray Ticknor eulogized Gracie's death in the poem \\"Gracie, of Alabama,\\" which he sent to General Robert H. Chilton.Ticknor, Francis Orray and Kate Mason Rowlands, The Poems of Frank O. Ticknor, M.D. (1879) pp. 39-40 ==Personal life== On November 19, 1856, Gracie married Josephine Mayo (1836‚Äì1901), daughter of Edward Carrington Mayo (1791‚Äì1852) and Adeline Marx (1808‚Äì1879). Josephine was the niece of General Winfield ScottBiddle, Ellen McGowan, \\"Recollections\\" (1920) pg. 20 through her father's sister, Maria D. Mayo (1789‚Äì1862). Together, the couple had a son and a daughter, who was born the day before Gracie's death. Their children included: * Archibald Gracie IV (1858‚Äì1912), the famous survivor of the Titanic. * Adeline Gracie (1864‚Äì1948) Gracie is buried in Woodlawn Cemetery in The Bronx, New York City. ==Commemorations== New York City's historic Sons of Confederate Veterans Camp, Archibald Gracie Camp #985, is named in his honor. ==See also== *List of American Civil War generals (Confederate) *Gracie Mansion *Archibald Gracie IV ==References== ;Notes ;Sources *Biddle, Ellen McGowan, \\"Recollections\\" (1920) pg. 20 *Daly, Maria Lydig; Harold Earl Hammond, and Jean V.

The buildings are part of the Church of Our Lady (Vor Frue Kirke) complex, now part of the inner city of Aarhus, but they have been repurposed. Crypt under Vor Frue Kirke, the oldest part of the church ==Early history== The exact date of the founding of Our Lady's Priory is unknown. Estimate the time have been between 1221 and 1246. Certainly by 1240 a Dominican priory was established just outside the walls of Aarhus, Jutland's largest town. The recently rediscovered crypt church beneath the choir of Vor Frue Kirke is perhaps the oldest surviving stone church in Scandinavia, dating from the reign of King Sven Estridsen (c. 1019‚Äì1076). The placement of the priory was in conjunction with the still-extant Church of Our Lady (Vor Frue Kirke) which had been built in 1080 on the site of the chapel of St Nicholas' Spring, and served as the cathedral church in Aarhus from 1180. The earlier chapel had been constructed in about 1060 when Bishop Christian arrived to organize the Diocese of Aarhus.When Aarhus Cathedral was built, the Dominicans were given the use of the old church, to which they added a new choir and sacristy; by 1250 it had become the south range of the priory. The church's Gothic nave was added in 1350 and a side aisle in 1450. The tower was added in 1500. A new altar piece was carved by Claus Berg about 1530 and may still be seen in the church today. ==Reformation in Denmark== By the time of the Reformation the four-storey priory complex had grown extensively. Denmark became officially Lutheran in 1536 with the enthusiastic support of Christian III. All religious houses and their properties became crown property. The monks were expelled from the priory and either became local residents or travelled south into countries where monks could continue their way of life. The premises stood vacant for a time until Christian III directed that the church should be administered separately from the priory, and ordered the rest of the buildings to be converted into a \\"common hospital for the sick and the poor\\" in 1541. Vor Frue Kirke became a parish church, which it remains. The buildings of the priory thus became a public hospital and a poor house, beginning a use as accommodation for the vulnerable and needy that continues into modern times. In 1888 the priory's former old chapter hall was turned into a chapel for the residents of the priory buildings, which had been turned into apartments for the elderly. In the years after World War II it was decided to restore the Vor Frue Kirke and the comprehensive work was completed in the 1950s. During the course of the restoration the crypt church was rediscovered after centuries of oblivion. The medieval crucifix, thought to have been carved in 1400, which had survived the Reformation was rehung. ==ReferencesSources== * Zwergius, Ole, nd. √Örhus Vor Frue Kloster 1239-1541. * == External links == *Vor Frue Kloster i Aarhus websitre Category:Dominican monasteries in Denmark Category:Listed buildings in Aarhus ","title":"Our Lady's Priory, Aarhus"},{"id":"20159600","text":"The Many Glacier Campground Camptender's Cabin in Glacier National Park is an example of the National Park Service Rustic style.

That building served Providence until 1810 when work began on what would become the Cathedral of St. John. The Episcopal Diocese of Rhode Island was formed in 1790, but it was not until 1929 that St John's Church was designated the Episcopal seat and was renamed the Cathedral of St. John. ==The building== 1886 engraving The cornerstone for St. John's Church was laid in 1810 and the church was dedicated in 1811. The building was designed by Federal-era architect John Holden Greene, who designed many buildings in Providence.

Zauner conjectured that analogous structures exist in complex Hilbert spaces of all finite dimensions. A symmetric, informationally complete, positive operator-valued measure (SIC-POVM) is a special case of a generalized measurement on a Hilbert space, used in the field of quantum mechanics. A measurement of the prescribed form satisfies certain defining qualities that makes it an interesting candidate for a \\"standard quantum measurement\\", utilized in the study of foundational quantum mechanics, most notably in QBism. Furthermore, it has been shown that applications exist in quantum state tomographyC. M. Caves, C. A. Fuchs, and R. Schack, ‚ÄúUnknown Quantum States: The Quantum de Finetti Representation‚Äù, J. Math. Phys. 43, 4537‚Äì4559 (2002). and quantum cryptography,C. A. Fuchs and M. Sasaki, ‚ÄúSqueezing Quantum Information through a Classical Channel: Measuring the ‚ÄòQuantumness‚Äô of a Set of Quantum States‚Äù, Quant. Info. Comp. 3, 377‚Äì404 (2003). and a possible connection has been discovered with Hilbert's twelfth problem. ==Definition== Due to the use of SIC-POVMs primarily in quantum mechanics, Dirac notation will be used throughout this article to represent elements in a Hilbert space. A POVM over a d-dimensional Hilbert space \\\\mathcal{H} is a set of m positive-semidefinite operators F = \\\\left\\\\\\\\{F_i \\\\mid i \\\\in \\\\\\\\{1, \\\\ldots, m\\\\\\\\}\\\\right\\\\\\\\} on the Hilbert space that sum to the identity: \\\\sum_{i=1}^m F_i = I. If a POVM consists of at least d^2 operators which span \\\\mathcal{L}(\\\\mathcal{H}), it is said to be an informationally complete POVM (IC-POVM). IC-POVMs consisting of exactly d^2 elements are called minimal. A set of d^2 rank-1 projectors \\\\Pi = \\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\Pi_i \\\\mid i \\\\in \\\\\\\\{1, \\\\ldots, d^2\\\\\\\\} \\\\land \\\\Pi_i^2 = \\\\Pi_i\\\\right\\\\\\\\} which have equal pairwise Hilbert‚ÄìSchmidt inner products, \\\\mathrm{Tr}\\\\left( \\\\Pi_i \\\\Pi_j \\\\right) = \\\\frac{d\\\\delta_{ij} + 1}{d + 1}, defines a minimal IC-POVM F = \\\\left\\\\\\\\{F_i \\\\mid i \\\\in \\\\\\\\{1, \\\\ldots, d^2\\\\\\\\} \\\\land F_i = \\\\frac{1}{d} \\\\Pi_i \\\\land \\\\Pi_i \\\\in \\\\Pi\\\\right\\\\\\\\} called a SIC-POVM. ==PropertiesSymmetry=== The condition that the projectors \\\\Pi_i\\\\in\\\\Pi defined above have equal pairwise inner products actually fixes the value of this constant. Recall that \\\\frac{1}{d} \\\\sum_i \\\\Pi_i = I and set \\\\mathrm{Tr}(\\\\Pi_i \\\\Pi_j ) = c. Then \\\\begin{align} d &= \\\\mathrm{Tr}(I^2) \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\frac{1}{d^2} \\\\sum_{i,j} \\\\mathrm{Tr}(\\\\Pi_i \\\\Pi_j) \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\frac{1}{d^2} \\\\left( d^2 + c d^2 (d^2-1) \\\\right) \\\\end{align} implies that c = \\\\frac{1}{d + 1}. Thus, \\\\mathrm{Tr}\\\\left( \\\\Pi_i \\\\Pi_j \\\\right) = \\\\frac{d\\\\delta_{ij} + 1}{d + 1}. This property is what makes SIC-POVMs symmetric; with respect to the Hilbert‚ÄìSchmidt inner product, any pair of elements is equivalent to any other pair. ===Superoperator=== In using the SIC-POVM elements, an interesting superoperator can be constructed, the likes of which map \\\\mathcal{B}(\\\\mathcal{H}) \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathcal{B}(\\\\mathcal{H}) . This operator is most useful in considering the relation of SIC-POVMs with spherical t-designs. Consider the map : \\\\begin{align} \\\\mathcal{G}: \\\\mathcal{B}(\\\\mathcal{H}) &\\\\rightarrow \\\\mathcal{B}(\\\\mathcal{H})\\\\\\\\\\\\ A &\\\\mapsto \\\\displaystyle \\\\sum_\\\\alpha \\\\psi_\\\\alpha \\\\rangle \\\\langle \\\\psi_\\\\alpha  A \\\\psi_\\\\alpha \\\\rangle \\\\langle \\\\psi_\\\\alpha  \\\\end{align} This operator acts on a SIC-POVM element in a way very similar to identity, in that : \\\\begin{align} \\\\mathcal{G}(\\\\Pi_\\\\beta) &= \\\\displaystyle \\\\sum_\\\\alpha \\\\Pi_\\\\alpha \\\\left \\\\langle \\\\psi_\\\\alpha  \\\\psi_\\\\beta \\\\rangle \\\\right^2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\displaystyle \\\\Pi_\\\\beta + \\\\frac{1}{d+1} \\\\sum_{\\\\alpha eq \\\\beta} \\\\Pi_\\\\alpha \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\displaystyle \\\\frac{d}{d+1} \\\\Pi_\\\\beta + \\\\frac{1}{d+1} \\\\Pi_\\\\beta + \\\\frac{1}{d+1} \\\\sum_{\\\\alpha eq \\\\beta} \\\\Pi_\\\\alpha \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\displaystyle \\\\frac{d}{d+1} \\\\Pi_\\\\beta + \\\\frac{d}{d+1}\\\\sum_\\\\alpha \\\\frac{1}{d}\\\\Pi_\\\\alpha \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\displaystyle \\\\frac{d}{d+1} \\\\left( \\\\Pi_\\\\beta + I \\\\right) \\\\end{align} But since elements of a SIC-POVM can completely and uniquely determine any quantum state, this linear operator can be applied to the decomposition of any state, resulting in the ability to write the following: : G = \\\\frac{d}{d+1} \\\\left( \\\\mathcal{I} + I \\\\right) where I(A) = A \\\\text{ and } \\\\mathcal{I}(A) = \\\\mathrm{Tr}(A)I From here, the left inverse can be calculatedC.M. Caves (1999); http://info.phys.unm.edu/~caves/reports/infopovm.pdf to be G^{-1} = \\\\frac1d \\\\left[ \\\\left(d+1\\\\right)I - \\\\mathcal{I} \\\\right], and so with the knowledge that : I=G^{-1}G = \\\\frac1d \\\\sum_\\\\alpha \\\\left[ (d+1)\\\\Pi_\\\\alpha \\\\odot \\\\Pi_\\\\alpha - I\\\\odot \\\\Pi_\\\\alpha \\\\right], an expression for a state \\\\rho can be created in terms of a quasi-probability distribution, as follows: : \\\\begin{align} \\\\rho = I  \\\\rho ) &= \\\\displaystyle \\\\sum_\\\\alpha \\\\left[ (d+1)\\\\Pi_\\\\alpha - I \\\\right] \\\\frac{ (\\\\Pi_\\\\alpha\\\\rho)}{d} \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\displaystyle \\\\sum_\\\\alpha \\\\left[ (d+1)\\\\Pi_\\\\alpha - I \\\\right] \\\\frac{ \\\\mathrm{Tr}(\\\\Pi_\\\\alpha\\\\rho)}{d} \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\displaystyle \\\\sum_\\\\alpha p_\\\\alpha \\\\left[ (d+1)\\\\Pi_\\\\alpha - I \\\\right] \\\\quad \\\\text{ where } p_\\\\alpha = \\\\mathrm{Tr}(\\\\Pi_\\\\alpha\\\\rho)/d\\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\displaystyle -I + (d+1) \\\\sum_\\\\alpha p_\\\\alpha \\\\psi_\\\\alpha \\\\rangle \\\\langle \\\\psi_\\\\alpha  \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\displaystyle \\\\sum_\\\\alpha \\\\left[ (d+1)p_\\\\alpha - \\\\frac1d \\\\right] \\\\psi_\\\\alpha \\\\rangle \\\\langle \\\\psi_\\\\alpha  \\\\end{align} where  \\\\rho ) is the Dirac notation for the density operator viewed in the Hilbert space \\\\mathcal{B} (\\\\mathcal{H}) . This shows that the appropriate quasi-probability distribution (termed as such because it may yield negative results) representation of the state \\\\rho is given by :(d+1)p_\\\\alpha - \\\\frac1d ==Finding SIC setsSimplest example=== For d=2 the equations that define the SIC-POVM can be solved by hand, yielding the vectors : \\\\begin{align} \\\\psi_1\\\\rangle &= 0\\\\rangle \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\psi_2\\\\rangle &= \\\\frac1{\\\\sqrt3}0\\\\rangle + \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac23}1\\\\rangle \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\psi_3\\\\rangle &= \\\\frac1{\\\\sqrt3}0\\\\rangle + \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac23}e^{i\\\\frac{2\\\\pi}{3}}1\\\\rangle \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\psi_4\\\\rangle &= \\\\frac1{\\\\sqrt3}0\\\\rangle + \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac23}e^{i\\\\frac{4\\\\pi}{3}}1\\\\rangle, \\\\end{align} which form the vertices of a regular tetrahedron in the Bloch sphere. The projectors that define the SIC-POVM are given by \\\\Pi_i = \\\\psi_i\\\\rangle\\\\langle\\\\psi_i. For higher dimensions this is not feasible, necessitating the use of a more sophisticated approach. ===Group covariance === General group covariance A SIC-POVM P is said to be group covariant if there exists a group G with a d^2-dimensional unitary representation such that * \\\\forall \\\\psi\\\\rangle\\\\langle \\\\psi  \\\\in P, \\\\quad \\\\forall U_g \\\\in G,\\\\quad U_g\\\\psi\\\\rangle \\\\in P * \\\\forall \\\\psi\\\\rangle\\\\langle \\\\psi , \\\\phi \\\\rangle\\\\langle \\\\phi  \\\\in P, \\\\quad \\\\exists U_g \\\\in G, \\\\quad U_g \\\\phi \\\\rangle =  \\\\psi \\\\rangle The search for SIC-POVMs can be greatly simplified by exploiting the property of group covariance. Indeed, the problem is reduced to finding a normalized fiducial vector  \\\\phi \\\\rangle such that :  \\\\langle \\\\phi  U_g  \\\\phi \\\\rangle ^2 = \\\\frac{1}{d+1} \\\\ \\\\forall g eq id . The SIC-POVM is then the set generated by the group action of U_g on \\\\phi \\\\rangle . The case of Zd √ó Zd  So far, most SIC-POVM's have been found by considering group covariance under \\\\mathbb{Z}_d \\\\times \\\\mathbb{Z}_d .Robin Blume-Kohout, Joseph M. Renes, Andrew J. Scott, Carlton M. Caves, http://info.phys.unm.edu/papers/reports/sicpovm.html To construct the unitary representation, we map \\\\mathbb{Z}_d \\\\times \\\\mathbb{Z}_d to U(d) , the group of unitary operators on d-dimensions. Several operators must first be introduced. Let e_i \\\\rangle be a basis for \\\\mathcal{H}, then the phase operator is : Te_i \\\\rangle = \\\\omega^i e_i \\\\rangle where \\\\omega = e^{\\\\frac{2\\\\pi i}{d}} is a root of unity and the shift operator as : Se_i \\\\rangle = e_{i+1 \\\\pmod{d}} \\\\rangle Combining these two operators yields the Weyl operator W(p,q) = S^p T^q which generates the Heisenberg-Weyl group. This is a unitary operator since : \\\\begin{align} W(p,q) W^\\\\dagger (p,q) &= S^p T^q T^{-q} S^{-p} \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= Id \\\\end{align} It can be checked that the mapping (p,q) \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z}_d \\\\times \\\\mathbb{Z}_d \\\\rightarrow W(p,q) is a projective unitary representation. It also satisfies all of the properties for group covariance, and is useful for numerical calculation of SIC sets. ===Zauner's conjecture=== Given some of the useful properties of SIC-POVMs, it would be useful if it was positively known whether such sets could be constructed in a Hilbert space of arbitrary dimension. Originally proposed in the dissertation of Zauner,G. Zauner, Quantendesigns ‚Äì Grundz√ºge einer nichtkommutativen Designtheorie. Dissertation, Universit√§t Wien, 1999. http://www.gerhardzauner.at/documents/gz-quantendesigns.pdf a conjecture about the existence of a fiducial vector for arbitrary dimensions was hypothesized. More specifically, > For every dimension d\\\\geq 2 there exists a SIC-POVM whose elements are the > orbit of a positive rank-one operator E_0 under the Weyl-Heisenberg group > H_d . What is more, E_0 commutes with an element T of the Jacobi group > J_d=H_d \\\\rtimes SL(2,\\\\mathbb{Z}_d). The action of T on H_d modulo the center > has order three. Utilizing the notion of group covariance on \\\\mathbb{Z}_d \\\\times \\\\mathbb{Z}_d , this can be restated as > For any dimension d \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N} , let \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ k \\\\right\\\\\\\\}_{k=0}^{d-1} > be an orthonormal basis for \\\\mathbb{C}^d , and define : \\\\displaystyle > \\\\omega = e^{\\\\frac{2\\\\pi i}{d}}, \\\\quad \\\\quad D_{j,k} = \\\\omega^{\\\\frac{jk}{2}} > \\\\sum_{m=0}^{d-1}\\\\omega^{jm}  k+m\\\\pmod{d} \\\\rangle \\\\langle m  Then \\\\exists > \\\\phi \\\\rangle \\\\in \\\\mathbb{C}^d such that the set \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ D_{j,k} \\\\phi > \\\\rangle \\\\right\\\\\\\\}_{j,k=1}^d is a SIC-POVM ===Partial results=== Algebraic and analytical results for finding SIC sets have been shown in the limiting case where the dimension of the Hilbert space is d=2,\\\\dots,21,24,28,30,31,35,37,39,43,48 .A.

PhD thesis University of Auckland (2015); https://www.math.auckland.ac.nz/~waldron/Tuan/Thesis.pdf Furthermore, using the Heisenberg group covariance on \\\\mathbb{Z}_d\\\\times \\\\mathbb{Z}_d , numerical solutions have been found for all integers up through d=151 . The proof for the existence of SIC-POVMs for arbitrary dimensions remains an open question, but is an ongoing field of research in the quantum information community. ==Relation to spherical t-designs== A spherical t-design is a set of vectors S=\\\\left\\\\\\\\{  \\\\phi_k \\\\rangle : \\\\phi_k \\\\rangle \\\\in \\\\mathbb{S}^d \\\\right\\\\\\\\} on the d-dimensional generalized hypersphere, such that the average value of any t^{th}-order polynomial f_t(\\\\psi) over S is equal to the average of f_t(\\\\psi) over all normalized vectors  \\\\psi \\\\rangle . Defining \\\\mathcal{H}_t = \\\\displaystyle \\\\bigotimes_{i=1}^t \\\\mathcal{H} as the t-fold tensor product of the Hilbert spaces, and : S_t = \\\\displaystyle \\\\sum_{k=1}^n  \\\\Phi_k^t \\\\rangle \\\\langle \\\\Phi_k^t  , \\\\quad \\\\Phi_k^t\\\\rangle = \\\\phi_k\\\\rangle^{\\\\otimes t} as the t-fold tensor product frame operator, it can be shown that a set of normalized vectors \\\\left\\\\\\\\{  \\\\phi_k \\\\rangle \\\\in \\\\mathbb{S}^d \\\\right\\\\\\\\}_{k=1}^n with n \\\\geq {t+d-1 \\\\choose d-1} forms a spherical t-design if and only if :: \\\\displaystyle \\\\mathrm{Tr}\\\\left[ S_t^2 \\\\right] = \\\\sum_{j,k} \\\\left \\\\langle \\\\phi_j  \\\\phi_k \\\\rangle \\\\right^{2t} = \\\\frac{n^2 t! (d-1)!}{(t+d-1)!} It then immediately follows that every SIC- POVM is a 2-design, since : \\\\mathrm{Tr}(S^2_2) = \\\\displaystyle \\\\sum_{j,k} \\\\langle \\\\phi_j \\\\phi_k \\\\rangle ^4 = \\\\frac{2d^3}{d+1} which is precisely the necessary value that satisfies the above theorem. ==Relation to MUBs == In a d-dimensional Hilbert space, two distinct bases \\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\psi_i\\\\rangle \\\\right\\\\\\\\}, \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\phi_j \\\\rangle \\\\right\\\\\\\\} are said to be mutually unbiased if : \\\\displaystyle \\\\langle \\\\psi_i  \\\\phi_j \\\\rangle^2 = \\\\frac{1}{d}, \\\\quad \\\\forall i,j This seems similar in nature to the symmetric property of SIC- POVMs. Wootters points out that a complete set of d+1 unbiased bases yields a geometric structure known as a finite projective plane, while a SIC-POVM (in any dimension that is a prime power) yields a finite affine plane, a type of structure whose definition is identical to that of a finite projective plane with the roles of points and lines exchanged. In this sense, the problems of SIC-POVMs and of mutually unbiased bases are dual to one another. In dimension d = 3, the analogy can be taken further: a complete set of mutually unbiased bases can be directly constructed from a SIC-POVM. The 9 vectors of the SIC- POVM, together with the 12 vectors of the mutually unbiased bases, form a set that can be used in a Kochen‚ÄìSpecker proof. However, in 6-dimensional Hilbert space, a SIC-POVM is known, but no complete set of mutually unbiased bases has yet been discovered, and it is widely believed that no such set exists. ==See also== * Measurement in quantum mechanics * Mutually unbiased bases * POVM * QBism ==References == Category:Quantum measurement Category:Quantum mechanics ","title":"SIC-POVM"},{"id":"20159702","text":"The Swiftcurrent Ranger Station is an example of the Swiss Chalet style that prevailed in the early years of Glacier National Park, before the establishment of the similar National Park Service Rustic style.

Critics of China's stimulus package have blamed it for causing a surge in Chinese debt since 2009, particularly among local governments and state-owned enterprises. The economic stimulus plan was seen as a success and while China's economic growth dipped sharply to almost 6% during 4Q 2008 and 1Q 2009 it had recovered to over 8% in Q2 2009 and over 10% in Q3 2009. The World Bank subsequently went on to recommend similar public works spending campaigns to western governments experiencing the effects of the financial crisis but the U.S. and EU instead decided to pursue long-term policies of quantitative easing (the buying of trillions of dollars worth of government bonds or other financial assets in order to stimulate the economy and increase liquidity). ==Announcement== A statement on the government's website said the State Council had approved a plan to invest 4 trillion yuan in infrastructure and social welfare by the end of 2010. This stimulus, equivalent to US$586 billion, represented a pledge comparable to that subsequently announced by the United States, but which came from an economy only one third the size.Can China Manage Its Economy? The stimulus package will be invested in key areas such as housing, rural infrastructure, transportation, health and education, environment, industry, disaster rebuilding, income-building, tax cuts, and finance. China's export driven economy started to feel the impact of the economic slowdown in the United States and Europe, and the government had already cut key interest rates three times in less than two months in a bid to spur economic expansion. The stimulus package was welcomed by world leaders and analysts as larger than expected and a sign that by boosting its own economy, China is helping to stabilize the world economy. World Bank President Robert Zoellick declared that he was 'delighted' and believed that China was 'well positioned given its current account surplus and budget position to have fiscal expansion.' News of the announcement of the stimulus package sent markets up across the world. ==Details2008=== On the 15 of November, 2008, it was revealed that the central government would only provide 1.2 trillion yuan of funds. The rest of the funds will be reallocated from the budget of provincial and local governments. Chinese banking officials were reportedly considering establishing a fund worth between 600 billion and 800 billion yuan to purchase domestic shares listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange, particularly those in the Shanghai Composite, in the event the Shanghai Index fell to 1,500 points. ===2009=== On March 6, 2009, China's National Development and Reform Commission' announced a revision of the stimulus and published a breakdown of how the funds would be distributed. Public infrastructure development took up the biggest portion ‚Äì 1.5 trillion yuan, or nearly 38% of the total package. The projects lined up include railway, road, irrigation, and airport construction. The second largest allocation ‚Äì one trillion yuan ‚Äì went to reconstruction works in regions hit by the 8-magnitude Sichuan earthquake in May 2008; that was followed by funding for social welfare plans, including the construction of low-cost housing, rehabilitation of slums, and other social safety net projects. Rural development and technology advancement programs shared the same amount of allocation ‚Äì at 370 billion yuan each. Rural projects in the pipeline included building public amenities, resettling nomads, supporting agriculture works, and providing safe drinking water. Technology advancement mainly targeted at upgrading the Chinese industrial sector, gearing towards high-end production to move away from the current export-oriented and labor-intensive mode of growth. This was in line with the government's latest blueprint for revitalizing 10 selected industries. To ensure sustainable development, the Chinese government also allocated some 210 billion yuan, or 5.3% of the stimulus package for promoting energy saving and gas emission cuts, and environmental engineering projects. Finally, 150 billion yuan was allocated for educational, cultural and family planning purposes. One year later, these programs seem to have been even more successful than expected, so that on November 4, 2009, the World Bank group enhanced its \\"prognosis\\" of the Chinese GDP, by +1.2%, to a value of +8.4%.\\"Prognosis\\" of the 'world bank group' for the 2009 chinese GDP from Nov. 4, 2009, , resulting in a plus of +8.4 %, instead of the former value of +7.6 %. ===2010=== China's economic growth was sustained by the economic stimulus and in addition, assisted neighboring countries with the economic recovery in 2010.By MICHAEL S.

It is commonly used as the speed control mode of the governor of a prime mover driving a synchronous generator connected to an electrical grid. It works by controlling the rate of power produced by the prime mover according to the grid frequency. With droop speed control, when the grid is operating at maximum operating frequency, the prime mover's power is reduced to zero, and when the grid is at minimum operating frequency, the power is set to 100%, and intermediate values at other operating frequencies. This mode allows synchronous generators to run in parallel, so that loads are shared among generators with the same droop curve in proportion to their power rating. In practice, the droop curves that are used by generators on large electrical grids are not necessarily linear or the same, and may be adjusted by operators. This permits the ratio of power used to vary depending on load, so for example, base load generators will generate a larger proportion at low demand. Stability requires that over the operating frequency range the power output is a monotonically decreasing function of frequency. Droop speed control can also be used by grid storage systems. With droop speed control those systems will remove energy from the grid at higher than average frequencies, and supply it at lower frequencies. ==Linear== The frequency of a synchronous generator is given by :F = \\\\frac{PN}{120} where * F, frequency (in Hz), * P, number of poles, * N, speed of generator (in RPM) The frequency (F) of a synchronous generator is directly proportional to its speed (N). When multiple synchronous generators are connected in parallel to electrical grid, the frequency is fixed by the grid, since individual power output of each generator will be small compared to the load on a large grid. Synchronous generators connected to the grid run at various speeds but they all run at the same frequency because they differ in the number of poles (P). A speed reference as percentage of actual speed is set in this mode. As the generator is loaded from no load to full load, the actual speed of the prime mover tends to decrease. In order to increase the power output in this mode, the prime mover speed reference is increased. Because the actual prime mover speed is fixed by the grid, this difference in speed reference and actual speed of the prime mover is used to increase the flow of working fluid (fuel, steam, etc.) to the prime mover, and hence power output is increased. The reverse will be true for decreasing power output. The prime mover speed reference is always greater than actual speed of the prime mover. The actual speed of the prime mover is allowed to \\"droop\\" or decrease with respect to the reference, and so the name. For example, if the turbine is rated at 3000 rpm, and the machine speed reduces from 3000 rpm to 2880 rpm when it is loaded from no load to base load, then the droop % is given by :\\\\mathrm{Droop\\\\%} = \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{No\\\\ load\\\\ speed - Full\\\\ load\\\\ speed}}{\\\\mathrm{No\\\\ load\\\\ speed}} := (3000 ‚Äì 2880) / 3000 := 4% In this case, speed reference will be 104% and actual speed will be 100%. For every 1% change in the turbine speed reference, the power output of the turbine will change by 25% of rated for a unit with a 4% droop setting. Droop is therefore expressed as the percentage change in (design) speed required for 100% governor action. As frequency is fixed on the grid, and so actual turbine speed is also fixed, the increase in turbine speed reference will increase the error between reference and actual speed. As the difference increases, fuel flow is increased to increase power output, and vice versa. This type of control is referred to as \\"straight proportional\\" control. If the entire grid tends to be overloaded, the grid frequency and hence actual speed of generator will decrease. All units will see an increase in the speed error, and so increase fuel flow to their prime movers and power output. In this way droop speed control mode also helps to hold a stable grid frequency. The amount of power produced is strictly proportional to the error between the actual turbine speed and speed reference. It can be mathematically shown that if all machines synchronized to a system have the same droop speed control, they will share load proportionate to the machine ratings.William D. Stevenson, Jr. Elements of Power System Analysis Third Edition,McGraw-Hill, New York (1975) page 378-379 For example, how fuel flow is increased or decreased in a GE-design heavy duty gas turbine can be given by the formula, FSRN = (FSKRN2 * (TNR-TNH)) + FSKRN1 Where, FSRN = Fuel Stroke Reference (Fuel supplied to Gas Turbine) for droop mode TNR = Turbine Speed Reference TNH = Actual Turbine Speed FSKRN2 = Constant FSKRN1 = Constant The above formula is nothing but the equation of a straight line (y = mx + b). Multiple synchronous generators having equal % droop setting connected to a grid will share the change in grid load in proportion of their base load. For stable operation of the electrical grid of North America, power plants typically operate with a four or five percent speed droop. By definition, with 5% droop the full-load speed is 100% and the no-load speed is 105%. Normally the changes in speed are minor due to inertia of the total rotating mass of all generators and motors running on the grid. Adjustments in power output for a particular primer mover and generator combination are made by slowly raising the droop curve by increasing the spring pressure on a centrifugal governor or by an engine control unit adjustment, or the analogous operation for an electronic speed governor. All units to be connected to a grid should have the same droop setting, so that all plants respond in the same way to the instantaneous changes in frequency without depending on outside communication.Speed Droop and Power Generation. Application Note 01302. 2. Woodward. Speed Contiguous United States power transmission grid consists of 300,000 km of lines operated by 500 companies. Next to the inertia given by the parallel operation of synchronous generators,VSYNC-Project the frequency speed droop is the primary instantaneous parameter in control of an individual power plant's power output (kW). ==See also== * Electric power transmission * Wide area synchronous grid * Dynamic demand (electric power) ==ReferencesFurther reading== * Alfred Engler: Applicability of droops in low voltage grids.

A former player and coach, he is the only broadcaster ejected from an NBA game. ==BiographyPlaying career=== A basketball player at Duquesne University, Rice earned an All-American honorable mention selection his senior year, leading his Dukes to the 1962 NIT tournament. During the semifinals in which Duquesne was defeated by the St. John's Red Storm Rice became involved in a fight with Donnie Burks that lasted at least a minute. As spectators at Madison Square Garden became involved it was broken up by the New York City Police Department. No one was injured and the referees did not call fouls on either Rice or Burks. The Associated Press described the event as a \\"lively brawl\\". Although the NBA was calling and the Detroit Pistons selected him in the eighth round of the 1962 NBA draft,1962 NBA Draft on Basketballreference.com Rice decided that his skills could be better utilized from an educational standpoint and opted for a career in coaching. ===Coaching career=== Rice coached for 13 years at the high school level, posting a career record of 245‚Äì71, before moving to college coaching in 1977 when he accepted a position as an assistant coach at Duquesne. He was named the head coach of Duquesne for the 1978‚Äì79 season and over his four-year tenure he amassed a record of 62‚Äì49, garnering two berths in the National Invitation Tournament and twice being named Eastern Eight Coach of the Year. Rice then moved to Youngstown State University, where he coached for five years, from 1982‚Äì83 through 1986‚Äì87. During this period the Penguins twice finished second in the Ohio Valley Conference, peaking with a high of 19 victories in the 1984‚Äì85 season. The team amassed 75 wins against 67 losses during the Mike Rice years.\\"History and Records,\\" Youngstown State University, page 2.

Rice worked games as primary analyst for the Western Athletic Conference. From 1989 he also worked with SportsChannel America as its primary analyst for World Basketball League broadcasts. Rice moved to the team-owned broadcasting operations of the Portland Trail Blazers in 1991. Rice was chosen by longtime voice of the Blazers Bill Schonely following a four-person tryout at the Blazers' 1991 Slam 'n' Jam held at Civic Stadium, organized by Blazer team president Marshall Glickman. Rice bested former Oregon State University guard Mark Radford, ex- Blazers assistant coach Jack McKinney, and retired NBA referee Earl Strom in the tryout, which gave each a quarter of the game to work alongside Schonely. While Rice started as part of the radio team, since the 2006‚Äì07 season he has worked with play-by-play announcer Mike Barrett providing color commentary for the television broadcast.

W. Bush, and an attorney in Chicago. She also was considered by President Richard Nixon as a possible nominee to the Supreme Court of the United States. ==Early life and education== Born in Chicago as Jewel Carter Stradford, she was the daughter of noted attorney and co-founder of the National Bar Association, C. Francis Stradford, and Aida Arabella Stradford. She was a descendant of the 19th century American artisan, Scipio Vaughan and his wife, Maria Conway from whom she acquired Yoruba Nigerian, Cherokee and Scottish ancestries. Jewel earned a bachelor's degree in political science from Oberlin College in 1943. While at Oberlin College, Jewel was captain of the volleyball team and a member of the Musical Union, Forensic Union, Cosmopolitan Club, and many other activities. Jewel began law school in 1943 and was the only African-American woman in her class. In 1946, she was the first African American woman to graduate from the University of Chicago Law School. ==Professional career== In 1947, she was admitted to the Illinois State Bar. The same year, Jewel became a trial lawyer for the Legal Aid Bureau of Chicago, now Legal Aid Society of Metropolitan Family Services. She formed a law firm in Chicago in 1949 with her first husband, John W. Rogers Sr. In 1955, President Dwight Eisenhower appointed Jewel as an assistant U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Illinois. She served in that role until 1958. In July 1960, she was a delegate to the Republican National Convention. She gave the seconding speech for Nixon's nomination to be the Republican candidate for President during the 1960 Presidential election. In 1961, she started a new law firm in Chicago with her father and second husband called Stradford, Lafontant and Lafontant. In 1963, she became the first black woman to argue a case before the Supreme Court of the United States. Her case, Beatrice Lynumn v. The State of Illinois set the precedent for the landmark Miranda v. Arizona case in 1966. She ran unsuccessfully for Illinois judicial elections in 1962 and 1970. In 1972, she was a delegate-at-large to the Republican National Convention. She sat on many corporate and non-profits boards, including the boards of Jewel Companies, Trans World Airlines, Mobil Corporation, Revlon, the Illinois Humane Society, Howard University, and Oberlin College. ==Work in the Nixon administration== In 1969, Nixon tapped her to serve as vice chairman of the U.S. Advisory Commission on International, Educational and Cultural Affairs. In 1972, Nixon appointed Jewel to serve as a representative to the General Assembly of the United Nations. In 1973, Nixon appointed Jewel to be the first-ever female Deputy Solicitor General. She left the Nixon administration in 1975 to return to practicing law in Chicago, which she continued to do until 1989. ==Work in the George H. W. Bush administration== She was admitted to the D.C. Court of Appeals in 1985. From 1989 until 1993, Jewel held the title of Ambassador-at- Large and was the U.S. Coordinator for Refugee Affairs while in the administration of President George H. W. Bush. Jewel traveled extensively during this time all over the world. She made a yearly recommendation to President Bush about the number of refugees that should be admitted to the United States. She succeeded Jonathan Moore in this position. After Bush lost his reelection campaign, Jewel returned to Chicago to continue practicing law until her death in 1997. ==Consideration for nomination to the Supreme Court and to an appeals court== In his book Witness to Power, John Ehrlichman wrote that Nixon was \\"intrigued\\" with the idea of nominating Lafontant to the Supreme Court. Nixon also considered nominating Lafontant to an appeals-court post, but the American Bar Association found her to be unqualified, according to Sheldon Goodman's book Picking Federal Judges, and Nixon dropped the idea. ==Personal life== Jewel Stradford married John W. Rogers Sr., a former member of the Tuskegee Airmen during World War II, on December 7, 1946; they had one child, investment executive John W. Rogers Jr. (born 1958). The couple divorced in 1961. She remarried, to Haitian-American attorney H. Ernest Lafontant in 1961, and remained married to him until his death in October 1976. She married Naguib Soby Mankarious in 1989 and was married to him until her death in 1997. She received a Candace Award for Distinguished Service from the National Coalition of 100 Black Women in 1983. ==Death== Jewel Stradford Lafontant-Mankarious died of breast cancer at her home in Chicago on May 31, 1997, aged 75. ==See also== * Richard Nixon judicial appointment controversies ==References== Category:1922 births Category:1997 deaths Category:20th-century American lawyers Category:African-American women lawyers Category:Deaths from breast cancer Category:Delta Sigma Theta members Category:Illinois Republicans Category:Lawyers from Chicago Category:Nixon administration personnel Category:Oberlin College alumni Category:Place of death missing Category:University of Chicago Law School alumni Category:Vaughan family (Lagos) Category:American people of Yoruba descent Category:American people of Nigerian descent Category:American people of Cherokee descent Category:Yoruba legal professionals Category:American people of Scottish descent Category:20th-century American women lawyers ","title":"Jewel Lafontant"},{"id":"20159808","text":"Karel Lambert (born 1928) is an American philosopher and logician at the University of California, Irvine and the University of Salzburg.

Free logic itself is an adjustment of a given standard predicate logic such as to relieve it of existential assumptions, and so make it a free logic. Taking Bertrand Russell's predicate logic in his Principia Mathematica as standard, one replaces universal instantiation, \\\\forall x \\\\,\\\\phi x \\\\rightarrow \\\\phi y, with universal specification (\\\\forall x \\\\,\\\\phi x \\\\land E!y \\\\,\\\\phi y) \\\\rightarrow \\\\phi z. Thus universal statements, like \\"All men are mortal,\\" or \\"Everything is a unicorn,\\" do not presuppose that there are men or that there is anything. These would be symbolized, with the appropriate predicates, as \\\\forall x\\\\,(Mx \\\\rightarrow Lx) and \\\\forall x\\\\, Ux, which in Principia Mathematica entail \\\\exists x\\\\,(Mx \\\\land Lx) and \\\\exists x\\\\,Ux, but not in free logic.

It runs between the town of Cupids and the city of St. John's. ==Route description== Route 60 begins as Topsail Road at the west end of Water Street in downtown St. John's, where the road divides into Topsail Road and Waterford Bridge Road. It continues on through the west end of St. John's, then through the northern part of the city of Mount Pearl. After the overpass of Kenmount Road, the road passes through the towns of Paradise, Topsail, and Chamberlains. After reaching the town of Manuels, Route 60 becomes the Conception Bay Highway, continuing through Conception Bay South, Holyrood, Marysvale, Brigus and ending at the intersection of Route 70 in the town of Cupids. Within Mount Pearl and St. John's, Topsail Road is a major arterial road and commercial area. Two shopping malls, Mount Pearl Square and the Village Shopping Centre, are located on the road, as well as a number of strip malls, fast-food restaurants, other businesses, and residential properties. Once out of the city, Route 60 also runs along the side of Conception Bay through many small rural communities. Route 60 was the main route for many people who live outside St. Johns area to travel into the city before Route 1 (TCH) was constructed. East of its intersection with Cornwall Avenue, Topsail Road narrows to two lanes. The section from Cornwall Avenue to Water Street is often referred to as Old Topsail Road, although this is not its official name. A large portion of the annual Tely 10 road race traces Route 60 eastbound through Paradise, Mount Pearl, and St. John's. ==Communities along Route 60== *Cupids *Cupids Crossing *Brigus *Georgetown *Marysvale *Colliers *Conception Harbour *Ballyhack *Middle Arm *Avondale *Harbour Main-Chapel's Cove-Lakeview *Holyrood *Conception Bay South *Paradise *Mount Pearl *St. John's ==Major intersectionsReferences== 060 Category:Conception Bay South Category:Mount Pearl Category:Streets in St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador ","title":"Newfoundland and Labrador Route 60"},{"id":"20159996","text":"The Sonoma orogeny was a period of mountain building in western North America. The exact age and structure of the Sonoma orogeny is controversial. The orogeny is generally thought to have occurred during the Permian / Triassic transition, around 250 million years ago, following the Late Devonian Antler orogeny. The Sonoma orogeny was one of a sequence of accretionary events along the Cordilleran margin, possibly caused by the closure of the basin between the island arc of Sonomia and the North American continent. Evidence of this event has been reported throughout western North America, but most distinctly in northwest Nevada. The orogeny was named by Silberling and Roberts, who identified it with the Havallah Formation, originally thought to date to the Pennsylvanian and Permian ages but has since been revised to include rocks of Late Devonian and Mississippian age. Some geologists dispute whether convergent plate tectonics produced the Sonoma orogeny. ==Stratigraphy== The Havallah sequence is the informal name for sequence including the Havallah Formation and other related strata. The Havallah sequence is universally associated with the Sonoma orogeny, but units of the same age range and roughly the same lithic composition, along the western and northern margins of the Havallah, are also relevant. These units include the Inskip Formation in the East Range and a series of formations in the Hot Springs Range. These units consist of basalt, felsite, bedded chert, limestone, and detrital rocks ranging from conglomerate to argillite that accumulated in a trough west of the Antler orogenic belt. The Havallah sequence is underlain by the Golconda thrust, and is therefore a component of the Golconda allochthon. Speed observed that there are no arc-derived sedimentary rocks in the Golconda allochthon. ==Theories== Dickinson expanded the reach of the Sonoma orogeny as follows: segments of accreted Permian island arcs, composed of volcanic and volcaniclastic strata and paired geotectonically with Sonoma accretionary prisms to the east, are present in the Klamath-Sierran region of the Cordilleran orogen to the south of volcanic cover in the Pacific Northwest. Burchfiel and Davis presented a detailed model relating the Sonoma orogeny to convergent plate tectonic processes. They postulated an east-dipping subduction zone beneath a magmatic arc to the west of the continent. In this scheme, a back-arc basin floored by oceanic crust lay between the arc and the continent. The Sonoma orogeny involved closure of this basin and a process by which the blanket of oceanic sedimentary rocks (the Havallah sequence) was obducted onto the continental shelf via the Golconda thrust. To account for the absence of oceanic crust in the obducted rocks, Davis later proposed the unique concept that the Havallah was separated from the underlying oceanic crust by a process of subduction and obduction. Silberling presented a model similar to that of Burchfiel and Davis Miller and others found that the Schoonover sequence, a northern correlative of the Havallah sequence, was compatible with a back-arc thrusting model for the Sonoma orogeny. Speed offered a distinctly different model involving a volcanic arc above a west- dipping subduction zone to the west of the continent. In this model, an expanse of oceanic crust subducted westward under the volcanic arc, causing the overlying sedimentary rocks of the Havallah sequence to be scraped off the descending plate and forced over the approaching continental slope. Snyder and Brueckner supported the Speed model with detailed lithic descriptions of the Havallah. They interpreted the lithic composition of the Havallah to be the sedimentary floor of an extensive ocean basin. Brueckner and Snyder expressed some uncertainty about the exact time of final emplacement of the allochthon, but emphasized that structures associated with the Sonoma orogeny had a long history from the middle Paleozoic to the Permian-Triassic periods. ===Controversy and new ideas=== Stewart and others revisited the classic Havallah locality at China Mountain in the Tobin Range, making use of a large number of fossil collections. This locality had been cited by Silberling and Roberts as displaying the best evidence for the existence of the Sonoma orogeny, having been tightly folded and thrust-faulted and overlain unconformably by the Triassic Koipato Formation. However, according to Stewart and others, the Havallah at that location is not tightly folded but is composed of nearly homoclinal strata separated by numerous undated faults sub- parallel to bedding. Stewart and others also cast some doubt as to the nature of the contact with the overlying Koipato Formation indicating on their map of the area that it could be a fault. In the East Range just to the west of China Mountain, Whitebread mapped the contact between strata of Permian age, at the top of the Havallah, and the base of the overlying Koipato as parallel, indicating a lack of evidence for an orogeny at the Permian-Triassic boundary. Ketner, in a complete reversal of the conventional concepts of the Sonoma orogeny, combined all similar deep-water Upper Devonian to Permian sequences in the area of the type Havallah sequence into a single genetic assemblage. Ketner concluded that Paleozoic deposits were compressed in the Jurassic, with the east-verging Golconda thrust in the east, and west-verging thrusts in western parts of the depositional basin. Ketner's work denied the oceanic origin of the Havallah and related sequences, eliminated the necessity for convergent plate tectonics and a far-traveled allochthon, established the age of the Golconda thrust as post-Triassic, and cast doubt on the very existence of the Sonoma orogeny. ==References== Category:Orogenies of North America Category:Events in the geological history of Earth Category:Permian orogenies Category:Triassic orogenies ","title":"Sonoma orogeny"},{"id":"20159999","text":"Kenmount Road is a major road in St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador. It begins at the intersection of Freshwater Road and Thorburn Road, just east of the Columbus Drive overpass. Originally passing through rural farmland, Kenmount Road is now a significant commercial area, with the Avalon Mall at its eastern end, followed by a series of car dealerships, restaurants, hotels, and other businesses. At its western end, Kenmount Road intersects Topsail Road and the Trans-Canada Highway, and has been extended into the Town of Paradise, where it runs into another road, McNamara Drive. O'Leary Industrial Park is located just north of Kenmount Road, with access via Pippy Place and Peet Street. Further west, past the intersection with the Team Gushue Highway, lies the Kelsey Drive big-box retail area. West of Kelsey Drive, the new Kenmount Terrace subdivision is currently under development. The Trans-Canada Highway originally continued down Kenmount Road, prior to the construction of the Outer Ring Road in the 1990s, which diverted the highway onto a new alignment across the north of the city. The overpass that carries Kenmount Road (originally the Trans-Canada Highway) over Topsail Road holds a special place in the province. One of the first highway interchanges constructed in the province, it has come to represent the boundary between the St. John's urban region and the remainder of the island.

Market NBSK is produced mainly in Canada and the Nordic countries. Some NBSK is also produced in north-western United States and in Russia. NBSK futures are traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. ==Properties== This pulp grade is very diverse. All NBSK pulps have long fibers and is often used as reinforcement pulp. NBSK from British Columbia is mainly from Lodgepole Pine, with a significant amount of White Spruce. Redcedar, douglas fir, hemlock, and larch make up a smaller portion of the chip furnish. NBSK is known for having longer fiber lengths and larger fiber diameter than anywhere else in the world due to very long growing season and mild climate. NBSK from Siberia is made from pine, spruce and european larch and tend to be shorter and thinner than other NBSK pulps due to the short growing season. The larch makes up about 15% of the wood furnish and gives a rather coarse fiber that makes Siberian NBSK less desirable as reinforcement pulp. The only single species NBSK is of plantation Radiata pine from New Zealand, Brazil and Chile. It has good brightness and cleanliness that is appreciated in printing and writing papers. NBSK from Scandinavia is only from scots pine and norway spruce in the normal mix 7:3. The mix might vary much with the season as norway spruce grows on wetter lands that is easier accessed in the winter when the ground is frozen. ==Applications== The most common use of NBSK is as reinforcement fibres when making paper or as raw material for kraft paper.

He batted left-handed, threw right-handed, weighed 210 pounds and was . Garibaldi was born in Stockton, California, and attended Stagg High School and then the Santa Clara University, with whom he won the 1962 College World Series Most Outstanding Player award. He is the only player from Santa Clara University to ever win that award. He also set two records in that Series: a strikeout record (38 strikeout) and an innings-pitched record (27 innings pitched). Although Casey Stengel of the New York Mets tried to convince Garibaldi to sign with them (he even left a game early to travel to Stockton, California, to try to persuade Garibaldi), Garibaldi chose not to sign with the Mets. Instead, he signed with the Giants. After signing with the San Francisco Giants for a record bonus of $150,000, Garibaldi jumped straight from college to the major leagues, making his big league debut on July 15, 1962. Facing the New York Mets, he pitched a perfect inning in his debut, striking out one batter. He would pitch nine games in 1962, going 0‚Äì0 with a 5.11 ERA. He was the ninth youngest player in 1962. In 1963, Garibaldi went 0‚Äì1 with a 1.13 ERA in four games. He would not pitch in the majors again until 1966. In 1966, he appeared in one game, pitching a near-perfect inning of work, allowing a single hit. He'd have to wait until 1969 to play in the big leagues again. Once again, he appeared in only one game, making the only start of his career. Despite pitching five solid innings and posting an ERA of 1.80, he still lost the game because his defense allowed three unearned runs (he allowed four runs total). He played his final major league game on October 1. Although his big league career was over, his professional career was not. He continued to pitch in the Giants organization until the end of the 1970 season. He was traded to the Kansas City Royals on October 19, 1970 for Fran Healy. In early 1971, he was traded to the San Diego Padres for Mike Jackson. He played for the Padres top farm team, the Hawaii Islanders, in 1971 and before retiring. Overall, Garibaldi went 0‚Äì2 with a 3.08 ERA in the majors. In 15 games, he had 11 walks and 14 strikeouts. Garibaldi was the last $100,000 Bonus Baby pitcher to never win a game. While pitching for the Giants' AAA teams in Tacoma and Phoenix from 1963 to 1970, Garibaldi recorded a record of 85‚Äì69, with a high of 15 wins in 1970. He tied for the PCL lead in wins, with 13, in 1969, and led the PCL in complete games with 17 in 1969, and 20 in 1970. He was named as pitcher on the National Association All-Star Fielding Silver Glove team by The Sporting News for the 1969 season. He was a player-manager for the Phoenix Giants in 1970.

It is part of Xcaret Experiencias Group which also owns the Xplor Park, Xel-Ha Park, and Xenses Park; as well as the Xichen, Xenotes, Xavage and Xoximilco tours and activities. It is situated approximately south of Canc√∫n, and south of the nearest large settlement Playa del Carmen along Highway 307. It is named after the nearby archaeological site Xcaret, a settlement constructed by the pre- Columbian Maya some of whose structures lie within the boundaries of the park's of land holdings. From 2010 to 2015, Xcaret Experiencias has been recognized as one of The Best Mexican Companies (Las Mejores Empresas Mexicanas), a recognition promoted by Banamex, Deloitte M√©xico and Tecnol√≥gico de Monterrey. ==History== Xcaret pond Mayan ruins in Xcaret Xcaret Mexico Spectacular The Ecological Park is built in the same area as the archaeological site and has the same name, Xcaret. The land was originally purchased by a group of Mexican entrepreneurs, led by architect Miguel Quintana Pali. 5 hectares of the land was purchased in 1984. When he began to clear the land, he started uncovering cenotes, sinkholes formed by collapsed cave ceilings weakened by 3 million years of erosion from underground rivers running through them and flowing into the sea. He saw the potential for tourism and formulated the idea of an Ecological Park open to the public, and soon joined forces with Oscar, Marcos and Carlos Constandse, achieving this goal in December 1990. At the same time, contact was established with the National Institute of Anthropology and History (Instituto Nacional de Antropolog√≠a e Historia) with the objective of rebuilding the remnants of the Mayan pyramids and buildings that were found in the area. The park‚Äôs administration subsidized all the operation and the INAH put in charge a team of specialists. ==Attractions== The nature-based attractions of the park include a river that goes through the Mayan village, a subterranean concrete sluice in which people can swim and snorkel with a life vest. Near the inlet there are recreational activities at the beach, snorkeling, Sea Trek and Snuba in the nearby reefs, or swimming with dolphins. The park also has a coral reef aquarium turtle nesting site. Next to the inlet there‚Äôs an area for manatees. The park also has a bird pavilion, butterfly pavilion, bat cave, orchids and bromeliad greenhouse, an island of jaguars, and a deer shelter, among others. The cultural attractions include an open church, replica of a Mayan village with real artisans at work, a Mexican cemetery, a museum, an equestrian show, Mesoamerican ball game, an open theater with performances of pre-Hispanic dances, Papantla flying men and the Gran Tlachco (theater with a six thousand people capacity) where the Mesoamerican ball game is represented, as well as the meeting of two worlds, the Mayan and the Spanish, and the presentation of several Mexican folklore dances. Other demonstrations of Mexican traditions include Day of the Dead celebration and the \\"Traves√≠a Sagrada Maya\\" (Mayan Sacred Crossing), an annual rite when Mayans would cross the sea from Xcaret and Playa del Carmen to Cozumel to pay homage to the lunar goddess Ix Chel. The modern version is a re-creation of this rite done in late May to early June. The park also has a Temascal and Spa, has 11 restaurants, dressing rooms, souvenirs and handicrafts stores, as well as an adjacent all-inclusive resort hotel. == Performances == Xcaret has different performances throughout the day in different areas of the park. The Charreria show is located outside of La Cocina Restaurant, and which has performances by Charros, Adelitas and a parade of Aztec Horses. The Duration of this show is 20 minutes and it is subject to park operations and seasonal requirements. The Papantla Flyers ritual ceremony is located outside of Xcaret Plus facilities. This show is 25 minutes long and it is shown four times a day. Pre-Hispanic performances take place in The Mayan Village and it is 25 minutes long.

Her parents were Mar√≠a Magdalena Rodr√≠guez and the notary Julio Maia, both originally from the north of Uruguay. Her father published her first book of poetry (Plumitas, 1944) when she was just 12 years old. The sudden death of her mother when she was 19 left a somber mark on Maia's first book of mature poetry which was published when she was 25 (En el tiempo, 1958). She married Ariel Ferreira, a medical doctor, in 1957. In 1962 they moved permanently to Tacuaremb√≥ in the north of Uruguay with their first two children. She studied philosophy in the Instituto de Profesores Artigas and also at the Facultad de Humanidades y Ciencias of the Universidad de la Rep√∫blica, both in Montevideo. She began teaching philosophy at a Tacuaremb√≥ high school and at the Instituto de Formaci√≥n Docente de Tacuaremb√≥, the local teachers' college. She was a founding member of a students' union (Centro de Estudiantes del Instituto de Profesores Artigas) and an active member of the Socialist Party of Uruguay. The years of the civil-military dictatorship of Uruguay were difficult for Circe Maia and her family. At 3 a.m. one morning in 1972, police raided their home to arrest both Ariel and Circe. However Circe was allowed to remain because she was caring for their four-day-old daughter. Her husband was imprisoned for two years for being associated with the Tupamaros National Liberation Movement. In 1973 the government dismissed her from her teaching position at the high school. However, she began to teach English and French language classes privately. In 1982 her 18-year-old son was killed in an automobile accident. This tragedy combined with the pressures of the dictatorship caused her to suspend poetry writing. With the return of democracy in 1985, her position at the high school was restored, and in 1987 she published two books, Destrucciones, a small book of bitter prose, and Un viaje a Salto, a narrative about an incident during her husband's imprisonment. Her return to poetry was marked by the publication of Superficies (1990), which was followed by other poetry books and her translations from English, Greek, and other languages. For the reading public, her most important publication was the recompilation of poetry from her previous nine books appearing as Circe Maia: obra po√©tica (2007 and 2010), amounting to over 400 pages. Circe Main taught philosophy in high school until her retirement in 2001, but she continued to teach English in a private institute and direct local theater productions, as well as continuing her work as a poet, essayist, and translator. == Poetry == In her first book as an adult, En el tiempo (1958) Circe Maia wrote that she favored a poetic language that was \\"direct, sober, and open, that was not different in tone from conversation, but was a conversation with greater quality, greater intensity.... The mission of this language is to uncover, not to hide; to uncover the value and meaning of existence, not to usher us into a separate world requiring an exclusive and closed poetic language\\". Throughout her poetic career Maia has been faithful to this conviction. People, objects, personal tragedies, the art of painting, and the passage of time are some themes she has \\"uncovered\\", and by doing so has revealed the human condition. She uses her personal experience to feel the pulse of humanity and to discuss it conversationally, as with a close friend. For more than fifty years she has avoided letting her poetry become self-contained, the sort of literature that ends up as monologue. As she has said, I see \\"in daily lived experience one of the most authentic sources of poetry\\". Her intensely intelligent poetry is an expression of sensation, especially the heard and the seen. Her poems have been set to music by Daniel Viglietti, Jorge Lazaroff, Numa Moraes, and Andr√©s Stagnaro, among others. That her poetry has been part of the spirit of the times can be seen in the Uruguayan nueva canci√≥n group of the late 1970s Los que Iban Cantando, whose name was inspired by a poem in her book En el tiempo (1958). Perhaps more significantly, her poem Por detr√°s de mi voz was set to music by Daniel Viglietti in 1978 as Otra voz canta. This song, sometimes performed in combination with the poem Desaparecidos by Mario Benedetti, became a Latin American anthem against the military regimes that committed forced disappearances, especially those participating in Operation Condor: ==Regional background== Maia has lived for many years in the northern city of Tacuaremb√≥. Along with fellow writer Jes√∫s Moraes, she is one of the relatively few contemporary Uruguayan writers to be strongly identified with the north of the country. ==='Poemas de Caraguat√°'=== Her series of poems 'Poemas de Caraguat√°, I, II, III & IV', take their name from the Maia's reflections provoked by an indigenous toponym of Tacuaremb√≥ Department in the north of the country, which may variously refer to a range of hills Cuchilla de Caraguat√°, a local town named after that range of hills, a local river, the Caraguat√° River, or a local plant. In this series of poems are contained reflections to which local topography, flora and fauna have given rise. == Prizes == * 2007, Premio Nacional de Poes√≠a de Uruguay. * 2009, Homenaje de la Academia Nacional de Letras. * 2010, Premio Bartolom√© Hidalgo. * 2012, Medalla Delmira Agustini. ==Bibliography Poetry === ;Collections * *1958, En el tiempo. *1958, Presencia diaria. *1970, El Puente. *1972, Maia, Bacelo, Benavides; poes√≠a. *1978, Cambios, permanencias. *1981, Dos voces *1986, Destrucciones, (prose poems). *1987, Un viaje a Salto, (prose). *1990, Superficies. *1996, C√≠rculo de luz, c√≠rculo de sombra, (translation of her poetry into Swedish). *1998, De lo visible. *1999, Medida por medida, (translation of Shakespeare's Measure for Measure). *2001, Breve sol. *2001, Yesterday a Eucalyptus, (translation of her poetry into English). *2004, A Trip to Salto, (English translation of her 1987 book). *2010, Obra po√©tica, (collected poetry). *2011, La casa de polvo sumeria: sobre lecturas y traducciones. *2013, La pesadora de perlas. *2013, Poemas: Robin Fulton, (her translation of the Scottish poet). *2014, Dualidades *2015, El Puente Invisible/The Invisible Bridge/Selected Poems of Circe Maia (bilingual edition) *2018, Transparencias *2018, M√∫ltiples paseos a un lugar desconocido ;List of poems {class=' sortable' width='90%' - !width=25%Title !Year !First published !Reprinted/collected - Hummingbirds 2013   - } ==See also== * Cuchilla de Caraguat√°#Featured in literature ==References * Circe Maia poem in translation at Poetry Daily. * Five poems in translation at Blackbird. * Three poems in translation at The American Literary Review * Two poems in translation at Boston Review. * Three poems in translation at Escape into Life. * Two poems in translation published in Philosophy Now.

The company covers the development cycle through five core operations, including small molecule R&D; and manufacturing, biologics R&D; and manufacturing, cell therapy and gene therapy R&D; and manufacturing, medical device testing, and molecular testing and genomics. ==History== WuXi's founder is Dr. Ge Li, an organic chemist, who founded WuXi PharmaTech in Shanghai in December 2000. WuXi established services in synthetic chemistry in 2001, manufacturing process development in 2003, research manufacturing in 2004, bioanalytical services in 2005, service biology in 2006, and toxicology and formulation in 2007. On December 14, 2006, WuXi PharmaTech announced that it was ranked 173rd on the Deloitte Technology Fast 500 Asia Pacific 2006. The company opened chemistry facilities in Tianjin in 2007. In 2008, WuXi PharmaTech acquired AppTec Laboratory Services Inc., a US-based company founded in 2001 with expertise in medical-device and biologics testing and with facilities in St. Paul, MN; Philadelphia, PA; and Atlanta, GA. WuXi opened a toxicology facility in Suzhou in 2009. WuXi opened a large-scale manufacturing facility in Jinshan in 2010. The company began a biologics discovery, development, and manufacturing operation in Shanghai and Wuxi City in 2011. At the same year, WuXi acquired MedKey, a China-based clinical research company, and Abgent, a San Diego company and one of the world's largest manufacturers of antibodies for biological research and drug discovery. In 2012, WuXi opened a chemistry facility in Wuhan and a GMP biologics drug-substance facility in Wuxi City. That year WuXi also entered into a joint venture with MedImmune and Kevin Tucker, the biologics arm of AstraZeneca, to co-develop MEDI5117, an anti-IL6 antibody for rheumatoid arthritis for the Chinese market. In 2013, WuXi formed a joint venture with the global clinical contract research organization PRA International (now called PRA Health Sciences) to build a clinical research business in China. In 2014, WuXi opened a new biologics biosafety testing facility in Suzhou. In the same year, WuXi acquired XenoBiotic Laboratories, Inc. (XBL), a contract research organization with 27 years of operation that provides bioanalytical, drug metabolism, and pharmacokinetic services to the pharmaceutical, animal health, and agrochemical industries. In 2015, WuXi completed its merger with WuXi Merger Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of New WuXi Life Science Limited. As a result of the merger, New WuXi Life Science Limited acquired the company in a cash transaction valued at approximately US$3.3 billion. In 2016, WuXi's STA subsidiary opened a new campus in Changzhou and operations in San Diego. In the same year, WuXi acquired Crelux GmbH, a structure-based drug discovery provider based in Munich, Germany. In 2017, WuXi acquired HD Biosciences (HDB), a biology focused preclinical drug discovery contract research organization (CRO). ==Company segments and subsidiaries== WuXi AppTec provides services to its customers primarily in the pharmaceutical, biotech, and other life science industries, as well as research institutes, disease- focused and non-profit foundations.

The subsidiary had offices in Boston and Woburn, Massachusetts (US); Dublin (Ireland), Reykjavik (Iceland) and Shanghai (China). In 2019, the subsidiary sought to divest its Chinese operations following changes to the country's Human Genetic Resource Regulation and a standing relationship with Huawei, both of which raised security concerns for the company as a whole. A buyer for the Shanghai facility had not been achieved by mid-2020, at which point the company changed its name to Genuity Science, having completed a round of internal reorganization. ==References== Category:Companies based in Shanghai Category:Pharmaceutical companies of China Category:Companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange Category:Pharmaceutical companies established in 2000 Category:Contract research organizations Category:Multinational companies Category:Life sciences industry Category:Chinese brands Category:Chinese companies established in 2000 ","title":"WuXi AppTec"},{"id":"20160330","text":"Dean Roemmich ( ) is a contemporary American physical oceanographer.

L. 91-575) between three U.S states: (Pennsylvania, New York, and Maryland), and the federal government, and signed into law by President Richard Nixon on Christmas Eve 1970 to be effective 30 days later on January 23, 1971.Each of the three participating states had already enacted the compact prior to its approval by the U.S. Congress and President Nixon, thus making it a solemn agreement among the parties to jointly exercise their sovereign powers in the management of the basin's water resources. The Commission is neither a federal or state agency, but rather is collectively the agency of all four of its member jurisdictions.Full text of the Susquehanna River Basin Compact ==The Compact == In the late 1960s, a broad group of concerned citizens saw the need for a federal-interstate coordinating agency to lead the conservation, development, and administration of the Basin's resources that would preserve and enhance its value as a scenic and recreational asset for the people who live in the Basin. The need to coordinate these efforts, along with those of three states and the agencies of the federal government, led to the drafting of the Susquehanna River Basin Compact, which was signed into law on December 24, 1970. The Compact, as adopted by the Congress of the United States, and the legislatures of New York State, Pennsylvania, and Maryland, provides the mechanism to guide water resource management of the Susquehanna River Basin. ==Membership== State membership on the Commission includes the governors of the three participating states or their designees. Under Pub. L. 110-114, the federal member is ex officio the Commander, North Atlantic Division, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The members appoint alternate members to serve in their place. As of August 2018, Major General Jeffrey L. Milhorn is the federal member of the Commission. Secretary Ben Grumbles is the member from Maryland and Basil Seggos is the member from New York. Secretary Patrick McDonnell is the member from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Major General Jeffrey L. Milhorn also serves as the United States Member of the Delaware River Basin Commission under the authority of Pub. L. 110-114. The Commission's appointed members do periodically change. Here is the most current member list. ==Purpose and Activities == The purpose of the SRBC is to manage the water resources of the Susquehanna River under comprehensive planning principles through its own programs and by coordinating the efforts of the three states and the federal government. These program efforts include implementation of structural and non-structural flood mitigation projects, regulation of water withdrawals and consumptive use, allocation of water resources among the member states, restoration and preservation of fisheries and wetlands, protection of future water supply (including availability of flows into the Chesapeake Bay), and protection of water quality.Overview of the SRBC Commission staff develops and implements the programs as directed by the commissioners and as found in Commission's comprehensive plan. The six priority management areas of the Comprehensive Plan are listed below, along with desired results. Sustainable Water Development: To regulate and plan for water resources development in a manner that maintains economic viability, protects instream users, and ensures ecological diversity; and meets immediate and future needs of the people of the basin for domestic, municipal, commercial, agricultural and industrial water supply and recreational activities. Water Quality: To support the existing and designated uses of all water bodies by achieving water quality that meets or exceeds standards. Flooding: To prevent loss of life and significantly reduce future damages from floods within the Basin through an integrated system of structural and nonstructural flood damage reduction measures. Ecosystems: To achieve healthy ecosystems that provide groundwater and surface water of sufficient quality and in adequate supply to support abundant and diverse populations of aquatic, riparian, and terrestrial organisms, as well as human use. Chesapeake Bay: To manage the water resources of the Susquehanna River Basin to assist in restoring and maintaining the Chesapeake Bay so it meets or exceeds applicable water quality standards and supports healthy populations of living resources, including oysters, crabs, fish, waterfowl, shore birds, and underwater grasses. Coordination, Cooperation and Public Information: To maximize available human resources and achieve common and complementary management objectives by the Commission, its member jurisdictions and others; to promote the planning and management of the basin's water resources in the most efficient manner possible; to inform the public on the Commission's water management responsibilities; and to enhance the public's access to Commission information and in commenting on Commission activities. ==Program Areas == The Commission completes much of its work through four program areas. These programs include: Project Review ‚Äì the permitting arm of the Commission's regulatory program, the Project Review team receives and reviews applications for water withdrawals and consumptive water use, makes recommendations to the commissioners for actions on those applications, and helps to develop key standards guiding how, when and where the Commission's policies and regulations are exercised. Compliance and Enforcement ‚Äì the enforcement arm of the Commission's regulatory program, the Compliance Program works to ensure that water related projects have the appropriate approvals and operate within the constraints of those approvals. Site inspections, quarterly reporting requirements, and an extensive project database are some of the essential tools used by the program. Monitoring & Protection - Monitoring and Protection scientists collect data to better understand the interactions of biological, chemical, and physical traits of streams throughout the Basin. These activities include water quality monitoring/sampling for macroinvertebrates & fish, stormwater, nutrient and sediment loadings, and abandoned mine drainage. Key protection efforts include operation of systems that provide real-time monitoring in sensitive watersheds and in the vicinity of drinking water supplies, establishing Total Maximum Daily Load criteria, assessing risks to drinking water sources, and characterizing the cause and extent of impairment to Basin waterways. Planning & Operations ‚Äì Planning and Operations provides technical support to the other programs and is tasked with assessing the nature and quantity of water use in the Basin. The Planning and Operations team also leads coordination efforts to help ensure that Basin agencies and residents are prepared to withstand and react to flooding and drought conditions. == Controversy == In 2012 the Commission attracted protests by approving the extraction of water for use in fracking, an activity whose opponents claim causes earthquakes, creates ground-water pollution and contributes to global warming. This water extraction involved the sale of a mobile home park by the owner to Aqua America who had gotten permission from the Commission to withdraw up to 3 million gallons of water per day from the Susquehanna at that site. Aqua America then evicted the occupants so as to build a pumping station on the site, attracting further protests from the residents of the site and their supporters. The sale of the property, not the Commission approval, triggered the eviction due to a local ordinance about operating the mobile home park in a floodplain. http://articles.philly.com/2012-04-18/business/31361933_1_fracking-trailer- park-anti-drilling ==See also== *Title 18 of the Code of Federal Regulations *Colorado River Compact *Columbia River Gorge Commission *Connecticut River Valley Flood Control Commission *Delaware River Basin Commission *Interstate Commission on the Potomac River Basin *Red River Compact Commission ==References * *Susquehanna River Basin Commission in the Federal Register *SRBC's listing at the Maryland State Archives Category:United States interstate agencies Category:Susquehanna River Category:Government agencies established in 1970 Category:Water management authorities in the United States Category:United States interstate compacts Category:Maryland law Category:New York (state) law Category:Pennsylvania law ","title":"Susquehanna River Basin Commission"},{"id":"20160376","text":"Ichabod and Me is an American sitcom series set in a small New England town and starring Robert Sterling and George Chandler.

The water rises to the surface without pumping and is transported by pipes to two bottling plants in the town of Borjomi. The Borjomi springs were discovered by the Imperial Russian military in the 1820s. They were made famous throughout the Russian Empire, making Borjomi a popular tourist destination. The history of the brand is closely associated with the Russian imperial dynasty of Romanov. By the 1890s, Borjomi was bottled in the Georgian estates of Grand Duke Mikhail of Russia. After the Russian Revolution of 1917 and subsequent Soviet takeover of Georgia, the Borjomi enterprise was nationalized and the water was made into a top Soviet export. Borjomi is exported to over 40 countries. A majority stake in Borjomi‚Äôs parent company, IDS Borjomi, was sold by the Georgian businesswoman Inna Gudavadze to Russia‚Äôs Alfa Group in January 2013.

Photo by Sergey Prokudin-Gorsky, 1912 The mineral springs of the Borjomi valley were discovered over one thousand years ago. Seven large rock tubs discovered by archeologists dating back to the beginning of the 7th century attest to the availability and use of the spring waters, most likely for bathing purposes. The springs were abandoned before being rediscovered in the early 19th century. By that time, as a result of the incessant warfare, Borjomi and its environs had been depopulated and covered with impassable forests.

Retrieved 2011-03-01 In 1829, when the Imperial Russian Army Kherson Grenadier Regiment was deployed in Borjomi for operations against the Ottoman Empire, Russian soldiers found mineral springs on the right bank of Borjomi river. Intrigued by the find, Colonel Pavel Popov, the commander of the regiment, ordered that the springs be cleaned and that the water be bottled and transported to the military base. Popov, who suffered from stomach disease tried the water first. Seeing positive results, he ordered the construction of rock walls around the spring and he had a bath house built nearby, along with a small cottage house for himself. In 1837, when the Kherson regiment was replaced by the Georgian grenadiers regiment, its medical doctor Amirov examined the water components and their effects, sending the first results of analysis to Saint Petersburg and Moscow. By 1841, the healing effects of Borjomi water were so famous that the viceroy of the Russian Tsar in the Caucasus Yevgeni Golovin brought his sick daughter to the springs for treatment. In light of the quick results of the treatment, he called the first spring Yekaterinsky () after his daughter Yekaterina and the second Yevgeniyevsky (–ï–≤–≥–µ–Ω—å–µ–≤—Å–∫–∏–π) after himself.

Borjomi water gained popularity for its curing effects all over the Russian Empire and the government began building palaces, parks, public gardens and hotels to accommodate incoming tourists and patients. The commute from Tiflis to Borjomi usually took 8‚Äì9 hours by phaetons, however the new Mikhaylovo-Borjomi railroad built in 1894 significantly reduced the length of the journey. Renowned figures such as Anton Chekhov, Pyotr Tchaikovsky as well as members of the royal Russian family were among the common visitors of the springs.

In 1894, Grand Duke Mikhail Romanov built a bottling plant in the Borjomi park which continued to operate until the 1950s. A glass factory followed in 1896. The income from the Borjomi waters enterprise contributed to the wealth of Mikhail's son and successor Nikolay, who was the richest of all Russian grand dukes by 1914. In 1854, 1,350 bottles of water were produced, by 1905 the number had reached 320,000 and by 1913 over 9 million bottles were sold. After the establishment of Soviet rule in Georgia, Borjomi was widely sold around the Soviet Union and was favored by Soviet leaders such as Joseph Stalin. Exploration of the Borjomi Gorge was conducted in 1927. Between then and 1982, 57 exploration wells (depths ranging from to ) were drilled. In 1961, 423,000 bottles of Borjomi was exported to 15 countries including the United States, France and Austria. During the existence of the Soviet Union, Borjomi was recognized as the third best known brand of the USSR after the Volga car and Aeroflot airlines. In the 1980s, annual production of Borjomi water reached 400 million bottles. Production slowed with the collapse of the Soviet Union and economic stagnation in the independent Republic of Georgia. In 1995, bottling of Borjomi was restarted by the Georgian Glass and Mineral Waters Company (GG&MW;), which increased the production forty-fold. According to the company, 80% of Borjomi produced that year was exported abroad‚Äîmore than half of this amount to Russia. Despite counterfeit drinks being produced under the Borjomi label as a result of rising piracy during the 1990s, Borjomi water was able to reclaim its reputation by 2000 in a distinctive packaging campaign. The piracy also slowed due to the 1998 Russian financial crisis. In May 2006, Russia banned imports of Georgian mineral waters, declaring them unsafe. The ban got lifted after 7 years in 2013. Georgia viewed this as an attempt to restrict access to the Russian market and making Borjomi a pawn in post-Soviet political power play. As a result of the ban, GG&MW; lost GEL 25 million in 2006, but the company declared the crisis to have been overcome by 2008, with sales volumes reaching pre-2006 level. The sales and export of Borjomi mineral water dropped again by 30-40% starting from October 2008 due to the global financial crisis. But already in 2010 the company declared that sales figures of Borjomi were the same as the company had before the ban. In 2011 sales company sold 15% more Borjomi than they were selling before the ban. Today Borjomi is sold in 40 countries worldwide. Today, Borjomi in post-soviet countries is a number one brand in imported mineral water brand segment. ==Features== Borjomi Gorge Borjomi is a water of volcanic origin which is over 1,500 years old. It is pushed up to the surface from 1500m below ground by natural carbon dioxide pressure. Borjomi does not cool down before it reaches the surface and comes out at a temperature of . The Borjomi springs are located in the central part of the Adjara-Imereti mountain range of Greater Caucasus at an altitude of above sea level. The average depth of each of the nine spring wells is . In order to preserve the mineral composition of the springs, in 2006 the Georgian Ministry of Environment Protection and Natural Resources approved a production plan for 2006‚Äì2031 estimating 561,000 litres per day which allows bottling of over 1 million bottles a day using 10 wells in Borjomi Gorge. The wells are located in 3 exploitation lots: Central (in the vicinity of Borjomi town), Likani (in Likani village) and Vashlovani-Kvibisi (in villages Vashlovani and Kvibisi). The water received from the wells travels by a stainless steel pipeline to two bottling plants where it is cooled and bottled. The first plant specializes in glass bottling, the second in PET bottling. The production of mineral water and the associated tourist economy in Borjomi and the nearby Borjomi-Kharagauli National Park make up 10 percent of Georgia's export trade. Construction of the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline near the Borjomi has been controversial because of potential negative environmental and economic impacts on the region. ==Packaging== A Borjomi mineral water ad from 1929, showing the bottle and advertising the water as \\"radioactive\\". This property is no longer emphasized. Borjomi comes in glass bottle sizes of 0.33 and 0.5 litres, plastic bottle sizes of 0.5 litre, 0,75l litres,1 litre and 1.25 litres and in 0.33 litre aluminum can. Glass bottles and PET bottles are screw-capped. The signature greenish color of the glass bottles (so-called Georgian Green) is based on a proprietary formula. In February 2011, new packaging of Borjomi water presenting a new and more sophisticated modern look was introduced, accentuating relief of the deer image and sign of the manufacturer on the label. In the end of 2019 Borjomi adopted a new design, following key design trends - simplicity and minimalism. The new bottles are more modern, feature the phrase \\"Georgian mineral water,\\" and includes silver stripes. == Awards == * 1907 SPA Grand Prix * 1909 Kazan Grand Golden Medal * 1911 Dresden Diploma of Honour * 1940 Tallinn Golden Medal * 1975 Budapest Diploma of Honour, World Exhibition * 1998 Novosibirsk Golden Medal * 1996, 1997, 1998 St. Petersburg Golden Medal ==References *Photos of the Borjomi botteling process *Indifications for treatment of Borjomi mineral water Category:Cuisine of Georgia (country) Category:Bottled water brands Category:Carbonated water Category:Mineral water Category:Soviet brands Category:Food and drink in the Soviet Union ","title":"Borjomi (water)"},{"id":"20160413","text":"District Chis-VIII shaded blue The Eighth Federal Electoral District of Chiapas (VIII Distrito Electoral Federal de Chiapas) is one of the 300 Electoral Districts into which Mexico is divided for the purpose of elections to the federal Chamber of Deputies and one of 12 such districts in the state of Chiapas.

Discontent in the army during the reign of King Vajiravudh (or King Rama VI) led to the unsuccessful coup. ==Background== In 1909, a group of soldiers got into an argument over a woman with a group of Vajiravudh's pages near the entrance to Vajiravudh's palace. At the time, Vajiravudh was the crown prince and designated successor to King Chulalongkorn (King Rama V). Six soldiers were arrested, and Vajiravudh petitioned Chulalongkorn to cane the soldiers. The practice of caning had recently been banned, and Chulalongkorn refused the petition. However, Vajiravudh threatened to resign as successor, and Chulalongkorn eventually consented to the caning. The incident caused much dissatisfaction within the army. Crown Prince Maha Vajiravudh succeeded his father as King of Siam on 23 October 1910. Vajiravudh set out in his coronation speech to modernize and westernize Siam in his role as its absolute monarch. The new king spent lavishly on his coronation and lived a life of excess in a period when most of the kingdom's populace were rural farmers and feudal serfs. Infatuated with Western culture and practices and considering himself an Edwardian English gentleman, Vajiravudh spent his time translating Shakespeare into Thai, staging dramatic productions, hunting, and overseeing his Wild Tiger Corps. ==Wild Tiger Corps== On 1 May 1911 Vajiravudh established the Wild Tiger Corps (Thai: ‡∏Å‡∏≠‡∏á‡πÄ‡∏™‡∏∑‡∏≠‡∏õ‡πà‡∏≤) (RTGS: Kong Suea Pa). The corps was meant to be a nationwide paramilitary corps, answerable only to the monarch. At first a ceremonial guard, it became a military force of 4,000 within its first year. Filled with commoners, the king would often mess with them and socialize with them openly. Army officers were not permitted to join the organization. The corps eventually rivaled the army in strength and the civil service in influence. The king even went so far as appointing some to high ranks in the army and nobility. While the king socialized with members of the corps, the regular army and aristocrats were deeply dissatisfied. They saw these new appointments as a threat to their hold on power. Partially due to massive spending on new palaces and dramatic productions, the kingdom was deeply in debt and was in danger of financial collapse. ==The revolt that never happened== Photograph of key plotters On 13 January 1912, dissatisfied with his reign and with the absolutist regime (especially his favourism towards the Wild Tiger Corps), a group of seven army officers decided to overthrow the king. The group's membership eventually reached 91 officers. The group were led by army Captain Khun Thuayhanpitak (Thai: ‡∏£.‡∏≠.‡∏Ç‡∏∏‡∏ô‡∏ó‡∏ß‡∏¢‡∏´‡∏≤‡∏ç‡∏û‡∏¥‡∏ó‡∏±‡∏Å‡∏©‡πå) and included some members of the king's own bodyguard. Perhaps inspired by the successful overthrow of the Manchus and the Qing Dynasty in China that same year, they decided to move forward. Their plans were unclear and their goals were contradictory. Some wanted to replace Vajiravudh with one of his many brothers, others wanted a constitutional monarchy and some in the extreme wing, a republic. On 1 April 1912, Thai New Year, the king was to preside over a merit making ceremony in public. Captain Yut Khongyu (Thai: ‡∏£.‡∏≠.‡∏¢‡∏∏‡∏ó‡∏ò ‡∏Ñ‡∏á‡∏≠‡∏¢‡∏π‡πà) was selected (by lottery) by the plotters to assassinate the monarch on that day. Filled with guilt he instead confessed all the plans and names of the conspirators to the commander of the king's bodyguard on 27 February, who, in turn, told the king's brother, Prince Chakrabongse Bhuvanath, The Prince of Bishnulok. The plotters were quickly arrested and imprisoned. At a military tribunal three were sentenced to death, 20 received life imprisonment, 32 received twenty years, six received fifteen years and a further 30 received 12 years imprisonment. They were tried for attempted regicide, treason, and attempted overthrow of the government. The failed uprising was the first revolt against the House of Chakri from the outside the nobility. Despite their actions, most of the plotters were pardoned or had their sentences lessened by the king himself in 1924. This included the death sentences (the king felt that no one had been hurt). However the lesson was not lost on Vajiravudh, who quickly stepped up vigilance against any such threats in the future. ==Aftermath and legacy== The Wild Tiger Corps was disbanded soon after the revolt. In 1914, Vajiravudh determined that the act providing for invoking martial law, first promulgated by his father in 1907, was not consistent with modern laws of war or convenient for the preservation of the external or internal security of the state, so he changed it to the modern form that, with minor amendments, continues to be in force. Vajiravudh reigned until 1925, initiating many reforms with mixed success. Vajiravudh died of natural causes and was succeeded by his brother Prajadhipok (Rama VII). Prajadhipok inherited from Vajiravudh a massive fiscal deficit, made worse by the onset of the Great Depression. The absolute monarchy was eventually overthrown by the Revolution of 1932, the leaders of which openly confessed their inspiration to be the actions of the 1912 plotters. ==See also== *Vajiravudh *Prajadhipok *Chakri Dynasty *Siamese Revolution of 1932 *History of Thailand (1768‚Äì1932) ==References Further reading == * Greene, Stephen Lyon Wakeman.

In Canada, and parts of the United States, most of the spruce tree species, pine tree species, and fir tree species share similar physical and mechanical characteristics, to the point where lumber derived from any of these species are interchangeable for construction purposes. Therefore, it makes sense to harvest and process them together, and sell them as one product. On some exchanges, there are different prices for Eastern and Western SPF varieties, and the price of Eastern SPF is generally higher than the price of Western SPF. When both types are sold together, the term Composite SPF is used. There is also utility-grade SPF, which is the lowest and cheapest grade. Western SPF species generally grow faster and larger, but Eastern SPF species are generally stronger. == Western SPF == Western SPF comes from the Canadian provinces of British Columbia and Alberta, and the US states of California, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, Washington, and Wyoming. It consists of the following species: * White spruce (Picea glauca) * Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmanni) * Lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) * Alpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa) Random-Length Lumber Futures and Options are traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, and Western SPF is the type of lumber specified in the trading specs.

It was released in PAL regions on October 4, 2002 and in North America on December 4, 2002. It is part of the Moto Racer series and was the last game to be developed by Adeline Software and also the last with any involvement from Delphine Software. Moto Racer Advance features several different modes, but much of it centers on a \\"Progression\\" mode, which requires the player to compete in races in a variety of environments. Multiplayer is supported through the link cable. Moto Racer Advance garnered positive reception from critics, noting its graphical quality and overall presentation as two of the main reasons for its success. IGN's Craig Harris called it one of the top racing games from 2002. As of 2009, Moto Racer Advance has received compilation scores of 86/100 and 83% on Metacritic and GameRankings respectively. ==Gameplay== tracks. The player controls a motorcyclist and must try to win races on various terrain and settings. Each motorcycle in the game handles differently with some performing better on paved roads and others working better on rougher terrain. There are a number of different modes: Grand Prix (GP), Motocross, and Traffic. GP takes place at a number of different locations across the world on paved tracks in places such as San Francisco and Russia. The paved tracks require the player to learn how to effectively use their brakes around corners. The GP courses contain small differences between them, giving more variety to the courses in the game. Motocross requires the player to drive on off-road terrain and to master the act of \\"powersliding\\" on corners. The courses found in Motocross races are less hospitable and often take place in arid and unkept locales and with obstacles. Traffic mixes both GP and Motocross, having mixed pavement courses and traffic on roads that serve as obstacles. There are three different methods of gameplay: Championship, Progression, and Single Race. The single race mode must be earned through playing the progression mode. Progression is the game's \\"main mode\\" and places the player in a number of different tournaments and races in all three racing styles. It allows the player to earn hidden content, including new bikes which handle differently. The game contains link cable support for up to four players, provided that all four people own a copy of the game. ==History and reception== Moto Racer Advance was first displayed at the 2002 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3). IGN gave the game two awards for portable games after its E3 2002 coverage: \\"Best Graphics\\" and \\"Best Racing Game\\". IGN praised the early version of the game for its high draw distance and smooth frame rate. The game was built from the ground up to be a racing game for the Game Boy Advance and to take advantage of the hardware offered by the system. IGN previewed the game six months before it was made available for retail and called the graphics the game's highlight, while noting that tune-ups in the physics engine were needed before release. The game manipulated 2D sprites and backgrounds to give the impression of 3D to the player. By keeping the core graphics engine simple, the game was able to contain elongated draw distances and a smooth frame rate. It was released on October 4, 2002 in PAL regions, and on December 4, 2002 in North America. Moto Racer Advance was the last game to be developed by Adeline Software. Moto Racer Advance garnered positive reaction from critics for its graphics and gameplay; it received 86/100 and 83% ratings on review aggregate websites Metacritic and GameRankings, respectively. IGN's Craig Harris praised the smooth graphics engine of the game, noting that the designers had succeeded in creating a satisfying racing game for the Game Boy Advance. He called it one of the top racing games from 2002. The Sydney Morning Herald's Dan Toose praised the game's \\"smooth, minimalist graphics\\", while GameSpy's Steve Steinberg noted that the physics of the game felt \\"dead-on\\" and enjoyed the overall presentation of the game. GamePros Vicious Sid was surprised by the game's long draw distance, calling it a technical feat on the Game Boy Advance. The sound design from the game received a mixed response from critics. GameZone's Code Cowboy stated that the Motocross bikes sounded \\"like gravel in a blender-- being chopped up\\". IGN noted otherwise, saying that the sound stayed to the background and was mostly pleasant, while The Sydney Morning Herald praised the realistic sound the bikes created. The game received Editors' Choice Awards from GameSpy, GamePro, and IGN. In a retrospective article, Moto Racer Advance was listed as the 6th-most \\"Forgotten Game Boy Advance classic\\" by PC Magazines Benj Edwards. ==References * Category:2002 video games Category:Delphine Software International games Category:Game Boy Advance games Category:Game Boy Advance-only games Category:Racing video games Category:Video games developed in France Category:Ubisoft games ","title":"Moto Racer Advance"},{"id":"20160836","text":"Nicholas Mark Catania (born 18 December 1945) is a former Australian politician.

These agents take the Tactical Training Course for 14 weeks. Federal police officers volunteer to join COT - there is no obligation or any recruitment. The selection is rigorous and requires high physical and mental fitness, assessed by a series of preliminary tests, in which about 60% of the candidates are eliminated. After this first phase, candidates undergo a training of more than one year until the final exam, after which they are finally admitted as members of the COT, immediately starting the training together with the rest of the team and being subject to a probationary stage, Where they will be evaluated their coexistence with the group, promptness in tactical-police actions and performance in the training given. ==Activities== COT's snipers during a training section. The COT is the elite unit of the Federal Police and is responsible for high-risk and complex interventions that require preparation beyond the conventional police forces. All COT officers are only employed in situations of high or high risk, differentiated from non- specialized federal police officers. Over the years, the COT adapted and evolved its training program based on the Brazilian reality; In addition to training common to the special operations units of other police in the world, COT has specific training to deal with operations against drug trafficking, terrorism and in biomes typical of Brazil, such as tropical forest, caatinga (desertic), marshland and cerrado. The COT is also responsible for resolving cases of seizure of civil aircraft within Brazil, with or without hostages. The TOC performs, on average, 110 operations per year throughout Brazil, distributed among sub-teams.

These harvesters utilized a 65 hp (49 kW) 226 cubic inch (3.7 Litre) 4-cylinder gasoline powered internal combustion engine. In 1969 the Gleaner E was replaced by the Gleaner K which was nearly identical to the E III model but powered by a larger 250 cu in (4.1 Litre) General Motors 6-cylinder gasoline engine. An Allis Chalmers four cylinder diesel engine was offered as optional equipment on later K2 models after 1976.

The house is a 1¬Ω story frame cottage with intersecting gable roofs, dormers, a bay window, and a shallow front porch. Gothic Revival details are found in the second-story windows, the steeply pitched roof lines, and the gabled wall dormers. Some Italianate influences are also present in the shallow portico and the wide eaves with scroll-cut brackets. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. The owner of the house, Jonathan Taylor Grimes, was an early settler in the Edina area and a pioneer horticulturist. Grimes was born in Leesburg, Virginia in 1818 and moved to Terre Haute, Indiana in 1840. He married Eliza Angeline Gordon in 1843. Eliza and Jonathan, along with three small children, moved to Saint Anthony in 1854. In 1859, Grimes and a partner, William Rheem, purchased in the southwest corner of what was then Richfield Township. This land included the Waterville Mill on Minnehaha Creek. The mill was later known as the Buckwater Mill, then the Browndale Mill, and finally the Edina Mill. Grimes later obtained a quit claim deed to north and east of the mill, where he built the house in 1869. In 1867, Grimes and Rheem sold the mill, and Grimes went on to become the first president of the Minnesota Horticultural Society. He conducted a variety of agricultural experiments, and he was responsible for introducing ginkgo and catalpa trees to Minnesota. Eliza Grimes died in 1902, and her husband died in 1903. After his death, the farmstead was subdivided. It became the Morningside area, a streetcar suburb. Morningside seceded from Edina in 1920, then rejoined Edina in 1966. Grimes Avenue in Edina is named for him, and Alden Drive is named for his son. ==References== Category:Buildings and structures in Edina, Minnesota Category:Carpenter Gothic architecture in Minnesota Category:Houses completed in 1869 Category:Houses in Hennepin County, Minnesota Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Minnesota Category:1869 establishments in Minnesota Category:National Register of Historic Places in Hennepin County, Minnesota ","title":"Jonathan Taylor Grimes House"},{"id":"20160920","text":"Photo of James John Skinner when Chief Justice of Malawi James John Skinner (24 July 1923 ‚Äì 21 October 2008) was an Irish-born Zambian politician and jurist. He was the first Minister of Justice of independent Zambia and the only White member of Zambia's first cabinet.\\"Dublin-born lawyer who became first white minister in independent Zambia\\" The Irish Times, 1 November 2008 Following his time as a Zambian jurist, Skinner moved to neighbouring Malawi, where he was Chief Justice of Malawi from 1970 to 1985. His final judicial appointment was as a Social Security Commissioner in England from 1986 to 1996. == Family == Skinner came from a family steeped in the law. His grandfather, James G. Skinner, was a solicitor in Mitchelstown, County Cork. His father William \\"Bill\\" Skinner was also a solicitor and was appointed the County Registrar for Tipperary. His uncle, Leo Baptist Skinner, a solicitor, was also an Irish Fianna F√°il politician and was elected (1943 and 1944) to D√°il √âireann as a Teachta D√°la (TD) for the Cork North constituency and was appointed a District Court judge in 1966. His cousin, Geraldine Skinner, a barrister, became the legal adviser in the Department of Foreign Affairs in Dublin and subsequently the Irish Ambassador to Luxembourg. ==Early life== Skinner was born in July 1923 in Clonmel, Irish Free State, to WJ Skinner, and Kathleen O'Donnell. He attended Clongowes Wood College prior to attending Trinity College, Dublin. Following studying at Trinity College, Skinner was called to the King's Inns in 1946 and to the English Bar at Gray's Inn in 1950. He practised in the Leinster Circuit from 1946 to 1951. ==Emigration to Northern Rhodesia and entrance to politics== In 1951, Skinner emigrated to Northern Rhodesia. He was called to the Bar of Northern Rhodesia in 1951. A defender of African rights, Skinner joined the mainly African United National Independence Party (UNIP) in 1960 and quickly became the party's legal advisor. Ostracized by most White residents of the colony, Skinner lost in his bid for a seat in the pre-independence parliament in the 1962 general election. Two years later in the first election following independence, he was elected to represent a constituency of Lusaka. He was appointed Queen's Counsel in Northern Rhodesia on 9 September 1964. In 1965, he was honoured with the Grand Commander of Order of Menelik II award from Ethiopia, recognising his contributions to Zambia's independence. Skinner was a member of the first cabinet and the Attorney General of Zambia from independence until 1967, when he was appointed Justice Minister. In March 1969, he was appointed Chief Justice of Zambia. ==Resignation== Skinner did not last long in his position as Chief Justice in Zambia. He resigned six months later in September 1969 following a clash with President Kenneth Kaunda over the sentencing of Portuguese soldiers from neighbouring Angola. The soldiers were caught on the Zambian side of the Angolan-Zambian border and were arrested. A fellow expatriate jurist, Ifor Evan, concluded the original arrest of the soldiers was \\"trivial\\" and dismissed the charges. When the issue was appealed to Skinner, he upheld Evan‚Äôs judgment. Kaunda, a long time friend of Skinner, attacked the White-dominated court for siding with the soldiers. Supporters of Kaunda stormed the court building following the ruling, attacking the Whites inside. Kaunda quickly apologised, but Evan and Skinner fled the country, with Skinner going on \\"indefinite sick leave\\".\\"Justice on Trial\\" Time Magazine, 15 August 1969 A month later, he was replaced on the court by Brian Doyle, a fellow White Zambian. ==Malawi, judicial appointment in England and return to Ireland== Skinner became the Chief Justice of Malawi in 1970 under Hastings Banda, lasting in that position until 1985. In that year, Skinner returned to England where he was appointed a Social Security and Child Support Commissioner by the Lord Chancellor. The work involved the determination of complex appeals on points of law often by unrepresented and disadvantaged claimants. He was adept in giving written judgments which were clear in law but in simple language that could be understood by claimants.\\"His Honour Judge Kenneth Machin\\" ‚Äì The Times ‚Äì Lives Remembered 12 November 2008 He retired at the statutory retirement age for judges (72) and spent his remaining years with his wife and five children. He died in October 2008 at the age of 85 and his ashes were finally buried in Clonmel in Ireland, the country of his birth. == Quotations == \\"I had not liked the social or racial atmosphere of the [colonial] time and reacted against it.\\"Irish Times 1965 \\"...such independence [of the judiciary] implies freedom from interference by the Executive or Legislative with the exercise of the judicial function, but it does not mean that the judge is entitled to act in an arbitrary manner.\\"Reply by Deputy Director of Elections (JJ Skinner) ‚Äì The Leader Northern Rhodesia 27 February 1962 \\"The people must know that when they go to court they will receive justice, and that all citizens are equal before the Courts regardless of their tribe, race or political opinions.\\"1 March 1969 on being appointed as Chief Justice of Zambia \\"It would be a sad day for Zambia if legal representation were denied to any member of the community.

Putnam's Sons. The novel incorporates an extensive essay on the history and culture of California from the vantage point of a future date when the state has disappeared. ==Plot synopsis== The novel describes, in retrospect, the history and culture of California from its earliest days, and its influence on the rest of the United States and the world when - after an unspecified date in 1969 - the state suffers a Richter magnitude 9 earthquake and the populous coastal regions west of the San Andreas Fault sink into the Pacific Ocean. This is in accordance with a fictional prediction by the real life psychic Edgar Cayce. The catastrophic quake itself is covered immediately prior to the last chapter of the novel. The quake is described as starting north of Point Arena, California and continuing southward as a large rupture on the San Andreas Fault, until it stops near Taft, California. Pausing for moments, a second larger quake resumes, continuing southward through the Los Angeles, California area, and into the Salton Sea, where the rupture inexplicably turns towards San Diego, California and back into the Pacific Ocean where the quake ends. As the quake progresses, various events (both large and small scale) are described in detail. After this event, the narrative switches to \\"present tense\\" news radio and television coverage of the event using a literary convention of \\"changing the dial / channel\\" from one news report to another, to cover the disaster: The Central Valley is inundated by the sea, the Embarcadero Freeway and Coit Tower have collapsed, along with the Oakland Bay Bridge. The Golden Gate Bridge remains standing initially. Los Angeles is in ruins. As this narrative closes, two more disasters occur nearly simultaneously: The Oroville Dam bursts, and in the twilight of the day, a passenger jet over San Bernardino is pulled out of the sky by turbulence, as the pilot tries to describe the sight of the San Andreas Fault splitting open in the dusk (and as is made clear in the final chapter, the pilot was witnessing Southern California slide into the sea). The novel's epilogue lists what the world must now do without, due to this event, especially the large percentage of agricultural products that come from California. The bulk of the novel consists of the description of three regions: The north, The Central Valley, and the south. An account of the 1966 California governor's electoral campaign is central to the narrative. Also discussed in detail are the 1965 Watts riots, in detail gleaned from then- recent news reports. ==Reception== As a result of its publication, some religious believers in the Los Angeles region decided to move away, in fear of its fictional events actually occurring. The turmoil surrounding the book's publication became known as the \\"Great California Earthquake Scare\\". ==References== *Life (magazine), Nov 15, 1968, book review by David Snell, p. 32d *California Earthquakes: Science, Risk, & the Politics of hazard Mitigation, Carl-Henry Geschwind.

Its name was changed to the Connecticut Training School for the Feebleminded at Lakeville in 1915. Two years later, it merged with the Connecticut Colony for Epileptics (founded at Mansfield in 1910) and acquired its present name. When it opened in 1917, the merged institution had 402 students in residence. By 1932, the resident population had grown to 1,070. During the Depression and World War II, demand for its services increased, resulting in both overcrowding and long waiting lists for new enrollments. Staffing levels increased during the 1960s as philosophies on treatment of mental retardation changed, and there were 1,609 residents and 875 full-time staff as of 1969. During the 1970s and 1980s many residents were relocated from dormitories to on-campus cottages or to group homes located around the state. By 1976 the resident population had dropped to 1,106, and by 1991 just 141 people remained as residents. In 1993, after numerous lawsuits concerning the conditions of the hospital, Mansfield Training School was closed and its patients sent to outpatient facilities and other institutions.Juliane Silver (2010), Finding Aid RG 170:001, Mansfield Training School Inventory of Records, Connecticut State Library website.

The listed area was and included 53 contributing buildings and seven non-contributing buildings. The majority of the contributing buildings were institutional buildings built between 1914 and 1930, all designed by the same architectural firm. and Also, the district included a farm that was operated beginning in 1909. The farm supplied the institution with most of its food and provided occupational therapy for people with epilepsy, as farm labor was deemed to prevent epileptic seizures.

Some were in the English language rather than Chinese, and many were allied with Christian missionary endeavours. == Terminology == Bao zhi ( means newspaper. In this context, bao means to announce, inform or report; zhi simply means paper. == News in ancient history == The historic roots of Chinese language periodicals goes back to the Spring and Autumn Annals, and traces through more than a thousand years of tipao, including Kaiyuan Za Bao and the Peking Gazette. The Peking Gazette was published daily until 1912. As this publication was intended for government officials only, it is not considered a true newspaper. However, it was widely read by others. The proper newspaper was introduced relatively late in the Far East, as a result of Western influence and the adoption of the printing press: Newspapers of the last century including today's newspapers of the People's Republic of China, Chinese newspapers overseas, and earlier papers such as Shen Bao, Xin Wen Bao, Zi Lin Xi Hu Bao, Ta Kung Pao also draw upon other influences in the history of newspapers.Chunming Li, Wei zhang, \\"Microfilming and digitization of newspapers in China\\", given at the 2006 World Library and Information Congress pre-conference == News in modern times == The first reference to privately published news sheets in China is in 1582 in Beijing, during the late Ming dynasty;Brook, Timothy.

China Monthly Magazine, which published from 1815 to 1821, marked the beginning of Chinese journalism. It was managed by Robert Morrison, and was printed in Malacca using traditional woodblock printing. It was primarily a Christian missionary organ, although it did include some news. China's first newspaper, the English- language Canton Register, was established in 1827. This was followed in 1835 by the Canton Press, another English-language newspaper. The Chinese-language Eastern Western Magazine was published from 1833 to 1838. This magazine included far more news than China Monthly Magazine, and also commentary. The British Bible Society imported a cylinder printer in 1847, China's first powered printing machine.Xiantao Zhang, The Origins of the Modern Chinese Press: The Influence of the Protestant Missionary Press in Late Qing China, p. 106.

Gamble's techniques were also adopted in Japan. North China Daily News, an English-language paper, was published in Shanghai from 1850 to 1941. This was a weekly until 1864, when it began publishing daily. The paper published a Chinese-language edition, Shanghai Xinbao, beginning in 1861.

It is located in the state's Los Tuxtlas. The municipal seat is the city of Catemaco. In the 2005 INEGI Census, the municipality reported a total population of 46,702, of whom 22,965 lived in the municipal seat. Ethnic composition is primarily of mestizo origins. Indigenous language speakers number less than 500. The municipality of Catemaco covers a total surface area of 710.67 km¬≤ along the Gulf of Mexico between the foothills of Volcano San Mart√≠n Tuxtla and the Sierra Santa Marta, and incorporate Laguna Catemaco and Laguna Sontecomapan plus a large part of the Los Tuxtlas Biosphere Reserve. Catemaco borders the municipalities of San Andr√©s Tuxtla to the west, Hueyapan de Ocampo and Soteapan to the south and Tatahuicapan de Ju√°rez and Mecayapan to the east. Economically Catemaco depends on a mix of tourism, cattle ranching, fishery and agriculture. Statistically the municipality ranks as one of the poorer ones in Veracruz. ==Settlements in the municipality== *Catemaco (municipal seat; 2005 population 22,965) *Sontecomapan (2,397) *La Victoria, (1,757) *Zapoapan de Caba√±as (1,344) *Maxacapan (990) ==The municipality== Section of the Barra de Sontecomapan on the Gulf of Mexico The city of Catemaco is the local government for 258 communities, which cover a territory of 659.2km2. The municipality borders those of Mecayapan, Soteapan, Hueyapan de Ocampo and San Andr√©s Tuxtla, extending to the Gulf of Mexico in the north. The municipal government consists of a municipal president, a syndic and four representatives called regidors. The municipality is rural with a population density of 73.7 people per km2, and only the seat considered to be urban. There a small community (297) of indigenous language speakers, mostly of Popoluca. Outside the seat, the main communities are Sontecomapan (pop. 2,413), La Victoria (1,842), Zapoapan de Caba√±as (1,382) and San Juan Seco de Valencia (1,237). The municipality has 166 schools that mostly serve students from the preschool to high school/vocational level with some adult and special education. There are fifteen libraries but a 17.1% illiteracy rate. The municipality has 204 km of major roadways, mostly state-maintained local highways. The most important road is Federal Highway 180, which connects the municipality primarily to San Andr√©s Tuxtla. There are no rail lines. ==Geography and environment== Looking towards Lake Catemaco from the Xococapan Tourist Ranch Lake island filled with herons Spider monkey on island in Lake Catemaco A hut on the lake The municipality is located in the Los Tuxtlas mountain region in the south of Veracruz, a rugged area of recent volcanic origin. It is located in a valley between the San Mart√≠n Volcano and the Santa Marta mountain ranges, extending from Lake Catemaco to the Gulf of Mexico shore, with an average altitude of 340 meters above sea level. Most of the wild vegetation has been destroyed, with 391.6km2 used as pasture for animals, 50.8 km used for agriculture and 39.4km2 with secondary vegetation. Only 84.8km2 remains as rainforest and 81.2km2 is covered by water. The soil is poor in nutrients and highly susceptible to erosion. The remaining natural vegetation is high tropical perennial rainforest, giving way to wetland vegetation and mangroves near and on the Gulf coast. Native tree species include cedar, royal palm, palo de agua, ojite (Brosimum alicastrum), ojueta, marayo and rabo lagarto (Equisetum arvense). The Nanciyaga Ecological Reserve preserve most of what is left of the rainforest that enveloped Lake Catemaco. Wildlife include small mammals such as squirrels, armadillos, rabbits, weasels and raccoons. Many bird species inhabit the lake area including herons, owls, cardinals and more. Numbers are highest in December with the arrival of migratory species. Spider monkeys were extinct but have been reintroduced in the Lake Catemaco area. For most of the year, the climate is warm and humid. The average temperature ranges from 20 to 26C, with the coolest months from November to January and the warmest in the summer. It rains all year because of warm humid winds from the Gulf of Mexico, but annual totals vary from 1900mm to 4600mm. The quantity of rainfall also varies by season, with a relatively dry season from March to June, when totals are half that of the rest of the year. Winds are predominantly from the north. From February to October, most winds are from the northeast, which are warmer. From November to January cooler winds from the north dominate due to cold fronts from the north called ‚Äúnortes.‚Äù Most of the municipality‚Äôs surface water is found in Lake Catemaco and the Sontecomapan Lagoon. The area is filled with rivers and streams including the San Juan Michapan, Comoapan, San Andr√©s and R√≠o Grande. Because of the area‚Äôs relative ruggedness, waterfalls can be found, such as the Tepepa Falls on the San Andr√©s River. The most important body of water in the municipality is Lake Catemaco. The lake basin was formed by volcanic eruptions of the Santa Martha and San Mart√≠n Volcanos. The lake is elliptical, with a maximum length of eleven km and a maximum width of eight km. It contains 553 million cubic meters of water and covers and area of 73km2, but is shallow, with an average depth of eight meters. The deepest part is twenty two meters, located between the city and Agaltepec Island. Various rivers and streams empty into the lake including R√≠o Grande, Yohualtajapan and Cuetzalapan. The Rio Grande, also known as the San Andr√©s River, empties the lake and forms the Eyipantla Falls on its way to the Gulf of Mexico. The lake and its twelve islands have been designation as a federal natural park. The largest of these islands is Agaltepec, 750 meters long and 150 at its widest, covering 8.5 hectares. This name is from Pipil and Nahuatl and means ‚Äústone canoe‚Äù or ‚Äúcanoe hill.‚Äù It is also called Crocodile or Dragon Island in reference to is shape which resembles the animal when seen from certain perspectives. Its vegetation remains intact with over 1,600 trees of 63 species. In 1988 and 1989, two groups of howler monkeys, which are in danger of extinction, were brought to the Agaltepec Island as an attempt to preserve the species. Since then the animals have multiplied with over 100 and their cries can be heard in the nearby city. The island is federal property and is maintained by the Universidad Veracruzana. There is also an archeological site on the island. Tanaxpillo, better known as the ‚ÄúIsland of the Monkeys.‚Äù This name and fame comes from a colony of stump-tailed macaques that live there, introduced as part of a research project in the 1970s. They are maintained by the university although they are also fed by local boat operators. One other popular island for visitors is the Heron Island (Isla de las Garzas), a sanctuary of the species, which cover the trees and have painted them white from their excrement. The other major body of water within the municipality is the Sontecomapan Lagoon. It is a large, shallow estuary which opens to the sea, covering 900 hectares in a very irregular shape. Its average depth is only two meters with the deepest part at five meters. The lagoon is fed by various rivers and streams with the salinity of the water increasing the closer one is to the Gulf of Mexico. It is mostly separated from the Gulf by the Barra de Sontecomapan, a stretch of beach and offshore reefs. Canals also stretch from the main body of water, and both these canals and the edges of the lagoon contain mangroves. The town of Sontecomapan, which the lake is named after, has docks for fishing and tours to see the area‚Äôs vegetation, especially its mangroves. Lake Nixtamalpan is located in a crater filled from underground. Its depth is unknown but estimated at fifty meters, and covers and area of about twenty hectares. The municipality has a coastline on the Gulf of Mexico. The most visited beaches here are Pe√±a Hermosa in Tatahuicapan de Ju√°rez, La Perla del Golfo in Mecayapan and Playa Escondida, most popular with foreign tourists. ==Socioeconomics== Man fishing on Lake Catemaco Man with mud facial drinking mineral water from leaf cup at Nanciyaga Ecological Reserve The municipality is classified as having a medium level of socioeconomic marginalization, with 64.5% living in poverty and 13.1% living in extreme poverty. 26.9% are employed in agriculture, fishing and forestry, 15.5% in manufacturing (mostly handcrafts) and 56.9% in commerce and tourism. However, the municipality‚Äôs main income is from ranching, fishing and agriculture. The most widespread activity is ranching, mostly raising cattle, followed by pigs and domestic fowl. Next is fishing. Lake Catemaco is one of the most productive in Mexico, but large net fishing is prohibited in order avoid overfishing. However, over 2,000 fishermen earn a subsistence living capturing about 2,000 tons each year. Main catches include tilapia (an introduced species), a sardine called topote and a fresh water snail called tegogolo. The most important crops are corn, followed by coffee and green chili peppers, but beans, rice, watermelons, oranges, mangos and coconuts are also grown. The local gastronomy is characterized by its ranching and fishing activities (both fresh and salt water) . Common ingredients include tegogolos, a fresh water snail said to be an aphrodisiac, freshwater eels, tochogobi (a type of mojarra) and pork, especially a preparation called ‚Äúcarne de chango‚Äù because it takes like monkey meat. Hotel del Brujo in Catemaco The area holds deposits of gold, silver, zinc and other materials, but here is no mining and no major industry. Handcrafts are made, mostly guitars called jarana jarochas (often decorated with snail and seashells) and decorative items for the tourist trade. The most important commercial activity is tourism, mostly centered in the city of Catemaco. The area attracts mostly Mexican visitors, with the busiest times being traditional vacation periods such as Holy Week, some parts of summer and long weekends. Most come to see the lake, including boat tours to the various islands, and visit the sorcerers. The area has also attracted the film industry, with films such as Medicine Man with Sean Connery and Apocalypto, filmed by Mel Gibson . Ecological tourism has grown in the municipality, allowing rural communities such as Ejido Lopez Mateos and Ejido Miguel Hidalgo to offer cabins and access to attractions such as rainforest, rivers and waterfalls, such as Cola de Caballo and Poza Reina. There are also archeological sites such as Las Margaritas and a pyramid on El Cerrito just outside Catemaco city. The most popular attraction of this type is the Nanciyaga Ecologial Reserve, a private tourist attraction which offers tours, mud facials, cabins, ritual cleansings, temazcals, a dock on Lake Catemaco and a mineral spring. The site cover four hectares just outside the city of Catemaco and was created in 1983. The water from the mineral spring is drinkable and made available to visitors using cups made from large green leaves. ==References * Municipal Official Site - dead link at present * Municipal Official Information *Catemaco Guide Category:Municipalities of Veracruz ","title":"Catemaco (municipality)"},{"id":"20161245","text":"Jean-Claude Gakosso in 2015 Jean-Claude Gakosso (born 25 July 1957.) is a Congolese politician who has served in the government of Congo-Brazzaville as Minister of Foreign Affairs since 2015.

He owns the production house Dev Entertainment Ventures Pvt. Ltd.. He is also the highest paid Bengali actor. Born in Keshpur, he made his acting debut in the 2006 film Agnishapath. Dev faced flak after the film was released, and it turned out to be a critical and commercial flop. His starring role in I Love You opposite Payal Sarkar was his breakthrough. Directed by Ravi Kinnagi, the film was critically unsuccessful, but was commercially successful and was quick to resurrect his career. Despite the success, Dev didn't get any work for the next fourteen months. He made a comeback on the silver screen with Premer Kahini, opposite Koel Mullick, his first with whom he went on to star with in numerous films. A remake of the Kannada hit Mungaru Male, the film was moderately successful. Dev got another breakthrough in Challenge which opened to critical and commercial success. He received the Anandalok Awards for Best Actor and Best Action Hero for his performance in the film. He continued to garner commercial success and wider attention through his successful films, including Le Chakka, Dui Prithibi, Paglu, Challenge 2, Khoka 420, Rangbaaz and Chander Pahar. He had been a recipient of numerous awards, namely Tele Cine Awards, Kalakar Awards, Filmfare Awards East, Filmfare Awards East (2017) & NABC International Bangla Film Award 2017. His accomplishments have made him one of the highest paid and sought out actors of Bengali cinema. Though he has delivered some critically acclaimed performances, Dev is often trolled for his poor accent, average acting skills, his winning of the Mahanayak Samman from the Government of West Bengal and his work as a politician. Dev had also been a mentor on the Bengali dance reality show Dance Bangla Dance, replacing Mithun Chakraborty. He is now also an honourable Member of Parliament of India from the Ghatal constituency, as a candidate from the party All India Trinamool Congress. ==Early life and background== Dev was born on 25 December 1982, in Mahisha, a small village near Keshpur, to Gurudas Adhikari and Mousumi Adhikari. His father used to have a food-catering service and his mother is a housewife. His nickname is Raju. He spent his childhood living with his maternal uncle in Chandrakona and his sister, Deepali. Later in his childhood, he moved to Mumbai and attended Purushottam High School in Bandra, where he was a good student. His sister, Deepali Adhikari, was married on 9 August 2015 to Anirban. He also did an acting course at the Kishore Namit Kapoor Acting Academy. In an interview with The Times of India, Dev recalled that when his school was closed for summer, he went to the outdoors of Prahaar: The Final Attack with his father, where Nana Patekar was shooting. He described it as more of a family vacation for them and work didn't feel like work. As a child, that was the first time he got a taste of cinema. Though that was his first, life continued to be the same for the next couple of years. The family was based in Mumbai and Dev would often accompany his father to the sets of Abbas-Mustan and Prakash Jha, among several others. There were times when his father would keep busy with other things and he had to chip in. Though he couldn't cook, he would do the groceries and supervise on his father's behalf. He also said there were times when he washed plates and served food. After receiving his diploma from Bharatiya Vidyapeeth University, in Pune, in Computer Engineering, Dev returned to Mumbai and started his film career as an observer on the set of Abbas-Mustan's Taarzan: The Wonder Car. == Film career  2005‚Äì09: Debut, early career === Mon Mane Na Dev made his acting debut with the 2005 film Agnishapath, directed by Prabir Nandi, opposite Rachana Banerjee.

Dev met with the producers and gained the male lead role. Despite the financial success of I Love You, Dev did not take on any other roles for about 14 months. He went to Mumbai, and, dedicated to improving himself, learned dance and trained under fight choreographer Aejaz Gulab (of Shootout at Lokhandwala and Mission Istaanbul fame). === 2008‚Äì10: Comeback and success === Dev at Shree Venkatesh Films's office in 2010 Dev made a comeback to acting in director Raj Chakraborty's action-romance Challenge, opposite Subhashree Ganguly. The film was a huge hit in West Bengal, giving Dev a considerable popularity boost. Dev performed item songs like \\"Pante Tali,\\" and Chirodini Tumi Je Amar. The tracks and videos were very successful. He also performed an additional item number in the film Jackpot, directed by Kaushik Ganguly. The song was a remake of \\"Jibone ki Pabona,\\" a track originally performed by Bengali actor Soumitra Chatterjee. Dev appeared as a cameo in Ekti Tarar Khonje directed by Abhik Mukhopadhyay. In December 2010, Indian romantic Bengali film Shedin Dekha Hoyechilo starring Dev and Srabanti Chatterjee was released, directed by Sujit Mondol and produced by Shree Venkatesh Films. This is the second collaboration between Dev and Sujit Mondol. This movie was one of the biggest hits of 2010. The title track of the movie, being shot in Switzerland, is one of the best romantic songs of Tollywood ever. The chemistry between Dev and Srabanti is so mellifluous that it added a new flavour, which was tremendously appreciated by the audience and critics. The film had an item number by Samidh and Rishi \\"Khokababu jaye, Lal juto paye\\", which was the entry song for Dev in the movie. The song's choreographer Baba Yadav said: \\"Dev has done a great job. There's no doubt that he is an amazing dancer...What I like about Dev is the fact that he enjoys dancing. This shows in his movements.\\" \\"Khokababu jaye, Lal juto paye\\" was the costliest song of Tollywood (costing nearly 50-60 million) until the release of Khokababu in January 2012, which contained the costlier item number, \\"Dance maare Khokababu\\". In 2010, Dev received the STAR Ananda Shera notun Protibha Award, at the 2010 Shera Bangali Awards. === 2011‚Äìpresent: Commercial and critical success === In June 2011, Dev starred alongside Koel Mallick in Paglu, directed by Rajib Biswas.

As per Sree Venkatesh distribution head, Debasis Sarkar ‚Äì \\"Paglu released in 166 theatres across Bengal in the first week. The second week has seen the number of theatres rising to 169. The movie is running in 17 theatres in Kolkata. The gross collections till Monday's (13 June) matinee show have crossed Rs 50 million.\\" The film was a box-office success. This film also introduced martial art in Bengali cinema and Dev as the first martial art hero. The director said ‚Äì \\" Dev was superb with the action sequences. He did some martial art stunts and also learnt kickboxing for two months only for my movie. I was amazed with his dedication. Bengali films haven't ever seen such action sequences before. There is a train and a bike chase sequence that was shot by Zoyeb and Dev. I was literally scared when they were shooting this sequence without any body double. Hats off to their courage\\". In November 2011, his movie Romeo, directed by Sujit Mondol and co-starring Subhashree Ganguly was released was released and earned Dev commendations from all sections of audience and from critics.

Though the former two films were commercial hits, with Khoka 420 and Rangbazz earning 8,000,000 and 9,000,000 respectively, the latter gave him a slight decree of critical success. Made on a budget of 15,000,000 and shot in South Africa, the film met with critical and commercial success upon release. Dola Mitra of Outlook (magazine) reviewed: \\"Dev charms as Shankar Choudhury, the young Bengali village boy who dreads clerkdom and wangles a job as station master of a tiny train station in Uganda, where only one train stops in a day.\\" Besides many awards, Dev won the Kalakar Awards for his performance in the film and a Filmfare Awards East nomination.

Dowell (April 4, 1944 ‚Äì April 1, 1967), an African- American resident of North Richmond, California, occurred on April 1, 1967. He was shot by an officer of the Contra Costa County Sheriff's Department with six shotgun pellets during a suspected burglary incident.Sol Stern, \\"The Call of the Black Panthers,\\" The New York Times, August 6, 1967, p. 186. According to the media and police, at about 5 a.m. on April 1, 1967, two sheriff's deputies responded to a telephone call that a burglary was in progress at a liquor store in North Richmond, CA. Upon arrival at the location, one deputy spotted two suspects and ordered them to halt. They fled and the deputy fired one shotgun blast. Denzil F. Dowell was struck and killed. The second suspect escaped. A hole was found broken through the cement wall of the liquor store, and various burglary tools were found at the spot the two suspects were first seen. A coroner's inquest was held to investigate the shooting. It was ruled a justifiable homicide on April 14, 1967. The ruling was made unanimously by a jury of 10 white and two black citizens after 30 minutes of deliberation.Oakland Tribune, April 15, 1967. The Black Panther Party (BPP) noted multiple inconsistencies with the case, notably:Black Panther, April 25, 1967, 1-2. # Denzil Dowell was unarmed, so, therefore, six bullet holes and shotgun blasts cannot be considered \\"justifiable homicide.\\" # The media and police said three shots were fired, while the coroner and witnesses described six to ten shots. # The media and police said it occurred from 4:49 AM to 5:01 AM, yet witnesses say it occurred around 3:50 AM, around an hour earlier than what the police claimed. # Only Richmond police were first at the scene, not until 4:50 AM were Martinez sheriffs seen on the scene. # The police had reported that Denzil ran and jumped a fence, then attempted to jump another and was then shot. The Dowell family reported that he had injured his hip in a car accident, and had trouble running after leaving the hospital. Therefore, he wouldn't have been able to jump the first fence, nor run. All of that, supposedly, while he had a hammer in hand. # The lot that Denzil supposedly ran across was a junkyard filled with car parts, grease, and oil, but no grease or oil was found on his shoes. # The coroner reported that Denzil had bled to death, yet Denzil's sister reports very little blood. # No attempt had been made to call an ambulance or revive Denzil by the policemen. # The Dowell family was denied the right to have Denzil's clothing or take pictures of his body to verify the number of bullet holes for themselves. # The media had announced a \\"justifiable homicide\\" two hours before the jury gave its verdict. The foreman on the jury could not read. # The policeman had a prior connection to Denzil. He had shouted, \\"Denzil Dowell, give me your identification.\\" # Denzil's mother stated \\"I believe the police murdered my son.\\" The event led to a street rally organized by the Black Panther Party for Self Defense. During the rally 15 armed members of the Black Panther Party held a street rally to protest against police brutality. This event helped to establish the Black Panthers in the national spotlight. It also provided the content for the first edition of the BPP newspaper, The Black Panther, which was published in April 1967 with a headline about the killing of Denzil Dowell.Joshua Bloom and Waldo E.

The tax on tea particularly angered the colonists, so they boycotted English tea for several years, during which time merchants in several colonial cities resorted to smuggling tea from The Netherlands. It was generally known that Philadelphia merchants were greater smugglers of tea than their Boston counterparts. As a result, the East India Company appealed for financial relief to the British government, which passed the Tea Act on May 10, 1773. This Act of Parliament allowed the East India Company to sell tea to the colonies directly and without \\"payment of any customs or duties whatsoever\\" in England, instead paying the much lower American duty. The resulting tax break allowed East India to sell tea for half the old price and cheaper than the price of tea in Great Britain, enabling the firm to undercut prices offered by colonial merchants and smugglers. The Tea Act infuriated colonials precisely because it was designed to lower the price of tea without officially repealing the tea tax of the Revenue Act of 1767. And colonial leaders thought the British were trying to use cheap tea to \\"overcome all the patriotism of an American,\\" in the words of Benjamin Franklin. == Prelude == Word was received in North America by September, 1773, that East India Company tea shipments were on their way. Philadelphians held a town meeting on October 16 at the Pennsylvania State House (now known as Independence Hall). This meeting was organized by Dr. Benjamin Rush, Colonel William Bradford, Thomas Mifflin, Dr. Thomas Cadwalader, and other local leaders and members of the Philadelphia Sons of Liberty. They adopted eight resolutions, one of which stated: \\"That the duty imposed by Parliament upon tea landed in America is a tax on the Americans, or levying contributions on them without their consent.\\" The most important one read: Printed in the Pennsylvania Gazette, these declarations comprised the first public protest against the importation of taxed tea from England. In Boston three weeks later, a town meeting at Faneuil Hall declared \\"That the sense of this town cannot be better expressed than in the words of certain judicious resolves, lately entered into by our worthy brethren, the citizens of Philadelphia.\\" Indeed, Bostonians adopted the same resolutions that Philadelphians had promulgated earlier. The Boston Tea Party followed just a few weeks later, on December 16, 1773. == Event == On December 25, the British tea ship Polly sailed up the Delaware River and reached Chester, Pennsylvania. Commanded by one Captain Ayres, the ship carried 697 chests of tea consigned to the Philadelphia Quaker firm of James & Drinker. Several Philadelphia gentlemen proceeded to intercept the Polly and escorted Ayres to the city. Two days later, there was a mass meeting of 8,000 Philadelphians in the State House yard to address the situation. This was the largest crowd assembled in the American colonies up to that point. A number of resolutions were adopted, the first one being \\"that the tea... shall not be landed.\\" It was further determined that the tea should be refused and that the vessel should make its way down the Delaware River and out of the Delaware Bay as soon as possible. Captain Ayres was probably influenced by a broadside issued by the self-constituted \\"Committee for Tarring and Feathering\\" that plainly warned him of his fate should he attempt to unload his ship's cargo. Dated November 27, the handbill read, in part: The flyer also warned river pilots that they would receive the same treatment if they tried to bring in the Polly. (Another such broadside specifically warning river pilots was later issued on December 7.) Consignees of the tea would also suffer dire consequences if they accepted shipment. Captain Ayres was ushered to the Arch Street Wharf and from there returned to his ship. He then refitted the Polly with food and water and sailed it back to Britain, still laden with its cargo of tea. Perhaps due to the Quaker influence in Philadelphia, the \\"Philadelphia Tea Party\\" was relatively nonviolent and did not cause loss to any innocent merchants, since no tea was destroyed. In fact, local merchants may have even helped Captain Ayres with his expenses in returning to England. == Influence == Restrained as it was compared to Boston's, the Philadelphia Tea Party was one of the incidents that led to the calling of the Continental Congress at Carpenters' Hall in Philadelphia the following September. Furthermore, in 1809, Dr. Benjamin Rush wrote to John Adams: Both Pennsylvania and Philadelphia were regarded as having been far more conservative before and during the Revolutionary War than the New England colonies and most of the Southern colonies‚Äîand this historic reputation persists to this day. But the Philadelphia Tea Party highlights that the radicals of Philadelphia and Pennsylvania played a much more active role in the American Revolution than generally acknowledged. ==Footnotes== * William C.

Professor Sharma studies in detail the basic relationships in early medieval society down to the eve of the Ghorian conquests.

Filming started in late October 2008 in Rio Rancho, New Mexico and was finished in late December 2008. The film was released on January 15, 2010 in the United States by Lionsgate. The film was released on DVD, and Blu-ray on May 18, 2010. The film tributes Chan's films by showing clips, references and even referencing Chan's real life childhood. The film received negative reviews from critics and it earned $45.2 million on a $28 million budget. ==Plot== Bob Ho is an operative of the CIA as an undercover agent on loan from the Chinese Intelligence, who decides to retire after putting Russian terrorist Anton Poldark behind bars and marry his longtime girlfriend Gillian, who lives next door and has three children from previous relationships, Farren (a step-daughter), Ian and Nora. None of them know about his real job and think he works at a print manufacturing company. One day, Gillian leaves to visit her father in a hospital in Denver, Colorado and leaves Bob to take care of her children, but Farren and Ian despise him and plot to get rid of him. Using some technology from the CIA, Bob is able to take control and gradually bonds with the children. His partner, Colton James, informs him that Poldark has escaped prison and they suspect there is a mole in the CIA. Colton sends a file to Bob's computer for a top-secret formula for an oil-eating bacteria Poldark is working on. While snooping around Bob's house, Ian downloads the file, which he mistakes for music, onto his iPod. Poldark discovers the download and sends some of his henchmen to Bob's house, but Bob overpowers them. After the attack, Bob and the children hide at a Chinese restaurant, where Poldark's teenage henchman, Larry, tries to kill Bob. Bob defeats him and is forced to tell the children about his job. His boss Glaze then arrives, points a gun at him and demands the downloaded file, revealing himself as Poldark's mole. Bob knocks out Glaze with Nora's turtle, then hides in a hotel with the children. Farren tells Gillian over the phone about Bob's secret. Fearing for her children's safety, Gillian flies home to take them back and angrily breaks up with him for lying to her. Bob heads to an abandoned factory to confront the Russian terrorists but finds that Ian, wanting to become a spy, followed him and Farren has run away from home to try and help as well. The three are captured by the Russians, who force Ian to reveal that the file is on his iPod quite easily since Ian doesn't know how to handle an interrogation. As Poldark, his partner Tatiana, and Glaze go to Gillian's house, Bob and the children escape and return home, where Poldark and his crew arrive soon after. Bob, Gillian's family and the terrorists fight, with the children using Bob's secret weapons to defeat some of them, and soon after Colton and his crew arrive to arrest the Russians and Glaze. Gillian initially rejects Bob, but changes her mind when her children express their heartfelt approval of him. In the end, Bob and Gillian get married. At the altar, Bob confesses to Gillian that Bob is not his real name, which Gillian and her children accept with a laugh. ==Cast== * Jackie Chan as Bob Ho, a spy for the CIA and Gillian's neighbour, boyfriend and eventual husband * Amber Valletta as Gillian, Bob's neighbour, girlfriend and eventual wife * Magn√∫s Scheving as Anton Poldark, a Russian terrorist * Madeline Carroll as Farren, Gillian's step-daughter * Will Shadley as Ian, Gillian's son * Alina Foley as Nora, Gillian's daughter * Billy Ray Cyrus as Colton James, Bob's partner * George Lopez as Glaze, Bob's corrupt boss * Lucas Till as Larry, a teenager working with Poldark * Katherine Boecher as Tatiana Creel * Jeff Chase as Russian thug * Esodie Geiger as Principal ==Soundtrack== * \\"Secret Agent Man\\" ‚Äì Performed by Johnny Rivers * \\"The Way It Was\\" ‚Äì Written and Performed by Daniel May * \\"Ba Ma De Hua\\" ‚Äì Performed by Jackie Chan (theme song of Rob-B-Hood, a film also made by Chan) * \\"One Way or Another\\" ‚Äì Performed by Blondie ==ReleaseBox office=== In its first weekend, in the US, The Spy Next Door made $9.7 million in 2,924 theaters, opening at #6.

He is a Senior United States District Judge of the United States District Court for the District of Oregon in Portland, Oregon. A native of Oregon, he served as an active judge for eleven years, and was in private legal practice in Salem before that. ==Early life== Marsh was born in Portland, Oregon, on September 24, 1928, the son of lawyer Francis Marsh. His father's twin brother was Eugene E. Marsh, onetime Speaker of the Oregon House of Representatives and President of the Oregon State Senate.Frank, Gerry. \\"Friday Surprise, Oregon history indeed rich in personal, political links\\", The Oregonian, April 7, 1995, p. A21.Zusman, Kelly. Oregon Legal Heritage. ‚ÄúA Son of Oregon: A tribute to the Hon. Malcolm F. Marsh‚Äù, Oregon State Bar Bulletin, October 2004. Both brothers served as president of the Oregon State Bar. The family moved to McMinnville southwest of Portland in 1935. In 1946, he joined the United States Army and served as a corporal in Japan until discharge in 1947. ==Professional career== After returning to Oregon, he enrolled at the University of Oregon in Eugene where he graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in 1951. Marsh then attended the University of Oregon School of Law, and graduated in 1954 with a Bachelor of Laws. In 1953, he married the former Shari Long, and they would have three children. After graduating from law school, Marsh entered private practice in McMinnville, working for his father. Later in 1954 he moved to Salem where he partnered with Ned Clark and specialized as a trial attorney in products liability. He was inducted into the American College of Trial Lawyers in 1979. In 1983, he was named Salem's First Citizen.\\"Previous first citizens\\", Statesman Journal, January 26, 2002, p. 2A. ==Federal judicial service== While in Salem he became friends with later United States Senator Mark Hatfield in the 1950s, and remained in private practice in the city until 1987. The friendship with Hatfield helped lead to President Ronald Reagan nominating Marsh for a judgeship on the United States District Court for the District of Oregon in 1987 after Edward Leavy moved to the Ninth Circuit. Nominated on February 2, 1987, he was confirmed by the United States Senate on March 20, 1987 and received his commission on March 24, 1987, for the Portland-based court. On April 16, 1998, Marsh took senior status. ==Notable cases== Marsh oversaw the legal proceedings by the federal government against the State of Oregon over the Fairview Training Center in Salem in the late 1980s.McCarthy, Nancy. \\"Trial of Fairview Center suit postponed\\", The Oregonian, October 22, 1988, p.

C6. Marsh heard the case and ruled for the state, saying the state did not need to hold all the elections in one year and could retain the staggered system. Later in 1992, he presided over the lawsuit against the Vernonia School District for the district's random drug testing policy.\\"Chronology,\\" The Oregonian, March 27, 1995. In the case, Marsh ruled the testing policy was constitutional, but was overturned by the United States Circuit Court for the Ninth Circuit, which in turn was overturned on appeal by the Supreme Court.Vernonia School District 47J v. Acton, 515 U.S. 646 (1995).Epstein, Aaron. \\"Supreme Court to decide on school drug testing\\", The Denver Post, November 29, 1994, p. A3. Over several years Marsh presided over several cases concerning salmon. This included later oversight of the Sohappy v. Smith case concerning tribal rights to salmon runs in the Pacific Northwest.Barker, Eric. \\"Tribal gillnetter catches one steelhead; Fisheries department spokesman is unsure if other permits will be issued\\", Lewiston Morning Tribune, January 26, 2007, p. 1A. He also heard the first challenges to the dams on the Columbia River under the Endangered Species Act after some salmon runs were listed as endangered. Marsh presided over the 1995 trial of several former followers of the Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh after their failed assassination plot against U.S. Attorney for Oregon Charles H. Turner.Reed, Christopher. \\"Cult women get five years' jail\\", The Guardian, December 2, 1995, p. 1. Turner had investigated the Rajneeshees and their activities including their bioterror attack. At trial two Rajneeshees were found guilty in the plot and Marsh sentenced them to five years in prison. He later sentenced another conspirator to five years of probation for their role in the plot.\\"FED: Perth-born Orange follower avoids jail over US kill plot\\", AAP Newsfeed, February 2, 2006. Marsh was the main person from the judiciary involved with the design of the new Mark O. Hatfield United States Courthouse.

Matthews is of African American and Jewish descent. His memoir Ace of Spades recounts growing up in the inner city of Baltimore, Maryland as a biracial child who could pass for white. Matthews' Jewish mother was schizophrenic and left his father when Matthews was only a few months old. As a result, Matthews was raised by his father, Ralph Matthews, Jr., an African American journalist who counted Malcolm X and James Baldwin among his friends. The Matthews family lived in the Maryland suburbs of Washington, D.C., but in 1977 moved next to the segregated Bolton Hill area of Baltimore, a tiny enclave of rich, white families, which was surrounded by the primarily black ghetto of west Baltimore. He describes himself as not initially fitting in with either the black or white children in his public elementary school, sparking his decision to \\"pass\\" as white. Matthews attended Baltimore City College High School where he attempted to \\"pass\\" as not only white, but Jewish. Lacking any cultural knowledge of Jewish life, Matthews was not accepted as a Jew and continued to search for an identity. Matthews' first book, Ace of Spades details this search, and is presented in a somewhat acerbic coming-of-age literary style. Matthews currently resides in New York City and Los Angeles. ==Published work== He is the author of two non-fiction books. His first, \\"Ace of Spades\\", is an autobiographical memoir. His second, \\"Kicking Ass and Saving Souls\\" follows the adventurous life of Stefan Templeton. His work has appeared in The New York Times, Salon, The Huffington Post, and he has contributed to \\"The Autobiographers Handbook\\". He has also written the introduction for the Paris Review edition of The Catcher in the Rye. ==Film and television== Matthews' Television Credits include Law & Order: Los Angeles; Story Editor for Law & Order: Special Victims Unit; Executive Story Editor for Season 4 of HBO's Boardwalk Empire; Co-Producer on F/X's Tyrant; and Supervising Producer on HBO's Vinyl. ==See also== * Stefan Templeton ==ReferencesSources== *Smith Magazine - Memoirville - Interview with David Matthews ==External links== *Review of Ace of Spades (The New York Times) Category:1967 births Category:Living people Category:American memoirists Category:Jewish American writers Category:African-American writers Category:American biographers ","title":"David Matthews (author)"},{"id":"20161502","text":"ƒåe≈°enik (; in older sources and locally: ƒåem≈°enik,Leksikon obƒçin kraljestev in de≈æel zastopanih v dr≈æavnem zboru, vol. 6: Kranjsko. 1906.

He was the brother of Pennsylvania railroad magnate Robert Pitcairn and industrialist John Pitcairn. ==Early life== Pitcairn was born in Johnstone, Renfrewshire, Scotland to parents John Pitcairn, Sr. (1803‚Äì1884) and Agnes McEwan. He was one of six children resulting from the marriage, and also had two older half- siblings from his father's first marriage. In 1846, he emigrated with his family to Allegheny, Pennsylvania, where his uncle, Alexander Pitcairn, had started a woolens business. He received a public school education in Allegheny and Altoona, Pennsylvania. He began his career in the railroad service, and held a series of executive positions in the field: first as superintendent of the Susquehanna Division of the Northern Central Railway, in 1866; then as superintendent of the Lehigh and Susquehanna Railroad in 1868, next as superintendent of the Evansville, Henderson and Nashville Railroad in 1870, and finally, as superintendent of the Pittsburg, Cincinnati and St. Louis Railway from 1872 to 1875. Pitcairn then went back to school to study medicine, and following graduation from Hahnemann Medical College of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in 1880, spent two years in post graduate study at the Universities of Berlin and Vienna. He then practiced medicine in Harrisburg from 1880 to 1897. In 1875, Pitcairn purchased a half interest the Altoona Tribune, a Pennsylvania daily newspaper. He was to retain this share until his death. ==Political career== A Republican, Pitcairn was quite active in local and state politics. On July 28, 1897, he was appointed by President William McKinley to the post of consul to Hamburg. He was promoted by President Theodore Roosevelt to the post of consul general on January 5, 1903, and confirmed by the U.S. Senate on February 12, 1903. He was the first person to hold this post for Hamburg. He retired from the consulate in November, 1908, to the reported regret of the citizens of Hamburg, in order to devote his full attention to the practice of medicine and his duties as partial owner of the Altoona Tribune. ==Later life and death== Pitcairn died in Hamburg, on July 19, 1911.

It was conceived of and edited by Matt Weiland and Sean Wilsey. ==Background== Weiland and Wilsey stated that they were inspired by the Federal Writers Project of the 1930s, in which the US government helped to create jobs by sending writers across the country and commissioning pieces on their sights and experiences. The two previously edited Thinking Fan's Guide to the World Cup, in which they commissioned 32 authors to write pieces on the 32 countries competing in the 2006 World Cup; they decided a similar approach could be taken with the United States. Both Weiland and Wilsey decided that they wanted a mixture of approaches for the collection; while several well-known authors (e.g., Ha Jin, Jhumpa Lahiri, Dave Eggers) were included, they deliberately avoided certain authors that were closely associated with a particular state - for instance, Garrison Keillor with Minnesota, or Carl Hiaasen with Florida. The collection has a mix of familiarity, with some authors writing about places in which they have lived their entire lives, while others visited the state for the first time. ==Editing Process== Editors Matt Weiland and Sean Wilsey both agree that they were heavy, interactive editors. ‚ÄúI mean no dishonor to any of the writers to say that we worked very closely with them all to revise as much as possible, to make every piece as lasting and solid and convincing as possible,‚Äù Weiland told Bookslut. ‚ÄúAnd I take great pride in that kind of work. I‚Äôve done it on The Baffler and on Granta and now at The Paris Review. And to Sean, likewise, that means a lot to him‚Äîhe did it at The New Yorker and continues to do it for McSweeney‚Äôs....I think [the writers] saw very quickly we wanted to make a book that would still be read decades from now...and that meant...not even taking their A-minus work, but pushing them for their absolute best.‚Äù Each essay, Weiland said, went through at least six rounds of edits. ==Editorial Point of View== Weiland told Bookslut that State by State had served for both its editors as ‚Äúa kind of reminder of the many things we [as Americans] have to be confident about.... Despite many reasons not to feel optimistic, chiefly during the last eight years of the Bush administration‚Äîdeep down, I think we‚Äôre all right.‚Äù Wilsey told Brooklyn Rail that he was sorry the late David Foster Wallace had declined to be in the book: ‚ÄúNobody gets at what makes America the extravagantly sad country it is like Wallace did.‚Äù Asked whether he hates any states, Wilsey replied, ‚ÄúI hate Maine. I hate New England. It‚Äôs so claustrophobic, no vistas, the landscape is constantly choking you. The people in New England just don‚Äôt seem kind; they‚Äôre all hardened and beaten down by the harsh winters. As a Californian, you‚Äôre not always kind, but you're always nice, and within the framework of niceness you can either be mellow or stoked. I‚Äôm a stoked Californian. New England somehow flattens that. Granted, I went to boarding school there for three years, and those were some of the worst years of my life, so that‚Äôs probably a big part of my dislike for it.‚Äù ==Presentation to Barack Obama== As he documented in an essay for the Guardian, Sean Wilsey personally presented a copy of State by State to Barack Obama in late 2008. Wilsey was invited to attend an event after donating his portion of the advance for the book to Obama‚Äôs campaign. ‚ÄúWhen he turned to shake my hand, for some reason I chose to address him by his first name, saying, ‚ÄòBarack, I brought you this book.‚Äô‚Äù Six photographs were taken of the handover. ‚ÄúAs I handed it to him I was thinking we, all of us, did this for you. I think you can see that in the [accompanying] picture.‚Äù Obama was very interested in the book and began reading it in front of Wilsey. ==Distribution to Schools and Related Coverage== Select institutions received complimentary copies of State by State. Many educators received the book with respectful interest and enthusiasm. On the website The Millions, a teacher asked whether he should assign the book in his 21st century literature class. It was one of four tomes he was considering; the others were ‚Äú[Charles] Bock‚Äôs Beautiful Children, [Joshua] Ferris‚Äô Then We Came To The End, and Brock Clarke‚Äôs An Arsonist‚Äôs Guide to Writers‚Äô Homes in New England‚Ä¶. ‚ÄúMy students are really intelligent, and so just about anything is fair game.‚Äù Millions contributor Edan Lepucki responded, ‚ÄúOf the four you‚Äôre considering teaching, I think State by State is the best, since it showcases so many great writers. While I enjoyed Joshua Ferris‚Äôs Then We Came to the End, I think a workplace narrative would be lost on most teenagers.‚Äù Professor Tyler Cowen, on the site Marginal Revolution: Small Steps to a Much Better World, noted that he was thinking of assigning State by State to his graduate students at Berlin‚Äôs Freie Universit√§t along with Alexis de Tocqueville‚Äôs Democracy in America. Manhattan‚Äôs progressive Calhoun School used State by State for its Upper School students in 2012 as required summer reading. The school assigned fifteen essays, two of which are graphic essays, or comic strips. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs interesting material in every essay and we are certain that this book will spark a wide variety of interesting conversations between students, teachers and parents,‚Äù the school noted on its website. Matt Weiland and two of his writers were hosted by a Milwaukee high school for a reading at an assembly. ‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt sure what high school students would make of it, but we were careful to select the pieces with the most drinking and the most sex,‚Äù Weiland told Bookslut. Columbia, the alumni magazine of Columbia University, of which Weiland is a graduate, profiled him in an article called ‚ÄúThis Land is Weiland\\" and praised him as ‚Äúa consummate intellectual.‚Äù ==Essays== * Alabama - George Packer * Alaska - Paul Greenberg * Arizona - Lydia Millet * Arkansas - Kevin Brockmeier * California - William T.

It was established in 1942 and is one of the oldest engineering colleges for Chemical Engineering and Technology in India. Similar to the other institutes of technology in India, LIT offers courses after the 10+2 level (Bachelors: BTech) and postgraduate courses like MTech and PhD ==History== The Laxminarayan Institute of Technology is the only engineering college directly managed by the Nagpur University. The land, donated by Rao Bahadur D. Laxminarayan, houses both the Nagpur University and the Institute. The Laxminarayan Institute of Technology was founded in 1942 by Laxminarayan of Kamptee. His work brought him into contact with complex problems that required the aid of technologists. He believed the lack of qualified thinkers should not stand in the way of progress, so he donated the main part of his property, then estimated at ‚Çπ 3,520,540 to the Nagpur University in his will dated 3 May 1930, for \\"Teaching of Applied Science and Chemistry\\".http://www.the- laws.com/Encyclopedia/Browse/Case?CaseId=319891416000 Subsequently, a committee was appointed by Nagpur University on 6 February 1932, known as the \\"Bequest Scheme Committee\\", that consisted of notable men from the fields of science, industry, and public affairs throughout India. The committee recommended establishing an Institute of Technology to teach industrial chemistry with particular emphasis on the application of science to the industrial development of the province, then known as the Central Provinces and Berar. In 1934, the scheme was prepared for starting a two-year BSc (Tech) course. The present site for the Institute was selected in the year 1936 by Harisingh Gour. In 1937, the University appointed Ram Simha Thakur as the officer-on-special duty to oversee the construction of the Institute. The Institute started functioning with admissions into a two-year BSc (Tech) program in Chemical Engineering, Chemical Technology, and Oil Technology on 1 August 1942 with S.A. Saletore, Professor of Organic Chemistry (Applied) as Director-in-Charge. It was officially inaugurated on 9 January 1943 by N.R. Sirkar. The development from 1942 to 1947 was not very noteworthy because of World War II. However, the students' numbers increased to 34, and 11 members of the staff were appointed. On 28 July 1945, the Executive Committee of the Nagpur University appointed R. B. Forster, the then-Head of the Department of Chemical Technology at the University of Bombay as Director of the Institute. Ing. H. G. Kayser took over as the Director in 1950, succeeded by P. S. Mene in 1951. The number of admissions increased to 36 and the four-year degree course started in 1951. The courses of study were revised to provide for more intensive specializations. In 1959, the Ministry of Education recommended a recurring grant for the building and equipment. The AICTE (All India Council for Technical Education) decided to increase the intake of engineering graduates in all institutions and recommended that the Laxminarayan Institute of Technology should admit 60 students instead of 36 and start a 5 Year Integrated Course in Chemical Engineering. In 1969, the University Grants Commission (UGC) gave an additional grant for starting a three-year BSc (Tech) course in Oil Technology. The Institute took in sixty students to start the Five Year Integrated Course in 1967. During these years, the post-graduate degrees of Nagpur University in the field of Technology were awarded on the basis of a research thesis. The MTech courses (Petro-Chemical Technology, Oil Technology, Paint Technology, and Chemical Engineering) began in 1967 and were pursued more in 1969. The institute introduced two new courses in 1971: three- year programs in Food and Petro-chemical Technology. In 1976, a BSc Technology. course in Cellulose Technology was introduced. In response to the new educational pattern of 10+2, the Institute introduced a Four Year BTech (Chemical Engineering) course and the first set of students were admitted in 1977. In 1994, the Institute discontinued its BSc.Tech. course and replaced it with a new BTech course in Chemical Technology with a specialization in Petrochemical Technology, Food Technology, Pulp & Paper Technology, Oil Technology, and Plastic & Polymer Technology. Presently, the Institute offers a Four Year BTech (Chemical Engineering) program, Four Year BTech program in Chemical Technology with areas of specialization such as Petrochemical Technology, Food Technology, Pulp & Paper Technology, Oil Technology, Plastic & Polymer Technology, and Surface Coating Technology. In 2018-2019 LIT admitted all prospective students, compared to the 45% placement nationwide average for the same period. ==Admissions== Admissions to the undergraduate course are done through the Maharashtra Health and Technical Common Entrance Test.

An open Jewish community did not flourish in the colony because Judaism was prohibited by the Spanish Inquisition. However, many migrated to mountainous parts of the island, far from the central power of San Juan, and continued to self-identify as Jews and practice Crypto-Judaism.Destination the New WorldPuerto Rico Virtual Jewish History Tour It would be hundreds of years before an open Jewish community was established on the island. Very few American Jews settled in Puerto Rico after it was ceded by Spain to the United States under the terms of the 1898 Treaty of Paris, which ended the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. The first large group of Jews to settle in Puerto Rico were refugees fleeing German‚Äìoccupied Europe in the 1930s and 1940s. The second influx came in the 1950s, when thousands of Cuban Jews (most of Eastern-European descent) fled after Fidel Castro came to power. The majority immigrated to Miami, Florida, but a sizable portion chose to establish and integrate themselves on the neighboring island because of Puerto Rico's cultural, linguistic, racial, and historic similarities to Cuba. Puerto Rican Jews have made many contributions in multiple fields, including business, commerce, education, and entertainment. Puerto Rico has the largest Jewish community in the Caribbean, with over 3,000 Jewish inhabitants. It is also the only Caribbean island in which all three major Jewish denominations--Orthodox, Conservative, and Reform --are represented. ==First Jews to arrive in Puerto Rico== According to historians, the first Jews to arrive in Puerto Rico were conversos, Jews who were forced to convert to Catholicism and were members of Christopher Columbus's crew during his second voyage to the so-called \\"New World\\", arriving in Puerto Rico on November 19, 1493. Historians believe that Luis de Torres, who spoke Hebrew among other languages and who accompanied Columbus as his interpreter, was the first \\"converso\\" Jew to set foot in Puerto Rico. The Jews who arrived and settled in Puerto Rico were referred to as \\"Crypto-Jews\\" or \\"secret Jews\\". In 1478, the Catholic Monarchs of Spain, Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile, established an ecclesiastical tribunal known as the Spanish Inquisition. It was intended to maintain Catholic orthodoxy in their kingdoms.Homza, Lu Ann (2006). The Spanish Inquisition, 1478-1614; Page xxv, Hackett Publishing, . Hundreds of Jews were killed, and their synagogues destroyed. One of the consequences of these disturbances was the mass forced conversion of Jews.Kamen, Henry (1999). The Spanish Inquisition, p. 17, Yale University Press, When the Crypto Jews arrived on the island of Puerto Rico, they were hoping to avoid religious scrutiny, but the Inquisition followed the colonists. The Inquisition maintained no rota or religious court in Puerto Rico. However, heretics were written up and if necessary remanded to regional Inquisitional tribunals in Spain or elsewhere in the Western Hemisphere. As a result, many secret Jews settled the island's remote mountainous interior far from the concentrated centers of power in San Juan and lived quiet lives. They practiced Crypto-Judaism which meant that they secretly practiced Judaism while publicly professing to be Roman Catholic.Jacobs, J. (2002). Hidden Heritage: The Legacy of the Crypto-Jews, University of California Press, , OCLC 48920842. Still, since Jews weren't permitted to worship, the Crypto Jews eventually intermarried with Catholics and therefore, Puerto Rico virtually had no Jewish history of which to speak.Jewish Life Emerging, Jewish News, Retrieved November 12, 2008. ==19th century== Mathias Brugman By the 19th century, the Spanish Crown had lost most of its possessions in the Americas. Two of its remaining possessions were Puerto Rico and Cuba, both of which were demanding more autonomy and had pro-independence movements. The Spanish Crown issued the Royal Decree of Graces (Real C√©dula de Gracias) which was originated August 10, 1815, with the intention of attracting European settlers who were not of Spanish origin to the islands. The Spanish government, believing that the independence movements would lose their popularity, granted land and initially gave settlers \\"Letters of Domicile\\". However, those Europeans who were of the Jewish and Protestant faith were excluded from direct acquisition of state land since it was expected of the settlers to swear loyalty to the Spanish Crown and allegiance to the Roman Catholic Church. The opening of new lands to Catholics resulted in some sales of existing cultivated lands to others. This, however, did not keep people of Jewish descent from settling in Puerto Rico. Among the Puerto Rican Jews who lived in Puerto Rico in the 19th century was Mathias Brugman. Mathias Brugman (1811‚Äì1868) was the son of Pierre Brugman from Cura√ßao of Dutch-Jewish ancestry and Isabel Duliebre from Puerto Rico. His parents met and married in New Orleans, Louisiana where Brugman was born, raised and educated.Acosta, Ursula. \\"Puerto Rico y Curazao: The Brugman Family\\", University of Puerto Rico, Mayag√ºez Campus, XIII, 1/2. 1993, p. 41, Retrieved November 12, 2008. The Brugman family moved to Puerto Rico and settled in the City of Mayag√ºez where Brugman met and married Ana Maria Laborde. He opened a colmado (grocery store) and became rather successful, only to lose a good part of his fortune attempting to grow coffee. Like many other residents of Puerto Rico at the time, he resented the political injustices practiced by Spain on the island. This led him to become a believer in the cause of the Puerto Rican independence movement. Brugman admired independence advocates Ram√≥n Emeterio Betances and Segundo Ruiz Belvis. Together with his son, Hector, he joined them in a conspiracy to revolt against Spain and formed a revolutionary committee code named: \\"Cap√° Prieto\\" (a tree known as Spanish Elm, Ecuador Laurel, cypre or salmwood and used for its wood to build ships, among other things). On September 23, 1868, Brugman and his son participated in the short- lived revolt against Spanish rule known as El \\"Grito de Lares\\" (English: Cry of Lares). Brugman and his son refused to surrender to the Spanish authorities and eventually were executed. After the failed revolution, the Spanish Courts passed the \\"Acta de Culto Condicionado\\" (Conditional Cult Act) in 1870. The law was an attempt to attract more settlers who would be faithful to the Spanish Crown by granting the right of religious freedom to all who wished to worship a religion other than Catholicism.Wilhelmsen, Alexandra. \\"Carlism's Defense of the Church in Spain, 1833-1936\\", Retrieved November 12, 2008.

In the late 1800s during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War many Jewish American servicemen gathered together with local Puerto Rican Jews at the Old Telegraph building in Ponce to hold religious services.El Vocero, Suplemento: 40 Aniversario del Estado de Israel, seccion: Judios de PR, 1988 pg.6 ==20th century1930s=== Jewish-American soldiers were assigned to the military bases in Puerto Rico and many choose to stay and live on the island. Large numbers of Jewish immigrants began to arrive in Puerto Rico in the 1930s as refugees from Nazi occupied Europe. The majority settled in the island's capital, San Juan, where in 1942 they established the first Jewish Community Center of Puerto Rico. ===1940s=== The President of the Puerto Rican Senate, Luis Mu√±oz Mar√≠nPuerto Rican Labor Movement, Center for History and New Media, George Mason University, Retrieved December 11, 2008. together with Governor Rexford Tugwell, the last non-Puerto Rican Governor of Puerto Rico appointed by an American president, helped advance legislation geared towards agricultural reform, economic recovery and industrialization. This program became known as Operation Bootstrap. As a result of the program, many Jews migrated to the city of Ponce located in the southern region of the island and worked in the agricultural industry. Operation Bootstrap also attracted clothing manufacturers from New York and many of the people in the industry who came to the island were Jews. In 1942, President Franklin D. Roosevelt appointed Aaron Cecil Snyder (1907‚Äì1959), born in Baltimore, Maryland as Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico. Snyder became the first Jew and the last non-Puerto Rican appointed to that court. In 1953, Governor Luis Mu√±oz Mar√≠n appointed him Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico, the first appointment that a Puerto Rican governor made to the court, addressing the nomination to \\"A. Cecilio Snyder\\". Snyder actually used the name \\"Cecilio\\" when sworn in as Chief Justice. After his departure from the court, Snyder practiced law in San Juan until his death in 1959.Rivera, Luis Rafael (2007).

After the success of the Cuban Revolution, led by Fidel Castro in 1959, almost all of Cuba's 15,000 Jews went into exile. The majority of them fled to Miami, Florida; however, Puerto Rico also received a large influx of Jewish emigres from Cuba. Abe Fortas, who was an associate judge for the United States Supreme Court, and the son of Orthodox Jews, was a friend of Luis Mu√±oz Marin and frequented Puerto Rico often during Roosevelt's, Kennedy's, and Lyndon B. Johnson's administrations. He participated in the drafting of the Constitution of Puerto Rico and gave Luis Mu√±oz Marin and his administrators legal advice whenever called upon. According to Abe Fortas's biographer Laura Kalman, \\"Puerto Rico engaged Fortas. It became the one cause to which he was unconditionally committed.\\" ==Establishment of a Jewish community== Inside Sha'are Zedeck Puerto Rico is home to the largest and wealthiest Jewish community in the Caribbean with almost 3,000 Jewish inhabitants. Some Puerto Ricans have converted to Judaism, not only as individuals but as entire families. Puerto Rico is the only Caribbean island in which the Conservative, Reform and Orthodox Jewish movements are represented. Sha'are Zedeck, established in 1953, represents Conservative Judaism; Beth Shalom, established in 1967, represents Reform Judaism; and Chabad Center, established in 1997, represents Orthodox Judaism. The Reform congregation utilizes the English and Hebrew languages in their teachings, while the Conservative congregation uses English,Hebrew and Spanish. On November 30, 2005, the Puerto Rican Jewish community established their first synagogue outside of the Metropolitan San Juan area.

The Auta tribal chief in death throes vows vengeance against Silla, and their blood and resentment fill the place where the Sacred Tree was standing, and turns into a lake. To seal off the Auta tribe's force of sorcery, he drives his Holy Sword deep into the Sacred Tree. The narrative resumes nearly one millennium later, circa A.D. 896, as Silla is showing symptoms of strain and the court is beset by constant rebellions. Queen Jinseong (Kim Hye-ri), troubled by the threats to the throne, leans on General Biharang (Jung Joon-ho) against the counsels of her ministers. Biharang strives to save the country, but he is also weary of the endless battles. He, however, spurns the Queen‚Äôs romantic attentions in favor of his betrothed Jaunbi (Kim Hyo-jin), the daughter of an executed rebel, with whom he wishes to settle down and lead a quiet, peaceful life. While Biharang has left for the country‚Äôs border to quench the rebels, Jaunbi is chased by assassins who were ordered by the Minister Mun-su to kill her. In panic, Jaunbi removes the Sword from the Sacred Tree thus releasing the soul of Auta tribal chief. But the assassins easily overpower her and try to rape her. Jaunbi somehow slips away from their hands and reaches at the edge of the Evil Lake. She throws herself into the Lake before leaving her necklace there as a sign for Biharang that she is dead. The spirit of the Auta tribe who are resentful of the Silla kingdom use Jaunbi‚Äôs body to take their revenge on Silla. She is transformed into a flying phantasm with superpowers and seeks to lay waste to Seorabeol, capital of Silla.

He was most prominent for his involvement with the Greater London Council (GLC) from 1973 until its dissolution in 1985. ==Background== Stonefrost was born in Bristol and attended Merrywood Grammar School. He did National Service with the RAF from 1948‚Äì51. After that he worked for several local authorities, starting in Bristol before moving to Slough in 1954, Coventry in 1956, and West Sussex in 1961. From 1964 to 1973 he worked as the secretary for the Institute of Municipal Treasurers and Accountants. ==Greater London Council== From 1973‚Äì77 he worked with the Labour administration under Sir Reg Goodwin to keep London out of the financial problems that plagued New York City. From 1977‚Äì81 he managed the finances for the GLC under the Conservative administration led by Horace Cutler. He achieved his greatest prominence under the Labour administration that began in 1981 under Ken Livingstone by allowing the city government to pursue its political goals within a feasible budget. Additionally, he was able to get his officials to manipulate the central government's local financing scheme to obtain ¬£200m of additional financing from other governmental agencies. He also argued strongly against the dissolution of the GLC because of the resulting \\"fragmentation and chaos\\" that would result for the other London governmental agencies and the increased cost of borrowing money for each of those agencies. ==After the Greater London Council== After the GLC was dissolved in 1985 he led an investigation into the Liverpool City Council's near bankruptcy and recommended stabilizing its finances by halting hiring, raising rents and tax rates, and reorganizing its debt obligations. From 1986‚Äì90 he was Chief Executive Officer of the British Rail Pension Fund (BRPF). He was involved with the sale of a collection of fine art owned by the BRPF after fine art prices rose in the 1980s. Although Labour Party Shadow Arts Minister Mark Fisher objected to the possibility that the collection might leave Britain, Stonefrost maintained the most important outcome was receiving the highest price for the works. From 1990‚Äì93 he was chairman of Municipal Mutual Insurance (MMI). MMI had been a primary insurer of local governments in Britain but had expanded to also insure cars and homes. When he joined, MMI had become overexposed to problems relating to school arson attacks and general financial market problems and he engineered a sale to Zurich Insurance in 1993. ==References== Category:Local government officers in England Category:Businesspeople in insurance Category:English chief executives Category:People from Bristol Category:Greater London Council Category:1927 births Category:2008 deaths Category:People educated at Merrywood Grammar School ","title":"Maurice Stonefrost"},{"id":"20161931","text":"This is a list of Russian military accidents that took place in Russia after the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991.

Jeffries Jr. (April 3, 1900 ‚Äì April 2, 1950) was an American politician, councilman, and mayor of Detroit. ==Early life== Edward Jeffries was born in Detroit, Michigan, on April 3, 1900, the son of Judge Edward J. Jeffries and Minnie Stott Jeffries. The elder Jeffries was an alderman, a police justice, and a long-serving judge on the Recorder's Court. He had run unsuccessfully for mayor multiple times, seeing himself as a representative of the underclass, and instilled in the younger Jeffries a sense of civic responsibility. The younger Jeffries attended the Detroit Public Schools and the University of Michigan, receiving a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Michigan in 1920 and a law degree from the University of Michigan Law School in 1923. He then continued his education at Lincoln's Inn in London in 1923 and 1924, studying Roman and British common law. After his tour in Europe, Jeffries returned to Detroit to take up law practice. In 1929, he became general counsel for Royal Maccabees Insurance, a position he held until his death in 1950. In 1930, Jeffries married Florence O. Bell. ==Politics== Jeffries ran for Detroit City Council in 1932, and served on that body for four terms, from 1932 until 1940, serving the last two as City Council president. While serving on the Council, Jeffries came under the influence of long-time councilman John C. Lodge. Jeffries was already more moderate in stance than his radical father, eager to work within the existing power structure, and Lodge, who shared a similar outlook, was a natural ally. In 1939, Jeffries ran for mayor of Detroit against Richard Reading as an economically conservative, socially responsible reformer. Reading, enmeshed in an enormous corruption scandal that eventually sent him to jail, lost the election by more than two-to-one. He ran for election as mayor four more times, winning the next three to serve as mayor from 1940 to 1948. Jeffries bid for a fifth term was unsuccessful because of his unpopularity in the wake of the 1943 race riot, and he lost to councilman Eugene Van Antwerp. Jeffries was elected once more to serve on the City Council, beginning in 1950, but died in office. Edward Jeffries suffered a heart attack on March 18, 1950, while on vacation in Miami Beach, Florida. He died shortly thereafter on April 2, 1950. The section of I-96 in Livonia and Detroit is named in Jeffries' honor. ==References== Category:1900 births Category:1950 deaths Category:Mayors of Detroit Category:Detroit City Council members Category:University of Michigan Law School alumni Category:Michigan lawyers Category:20th-century American lawyers Category:20th-century American politicians ","title":"Edward Jeffries"},{"id":"20162111","text":"is a former Japanese football player and manager. ==Playing career== Kurihara was born in Ota, Tokyo on May 20, 1973.

The West Terrace Cemetery is South Australia's oldest cemetery, first appearing on Colonel William Light's 1837 plan of Adelaide. The site is located in Park 23 of the Adelaide Park Lands just south-west of the Adelaide city centre, between West Terrace, Anzac Highway, Sir Donald Bradman Drive and the Seaford and Belair railway lines. Originally known as the Adelaide Public Cemetery, it is divided into a number of sections for various communities and faiths, including two Catholic areas, as well as Jewish, Afghan, Islamic and Quaker sections. ==History== The Adelaide Park Lands were laid out by Colonel William Light in his design for the city. Originally, Light reserved 2,300 acres for a park, and a further for a public cemetery. Throughout much of its early history the West Terrace Cemetery was plagued with controversy and mismanagement. It was the subject of much public and religious debate and was many times under threat of closure. As early as the 1880s the size of the cemetery was considered insufficient to keep up with demand. In 1843 the establishment of a Jewish burial area began the distinctive denominational division of the cemetery. In 1845 a Catholic cemetery was established on land adjacent the main public cemetery and in 1849 a third of the public cemetery was given over to the Church of England.West Terrace Cemetery History, Adelaide Cemeteries Authority The Smyth Chapel was built in 1871 as a memorial to the Very Reverend Dr John Smyth, Vicar General, who lies buried in the crypt beneath the chapel. It was designed by E. J. Woods in the latter part of 1870 as a result of a competition conducted by the Smyth Memorial Fund and built by Peters and Jones for approximately 472 pounds. Situated within the Catholic area, the foundation stone was laid on 18 December 1870 by the venerable Archdeacon Russell, Vicar General, and was officially opened and formally consecrated on 22 October 1871.Smyth Chapel, Adelaide Cemeteries Authority In 1902, the first crematorium in the southern hemisphere was built and began operating in 1903. For the next 20 years, this was the only crematorium in Australia. A number of famous and important South Australians have been buried in the cemetery and since 2002, the site has been administered by the Adelaide Cemeteries Authority, which also controls a number of other cemeteries within the metropolitan area. ==War gravesAIF Cemetery=== With concerns from various patriotic associations about soldiers from the First World War without relatives being buried in unmarked graves in the cemetery, a deputation to the Minister of Public Works in February 1920 sought a \\"Soldiers Lot\\" not only for these soldiers but also those whose families wished to bury their \\"soldier loved ones\\" there. The minister set aside a half an acre of the Light Oval for this purpose, with a monument to be erected by public subscription and soldiers in unmarked graves to be re- interred there. The first burial was in March 1920 but with slow progress of public fund raising the area was not dedicated until Sunday 10 December 1922. There are buried (at June 2014) 275 Commonwealth service personnel from both World Wars in West Terrace Cemetery whose graves are registered by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission.Adelaide (West Terrace) Cemetery, CWGC Cemetery Report. ==Notable interments or cremations== * William and Ann Margaret Bickford, manufacturing chemists * Arthur Seaforth Blackburn, military officer and Victoria Cross recipient from the First World War * Abraham Tobias Boas, long serving Rabbi of Adelaide's Jewish congregation * James Bonnin, London property developer * Poltpalingada Booboorowie (Tommy Walker), a Ngarrindjeri Aboriginal and popular Adelaide personality in the 1890s * Charles Campbell, early settler, pastoralist and founder of Campbelltown * Charles Chewings, geologist and anthropologist * Sir Dominick Daly, 7th Governor of South Australia * Phillip Davey, Victoria Cross recipient from the First World War * J.

He was a founder of the City of Cork Co-operative Society (also serving as the society's secretary), and was the editor of The Cork Co- Operator publication. He was also manager and secretary of the Cork Co- operative Bakery Society. He was an organiser for the Labour Party in Cork, a trade unionist and one of a number of early Labour parliamentarians to promote Christian socialism. He was also elected to both Cork Corporation and Cork County Council in 1942. == Early life == Timothy Quill was born to Daniel and Mary Quill in Clondrohid, Macroom, County Cork, on 9 May 1901. He had five siblings in total, all brothers. Initially living in Macroom, he moved to Cork City with his wife and young family, and in 1936 was living near Victoria Cross. Before his time in the co-operative movement, he was involved in the insurance business. ==Political career Branch Secretary and District Executive === Quill began his Labour career as Secretary of the Macroom Labour Branch and District Executive. By the 1930s he was involved in the councils of the Labour Party. === 1927 elections ===  June 1927 general election  After the 1923 general election, the sitting members of D√°il √âireann in the then recently created Cork North constituency were Daniel Corkery (Republican), Daniel Vaughan (Farmers‚Äô Party) and Thomas Nagle (Labour). Quill was a councillor on Cork County Council at the time, having been elected in 1925. It has been said that he was recruited into the party by Labour politician and fellow Clondrohid native T.J Murphy. Quill was 26 years old going into his first general election on 9 June 1927 and was one of 44 Labour candidates in total. While campaigning, Quill described himself as a \\"temperate man\\". In June 1927, at a meeting in North Cork, Quill outlined what he believed the Labour Party stood for. Referring to the level of unemployment, he spoke about the \\"right to work\\" and the government's perceived failing of \\"humbler people\\" over the \\"well-to-do class\\". Quill was elected as a Labour Party Teachta D√°la (TD) for the Cork North constituency at the June 1927 general election, receiving 18% of first preference votes. Slogans, such as 'Be Labour This Time' and 'Away With Slums & Mud Cabins' were featured on his election posters. Quill won 4,165 first preference votes (17.9%) finishing second place to Daniel Corkery and taking the last seat in the constituency after Vaughan received transfers from his running mate, Daniel Forde. He was the youngest member of the 5th Dail. He was an opponent of the 1927 Public Safety Act, and spoke against it during a debate on the bill in August 1927; Coincidentally, the Public Safety Act resulted in the conviction of Herbert Mitchell from Kerry Pike, the father of one of his future daughters-in-law, whom was sentenced to 12 months of hard labour in 1929 for being a member of the IRA. At the time, in the late 1920s, the IRA was perceived as a threat to the Free State by Cumann na nGaedheal, which largely encouraged them to introduce the Act. On 5 July 1927, in the committee on finance regarding old age pensions, he opposed the methods and harsh manner of pensions officers. Quill was criticised in a reader's letter to the Irish Independent on 7 July 1927.  September 1927 general election  Quill lost his seat at the September 1927 general election. Daniel Corkery topped the poll under the Fianna F√°il banner with a 30% share of first preference votes, followed closely by new Cumann na nGaedheal candidate and rival Daniel O'Leary, taking a 27.4% share of first preferences. Quill received 4,123 first preference votes. Despite receiving only 42 fewer votes than he did in June of that year, his percentage share dropped to 16%. As a result of this, he only served three months as a TD. The number of Labour candidates was almost halved, down from 44 to 28. T. D. Keating of the IT&GWU; said that it was regrettable that Quill was not re-elected. Speaking on the heavy defeat for Labour in the September 1927 election, T. J. Murphy regretted that the party had lost men like Tom Johnson, who, \\"because of his industry and ability, would receive a place of honour in any Parliament in the world, and young men of the ability and honesty of Mr. Quill, who had been defeated in North Cork by a mere handful of votes, after making a marvellous fight against a combination of influences\\". === 1930s general elections === Quill did not contest the 1932 general election, declining to stand at a convention in Millstreet, Cork. According to The Southern Star, it was thought Quill would be the chosen candidate, but, according to the newspaper's columnist, had \\"to a certain extent, lost touch with the electors of this division and he declined to accept the honour\\". According to the Cork Examiner, having been proposed and seconded, Quill declined the nomination and asked \\"that some other candidate [..] be proposed\\". In a letter published in The Southern Star in June 1933, Quill labelled criticisms leveled against him and the Labour movement as 'ignorant'. Quill contested the 1937 general election as a sitting city councillor on the Cork Corporation, as one of 23 Labour candidates, receiving 14.9% of first preference votes, but was not elected. He ran again in the 1938 general election, this time as one of 30 Labour candidates, receiving 4,950 first preference votes (12.6%), but was once again not elected. This was to be his last general election campaign, however he would remain as an elected city councillor on Cork Corporation. === County Councillor === According to A Biographical Dictionary of Cork, by Tim Cadogan and Jeremiah Falvey, Quill served as a councillor on Cork County Council for two periods. As a Transport member, he was nominated and won a seat in 1925, retaining his seat in 1928 and lost the seat in 1934, before winning a seat again in 1942 and serving until 1945. An article from 1936 states that he was the Chairman of the Cork County Executive of the Labour Party. === City councillor === Quill also served as a city councillor with Cork Corporation. The City Councillor's 1920‚Äì1945 roll book seems to record that T Quill was elected in 1936. In 1939, he is listed as a member of the Labour Party's Cork Centre Branch. It has been said that the local Labour Party branch held a committee meeting every Friday night during the 1940s. There was a local election in the city almost every year from 1929 to 1936 to elect portions of the city council and others in 1942 and 1945. Quill was at one time a member of the South Cork Board of Public Assistance. He is still listed as a councillor in this book in 1944‚Äì1945. While resident in the city he contested the local election for the Corporation, winning a seat in 1942, serving on both the Corporation and the County Council at the same time. === Allegations of antisemitism === During the 1940s, Quill became chair of the Liam Mellows Branch of the Labour Party. In this capacity he proved to be an enemy of Michael O'Riordan. O'Riordan asserted that Quill was imposed as chair to ensure that Labour in Cork City could control the new branch. O'Riordan also stated that Quill had made an attack on what Quill \\"called 'the Jew boys' of Cork\\". Specifically, in a speech to the 2001 Labour Party Conference, O'Riordan stated that:Speech by Michael O'Riordan to the Irish Labour Party Conference (Cork, 2001) A report in the Irish Press suggests that the Administrative Council 'had become aware that certain persons in Cork were engaging in activities which appear to be inconsistent with their membership of the Labour Party and accordingly they appointed a subcommittee to investigate the membership and administration of the Liam Mellows Branch'. This was headed up by vice-chair, TJ Murphy. They heard the complaint against O'Riordan and Nagle being present at the (NI) Communist Party conference. O'Riordan maintained that he had only attended to meet former comrades socially. Following an investigation, the committee recommended the expulsion of both and the decision was approved of by the Parliamentary Party. The two Cork members were expelled on 5 February 1944 and the four Dublin members expelled in April. It is clear that Timothy Quill, as a theologian and Christian Socialist held strong anti-Soviet views as possibly anti-Semitic views. The perceived threat of Soviet communism was perhaps the reason that Timothy Quill was nominated as Chair of the Liam Mellows Branch. === Retirement from electoral politics === Quill did not contest the 1950 Cork Corporation election and did not stand for election again. He did, however, remain involved in the co-operative movement until 1954. == Co-operative movement == During the 1920s, Quill established the City of Cork Co-operative Society with Con Desmond. Quill was the secretary of the City of Cork Co- operative Society and manager and secretary of the Cork Co-operative Bakery Society. This included social enterprises such as Cooperative Tea, Cooperative Bread, Cooperative Baking Powder and Cooperative Cream. He was also a member of the Cork Co-operators' Guild. He was also the editor of The Cork Co- Operator, a monthly publication of the co-operative movement in Cork. The paper attracted the attention of Steve Denny, the director of the London Co- operative Society (England's largest co-op society at the time). In a letter to the editor, published on the cover of the June 1939 issue, Denny described the publication as a 'bright little paper'.Cork Co-Operator, June 1939, Page 1, Letter from Director of England's biggest Co-operative Society Quill frequently attended the Co-operative Congress in the UK throughout the 1930s and 1940s. Inspired by Robert Owen, he built cottages for the workers on his land. Quill regarded himself as a Christian Socialist. He resigned his position in the co-operative movement in 1954. These societies were defunct by the time of his death in 1960. == Personal life == He married Mary McCarthy on 7 January 1930. In the 1940s, Quill lived at Ferney House in Blackrock, Cork, where he grew vegetables and kept livestock. His first trial of Holstein Friesian cattle took place here. He became well known as an agriculturalist, and owned what The Southern Star described as \\"one of the largest and most successful herds in the country\\". He was used as an example in an 1950s advertisement titled 'Friesian T.T Herd Makes History', and served as the honorary secretary of the Irish Friesian Society. As well as being an active member of the Munster Agricultural Society, he wrote a farming column for The Cork Examiner, and contributed to the farming pages of The Evening Echo under the pen name 'Carrigeen'. By the late 1950s he had settled at a property near Blarney, left politics and was Chair of the Blarney National Farmer's Association. He died on 10 June 1960, aged 59 and was buried in St. Finbarr's Cemetery. In an obituary published on 11 June 1960, the Evening Echo described him as an \\" writer on agricultural matters\\". The Timothy Quill Perpetual Challenge Cup for the MAS (Munster Agricultural Society) Holstein Friesian Senior Cow Class at Cork Summer Show is named after him. ==References * Category:1901 births Category:1960 deaths Category:Labour Party (Ireland) TDs Category:Members of the 5th D√°il Category:Politicians from County Cork ","title":"Timothy Quill"},{"id":"20162570","text":"is a Japanese football player who plays for Fujieda MYFC.http://www.jleague.jp/club/yamagata/player/detail/700772/ ==Club statistics== Updated to 1 January 2020.Nippon Sports Kikaku Publishing inc./Êó•Êú¨„Çπ„Éù„Éº„ÉÑ‰ºÅÁîªÂá∫ÁâàÁ§æ, \\"2017 J1&J2;&J3;ÈÅ∏ÊâãÂêçÈëë (NSK MOOK)\\", 8 February 2017, Japan, (p. 207 out of 289)Nippon Sports Kikaku Publishing inc./Êó•Êú¨„Çπ„Éù„Éº„ÉÑ‰ºÅÁîªÂá∫ÁâàÁ§æ, \\"2016J1&J2;&J3;ÈÅ∏ÊâãÂêçÈëë\\", 10 February 2016, Japan, (p. 167 out of 289) {  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" - ! colspan=3  Club performance ! colspan=2  League ! colspan=2  Cup ! colspan=2  League Cup ! colspan=2  Total - !

In the broadest sense, the entire work and purpose of the Petroleum Safety Authority Norway is to ensure that the petroleum activities are conducted prudently as regards health, environment and safety. The ministry has issued the following guidelines for how the PSA should carry out its tasks: Follow-up shall be system-oriented and risk-based. This follow-up must be in addition to, and not instead of, the follow-up which the industry carries out for its own part. There shall be a balanced consideration between the PSA's role as a high risk/technological supervisory body and as a labour inspection authority. Participation and cooperation between the parties are important principles and integral preconditions for the activities of the Petroleum Safety Authority Norway. ==Activities== In 2005, the PSA was made part of the Coexistence Group II working group, a joint project of the Norwegian government, the Institute of Marine Research, the Norwegian Fishermen's Association, the Norwegian Foundation for Nature Research and the Norwegian Oil Industry Association. Coexistence Group II's mission is to explore the feasibility of coexistence between the fishing and petroleum industries in Norwegian waters. The PSA also coordinates supervisory responsibility with Norway's national Health Examination Survey (HES). ==References *Official Petroleum Safety Authority Norway website‚Äî Category:Government agencies of Norway Category:Petroleum industry in Norway Category:Oil and gas law Category:Petroleum politics Category:Government agencies established in 2004 Category:2004 establishments in Norway Category:Petroleum in Norway Category:Safety organizations Category:Energy organizations ","title":"Petroleum Safety Authority Norway"},{"id":"20162603","text":"is a former Japanese football player. ==Club statistics== {  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" - ! colspan=3  Club performance ! colspan=2  League ! colspan=2  Cup ! colspan=2  League Cup ! colspan=2  Total - !

Later he played the Olsens' son (unrelated to the Olsen Gang), William Olsen in the Danish television series Huset p√• Christianshavn from 1970 to 1977 and the film based on the series Ballade p√• Christianshavn in 1971. As an adult Holts√∏ never pursued acting, though he did take part in the last Olsen Gang film, The Olsen Gang's Last Trick, as the adult B√∏rge. After having been a drug-addict and alcoholic for much of his youth, Holts√∏ is now clean, and has, himself, worked at an institution to help addicts. Since 2002, Holts√∏ has worked as a theater technician at the Royal Danish Theatre.

Phraya Songsuradet (Thai: ‡∏û‡∏£‡∏∞‡∏¢‡∏≤‡∏ó‡∏£‡∏á‡∏™‡∏∏‡∏£‡πÄ‡∏î‡∏ä) did not instigate the rebellion or coup, yet it was named after him. The coup was carried out by Plaek Phibunsongkhram (Thai: ‡∏´‡∏•‡∏ß‡∏á‡∏û‡∏¥‡∏ö‡∏π‡∏•‡∏™‡∏á‡∏Ñ‡∏£‡∏≤‡∏°) or \\"Phibun\\" on 29 January 1939 to purge the country of his political enemies and former rivals, one of whom happened to be Songsuradet. ==Background == Phraya Songsuradet, the rebellion's namesake Born in 1892 as Thep Panthumasen (Thai: ‡πÄ‡∏ó‡∏û ‡∏û‡∏±‡∏ô‡∏ò‡∏∏‡∏°‡πÄ‡∏™‡∏ô), Songsuradet was commissioned in the Royal Thai Army as an artillery lieutenant after graduating from the Chulachomklao Royal Military Academy and furthering his studies in Germany where he studied at the engineer school. He returned to Thailand in 1915. From then on he was given many responsibilities, especially the construction of railways. In 1932 he was given the title Phraya Songsuradet by King Prajadhipok (Rama VII). He played a crucial role in the Revolution of 1932 and subsequently became an important member of the new Thai constitutional government. The roots of the rebellion began during the coup d'√©tat of June 1933, when Phraya Phahon Phonphayuhasena ousted Phraya Manopakorn Nititada and replaced him as prime minister. As with many other supporters of Phraya Mano, Songsuradet was permanently barred from politics by the new premier. He spent the next two years exiled in Sri Lanka. During, before, and after the coup, conflicts arose between Songsuradet and Phibun, who were both ministers of state and members of the People's Committee. When Phibun succeeded Phraya Phahon as Prime Minister of Thailand on 11 September 1938, there was much resistance to his premiership due to his dictatorial style and cronyism. This, coupled with his role in suppressing the Boworadet Rebellion, resulted in three assassination attempts, two by gunmen and one by poisoning. ==The purge== In 1938, Songsuradet, by then having retired from politics for five years (but not yet from the army) was commander of the military school in Chiang Mai. On 16 December he was commanding a military exercise by his students in Ratchaburi Province, west of the capital. On that date he received orders from Bangkok stripping him of his command of all units as well as his rank and titles and forcing him to retire from the army without pension. He was also expelled from the country. Fearing death, Songsuradet complied, and with his aide-de-camp, Captain Samruad Kanjonsit (Thai: ‡∏£‡πâ‡∏≠‡∏¢‡πÄ‡∏≠‡∏Å‡∏™‡∏≥‡∏£‡∏ß‡∏à ‡∏Å‡∏≤‡∏ç‡∏à‡∏ô‡∏™‡∏¥‡∏ó‡∏ò‡∏¥‡πå), he escaped to Cambodia. The \\"rebellion\\", however, did not end there. In the early hours of 29 January 1939 Phibun, with the help of his minister of the interior and director of the Royal Thai Police, ordered the arrest of a further 51 suspects (suspected of being Songsuradet sympathizers). The persons arrested included inter alia Prince Rangsit, Prince of Chainat (Thai: ‡∏û‡∏£‡∏∞‡∏≠‡∏á‡∏Ñ‡πå‡πÄ‡∏à‡πâ‡∏≤‡∏£‡∏±‡∏á‡∏™‡∏¥‡∏ï‡∏õ‡∏£‡∏∞‡∏¢‡∏π‡∏£‡∏®‡∏±‡∏Å‡∏î‡∏¥‡πå) (a son of King Chulalongkorn), General Phraya Thepahatsadin (Thai: ‡∏û‡∏£‡∏∞‡∏¢‡∏≤‡πÄ‡∏ó‡∏û‡∏´‡∏±‡∏™‡∏î‡∏¥‡∏ô) (a 62-year-old former commander of the Siamese Expeditionary Force during the First World War), and Phraya Udom Pongphensawad (Thai: ‡∏û‡∏£‡∏∞‡∏¢‡∏≤‡∏≠‡∏∏‡∏î‡∏°‡∏û‡∏á‡∏®‡πå‡πÄ‡∏û‡πá‡∏ç‡∏™‡∏ß‡∏±‡∏™‡∏î‡∏¥‡πå), a former minister of state. Others arrested included politicians such as members of the People's Assembly and many were military officers and aristocrats. A further 20 suspects were arrested by the end of the day, including one of Phibun's servants. A special tribunal was created by Phibun to try those purportedly involved in the so- called \\"rebellion\\" and the assassination attempts on Phibun . Seven were released for lack of evidence, 25 were imprisoned for life, and 21 were to be executed by firing squad. However, three were pardoned due to their honorable records and services to the nation. The three included Prince Rangsit and Phraya Thepahatsadin, who were instead imprisoned for life. The other 18, however did not share that fate. They were incarcerated at Bang Kwang Central Prison. Eventually they were executed by firing squad in installments of four prisoners a day. ==Aftermath== Songsuradet, having escaped to Cambodia, lived the rest of his life in abject poverty, making a living by selling confectionery in the streets of Phnom Penh. He died in 1944. Many of the other suspects who were imprisoned by Phibun were eventually pardoned by Khuang Abhaiwongse when he became prime minister in 1944. The rebellion was in effect Phibun's own version of the Night of the Long Knives. By 1938 he had consolidated his power to such an extent that he had become virtual dictator of the country, changing its name from \\"Siam\\" to \\"Thailand\\" in June 1938. He was able to accomplish this using brutal tactics and the absence of any credible opposition. Prajadhipok had by then been succeeded to the throne by Ananda Mahidol, who was only 13 years old and studying in Switzerland. The tribunal which Phibun had set up to try the suspects was packed with judges appointed by him and his government. There were no lawyers present and no witnesses were called. Historians agree today that the men executed were mostly innocent and were not a part of a plot to kill Phibun or overthrow his government. Phibun was eventually removed in 1944. Four years later he returned and served as prime minister from 1948‚Äì1957. He died in 1964. ==See also== * Siamese Revolution of 1932 * Siamese coup d'√©tat of 1933 * Boworadet Rebellion ==References== * https://web.archive.org/web/20070927023446/http://www.rakbankerd.com/01_jam/thaiinfor/country_info/index.html?topic_id=45&filename;=revolutionary5.htm * https://web.archive.org/web/20091027100534/http://geocities.com/drsak/youngturk/youngturk011.txt * https://web.archive.org/web/20070927024443/http://www.rakbankerd.com/01_jam/thaiinfor/country_info/index.html?topic_id=59&db;_file Category:Rebellions in Thailand Category:Military coups in Thailand Category:Political history of Thailand Category:Conflicts in 1939 Category:1939 in Thailand Category:Political repression in Thailand Category:Political and cultural purges Category:1930s coups d'√©tat and coup attempts ","title":"Songsuradet rebellion"},{"id":"20162636","text":"Denis Cullen (23 September 1878 ‚Äì 26 November 1971) was an Irish Labour Party politician and trade union official.

It is winter. The scene is the interior and exterior of Yohy≈ç's snow-covered, straw-thatched hut. The simple-minded peasant Yohy≈ç lives with his gentle and beautiful wife, Ts≈´. Once, long before, he saved the life of a wounded crane by pulling an arrow from its body. Unbeknownst to Yohy≈ç, the crane assumed human form to become his wife. Ts≈´ loves her husband with all her body and soul. Wishing to make life easier for Yohy≈ç, she secretly weaves a gorgeous cloth from her own feathers. Wrapped in the chaste love of his wife, the simple-hearted Yohy≈ç has forgotten the evils of human greed. The villagers S≈çdo and Unzu learn of the valuable cloth and impress upon Yohy≈ç that much merriment and wealth awaits them in the city if his wife were to weave more cloth for which they would be handsomely paid. Deceived by the words of his evil friends and lured by the promise of riches and pleasures, Yohy≈ç urges the reluctant Ts≈´ to weave more of the valuable fabric. Ts≈´ sadly wonders why man is never satisfied with love, always longing for riches. In response to her beloved husband's insistent demands, she resolves to weave another cloth knowing any further sacrifice could be fatal. Overwhelmed and despondent at the thought of her tragic circumstances, Ts≈´ falls unconscious in the snow. Yohy≈ç carries her gently to the fireside to revive her. He does not understand her spiritual suffering. Ts≈´ asks if he still yearns for riches, but Yohy≈ç has become a prisoner of greed and insists that she continue weaving the cloth. Broken- hearted, Ts≈´ enters the back room to finish her work. Ts≈´ returns hovering near death. She hands the magnificent cloth to her husband. Leaving her passionate heart behind, Ts≈´ transforms back into a crane and flaps her way into the snowy twilit night on her final journey. Yohy≈ç realizes that he has lost the priceless affection of his devoted wife. Clutching the precious cloth in his hands, he watches her disappear from sight. ==Orchestration== 2 flutes (piccolo), 2 oboes, 2 clarinets, 2 bassoons, 4 horns, 2 trumpets, 3 trombones, 1 tuba, percussion (timpani, cymbals, triangle, gong, snare drum, bass drum), harp and strings ==Discography== * 1959: Ikuma Dan conducting the Tokyo Philharmonic Orchestra with the Toshiba Singing Angels, Toshiba-EMI * 1994: Ikuma Dan conducting the Tokyo City Philharmonic Orchestra, Columbia Music Entertainment (Live Recording of the 600th Performance) * 1997: Hiroshi Wakasugi conducting the Yomiuri Nippon Symphony Orchestra, Victor Entertainment ==References== * „Ç™„Éö„É©„ÄéÂ§ïÈ∂¥„Äè, ÊåáÊèÆ = Âúò‰ºäÁéñÁ£®, Êù±‰∫¨„Éï„Ç£„É´„Éè„Éº„É¢„Éã„Éº‰∫§ÈüøÊ•ΩÂõ£, Êù±ËäùEMIÊ†™Âºè‰ºöÁ§æ CD liner notes Category:Operas Category:1952 operas Category:Operas by Ikuma Dan Category:Japanese-language operas Category:Operas set in Japan Category:One-act operas Category:Operas based on plays ","title":"Y≈´zuru"},{"id":"20162713","text":"Eugene Mullen (born c. 1898‚Äìdate of death unknown) was an Irish Fianna F√°il politician, professor and priest.

In it, he argues (with reference to his own novels and those of prominent modernist writers such as Proust and Samuel Beckett) that the novel form must be re-imagined by each generation. He takes issue with the common idea that the 19th century bourgeois novel (exemplified by Balzac) is the benchmark by which all novels must be judged. After all, he argues, each new form of artistic expression was once new and strange. It is the obligation of the artist to create new and strange artworks which in turn create reference points to judge future artworks (and which will by necessity be useless to do so). Controversially, he argues against \\"several obsolete notions\\" such as character, story and depth.

It was then redesignated Task Force 121, and later as Task Force 626, Task Force 145, and Task Force 88.Leigh Neville, 'Special Operations Forces in Iraq,' Osprey Publishing Elite 170, Osprey, 2008, , 32. Neville notes that he omitted the 'current' (c. 2008, time of writing) designation of the unit. However, he did say that it was also known obliquely as Other Coalition Forces ‚Äì Iraq (OCF-I), 'a wry reference to the CIA unit of the moniker OGA'.Neville, 2008, 32. By the time General Stanley McChrystal took command, the force was known as Task Force 714.McChrystal, My Share of the Task, , pp. 90, 93, 96-7, 111. ==Post-invasion Organization== (see Iraq War order of battle) *Task Force 77 (formerly Task Force 145) ‚Äì LSA Anaconda, Balad **TF Black/Knight ‚Äì Elements, UK's SAS, SBS, SRR, 18 SR and the SFSG until 2006 ‚Äì Based in headquarters known as MSS Fernandez a.k.a.

Its task organization drew on every unit of (JSOC) as well as on the CIA's Special Activities Division Special Operations Group (SAD/SOG) and British special operations forces. The headquarters element, which included the majority of the task force's many aviation and intelligence assets, was based at Balad Air Base between Samarra and Baghdad; the four elements that it controlled, each commanded by a lieutenant colonel or equivalent, were spread across the country. Task Force Center is probably co-located with TF 145's headquarters element at Balad, but it could also be based at Camp Liberty, since it is responsible for the Baghdad region. TF Center is based around a direct-action squadron; the three Delta Force squadrons and SEAL Team Six appear to rotate through this position. It is also supported by a rotating company-sized element of the 75th Ranger Regiment and elements of the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (160 SOAR). TF Center has taken casualties in the Yusufiya area, where one of its helicopters was shot down in spring 2006. Task Force West is structured similarly to TF Center in that it has a company-sized force protection element from the 75th Rangers and is based around a battalion-sized direct action unit that can at any given time be a Delta Force squadron or SEAL Team Six. It seems that these units rotate every three to four months. TF West is responsible for operations in Anbar, where it is known to have been active at various times in Fallujah, Qaim, Husayba, and Ramadi; Delta Force lost nine operators during combat in Husaybah, Qaim and Ramadi. It is likely that TF West is based either at Camp Asad or Camp Taqaddum. Task Force North is organized differently: it is based around a full battalion of the 75th Rangers (the position rotates among the three battalions), with a company-sized element from Delta Force acting in support. TF North was based at FOB Marez in Mosul. ==History as Task Force 20Invasion of Iraq=== In preparation for the 2003 invasion of Iraq, Task Force 20 was formed based on Task Force 11/Sword during the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan and were assigned to western Iraq, the TF (Task Force) was led by Major General Dell Dailey. TF 20 was composed of mainly Black SOF units from JSOC: B squadron, Delta Force and all 3 Battalions of the 75th Ranger Regiment; a battalion strength element of the 82nd Airborne Division, serving as a QRF and reinforcements; and a M142 HIMARS; later in the invasion M1A1 Abrams tanks from C Company, 2nd Battalion 70th Armor were attached to TF 20.Neville, Leigh, Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military), Osprey Publishing, 2015 , p. 93 TF 20 was covertly based at Ar'Ar Air Base in Saudi Arabia; the commander of the Delta Force squadron Lieutenant Colonel Pete Blaber wanted to deploy his operators out into western Iraq and conduct strikes against enemy concentrations, tying up enemy forces that could otherwise be sent to reinforce against the Army and Marine advance from the south, such operation would also effectively deceive the Iraqis as to the true intentions of the coalition forces and precisely where the main effort would be concentrated. However, Daily wanted the Delta squadron to stay at Ar'Ar Air Base and only launch against suspected WMD sites and/or HVT, the disagreement was decided by General Tommy Franks who went with Blaber's plan. TF 20 was tasked with seizing airfields deep in Iraq and capturing HVTs along with providing long-range Special Reconnaissance; one of its primary pre-invasion targets was the planned seizure of Saddam International Airport in Baghdad, two full-scale rehearsals were carried out but the operation was never carried out and the airport was eventually captured by conventional units.Neville, Leigh, Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military), Osprey Publishing, 2015 , p. 93, p.96 In the evening of 19 March 2003, Task Force 20, led by B squadron, Delta Force (accompanied by several Air Force Special Tactics teams, a Delta intelligence and targeting cell, several military working dog teams and two Iraqi‚ÄîAmerican interpreters), was the first US SOF unit to enter western Iraq as part of the initial infiltration before the main invasion. They later assisted coalition SOF in the capture H-3 Air Base, Rangers were later flown in to garrison the base; unofficially, Task Force 20 had been in Iraq, along with British SOF Task Force 7 and 14, and the Australian SOF Task Force 64. Delta Force then proceeded to the Haditha Dam complex; it also conducted numerous deception operations to confuse the Iraqis as to the disposition of Coalition forces in the west.Neville, Leigh, Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military), Osprey Publishing, 2015 , p.97, p.127-128 On 24 March 2003, Delta Force recce operators drove through Iraqi lines around the Haditha Dam, marking targets for Coalition airstrikes, the subsequent bombings resulted in the destruction of a large number of Iraqi armoured vehicles and antiaircraft systems. Also that day, 3rd Battalion 75th Ranger Regiment conducted a combat drop onto H-1 Air Base, securing the site as a staging area for operations in western Iraq. Delta's reconnaissance of the dam indicated that a much larger force was needed to capture it, so C squadron Delta squadron was dispatched from Fort Bragg, with a further Ranger battalion, along with M1A1 Abrams tanks from C Company, 2nd Battalion 70th Armor (known as 'Team Tank'). C-17s flew the company from Talil to H-1 Air Base and then to MSS (Mission Support Site) Grizzly‚Äîa desert strip established by Delta Force which was located between Haditha and Tikrit; C Squadron, Delta Force was flown directly to MSS Grizzly.Neville, Leigh, Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military), Osprey Publishing, 2015 ,p.128-129 On 26 March 2003, the DEVGRU component in TF 20 supported by B company 2nd Battalion 75th Ranger Regiment conducted the raid Objective Beaver‚Äîa suspected chemical and biological weapons site at the al Qadisiyah reservoir, north of Haditha, they engaged numerous gunmen but there was no chemical or biological weapons at the site.Neville, Leigh, Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military), Osprey Publishing, 2015 , p.97, p.133-134 On 1 April 2003, DEVGRU along with Para Rescue Jumpers and Combat Controllers from the 24th Special Tactics Squadron and Rangers from 1st and 2nd Battalions, 75th Ranger Regiment and other forces took part in the rescue of PFC Jessica Lynch; also that day C Squadron, Delta Force and 3rd Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment captured the Haditha Dam and held it for a further 5 days. Delta units headed north from Haditha to conduct ambushes along the highway above Tikrit, tying up Iraqi forces in the region and attempting to capture fleeing high-value targets trying to escape to Syria, Team Tank convinced Iraqi Generals that the coalition main effort might be coming from the west. On 2 April 2003, they were engaged by half a dozen armed technicals from the same anti-special forces Fedayeen that had previously fought Task Force 7. Two Delta operators were wounded and the squadron requested aero medical evacuation and close-air support as a company of truck-borne Iraqi reinforcements arrived to bolster the Fedayeen assault. Two MH-60K Blackhawks carrying a para jumper medical team and two MH-60L Black Hawk DAPs of the 160 SOAR responded and engaged the Iraqis, which allowed the Delta operators to move their casualties to an emergency HLZ, after which they were medevaced to H-1 Air Base, escorted by a pair of A-10As. However, Master sergeant George Fernandez died of his wounds. The DAPs stayed on station and continued to engage the Iraqis, destroying a truck carrying a mortar and several infantry squads, whilst Delta snipers killed Iraqi infantryman firing on the DAPs. A pair of A-10As arrived and dropped 500 lb airburst bombs within 20m of Delta positions and killed a large number of Iraqi infantry who had been gathering in a wadi. The DAPs spotted several Iraqi units and engaged them until they were dangerously low on fuel.Neville, Leigh, Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military), Osprey Publishing, 2015 ,p.129-130 On 9 April 2003, the combined team seized an airfield near Tikrit during a night attack, one tank drove into a 40 ft deep hole and flipped, injuring one of the crew and disabling the tank, which was later destroyed by another tank to deny it to the enemy. By mid-April, Delta had advanced into Baghdad and 'Team Tank' returned to its parent unit.Neville, Leigh, Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military), Osprey Publishing, 2015 , p.131 Throughout April, TF 20 continued to raid suspected WMD sites, sometimes only hours ahead of the official Army WMD SSE team as major combat operations were winding down TF 20 transitioned to hunting HVT former Ba'athists. On 19 April 2003, the TF captured HVTs Mohammed Abbas, the leader of the PLF terrorist group. On 25 April, captured the Iraqi deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz. TF 20 also recovered a Mi-17 Hip helicopter for later use in covert operations.Neville, Leigh, Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military), Osprey Publishing, 2015 ,p.167-168, p.190 ===Post invasion=== In May 2003, 80% of SOF assets were rotated out of the theatre at the conclusion of major combat operations, elements of Task Force 20 remained and continued to hunting HVT former Ba'athists under direct JSOC command and had several successes in its early operations.Neville, Leigh, Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military), Osprey Publishing, 2015 , p.190-191 On 16 June 2003, operators from G Squadron, SAS (part of Task force 14) and B squadron, Delta Force, captured Lieutenant-General Abid Hamid Mahmud al-Tikriti, who had been Saddam Husseins' personal secretary and had been ranked the fourth most important HVT. He was captured in a joint helicopter and ground assault on a safehouse in Tikrit without resistance or casualties, in what was considered a highly successful operation.Urban, Mark, Task Force Black: The Explosive True Story of the Secret Special Forces War in Iraq , St. Martin's Griffin, 2012, , p. 17.Neville, Leigh, Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military), Osprey Publishing, 2015 ,p.191 On 18 June 2003, near the Syrian border, AC-130 Spectre gunships guided in by TF 20 operators destroyed a convoy of Ba'ath Party members escaping to Syria, intelligence indicated that the convoy may included Saddam Hussein and/or his sons, other reports claim the convoy was composed of oil smugglers. Once the convoy was destroyed by the AC-130s, TF 20 conducted a heliborne assault into a nearby compound that proved to be a Ba'athist safehouse for ferrying FREs (Former Regime Elements) across the border, the operators then came under fire from Syrian border guards leading to a firefight that left several of the border guards dead with 17 more captured who were immediately released.Neville, Leigh, Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military), Osprey Publishing, 2015 ,p.167-168, p.190-191 Delta Force Operators of Task Force 20 and 101st Airborne Division soldiers during the mission to capture/kill Uday and Qusay Hussein in Mosul, 22 July 2003. On 22 July 2003, a former Ba'athist regime member used an informer to pass intelligence onto the 101st Airborne Division that Uday and Qusay Hussein (whom had $15 million bounty), along with Qusays' son and a bodyguard, were hiding in the informers home in Mosul; the 101st passed this information to their divisional special forces liaison, whom passed it onto TF 20. Platoons from the 101st Airborne set up an outer cordon around the target house, a Delta assault team prepared to breach and clear the building from the entrance, whilst a Delta interpreter called upon the occupants to surrender. The informer and his two sons left the building as previously agreed. Delta operators breached and entered, upon which they were immediately engaged by small arms fire, which wounded one Delta operator. As they withdrew from the house, the occupants threw grenades from the second floor on them, and several Delta operators were lightly wounded by the grenade fragments; the stairs had also been blocked to impede any rapid assault. Another group of assaulters fast roped from a MH-6 Little Bird onto the roof of the building to examine the possibility of entering the building through the roof, but this wasn't possible. The decision was taken to soften up the target with heavy weapons before another entry. After soldiers of the 101st Airborne engaged the building with .50cal HMGs and M136 anti tank rockets, a third entry attempt was made, but was again driven back by intense gunfire. The 101st fired 10 TOW missiles from HMMWV-mounted TOW II antitank guided missiles into the house, followed by repeated gun runs from OH-58 Kiowas firing 2.75 rockets and .50cal machine guns. Delta subsequently made a successful entry and moved up onto the second floor, finding Qusay and the bodyguard dead. Qusay's son was hiding under a bed and opened fired on the operators, leaving them no choice but to kill him. Uday was discovered wounded and armed, a Delta operator shot and killed him.Neville, Leigh, Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military), Osprey Publishing, 2015 , pp. 193-195. ==History as Task Force 121== In July 2003, Task Force 5 (formerly Task Force 11) in Afghanistan and Task Force 20 were amalgamated to form Task Force 21, which was later renamed as Task Force 121‚Äîthe command was set up in such a way that TF 121's Delta Force and other elements of JSOC could be switched between Afghanistan and Iraq as required. The task force continued to successfully target former regime members.Neville, Leigh, Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military), Osprey Publishing, 2015 , p.188.Urban, Mark, Task Force Black: The Explosive True Story of the Secret Special Forces War in Iraq , St. Martin's Griffin , 2012 ,p.37 An Iraqi-American military interpreter with Saddam Hussein at the feet of Delta Force and ISA operators, December 2003.Neville, Leigh, Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military), Osprey Publishing, 2015 , p.197-198. Between July and December 2003, TF 121 carried out twelve unsuccessful raids to find Saddam Hussein, together with 600 other operations against targets, including 300 interrogations. On 12 December 2003, a raid on a house in Baghdad, that was being used as an insurgent headquarters, captured Muhammed Ibrahim Omar al- Musslit, who was Saddam's right-hand man, known to TF 121 as \\"the source\\" or \\"the fatman\\". Early the next morning he revealed where Saddam may be found.Lewis, John E., The Mammoth Book of Covert Ops: True Stories of Covert Military Operations, from the Bay of Pigs to the Death of Osama bin Laden (Mammoth Books), Robinson, 2014, This intelligence and other intelligence from detained former members of the Ba'ath Party, supported by signals intelligence from the ISA, finally pinpointed Hussein at a remote farm compound south of Tikrit.Neville, Leigh, Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military), Osprey Publishing, 2015 , p.195 Operation Red Dawn was launched on two likely locations of Saddam's whereabouts (code-named Wolverine 1 and Wolverine 2) near the town of ad-Dawr. C squadron, Delta Force, ISA operators under TF 121 and the First Brigade Combat team of the 4th Infantry Division, conducted the operation, Delta operators eventually found and arrested Saddam Hussein.Neville, Leigh, Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military), Osprey Publishing, 2015 , p.195-196 In the final weeks of 2003, Colonel Stuart Herrington had been on an inspection of Camp Nama‚Äîthe special ops facility at Baghdad Airport, (at the time it was TF 121 main operations centre in Iraq prior to moving to Balad Air Base) in particular he inspected the detention and interrogation facilities-where individuals captured by JSOC and SAS were taken to. As a result, he reported to the chief army intelligence officer in Baghdad that Iraqis who had been captured by TF 121 had showed signs of mistreatment. In the following months there was a series of investigations and a total of 29 complaints were investigated in relation to Camp Nama, 5 were upheld resulting in disciplinary action against 34 soldiers.Urban, Mark, Task Force Black: The Explosive True Story of the Secret Special Forces War in Iraq , St. Martin's Griffin , 2012 ,p.52-53,p.54-55 By early 2004 many of the leading 'deck of cards' figures had been accounted for. By the Spring of 2004, Major General Stanley McChrystal, the commander of JSOC, began dealing with the level of abuse of detainees at Camp Nama, McChrystal‚Äîbelieving that 'you need to build a network to defeat one'‚Äîshut down Camp Nama and established a new base at Balad Air Base, there he created a state-of-the-art JOC (Joint Operations Centre) where JSOCs war in Iraq would be run day to day by the commander of Delta Force, the base was up and running by July 2004. ==History of Task Force 6-26== The Guardian reported that a few days after the US media published a series of photographs showing abuse of detainees at Abu Gharib prison Task Force 121 was renamed Task Force 6-26. TF 6-26 conducted missions in Fallujah before and during the First Battle of Fallujah.West, Bing,No True Glory: A Frontline Account of the Battle for Fallujah, 2006, Bantam Books, ASIN: B01MSK2FVN On 19 August 2004, TF 6-26 operators and an Iraqi special forces unit, supported by U.S. Marines from Detachment One as part of Task Unit Raider carried out a raid on 'Objective Resistor,' the target being a former regime official running a large anti- coalition cell connected to JTJ, Detachment One would raid the officials house whilst TF 6-26 operators and an Iraqi special forces unit killed/captured two of his financiers. However, the mission was a \\"dry hole.\\"Piedmont, John P., Lieutenant Colonel USMCR, Det One: U.S. Marine Corps U.S. Special Operations Command Detachment, 2003-2006 (U.S. Marines in the Global War on Terrorism), CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform ,2016 ==History as Task Force 145 == It was a combined U.S. and British military special forces provisional grouping specifically charged with hunting down high-value al-Qaeda and Iraqi leadership including Osama bin Laden and, prior to his death on 7 June 2006, Al-Qaeda in Iraq leader Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. It is believed that the Task Force played a role in the medium-altitude strike mission that killed al- Zarqawi just outside Baqubah.http://blogs.abcnews.com/theblotter/2006/06/victory_for_tas.html The Blotter: Brian Ross Reports, ABC News. 8 June 2006 9:12 am The Task Force was charged with disrupting al-Qaeda operations in Iraq and, to a lesser extent, Afghanistan. The action arm of the task force was made up of operators from Delta Force, DEVGRU, SAS, SBS and soldiers 75th Rangers. Members of the CIA's elite (SAD/SOG) paramilitary unit were also believed to be an important part of the group.Sean D. Naylor, SpecOps Unit nearly nabs Zarqawi, (from www.armytimes.com, 28 April 2006) Support elements include the 160 SOAR (Night Stalkers), the USAF 24 STS, and British paratroopers from the SFSG. The unit was operating up until at least January 2007; it is not clear whether it is still operational with the U.S. drawdown from Iraq. In January 2007 Task Force 88 established a subsidiary task force, Task Force 17 (US Army ODA/Special Forces), in addition to an existing task force for which it supported, Task Force 16 (US/UK Tier 1 SOF). Task Force 17 was established to 'counter Iranian influence.' Task Force 17 was to be made Initially Operationally Capable as of 'NLT 15 January 2007 and Full Operational Capability (FOC) will be in place NLT 15 February 2007.' === Operations === The task force is known to operate very autonomously. In their only publicly known operation they reportedly conducted several raids without requiring approval from nearby conventional command structures and only requiring it from USSOCOM. The task force was also responsible for the tracking and eventual elimination (by F-16 launched ordnance) of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. Over 18 months beginning in early 2007, the task force reportedly arrested 3,500 terrorists in Baghdad and killed several hundred others. Thus, al Qaeda bomb attacks went down from an average of 150 per month (killing monthly 3,000 people) to about two. During the campaign, six SAS troops were killed and 30 injured. Delta Force suffered an overall 20 percent casualty rate (killed, injured, sick). Overall, by the cessation of operations, TF 145 suffered 18 killed in action.Rayment, Sean, \\"SAS Kill Hundreds of Terrorists In 'Secret War' Against Al-Qaeda in Iraq\\", Sunday Telegraph, 31 August 2008. During operations in Al-Anbar province, TF88 operatives entered the insurgent-controlled city of Haditha, several times finding Zarqawi's hideouts. Their raids found eggs still cooking, just missing the terrorist leader. Based on this current and actionable intelligence, they asked the commander of II MEF(FWD) to have to the city of Haditha assaulted in order to flush Zarqawi out. The general chose the 3rd Battalion 1st Marines, experienced in heavy fighting from Operation Phantom Fury, to assault the city. Originally, it was not clear what the reduced U.S. military role following the U.S.‚ÄìIraq Status of Forces Agreement and associated drawdown to purely advisory operations has had on the task force's operations. Currently, other temporarily formed Task Forces are compiled primarily of US and UK Special Operations units (and depending on the operational needs, usually involving other Coalition members' SOF units such as Australian SASR, Canadian CSOR/JTF2, etc.) and mostly, are put together for specific taskings, such as hunting ISIL leadership (such as unconfirmed reports of a reformation of \\"TF Black\\") or the hunt of Somalian Al-Shabaab alongside CJSOTF-Africa. There are numerous small Task Forces dedicated to counterterrorism tasks across the globe, but with the current cutbacks by the Dept of Defense and the Administration, the most needed Task Forces are stretched thinner than even before in the Global War on Terror. === Task Force Black/Knight === Based in the Baghdad area at MSS Fernandez,Urban, Mark, Task Force Black: The Explosive True Story of the Secret Special Forces War in Iraq , St. Martin's Griffin , 2012 ,p.15-16,p.75 TF Black (which was supported by Parachute Regiment members of the SFSG)Thomas Harding, US Calls in Paras for Baghdad Secret War, Daily Telegraph, 24 April 2006 is based around a squadron of the SAS, with integrated units from the SBS, SRR, 18 SR and Delta Force. In the early months of 2004, the SAS used their capabilities in reconnaissance and surveillance to watch suspects and develop/gather intelligence for the coalition intelligence services. The SAS operational process in Baghdad was known as find-fix-finish. Working backwards with the 'finish' part being a raid to take down a suspect, 'fix' involved pinpointing a time and place which a target can be taken; 'find' would be finding the insurgent/terrorist. In this period, they almost captured/killed Abu Musab al-Zarqawi when they assaulted a house in Baghdad. After forcing entry, they withdrew when they discovered a booby trap. They still managed to overwhelm the occupants of the building; captured intelligence revealed Zarqawi had left a short time before.Urban, Mark, Task Force Black: The Explosive True Story of the Secret Special Forces War in Iraq , St. Martin's Griffin, 2012 ,p.49,p.71 Due to mistreatment of detainees and the conditions at Camp Nama and JSOC's TSF (Temporary Screening Facility) at Balad and the deportation of detainees to Bagram Airbase, US-UK relations were strained when they refused to turn over detainees to US custody. McChrystal kept Task Force Black out of JSOC, but this would change in 2006. In the meantime, Task Force Black targets were former Ba'athist party regime elements.Urban, Mark, Task Force Black: The Explosive True Story of the Secret Special Forces War in Iraq , St. Martin's Griffin, 2012 On 11 April 2005, Task Force Black's G squadron, SAS, captured Fadhil Ibrahim al-Mashhadani, one of Saddam Hussein's former apparatchik after assaulting his house. At about the same time, in an attempt to find the kidnappers of a foreigner, the SAS also captured a former senior Ba'athist party official and another man. They didn't find the hostage but the men were definitely connected to the kidnappers; they were later released, however, when US intelligence revealed that they were CIA assets.Urban, Mark, Task Force Black: The Explosive True Story of the Secret Special Forces War in Iraq , St. Martin's Griffin, 2012 ,p.75,p.76-77 In Spring 2005, the Director Special Forces (DSF) rebalanced British special forces deployments so that Afghanistan would be the responsibility of the SBS and Iraq would be that of the SAS.Urban, Mark, Task Force Black: The Explosive True Story of the Secret Special Forces War in Iraq , St. Martin's Griffin , 2012 ,p.92-93 Following the Basra prison incident in September 2005, in which the name of the unit 'Task force Black' was leaked to the press; the unit was renamed 'Task force Knight'Urban, Mark, Task Force Black: The Explosive True Story of the Secret Special Forces War in Iraq , St. Martin's Griffin, 2012 ,p.116 After a change of DSF and improvement of the JSOCs TSF, in late 2005 Task Force Black began to integrate more closely with JSOC. In mid-January 2006, the British SAS began Operation Traction: which was its secret upgrade/integration into JSOC, they deployed TGHG (Task Group Headquarters Group): this included senior officers and other senior members of SAS - to JSOCs base at Balad. This upgrade now meant that the SAS were \\"joined at the hip\\" with JSOC and it gave the SAS a pivotal role against Sunni militant groups, particularly AQIUrban, Mark, Task Force Black: The Explosive True Story of the Secret Special Forces War in Iraq , St. Martin's Griffin, 2012 ,p.116,p.117 In early 2006, Task Force Black was involved in the release of three hostages working for Christian Peacemaker Teams as part of Operation Lightwater. With the aim of finding the hostages, the operation involved raiding houses and arresting suspects almost every day and night until sufficient intelligence was gathered on the whereabouts of the hostages. The total number of building raids amounted to 50, 44 of them being by British special forces including a total detained 47 people.Urban, Mark, Task Force Black: The Explosive True Story of the Secret Special Forces War in Iraq , St. Martin's Griffin , 2012 ,p.122-p.123,p.128,p.130 In April 2006, B squadron SAS launched Operation Larchwood 4 the results of which gave the coalition intelligence on Zarqawi which led to his death.Urban, Mark, Task Force Black: The Explosive True Story of the Secret Special Forces War in Iraq , St. Martin's Griffin , 2012 ,p.138-p.146 According to journalist Sean Rayment for the Telegraph, TF Black removed or killed 3,500 terrorists in Baghdad prior to 2008.Rayment, S.

(2010). SAS was barred from dealing with US forces. Lexisnexis. Retrieved (2010, 15 September) from http://www.lexisnexis.com/hottopics/lnacademic/ Another setback for the task force was during the Second Battle of Fallujah when the SAS was banned from going into the city alongside its American counterpart because of the pressure that the government was feeling from the unpopularity of the war. In 2007, when JSOC began conducting CII (Counter Iranian Influence) missions, the UK government ordered that Iranian nationals should not be taken by Task Force Knight and they excluded them from certain intelligence-gathering missions measures being taken to prepare for possible strikes against Iran.Urban, Mark, Task Force Black: The Explosive True Story of the Secret Special Forces War in Iraq , St. Martin's Griffin , 2012 ,p.214 Following a SAS takedown operation of Qais Khazali - a senior Shia militant and Iranian proxy in Basra and his brother: Laith al-Khazali and his Ali Mussa Daqduq a Hezbollah advisor, turned out to be the Task Force most significant action of Operation Crichton. They also found critical documents: one was a report on the Karbala raid which identified Azhar al-Dulaimi as being responsible for it, he was eventually killed by US forces; the Karbala memo also indicated that Iran's Quds Force approved the attack. There were memos about attacks on British forces in Basra and large financial payments based on performance against the coalition. Daqduq revealed that he had been brought into Iraq by Quds Force leadership to be a sort-of insurgent management consultant. He also revealed that the Shia Special Groups gave reports of IED attacks and indirect fire to the Iranians as well as said Iraqi's for training in Iran. The mission made a strategic impact, Task Force 17 (a unit consisting of US Army Special Forces and elite Iraqi units conducting Counter Iranian Influence missions) stepped up its raids against Iranian targets. Operators from Task Force knight responded to 2007 Iranian seizure of Royal Navy personnel, but the incident was eventually resolved. The CII missions successfully caused the leader of the Mahdi Army, Muqtada al-Sadr, to flee to Iran, where in August he declared a ceasefire with the coalition.Urban, Mark, Task Force Black: The Explosive True Story of the Secret Special Forces War in Iraq , St. Martin's Griffin , 2012 ,p.224-227,p.229,p.250 During the Spring and summer of 2007, the British SAS as part of Task Force Knight suffered several men seriously wounded as it extended its operations into Sadr City; in April, Task Force Knight focused its efforts against Arab Jabour which HUMINT intelligence revealed that it was an al-Qaeda's \\"bastion\\". Following the disbandment of Task Force Spartan in southern Iraq following the British withdrawal, Task Force Knight focused its efforts on al-Qaeda VBIED network in Iraq, mainly in Doura, Salman Pak and Arab Jabour, killing dozens in the summer months of 2007. By March 2008, the Sunni insurgency was waning rapidly, the need for aggressive special operations raids became few, B squadron SAS extended its operations into Tikrit and Anbar province, going after low-level targets that the Iraqi military could deal with.Urban, Mark, Task Force Black: The Explosive True Story of the Secret Special Forces War in Iraq , St. Martin's Griffin, 2012 ,p.232,p.240,p.253-254,p.262-263 UKSF left Iraq in May 2009.Urban, Mark, Task Force Black: The Explosive True Story of the Secret Special Forces War in Iraq , St. Martin's Griffin, 2012 ,p.270 Task Force Black/Knight provided the United Kingdom with one clear success of the nations controversial involvement in the Iraq War. In an interview with The Times newspaper in August 2008, General David Petraeus said the SAS \\"have helped immensely in the Baghdad area, in particular to take down the al-Qaeda car bomb networks and other al- Qaeda operations in Iraq's capital city\\". Lieutenant-General Rob Fry described the role of British special forces in defeating al-Qaeda as being of \\"an absolutely historic scale\\".Urban, Mark, Task Force Black: The Explosive True Story of the Secret Special Forces War in Iraq , St. Martin's Griffin , 2012 ,p.274 The SAS campaign against the Shia Special Groups was successful. Iraq's population, however, is made up of a Shia majority whose insurgents were supported covertly by Iran. The task force and JSOC, therefore, could only contain the threat rather than destroy it. Many members of the Special Groups have since been released by the Iraqi government.Urban, Mark, Task Force Black: The Explosive True Story of the Secret Special Forces War in Iraq , St. Martin's Griffin , 2012 ,p.275 Currently, rumors of a \\"reformation of a similar Task Force going by the cover name of TF Black\\" have emerged. Most former Special Mission Unit members and insiders believe, however, that because the concept of a \\"Task Force is temporary, hence the term 'Task' Force...as in being tasked with a particular objective\\", this would be unlikely, regardless of the reports of mainstream media to the contrary. Most of the time, Task Forces such as the original TF Black, cannot technically \\"be reformed\\" to hunt ISIL when the creation of a more current and lesser-known joint Task Force would make more sense to those inside the Joint Special Operations Command. ==History as Task Force 88== The Long War Journal reported that Task Force 88 operators with Iraqi forces carried out a raid in north of Baquba, Diyala province on 22 January 2008 as part of Operation Raider Harvest-an operation focusing on al Qaeda in Iraq/ISI's network in the Miqdadiyah region of Diyala province. The raid targeted \\"an improvised explosive device specialist involved in coordinating IED and suicide-vest attacks in the region-with ties to several al Qaeda in Iraq senior leaders.\\" They killed the high-value target and one other operative during the raid and found IEDs and grenades at the scene. The following day, TF 88 returned to the region in search of a second ISI (Islamic State of Iraq) leader. Ten ISI fighters were killed in airstrikes and another three were killed by ground fire as they moved to attack the operators. As they secured the building used by the terrorists, Coalition forces found \\"machine guns, military-style assault vests, rocket-propelled grenade propellant, and various ammunition,\\" Multinational Forces Iraq reported. \\"Nearby, the ground force discovered additional weapons caches to include rocket-propelled grenades, artillery, and mortar rounds, improvised IEDs, and suicide-vest materials.\\" The Long War Journal reported that on 24 June 2008, a team of TF 88 operators killed ISI emir in a raid on a terrorist safe house in Mosul. ==ReferencesFurther reading== *Michael Smith, 'Killer Elite: The Inside Story of America's Most Secret Special Operations Team,' 2008 *Mark Urban, 'Task Force Black,' 2010 * *Richard Shultz.

KPNLF camps shown in black. The Khmer People's National Liberation Armed Forces (KPNLAF) was the military component of the Khmer People's National Liberation Front (KPNLF) a political front organized in 1979 in opposition to the Vietnamese-installed People's Republic of Kampuchea (PRK) regime in Cambodia. The KPNLAF was loyal to Son Sann, a former Prime Minister under Prince Norodom Sihanouk and the founder of the KPNLF political movement. ==Establishment== The KPNLAF was formed in March 1979 from various anti- communist groups that had concentrated on the Thai-Cambodian border and which were opposed to the People's Republic of Kampuchea, the Vietnamese-backed government of Cambodia.Keat Gin Ooi, Southeast Asia: A Historical Encyclopedia, ABC-CLIO, 2004 Daniel Bultmann (2015) 'Inside Cambodian Insurgency. A Sociological Perspective on Civil Wars and Conflict', Ashgate: Burlington, VT/Farnham, UK, . Many of these groups were warlord bands, engaging more in smuggling and in internecine fighting than in combat operations. They were brought together by General Dien Del, a former career officer of the Khmer Republic who became chief of the KPNLAF General Staff. By mid-1979 there were 1,600 armed soldiers in the KPNLAF.Corfield, p. 10. The KPNLF was proclaimed on October 9, 1979 at Sok Sann, a camp in the jungles of the Cardamom Mountains that contained barely 2,000 menBekaert, J., \\"Kampuchea: The Year of the Nationalists?\\" Southeast Asian Affairs, Institute of Southeast Asian Studies, Singapore (1983), pp. 169. and was a merger of 13 armed groups, some of them remnants of the Khmer National Armed Forces. The following month the first shipment of 3,000 rifles arrived from Beijing.Corfield JJ. A History of the Cambodian Non-Communist Resistance, 1975-1983. Clayton, Vic., Australia: Centre of Southeast Asian Studies, Monash University, 1991, p. 11. In 1981 overall command was given to General Sak Sutsakhan, another prominent member of the Republic's former army. ==Expansion 1981‚Äì82== General Dien Del opened an officer's training school at Ampil Refugee Camp (Ban Sangae) in January 1981.Corfield, P. 13. The first graduating class of 82 cadet officers, 68 company-level commanders and 76 platoon-level commanders immediately took up posts in the field. This was further helped by the arrival of some 3000 Chinese weapons in March.Heder, S. \\"KPNLF's Guerrilla Strategy Yields Mixed Results,\\" Indochina Issues 45 (April 1984), p. 3. Because of Son Sann's non- communist credentials, the KPNLAF offered an alternative to those Cambodians who supported neither Sihanouk, Hanoi nor the Khmer Rouge, and it quickly became the second largest guerrilla force in Thailand, second only to the remnants of the Khmer Rouge. By mid-1981, with about 7,000 personnel under arms, it was able to protect its refugee camps and occasionally to conduct forays into Cambodia. In June 1982 the KPNLF joined the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea, although military operations between the three partner organizations never achieved any degree of coordination. Nong Chan Refugee Camp became the KPNLAF's military headquarters at the end of 1982, although Ampil Camp remained the administrative headquarters until it was destroyed in early 1985. Nong Chan housed the KPNLAF's 3rd, 7th and 9th battalions and a Special Forces commando unit, while the 1st Battalion was at Nong Samet Refugee Camp and the 2nd at Ampil.Radu, M. and Arnold, A. The New Insurgencies: Anticommunist Guerrillas in the Third World New Brunswick, N.J.: Transaction Publishers, 1990, p. 218-19.

Due to the lack of weapons, many KPNLAF troops carried their own guns, including American M16s which had been supplied by the US military to Khmer National Armed Forces troops prior to 1975. A few soldiers even carried hunting rifles or shotguns.Bekaert J. Kampuchean Diary, 1983-1986. Bangkok, Thailand: DD Books, 1987.

Landmines: A Deadly Legacy. New York: Human Rights Watch, 1993, p. 172. ==The Vietnamese offensive of 1984-85== Two developments in the mid-1980s greatly diminished KPNLAF capabilities as a fighting force. The first of these was the Vietnamese dry season offensive of November 1984 to March 1985, which weakened the KPNLAF's numbers and forced them to abandon several fortified border encampments (such as Nong Samet and Nong Chan) on the Thai-Cambodian border. The other insurgent forces, the Khmer Rouge and the Arm√©e Nationale Sihanoukiste, were also affected by this offensive, which reduced the number of camps on the border from 21 to 11. The Government of Thailand and the international community viewed the quartering of KPNLAF troops in civilian camps as a recipe for disaster, and United Nations Border Relief Operation, the UN agency responsible for security on the border, relocated the camps inside Thailand with troops in separate camps from refugees. The second development, equally harmful to the KPNLAF cause, was the dispute that broke out among the top leaders.\\"Rebel Leaders fight for Power in Cambodia,\\" San Jose Mercury News, January 4, 1986 Following the loss of the border camps, contemporary reports noted that \\"open revolt\\" had broken out among guerrilla commanders over the \\"dictatorial ways\\" of Son Sann, who had continued as president of the KPNLF, and his \\"interference in military matters.\\"\\"Leadership Rebellion Splits group in Cambodian Rebel Coalition\\", Los Angeles Times, January 5, 1986 The crisis resulted in the virtual paralysis of the KPNLAF until leadership issues were resolved in late 1986.Country Studies Series by Federal Research Division of the Library of Congress, 1987 ==Commando operations inside Cambodia== Partly as a result of leadership disputes that prevented the development of a coordinated military strategy, the KPNLAF turned to sabotage and demolition in order to wage a war of attrition.Crossette, Barbara, \\"Cambodian Rebels are Pushed into Thailand, and a Corner: Guerrillas Try to Regroup for a Summer Offensive,\\" New York Times, Feb 24, 1985, p. 182.

Non-nuclear Futures: The Case for an Ethical Energy Strategy (Cambridge, Massachusetts: Ballinger Publishing Company, 1975. xxxii + 223pp. , ). The main theme of the book is that the most important parts of the nuclear power debate are not technical disputes but relate to personal values, and are the legitimate province of every citizen, whether technically trained or not. Lovins and Price suggest that the personal values that make a high-energy society work are all too apparent, and that the values associated with an alternate view relate to thrift, simplicity, diversity, neighbourliness, craftsmanship, and humility.Non-Nuclear Futures, pp. xix-xxi. They also argue that large nuclear generators could not be mass-produced. Their centralization requires costly transmission and distribution systems. They are inefficient, not recycling excess thermal energy. The authors believed that nuclear reactors were less reliable (a grossly incorrect prediction) and take longer to build, exposing them to escalated interest costs, mistimed demand forecasts, and wage pressure by unions. Lovins and Price suggest that these two different sets of personal values and technological attributes lead to two very different policy paths relating to future energy supplies. The first is high-energy nuclear, centralized, electric; the second is lower energy, non- nuclear, decentralized, less electrified, softer technology.Non-Nuclear Futures, p. xxiii.

The fruit bodies (mushrooms) of the fungus have whitish to pale buff-colored caps that can reach up to in diameter, and stems up to long and thick. On the underside of the caps are tiny light yellow to pale greenish-yellow pores, the site of spore production. When the fruit bodies are fresh, the cap and pores stain yellow where exposed, handled, or bruised. The species is found in Asia, Europe, and North America, where it grows on the ground in deciduous or mixed woods, usually in association with pine trees. It is closely related, and physically similar, to the more common Albatrellus ovinus, from which it may be distinguished macroscopically by differences in the color when bruised, and microscopically by the amyloid (staining bluish- black to black with Melzer's reagent) walls of the spores. The fruit bodies of A. subrubescens contain scutigeral, a bioactive chemical that has antibiotic activity. A. subrubescens mushrooms are mildly poisonous, and consuming them will result in a short-term gastrointestinal illness. ==Taxonomy and phylogeny== The species was first described as Scutiger subrubescens by American mycologist William Murrill in 1940, based on collections that he found growing under oak near Gainesville, Florida, in November 1938. In 1947 he transferred it to the genus Polyporus. Josiah Lincoln Lowe examined Murrill's type material and thought that it did not differ from Albatrellus confluens. In 1965, Zdenƒõk Pouzar made collections from Bohemia (now the Czech Republic), and described it as a new species (Albatrellus similis), unaware of the similarity to Murrill's Florida specimens. Further study revealed that A. similis was identical to Murrill's Scutiger subrubescens, and Pouzar transferred the latter epithet to Albatrellus. In 1974, Pouzar recognized that Lowe's species Albatrellus confluens was distinct from A. subrubescens. The specific epithet subrubescens, \\"tinted reddish\\", is derived from the Latin words sub (\\"less than\\") and rubescens (\\"growing red\\"). Four Albatrellus species were included in a large-scale phylogenetic analysis of the order Russulales published in 2003. Based on their ribosomal DNA sequences, the four form a clade, or monophyletic group (that is, they derived from a single ancestor). Of the four tested species, A. ovinus was most closely related to A. subrubescens. The polypore Wrightoporia lenta (type species of the genus Wrightoporia) occurred on a single branch basal to the albatrellus clade, implying that it shared with the Albatrellus species a common ancestor from which both were descended. In a more recent (2010) molecular analysis by Canadian mycologist Serge Audet aimed at clarifying relationships among species formerly placed in Scutiger, A. subrubescens grouped in a clade with A. ovinus and A. citrinus. According to Audet, these species, in addition to A. avellaneus and A. piceiphilus, are the constituents of an Albatrellus with limits defined by molecular genetics. Other Albatrellus species were transferred to segregate genera: A. fletti and A. confluens to Albatrellopsis; A. caeruleoporus and A. yasudae to Neoalbatrellus; A. pes-caprae and A. ellisii to an amended Scutiger. ==Description== The caps of some North American populations have a blackish gray to purple-gray coloration. The cap of A. subrubescens is between in diameter, with a central, eccentric (away from the center), or rarely lateral (attached to the edge of cap) stem. Initially, the cap is convex with an involute margin, flattening out with age. The cap margin may be folded or flat. The cap surface in young specimens is smooth but soon forms appressed scale-like spots, which may transform into scales in age. Initially, the cap has white margins and a brownish-violet center with scale-like spots; the center later becomes orange-brownish or ochraceous brown. According to Canadian mycologist James Ginns, who described North American Albatrellus species in 1997, some North American specimens may be covered with blackish-gray to purple-gray fibrils, but this characteristic is not seen in European collections. The cap discolors yellowish when bruised. The stem is long and thick, cylindrical, irregular, and its base may be somewhat pointed, or bulbous. Initially white, the stem develops orange/violet spots and later brownish orange spots; in old specimens the stem may be brownish brick red. The tubes on the pore surface (underside of the cap) are about 2.5‚Äì3 mm long and decurrent in attachment. The pores are small, measuring about 2‚Äì3 per millimeter. They are initially greenish-white, but later turn dark brown; dried specimens can have pores that are tinted green. Fruit bodies have a \\"faintly fragrant, pleasant\\" odor; in his original report on the species, Murrill noted that specimens left to dry in an oven developed a strong odor of burnt sugar. The taste of the mushroom has been described variously as indistinct, or \\"distinctly bitter\\". The type material was noted by Murrill to taste bitter, an observation later corroborated by Pouzar with European collections. A. subrubescens mushrooms are mildly toxic: consumption causes a gastrointestinal illness that usually subsides one to four hours after ingestion. In deposit, the spores are white. The spores are 3.4‚Äì4.7 by 2.2‚Äì3.4 ¬µm, ellipsoid to ovoid in shape, and amyloid (absorbing iodine when stained with Melzer's reagent). Most have a single large oil drop. The spore- bearing cells (the basidia) are club-shaped, 12‚Äì16 ¬µm long by 5.7‚Äì7.7 ¬µm thick, and have four thin, slightly curved sterigmata that are 3.4‚Äì4.3 ¬µm long. The hymenium lacks any cystidia. The hyphal system is monomitic, meaning that the context is made of thin-walled generative hyphae. These hyphae have lengths in the range of 3.5‚Äì30 ¬µm (most commonly 6‚Äì17 ¬µm), with thin walls (up to 1 ¬µm thick), and are hyaline (translucent). Although they are inamyloid, some hyphae have internal masses that are colored pale bluish-gray to black, which makes them appear collectively grayish-black under the microscope. Gloeoporous hyphae (wide and thin-walled with refractive contents) are also scattered throughout the context, as well as some hyphae with expanded tips that are thick-walled and amyloid. ===Similar species=== In general, A. subrubescens can be distinguished from other Albatrellus species by its white cap that becomes orange when bruised, its simple-septate hyphae, small amyloid spores, and habitat under pines. In the field, Albatrellus ovinus is difficult to differentiate from A. subrubescens due to its similar appearance. A. ovinus usually lacks the violet color often seen in the cap and stem of A. subrubescens. Microscopic characteristics can be used to reliably distinguish the two species: the spores of A. subrubescens are amyloid, in contrast to those of A. ovinus, and A. ovinus spores are smaller, typically 3.8‚Äì4.6 by 3.3‚Äì3.5 ¬µm. Other similar species include A. tianschanicus, described from the Altai Mountains in East-Central Asia, and the Japanese species A. cantharellus. Unlike A. subrubescens, these species have hairy scales on the surface of their caps, and the scales are darker than the spaces between the scales. Also, the scales of A. subrubescens are not much darker than the area between the scales. Both of these Asian species have larger spores than A. subrubescens: those of A. cantharellus are 4.5‚Äì7 by 4‚Äì5.5 ¬µm, while those of A. tianschanicus are 5‚Äì7 by 4‚Äì5 ¬µm. Albatrellopsis confluens has caps that are pinkish-buff to pale orange, and white flesh that dries to a pinkish-buff; it has a taste that is bitter, or like cabbage. The spores of A. confluens are weakly amyloid. Additional differences distinguishing Albatrellopsis confluens from A. subrubescens include the presence of clamp connections in the context hyphae, and mycelium on the base of the stem. The European fungus A. citrinus, originally considered a morphotype of A. subrubescens, was described as a new species in 2003. It is distinguished from A. subrubescens morphologically by its smaller caps (up to in diameter), the yellowish bruising of the caps with age or after handling, and the absence of violet spots on the cap. A. citrinus associates with spruce rather than pine, and requires calcareous (lime-rich) soil. ==Habitat and distribution== Fruit bodies sometimes grow in groups fused at the caps or stem bases. Fruit bodies of A. subrubescens are usually solitary, but sometimes several (typically between two and eight) are stuck together by the stem bases or on the sides of their caps. A strictly terrestrial species, it is not found fruiting on wood. It prefers to grow in pine woods, but has occasionally been associated with silver fir in Europe; fruit bodies associated with the latter tree species tend to be less robust than those found growing with pine. It is suspected that A. subrubescens may be mycorrhizal with two- and three-needle pines (i.e., those species that have their needles attached in bundles of two or three), although its ecological preferences are not known with certainty. Ginns, relating a personal communication with David Arora, wrote that Arora encountered several clumps of fruit bodies in an area in California containing mostly knobcone pine (a three-needle pine), manzanita, huckleberry and a few mandrones. The species has been reported from a variety of locations in temperate regions of Asia, Europe, and North America. In North America, its distribution includes Alberta, Quebec, and the Northwest Territories in Canada. In the United States, it is found in Alabama, Arizona, California, Florida, New York, Texas, Washington, and Wisconsin. The North American distribution extends south to Mexico, in Chiapas. In Asia, the fungus has been recorded from Yunnan in southwest China, and Tibet. In Europe, collections have been reported from Austria, Czechoslovakia, Finland, Germany, Italy, Poland, Sweden, Switzerland, Yugoslavia, and the Ukraine. ==Bioactive compounds== Chemical structure of scutigeral Albatrellus subrubescens contains the bioactive compound scutigeral, which has antibiotic activity. This chemical‚Äîalso found in the related species A. ovinus‚Äîmay contribute to the mushroom's toxicity by disturbing the body's intestinal flora. Scutigeral interacts selectively to the dopamine receptor D1 subfamily (the most abundant dopamine receptor in the central nervous system, regulating neuronal growth and development, and mediating some behavioral responses). A 1999 publication suggested that scutigeral has agonistic activity at vanilloid receptors (a receptor found on sensory nerves in mammals); specifically, that it affects the uptake of calcium in the neurons of rat dorsal root ganglia. Later reports failed to corroborate this pharmacological activity. One 2003 study reported that scutigeral acts as a weak antagonist on the human vanilloid receptor VR1, while another study published that year did not find any activity. ==References== * Category:Fungi described in 1940 Category:Fungi of Asia Category:Fungi of Europe Category:Fungi of North America Category:Poisonous fungi Category:Russulales Category:Taxa named by William Alphonso Murrill ","title":"Albatrellus subrubescens"},{"id":"20162896","text":"Larentia clavaria, the mallow, is a moth of the family Geometridae.

In 1967, he collaborated in the creation of a cultural centre of activities in the most deprived area of his city of birth, Bilbao. He was a member of the clandestine opposition against Franco's dictatorship from 1969 until democracy arrived in Spain.Giner, Elisenda. (2011). Amistad deseada.

Barcelona: Hipatia Editorial. . During the years of dictatorship as a democratic leader, he opposed any dictatorship as well as sexual harassment within organizations. The application of the values of democracy, equality and freedom were consistent in their personal and social life. In 1978 he moved to a neighbourhood of Barcelona where there were shacks and founded La Verneda Adult School ‚Äì Sant Mart√≠, being the first Spanish experience published in the specialized journal \\"Harvard Educational Review\\",S√°nchez, M.

L. (2008). Critical pedagogy (Vol. 1),.Primer: Peter Lang. See page.91. In 1991 Flecha founded the CREA research centre at the University of Barcelona. Currently, the centre has become a network of researchers from different universities.Transformation of the research centre in network community of researchers, 2016. The communicative methodology created in the research centre has served as a reference in different fields of research, but with particular relevance in research focused on vulnerable groups.Bhabha, J., Fuller, A., Margareta Matache, J., Vranje≈°eviƒá, E., Chernoff, M.

In 1997 he published his first book that included the theory of dialogic learning, subsequently published in English and in Chinese. The theoretical basis is the basis of the transformation of schools into Learning Communities ‚Äì School as learning communities. In parallel, to the development of research, as a professor at the University of Barcelona, he began to identify how the problem of sexual harassment in Spanish universities was severe. In 1995, he presented the first complaint to the university's governing team that addressed the issue by creating international organizations and procedures that were being carried out in other universities around the world. No measures were implemented until the Law for the effective equality of women and men 2007,Law for the effective equality of women and men 2007 which included the obligation of Spanish universities to have equality commissions and protocols against gender violence. He supported as director of the centre the women's group CREA-SAFO. This group is responsible for leading gender studies and the prevention of gender violence. He supported them when they decided to continue denouncing sexual harassment perpetrated in the university, as well as when they decided to lead the first investigation R&D; on Gender Violence in Spanish Universities.Final report of the R+D first study on Gender Violence in Spanish Universities Thanks to his support, despite the constant attacks and defamation of his person, was reflected in the first publication of scientific results on sexual harassment in Spanish universities in the international scientific journal Violence Against Women.Valls, R., Puigvert, L., Melgar, P. and Garcia-Yeste, C., 2016.

The BIGEYE was a 500-pound class glide bomb with a radar altimeter fuze intended to disperse the binary generated nerve agent VX, made in flight from the non-lethal chemical components \\"QL\\" and sulfur only after aircraft release. The BLU-80-B was designed under the auspices of the U.S. Navy as a safe chemical weapons alternative in response to chemical weapons (CW) threats from the USSR and other actors. BIGEYE was a genuine tri-service program led by the U.S. Navy with significant U.S. Army and U.S. Air Force participation. Initially approved in the 1950s, the program persisted into the 1990s. ==Background== As the stockpile of U.S. unitary (live agent) chemical weapons began to show troubling leakage, the Department of Defense (DoD) became acutely aware of the safety hazard to military personnel and public backlash this could generate. It is now known that the Soviets experienced the same and likely worse leakage issues with their unitary live agent weapons. With this in mind, the Pentagon insisted that it needed a binary chemical weapons program to counter and deter a Soviet Union or third-world chemical attack threat.Gordon, Michael R. \\"hazard 3C1A96F948260&sec;=&spon;=&pagewanted;=all Bush Keeping Chemical Arms Option\\", The New York Times, October 15, 1989, accessed November 11, 2008. The U.S. Army Chemical Corps was reactivated in 1976 to assess and deal with this threat, and with it came the increased desire to acquire a retaliatory chemical capability in the form of much safer binary chemical weapons. Initially, the United States was in Strategic Arms Limitation Talks with the Soviet Union, and then-President Jimmy Carter rejected U.S. Army requests for authorization of the binary chemical weapons program. The talks deteriorated, and President Carter eventually granted the Army request. However, at the last minute Carter pulled the provision from the budget. This action left the decision on a retaliatory binary chemical weapons option to the Ronald Reagan administration. ==History== BIGEYE (an acronym for Binary Internally Generated chemical weapon within the \\"EYE\\" series of 500 pound canister weapons) was the common name for the BLU-80/B, a concept conceived during the 1950s. During the 1970s at Pine Bluff Arsenal around 200 test articles were produced.Croddy, Eric and Wirtz, James J. Weapons of Mass Destruction: An Encyclopedia of Worldwide Policy, Technology, and History, (Google Books), ABC-CLIO, 2005, p. 40-42, (), accessed November 11, 2008. Initial production contracts for the BIGEYE were awarded in June, 1988, to The Marquardt Company of Van Nuys, CA, the project's prime contractor for most of the program. The original timeline for the U.S. binary chemical weapons program called for the BIGEYE to be deployed by September 1988.Mauroni, Albert J. Chemical Demilitarization: Public Policy Aspects, (Google Books), Greenwood Publishing Group, 2003, p. 109, (,). President Reagan authorized the spending of more than $59 million in 1986 to revive the binary chemical weapons program. Under the original timeline, the BIGEYE was to be the second binary chemical weapon to be produced (the first being a binary artillery shell) with binary chemical agent rockets to follow. After a General Accounting Office (GAO) report pointed out numerous flaws in the program the U.S. Senate moved to effectively kill the binary chemical weapons program, including the BIGEYE bomb. In 1989 President George H.W. Bush announced that the U.S. would retain the option to produce such binary weapons. At the time of his announcement, 1992 was the earliest date BIGEYES were expected to be deployed. ==Specifications== The BIGEYE was an air-launched 500 pound-class canister weapon to be delivered by various U.S. Navy and Air Force aircraft. The interior of the weapon consisted of two separate containers of non-lethal chemical compounds, stored separately and assembled only immediately before flight, and then combined to create the active chemical nerve agent VX only after aircraft release. It was the storage separation of less aggressive chemical components that ensured safe storage/handling and simpler maintenance requirements. The bomb was a Navy weapon design that would atomize the percutaneous nerve agent VX over a targeted area by releasing the binary- generated agent while gliding through the air over the target.Mauroni, Albert J. Chemical and Biological Warfare: A Reference Handbook, (Google Books), ABC- CLIO, 2003, p. 38-39, (). The BIGEYE bomb weighed ; and would have generated the chemical agent VX. It was to have a length of and a diameter of . The glide bomb had a wingspan of . The BIGEYE was not planned to have any internal guidance, propulsion or autopilot systems (hence its \\"glide bomb\\" designation).\\"BLU-80/B Bigeye\\", Federation of American Scientists, updated February 5, 1998, accessed November 11, 2008. ==Problems and issues== The 25+ year old, on-again off-again BIGEYE bomb program was plagued with problems and controversy from its outset. Much of the controversy was based on analysis by the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Also criticized was the entire idea of a modern American chemical weapons program. Such a program, the argument went, would actually encourage others to develop chemical weapons, as opposed to acting as a deterrent. The testing, which had mixed results, presented its own set of problems. In 1987 the Navy and Air Force conducted 70+ tests, results which were characterized as \\"very inconsistent\\" by the GAO. Following a test suspension and subsequent significant design improvements, vastly better weapons function and reliability results were achieved. Problems the Navy encountered with the BIGEYE included excessive pressure build-up, questions about the lethality of the chemical mixture resulting from variable mix times, and overall reliability concerns. Scientists debated the efficacy of the binary weapons program, especially since the BIGEYE had only been tested using simulants. In the end, the BLU-80/B BIGEYE binary chemical weapon might possibly have been the tipping point in chemical weapons disarmament talks with the USSR, as the Soviets agreed to significant chemical weapons disarmament agreements immediately after successful operational test results of the BIGEYE resulting from improvements implemented by the U.S. Navy's Naval Air Weapons Center, China Lake. ==Notes== Category:Chemical weapon delivery systems Category:Cold War aerial bombs of the United States Category:Chemical weapons of the United States ","title":"BLU-80/B Bigeye bomb"},{"id":"20162949","text":"Walter Skocik (born 6 September 1940 in Schwechat) is a former Austrian international footballer and football manager. == External links == * * * Profile - Rapidarchiv Category:1940 births Category:Living people Category:People from Schwechat Category:Association football midfielders Category:Austrian footballers Category:Austria international footballers Category:SK Rapid Wien players Category:FC Wacker Innsbruck players Category:Austrian Football Bundesliga players Category:Austrian football managers Category:Austrian expatriate football managers Category:SK Rapid Wien managers Category:UD Las Palmas managers Category:AE Larissa FC managers Category:PAOK FC managers Category:FK Austria Wien managers Category:LASK managers Category:Ethnikos Piraeus F.C. managers Category:Apollon Smyrnis F.C. managers Category:Wiener Sport-Club managers Category:First Vienna FC managers Category:Ittihad FC managers Category:AC Omonia managers Category:FC Fribourg players Category:FC Fribourg managers Category:Sportspeople from Lower Austria ","title":"Walter Skocik"},{"id":"20162960","text":"Paracolax tristalis, the clay fan-foot, is a litter moth of the family Erebidae.

It also comes from India under the name Cows and Leopards. A variant of this game is also popular in Bangladesh, where it is known as Sholo guti (Sixteen pieces). One way it is played (especially in villages), is by drawing the court of the game on the ground and using stones as pawns.Sports of Bangladesh, Rashid Haider, Bangla Academy The game was documented by Henry Parker in Ancient Ceylon: An Account of the Aborigines and of Part of the Early Civilisation (1909) with the name HƒìwƒÅkam Keliya or the War Game. Parker mentions that the game is also played in India and Bangladesh under the name S≈çlah Guttiya or Sixteen Balls. The game is similar to draughts (checkers) and Alquerque as players hop over one another's pieces to capture them; it is more similar to Alquerque between the two since it uses a standard Alquerque board. However, unlike standard Alquerque, an additional two triangular boards are attached on two opposite sides of the standard Alquerque board. Furthermore, pieces can move and capture in any direction from the beginning. Parker mentions that the game pieces are called \\"soldiers\\", and when a soldier is captured it is said to be \\"chopped\\". Its actual closest relatives are Peralikatuma and Kotu Ellima which are also from Sri Lanka. The difference between these three closely related games is that Peralikatuma and Kotu Ellima have four triangular board extensions as opposed to two. Also the number of pieces differ. In Sixteen Soldiers, each player has 16 pieces hence the name of the game. In Peralikatuma, each player has 23 pieces. In Kotu Ellima, each player has 24 pieces. Sixteen Soldiers is also related to the Indonesian game of Permainan-Tabal. == Setup == An expanded Alquerque board is used. Two triangle boards are attached to two opposite sides of an Alquerque board. Each player has 16 pieces that are distinguishable from the other player. Pieces are placed on the intersections (or \\"points\\") of the board, specifically on their half of the Alquerque board, and the nearest triangular board. == Rules == The following rules are based upon Parker's description: * Players alternate their turns * A player may only use one of their pieces in a turn, and must either make a move or perform a capture but not both. * A piece may move onto any vacant adjacent point along a line.The piece may also move in any direction provided it is available unlike in most variants of draughts where pieces are initially restricted to the forward direction * A piece may capture an opposing piece by the short leap as in draughts or Alquerque. The piece must be adjacent to the opposing piece, and leap over it onto a vacant point immediately beyond. The leap must be in a straight line and follow the pattern on the board. Captures are not mandatory. A piece can continue to capture within the same turn, and may stop capturing any time. The captured piece (or pieces) is removed from the board. * The player who captures all of the other player's pieces wins. == Related games == *Peralikatuma *Kotu Ellima *Permainan-Tabal *draughts *Alquerque ==NotesReferences External links == * https://web.archive.org/web/20080828192050/http://www.manqala.org/wiki/index.php/Llibret/Alquerc Category:Abstract strategy games Category:Traditional board games ","title":"Sixteen Soldiers"},{"id":"20163011","text":"In customer interaction management, Customer Interaction Tracker (CIT) is a software and/or process of gathering information about customers interactions against all levels throughout a business.

The game took place on January 1, 1924, at the Rose Bowl stadium in Pasadena, California, closing the 1923 college football season. The game opened in front of approximately 40,000 people and ended in a 1414 tie. It was the first post-season bowl game for both teams. The 1924 game was the tenth edition of the Rose Bowl, which had first been played in 1902. Following the inaugural game's blowout score, football was replaced with chariot races until 1916. The Rose Bowl stadium had been constructed in 1923, making this edition the second game played in the arena. The game's organizers had previously selected a team from the East Coast and the West Coast, and asked the Washington Huskies to represent the West Coast. Washington requested that the Navy Midshipmen be their opponents, and Navy accepted. Washington selected Navy in favor of several teams from the east which had amassed better records. Both teams had suffered only a single loss during the season, but Washington had won eight games compared with Navy's five, although Navy had also amassed two ties. Predictions gave Washington a slight advantage in the game due to the weight difference between the teams: the Washington players were on average heavier than those of Navy. The game kicked off in the afternoon; heavy rain showers had fallen the day before, causing a slight delay. The first quarter was scoreless, but Navy scored a touchdown on the first play of the second quarter. Washington answered Navy with a 23-yard touchdown run on the next drive. Near the end of the second quarter, Navy scored a touchdown on a two-yard run, giving them a 147 halftime lead. The third quarter was a defensive stalemate as neither team scored. Navy fumbled the ball on their own ten-yard line late in the quarter. Four plays afterward, Washington tied the game on a 12-yard touchdown pass. Navy threw an interception at midfield, and Washington drove down to the Navy 20-yard line before attempting a game-winning field goal. The kick missed and the game ended shortly afterwards. For his performance in the game, Navy quarterback Ira McKee was named the Most Valuable Player. Navy led in nearly every statistical aspect of the contest. Washington returned to the Rose Bowl at the end of the 1925 season, falling to the Alabama Crimson Tide 2019. Navy did not participate in another bowl game until 1955, when their squad, nicknamed the \\"team named desire\\", upset the Ole Miss Rebels in the Sugar Bowl. Since the 1924 Rose Bowl, Navy and Washington have met five more times; the Huskies won three of the games. ==Team selection== The Rose Bowl game was first played in 1902, as a way to help fund the Rose Parade. Because of the first contest's lopsided score, a football game was not played again until 1916, having been replaced by chariot races. Between 1902 and 1947, the Rose Bowl was played between a team from the East Coast and a team from the West Coast. Until the construction of the Rose Bowl stadium, which began hosting the game in 1923, it was called the \\"Tournament East‚ÄìWest football game\\". Because the Pacific Coast Conference (PCC) was the only conference with teams located in the Western United States, a school from the conference had been chosen for every Rose Bowl game. The tournament committee invited the University of Washington Huskies to participate in the 1924 game, and they accepted. Washington was then allowed by the organization to select its opponent for the gamethe first time a team was allowed to do so. Washington chose the Navy Midshipmen based on a suggestion from the committee, and Navy accepted the invitation. ===Navy=== The Navy Midshipmen entered the Rose Bowl under coach Bob Folwell with five wins, one loss, and two ties (512). Navy's sole loss in the 1923 season came in their annual game against Penn State, which they lost 213. All five of Navy's wins came against eastern teams, including Colgate and William and Mary, and two of Navy's wins were shutouts, against Colgate and Saint Xavier. Navy tied 00 with Army in the 1923 Army‚ÄìNavy Game, the last game of the season, played on November 23 in front of nearly 70,000 spectatorsincluding high-ranking military officials. Their other tie was a 33 game against Princeton. Navy was selected by Washington to participate in the Rose Bowl, although several teams with better records were eligible. Both Cornell and Yale finished the season with an undefeated 80 record. Eleven teams finished with only one loss, including Furman (101), Notre Dame (91), and the Virginia Military Institute (VMI) (91). ===Washington=== The Washington Huskies entered the 1924 Rose Bowl with a record of eight wins and one loss (81) under coach Enoch Bagshaw. Washington opened their season with victories over teams from the battleships and ; because these teams did not represent colleges, they were not considered an official part of Washington's schedule. Washington's first official game ended with a 340 shutout of Willamette, which was followed by four more shutouts. Washington's next game was a 2614 victory over PCC opponent Montanathe first points Washington allowed all season. The squad's following game was their sole loss: a 90 shutout by conference opponent California. Washington finished the regular season with two straight wins over conference opponents, including a victory in the Apple Cup over Washington State. ==Pre-game buildup== The 1924 Rose Bowl was the first meeting between Navy and Washington, and was the first bowl game that either team participated in. The competitors were announced on November 30, 1923, and the teams arrived for the bowl in mid-December, holding practices until the evening before the game. Heavy rain fell the night before the competition; Bagshaw said, \\"Wet weather will not bother us\\", and Folwell said, \\"My men will know what to do in the mud and will be there doing it\\". However, because of the wet conditions, several football critics predicted that Washington would have a slight advantage in the game due to their larger size. It was estimated that 52,000 people would attend the game. For the first time, the participating teams were responsible for ticket sales, and as a result only 40,000 people actually attended; a large number of tickets were sold to a navy fleet which was called to service on December 31, the day before the game. The competition was the first Rose Bowl to be broadcast on radio, and was aired by a local Pasadena station. ===Navy=== During the 1923 football season, the Navy Midshipmen outscored their opponents 13343, led by quarterback Ira McKee, who threw several touchdown passes throughout the year. Navy's other offensive strong point was running back Carl Cullen, who ran for several hundred yards during the season. The Navy defense was considered weak by football critics, with an average player weight less than that of Washington. Navy's defense had stopped running plays successfully during the regular season, but had trouble defending pass plays. Navy's special teams were considered by critics to be decent, about even with those of Washington. ===Washington=== The Washington Huskies had outscored their opponents 20337 during the regular season, excluding the games against New York and Mississippi. Washington's running backs, George Wilson and Elmer Tesreau, led their offense during the season, each gaining several hundred rushing yards. However, Tesreau was suffering from boils on his knee, and his coaches urged him to not play in the Rose Bowl. The Washington defense was considered superior to that of Navy, being much larger on average. Washington's defense had been very effective during the regular season, holding five teams scoreless and allowing more than ten points to be scored against them only once. Washington's special teams were considered to be average. ==Game summary== Samuel Shelburne Robison was in attendance for the game.alt=A black-and-white image of a tall man with a mustache in a naval uniform The kickoff for the Rose Bowl was originally scheduled for on January 1, 1924, but the night before the game, a meeting of the Rose Bowl organization rescheduled the kickoff time to the same day. This was likely due to poor field conditions caused by the previous night's rain. The opening ceremonies were the most elaborate of any bowl game up to that time, with numerous events held. Navy admiral Samuel Shelburne Robison received an admiral's salute from Navy's band when he took his seat. The Navy band and the color guard of the marines performed the National Anthem, then the marine color guard hoisted the U.S. flag over the field. Both teams' mascots were walked around the field before the kickoff. The Tournament of Roses predicted that tickets would be sold out by the day of the game, but actual ticket sales were much lower than they had hoped. Still, sales were higher than those of several previous competitions. ===First half=== The game began at the rescheduled time, with a temperature of and the field still wet. Because of the playing conditions, running plays were ineffective, which caused problems for the Washington offense. Navy instead used passing plays, which the Washington defense had trouble stopping. Navy was driving down to the 22-yard line of Washington when the first quarter ended. Navy controlled the first quarter, completing all six passing attempts and holding the Washington offense to under 100 yards gained. On their first play of the second quarter, Navy scored a touchdown on a pass play from Ira McKee to Carl Cullen. McKee kicked the extra point for Navy, giving them a 7‚Äì0 lead. In an attempt to trick Washington, Navy tried an onside kick on the next play, but Washington recovered the ball. After two short running plays, Washington quarterback Fred Abel completed a 23-yard pass to running back Kinsley Dubois, bringing Washington inside the 25-yard line. On the next play, running back George Wilson ran the ball 23 yards for a touchdown. Washington's kicker converted the extra point to tie the game at 7‚Äì7. After several drives from each team that did not result in further scoring, Navy completed a 57-yard pass down to the Washington eight-yard line. Two plays later, Ira McKee ran the ball in from two yards out for a touchdown, then afterward converted the extra point. The first half ended with Navy leading by 147, having completed all 11 passes they attempted. ===Second half=== Both teams' defenses controlled the third quarter, allowing no points to be scored. Navy's McKee completed three more pass plays before his first incompletion, which came on his fourteenth attempt. Washington's offense had little success in the third quarter, being held to only a few yards gained and turning the ball over once. In the fourth quarter, after several unsuccessful drives by each team, Navy made a major error. After being stopped on their own 26-yard line, Navy improperly lined up in a punt formation, and the center snapped the ball over the punter's head. The ball was recovered by Washington on the Navy ten-yard line. Washington lost two yards in three plays, and faced a fourth down from the Navy 12-yard line. Washington stacked their offensive line, allowing their left guard, James Bryan, to become an eligible receiver. Fred Abel passed the ball to Bryan, who caught it just short of the goal line and walked into the end zone for the touchdown. Washington's kicker then converted the extra point, tying the game at 14. Navy received the ball from Washington and began to throw it erratically. After gaining several yards, Ira McKee threw an interception near midfield. On the next play, Fred Abel threw a long pass to George Wilson, who was tackled on the Navy 20-yard line after gaining 30 yards. Washington brought out their placekicker, Leonard Ziel, to kick a 32-yard field goal, which would have won them the game. Ziel kicked the ball about a yard short of the right upright, giving the ball back to Navy with the game still tied. A few plays later the game ended in a 1414 tie. ==Statistical summary== {  + Statistical Comparison ! !! NAVY !!

McKee completed 16 of 20 passes for a total of 175 yards, including one pass for a touchdown. McKee also had 85 rushing yards on twelve attempts. Washington running back Elmer Tesreau was given the game's Ironman Award, though he had little effect on the game. Against the urging of his coaches, Tesreau had played with boils completely covering one knee. He left near the end of the game, and was later discovered to have broken his previously unaffected leg in multiple places. Navy's McKee threw for a perfect 11 of 11 passes during the first half, but completed just five of nine attempts during the second half. Two of these incompletions were interceptions. McKee outthrew Washington's Fred Abel by 110 yards. Carl Cullen was McKee's main receiver for the game, catching ten passes from him, one of which was taken for a touchdown. The other six passes were caught by other receivers. On the ground, Cullen rushed for the most yards of any player, gaining 102 throughout the course of the game. McKee was Navy's key runner, gaining 85 yards. Cullen, McKee, fullback Alan Shapley, and other team members rushed for a total of 187 yards during the game. McKee completed both extra point attempts, and the squad's punter kicked five times, for an average distance of 33.8 yards. Abel attempted eight passes during the game, and completed just three for a total of 65 yards. Of Abel's five incompletions, two were interceptions. Kinsley Dubois caught two of Abel's completed passes, amassing 53 receiving yards. Guard James Bryan caught the other, a 12-yard touchdown pass. George Wilson led Washington in rushing yards, gaining 87 over the course of the game, and scoring Washington's only rushing touchdown. Kinsley Dubois came next, gaining 30 yards, followed by Abel, with 20. The remainder of the team's 137 rushing yards were amassed by others, including Tesreau. Washington's kicker Leonard Zeil was two for two on extra points, but missed his only field goal attempt. Washington punted nine times, averaging 33 yards per attempt. ==Aftermath== alt=A black-and-white aerial image of a dirt field with horseshoe shaped seating around it The tie gave Washington an 811 record for the 1923 season, the second best in school history up to that point. It remained behind the 1916 season, when the squad went 601. Navy's record went to 513, a slight improvement from the previous year, when the team went 52. It became Navy's eighth straight winning season. Washington went 811 in the 1924 season, remaining under the direction of coach Enoch Bagshaw. The team was invited to the 1926 Rose Bowl after completing an undefeated 1101 1925 season. They lost the game to the Alabama Crimson Tide by a score of 2019. Washington finished the 1920s with an overall record of 65266; Bagshaw coached the team for every season except 1920, when they were under the leadership of Stub Allison. Navy finished the 1924 season with a 26 record, ending their number of consecutive winning seasons at eight. The Navy football team was not invited to participate in another bowl game until 1955, when the \\"team named desire\\", so named due to coach Eddie Erdelatz comparing the squad to the play A Streetcar Named Desire, defeated the Ole Miss Rebels in the Sugar Bowl 210. Navy finished the 1920s with a record of 55228; nine of the ten seasons ended in winning records. Navy's coach, Bob Folwell, left the team after the 1924 season, to be replaced by Jack Owsley. Navy and Washington have since met five times, with Washington currently leading the series 321. Because the 1924 Rose Bowl and several later Rose Bowls had very high ticket sales, the Tournament of Roses Association decided to close off the southern end of the Rose Bowl stadium and expand the seating from a horseshoe design to one that surrounded the entire field. The 1924 game was the first in which the Tournament of Roses made participating schools responsible for ticket sales. The strategy has been used since, with only a small number of tickets allocated to Tournament officials for each yearly edition. ==References== Notes Footnotes Rose Bowl Category:Rose Bowl Game Category:Navy Midshipmen football bowl games Category:Washington Huskies football bowl games Category:1924 in sports in California Category:January 1924 sports events ","title":"1924 Rose Bowl"},{"id":"20163098","text":"Dosage of defoamer A defoamer or an anti-foaming agent is a chemical additive that reduces and hinders the formation of foam in industrial process liquids. The terms anti-foam agent and defoamer are often used interchangeably. Strictly speaking, defoamers eliminate existing foam and anti-foamers prevent the formation of further foam. Commonly used agents are insoluble oils, polydimethylsiloxanes and other silicones, certain alcohols, stearates and glycols. The additive is used to prevent formation of foam or is added to break a foam already formed. In industrial processes, foams pose serious problems. They cause defects on surface coatings and prevent the efficient filling of containers. A variety of chemical formulae are available to prevent formation of foams.Rainer H√∂fer, Franz Jost, Milan J. Schwuger, Rolf Scharf, J√ºrgen Geke, Josef Kresse, Herbert Lingmann, Rudolf Veitenhansl and Werner Erwied \\"Foams and Foam Control\\" Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 2000, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. ==Properties== Generally a defoamer is insoluble in the foaming medium and has surface active properties. An essential feature of a defoamer product is a low viscosity and a facility to spread rapidly on foamy surfaces. It has affinity to the air-liquid surface where it destabilizes the foam lamellas. This causes rupture of the air bubbles and breakdown of surface foam. Entrained air bubbles are agglomerated, and the larger bubbles rise to the surface of the bulk liquid more quickly. ==History== The first defoamers were aimed at breaking down visible foam at the surface. Kerosene, fuel oil and other light oil products were used to break down foam. Vegetable oils also found some use. Fatty alcohols (C7 ‚Äì C22) were effective but expensive antifoams. They were added to oil products to boost the efficiency. Milk and cream were forebears for modern day emulsion type defoamers. During the 1950s, experiments with silicone based defoamers started. These were based on polydimethylsiloxane (silicone oil) dispersed in water or light oil. Silicone oils worked well, but caused surface disturbances in many applications like paints and papermaking. In 1963 the first antifoams with hydrophobic particles (hydrophobic silica) in light oil were patented. In the early 1970s, hydrophobic waxes like ethylene bis stearamide dispersed in oils developed. These types of defoamers were very efficient, but the oil crisis of 1973 made these too expensive and resulted in a push for reduction of the oil content. The solution was adding water. So water extended (water in oil emulsion) and water based (oil in water emulsion) defoamers appeared. The development of silicone based defoamers has continued, using different emulsifiers and modified silicone oils. In the early 1990s, silicone emulsion defoamers that caused less surface disturbances were used in the wood pulping industry with great success. These caused better washing, reduced biological oxygen demand (BOD) in effluent and reduced deposits. ==ClassificationOil based defoamers=== Oil based defoamers have an oil carrier. The oil might be mineral oil, vegetable oil, white oil or any other oil that is insoluble in the foaming medium, except silicone oil. An oil based defoamer also contains a wax and/or hydrophobic silica to boost the performance. Typical waxes are ethylene bis stearamide (EBS), paraffin waxes, ester waxes and fatty alcohol waxes. These products might also have surfactants to improve emulsification and spreading in the foaming medium. These are heavy duty defoamers and are normally best at knocking down surface foam. ===Powder defoamers=== Powder defoamers are in principle oil based defoamers on a particulate carrier like silica. These are added to powdered products like cement, plaster and detergents. ===Water based defoamers=== Water based defoamers are different types of oils and waxes dispersed in a water base. The oils are often mineral oil or vegetable oils and the waxes are long chain fatty alcohol, fatty acid soaps or esters. These are normally best as deaerators, which means they are best at releasing entrained air. ===Silicone based defoamers=== Silicone-based defoamers are polymers with silicon backbones. These might be delivered as an oil or a water based emulsion. The silicone compound consists of a hydrophobic silica dispersed in a silicone oil. Emulsifiers are added to ensure that the silicone spreads fast and well in the foaming medium. The silicone compound might also contain silicone glycols and other modified silicone fluids.Rainer H√∂fer, Franz Jost, Milan J. Schwuger, Rolf Scharf, J√ºrgen Geke, Josef Kresse, Herbert Lingmann, Rudolf Veitenhansl and Werner Erwied \\"Foams and Foam Control\\" Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 2000, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. These are also heavy duty defoamers and are good at both knocking down surface foam and releasing entrained air. Polydimethylsiloxane is a widely used antifoaming agent. Silicone based defoamers are also suitable in non-aqueous foaming systems like crude oil and oil refining. For very demanding applications fluorosilicones may be suitable. ===EO/PO based defoamers=== EO/PO based defoamers contain polyethylene glycol and polypropylene glycol copolymers. They are delivered as oils, water solutions, or water based emulsions. EO/PO copolymers normally have good dispersing properties and are often well suited when deposit problems are an issue. ===Alkyl polyacrylates=== Alkyl polyacrylates are suitable for use as defoamers in non-aqueous systems where air release is more important than the breakdown of surface foam. These defoamers are often delivered in a solvent carrier like petroleum distillates. ==Industrial problems== The most noticeable form of foam is foam floating on the stock surface. It is easy to monitor and relatively easy to handle and is more a cosmetic issue. Surface foam may cause problems with liquid levels and give overflow leading to pools of oils around the equipment which is a safety concern. Additionally, this might reduce the process speed and availability of process equipment. The main mechanical problem tends to be when foam enters the system as air is a poor lubricant, meaning metal to metal contact can occur. ===Mechanical problem factors=== Mechanical factors that may generate foam and entrapped air: * Leaky seals on pumps * High pressure pumps * Poor system design (tank, pump inlet, outlet and manifold design) * Pressure release The main classes of air that are of concern to the mechanical systems are: * Dissolved air behaves as part of the fluid phase, except that it can come out of solution as small bubbles (entrained air) * Entrained air consists of bubbles that are small enough to collect on top of a fluid * Bubbles that have sufficient buoyancy to rise to the surface and are described as foam ===Foam in process and coolant liquids=== Foam, entrained and dissolved air that are present in coolants and processing liquids, may cause various kinds of problems, including: * Reduction of pump efficiency (cavitation) * Reduced capacity of pumps and storage tanks * Bacterial growth * Dirt flotation / deposit formation * Reduced effectiveness of the fluid solution(s) * Eventual downtime to clean tanks * Drainage problems in sieves and filters * Formation problems (i.e. in a paper mill it may cause the fibers to form an inhomogeneous sheet) * Cost of replenishing the liquid * Cost of entire material rejection due to imperfections ==Test methods== There are several ways to test defoamers. The easiest is looking at the surface foam. All that is needed is a system for generating foam. This might be done with a round pumping system with a nozzle and a cylinder or an air injection system into a cylinder. The cylinder is fitted with a scale to measure the foam height. This equipment may have a heater to control the temperature. Entrained air can be tested with similar equipment that has a density meter that can record changes of the liquid density over time. Drainage can be tested with a filter system for measuring the time to drain a liquid through the filter. The filter might be pressurized or have a vacuum. ==ApplicationsDetergents=== Anti-foams are added in certain types of detergents to reduce foaming that might decrease the action of the detergent. For example, dishwasher detergents have to be low foaming for the dishwasher to work properly. ===Food=== When used as an ingredient in food, antifoaming agents are intended to curb effusion or effervescence in preparation or serving. The agents are included in a variety of foods and in materials for food preparation; McDonald's includes polydimethylsiloxane (a type of silicone) in its oil to mitigate hazardous splashes of oil caused by foaming in fryers, so it has been listed as an ingredient in their chicken nuggets, french fries, and other fried menu items. ===Industrial use=== Defoamers are used in many industrial processes and products: wood pulp, paper, paint, industrial wastewater treatment, food processing, oil drilling, machine tool industry, oils cutting tools, hydraulics, etc. ===Pharmaceuticals=== Antifoaming agents are also sold commercially to relieve bloating. A familiar example is the drug Simethicone, which is the active ingredient in drugs such as Maalox, Mylanta, and Gas-X. ==See also== * Foam * Foaming agent ==References== Category:Foams Category:Industrial processes Category:Colloidal chemistry Category:Food additives Category:Lubricants Category:Oil additives Category:Process chemicals ","title":"Defoamer"},{"id":"20163102","text":"Franz Jakob may refer to: *Franz Jakob (politician) (1891‚Äì1965), German Nazi politician *Franz G.

Its approach contrasts to the postal rule. ==Facts== Plaintiffs (P) were iron merchants who purchased iron to sell on to third parties. Defendant (D) was the holder of warrants (titles) for quantities of iron. By telegram (dated Saturday 27 September) D offered to sell iron to P for ‚Äú40s., nett cash, open till Monday‚Äù (the original offer) [348]. On Monday morning P sent telegram to D asking whether D would ‚Äúaccept forty for delivery over two months, or if not, longest limit you would allow‚Äù [348] (P's telegraphic enquiry). D did not respond to the telegram and later that day sold all warrants to another party. D sent a telegram to P at 1.25pm on the Monday advising all warrants had been sold (D's telegram of warrants sold). Prior to receiving that communication, P sent a telegram to D at 1.34pm advising acceptance of offer (P's acceptance of offer). P subsequently sued D for non-delivery of iron warrants alleging breach of contract. The main issues were * Whether P's telegraphic enquiry constituted a counter offer, the effect of which would be to extinguish D's original offer. * Whether the decision in Cooke v Oxley 3 T. R. 653 has the effect of allowing the Defendant (McLean) to revoke the offer to sell prior to its acceptance by the Plaintiffs (Stevenson, Jaques & CO). * Related to the second issue was a question as to whether the telegram from D at 1.25pm effectively revoked the original offer, notwithstanding that it was not received by P until after P had accepted the offer. ==Judgment== Lush J held the plaintiff's telegram at 9.42am was not a rejection of the offer but a mere inquiry about whether the terms could be modified. Although McLean was at liberty to revoke the offer before Monday finished, that was not effective until it reached the plaintiffs. Lush J charged the defendant the amount of ¬£1900 to be paid to the plaintiffs subject to any reduction by subsequent ruling. As to the first issue, having regard to the nature of the wording of P's telegraphic inquiry and the volatility of the iron market, the communication cannot be regarded as a counter-offer but a mere inquiry to which the defendant should have responded. The circumstances can be distinguished from Hyde v Wrench 3 Beav. 334 where there was a clear counter- offer [per Lush, J at 358]. As to the second and third issues the argument advanced by D misrepresents the proposition for which Cooke v Oxley stands. The correct principle is that a unilateral promise to hold open an offer is not binding upon the person who made it and can be revoked prior to its acceptance. However, a revocation has no effect until it is actually communicated to the person to whom the original offer was made [per Lush J at 352 relying upon the American decisions in Tayloe v Merchant's Fire Insurance Co How. Sup. Court Rep. 390 and Byrne & Co v Leon Van Tienhoven & Co 49 L.L. (C.P.) [316]. As P had not received D's telegram of warrants sold which would have the effect of revoking the original offer, the original offer stood and P's subsequent acceptance of it resulted in a contract. ==Notes== Category:English contract case law Category:English agreement case law Category:1880 in case law Category:1880 in British law Category:High Court of Justice cases ","title":"Stevenson, Jacques &amp; Co v McLean"},{"id":"20163126","text":"Outsights is an independent scenario planning consultancy founded in 1998 by Richard O'Brien and Tim Bolderson.

Jean Dupuy (1 October 1844, Saint-Palais, Gironde ‚Äì 31 December 1919, Paris) was a French politician and media owner. ==Life== A huissier by profession, he practised in Paris and quickly became interested in the press and in politics, taking over leadership of Le Petit Parisien on the death of Paul Pi√©gut in 1888. He renewed that journal's formula and its circulation continued to rise, reaching 1 million at the time of the Dreyfus affair. In 1891, Jean Dupuy was elected senator for Les Hautes-Pyr√©n√©es and joined the Republican Left. He thus defended the free exchange regime (which wanted to abolish the agriculture minister Jules M√©line) in his journal. Named minister of agriculture himself in the government of Pierre Waldeck-Rousseau, from 22 June 1899 to 3 June 1902, he organised the Cr√©dit Agricole and created the Office of agricultural information. He also defended the French wheat producers in the assembly during the 1900 debate into the import and export of wheat and flour. He then occupied other posts in different governments, notably that of minister for commerce and industry (1909‚Äì1911), then Minister of Public Works, Posts and Telegraphs (1912‚Äì1913 and June 1914), and minister of state (1917). Commander of the M√©rite agricole, he was a member of the Acad√©mie d'Agriculture and the higher committee for agriculture. Reelected a d√©put√© on 3 January 1909, he died in 1919 after having launched the magazine La Science et la Vie in 1913. Le Petit Parisien then exceeded a circulation of 2 million copies, the highest in the world at the time. Jean's sons Pierre and Paul Dupuy took over from him, and also created other press groups. He received the Order of Osmanieh from the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire in early 1900. ==References== Category:1844 births Category:1919 deaths Category:People from Gironde Category:French Ministers of Agriculture Category:Transport ministers of France Category:French Ministers of Public Works, Posts and Telegraphs Category:Commanders of the Order of Agricultural Merit Category:French Ministers of Commerce and Industry Category:Burials at P√®re Lachaise Cemetery Category:Senators of Hautes-Pyr√©n√©es ","title":"Jean Dupuy (politician)"},{"id":"20163135","text":"The 1917 Rose Bowl, known at the time as the Tournament East-West Football Game, was a college football bowl game on Monday, It was the third Rose Bowl Game, and matched the Oregon Webfoots and the Penn Quakers.

After serving as private secretary to three Secretaries of State for War, he was Permanent Secretary to the Ministry of Air Production during the Second World War. He then worked in India and later acted as a special advisor to Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the Governor-General of Pakistan. Rowlands was born on 26 December 1892 and went to school in Penarth. He then studied at the University of Wales, obtaining a first-class degree in modern languages in 1914. He then studied at Jesus College, Oxford, with his university career being interrupted for three years during the First World War, during which he saw action as a captain in the Army Cyclist Corps; he was mentioned in dispatches and was awarded the Military MBE. In 1920, he joined the War Office as a member of the civil service, serving as private secretary to Sir Herbert Creedy, Secretary at the War Office, and then as private secretary to Viscount Hailsham, Viscount Halifax and Duff Cooper, who were successively the Secretary of State for War; Hailsham used to declare that Rowlands was the ideal private secretary. In 1936, Rowlands was seconded to the Indian Government as Adviser on Military Finance, before returning in 1939 Deputy Under-Secretary at the Air Ministry, then becoming Permanent Secretary to the Ministry of Air Production in 1940. His work in the Ministry of Air Production was followed in 1943 by a return to India as adviser to the Viceroy on war administration, supervising various British government branches that had been moved to India during the war. He became Finance Member of the Governor-General's Executive Council. He was also chairman of the committee that reported into the administration of the province of Bengal, making various recommendations for improvement. In 1946, he left India to become Permanent Secretary to the Ministry of Supply, succeeding Oliver Franks. However, he stayed about a year in this position before being seconded as a special advisor to Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the Governor-General of Pakistan. He proposed removing levels of provincial administration to allow the unification of government in Karachi. His obituary in The Times said of his work in India and Pakistan that \\"he showed a vision and judgment which was little short of miraculous in the trying latter days of British rule and in the early days of native rule in the sub-continent. Industry and energy he had in abundance, yet these would have availed him little if there had not been a touch of genius in a mind at once penetrating and kindly - a rare combination.\\" After his year in Pakistan was over, he returned to the Ministry of Supply and was also a member of the Economic Planning Board. He was made a Knight of the Order of the Bath in 1941 and a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath in 1947. He retired at the age of 60 and became a member of the board of Express Newspapers. He died in Henley-on-Thames on 18 August 1953. == References == Category:1892 births Category:1953 deaths Category:People from Penarth Category:Permanent Secretaries of the Ministry of Aircraft Production Category:Civil servants in the War Office Category:Civil servants in the Air Ministry Category:Private secretaries in the British Civil Service Category:Members of the Order of the British Empire Category:Knights Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath Category:Alumni of Jesus College, Oxford Category:Alumni of the University of Wales Category:Welch Regiment officers Category:British Army personnel of World War I Category:People educated at Stanwell School Category:British expatriates in Pakistan ","title":"Archibald Rowlands"},{"id":"20163169","text":"is a Japanese football player currently playing for Tochigi SC. ==Club career statistics== Updated to 23 February 2016.Nippon Sports Kikaku Publishing inc./Êó•Êú¨„Çπ„Éù„Éº„ÉÑ‰ºÅÁîªÂá∫ÁâàÁ§æ, \\"2016J1&J2;&J3;ÈÅ∏ÊâãÂêçÈëë\\", 10 February 2016, Japan, (p. 253 out of 289) {   - ! colspan=3  Club performance ! colspan=2  League ! colspan=2  Cup ! colspan=2  League Cup ! colspan=2  Continental ! colspan=2  Total - !

When it was created in 1883, it was second in importance only to the Legion of Honour within the French order of precedence. ==History== The order was established on 7 July 1883, based on the proposition of the then Minister of Agriculture Jules M√©line, in an effort to adequately reward services to agriculture in view of the maximum number of the Legion of Honour that could be awarded yearly. His reasoning was that more than eighteen million Frenchmen lived directly from this industry, which had a direct and powerful impact on the entire national economy (farmers, agronomists, professors, researchers, etc.). Labour was intensive and never ending, devotion was commonplace but the rewards were rare. The original 1883 decree created a single-grade order; only \\"Knights\\" () were thus decorated. The decree of 18 June 1887 added the grade of \\"Officer\\" (). A third grade, that of \\"Commander\\" (), was created by a decree of 3 August 1900. The present form and statute of the Order of Agricultural Merit were outlined in decree 59-729 of 15 June 1959. The Order comprises approximately 340,000 recipients to date, of which approximately 23,000 are alive at any given time, including all living former ministers of agriculture. Officers number approximately 60,000 to date with approximately 5,000 living, and approximately 4800 were made commanders to date, with approximately 400 living at any given time. ==Award statute== The Order of Agricultural Merit rewards people who rendered exceptional services to agriculture, whether in public duties or in the very practice of agriculture. It also rewards people who distinguished themselves in scientific research or in related publications. There are two annual investiture ceremonies, the first on 1 January and the second on the 14th of July. The annual contingent has been limited to 60 commanders, 600 officers and 2,400 knights. Award prerequisites are as follows: *Knight: be at least thirty years of age with fifteen years of service/work; *Officer: at least five years as a Member of the order; *Commander: at least five years as an Officer of the order. Conditions of age and of seniority may be lowered for candidates who have outstanding qualifications. A 5% contingency is allowed for people gaining direct entry into the order as officers or commanders for exceptional reasons. Foreigners receiving the order are not subject to the seniority clause. Members of the Order of the Legion of Honour may be admitted to the Order of Agricultural Merit at the same rank they hold in the first. An award certificate always accompanies the order. ==Award description== The Order of Agricultural Merit is in the form of a 40mm (35mm for pre November 1999) wide star, 60mm for the commander's insignia, with six white enamelled arms, the arms resting on a gilt wreath of wheat on the right and of corn on the left. On the obverse at its center, a gilt medallion bearing the effigy of the republic in the form of the relief right profile of a woman's head, the medallion is surrounded by a narrow blue enamelled band bearing the golden semi circular inscription \\"R√âPUBLIQUE FRAN√áAISE\\" (\\"FRENCH REPUBLIC\\"). On the reverse, the gilt medallion bears the relief inscription on three lines \\"M√âRITE\\" \\"AGRICOLE\\" \\"1883\\" (\\"AGRICULTURAL MERIT 1883\\"), it is surrounded by a plain blue enamelled band. The officers' and commanders' badges also bear a gilt wreath, half vine and half olive branch, between the insignia and the ribbon suspension ring. The knight's insignia is made of silver, the officer's is made of silver-gilt, the commander's is made of silver-gilt or gold. The order hangs from a 37mm wide silk moir√© green ribbon with 5mm amaranth vertical stripes located 1mm from the edges. The commander's insignia is worn on a cravat around the neck. {  style=\\"text-align: center; width: 60%;\\" - ! style=\\"width: 20%;\\"  Knight !! style=\\"width: 20%;\\"  Officer !! style=\\"width: 20%;\\"  Commander -  130px  130px  190px } == Notable recipients == Oenologist Denis Boubals, a recipient of the Order of Agricultural Merit Prefect Richard Samuel, a recipient of the Order of Agricultural Merit Professor Pierre Barr√®re, a recipient of the Order of Agricultural Merit === Commanders === * Queen Anne, Queen Consort of RomaniaQueen Anne with her daughter Crown Princess Margareta and Princess Alexandra, The Honourable Lady Ogilvy at the gala for her investiture into the order held at the Palace of the Legion of Honour (wears the green order necklet on her neck, seen from behind) *Gerrit Braks *Princess Caroline, Princess of Hanoverhttp://www.palais.mc/en/biography-1-8.html *Prince Charles, Prince of Wales *Jean Dupuy *Jules Gravereaux *Jean-Paul Huchon *Christine Lagarde *St√©phane Le Foll *Ren√© Renou === Officers === *Christian Bind *Pierre Galet *Ernest Vaux *Will Studd *Dominique Levy *John C.

He is not to be confused with his son John Frederick Perkins, also a hymenopterist. ==Life== Perkins was born on 15 November 1866 at Badminton, Gloucestershire and was educated at King Edward VI Grammar School, St. Albans - his father, Rev Charles Perkins, was the headmaster - and at Merchant Taylors' School before obtaining a scholarship in classics to Jesus College, Oxford in 1885. After two years of studying classics, he switched to reading Natural History, notwithstanding that he had not studied science at school, having been inspired to make the change by the lectures of Edward Poulton on the colour of insects. His first publications in natural history journals came when he was still studying classics. He obtained a fourth-class degree in the Animal Morphology specialism of the Natural Sciences course in 1889. In 1891, a committee appointed by the Royal Society and the British Association for the Advancement of Science asked Perkins to investigate the land fauna of the Hawaiian islands, and he was engaged in this for almost ten years, conducting research on the islands and carrying out studies at the University of Cambridge on his trips back home. The fruits of this research first began to be published in 1899, in Fauna Hawaiiensis (edited by David Sharp), and he completed his work in 1913 with a general introduction to the series. For this work, he was awarded the Linnean Society's gold medal for eminent services to zoology. He worked for the Agricultural Department of the Hawaiian Islands between 1902 and 1904, and became the first Director of the experimental station of the Hawaiian Sugar Planters' Association's insect department in 1904, looking at controlling sugar cane pests and weeds with their natural parasites and enemies. In order to collect these, he made journeys to Australia and other places. Ill-health forced his retirement in 1912, and he moved to Newton Abbot, in Devon. He carried on working on Hawaiian insects and published his research for a further 20 years. He was also known for his work on British insects, including bees and sawflies. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1920 and, having been a Fellow of the Royal Entomological Society for more than 50 years, was appointed an Honorary Fellow in 1954. He died in Bovey Tracey, Devon, aged 88. ==ReferencesFurther reading== *Howard, L. O. 1930: History of applied Entomology (Somewhat Anecdotal).Smiths. Miscell.

The towers are the 6th and 7th-tallest buildings in the country and Metro Manila as well, and are currently the second tallest twin towers in the Philippines surpassing Pacific Plaza Towers with a height of 212.88 metres from the ground to its architectural spire. It also has two of the most number of floors in the Philippines. The buildings have 60 floors above ground, including a podium which connects the two towers, and 5 basement levels for parking, and are considered as one of the most prestigious residential buildings in the Philippines. ==Construction== Groundbreaking for the towers were held on January 2005, months ahead of its official launching. Topping-off ceremonies was held on June 24, 2008, although only one tower is actually considered topped-off during that time. The towers were completed and opened in 2009 and taking over as the tallest twin-towers in The Philippines from Pacific Plaza Towers. ==Architecture and design== The St. Francis Shangri-La Place was masterplanned and designed by Wong Tung International Ltd., in cooperation with local architectural firm Recio + Casas Architects. Structural design for the building was provided by Arup, and reviewed by international engineering firm Magnusson Klemencic Associates. The buildings mechanical, electrical, and santiray engineering works was designed by WSP Hong Kong Ltd. Interior design was made by Brennan Beer Gorman Monk Architects (Interior Design). The construction team is composed of Jose Aliling & Associates (Project / Construction Management); Davis Langdon & Seah Philippines Inc. (Quantity Surveying); and EEI Corporation (General Constractor). ===Structural dampers=== Due to the tower's location being close to an active fault in a highly seismic region and also subjected to typhoon winds, the St. Francis Shangri-La Place was the first building in the world to feature a revolutionary ‚Äòdamping‚Äô system designed by international engineering company Ove Arup & Partners. The new system, which minimizes the standard wobble in high-rise buildings, employs the same technology used to strengthen the Millennium Bridge in London. This makes the St. Francis Shangri-La Place one of the safest buildings. The usual methods employed to strengthen buildings are to reinforce it with significant extra structure or to install tuned mass dampers. Both methods are not only expensive, but also make the building stiffer and heavier while consuming valuable space. The Arup solution works by inserting Viscous Dampers into the St. Francis Shangri-La Place to act as energy absorbers and damp out vibrations. Viscous dampers connect deep reinforced concrete outriggers from the central core of each building to the perimeter columns at one level. The added damping so derived, in excess of 6% of critical controls wind-induced motions, achieving occupant comfort objectives, and reduces the design wind overturning moment by a factor of 1.7. Not only is this a lower-cost solution, it is also more sustainable as it uses less material, and leaves more valuable space inside the building.Arup official website Advanced Technology and Research - Damping Systems Reductions in the quantities of concrete and reinforcing steel in the St Francis Towers structure due to the incorporation of the Arup damping system and performance based seismic design saved the building's developer in excess of $5 million in construction cost and more net floor space (through smaller columns and core walls, and no need for space for TMDs). ==See also== * The Shang Grand Tower * List of tallest buildings in the Philippines == References  * St. Francis Tower 1 at Emporis Buildings * St. Francis Tower 2 at Emporis Buildings * St. Francis Towers at Skyscraperpage Category:Skyscrapers in Ortigas Center Category:Residential skyscrapers in Metro Manila Category:Twin towers Category:Residential buildings completed in 2009 ","title":"The St. Francis Shangri-La Place"},{"id":"20163248","text":"is a Japanese international football player currently playing for Gamba Osaka in the J1 League. His regular playing position is attacking midfielder. ==Club career== A native of Osaka, Kurata came up through the youth team ranks at Gamba Osaka and made his way into the first-team squad ahead of the 2007 season. Owing to his tender years, he played just 6 league matches in his debut season as a professional, but the following year he went on to make 21 appearances in all competitions as Gamba lifted the 2008 AFC Champions League and the 2008 Emperor's Cup. The Osaka giants retained their Emperor's Cup title in 2009, however Kurata only featured 4 times throughout the year as he struggled to break into their star-studded starting line-up. To gain more first-team experience he was sent out on loan, first to J2 League side JEF United in 2010 and then to city rivals Cerezo Osaka in 2011. He netted an impressive 10 goals in 33 league games with Cerezo and this form was enough to earn him a recall to Gamba's first-team in 2012. His first season back in north Osaka saw Gamba finish 17th in J1 League which sent them down to Japan's second tier for the first time in their history. Kurata netted 8 times in 28 J2 appearances in 2013 as Gamba bounced back at the first time of asking, securing the league title with 87 points from 42 games. 2014 was a dream for Gamba as not only did they return to Japan's top flight but they also helped themselves to a domestic treble; lifting the J1 title as well as the J.League Cup and Emperor's Cup. Kurata scored 11 goals in 47 appearances in all competitions, a personal best for him in the blue and black of Gamba. The men from Suita added the 2015 Japanese Super Cup and 2015 Emperor's Cup titles to their haul from the previous year, defeating Urawa Red Diamonds in the final of both competitions, and also reached the semi-finals of the AFC Champions League before going down to Chinese side Guangzhou Evergrande over two legs. Kurata played 55 times in all competitions and found the back of the net on 8 occasions. Gamba failed to lift any silverware between 2016 and 2018, however Kurata remained an integral part of the side, missing just 4 league games across the 3 seasons and scoring 14 times. ==International career== On 23 July 2015, Japan's coach Vahid Halilhod≈æiƒá called him up for the upcoming 2015 EAFF East Asian Cup.http://www.jfa.jp/national_team/news/00006836/ EAFFÊù±„Ç¢„Ç∏„Ç¢„Ç´„ÉÉ„Éó2015Ôºà8/2ÔΩû9Ôº†‰∏≠ÂõΩÔºèÊ≠¶Êº¢Ôºâ SAMURAI BLUEÔºàÊó•Êú¨‰ª£Ë°®Ôºâ„É°„É≥„Éê„Éº„Éª„Çπ„Ç±„Ç∏„É•„Éº„É´ He earned his first international cap in a 1-1 draw with China on August 5.

October 2017 would prove to be a high point in his international career as he scored in both the 2-1 friendly victory over New Zealand on October 6 and the 3-3 draw at home to Haiti 4 days later. He was named in the squad for the 2017 EAFF E-1 Football Championship in December 2017 and started all 3 of Japan's games; the victories over North Korea and China as well as the 4-1 defeat to South Korea in the decisive match of the tournament which saw Japan finish as runners-up.Japan National Football Team Database ==Club statistics== Last update: 2 December 2018.Nippon Sports Kikaku Publishing inc./Êó•Êú¨„Çπ„Éù„Éº„ÉÑ‰ºÅÁîªÂá∫ÁâàÁ§æ, \\"J1&J2;&J3;ÈÅ∏ÊâãÂêçÈëë„Éè„É≥„Éá„Ç£Áâà 2018 (NSK MOOK)\\", 7 February 2018, Japan, (p. 81 out of 289) {  style=\\"text- align:center;\\" - ! colspan=3  Club performance ! colspan=2  League ! colspan=2  Cup ! colspan=2  League Cup ! colspan=2  Continental ! colspan=2  Other1 ! colspan=2  Total - !

Harold and business partner Donnie Canada built a new building in 1982. Shedd was instrumental in Alabama, one of the first acts he worked with, being signed by RCA.Kosser, Michael, How Nashville Became Music City, U.S.A.: 50 Years of Music Row; pub. Hal Leonard Corporation, 2006 p. 197 The band‚Äôs debut single 'Tennessee River' was the first of Alabama's 21 consecutive number one hits that he produced. Shedd also produced albums for Amie Comeaux, Roger Miller, Mel Tillis, Louise Mandrell, Dobie Gray, K. T. Oslin, Glen Campbell and Willie Nelson. While Reba McEntire had had top 10 singles, it was only with her collaboration with Shedd that she saw her first gold record, 1984‚Äôs My Kind of Country album, although the pair came into conflict over his suggestions for songs and \\"the sweetened arrangements he imposed on them\\". In 1988, Shedd joined Mercury Polygram Records Nashville, where over the next six years, he oversaw the signing of Kentucky Headhunters, Shania Twain, Billy Ray Cyrus, and Toby Keith. In 1989, Shedd was inducted into the Georgia Music Hall of Fame. After a period as President of Polydor Nashville, The Music Mill recording studio became the headquarters of VFR Records, owned by Shedd with partners Paul Lucks and Ed Arnold, for a time one of Nashville's more successful independent country labels, whose artists included Mark McGuinn and Trent Summar & The New Row Mob. VFR folded in 2002 due to a lack of funding. ==References== Category:1931 births Category:Living people Category:American country singer-songwriters Category:Record producers from Georgia (U.S. state) Category:People from Bremen, Georgia ","title":"Harold Shedd"},{"id":"20163278","text":"The 13th European Film Awards were given on 2 December 2000 in Paris, France. ==Winners and nomineesBest European Actor=== Sergi L√≥pez - Harry, He's Here to Help (Harry un ami qui vous veut du bien) * Jamie Bell - Billy Elliot * Bruno Ganz - Bread and Tulips (Pane e tulipani) * Ingvar Eggert Sigur√∞sson - Angels of the Universe (Englar alheimsins) * Krzysztof Siwczyk - Wojaczek * Stellan Skarsg√•rd - Aberdeen ===Best European Actress=== Bj√∂rk - Dancer in the Dark * Bibiana Beglau - The Legend of Rita (Die Stille nach dem Schu√ü) * Lena Endre - Faithless (Trol√∂sa) * Sylvie Testud - The Captive (La captive) * Julie Walters - Billy Elliot ===Best European Cinematographer=== Vittorio Storaro - Goya in Bordeaux (Goya en Burdeos) *Aleksandr Burov - The Wedding (Svadba) * Agn√®s Godard - Good Work (Beau travail) *Eric Guichard and Jean-Paul Meurisse - Himalaya (Himalaya - l'enfance d'un chef) * Yuri Klimenko - The Barracks (Barak) *Edgar Moura - Jaime ===Best European Film=== { class=\\"sortable \\" width=\\"85%\\" cellpadding=\\"5\\" - !width=\\"20%\\" English title !width=\\"20%\\" Original title !width=\\"20%\\" Director(s) !width=\\"20%\\" Country -FAEB86\\"  Dancer in the Dark   Lars von Trier  Denmark -  Billy Elliot   Stephen Daldry  United Kingdom -  Chicken Run   Peter Lord, Nick Park  United Kingdom -  Harry, He's Here to Help  Harry, un ami qui vous veut du bien  Dominik Moll  France -  The Taste of Others  Le Go√ªt des autres  Agn√®s Jaoui  France -  Bread and Tulips  Pane e tulipani  Silvio Soldini  Italy -  Faithless  Trol√∂sa  Liv Ullmann  Sweden - } ===Best European Screenwriter=== Agn√®s Jaoui and Jean-Pierre Bacri - The Taste of Others (Le go√ªt des autres) *Rafael Azcona - Butterfly (La lengua de las mariposas) *Wolfgang Kohlhaase *Maria Svereva and Nana Djordjadze - 27 Missing Kisses (27 ) *Doriana Leondeff and Silvio Soldini - Bread and Tulips (Pane e tulipani) *Dominik Moll and Gilles Marchand - Harry, He's Here to Help (Harry un ami qui vous veut du bien) ===Best Documentary=== {  width=\\"85%\\" cellpadding=\\"5\\" - !width=\\"5\\" Year !width=\\"25%\\" English title !width=\\"25%\\" Original title !width=\\"25%\\" Director(s) !width=\\"15%\\" Country -  rowspan=\\"7\\" align=\\"center\\" 2000 (12th) -FAEB86\\"  The Gleaners and IThe Gleaners And I/Les Glaneurs et la glaneuse - Film - European Film Awards  Les glaneurs et la glaneuse Agn√®s Varda France -  Calle 54  Fernando Trueba Spain -  Gulag  Goulag Iossif Pasternak, H√©l√®ne Ch√¢telain France -  Home Game  Heimspiel Pepe Danquart Germany -  One Day in September¬±  - Kevin Macdonald United Kingdom -  Working Women of the World  Ouvri√®res du monde Marie-France Collard France - } ==References== Category:2000 film awards Category:European Film Awards ceremonies Category:Cinema of Paris Category:2000 in Europe Category:2000 in French cinema ","title":"13th European Film Awards"},{"id":"20163292","text":"is a former Japanese football player. ==Club career== Fujigaya was born in Hamamatsu on 13 February 1981.

The film was directed by Alessandro Cavadini. It was an expos√© of the ill-treatment of Aboriginal workers by white men. The details of what life was like for Aboriginal Australians on Palm Island became more widely known when Alessandro Cavadini and Carolyn Strachan recreated the strike in 1957 by hundreds of the Island's residents even though there was huge resistance from local authorities. Some 22 years later in 2007, Aboriginal activist, and convicted Palm Island rioter Lex Wotton presented a screening of the film to the Film Fanatics Society at Petersham Bowling Club. He recalled watching the film as a schoolboy and seeing his father on film. He said that screening opened his eyes to the way \\"things were different on Palm\\".

Popular in Lebanon, Egypt, Syria, Palestine, and Jordan, it was originally a Bedouin genre, improvised by a solo poet-singer accompanying himself on the rababa. As part of the Palestinian folk music tradition, ataabas are generally performed by a vocal soloist, without instrumental accompaniment, who improvises the melody using folk poetry for the verse.Kaschl, 2003, p. 249. Sung unmetered in stanzas comprising four lines, the last word of the first three lines are homonyms, each with a different meaning, creating a pun. In urban settings, the ataaba is often paired with a metric choral refrain called a mƒ´janƒÅ. The ataaba is also used by rural Palestinian women to express grief or reproach.Armitage et al., 2002, p. 324. The most common theme of an ataaba is love, though eulogies are also common. Less common themes include moral instruction, and descriptions of nature.Cohen and Katz, 2006, p. 262. ==Structure== About half of all ataabas do not use fixed meter, while the other half use a standard rajaz or wƒÅfir meter. Generally composed of four verses of poetry, the first three end with the same sound.Farsoun, 2004, p. 117. The end of a verse or quatrain in an ataaba is marked by adding a word ending in \\"-ba\\" to the end of the fourth hemistich.Pavla etal., 2008, p. 11. The fourth and final verse usually ends with a word ending in the sound aab or awa. While there are four lines of verse in an ataaba, these are usually sung as two musical phrases. These phrases are often a melodic curve beginning on the fourth or fifth, descending to the cadence and ending on the supertonic or tonic. All ataabas are performed by a soloist, who often begins by singing a long melismatic phrase on the syllable ≈çf. While this opening sequence is not necessarily a part of the ataaba, the closing melismatic phrase sung to words such as yƒÅ bƒÅ (\\"O father\\"), yƒÅ mƒÅ (\\"O mother\\"), or yƒÅ eyn (\\"O eyes\\"), etc., is an integral part of the song's structure and is unique to this musical form. ==Performances== The ataaba is one of many Palestinian folk music traditions that continues to be performed at weddings and festivals in Arab localities in Israel, as well as by Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.Marshall Cavendish, 2007, p. 996.Shiloah, 1997, p. 42. The ataaba and other forms of improvised poetry such as the mawwal and mijana have been used by Palestinians since the 1960s, \\"to express outrage and grief at the razing and appropriation of Palestinian villages by Israelis.\\" Ataabas are also performed by famous Arab singers, such as the Lebanese singer and composer, Wadi' al-Safi. ==See also== *Anasheed ==ReferencesBibliography== * * * * * * * Category:Arabic music Category:Palestinian music Category:Lebanese art ","title":"Ataaba"}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:P},data(){return{visibleCount:3,poemsData:R}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=3}}},F={class:"card-container"};function I(s,a,n,c,u,i){const m=f("PoemCard");return t(),o(h,null,[a[1]||(a[1]=e("section",null,[e("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"üéâLife Quotesü•≥")])])],-1)),e("section",null,[e("div",F,[(t(!0),o(h,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(r,g)=>(t(),b(m,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:a[0]||(a[0]=(...r)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...r))},"See more")):w("",!0)])],64)}const L=d(B,[["render",I]]),N=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"people/68.md","filePath":"people/68.md"}'),D={name:"people/68.md"},G=Object.assign(D,{setup(s){return(a,n)=>(t(),o("div",null,[v(L)]))}});export{N as __pageData,G as default};
