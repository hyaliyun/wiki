As the number and diversity of immigrants has increased dramatically in the United States (Camarota, 2007) there is increased need for clinicians to understand the cultural backgrounds of their clients. A culturagram is a family assessment tool that provides a graphical representation of various aspects of an individual and family's culture. It can be helpful in assessment and intervention planning for culturally diverse families. This tool grew out of the recognition that families are becoming increasingly culturally diverse and social workers must be able to understand cultural differences between and within families. When attempting to understand culturally diverse families, families needed to be understood within a cultural context. Assessing a family only in terms of a specific cultural identity, however, may lead to overgeneralization and stereotyping (Congress & Kung, 2013). A Puerto Rican family in which all members are American citizens and have lived in the United States for 20 years is very different from an undocumented Mexican family that emigrated last month. Yet both families are considered Hispanic/Latino. Even within the same family group, each member has had a different immigration and acculturation experience, as often family members immigrate at different times and some members may be U.S. citizens, while others are undocumented. Furthermore, family members who regularly work or attend school in the larger community may be more acculturated than those who stay at home. While the eco- map (Hartman, 1995) and genogram (McGoldrick, Gerson, & Perry, 2008) are useful tools in assessing the family, neither emphasize the important role of culture in understanding the family. The culturagram was developed to help in understanding the cultural background of culture in families (Congress, 1994, 1997; Congress & Kung, 2013). This tool has been applied to work with people of color (Lum, 2004), battered women (Congress & Brownell, 2007), children (Congress, 2001), older people (Brownell & Fenley, 2009), families in crisis (Congress, 2000), Mexican families (Congress, 2004a), Latino and Asian families (Congress & Kung, 2005), immigrant families with health problems (Congress, 2004b; Congress, 2013) and in family development theory (Congress, 2008). ==Creation of the culturagram== The culturagram represents an attempt to individualize culturally diverse families (Congress & Kung, 2013). Completing a culturagram on a family can help a clinician develop a better understanding of the family. First developed in 1994 and then revised in 2000 and again in 2009, the culturagram examines the following areas: * reasons for relocation * legal status * time in community * language spoken at home and in the community * health beliefs and access to health care * impact of trauma and crisis events * contact with cultural and religious institutions, holidays, food, and clothing * oppression, discrimination, bias, and racism * values about education and work * values about family‚Äîstructure, power, myths, and rules. Camarota, S. (2007) The culturagram has been seen as an essential tool in helping social workers work more effectively with families from many different cultures. Not only does it help the social worker achieve greater understanding of the culture of a family, it can also point the way toward future treatment. The culturagram can be useful in arriving at decisions about treatment planning and intervention. While using the culturagram the practitioner is required to look at the family in the here and now. Sometimes it is helpful, however, to construct the culturagram at different points of time, first at the beginning of intervention and then at a future point. In constructing the culturagram a retrospective approach is also useful. To truly understand immigrant families learning about an immigrant‚Äôs history is important. For example, the social worker can study what was the immigrants‚Äô experience in their country of origin and in transit. Often a developmental approach that looks at three stages of immigration (pre-migration, transit, and current situation) is helpful in working with immigrants. (Drachman, 2004). For example, refugees may have had particularly traumatic experiences in their country of origin and undocumented immigrants through the transit period that may affect their current psychological well being in the United States. Current practice looks to evidence that specific interventions are effective. Students and practitioners have used the culturagram in their professional practice with families and reported that it is helpful in engaging families in a nonthreatening way. In the use of the culturagram culture is viewed through a multidimensional lens, rather than as a monolithic entity. Initial evaluation of the culturagram has been positive, and there are further plans to assess further its effectiveness in promoting culturally competent practice. With the increased number of immigrants in the United States, there will be greater demand for culturally competent practice with immigrant clients and families. Social workers will need to study what methods and models are the most effective. The culturagram emerges as a useful method to better understand and plan interventions with immigrant families ==ReferencesPrint/archival References== *Brownell, P. (1997).

Bain disappeared on June 19, 1990, after telling her mother she was going to \\"check the tennis schedule\\" on campus. On June 22, her car was found with a large bloodstain in the back seat, but her body was never found. Baltovich consistently maintained his innocence throughout the trial and his lawyers suggested that the so-called \\"Scarborough Rapist\\", who was later identified as serial killer and rapist Paul Bernardo, might be responsible for the murder. He was nonetheless convicted and served eight years in prison until Baltovich's lawyers appealed, after which Baltovich was released on bail in March 2001. In December 2004, the Court of Appeal for Ontario set aside the conviction. In 2005, Ontario's Ministry of the Attorney-General announced that Baltovich would face a new trial on charges of second-degree murder, at an unspecified date, but the trial never took place. With no Crown case, the judge directed the jury to make a finding of not guilty on April 22, 2008. == James Driskell == James Driskell was convicted for the first-degree murder of Perry Harder, whose remains were found in a shallow grave outside Winnipeg, three months after his disappearance. Driskell was linked to the crime with three hairs found in his van that supposedly belonged to Harder, but DNA tests years later found that the hairs did not belong to the victim. In 2005, Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada Irwin Cotler used a special Criminal Code of Canada provision to quash the conviction, stay the charges, and order a new trial for Driskell, but the Manitoba Department of Justice decided not to order a new trial. It instead entered a stay of proceedings and called for a public inquiry, ending Driskell's conviction without exonerating him. == Anthony Hanemaayer == Anthony Hanemaayer was charged for breaking and entering, and alleged assault with a weapon against a 15-year-old girl at her home in Scarborough on September 29, 1987.https://www.aidwyc.org/cases/historical/anthony-hanemaayer/ During the trial in 1989, the Crown decided to withdraw the assault charges, however, Hanemaayer was still convicted and sentenced for breaking and entering charges. Hanemaayer pleaded guilty to avoid a lengthy prison sentence, and was sentenced to two years less a day in a provincial reformatory. He was released in June 1990 after serving sixteen months in prison, including eight months in pre-trial detention. At the time of the attack in 1987, the Scarborough area was being plagued by the so-called 'Scarborough Rapist', who was later identified as serial killer and rapist Paul Bernardo. Bernardo was convicted of numerous sexual assaults in Scarborough, sexual assaults elsewhere, and the murders of three girls he committed with his wife Karla Homolka. In 2006, Bernardo confessed to the 1987 assault and provided a detailed account to investigating officers, who also interviewed Hanemaayer several weeks later but did not inform him of Bernardo's confession. Hanemaayer became aware of Bernardo's confession in late 2007, after which he appealed to the Ontario Court of Appeal in June 2008. As a result, the court cleared Hanemaayer of the convictions and Justice Rosenberg stated that \\"it is profoundly regrettable that errors in the justice system led to this miscarriage of justice and the devastating effect it has had on Mr. Hanemaayer and his family.\\" In June 2010, Hanemaayer commenced a $1.1 million lawsuit for damages suffered as a result of his 1989 conviction for the assault. The courts made a decision not to compensate him, however. == Ivan Henry == Ivan Henry was convicted of multiple sexual assaults in Vancouver, Canada from 1980 to 1982. Similar assaults continued while he was jailed, leading to further investigation by police. His conviction was overturned in 2010. Henry was imprisoned for 27 years. == R√©jean Hinse == R√©jean Hinse was convicted for aggravated robbery and sentenced to 15 years in prison for his alleged part in the armed robbery in December 1961 of a general store in Mont-Laurier, Qu√©bec. He campaigned to establish his innocence based on the fact that he had been in Montreal, over two hundred kilometres away, at the time the crime was committed. In 1997 he was acquitted by the Supreme Court of Canada, which ruled that evidence presented at his trial was insufficient to convict him of aggravated robbery. Hinse was awarded $13.1 million compensation, payable by the Quebec and Canadian Federal governments, the largest wrongful conviction award in Canadian history. == Donald Marshall, Jr. == Donald Marshall, Jr., at the time 17, was convicted of murdering acquaintance Sandy Seale in 1971 and sentenced to life in prison. The two had confronted Roy Ebsary, an older man they encountered in Wentworth Park in Sydney, Nova Scotia, during the late evening with the intent to \\"roll a drunk\\". A short scuffle occurred and Seale fell mortally wounded by a knife blow. Ebsary admitted that he had stabbed Seale but then lied about his role to the police who immediately focused on Marshall, who was 'known to them' from previous incidents. Marshall spent 11 years in jail before being acquitted by the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal in 1983. A witness came forward to say he had seen another man stab Seale, and several prior witness statements pinpointing Marshall were recanted. Ebsary was subsequently tried and convicted of manslaughter. == Martensville satanic sex scandal == The Martensville satanic sex scandal occurred in Martensville, Saskatchewan, in 1992 where a mother alleged that a local woman who ran a babysitting service and day care centre in her home had sexually abused her child. Police began an investigation and allegations began to snowball. More than a dozen persons, including five police officers from two different forces, ultimately faced over 100 charges connected with running a Satanic cult called The Brotherhood of The Ram, which allegedly practiced ritualized sexual abuse of numerous children at a \\"Devil Church\\". The son of the day care owner was tried and found guilty, but a new investigation concluded that the original trial was motivated by 'emotional hysteria.' In 2003, defendants sued for wrongful prosecution. In 2004, Ron and Linda Sterling received $924,000 in reparations. == David Milgaard == David Milgaard was convicted of raping and murdering 20-year-old nursing assistant Gail Miller in 1969. When she was found on a snowbank, Milgaard and his friends, Ron Wilson and Nichol John, were picking up their friend, Albert Cadrain. Tipped off by Cadrain, who admitted he was mostly interested in the $2,000 reward for information, British Columbia police arrested Milgaard in May 1969 and sent him back to Saskatchewan where he was charged with Miller's murder. Cadrain testified that he had seen Milgaard return the night of Miller's murder in blood-stained clothing. Both Wilson and John were also called to testify against him. They had told police that they had been with Milgaard the entire day and that they believed him to be innocent, but they changed their stories for the court. Wilson later recanted his testimony claiming that he had been told he was personally under suspicion and wanted to alleviate the pressure on himself. Milgaard was sentenced to life in prison in January 1970. Milgaard appealed his conviction several times, but was blocked both by bureaucracy and by a justice system unreceptive to those who were not willing to admit their guilt. But in July 1997, a DNA laboratory in the United Kingdom released a report confirming that semen samples on the victim's clothing did not originate with Milgaard‚Äîfor all intents and purposes clearing Milgaard of the crime. The Saskatchewan government then apologized for the wrongful conviction, and Larry Fisher was arrested days later. Fisher had been living in Cadrain's basement at the time of the murder. == Guy Paul Morin == Guy Paul Morin was a suspect in the October 1984 rape and murder of his 9-year-old next-door neighbour, Christine Jessop. Morin was found not guilty of murder at his first trial in 1986, but convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment at his second trial after the Crown appealed. Improvements in DNA testing led to a test in 1995 which excluded Morin as the murderer, after which Morin's appeal of his conviction was allowed (i.e., the conviction was reversed), and a directed verdict of acquittal entered in the appeal. Morin is 100% exonerated with the discovery, in 2020, of Jessop's murderer == Willie Nepoose == Willie Nepoose was convicted in 1987 for the 1986 murder of Rose Marie Desjarlais. In 1992 the conviction was overturned when it was discovered one of the witnesses had perjured herself, the police had not disclosed some evidence, and evidence was discovered that he was with his brothers in a hotel at the time of the murder. == Rom√©o Phillion == Rom√©o Phillion was convicted of the 1967 murder of Ottawa firefighter Leopold Roy, after making a confession to police which he recanted two hours later. He spent 31 years in prison and five years on parole. The case was reopened in 2006, and in March 2009, the Ontario Court of Appeal overturned his 1972 murder conviction and granted him a new trial, in part because a 1968 police report establishing a clear alibi for Phillion had not been turned over to his defence lawyer in his original trial. == Thomas Sophonow == Thomas Sophonow was tried three times in the 1981 murder of doughnut-shop clerk Barbara Stoppel. Sophonow spent four years imprisoned but was acquitted by the Manitoba Court of Appeal in 1985. == Steven Truscott == Steven Truscott, at the time 14, was convicted in 1959 for the rape and murder of 12-year-old Lynne Harper. Truscott was initially sentenced to death, but this was later commuted to life imprisonment. He continued to maintain his innocence until 2007, when his conviction was declared a miscarriage of justice and he was formally acquitted of the crime. On July 7, 2008, the government of Ontario awarded him $6.5 million in compensation. == William Mullins-Johnson == William Mullins-Johnson, of Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario was found guilty of the first-degree murder of his niece, Valin Johnson, after a two and half week trial in September 1994. He was convicted after a jury trial in which now-disgraced forensic pathologist Charles Smith's evidence played a major role in determining the time of death, the cause of death, and whether the girl had been sexually assaulted. Mullins-Johnson had babysat Valin, 4, and her 3-year-old brother on the evening of June 26, 1993. When the girl's mother returned home, she did not check on her daughter. At 7 a.m. the next day she found Valin dead in bed. A local pathologist performed an autopsy on Valin. Then \\"consultation reports\\" were sought from Smith and four other specialists, based on tissue samples and other evidence from the autopsy. Smith was the only consultant to conclude Valin was sexually assaulted at the time of death. That contradicted the defence's point that Valin, who had a history of vomiting in bed, might have died of natural causes. The jury convicted, which the Ontario Court of Appeal upheld in 1996. The Supreme Court of Canada dismissed a further appeal in 1998. Attempts were made to clear his name based on available DNA technology, but the tissue could not be located by Smith, who was given the evidence by the pathologist who did the autopsy, until 2005, 11 years after the trial, when the missing tissue samples turned up in Smith‚Äôs office. William Mullins-Johnson was released on bail in 2005, pending review of his case. On July 16, 2007, a report by three expert pathologists (written unbeknownst to the lawyers working on his behalf) determined there was no evidence that the girl was sexually assaulted, and the Ontario Attorney General Michael Bryant said that William Mullins-Johnson's conviction ‚Äúcannot stand‚Äù and that he should be acquitted by the appeals court. On October 15, 2007 he was acquitted by the Ontario Court of Appeal.

The Huaiqing Bridge () lies to its north. Taoye Ferry stretches from Gongyuan East Street to the west of Huaiqing Bridge on Jiankang Road. During the Six Dynasties(229 A.D-589 A.D), it was renowned famous as a place where people said their farewells when leaving. Later it was included among the \\"48 Scenes of Jinling\\" ().Jinling (ÈáëÈôµ) is the former name of Nanjing. The \\"48 Scenes of Jinling\\" can be traced back in the Ming Dynasty. Now only about half of the scenes are extant. See also \\" ==Origin of the place name== It is said that Wang Xianzhi, the seventh son of Wang Xizhi (a renowned calligrapher of the Eastern Jin Dynasty), often awaited his beloved concubine TaoyeHere \\"Taoye\\" is the name of the concubine, also referred to as \\"Peach Leaf\\". to be ferried at the crossing. At that time, the inner arm of the Qinhuai River was wide and the water was particularly deep and rushed rapidly at the Taoye Ferry. Therefore, boats would often capsize if the ferrymen were not cautious enough about the rough waves and fierce winds. Hence, Wang Xianzhi composed a ‚ÄúSong of Taoye‚Äù for his dear concubine to calm her and ease her fears when crossing the river. Therefore, the ferry crossing was named as \\"Taoye Ferry\\" in honor of Wang Xianzhi, who awaited his beloved at this site. The song of his goes like this: :O sweet Taoye, you are my love. :Cross the river straight and be not afraid. :Though the boat sails hastily without an oar, :I shall await here and assure you a safe return. And Taoye sang a reply on the boat: :My face and the red blossoms reflect each other's glow, :And with grace they sway and gentleness I dance. :Though every girl has her fairness at time of youth, :I feel grateful as I am the apple in your eye. Here are the three songs of Taoye by Wang Xianzhi: (The first song) :O sweet Taoye, you are my love. :Cross the river straight and be not afraid. :Thought the boat sails hastily without an oar, :I shall await here and assure you a safe return. (The second song) :My darling Taoye, thou art my love. :Taoye joint Taogen as we two are never alone. :I hold your heart dear, and mine you cannot miss; :May the pleasures I give you move thee. (The third song) :My face and the red blossoms reflect each other's glow, :And with grace they sway and gentleness I dance. :Though every girl has her fairness at time of youth, :I feel grateful as I am the apple in your eye. ==History== For hundreds of years, there had been no bridge over the Taoye Ferry. It was not until the third year in the Shun Zhi Reign, 1646 that a bridge was built. In order to prevent further drownings, a man named Jin Yunpu in Xiaolingwei () sponsored a wooden bridge. The governor Li Zhengmao greatly appreciated Jin's contribution and named it ‚ÄúLishe Bridge‚Äù, which means that the bridge made it convenient for people to cross the ferry. Although the bridge is no longer extant, the street name of \\"Lishe\\" is still in use. Because of the bridge, the ferry structure gradually fell into disrepair during the Republican Era ().The Republican Era refers to the time of the Republic of China. A stele was erected at the original site of the ferry in 1984. Then, in 1987, a memorial arch as well as a pavilion were built north of Taoye Ferry. In 2003, the site was expanded into a heritage park which stretches from the east of Huaiqing Bridge to the Ping Jiangfu Road (), with a total area around 5000 m¬≤. The park's theme centers on the culture of the Six Dynasties and possesses a gallery of steles engraved with poems which are written by men of letters of past dynasties about the historical site. Some scenic spots which once were famous across the Nanjing city are also restored. ==References== * * == External links == * Category:Parks in Nanjing Category:Ferries of China Category:Transport in Nanjing ","title":"Taoye Ferry"},{"id":"35297548","text":"The Democratic National Alliance (abbreviated DNA) is one of the three main political parties in The Bahamas, officially launched on 12th May 2011. The current leader of the DNA is Arinthia Komolafe, the Party's first female leader elected on the 22nd February 2019. Mrs. Komolafe succeeded Mr. Christopher A. Mortimer who served as Interim Leader from October 24, 2017 to February 22, 2019. He was preceded by the party's first leader and one of 13 founding members, Branville McCartney. The Party has contested two General Elections in The Bahamas in 2012 and 2017 gaining 8.5% and 4.7% of the popular vote respectively. ==Senate Appointment== In December 2016, seven of the ten FNM House Members executed a vote of no confidence in then-Opposition Leader, Hubert Minnis. This was the first time that a no-confidence vote was staged in the Bahamas, either against a Prime Minister or Opposition Leader. After the seven members wrote a letter to the Governor-General on the matter, Member of Parliament for Long Island Loretta Butler-Turner was named the new Opposition Leader.http://www.tribune242.com/news/2016/dec/12/history-maker-leads- opposition/ Her appointment marked the first time that a woman, a Long Islander, or a person not leading the political party of which they were a member, was charged to be Leader of the Opposition. Subsequent to her appointment, Butler-Turner named then-DNA leader Branville McCartney as Leader of Opposition Business in the Bahamas Senate. This was the first time in which the DNA has been named to the upper chamber, and the first time in which a politician from one party appointed a member of a rival party to lead the Bahamas senate.http://www.tribune242.com/news/2016/dec/12/Loretta-appoints- Branville/ After months of coalition discussions between opposition parties in advance of the 2017 elections, both Turner and McCartney in a joint Press Conference affirmed that uniting the opposition was the best plan for ousting the Progressive Liberal Party government in the impending elections. However, less than three months later, McCartney shocked the country by announcing his resignation from the Bahamas Senate on March 2, 2017, claiming that Loretta Butler-Turner had only \\"sown seeds of confusion since assuming her post, bringing no real leadership or focused ideas to the fore\\".http://www.tribune242.com/news/2017/mar/02/breaking-news-dna-leader- branville-mccartney-resig/ It is widely believed that the confusion that stemmed from this Senate saga crippled the DNA's favorability just three months before votes were cast, resulting in a 43% decrease in the party's vote tally when compared to their initial election performance five years prior. == Post-2017 Election == After a brief post-mortem period following the 2017 General Elections, former DNA leader Branville McCartney announced in October 2017 that he would resign as leader of the party. Reflecting on his party's growth since 2011, McCartney thanked his supporters in his farewell address, remarking that his resignation was not \\"throwing it in the towel\\", but about \\"clearing a path so that other bright minds within our ranks have an opportunity to shine... so that our organization can move forward with new and fresh ideas.\\" Shortly thereafter and as mandated by the DNA's Constitution, McCartney's former deputy Christopher Mortimer was named the interim-leader of the DNA. A Special Meeting was then called for the election of a new Deputy Leader to fill the spot left vacant by Mr. Mortimer's new appointment, ultimately being filled by Arinthia Komolafe (the party's former Killarney candidate). Fully invested in the rebuilding process, Mortimer announced that The DNA would host its second National Convention between the 22nd and 23 February 2019, while also declaring that he would not run for leader of the party. The event proved to be the most competitive in the party's history with all national offices up for election - In the end, Komolafe defeated challenger Kendal Smith (former Fox Hill Candidate) by a margin of 6:1, and in so doing became the first woman to lead a major political party in The Bahamas. Buschme Armbrister beat out Brenda Harris-Pinder for the deputy leader spot, while DNA newcomer Omar Smith was successful over Rudy Dean in his bid for the chairman post. ==Electoral results== { class= style=\\"text-align: right;\\" - !

Gerontoplast development is generally seen to be the process of grana being unstacked, loss of thylakoid membranes, and large accumulation of plastoglobuli. ==Transformation of chloroplasts to gerontoplasts== The term gerontoplast was first introduced in 1977 to define the unique features of the plastid formed during leaf senescence. The process of senescence brings about regulated dismantling of cellular organelles involved in photosynthesis. Chloroplasts responsible for gas exchange in stomata are the last organelles to degrade during senescence, and give plants the green color. The formation of gerontoplasts from chloroplasts during senescence involves extensive structural modifications of the thylakoid membrane with the concomitant formation of a large number of plastoglobuli with lipophilic materials. The envelope of the plastid, however, remains intact. ==References * Category:Organelles Category:Photosynthesis ","title":"Gerontoplast"},{"id":"35297573","text":"Eug√™nio Bucci, when he was president of Radiobras.

It is designed to be 70 metres in width and was second to Chang‚Äôan Avenue\\" in Beijing at that time. It won the title of \\"The No.2 Street in China\\", \\"Chang'an Avenue in Taiyuan\\" and \\"The No.1 Street in Three-Jin\\". Yingze Street went through four additional periods of construction. Currently, it has 14 two-way motor roads (including two public transportation lanes), and two bicycle lanes, 2 pavements and 2 green areas. Yingze Street begins at Taiyuan Railway Station in the east and extends westwards to Nanhan Square crossing Fen River. It runs 10 kilometers and the western part of Fen River is called Yingze West Street. Landmarks which are situated along the street include Taiyuan Railway Station, May First Square, Yingze Park, Taiyuan Workers Cultural Palace, Yingze Hotel, Bingzhou Restaurant, China Coal Museum, Taiyuan University of Technology. Although Yangze Street is no longer the widest street in Taiyuan, it remains one of the symbols of Taiyuan. ==Name== There is a common story about the origin of Yingze Street's name: Supposedly, the city of Taiyuan had built the street in the 1950s, in order to welcome Mao Zedong‚Äôs inspection visit, since \\"ying\\" means welcome, and \\"ze\\" would be short for \\"Zedong\\". Actually, Mao Zedong never visited Taiyuan in his whole life. A more trustworthy account is that: Great Southern Gate \\"Yingze Gate\\" (which was removed) of the old Taiyuan City was just located in Yingze Street, and the street derived its name from Yingze Gate. The name of Yingze Gate was itself derived from the marsh outside the gate, which was related to South Wind Ballad: \\"The elegant south wind not only can relieve people‚Äôs bitterness, but also can increase people‚Äôs wealth.\\" Yingze gate is in the south of Taiyuan. It is named \\"Yingze\\", which means to greet the bounty of Nanfeng that helps people relieve their worry about hunger and poverty. Besides, Yingze Park, Yingze Bridge and Yingze District were all named after \\"Yingze\\". Yingze Gate was located in the south of Taiyuan, named as Yingze. It meant to greet the bounty of NanFeng and help people relieve their worry about hungry and poverty. ==Original establishment== In the 1950s, the mayor, Yue Weifan, of Taiyuan made a plan for the first city planning of Taiyuan after 1949. In the plan, Yingze Street was the most attractive part of the city plan. The planned Yingze Street is built on a dirt road, which was located in the south outside Taiyuan City. The designed width of Yingze Street was 70 meters, which aroused great dispute and this plan was criticized as \\"crave for things big and foreign\\" during the North China Bureau Meeting. At the beginning of the fifties, most streets in Taiyuan were only about 6 or 7 meters in width. The width of 70 meters was wide enough for 4000 cars passing on the street at the same time. However, there were only 800 cars in total in Taiyuan at that time. Facing the dispute, Yue Weifan advocated the conception of \\"Don't fall behind in 50 years, or you'll regret it in 100 years\\" on city construction and focused on the long-term development. Eventually, Yue Weifan overcame all objections and the construction of Yingze Street began in 1956. One year later, the first-stage construction was finished from the east of May 1 square to the west of Yingze Bridge. Because certain surrounding buildings could not be demolished, the final phase of construction resulted in a street width of 66 meters. ==Expansion== In 1976, the second-stage of the Yingze Street construction started. After two years‚Äô construction, the eastern part of Yingze street started from May I square to Taiyuan Railway Station (which was called \\"Yingze East Street \\" at that time). In 1985, the shortcut of Yingze West Street was started. One year later, Yingze East Street extended to Xiayuan (which was called Yingze West Street). In 1996, the cut-off of Yingze West Street extended to Nanhan Square in the west in the same year. In 2007, Yingze Street started the first expansion and reconstruction and it built the microcirculation road to ease the traffic pressure caused by vehicles of the surrounding roads. ==References== Category:Shopping districts and streets in China Category:Shanxi ","title":"Yingze Street"},{"id":"35297668","text":"Prem Adda is an Indian Kannada language action film.

The FSSAI consists of a chairperson & 22 members. The FSSAI is responsible for setting standards for food so that there is one body to deal with and no confusion in the minds of consumers, traders, manufacturers, and investors. Ministry of Health & Family Welfare, Government of India is the Administrative Ministry of Food Safety and Standards Authority of India. The following are the statutory powers that the FSS Act, 2006 gives to the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI). # Framing of regulations to lay down food safety standards # Laying down guidelines for accreditation of laboratories for food testing # Providing scientific advice and technical support to the Central Government # Contributing to the development of international technical standards in food # Collecting and collating data regarding food consumption, contamination, emerging risks etc. # Disseminating information and promoting awareness about food safety and nutrition in India == Location == FSSAI is located in 5 regions # Northern Region ‚Äì With head office at New Delhi. # Eastern Region. # North Eastern Region. # Western region. # Southern Region. ==Regulatory framework== The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India is a statutory body under Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006. The Food Safety and Standards Act (FSS), 2006 is the primary law for regulation of food products. This act also sets up the formulation and enforcement of food safety standards in India. The FSSAI appoints food safety authorities on the state level. The FSSAI functions under the administrative control of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. The main aim of FSSAI is to # Lay down science-based standards for articles of food # To regulate manufacture, storage, distribution, import and sale of food # To facilitate safety of food The FSS Act is a bucket for all the older laws, rules and regulations for food safety.

The Research and Development division is responsible for research with the following objectives: # Generate new knowledge that would help in continuously updating and upgrading food safety standards which are compatible with international organizations # Carry out evidence based studies for improving or building Rules and regulations. Quality Assurance FSSAI has been mandated to perform various functions related to quality and standards of food. These functions in addition to others include \\"Laying down procedure and guidelines for notification of the accredited laboratories as per ISO17025.\\" The FSSAI notified laboratories that are classified as: # FSSAI notified NABL accredited labs- 112 # State Labs-72 # Referral Labs-14 ==Standards== Standards framed by FSSAI are prescribed under Food Safety and Standards (Food Product Standards and Food Additives) Regulation, 2011, Food Safety and Standards (Packaging and Labelling) Regulation, 2011 and Food Safety and Standards (Contaminants, Toxins, and Residues) Regulations, 2011. The FSSAI has prescribed standards for the following: * Dairy products and analogues * Fats, oils and fat emulsions * Fruits and vegetable products * Cereal and cereal products * Meat and meat products * Fish and fish products * Sweets & confectionery * Sweetening agents including honey * Salt, spices, condiments and related products * Beverages, (other than dairy and fruits & vegetables based) * Other food product and ingredients * Proprietary food * Irradiation of food * Fortification of staple foods i.e. vegetable oil, milk, salt, rice and wheat flour/maida The development of standards is a dynamic process based on the latest developments in food science, food consumption pattern, new food products and additives, changes in the processing technology leading to changed specifications, advancements in food analytical methods, and identification of new risks or other regulatory options. Formulation of standards of any article of food under the Food Safety and Standards Act 2006, involves several stages. After consideration by the Food Authority, the draft standard is published (Draft notified), for inviting stakeholder comments. Since India is a signatory to the WTO-SPS Committee, Draft Standard is also notified in WTO. Thereafter, taking into account the comments received from the stakeholders, the Standard is finalized and notified in Gazette of India, and implemented. ==Consumer outreach== Consumers can connect to FSSAI through various channels. A GAMA portal for concerns regarding misleading claims and advertisements too is operated. == Applicable FSSAI License == FSSAI issues three types of license based on the nature of food business and turnover: *Registration: For Turnover less than ‚Çπ12 Lakh *State License: For Turnover between ‚Çπ12 Lakh to ‚Çπ20 Crore *Central License: For Turnover above ‚Çπ20 Crore Other criteria like the location of the business, number of retail stores etc. is needed while evaluating the nature of license applicable. ==See also== *National Institute of Nutrition, Hyderabad ==References * *Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006 Category:Food safety organizations Category:Government agencies of India Category:Consumer protection in India Category:Ministry of Health and Family Welfare Category:Food and drink in India Category:Food processing industry in India Category:Regulatory agencies of India ","title":"Food Safety and Standards Authority of India"},{"id":"35297735","text":"The following is a list of ecoregions in Spain, including the Canary Islands, Ceuta, Melilla, and the Plazas de soberan√≠a, according to the Worldwide Fund for Nature (WWF). ==Terrestrial ecoregions== Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub * Canary Islands dry woodlands and forests (Canary Islands) * Iberian conifer forests * Iberian sclerophyllous and semi-deciduous forests * Mediterranean acacia-argania dry woodlands and succulent thickets (Canary Islands) * Mediterranean woodlands and forests (Ceuta, Melilla, and Plazas de soberan√≠a) * Northeastern Spain and Southern France Mediterranean forests * Northwest Iberian montane forests * Southeastern Iberian shrubs and woodlands * Southwest Iberian Mediterranean sclerophyllous and mixed forests Temperate broadleaf and mixed forests * Cantabrian mixed forests * Pyrenees conifer and mixed forests ==Freshwater ecoregions== * Atlantic Northwest Africa (Ceuta, Melilla, and Plazas de soberan√≠a) * Cantabric Coast - Languedoc * Eastern Iberia * Southern Iberia * Western Iberia ==Marine ecoregions== * Alboran Sea * Azores Canaries Madeira * South European Atlantic * Western Mediterranean ==References== * Spalding, Mark D., Helen E.

Native speakers refer to the language as ≈ãyesha≈ã, meaning 'our language'.Kristine A. Hildebrant. 2004.\\"A Grammar and Dictionary of the Manange Language\\" in Tibeto-Burman Languages of Nepal: Manange and Sherpa, edited by Carol Genetti. 2-189. Canberra:Pacific Linguistics. It is one of half a dozen languages of the Sino- Tibetan family. Manang and its most closely related languages are often written as TGTM in literature, referring to Tamang, Gurung, Thakali, and Manangba, due to the high degree of similarity in the linguistic characteristics of the languages.Martine Mazaudon. 1978. \\"Consonantal Mutation and Tonal Split in the Tamang Sub-Family of Tibeto-Burman.\\" Kailash. 6:157-179. The language is unwritten and almost solely spoken within the Manang District, leading it to be classified as threatened, with the number of speakers continuing to decline. Suspected reasons for the decline include parents not passing down the language to their children, in order to allow for what they see as more advanced communication with other groups of people, and thus gain more opportunities. Due to the proximity of the district to Tibet, as well as various globally widespread languages being introduced into the area, use of the native language is declining in favor of new languages, which are perceived to aid in the advancement of the people and region.Martin Haspelmath, Uri Tadmor, and Kristine A. Hildebrandt. 2009. 'Loanwords in the World's Languages: A Comparative Handbook.' De Gruyter Mouton: Berlin. Print. ==Varieties== In the Manang Languages Project,https://mananglanguages.isg.siue.edu/atlas/ Hildebrandt, et al. list four varieties of Manang. *Manang *Nar-Phu *Gyasumdo *Nyeshangte ==Classification== The classification system of the language often varies throughout the literature, and multiple terms are often used to describe the same language family. Although the existence of the Sino-Tibetan family is agreed upon, it is here that the breakdown can vary. In this, Sino-Tibetan (or Tibeto-Burman) is broken down into Northeastern India, Western, Southeastern, and Northeastern. The Western group further breaks down into Bodic and Himalayan, each of which has its own subgroups, with Western Bodish being one of the four Bodic subgroups.David Bradley. 1997. \\"Tibeto-Burman Languages and Classification.\\" In Papers in South East Asian Linguistics: Tibeto-Burman Languages of the Himalayas. 14:1-72. Canberra: Pacific Linguistics. ==Phonology== There are 29 consonants in Manang, which are summarized in the table below. The contrastive status of the consonants in parentheses is questionable, as they are rare idiosyncratic in distribution. { class=\\" IPA\\"  ! colspan=\\"2\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  ! colspan=\\"2\\" Bilabial ! rowspan=\\"2\\" Dental ! rowspan=\\"2\\" Alveolar ! rowspan=\\"2\\" Palato-alveolar ! rowspan=\\"2\\" Retroflex ! rowspan=\\"2\\" Palatal ! colspan=\\"2\\" Velar ! rowspan=\\"2\\" Glottal - !plain !labialized !plain !labialized - ! rowspan=\\"2\\" Stop !voiceless p  tÃ™    à  k  ( î) - !voiced  p ∞ ∑ tÃ™ ∞    à ∞   k ∞ ∑  - ! rowspan=\\"2\\" Affricate !voiceless    ts t É      - !voiced    ts ∞ t É ∞      - ! colspan=\\"2\\" Fricative    s  É  Ç    h - ! colspan=\\"2\\" Nasal m m ∑  n   …≤   ∑  - ! colspan=\\"2\\" Approximant    l   j  (w)  - ! colspan=\\"2\\" Flap    …æ       }  Vowels  There are six oral vowels and five nasalized vowels, which contrast with the oral vowels. Length is emergent and not phonemic. { class=\\" IPA\\" ! !Front !Mid !Back - !High    - !Mid    - !Low   , }  Tone  There are four distinct tones in the TGTM sub-family, each of which differs by the overall pitch, as well as how breathy the sound is. Using a rating of 1 to 5, which correlates to low to high pitch respectively, the beginning and ending sound of every monosyllabic Manang word can be rated in order to determine whether the speaker increases or decreases the pitch, as well as breathiness. Of the four tones, the first stays consistently mid-level throughout the entire word, whereas the second tonal type starts at a 4 and increases in pitch to a 5. The third and fourth types decrease from the start to finish of the word, although tone-3 is higher pitched overall. The four tone classification is used for every related language, although the exact pitch levels can vary between them. For example, tone-3 in Manang is high pitched and clear, as discussed above, while tone-3 of Gurung is low and breathy. Essentially, every one of these languages has four potential tones in their words, but the exact pitch and clarity of each varies between languages. Words can have the same basic pronunciation, with the only difference being the pitch, making it possible to misinterpret words that have drastically different meanings. It is believed that a two toned system may have created the original makeup of these languages, although the original tones used are still unclear.Martine Mazaudon. 2005.\\"On Tone in Tamang and Neighbouring Languages: Synchrony and Diachrony\\". Proceedings of the Symposium Cross Linguistic Studies of Tonal Phenomenon. 79-96. Syllables The structure of syllables is represented as (C1)(C2)V(C3), with C1-3 corresponding to three consonants, and the V representing the vowel.Isao Honda. 2002. \\"Seke Phonology: A Comparative Study of Three Seke Dialects\\". Linguistics of the Tibeto-Burman Area. 25:191-210. Native speakers tend to agree that the most emphasis is placed on the first syllable of a word. Vowels present in the first syllable of words are held slightly longer than if located later in the word. However, from the minimal field research carried out, there is often not a distinguishable difference between syllable emphasis, and exceptions are also present. Terms that are exceptions often show stress on the last syllable, have vowels held longer on the second syllable, or both. Examples of exceptions include the Manang words for 'enemy', 'insect', 'forehead', 'button', 'graveyard', and 'leg'. == The Lexicon == The Manange lexicon is comprised largely of words that are clearly of Tibeto-Burman/Sino-Tibetan origin, as found in the glossaries published by Hildebrandt (2004), HoshiHoshi, Michiyo. 1986b. A Prakaa vocabulary: a dialect of the Manang language. Anthropological and linguistic studies of the Gandaki area in Nepal, Vol. II, 133-202. Tokyo: Institute for the Study of Languages and Cultures of Asia and Africa. and Nagano. However, due to more recent contact with Indo-European languages (primarily Nepali), some areas of the Manange lexicon have either been replaced with Indic (or English) forms, or else there is observed lexical switching between Manange and Indic forms in everyday Manange discourse. Hildebrandt reports that of a Loanword Typology Meaning database (found in Haspelamth and Tadmoor) of 1,127 word-forms, 133 show varying degrees of evidence for loanword status. This amounts to just under 12% of the lexicon, based on that database. However, Hildebrandt notes that loanwords are not used equally by all segments of the Manange-speaking population, and that there is a noticeable split between the vocabulary found in the daily use of Mananges who were born and raised in Nepali-speaking areas such as Kathmandu versus those born and raised in traditional Manange-speaking villages and towns in Manang District. Hildebrandt also notes that within- family borrowing is also likely, but is harder to determine because of extreme lexical similarity across Tibetic languages of the region. Loanwords in Manange are primarily nouns, including semantic categories of clothing, food, and concepts that encode the modern world. {  Manange Form Loaned Form Meaning - kot É·∫Ω  Éilik, …æe É åm 'silk' -  Çi …æil 'cotton' - t åuli tauli 'towel' - s åpi sop~s åbun 'soap' -  -- p ∞on 'telephone' -  -- …æel 'train' } Some loan blends (blended native and loaned materials) include 4t ∞a 1su≈ãku…æ 'pig', (2naka) 4p ∞ale 'rooster/cock', and k ∞ap å…æ 4t É ∞e 'newspaper'. Loaned verbs in Manange incorporate a \\"dummy affix\\" ti, and then carry the full range of aspect and modality morphology. {  Form Meaning - ti…æ 2ti 'pay' - 1s å…æ åp 1l å 'curse' - kelai 2ti 'thresh' - …æok 2ti 'forbid, refuse' } Manange has two classes of adjectives: verb-like adjectives and true adjectives (a smaller class), which do not host verbal morphology, but rather are morpho-syntactically distinct. There are very few observed loaned adjectives in Manange, but those that are observed are part of the true adjectives class, such as 3tsok'straight.' == Nouns == Nouns are the largest and most productive word class in the language. Nouns may take a definite enclitic ko, an indefinite enclitic ri, a plural enclitic tse, and may host case markers. 22njukju=tse ‚Äòdogs,‚Äô 22kola=tse ‚Äòchildren,‚Äô 52 Ço=tse ‚Äòfriends,‚Äô22ju≈ãp…ú=tse ‚Äòrocks‚Äô The plural enclitic may occur with both animate and inanimate nouns. However, when numerals are overtly present, plural marking is optional. Nouns do not identify gender, or whether something is inanimate or alive. Rather, there are completely separate words to identify men from women, and girls from boys. The most common way of making nouns plural is by adding tse to the end. As with English, there are some exceptions, and the entire form of the word may change rather than having an ending attached. The structure of compound nouns varies. One interesting compound structural type is where the leftmost word gives additional meaning to the word on the right. For example, the word ph√©mwi meaning 'coin', breaks down into phe meaning 'metal' and mwi meaning 'money'. The money is being described as metallic, making it known that the currency is in coin form rather than a paper bill. Like other related languages, Manange displays a sizable set of post-nominal locator nouns, that may or may not be followed by the locational enclitic ri~re. These nouns encode a wide range of topological relations, and the linguistic frame of reference system encoded in these forms is primarily relative (i.e. oriented on the speaker‚Äôs own viewing perspective). Some of these locator nouns are listed here: 52na≈ã ‚Äòinside‚Äô 22p…úri ‚Äòbetween‚Äô 22≈ãwontse ‚Äòfront‚Äô 44ka≈ãro ‚Äòupward‚Äô 44litse ‚Äòbehind‚Äô 22ti ‚Äònearby‚Äô 22tor ~ 22ja 22tortse ‚Äòleft ~ left hand‚Äô 22kje ~22ja 22kjetse ‚Äòright ~ right hand‚Äô 52t Éa≈ã ‚Äònorth‚Äô 42lo ‚Äòsouth‚Äô 44 Éer ‚Äòeast‚Äô 52nu ‚Äòwest‚Äô Proper Nouns The set of proper nouns in Manange includes people‚Äôs names, place names, names of deities, and names of the week or months, for example. These are not marked for plural, they do not take determiners, but they can be marked for case. Pronouns Pronouns include personal pronouns and interrogative pronouns. The first person plural pronoun shows an inclusive/exclusive distinction, while the third person pronouns do not show animacy or gender distinctions. Interrogative pronouns are used to form questions. Some of these are a single lexical item, and others are compounds or collocated word-forms. {   Singular Plural - First person 1≈ã…ú 1≈ãja≈ã(inclusive) 1≈ãi (exclusive) - Second person 3kj…ú 1kimi - Third Person 1khi 1khimi - Reflexive  colspan=\\"2\\" 4ra≈ã } { 1ta 'what' - 2hani ‚Äòwhere‚Äô - 2su 'who' - 2hatsu ‚Äòhow (manner)‚Äô - 2hacu≈ã ‚Äòhow (state)‚Äô - 2haju≈ã 'when' - 2phu≈ã k…úti ‚Äòhow many‚Äô - 1ta 3pitse 'why' } ==Status== The status of this language is currently rated as a 6b according to the Ethnologue rating system, classifying it as threatened. While the language is able to be spoken by older generations, and continuing to be passed onto newer ones, the rate at which it is being taught is sharply declining. The Nepalese Revolution of 1990 allowed for more freedom of languages, so identifying with a native ancestral language was of great importance to many. In reality however, fewer people actually spoke the languages they claimed to, leading to exaggerated speaker numbers being listed. Despite the relatively small number of speakers, allowing the language to die out entirely will be detrimental to the world as a whole. Even the least spoken languages hold stories, traditions, and potentially useful knowledge of the world, which will be lost if the language is gone. The endangered status of Manang means that researchers should attempt to collect as much detailed documentation and audio recordings now, before the language is potentially lost. == References Bibliography== *Carol Genetti (2008). \\"Syntactic Aspects of Nominalization in Five Tibeto-Burman Languages of the Himalayan Area\\".

Jean-Baptiste Besard (c.1567 ‚Äì c.1625) was a Burgundian lutenist, composer and anthologistJulia Sutton: The Lute Instructions of Jean- Baptiste Besard, in: The Musical Quarterly vol. 51, no. 2 (April 1965), pp. 345-362. notable for publishing two anthologies which collected a diverse range of musical works of the Renaissance and early Baroque periods and included instructions on playing the lute. ==Biography== Born in Besan√ßon, Besard studied law (Licentiate and Doctor of Laws, 1587), Besard, Jean- Baptiste at J. Rank. at the University of D√¥le. He went on to Rome, where he studied medicine until c.1595. While in Rome he also studied music with the famous lutenist Lorenzino del Liuto (Lorenzo Tracetti). In 1597 he was in Hesse where he may have taught the lute in addition to practising medicine and law. He then lived for a period in Cologne where in 1603 he published an anthology for lute, Thesaurus harmonicus, containing 403 arrangements for lute in French tablature of contemporaneous instrumental works and songs by various composers (including some by himself).Oxford Grove Music Encyclopedia: Jean- Baptiste Besard. The Thesaurus included an addendum on the method of playing the lute, De modo in testudine libellus, which was later translated into English by Robert Dowland.Varietie of Lute-lessons (London, 1610): \\"Wherento is annexed certaine Observations belonging to Lute-playing by Jon Baptiste Besardus of Visconti\\" Moving to Augsburg, probably around 1610, he continued practicing medicine and law, and possibly teaching the lute. In 1617, Besard published another collection in Augsburg: Novus Partus, sive Concertationes Musicae, containing approximately 60 solo and ensemble pieces, many of which were by Besard himself. He also wrote treatises on other subjects such as medicine, physics and history. Besard died some time after 22 October 1617 (the date of his last book), or perhaps in 1625 in Augsburg (Bavaria). ==Legacy== Apart from repertoire for the lute, music from Besard's anthologies have been a rich source of transcriptions and adaptations in later periods. Ottorino Respighi used some pieces in his Ancient Airs and Dances and a small number form part of the classical guitar repertoire. ==References== Category:1567 births Category:1625 deaths Category:Composers for lute Category:French Baroque composers Category:French male composers Category:French lawyers Category:French lutenists Category:People from Besan√ßon Category:University of Dole alumni ","title":"Jean-Baptiste Besard"},{"id":"35297763","text":"Ruan Snyman (born 9 March 1987) is a South African rugby union footballer.

On 2 April 2012, the ATR-72 turboprop aircraft operating the flight crashed shortly after take-off from Roschino International Airport, killing 33 of the 43 people on board. Translated article (Note: this translation was made automatically from the original (in Russian) and has low technical quality, lends itself only to specific queries). Investigation carried out by the Russian MAK revealed that the aircraft had not been de-iced prior to its take-off, even though it had been parked for hours in snowy condition. The crew of the flight were aware that ice and snow had accumulated on the aircraft, but decided not to de-ice it. == Accident == Flight 120 departed Tyumen, the largest city and the capital of Tyumen Oblast, to Surgut, a major city in Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug with 39 passengers and 4 crew members on board, on 07:33 local time (01:33 UTC). The weather was \\"snow-mixed rain\\" at the time and the temperature was at around 0 ¬∞C. At around 600 ft, the autopilot was engaged and the flaps were retracted. Almost simultaneously with the completion of flap retraction, the First Officer expressed surprise, and the Captain was recorded asking \\"what is this?\\" The aircraft began an uncommanded roll to the right, while the First Officer asked \\"what's this buffeting?\\" The crew immediately disengaged the autopilot. Within 3 seconds, the angle of the roll reached 40 degrees. The crew counteracted the right roll by applying ailerons and rudder, but were unable to counteract the subsequent left roll. As Flight 120's movement became more erratic, it also began to lose its altitude. As intermittent stall warnings appeared, the crew appeared increasingly confused; when the Captain asked the First Officer to report their situation to the tower, the First Officer replied with \\"Report what? Shit! What's the failure?\\" in a tone suggesting high levels of stress. At a left bank of 55 degrees and a nose-down angle of 11 degrees, the plane then crashed onto an open field near the runway at 07:34 local time (01:34 UTC) and burst into flames. The aircraft broke into several pieces. The accident occurred at about south west of the end of the main runway, near the village of Gorkovka. There were initially 31 fatalities (all four crew members and 29 of the 39 passengers) and 12 survivors from the 43 people on board. They were taken to the hospital in Tyumen. Two of the survivors later died of their injures, bringing the death toll to 33 and the amount of survivors to 10. The Interstate Aviation Committee confirmed this as the official toll in the final report. == Aircraft == VP-BYZ, the ATR-72 involved in the accident, seen in 2009 The accident aircraft was an ATR 72-201, manufactured by the French- Italian ATR and registered in Bermuda as VP-BYZ. The aircraft, msn 332, was manufactured in 1992 and first flew on 20 October of that year. It was delivered to TransAsia Airways on 16 December 1992 and subsequently served with Finnair and Aero Airlines before entering service with UTair Aviation in July 2008. ==Passengers and crews== Flight 120 was carrying 39 passengers and 5 crew members. UTair had sold 40 tickets for the flight, but a passenger from Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug failed to arrive on time. Nikolay Medvedev, a member of the board of Surgutneftegaz, was among the passengers. The Captain of the flight was 27-year old Sergey Sergeevich Antsin. He had completed his flight training in Ulyanovsk Civil Flying School and graduated in 2008, subsequently employed by Utair on the same year as a First Officer. He had accrued a total flying experience of 2,602 flight hours, of which 2,522 hours were on the ATR-72. He had also flown a Yakovlev Yak-18 and an Antonov An-26. The co-pilot was identified as 23-year old Nikita Vitalievich Chekhlov. He had attended Krasnokutsk Civil Flight School in Krasnokutsk, Ukraine and graduated in 2008, later employed by Utair on the same year. He had accrued a total flying experience of 1,825 hours, of which 634 hours were on the ATR-72. In 2009, he had completed his ATR-72 training in Sabenavita Training Center in Lithuania. == Investigation == Officials said investigators were focusing on the possibility of a technical malfunction as an eyewitness reported seeing smoke coming from the plane's engines as it came down. The aircraft's flight data recorder was recovered in good condition. The Interstate Aviation Committee (MAK) released their final report on 16 July 2013. They determined the cause of the accident to be that the aircraft departed without having been de-iced, despite the crew having noticed the presence of ice during taxi. Under the conditions of the flight, the wing flap retraction should have occurred at 160 knots; instead, the crew retracted them at 139 knots, which is approximately the speed at which flap retraction would be performed under normal conditions. Immediately after flap retraction, the plane began exhibiting unusual behavior, though the crew seemed to have trouble identifying the problem, with the first officer sounding increasingly stressed as the situation developed. The situational stress may have contributed to the failure to apply appropriate recovery procedures. An engineering simulation concluded that the airplane was not contaminated enough by ice as to be unrecoverable; had the crew applied forward pressure on the control column and extended the flaps back to 15 degrees, the plane would have recovered after losing just \\"300-400 ft\\" of their pre-stall altitude. The pilots seemed preoccupied with the banking and buffeting of the airplane, and were pulling back on the control column until impact. The report also identified a number of contributing factors that had to do with the airline's safety and training deficiencies. In November 2015, the court sentenced mechanic Andrey Pisarev and maintenance manager Anatoly Petrochenko to five years and one month in prison. Captain Sergey Antsin who died in the crash was also found guilty of the accident. ==See also== * Palair Macedonian Airlines Flight 301, similar crash in 1993 in which the pilot decided not to de-ice the plane == References  External links == *UTair **\\"UTair Aviation Official Statement.\\" (Archive) **\\"–û—Ñ–∏—Ü–∏–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ–µ —Å–æ–æ–±—â–µ–Ω–∏–µ –û–ê–û ¬´–ê–≤–∏–∞–∫–æ–º–ø–∞–Ω–∏—è ¬´–Æ–¢—ç–π—Ä¬ª.\\" (Archive) *Ministry of Emergency Situations **\\"ATR-72 plane crashed on April 2, 2012, at 5:50 a.m.\\" *Bureau d'Enqu√™tes et d'Analyses pour la S√©curit√© de l'Aviation Civile **\\"Accident on 2 April to the Flight UT 120 ATR 72‚Äì201 registered VP- BYZ.\\" (Archive) **\\"Vol UT 120 du 2 avril 2012 ATR 72‚Äì201, immatricul√© VP-BYZ.\\" (Archive) *Interstate Aviation Committee: **\\"2 –∞–ø—Ä–µ–ª—è ATR-72 ‚Ññ VP-BYZ.\\" (Archive) ‚Äì the Russian version is the report of record. ***Final report **\\"ATR-72 VP-BYZ 02.04.2012.\\" ***Final report *Ministry of Health and Social Development: \\"–ù–∞ –≤—Å—Ç—Ä–µ—á–µ —Å –ü—Ä–µ–∑–∏–¥–µ–Ω—Ç–æ–º –†–§ –ú–∏–Ω–∏—Å—Ç—Ä –¢–∞—Ç—å—è–Ω–∞ –ì–æ–ª–∏–∫–æ–≤–∞ —Ä–∞—Å—Å–∫–∞–∑–∞–ª–∞ –æ–± –æ–∫–∞–∑–∞–Ω–∏–∏ –º–µ–¥–∏—Ü–∏–Ω—Å–∫–æ–π –ø–æ–º–æ—â–∏ –ø–æ—Å—Ç—Ä–∞–¥–∞–≤—à–∏–º –ø—Ä–∏ –∫—Ä—É—à–µ–Ω–∏–∏ –ø–∞—Å—Å–∞–∂–∏—Ä—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ —Å–∞–º–æ–ª–µ—Ç–∞ –ø–æ–¥ –¢—é–º–µ–Ω—å—é.\\" (Archive) *Photograph of wreckage number 1 *Photograph of wreckage number 2 *Photograph of wreckage number 3 Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in 2012 Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in Russia Category:2012 disasters in Russia Category:Accidents and incidents involving the ATR 72 Category:Tyumen Oblast Category:April 2012 events in Europe ","title":"UTair Flight 120"},{"id":"35297793","text":"The Battle of Friedberg was fought on 24 August 1796 between a First French Republic army led by Jean Victor Marie Moreau and a Habsburg Austrian army led by Maximilian Anton Karl, Count Baillet de Latour. The French army, which was advancing eastward on the south side of the Danube, managed to catch an isolated Austrian infantry regiment. In the ensuing combat, the Austrians were cut to pieces. Friedberg is a Bavarian town located on the Lech River near Augsburg. The action was fought during the War of the First Coalition. Two French armies crossed the Rhine and thrust east into Germany in the Rhine Campaign of 1796. Jean-Baptiste Jourdan's Army of Sambre-et-Meuse advanced on a more northerly route while Moreau's Army of Rhin-et-Moselle took a more southerly path. Opposing them were Wilhelm von Wartensleben's Army of the Lower Rhine and Latour's Army of the Upper Rhine, both under the overall direction of Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen. Moreau defeated Charles at the battles of Ettlingen on 9 July and Neresheim on 11 August. As the outnumbered Austrians retreated, Charles looked for a chance to throw a superior force against one of the French armies. That opportunity came in late August when a cavalry brigadier Friedrich Joseph, Count of Nauendorf reported an opening. Leaving Latour's army severely weakened, the archduke rapidly marched north with 27,000 troops to join with Wartensleben in defeating Jourdan at the Battle of Amberg on 24 August. Unaware of Charles' maneuver, Moreau forged ahead and smashed the isolated Schr√∂der Infantry Regiment Nr. 7 at Friedberg. Unfortunately for Moreau, Jourdan's drubbing at Amberg and a second defeat at W√ºrzburg ruined the French offensive. By the beginning of September, the increasingly isolated Moreau was compelled to retrace his steps toward France. ==References== * * * Category:Battles involving France Category:Battles involving Austria Category:Battles of the French Revolutionary Wars Category:Battles of the War of the First Coalition Category:Conflicts in 1796 Category:1796 in Germany Category:1796 in the Holy Roman Empire Category:Battles in Bavaria ","title":"Battle of Friedberg (Bavaria)"},{"id":"35297798","text":"A road sign on Roosevelt Road.

It premiered on Comedy Central in the United States on April 4, 2012. In this episode, South Park's big Easter egg hunt is in jeopardy when there are rumors of a dangerous beast lurking in the woods nearby. Cartman tries to warn everyone that their lives are at risk if they participate in the egg hunt. No one believes him until he produces video evidence of the mysterious being. \\"Episode 1604 'Jewpacabra' Press Release\\". South Park Studios. April 2, 2012 The episode was written and directed by Trey Parker and was rated TV-MA LV in the United States. ==Plot== When Kyle finds his mother educating Cartman on Passover, because of a claimed interest in Jewish culture on Cartman's part, Kyle is suspicious. Cartman tells Kyle and his other schoolmates of a blood- sucking creature called \\"Jewpacabra\\" that preys on children, and mentions reports of incidents that he implies are the result of the creature. Kyle denounces this idea, and accuses Cartman of spreading lies, as there is no such creature. Cartman does not relent in his efforts, taking Butters with him to hunt the Jewpacabra, and showing video tape of their efforts to the executives of Sooper Foods, in an attempt to convince them to cancel their Easter egg hunt. The executives show the video to a team of experts at the Bigfoot Field Researchers Organization (BFRO), who confirm that it is evidence of an actual Jewpacabra, and tell Cartman that the creature will come after him because he exposed its existence. This frightens Cartman into hiding in a church with Token, Craig and Butters, whom Cartman pays $20 to protect him. Cartman is nonetheless abducted by the Sooper Foods executives, who dress him in an Easter bunny costume and chain him to a cement block in a field in order to sacrifice him to the Jewpacabra, which will make the Easter egg hunt possible. When Kyle appears before Cartman, Cartman pleads with him to help him escape, but when Kyle says he will only do so if Cartman admits he lied about the Jewpacabra, Cartman's inability to be honest about what caused his predicament causes Kyle to abandon him. BFRO then see Cartman and think he is a real life \\"Bunny-Man\\", so they shoot him with a tranquilizer and hope to make an Animal Planet program documenting their capture, but instead of taking Cartman as their evidence, they take the gun with which they shot him. Cartman then experiences a tranquilizer-induced dream. He awakes in Ancient Egypt amidst a swarm of locusts and downpour of frogs. He asks \\"his Hebrew friend\\" Kyle about it, who tells him the Plagues of Egypt are the result of a cruel and capricious God. He asks his father, the Pharaoh, (portrayed as a troubled but fair ruler) for advice, but their conversation (including a musical number) is interrupted by the Jews beginning to graphically slaughter lambs, so as to avoid the tenth plague. In abject religious terror, Cartman swears to God that if he is spared, he will become Jewish. Meanwhile, Kyle has a change of heart and frees the delirious Cartman from his captivity, takes him home, and puts him to bed. When Cartman awakens with no knowledge of how he got home, he classifies the experience as a religious epiphany, and announces to everyone at the Easter egg hunt that he has converted to Judaism. When he tells everyone that they should convert too by recognizing Jehovah as their true God and denying Christ, the assembled Christians label Cartman as a heathen and return to their hunt. Cartman apologizes to Kyle, saying he now knows what he feels like to be mocked by others for being Jewish, and the two wish each other a Happy Passover. The camera then pans up to a Star of David shining at the center of the Sun. ==Critical reaction== Jacob Kleinman of the International Business Times thought the episode was generally \\"solid\\", though not as funny as the previous week's episode. Kleinman singled out the ancient Egypt sequence as his favorite, and also thought that the manner in which Cartman's Jewpacabra stories backfired on him were \\"hilarious, historic and extremely shocking\\". ==References *\\"Jewpacabra\\" Full episode at South Park Studios. * * Category:Television episodes set in Ancient Egypt Category:Easter television episodes Category:Jewish comedy and humor Category:Television episodes about antisemitism Category:Passover television episodes Category:Blood libel Category:South Park (season 16) episodes Category:Television episodes about dreams ","title":"Jewpacabra"},{"id":"35297815","text":"Nelepsittacus is a genus of extinct New Zealand parrots that is closely related to the genus Nestor (the living kaka and kea). It consists of four species, of which three have been named so far. The species are all known from the early Miocene Saint Bathans Fauna from the Lower Bannockburn Formation in Otago in New Zealand. Features in their skeletons, namely the coracoid, humerus, tibiotarsus, and tarsometatarsus, that they share only with the Nestor parrots link them to that genus.Leo Joseph, Alicia Toon, Erin E. Schirtzinger, Timothy F. Wright & Richard Schodde. (2012) A revised nomenclature and classification for family-group taxa of parrots (Psittaciformes). Zootaxa 3205: 26‚Äì40 Flora from the Saint Bathans fauna fossil beds indicate these parrots were found in a subtropical rainforest habitat. Following the early to mid Miocene, there was a drop in temperature, which led to a loss of local flora and fauna. This loss of native Nelepsittacus parrots likely spurred the proliferation of Cyanoramphus parrots, a more recent migrant from the southwest Pacific. The largest known fossil species of parrot, Heracles inexpectatus, was described in 2019 from bones also identified as early Miocene St Bathans fauna. The generic epithet Heracles was named as an allusion to this genus, in one mythic tradition the Greek hero Herakles slew the king Neolos. ==Discovery and naming== The parrots of the Nelepsittacus genus were first described by Trevor H. Worthy in 2007. Most of the fossils of these parrots were found on the banks of the Manuherikia River in Otago, New Zealand. The genus is named for the Greek mythological figure Neleus who was the father of Nestor, reflecting the relationship between the genus and the extant Nestor. ==Species== (Listed in order of description) Nelepsittacus minimus Nelepsittacus minimus The type species, N. minimus is the smallest of the three (possibly four) known Nelepsittacus parrots. upright Nelepsittacus donmertoni Nelepsittacus donmertoni is the next-smallest species, and its bones indicate it was about the same size as the crimson rosella (Platycercus elegans) of eastern Australia. Their mandables are noted to bear more similarities to that of Strigops (the Kakapo) than Nestor. N. donmerton was named in honor of the late Don Merton, who was instrumental in saving the kakapo. Nelepsittacus daphneleeae Nelepsittacus daphneleeae N. daphneleeae is about a quarter large than the previously mentioned N. donmertoni. The humerus and ulna of this parrot suggest it was a little bigger than the Australian king parrot (Alisterus scapularis), but a little smaller than a galah (Eolophus roseicapillus). While it shares many skeletal similaries with the two previously mentioned species, N. daphneleeae is only tentavly classified as Nelepsittacus because of an inadequate representation of the tarsometatarsus. N. daphneleeae was named in honor of geologist Daphne Lee for her contribution to the knowledge of Miocene terrestrial ecosystems in New Zealand.

An impressive debut.\\" Indie Vision Music's Jonathan Andre wrote that the album \\"seeks to help the listener who is unsure of their identity, so that they can understand where the Lord is leading them both now and in the years to come.\\" Andre said that \\"Andy [h]as created 10 tracks that travel into the heart of the listener, and his passion is evident. As he brings issues to the foreground of striving and surrendering...is asserting itself as being not just another album, but forging its own identity, lyrically and musically. This is an album for those who want to journey deeper into the presence of the Lord.\\" Jesus Freak Hideout's Roger Gelwicks wrote the album is \\"Undoubtedly produced with an earnest heart for worship, the fruits of Cherry's labor found in Nothing Left To Fear succeeds in bringing an honest offering before the throne of God, and that's Cherry's intention. Some songs work better than others, but the fact still remains that more accomplished and exciting worship projects are more worthwhile to pick than Cherry's. Regardless, Cherry's passion for heartfelt worship hasn't gone unnoticed, and the weight placed on the Lord's glory seen in Nothing Left To Fear is proof.\\" Louder Than the Music's Jamie Ervin said \\"on a happy note, I give Andy Cherry a positive score and also positive potential. Can't wait for his second album.\\" The Phantom Tollbooth's Derek Walker wrote that \\"Nothing Left to Fear makes a great start.\\" Stereo Subversion's Russell Bush said \\"is not an album full of mere proclamations of devotion, but is infused with the honest questioning and lingering uncertainty that Andy has experienced throughout his journey.\\" ==Track listingCharts== Album {  - !

COFTA is a national network of Fair Trade Organizations, Fair Trade Support Organizations and Fair Trade Networks, all of which are certified members of the World Fair Trade Organization (WFTO).World Fair Trade Organization.

(Network of European Worldshops) and EFTA (European Fair Trade Association). (2001). Fair Trade Definition and Principles. PDF Available: http://www.fair-trade-hub.com/support-files/fair-trade- definition.pdf Fair Trade was defined as :\\" ‚Ä¶a trading partnership, based on dialogue, transparency and respect, that seeks greater equity in international trade. It contributes to sustainable development by offering better trading conditions to, and securing the rights of, marginalized producers and workers ‚Äì especially in the South. Fair Trade organisations (backed by consumers) are engaged actively in supporting producers, awareness raising and in campaigning for changes in the rules and practice of conventional international trade.\\" In the 2001 FINE document, the group also outlined 5 basic principles that act as criteria for trade to be considered fair. #Fair Trade organizations must commit to Fair Trade as the principle core of their mission. Organizations can do this by providing financial, technical and organizational support to producers, raise awareness for the issues, and campaign for change. #Trade must be viewed as an equal partnership, and be mutually beneficial to both parties, achievable through mutual respect, transparency and accountability. #Fair Trade must improve trading conditions by paying a fair price for produce in the regional or local context, pre‚Äêproduction financing, and must support long term trade partnership continuity. #Organizations must secure and improve upon producers and workers rights, providing living wage, safe workplace and ensuring that the labor standards defined by the International Labour Organization (ILO) are employed. #Finally, organizations must create a sustainable relationship with small producers and wageworkers, promoting long term economic and social improvements through unionization, training, human recourses and environmental development. ==History== History of Fair Trade The history of fair trade started in the late 1940s in America, with the emergence of a number of organizations whose goal was to target corporations that symbolize the abuse of capitalism.Staggenborg, S (2012). Social Movements. 2nd ed. Canada: Oxford University Press. p177. In 1946 the organization Ten Thousand Villages was created, and was the first official organization to support the idea of fair trade, and equal distribution of trade benefits.Kocken, M. (2006). SIXTY Years of Fair Trade: A brief history of the Fair Trade movement. PDF Available: http://www.european-fair-trade- association.org/efta/Doc/History.pdf The first formal World Fair Trade shops can also be traced back to America, where in 1958 outlets for needlework and small jewelry from Puerto Rico were sold at shop fronts. The movement also saw growth in Europe, headed by Oxfam UK who sold craft good made by Chinese refugees in Oxfam shop front. Oxfam UK protested against the inequality existent within global capitalism, and established the first Fair Trade Organization in 1964. The movement was gained further support after the 1968 United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), which was held in Delhi. The conference addressed the issues faced by developing countries on the international political floor, putting emphasis on the creation of equitable trade agreements. In 1973 Fair Trade Original was responsible for expanding the field of fair trade goods, importing the first fairly traded coffee from Guatemala. After the success of the Guatemalan coffee in the UK, the fair trade range expanded to include tea, cocoa, sugar, wine, spices and rice. By 2008, coffee accounted for 64% of Fair Trade certified products in the United States.Pay, E (2009). The Market for Organic and Fair-Trade Coffee. Rome. PDF Available: http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/templates/organicexports/docs/Market_Organic_FT_Coffee.pdf. In 2009, the market share of Fair Trade products in the UK was valued at ¬£300 million.BBC Green. (2009). Fair Trade. http://www.bbc.co.uk/bloom/guides/fairtrade.shtml#quickjump4 . Last accessed March 14th 2012. History of COFTA Established in 2004 by regional African producers, COFTA main goal was to give a voice to African producers. Thanks to the ratification of more Fair Trade recognized producers in the region, COFTA has become a continental Fair Trade Network. The COFTA business plan is based on network & member development, market access, advocacy & lobbying, and organizational growth and development.The United Nations Global Compact. (2010). Communication of Progress: Cooperation for Fair Trade in Africa. PDF Available: http://www.unglobalcompact.org/system/attachments/7853/original/COP_COFTA.pdf?1284535284. In 2009 COFTA begun work with Fair Trade producers to nurture the growth of 10 countries networks and initiatives, in Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda, Ethiopia, South Africa, Swaziland, Zimbabwe, Senegal and Egypt. The aim of those country networks is to provide a forum for cooperative support, conducting needs assessments among members, and developing a database of producers and their product within an area.Cooperation for Fair Trade in Africa. (2012). Our Programs. http://www.cofta.org/en/en/programs_networkdevelopment.asp . Last accessed March 14th 2012. COFTA claims that the success of the wider fair trade community's goals relies upon the creation of support networks for all members, and the continued maintenance of such relationships. COFTA has expanded to its current size of 70 member organizations and businesses in 22 countries, with importers buying in Europe, North America and the Pacific Rim. The organization's head office is located in Nairobi, Kenya. COFTA traded goods begun as predominantly handicraft produce, but have now broadened to include tea, coffee, vanilla, honey, dried fruit, juices, textiles producers. ==COFTA Membership== An African producer can become a COFTA member by meeting certain criteria created by the organization in combination with the WFTO. To become an official Fair Trade Organization an individual or group must complete an application form, ratify with the Fair Trade code of practice, as well as providing a two-year trade history and legal standing accompanied by three referees who must be members of the WFTO.Cooperation for Fair Trade in Africa.

The project was conducted from June 2008 to June 2011, where workshops and training session were provided for 50 handicraft producers, instructing vital business, financial and people skills needed to develop and maintain efficient business models. The workshops, conducted by 18 specially trained staff, attempted to promote the Fair Trade model of equality within the workplace, as well as the international market. The goal of this program was the creation of more adequate businesses that contributed further to incomes of the small Rwandan communities. The Rwanda producer Support Program received a grant of ¬£245,000 from the Big Lottery Fund (BIG), which was used to improve the business model of 50 handicraft businesses. From 2008-11 the program created 1,178 jobs, and 49 of the businesses reported an increase in income.Shared Interest Foundation. (2012). 2011 Annual Review: Rwandan Producer Support Project. PDF Available: http://www.shared- interest.com/forms/foundation-annual-review-2011.pdf Market Access Program (MAP) Introduced in September 2009, the Market Access Program (MAP) is designed to increase the competitiveness of African Fair Trade producers towards in the global market. A total of 24 organisations from Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda and Tanzania are currently involved in the MAP. The programs goal is a 25% increase of African products share in mainstream and Fair trade markets by 2012. ==Fixed-Price Criticism== Although Fair Trade organizations claim their framework is designed to create equality in trade and business, a number of organizations have experienced scrutiny. The Fair Trade Labeling Organization (FLO), a member of FINE and affiliate of COFTA, has been accused of limiting the market potential of producers, as well as limiting benefits provided to growers and workers.Haight, C. (2011). The Problem with Fair Trade Coffee. \\"Stanford Social Innovative Review\\" http://www.ssireview.org/articles/entry/the_problem_with_fair_trade_coffee. Last accessed March 14th 2012. FLO, as well as other members of FINE, offer a fixed price for farmers on coffee lots. The process leads to many farms in one region selling their product for the one fixed price; the product is then milled together and sold by FLO as one large lot. This process creates a uniform product, that although can gain a fixed or \\"fair\\" price, does not take into account varying qualities of the mixed product. Colleen Haight, Assistant Professor in the economics department at San Jose State University, California, claims that this restricts farmer's from achieving specialty status for their product, limiting opportunity for gaining higher revenue in the open market, thus creating a Fair Trade monopoly. Ga√´lle Balineau also identifies the Fair Trade West-African cotton as being subject to a quality problem. Balineau suggests that if Fair Trade operations were to offer a higher price for higher quality product, this would create incentive and encourage produces to improve quality.Balineau, G. (2012). Disentangling the Effects of Fair Trade on the Quality of Malian Cotton. Fondation Pour Les Etudes et Recherches sur le Developpement International. p 24.

His great-uncle, Karl Leimer, was instructor to educator Walter Gieseking who together published several piano textbooks. His talent was recognized by Gieseking, Carl Schuricht, and Wilhelm Furtw√§ngler who helped launch his career as a concert pianist. At the age of 18, he received a scholarship to the Berlin Conservatory, where he studied alongside Vladimir Horbowski and Winfried Wolf. The same year, 1938, Leimer made his concert debut in Berlin. In 1939, he continued his studies under Edwin Fischer. During the latter stages of World War II, Leimer was drafted into the Wehrmacht and was imprisoned in Livorno. The wartime injuries of his peers inspired his most familiar work, the Piano Concerto for Left Hand. The work was inspired by a college friend who lost his right arm to a grenade injury. In 1953, Leimer and the Vienna Philharmonic premiered the work with Herbert von Karajan conducting.Kurt Leimer and Herbert von Karajan conducting the Philharmonia Orchestra recorded the concerto in November 1954 in London, Kingsway Hall (Karajan Complete EMI recordings 1946-1984 vol. 1 CD 25). In 1955, he premiered his 4th Piano Concerto in C minor with Leopold Stokowski conducting at Carnegie Hall in New York. Richard Strauss was a particular champion of Leimer's concert career; he dedicated his Panathen√§enzug for piano and orchestra to Leimer. Leimer considered performing the premiere of Strauss' work to be a highlight of his career. In 1953 Leimer was appointed professor at the Academy of Music and Dramatic Arts Mozarteum in Salzburg, a position he held until his death.

The war memorial was designed and constructed by British sculptor Sydney March, of the March family of artists. ==Design== The Bromley Parish Church Memorial was erected in the churchyard of Saint Peter and Saint Paul, also known as Bromley Parish Church, on Church Road in Bromley, Greater London, England. In addition to a memorial cross in the churchyard, there was also a bronze plaque in the church which recorded the names of the fallen parishioners. The cross is made of Portland stone, a limestone quarried on the Isle of Portland in the English Channel. Its design is of the gothic period. The memorial cross is approximately five meters tall, with four carved figures. They represent Saint Michael, Saint George, Victory, and Peace. In addition, there are several inscriptions at the base of the cross: \\"In memory of the Men from this Church and Parish who gave their lives in the War of 1914‚Äì1919,\\" \\"Make them to be numbered with the Saints in glory everlasting,\\" and \\"Their names are recorded on a tablet in the Church.\\" The memorial cross is positioned in a rose garden, surrounded by a high beech hedge. ==Dedication== The Bromley Parish Church Memorial commemorates the parishioners of St. Peter and St. Paul who lost their lives in World War I. It was unveiled on 20 March 1921 by Major General Sir John Raynsford Longley, K.C.M.G., C.B. (1867‚Äì1953). Longley served in the military from 1902 to 1923, and then came out of retirement to serve during World War II. The war memorial was dedicated by the Bishop of Rochester, Dr. John Reginald Harmer (1857‚Äì1944). An Anglican bishop, he served as Bishop of Adelaide before accepting the see of Rochester. After the unveiling and dedication of the memorial cross in the churchyard, the dignitaries and parishioners returned to the church where the bronze plaque was unveiled. This was followed by a service, led by the Vicar, the Reverend J. K. Wilson. ==Bombing and rebuilding== Church tower of Bromley Parish Church, St. Peter and St. Paul. On the night of 16 April 1941, heavy bombing inflicted damage on many churches. Bromley Parish Church was nearly completely destroyed; the only portion which survived was the 14th century tower. The bronze tablet inside St. Peter and St. Paul, which formed part of the Bromley Parish Church Memorial, was lost in the air raid. However, the memorial cross in the churchyard survived. Bromley Parish Church was rebuilt after World War II. The foundation stone for the church was laid on 13 October 1949 by Queen Elizabeth, then a princess. On 14 December 1957, construction of the new church was completed. The new bells of the church incorporated some of the metal from the original. ==Sculptor== Both the memorial cross in the churchyard and the bronze plaque in the church were designed and made by British sculptor Sydney March. The son of George and Elizabeth March, he was born in 1876 in Stoneferry, East Yorkshire, England. He was the second of nine children, eight of whom chose careers as artists. Sydney March exhibited thirteen times at The Exhibition of the Royal Academy of Arts. He and his siblings established art studios at their family home of Goddendene in Locksbottom, Farnborough, Kent. He was a prolific artist whose focus was war memorials, and sculptures of British royalty and contemporary figures. Sydney, together with his sister and brothers, completed the National War Memorial of Canada after the untimely death of their sibling, sculptor Vernon March, in 1930. Other monuments for which Sydney March is renowned include the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers South African War Memorial in Northern Ireland, the United Empire Loyalist Monument in Canada, and the Lancaster Monument in England. His smaller-scale works include portrait busts of King Edward VII and Cecil John Rhodes, both in London's National Portrait Gallery. == References == Category:Military memorials in London Category:World War I memorials in the United Kingdom Category:Monumental crosses in England Category:Monumental columns in the United Kingdom ","title":"Bromley Parish Church Memorial"},{"id":"35298048","text":"Mundo guanaco is the first album released by the Argentine heavy metal band Almafuerte.

He was educated at Charles Burney's school at Greenwich. At the age of 17 Parkes started to work in his father's mill; in 1820 the factory at Warwick closed, and Parkes moved to Manchester, where he knew William Henry and John Dalton. He worked on inventions for the prevention of smoke, and then took up a new process for refining salt, near Woolwich. On 11 March 1823 he was chosen an associate of the Institution of Civil Engineers, and became a member on 26 December 1837. In 1825 Parkes removed to Puteaux-sur-Seine and set up in business; he was often visited by Louis-Philippe, then the Duc d'Orl√©ans. He took part in the July Revolution of 1830 in Paris, but lost his business and he returned to England. ==Drainage engineer== For Mr. Heathcote of Tiverton, Parkes carried out a plan for draining a part of Chat Moss, Lancashire, which he tried to cultivate by using steam power. The steam cultivation was a failure. Parkes, however, observed the deep cuttings on the bog, and found that deep drains began to run after wet weather, not from the water above, but from rising water. Draining the stagnant moisture from about a metre below the surface had a marked effect on the soil. Parkes's views replaced the convention wisdom of the time, of James Smith of Deanston. A Birmingham manufacturer on Parkes's suggestion produced in 1844 the first set of drain- cutting implements, and in 1843 John Reade, a self-taught mechanic, invented a cylindrical clay pipe as a cheap conduit for the water. Sir Robert Peel in 1846 helped finance drainage on Parkes's principle. Parkes, though, had less success with practical projects, was touchy, and rejected innovations in his field by John Bailey Denton and others. His last major work was for the War Department: the draining, forming and fixing of sea slopes in the fortifications at Yaverland and Warden Point, Isle of Wight, from 1862 to 1869. Immediately afterwards he retired from business. ==Death== Parkes died at Freshwater, Isle of Wight, on 16 August 1871. ==Works== Parkes's main contributions to agricultural literature were: * On the Influence of Water on the Temperature of Soils, and On the Quantity of Rain-water and its Discharge by Drains (Journal Royal Agricultural Society of England, 1845, v. 119‚Äì58); * On Reducing the Permanent Cost of Drainage (JRASE 1845, vi. 125‚Äì9); and * On Draining (JRASE 1846, vii. 249‚Äì72). To the minutes of the Proceedings of the Institution of Civil Engineers he contributed five communications: * On the Evaporation of Water from Steam Boilers, (1838) for which a Telford Silver Medal was awarded; * On Steam Boilers and Steam Engines (1839); * On Steam Engines, principally with reference to their Consumption of Fuel, (1840) for which a Telford Gold Medal was awarded; * On the Action of Steam in Cornish Single-pumping Engines (1840); and * On the Percussive or Instantaneous Action of Steam and other A√´riform Fluids (1841). Parkes was also the author of: * Lecture on Draining, 1846. * Work on Draining, with observations upon it by the Duke of Portland, 1847. * Essay on the Philosophy and Art of Land Drainage, 1848. * Fallacies on Land-Drainage Exposed. * A Refutation of a Letter by Lord Wharncliffe to P.

Since 1977, Bernius has collaborated with leading German orchestras and conducted the choirs of broadcasters, such as the SDR and WDR, the NDR Chor and the RIAS Kammerchor. In 1985 the choir decisively turned to early music, and Bernius became known as a conductor of historically informed performance. He has continued in Bach's music the several-voice-to-a-part approach, as opposed to the one-voice-per-part approach advocated by Andrew Parrott and Joshua Rifkin. The Historical Dictionary of Choral Music says that it the choir is \\"recognized for high musical standards and stylistic flexibility, winning many international awards.\\" Classical cites Bernius as leading \\"lively and intelligent performances.\\" He has collaborated with the Musica Fiata of Cologne, the La Grande √âcurie et la Chambre du Roy of Paris and the Tafelmusik of Toronto. In 1985/1987, he was instrumental in founding the Barockorchester Stuttgart and the Stuttgart festival of Baroque music, \\"Internationale Festtage Alter Musik\\" (now \\"Stuttgart Barock\\"). In 1988, Bernius, the Kammerchor Stuttgart and the Barockorchester Stuttgart performed the first concert of the first season of the Rheingau Musik Festival at Eberbach Abbey. On 23 June they performed two works by C. P. E. Bach, his Magnificat and the oratorio Die Israeliten in der W√ºste, with soloists Nancy Argenta, Lena Lootens, Mechthild Georg, Howard Crook and Stephen Roberts. Bernius and the choir toured the Far East in 1988 and the USA in 1989. Bernius began recording with Sony Classical in 1989. In 1992 he recorded Gluck's opera Orfeo ed Euridice with Nancy Argenta and Michael Chance. In May 1990 he was awarded the Dutch Edison Award for his recording of Symphoniae Sacrae III by Heinrich Sch√ºtz with the Musica Fiata, and in November 1990 he was awarded the French Diapason d'Or for his recording of Missa Dei Filii by Jan Dismas Zelenka with the Tafelmusik. In 1991 he founded the orchestra Klassische Philharmonie Stuttgart. In 2002, he became musical director of the ensemble Hofkapelle Stuttgart. On 10 July 2005, he conducted at the Rheingau Musik Festival Krzysztof Penderecki's Polish Requiem with the Kammerchor Stuttgart and the Sinfonia Varsovia at Eberbach Abbey. In 2006 he released a CD of Symphonies No. 5 and No. 6 by Johann Wenzel Kalliwoda on the Orfeo label, and also recorded Handel's Messiah (2009), Cherubini's Requiem (2010), and Johann Rudolph Zumsteeg's opera Die Geisterinsel (2011). In 2009 he was honoured with the Bach Medal of the City of Leipzig. Bernius has been teaching numerous workshops teaching, including in Belgium in 1995.

Umar threatened Harith, saying that if he continued to do so he would be burnt alive. This did not affect the frequency at which Harith's preaching, as a result of which Umar and a mob of people prepared a fire to burn Harith. At the moment that he was about to be thrown upon the fire Ali ibn abu Talib appeared, took Harith by the hand and led him away while the mob was dumbstruck. A meeting with Ali Perhaps one of the most important accounts involving Harith al-Hamdani is one in which Ali Ibn Abi Talib spoke to him at a time when Harith was old and in poor health. The account is in Nahj al-Balagha as follows: > :Al-Harith Al-Hamadani called upon Amirul Mo'mineen (Ali Ibn Abi Talib) with > a company of the Shias, and I was among them. Al-Harith walked with a bent > stature, hitting his walking stick hard on the ground. He was indeed ill. So > Amirul Mo'mineen came close to him and al-Harith had a good standing in his > estimation, and he said: \\"How do you find yourself, O Harith?\\" :He said: > \\"The vicissitude of time has overtaken me, and the dispute among your > companions about you and the three before you, has added to my anguish and > anger. :There are those who have gone to the extreme in their passionate > love for you, and those who are yours in moderation, and those who waver in > doubt, not knowing whether to proceed or recoil.\\" :He (Ali) said: \\"Suffice > it for you, O brother (from) Hamadan! Be it known that my best followers are > the people united on the middle path. To them should the extremists return, > and with them should the hesitants join.\\" :Then al-Harith said: \\"My father > and mother be your ransom, could you remove the filth from our hearts, and > make us as sure about our affair as seeing with one's eyes?\\" :He (Ali) said: > \\"That is enough for you. You are possessed by confusion. Surely, the > religion of God is not known by the people, it is recognized by the sign of > Truth. Know the Truth, and you shall know its people. O Harith, surely Truth > is the best and most sublime narration, and whosoever utters it is indeed a > fighter (a soldier of Truth). I have informed you the Truth, so lend me your > ear and inform among your friends who have sound judgement. :Be it known > that I am a slave of Allah, the brother of His messenger and his first > confirmer. I confirmed his truth when Adam lay between the spirit and the > body. Then, I am his first confirmer truth among you people. We are the > first and we are the last, and we are his special ones with distinction, and > we are his sincere ones, and I am his cousin, and his successor, and his > trustee and possessor of his confidence and secret. I have been given the > understanding of the Book, and blessed with sound judgement and decision, > and the knowledge about the generations and the relations. :And I am > entrusted with a thousand keys, each key opens a thousand chapters, each > chapter breaks into a thousand testament, and in addition, I am supported > and especially chosen and helped by the Night of Qadr, and that continues > for me and my descendants who guard against sins, for as long as the days > and the nights subsist, till such time when Allah shall inherit the earth > and all who are upon it. I give you glad tidings, O Harith, you shall > recognize me at the time of death, and at the Bridge, and at the Pool, and > at the time of division.\\" :Al-Harith said: \\"O my master, what is the time of > division?\\" He said: \\"Division at the hell-fire, when I will make a correct > separation. I shall say: This is my friend, so leave him; this is my > adversary, so take him\\" :Then Ali took al-Harith by his hand and said: \\"I > hold your hand the way the Prophet, held my hand and said 'Surely, on the > Day of Judgement, I shall hold the rope of Allah and cling to His safeguard, > and you, O Ali, shall hold fast to my safeguard, and your descendants shall > cling to your safeguard, and your Shias shall hold fast to the safeguard of > all of you.' So what will Allah do to His Prophet? And what will the Prophet > do to his successor? (The same shall we do to our followers). Take this, O > Harith, the summary of all the details. Yes, you shall be with the one you > love, and for you shall be what you have earned.\\" He said this three times. > :Then al-Harith stood up, pulling his cloak behind him, and saying: \\"After > this, I care not when Death meets me or I meet it.\\"Peak of eloquence, Nahj > ul-Balaghaauthor:Ali ibn Abi-Talib Compiler:Sayyid al-Sharif ar-Radi   == References == Category:Tabi‚Äòun Category:Tabi‚Äòun hadith narrators ","title":"Harith al-Hamdani"},{"id":"35298173","text":"Del entorno is the second studio album by heavy metal band Almafuerte. ==Tracks== All lyrics by Ricardo Iorio. # Del entorno - [From The Environment] # Lucero del alba - [Morning Star] # Hacia el abismo - [To The Abyss] # Por nacer - [For Being Born] # Amistades de tierra adentro - [Friends From Inland] # Los delirios del defacto - [Delusions of \\"De Facto\\"] # 1999 # De la carne - [About The Meat] # Hombre peste - [Pest Man] # Rub√©n Patagonia # Presa f√°cil - [Easy Prey] ==Personnel== *Ricardo Iorio - vocals, bass *Claudio Marciello - guitars *Claudio Cardacci - drums * Flavio Cianciarullo - producer Category:1996 albums Category:Almafuerte (band) albums Category:Spanish- language albums ","title":"Del entorno"},{"id":"35298181","text":"Midway, Minnesota may refer to the following places in the U.S. state of Minnesota: *Midway, Becker County, Minnesota, an unincorporated community *Midway, Mahnomen County, Minnesota, a census-designated place == See also == * Midway Township, Minnesota (disambiguation) ","title":"Midway, Minnesota"},{"id":"35298184","text":"An endangered language is a language that it is at risk of falling out of use, generally because it has few surviving speaker.

Jack Spade is the brand's line for men. Kate Spade New York competes with Michael Kors. In 2017, the company was purchased by, and is now part of, Tapestry, Inc., formerly known as Coach. == Business history == Store on Madison Avenue Temporary shop in New York  Prior to company creation  Katherine Noel Brosnahan (later known as Kate Spade) was born on December 24, 1962, in Kansas City, Missouri. She grew up in Kansas City and went to an all-girls Catholic high school. Eventually she moved to Arizona, where she attended Arizona State University and graduated in 1985. It is there that she met her future husband, Andy Spade. Katherine majored in journalism, while Andy majored in architecture. In 1986, after completing their education, the couple moved to New York City. It was in New York that Katherine worked as a style editor for Mademoiselle, but left in 1991 (with the title of senior editor/head of accessories) to start her own handbag line. To get inspiration, Kate browsed local flea markets and secondhand stores. She also researched the styles, fabrics, and potential production costs of making her own handbags. The team slowly worked their way up the social ladder until they were able to create a company that would be noticed by the public.  Early stages  Kate Spade New York was founded in 1993 by Katherine Noel Brosnahan and her husband/business partner Andy Spade. Kate Spade New York started after a suggestion from Andy when Katherine wasn't sure about her next career move after logging six years at Mademoiselle. Originally, the business started out with the Sam handbag and was only making colorful lively bags for consumers. Eventually, Andy withdrew $35,000 from his 401K account to fund the production of Kate‚Äôs handbags. Her debut line infused classic shapes, colors and fabrics into a now iconic square bag with a little black label sewn to the outside of the bag that said ‚ÄúKate Spade New York.‚Äù Their main target market at this time was the upper middle class. In 1996, Spade's company opened its first shop in New York City's SoHo. Kate Spade rose in eight months after a journalist at Cleveland Research Co. recommended buying the shares because of the brand‚Äôs growth potential. Everywhere people went in New York from about 1997 to 2000, it would have been impossible to avoid seeing women carrying that simple nylon bag. The business was one of the first of its time to go digital, by using iPads, cell phones, and computers, as a part of the daily routine when working at one of its stores. The company started from nothing, and after 1998 it started to expand, with sales totaling $27 million. By 2006, revenue was reportedly near $99 million. In 1999, Neiman Marcus Group paid $34 million for a 56% stake of the company. In 2006, Neiman Marcus Group acquired the remaining 44% stake in Kate Spade for $59.4 M, valuing the company at $134 M.  Later stages  In 2004, Kate Spade operated only 13 stores in the United States, and did not ship out of the country (Cohen 198). The company initially sold handbags, but eventually extended to include stationery, personal organizers, address books, shoes, beauty products, perfume, raincoats, pajamas, and eyewear clothing. It now has a full women's clothing line. The business‚Äô clothing and handbag lines are featured in retail stores all across America. Products are easily and continuously shipped around the world. By 2004, Kate Spade & Co. was worth $70 million, not including the complementary company Jack Spade. Kate Spade has over 180 stores around the world, and is sold in more than 400 stores worldwide (Cohen 198). Kate and Andy went from taking ‚Äúthe nothing black bag‚Äù to a creative personalized purse, now they create merchandise from the simple tote to home decor and bedding. In November 2006, apparel giant Liz Claiborne Inc. bought Kate Spade for about $124 million from Neiman Marcus Group. Andy Spade was initially in charge of company operations, but, in 2007 after the sale of the company, operational control was turned over to Liz Claiborne. Kate Spade expanded their retail stores to include Kate Spade New York Outlets. The brand has over 47 outlet locations across the United States. The outlets offer Kate Spade New York handbags, clothing, jewelry, and accessories at a discounted price. Kate Spade New York Products are also sold in major department stores including Nordstrom, Macy's, and Dillard's. Kate Spade New York handbags, clothing, jewelry, accessories, and home products can be found in these major department stores. Kate Spade Home products are also sold at Bed, Bath and Beyond. As of January 2017, Kate Spade New York also debuted an exclusive collection with Williams Sonoma, including dinnerware, glassware, and flatware. Tapestry, Inc. bought Kate Spade & Company in July 2017 for $2.4 billion. In June 2018, Kate Spade committed suicide in her Manhattan apartment. To respect the late founder, the company announced to donate $1 million for mental health awareness cause, starting with a $250,000 donation to Crisis Text Line. == Company == Kate Spade logo  Merchandise  Application of Kate Spade's Logo Kate Spade‚Äôs first handbag was sold in January 1993. Shortly after the initial products were released, new collections came out containing glasses, jewelry, and other small accessories (winter 36). In 2007, \\"kate spade at home\\" was launched as a home collection brand. It features bedding, bath items, china, and various items for the home and wallpaper. In April 2013, Kate Spade New York launched a new fragrance called Live Colorfully. Previous perfumes of the house include Kate Spade from 2003 and Twirl from 2010. Live Colorfully is a fragrance made in-house that marks the 20th anniversary of the brand. Each of Spade‚Äôs products sold are packaged, and each one has a card that gives a description of Kate and Andy‚Äôs journey to the top. == Jack Spade == Jack Spade was the complement to the Kate Spade brand for men. Operated as an independent business with its own visual identity, website, e-commerce platform, and physical stores for most of its twenty-three year run, Jack Spade was a line of furnishings for men. Jack Spade's product range included a full suite of furnishings for men best known for its bags, but also producing small leather goods (such as wallets, passport holders, coin purses, and phone cases), apparel (including all types of menswear), watches, and technology items.  Bags for Men  Jack Spade bags catered to men. Jack Spade bags are immediately identifiable by the brand label (or heat-embossed stamp) always placed in a corner of the bag. Original Jack Spade bags featured black cloth labels embroidered with \\"Jack Spade, Warren Street, New York\\" sewn onto a corner of a flap or panel. Newer bags feature \\"Jack Spade\\" heat-embossed or \\"Jack Spade, New York\\" on a cloth or leather patch. All Jack Spade bags include a cloth identification patch on the inside of the bag for the owner to fill out. All Jack Spade bags were named by series. For example, one of the brand's staple items was the Wayne duffel, reinvented season after season in new materials.  Messenger Bags  Jack Spade was known for its many series of messenger bags. Often designed as a single-compartment leather bag, secured with a flap closure and two snaps.  Duffel Bags  Jack Spade's series of duffel bags for men are one of the most recognizable bags from the brand. Series such as \\"Wayne\\" and \\"Nolan\\" were constant staples in the brand's collections. The Wayne duffel came in a variety of materials, mostly leather, nylon, and canvas; and included a roomy interior, four metal feet, and a detachable shoulder strap.  Coal Bags  Jack Spade took inspiration from bags engineers used to carry coal in the 1920s and fashioned large tote bags for men out of a heavy duty industrial canvas. Over the years, these coal bags were updated and redesigned with design elements such as pops of color (or \\"dipped\\" color in Jack Spade vernacular), and remade in leather, suede, canvas, and nylon. A special edition 20th Anniversary Coal Bag was designed in aged industrial canvas with \\"JACK\\" running down the right side of the front of the bag. These were available in both an aged blue canvas with white outline and a beige canvas with orange outline.  Demise of Jack Spade  All the Jack Spade stores were permanently closed in January 2015 following Kate Spade's acquisition by Tapestry (formerly the Coach Group) along with Kate Spade Saturday. This closure of brick and mortar locations prompted the transition away from \\"Jack Spade, Warren Street, New York\\" on the brands' iconic labels to simply, \\"Jack Spade\\" or \\"Jack Spade, New York\\". Notable locations included the Los Angeles boutique on Abbot Kinney in Venice, California, and the flagship boutique on Warren Street in New York City. Jack Spade‚Äôs separate and dedicated e-commerce platform went away in mid-2017, becoming a sixteen-item section titled ‚ÄúGifts for him‚Äù on the Kate Spade website. A full product line with staples such as the Coal Bag, backpacks, wallets, small leather goods, and apparel was carried on Amazon throughout 2017, but as of June 2018, Amazon appears to not be restocking inventory, discounting items and allowing them to permanently sell out. ==References== Category:High fashion brands Category:2000s fashion Category:2010s fashion Category:Bags (fashion) Category:Design companies established in 1993 Category:Fashion accessory brands Category:Dinnerware designers Category:Eyewear brands of the United States Category:2017 mergers and acquisitions ","title":"Kate Spade New York"},{"id":"35298210","text":"Midway is a census-designated place and unincorporated community in La Garde Township, Mahnomen County, Minnesota, United States.

It would continue in operation through both the heyday of post-war tourism on the old US Highway system (when roadside billboards advertised \\"Tucumcari Tonight!\\" and \\"2000 motel rooms\\" for many miles) and the years of decline which followed the loss of US 66 traffic to a newly constructed Interstate 40 in the 1960s. A resident of Tucumcari since 1923 (having arrived in New Mexico with her family in a covered wagon in 1915), Lillian Redman would operate the Blue Swallow for four decades, continuing independently after Floyd's death in 1973 and ultimately selling the motel in 1998. She then moved to a small house nearby and would often visit the property and its new owners until her death, at 89 years of age, in 1999. ==Restoration== Blue Swallow Motel on U.S. Route 66, 2012 After Lillian Redman sold the motel in 1998, owners Dale and Hilda Bakke made substantial restoration efforts, repairing the 1960 neon lighting, adding a vintage rotary phone system, replacing hardwood flooring with carpeting and monochrome television sets with color TVs. Each room includes vintage lighting and period furniture. Bill and Terri Kinder purchased the Blue Swallow in 2006, selling it to Kevin and Nancy Mueller in 2011. Robert and Dawn Federico purchased the motel in 2020. Named by Smithsonian Magazine as \\"the last, best and friendliest of the old-time motels\\", the Blue Swallow Motel remains in profitable operation today, benefiting from publicity generated by the efforts of various Route 66 associations to keep the old highway alive. Pixar's research for the 2006 film Cars included visits to this and many other well- known Route 66 landmarks; in the film, neon lighting at the Cozy Cone Motel displays Blue Swallow's \\"100% Refrigerated Air\\" slogan. acknowledges Dale & Hilda Bakke, The Blue Swallow Motel, Tucumcari NM at 1:54:48 in the movie's closing credits. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Quay County, New Mexico *List of motels == References  * Category:Hotel buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in New Mexico Category:Tucumcari, New Mexico Category:Buildings and structures on U.S. Route 66 Category:Hotels in New Mexico Category:Motels in the United States Category:Hotels established in 1941 Category:Hotel buildings completed in 1941 Category:U.S. Route 66 in New Mexico Category:1942 establishments in New Mexico Category:National Register of Historic Places in Quay County, New Mexico ","title":"Blue Swallow Motel"},{"id":"35298225","text":"The Cycle Is Complete is debut and only full-length studio album by the Canadian musician Bruce Palmer, released on September 4, 1970 by Verve Forecast.

There is no record of the death of a Sam Hide in the records of Dedham, Massachusetts though he is said to have died in 1732, however Sam Hide is noted at age 105 at Dedham as being a sachem, chief or sagamore who first and last were, to a greater or less degree, land-holders, and leaders of the multifarious tribes of New England. Hide was said to be a Native American, a great wit, and an infamous cider-drinker and liar. It has been speculated by James Wimer that Sam Hide may be a composite of several early anecdotes and stories. ==Tales== Numerous folk tales are told about Sam Hide; one such tale is that of Hide and a deer which illustrates his telling of lies or tall tales. In the story, Hide was in search of a glass of (hard) cider, so went to the house of a neighbor and offered, for a crown coin, to tell the man where he had shot and killed a deer. The man, wanting to find the deer meat, counter-offered half a crown, so Hide described a local meadow, then described a tree in that meadow, saying that the deer was to be found under that tree. The man went off to find the deer, but found none and returned home empty handed. Years later, he ran across Hide and accused him of trickery. Hide asked if the man would find it acceptable if an Indian told the truth half the time, and the man said he would. Hide then noted that he had told the truth about there being a meadow, and about there being a tree, just not about there being a deer beneath the tree, and concluded that he had told two truths to one lie, thus ending the matter. George Lyman Kittredge recounts tales of Hide having faithfully served the English in wars against Indian tribes and earning himself the name of a brave soldier. In one story, Hide is said to have killed 19, of the enemy, and tried hard to make up the 20th, but was unable: The claim of the 19 enemy may have been from \\"Hubbard's Indian Wars\\", 1677 edition. ==References== Category:Fictional Native American people Category:Fictional characters from Massachusetts Category:Tall tales Category:American folklore Category:1732 deaths Category:Year of birth unknown Category:People from Dedham, Massachusetts ","title":"Sam Hide"},{"id":"35298249","text":"Midway is an unincorporated community in Runeberg Township, Becker County, Minnesota, United States.

Asia Times Online. == Umbrella Revolution == Sit-in protests frequently referred to as the Umbrella Revolution began in September 2014 in response to the decision of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPCSC) on reforms to the Hong Kong electoral system. Benny Tai, one of the principals of Occupy Central with Love and Peace (OCLP), planted the seeds of a civil disobedience movement in January 2013 should the framework not conform to international standards. In light of the highly restrictive electoral framework announced on 31 August 2014, which was tantamount to Communist Party pre-approval of candidates allowed to present themselves to the Hong Kong electorate, students mobilised a class boycott to protest the decision beginning on 22 September 2014. The Hong Kong Federation of Students and Scholarism started protesting outside the government headquarters on 26 September 2014; OCLP kicked off their civil disobedience campaign on 28 September. Demonstrations began outside the Hong Kong Government headquarters in northern Hong Kong Island, and eventually a swell of protesters then blocked both east‚Äìwest arterial routes in Admiralty. Aggressive policing (including the use of tear gas) and attacks on protesters by opponents that included triad members, triggered more citizens to join the protests, occupying Causeway Bay and Mong Kok. Members of what would eventually be called the Umbrella Movement occupied several major city intersections, with the number of protesters peaking at more than 100,000. Government officials in Hong Kong and in Beijing denounced the occupation as \\"illegal\\" and \\"violation of the rule of law\\", and Chinese state media and officials claimed repeatedly that the West had played an \\"instigating\\" role in the protests, and warned of \\"deaths and injuries and other grave consequences.\\" In an opinion poll carried out by Chinese University of Hong Kong, only 36.1% of 802 people surveyed between 8‚Äì15 October accept NPCSC's decision but 55.6% are willing to accept if HKSAR Government would democratise the nominating committee during the second phase of public consultation period. The protests precipitated a rift in Hong Kong society, and galvanised youth - a previously apolitical section of society - into political activism or heightened awareness of their civil rights and responsibilities. Not only were there fist fights at occupation sites and flame wars on social media, family members found themselves on different sides of the conflict.Mary Ma (9 October 2014). \\"Zen 'unfriends' Lai ...\\" . The Standard Key areas in Admiralty, Causeway Bay and Mong Kok were occupied and remained closed to traffic for over 70 days. Despite numerous incidents of intimidation and violence by triads and thugs, particularly in Mong Kok, and several attempts at clearance by the police, suffragists held their ground for over two months. CY Leung then made the famous comments referring to representative democracy as a numbers game because \\"you'd be talking to half the people in Hong Kong [that] earn less than US$1,800 a month [the median wage in HK]. You would end up with that kind of politics and policies\\". After the Mong Kok occupation site was cleared with some scuffles on 25 November, Admiralty and Causeway Bay were cleared with no opposition on 11 and 14 December respectively. Throughout the protests the HK government's use of the police and courts to resolve political issues led to accusations from liberal media that these institutions had been turned into a political tools, thereby compromising the police and judicial system in the territory and eroding the rule of law in favour of \\"rule by law\\". Police inactions and violent actions throughout the occupation and severely damaged the reputation of Hong Kong Police, which was once recognised as the most efficient and professional police forces in the Asia Pacific region. The protests ended without any political concessions from the government, but instead triggered a torrent of rhetoric and propaganda from CY Leung and mainland officials about rule of law and patriotism, and an assault on academic freedoms and civil liberties of activists.Lau, Kenneth (13 February 2015). \\"Leung denies torpedoing uni selection\\" . The Standard. On 19 October 2014, Leung claimed that \\"foreign forces\\" were behind the protests. He said that the government had evidence for this claim that would be disclosed at an \\"appropriate time\\". In early 2015, in an event that was only open to the pro-government newspapers Ta Kung Pao and Wen Wei Po, he repeated his claim that there was significant evidence that foreign elements were behind the organisation of the Umbrella Movement but still did not substantiate his claims with evidence. As of 2016 Leung still has not provided any evidence. ==Failure of political reform vote== The Communist Party leadership in Beijing had hailed its package ‚Äì the electoral framework decision by the NPCSC of 31 August 2014 ‚Äì as momentous political gift of direct elections for their leader that the British never made to its colony, yet opponents derided the election from list of candidates pre-screened by a nomination committee composed mainly of pro-Beijing loyalists and business elites as violating the pledge for universal suffrage within the Basic Law and in the Sino-British Joint Declaration. Public opinion polls indicated even split between those who supported voting against Beijing's dictat, and those who believed that it was better to accept a flawed plan. The regime stated before the vote that there would be no compromise. In the face of staunch opposition by Pan-democratic legislators and their oft-repeated promises of veto and the insufficient numbers to secure a two-thirds majority, the HK government initiated a propaganda campaign to build public support to put pressure on the recalcitrant lawmakers. Secretary for Constitutional and Mainland Affairs Raymond Tam Chi-yuen confirmed on 2 June 2015 that reform proposals would be tabled to the Legislative Council on 17 June with no modifications. During the second day of the debate on 18 June 2015, right before the vote, Ip Kwok-him and Jeffrey Lam Kin-fung led a walk-out of pro-Beijing legislators after the chairman denied Lam's request for a 15-minute recess. Lam later explained that the walk-out was an impromptu attempt to delay the division so that his party member Lau Wong-fat, who was delayed, could cast his vote in favour of the Beijing-backed reforms. However, five Liberal Party legislators, Chan Yuen-han of the FTU and two other pro-Beijing independents remained in the chamber, so quorum was maintained; they voted in favour of the proposal. On the other hand, all 27 pan democrats and one pro-Beijing legislator Leung Ka-lau representing the Medical constituency voted against, so the government's reform proposal failed by 8:28. Since it had been widely expected the reform would be vetoed by being six votes short of the absolute majority stipulated by the Basic Law, the pro-Beijing camp's sudden walk-out resulted in a surprising landslide defeat that gave the world the impression there was no support for the reform proposals in Hong Kong. The fiasco was described by analysts as an \\"embarrassment\\" for Beijing, and those who had participated in the walk-out headed for the Central Government's Liaison Office to give their accounts for their actions. CY Leung and the Communist regime shifted the responsibility of the monumental defeat onto the Pan-Democrats. Leung said: \\"Today 28 legco members voted against the wishes of the majority of Hong Kong people, and denied them the democratic right to elect the chief executive in the next election\\". The Liaison Office blamed: \\"a minority of legislators, acting out of selfish interests\\". == Anti-parallel traders protests == As a result of rising tensions in society due to the volume of cross border parallel traders causing disruption to stores, transport, and the way of life more generally. Although the government said that it had put in place certain measures, such as blocking some 25,000 suspected parallel traders from entering Hong Kong, inspection of industrial buildings for use in violations of leases, the prosecution of cross-border visitors carrying an excess of the permitted quantity of milk powder, the problem of their disruption of daily life in the northern part of Hong Kong persists.\\"Milk smuggler jailed for two months\\" .

The Standard These protests brought worldwide media attention to the locals' grievances. == Lead in water scandal == On 5 July 2015 Democratic Party legislator Wong Pik-wan exposed the lead contamination in tap water at Kai Ching Estate, a newly constructed public housing estate in Kowloon City, thereby beginning the \\"Hong Kong watergate\\". The affair became a full-fledged scandal that undermined the credibility of the government after officials attempted to pass the blame onto a building contractor. It further intensified after the press and public discovered throughout the following months of more and more instances of lead contamination, including in schools and on other premises. Secretary for Education Eddie Ng failed to deal with the matter as reported contamination spread into local education establishments on 21 August. The public furore Ng earned when he initially refused to test the water supply in all kindergartens or install water filters to help protect the health and welfare of highly vulnerable children only abated when Chief Secretary Carrie Lam announced on 3 September that tests would be conducted on supplies to kindergartens across the territory to ensure the safe potable water for the most vulnerable schoolchildren. The government's handling of the crisis caused CY Leung‚Äôs support rate to hit a new low since he came to power in 2012. Results of a survey released in early September showed Leung was disapproved of across all demographics. Approvals amounted to 22 percent and disapprovals were 62 percent ‚Äì a net popularity of negative 39 percentage points; similarly, the satisfaction rate for the HK government stood at 21 percent while its dissatisfaction rate is at 50 percent ‚Äì a net of negative 29 points. == Cross- border abduction incident == The disappearances of five Hong Kong people related to an independent publisher and bookstore in October to December 2015 precipitated an international outcry. At least two of them disappeared in mainland China, one in Thailand. One member was last seen in Hong Kong, but apparently had found his way to Shenzhen, across the Chinese border, without the necessary travel documents. The October disappearances were muted, as unexplained disappearances and lengthy extrajudicial detentions are known to occur in mainland China. The unprecedented disappearance of a person in Hong Kong, and the bizarre events surrounding it, shocked the city and crystallised international concern over the possible abduction of Hong Kong citizens by Chinese public security bureau officials and their likely rendition, and the violation of several articles of the Basic Law and the one country, two systems principle. Following widespread suspicion for several months, it was separately confirmed in February 2016 by Guangdong provincial authorities that they had been taken into custody in relation to a case involving Gui Minhai. == Mong Kok unrest == In the run-up to the Chinese New Year, localist group Hong Kong Indigenous called for action online to shield the street hawkers, who sold Hong Kong street food in which they saw as part of the Hong Kong culture, from government health department's attempts at eradication. The protest on 8 February 2016 escalated to violent clashes between the police and the protesters that lasted until the next morning. The Hong Kong government classified the violent incident as a riot, while some media outlets and social media platforms have opted for calling the event \\"Fishball Revolution\\" (È≠öËõãÈù©ÂëΩ), in reference to the popular Hong Kong street food item. The Chinese foreign ministry blamed the violence on \\"separatists\\". The 66,000 votes polled by Hong Kong Indigenous member Edward Leung Tin-kei in the New Territories East by- election three weeks later was seen as a milestone for localism in Hong Kong politics. == 2016 visit by Zhang Dejiang == Zhang Dejiang arrived in Hong Kong on 17 May 2016 for a three-day visit in his capacity as the official responsible for Hong Kong and Macau affairs. Citizens questioned the need for the deployment of 6,000 police officers ‚Äì more than double the number that were enlisted when President Hu Jintao visited Hong Kong three years earlier. Security measures included suspending construction work for Sha Tin to Central Link of the MTR, the cordoning off an area within a one-block radius of his hotel, gluing down bricks outside the pavement near his hotel. The gluing attracted the satirical response from Trevor Noah at Comedy Central, saying \\"They started gluing down their sidewalks? So protesters can't grab the bricks and throw them?\\" Parts of the city were in lockdown by the 8,000 police officers who were eventually deployed, unprecedentedly in a counter-terrorist operation. Zhang was protected by heavily armed police officers and a 45-car cort√®ge. Despite the high level of alert, activists managed to put up massive banners in prominent locations to welcome Zhang ‚Äì whilst some banners recalled the Umbrella revolution slogan \\"I want genuine universal suffrage\\", another, which read: \\"End Chinese Communist Party dictatorship\\", was hung up and visible to Zhang's motorcade from the airport. Zhang spoke at a policy conference on Communist Party General Secretary Xi Jinping's One Belt, One Road economic project that aims to improve connectivity between China and Eurasia and met four pro-democracy legislators at a reception, ahead of a banquet. Pan democrats boycotted the event at which Zhang spoke. CY Leung received what commentators described a guarded endorsement from Zhang. == Wang Chau controversy == Within days of the 2016 legislative elections and the decisive victory of Eddie Chu in the New Territories West constituency, Chu made allegations that the government was in collusion with business interests, rural kingpins and Triads. He has received death threats for his advocacy and is placed under police protection. Although CY Leung initially attempted to blame Financial Secretary John Tsang and Chief Secretary Carrie Lam, leaked internal government meeting minutes directly implicated CY Leung in a decision to defer to the interests of Heung Yee Kuk leaders by scaling down a planned housing development in Wang Chau in the New Territories from 13,000 units to 4000 units, razing a greenfield site whilst avoiding brownfield site illegally occupied by the Chairman of the rural committee in Shap Pat Heung. == See also == * Carrie Lam as Chief Executive of Hong Kong ==References== Category:Hong Kong Government ","title":"Leung Chun-ying as Chief Executive of Hong Kong"},{"id":"35298304","text":"Ubang is a Bendi language of Nigeria.

The Form of Presbyterial Church Government is a document drawn up by the Westminster Assembly dealing with Presbyterian polity. It forms part of the Westminster Standards, and was adopted by the Church of Scotland in 1645. ==Contents== Church officers The Form of Presbyterial Church Government describes four church officers: pastors, teachers/doctors, elders, and deacons. The pastor is a \\"minister of the gospel\\", while the doctor is a minister who \\"doth more excel in exposition of scripture, in teaching sound doctrine and convincing gainsayers than he doth in application\\". The doctors are thus essentially theological professors, \\"of most excellent use in schools and universities\\". The elder is distinguished from the minister, and has the role of church governance, while the deacon is \\"to take special care in distributing to the necessities of the poor.\\" Church structure The Form of Presbyterial Church Government describes how the Church should be divided up in congregations, ordinarily \\"by the respective bounds of their dwellings\\". There ought to be at least one minister per congregation, along with others to govern. These people are to meet regularly, with the minister acting as the \\"moderator\\" of the meeting. The document calls this a \\"congregational assembly\\". The Form also argues for a body called the \\"presbytery\\" or \\"classical assembly\\". It is to consist of ministers and elders, and is to have oversight of a number of congregations. The third type of assembly is the \\"synodical assembly\\", which is above the level of the presbytery. Ordination The final section describes how ministers are to be ordained by the presbytery. It sets the minimum age for ministers at twenty-four, and includes a comprehensive list of points on which a candidate is to be examined. ==See also== *Ministers and elders of the Church of Scotland == External links == * The Form of Presbyterial Church Government Category:17th-century Christian texts Category:Westminster Assembly Category:Presbyterian Church organisation Category:1645 works Category:Westminster Standards ","title":"The Form of Presbyterial Church Government"},{"id":"35298321","text":"Ukpe and Bayobiri form a Nigerian dialect cluster of the Bendi branch of the Benue‚ÄìCongo languages. ==References== Category:Bendi languages Category:Languages of Nigeria ","title":"Ukpe-Bayobiri language"},{"id":"35298330","text":"Charles Edward Herbert (12 June 1860 ‚Äì 21 January 1929) was an Australian politician and judge.

After starting out at Vit√≥ria de Guimar√£es ‚Äì winning the 2013 Ta√ßa de Portugal and being the competition's top scorer in the process ‚Äì he signed with Porto, being part of the squad that won the 2017‚Äì18 Primeira Liga but also spending two years on loan to French club Nice. An international since 2015, Pereira represented Portugal at the 2018 World Cup. ==Club career== Guimar√£es Born in Lisbon of Cape Verdean descent, Pereira began playing youth football with local C.F. Benfica, signing in 2010 with Associa√ß√£o Naval 1¬∫ de Maio after a six-year spell at Sporting CP's academy. He moved to Vit√≥ria S.C. after only one year, completing his development with the Guimar√£es-based club. On 1 April 2012, Pereira made his first-team ‚Äì and Primeira Liga ‚Äì debut, playing 12 minutes in a 3‚Äì1 home win against F.C. Pa√ßos de Ferreira. He scored six goals in as many games in the 2012‚Äì13 edition of the Portuguese Cup, including the 2‚Äì1 winner in the final against S.L. Benfica as the Minho Province side won the tournament for the first time in their history. Porto On 16 April 2013, before the season was over, Pereira agreed to join FC Porto on 1 July, moving alongside teammate Tiago Rodrigues. He alternated constantly between the first and the second teams during his early tenure, also being reconverted into a fullback by manager Paulo Fonseca; his maiden appearance in the UEFA Champions League took place on 26 August 2014, when he replaced injured Casemiro late into the 2‚Äì0 home win over Lille OSC for the play-off round. In summer 2015, after only 33 first-team appearances in two seasons combined, Pereira was loaned for two years to French club OGC Nice. He made his debut in Ligue 1 on 12 September, playing the entire 0‚Äì1 home loss to En Avant de Guingamp. In April 2016, Pereira was voted as the French League's best full-back by the International Centre for Sports Studies. Leicester City On 17 May 2018, a ‚Ç¨25 million deal was agreed for Pereira to move to Leicester City. He made his Premier League debut on 10 August, playing the entire 1‚Äì2 away defeat against Manchester United. He scored his first goal while celebrating his 25th birthday, netting after a counter-attack in a 1‚Äì2 home loss to Everton. At the end of the campaign, he was voted both his team's Player of the Season and Players‚Äô Player of the Season. In September 2019, Pereira scored in consecutive wins over Tottenham Hotspur and Newcastle United both at the King Power Stadium, and the following 4 March he netted the only goal against Birmingham City in the fifth round of the FA Cup to put the Foxes into the last eight for the first time in eight years. Days later, he was ruled out for the rest of the season with an anterior cruciate ligament injury. ==International career== Pereira won 35 caps for Portugal at youth level, scoring 12 goals. He was part of the under-21 squad that finished second at the 2015 UEFA European Championship, contributing with four starting appearances and netting in the 5‚Äì0 semi-final drubbing of Germany. Pereira was called up to the full side for the second time on 6 November 2015, ahead of friendlies against Russia and Luxembourg. He made his debut in the former match, featuring eight minutes in the 0‚Äì1 defeat in Krasnodar. Pereira was selected by manager Fernando Santos for his 2018 FIFA World Cup squad. He made his debut in the competition on 30 June, playing the entire 2‚Äì1 Round of 16 loss against Uruguay. ==Career statistics== Club {  style=\\"text-align: center;\\" - !rowspan=\\"2\\"Club !rowspan=\\"2\\"Season !colspan=\\"2\\"League !colspan=\\"2\\"Cup !colspan=\\"2\\"League Cup !colspan=\\"2\\"Europe !colspan=\\"2\\"Total - !Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals -  rowspan=\\"3\\"Vit√≥ria Guimar√£es 2011‚Äì12 300000colspan=2‚Äî30 - 2012‚Äì13 2705432colspan=2‚Äî356 - !Total !30!!0!!5!!4!!3!!2!!colspan=2‚Äî!!38!!6 - rowspan=\\"3\\" valign=centerPorto B 2013‚Äì14 121colspan=2‚Äîcolspan=2‚Äîcolspan=2‚Äî121 - 2014‚Äì15 61colspan=2‚Äîcolspan=2‚Äîcolspan=2‚Äî51 - !Total !18!!2!!colspan=2‚Äî!!colspan=2‚Äî!!colspan=2‚Äî!!17!!2 - rowspan=\\"4\\"Porto 2013‚Äì14 142102030202 - 2014‚Äì15 50005030130 - 2017‚Äì18 272603070432 - !Total !46!!4!!7!!0!!10!!0!!13!!0!!76!!4 - rowspan=\\"3\\" valign=centerNice (loan) 2015‚Äì16 2600010colspan=2‚Äî270 - 2016‚Äì17 242100050302 - !Total !50!!2!!1!!0!!1!!0!!5!!0!!57!!2 - rowspan=\\"3\\" valign=centerLeicester 2018‚Äì19 352002000372 - 2019‚Äì20 273114000324 - !Total !62!!5!!1!!1!!6!!0!!0!!0!!67!!6 - !colspan=\\"2\\"Career Total !206!!13!!14!!5!!20!!2!!18!!0!!258!!20 } International {   ! colspan=3Portugal - !Year!!Apps!!Goals - 201520 - 201600 - 201710 - 201820 - 201920 - !Total70 } == Honours == Vit√≥ria Guimar√£es * Ta√ßa de Portugal: 2012‚Äì13 Porto * Primeira Liga: 2017‚Äì18 Portugal * UEFA European Under-21 Championship: Runner-up 2015 Individual * Ta√ßa de Portugal Top Scorer: 2012‚Äì13 * Leicester City Player of the Season: 2018‚Äì19 * Leicester City Players' Player of the Season: 2018‚Äì19 ==References* *National team data * Category:1993 births Category:Living people Category:Portuguese people of Cape Verdean descent Category:Sportspeople from Lisbon Category:Black Portuguese sportspeople Category:Portuguese footballers Category:Association football defenders Category:Association football wingers Category:Association football utility players Category:Primeira Liga players Category:LigaPro players Category:Vit√≥ria S.C. players Category:Vit√≥ria S.C.

It is located in Dalian, Liaoning, China. ==General Information== Having its origin in South Manchuria Railway's research department, which later became the Central Research Centre, the Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics was thus named in 1961 and moved its location from 129 Street (at Zhongshan Road) to the current address in 1995.Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics (Baidu Encyclopaedia) (in Chinese)Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics (Hudong Encyclopedia) (in Chinese) Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics is one of the leading research institutes in China. In the past half century, the institute has become internationally recognised for its research in catalytic chemistry, chemical engineering, chemical laser and molecular reaction dynamics, organic synthesis and chromatography for modern analytic chemistry and biotechnology. The institute houses one national laboratory, two state key laboratories, and five national engineering research centres. The Dalian National Lab of Clean Energy (DNL) is the first national laboratory in the field of energy research and integrates laboratories across DICP and other institutions. DNL is subdivided into 10 divisions and its research is focused on the efficient conversion and optimal utilisation of fossil energy, clean energy conversion technologies and the economically viable use of solar and biomass energy. DICP‚Äôs other main laboratories include the Laboratory of Instrumentation and Analytical Chemistry, the Laboratory of Fine Chemicals, the State Key Laboratory of Catalysis, the Laboratory of Chemical Lasers, the State Key Laboratory of Molecular Reaction Dynamics, the Laboratory of Aerospace Catalysis and New Materials, and the Laboratory of Biotechnology. In 1979, Chinese scientists at the Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics first proposed the structure of the nitroamine explosive Hexanitrohexaazaisowurtzitane, an explosive with greater energy then conventional HMX or RDX. In December 2019, a Chinese team involving scientists from the Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics and the company Feye UAV Technology developed a methanol-powered fuel system that kept a drone in the air for 12 hours, the FY-36. Fuel cell research at the institute had first started in the 1960s. == Basic Data == * Name: Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences * Established: 1949 * Director: Liu Zhongmin () * Address: No. 457, Zhongshan Road, Shahekou District, Dalian, Liaoning, China.

The cannon consists two pieces of different diameters. The cannon was made between the 12th and 14th century, probably by the Mohammeddan rulers of Gaur. It originally lied on the sand banks of Ichaganj. However, it is unknown that how it came in Ichaganj. It was used to protect the city of Murshidabad from north-western attacks. After the 1846 fire of the Nizamat Imambara the Imambara was rebuilt, then after the completion of the new Imambara the cannon was shifted to its present site by Sadeq Ali Khan, the architect of the sacred Nizamat Imambara under the suggestion of Sir Henry Torrens, the then agent of the Governor General at Murshidabad. == Etymology == It is heard that this cannon was fired only once and when it was done it produced a huge explosive sound, within a radius of about 10 miles. This sound made most of the pregnant women of the city to give birth to their child. This cannon is believed to get its name from there, so the cannon has been named, Bacchawali Tope. Bacchawali means the one who produces child birth while Tope means cannon. Thus, the total sums up to Bacchawali Tope, which means the cannon which produces child birth. == Features == The muzzle of the cannon is 1 foot and 7 inches. There are eleven rings fixed to the wrought iron barrel. Petals are drawn on this iron cannon which decorate the muzzle and one of the rings resemble a string of beads. Near the muzzle, on the upper half of the barrel surface, are 14 lines (7 on each side). These lines are of brass. There are 8 smaller rings attached at various points on the cannon. The cannon weighs around 7657 kg. and it is said that for a single shelling it requires about 18 kg of gunpowder. == Map  External links == * Category:Tourist attractions in Murshidabad Category:Cannon Category:Artillery of India Category:Military history of India Category:History of Bengal ","title":"Bachhawali Tope"},{"id":"35298430","text":"Frederic Charles Urquhart (27 October 1858 ‚Äì 2 December 1935) was a Native Police officer, Queensland Police Commissioner and Administrator of the Northern Territory. ==Early life== Frederic Charles Urquhart was born at St Leonards-on-Sea, Hastings, East Sussex, England on 27 October 1858. His father was an officer in the Royal Artillery and his uncle was a colonel in a cavalry regiment of the British Army. He was educated at Bloxham School in Oxfordshire and at Felsted School in Essex, but left to pursue a career at sea at the age of fourteen. He obtained a second-officer certificate in the merchant navy and served as a midshipman in the Royal Navy. In 1875 he migrated to Queensland, where he worked in the sugar and cattle industries. In 1878 Urquhart became a telegraph linesman at Normanton, Queensland. ==Native Police career== In 1882, Urquhart was appointed to the paramilitary Native Police as a cadet and was promoted quickly to the rank of second-class sub-inspector within the year. He was initially posted to the barracks near Georgetown and then to the Carl Creek camp on the Gregory River. While stationed at Carl Creek, Urquhart was ordered to go to Burketown and remove the Aboriginals residing there. He rounded them up and marched them east to the Leichhardt River where he threatened to shoot dead their traditional healer if he did not make it rain. In March 1884 Urquhart was transferred to the Cloncurry district to replace the Native Police officer, Marcus Beresford, who had recently been killed in the ongoing conflict with the local Indigenous population. Urquhart and his troopers were soon involved in skirmishes with the resident Kalkadoon and Maithakari peoples. He established a barracks outside of Cloncurry at a locality on the Corella River now known as Urquhart. In July 1884 a well-known colonist, James Powell, was killed by Aboriginals in the region and Urquhart and his troopers were mobilised to conduct a punitive expedition. Alexander Kennedy, a pioneer Scottish pastoralist in the Gulf Country district, accompanied Urquhart in his mission. Together this armed group conducted at least two large massacres of local Aboriginal people. Urquhart later wrote a poem entitled Powell's Revenge about one of the massacres. Some of the stanzas of this poem are as follows: A prospector in the area also came across Urquhart and Kennedy during their expedition. He described how they and the troopers had shot up one native camp, capturing an Aboriginal woman whom they were forcing to lead them to another Aboriginal camp. Kennedy returned to Cloncurry after four weeks out conducting summary justice, but Urquhart and his troopers patrolled the region for an additional five weeks \\"clearing up\\" any assemblage of native people they found. Urquhart became a close associate of Alexander Kennedy, who regularly accompanied him on other Native Police patrols. Kennedy later became a founding director of the Qantas airline company. Frederic Urquhart and his section of Native Police in the early 1880s While based at Cloncurry, Urquhart was involved in other massacres of Indigenous people. Probably the most well known of these was the skirmish later known as the Battle Mountain incident. Urquhart and his troopers were following up the killing of a shepherd at the Granada sheep station when they encountered a group of Kalkadoon. The Kalkadoon retreated to a rocky hill at the head of Prospector's Creek where they proceeded to pelt the Native Police with stones and spears. Urquhart was hit in the head and momentarily lost consciousness. He quickly recovered and led the Native Police in a flanking movement around the hill and proceeded to the massacre the resisting group of Kalkadoon. In 1888, Urquhart was transferred to conduct Native Police operations on the Cape York Peninsula. He was speared in the leg during a skirmish with Aboriginal people at the headwaters of the Wenlock River. This occurred as part of a punitive mission following the killing of colonist Edmund Watson near the Archer River. Urquhart and his troopers patrolled extensively around the peninsula and were also assigned a vessel named the Albatross to travel around various islands in the Torres Strait. In 1890, Urquhart played a major role in the rescue of survivors from the shipwrecked RMS Quetta. ==General police career== Urquhart was transferred to the civilian Queensland Police service in 1891 and returned to Cloncurry. He led police activities against striking workers in the area during the 1891 Australian shearers' strike. In 1894 he was assigned back to the Torres Strait and was based at Thursday Island. In the police vessel, the Albatross, he patrolled the pearling operations in the Torres Strait Islands, arresting striking workers. With John Douglas, Urquhart conducted an exploration journey around the Embley River in 1895. Urquhart was promoted to inspector in 1897 and was transferred to Brisbane in order to head the Criminal Investigation Branch (CIB). Soon after Urquhart was appointed to the CIB, a number of botched police investigations into high-profile murders such as the Gatton murders, led to the 1899 Royal Commission into the Queensland Police. The Commission found that Urquhart was neglectful in his duties, unsuited to the position and untrained in detective work. It recommended that Urquhart be transferred out of the CIB and a more competent person be appointed to the role as head of the investigative branch. Despite the findings of the Commission, many of the recommendations were not acted upon and Urquhart remained head of the CIB for many years after the enquiry. In 1905 he was promoted to chief inspector of police. Urquhart again had a leading role in crushing striking unionists during the 1912 Brisbane general strike, the first mass strike of its kind in Australia. Urquhart mustered 2,000 police officers and special constables to attack a group of 15,000 striking workers. The officers were armed with bayoneted rifles and Urquhart threatened to use live ammunition if the marchers didn't disperse. Urquhart ordered mounted troopers to charge through the crowd. Many people were injured with two people probably being killed. Around 500 strikers were arrested. ==Queensland Police Commissioner== On 1 January 1917 Urquhart was appointed as the 4th Queensland Police Commissioner, a position he held until 16 January 1921. Probably the most notable incident during his tenure as Commissioner was the Red Flag riots that occurred in Brisbane in 1919. Police, together with armed ex-soldiers returned from WWI, fought extended street battles with unionists and Russian immigrants during these riots. Many casualties were reported with Urquhart himself being injured during the fighting. Later that same year, police operations were again focused upon when several striking workers were injured in Townsville after police opened fire on a group of unionists with live ammunition. ==Administrator of the Northern Territory== In 1921 Urquhart was appointed Administrator of the Northern Territory. During his period as administrator he faced several issues including the widespread non-payment of taxes by civilians and his own personal health issues. He was also successfully sued by a union official for assault. He resigned from the position in early 1926. ==Poetry== Urquhart was considered a poet of some talent and published several collections of verse including The Legend of the Blacks and Camp Canzonettes. Many of his writings centred around relaying his experiences of shooting Aboriginal Australians. For instance the poem Told by the Camp Fire has the lines: ==Family and later life== Urquhart married Annetta Atkinson in 1891 and they had three children together; Miriam, Walter James and Hope Goldie Urquhart. Miriam married George Addison who was a WWI army officer and noted architect. Walter James Urquhart became the first officer to graduate from the Australian Army officer training program at the Royal Military College, Duntroon and he fought at Gallipoli and in Palestine during WWI. Walter remained with the army after the war but his career was hampered by charges of sexual assault of children. Frederic's youngest son, Hope Goldie Urquhart, was consistently in trouble with the law particularly in regards to driving under the influence of alcohol. In 1930, Hope was the pilot of a plane that crashed into the Brisbane River causing the death of a passenger. Hope was found guilty of flying in a dangerous manner and had his licence suspended. Frederic Urquhart retired to Brisbane in 1926. He died at St Helen's Private Hospital on 2 December 1935 and was buried in Toowong Cemetery. ==References== Category:1858 births Category:1935 deaths Category:Administrators of the Northern Territory Category:Australian police officers Category:Australian Anglicans Category:English emigrants to Australia Category:People educated at Bloxham School Category:People from East Sussex Category:Politicians from Brisbane Category:Royal Navy officers Category:Commissioners of the Queensland Police ","title":"Frederic Urquhart"},{"id":"35298476","text":"Lala is a Bantu language of South Africa, claimed to be extinct in some sources.

This process is vital to the preservation of the language, and has been changing among the speakers, such that some speakers have introduced a degree of voiced vowels in these final forms, which poises additional stress on the small population of speakers. The introduction in voicing the last syllable in words that typically are unvoiced is that it changes the traditional morphology of the language, pushing the original dialect towards language death, especially since the majority of speakers are older in age.  Blackfoot (Algonquian Language)  * Definitely Endangered * Visual Information/Cues teach the language The Blackfoot language consists of the loss of voicing in the last syllable of a word, which is typically inaudible. Certain inflections, or the use of inaudible vowels has been identified as \\"old Blackfoot\\" (traditional), and are not in frequent use by younger speakers. Similarly, a minority of Blackfoot speakers use the \\"soundless\\" suffixes, which is pushing the traditional language towards more extreme language endangerment and potentially language death.  Chipewyan (Athapaskan Language)  * Definitely Endangered * Most speakers from Mid-to- late adulthood The Chipewyan language exhibits morphological characteristics that are far more complex than the majority of European languages. This includes conditioning of tone and morphology of phonemes, as well as frequent contractions, elisions, metatheses, and consonantal substitutions. Chipewyan is mainly endangered due to its complex structure, which makes it difficult to decipher the morphological code, as well as the fact that the majority of the speakers are in their mid-late adulthood.  Assiniboine  *Critically Endangered *Also called Nakoda or Hohe Assinibone is one of the language divisions out of five main language divisions within the Dakotan group of the Siouan family. The sound of this language differs from the other languages in the group because it merges voiceless stops with voiced stops. There are reports that syllabics to have been used by Assinibone speakers. (A written character to represent a syllable). The Assiniboine language is spread over 2 communities in Canada, and is mainly used by older adults.  Central Ojibwe  *Definitely Endangered *Also called Anishinaabemowin, Ojibway, and Chippewa There are about 8,000 speakers in the central Ojibwe language, and it has been spread over 16 communities in Canada. The language is spoken from Ontario Canada to Manitoba. It is also spoken in places from Michigan to Montana next to the Great Lakes which is the home of the Ojibwe people. The language today is spoken by people over the age of 70. The people of the Ojibwe language note that double vowels in their language are treated as standing for unit sounds, therefore they are alphabetized after corresponding single values.  Lakota (Siouan Language)  * Critically Endangered * Mutually intelligible with Dakota language There are about 6,000 speakers in the Northern Plain States of North Dakota and South Dakota. Most native speakers are in their mid-50s. There is a growing interest to revitalize the language. At the Red Cloud Indian school, there are immersion classes for children to teach the language. However, at the moment, there are no children on the Standing Rock Indian Reservation that are fluent in the language. Within the next ten years, there will be children fluent in Lakota.  Dakota (Siouan Language)  * Definitely Endangered * Mutually intelligible with Lakota language There are about 20,000 native speakers, primarily in the North Dakota and South Dakota area, about 4,000 of which live in Minnesota. Dakota Wicohon is an after school camp that helps children learn the language, since it is not taught in the government-run boarding schools for American Indian youth. To help preservation efforts, technology like phraselators come into play, allowing learners to type in the words they want or orally speak the word they want and the machine will find it for them.  Dogrib (Northern Athabaskan Language)  * Vulnerable * Also called Tlinchon There are about 2,640 speakers of the language in the Canadian Northwest Territories from the Great Slave Lake to the Great Bear Lake. Dogrib phonology is rather intricate and is organized into 5 levels. The first person to write a book in Dogrib was Herb Zimmerman, who translated the Bible into the language in 1981. Unlike many other Native American languages, there are children who are fluent in the language.  Kaska (Athabaskan Language)  * Severely Endangered This was typically a First Nations speaking language, and mainly lived in northern British Columbia and some from southeast Yukon in Canada. People who speak Kaska today still live within the British Columbia and Yukon Territory area. The speakers are elders, such as grandparents, and their children and grandchildren would speak English. First Nations have started work to re- create and preserve their heritage language.  Ottawa (Ojibwe Language)  * Severely Endangered * Also called Odawa The number of people who speak the Ottawa dialect is unknown, though it is predicted to be around 13,000. Native communities received $5 million a year for 7 years (2007-2014) to help them in their efforts to preserve their languages and teach it to their children. The language is written with Latin letters and is a dialect of the Ojibwe language. Many descendants of migrants now live in Kansas and Oklahoma.  Stoney (Siouan Language)  * Vulnerable * Also called Nakoda or Alberta Assiniboine There are roughly 3,200 people who speak Stoney in the Northern Plains and the Alberta province of Canada. Stoney has a Latin alphabet. The stress is one of the harder aspects about the language. The Stoney Indian Language Project was created to help make a standard format of the Stoney language. The project created 6 books for adults and children, as well as a videotape for third graders.  Potawatomi (Central Algonquian Language)  * Critically Endangered * Related to languages such as Cree, Ojibwa, Menominee, Kickapoo, and Odawa The Potawatomi Language is critically endangered because there are only 52 fluent speakers left surrounding the Great Lakes region in Michigan. Within a decade, those who are fluent (the majority being the elderly) will soon be dead, causing the culture to die out with them, along with the knowledge of history that has been passed down from previous generations. English has become the predominant language spoken in homes due to the halt of parents speaking Potawatomi to children from 20 to more than 50 years ago. Currently there are no teachings of the language but there are revitalization efforts to bring back the language and the culture that could possibly be gone forever.  Tuscarora (Northern Iroquoian Language)  * Critically Endangered * With migration southward, historically situated in North Carolina Tuscarora entails complex morphology dealing with the copying of words, roots, stems, and affixes. There was a time where the Tuscarora language was spoken 'as the mother tongue,' used for all situations, (formal and informal) but now there are approximately only four to five remaining elders who are fluent in the language. All of the elders are around the ages of seventy to eighty years old, where a possible result is the extinction of the Tuscarora language.  Cayuga (Northern Iroquoian Language)  * Critically Endangered * The Native American Cayuga speaking people were split into two geographically separate groups. The Native American Cayuga speaking people are located in Oklahoma and Ontario. With the splitting of the people into two geographical locations, they now begin to differ in terms of language usage, morphology and phonology. In the setting of Oklahoma, Cayuga has become influenced by other tribes and has to a certain extent, lost their original vocabulary. Cayuga contains a pitch accent where the placement of it can be predicted by metrical structure and constraints on the structure of the syllables.  Upper Tanana Language  * Critically Endangered The Upper Tanana Language originally was spoken in only five villages, each with a different dialect. Those villages were Beaver Creek, Scottie Creek, Northway, Nabesna, and Tetlin. Today, the language is only spoken by about 95 people, above the age of 50, in eastern interior Alaska. Depending on the dialect, the Upper Tanana Language has about six to seven phonemic vowels. the primary difference between the dialects is by the pitch of the tone. Also a major factor in the split of different dialects is that different dialects have different vowel inventories.  Nootka Language  * Severely Endangered Despite misinterpretation of studies which describe the phonetic inventory of Nootka, these studies do not suggest that its phonemic inventory is the main reason why the Nootka language may be severely endangered. A process known as glottalization is a key factor in being able to articulate certain sounds in the language, called ejective consonants. Though these sounds are not in English, they not linguistically rare. Many languages with a large body of speakers, including Arabic and Amharic contain these sounds, an observation which immediately discredits this theory. It is clear that Nootka, like all Canadian aboriginal languages, is endangered due to social factors alone. ==References== Category:Languages of Canada Canada ","title":"List of endangered languages in Canada"},{"id":"35298492","text":"Lotus in Formula One can refer to: * Team Lotus the original Lotus team that competed in 1954 to 1994 * Team Lotus (2010‚Äì11) a team the competed in 2010 as Lotus Racing and 2011 as Team Lotus which is now Caterham F1 that competed in 2012. * Lotus F1 a team that competed in 2012, which used to be Renault F1 and competed in 2002 to 2011.

Salter trekked extensively throughout Nepal, often with her adopted Nepali son Premlal, to produce portraits of the diverse ethnic groups who inhabit different regions of the country. She has enjoyed a successful career as an artist with many exhibitions of her work, and is still widely respected in Nepal and abroad for her representations of the country's many ethnicities.VOW, Voice of Women magazine, April 2011. Retrieved on 2 April 2012 Over the years she has helped and befriended many people including Jane Wilson-Howarth and features in her travel memoir. ==Faces of Nepal== Salter collaborated with the scholar and author Dr. Harka Gurung on a book entitled \\"Faces of Nepal.\\" The book is a unique ethnographic study of the various ethnic groups of Nepal which combines Gurung's writings about each ethnicity with Salter's drawings and paintings of members of the groups. The book was published in 1996 and received much critical acclaim.Nepali Times , 25 July 2003. Retrieved on 2 April 2012 In 1997 Salter was decorated with the \\"Gorkha Dakshin Bahu\\" award by the then Nepali king, Birendra Bir Bikram Shah Dev. She has worked with the organisation Maiti Nepal, which rescues Nepali girls who were trafficked and sold into prostitution. Salter produced a series of paintings entitled \\"All Our Daughters\\" of girls who had been rescued by Maiti Nepal. ==Kathmandu Animal Treatment Centre== Salter had long been disturbed by the suffering of the tens of thousands of street dogs in Kathmandu. Many are afflicted with malnutrition, injuries from collisions with vehicles, and infectious diseases. The government poisoned more than 10,000 street dogs every year with strychnine to attempt to reduce their population. While travelling in India in 2003, Ms. Salter visited an organisation called \\"Help in Suffering\\" in Jaipur that used spay/neuter surgeries to reduce the street dog population, an approach that was in its infancy in the developing world. Salter recognised that this can be applied on a large scale in Kathmandu and was immediately inspired to take action. At age 68, she stepped back from her career as an artist to devote her time to animal welfare. Ms. Salter committed her life's financial savings to building and starting the Kathmandu Animal Treatment Centre (KAT Centre), the first organisation in Nepal working to improve the dog population. The KAT Centre was registered with the government of Nepal as a charity organisation in 2003 and opened on 9 May 2004. It continues to be the largest companion animal welfare organisation in Nepal.VOW, Voice of Women magazine, April 2011. Retrieved on 2 April 2012 The KAT Centre's goals are to humanely produce a healthy, stable street dog population and to eliminate rabies in Kathmandu. The core program engenders a sustainable reduction in the canine population through spay/neuter surgeries. As KAT's staff collects every female dog they can in an area to sterilise them and vaccinate them for rabies, they also provide all needed veterinary treatment to street animals in the same area. Salter knew that to effect an enduring impact, she must transform people's attitudes about the dogs in their city. Therefore, the KAT Centre's animal care is complemented by an education program. KAT teaches children and adults about compassion for animals, street dog welfare, responsible pet ownership, and rabies awareness.ECS Magazine , March 2004. Retrieved on 2 April 2012 Salter's approach has produced a visible transformation in the city of Kathmandu, in the number of stray dogs, their health, and people's attitudes towards them. Ms. Salter continues to lead the Kathmandu Animal Treatment Centre. She was the driving force behind the organisation's long-term planning, guiding it towards its goals of creating a healthy, stable dog population and eliminating rabies in Kathmandu. As the public persona of the KAT Centre, Ms. Salter conducted much of the organisation's fundraising and donor relations.VOW, Voice of Women magazine, April 2011. Retrieved on 2 April 2012 In 2010 Salter received the prestigious \\"Extraordinary Commitment and Achievement award\\" presented by Humane Society International, and in the UK New Years Honours List for 2013 she received an MBE from Queen Elizabeth II for services to animal welfare in Nepal. http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/about-us/what-we-do/protocol/honours/dso-list#MBE Jan died in Lyme Regis on April 29th 2018. ==References * KAT Centre‚Äôs website * KAT Centre's Facebook page Category:Keepers of animal sanctuaries Category:British artists Category:1936 births Category:2018 deaths ","title":"Jan Salter"},{"id":"35298526","text":"Ascalenia antiqua is a moth in the family Cosmopterigidae.

Having played in every grade as a hurler, he was centre-forward on the college's senior hurling team. On 11 March 2010, Dowling scored a point from play when Ardscoil R√≠s defeated Thurles CBS in the final of the Harty Cup. On 27 February 2011, Dowling was again at centre-forward when Ardscoil R√≠s retained the Harty Cup title after a 3-19 to 0-03 defeat of C.B.S. Charleville in the final. Club Dowling joined the Na Piarsaigh club at a young age and played in all grades at juvenile and underage levels, enjoying championship success in the under-16, minor and under-21 grades. On 2 October 2011, Dowling scored 1-10 from right corner-forward in Na Piarsaigh's 2-18 to 0-13 defeat of Adare to win their first Limerick Championship. He later won a Munster Championship medal following a 1-13 to 0-09 defeat of Crusheen in the final. After surrendering their titles the following year, Dowling won a second Limerick Championship medal at midfield when Na Piarsaigh defeated Adare by 0-14 to 0-12 on 6 October 2013. He was switched to full-forward for the subsequent Munster Championship, which culminated with him winning a second provincial medal after a 4-14 to 0-08 defeat of Sixmilebridge in the final. Dowling won a third Limerick Championship medal on 11 October 2015 after a 1-22 to 4-12 defeat of Patrickswell in the final. Later that season he won a third Munster medal after scoring 1-04 in a 2-18 to 2-11 defeat of Ballygunner. On 17 March 2016, Dowling won an All-Ireland medal when Na Piarsaigh defeated Ruair√≠ √ìg by 2-25 to 2-14 in the final. On 15 October 2017, Dowling won a fourth Limerick Championship medal when Na Piarsaigh defeated Kilmallock by 1-22 to 2-14 in the final. He was substituted in the 43rd minute after picking up an injury. Scans initially showed cartilage damage, but during surgery a fracture was also discovered inside his knee which ended his participation in the Munster Championship. Dowling's participation in the All- Ireland series was also in doubt, however, he was introduced as a substitute in the All-Ireland semi-final against Slaughtneil and set up a goal for Kevin Downes before scoring his own goal. On 17 March 2018, he was at midfield when Na Piarsaigh were defeated by Cuala in the All-Ireland final. On 27 October 2018, Dowling won a fifth Limerick Championship medal after scoring 0-12 in Na Piarsaigh's 2-22 to 3-10 defeat of Doon.

He made his first appearance for the team on 29 April 2009, replacing John Fitzgibbon at half- time in a 1-21 to 0-11 defeat by Tipperary. He was eligible for the minor grade for the following two seasons, however, Limerick faced respective defeats by Clare and Waterford. In his final year on the minor team, Dowling was drafted onto the Limerick under-21 team. On 3 August 2011, he scored seven points, including six frees, when Limerick defeated Cork by 4-20 to 1-27 in the final of the Munster Championship. Dowling was appointed captain of the Limerick under-21 hurling team during his fourth and final season on the team in 2014. Senior Dowling made his senior debut for Limerick on 25 February 2012 in a 2-24 to 1-13 National Hurling League defeat by Clare. Later that season he made his first Munster Championship appearance in a 2-20 to 1-19 defeat by Tipperary. On 30 June 2012, Dowling scored 3-09 in an All- Ireland Qualifier defeat of Antrim. It was the highest personal tally for any player in that year's championship. After playing a number of games for Limerick after returning from club duty during the 2013 National League, Dowling was surprisingly dropped from the starting fifteen by team manager John Allen for the team's opening championship game against Tipperary. Recalling being left on the bench, he later said: \\"I took that very hard at the time. Growing up I was never a sub on any team I had ever played for so, at the time, John Allen was the demon, the big bad wolf. I genuinely thought my inter-county career was over. I was devastated.\\" Dowling was introduced as a 49th-minute substitute for S√©amus Hickey and scored two points in a three- point victory. On 14 July 2013, he scored three points from play after being introduced as a substitute in Limerick's 0-24 to 0-15 defeat of Cork in the Munster final. Dowling returned to the Limerick starting fifteen under new joint-managers D√≥nal O'Grady and T. J. Ryan in 2014. After scoring 2-09 in Limerick's Munster Championship defeat of Tipperary on 1 June 2014, he later revealed how he had been the subject of an abusive text message: \\"Last week, the chairman of the club showed me a text message from a journalist in Limerick. I‚Äôve no problem with someone voicing their opinion. That particular person personally abused me in that text message. I don‚Äôt say that lightly. Thank God, that we answered that today.\\" On 24 October 2014, Dowling was named on the All-Star Team. On 10 June 2018, Dowling's tally of 0-15 in a Munster Championship game allowed him to replace Gary Kirby as Limerick's all-time top championship scorer. On 19 August 2018, Dowling scored a goal after coming on as a substitute when Limerick won their first All-Ireland title in 45 years after a 3-16 to 2-18 defeat of Galway in the final. On 31 March 2019, Dowling started Limerick's National League final meeting with Waterford on the bench. He was introduced as a 64th-minute substitute for Tom Morrissey and collected a winners' medal following the 1-24 to 0-19 victory. On 30 June 2019, Dowling won his first Munster Championship medal in six years after coming on as a 66th-minute substitute for Gear√≥id Hegarty in Limerick's 2-26 to 2-14 defeat of Tipperary in the final.

Originally from Badakhshan province, she is currently serving as a Member of Parliament in Kabul and is the Vice President of the National Assembly. ==Biography== Youth and education Born into a polygamous family of seven women, Koofi was first rejected by her parents because of her gender. Her father, a member of Parliament, had married a younger woman, and her mother sought to have a son to maintain her husband's affection. The day Koofi was born, she was left out to die in the sun. She managed to persuade her parents to send her to school, making her the only girl in the family to attend school. She subsequently graduated from university with a master's degree in business and management. Her father was a Member of Parliament (MP) for 25 years but died at the end of the first Afghan war (1979‚Äì1989), killed by Mujahideens. Koofi originally wanted to become a physician, but chose to study political science and become a member of UNICEF. She worked closely with vulnerable groups such as Internally Displaced People (IDP) and marginalized women and children, and served as a child protection officer for the organization from 2002 to 2004. Political career Then U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice with the speakers of the Afghan Parliament, Fawzia Koofi and Sayed Hamed Gailani in 2006. Koofi began her political career in 2001 after the fall of the Taliban, promoting the right to education of girls in her \\"Back to school\\" campaign. From 2002 to 2004 Fawzia Koofi worked with UNICEF as a Child Protection Officer to protect children from violence, exploitation and abuse. In the parliamentary elections in 2005, she was elected to the Wolesi Jirga, the lower house of the Afghan National Assembly, for the Badakhshan district in the northeastern part of the country and served as the Deputy Speaker of the lower house whose president also carries the title of Vice President of the National Assembly. She was the first female Second Deputy Speaker of Parliament in the history of Afghanistan. She was re- elected in the parliamentary elections of 2010 and then elected MP from a total of 69 female members of the Assembly. In Parliament, she has focused primarily on women's rights, but she also has legislated for the building of roads to connect remote villages to educational and health facilities.\\"In conversation with Fawzia Koofi member of Parliament from Badakshan\\" In 2009 Ms. Koofi drafted the Elimination of Violence Against Women (EVAW) legislation. Signed as a decree, the draft needed to be voted on in order to become an official document of the constitution. It was presented to Parliament in 2013 and was blocked by the conservative members who claimed articles of the law went against Islam. However, the law is being implemented in all 34 provinces in Afghanistan and court cases are being decided based on the law. She has survived several assassination attempts, including one on March 8, 2010, near the town of Tora Bora. Koofi intended to run for President of Afghanistan in the 2014 Afghan presidential election on a platform of equal rights for women, promoting universal education, and the opposition to political corruption, but she said in July 2014 that the election commission moved the registration date to October 2013 and as a result she did not qualify for the minimum age requirement of 40 years of age.Fawzia Koofi, the female politician who wants to lead Afghanistan She was re-elected as a member of Parliament in 2014 but no longer serves as the deputy speaker.

Women's rights engagement Koofi has made it a priority to defend women's rights in Afghanistan. Some of the key women's initiatives that she has championed during her tenure as an MP include: the improvement of women's living conditions in Afghan prisons; the establishment of a commission to combat the issue of violence (especially sexual violence) against children; and the amendment of the shia personal status law. Koofi also promoted education for women and children by advocating for access to good schools and creating opportunities for non-formal education for her constituents in Badakhshan province. While serving as Deputy Speaker in 2005, Ms. Koofi raised private funding for the construction of girls schools in remote provinces.‚Äú900 Afghani girls need a building for their school.‚Äù In 2009, she was selected as a Young Global Leader by the World Economic Forum.

The Favored Daughter: One Woman's Fight to Lead Afghanistan into the Future. New York, NY: Palgrave Macmillan, 2012. ] The book tells the story of Koofi's life throughout her childhood, education, and involvement in politics. It consists of narrations about her life interspersed with letters written to her two daughters. Synopsis The story spans from the time of Fawzia's birth to the near present and her growing political career. Koofi begins the book with a description of the family into which she was born. She was the nineteenth out of twenty-three of her father's children, and the last of her mother's children. The family practiced polygyny, Fawzia's father having married seven women. She introduces the theme of oppression towards women, one which appears throughout the work, by describing the day of her birth. Her mother was devastated to learn that she had given birth to a ‚Äúpoor girl‚Äù instead of a boy who could have won back the affection of her husband. She refuses to hold Fawzia after her birth, and the baby is left outside in the sun for a full day to develop second degree sunburns. During her introductions, Koofi also describes the political careers of her father and grandfather, who will grow to influence many of her political views. Still, she spends the majority of the beginning of the book describing the daily life of her childhood household. Fawzia's mother, though the second wife of her husband, was the ‚Äúhead wife‚Äù who was responsible for keeping the household running, especially when her husband was away on political business. Koofi then returns to the subject of politics and describes the political atmosphere of Afghanistan as a result of the USSR's presence in the country. Having fought off the Soviets, the mujahedeen were now gaining control of the country. As Fawzia's father travels to a political center of activity, he is killed by the mujahedeen, much to the dismay of Fawzia and her family. Soon after, the mujahedeen attempt to assassinate Fawzia's entire family, causing her and her mother to flee from the mujahedeen-controlled area to Faizabad and then Kabul. Unfortunately, not much time passes before the mujahedeen gain control of all of Afghanistan. In Kabul, Fawzia begins to attend school, despite the negative social attitude towards female education. For safety, she also has to begin wearing a burqa outside of her home, something she does with much resentment. At this point, Fawzia learns of her brother Muqim's death, and the work exhibits a shift in tone, becoming darker and more mature. As the tone darkens, so do Fawzia's surroundings as the mujahedeen abuse their power. Rapes, explosions, and gunfire become commonplace and the streets of Kabul become too dangerous to travel through safely. Even so, Fawzia refuses to stop attending school and English lessons, braving the city streets daily. At this point of the memoir, Fawzia's support system completely changes when her mother becomes fatally ill just as Fawzia meets her future husband, Hamid. Then, the political and social system changes as well due to the invasion of the Taliban. The extremist group begins destroying historical, cultural, and educational facets of Afghanistan. They demolish schools, destroy museums, and forbid celebrations like weddings. Women are forbidden from studying or working, and they are beaten if they wear any less than a burqa. Eventually, women are forbidden from even leaving their homes if not accompanied by a muharram, or a male blood relative. After describing the horrible acts of the Taliban, Koofi remarks: \\"All this was supposedly in the name of God. But I do not believe these were the actions of God. They were the actions of men. And I am sure God would have turned away to weep.\\" Fawzia decides to relocate to another province where one of her brothers has been living to avoid the Taliban. While away from Kabul, Hamid's relatives approach Fawzia's brother, Mirshakay, (because her parents are no longer alive) to ask for her hand in marriage. Despite the outrageous nature of her brother's requirements for the engagement to occur, Hamid and his family acquire the means necessary to fulfill the requests, and the engagement becomes official. Fawzia soon makes the dangerous journey to return to Kabul. The next section of the book focuses on Fawzia's difficulty in trying to plan a traditional Afghani wedding celebration while under the harsh Talibani rule. Even worse, the week after Fawzia's wedding, Talibanis invade Fawzia's new home and arrest her husband in a search for Mirshakay, a member of the regime's wanted persons list. Fawzia helps her brother to find a place to hide from the authorities and is overwhelmed with joy and relief when she returns home to find an unexpectedly released Hamid. Later, Mirshakay plans a journey to escape Afghanistan and seek refuge in Pakistan. Within moments, these plans are made impossible when Talibani officers burst into Fawzia's apartment and immediately arrest Mirshakay and Hamid. Fawzia manages to earn the favor of enough men in power to result in the release of the two men, and they immediately flee to Pakistan. While there, Hamid and Mirshakay make contact with the exiled president of Afghanistan, and Fawzia and Hamid become inspired with the prospect of his potential return to power and return to Kabul. Hamid is promptly arrested again by the Taliban. Three months pass before Fawzia succeeds in bailing Hamid out from jail, him having become very ill due to the inhumane conditions of the prison, and the two immediately travel back to Faizabad. At this point, Fawzia's gives birth to her first daughter, begins teaching, and finds herself pregnant for a second time. Koofi's career soon picks up, and she is asked to participate in an investigative project with the Foundation for Children. This quickly leads to positions with UNICEF and the UN, her career quickly growing as she struggles to balance her career and her duty as a caretaker for her two daughters. The Afghanis find relief when US military forces drive the Taliban out of power in reaction to the September 11 attacks, but Fawzia's joy turns to grief when Hamid's illness overwhelms him and he passes away. Still, when Afghanistan holds its first democratic elections, Fawzia obtains permission from her family to run for a position as a member of parliament. Incredibly, she not only wins the seat, but through her passion and determination also obtains the position of deputy speaker, an unheard of accomplishment for a woman. The work comes to a close with some of Koofi's suggestions for improving her beloved homeland. She looks toward the future and her plans to run for president of Afghanistan. \\"Koofi's 'favored' status continues as she marries the man of her and her mother's choosing, works as an English teacher, becomes the first Afghani woman to work for UNICEF in Afghanistan, and eventually wins the support of her family to run for a seat in Afghanistan's new parliament.\\" ==Notes and references *Support Committee for Fawzia Koofi Category:1975 births Category:Living people Category:Afghan feminists Category:Afghan women in politics Category:Members of the House of the People (Afghanistan) Category:People from Badakhshan Province Category:People from Kabul Category:Afghan Sunni Muslims Category:BBC 100 Women ","title":"Fawzia Koofi"},{"id":"35298698","text":"Tegeticula tehuacana is a moth of the family Prodoxidae.

It was written by series creator and executive producer Matthew Weiner and writer Erin Levy, and directed by series leading man Jon Hamm. It originally aired on the AMC channel in the United States on April 1, 2012. The episode takes place on and around Independence Day 1966 and re-introduces the Betty Francis character into the narrative. Betty finds herself in a state of depression and experiences a health scare following an unsettling weight gain. Meanwhile, Don and Harry collide with Baby Boomers while trying to meet with The Rolling Stones for a client. The rivalry between old guard Roger and an ascending Pete continues as Peggy hires a new copywriter with a questionable personality but high talent. Ratings for the episode fell from the season premiere, but were still stronger than the fourth season average. \\"Tea Leaves\\" received 2.9 million overall viewers and a 1.0 in the coveted 18-49 demographic. The episode received enthusiastic response from television critics. The main theme of the episode was seen by many television writers as the growing generation gap, and the increasing irrelevance of the main characters in culture and business as a result. ==Plot== Betty has gained weight over the past few months, causing her self-worth to drop and her sex life with Henry to flatline. This prompts an intervention of sorts from Henry's mother, Pauline, who suggests diet pills. When Betty goes to the doctor's office in an attempt to obtain diet pills, the doctor refuses. After a routine examination, he finds a possibly cancerous lump in Betty's throat. Betty returns home in a hysteric fever. She calls Don, who reassures her. Betty begins to confront the legacy of her life and the effect her death would have on her loved ones. Several days later, the doctor calls back to tell her the tumor is benign. Henry holds a despondent Betty in his arms. She ponders her life as simply a sad, fat housewife. The Heinz executive speaks with Don about his daughters' obsession with The Rolling Stones, and floats an idea about getting The Rolling Stones to do a commercial for Heinz. Don agrees, though he is unimpressed with the idea. Harry and Don make a Saturday night trip to a Rolling Stones concert to meet with Stones manager Allen Klein. They end up making conversation backstage with two pot-smoking female fans. When Harry leaves with one of the girls to talk with Klein, Don waxes poetic with one over her love for the band. She makes an insulting comment about the older generation. Don responds that the older generation is simply worried for youth. Harry fails miserably at his attempt to meet with The Rolling Stones, but Don is indifferent. Pete is in talks with Mohawk Airlines for their return to the agency. The arrangement calls for Roger to handle the day-to-day business. Roger puts Peggy in charge of hiring a new male copywriter for Mohawk. Stan advises her to hire a mediocre employee to make her competition lighter. Peggy, however, chooses to interview a talented young Jewish man named Michael Ginsberg whose work impresses her. When Peggy interviews Michael, he is over-the-top in his disposition. However, Roger forces her to bring Michael to Don. During his interview with Don, Michael is more upstanding and professional, which puzzles Peggy. Michael is hired. He returns home to find his domineering father reading the paper. Michael's personality changes yet again, this time more shy and reserved. When he learns of his son's success, Michael's father blesses his son with a Jewish prayer. Pete makes a puffed-up speech to the SCDP employees regarding his success in landing the Mohawk account. Roger walks out of the speech in anger, loathing his apparent descent in value to the agency. ==Production== \\"Tea Leaves\\" was written by Matthew Weiner and Erin Levy and directed by series star Jon Hamm. This is the first episode of the series that Jon Hamm had directed, with Hamm saying that he owes thanks to John Slattery for paving the way. As preparation for directing the Rolling Stones concert, Hamm looked over archival photographs of the original concert. \\"They were kids. The Rolling Stones. It was them and The Beatles. These huge pop explosions. People were really excited about it and it was a really big deal. And, in a larger sense, gave us a sense of where advertising is going.\\" Reflecting on his directing job, Hamm noted that he tried not to put much distracting style into the show, explaining that \\"My job was not to go in there and muck it up and say, \\"I'm gonna put my stamp on this.\\" My job was to go in there and keep the train on the tracks, basically. We have a very firmly established tone and look to our show that people respond to, and that I love.\\" Although the third episode of the season, it was actually the first episode produced for season, prior to the two-part season premiere, \\"A Little Kiss\\". Weiner said that the episode is \\"about the children. It's about who is going to take care of the children. Youth is a big part of our lives in general. Now and then. But when you think of the sixties and the youth culture and the way it sort of takes over. What you're looking at is Don's fear of the children being cut loose. At the same time, the children come back and eat you.\\" Weiner commented that the Michael Ginsberg character was \\"of the next wave\\" as a youthful employee who is \\"unfamiliar with social rules\\", with Weiner also declaring that \\"there is no reason that the concerns of older people are different than younger people\\". Of the storyline with Betty, Weiner said, \\"I don't think there's any mystery as to how that could happen. She is happy with Henry but on some level it's not enough.\\" Jon Hamm and Matthew Weiner both commented that the episode showcases the strong connection between Betty and Don that still exists despite the divorce. George W. Romney, Governor of Michigan in 1966, was mentioned by Henry Francis (Christopher Stanley) George Romney controversy \\"Tea Leaves\\" features a scene in which the Henry Francis character, a Republican political aide, insults George Romney, who was a political figure during the time the episode was set in. The Francis character characterized George Romney as a \\"clown\\" during the episode. Tagg Romney, eldest son of 2012 Presidential hopeful Mitt Romney, tweeted disgust for the mention, calling Mad Men the \\"lib media\\", and accused the series of mocking his grandfather. The Hollywood Reporter noted that the dig at Romney was based in historical fact, with the Francis character working for John Lindsay, who had actual disdain for Romney. The Reporter also noted that, \\"Mad Men's formula for success comes from its careful duality: it revels in pinpoint accurate details from its 1960s setting, while playing with themes that are timeless. Sometimes that means a fortuitous opportunity to use news and names that have reappeared in the cycle of American history.\\" January Jones' pregnancy January Jones became pregnant in between the fourth and fifth season of the series. Instead of writing in a pregnancy for the Betty Francis character, the writers opted to write in a weight gain. January Jones wore a fat suit during the filming of this episode, the same technique used by Elizabeth Moss during the first season when her character encountered a similar weight gain (though in that instance, the character was actually pregnant). Make-up tricks and clever camera angles were also used to create the dramatic impression of Betty's weight gain. A body double was used for the scene in which Betty rises from the bathtub. ==Reception== Ratings Hayley McFarland (pictured) played 'Bonnie'. Critics felt her scenes with Jon Hamm while backstage at a Rolling Stones concert were key to understanding the theme of the episode. Though Don estimates her character's age as fourteen, Hayley was roughly twenty around the time of filming. The ratings for \\"Tea Leaves\\" were down slightly from the premiere's record-making number. It pulled in 2.9 million viewers, which was still stronger than all of the fourth-season episodes except for the fourth-season premiere, \\"Public Relations\\". \\"Tea Leaves\\" also received a 1.0 rating in the 18-49 demographic. It built on its lead-in, the second-season premiere of The Killing. Critical reception Critics were complimentary towards the episode, praising the acting talent of January Jones and the ensemble cast as well as Jon Hamm's debut in the director's chair. Some, however, were not as impressed by the fat suit techniques used on January Jones to both hide her pregnancy and convey the character's weight gain. Emily VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B+. She felt that some of the scenes were too on-the-nose and that some of the symbolism was a little overt. VanDerWerff specifically cited the scenes where Don talks with the young girl at the concert as on-the-nose, comparing Don in this scene to Joe Friday. She did, however, praise the subplot involving Betty's weight gain as well as the final scene. Alan Sepinwall of HitFix said that all of the stories were linked by the threat of replacement and liked the interaction between Roger and Peggy, which he felt was a rare occurrence. He said that it was too soon to judge the Ginsberg character and that the Betty storyline was the weakest of the main plots. Writer Myles McNutt found January Jones \\"highly compelling\\" and the storyline offering a \\"decidedly human turn for the character, with her lunch with Joyce offering insight that we are robbed of without Betty having any friends to confide in normally.\\" Maureen Ryan of The Huffington Post praised Jon Hamm's direction and his \\"adherence to the Mad Men style\\" of \\"subtlety and economy\\". She said that it was not \\"one of the more profound episodes the show has ever done\\", but that it was full of \\"Mad Men-esque meditations on mortality and feeling left behind by changing times.\\" Bonnie Stiernberg, writing for Paste Magazine, said that based on this episode and the premiere, season five will be about how \\"characters must learn to adapt to their changing surroundings or find themselves becoming irrelevant, relics of a bygone era\\". She praised the creative solution to January Jones' pregnancy and the new African-American secretary, who she saw as an extension of Don, who was \\"also hired by the agency as a way to save face\\". Tim Goodman, writing for The Hollywood Reporter, focused on the \\"key part\\" Roger Sterling plays in the season, saying that \\"since change is the ongoing issue of Mad Men, what has Roger been but unchanged for too long now\\". He also called the introduction of the Ginsberg character a \\"breath of fresh air.\\" ==References *\\"Tea Leaves\\" at AMC * * Category:2012 American television episodes Category:Mad Men (season 5) episodes ","title":"Tea Leaves (Mad Men)"},{"id":"35298741","text":"Little Ireland Manchester Red Plaque Little Ireland was a slum district of the township of Manchester in Lancashire, England in the early 19th century, and also the nickname of Cleator Moor in Cumbria.

It was south of Oxford Road railway station and enclosed by the railway line and the loop in the river. Containing mainly poorly skilled Irish immigrants it became Manchester's oldest, smallest and most short lived Irish slum. In the 1820s the first immigrants moved there, however, by the mid-1840s they were moved on and the area was later demolished to make way for the Manchester South Junction Railway line, which remains there to this day.

It tells the story of two children growing up in Tasmania. One of them becomes involved in the Native American ritual of sun dancing and the other becomes a Tasmanian tiger hunter. Murray Waldren in The Australian said: \\"Spirituality permeates Heather Rose's first novel, White Heart, as much as the past haunts it. This story is a complex of interwoven, sometimes chimeric themes...A-class debut.\\"Murray Waldren, The Australian newspaper, 17 November 1999 Rose's second novel, The Butterfly Man, was published by UQP in 2005, It recounts the story of Lord Lucan the British Peer who disappeared from his family home in London after the murder of the family nanny in 1974.

The River Wife, Rose's third novel for adults, was published in 2009 by Allen & Unwin and described as \\"a beautiful, modern fable about the price we pay for love ‚Äì a magical and original novel\\". It is set in the central highlands of Tasmania and has received significant acclaim from reviewers and readers where it has been hailed for the beauty of its storytelling. An abridged version of The River Wife was broadcast on Radio National in 2010. Rose has said of her first three novels: \\"I am passionately Tasmanian and my family has lived here many generations. I think of this book (The River Wife) as the third in a trilogy of books that dives into the Tasmanian landscape. The first‚ÄîWhite Heart‚Äîis a sweeping view of the island told through the lens of childhood. The second‚ÄîThe Butterfly Man‚Äîdives closer into the seasons and landscape of Mt Wellington, the mountain that is the backdrop to Hobart. And The River Wife dives even more deeply into the central highlands, the very heart of Tasmania, and finds there a story, a myth, a fable that is uniquely Tasmanian. Perhaps it is no surprise that is it also a love story.

I. and produced by a team of IT professionals in Technopark under the banner \\"Mega Wave Productions\\". The film was released on 26 October 2012. ==Plot== \\"Padmavyooham\\" is a Malayalam term (derived from Sanskrit) that represents a special type of army constellation. It is a top secret army deployment method which contains one entry point and one exit point which is difficult to locate. The film is about the mythological story of Sree Padmanabhaswamy temple, the design of the idol, and the temple's riches. The story is presented in the backdrop of Travancore royal palace and brings out the ideas behind the construction of the temple and the significance of the placement of the idol of Vishnu. Padmavyooham opens with a police probe into a few temple robberies and the death of a journalist who investigates the complex defence mechanism of the Sree Padmanabhaswamy temple. Following this, Adhitya Varma, the patron of the temple sets out on an expedition to find out the details of temple construction. The story develops based on the myth that the temple idol can work as a water valve to let the sea water in and out of the temple in case of an emergency. As in a \\"Padmavyooham\\", Varma's expedition runs into a series of events that unfold the relation between the famed Travancore ruler's vision, security features implemented in the temple, and the significance of the temple treasure.http://www.padmavyooham.com/#!__synopsis ==Production== Padmavyooham is Bijoy's directorial debut. The scripting of the film was completed six years before it was shot. The story was developed based on inputs from available literature about temple history and also from knowledgeable people. It also contains fictitious elements. In 2008, Bijoy had made a short film The Myth based on the same theme, but with a negative climax. After receiving good feedback from the film fraternity, he planned Padmavyooham and redesigned the story to suit a feature film. The film was shot around Attingal palace, Thiruvananthapuram, and Alappuzha using a Red One camera. Due to security constraints at the Sree Padmanabhaswamy temple, the crew kept away from shooting inside the temple. For the climax scenes of the film, an 18 feet long and 10 feet high idol of Sree Padmanabhaswamy was constructed by art director Ajayan Kattungal.http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-06-19/thiruvananthapuram/32316514_1_sree- padmanabhaswamy-temple-treasure-golden-idol This is amongst the biggest one piece models used in Malayalam films. The film shows a one-minute animation sequence created by DC Animations, which shows how the idol acts as a water valve.http://www.thehindu.com/arts/cinema/article3404850.ece ==Release and reception== Padmavyooham was given a U-certificate by the Central Board of Film Certification. The preview of the film was run at Dhanya theatre in Thiruvananthapuram. On 26 October 2012, the film was released in five major cities in Kerala, including Thiruvananthapuram (Sree Visakh), Ernakulam (Chithranjali), Kozhikode (Sree), Thrissur (Sree), and Alappuzha (Chithranjali). ==Controversy== In July 2012, the certification and the release of the movie were stayed by the Kerala High Court, following a petition filed by the executive officer of the Sree Padmanabhaswamy temple. It was pointed out in the petition that the plot of the movie posed security concerns to the temple. It was also mentioned that the making of the film was against the Supreme Court order that the media should not issue baseless reports about the temple wealth. Later, a special screening was arranged for the court, temple authorities, and the titular king of Travancore to convince them that the story did not contain anything controversial. Subsequently, in October 2012, the stay was lifted by the High Court and the film was made ready for release. ==Cast== *Noby Tharian as Adhitya Varma *Sajeev Nair as Anwar Ibrahim *Anchal Babu as Viswettan *Amal Abraham as Rishi Ramavarma *Kiran Narayanan as Liaqat Ali *Fayis Salman as Harihar Iyengar *Anish Panickar as Sreedharan Potti *Riyas as Devan *Vipin as Sherif *Bhaskaran Nair as Thirumeni of Vishnu temple *Amritha Aiyer (uncredited) ==Soundtrack== Soundtrack of the film was composed by Sanjeev Krishnan for the lyrics by Suku Maruthathoor and Aji Daivappura.

The tremendous popular success of the Fant√¥mas novels led to the production of many films based on the series. A first series of 5 silent films was directed by Louis Feuillade from April 1913 to May 1914. An American version of the brilliant serial was produced in the early 1920s. Shortly after the advent of sound, Paul Fejos directed a feature-length Fant√¥mas film which combined elements from the novels and several of Feuillade's films, together with \\"modernized\\" plot twists. Two remakes/updates of the Fant√¥mas films were produced in France shortly after the end of World War II (Fant√¥mas, 1946, directed by Jean Sacha, and Fantomas Against Fantomas, 1949, directed by Robert Vernay). In the mid-1960s three films were made in rapid succession starring Jean Marais (of Cocteau's La Belle et la B√™te) in the double role of Fant√¥mas and Fandor. == The Plot == Fantomas, once thought dead, has just prevented the marriage of his daughter Helena with Fandor journalist killing the mayor who was to unite them. Then he posed an ultimatum to the Minister of the Interior: it requires a billion in gold, if not a million Parisians die. Inspector Juve decides to hide Helen and Fandor with Arthur, a former villain in whom he has confidence. Meanwhile, lady Bentham, anxious to prevent Fant√¥mas to commit new crimes phone to Juve the whereabouts of the criminal. Fandor overhearing the conversation follows Juve to the hideout and finds himself trapped by the villain. Juve is soon to find him while investigating at Lord Grimsay‚Äôs, where Fant√¥mas had settled. Both men, however, managed to escape while Helene in turn falls into the clutches of the criminal. Fant√¥mas destroys his secret laboratory before disappearing, then continues to assassinate passersby at random through his death ray. Following Burette, one of Fant√¥mas‚Äô accomplices, Juve and Fandor locate the new criminal lair in the catacombs. But after killing lady Beltham, Fant√¥mas fled once more, takingHelen hostage. Fandor managed to free the girl while the truck which Fant√¥mas hadboarded exploded on a mined bridge. Fandor and Helen finally get married but Juve, their witness, doubts the death of the Prince of Terror. ==Cast== * Marcel Herrand : Fant√¥mas * Simone Signoret : H√©l√®ne * Alexandre Rignault : le commissaire Juve * Andr√© Le Gall : Fandor * Yves Deniaud : Arthur * Fran√ßoise Christophe : la princesse Daniloff * Georges Gosset : Burette * Renaud Mary : Germain * Lucienne Le Marchand : Lady Beltham * Paul Faivre : le chauffeur * Pierre Labry : M.

He was the first post-World War II president of the Alpine Association of Slovenia. He was also a keen hunter and environmentalist. ==Life== Avƒçin was born in Ljubljana in 1910. He graduated electrical engineering in 1935 at the University of Ljubljana where he also worked for a while before the Second World War. In 1943 he joined the Partisans and returned to the University after the war. He died in Ljubljana in 1984 and was buried in the Trenta Valley in the Julian Alps. ==Work== Avƒçin was an inventor, mountaineer, mountain rescuer and politician. He was an official of the International Climbing and Mountaineering Federation, acclaimed for his knowledge and work on the mountaineering equipment. He wrote numerous papers, articles and books both on electrical engineering and mountain safety. In 1960, he successfully proposed in Paris that Tesla is used as the SI unit of the strength of a magnetic field. Avƒçin's inventions include the magnetic core with a changeable air gap, an improvement of the magnetic lens of the electron microscope, electronic long-distance speedometer, and a meter for measuring the path of ballistic missiles. He and his collaborator Anton Jegliƒç also invented an avalanche beacon transmitting at the frequency of 108 MHz, which emitted the sound of a woodpecker. In their honour, all avalanche beacons in Slovenia are named 'woodpeckers' (, plural: ). ==Recognitions== In 1964 he was awarded the Levstik Award for his book on his passion for the mountains Kjer ti≈°ina ≈°epeta (Where Silence Whispers). ==References * Category:1910 births Category:1984 deaths Category:Slovenian electrical engineers Category:Slovenian mountain climbers Category:Yugoslav Partisans members Category:Levstik Award laureates Category:Ethnic Slovene people Category:University of Ljubljana alumni Category:People from Ljubljana Category:Mountain rescue Category:Slovenian inventors Category:Hunters Category:Slovenian environmentalists ","title":"France Avƒçin"},{"id":"35298886","text":"The 2012 Mito HollyHock season sees Mito HollyHock compete in J.League Division 2 for the 13th consecutive season and 15th second-tier season overall.

Sixty locomotives were built between 1886 and 1892. At this time the class was designated class A by the NER and was the first class in the company to be given an alphabetical letter classification. ==Design== Boiler They were the first locomotives to use steel instead of iron for the boiler. At the time, the steel boiler was built to a non-standard design that could not be exchanged with any other class of locomotive. However, the design later evolved to become Diagram 69 under the LNER and was used on classes D23, G5, J24 and J73. Fittings Worsdell gave the Class A some design features that would become characteristic of most NER locos from then on. These included a tapered chimney, a brass cover for the safety valves and a large protective cab. Cylinders The first forty of the class had 18 inch diameter cylinders, while last twenty had 17 inch cylinders. The 17 inch cylinders were enlarged to 18 inches during rebuilding in 1900, Brakes All 60 of the class were originally built with Westinghouse air brakes. Forty- two were fitted with vacuum ejectors in a programme during 1929 and 1930. However, withdrawal of the class had begun in 1928 and 18 of the class never received vacuum ejectors. ==Use== During its working life the class could be found all over the NER system working on suburban lines and country branch lines. During their life with the LNER they were mostly kept around Tyneside, Teesside, Hull and Leeds where they handled lightweight traffic. Withdrawals of the class began in 1928 and finished in 1938. The last loco was No. 420, working at Tyne Dock. It was condemned on 22 April 1938 and the class slipped into history with none being preserved. == References == A Category:Scrapped locomotives Category:2-4-2T locomotives Category:Railway locomotives introduced in 1886 Category:Standard gauge steam locomotives of Great Britain ","title":"NER Class A"},{"id":"35298912","text":"Tegeticula mexicana is a moth of the family Prodoxidae.

It is not spoken in a large area (over Isernia, Termoli and Riccia), but within this area there are many linguistic variations due to diverging historical events. Before the Italian unification some eastern parts of Molise were part of the Province of Foggia (Capitanata), whilst some western areas, in particular Venafro, were part of the Terra di Lavoro (literally \\"Land of Work\\"), and Upper Molise was part of Abruzzo. For this very reason, the dialect spoken in Venafro may well be likened to the dialects of Campania and Naples. Some areas have also experienced an upsurge of minority languages such as Serbo-Croatian and Albanian, whereas other areas of Molise represent isolated communities with little outside contact, who consequently appear to be more conservative. The Frentana area (Termoli, Larino, Trivento) and Upper Molise has dialects that are more closely related to Southern Abruzzese. Similarly to Naples Neapolitan, Molisan contains words and sounds that are similar to those in Spanish but are not necessarily of Spanish origin. These include (\\"frypan\\", similar to Spanish ), sctreppi√†te (\\"broken\\", similar to Spanish estropeado), and petacce (\\"piece\\", similar to Spanish pedazo). The Roccamandolfi dialect of Isernia, a province in Molise, shares many phonetic characteristics with Spanish. With the exception of loan words from Italian and Neapolitan, it has no palatal gl sound (, similar to the second syllable of million in the Received Pronunciation accent of British English) and instead employs the intervocalic . Roccamandolfi also maintains diphthongisation in metaphony through ue, rather than Standard Italian uo, such as in fu√©che (Italian , \\"fire\\"), cu√©che (Italian cuoco, \\"cook\\") and u√©ve (Italian uovo, \\"egg\\"). Molisan also contains lexis derived from a substratum of Oscan, a language spoken by the Samnites. For example, pj√©skje (\\"rocks\\" or \\"stones\\") is related to Oscan . == Characteristics == As in the Neapolitan dialect, the Molisan dialect group also employs vowel reduction. In all unstressed positions, vowels (often with the exception of a) are presented by schwa , whilst vowels in a stressed position are fully pronounced. This is in line with Standard Italian phonology, in that the schwa never appears in a stressed position. Any vowel following a stressed syllable in a certain word is pronounced as a schwa. A final unstressed vowel, when followed by a pause, may be used for emphasis and is only mandatory when the word is immediately followed by a word with an initial consonant. Note that the schwa is a phoneme in itself, and distinguishes words of different meanings such as I s…ôpar…ô (\\"I separate myself\\") and I spar…ô (\\"I shoot\\"). The Molisan dialect group also displays the following phonological features: * short pronunciation of single voiceless z compared to the more elongated Italian pronunciation, e.g. Italian situazione (\\"situation\\"): ; Molisan: ; * all voiceless consonants following nasals become voiced, a phenomenon particularly common in many Central Italian dialects, e.g. Italian ancora (\\"still\\") is pronounced in Molisan as angora); * pronunciation of as (as in she) when it immediately precedes , in direct opposition with the Neapolitan phenomenon in which is pronounced as sh except when immediately preceding ; In the western area of the region (the Province of Isernia) spoken dialects share some common features: * rhotacism of masculine definite articles, e.g. Italian il cane (\\"the dog\\") becomes re cu√†ne in Roccamandolfi, and l'uccellino (\\"little bird\\") becomes ru cell√πcce; * rhotacism of , although this is applied inconsistently; * palatalization of Italian ll to gl, e.g. Italian cappello (\\"hat\\") becomes cappi√©gle; * displacement of the central stressed a when it appears between , or in past participles, e.g. Italian mangiato (\\"eaten\\") becomes magn√¶t. The eastern and Adriatic Sea areas of Molise (the Province of Campobasso) hosts yet more linguistic variation, with some features nonhomogeneously distributed across the region: * closure of stressed e when not appearing at the beginning of a word, e.g. Italian b√®ne (\\"well\\", \\"good\\") becomes b√©ne, in the regional capital; * closure of stressed o when in the middle of the word, e.g. Italian v√≤lta (\\"time\\") becomes v√≥te in the regional capital; * palatalisation of the central a when immediately preceding the word's stressed syllable, e.g. Italian Madonna becomes Medonne, and pallone (\\"ball\\") becomes pellone, in the area of Ripalimosani. ==References== Category:Dialects of Neapolitan Category:Phonetics ","title":"Molisan"},{"id":"35298949","text":"The 2012 Giravanz Kitakyushu season sees Giravanz Kitakyushu compete in J.League Division 2 for the fourth consecutive season.

Triple Eight Race Engineering‚Äîcompeting as Red Bull Racing Australia‚Äîwon the teams' championship for the fourth consecutive season. The 2013 International V8 Supercars Championship (often simplified to the 2013 V8 Supercars Championship) was a F√©d√©ration Internationale de l'Automobile-sanctioned international motor racing series for V8 Supercars that was based in Australia. It was the seventeenth running of the V8 Supercar Championship Series and the seventeenth series in which V8 Supercars contested the premier Australian touring car title. The championship was contested over thirty-six races, starting with the Clipsal 500 Adelaide on 2 March 2013, and finishing with the Sydney 500 on 8 December. The series' calendar also expanded, travelling to the United States for the first time for a race at the Circuit of the Americas in Austin, Texas. The 2013 season saw the introduction of the \\"New Generation V8 Supercar\\", a revision to the regulations which were designed to cut costs and to make the series more attractive to new manufacturers. Nissan and Mercedes-Benz entered the series, with four Nissan Altimas being prepared by Kelly Racing and three Mercedes-Benz E63 W212s being run by Erebus Motorsport ‚Äî who purchased Stone Brothers Racing during the off- season ‚Äì respectively. Holden teams competed with the new VF Commodore, which replaces the VE model, whilst Ford continued to use the FG Falcon, which had been raced since 2009, but built to New Generation V8 Supercar specifications for the 2013 season. Jamie Whincup started the season as the defending drivers' champion. The team for which he drives, Triple Eight Race Engineering, are the defending teams' champions. Whincup successfully defended his title, winning eleven of the season's thirty-six races and scoring a record-breaking thirteen pole positions. His team-mate Craig Lowndes finished second in the championship for the third consecutive season, giving Triple Eight Race Engineering its fourth consecutive Teams Championship win. Lowndes, with Warren Luff, won the inaugural Enduro Cup for the best performing drivers across the three endurance races.

The fourth car is run as a satellite of the team, in the same way as the #55 Rod Nash Racing car is run. ** In January 2013, British motorsport group Prodrive announced that it had sold its stake in Ford Performance Racing to Rod Nash and former Australian GT Champion Rusty French. * Lucas Dumbrell Motorsport expanded to a two-car operation after purchasing the #49 Racing Entitlement Contract from Paul Morris Motorsport. The team also acquired two VF Commodores constructed by Triple Eight Race Engineering. * As a result of the deals between Schwerkolt and Ford Performance Racing and Paul Morris and Lucas Dumbrell Motorsport, Dick Johnson Racing lost the use of the #18 and #49 Racing Entitlement Contracts and was reduced to a two-car operation with its existing #17 REC and by leasing Triple F Racing's #12 REC. * Kelly Racing switched from competing with Holden Commodores to Nissan Altimas, running a re-sleeved version of Nissan's quad-cam aluminium 5.6-litre VK56DE V8 reconfigured to a 5.0-litre capacity. The team was renamed to Nissan Motorsport, a name last used by Gibson Motorsport in 1991. * In January 2013, Larry Perkins confirmed that he had sold his two Racing Entitlement Contracts to Kelly Racing. Perkins had previously leased the #11 and #16 RECs to the Kelly operation, and by purchasing them, Kelly Racing acquired full control over the licences. To satisfy sponsor requirements, the 2 former Perkins RECs used numbers 36 and 360. * Stone Brothers Racing was purchased by Australian GT Championship team Erebus Motorsport, and the organisation, along with satellite team James Rosenberg Racing, ended their association with Ford. Instead, the combined team entered three cars based on the Mercedes-Benz E63 W212, powered by a M159 engine. The combined Erebus‚ÄîJames Rosenberg outfit did not receive any factory support from Mercedes-Benz. Driver changes * Tim Blanchard joined V8 Supercars full-time, driving for Dick Johnson Racing. Blanchard, who was runner-up in the 2010 Fujitsu V8 Supercar Series, had previously contested the endurance races in 2011 and 2012 before replacing the injured Todd Kelly for the final four events of the 2012 season. * Michael Caruso left Garry Rogers Motorsport after five seasons, moving to Kelly Racing. * Alex Davison returned to V8 Supercars after a one-year absence spent competing in the Australian Carrera Cup Championship.

The series used the shorter \\"national\\" circuit, instead of the full layout. * The Hamilton 400 was held for the final time in 2012. It was replaced by an event at Pukekohe Park Raceway, which last hosted a championship event in 2007. The Pukekohe Park circuit was reconfigured to accommodate the category after it was awarded \\"International\\" status by the FIA in 2011. This act required the circuit to meet the criteria for an FIA Grade-2 certification, necessitating the changes. * After returning to the calendar in 2012, the Sydney Motorsport Park did not host an event in 2013. * The Yas Marina Circuit was initially scheduled to host the Yas V8 400 in support of the 2013 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, but with the Grand Prix support bill expanding to include rounds of the GP2 and GP3 Series championships, the event was removed from the V8 Supercars calendar. Format changes * The events at Symmons Plains, Barbagallo, Hidden Valley, Queensland Raceway, Winton and Phillip Island all featured a new three-race format, dubbed the \\"60/60 Sprint\\" format. The Saturday race was 120-kilometres in length but split into two 60-kilometre halves with a fifteen-minute break in between to allow teams the opportunity to service their cars. The starting grid for the second half of the race was determined by the finishing order of the first half of the race. The remaining two races were then held on Sunday at 100-kilometres in length each. Originally, a driver who finished one lap down in the first half would remain one lap down at the start of the second half of the race. This was changed following the Symmons Plains event, with drivers who were a lap down at the end of the first half gaining the lap back for the second half. * Teams were no longer required to compete with a co-driver from an international racing series for the Gold Coast 600. Instead, teams were free to partner each of their drivers with any co-driver they choose, and allowed to enter the same co-drivers for the Sandown 500, Bathurst 1000 and Gold Coast 600. The drivers with the most points from the three endurance races received the \\"Enduro Cup\\", a new trophy introduced for 2013. ==Rule changes== New Generation V8 Supercar The New Generation V8 Supercar (originally Car of the Future) project was first announced in 2008, when a working group was established to explore options for the long-term future of the category. The study found that in the fifteen years since the category had been restricted to a two manufacturers, the costs of building and racing with a competitive car had doubled, with some estimates putting the cost as high as A$600,000 per car, per season. The Car of the Future program was created to address this, aiming to reduce running costs to $250,000. This was achieved through the use of \\"control\\" parts; where teams had previously been charged with designing and developing their own parts, the Car of the Future regulations called for these parts to be built independently and to a set specification. The basic chassis and roll cage, differential, brakes, cooling and fuel systems and rear suspension were all changed to control parts. The category also introduced a larger fuel tank to combat the phenomenon of \\"economy racing\\" whereby drivers would be forced to drive conservatively late in the race so as to preserve enough fuel to reach the finish. The larger tanks and a restructuring of event formats to include more compulsory pit stops instead allowed drivers to push as hard as they pleased until the end of the race. Manufacturers were free to develop their own aerodynamic aids to suit their cars, which were then put through a rigorous system of parity testing so as to refine the aerodynamics of each model of car so as to prevent one model from having a distinct advantage over the others. Finally, manufacturers were also given the option of using \\"generic\\" engines developed by the category and re-badged to reflect the manufacturer using them‚Äîthough as the season started, no manufacturers had elected to do so‚Äîor developing their own engines, which would be built to specifications and then be subject to a process of homologation to ensure that all engines developed by the manufacturer would be identical. In order to ensure the cars can remain competitive, the process of homologation only applies to the basic engine platform, which teams will be free to develop over the course of the season. With the requirement that all teams build brand-new cars for the 2013 season, most of the cars that were raced in 2011 and 2012 were sold to teams competing in the V8 Development Series, the second-tier category for V8 Supercars. In November 2013 the Car of the Future was officially renamed the New Generation V8 Supercar. ==Event summaries== Clipsal 500 Adelaide { class=\\" collapsible collapsed\\" align=\\"center\\" width=75% style=\\"font-size: 85%; max-width: 950px\\" - ! colspan=\\"3\\"  Results - !

Craig Lowndes won the first of the two races after pole-sitter Shane van Gisbergen made a poor start and ultimately retired from the race. Will Davison finished second, with reigning drivers' champion Jamie Whincup completing the podium. Van Gisbergen claimed pole in the second race and went on to win by two seconds ahead of Whincup. Lowndes recovered from a poor qualifying session to finish third, giving him a twelve-point championship lead over Whincup, and a thirty-one point lead over Davison in third place. Rick Kelly achieved a best finish of eleventh place for Nissan in the first race, whilst the Mercedes-Benz E63 AMGs prepared by Erebus Motorsport struggled throughout the weekend, with Tim Slade recording a best result of fifteenth place.

Fabian Coulthard secured his maiden V8 Supercars race win in the first race, while Jason Bright took his first race win since the 2011 Winton 300 when he won the second race. Coulthard took a second win in the third and final race. Craig Lowndes lost the championship lead after an altercation with Shane van Gisbergen in the first race that saw Lowndes spin and puncture a tyre, leaving him to finish the race in twenty-sixth position, and Whincup gained the championship lead by finishing on the podium in the first race. David Reynolds and Scott Pye were involved in separate accidents over the course of the meeting, the latter of which ruled Pye out of the next event in New Zealand.

Scott McLaughlin became the youngest person to win a V8 Supercar race when he took his maiden victory in the first race as pole-sitter Jamie Whincup struggled with tyre problems at the start. Whincup survived a chaotic second race‚Äîin which Fabian Coulthard jumped the start; Shane van Gisbergen, Jason Bright and James Courtney all left the circuit at high speed; and Mark Winterbottom collided with Whincup whilst trying to pass for the lead on the last lap‚Äîto take his first win of the season. A rare mistake from Whincup saw him run wide in the third race, which was won by Will Davison, also in his‚Äîand Ford's‚Äîfirst win of the season. Jason Bright won the fourth race, and with it the Jason Richards Memorial Trophy, as he scored the most points over the four races. Whincup's tyre problems in the first race and off- track excursion in the third meant that he lost the lead of the championship to Will Davison, whose lead was further established when Whincup was penalised fifteen points for an unsportsmanlike pass in the third race.

This was Lowndes' ninety-first career race win, breaking Mark Skaife's record of ninety wins. Jamie Whincup went on to win the following two races, and also took pole position for the first and third races; Jason Bright qualified on pole for the second. Whincup's wins, coupled with a second place in the first race, allowed him to take the championship lead back from Will Davison, who suffered a puncture in the first race. James Moffat provided Nissan Motorsport with three top ten results, continuing the team's strong form from New Zealand. Engine upgrades for Erebus Motorsport saw the Mercedes-Benz E63 AMGs find pace, with Maro Engel giving the team its first top ten qualifying result. Chaz Mostert, replacing Jonny Reid at Dick Johnson Racing, made a strong championship debut, finishing in the top fifteen in all three races. The Saturday race saw a major incident involving Scott Pye, who was launched into the air sideways and landed heavily in the infield after he made contact with Rick Kelly and Garth Tander coming onto the back straight during the first race. Pye was uninjured and the car undamaged and the team was able to continue racing throughout the weekend.

Fabian Coulthard denied Whincup a clean sweep of the event when he won the third race. Whincup later caused controversy when he claimed that \\"external factors\\" had inspired an unorthodox penalty that he, Coulthard and Craig Lowndes were given for breaching safety car regulations in the third race, implying that the penalty had been applied to allow a different driver to win the race. Elsewhere, Rick Kelly demonstrated the Nissan Altima L33's development by securing four top-ten finishes, whilst James Moffat claimed an extra top-ten finish for the marque in the second race. Erebus Motorsport, on the other hand, continued their difficult introduction to V8 Supercars, spending most of the weekend outside the top twenty.

Jamie Whincup went on to win the race ahead of Shane van Gisbergen, who had spent most of practice struggling with mechanical problems, and James Courtney. Courtney claimed his first pole position since the Winton event in the 2010 season for the second race, whilst Reynolds bounced back from his difficulties in the sprint race to take pole again. Winterbottom recovered from the Saturday incident to win the second race from Courtney and Craig Lowndes, while Lowndes would win the third race ahead of Winterbottom and Reynolds. Whincup was given a drive-through penalty in the third race for spinning his wheels while the car was in the air, allowing Lowndes to close the points gap in the championship. James Rosenberg Racing's Tim Slade demonstrated a reversal of fortunes for the Mercedes AMG E63 teams, finishing in the top ten in the first race and qualifying inside the top ten for the second and third races. However, his luck ran out on the first lap in the third race when he was involved in a multi-car accident which caused a red flag and eliminated himself, Lee Holdsworth, Alex Davison, Dean Fiore, David Wall, Alexandre Pr√©mat and James Moffat. Scott McLaughlin, Jason Bright, Fabian Coulthard and Russell Ingall were also involved in the crash but were able to take part in the restarted race. German driver Maro Engel scored a career-best ninth place in the third race, capitalising on the first lap crash.

Series veteran Russell Ingall made his 226th championship event start, breaking John Bowe's record of 225, and used the number 226 in celebration of the achievement. Shane van Gisbergen continued his strong street circuit form from Adelaide, taking pole position for the Saturday race. However, a penalty from a pit lane infringement dropped him down the order. The Ford Performance Racing duo of Will Davison and Mark Winterbottom were able to capitalise on this and take a one-two finish ahead of Brad Jones Racing's Fabian Coulthard. Winterbottom took pole for the second race on Sunday but lost out on strategy, after many drivers pitted during an early safety car to do a double stint on soft tyres. The Holden Racing Team utilised this strategy to finish first and second, their first win since the 2011 Bathurst 1000, with Garth Tander leading James Courtney. Van Gisbergen rounded out the podium while Winterbottom finished fourth. Championship leaders Triple Eight Race Engineering endured a difficult weekend, with both Jamie Whincup and Craig Lowndes qualifying outside of the top ten for the first race. Lowndes was able to recover to fourth using an alternative strategy while Whincup finished seventh. The team was not able to recover over night, with Lowndes and Whincup finishing seventh and eleventh respectively on Sunday. Lowndes was able to take 48 points out of Whincup's championship lead, bringing it down from 159 to 111 points. Erebus Motorsport again finished in the top ten, with Tim Slade finishing eighth on Sunday. The Sunday race also saw Tony D'Alberto equal his career-best result with a sixth place while Ingall returned to the top ten with a fifth.

The race featured several incidents, firstly with Whincup's teammate Craig Lowndes touching the rear of Winterbottom's car on the first lap and causing both Winterbottom and Fabian Coulthard to lose positions. Todd Kelly had separate altercations with David Wall and Chaz Mostert, with Wall and Mostert coming off worse in each incident. Lee Holdsworth was forced out of the race after contact with Dean Fiore and Michael Caruso. Whincup again took pole for the second race but was beaten by McLaughlin for the race win, with James Courtney finishing third. The final race featured tyre problems which affected many drivers: Whincup, McLaughlin, Courtney, Garth Tander, Alex Davison and David Wall all had punctures which dropped them down the order. In just his fifteenth race, Chaz Mostert of Dick Johnson Racing won the race from second on the grid, ahead of pole-sitter Will Davison and Winterbottom.

His teammate Michael Caruso, who led the first half of the race, finished in second with Jason Bright completing the podium for Brad Jones Racing. Controversy surrounded Moffat's victory, however, as the two Nissans used an E70 fuel blend (compared to the usual E85) in an effort to evaluate its potential in balancing fuel economy between the engines used by Nissan and Erebus Motorsport and those used by Ford and Holden. Championship leader and pole-sitter Jamie Whincup encountered a gearbox problem while leading, forcing his retirement. Whincup's troubles continued in the second race, involved in a first lap crash after qualifying poorly. The crash also affected Caruso, Alex Davison, Russell Ingall, Alexandre Pr√©mat and Garth Tander. Mark Winterbottom won the race for Ford Performance Racing, ahead of pole-sitter Bright and James Courtney. Courtney started on pole for the final race and went on to win ahead of Fabian Coulthard and Chaz Mostert. The race saw differing strategies with many drivers pitting for fresh tyres during a late safety car period and then making their way through the field.

The win came despite a drive- through penalty for spinning the rear wheels while the car was jacked up during a pit stop. The pair finished ahead of their teammates Craig Lowndes and Warren Luff and the pole-sitting Ford Performance Racing car of Will Davison and Steve Owen. Erebus Motorsport achieved its best result of the season, with Lee Holdsworth and Craig Baird taking their E63 AMG to fourth place.

It was Winterbottom's and the team's first victory in the race, while Richards won his third and Ford won their first since 2008. The winners of the Sandown 500, Jamie Whincup and Paul Dumbrell, finished second after Winterbottom and Whincup fought for the lead in the final stint, with their Triple Eight Race Engineering teammates Craig Lowndes and Warren Luff in third. Scott Pye achieved his best result of the season, finishing sixth with Paul Morris, while the wildcard entry of Andy Priaulx and Mattias Ekstr√∂m performed strongly to finish in tenth. The race was the quickest in history at six hours, eleven minutes and twenty-seven seconds with only two safety car periods. The first was to allow the clean-up of debris after David Russell struck a kangaroo at Griffins Bend while a heavy crash for Greg Murphy at Reid Park brought about the second safety car period. Despite finishing second, Whincup extended his championship over Lowndes by eighteen points, while Winterbottom overtook teammate Will Davison for third in the standings.

The race included on a controversial incident between Craig Lowndes and Mark Winterbottom, who came together while battling for the lead on the last lap of the first half of the race, resulting in the pair dropping to fifteenth and fifth places respectively. Other incidents during the first half allowed Jamie Whincup, who had qualified poorly, to move up to sixth place. Whincup would go on to finish fourth in the race to retake the championship lead while Winterbottom finished fifth and Lowndes recovered to eighth. The race was marred by a major accident involving Alexandre Pr√©mat and James Courtney. Pr√©mat had a tyre failure going into turn three before sliding across the damp grass and hitting the driver's door of Courtney's car, causing significant damage to both cars while Courtney also suffered slight tissue damage on his right leg. Triple Eight Race Engineering dominated Sunday's races, with Lowndes winning the first race ahead of teammate Whincup and Shane van Gisbergen. Whincup went on to win the final race ahead of Winterbottom and Lowndes. This left Whincup with a 20-point lead over Lowndes in the championship heading into the final round, with Winterbottom 124 points off the lead.

There are two Madina mosques in the fort campus, the old one built by Nawab Siraj ud-Daulah during the 18th century.and the new one by Nawab Mansur Ali Khan in 1847. The old mosque was a part of the old Nizamat Imambara, built by Nawab Siraj ud-Daulah, which was partially burnt in a fire in 1842 but was completely burnt when it caught fire on 23 December 1846. The old Madina mosque survived the 1846 fire and was left in its place. When Nawab Mansur Ali Khan built the present Nizamat Imambara in 1847, he built another Madina Mosque inside the new building. So Madina or Madina Mosque refer to both the mosques. Both of them lie parallel to the Hazarduari Palace's south face on the banks of the Bhagirathi River. The old one lie a little south to the new one and on the west of the clock tower and just beside the place where the Bacchawali Tope rests. ==History and features== The old Madina mosque at Nizamat Fort campus, Murshidabad. The old mosque constructed by Nawab Siraj ud-Daulah, and soil from Mecca was brought which was mixed with its foundation, so that it could provide an opportunity to the poorer members of the local Muslim community to have an experience of Hajj, one of the five pillars of Islam. Constructed primarily of wood, the old Imambara was damaged by fire in 1842 before being completely destroyed by a second fire in 1846. However the old Madina mosque survived the fire. The old mosque is smaller compared to the one built by Nawab Nasur Alikhan and is single domed. The present Imambara was constructed in 1847 under the supervision of Sadeq Ali Khan. Within this Imambara lies the new Madina mosque. The new mosque is built on a raised platform decorated with ornamental china tiles, and the foundation contains soil from Karbala. It is said that in the past, fountains stood between the Memberdalan and the Madina Mosque, encircling the shrine.

First aired on April 1, 2012, it was written by the show creators and executive producers David Benioff and D. B. Weiss, and directed by returning director Alan Taylor. With a war on the horizon, the Seven Kingdoms are witnessing an ever-growing clash of kings. The boy king Joffrey Baratheon (Jack Gleeson) sits on the Iron Throne guided by cruelty and deceit, while his honorable counterpart Robb Stark (Richard Madden) of the North heads south to avenge his father's death. Meanwhile, the late king Robert Baratheon's estranged brother Stannis (Stephen Dillane) emerges as yet another claimant to the throne. A frantic search for King Robert's bastard sons ensues, while the Queen sets to find the missing Arya Stark (Maisie Williams) in order to retrieve her lover and brother Jaime, now a captive to the Starks. The title refers to Robb Stark vowing revenge against the Lannisters for his father's murder. \\"The North Remembers\\" received universal acclaim from critics, who noted Tyrion Lannister's development as a key player as a highlight of the episode. In the United States, the episode achieved a viewership of 3.86 million in its initial broadcast. The episode introduced a number of new cast members, including Stephen Dillane's Stannis Baratheon, Carice van Houten's Melisandre and Liam Cunningham as \\"the onion knight\\" Davos Seaworth. It also featured a number of new locations, both fictional and real, most notably the city of Dubrovnik, Croatia, which served as the capital city of King's Landing. It received a great amount of critical praise, with critics welcoming the new set of characters, which they saw as a great addition. The episode went on to win an American Society of Cinematographers for Outstanding Achievement in Cinematography in One-Hour Episodic Television Series. ==Plot== On Dragonstone From the island of Dragonstone, the late King Robert's brother Stannis Baratheon declares himself rightful heir to the Iron Throne. He sends a message across the Seven Kingdoms that Robert's supposed heirs are the products of incest between Cersei Lannister and her brother Jaime. Despite Ser Davos Seaworth's advice, Stannis refuses to ally with King in the North Robb Stark or rival claimant Renly Baratheon. Fearing the influence that the Red Priestess Melisandre holds over Stannis, Maester Cressen attempts to kill Melisandre in a murder-suicide with poisoned wine, but Melisandre drinks the entire cup unaffected. In the Riverlands Robb informs the captive Jaime of Stannis' letter, surmising that Robb's brother Bran was crippled and his father Ned killed by the orders of joffrey. Robb sends Jaime's cousin Alton Lannister to King's Landing with terms for peace, including the return of Robb's sisters Sansa and Arya and Ned's remains, and acknowledgement of Northern independence; Theon Greyjoy to ask his father, Lord Balon Greyjoy, for the naval force of the Iron Islands; and his mother Catelyn to negotiate an alliance with Renly's court. Catelyn tells Robb his father would be proud, but warns him not to trust Balon. At Winterfell After a prophetic dream, Bran visits the Godswood with Osha. Noticing a red comet, Bran declares it an omen of victory in the war, but Osha insists it means dragons have returned. At Craster's Keep The Night's Watch ranging party reaches Craster's Keep beyond the Wall. Craster claims that the wildlings' leader Mance Rayder is amassing an army to move south. Lord Commander Jeor Mormont offers leadership advice to Jon Snow. In the Red Waste With the remnants of Khal Drogo's khalasar, Daenerys Targaryen makes a difficult journey across the Red Waste, and sends three riders to find shelter. In King's Landing During combats to celebrate King Joffrey Baratheon, the captive Sansa saves the drunkard Ser Dontos Hollard by convincing Joffrey to make him a fool. Tyrion Lannister, sent as Hand of the King in his father's stead, mocks his sister Cersei for letting Arya escape, having planned to trade the Stark girls for Jaime. Cersei dismisses Stannis' letter to Joffrey as gossip. The City Watch murders King Robert's bastards, discovering too late that one, Gendry, has already left the city traveling to the Wall. Unbeknownst to the Lannisters, Arya is also with that caravan. ==Production== Writing The episode was written by producers David Benioff and D. B. Weiss, based on the original work of George R. R. Martin. As the second season covers mostly A Clash of Kings, the second book of the series, the first episode adapts the material from the first chapters of the book including the Prologue, Sansa I, Tyrion I, Bran I, Catelyn I, Davos I, the first half of Daenerys I and Jon III (chapters 1, 3‚Äì5, 7, 10, 12, and 23). Two chapters from the beginning of the book had already been included in season 1's finale, while Jon Snow's story is being pushed forward. Casting This episode introduces several prominent characters, most notably Stannis Baratheon (Stephen Dillane), Ser Davos Seaworth (Liam Cunningham), and Melisandre (Carice van Houten). The three of them represent the head of an entirely new storyline that intertwines with other plotlines as the season progresses. Other recurring characters introduced in this episode are drunken knight Ser Dontos Hollard (Tony Way), the Starks' captive Alton Lannister (Karl Davies), Melisandre's opponent Maester Cressen (Oliver Ford Davies), Davos's son Matthos Seaworth (Kerr Logan), Night's Watch member Dolorous Edd (Ben Crompton), Wildling Craster (Robert Pugh), and his daughter and wife Gilly (Hannah Murray). The episode also marks the upgrade of several returning characters to the main cast. John Bradley-West returns as Jon Snow's friend Sam Tarly, James Cosmo as the Lord Commander of the Night's Watch Jeor Mormont, Jerome Flynn as Tyrion's cunning servant Bronn, with Sibel Kekilli as Tyrion's concubine Shae, and lastly Conleth Hill as the gossiping eunuch Varys. Peter Dinklage takes the place of Sean Bean as the first credit during the intro sequence. Since Bean's character was killed at the end of last season, Dinklage jokingly wished that he could stay being the lead credit for some time. Filming locations Downhill Strand was used to represent a beach of the island of Dragonstone, where the statues of the Seven were burned The production continued using the Paint Hall studios as the filming headquarters and the Northern Irish landscapes for many of the exterior shots. The burning of the Seven was filmed at the beach of Downhill Strand, where local press echoed the stir that the filming caused to the small community of Castlerock. Craster's keep beyond the Wall was built in a forest in Clandeboye Estate. David Benioff and D. B. Weiss stated in their audio commentary track that while most scenes set north of the Wall were filmed in Iceland, the Craster's Keep scenes were filmed in Northern Ireland, as the lack of significant tree growth in Iceland prevented them filming forest scenes there. The closing sequence, of a caravan heading north along the Kingsroad, bringing Arya to Winterfell and Robert Baratheon's illegitimate son Gendry and the other passengers onward to Castle Black, was shot at the \\"Dark Hedges\\", an avenue of gnarly beech trees near Armoy, County Antrim. Joffrey's name day tourney was filmed at Fort Lovrijenac For the exteriors of the capital city of King's Landing, that had been doubled for Malta for the entire season 1, now the production flew to the Croatian city of Dubrovnik. Known as The Pearl of the Adriatic, the city proved to be a good representation of King's Landing since it shared many characteristics with the fictional capital: it had a well-preserved medieval look, with high walls and the sea at its side. According to David Benioff, executive producer of the show, \\"The minute we started walking around the city walls we knew that was it. You read the descriptions in the book and you come to Dubrovnik and that's what the actual city is. It has the sparkling sea, sun and beautiful architecture.\\" The first scene of the episode, depicting the celebration of King Joffrey's name day, was filmed on Dubrovnik's Fort Lovrijenac (also called St. Lawrence Fortress). The later debate about the nature of power between Cersei and Littlefinger also takes place in its porch, and in the final montage with the killing of the bastards the Old City of Dubrovnik and its famed walls can be clearly seen. The scenery in Daenerys's desert scenes was filled in with CGI; however, the production filmed desert scenes in Morocco in Season Three. ==Reception== Ratings The viewership of the episode on its premiere airing in the US rose to a new series' top of 3.858 million viewers, with a rating of 2.0 in the relevant 18-49 demographic on HBO. Taking into account the additional airings of the night the number of viewers totaled 6.3 million. In the United Kingdom, the episode was seen by 0.928 million viewers on Sky Atlantic, being the channel's highest-rated broadcast that week. Critical reception The episode received universal critical acclaim. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes surveyed 28 reviews of the episode and judged 100% of them to be positive, with an average score of 8.6 out of 10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"'The North Remembers' underscores Joffrey's capacity for cruelty and Tyrion's development as a key player in a compelling sophomore season opener.\\" Matt Fowler of IGN rated the episode 9 out of 10. The A.V. Club gave it B+. Alan Sepinwall, who reviewed the episode for HitFix, called it \\"a great beginning. Funny in spots, scary in others, never blinking away from the cruelty of this world and this war.\\" Andy Greenwald of Grantland praised the episode for its new additions of Dillane and Van Houten, its setup of later episodes, and its themes. \\"It's also evident that the second year of Thrones, if not the remainder of the series, is about a race to fill what may well be an impossible vacuum. [...] Everything feels thrillingly unsettled, as if the rules are constantly changing and the biggest prize may actually be a booby trap.\\" Luke Broadwater, writing for The Baltimore Sun, enjoyed Tyrion's increased role, referring to him as the new lead of the series after the death of Eddard Stark (Sean Bean). He thought that the episode \\"excelled in underscoring Joffrey's cruelty...and Tyrion's humor and growth as a character.\\" However, his commentary was not all positive; the reviewer criticized the scene in which Littlefinger threatens Cersei and thought that Maester Cressen should have been kept alive longer. In her recap of the episode, Jenifer D Braun of The Star-Ledger wrote that the episode contained the sex and violence that the show had had in its first season and stated, \\"Man, I missed this show, didn't you?\\" Sarah Hughes of The Guardian was very complimentary towards the episode as a season premiere, remarking that \\"The season opener deftly covers a huge amount of scene-setting while introducing a host of new characters.\\" In addition, she praised the episode's adaptation of the source novels for including a large number of important scenes and storylines with minimal filler: \\"this was a leanly written episode, which tackled a huge amount of exposition and scene-setting but never wasted a word.\\" Nina Shen Rastogi, writing for Vulture, thought that the episode served as both a redefinition of the plot and a reintroduction of the first seasons's themes of violence and succession. She wrote, \\"from the very first scene of last night's season premiere, GoT strove to reassure us that some things would never change.\\" Simon Abrams of Slant Magazine lauded \\"The North Remembers\\" as a \\"thematically focused\\" episode on the subject of good leadership. He enjoyed how each of the rulers were developed in the premiere and hoped that the rest of the season \\"can keep up with its premiere's big ideas.\\" Accolades This episode won an American Society of Cinematographers for Outstanding Achievement in Cinematography in One-Hour Episodic Television Series. ==References External links == * \\"The North Remembers\\" at HBO.com * * Category:Game of Thrones (season 2) episodes Category:2012 American television episodes Category:Infanticide Category:Television episodes written by David Benioff and D.B.

It is often referred to as ChaqF tinyaJ KichenA tziC, Chatino de San Marcos Zacatepec, or Chatino de Zacatepec as it is distinct from other Chatino languages in the region. Zacatepec Chatino is part of the Eastern Chatino languages. It is spoken in the town of San Marcos Zacatepec, a town of approximately 1,000 people and inhabited by an indigenous group known as the Chatino people. The language was once spoken in the village of Juquila, but is now virtually extinct with two surviving speakers in the area (Villard 2015). Zacatepec Chatino is a highly endangered language as it is spoken by about 300 Chatinos whom are all above 50 years of age. ==Classification== Chatino refers to three closely related modern languages; the three being Eastern Chatino, Tataltepec Chatino, and Zenzontepec Chatino of the Zapotecan branch. Zacatepec Chatino falls under the Eastern Chatino branch. Zacatepec Chatino, being part of Chatino language family, has shallow orthography. It is more conservative than many other varieties of Eastern Chatino as it conserves many non-final unstressed vowels which have been lost in other varieties. ==History== Little is known about the history of Zacatepec Chatino but according to St√©phanie Villard who studied and presented her thesis on the language, it has been on a decline for the past 40 years as natives continue to expand their ties with non-Chatino communities. With the help of the Zacatepec Chatino Documentation Project, Villard has uncovered some of the remnants of the language with the help of many natives from the area. The project includes visits in 2005 and 2006 by Hilaria Cruz, Emiliana Cruz, Megan Crowhurst as well as preliminary analysis of tones in H. Cruz y Woodbury in 2006. It also includes intensive work since 2006 by St√©phanie Villard, including 150 hours of audio, a sketch, papers on sandhi and inflection and grammar as well as short visits concentrating on textual documentation, tone, & morphology Although Spanish is the official language in San Marcos Zacatepec, Oaxaca, many government officials communicate in Zacatepec Chatino. A study conducted by Villard revealed that majority of the younger population are monolingual Spanish speakers. ==Geographic distribution== Zacatepec Chatino is only spoken in San Marcos Zacatepec, Oaxaca in the Sierra Madre region of Mexico. Dialects/Varieties Since Zacatepec Chatino is unintelligible with other Chatino varieties, it does not have any other dialects or varieties associated with it. ==Phonology==  Vowels  Villard (2015) reports that Zacatepec Chatino presents voicing of non-continuant after nasals, vowel harmony, and contrastive nasal vowels. It also lacks labial phonemes and has 4 levels of pitch ranging from low to high. It also presents 15 specific tonal sequences that can define 15 Lexical classes. Its phonology presents a rich tonal system with a large inventory of phonemic tonal sequences as well as intricate sandhi patterns.

Some functions are the language are mixed; for example, person marking can be signaled through tone contrast and/or nasalization, encliticization, or also by a separate word. Its verbal morphology features a large inventory of allomorphs of its aspectual morphemes, which makes its verbal paradigms appear extremely irregular. The sequence classes are ‚Äúmorphological‚Äù‚Äîsome are specialized by part-of-speech, by inflectional category, or loan provenance, while others are open ended and general. Syntax The basic word order is VSO but there are other orders present. Here is an example of the Chatino Language VSO: Some morphemes, such as the marker \\" îin\\" have various functions in the grammar as it is a dative marker. The dative marker introduces human direct objects, indirect objects, and also marks alienable possession. Compounding patterns play an important role and word formation. the use of combinations of 'light nouns‚Äô or semantically poor nouns and semantically rich adjectives (or nouns, although very rarely) is very prolific in the language. Villard provides us with an example of such formations: the light noun nu ‚Äòthe one who‚Äô, often occurs as a head noun in noun phrases, as in nu kƒ´ îy√≥ 'man' (the one who is male) or nu kunƒÅ î√°n 'woman' (the one who is female). ==Vocabulary== There are 15 lexical tone classes defined by 15 tone sequences. The sequences pertain to any noncompound stem but have different realizations depending on the number of moras in the stem. The sequence classes are ‚Äúmorphological‚Äù‚Äîsome are specialized by part-of-speech, by inflectional category, or loan provenance, while others are open ended and general. Sequence class identity‚Äînot tones‚Äîdetermines tonal ablaut behavior and tonal inflectional classes. The progressive aspect is associated with an M tone which generates composed sequences beyond the original 15 ==Bibliography== * Villard S. Grammatical sketch of Zacatepec Chatino.

In native vocabulary, the only permissible coda is the glottal stop. Phonological evidence, including evidence from a play language, suggests that the glottal stop of word-medial  îC clusters belongs to the onset of the following syllable rather than the coda of the preceding syllable, and therefore true codas are only found word-finally. == Tone == Zenzontepec Chatino's tone bearing unit is the mora, and each mora may be assigned a mid tone /M/, a high tone /H/, or be unspecified for tone /√ò/. On words with two or more moras (polysyllabic words or monosyllabic words with long vowels) different combinations of tones can be found (/√ò√ò/, /√òM/, /MH/, /H√ò/, and /HM/), some of which are morphologically specialized (/√òH/ and /MM/ which only appear on words inflected for second person singular), while others do not occur (/M√ò/ and /HH/).  Tone processes  The high tone /H/ (but not the mid tone /M/) will spread through following toneless moras until coming into contact another /H/ or /M/ tone or the end of an intonational phrase. The /M/ or /H/ tones that the spreading /H/ tone runs in to will be downstepped phonetically, but will remain /M/ or /H/ phonologically. /M/ tones on monomoraic enclitics will become /H/ tones if its host's tone is /M/ or /√òM/. == Play language == Speakers of Zenzontepec Chatino formerly used a play language called nchakwi…Å ts≈´…Å ntƒ´l√∫ 'speaking backwards' in which a word's first syllable was transposed to the end of the word, and its tones were replaced with /H√ò/. ==References External links == *Chatino Indian Language at native-languages.org *OLAC resources in and about the Zenzontepec Chatino language Category:Chatino languages ","title":"Zenzontepec Chatino"},{"id":"35299199","text":"Kmscon is a virtual console that runs in userspace and intends to replace the Linux console, a terminal built into the Linux kernel. Kmscon uses the KMS driver for its output, it is multiseat-capable, and supports internationalized keyboard input and UTF-8 terminal output. The input support is implemented using X keyboard extension (XKB). Development of Kmscon stopped in March 2015. There is a new project called systemd-consoled, but this project was also later dropped in July 2015. == Features == Kmscon supports printing the full set of Unicode glyphs and is not limited by console encoding as the Linux console. While the only hard dependency is udev, kmscon can optionally be compiled to use Mesa for hardware acceleration of the console, and the pango library for improved font rendering. The adoption of XKB for input allows kmscon to accept the full range of available keyboard layouts for the X.Org Server and Wayland compositors for input and makes it possible to use the same layout both in graphical environment and in terminal.  Multiseat support  The VT system in the Linux kernel dates to 1993 and does not implement out-of-the-box multiseat support. It supports up to 63 VTs, but only one VT can be active at any given time. This necessitates additional steps to configure multiseat support. kmscon/systemd-consoled will enable multiseat out-of-the-box. If one seat's display server is running on VT 7 and another seat's display server is running on VT 8, then only one of these two seats can be used at a time. To use the other seat, a VT switch must be initiated. To make all seats usable at the same time, there are a few options: * Associate all display servers with the same VT: any user can switch VTs and in that case all users switch to the new VT. This makes VT switching (and thus fast user switching) impractical. X.Org Server command-line option \`-sharevts\` * Don't associate any display server with a VT: fast user switching is impossible in this case. Text-based console logins are only possible if an input and display device are reserved for this purpose. * Associate only one of the display servers with a VT: the other display servers can't do VT switching, but the display server associated with a VT can. VT switching on that one seat won't affect the other seats. This is the approach favored and assumed by systemd. command-line option \`vt7\` for user 1 and \`-novtswitch\` for all other users. == Development == In 2011, Jesse Barnes wrote in his blog about the possible userspace DRM-based implementation of the virtual terminal, that would dissolve the need for the Linux framebuffer and virtual terminal (VT) subsystems in the Linux kernel. Motivated by this blog post, David Herrmann implemented the basic functionality of virtual terminal. In October 2013, terminal emulator state machine () library, a state machine for DEC VT100‚ÄìVT520 compatible terminal emulators, was split out of kmscon and made available separately. It was amended with wlterm, an example Wayland terminal emulator. == See also == * Comparison of terminal emulators * List of terminal emulators == References == Category:Free system software Category:Freedesktop.org Category:Linux kernel-related software Category:Software using the ISC license Category:Technical communication tools Category:Terminal emulators Category:Wayland (display server protocol) ","title":"Kmscon"},{"id":"35299205","text":"Pyxidanthera is a genus of flowering plant in the family Diapensiaceae.

Hugh I appears as Count of Rethel shortly after.) was a son of Manasses II and his wife Dada (possibly Judith or Yvette de Roucy). He succeeded his father as Count of Rethel in 1032. Rethel is a town on the River Aisne, in the Ardennes region, in the Northeast of France, located at 49.5085¬∞N, 4.3663¬∞E. Little is known about his life, although he is mentioned often between 1048 and 1081. == Marriage and descendants == Manasses III married Judith (born c. 1035), whose origins are unclear. Several hypotheses have been proposed to clarify this: * Judith of Roucy : Genealogici√¶ Scriptoris FusniacensisGenealogici√¶ Scriptoris Fusniacensis names \\"Lebaldus de Malla et‚Ä¶Iveta comitissa de Retest\\" as brother and sister of \\"Ebalus de Roceio\\", this note also refers to a certain Mathilde, wife of Li√©utad: \\"Albericus de Cociaco‚Ä¶cum Adela uxore sua et matre eius Mathilde\\" who made a donation to the Abbey of Nogent-sous-Coucy (French Wikipedia) in 1059. cites an Iveta (Yvette), wife of Manasses de Rethel, as the sister of Ebles I of Roucy and Li√©taud de Marle. The Chronicles of Alberic of Trois-Fontaine‚ÄòChronica Albrici Monachi Trium Fontium‚Äô, ed. Paulus Scheffer-Boichorst, in Monumenta Germaniae Historica: Scriptorum, vol. 23 (Hanover, 1874), pp. 631-950. (written in 1119) describes her as \\"mother of Hugh I, Count of Rethel\\". This is the traditional genealogy given for her grandson, Baldwin II of Jerusalem. Notwithstanding, considering her family history, such assertion is chronologically impossible. Jean-N√∂el Mathieu raises the fundamental objection that Eble I (who died in 1033), could not have had a sister who was still alive in 1081, instead he argues that she must have been confused with the wife of Manasses II. The historian Alan V. Murray remarks that Mathieu's suggestion 'would fit the chronology of the Roucy family better since it would place the connection with the Rethel family one generation earlier than that given by the genealogies of Foigny'; * Judith of Boulogne: daughter of Eustace I, Count of Boulogne and Mathilda of Leuven: this proposition would explain the kinship between the kings Baldwin I and Baldwin II of Jerusalem. However, Murray objects that there is no allusion of this daughter nor of any other connection between the Rethel and Boulogne families in Genealogica comitum Boloniensium', a compilation of the Boulogne genealogy which was being copied and extended by the mid-twelfth century, when the descendants of Manasses III were ruling the kingdom of Jerusalem. Another hypothesis is that Doda, the wife of Godfrey III, Duke of Lower Lorraine, would have been the daughter of Manasses II and Dada (Yvette) de Roucy; * Judith of Lorraine: Li Estoire de Jerusalem et d'Antioche,de Chartres, Foucher (1895) [1122]. Li Estoire de Jerusalem et d'Antioche. Volume 5 de Recuil des Croisades, Historiens occidentaux. written in the 12th century, indicates that Manasses III was married to a daughter of Godfrey III. This would also explain the connection between the two Baldwins of Jerusalem, as well as the fact that Godfrey made a donation'Cartulaire de Saint-Vanne de Verdun' of 1065: Godfrey II, Duke of Lower Lorraine and his wife Beatrice confirm a donation made to Count Manasses and his son Renauld. The problem here is that nothing indicates this Manasses is the Count of Rethel or another Count Manasses who lived in the same period. to Manasses in 1065. Murray says that the primary sources suggest that kinship between Baldwin I and Baldwin II \\"was not particularly close\\", and that Baldwin II was most probably related to his predecessor's mother, Ida of Lorraine.

In 2010, Abbrederis earned his first letter while playing in all 13 games and starting two games. He finished the season tied for second on the team in touchdown receptions (3), fourth in receiving yards (289), and fifth in receptions (20). He had a personal best 79 receiving yards, including a career-long 74-yard touchdown catch, on two receptions and returned one kickoff for 52 yards against Indiana on November 13, 2010. After the season, Abbrederis was named to Rivals.com's Freshman All-Big Ten Team. 2011 season Abbrederis earned his second letter, starting all 14 games at wide receiver. He finished the season ranked third in the country with an average of 15.8 yards per punt return, second-best in a single season in Wisconsin history (minimum 15 returns). He led the team with 933 receiving yards, the fifth-most in school history and most by a sophomore. His eight receiving touchdowns were second on the team and tied for the fifth-most in one season at Wisconsin. His 55 receptions ranked second on the team and seventh-most in school history. He finished second in the Big Ten and 13th nationally with 1,999 all-purpose yards. He recorded a 60-yard punt return touchdown against Indiana on October 15, 2011. On October 22, 2011, in a 37-31 loss to Michigan State, Abbrederis played as the third safety on the final play of the game to defend a Hail Mary pass by Michigan State's Kirk Cousins. However, with the game tied and no time left, Abbrederis mistimed his jump on the pass defense, and the ball deflected off another player before landing into the hands of Michigan State's Keith Nichol for a touchdown. The game officials initially ruled Nichol's catch short of the end zone but ruled Nichol's catch a touchdown after reviewing a replay. His 348 all-purpose yards in the Rose Bowl vs. Oregon was a Rose Bowl record until Stanford's Christian McCaffrey broke his record in the 2016 Rose Bowl.stationary bike on the sideline during a game against Ohio State in 2012 Following the 2011 season, Abbrederis was named an honorable mention All-American punt returner by SI.com.

He became the first Badgers player drafted by the Packers since offensive lineman Bill Ferrario was selected in the fourth round in 2001. After being drafted by the Packers, Abbrederis stated, \\"Just being a walk-on at Wisconsin and then being able to have my dream to play in the NFL on the Packers, which is my team growing up. That's who I rooted for, so I'm excited.\\" He was also the first Badgers player drafted by Packers general manager, Ted Thompson. Regarding the pick, Packers head coach Mike McCarthy said, \\"It's nice to come up here and say, 'about time we finally drafted one,\\" and \\"There's been a number (of Badgers players) over the years we felt we were going to draft. It's great.\\". Four days after being selected by the Packers in the draft, Abbrederis signed a four-year contract worth $2.364 million deal, including $144,560 signing bonus. In August, Abbrederis tore the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in his right leg, requiring surgery; this injury sidelined him for the entire 2014 season. During the Packers' first practice of 2015 training camp, Abbrederis suffered a concussion. He returned to practice before the last preseason game against the New Orleans Saints. Against the Saints, Abbrederis caught one pass for six yards on 62 offensive snaps. On September 5, 2015, he was released by the Packers during final team cuts. Abbrederis was signed to the Packers' practice squad two days later. On October 3, 2015, he was promoted from the practice squad to the active roster. He recorded his first NFL reception, a 15-yard catch on third- and-one against the Detroit Lions in Week 10. He finished the game with four receptions for 57 yards before suffering a rib injury on a 32-yard catch in the fourth quarter. Coach Mike McCarthy announced that Abbrederis would miss \\"several weeks\\" with the injury. He was out the next two weeks until making his return against the Lions in Week 13. He recorded one reception for 16 yards. Abbrederis caught his first pass of the 2016 season in Week 1, an eight-yard reception against the Jacksonville Jaguars. On October 24, 2016, he was placed on injured reserve. Abbrederis was waived by the Packers after reaching an injury settlement on October 27, 2016. Detroit Lions On January 9, 2017, Abbrederis signed a reserve/future contract with the Detroit Lions. Abbrederis played in 7 games for the Lions in 2017, recording 3 receptions before being waived on November 14, 2017. On January 5, 2018, Abbrederis announced his retirement from the NFL.

The latter name derives from the two Londoners, William (Billy) Smith and Charles (Charley) Eaton, who were responsible for their large-scale manufacture between 1857 and 1870. At the time, some antiquarians were fooled by the forgeries, despite them being crudely made by two individuals with limited skill in metalworking and little knowledge of medieval art. Today, Billy and Charleys are viewed as examples of folk art. A number of museums hold collections of them and they are sought-after collectible items in their own right. They have been sold for prices equaling or exceeding the values of examples of the medieval originals they purported to be. Because of this, modern fake Billy and Charleys are reportedly in circulation. ==William Smith and Charles Eaton== Little is known of the lives of William Smith (dates unknown) and Charles Eaton (c.1834‚Äì1870) except that when young they were mudlarks ‚Äì individuals that made a small living by searching the mudflats of the River Thames at low-tide, seeking any item of value. They lived in Rosemary Lane (now called Royal Mint Street) in what is now part of the London Borough of Tower Hamlets. In 1844 or 1845, Smith came into contact with an antique dealer, William Edwards; Eaton met Edwards some years later. Edwards came to view the pair as \\"his boys\\" and frequently bought from them items of interest they found while mudlarking. In 1857, the two began to manufacture counterfeit artefacts to sell to Edwards. ==Forgeries== seal, Auckland War Memorial Museum A lead Billy and Charley medallion, in diameter, thick and weighing . One side shows the profile head of a man wearing a crown; the other shows the head of a helmeted knight. The medallion is dated \\"1030\\". United Kingdom Portable Antiquities Scheme During their career, Smith and Eaton are estimated to have made between 5,000 and 10,000 items of many kinds, including pilgrim badges, ampulla, statuettes, portable shrines, coins, medallions and ornamental spearheads. Initially they were all made from lead or pewter, but later the two also used a copper-lead alloy. The items were cast using plaster of Paris moulds, into which a design was engraved by hand. They were then given the appearance of age by being bathed in acid and coated with river mud. The most common type of Billy and Charley were medallions, around in diameter. These had crude depictions of knights in armour, crowned kings or religious figures. They often carried inscriptions, but as Smith and Eaton were illiterate, these were meaningless. To give the appearance of age, many of the items also carried dates between the 11th century and the 16th century. However the dates were inscribed using Arabic numerals which only came into use in England during the 15th century and so are anachronistic on the \\"older\\" items. Smith and Eaton sold their forgeries to Edwards, selling around 1100 items between 1857 and 1858 for a total of ¬£200. The two claimed the source of the steady stream of antiquities was the large-scale excavations then taking place as part of the construction of Shadwell Dock. In June 1857, Edwards showed samples to another antique dealer, George Eastwood. Eastwood bought the 1100 items from Edwards, before bypassing him and buying further supplies directly from Smith and Eaton. Eastwood advertised them as a \\"A remarkable curious and unique collection of leaden signs or badges of the time of Richard II\\",. He sold them to several customers, including one person buying them on behalf of the British Museum. ==Libel trial== A Billy and Charley in the form of a lead statuette, high; probably intended to represent a bishop. Manchester Museum, accession number 1981.1150. By 1858, Henry Syer Cuming, the secretary of the British Archaeological Association, together with the archaeologist Thomas Bateman, had noticed the appearance of large numbers of medieval artefacts for sale which they suspected to be forgeries from a single source. On 28 April, Cuming delivered a lecture, Some Recent Forgeries in Lead, to the British Archaeological Association in which he condemned them as \\"Gross attempts at deception\\". The lecture was reported in The Gentleman's Magazine and The Athenaeum. George Eastwood responded firstly with a letter defending the authenticity of the items he was selling, and then by suing the publishers of The Athenaeum for libel. He had not been named in the magazine's report but he was the only seller of the items so his complaint was that the Athaenum had libelled him implicitly and damaged his business. The trial was held at Guildford Assizes on 4 August 1858. The judge was Sir James Shaw Willes, Eastwood was represented by Edwin James QC. The Athenaeum was represented by Montague Chambers QC. William Smith (described in a newspaper report as a \\"rough looking young man\\") was one of the witnesses. In his testimony, Smith claimed he had obtained them from the Shadwell Dock construction site, by bribing the navvies building the dock with money and drink, and by sneaking onto the site himself after hours. He testified he had sold around 2000 items, making around ¬£400. Examples of the artefacts were presented to the courts as exhibits; according to The Times newspaper report, \\"a good deal of amusement was produced by the extraordinary nature of some of those that were produced\\". Charles Roach Smith, a leading antiquarian and co-founder of the British Archaeological Association, testified to the authenticity of the Billy and Charleys. Before the trial, Roach-Smith had stated their very crudity was an argument for their authenticity ‚Äì he assumed any 19th century forger intent on deception would simply have done a better job in making them. Under examination during the trial, he stated his belief that they were a previously unknown class of object with an unknown purpose. However, he was confident of their age. The Rev. Thomas Hugo, vicar of St Botolph-without-Bishopsgate, a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries and a published author on the subject, gave testimony that supported Roach-Smith, stating that the items dated from the 15th or 16th centuries. Although under cross-examination, he was unable to state exactly why he thought so. The artist and antiquary Frederick William Fairholt also testified that he believed them authentic, as did two other antique dealers. The Athenaeum had not named George Eastwood in its report so the trial judge directed the jury to find the magazine publishers not-guilty of libel, but it was asked to affirm its faith in Eastwood's integrity. ==Subsequent history== The libel trial attracted widespread publicity. Even though Eastwood failed to convict The Athenaeum of libel, the result gave the appearance of endorsing the authenticity of his stock, and his sales increased. Roach-Smith reported on the trial in The Gentleman's Magazine, stating his theory the items were of 16th century origin. In 1861, he published volume five of his work, Collectanea antiqua. This included an article stating the items were crude, religious tokens, dating from the reign of Mary I of England, that had been imported from continental Europe as replacements for the devotional items destroyed during the English Reformation. Ironically, earlier volumes of the Collectanea antiqua had been among the scholarly reference works used by Smith and Eaton when creating their fakes. Meanwhile, the businessman, politician and antiquarian Charles Reed had renewed the investigation of the artefacts; although he may have been prompted by Roach-Smith's book. He made inquiries in the Shadwell Dock construction site, but could not find anyone that had sold items to Smith or Eaton. He gained the confidence of a tosher (one who scavenges in sewers), who confirmed that Smith and Eaton had been selling forgeries. He was introduced to Smith and Eaton, and gained their trust, but paid the tosher to break into their workshop and steal several of their moulds; these were exhibited at a meeting of the Society of Antiquaries of London in March 1861 as proof the items were fakes. ==Later career of Smith and Eaton== Despite their exposure, Smith and Eaton continued to make and sell forgeries throughout the 1860s. They began using a lead-copper alloy known as cock metal and their work showed somewhat improved craftsmanship. But increasing awareness of their activities made it harder for them to sell their forgeries. In 1867 they were arrested in Windsor, Berkshire after a local clergyman recognised the items they were selling. In court, there was found to be insufficient evidence to prosecute and they were released. Charley Eaton died in January 1870 of consumption. William Smith's last appearance in the historical record was in 1871, when he was attempting to sell a copy of a 13th century lead jug. Nothing further is known of him. ==Collections== Examples of Billy and Charleys are in the collections of the British Museum, the Victoria and Albert Museum and the Museum of London. Many are held by the Cuming Museum, which includes the personal collection of Henry Syer Cuming. ==References== Category:Archaeological forgeries Category:Archaeology of London ","title":"Shadwell forgeries"},{"id":"35299306","text":"James Pascoe (November 29, 1863 ‚Äì September 7, 1931) was a British-born farmer and political figure in Saskatchewan.

Mutations in the Artemis complex results in hypersensitivity to DNA double-strand break-inducing agents, such as radiation; and so people with mutations in the Artemis complex may develop radiosensitive severe combined immune deficiency (RS-SCID) ==Mechanism== The Artemis protein has single-strand-specific 5' to 3' exonuclease activity, but it can also complex with the 469 kDa DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PKcs) to gain endonuclease activity on hairpins and the 5' and 3' overhangs; the DNA-PKcs phosphorylates Artemis to give it this new function. During V(D)J recombination, the RAG complex (made up of RAG-1 and RAG-2 complexed with HMG1 or HMG2) binds to two recombination signal sequences (RSSs); the complex associates with each other, bringing the strands together, creating a loop which contains all the DNA between the two RSSs. Some of this DNA is then deleted, and the RAG complex then induce a nick precisely at the 5' end of the heptamer. This creates a 3' OH group which acts as a nucleophile in a transesterification attack on the antiparallel strand, yielding a DNA hairpin (two hairpins, as the RAG complex dimer binds to two strands). In lymphoid cells, recombination can only occur between a 12-RSS and a 23-RSS; this is known as the 12/23 rule. The four ends of DNA (two hairpinned coding ends and the two signal ends) are held together in a postcleavage complex by the RAG complex. The Artemis:DNA-PKcs complex, along with Ku and DNA ligase IV/XRCC4 dimer, can then close up the signal ends into a 'signal joint'. It also opens the hairpins of the coding ends, and this process is thought to be mediated by the RAG complex (the RAG complex can open free hairpins by itself, but this is only observed in manganese-containing buffers, and not in magnesium-containing buffers). Nucleotides are added at the open ends by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT). This occurs until there are complementary sequences at which point the opposite strands will pair up. Exonucleases then remove the unpaired nucleotides, and ligases fill in the gaps. This creates a junction between each joined segment, containing an unspecified number of nucleotide additions, flanked by a 2-residue palindromic sequence. ==Other Uses== The Artemis:DNA-PKcs is also used for processing 5' and 3' ends in non-homologous DNA end joining. ==References== Category:Immunology ","title":"Artemis complex"},{"id":"35299373","text":"Sixe Idillia (1922): frontispiece. One of fewer than 25 copies hand-coloured .by Gribble Vivien Massie Gribble Doyle-Jones (1888 ‚Äì 6 February 1932) was an English wood engraver who was active at the beginning of the 20th century. She was a pupil of Noel Rooke at the Central School of Arts and Crafts and exhibited regularly with the Society of Wood Engravers.Joanna Selborne, \\"The Society of Wood Engravers: the early years\\" in Craft History 1 (1988), published by Combined Arts. ==Life== Henlow Grange, Henlow, Bedfordshire Mrs George Gribble (Norah Royds) by John Singer Sargent, 1887 Gribble was born in Chelsea, London, the third of six children of a wealthy family. The family grew up at Henlow Grange, Henlow, Bedfordshire and at Kingston Russell, near Long Bredy in Dorset, with a large retinue of servants, according to her brother's biography. Her father was George Gribble,'Parishes: Henlow', in A History of the County of Bedford: Volume 2, ed. William Page (London, 1908), pp. 280-285. British History Online accessed 29 January 2018. who in 1897 was High Sheriff of Bedfordshire. Her mother was Norah Royds, a Slade-trained artist, whose murals still decorate Henlow Grange, notably the Peacock Room. Her mother's cousin was Mabel Allington Royds, an artist known for her woodcuts. Her eldest sister was Phyllis Fordham of Ashwell Bury. Other siblings included Lesley, mother of Frederic Seebohm, Baron Seebohm, and Major Phillip Gribble, a writer and adventurer who married the daughter of Ronald McNeill, 1st Baron Cushendun and financed Anna Wolkoff. The youngest of her siblings, Julian Royds Gribble, won the Victoria Cross at the end of World War I and died of influenza in a German prison of war camp; she designed a memorial window for him at Preston, Hertfordshire.Judith Butler, 'Vivien Gribble: 1888-1932' in Private Library (Autumn 1982), published by the Private Libraries Association. Vivien studied first in Munich and then, following in her mother's footsteps, at the Slade School of Art. She studied at the Central School of Arts and Crafts under Noel Rooke, and clearly made an early impression on her teachers. During the First World War she joined the Land Army. In 1919, she married Douglas Doyle-Jones, a barrister from a similarly wealthy background, and they set up house at Higham in Suffolk. Doyle Jones soon gave up working as a barrister to look after his estate and dabble in painting. After several miscarriages the couple adopted a child. Gribble, who had a restless temperament, tended to lose interest in projects when her initial wish was gratified. She died of cancer on 6 February 1932. ==Higham== In 1926, the couple bought Valley Farm in Higham, where Doyle-Jones became known as the \\"Old Man of the Trees\\". He was responsible for establishing much of the woodland around the cottage and in 1935 planted the Jubilee Wood in celebration of George V‚Äôs Silver Jubilee. The woodland was largely destroyed in the Great Storm of 1987. Sweet Chestnuts have now been replanted, however, and are now thriving alongside the established Walnut Grove. Doyle-Jones also planted the Copper Beech on Higham Green, close to the farm, to celebrate the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1952. The couple also owned The Pound, which in 1929 became the home of Cedric Morris and Arthur Lett-Haines. On Gribbles' death in 1932, the two became the owners. ==Her wood engravings== Odes (1923): frontispiece The Central School was clearly the place to be in those very early years of the wood engraving revival; in 1912, the year that Rooke began teaching wood engraving there, Gribble was commissioned to produce five wood engravings for an edition of Three Psalms designed by J.H. Mason.L. T. Owens, J.H. Mason (1875-1951): Scholar-Printer (London, Frederick Muller, 1976), . He was impressed enough to ask her in 1916 to produce 12 wood engravings for an edition of Cupid and Psyche by Apuleius; this edition did not appear until 1935. In 1919 Gribble was asked to contribute three wood engravings to Change 2, a small format magazine that reflected the zeitgeist of the period; in the same year Malcolm Salaman included her wood engravings in his Studio anthology.Malcolm C. Salaman, Modern Woodcuts and Lithographs (London, Studio, 1919). She exhibited in the second exhibition of the Society of Wood Engravers in 1921, and continued to do so until 1925. In 1922 she contributed two wood engravings to Contemporary English Woodcuts, an anthology of wood engravings produced by Thomas Balston, a director at Duckworth and an enthusiast for the new style of wood engravings. She also produced the cover vignette for the book. Campbell Dodgson, Keeper of Prints and Drawings at the British Museum, wrote about her in his introduction to the book: Miss Gribble and Miss Pilkington are among the other women artists who practise wood engraving with zeal and success; the former is now turning her attention to book illustration, in which English engravers of the modern school have hitherto achieved smaller results that their contemporaries in France.Campbell Dodgson, Contemporary English Woodcuts (London, Duckworth, 1922). This was a limited edition of 550 copies; Gribble worked with Balston to produce three more books at Duckworth in a similarly luxurious format. The first was a 380 signed copy edition of Sixe Idillia by Theocritus, printed at the Cloister Press under the supervision of Stanley Morison. This was followed in 1923 by Odes by John Keats, in a 170 signed copy edition and in 1924 an edition of 150 signed copy edition of Songs from \\"The Princess\\" by Tennyson. Both the Keats and the Tennyson were also produced in ordinary editions. Her final commission was her swan song; in 1926 MacMillan published an edition of Tess of the d'Urbervilles by Thomas Hardy with 41 wood engravings by Gribble. There was a main edition of 1,500 copies, and an edition of 325 copies signed by Hardy which sold out before publication. Her work is represented in several national collections, the British Museum,Wood engravings by Gribble held at the British Museum the Central SchoolWood engravings by Gribble held at the Central School and the Fitzwilliam Museum.Wood engravings by Gribble held at the Fitzwilliam ==An overview of Gribble's work== Gribble's wood engravings are clearly modern, but in the black line tradition of Edward Gordon Craig and Lucien Pissarro rather than the prevailing white line tradition. She was prominent in the early period of modern wood engraving, but her period of activity (1912-1926) reflects the lifespan of that modern black line tradition, which was clearly over before her early death. Many of her engravings are in a classical tradition, but the engravings for Tess are more modern in style and content and make greater use of white line engraving. Gribble herself is the model for Tess, and her husband for Angel Clare. The final judgement goes to Douglas Percy Bliss, who wrote of the limitations of the black line style of Gribble and Rooke: If their work had more verve and vitality they would be among the best book -decorators of our time.Douglas Percy Bliss, A History of Wood-Engraving (London, J.M.

Along with other moth species, it is commonly known as a yucca moth. T. intermedia lives in North America, particularly the United States. The moth resides in the southwest, the Great Plains, the Southeast, and mid-Atlantic. It also has been found much farther north in regions of Canada like Ontario and Alberta. There are also notable populations present in New Mexico. Their habitats are diverse and vary in terms of climate, landscape, and other factors. The moth lives in sand dunes, forests (pine, pinyon, oak), glades, grassland, desert, and forests from the East Coast to the Southwest. Yucca moths have developed a strong mutualism with the yucca plant, such that both depend on each other for survival. The yucca moths and yucca plants have coevolved over millions of years. However, Tegeticula intermedia differs from most yucca moths in that it exhibits cheating behavior by laying eggs without pollinating the yucca plant. __TOC__ == Geographic range == T. intermedia primarily lives within the United States in the Southwest and Great Plains. However, it also has managed to maintain populations in the Southeast, including Florida, Georgia, and Virginia. It has additionally been found in Ontario and Alberta, Canada. The latest research suggests that T. intermedia originated from the Southwestern region of the United States, approximately located in present New Mexico. It then followed the yucca plant as it propagated eastward and into the south, particularly in Florida. The sister species to T. intermedia, Tegeticula cassandra, also exhibits cheating behavior in pollination and is restricted to the Southeastern United States. This led some scientists to believe that T. intermedia originated from this region, known as the \\"out-of-Florida hypothesis.\\" However, recent mtDNA analysis suggests that the species did in fact originate in the West. == Habitat == Yucca moths such as T. intermedia tend to live where their partner yucca plants do. T. intermedia has been found to reside in a diverse array of environments including shrub deserts, coastal dunes, prairies, forests (pine and oak), and glades. This moth has an approximate vertical distribution from 0-1400m. == Food resources ==  Caterpillar  Yucca flaccida (as Yucca orchioides var. major) Bot. Mag. 103. tab. 6316. 1877 Larvae feed on a variety of plants within the yucca genus, depending on the region of the population. Some host species include Yucca filamentosa, Y. arkansana, and Y. flaccida. Larvae feed on yucca seeds within the fruit. Since there is an abundance of seeds within the fruit, the larva does not impinge too heavily upon the health of the yucca plant or compete too strongly with other pollinator species of yucca moths. These seeds are the only known food source to the yucca moth larvae. The larvae of T. intermedia superficially crawl towards the ovary so they can burrow past the wall and commence feeding upon the developing seeds. They then escape from the flower, falling to the ground to burrow and cocoon.  Adult  Adults have such short lifespans that they do not need to eat to achieve their reproductive goals. Although they do have mouth parts or tentacles, these are used for collecting pollen than for feeding. == Parental care ==  Host plant selection for egg laying  The host yucca plant regulates the number of eggs laid by selectively abscessing flowers that are overburdened with eggs. The plant selects which flowers to abscess by assessing its weight due to the excess of eggs and by recognizing severe ovule damage due to excessive oviposition. In T. intermedia, the moth avoids ovipositing into the ovule directly. Thus, the plant does not perceive ovule damage, and will not abort the flower.  Oviposition  Although most yucca moths deposit their eggs in the ovule of the flower, Tegeticula employs different methods of laying eggs. T. intermedia employs superficial oviposition, meaning that the yucca moth lays its eggs very slightly beneath the plant tissue, so as not to damage the yucca ovule. This strategy allows the moth to bypass the yucca plant's regulation of the number of eggs it hosts, leading to exploitation of the plant. Oviposition takes place in the fruit of the yucca. == Life cycle == Egg Yucca moths mate in the spring when the yucca flowers are in bloom. They then mate on the yucca flower, usually in the evening when the flower will be open. Then, the female moth will lay eggs in the wall of the fruit of the yucca, typically around 6-20 day old fruits. T. intermedia is unique in that it will superficially oviposit eggs one at a time so as to deceive the yucca plant. Caterpillar Once laid, the larvae will hatch quickly in only a few days time. During early instars the larvae feed inside the fruit on the developing seeds. Later in their development, the matured instars leave the fruit, preferably after a rain storm or during wet conditions to make escape easier. Pupa The larvae fall to the ground, burying themselves in a cocoon one to two dozen centimeters below ground during pupation. Adult The adult moths will emerge in the following spring to restart the life cycle. == Protective behavior == T. intermedia is a predominantly white colored insect. Mild color variation occurs in different regions. The white color allows the moth to blend in with the yucca flower, camouflaging it from predators. == Genetic hybridization == Hybridization is when two different species or genetically different varieties of the same species are able to breed and produce offspring together. The offspring may have limited reproductive capability. T. intermedia has successfully been able to mate with a similar moth, Tegeticula cassandra. Both have incredibly similar superficial ovipositor and aedeagus physiology. However, T. intermedia has not been found to have hybridized with any species with a locule ovipositor. Research suggests that it is thus the similarity in ovipositor that allows two different species to hybridize. == Physiology == T. intermedia has a modest wingspan of around 25 mm. The fore wings can occasionally have a slight tan color, but the body of the moth is predominately white. The hind wings are a soft, light grey and brown color. These moths tend to be lighter in more southern populations. Female moths have special tentacles as mouth parts (although it does not eat as an adult) which it uses to scrape pollen from a yucca anther into a relatively large, sticky ball that can be as big as 10% of her body mass .  Olfaction  Female yucca moths use their antennae to sense if a flower has already been visited, and presumably oviposited on, by another female by detecting trace pheromones left behind. If detected, the female leaves and finds another flower that hopefully has not been pollinated yet. == Parasitism ==  With plants  Yucca moths get their name for the intense, obligate mutualism they share with the yucca genus that has evolved over millions of years. The yucca moth is the only insect capable of pollinating the yucca plant. Likewise, the yucca plant is the only biological resource that sustains the moth. Both are so deeply interdependent on each other for survival that in most cases one local population extinction event of either the plant or moth would lead to an extinction of the complementary species. However, Tegeticula intermedia is a cheater species of yucca moth that parasitizes the yucca plant. It has evolved to superficially oviposit to avoid detection by the yucca that would allow it to lay many eggs without inducing flower abortion. The key trait of this species is that it lays eggs without pollinating the yucca. It enjoys the benefits of reproducing without the costs of aiding yucca reproduction at the expense of the host. ==References External links == * http://tolweb.org/Tegeticula_intermedia/12474 (includes pictures of species and range map) Category:Moths described in 1892 Category:Prodoxidae ","title":"Tegeticula intermedia"},{"id":"35299491","text":"Bernard Foley (born 8 September 1989) is an Australian rugby player of Irish descent.

Waratahs 2014‚Äì15 Foley was the first choice fly-half during the 2014 Waratahs season, having cemented his position in the 2012‚Äì13 seasons, and only having to compete with two new players, 19-year-old Dave Horwitz, 23-year-old Ben Volavola and edging out former number one fly-half, Kurtley Beale. Foley opened his 2014 campaign off in round 2 ‚Äì round 1 was played by the South African conference ‚Äì by kicking five conversions and one penalty for a combined score of thirteen points. Helping the Waratahs to a smooth six-try bonus point victory (43‚Äì21) over the Perth-based Western Force at Allianz Stadium, Sydney.

On 26 July 2014, the Waratahs played the Brumbies at Allianz Stadium, Sydney, in the Semi-final. Foley kicked one conversion and three penalty goals (11 points), and the Waratahs ran out 26 to 8 winners to host their first ever Super Rugby final.

Bernard Foley scored a total of 252 points in the 2014 Super Rugby season. 2015 was an unsuccessful season compared with 2014. However, Foley managed five tries in 2015 one short of his successive six the season prior. Foley scored a total of 187 points with the Waratahs winning the Australian conference before going down to the Highlanders in the Semi-finals. In July 2015, Foley signed a three-year flexible contract with the Australian Rugby Union, becoming the first player to sign such a deal. The contract enabled him to play two seasons of rugby in Japans Top League, whilst remaining eligible to represent Australia. 2016‚Äì17 The 2016 season was another unsuccessful season for both Foley and the Waratahs. Foley only registered 1 try, 15 penalty goals and 35 conversions (120 points). The Waratahs finished 2nd in the Australian conference, 6th in the Australasian conference and 10th overall. 2017 was one of the most unsuccessful seasons in Australian Super Rugby history, which also took a toll on both Foley's success on the field and the New South Wales Waratahs. Foley managed to score 3 tries, 12 penalty goals and 31 conversions (113 points) in 2017. The Waratahs finished second last (4th) in the Australian conference, 9th in the Australasian conference, and 16th overall with only the Japanese team the Sunwolves and the Rebels finishing with less points. 2018‚Äì19 Foley had an exciting 2018 season following two very disappointing years in 2016 and 2017. Foley played a fundamental role for the Waratahs in 2018, similar to his role in the Waratahs' 2014 campaign. Foley started off the 2018 campaign on 24 February 2018 against South African team the Stormers. Foley kicked three conversions and two penalty goals for a total score of fourteen points in a 34‚Äì17 victory at home. In round 3 of the 2018 Super Rugby season, Foley kicked one penalty goal and three conversions, including a seventy-eighth-minute penalty goal to level the score, in a 24‚Äì24 draw with the Sharks of Durban at Kings Park Stadium.

Foley kicked six conversions and one penalty goal between those rounds. In round 14 Foley converted four of the six tries scored against the Highlanders and kicked one penalty goal to score eleven points in a 41‚Äì12 victory over the New Zealand side at home. Leading towards the Super Rugby finals, the Waratahs won three and lost two with Foley scoring fifty seven points. Kicking twenty-four conversions, five penalty goals and scoring one try in the process. In the Super Rugby Qualifying final, Foley played an important role in the Waratahs' hopes of winning. Foley kicked two penalty goals before the tenth minute before the Highlanders scored two converted tries and also had three penalty goals to add. Losing 6‚Äì23 at half-time, Foley went on to score two tries, which he converted, before the end of the game. Foley scored a season game high of twenty-five points. The Waratahs won 30‚Äì23 at home. Following the superb performance at home the week before, Foley only had six points to his name in the Semi-final against the . The Waratahs lost 44‚Äì26 to finish the 2018 season. Foley finished the season confidently as he finished top scorer in the competition with 223 points. Foley started the 2019 season in round 1 against the Hurricanes at Brookvale Oval, Sydney. Foley scored a conversion kick in the 44th minute, after a try from Waratahs centre Curtis Rona, and four penalty goals in the 3rd, 12th, 16th and 40th minute. However, Foley missed a penalty goal late in the game. The Waratahs lost 19‚Äì20. Round 2, the Waratahs played against the Sunwolves in Tokyo. Foley kicked two conversions, missing two in a windy match. The Waratahs won by one point (30‚Äì31). After a round 3 bye, Foley played against rivals the Queensland Reds at the Sydney Cricket Ground, Sydney. Foley kicked three penalty goals and converted two out of three tries scored in an eleven-point victory. Japan Kubota Spears It was confirmed by the Waratahs that Foley would be leaving the club to stay in Japan post World Cup to play club rugby with the Kubota Spears. This was Foley's second spell in Japan, previously playing for the Ricoh Black Rams in 2015/16. ==International career== Wallabies in 2017.250px 2013‚Äìpresent In July 2013, Michael Cheika, the former New South Wales Waratahs coach, announced that he would send a 34-man New South Wales Barbarians squad to Argentina to take on the Pumas in a two-match series, with Foley being named in the squad. On 3 August 2013, the Barbarians lost 29‚Äì27 in La Plata, Buenos Aires to Argentina. Foley kicked one penalty goal in the seventy-seventh minute. Foley made his debut on 5 October 2013 against Argentina in the final match of the 2013 Rugby Championship. Foley come off the bench in the 65th minute replacing Quade Cooper. He played less than fifteen minutes before scoring his first international try in a seven-try victory in Rosario, Argentina under head coach Ewen McKenzie. Foley's first start as a fly-half for Australia was on 7 June 2014 against France during the France tour of Australia at Suncorp Stadium, Brisbane. Foley started all three games at fly-half and scored a total of thirty-two points (ten conversions, four penalty goals). 2015 Rugby World Cup The 2015 Rugby World Cup was a very successful showing for Foley. He showed his creativity as well as his awareness and vision on the field. His link up play as a number ten with the other players around him showed just how important he was to the Wallabies and his ability to stay calm during the big moments throughout 2015. This was Foley's first Rugby World Cup campaign with Australia. Foley made his debut in the Rugby World Cup against Fiji on 23 September in Cardiff. He kicked two of the three tries scored and three penalty goals. Australia beat Fiji 28‚Äì13. Foley's second game in his first Rugby World Cup campaign came against England and was one of his best performances on the international stage. Foley scored twenty-eight points alone (two tries, three conversions, and four penalty goals) compared with England's thirteen. Australia ran out 13‚Äì33 winners at Twickenham, knocking England out of the World Cup and sending themselves and Wales through to the quarterfinals. On 10 October, he was once again instrumental in Australia's progression, scoring all 15 points against Wales, in a 15‚Äì6 victory and progressed to the quarterfinals having won Pool A. Foley's role against Scotland in the quarterfinals was critical, however, Foley's conversion rate was far from critical, having missed three of five conversions. Foley managed to kick over an eighty-minute penalty goal to win the game for Australia in the wet conditions and send them through to the semifinals. Towards the latter end of the tournament, specifically in the knockout stage, Foley's influence on the team was less and less meaningful. Foley's most influential and impactful duty is scoring, and Foley was scoring less than earlier in the tournament. On 25 October, against Argentina, Foley scored the second-lowest number of points he had scored all tournament with nine. However, Australia kept Argentina try-less throughout the game and won 15‚Äì29 to reach the final. In the Final of the Rugby World Cup, Foley scored seven points, the lowest total of points in one game for the fly-half during the 2015 campaign. Despite only kicking two conversions and one penalty goal against the number one ranked team in the world, Foley finished equal third top point scorer with man of the match, Dan Carter. Foley finished the tournament with 82 points. Australia were defeated in the final 34‚Äì17. ==Super Rugby statistics== {  style=\\"text-align:center; line- height:90%; font-size:95%; width:100%;\\" - ! Season !! Team !! Games !! Starts !! Sub !!

Sir John Giffard, Thomas Giffard's father, with his wives, Jane, Thomas's mother and Elizabeth, Thomas's mother-in-law. From their alabaster tomb in Brewood parish church. Sir Thomas Giffard (c.1491 ‚Äì 27 May 1560) was a Tudor courtier, Staffordshire landowner and Member of the English Parliament. ==Background and early life== Thomas Giffard's father was Sir John Giffard of Chillington Hall, near Brewood, Staffordshire. Sir John was a notable courtier and soldier, as well as one of the county's wealthiest landowners, and his family had lived at Chillington since the late 12th century.Victoria County History:Staffordshire, volume 5, chapter 8, s.3. Thomas Giffard's mother was Jane Horde, daughter of Thomas Horde, the most important landowner in the Bridgnorth area. She died in childbirth in 1491, within a short time of his birth, although, as his exact birth date is not known, it is unclear whether it was while giving birth to him or a subsequent child. Giffard received a brief legal education. Initially he was at the Strand Inn, one of the Inns of Chancery attached to the Middle Temple.The History of Parliament: Members 1509‚Äì1558 ‚Äì GIFFARD, Thomas (Author: A. D.K. Hawkyard) On 11 November 1512 he was admitted to the Inner Temple. His father remarried by 1515 to Elizabeth Gresley, widow of Sir John Montgomery of Cubley, Derbyshire. At the same time or a little later, Thomas Giffard married his step-mother's daughter, Dorothy, who was about two years younger than himself. As Dorothy was the heir to the Montgomery estates, Giffard was able to set himself up in modest comfort and security, independently of his father. ==Landowner== Thomas Giffard, despite his own longevity, was to outlive his father by only four years, so it was particularly fortunate for him to acquire property young. In his first wife's right, he was lord of Cubley itself and also Caverswall,Giffard of Chillington at Ancestry.co.uk a small manor to the north-east of Stafford, on the edge of the Staffordshire moorlands. The couple settled at Caverswall Castle, and this was to remain Giffard's main home, even after his wife's death, which was by 1529, as this was the year of his second marriage. However, Giffard did not content himself with waiting to inherit the family estates. He was Escheator for Staffordshire in 1523‚Äì24. Thereafter he sought positions managing the estates of other major landowners. He became bailiff and custodian of Brewood Park, a major part of the Bishop of Coventry and Lichfield's land in Brewood parish. For this he was receiving ¬£5 0s. 8d. in 1535. The sum was not huge but for ambitious landed gentry such posts were a foot in the door: later, the Giffards would become not merely keepers but tenants of the park and able to profit more amply from managing it. Giffard also took on a similar post at the manor of Shenstone, Staffordshire. Black Ladies today: a large private residence incorporating 16th and 17th century structures erected by the Giffard family after the dissolution of the priory. The passing of the Dissolution of the Lesser Monasteries Act in 1536 brought further opportunities, opening up a wide range of small properties for landowners and entrepreneurs at Giffard's level. Soon he was bidding for Black Ladies Priory, a dissolved nunnery to the west of Brewood. Sir Edward Littleton, his contemporary and neighbour at Pillaton Hall was a competitor, with Bishop Rowland Lee on his side. The matter was referred to Thomas Cromwell, who decided in favour of Thomas Giffard, described as \\"of Stretton\\", a manor on the southern edge of Penkridge and close to Black Ladies, which he had taken on by this time. Giffard paid ¬£134 1s. 8d. for the property, which consisted of the site and grounds of the priory building itself, including the church and churchyard a water-mill, together with a tract of grazing land in Brewood ‚Äì all valued at ¬£7 9s. 1d. a year.Victoria County History: Staffordshire, Volume 3, chapter 6, s.1 He built a new house on the site and seems to have moved to live in it. After his father's death, he leased Black Ladies to Humphrey, a younger son, although the reversion remained with John Giffard, his heir.Victoria County History:Staffordshire, volume 5, chapter 8, s.4. Sir Thomas Giffard was sufficiently prominent, even before inheriting the family estates, to be pricked High Sheriff of Staffordshire three times: 1529‚Äì30, 1547‚Äì8, and 1553-4. He was a Justice of the Peace for Stafordshire from 1532 until his death. He inherited the Giffard estates only in 1556. As son and heir, he obtained the lordships of Chillington, Marston, Plardiwick near Gnosall and Walton in Eccleshall, and as a lessee of the Crown the lordship of Pattingham. Together with his own substantial estates, all this made him, for a short time, a very wealthy man. ==Courtier== Anne of Cleves by Hans Holbein the Younger, c. 1539. The festivities marking her arrival were a high point in Giffard's career at Court. Like his father, Giffard was frequently at the royal court, where he had attained the post of Gentleman Usher of the Privy Chamber by 1533 and held it until his death. As a close confidant of the king, he was honoured further by being made Ranger of Cannock forest jointly with his father. Sometimes Thomas worked with his father in the royal service. In 1539 they were sent to make ready the castles at Dover and Sittingbourne for the arrival of Anne of Cleves, on her way to meet the king at Blackheath, although the king actually surprised her by appearing in disguise at Rochester. Like other courtiers, he also proved his loyalty by taking up arms on the king's behalf. In 1544, aged at least 53, he enlisted in an army of 40,000 under the dukes of Norfolk and Suffolk to invade in northern France, as part of the Italian War of 1542‚Äì1546. However, the campaign became bogged down in protracted sieges and ended inconclusively after a few months, when Charles V, Henry VIII's main ally in the war, made a separate peace. ==Parliamentary career== Giffard was returned to the English parliament for the first time in 1539 as one of the knights of the shire for Staffordshire. The other member was Edward Littleton,The History of Parliament: Constituencies 1509‚Äì1558 ‚Äì Staffordshire (Author: N. M. Fuidge) already an experienced parliamentarian. The parliament lasted for just over a year and its main business was to pass the Second Act of Dissolution, which dealt with the larger monasteries. After this, Giffard was not elected to parliament again until October 1553, the first parliament of Mary's reign. The obvious reason would be his known religious conservatism. This was shared not only with his father, but also his colleague, Littleton, and he too was out of parliament until October 1553. However, Giffard was not out of favour with Edward VI or his governments. In fact he was knighted on 22 February 1547, just two days after the new king was crowned. It is more likely that the local political situation was the reason. Elections were becoming more competitive and that it was simply harder to secure a seat. The election of 7 September 1553 resulted in Giffard's being \\"chosen by every man's voice\\": literally true, as an acclamation or voice vote was used unless the closeness of the voting necessitated a poll. Baron Stafford was determined to have his son, Henry, win the other seat and claimed victory. Littleton therefore demanded a count and was found to have a large majority, but the dispute still went as far as Stephen Gardiner, the Lord Chancellor, before Littleton could join Giffard again as MP for the county. The parliament lasted only two months and it was followed by two more brief parliaments in 1554. Giffard was not elected to either of them, and would have been unable to serve in the first, as he was Sheriff. However, the post did afford him the pleasure of returning his own son John as member for the borough of Stafford. Giffard was returned again for the county late in 1555, once more with Littleton. Conservative by instinct, both tended to conform to whatever the regime demanded. Both were Catholic and neither was recognised by Elizabeth as a member who had \\"stood for the true religion\\" in the previous reign. Giffard, like Littleton, went along with Mary's legislation, ignoring any attempts to organise resistance. Unlike Littleton, however, Giffard outlived Mary's Counter-Reformation and was forced to make a decision when faced by the Elizabethan Religious Settlement. He seized the opportunity afforded by the new, Protestant queen's coronation to sue for pardon, thus decisively declaring for the Catholic cause ‚Äì a fateful decision for the Giffard family, who were to remain recusant for many generations. ==Marriages and Family== Sir Thomas Giffard, flanked by his wives, Dorothy and Ursula. :*Dorothy Montgomery was Thomas Giffard's first wife. She was the daughter and heiress of Sir John Montgomery of Cubley, Derbyshire and Elizabeth Gresley. He married Dorothy at, or shortly after, his father's second marriage to the widowed Elizabeth Gresley, around 1515. She brought him substantial estates in Staffordshire and Derbyshire. Dorothy had died by 1529. They had at least one surviving child, a daughter named Elizabeth, but no male heir. :*Ursula Throckmorton was Giffard's second wife. She was the daughter of Robert Throckmorton of Coughton Court, Warwickshire, and Elizabeth Baynham. Her brother, George Throckmorton, was an MP and prominent politician of strongly Catholic sympathies. Giffard had at least nine children with Ursula: ::*John Giffard, Thomas's heir. ::*Edward Giffard ::*Humphrey Giffard ::*Robert Giffard ::*Dorothy Giffard ::*Isabella Giffard ::*Cassandra Giffard ::*Elizabeth Giffard ::*Anne Giffard Sir Thomas died on 27 May 1560 and was buried in Brewood parish church.

The album features guest performances by Andy Cutting, Jackie Oates, Jude Abbott, Cormac Byrne, Anna Esslemont, Sam Pegg, The Solo Players and London's Diversity Choir. ==Theme and songs== According to O'Hooley & Tidow, all the songs on The Fragile are linked by the common theme of vulnerability. A single from the album, \\"The Last Polar Bear\\", was released in November 2011. The track was reissued on 1 November 2012 as a double single with \\"Gentleman Jack\\". This is a song, also from the album, about Anne Lister, an early 19th-century Yorkshire lesbian gentlewoman. The words of \\"Little Boy Blue\\" are from a 19th-century poem by the American writer, Eugene Field. The poem, about a young boy and his toys, suggests that he dies and is taken by angels and his toys wait for him to return. \\"She Lived Beside the Anner\\" is a traditional folk song from Tipperary, Ireland. ==Reception== In a four-starred review, Robin Denselow of The Guardian described The Fragile as an \\"intriguing, ambitious set\\" and said that the album's cover version of Massive Attack's \\"Teardrop\\" was \\"an exquisite reworking\\".

He is known for his participation in the 1885 North-West Rebellion, which was fought in Alberta and Saskatchewan. ==Early life== Son of tribal leader Big Bear, his exact date of birth is unknown, but some assume it to be in the mid-1800s. One account has him being 43 years old in 1897,Edmonton Bulletin, February 8, 1897, page 3 while another said Little Bear was already in his 70s in 1915. He may have been born in the early or mid-1840s. He was probably living in the Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming region in the 1850s. Little Bear said in Butte, Montana in either 1912 or 1913, that his father lived along the Snake River in Idaho but relocated to the Butte, Montana region to hunt for buffalo and other wild game. The Black Hills War Little Bear was said to have participated in the Great Sioux War of 1876 or Black Hills War. However, nearly all the battles of that war were fought in Montana and northeastern Wyoming. After the War, many Cree fled north to Canada and west into British Columbia, Idaho, Oregon, and Washington, but Little Bear and his family continued to live in extreme northern Montana.  Treaty of Fort Industry  Apparently, a different native of the name Little Bear was at the 1805 signing of the Treaty of Fort Industry, but this could not have been the Little Bear discussed here as he was not born yet at that time. On July 4, 1805 Little Bear along with leaders from Wyandot, Ottawa, Chipawa, Munsee and Delaware, Shawanee, and Pottawatima nations signed the Treaty of Fort Industry with the United States government at Fort Industry in Ohio. This treaty ceded their lands to the US government but allowed for the tribes to continue to hunt and fish in the lands that they formerly owned. ==The North-West Rebellion and aftermath== In early 1885, the Cree living in central Alberta and central Saskatchewan fought and lost in the North-West Rebellion against Canada. Frog Lake Massacre During the Rebellion, Wandering Spirit led a group of soldiers‚Äîincluding Little Bear‚Äîinto attacking the tiny settlement of Frog Lake, Alberta. They killed nine Whites in what became known as the Frog Lake Massacre. Return to Montana After the Rebellion ended, Little Bear and Lucky Man, knowing the Canadian Whites were after them, fled. The two gathered many of their people and journeyed back to Montana. They slipped through the Babb, Montana region in 1885 and hid out in that region, and then roamed about their original Montana homeland. They frequented the land on and around the Flathead Reservation which the Flathead Indians' agent did not like. Little Bear was considered the leader of the Ojibwas of the Basin, Montana region (southwest Montana). Deportation Montana native and non-native peoples did not welcome Little Bear and his group, saying he had not been born in the United States. They called for Little Bear and the Ojibwas he led to be deported to Canada. For the first couple of years after returning to their original Montana homeland, many of Little Bear's people roamed throughout the vast Blackfeet reservation on the U.S. side of the line. In 1888, the United States reduced the size of the Blackfeet reservation and divided it into three small reservations - the Blackfeet reservation, Fort Belknap reservation, and the Fort Peck reservation. Life got harder for Little Bear and his people, and they often went hungry. In 1895, the United States deported Little Bear, Lucky Man and hundreds of other landless Cree and Ojibwas of Montana back to Canada. Little Bear and Lucky Man feared the death penalty for their participation in the attacks at Frog Lake. When they arrived in Canada, they were apprehended. One account has it they stood trial for their part in the Massacre and were acquitted of the charges, while another says no charges were laid against Little Bear as the magistrate said the evidence did not deem charges. (It is noticeable that Little Bear is listed among the eight Natives hanged on Nov. 27, 1885 at Battleford, so perhaps the government did not want the confusion, or mistaken identity to come out in public.) Little Bear settled in Canada perhaps at Onion LakeEdmonton Bulletin, August 13, 1896, page 3 and in 1898 travelled, with Rev. John McDougall, to Ottawa to complain of the treatment of his people by the government.Edmonton Bulletin, February 8, 1897, page 3 He soon returned to Montana. ==Efforts to gain a reservation== Little Bear knew he had to follow the Chippewa leader Rocky Boy if the landless nations of Montana were to gain reservations. In 1902, Rocky Boy and Little Bear attempted to gain either a reservation or tribal recognition on the Flathead reservation. The bill to make the Flathead reservation for other landless tribes failed in 1904. In 1905, 1906, 1908, and around 1911 Little Bear contacted Canadian leaders to request land for some of the Cree of Montana. At least five First Nations were set aside for the Chippewa of Montana. They are the Onion Lake, Samson, Ermineskin, Louis Bull, and Montana First Nations. In 1910 Little Bear and his tribe joined the Rocky Boy Reservation. The Babb Chippewa reservation In 1909, the United States set aside a new Chippewa reservation within the Blackfeet reservation, in Montana, between Saint Mary Lake, Babb, and the Canada‚ÄìUS border. Chief Rocky Boy was the first to settle there, followed by Little Bear and the people he led. In all, around 200 Chippewa and Cree people settled there. Rocky Boy reservation Since hundreds of Chippewas and Cree continued to remain landless, Rocky Boy and Little Bear stepped up their efforts to get another reservation set aside in Montana. Rocky Boy's brother, Pennahto, told Little Bear to request the old Fort Assiniboine Military Reservation be set aside as a new reservation. Neither Pennahto nor Rocky Boy lived to see the establishment of Rocky Boy Reservation. After Rocky Boy Reservation was officially established in 1916, Little Bear became its first Chairman. He was already an old man at the time. Little Bear died in 1921, at or nearly eighty years of age. ==References *Chief Little Bear Information *History of Rocky Boy Reservation Category:Ojibwe people Category:Native American leaders Category:Year of birth missing Category:19th-century births Category:1921 deaths ","title":"Little Bear (Cree)"},{"id":"35299642","text":"Alma Books is a publishing house based in Richmond, London, founded in 2005 by Alessandro Gallenzi and Elisabetta Minervini, the founders of Hesperus Press.

Derived from Genrich Altshuller‚Äôs TRIZ engineering discipline, SIT is a practical approach to creativity, innovation and problem solving, which has become a well known methodology for innovation. At the heart of SIT‚Äôs method is one core idea adopted from Genrich Altshuller's TRIZ which is also known as Theory of Inventive Problem Solving (TIPS): that inventive solutions share common patterns. Focusing not on what makes inventive solutions different but on what they share in common is core to SIT‚Äôs approach. ==History of the SIT methodology== Overview ‚Äì the creativity debate SIT deals with two main areas of creativity: Ideation of new ideas, and problem solving. In the 1970s, researchers from the field of Cognitive Psychology established a quantitative yardstick for measuring creativity: the creative person was defined as someone with a large flow of ideas. A high rate of ideas per unit of time was considered an indication of creativity. This approach led to a series of methods for developing creativity based on the assumption that a quantitative increase of ideas will necessarily bring about a qualitative improvement. Such widely known methods as brainstorming, Synectics, random stimulation and lateral thinking (identified with Edward de Bono) can be traced to this approach. More recent studies reveal the appearance of a different approach. These studies show that the main difficulty faced by problem solvers is not generating a large quantity of ideas but coming up with original ones. The former parallel drawn between quantity and quality appears to no longer hold true. It was discovered that a large flow of ideas does not necessarily lead to the creation of original ones and further, that the very occupation with ordinary ideas may actually hamper creativity and innovative thought. These discoveries have prompted a new approach which holds that original and interesting results stem from organized thinking and structured processes rather than the random generation of ideas. One of the characteristics of organized thinking is a state of ‚Äúlow stimuli‚Äù, unencumbered by a large quantity of ideas. In this approach, originality replaces quantity as a dominant criterion. This organized or structured approach to idea generation is the starting point for Systematic Inventive Thinking. The TRIZ heritage SIT is a descendant of the work of Genrich Altshuller, a Russian engineer who analyzed over 200,000 patents to identify the 40 common inventive principles of his unique formula, named TRIZ. Altshuller‚Äôs main discovery was that creative solutions incorporate an elimination of a conflict in the problem state. A conflict is a state where one parameter must be changed, in order to get some benefit, but changing that parameter causes a deterioration of another important parameter. Routine engineering design deals with this situation by searching for the \\"best fit\\" compromise, a trade off that maximized the utility and minimizes the negative impact of a specific configuration of the variance of the available input parameters. Altshuller found that the engineering conflicts can be indexed according to the type of parameters involved (39 common engineering parameters were initially defined). Examining numerous inventions made it possible to assign each conflict with a set of possible hints or strategies on how to approach the solution to the problem. Three types of hints are used: principles, standards and physical effects. There are 40 principles; each help with defining high level strategies for solving the problem. There are 70 standards, which are more elaborated ideas based on collective past solutions. There is a knowledge base of approximately 400 physical effects ranging across physical, chemical and geometrical aspects, indexed according to the functions that each effect can carry out. During the 1970s, one of Altshuller's students, Ginadi Filkovsky, immigrated to Israel and joined the Open University in Tel Aviv. He began teaching TRIZ and adapting it to the needs of both Israeli and international hi-tech companies. A number of key academics were involved in this research. Two Ph.D. students, Jacob Goldenberg and Roni Horowitz, joined Filkovsky, focusing their research on developing and simplifying the methodology. Their work formed the basis of the SIT method as it exists today. Both TRIZ and SIT share a basic assumption - that one can study existing creative ideas in a field, identify common logical patterns in these ideas, translate the patterns into a set of Thinking Tools, and then apply these Thinking Tools to generate new creative ideas. In spite of the commonalties, SIT strongly differs from TRIZ in several important respects, having to do mainly with its practical application. From TRIZ to SIT The move from TRIZ to SIT was motivated by the desire to create a method that is easier to learn and retain (achieved through a smaller number of rules and tools), more universal in application (achieved through elimination of engineering specific tools) and tighter in keeping the problem solver within a real inventive framework (the Closed World principle). TRIZ also favors using existing resources for solving a problem. But in contrast to SIT, this principle is scattered around the method. It can be found in the principle of Ideal Final Result (‚Äúthe best system is when there is no system‚Äù ‚Äì Altshuller). The difference between TRIZ and SIT in this respect is that in SIT the Closed World condition is the most important principle. This is particularly applicable when the template approach is applied to problem solving. The first step in using SIT for Problem Solving is to define the problem world. Once defined, the problem solver knows that all the building blocks for the solution are right there in front of them and that the solution simply requires the reorganization of the existing objects. This adds great focus and power to the method. It also turns every real problem into an amusing puzzle. ==Five thinking tools== 1. Subtraction Remove an essential component from a product and find uses for the newly envisioned arrangement of the existing components. This abstracted arrangement is known as a \\"virtual product\\". 2. Multiplication Add to a product a component of the same type as an existing component. The added component should be changed in some way. The 2 keywords for this tool are: 1) more and 2) different. These represent the two stages for applying the tool: 1) add more copies of something that exists in the product and 2) change those copies according to some parameter. 3. Division Divide the product and/or its components and rearrange them to form a new product. Using this tool forces consideration of different structures, either on the level of the product/service as a whole, or on the level of an individual component. Dividing a product to many pieces gives the freedom to reconstruct it in many new ways ‚Äì it increases our degrees of freedom for working with the situation. 4. Task unification Assign a new and additional task to an existing resource. Less affluent cultures are more likely to adopt the Task Unification mindset. For example, the Bedouins use camels for a number of different tasks: transportation, currency, milk, skin for tents, shade, protection from the wind, burning feces for fuel. More affluent societies tend to jettison resources. 5. Attribute dependency Creating and dissolving dependencies between variables of a product. Attribute dependency works with variables rather than components. Variables are easy to identify as those characteristics that can change within a product or component (e.g. color, size, material). ==Principles== The closed world ‚Äì thinking inside the box The closed-world condition is crucial to SIT‚Äôs methodology. The first step in using SIT is to define the problem world. Once defined, the problem solver knows that all the building blocks for the solution are right there in front of him and that the solution simply requires the reorganization of the existing objects. This adds great focus and power to the method. It also can turn every real problem into an amusing puzzle. The closed-world condition deals with the resemblance between the problem world and the solution world. The condition stipulates that in the development of a new product or when addressing a problem one must utilize only elements already existing in the product/problem, or in the immediate environment. This condition forces us to rely on resources already at our disposal, rather than \\"importing\\" new external resources for the solution. The closed-world condition often provokes resistance as it runs counter to some of the most common intuitions about creative thinking, especially the ubiquitous notion of \\"thinking out of the box\\". The essential claim of \\"thinking out of the box\\" is that in order to produce ideas that are new and different, you need to somehow move beyond normal thinking patterns, to a universe located outside the metaphorical box. The closed-world condition, by contrast, forces the thinker to find a creative solution by heavily limiting the space of possibilities. Since the scope of possibilities is artificially limited there is no choice but to reconsider the relations between elements found within the problem and pay closer attention to them: their arrangement in space and time; their assigned functions and their necessity. Thus, the closed-world condition sets us on a collision course with our fixedness, allowing us to arrive at solutions which are both innovative (different from the usual) and simple (since based on existing and known elements). Qualitative change The qualitative-change principle dictates that solutions can be found where the main problem element or variable in the existing situation is either totally eliminated or even reversed. In other words, a problematic element in a situation is neutralized, so it no longer presents an obstacle. It can also be the case that the problematic element becomes a key positive factor; the situation is \\"reversed\\", and the disadvantage transforms into an advantage. Function follows form A term coined by Ronald Finke, \\"function follows form\\" is often considered a ‚Äúbackwards‚Äù process in that the starting point for thinking of new ideas is the existing resource base rather than specific needs that have been identified in the market. These needs, however, are never ignored ‚Äì they are simply introduced at a later stage. The process begins with an existing product (or service), continues with manipulating it systematically to create what SIT calls a \\"virtual product\\" (this is the form) and only then examines whether it satisfies existing or potential customer needs (function). The \\"function follows form\\" principle is applied as an overarching framework to focus the application SIT‚Äôs thinking tools. Function follows form Function follows form is a principle associated with classic architecture, and it is also being used in government buildings. The concept of this principle means design created according to a shape, but do not consider its function at initial stage of architectural design. Path of most resistance In nature, water cascading down a mountain will always follow the path of least resistance ‚Äì the easiest route. In thinking, too, our minds tend to take the path of least resistance ‚Äì those avenues most familiar to us. So doing, it is difficult to arrive at ideas new to us or to our competitors. SIT encourages an approach to the counter-intuitive path ‚Äì the path of most resistance. Cognitive fixedness Cognitive fixedness is a state of mind in which an object or situation are perceived in one specific way, to the exclusion of any alternative. There are several types of fixedness, among them: Functional fixedness A term coined by the social scientist Karl Dunker. Functional fixedness is the tendency to ascribe specific functions to respective objects. Dunker sees functional fixedness as a ‚ÄúMental block against using an object in a new way that is required to solve a problem‚Äù, as described in his cognitive performance test, known as the candle problem. Structural fixedness This is the tendency to view objects as a whole, as a gestalt, which often makes it difficult to imagine how the product could be reorganized to look differently. For example, why do TV controls always have to be on the lower part of the TV set? Would it not be easier if they were on the upper part? When television sets were first introduced, the controls were potentiometers made out of wax. The heat that was emitted from the cathode-ray tubes, dispersing upwards would melt the controls had they been located on the upper part. Therefore, they were placed on the lower part. But since then, new generations of TV sets are available, and still one would find the controls on the lower part. This is structural fixedness. Near far sweet Most ideas for new products are either uninspired or impractical. Finding the \\"sweet spot\\" requires a balance that leads to both ingenious and viable ideas. This notion was expressed in a Harvard Business Review Article entitles ‚ÄúFinding Your Innovation Sweet Spot‚Äù. When we innovate we push our thinking outward, trying to create something new and different from what we have now. Yet we do not want to wander too far off. A \\"great\\" idea must be executable and palatable. The NFS principle assures that our ideation will generate ideas that are sufficiently removed from our current situation in order to be interesting, while nevertheless close enough to our core competence in order to be feasible. The SIT thinking process uses the FFF procedure and the five thinking tools in order to generate new forms (virtual products). These forms if unrestrained might lead to \\"far\\" ideas. The \\"closed world\\" condition for example acts as an inhibitor, making sure we don't wander too far out. This combination of opposite forces keeps us ideating in the sweet zone. ==The template approach to new product development== SIT approaches new product development by identifying and applying certain well-defined schemes derived from an historical analysis of product-based trends, termed patterns or templates. These templates may contribute to the understanding and prediction of new product emergence. The invention of new products has traditionally involved methods that encourage the generation of large numbers of ideas. The notion that the rewards of generating a large number of ideas outweigh the costs can be traced back to early studies in the field. In view of the fact that this process tends to be highly complex and un-formalized, those involved in generating new ideas may seek ways to become more productive as they progress from one ideation task to another. Some may succeed in identifying patterns of invention that are common to different contexts and apply them within a certain product category, or even try to apply them to other product categories. Individuals who adopt such a cognitive strategy may expect to gain an advantage over others who treat every task as new and unrelated to past ideation. However, even if they prove productive, the patterns are likely to be idiosyncratic and, quite often, not even verbally definable. As such, they lack permanence and generalizability. SIT sets is built on the thesis that certain patterns are identifiable, objectively verifiable, widely applied, and learnable, and that these patterns, termed templates, can serve as a facilitative tool that channels the ideation process, enabling the individual to be more productive and focused. The usual process of developing new products begins with a definition of market need. This is done based on intuition or on market analysis, focus groups etc. After defining the needs, a process is begun of developing products to address these needs. This process is called form follows function, as the form of the new product is derived from the function that it should fulfill. This process has a few disadvantages: # Most customers have difficulties in thinking about needs or products, which do not exist. This is particularly true for needs which are not vital. For example: how many customers thought of the need for a compact, transportable cassette player as addressed by Walkman? How many customers thought about the possibility to use the Internet communication as a means to conduct telephone calls? # To find those customers which do think of new needs\\\\products, huge and very expensive surveys are needed. But even if you succeed in finding those people, chances are they will not be keen to share their good ideas for free. # If the need is clear or easy to define, it is most likely that, at least a few of your competitors have already defined it and are in the process of addressing the need. In order to overcome these problems, the SIT method suggests starting the process of product development from the product itself. Applying systematic thinking tools in analyzing the product can lead to potential new products or to a definition of new needs. The advantages of this method are as follows: # The process requires only a limited number of hours and is conducted in-house. # Applying the method yields many new ideas and a definition of many potential new needs. # As the new products are based on the old one, no major changes are usually required in production. One of the important elements of SIT is to characterize the system and environmental variables. After having defined these variables, the participants are asked to examine the correlation between them, and to examine the impact of manipulating one or more of the product variables on the potential use of the \\"new\\" product; how such a change affects the correlation between the product and the environment and who may want to use such a product. ==SIT in universities and business schools== SIT is taught in numerous universities and business schools worldwide. The methodology is most often taught through programs on innovation, business administration, marketing, organizational development, leadership, management studies.

By 2007, she had made her way to Lufkin, Texas, where she was hired as a nurse at DaVita's dialysis clinic. She was hired despite a checkered employment history. At the time, she had been fired at least four times from health care jobs. One of those firings came when her bosses at Woodland Heights Hospital caught her stealing Demerol (which was found in her handbag) and cheating on a urine test.Lufkin Daily News: Jury sentences Saenz to life in prison for killing patients with bleach Saenz was married with two young children. She suffered from drug dependence and used stolen prescription medication. She had been arrested for public intoxication and criminal trespass after a 2007 domestic disturbance with her husband, though the two later reconciled.The Age: US nurse sentenced to life in prison over bleach deaths ==Suspicion mounts== In the spring of 2008, DaVita's Lufkin clinic saw an unusual spike in patients falling seriously ill during their treatments. Paramedics were called to the clinic 30 times in April ‚Äì double the number of calls in the past year. For instance, one patient, Thelma Metcalf, had to go to the emergency room several times due to getting too much Heparin blood thinner. More seriously, patients were going into cardiac arrest. The spike in EMS calls was especially unusual since under normal conditions, dialysis patients almost never code. After two patients, Thelma Metcalf and Clara Strange, died of cardiac arrest on April 1, DaVita sent one of its clinical coordinators, Amy Clinton, to Lufkin to find out what was wrong. However, the problems continued, unnerving paramedics. They passed their concerns on to their superiors at the Lufkin fire department. A department official secretly wrote state health inspectors and asked them to have a look.Saenz v. State ==Investigation== On April 28, 2008; with inspectors on site, two more patients, Marva Rhone and Carolyn Risinger, suffered severe drops in blood pressure. Patients Linda Hall and Lurlene Hamilton subsequently testified that they saw Saenz draw a bleach solution into two syringes, then inject the substance into Rhone and Risinger's dialysis lines. When Clinton confronted Saenz, Saenz said she was cleaning an unused dialysis machine, and used a syringe to get a precise measurement‚Äìa method that was contrary to DaVita corporate policy. The bucket Saenz was using, as well as the syringes, tested positive for bleach. Police were called in, and the clinic was shut down for two weeks. After several other syringes used by Saenz tested positive for bleach, she was fired the following day. Her nursing license was subsequently suspended. Saenz then applied to work as a receptionist in a Lufkin medical office, in violation of her bail. Research by an epidemiologist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention revealed that Saenz had been present at every incident in April at which someone died. Almost as damning, a search of Saenz' hard drive revealed Google searches for information about whether bleach could kill. When questioned by police, Saenz mentioned her use of bleach to clean lines before detectives even mentioned bleach. She claimed that there were no measuring cups available, so she had to use a syringe to measure the bleach. She was subsequently arrested on charges of five counts of capital murder and five counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. According to one of Saenz' co-workers, Candace Lackey, Saenz had expressed dislike for a number of patients, all of whom either died or coded. Another coworker, Sharon Dearmon, recalled that Saenz went on a cigarette break after tending to a patient, Opal Few. Soon afterward, Few coded, but Saenz refused to rush over to tend to her. Despite the seemingly damning forensic evidence and eyewitness accounts, police and Angelina County prosecutors were at a loss to prove that the bleach had indeed gone from the patients' dialysis lines into their bloodstreams. At the time, almost no research had been done on how to detect bleach in blood. They got in touch with Mark Sochaski, an analytical chemist and bioterrorism expert. He was developing a test for measuring chlorine exposure by measuring the presence of chlorotyrosine, an amino acid formed from exposure to chlorinating agents like bleach. Sochaski tested several samples sent to him by investigators, and discovered chlorotyrosine peaks in nine samples ‚Äì something that could only be explained by exposure to bleach. When the bleach entered the patients' bloodstream, it caused their red blood cells to explode, which in turn released iron. It was this process, called hemolysis, which caused them to go into cardiac arrest and die. ==Conviction== On March 31, 2012, an Angelina County jury convicted Saenz of murdering five patients and injuring five other patients.CNN: Woman convicted of killing patients with bleach awaits fateABC: Ex-Nurse Convicted of Bleach Killings Awaits Fate Prosecutors sought the death penalty. However, on April 2, 2012, Saenz was sentenced to five concurrent terms of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole for the five murders, plus three consecutive 20-year sentences for aggravated assault. The five murder victims were Clara Strange, Thelma Metcalf, Garlin Kelley, Cora Bryant and Opal Few.Lufkin Daily News: Angelina County jury finds Saenz guilty of killing patients at DaVita by injecting dialysis lines with bleach District attorney Clyde Herrington believed there were more victims than just the ten indicted cases, based on CDC research.Lufkin Daily News: The day Kimberly Saenz got caught The CDC epidemiologist statistically connected Saenz to other adverse health events. Lufkin Police detectives could only obtain medical waste from two weeks prior to April 28, 2008, so there was inadequate evidence to raise further indictments against Saenz in the other incidents. At the victim impact statement portion of the trial, the daughter of victim Thelma Metcalf told Saenz, \\"You are nothing more than a psychopathic serial killer. I hope you burn in hell\\".Nurses Labs: Nurse sentenced to life for killing patients by injecting them with bleach Saenz's defense team appealed to Twelfth Court of Appeal of Texas.KLTV: Jury hands down life sentence for Kim SaenzLufkin Daily News: Serial killer Saenz appeals conviction However, the appeal was denied.

It was first completed successfully on a mega ramp in 2012 by American skateboarder Tom Schaar, and on a vert ramp in May 2020 by Brazilian skateboarder Gui Khury. ==Tom Schaar== The first-ever 1080 was landed by American skateboarder Tom Schaar on March 26, 2012, at the age of 12. Schaar completed the stunt on a mega ramp at Woodward West in Tehachapi, California, on his fifth attempt. The jump was filmed by several cameras at the MegaRamp at Woodward West. A roll-over feature was custom-built which allowed the skater to drop in on the 70-foot-tall and roll right over a 50-foot gap in the ramp, thus allowing Schaar to keep momentum going all the way through to the quarter pipe. Schaar performed several 720s and a 900 while warming-up. He then attempted to perform the 1080, failing four times before successfully landing his fifth attempt, being propelled 15 feet above the top of the ramp. Red Bull described the 1080 as \\"the Holy Grail of all skateboard tricks.\\" Schaar has since repeated the feat, and completed a 1080 in competition while participating in the 2012 X Games Asia on April 30, 2012. He won the gold medal in the Skateboard Mini MegaRamp category, the youngest person ever to have done so. At The Dew Tour Ocean City Tom landed the 1080 in Skate Mega 2.0 which resulted in him coming first. ==Gui Khury== In May 2020, at the age of 11, Brazilian skateboarder Gui Khury became the first person to land a 1080 using only a vert ramp, breaking the previous record for a 900 on a vert ramp set by Tony Hawk in 1999. (Khury had previously become the youngest person to land a 900, which he achieved at age 8.)

He married her, as he had promised, but soon sought a divorce. The divorce was pronounced in 1672. According to some source, he had hoped for a huge dowry, however, the dowry she brought in was rather modest. According to this theory, when her money had been used up, William Christoph called her unfit and filed for a divorce. Anna Elisabeth received Philippseck Castle near Butzbach as her residence. She engaged in poor relief and founded schools in Bodenrod and Maibach. She died in Butzbach on 27 May 1688, at the age of 64, and was buried in the crypt below the choir of the church in M√ºnster (a district of Butzbach). == References == * Archiv f√ºr hessische Geschichte und Altertumskunde, p. 408 ff (Online) * Peter von Kobbe: Geschichte und Landesbeschreibung des Herzogthums Lauenburg, vol. 3, Harro von Hirschheydt, 1837, p. 35 ff Category:House of Ascania Category:1624 births Category:1688 deaths Category:German duchesses Category:Landgravines of Hesse-Darmstadt ","title":"Anna Elisabeth of Saxe-Lauenburg"},{"id":"35299777","text":"The Industrial (First) functional constituency () is a functional constituency in the elections for the Legislative Council of Hong Kong first created in 1985.

The stimuli are simultaneously presented to the user when focusing attention on the corresponding stimulus. For example, when the user focuses attention on a repetitive visual stimulus, an steady state visually evoked potential is elicited which manifests as oscillatory components in the user's electroencephalogram, especially in the signals from the primary visual cortex, matching the frequency or harmonics of that stimulus. Repetitive visual stimuli are said to evoke a lesser response in brain cells, specifically superior collicular cells, than moving stimuli. Habituation is very rapid in healthy subjects in reference to repetitive visual stimuli. Development changes around the first year of life are attributed for attention control and these are said to be fully functional around the ages of two and four years old. This is the age that toddlers seem to now prefer moving and changing stimuli, much like healthy adults. In infants, there is evidence that supports the hypothesis that infants prefer repetitive visual stimuli or patterns, in comparison to moving or changing targets. ==References== Category:Neurophysiology Category:Visual perception ","title":"Repetitive visual stimulus"},{"id":"35299916","text":"The following list includes notable people who were born or have lived in Harvey, Illinois.

The shock had a moment magnitude of 7.5, a maximum Mercalli Intensity of VIII (Severe), and occurred in the northwestern offshore area of Tumbes, Peru. == Geology == The North Andean convergent margin is a region of large crustal deformation. The North Andes block moves northeastwards relative to the South America at a rate of 6¬±2 mm/yr. The Nazca Plate is subducting beneath the South American Plate along the Colombia-Ecuador Trench. The subduction of the Carnegie Ridge into the Colombia-Ecuador Trench affected the crustal deformation in this region and the coupling between the Nazca Plate and the South America Plate. In addition, the subduction of the Carnegie Ridge may be an important drive contributing to the relatively northeastward movement of the North Andes block. Although there was no large earthquakes in the Gulf of Guayaquil segment of the subduction zone in the late 20th century, the strong earthquakes in 1953 and 1959 suggested that this was because of the strong coupling rather than being aseismic, and the seismic coupling may be quite high and be able to produce large earthquakes.\\"Tectonic segmentation of the North Andean margin: impact of the Carnegie Ridge collision\\" by M. -A. Gutscher, J. Malavieille, S. Lallemand, and J. -Y. Collot Besides subduction, other activities also played important roles in this region. A strike-slip fault known as the Dolores-Guayaquil megashear runs from the trench and goes inland. The Gulf of Guayaquil formed as a result of movement on the Dolores- Guayaquil megashear. == Damage == The earthquake caused 6 deaths. About 200 buildings were destroyed in Tumbes, Peru. Strong shaking could be felt in northeastern Peru and part of Ecuador. The intensity reached MM VIII in Corrales, Tumbes. In Guayaquil, Ecuador, the intensity was MM VI to VII.

The commercial center of Guayaquil is established on alluvial clay deposits interbedded with silty and clayey sand sediments, and the southwestern and southern part of Guayaquil directly lies on lands reclaimed from marshland. Large historical earthquakes, including the earthquake of 1953, showed the importance of the assessment of ground effects caused by earthquakes in Guayaquil. A new INQUA Intensity Scale has been proposed to be applied in such assessment.\\"Seismic Hazard Assessment for Guayaquil City (Ecuador): Insights from Quaternary Geological Data\\" by K. Chunga, C.

It is the average short-term correlation. If the signals have multiple components (slow and fast), scaled coefficient of correlation can be computed only for the fast components of the signals, ignoring the contributions of the slow components.Nikoliƒá D, Muresan RC, Feng W, Singer W (2012) Scaled correlation analysis: a better way to compute a cross-correlogram. European Journal of Neuroscience, pp. 1‚Äì21, doi:10.1111/j.1460-9568.2011.07987.x http://www.danko- nikolic.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Scaled-correlation-analysis.pdf This filtering-like operation has the advantages of not having to make assumptions about the sinusoidal nature of the signals. For example, in the studies of brain signals researchers are often interested in the high-frequency components (beta and gamma range; 25‚Äì80 Hz), and may not be interested in lower frequency ranges (alpha, theta, etc.). In that case scaled correlation can be computed only for frequencies higher than 25 Hz by choosing the scale of the analysis, s, to correspond to the period of that frequency (e.g., s = 40 ms for 25 Hz oscillation). ==Definition== Scaled correlation between two signals is defined as the average correlation computed across short segments of those signals. First, it is necessary to determine the number of segments K that can fit into the total length T of the signals for a given scale s: :K = \\\\operatorname{round}\\\\left(\\\\frac{T}{s}\\\\right). Next, if r_k is Pearson's coefficient of correlation for segment k, the scaled correlation across the entire signals \\\\bar{r}_s is computed as :\\\\bar{r}_s = \\\\frac{1}{K} \\\\sum\\\\limits_{k=1}^K r_k. ==Efficiency== In a detailed analysis, Nikoliƒá et al. showed that the degree to which the contributions of the slow components will be attenuated depends on three factors, the choice of the scale, the amplitude ratios between the slow and the fast component, and the differences in their oscillation frequencies. The larger the differences in oscillation frequencies, the more efficiently will the contributions of the slow components be removed from the computed correlation coefficient. Similarly, the smaller the power of slow components relative to the fast components, the better will scaled correlation perform. ==Application to cross-correlation== Example of a cross-correlogram between spike trains computed in a classical manner (left) and by using scaled correlation (right; s = 200 ms). Scaled correlation removes the slow component from the cross-correlogram. Scaled correlation can be applied to auto- and cross-correlation in order to investigate how correlations of high-frequency components change at different temporal delays. To compute cross-scaled-correlation for every time shift properly, it is necessary to segment the signals anew after each time shift. In other words, signals are always shifted before the segmentation is applied. Scaled correlation has been subsequently used to investigate synchronization hubs in the visual cortex Folias, S.E., S. Yu, A. Snyder, D. Nikoliƒá, and J.E. Rubin (2013) Synchronisation hubs in the visual cortex may arise from strong rhythmic inhibition during gamma oscillations. European Journal of Neuroscience, 38(6): 2864‚Äì2883. Scaled correlation can be also used to extract functional networks.Dolean, S., D√Æn≈üoreanu, M., Mure≈üan, R. C., Geiszt, A., Potolea, R., & ≈¢inca≈ü, I. (2017, September). A Scaled-Correlation Based Approach for Defining and Analyzing Functional Networks. In International Workshop on New Frontiers in Mining Complex Patterns (pp. 80‚Äì92). Springer, Cham. ==Advantages over filtering methods== Scaled correlation should be in many cases preferred over signal filtering based on spectral methods. The advantage of scaled correlation is that it does not make assumptions about the spectral properties of the signal (e.g., sinusoidal shapes of signals). Nikoliƒá et al. have shown that the use of Wiener‚ÄìKhinchin theorem to remove slow components is inferior to results obtained by scaled correlation. These advantages become obvious especially when the signals are non-periodic or when they consist of discrete events such as the time stamps at which neuronal action potentials have been detected. ==Related methods== A detailed insight into a correlation structure across different scales can be provided by visualization using multiresolution correlation analysis.Pasanen, L., & Holmstr√∂m, L.

The historian S.P.Aghayan called Shadlinski \\"the brave son of Azerbaijani people\\". ==Biography== He was born on February 24, 1886, in Boyuk Vedi village (now Vedi city) of Erivansky Uyezd of Erivan Governorate. He lost his father at an early age. In 1894, he studied at two-year Russo- Tatar school in his native village with the help of his mother, but he could not finish his education because of material problems. In 1902, he worked in a ground area, which he inherited from his father. The February Revolution of 1907 had a significant influence on the formation of Shadlinski's political thinking. In 1918 and 1919 he commanded the self-defence forces of Vedi. against Dashnak detachments. In autumn 1920, the \\"Red camp\\" partisan detachment, of which Shadlinski became the commander, and was distinguished during Civil War in Nakhchivan, was formed on the initiative of Nakhchivan communists. Initially the detachment consisted of 200 Azerbaijani soldiers, but later it filled with new forces of other nationalities. It is noted that Turkish command authority repeatedly wanted to bring Abbasgulu bey and his friend Huseynov to trial. Atik Azizyan, leader of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Armenia, writing about the reasons for Abbasgulu bey and his friend Huseynov's pursuit, noted, \\"The point is that these people foil plans of the Turkish Commanding Authority with their activity.\\" Later he wrote that \\"Abbasgulu bey rendered the Soviet Authority great services\\" when the Soviet authority was established in Nakhchivan and that is why Abbasgulu bey aroused hatred of Turks ... \\" Shadlinski, commander of the \\"Red Camp\\" detachment was conferred the Order of the Red Banner for his merits, which he showed in battles against the Dashnak authority. There were also 18 Azerbaijanis, including such commanders of companies as Ibrahim Farzaliyev, Alakbar Sadykhov, Museyib Akhundov, Fatulla Huseynov, Gafar Aliyev, Ibrahim Asgerov and Khalil Mehdiyev among the awarded ones. Shadlinski stayed in Nakhchivan till the end of 1922, and led a guard of state borders. From 1922 to 1928, after he returned to Vedi, he worked in several industrial positions of the Armenian SSR, and later was appointed to the chairman of a cement mill in Davalu village.

Tempio della Congregazione Olandese Alemanna, literally Temple of the Dutch German Congregation) in Livorno, Italy, is on the stretch of the Fosso Reale canal that runs between Piazza della Repubblica and Piazza Cavour. The Protestant church bears witness to the intercultural climate that once reigned in the city of Livorno. Since the second half of the 20th century, however, the church has been closed to the public and practically abandoned, and is now in need of major restoration work.An outline for a project to restore the church was presented in 1997, but little has been done since then. See Citt√† ritrovata. Le linee del progetto per recuperare la chiesa olandese e il cimitero, Il Tirreno 5 April 1997. The risk of collapse to which the building is dangerously exposed was already reported in 2005 by the vice president of the consistory of the Congregation, Ennio Weatherford.La chiesa rischia di crollare, Il Tirreno, 28 November 2005. ==History== Interior Flemish and German communities were recorded in Livorno from the origins of the city in the early 17th century when the Dutch German Congregation was established. This association is still active today, although it began its activities again after being reconstituted in 1997. To begin with, the community followed the Catholic faith and had its own altar in the Church of the Madonna, alongside those of the other foreign nations. Subsequently, the Calvinist movement prevailed and a new space was therefore needed for the burial of the community‚Äôs deceased and for their religious services. The latter were held in a room in Via del Consiglio. For around forty years, from the end of the 18th to the early 19th century, the pastor serving the community was Giovanni Paolo Schulthesius. After the Unification of Italy, a contest was announced for the design of an actual church. Among the entrants was Giuseppe Cappellini but the contest was won by Dario Giacomelli: the work began in 1862 and ended in 1864. A few years later, the economic crisis linked to the abolition of Livorno‚Äôs Porto Franco status brought about the decline of the congregation which, nevertheless, in 1903 equipped the church with a handsome organ by the Agati- Tronci company, said to be the finest in Tuscany.G. Piombanti, Guida storica ed artistica della citt√† e dei dintorni di Livorno, Livorno 1903, p. 250. The building escaped the bombings of the Second World War but was deprived of its organ. After the War, the church, with its excellent acoustics, was used for numerous concerts.During the Second World War the church was used for worship by American soldiers, as commemorated by a plaque located inside. At the end of the 1960s it was rented to the Seventh-day Adventist Church for a period of five years. Interior Following the demise of the last members of the Congregation in the second half of the 20th century, the church gradually fell into a state of decay. Behind the apse, in the area once occupied by the sacristy, the community‚Äôs school and the teacher‚Äôs accommodation, the construction of a looming apartment building was even authorised. At the same time, the ornamental details of the church began to crumble dangerously, starting with the elegant pinnacles that used to adorn the facade.A photo dated 1952 shows the church with its spires still intact. These were removed during the construction of the apartment block: see F. Cagianelli, D. Matteoni, Livorno, la costruzione di un'immagine. Tradizione e modernit√† nel Novecento, Cinisello Balsamo 2003, p. 94. At the beginning of the new millennium, following the reconstitution of the Congregation to which the church belongs, some restoration work was carried out to the roof and the windows, but not to the structure as a whole. Today, the interior vault of the counter-ceiling is in a state of semi-collapse, the resulting rubble covering the ancient wooden pews (many from the 18th century); the wooden floor has also collapsed in various points, while numerous elements of stonework have fallen off the facade.Crolli dalla facciata della chiesa sugli scali Olandesi. Colpita un'auto con due persone, edificio transennato, Il Tirreno, 10 July 2002; Chiesa degli Olandesi. Grosso masso precipita a due passi dalle auto, Il Tirreno, 10 June 2011. Furthermore, the serious decay of the building is accentuated by the delayed restoration of the retaining wall of the Fosso Reale canal that lies in front of the church. The wall caved in at the end of the 1980s but the raw cement of the incomplete repair work still remains. ==Architecture== Detail of the precarious state of the facade (2007) The Dutch German Church is a Neo-Gothic building representing one of few 19th-century constructions in this style in Livorno, and certainly the largest and most important. The crumbling facade bears three geometrically harmonious rose windows: the largest, located in the centre above the doorway, is decorated with floral motifs and is flanked by the other two a Flamboyant style. The interior consists of a large rectangular nave, preceded by a gallery above the vestibule and enclosed by a large circular apse. Giacomelli combined elements of traditional Gothic architecture with others of a Classical style: the nave contains alternating Classical-style pilasters which support pointed arches framing the ogival windows. In typical Calvinist style, there is no altar, and the apse contains a pulpit raised high, with steps on either side.

A right-handed batsman and right-arm fast-medium bowler, he has played first-class cricket for Boland since the 2009/10 season. ==Early life== Petrus Jeftha, also known as \\"Oubaas\\" in his home town (Touws River), started his cricket career at a very young age. Everyone who grew up with him or was a part of his grooming as a child would tell you that his interest in cricket started even before he could walk. He was always involved whenever the game of cricket was played or even practiced. As a young boy he used to play, what is called, street cricket in his neighborhood. There already he was seen as one of the most talented cricketers among his peers. Petrus started his schooling at the age of 6 when he attended the local primary school Steenvliet Primary School. It wasn‚Äôt long before he joined the under 11 team to showcase his talent and love for the game. He was soon selected to play for the North Boland (A sub-district of the Boland) under 12 side where he was the youngest player in his team. At only aged 12 he was selected to play for the boland under 13 Schools team as a leg spinner and middle order batsman, where he soon gained great respect for those who watched him play as well as those who played with and against him. Petrus was only 12 years old when he made his first century for North Boland against a highly respected South Boland. At the young age of only 13, Petrus joined his local cricket club, (Touws River C.C.), to improve on his skills as a cricketer .He soon became one of the club's most valuable players. During his time at the club he received various awards for his craftsmanship, such as man of the match and batsman of the year. When he was only 19 he scored a record breaking century of 180 off 134 balls, making this the fastest century in the history of Touws River Cricket Club. After completing his primary education Petrus received a bursary to go to the respected Worcester Gymnasium where he spend his high school career. It is here where his talent was truly developed as not only a cricketer but also a rugby player. Petrus continued representing boland at school level in cricket. In 2005 he represented boland at the Coca-Cola under-18 Craven Week annual rugby tournament. Later that same year he was selected to play for the South African under 18 side. He also represented Boland at under 21 level after finishing his secondary education. His cricket career did not suffer because when it was of season for rugby Petrus still played cricket. ==Professional career== In 2009 Petrus made his first class debut for Boland. In 2010 Boland offered him a cricket South Africa contract. His contract has been renewed thus making him still a representative of Boland, making this his third year as a Boland player. In 2012 Petrus received an offer from Oundle Town Cricket Club to play and coach the club as well as to coach one of the most renowned schools in England, Oundle School. He did not disappoint Oundle Town C.C. as he set up a record of 94 wickets for the season and thus contributing to them winning the league and being promoted to the premier league. Petrus was thus named player of the season. While he is a middle order batsman he changed his bowling style from leg spinner to fast bowler making him even more fierce and attacking. In 2012 Petrus just missed the opportunity of playing for the Cobras. Despite this disappointment he was selected to represent Cricket South Africa‚Äôs Invitational team against New Zealand and Pakistan. While his career is still in the early stages he looks promising and experts predicts that he still has a lot to offer and is surely a force to be reckoned with. ==References== *Petrus Jeftha profile at CricketArchive Category:1987 births Category:Living people Category:South African cricketers Category:Boland cricketers ","title":"Petrus Jeftha"},{"id":"35300358","text":"Hemicaranx amblyrhynchus (bluntnose jack) is a tropical marine fish in the jack family (Carangidae).

As with all episodes of the first and second series of Being Human, this episode was not provided with a name when broadcast. ==Synopsis== Cold open Night scenes of a young man (Mitchell) alone with a young woman (Lauren) are intercut with parallel night scenes of a different, haunted-looking young man (George) walking alone through the woods. Mitchell and Lauren's date has ended up in her flat, but despite the seductive atmosphere Mitchell seems more interested in talking to an uncomprehending Lauren about George's situation. In subsequent intercuts, George is seen finding a suitable place in the centre of the woods, stripping naked, and then slowly and painfully transforming into a werewolf, screaming throughout the process. Mitchell reaches the end of his musing ‚Äî his eyes turn jet black, his fangs lengthen and he attacks Lauren, drinking her blood. He is a vampire. Main episode Two Bristol-based young men, George and Mitchell, have formed a friendship and desire to live in as normal and human a way as possible. As George is a werewolf and Mitchell a vampire, this is more of a challenge than usual. They move into a house together only to discover that their new home is haunted by Annie, the ghost of a previous occupant. As the three endeavour to deal with each other and develop their friendships, all three face further challenges. George must deal with the unexpected return of the girlfriend whom he abandoned once he became a werewolf (and who does not know the truth of his condition). Annie must reaccustom herself to the bravery needed to sustain new loyalties. Mitchell must deal with the imperial ambitions of the Bristol vampire clan and his recent creation of a new vampire ‚Äî Lauren. ==Cast== Main cast {  ! Actor !

Several character traits were set up which would carry over into future episodes including George's stern discipline and denial regarding his werewolf condition (as well as his own vulnerability to its broader effects) and Mitchell's balancing act between a vampiric sense of superiority, his self-disgust at his own murderous past and his tendencies toward temptation. Some differences and possible discrepancies existed between the pilot episode and the subsequent series: *The characterisation of Annie (as performed by Andrea Riseborough) and Herrick (as performed by Adrian Lester) is markedly different from the portrayals by Leonora Critchlow and Jason Watkins in the recast commissioned series broadcast the following year. *The nature of the coming vampire takeover plot is more traditional and vague than is the subtler and more structured plan of infiltration which emerges in the commissioned series. ==Conception and production background== Series creator Toby Whithouse was already an established TV writer, having already created the medical drama series Angels and written for various other series including the revived Doctor Who. He originally conceived Being Human as a non-fantasy drama about three flatmates struggling to cope with various inconvenient conditions (addiction, long-term illness and psychological problems) before realising that it would be more entertaining if adapted to a fantasy setting. Having written the Doctor Who episode School Reunion for the programme's second series (broadcast in 2006 but filmed the previous year) Whithouse was contacted by the BBC and invited to submit a pilot script for a TV show, as part of a set of pilot episodes to be made and broadcast on BBC3 with the option of possible future commissioning.\\"Toby Whithouse\\", BBC writers room, retrieved 18/4/11 Though not a fan of the television pilot process, Whithouse took a chance on submitting his concept for Being Human, reasoning that it might be the only chance of getting the show noticed and made. In 2007, Danny Cohen, the controller of BBC Three, formally commissioned the pilot of Being Human,Dowell, Ben, \\"Cohen green lights vampire comedy\\", The Guardian, 6/11/07, retrieved 16/4/11 West 10 LDN, Mrs In-Betweeny, and Phoo Action pilots as part of the rebranding of BBC Three. Even before the pilots were broadcast, Whithouse was informed that only Phoo Action would be commissioned for a series: regardless of this, Whithouse's pilot episode was broadcast on 18 February 2008. In spite of the BBC's initial commissioning decision, Being Human proved popular with viewers: however, the show might not have progressed further had not journalist Narin Bahar (of the Reading Chronicle) started an online petition to lobby BBC Three commissioning editors to greenlight a full series. The petition was signed by over 3000 people,Martin, Dan, \\"How Being Human bit back to become BBC3's biggest hit\\", The Guardian, 9/1/10, retrieved 17/4/11 and following the collapse and cancellation of the Phoo Action series in pre-production (as it was decided that the scripts for the series were not good enough),Holmwood, Leigh, \\"Phoo Action replacement will be found, says BBC3's Danny Cohen\\", The Guardian, 28/11/08, retrieved 18/4/11 Being Human was commissioned as a replacement.Dowell, Ben, \\"BBC3 orders full series of Being Human\\", The Guardian, 24/4/08, retrieved 18/4/11 ==Subsequent recasting== Russell Tovey (George) and Dylan Brown (Seth) were the only cast members from the pilot episode to renew their roles for the first full series, while the roles of Mitchell, Annie, Herrick and Lauren were all recast. This was partially due to the longer-than-usual waiting period between pilot episode and formally committed series (resulting in some of the original actors becoming unavailable) and partially due to a shift in tone for which other actors were better suited. ==References== Category:2008 British television episodes Being Human Category:Being Human (TV series) episodes Category:Television episodes written by Toby Whithouse ","title":"Pilot (Being Human)"},{"id":"35300387","text":"Prodoxus tamaulipellus is a moth of the family Prodoxidae.

As a seven-movement pasticcio, with one of the added movements composed by Georg Philipp Telemann, it is an Easter cantata known as ''''' (as it was published in the 19th century) or as Auf, mein Herz! (after the incipit of the pasticcio's first movement). ' is one of less than a dozen extant cantatas and fragments of what is known as Bach's Picander cycle, or his fourth cantata cycle. According to the first publication of the cycle's librettos, this cycle ran from 24 June 1728 (Feast of John the Baptist) to the fourth Sunday after Trinity, 10 July 1729. == History and words == No composer's autograph of the cantata is extant. The cantata is listed as Fp‚ÄëInc 6 in the Bach Repertorium of Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach (BR-CPEB).Bach Digital Work No. According to the Bach Gesellschaft edition the cantata was composed for Easter. Readings For Easter Tuesday, the readings prescribed in Bach's Leipzig were from the Acts of the Apostles, the sermon of Paul in Antiochia (), and from the Gospel of Luke, the appearance of Jesus to the Apostles in Jerusalem (). Picander's libretto for Easter Tuesday 19 April 1729 The Ich lebe, mein Herze, zu deinem Erg√∂tzen libretto for a cantata for the Third Feast-day of Easter (\\"\\") was published in Picander's 1728‚Äì29 year-cycle of cantata librettos, which was first issued starting with a cantata for an occasion some three months after Easter. If first performed according to the plan of Picander's original publication of the cycle's librettos, BWV 145 premiered on 19 April 1729. The closing chorale is the fourteenth and final stanza of Nikolaus Herman's Easter hymn \\"\\". Preceding movements a and b The five movements on Picander's text seem rather short for the purpose, therefore Alfred D√ºrr suggests that Bach might have added a sinfonia, as in two cantatas of the period, BWV 174 and 188, admitting that there is no source to substantiate it. Instead, in 19th-century manuscripts of the cantata, the five Picander movements are preceded by two movements: * BWV 145/a: a four-part setting of the first stanza of Caspar Neumann's hymn \\"\\" (ca. 1700) * BWV 145/b: the first movement from the cantata TWV 1:1350 by Georg Philipp Telemann, \\"\\", a paraphrase of . The two movements may have been added after Bach's death to make the cantata fit to be performed on Easter Sunday. Picander did not refer to the specific readings for the Third Day of Easter in his text. According to Klaus Hofmann, Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach expanded the cantata by the two additional movements in Hamburg (after 1768) and set the first movement himself. In 1787 Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach published the music of that movement as composed by his father (No. 337 in the Breitkopf edition of J. S. Bach's four-part chorales).Luke Dahn (2017) BWV 145a at According to G√ºnther Zedler this sufficiently confirms that the movement was composed by the father. According to Christoph Wolff, the cantata may have been compiled by Carl Friedrich Zelter for the Sing-Akademie zu Berlin. == Scoring and structure == The cantata is scored for three vocal soloists (soprano, tenor and bass), a four-part choir, trumpet, flauto traverso, two oboe d'amore, two violins, viola and basso continuo. # Aria (tenor, soprano): # Recitative (tenor): # Aria (bass): # Recitative (soprano): # Chorale: == Music == The first added movement is a four-part setting of the chorale stanza. The Telemann movement is in two parts, a duet and a choral fugue, with strings and instruments colla parte and a partly independent trumpet. In Telemann's cantata, it was preceded by an instrumental introduction on the same theme. The first movement on Picander's text is a duet with obbligato violin. The tenor expresses the position of Jesus \\"\\" (I live, my heart, for your pleasure), whereas the soprano answers as the believer: \\"\\" (You live, my Jesus, for my pleasure). The movement resembles duets of Bach's secular cantatas and is possibly the parody of an unknown work. It is unusual that Bach has the tenor represent the voice of Jesus. The following secco recitative ends as an arioso to stress the words \\"\\" (My heart, take note!), a thought picked up in the following bass aria, the movement with the richest instrumentation, all instruments but the viola. It has the character of a dance in even periods and may also be a parody of a secular work. The cantata is closed by a four-part setting of the last stanza of the Easter hymn \\"\\". == Recordings == * J. S.

For example, methanolamine, the parent compound of the amino alcohols, can be dehydrogenated to methanimidic acid, the parent compound of the imidic acids. :H2NCH2OH ‚Üí HNCHOH + H2 (tautomer of formamide) Geminal amino alcohols with side chains similarly form imidic acids with the same side chains: :H2NCHROH ‚Üí HNCROH + H2 Another way to form imidic acids is the reaction of carboxylic acids with azanone. For example, the reaction for carbamic acid: :H2NCOOH + HNO ‚Üí H2NCNHOH + O2 (tautomer of urea) And the general reaction for substituted imidic acids: :RCOOH + R'NO ‚Üí RCNR'OH + O2 Another mechanism is the reaction of carboxylic acids with diazene or other azo compounds, forming azanone. :RCOOH + HNNH ‚Üí RCNHOH + HNO Imidic acids tautomerize to amides by a hydrogen shift from the oxygen to the nitrogen atom. Amides are more stable in an environment with oxygen or water, whereas imidic acids dominate the equilibrium in solution with ammonia or methane. :HNCHOH ‚áå HCONH2 :RNCR'OH ‚áå R'CONHR == See also == * Imidate * Alkanolamine * Hemiaminal == References == Category:Amides Category:Functional groups ","title":"Imidic acid"},{"id":"35300448","text":"The 2011 Copa Am√©rica de Futsal was the 10th edition of the main international futsal tournament of the South America region under FIFA rules.

At the end of August 2017, with the assistance of the Israeli Ministry of Social Equality, the European Shoah Legacy Institute closed. A statement on their website reads, \\"While the work of ESLI has concluded, the Holocaust agenda continues, including above all improving the care of Holocaust survivors and other victims of Nazi persecution, deepening Holocaust education and remembrance as stated in the Terezin Declaration.ESLI may exhausted its potential, the goals of Terezin Declaration are still alive! Handout on the conclusion of activities of ESLI and what may come further Prague, 22nd August 2017 ==Background== The European Shoah Legacy Institute was created on January 20, 2010, as a follow-up to the Terezin Declaration. The Institute was incorporated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Czech Republic. The public benefit corporation cooperated with governments and non-governmental organizations to seek solutions for the restitution of immovable property, art, Judaica and Jewish cultural assets, adequate social welfare for Holocaust survivors, and the promotion of Holocaust education, research, and remembrance. The Institute served as a vehicle or catalyst for the parties already active in this field, helping them to identify and develop best practices and guidelines of work. The sphere of action of the Institute was international, involving the European Union, other European countries, as well as countries from all around the world. The Institute also worked closely with non-European states, particularly with the United States and Israel. Aside from promoting the issue of restitution or compensation for Holocaust era assets, the Institute participated in a variety of other activities dealing with the legacy of the Holocaust in all its aspects. Oversight of the Institute was conducted by an Administrative Board and monitored by a Supervisory Board. The Administrative Board was composed solely of Czech citizens, while the Supervisory board could include international representatives of partner organizations with the Institute. The Advisory Council consisted of international participants, typically experts in their fields, who served as the consulting body to the Director of ESLI. Members of the Honorary Board introduced and promoted the Institute on the highest levels of world politics. ==References * Category:Companies established in 2010 Category:Public benefit corporations Category:Art and cultural repatriation after World War II Category:Non-profit organizations based in the Czech Republic ","title":"European Shoah Legacy Institute"},{"id":"35300477","text":"James Stawpert (-1814) was a Newcastle based brewer‚Äôs clerk/songwriter of the early 19th century.

An apt metaphor for Paris at the end of the Belle √âpoque and the beginning of World War I, Guerlain's grandson and successor Jean-Paul Guerlain explains it thus: : :\\"Jacques Guerlain once said that he had a premonition of the calamity that was about to happen. ‚ÄòI couldn‚Äôt put it in words,‚Äô he told me. ‚ÄòI felt something so intense, I could only express it in a perfume.'\\"Edwards, Michael.

Interwar period: Exoticism  Shalimar (1925) Jacques Guerlain's Mitsouko, released in 1919, was the result of several hundred trials with oakmoss and the peach-smelling gamma-undecalactone. Named after the heroine of Claude Farr√®re‚Äôs novel La Bataille (1909), the perfume conveys Guerlain‚Äôs considerable Japanophilia, inspired by accounts such as Farr√®re‚Äôs of Japanese supremacy during the Russo-Japanese War.Edwards, Michael. Perfume Legends: French Feminine Fragrances. Levallois: HM √âditions, 1996.

Guerlain continued to push boundaries, the following year releasing Dj√©di (1926), referencing the magician of the Westcar Papyrus, a stylistic anomaly in Guerlain's oeuvre in that it is unusually severe.

Certain materials are ubiquitous in Guerlain‚Äôs work: high quality citruses (bergamot, citron, mandarin, sweet and bitter orange), coumarin, floral absolutes (cassie, jasmine, rose, orange blossom), green notes (galbanum), violet-smelling ionones and fine qualities of orris, vanilla and ylang-ylang. He had a fondness for aromatic spices (cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, croton, nutmeg) and certain herbes de Provence (absinthe, angelica, basil, bay leaf, caraway, coriander, cumin, tarragon).Robert, Guy. Les Sens Du Parfum. Paris: OEM, 2000. Print. He was a specialist on aromatic resins (benzoin, labdanum); indeed he used opoponax in most of his formulae, sometimes in mere trace quantities - imperceptible in and of itself though lending to the overall texture of the perfume. His base notes often consisted of strong artificial musks (musk ketone, musk ambrette, musk xylene), which he favored greatly.Domingu√®s, Thomas, Alexis Toublanc. Episode 12 ‚Äì Patte(s) Guerlain.

Les Sens Du Parfum. Paris: OEM, 2000. Print. Like Fran√ßois Coty and Ernest Daltroff, Guerlain frequently incorporated bases produced by M.

His creative process varied greatly according to the work in question; certain of his formulae are relatively short, including that of Mitsouko (1919) which lists a mere twelve materials.Guerlain, Jean-Paul. La route de mes parfums. Paris: Le Cherche Midi, 2010. Print. Others are more elaborate, sometimes incorporating previous perfumes (termed formules √† tiroir); Cuir de Russie (1935) includes among its ingredients Chypre de Paris (1909) and Mitsouko.Thomsen, Ulrik. Monsieur Guerlain. 2006. May 7, 2014. While generally methodical, Guerlain could sometimes prove impulsive; a popular rumour suggests that he emptied a sample of ethylvanillin, provided by Justin Dupont, into a flask of his uncle's Jicky (1889), thereby striking upon the initial concept for Shalimar.Edwards, Michael.

Les Sens Du Parfum. Paris: OEM, 2000. Print. In contrast to Fran√ßois Coty, Ernest Daltroff or Paul Parquet, autodidactic perfumers who revolutionised early 20th century perfumery, Jacques Guerlain distinguished himself by his shrewd discernment and wary conventionalism, no doubt informed by the weight of family heritage.Thomsen, Ulrik. Monsieur Guerlain. 2006. May 7, 2014. Marcel Billot, founding president of the French Society of Perfumers, aptly described Guerlain as \\"a genius who knew to be of his time while living nonetheless in keeping with tradition.\\"Billot, Marcel. \\"La chronique du parfumeur.\\" Parfumerie, Cosm√©tique, Savons. 7.4 Apr. 1964. For a modern generation, several of Guerlain's perfumes have become models of their genre; Shalimar (1925), though not the first oriental, is generally cited as the archetype.Turin, Luca, and Tania Sanchez. Perfumes: The Guide. New York: Viking, 2008. Print. Mitsouko (1919), according to perfumer Bertrand Duchaufour, is considered a reference chypre,Duchaufour, Bertrand. Interview.

Oct 12, 2013. Lecture. Guerlain, though never much of a pioneer, was not without his innovations. Throughout the 1930s, his use of green notes, such as galbanum, was extremely novel for the period. In this sense, perfumes such as Vol de Nuit (1933) and Sous le Vent (1933) may be considered precursory of bolder works including Paul Vacher‚Äôs Miss Dior (1947).Dove, Roja. The Essence of Perfume. London: Black Dog, 2008 Among the many perfumes composed by Guerlain, it is perhaps natural that some are easily mistakable; these are frequently subtle variations of the house's signature 'Guerlinade' rapidly devised for a specific event or celebrity.Feydeau, √âlisabeth de. Les Parfums: Histoire, Anthologie, Dictionnaire. Paris: R. Laffont, 2011. Print. Yet Guerlain's best creations, often improvements upon the work of his contemporaries, are considered unmistakable, even from the model by which they were inspired, unique in their refinement, structure and diffusion.Nicola√Ø, Patricia de. \\"Fran√ßois Coty, Jacques Guerlain.\\" Osmoth√®que, Versailles.

Ren√© Bacharach describes a lesson learned when visiting the Guerlain factory as a young perfumer; upon presenting one of his best perfumes to Jean-Pierre Guerlain, the latter politely agreed to ask the opinion of his uncle, Jacques Guerlain: : :\\"[Jean-Pierre Guerlain] returned moments later,\\" Bacharach writes, \\"saying, 'I don‚Äôt know if I should repeat my uncle's words. I warned you he's severe.' I begged him to reveal an opinion that interested me greatly. :\\"I have never had the honour of meeting Jacques Guerlain in person, but he taught me that day, without knowing it, the best of lessons, when Jean-Pierre Guerlain added, 'My uncle said, \\"It doesn‚Äôt smell.\\"'\\"Bacharach, Ren√©. \\"Une heure avec Guerlain.\\" Industrie de la Parfumerie Sept. 1948: 292.

He was a son of Margrave Dedi III and his wife, Matilda of Heinsberg, the heiress of Sommerschenburg. == Life == Conrad inherited the March of Lusatia and the County of Eilenburg when his father died in 1190. In 1207, he inherited the Counties of Groitz and Sommerschenburg from his brother Dietrich. In 1195, Emperor Henry VI dissolved the March of Meissen after the death of Margrave Albert I. This made Conrad the highest-ranking nobleman in the area, and the most senior member of the House of Wettin.Timeline on page 32 of J√ºrgen M.

In 1207, he organized a Landtag at Delitzsch Castle. Conrad died on 6 May 1210 and was buried in the Wechselburg Priory. His wife Elisabeth was buried in Dobrilugk Abbey. Since he had no male heirs, his territory passed to his cousin Theodoric I, who had been appointed Margrave of Meissen when the March of Meissen was reinstated by Emperor Otto IV in 1198. After 1210, there no longer was a separate Margrave of Lusatia.

It is considered an important pilgrimage centre by Vaishnavas. ==Legend and history== Nathdwara Shrinathji at the autumn Annakuta Festival. Pichvai-style background. Late 18th century. The Swarup or divine form of Shrinathji is said to be self-manifested. The deity of the Lord Krishna according to the legend, is self-manifested from stone and emerged from the Govardhan Hills. Historically, the image of Shrinathji was first worshipped at Govardhan hill, near Mathura. The image was initially shifted from Mathura in 1672 CE along river Yamuna and was retained at Agra for almost six months, in order to safeguard it from, according to legend, the Mughal ruler Aurangzeb, who wished to keep the prestigious deity with him in Agra. Subsequently, the image was transferred further south on a chariot to a safer place to protect it from barbaric destruction unleashed by Mughal ruler Aurangzeb. When the deity reached the spot at village Sihad or Sinhad, the wheels of bullock cart in which the deity was being transported sank axle-deep in mud and could not be moved any farther. The accompanying priests realised that the particular place was the Lord's chosen spot and accordingly, a temple was built there under the rule and protection of the then Maharana Raj Singh of Mewar. Shrinathji Temple is also known as 'Haveli of Shrinathji‚Äô (mansion). The temple was built by Goswami priests in 1672. In 1934 an order was issued by the Udaipur King (Darbar), by which, inter alia, it was declared that according to the law of Udaipur all the property dedicated or presented to or otherwise coming to the Deity Shrinathji was property of the shrine, that the Tilkayat Maharaj for the time being was merely a custodian, Manager and Trustee of the said property and that the Udaipur Darbar had absolute right to supervise that the 562 property dedicated to the shrine was used for the legitimate purposes of the shrine. Legend According to the hagiography of the Pushtimarg, Shrinathji used to travel to Mewar to play chaupar (an antecedent to Parcheesi) with a Princess by the name of Ajab Kunvari. She was upset whenever her beloved Shrinathji would go back to Vraj and asked him to stay with her in the palace. Lord Shrinathji said that one day, when the time was right, he would re-locate to Rajasthan. Presently, Shrinathji's worship is performed by direct male descendants of Vallabhacharya in a haveli (lit. palatial home) in Nathdwara, Rajasthan. Economy and livelihoods in Nathdwara town revolve around the Haveli, the term used for the temple probably because it was situated in a fortified mansion, or Haveli, once a royal palace of the Sesodia Rajput rulers of Mewar. Shrinathji was quite popular with other medieval devotees, as well, as there were preachers who founded Shrinathji temples in present-day Pakistan (Dera Ghazi Khan). This was done by Shri Lal Maharaj ji and his deity of Shri Gopi Nath ji and Shri Dau ji of Dera Ghazi Khan, earlier a part of undivided India and not far from here. Shrinathji was even worshiped as far away as Russia (in the lower Volga region) and other places on the Central Asian trade routes. ==Structure and design == The temple has been designed in the lines of Nanda Maharaj (Krishna's father) temple, in Vrindavan. Therefore, it is also known as Nanda Bhavan or Nandalaya (the House of Nanda). Structurally, a kalasha on the shikhara marks the top of the temple, on which seven flags are flown along with the Sudarshana Chakra. The seven flags represent the 7 'houses' of Pushti Marg or Vallabh Sampradaya. The temple is also popularly called Shrinathji ki Haveli (House of Shrinathji). With the mood of worship in Pushti Marg, Shrinathji is not seen as an impersonal God so the worship is not done like in a temple. Shrinathji is seen as Thakorji or Lord of the House or Haveli and Sewa (service) is offered rather than worship. Like a regular household it has a chariot for movement (In fact the original chariot in which Shrinathji was brought to Singhar), a store room for milk (Doodhghar), a store room for betel (Paanghar), a store room for sugar and sweetmeats (Mishrighar and Pedaghar), a store room for flowers (Phoolghar), a functional kitchen (Rasoighar), a jewellery chamber (Gahnaghar), a treasury (Kharcha bhandaar), a stable for horses of chariot (Ashvashala), a drawing room (Baithak), a gold and silver grinding wheel (Chakki). The Nathdwara temple has subsidiary temples dedicated to deity Madan Mohan and Naveet Priya, located in the main complex. ==Image of Shrinathji== Shrinathji symbolizes a form of Krishna, when he lifted the Govardhan hill, with one arm raised. The image is in the form of a single black marble, where the lord is revealed with his left hand raised and the right hand made into a fist resting at the waist, with a large diamond placed beneath the lips. The deity is carved in bas-relief out of a monolithic black marble stone, with images of two cows, one lion, one snake, two peacocks and one parrot engraved on it and three sages placed near it. The iconography at the temple has given birth to Nathdwara Paintings. ==Festivals and rituals == Devotees throng to the shrine in large numbers during occasions of Janmashtami and other festivals, like Holi and Diwali. The deity is treated like a living image, and is attended with daily normal functions, like bathing, dressing, meals called \\"bhog\\" and the resting times in regular intervals. Since the deity is believed to be the infant Krishna, accordingly, special care is taken. The priests in all Havelis are Brahmins under Gurus who are the kul (descendants) of Vallabhacharya, the founder of this deity's image at Govardhan hill, near Mathura. The main attractions are the Aartis and the Shringar, i.e. the dressing and beautifying of the deity of Shrinathji, which is changed seven times daily, treating it as a living person, adorning it with the appropriate dresses for the time of day or night. The intricately woven shaneels and silk cloth have original zari and embroidery work on them, along with large quantities of real precious jewellery. The formal prayers are offered with diya, incense sticks, flowers, fruit and other offerings, with local instruments and devotional songs of the Shrinathji, according to the demand of the time and occasion. The view of the deity after the parda (curtain) is removed is called jhakhi.  Coronavirus Effect  Due to Coronavirus disease 2019, authorities have decided to reduce \\"Darshan Timings\\" to 4 times from 8 times. They also decided to allow only 50 people at once for Darshan. ==References *Official website Category:Hindu temples in Rajasthan Category:Tourist attractions in Rajsamand district Category:Krishna Category:Nathdwara ","title":"Shrinathji Temple"},{"id":"35300776","text":"In Roman Catholic theology, Sententia fidei proxima refers to teachings, which are generally accepted as divine revelation but not defined as such by the Magisterium.Fundamentals of Catholic dogma b Ludwig Ott, 1964, Herder, ASIN: B002BZOUAI page 9 These are below the Fides ecclesiastica level, but above Sententia certa.

He was one of a family of 12 and the son of Helen Grant Rattray and James Henry Pope (a future Government inspector of native schools and founder of the native school system). He attended Caversham District School and on 12 August 1881 left Dunedin aboard the PenguinOtago Daily Times, 12 August 1881 arriving in Wellington where he entered Wellington College.Letter to the Editor, Robert J. Pope, Evening Post, 4 May 1931 After school, Pope passed junior Civil Service Examinations in 1888, New Zealand University Examinations in 1889 and Teacher‚Äôs Examinations in the early 1890s. He lived in various parts of the lower and central North Island and began working as a teacher. He married Ernestina Victoria Pullar in Wellington on 29 December 1896. The couple had three children: Robert Earle Pope, Flora Pope and Eileen Fortune (n√©e Pope). Eileen married Reo Fortune (1903‚Äì79), a well-known anthropologist at Cambridge University in England. In all, Pope worked for the Wellington Education Board for 37 years as teacher and headmaster. He began his teaching at Te Aute College, Hawke‚Äôs Bay, and then became a master at the first school in Levin. He moved from Levin Public School to Featherston as an assistant teacher there and was next an assistant teacher at Newtown School in Wellington. He then became a headmaster at Kaiwaiwai School in the Wairarapa and after headmaster of Kaiwarra School in Wellington for 20 years. After a fire destroyed his original residence near Kaiwarra School in 1911, he lived in various suburbs of Wellington.Northern Advocate, 31 July 1911 Pope retired from Kaiwarra School in December 1925. As a young man Pope was an able cricketer and an opening batsman for the Star Club‚Äôs Pearce Cup winning team of the early 1880s, where he played with well-known cricketers of the period such as the slow bowler Charlie Dryden. Some members of Pope‚Äôs team were also fathers of future All Black footballers.‚ÄòCricket Feats Recalled‚Äô, Robert J.

This suggests his birth date could be 1862 or 1863. An obituary appeared for him in the Evening Post, 12 April 1949 stating he died ‚Äòin his 87th year‚Äô. == Literary output == Pope published two poetry collections in his lifetime, both late in his life: Some New Zealand Lyrics (1928) and A New Zealander's Fancies in Verse (1946). The latter collection contains a good deal of Pope's light verse written in a more modern style to the earlier Romantic and colonial lyrics of his first book. Notably his verse covers the two world wars (including a poem tribute to Wellington cricketer and headmaster J. P. Firth who lost many of his students during the Great War). Pope's Some New Zealand Lyrics was reviewed in the Evening Post, 11 July 1928.

It was directed by David Barrett. ==Plot== Elena (Nina Dobrev) is trapped in her car while a mysterious figure approaches. She screams and suddenly the stranger runs away as Damon (Ian Somerhalder) appears and gets her free. Damon asks her if she is fine. Elena says: \\"I look like her\\" and faints. Damon picks her up and goes to his car. Alaric (Matt Davis) stares at a picture of his wife Isobel (Mia Kirshner) as he remembers moments he lived with her. He knows that there is evil in Mystic Falls and that he was right to come here. He later meets Jeremy (Steven R. McQueen) at the school's parking lot. Jeremy informs him that he found a journal from the 1800s, something that seems to be interested in. Elena wakes up in Damon's car wandering what happened and where they are. Damon takes her with him to Georgia and despite Elena's demands to take her back to Mystic Falls he declines and pulls over. Elena's phone rings, Damon answers it and it is Stefan (Paul Wesley) who worries about her especially since she does not have her vervain necklace anymore. Elena does not want to talk to him and Damon hangs up on him. He promises Elena he will not compel her and she agrees to continue traveling with him. Stefan finds Bonnie (Kat Graham) and asks her to help him find Elena. He gives her Elena's necklace to make a spell but when she tries nothing happens. She leaves and goes to her grandmother (Jasmine Guy) to ask her why she does not have her powers anymore. Her grandmother tells her that she has to face what scared her, so Bonnie leaves and goes to the Fell's Church where Emily destroyed the crystal. Damon and Elena arrive at a bar where Damon is old friends with the owner, Bree (Gina Torres). Bree is a witch and Damon came to ask her help so he can bring Katherine back. They all have fun and drink and at one moment Elena goes outside to call Jenna (Sara Canning) and inform her that she is fine and that she slept at Bonnie's. Inside the bar, Damon finally tells Bree what he wants and she tells him that he needs the crystal to open the tomb. Damon does not have the crystal and wants to know if they can use a different spell but to do that, the witch has to be blood related to Emily. Jeremy is at the school's library looking for information about his paper when he meets Anna (Malese Jow). The two of them start talking and Anna helps him find more information. She also tells him that she also has an old journal and she believes that the stories about vampires are real after the stories her grandfather told her. Jeremy does not believe in vampires and tries to convince her that those stories are just fiction. Stefan calls Elena who is still angry and demands to know how she is connected to Katherine. Stefan tells her that he does not know while Damon overhears the conversation and appears next to Elena when she hangs up the phone. Bree takes the opportunity of Damon being outside and calls someone to let them know that Damon is there. Bonnie gets to the Fell's Church but while she is looking around, she falls into a hole in the ground, inside the tomb. At the same time, Stefan goes to Bonnie's grandmother's house and asks for her. Grams Sheila senses that he is a vampire after touching his hand and knowing that she can trust him, she tells him that he knows where to find Bonnie. Stefan goes to Fell's Church, finds Bonnie and gets her out of the tomb. While being in the tomb, Bonnie was hearing noises coming behind a door with a pentagram drawn on it, something that tells Stefan about. He assures her that while the vampires are still barely alive, they are weak and desiccated and locked away safely. Stefan brings Bonnie back home and safe and Sheila thanks him. The two of them seem to know each other from some years ago. Back at the bar, a mysterious figure walks in and exchanges a look with Bree. Elena walks outside once again to answer her phone, when a man grabs her and drags her away. Damon notices her absence and goes out to look for her. He sees Elena but when he tries to help her, the man beats him with a baseball bat and starts dousing him with gasoline. Elena tries to save Damon's life while the man (Brandon Quinn) tells her that Damon killed his girlfriend, Lexi. Elena manages to convince him not to kill Damon and the man runs away. Damon, before he travels back to Mystic Falls, confronts Bree and he is pissed because she betrayed him and set him up. Bree explains that she did it because Lexi was her friend and warns him that her blood is full of vervain but she is still scared of him. In an attempt to save her life, she tells him that Emily's spell book holds the secret to reverse the spell. He apologizes and then rips her heart out. Elena and Damon are back to Mystic Falls and Elena finally talks to Stefan asking him the truth and if he was with her because of her resemblance to Katherine. Stefan explains that she is nothing like Katherine and he noticed that before they even met. He reveals to her that he was there the night she had the accident with her parents and that he was the one who saved her. He tried to save her parents as well but it was too late. Since then he began watching her to be sure that she was not Katherine and he figured out how different she was from her. Elena is shocked but she keeps wondering why the two of them look so much alike and if they are related. Stefan explains that he was wondering the same thing and that her last name (Gilbert) confused him because Katherine's was different (Pierce). He then discovered that Elena is adopted but he did not want to start asking people about Katherine's family because it was dangerous. Elena gets back home and is mad at Jenna for never telling her she was adopted. Jenna is shocked and tries to explain that she promised not to tell but Elena does not want to hear her. The episode ends with Alaric sitting at the bar. He remembers the night his wife died, when he got into the room and saw a vampire drinking from her. He recognizes that vampire to the one who is sitting few feet away from him; Damon. ==Featured music== \\"Bloodlines\\" features the songs: *\\"Nothing Is Logical\\" by The Bell *\\"Out of the Blue\\" by Julian Casablancas *\\"Only One\\" by Alex Band *\\"Look Inside\\" by The Dig *\\"The Night Before\\" by The Stereotypes *\\"Pepper Spray\\" by The Upsidedown *\\"Push\\" by The Steps *\\"Trouble\\" by Hope Sandoval & the Warm Inventions *\\"Can't Stop These Tears (From Falling)\\" by The Black Hollies *\\"Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea\\" by Black Mustang *\\"On a Mission\\" by The Dandelions *\\"An End Has a Start\\" by Editors *\\"Cosmic Love\\" by Florence and the Machine ==Reception== Ratings In its original American broadcast, \\"Bloodlines\\" was watched by 3.68 million, up by 0.11 from the previous episode.

These ponds form a vital buffer zone between terrestrial and marine ecosystems. Contaminants such as sediment, nitrates and phosphates are filtered out by salt ponds before they can reach the ocean. The depth, salinity and overall chemistry of these dynamic salt ponds fluctuate depending on temperature, rainfall, and anthropogenic influences such as nutrient runoff. The flora and fauna of tropical salt ponds differ markedly from those of temperate ponds. Mangrove trees are the dominant vegetation of tropical salt pond ecosystems, which also serve as vital feeding and breeding grounds for shore birds. ==Formation and cycle== Tropical salt ponds form as bays are gradually closed off with berms of rubble from the reef. Mangroves grow atop the berms, which gradually close off the area to create a salt pond.Jarecki, L. 1999. A review of salt pond ecosystems. In Proceedings of the Nonpoint Source Pollution Symposium. University of the Virgin Islands, Eastern Caribbean Center, St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands. These typically form at the base of watersheds with steep slopes, as sediments transported during storm events begin to fill in and cover up the rubble berm. Mangroves may grow over the berm, also contributing to the isolation of the salt pond. Typically, the ponds communicate with the open sea through ground seepage. Evaporation and precipitation cycles in salt ponds create variable environments with wide ranges of salinity and depth. Due to depth and temperature fluctuation salt pond could be classified as hyposaline 3-20 ppt, mesosaline 20-50 ppt, or hypersaline with ppt greater than 50. Another important aspect of salt ponds is their permanence.Williams, W.D. 1998. Salinity as a determinant of the structure of biological communities in salt lakes. ‚Äò‚ÄôHydrobiologica‚Äô‚Äô 381: 191-201. Salt ponds can eventually become filled in over time, and transition into an extension of the land.Gagemi, A. 2003. Ecological Assessment of Salt Ponds on St. John, USVI. Thesis (M.Eng.)--Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Dept. of Civil and Environmental Engineering. Some are intermittent ponds due to predictable dry and wet seasons while others are episodic (if the region has highly unpredictable weather).Hall, K. & K. KellerLynn. 2010. Virgin Islands National Park: geologic resources inventory report. Natural Resource Report NPS/NRPC/GRD/NRR‚Äî2010/226. National Park Service, Fort Collins, Colorado. ==Flora and fauna== Organisms typically found in and around tropical salt ponds include cyanobacteria, marine invertebrates, birds, algae and mangrove trees. For example, a typical Caribbean salt pond is the permanent or part- time home to the following: Microorganisms * Bacteria, especially cyanobacteria such as ** Coccochloris stagnina ** Microcoleus chthonoplastes ** Oscillatoria ** Phormidium * Ciliates Invertebrate animals * Rotatoria (rotifers) * Worms including ** Nematoda (round worms) ** Polychaeta (segmented worms) * Cnidaria (cnidarians) * Gastropoda (snails and clams) * Crustacea ** Cladocera (water fleas) ** Ostracoda (seed shrimp) ** Copepoda (copepods) ** Anostraca (brine shrimp), especially Artemia ** Decapoda (crabs) such as Ocypodidae (fiddler crab) * Insecta (insects) such as ** Ephydridae (brine fly) ** Corixidae (water boatmen) Vertebrate animals * Fish such as mullet (Mugil) * Birds such as ** Yellow Legs (Tringa spp.) ** Black Necked Stilts (Himantopus mexicanus) ** Wilson‚Äôs Plovers (Charadrius wilsonia) ** Pin Tail Ducks (Anas bahamensis) * Bats Plants * Algae such as Enteromorpha * Vascular plants ** Ruppia grass ** Mangrove trees ==Salt pond mangroves== There are 110 species of mangroves found worldwide all with special adaptations that allow for them to inhabit salt ponds. Mangroves are often found near or around salt ponds because of their ability to exist in an ecosystem with high salinity, low dissolved oxygen levels, brackish water, and extreme temperatures. Mangroves‚Äô unique prop roots function as a barrier to the salt water, limiting water loss, and acting as a snorkel for oxygen and nutrients. Mangroves seeds have also evolved to be buoyant and germinate while still attached to the parent increasing the chance of survival in difficult environments. The presence of mangroves augments and helps maintain many of the benefits provided by salt ponds, such as:Lugo, A.E.. & S.C. Snedaker 1974. The Ecology of Mangroves. ‚Äò‚ÄôAnnual Review of Ecology and Systematics‚Äô‚Äô 3: 39-64. * Mangrove salt ponds provide habitat for migratory species and critical nursery habitat for threatened and endangered species. * Mangrove trees filter run off from upland sources. * Mangrove trees absorb wave energy during tropical storms * Mangrove trees provide a source of nutrients via leaf litter * Mangrove trees hold in soil loads during periods of fierce precipitation Caribbean salt ponds commonly host three types of mangroves: * Rhizophora mangle (red mangroves) are very common around salt ponds and are tremendous at dissipating wave energy and providing habitat for developmental organisms due to their large prop roots. * Avicennia germinans (black mangrove) is easily identifiable by numerous finger like projections, called pneumatophores, allowing them to tolerate high sediment loads. * Laguncularia racemosa (white mangrove) is dissimilar to red and black mangroves in that it lacks prop roots and pneumatophores but is easily identifiable due to its very round leaves and small wrinkled propagules. ==Ecosystem services== Salt ponds provide a number of important ecosystem services. Protection from sediment and storms Salt ponds act as natural sediment traps that limit the amount of sedimentation and pollutants that would otherwise end up in the ocean, potentially harming other ecosystems. Salt ponds are home to dense benthic mats of bacteria which also trap nutrients such as nitrogen that otherwise would greatly contribute to detrimental marine eutrophication. Coral reefs are particularly vulnerable to sedimentation, siltation, and eutrophication processes.Smith, T., et al. 2008. Assessing coral reef health across onshore to offshore stress gradients in the US Virgin Islands. ‚Äò‚ÄôMarine pollution bulletin‚Äô‚Äô 56: 1983-1991. Salt ponds and their mangrove systems act as a buffer from storm surges associated with hurricanes and greatly dissipate wave energy that could cause erosion, including even large, rare waves such as tsunamis.Division and Fish and Wildlife. 2005. United States Virgin Islands marine resources and fisheries strategic and comprehensive conservation plan. Department of Planning and Natural Resources, U.S. Virgin Islands. Products of salt ponds In addition to these ecosystem services, salt ponds also produce a variety of useful products. Artemia, one of the primary food organisms for aquaculture systems, are cultured in salt ponds. Halophilic green algae can also be cultured in salt ponds to produce glycerol, dried protein that can be fed to livestock, and Œ≤‚Äìcarotene used in dietary supplements. Spirulina is a salt-loving cyanobacterium with a protein content even higher than meat (60%), and it can be cultured in salt ponds. Other halophilic bacteria can be used to produce components used in highly technological processes. Photosynthetic pigment found in Halobacterium halobium is produced commercially and used for optical data processing, non- linear optics and as light sensors. Halophilic bacteria could also be used to produce polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) which are biodegradable, water resistant thermoplastics. ==Threats== Both anthropogenic and natural threats affect tropical salt ponds. Natural threats Natural threats include hurricanes and other large storms, salinity changes, runoff, sedimentation, and grazing and predation. Hurricanes and other large storms can damage salt pond organisms as well as cause seawater overwash, leading to potentially detrimental salinity changes and physical damage. Salinity may also be reduced by precipitation, which can alter community composition by restricting the number and type of species adapted for these conditions. Furthermore, increased evapotranspiration can increase salinity and diminish species diversity. Local conditions, such as annual rainfall and slope aspect, can determine runoff amounts. Influxes of runoff can cause sediment deposition in salt ponds, eventually causing infill of the pond to occur. Natural grazing and predation around salt ponds can trample vegetation, increase local erosion, and introduce nutrients to the ecosystem. Anthropogenic threats Anthropogenic threats to salt ponds include development and altered hydrology, pollution, erosion, and livestock and agricultural operations. Salt ponds may be filled, dredged, or removed for marinas, harbors, buildings, or other uses. Construction in upland areas also affects salt ponds by causing increased erosion and sedimentation.Gray, S., K. Gobbi & P. Narwold. 2008. Comparison of sedimentation in bays and reefs below developed versus undeveloped watersheds on St. John, US Virgin Islands. Proceedings of the 11th International Coral Reef Symposium, Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, 7‚Äì11 July 2008, Session number 10.379, p. 374 Pollution is also a major threat to salt ponds. These areas are frequent dumping sites for trash, wastewater, and solid waste. Livestock grazing can not only increase erosion through soil compaction and deforestation, but also introduces fertilizers. Agriculture can also introduce fertilizers and pesticides, causing algal blooms and reduced water quality. Anthropogenic activities, such as fossil fuel burning, can cause increased global temperatures and could lead to the drying of salt ponds. As many of the biological functions of salt ponds are unknown, it would be wise to mitigate potential human impact on these vulnerable ecosystems. ==References== Category:Aquatic biomes Category:Terrestrial biomes Category:Aquatic ecology Category:Mangrove ecoregions Category:Mangroves Category:Ecosystems ","title":"Tropical salt pond ecosystem"},{"id":"35300847","text":"The Opel RAK e is an electric two seat city concept car, which was produced by the German car manufacturer, Opel.

The period horror-romance is based on the folklore of Arang, who died unjustly and returns as a ghost in order to reveal the circumstances surrounding her death. It aired on MBC from August 15 to October 18, 2012 on Wednesdays and Thursdays at 21:55 for 20 episodes. ==Synopsis== A nobleman named Kim Eun-oh (Lee Joon-gi) comes to town searching for his mother after hearing a rumor that she is staying at the village of Miryang. He has the special ability to hear, see and touch spirits, but pretends he doesn't because he gets annoyed when they pester him to help them. A-rang (Shin Min- ah) lost all her memories when she became a ghost and is unable to rest in peace until she finds out how she died. After appearing to three magistrates, none of them survive the fright of seeing her. Some local officials, desperate over the fact that no one wanted to take up the position for so long, coerce Eun-oh into becoming the new magistrate. When she finds out that Eun-oh is able to see her and that he appointed as the new magistrate, she begs for his help. At first, Eun-oh rejects her request. However, he changes his mind after seeing that A-rang somehow has a distinctive hairpin that he gave his mother at their last meeting. He believes that if he helps her, Arang will regain her memories and give him information about his mother. He exasperatedly (then affectionately) nicknames her ‚ÄúAmnesia‚Äù. As the town's newly installed magistrate, he teams up with her to investigate the circumstances surrounding her death, which may involve the mysterious nobleman Joo-wal. Along the way, they must prevent Arang from being captured by Mu-young, the leader of the local grim reapers. Eun-oh also uncovers a long history of corruption by a local nobleman and decides to use his new position as magistrate to bring justice and order. Arang and Eun-oh's actions, meanwhile, are being tracked by the Jade Emperor and Yeom-ra themselves, who fear that events in Miryang are much more horrifying than they appear. ==Cast== *Lee Joon-gi as Kim Eun-oh *Shin Min-ah as A-rang/Lee Seo-rim *Yeon Woo-jin as Joo-wal *Hwang Bo-ra as Bang-wool, shaman *Kwon Oh-joong as Dol-swe, Eun-oh's manservant *Han Jung-soo as Mu-young, head ghost reaper *Kang Moon-young as Lady Seo, Eun-oh's mother *Kim Yong-gun as Lord Choi *Yoo Seung-ho as Jade Emperor, King of Heaven *Park Jun-gyu as Yama, King of the Underworld *Kim Kwang-kyu as Lee Bang *Lee Sang- hoon as Hyung Bang *Min Sung-wook as Ye Bang *Kim Min-jae as Geo Deol *Song Jae-ryong as Kim Seo-bang *Noh Hee-ji as heavenly fairy *Lee Yong-yi as Lee Seo-rim's housekeeper *Lim Ju-eun as Mu-yeon *Yoon Joo-sang as Lord Kim, Eun- oh's father *Yoon Do-hyun as former magistrate of Miryang (cameo, ep 1) *Jung Soo-young as Bang-wool's client (cameo, ep 1) *Im Hyun-sik as ghost (cameo, ep 2) *Jeong Bo-seok as teacher (cameo, ep 14) *Lee Sung-min as gatekeeper (cameo, ep 20) *Song Won Seok as Seok a Chugi (Angels of Death) ==Background== The drama is based on famous folklore, as most ghost stories are: During the Joseon era in the city of Miryang, Arang was the pure, beautiful, goodhearted daughter of a magistrate. She grew up without a mother and was raised by a wicked caretaker who conspired to have her raped and ruined by a servant, Baekga. He attacked and she resisted, so he stabbed and killed her, and left her body to rot in the woods. Her father, the magistrate, just believed that she dishonorably eloped with a man and so resigned his position swathed in shame. Thus the legend goes that every time a new magistrate comes to Miryang to fill the position, Arang's vengeful ghost shows up to tell him her story and he flees in terror. But one day a new magistrate comes to town ‚Äî a young man by the name of Lee Sang-sa. Arang appears to him like every other magistrate before him, but this man doesn't flee, and instead sympathizes with Arang, and promises to find her killer and avenge her death. Lee Sang-sa has Baekga seized and executed, and thereafter, Arang's spirit ceased to trouble the town. ==Production== It was Lee Joon-gi's comeback acting project after being discharged from military service in February 2012. This also marked the first historical drama for Shin Min-ah and return to television since My Girlfriend Is a Nine-Tailed Fox in 2010. The series was filmed at MBC Dramia in Gyeonggi Province. The first behind-the-scene photos were released on show of June 22, 2012, filming scenes shot on location in Namyangju on May 23. This was followed by more teaser photos released on July 11, 2012, showing action scenes and an intimate scene of the two leads, Lee and Shin laying down together. Ahead of the series' premiere, MBC aired the special episode How to Enjoy Arang and the Magistrate 100 Times More on August 8, 2012. It included never-before-seen clips, special behind-the-scenes stories, and detailed the characters and their relationships. It was the first drama special produced by MBC in five years since The Legend in 2007. The drama's rights was sold to Japan for a record-breaking per episode, which amounts to for the 20-episode series, the highest per episode for MBC, surpassing the previous record set by Moon Embracing the Sun. ==Original soundtrack== {  style=\\"width: 700px;\\" - ! width=300pxAlbum !!

The London event was moved to Regent's Park in 2005, where it has remained since. The show was named Best Consumer Show at the 2012 Exhibition News Awards. A second London-based event runs later in the year, entitled the festive edition of Taste of London. It runs on similar principles to the main Taste of London event, with a greater focus on festive shopping alongside restaurants and live demonstrations. As of 2016, the festive edition of Taste of London is held at Tobacco Docks, London. Taste of Edinburgh was first run in 2007, initially at The Meadows, but after two years moved to Inverleith Park.

Things moved fast, and on 5 October 1990, AWE and Opel together opened an assembly line for the Opel Vectra.20 Jahre Opel Eisenach, aufgerufen am 17. September 2012 Guests at the accompanying celebrations included Helmut Kohl,Geschichte Eisenachs ab 1990 , accessed on 19 September 2012 who two days earlier had become the first Chancellor of a newly reunified Germany. A further agreement was signed on 13 December 1990, this time between Treuhand president Detlev Rohwedder, Opel Chairman Louis R. Hughes and (AWE) directors, for the purchase of land in the Gries business park, to the west of the Wartburgstadt, where a new car assembly plant could be built. A foundation stone for the new plant was laid on 7 February 1991 and, once the roof was on the building, a \\"Topping out\\" ceremony was held on 9 September 1991. At the same time the existing (AWE) plant was closed and production there of the Wartburg 1.3 (a short-lived re-engined version of the Wartburg 353) was ended. Construction of the new Eisenach plant involved Opel in an investment of about a Million Marks. Production started on September, 23rd 1992 at the Eisenach Opel plant, with the Opel Corsa and Opel Astra models. Employing just 1,900 people at this time, the facility was described as the most successful and productive auto- plant in Europe. The introduction of a third shift on 4 October 1993 marked the end of the plant's start-up phase. On 16 October 1996 Eisenach notched up production of half a million Opels, and the millionth car came off the line on 16 November 1999. The well publicized bankruptcy of General Motors, its parent company, placed Opel's future ownership and indeed its survival in question for several months during 2009, and this also impacted the Eisenach facility where, at times, production was halted.Lieberknecht zu Gespr√§chen bei Adam Opel GmbH, accessed on 17.

Three years after √âmile, his mother gave birth to a daughter, Julia Mathilde Chambon, who went on to assist √âmile throughout her life, following and supporting him, carefully noting in her diary the agenda and activities of her brother up until his death in October 1993. In the autumn of 1921, Chambon entered the √âcole des Beaux-Arts de Gen√®ve. A first federal grant was awarded to him that year and enabled him to undertake a journey to Paris. This stay allowed him to become familiar with the Cubist painters, who did not however find favour in his eyes ‚Äì apart from Roger de La Fresnaye ‚Äì as, in his opinion, they simply imitated African art without being able to render the latter's originality. During the period from 1925 to 1928, he worked with the painter Jean-Louis Gampert, La Fresnaye's friend; he assisted him in his atelier and also in the realisation of the decor for the Corsier church (Geneva).  Recognition and fulfilment (1928-1950)  In 1928 he received a second federal grant that allowed him a second journey to Paris; he stayed there for almost ten weeks. He discovered the Mus√©e du Louvre where he made numerous copies, essentially in the form of drawings, from Rembrandt, Rubens and G√©ricault. He also visited the Mus√©e Guimet, Petit-Palais and the great monuments of Paris. The end of the 1930s saw a remarkable increase in Chambon's output of canvases. He almost doubled his level of production compared to the beginning of the decade; this rhythm remained steady until the end of the 1960s. Chambon's father died in February 1946 and his passing severely affected Emile's health; he had always maintained a very strong relationship with his father and would only partially recover from this loss.  Maturity (1950-1979)  From the beginning of the 1950s, Chambon's oeuvre became increasingly popular in Switzerland; Chambon exhibited at a considerable number of collective exhibitions, most of which were in the German part of Switzerland. The publication, in December 1957, of a first monograph on Chambon, further contributed to more fully establishing his artistic reputation. The monograph was written by Edouard Muller-Moor and published by Editions Cailler in their 'Painters and Sculptors of Yesterday and Today' collection. In 1961 in Geneva, he met, through one of their mutual friends, the writer Louise de Vilmorin, who immediately admired the artist's work and took a liking to him. On 10 May 1962, at De Vilmorin's instigation, the vernissage of a major Chambon exhibition took place at the Galerie Motte in Paris. De Vilmorin also wrote the laudatory preface in the accompanying catalogue presenting the works. 1965 firmly established the painter and his collection, for he participated in the K√ºnstler, Sammler exhibition at Aargauer Kunsthaus, along with a new collective presentation of works by Swiss artists entitled Pittura Contemporanea Svizzera at the villa Olma on the banks of Lake Como. From 1977 on, Chambon's output of paintings diminished and he mainly dedicated himself to drawing. He also had a few health problems and was not able, to his great regret, to attend the vernissage of the major Courbet retrospective organised in July at the Mus√©e d'Ornans on the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the painter's death.  Towards posterity (1979-1993)  In the later years of his life, Chambon's thoughts were mainly taken up with the perpetuation of his oeuvre. In February 1980 he met the director of the future Carouge Museum with a view to a donation that he wished to make to the institution. Two years later, the painter donated eight large paintings to the museum. Meanwhile, in October 1981, he gave away a large part of his collections ‚Äì nearly eight hundred pieces of African and Oceanic art \\\\- to the Ethnographic Museum in Geneva. During this period, Chambon retouched or reworked some works that he had done several decades earlier, deeming them unfinished. The Foundation Emile Chambon finally came into being two years after Emile Chambon's death on 28 October 1993 at Collonge-Bellerive. == Works in public institutions == * La Blouse blanche, 1926, Mus√©e d‚ÄôArt et d‚ÄôHistoire, Fribourg * Le Peintre et son mod√®le, 1934, Mus√©e d‚ÄôArt et d‚ÄôHistoire, Fribourg * Prise du drapeau du ¬´ Front National ¬ª par la police de L√©on Nicole, le 1er juin 1935, 1935, Mus√©e d‚ÄôArt et d‚ÄôHistoire, Geneva * L'Enterrement de premi√®re classe, 1938, Kunsthaus Zurich, Zurich * Femme √† la toilette (Orientale), 1941, Mus√©e d‚ÄôArt et d‚ÄôHistoire, Neuch√¢tel * L‚ÄôEau, le Gaz et l‚Äô√âlectricit√©, 1943, Services industriels de Gen√®ve, usine de Verbois (Geneva) * La Maison du pasteur, 1945, Mus√©e d‚ÄôArt et d‚ÄôHistoire, Geneva * La Charit√©, 1946, Vitromus√©e, Romont * La Chemin√©e, 1948-1964, Cantonal Museum of Fine Arts, Lausanne * Le Salon de Cologny, 1948-1964, Mus√©e d‚ÄôArt et d‚ÄôHistoire, Geneva * Jeune fille au narcisse, 1949, Kunstmuseum Winterthur,Winterthur * Conversation (le couple), 1950, Primavera Gallery, New York * Le Cauchemar, 1950, Primavera Gallery, New York * Hommage √† Courbet, 1952, Aargauer Kunsthaus, Aarau * L‚ÄôIndiscret, 1956, Primavera Gallery, New York * La Justice, 1957, tapisserie r√©alis√©e d‚Äôapr√®s un carton d‚ÄôEmile Chambon, Fonds cantonal d‚Äôart contemporain, Geneva * Jeune fille aux mouettes (Marina Doria), 1957-1961, Mus√©e de Carouge * Harpe du Soudan, 1960, Aargauer Kunsthaus, Aarau * Pygmalion, 1961, Mus√©e d‚ÄôArt et d‚ÄôHistoire, Geneva * Psych√© et l‚ÄôAmour, 1962, Mus√©e d‚ÄôArt et d‚ÄôHistoire, Geneva * Jeune fille aux pens√©es, 1966, Fonds cantonal d‚Äôart contemporain, Geneva ==References== * E.

The first season of the show premiered on 6 May 2012 and marked the television debut of popular Bollywood actor and filmmaker Aamir Khan. The second season of the show was aired from 2 March 2014 and the third season started from 5 October 2014. The show focuses on sensitive social issues prevalent in India such as female foeticide, child sexual abuse, rape, honour killings, domestic violence, untouchability, alcoholism, and the criminalization of politics. It aims to bring the great achievements of people which often go unnoticed in order to encourage the audience to achieve their goals no matter what comes in between. It also aims to empower citizens with information about their country, and urge them to take action. While the primary language of the show is Hindi, it is simulcast in eight languages such as Bengali, Malayalam, Marathi, Tamil and Telugu, and subtitled in English, to ensure maximum reach. The first season of Satyamev Jayate garnered over a billion digital impressions from 165 countries, with responses from viewers in many countries, mainly Asian and African countries, including India, China, Djibouti, Seychelles, Sierra Leone, Isle of Man, and Papua New Guinea. A sum of was received as donations by the NGOs featured on this season. The second season was watched by 600 million Indians. The causes raised in the second season were supported by over 30million people and the season generated more than one billion impressions online. ==Production== Concept The concept of the show was not revealed in the Indian media until the show officially went on air on 6 May 2012. There were also no get-togethers, parties or press conferences organized to discuss the content, leading up to the premiere of the show. However, various sources reported the show to be based on \\"the common man\\" rather than being fictional. Also, based on its content, it was mostly referred as a talk show discussing social issues like child labour, health problems and other issues affecting the country. Khan, who is known for keeping secrecy for his movies, was quoted saying, \\"I don\`t want to talk much about how the show will be, and about its format. I want everyone to see it directly on TV.\\" However, commenting on the theme of the show, he said, \\"The show is about meeting the common man of India, connecting with India and its people.\\" He also added, \\"Through this show we understand the problem of the people, we are not here to make a change. I am no one to change anything. I don\`t think I am in the position to change anything else. I feel understanding a problem and feeling it or holding one's hand or hugging is also important. I may not have the solution, but at least I can hear and understand.\\" Development Uday Shankar, CEO of STAR India, suggested Aamir Khan to venture into television. Khan, however, was hesitant at first but agreed and worked upon the concept of the show for two years. In an interview with Zee News, he said, \\"Initially I was scared to do the show as we were travelling on a different path. I was worried. It was in a way difficult, but we knew what we are doing is different, but it comes straight from our heart.\\" He also added, \\"I cannot say I understand TV completely. I was earlier scared to go ahead with the project. I can only say I have made this show with complete honesty and without compromising on anything.\\" The shooting of the show took place in several states of India and Khan traveled extensively over several weeks to various places in Rajasthan, Kashmir, Kerala, Delhi, Punjab, and in the North-East. The studio portions of the show were shot in Vrundavan Studio and Yash Raj Studios in Mumbai. Khan was adamant about naming the show 'Satyameva Jayate' as he felt it completely gelled with the theme, which indicated that the show is of, for and belongs to people of India. However, Khan later learnt the fact that the title 'Satyameva Jayate' belonged to the country and cannot be registered for the copyrights as it cannot be exploited on a creative level for promotional activities. The team however went ahead and borrowed the title. Soundtrack Aamir Khan came up with the idea of launching a music album for the show. He along with Ram Sampath, the music director of Delhi Belly, created 13 songs for the 13 episodes that were telecast in the inaugural season of the show. In addition, the songs from the album of the show were released digitally every week on Hungama.com and also across all mobile operators as the series proceeds. The album was also released in Malayalam, Tamil, Telugu and Kannada. Sukhwinder Singh recorded a 22-minute-long song for the show which was written by Prasoon Joshi. On the song, Sukhwinder Singh said, \\"Yes, I Nishit Mehta, Swaroop Khan and many more have sung a song which will be used in the title track and some will be incorporated in the show. It is a dream song; it is a song which will reflect humanity and nationality.\\" Season 1 Season 2 Season 3 Controversy Palash Sen, the lead singer of the Indian rock band Euphoria sued and sent a legal notice to Ram Sampath, for plagiarism of the title track of the show. Sen commented that, \\"The trailers and the anthem of this show have been running on television for quite a while, but I had not seen the videos. When I heard it, I was shocked.\\" He claimed that in the year 2000, his band Euphoria released its second album Phir Dhoom, and one of its songs was named \\"Satyameva Jayate\\". According to him, the refrain of Ram Sampath's track is exactly the same as the chants in his song. He went on to add that, \\"They've basically used the same refrain. Jo baaki ka gaana hai (the rest of the song), has different words and tune. But the mainstay of the song ‚Äî the chorus ‚Äì is ours.\\" Sen also stated that he wouldn't have minded giving Sampath the permission to use the tune of his version of \\"Satyamev Jayate\\" had he asked him for his consent and in return he would have just asked for a small credit to the band for the song. ==Broadcast== Aamir Khan at Satyamev Jayate press conference, 12 July 2012. Satyamev Jayate was the first show of Indian television which aired simultaneously on a private channel network STAR and a national broadcaster Doordarshan. The show was dubbed in several languages including three southern Indian languages viz., Malayalam, Tamil and Telugu, along with Bengali and Marathi. Apart from Star Plus, the show was simulcast on STAR World (with English Subtitles), STAR Utsav, STAR Pravah, STAR Jalsha, Asianet and STAR Vijay within the STAR Network and other channels including DD National and Eenadu TV. Besides India, the show aired in over 100 countries around the world. On the broadcast, Khan commented, \\"This show is being launched on a large scale. I had to make complete use of this medium. This is a baby step in that direction.\\" Satyamev Jayate was dubbed into Kannada but was not broadcast in the language, due to a self-imposed and self-enforced ban by the Kannada film industry, which does not allow a dubbed version of any serial or movie to telecast in the state. The Kannada film industry, however, does approve Kannada remakes of the same. After the first episode, Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray requested the Karnataka government to allow the show to be aired. On the issue, Thackeray commented that \\"This show must not be tied up in parochial chains or barred from the public. This is our view.\\" Khan also requested the Karnataka Film Chamber of Commerce to allow the show to be aired in Karnataka. The first episode in Kannada was later released on show's official site. The show premiered on 6 May 2012 and was telecast on Sundays at 11 am IST thereafter. While the channel authorities were high on showcasing it in the prime time at 9 pm, Khan wanted to telecast it on Sunday mornings since the slot was commonly considered as \\"family TV viewing\\" time in Indian television after popular shows Mahabharata and Ramayana were aired on Sunday mornings and were highly successful. He was reported saying, \\"I wanted to telecast my show on Sunday morning. I want each family to watch the show and connect with it. We have watched Ramayana and Mahabharata and it used to come on Sunday morning. The shows created a different atmosphere.\\" He further added that, \\"I don't understand TRPs and GRPs. I have no idea how to calculate it! I don't care about it. It is important to reach out to the Indian audiences. If viewers want to see, they will see or else it is up to them.\\" Special screening in villages Star Plus organised a special screening of the first episode of the show in some villages in Gujarat, Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh where the villagers do not have access to television. The initiative was said to have been taken to ensure Satyamev Jayate reaches all over the country as it caters to the issues of the common people of the country. The program was screened on 6 May 2012, during the same time it was aired across the country, on community TV sets in villages like Bhingara and Kahupatta in Maharashtra, Chepa in Gujarat, Jhunkar in Madhya Pradesh, Tikeri, Lalpur, Sarauta, Khannapurwa and Maniram in Uttar Pradesh. Most of these villages are reported to have a population of less than 5,000. Gayatri Yadav from STAR India stated that, \\"This is an important and relevant show for all of India and Star India is going all out to make sure that this show reaches out to all Indians even in places with limited or no TV connectivity.\\" Based on the response to its first episode, the screening of subsequent episodes in a similar manner is being considered by STAR. Sponsors The show was presented and sponsored by Airtel and co-sponsored by Aqua guard. Other associate sponsors included Coca-Cola, Johnson & Johnson, Skoda Auto, Axis Bank, Berger Paints and Dixcy Scott. The title sponsorship was signed at around to , while associate sponsors paid around to . STAR India was reported to give exclusivity to its sponsors by not selling any advertising spots to any of its sponsors competitor's brand. Khan asked his brand managers not to buy any advertising slots or screen any of his advertisements during the show, fearing the dilution of its impact. The channel was reportedly paid a sum of for a 10-second advertising slot and had only 30 seconds of ad inventory left after the first episode went on air. ==Marketing== Promotions Aamir Khan promotes Satyamev Jayate on Diya Aur Baati Hum serial The teasers of the show were premiered on YouTube on 2 April 2012. The makers of show booked around 2,000 slots for the broadcaster's promos in 27 hours for an amount of . Reportedly, this was the highest costing promotional campaign for any Indian television show. Besides, the show was also promoted in Indian theaters. The theme song of the show was shown in 300 theaters across the country after the national anthem. In addition, interactive sessions were organized with audiences about the show in selected multiplexes of Mumbai and New Delhi. The responses of the audience were recorded and shown on screen during movie intervals. B. V. Rao of Aamir Khan Productions, claimed that \\"This is the first time that a TV show is being promoted in cinema halls.\\" On 3 May 2012, Khan appeared on the daily soap Diya Aur Baati Hum, aired on Star Plus to promote the show. Theme song The promo song of the show was composed by Ram Sampath, written by Prasoon Joshi and sung by Keerthi Sagathia & Nishit Mehta. Initially planned to compose a national song or an anthem, the team, however, composed a romantic love song reflecting the love for the country and relating it with each Indian. The song was shot by Ram Madhvani in different states of India and was released on 13 April 2012. Mobile application An official software application for the show was developed by Hungama Digital Media Entertainment and was released on Apple Appstore for iOS devices including iPhone, iPad and iPod for approximately. The app allowed apple users to stream songs and videos of each of its episodes and supported social integration, donation through Airtel money service, and followed the shows official Twitter timeline. Upon release, the app surpassed Instagram to make it to the top 25 apps on the Appstore within a couple of days. The app also ranked number one in the entertainment category. ==Reception== Critical response The show opened to highly positive reviews. Several media organizations praised Aamir Khan for his effort and described the show as a movement. In her review, Ritu Singh of IBN Live stated, \\"Aamir Khan deserves an applause for bringing up such a sensitive issue and presenting it in a hard hitting way. The amount of research Aamir and his team has put into the show was clearly visible with the facts and figures presented. Every aspect of the issue was covered with great diligence.\\" She concluded it by saying, \\"'Satyamev Jayate' is not just a show; it‚Äôs a movement to change people‚Äôs mindset.\\" Parmita Uniyal from Hindustan Times praised the content and format of the show and said, \\"Aamir Khan have to step in to do what journalists are supposed to do ‚Äì make a difference. The show is a classic example of that.\\" Gayatri Sankar from Zee News described the show as an \\"eye opener\\" and commented that, \\"Satyamev Jayate will make you unlearn all the wrong you have learnt and discover that compassionate human your soul wishes to be. The show grips you and leaves you dumfounded! You will be left asking for more and would wish the show never ends.\\" Trade analyst and film critic Komal Nahta commended that, \\"I cried while watching the show. I think people will watch it as it has touched an emotional chord.\\" Neeraj Roy, managing director and chief executive of Hungama Digital Media Entertainment, also praised the show by commending \\"Brilliant effort. Well done Aamir Khan and Satyamev Jayate. We can make a difference.\\" Sukanya Verma from Rediff.com expressed concerns regarding the show saying, \\"This is a grand initiative and a sound format into which a lot has been invested -- monetarily as well as in terms of research. Deriding this show simply because it is hosted by a Bollywood actor who is also a marketing whiz, questions our credibility, not his.\\" Some reviewers also criticized the show on various grounds. A review from Outlook India noted that, \\"[...] the show might well heighten awareness, enable the efforts of those doing real work at the ground level, and get the issue out of the denial closet, [...] But it is a little unrealistic to expect a film star and a TV show to change the world.\\" Subhash Jha from The Times of India commented on the show, \\"...though brave and thought provoking, was disappointing in its lack of genuine connectivity between the host and the victims of social atrocity. At the moment Satyamev Jayate looks like a product of elitist conscientiousness.\\" Sheela Bhatt, from Rediff.com, commented that the format of Satyameva Jayate has to be more profound, and the big problem of the show is that it is on predictable lines. She went on conclude by requesting Khan to bring in some raw energy in the show. Viewers' response The show also received positive feedback from various eminent personalities such as social activists, media houses, film and television personalities. Bal Thackeray, the founder and chief of the political party Shiv Sena praised the show and Khan for bringing out social issues in front of public. Prominent social activist and retired IPS officer Kiran Bedi described the show as \\"creative, evidence based, emotionally connecting and inspiring\\" while commenting that, \\"It is an expression of the power of media and the inherent potential of society in resolving its own problems.\\" Noted film actress Shabana Azmi appreciated the show for its research and emotional content: \\"Aamir Khan's show can bring a revolution. Thoroughly researched covers all aspects touches emotional chord n forces us to reexamine ourselves.\\" While film producer Ekta Kapoor proclaimed the show as \\"the best show of the decade\\", film directors Madhur Bhandarkar and Farhan Akhtar also praised the show commenting that the show brought the \\"desired change\\" to the small screen and that it is \\"a show with a heart\\" respectively. Other high personalities who lauded the show included Salman Khan, Dilip Kumar Preity Zinta, Dia Mirza, Boman Irani, Neha Dhupia, Mandira Bedi, Kabir Bedi, Mini Mathur, Kabir Khan, Maria Goretti, Vishal Dadlani, Ken Ghosh, Harsha Bhogle & Pritish Nandy.

After the first episode, for example, Rajasthan Chief Minister, Ashok Gehlot, urged public representatives and non- governmental organisations to take actions to stop the illegal practice of female foeticide. Khan met Gehlot over the issue, and Gehlot accepted the request to set up fast track court to deal the case of the sting operation featured on the show. Following the second episode, the helpline for children received an increased number of calls from across the country, reporting child abuse. The legislation to protect children below 18 years from sexual abuse became a reality with the Lok Sabha passing the bill. After exposing medical malpractice in another episode, Aamir Khan became the first non-MP to be invited to the Indian parliament, where he and his creative team presented research on the subject and discussed core issues related to the medical fraternity. The show has also been well received overseas, including many parts of Asia as well as some parts of Africa. The overseas market where it received the most interest was China, where it was initially watched online before being licensed to air on Chinese television in 2014, due to Aamir Khan's popularity there after the success of his film 3 Idiots (2009). His work on Satyamev Jayate, as well as similar issues raised in his films, such as Taare Zameen Par (2007), 3 Idiots, PK (2014), and Dangal (2016), has led to Khan being referred to as a \\"national treasure of India\\" or \\"conscience of India\\" by Chinese media. The show is highly regarded in China, where it is one of the highest-rated productions on popular Chinese site Douban. Comparisons Indian television producer-director Siddhartha Basu compared the show with The Oprah Winfrey Show stating, \\"I think Aamir makes for a pensive and studied Oprah. More power to him and even more power to issues he raises that affect us all. Hopefully, it will get people thinking and acting on it on a much bigger scale\\". The Hindustan Times and Wall Street Journal also compared the show with The Oprah Winfrey Show. Parmita Uniyal from Hindustan Times felt the show succeeds in convincing people of the outcomes of such practices better than a government campaign on female infanticide or a television soap like Balika Vadhu. Esha Razdan from Daily Bhaskar said the show was similar to reality shows like Crime Patrol or Bhanwar that were successful in staging the emotions perfectly on small screen but were treated differently in terms of format. Undoubtedly, a programme like 'Satyamev Jayate' was possible because the democratically elected government was open to criticism. Much could have been done to resolve the problems highlighted if a government supported team were created to act on the suggestions proposed during each episode. ==Episodes== Season One { style=\\"font-size: 90%;\\" \\" border=\\"2\\" cellpadding=\\"4\\" background: #f9f9f9; - align=\\"center\\" !width=8%Episode !width=22%Title !width=29%Topic !width=22%Song !width=15% - 1  Female foeticide in India \\"O Ri Chiraiya\\" 6 May 2012 - 2 Break the Silence Child sexual abuse \\"Haule Haule\\" 13 May 2012 - 3 ?

The novel tells the story of two Ashanti princes, Kwame Poku and Kwasi Boachi, who were taken from what is today Ghana and given to the Dutch king William II in 1837 as a surety in a business transaction between the Dutch and Ashanti kingdoms. The two boys are raised and educated in the Netherlands, after which Kwame returns to Africa while Kwasi continues his education in Weimar Germany and then takes a position in the Dutch East Indies. The novel is a postcolonial depiction of the Dutch colonial past. It quickly became a bestseller and was translated worldwide, and is now considered a classic of Dutch modern literature. ==Plot== Kwasi Boachi in 1900 The novel purports to be a memoir written in 1900 by Kwasi Boachi, one of two Ashanti princes taken from their homeland to the Netherlands in 1837 to receive a Christian education. It is mostly based on historical fact, and set partly in the nineteenth-century Dutch Gold Coast. Kwasi and his fellow Ashanti prince Kwame Poku are pestered at their school in Delft and attract a measure of attention from the royal court, which views the boys as curiosities and, while favoring them for the while, fails to offer them continued support. Kwasi and Kwame grow apart; Kwasi chooses to assimilate himself into Dutch culture and deny his African background, while Kwame is unable to adapt to his new environment. He returns to Africa, but finds himself an outcast there as he has by now forgotten his native language; no longer accepted by his own people, whom he never sees again. Almost three years are spent waiting in Fort Elmina for permission to return to his people while he slowly appears to sink into delusion, then commits suicide. Meanwhile, Kwasi attempts to seek his fortune in the Dutch East Indies but fails, owing in part to the prevalence of racism and a personal grudge held by one of his former classmates, who is his superior in the East Indies. ==Background and aftereffects== The book is based in part on Japin's own traumatic youth, and in part on historical research‚ÄîJapin spent ten years researching the novel, a postcolonial expos√© of the (short-lived) expansion of the Dutch colonial empire into West-Africa. The novel's action takes place in Africa, Weimar, and the Netherlands. During his research, Japin came across the story of Badu Bonsu II, a Ghanaian prince who rebelled against the Dutch overlords in 1837 and was executed and decapitated, after which his head was shipped to the Netherlands. Japin discovered the head in 2005, in the Leiden University Medical Center (LUMC). In March 2009, government officials announced that it would be returned to its homeland for proper burial, a promise fulfilled on 23 July 2009, after a ceremony held in The Hague. ==Critical reception== The book was an instant success in the Netherlands, and is now considered a classic of modern Dutch literature. Its English translation was praised in The New York Times as \\"Japin's rich and risky first novel\\", \\"a deeply humane book about a spectacularly exotic subject\\"; and by Heidi Benson in the San Francisco Chronicle as \\"a true story, fully and humanly imagined, and that is the measure of Japin's accomplishment.\\" The novel was also positively reviewed in Ghana; a reviewer in The Statesman wrote: \\"With simple and poignant prose, Japin is able to convincingly take the voice of a real-life historical figure, and thus illuminate the past sins of the author's own country, as well as those of a long-dead Ashanti king.\\" ==Translations and adaptations== It was translated in English as The Two Hearts of Kwasi Boachi (2000) and in Portuguese as O preto de cora√ß√£o brancoe (2003). In November 2007, an opera based on the novel premiered in Rotterdam, with an English libretto by Japin and music by the British composer Jonathan Dove. ==See also== *Elmina Java Museum ==References *Excerpt from the novel Category:1997 novels Category:Dutch novels nl:Arthur Japin#De zwarte met het witte hart ","title":"The Two Hearts of Kwasi Boachi"},{"id":"35301418","text":"The 10th Filmfare Awards were held on 13 June 1963, honoring the best films in Hindi Cinema of the year 1962.

Each point of the configuration belongs to four lines, and each line contains three points. Therefore, in the notation of configurations, the Reye configuration is written as 124163. ==Realization== The Reye configuration can be realized in three-dimensional projective space by taking the lines to be the 12 edges and four long diagonals of a cube, and the points as the eight vertices of the cube, its center, and the three points where groups of four parallel cube edges meet the plane at infinity. Two regular tetrahedra may be inscribed within a cube, forming a stella octangula; these two tetrahedra are perspective figures to each other in four different ways, and the other four points of the configuration are their centers of perspectivity. These two tetrahedra together with the tetrahedron of the remaining 4 points form a desmic system of three tetrahedra. Any two disjoint spheres in three dimensional space, with different radii, have two bitangent double cones, the apexes of which are called the centers of similitude. If three spheres are given, with their centers non-collinear, then their six centers of similitude form the six points of a complete quadrilateral, the four lines of which are called the axes of similitude. And if four spheres are given, with their centers non- coplanar, then they determine 12 centers of similitude and 16 axes of similitude, which together form an instance of the Reye configuration . The Reye configuration can also be realized by points and lines in the Euclidean plane, by drawing the three-dimensional configuration in three-point perspective. An 83122 configuration of eight points in the real projective plane and 12 lines connecting them, with the connection pattern of a cube, can be extended to form the Reye configuration if and only if the eight points are a perspective projection of a parallelepiped The 24 permutations of the points (\\\\pm 1, \\\\pm 1, 0, 0) form the vertices of a 24-cell centered at the origin of four-dimensional Euclidean space. These 24 points also form the 24 roots in the root system D_4. They can be grouped into pairs of points opposite each other on a line through the origin. The lines and planes through the origin of four-dimensional Euclidean space have the geometry of the points and lines of three-dimensional projective space, and in this three-dimensional projective space the lines through opposite pairs of these 24 points and the central planes through these points become the points and lines of the Reye configuration . The permutations of (\\\\pm 1, \\\\pm 1, 0, 0) form the homogeneous coordinates of the 12 points in this configuration. ==Application== pointed out that the Reye configuration underlies some of the proofs of the Bell‚ÄìKochen‚ÄìSpecker theorem about the non-existence of hidden variables in quantum mechanics. ==Related configurations== The Pappus configuration may be formed from two triangles that are perspective figures to each other in three different ways, analogous to the interpretation of the Reye configuration involving desmic tetrahedra. If the Reye configuration is formed from a cube in three-dimensional space, then there are 12 planes containing four lines each: the six face planes of the cube, and the six planes through pairs of opposite edges of the cube. Intersecting these 12 planes and 16 lines with another plane in general position produces a 163124 configuration, the dual of the Reye configuration. The original Reye configuration and its dual together form a 284284 configuration . There are 574 distinct configurations of type 124163 . ==References== * * *. *. *. See also pp. 154‚Äì157. *.

Although there is some ambiguity in reference to the definition of second- generation Americans, this definition is cited by major research centers such as the United States Census Bureau and the Pew Research Center.\\"Nation's Foreign-Born Population Nears 37 Million\\". Press Release. U.S. Census Bureau. October 19, 2010. https://www.census.gov/newsroom/releases/archives/foreignborn_population/cb10-159.html (accessed March 2, 2012). As the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution guarantees citizenship to any individual born in the U.S. who is also subject to the jurisdiction of the U.S., second-generation Americans are currently granted U.S. citizenship by birth. However, political debate over repealing this right has increased in recent years. Advocates of this motion claim that this right attracts unauthorized immigration to the U.S.Passel, Jeffrey, and D'Vera Cohn. \\"Unauthorized Immigrant Population: National and State Trends, 2010.\\" Pew Hispanic Center. February 1, 2011. http://www.pewhispanic.org/files/reports/133.pdf (accessed March 2, 2012). The repeal of birthright citizenship would have the greatest impact on second- generation Americans who are Mexican Americans, as Mexico is the country of origin for the majority of undocumented immigrants in the U.S. The growing presence of first-generation immigrants in the U.S. has led to a growth in the percentage of the population that can be categorized as second-generation Americans. This is due to immigrants being more likely than native born adults to have children.Passel, Jeffrey, and Paul Taylor. \\"Unauthorized Immigrants and Their U.S.-Born Children.\\" Pew Hispanic Center, August 11, 2010. http://www.pewhispanic.org/files/reports/125.pdf (accessed March 2, 2012). In 2009, immigrants, both legal and unauthorized, were the parents of 23% of all children in the U.S. The process by which second-generation immigrants undergo assimilation into U.S. society affects their economic successes and educational attainments, with the general trend being an improvement in earnings and education relative to the parental generation. Second-generation Americans have an increasingly important impact on the national labor force and ethnic makeup. ==Statistics== In 2009, 33 million people in the United States were second-generation immigrants, representing 11% of the national population. There are significant differences in income and education levels between the second generation immigrant population and the first generation immigrant population in the United States. Second-generation immigrants are doing better overall and are assimilating more successfully into U.S. society. Income In comparison to first generation immigrants, second-generation immigrants are more likely to achieve higher earnings. In 2008, the median annual earnings for second-generation immigrants were $42,297 while the median annual earnings for first generation immigrants were $32,631. In the same year, the U.S. Census Bureau found that second-generation immigrants had higher earnings overall, with 42% of the second generation immigrant population earning above $50,000 compared to just 31% of the first generation immigrant population. Second-generation immigrants are also less likely to live in poverty relative to their first generation counterparts. Education levels Population by generational status and educational attainment in the US, 2009 Second-generation immigrants are more educated compared to first generation immigrants, exceeding parental education in many instances. A greater percentage of second-generation immigrants have obtained a level of education beyond a high school diploma, with 59.2% having at least some college education in 2009. Also in 2009, 33% of the second generation immigrant population had a bachelor's degree. The following graph depicts the data collected by the U.S. Census Bureau on educational attainments for immigrant generations in the year 2009. In earlier studies, migration is shown to be a risk factor in child development. On the contrary, many immigrant adolescents perform equally or even better than national adolescents, specifically in school. Reports have shown that immigrant adolescents earn better grades in school than their national contemporaries, despite their lower socio-economic status. However, as immigrant youth assimilate into United States culture, their developmental and educational outcomes become less optimal. This phenomenon is known as the Immigrant Paradox. There are a couple explanations for this phenomenon, first of all being the free public education system of the United States. For Latino immigrants, free access to education is a major factor in deciding to immigrate to the U.S. and once they arrive, they stress upon their children the importance to succeed academically in order to make their lives better. Another factor increasing the initial educational success of immigrants is the fact that many of them are bilingual. Native bilingualism allows immigrants a distinct advantage in the completion of composite tasks. ==Theories on cultural assimilation== The majority of immigrants in the United States are non-white.Portes, Alejandro, and Min Zhou. \\"The New Second Generation: Segmented Assimilation and Its Variants.\\" ANNALS. 530. no. 1 (1993): 74‚Äì96. Immigrants come from diverse backgrounds and have unique cultures taken from their native countries. The children of such immigrants in the U.S., also known as \\"second-generation immigrants,\\" experience a cultural conflict between that of their parents and that of mainstream U.S. society. The process by which these second-generation immigrants assimilate into society is increasingly being researched, and multiple theories on the cultural assimilation of second-generation immigrants have been proposed. Segmented assimilation The theory of segmented assimilation for second-generation immigrants is highly researched in the sociological arena. Segmented assimilation focuses on the notion that people take different paths in how they adapt to life in the United States. This theory states that there are three main different paths of assimilation for second-generation immigrants. Some immigrants assimilate smoothly into the white middle class of America, others experience downward assimilation, and others experience rapid economic success while preserving the values of their immigrant community. This theory also includes the concept of modes of incorporation, which are the external factors within the host community that affect assimilation. These factors are created by the underlying policies of the government, the strength of prejudice in the society, and the makeup of coethnic communities within the society. These modes of incorporation affect how a child will assimilate into U.S. society, and determine how vulnerable the child will be towards downward assimilation. Factors that enhance such vulnerability include racial discrimination, location, and changes in the economy that have made it harder for intergenerational mobility. In addition, differing modes of incorporation make available certain resources that second- generation immigrants can use to overcome challenges to the process of assimilation. If the child belongs to a group that has been exempt from the prejudice experienced by most immigrants, such as European immigrants, they will experience a smoother process of assimilation. A second generation immigrant can also make use of established networks in the coethnic community. These networks provide these children with additional resources beyond those offered by the government, such as gateways into well paying jobs in businesses established by the ethnic community. Children of middle class immigrants have a greater likelihood of moving up the social ladder and joining American mainstream society than children of lower class immigrants, as they have access to both the resources provided by their parents and to the educational opportunities afforded to the middle class in the U.S. Downward assimilation Multiple factors affect the likelihood of downward assimilation, including race, location, and absence of mobility ladders. Generally, immigrants enter the sectors of the labor force that experience low pay, commonly through jobs in the service sector and manufacturing. Such jobs seldom offer chances for upward mobility. The lack of good pay and resources available to immigrant parents affects the likelihood of their U.S.-born children being able to rise out of poverty. Children born to low skilled immigrants may experience assimilation into the impoverished groups of the United States. Instead of adapting to the mainstream values and expectations of U.S. society, they take on the adversarial stance of the poor, entering the vicious cycle of poverty. According to the theory of segmented assimilation, second-generation immigrants are less likely to experience downward assimilation when their race does not align with groups that experience prejudice and discrimination, such as African Americans. Also, immigrant families can enter well established ethnic groups in the United States to increase their pool of resources, lowering the possibility of downward assimilation for their children. Criticism Not all studies coincide with the theory of segmented assimilation. Other studies have found that second generation immigrant groups' earnings are in line with native born groups.Kasinitz, Philip, John Mollenkopf, Mary Waters, and Jennifer Holdaway. Inheriting the City: The Children of Immigrants Come of Age. New York: Harvard University Press, 2008. Arrest rates indicate similarities in the engagement of deviant behavior between second-generation immigrants and the white population in the U.S., contradicting the theory of segmented assimilation since these similarities support the idea of assimilation towards the dominant norm of mainstream U.S. society. Despite the barriers that come from being born to immigrants who are generally low skilled, have little education, and have less knowledge of the English language compared to U.S. natives, second- generation immigrants are doing better than U.S. native groups of comparable racial backgrounds, contradicting the concept of downward assimilation. A major factor that contributes to second-generation immigrants doing so well is the drive to succeed and do better than their predecessors that is commonly instilled in these immigrants from childhood by their families.Perlmann, Joel, and Roger Waldinger. \\"Second Generation Decline? Immigrant Children Past and Present- a Reconsideration.\\" International Migration Review. 31. no. 4 (1997); 893‚Äì922. The theory of segment assimilation undermines such early socialization. Second-generation immigrants of minority status in terms of ethnicity can also move up the social economic ladder via minority rights and resources available through programs directed at the betterment of minority groups in the U.S.Waters, Mary. \\"Twenty-First Century Melting Pot.\\" Contexts.1. no. 2 (2002); 62‚Äì63. Second-generation immigrants are also entering the labor force with higher levels of education compared to their parents, which helps balance the negative effects associated with having low skilled immigrant parents.Waldinger, Roger, and Cynthia Feliciano. \\"Will the new second generation experience 'downward assimilation'? Segmented assimilation re-assessed.\\"Ethnic and Racial Studies. 27. no. 3 (2004): 376‚Äì402. Another major criticism of segmented assimilation is that it predicts downward mobility for children of low skilled immigrants when studies have shown that upward mobility is more likely due to the children already starting off at the bottom.Farley, Reynolds, and Richard Alba. \\"The new second generation in the United States.\\" International Migration Review. 36. no. 2 (2002); 669‚Äì701. Other theories The theory of \\"straight line\\" assimilation, also known as linear assimilation or simple assimilation was developed based on the experiences of European immigrants to the U.S. in the early 20th century.Gratton, Brian, Myron Gutmann, and Emily Skop. \\"Immigrants, their children, and theories of assimilation: Family structure in the United States, 1880‚Äì1970.\\" The History of the Family. 12. no. 3 (2007); 203‚Äì22. This theory claims that as time passes and second-generation immigrants are exposed longer to the culture of mainstream U.S. society, the likelihood of assimilation into mainstream U.S. society increases. This theory predicts that each succeeding immigrant generation exhibits greater assimilation into mainstream society. With greater assimilation exhibited by each succeeding immigrant generation, unique ethnic characteristics that were clearly evident in the first generation fade away. The skin color of these immigrants led to them experiencing a smooth and straight line type of assimilation as they did not have to overcome the race barrier in their attempt to enter mainstream society. Another theory on cultural assimilation centers on the racial/ethnic disadvantage model. This theory emphasizes that the process of assimilation for certain immigrant groups is blocked due to their race or ethnicity, meaning that discrimination in society and in the workplace hinders assimilation into mainstream U.S. society.Brown, Susan and Frank Bean. \\"Assimilation Models, Old and New: Explaining a Long-Term Process.\\" Migration Information Source. October 1, 2006. Web. (accessed April 13, 2012). The major critique of this theory is that it overstresses social barriers along racial and ethnic lines without providing adequate explanations for why many second- generation immigrants overcome these barriers and experience socioeconomic mobility. ==Differences within the second generation immigrant population== There is a great deal of diversity in terms of ethnicities and races within the second immigrant generation population. This diversity among immigrants can be seen in language use, as the majority of second-generation immigrants are bilingual, with 2/3 speaking a language other than English in their homes. In addition, differing ethnicity and racial groups have experiences that are unique to their group. Hispanics, Asian Americans, and Caribbean Americans are three of the major groups that make up the population of second-generation immigrants in the United States. Latinos In 2003, the Pew Research Center projected that in the next twenty years, second generation Latinos will account for the largest percentage of the U.S. population. In 2003 it was also projected that, if current trends continue, over the next 20 years, 1/4 of the growth in the labor force will be due to second-generation immigrants who are Latino. 1/7 of new students enrolling in schools within this same time period will also be second generation Latinos. The increasing representation of second-generation immigrants who are Latino in the areas of work, school, and the larger population can be attributed to the continuing influx of Latino immigrants and the high fertility rate of Latino immigrants, which is higher than any other segment of the national population. As the number of second generation Latinos/as grows, so will their political and economical influence. In relation to educational achievement, second generation Latinos follow the general trend for second-generation immigrants in the United States. In comparison to first generation Latino immigrants, second generation Latinos are more likely to intermarry with members of other racial groups. These higher rates of racial intermarriage leads to an increase in the birthrates of interracial children, aiding in the elimination of disparities in the U.S. that exist along ethnic lines. Currently, Mexican Americans constitute the largest percentage of second-generation immigrants in the United States.Waldinger, Roger, and Cynthia Feliciano. \\"Will the new second generation experience 'downward assimilation'? Segmented assimilation re- assessed.\\" Ethnic and Racial Studies. 27. no. 3 (2004): 376‚Äì402. Among male high school graduates, the employment rates are comparable to those experienced by native born whites. When location is controlled for, the employment rate of Mexican American second-generation immigrants surpasses that of native born, non-Hispanic whites. Among male Mexican American second- generation immigrants who have less than a high school diploma, employment rates are also higher than those of native born, non-Hispanic whites. Mexican second generation women experience an employment rate slightly below that of native whites. This gap in labor participation increases for those with less than a high school diploma. Similar levels of labor force participation does not necessarily mean similar earnings, as part-time is considered employment and Mexican Americans are more likely to take on jobs with lower pay. Asian Americans The use term Asian American in the U.S. was cultivated during the time of the Civil Rights era, when minorities alike endeavored to be heard, and since then the Asian American identity has continued to develop. Historically the predominant Asian ethnicity in the U.S. has been Chinese and Japanese, though among second generation Asian Americans ethnic diversity has increased considerably.Park, J. Z. (2008). Second-Generation Asian American Pan-Ethnic Identity: Pluralized Meanings Of A Racial Label. Sociological Perspectives, 51(3), 541‚Äì61. 27% of the Asian population in the U.S. can be categorized as second-generation immigrants.Zhou, Min, and Yang Xiong. \\"The multifaceted American experiences of the children of Asian immigrants: Lessons for segmented assimilation.\\" Ethnic and Racial Studies. 28. no. 6 (2005); 1119‚Äì52. The cultural assimilation of second generation Asians is diverse, coinciding with the theory of segmented assimilation. The diversification of the pool of Asian immigrants, where many are highly educated, plays a pivotal role in the assimilation of the second generation. Second generation Asian immigrants are therefore more likely to be born into a middle-class family than second-generation immigrants from other racial groups. Highly skilled Asian immigrants tend to settle in suburbs upon their arrival to the United States, further promoting the assimilation of their children into white middle class society. Asian second-generation immigrants, like their Hispanic counterparts, tend to be bilingual. Children of Asian immigrants are likely to lose proficiency in their parents' native language while maintaining an emotional attachment to their family and heritage, which helps them develop their identity. While second generation Asian immigrants strive for the middle class white status, as many of their parents do, they develop a sensitivity to issues of race and ethnicity, which can be a major factor in the process of assimilation. This assimilation is also known to create \\"intergenerational family conflict.\\" In contrast to their parents, second generation Asian Americans are less likely to tolerate racial stereotyping and racial discrimination, are more likely to marry non-Asians and are more aware of their minority status and the disadvantages associated with it. This has been linked to racism and discrimination experienced by minorities in the U.S. as this heightened sensitivity is common among all second generation groups of minority status, and this heightened sensitivity evokes an enhanced drive for success. This focus on success, in combination with the common Asian cultural value of family honor, helps explain the high educational successes seen by second generation Asian immigrants. College graduation rates are relatively high among second generation Asian Americans, with the two highest rates seen among the Chinese and Indian second generation. Asian Americans have been characterized as a panethnicity of various groups or individuals. These generalizations are mostly based on outward appearance. Today, however, because of awareness made known by second generation Asian Americans, people are learning to associate and recognize the diverse cultures that exist under the umbrella term of Asian Americans. Caribbean Americans Generally, first generation black immigrants of Caribbean origin in the United States tend to hold on tightly to their ethnic identities and resist the social pressures of identifying themselves as African Americans.Waters, Mary. \\"Ethnic and Racial Identities of Second-Generation Black Immigrants in New York City.\\" International Migration Review. 28. no. 4 (1994); 795‚Äì820. Children born to these black Caribbean immigrants can easily enter the category of African Americans as they tend to lack the accents exhibited by their parents. A popular destination for these black immigrants is New York City, where the second generation black immigrant population is significant. Another popular destination is Florida, where in Miami there exists a strong Haiti community. In this community, also referred to as \\"Little Haiti\\", the Caribbean influence is clear as shops are decorated in bright Caribbean colors and decorations. Further studies reveal that the identification of second-generation immigrants, of Caribbean heritage, as African Americans leads these children to be more aware of racial discrimination in the U.S. In addition, the assimilation into black society and black culture in the U.S. by these children is hindered by their parents' oppositional stance to American black culture, contributing to identity conflict. In the case of Haitians, first generation Haitians hold on strongly to their foreign identity, as they associate the preservation of their culture with stronger solidarity in the community. These first generation Haitians attempt to instill this same Haitian pride in their children as they want the children to succeed on the basis of ethnic solidarity and the preservation of Haitian culture, and not by giving in to American culture. This creates a clash between the ideas and values these children learn at home, and from their peers and the non-Haitian black community. Thus, these children face conflicting pressures from family, non-second generation immigrant peers, and discrimination by the larger society. Racism is an important deterring factor to the process of assimilation for black second-generation immigrants, as it is for other second-generation immigrants of ethnic minorities.Lacy, Karyn. \\"Black spaces, black places: Strategic assimilation and identity construction in middle-class suburbia.\\" Ethnic and Racial Studies. 27. no. 6 (2004); 908‚Äì30. Children of middle class black immigrants undergo assimilation that coincides with one of the pathways theorized by segmented assimilation, in which they assimilate into mainstream society while attempting to hold on to their black culture. These children make use of the resources available to the middle class in the U.S. to prosper alongside their white counterparts, but are still affected by racial discrimination. They make use of so-called \\"black spaces,\\" which are spaces exclusive to the black community, such as networks and ethnic enclaves designed for African Americans. Thus these spaces are free of racism and are used to connect with other African Americans and reconnect with the cultures of their parents. Similar to Asian second-generation immigrants born into the middle class, these black second-generation immigrants of middle class status are also aware of their inferior position and the disadvantages associated with being an ethnic minority in the United States. ==References in pop culture== There are a few television series that feature at least one second generation immigrant in a starring role: Fresh Off the Boat, All-American Girl, Ugly Betty, Grey's Anatomy, Elementary, and The Mindy Project. ==See also== * Immigrant generations * Immigration * Immigration to the United States * Illegal immigration to the United States * Immigrant health care in the United States * Inequality within immigrant families in the United States * Race and ethnicity in the United States Census ==References== Category:Immigration to the United States ","title":"Second-generation immigrants in the United States"},{"id":"35301473","text":"Rex Morgan (October 27, 1948 ‚Äì January 15, 2016) was an American basketball player who played as a guard in the National Basketball Association.

The lines of the configuration can be partitioned into two subsets of six lines: each line is disjoint from (skew with) the lines in its own subset of six lines, and intersects all but one of the lines in the other subset of six lines. Each of the 12 lines of the configuration contains five intersection points, and each of these 30 intersection points belongs to exactly two lines, one from each subset, so in the notation of configurations the Schl√§fli double six is written 125302. ==Construction== As Schl√§fli showed, the double six may be constructed from any five lines a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, that are all intersected by a common line b6, but are otherwise in general position (in particular, each two lines ai and aj should be skew, and no four of the lines ai should lie on a common ruled surface). For each of the five lines ai, the complementary set of four out of the five lines has two quadrisecants: b6 and a second line bi. The five lines b1, b2, b3, b4, and b5 formed in this way are all in turn intersected by another line, a6. The twelve lines ai and bi form a double six: each line ai has an intersection point with five of the other lines, the lines bj for which i ‚â† j, and vice versa. An alternative construction, shown in the illustration, is to place twelve lines through the six face centers of a cube, each in the plane of its face and all making the same angles with respect to the cube's edges. ==Related objects== The 12-vertex crown graph, the intersection graph of the lines of the double six A generic cubic surface contains 27 lines, among which can be found 36 Schl√§fli double six configurations. The set of 15 lines complementary to a double six, together with the 15 tangent planes through triples of these lines, has the incidence pattern of another configuration, the Cremona‚ÄìRichmond configuration. The intersection graph of the twelve lines of the double six configuration is a twelve-vertex crown graph, a bipartite graph in which each vertex is adjacent to five out of the six vertices of the opposite color. The Levi graph of the double six may be obtained by replacing each edge of the crown graph by a two-edge path. The intersection graph of the entire set of 27 lines on a cubic surface is the complement of the Schl√§fli graph. ==References== * * ==External links== * Category:Configurations (geometry) ","title":"Schl√§fli double six"},{"id":"35301613","text":"Salah Al-Mukhtar is the foremost resisting Ba'athist leader of Iraq.

Ethics have been a highly debated and controversial element in branding exercises. Marketers' opinions on this aspect of sales have varied from time to time. Using ethical practices to build brand equity and brand positioning has been employed by different marketing experts, based on their cultural and ethical value systems. Sagar et al., Through their research in this area, marketers have come up with EPI. There are several steps involved in deriving and calculating an EPI. First, a set of blended variables of brand positioning and ethics is identified, consisting of 5 elements of brand positioning sub-divided into 15 and ten sub-elements of ethics. Then, consumer ratings are obtained for all elements on a 1‚Äì5 scale, which in total makes 25 values ranging from 1 to 5. The sub-element scores are then averaged over the whole sample to obtain an average score for each sub- element. Thus, a set of 25 average scores is obtained. Second, the sub- elements of brand positioning are taken and combined to obtain five sub- elements of brand positioning. The calculation of scores for the five brand positioning variables is done by evaluating the arithmetic mean of the various sub-elements that a brand positioning variable includes. Thus, a set of five average scores, labeled as SB1-SB5, is obtained, which reflects the consumer preference for the various attributes. Similarly, a score is obtained for the ten sub-elements of ethics, and are labeled as SE1-SE10. A high score reflects greater liking, while a low score indicates dislike and insignificance. Third, the weights are obtained for the various elements. To obtain the weight for each of the five brand positioning variables, the average score of the variable is divided by the sum of the average scores of all the five brand positioning variables. The weights so obtained are labeled WB1-WB5. Similarly, 15 weights, labeled WE1‚ÄìWE10, are obtained for all ten ethic variables from the analysis of the conducted survey. Finally, the EPI score is calculated and arranged in descending order to obtain the EPI. == References  * http://www.inderscience.com/search/index.php?action=record&rec;_id=24611 * http://www.indianjournals.com/ijor.aspx?target=ijor:jmr&volume;=6&issue;=2&article;=002 * http://www.emeraldinsight.com/journals.htm?articleid=1923804&show;=pdf * http://ethicalpositioning.blogspot.com/2008/05/idea-behind-ebp-ethical- brand.html * http://www.environmental-expert.com/articles/global-brand-s- strategies-for-ethical-brand-positioning-in-cross-cultural-environment-an- indian-context-80474/view-comments Category:Index numbers Category:Branding terminology ","title":"Ethical positioning index"},{"id":"35301698","text":"Rick Barton may refer to: *Rick Barton (diplomat) (born 1949), United States diplomat, educator and author *Rick Barton (musician), American guitarist and singer ==See also== *Richard Barton (disambiguation) ","title":"Rick Barton"},{"id":"35301750","text":"Daniel Joseph Martinez (born 1957) is a Los Angeles-based contemporary artist. ==Early life== Martinez grew up in Lennox, California, a working-class area of Los Angeles County near Los Angeles International Airport.

In 1940 he broke the South American records in the 200-metre freestyle and the 100-metre breaststroke as well as the Brazilian record in the 100-metre freestyle while competing against touring swimmers from Japan, including Olympic medalists Masanori Yusa and Tetsuo Hamuro. Later that year he was national champion in the breaststroke and relay events, as well as the 100m freestyle, for the first time. Jordan was offered a full scholarship to Yale University during World War II but declined it because of his support for, and ancestry from, Germany. He continued swimming and improved several South American records during the war years while working for his father's company. He resumed participation in international tournaments following the conflict and competed in the 1948 Summer Olympics in London. Participating in two events, he finished sixth in a field of thirty-two swimmers in the men's 200-metre breaststroke and eighth among fourteen nations in the men's 4√ó200-metre freestyle relay, alongside S√©rgio Rodrigues, Rolf Kestener, and Aram Boghossian.

Founded by chairman emeritus Thomas (Tom) J. Burrell, and headquartered in Chicago, IL, Burrell Communications is one of the largest multi-cultural marketing firms in the world. Some of the company's work is part of a collection in the Library of Congress. Burrell Communications is now under the leadership of co- chief executive officers, Fay Ferguson and McGhee Osse and chief creative officer, Lewis Williams. ==History== Burrell Communications was founded in 1971, by Tom Burrell and then partner, Emmett McBain, and was originally named Burrell McBain. The company was established with the intention of forging an authentic and respectful relationship with the African-American consumer, and to tap into how the black aesthetic could also appeal to the general market consumer. It was at this time that Burrell coined the phrase, \\"Black people are not dark-skinned white people.\\" Recognizing that there existed inherent cultural differences, and the fact that these differences drove patterns of consumption, became a driving force and inspiration for future ad campaigns at Burrell. 1971-73‚ÄîBurrell McBain quickly establishes itself as a leading shop for niche African American -focused communications. Beginning with the creation of the Black Marlboro Man for Philip Morris, accounts quickly expanded to include marquis brands McDonald's and Coca-Cola. 1974‚ÄîEmmett McBain leaves the agency, and it is renamed Burrell Advertising 1975-80‚ÄîBurrell's business grows steadily, garnering acclaim in particular for their work on The Coca-Cola Company and McDonald's campaigns. The Coca-Cola commercial entitled \\"Street Song\\" wins Burrell its first Clio Award. By 1979, Burrell tops $10 million in billing per annum, making it one of the most successful multi-cultural advertising shops in the United States. 1981-83‚ÄîBurrell Advertising picks up Martell Cognac and Stroh's accounts. The McDonald's \\"Double Dutch\\" Commercial in particular gains national attention and gains a Gold Award at the U.S. Television Commercials Festival. Agency billing climbs to $20 million annually. In order to accommodate increased needs for their Coca-Cola account, Burrell opens an office in Atlanta, GA. 1984- 86‚ÄîBurrell Advertising gains the Procter and Gamble account. Their work for Crest Toothpaste becomes the first major packaged goods account to target an African American consumer audience. Burrell agency billing surpasses $50 million. 1987-90-- Burrell gets the Polaroid account, and gains new campaigns on Procter and Gamble's Tide, and Kraft Foods Stovetop Dressing. 1991-96-- The agency is renamed Burrell Communications. Alma Hopkins is named CCO, while Sarah Burroughs is named President. Burrell Communications is awarded the Grand Effie by the American Marketing Association for its work on \\"Who Wants,\\" a spot created for the Partnership for a Drug Free America.

However the health system structure exist in publications only where it mirrors national health systems in the West and just whilst just like other systems in Malawi, it does not function. This is largely due to lack of manpower, lack of basic/expert skills set, overpopulation, lack of equipment/technology, corruption, lack of political commitment, lack of sufficient funds, poor prioritisation in budgeting and low motivation among personnel. According to World Health Organization Report, Malawi health system ranks number 185 out of 190. The figurative picture of the health system can be created by understanding the indicators of a failing system or the mere non existence of the system. There is no emergency systems in place for medical services, fire service or crime response (no ambulated paramedic response system (as in a 112 no 999 service)). Where there's need to obtain such services, victims are required to meet the cost. Only the very few privately run hospitals in the two major cities of Blantyre and Lilongwe have very limited non purposely built vehicles serving as basic ambulances used to transport their paying patients mostly without life saving equipment onboard or an on-board paramedic. In April 2012 the then State President suffered a cardiac arrest which resulted to his death due to lack of medication both within the presidential medical team and at the main referral hospital where he was attended to. As of 2016 Malawi has only one qualified cardiologist consultant who is based at a private hospital. Recent survey indicate that, unlike in cases of HIV, Malaria or TB, patients suffering from diseases which require expert clinical skills and equipment i.e. cardiac or neural related problems, are likely to receive wrong diagnosis and incorrect treatment or medication resulting to in unnecessarily high mortality rates. There is no provider of aeromedical service within Malawi. Malawi has the lowest ranking on health system among countries which are not affected by civil wars, however the medical services delivered still rank lower than some war torn countries. There is no national record information system for patients records. Most common medication found in hospital pharmacies in the west are not available locally i.e. treatment for the heart diseases or cancer are unavailable. There is an uncontrolled circulation of internationally banned drugs or out-of-date drugs in flea markets. Below is an outline of how the health system is meant to work as published by the Malawi's government department responsible for health. Patients enter into the system at the first tier and flow to higher tier facilities as needed. Medical supplies and human resources, however, flow in the opposite direction. The already limited resources are first allocated to the top tier facilities, leaving the second and third tier facilities with little to no resources. Malawi's Ministry of Health is responsible for healthcare in Malawi. 62% of health services are provided by the government, 37% are provided by the Christian Health Association of Malawi (CHAM), and a small fraction of the population receive health services through the private sector. Private doctors and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) offer services and medicines for a nominal fee. The public health system has three separate tiers (primary, secondary, and tertiary care). A system of referrals links these three tiers. Primary care, \\"where the bulk of health care actually happens in Malawi\\", consists of community-based outreach, manned and unmanned health posts, dispensaries, urban health centers and primary health centers (including rural/community hospitals). At the primary level (third tier), hospitals have holding beds, post-natal beds, holding wards and are able to provide out- patient, maternity, and ante-natal services. If the patient's condition is considered to be too critical for primary care facilities to handle, they will be referred to the next level of the healthcare system. Secondary level care is provided by district hospitals that are located in each of Malawi's 28 districts. These hospitals are equipped to provide the same basic services as the primary care facilities (mentioned above) in addition to a few more, such as: x-ray, ambulance, operating theatre and a laboratory. The top tier of care is provided by the central hospitals located in the major urban areas. These hospitals differ from the second tier hospitals in the existence of various specialized services. Health budget Andrew Mitchell, British Secretary of State for International Development, visiting a midwifery unit in Malawi According to the World Health Organization's statistics on Malawi, there has been a sharp increase in health expenditures in the past decade. From 2002 to 2011, the per capital total expenditure on health (PPP int.) increased from $27.2 to $77.0 and per capita government expenditure on health (PPP int.) increased from $16.4 to $56.5. These statistics indicate that the healthcare in Malawi is receiving greater attention and resource allocation. They also reflect the increased health focus of the government of Malawi. From 2002 to 2011, the percentage of total government expenditures allocated to health increased from 13% to 18.5%. Malawi's increased government expenditure on healthcare has coincided with a decrease in the country's dependence on external healthcare resources, such as international and non-governmental aid. In 2009 external resources were responsible for 97.4% of total health expenditures, in 2011 they were responsible for 52.4%. In 2017 89% of Malawian healthcare was provided through donors. Health staffing In Malawi's health profile, last updated in May 2013, the World Health Organization reported that there were only .2 physicians per 10,000 population and 3.4 nurses and midwives per 10,000 population. Malawi's shortage of healthcare personnel is the most severe in the region. Additionally, the minimal body of health workers are not evenly distributed in the healthcare system. Challenges that lead to this shortage are low outputs of medical training institutions, health worker retention, and disease. In the 1990s Malawi stopped training auxiliary nurses and medical assistants. In 2001, this training was resumed in an effort to increase human resources for health care. In 2005, Malawi began to implement its emergency human resource program which concentrates on increasing output of trained medical personnel, improving health worker compensation and retention. In 2017 there were around 200 pharmacists in the country, of which fewer than 10 are in the country's hospitals. Most hospitals don't have a pharmacist, and they use up their annual drug allocation in six months. Accessibility to healthcare facilities Limited access to health services in Malawi affect a large number of Malawians. Only 46% of citizens live within a 5 km radius of any kind of health facility. Despite most public health services being free for the patients, there are often costs associated with transportation to and from a facility. These costs deter many individuals that may be in dire need of care but cannot afford to assume the costs of transportation. Additional transportation needs complicate matters when an individual is referred from either a rural hospital to a district hospital or a district hospital to a central hospital. Medobal healthcare recently launched programs which gives direct access to healthcare specialists in overseas. Government efforts for healthcare improvement The Ministry of Health explicitly states the goals of healthcare improvement efforts in Malawi. # Range and quality of health services for mothers children under the age of 5 years expanded # Better quality health care provided in all facilities # Health services to general population strengthened expanded and integrated # Efficiency and equity in resource allocation increased # Access to health care facilities and basic services increased # Quality of trained human resources increased, improved equitably/efficiently distributed # Collaboration and partnership in health sector strengthened # Overall resources in health sector increased These objectives have been addressed in a variety of ways. In 2002, Malawi published the Poverty Reduction Strategy which included the Essential Health Package (EHP). The EHP was derived from estimates of the most significant burdens of disease in Malawi provided in 2002 by the World Health Organization. Its central focus is to combat 11 health issues that most greatly affect the poor. In 2004, the government of Malawi, in collaboration with partners, developed a six-year program of work (POW) that revolved around the EHP and guided the implementation of a health sector-wide approach (SWAp). In 2007, POW transitioned to become the Health Sector Strategic Plan, effective from 2007 to 2011. Measuring the outcomes of interventions, such as those facilitated by the SWAp, is very difficult due to the absence of a vital registration system and surveys to track changes in mortality. In 2019, The Ministry of Health Chief Director, Bestone Chisamile, said:‚ÄúInvesting in healthy people is the bedrock of economic and social development. I therefore appreciate the interest of Medobal family to assist governments in this network in building capabilities for quality improvement in coordinated ways.‚Äù Chisamile explained the launch of the company in Malawi signifies that quality healthcare service is everyone's responsibility saying the launch of Medobal in Malawi will enable countries to accelerate actions through well-coordinated and harmonised efforts to keep improving using evidence- based standards and implementation interventions. Reception of global health initiative funds The shortage of health workers in Malawi is an obstacle to utilizing Global Health Initiatives (GHI) funds effectively. Increasing health services such as HIV/AIDs treatment commonly prompt an increase in the number of minimally trained health care workers and a modest increase in clinical staff members. According to an extensive study published in 2010, when Malawi received a large amount of GHI funding from the Global Fund to fight AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria, there was an increase in faculty and staff across all levels of the health system. This increase in paid health workers was supported by task-shifting to less trained staff. ==References== Mala ","title":"Healthcare in Malawi"},{"id":"35301975","text":"Maakhir University (, ) is a university in the northern Sanaag (Maakhir) region of Puntland, an autonomous region of Somalia. ==Overview== Situated in Badhan, the college was established in 2009 with the purpose of providing affordable higher education to residents of the province and elsewhere in the nation.

However, in the late 2000s a number of these daytime dramas began to face major budget cuts and cancellations. Producer Matthew D'Amato and his crew sat with actors, producers, writers, and fans in over 70 interviews to provide an insider view of the world of soap operas as told by the people who live it in an attempt to uncover the reasons behind the sudden decline of the daytime soaps. == Production == Following the cancellation of many long-running soap operas in 2011, executive producer John Grossman assembled a team of filmmakers to document the events surrounding this milestone in American culture as they unfolded. The original idea for the film came from Carmen Grossman, wife of executive producer John Grossman. A long time General Hospital fan, Grossman was dismayed by the networks' sudden decisions to cancel an array of programs and recognized the need to help save the widely beloved Soap Operas. The film was produced over a one year period beginning in May 2011 by producer, Matthew D'Amato, and director, Sako Brockmann. The two filmmakers and their crew traveled coast to coast compiling a series of interviews with notable figures in the industry to get a sense of what was causing the sudden decline. Among those interviewed in the film are Agnes Nixon (creator of All My Children and One Life to Live), Lisa LoCicero (of General Hospital), Gary Tomlin (of Search for Tomorrow and Another World), Rick Hearst (of Guiding Light, General Hospital and The Bold and the Beautiful), Eileen Fulton (of As the World Turns), Julia Barr (of All My Children), and Jill Larson (of All My Children). In an interview with Soap Opera Digest, D'Amato describes the film as being,\\"About the past, present and future, but the focus is what's currently happening and where it's going. We talk about the history and some of the great stories but also what it takes to make a show, the numbers, the money, the focus groups, the networks.\\" The project was predominantly self-funded, but made effective use of Kickstarter to raise the money needed for post production work and subsequent distribution. == References  * # https://web.archive.org/web/20120414140242/http://abc.soapsindepth.com/2012/02/could- soaps-hit-hollywood.html # https://web.archive.org/web/20120409110043/http://daytimeconfidential.zap2it.com/2012/02/07/help- make-groundbreaking-film-soap-life-a-documentary-a-reality # http://michaelfairmansoaps.com/news/soap-life-a-documentary-on-daytime-drama- in-preparation-on-the-decline-future-of-soaps/2012/01/05/ Category:Documentary films about soap operas Category:American documentary films Category:American films Category:2012 films Category:2012 documentary films ","title":"Soap Life"},{"id":"35301992","text":"In head and neck cancer, Ohngren's line is a line that connects the medial canthus of the eye to the angle of the mandible.

Galvan, op. cit., pp. 108 & 202 ==Origins== According to the oral tradition of the Serer people, Jegan Joof migrated from Lambaye following a dispute with his relative, the king of Lambaye‚ÄìBaol Teign Jinaax Jalaan Joof (or Tee√± Jinaax Jalaan Juuf).Becker, Charles; Martin, Victor; & Nd√®ne. Aloyse; (R√©vision et √©dition par Charles Becker), Traditions villageoises du Siin (2014), pp. 191‚Äì192 The dispute was about the governance of Lambaye and over- taxation. Jegan Joof who was also a mix-farmer and with a large cattle herd felt he was being overtaxed unjustly. He thus decided to migrate with his younger brother Ndik Joof in search of new land and territory to exploit, hence the founding of Tukar, presently, a rather large village which includes numerous other villages such as Njujuf, Ndokh, Sob, etc. They were former colonies of Tukar and part of Jegan's estate. The Joof family reigned in Tukar for several centuries, inherited from their ancestor Lamane Jegan Joof. In the epic of Jegan Joof, he is reported to have had a son called Sosseh Joof (variation : Soc√© Diouf) who inherited his father's estate. Ndik Joof, brother of Jegan, is reported to have died in Tukar before Jegan's own death.Galvan, op. cit., p. 109-111, 2-281 Jegan Joof belongs to the Patik matriclan‚Äîone of the many Serer maternal clans. ==Land pawning== In 1937, a descendant of Jegan Joof called Biram Diouf pawned his family's estate to the Sene noble family of Sine. It took his descendants 50 years to pay off the debt and regained their family estate.Galvan, The State must be our master of fire, op. cit., p. 104 ==Status in religion== In the Serer religion, the Raan Festival takes place once a year in Tukar, on the second Thursday after the new moon in April. In this festival, the Serer high priests and priestesses known as the Saltigues make offering of millets and wine to the shrine of Saint Luguu√± Joof. This Holy Saint (or Pangool in Serer) is said to have guided Lamane Jegan Joof when he migrated from Lambaye in search of new land to exploit.Galvan, Dennis Charles, p 202.Gravrand, Henry, pp342-3 & 349 ==See also== *Serer people *Joof family *Lamane *Kingdom of Baol *Kingdom of Sine *Kingdom of Saloum *States headed by ancient Serer Lamanes ==References== Bibliography * Sarr, Alioune. \\"Histoire du Sine-Saloum (S√©n√©gal).\\" Introduction, bibliographie et notes par Charles Becker.

He was an influential figure in the later years of the Communist regime until his downfall during the 1989 Revolution. ==Biography== Bobu was born to a peasant family in , Boto≈üani County. He attended seven grades of primary school and the school for Romanian Railways (CFR) employees, subsequently becoming a lathe operator at the CFR workshop in Ia≈üi from 1943 to 1945. He entered the Union of Communist Youth in 1941 and the Romanian Communist Party (PCR) in November 1945. From that time until 1947, he was responsible for youth issues in the communist organization at the Ia≈üi CFR workshop.Neagoe, p.76 During 1948, by which time a communist regime had been established, he studied in Bucharest to become a teacher at the CFR schools. In 1949, he attended the law school in , and in 1950 he was named principal legal counsel at the Justice Ministry. Also that year, he became a military prosecutor in Bucharest, receiving the rank of lieutenant, and in 1952, he was promoted to the general prosecutor's office with the rank of captain. He studied law at the university level between 1954 and 1957. Meanwhile, at the administrative section of the party's central committee, he was named law instructor (March‚ÄìNovember 1953) and deputy section chief (1953‚Äì1958), as well as instructor at the central committee's mass organizations section. He also attended courses at the ≈ûtefan Gheorghiu Academy during this period. In 1959, he became president of the executive committee of the Suceava Region's council and a member of the regional party committee's bureau (1965‚Äì1966). In June 1960, he became a supplementary member of the central committee, advancing to full member in July 1965, shortly after Nicolae Ceau≈üescu came to power. Between 1968 and 1973, he was first secretary of the Suceava County party committee and president of the county council's executive committee. In December 1972, he became an adviser to Ceau≈üescu.Neagoe, p.77 He was Interior Minister from March 1973 to March 1975.

The following month, he became president of the council for economic and social organization, remaining until the Revolution. From 1984 until December 1989, he was general secretary of the PCR for organizational matters, and in November‚ÄìDecember 1989, he sat on the central committee's permanent bureau.Neagoe, p.78 According to Ion StƒÉnescu, who was Tourism Minister at the time, the fourteenth and final party congress of November 1989 saw flagging enthusiasm among attendees. It was Bobu who encouraged delegates with vigorous applause and shouted slogans, getting up and clapping after every phrase, sometimes interrupting Ceau≈üescu with applause before he had finished speaking. Florin Mihai, \\"Emil Bobu a fost aplaudac-≈üef la ultimul congres al PCR\\", Jurnalul Na≈£ional, 21 November 2009; accessed April 2, 2012 He was a member of the Great National Assembly between 1961 and 1989, variously representing Suceava, Ia≈üi, D√¢mbovi≈£a and Dolj counties. In 1981, he was awarded the title Hero of Socialist Labor. Political scientist Vladimir TismƒÉneanu describes him as part of a group of \\"deeply subservient\\" and \\"utterly incompetent\\" figures with whom Ceau≈üescu surrounded himself in the 1980s.TismƒÉneanu 2003, p.258 Starting in 1982, as part of her personal court of hagiographers, he was the undisputed second-in-command of Elena Ceau≈üescu;TismƒÉneanu 2003, p.205 described by TismƒÉneanu as \\"her most obedient servant\\", they were together responsible for all personnel appointments.TismƒÉneanu 1997, p.414 In their study of the regime's last years, Roger Kirk, United States Ambassador to Romania from 1985 to 1989, and Romanian diplomat Mircea RƒÉceanu assert that Bobu was \\"arguably the most powerful Romanian after the two Ceau≈üescus\\",Kirk, p.136 although his status within the party structure slipped following the thirteenth congress in November 1984.TismƒÉneanu 2003, p.209 On 20 December 1989, Ceau≈üescu sent Bobu, together with Prime Minister Constantin DƒÉscƒÉlescu, to Timi»ôoara, ordering them to try and quell the revolutionary activities there. The mission ended in failure and they returned to Bucharest early the following morning.Siani- Davies, pp.75‚Äì6 On the morning of 22 December, he accompanied Nicolae and Elena Ceau≈üescu in their flight by helicopter as far as the presidential retreat at . Left there with a promise by the dictator that a second helicopter would arrive, Bobu and Manea MƒÉnescu left after twenty minutes in an ARO vehicle driven by a ' officer. An angry crowd ambushed their car near the center of GƒÉe≈üti, beating the driver and throwing a few punches at Bobu as well. Placed under arrest by the local prosecutor, Bobu was found to be carrying 6,000 lei in his pockets and a list of organizers of the \\"enemy demonstration in Timi»ôoara\\". Mihai Voinea, \\"Capturarea lui Bobu ≈üi a lui MƒÉnescu\\" , AdevƒÉrul, 15 November 2009; accessed April 3, 2012 In February 1990, the Bucharest Military Tribunal pronounced sentence on four former CPEx members; Bobu, found guilty of complicity in genocide for his role in issuing orders to fire during the Revolution, received a term of life imprisonment and confiscation of all his personal property. The well-publicised proceedings have been described as a \\"show trial\\"; Bobu and three other prominent defendants pleaded guilty after delivering rehearsed, self-critical testimony that they later renounced. The state prosecutor filed an appeal in the case of the four, and in April 1993, the Supreme Court of Justice found that Bobu had committed not genocide but complicity in aggravated manslaughter and complicity in attempted aggravated manslaughter. His sentence was thus altered to ten years' imprisonment and five years' loss of political rights. In June 1993, the military tribunal accepted his request for parole, and he was released.Roht-Arriaza, pp.132‚Äì33 Bobu died in 2014 in a Bucharest hospital, as the result of a brain ischemia. \\"A murit Emil Bobu.

He was still a minor when he succeeded his father as Prince, so his mother took up the regency. Friedrich Wilhelm was sent to Baden, where he was further educated. He later completed his military training in Vienna. By the end of 1681, he took up the government of Hohenzollern-Hechingen himself. In the imperial army, Friedrich Wilhelm was Field Marshal and the owner of a regiment of cuirassiers bearing his name. In 1682, he participated in the suppression of an uprising in Hungary and in the victory in the Battle of Slankamen. In 1702, he was taken prisoner in Friedlingen. However, he managed to free himself. Two years later, he fought on the victorious side in the battle of Blenheim. Also in 1704, he fought under Field Marshal Sigbert Heister to suppress another Hungarian uprising. With permission from the Emperor, Friedrich Wilhelm reached an agreement with the Elector of Brandenburg about the Burgraviate of Nuremberg and became one of the first recipients of the Prussian Order of the Black Eagle. == Marriages and offspring == Friedrich Wilhelm has been married twice. He first married on 22 January 1687 in Vienna to Maria Leopoldina (1666‚Äì1709), the daughter of Count Georg Ludwig of Sinzendorf. With her, he had the following children: * Friedrich Ludwig (1688‚Äì1750), Prince of Hohenzollern-Hechingen * Ludwige Ernstine Friederike (1690‚Äì1720), married in 1713 Prince Franz Anton of Lamberg (1678‚Äì1759) * Charlotte (1692‚Äì1692) * Christine Eberhardine Friederike (1695‚Äì1754), abbess of Munsterbilzen Abbey * Sophie Johanna Frederika (1698‚Äì1754), abbess of Munsterbilzen Abbey * Friedrich Karl (1697‚Äì1697) He married his second wife on 7 September 1710 in Hechingen. She was Baroness Maximiliane Magdalena of L√ºtzau (1690‚Äì1755). Emperor Karl VI had elevated her to \\"Countess of Homburg\\" and this marriage was not considered morganatic. This marriage produced two children: * Herman Eberhard Friedrich (1711‚Äì1726), Count of Hohenzollern * Maria Maximiliana (1713‚Äì1743), married in 1741 to Count Innocent K√ºnigl of Ehrenburg (1714‚Äì1764) ==Ancestry References == * E.

Lile, 536 U.S. 24 (2002), is a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court determined that Kansas' Sexual Abuse Treatment Program (SATP) served a vital penological purpose and determined that allowing minimal incentives to take part in the SATP does not equal compelled self- incrimination as prohibited by the Fifth Amendment.. There were three main points to the case that were used to determine the SATPs were constitutional as summarized by the National District Attorneys Association (NDAA). These included the distinct findings that, ‚Äú[t]he SATP in Kansas is supported by the legitimate penological objective of rehabilitation‚Äù, that, ‚Äúthe fact that Kansas does not offer immunity or privilege in response to statements made by participants does not render the SATP invalid under the [fifth] amendment‚Äù, and that the, ‚Äúconsequences that follow for nonparticipation, no not, under the Kansas plan, combine to create compulsion, thereby infringing upon the participant‚Äôs [fifth] amendment right‚Äù. Due to the plurality of the case, no singular decision was held as a majority. == Background == Previously, the respondent, Robert G. Lile, was charged with the rape of a female high school student. He convinced her to enter his car and, at gunpoint, made her perform oral sodomy on him and at a different location he continued on to rape her. He was then convicted on all charges of rape, aggravated sodomy and aggravated kidnapping in State v. Lile.State v. Lile, 237 Kan. 210, 211-212, 699 P.2d 456, 457-458 (1985). Before he was to be released, officials ordered him to take part in the SATP program to further ensure that upon release he would not rape again. By taking part in the program, participants must fulfill an ‚ÄúAdmission of Responsibility‚Äù form that encompasses the participant's entire sexual history whether or not charges have been brought upon the past acts that are admitted. If the participant refuses, he is then transferred to another prison where he has access to decreased privileges. The results of the SATP form do promote the end goal of the program but is not held as privileged information.  Fifth Amendment  The following three components are necessary to implicate the privilege against self-incrimination: the privilege must ordinarily be invoked, the statement must be incriminating, and the statement must be compelled. The United States Supreme Court held that the privilege against self-incrimination was not self-executing. If a witness ‚Äúdesires the protection of the privilege, he must claim it or he will not be considered to have been ‚Äòcompelled‚Äô within the meaning of the Amendment. ‚ÄùTo qualify as incriminating there must be a ‚Äúreal danger‚Äù of prosecution, and not merely a ‚Äúremote and speculative possibilit[y].‚Äù  Lile's argument  Respondent Lile felt that his Fifth Amendment rights were being infringed upon. By participating in the SATP he was subject to accept responsibility for his past sexual actions. This acceptance of responsibility could have been deemed criminal and could be brought against him thus making him a witness against himself. Officials had previously informed him that his privileges would be reduced from a level III to a level 1 which would amount to, ‚Äùthe automatic curtailment of his visitation rights, earnings, work opportunities, ability to send money to family, canteen expenditures, access to a personal television, and other privileges‚Äù. Lile would also be moved from a medium security prison to a maximum security prison, ‚Äúwhere his movement would be more limited, he would be moved from a two-person to a four-person cell, and he would be in a potentially more dangerous environment‚Äù. He declined to fill out the ‚ÄúAdmission of Responsibility‚Äù form and felt the penalties incurred for nonparticipation in the program was sufficient evidence of unconstitutional compulsion.  State's argument  While the SATP program required admission of a complete sexual history and included a polygraph, the results were solely used for purpose of the program. The SATP is an 18-month program that involves heavy counseling to reduce the chances of the participant's likelihood of recidivism. It relies on the participant's admission of past sexual acts as part of the rehabilitation process. While the results are not privileged, the state has claimed that the results have never been used to charge or prosecute an inmate. The two main reasons the program does not offer immunity for admission of any criminally deemed activity are because the, ‚Äúpotential for additional punishment reinforces the gravity of the participants‚Äô offenses and thereby aids in their rehabilitation‚Äù, and the, ‚ÄúState confirms its valid interest in deterrence by keeping open the option to prosecute a particularly dangerous sex offender‚Äù. The reasoning behind the defendant's decreased privileges was a result in the move of the defendant to a more secure prison facility. The change in facility was brought on because spaces were needed for those who chose to participate in the SATP as it was held at the medium security prison. == Opinion of the Court == The decision was handed down by Justice Kennedy and, ‚Äúconcluded that the SATP serves a vital penological purpose, and that offering inmates minimal incentives to participate does not amount to compelled self-incrimination prohibited by the Fifth Amendment‚Äù. Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justices Scalia, and Thomas joined the majority. Justice O'Connor followed the main holding but disagreed with the rationale in her concurrence. Justice Stevens, joined by Justices Souter, Ginsburg and Breyer, followed with a dissent. The result was a Plurality Opinion.  Plurality opinion  Justice Kennedy delivered the judgment and focused on three different aspects of the state's actions to determine the constitutionality of the SATP. Firstly, the program must have a penological objective and it was found that the SATP did have an objective which included both rehabilitation and deterrence. Second, any consequences faced by those who choose not to participate must relate to the ultimate goals of the program. These consequences were brought forth by the non-privileged aspect of the program. It allows for the participant to realize that their actions have consequences. Lastly, the consequences presented must not cause compulsion and, ‚Äúmust, ‚Äònot constitute atypical and significant hardships in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life‚Äô‚Äù. It was found that, ‚Äúthe penalties facing [the] respondent are the same as those imposed for prison disciplinary violations [which] does not make them coercive‚Äù. It was also found that, ‚ÄúLile was transferred from the prison that offered SATP simply to make room for other inmates who might participate in the SATP‚Äù, and it was not a consequence of his declination of participation. Another contributing factor for why the consequences for Lile not participating in the SATP were not found as compulsory were because the prison sentence was not extended in any way and credit for good behavior or his chances or parole were not affected.  Concurrence  Justice O‚ÄôConnor agreed with the majority but wanted a more useful ruling that covered situations outside of the narrow facts presented in this case. She agreed that moving the defendant to a maximum security prison and decreasing his privileges did not constitute compulsion under the Fifth Amendment. However, she disagreed with the plurality for not setting forth a comprehensive decision about what constituted compulsion under the Fifth Amendment. Justice O‚ÄôConnor felt that the ‚Äúatypical and significant hardship‚Äù standard presented by the plurality should actually be broader. She stated that she does not ‚Äú agree that the standard for compulsion is the same as the due process standard [that was] identified in Sandin v. Conner, 515 U. S. 472 (1995)‚Äù.  Dissent  Justice Stevens‚Äô dissent found that the combined effect of the consequences presented to Lile were, ‚Äúin fact severe, but even if that were not so, the plurality‚Äôs policy judgment does not justify the evisceration of a constitutional right‚Äù. Justice Stevens also felt that alternatives to the SATP program could have been utilized. For example, the state could not prove that confidential treatment would harm the goals of the program. Stevens concluded that, ‚Äú[n]o matter what the goal, inmates should not be compelled to forfeit the privilege against self-incrimination simply because the ends are legitimate or because they have been convicted of sex offenses\\". == See also == * Ainsworth v.

The line links a lower station in the Lugano suburb of Paradiso with an upper station at the summit of the Monte San Salvatore. The top yields a 360¬∞ panorama with views of the city, Lake Lugano, Monte Generoso and the Italian enclave of Campione. The line was built in 1890, and originally used an Abt rack rail for braking. It was rebuilt in 1926, when the two-axle cars were replaced by four-axle cars capable of carrying 70 passengers each, and the Abt rail removed. The cars were again replaced in 1957. In 2001, the line was extensively modernised, with new engine, gearbox, brakes and control system, and the 1957-built cars were given a new modern style body. The line has an unusual configuration of two separate single-track sections, with passengers transferring between cars at an intermediate station in Pazzallo. Each section has a single car, but there is only one engine and machine room which is located at Pazzallo, and the two cars counterbalance each other. The two cars are similar in design, but are not identical, being adapted to the different gradients of the two sections. Just after leaving its lower terminal, the funicular crosses above Lugano-Paradiso railway station on a bridge. This station is some walk to the south of the lower terminal. Urban bus routes 1 and 2 of the Trasporti Pubblici Luganesi (TPL) serve a stop some to the north of the terminal at Paradiso Gerreta. The Monte San Salvatore funicular is one of three operational funiculars within the Lugano area. The other two are the Monte Br√® funicular, which ascends Monte Br√® on the opposite side of the city, and the Lugano Citt√†‚ÄìStazione funicular, which links the city centre with the railway station. == Operation == The line runs every 30 minutes, with a total journey time of approximately 12 minutes.

It was studied by and . It is a generalized quadrangle with parameters (2,2). Its Levi graph is the Tutte‚ÄìCoxeter graph. ==Symmetry== The points of the Cremona‚ÄìRichmond configuration may be identified with the 15=\\\\tbinom{6}{2} unordered pairs of elements of a six-element set; these pairs are called duads. Similarly, the lines of the configuration may be identified with the 15 ways of partitioning the same six elements into three pairs; these partitions are called synthemes. Identified in this way, a point of the configuration is incident to a line of the configuration if and only if the duad corresponding to the point is one of the three pairs in the syntheme corresponding to the line. The symmetric group of all permutations of the six elements underlying this system of duads and synthemes acts as a symmetry group of the Cremona‚ÄìRichmond configuration, and gives the automorphism group of the configuration. Every flag of the configuration (an incident point-line pair) can be taken to every other flag by a symmetry in this group.; . The terminology of duads and synthemes is from , but Sylvester treats these systems of pairs and partitions in the context of a more general study of tuples and partitions of sets, does not reserve special attention to the case of a six-element set, and does not associate any geometric meaning to the sets. The Cremona‚ÄìRichmond configuration is self-dual: it is possible to exchange points for lines while preserving all the incidences of the configuration. This duality gives the Tutte‚ÄìCoxeter graph additional symmetries beyond those of the Cremona‚ÄìRichmond configuration, which swap the two sides of its bipartition. These symmetries correspond to the outer automorphisms of the symmetric group on six elements. ==Realization== Any six points in general position in four-dimensional space determine 15 points where a line through two of the points intersects the hyperplane through the other four points; thus, the duads of the six points correspond one-for-one with these 15 derived points. Any three duads that together form a syntheme determine a line, the intersection line of the three hyperplanes containing two of the three duads in the syntheme, and this line contains each of the points derived from its three duads. Thus, the duads and synthemes of the abstract configuration correspond one-for-one, in an incidence-preserving way, with these 15 points and 15 lines derived from the original six points, which form a realization of the configuration. The same realization may be projected into Euclidean space or the Euclidean plane. The Cremona‚ÄìRichmond configuration also has a one-parameter family of realizations in the plane with order-five cyclic symmetry.; ; . ==History== found cubic surfaces containing sets of 15 real lines (complementary to a Schl√§fli double six in the set of all 27 lines on a cubic) and 15 tangent planes, with three lines in each plane and three planes through each line. Intersecting these lines and planes by another plane results in a 153153 configuration. The specific incidence pattern of Schl√§fli's lines and planes was later published by . The observation that the resulting configuration contains no triangles was made by , and the same configuration also appears in the work of . found a description of the configuration as a self-inscribed polygon. H. F. Baker used the four- dimensional realization of this configuration as the frontispiece for two volumes of his 1922‚Äì1925 textbook, Principles of Geometry. also rediscovered the same configuration, and found a realization of it with order-five cyclic symmetry.This history and most of the references in it are drawn from . The reference to Baker is from . The name of the configuration comes from the studies of it by and ; perhaps due to some mistakes in his work, the contemporaneous contribution of Martinetti fell into obscurity. ==NotesReferences== * *. *. *. *.

After high school, Wingrove was employed as a bank teller and attended Saskatoon Technical College, where she played for its softball team, the Saskatoon Pats. In 1946, during Western league fastball playoffs, she was spotted by an AAGPBL talent scout who invited her to a try out at Pascagoula, Mississippi. She made the grade and was assigned to the Grand Rapids Chicks after spring training, but was loaned out to the Fort Wayne Daisies for a few weeks during her rookie season. After returning to Grand Rapids, she became part of the championship squad in the 1947 season.The Women of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball LeagueEncyclopedia of Women and Baseball1947 Grand Rapids Chicks A light- hitting, good defensive player, Wingrove was able to fill in at all outfield positions, mainly at center field, compiling a .181 career average in 119 games, while committing only seven errors in 147 fielding chances for a solid .952 percentage.

Eventually, sometimes she filled in on the border league men's team when they were lacking players. She retired in 1988 and began to attend AAGPBL Players Association reunions with her spouse. The association was largely responsible for the opening of Women in Baseball, a permanent display based at the Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown, New York, which was unveiled in 1988 to honor the entire All-American Girls Professional Baseball League.

Its purpose is to compensate for occasions when scores deviate significantly from the expected average under normal conditions. Using CSA, players can be added 1, 2 or 3 or subtracted 1 Stableford points to/from their score, which then affects how much their handicap is modified after the competition. The amount of the adjustment is determined by calculating how many players performed much better or much worse compared to their ability, measured as a percentage of all competitors, and then comparing to appropriate tables published by the relevant golf association. Points may be added when scoring is difficult because of bad weather or condition of the course, or conversely a point may be subtracted on days that conditions are particularly favorable for producing good scores. Despite its name, CSA can be applied in all types of stroke play, though the points need to be converted in stableford format beforehand. CSA was formerly a component of the EGA Handicap System. It was replaced by Computed Buffer Adjustment (CBA), which moves the handicap buffer zone instead of adjusting the player's score, in 2013. == References == Category:Golf terminology ","title":"Competition Stableford Adjustment"},{"id":"35302549","text":"Qarkhun (, also Romanized as QƒÅrkh≈´n, KarkhƒÅn, and Kar-Khun) is a village in Chuqur Rural District, Tarom Sofla District, Qazvin County, Qazvin Province, Iran.

She participated in the International Brigades during the Spanish Civil War and the French Resistance during World War II. She was the widow of Artur London, a Czechoslovak communist politician and co- defendant in the Sl√°nsk√Ω Trial. Following her husband's show trial and imprisonment, she became a strong critic of Stalin and Stalinism. London was born √âlizabeth Ricol in Montceau-les-Mines, France, in 1916 to parents from Spain. She became a member of the French Communist Party as a teenager. She moved to Moscow in the Soviet Union, where she first met and then married her husband, Artur London. The couple moved to Spain and joined the International Brigades at the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in 1936. In a 2011 interview with El Pais, London described her involvement with the International Brigade as the \\"best moment\\" of her life, saying, \\"The Spanish people are always in my memories. I am constantly reminded of the Brigades, of my old friends; I dream about them. Spain was an ideal, our most beloved ideal, and it continues to be a valid ideal.\\" Lise and Artur moved to Paris in 1939 following the end of Spanish Civil War and the establishment of Francoist Spain. Nazi Germany soon invaded and occupied France in 1940. Both joined the French Resistance. In 1942, London was arrested and sent to Ravensbr√ºck concentration camp, where she was held prisoner for the remainder of the war. In 1944 she was held with Louise Aslanian, with whom she became friends. Lise London moved to Czechoslovakia with her husband after World War II. Artur London joined the new Communist Czechoslovakian government as a deputy foreign minister. However, her husband fell out with authorities and Stalin, and was sentenced to life in prison during the Sl√°nsk√Ω trial in 1952. He was released in 1956 after Stalin's death and the couple returned to Paris. Artur London would later publish a play about his trial, The Confession, which was published in 1968.

Interested in the uplifting of humanity, she gave close attention to the introduction of school savings-banks into the public schools since 1889. She made an address on the subject in the first meeting of the Women's Council, in Washington, D.C. in February, 1891, which was printed in their \\"Transactions.\\" Her address on school savings banks before the American Academy of Political and Social Science, in Philadelphia, in May, 1892, was printed in pamphlet form by the Academy. Her \\"How to Institute School Savings Banks,\\" \\"A Plea for Economic Teaching \\" and other leaflet literature on the subject had broad circulation. She was widely instrumental in establishing school savings banks in the United States, Canada, Australia and the Sandwich Islands. She was also elected world's and national superintendent of that work for the Woman's Christian Temperance Union (W. C. T. U.), which enlarged its channels. As W. C. T. U. World's Superintendent of School Savings Banks, Oberholtzer hoped to introduce this system in other countries beyond the U.S. ==Early years and education== Sara Louisa Vickers was born in Uwchlan Township, Chester County, Pennsylvania on May 20, 1841. She was a daughter of Paxson and Ann T. Vickers, cultured Quakers of the time. The family were active abolitionists. Besides the hundreds of fugitives assisted on their way to Canada, the home entertained such guests as John G. Whittier, Lucretia Mott, William Lloyd Garrison, and Bayard Taylor. Oberholtzer's ancestors were public-spirited. She naturally came to the front early, taking a prominent part in literary and organization work from childhood. She was educated at Thomas' Friends Boarding School, the State Normal School in Millersville, and by private tutors. ==Career== She began to write for newspapers and magazines at the age of eighteen. She was at that time active president of a soldier's aid society, which rendered efficient assistance to the Union Army during the Civil War. Ill-health interfered with a medical course of study, for which she had prepared. On January 1, 1862, she married John Oberholtzer, of Norristown, Pennsylvania. They resided in Chester County, Pennsylvania until 1883, after which time, their winter home was in Norristown, and their summer residence in Longport, New Jersey. Their children were Ellis Paxson Oberholtzer and Vickers. Ellis was known in the world of letters as editor, economist, historian and biographer. She was president of the Anti-Tobacco Society (organized by her in 1881), Longport Agassiz Microscopial Society (organized by her in 1884), the Soldiers' Aid Society, the World's Woman's Christian Temperance Union, the National Woman's Christian Temperance Union, the Pennsylvania Woman's Press Association (1903‚Äì05), and superintendent of the School Savings Bank of Pennsylvania. Beginning in 1890, Oberholtzer devoted much of her time to the introduction of the school savings banks system into the public schools of the United States and Canada. Her bulletin on ‚ÄúSchool Savings Banks,‚Äù written for the United States Bureau of Education, and printed by the government in 1914, was widely distributed. Files of her Thrift Tidings, a quarterly she issued regularly for the public beginning in 1907, could be found in most public libraries. She was the acknowledged leader of the school savings banks movement, which was established in public schools in nearly every state in the United States and some schools in Canada. Her published books were Violet Lee and Other Poems (Philadelphia, 1873); Come for Arbutus and Other Wild Bloom (Philadelphia, 1882); Hope's Heart Bells (Philadelphia, 1883); Daisies of Verse (Philadelphia, 1886), and Souvenirs of Occasions (Philadelphia, 1892), consisting mainly of poems read by the author on public occasions. A number of poems were set to music by different composers. Among those best known are \\"The Bayard Taylor Burial Ode,\\" sung as Pennsylvania's tribute to her dead poet at his funeral service in Longwood, March 15, 1889, and \\"Under the Flowers,\\" a decoration ode. She wrote extensively for periodicals and magazines on economic subjects, biography, travel, ornithology and other topics, and did considerable local reporting. She was the author of numerous dialogues and charades. She was listed in catalogues of naturalists, and had one of the finest private collections of Australian bird skins and eggs in the U.S. Oberholtzer was one of the speakers at the first meeting of the National Council of Women in Washington, D.C. (1890), at the World's Congress of Women in Chicago in 1893, at the Geneva, Switzerland meeting in 1903, and elsewhere. She aided in instituting the university extension movement, and died February 2, 1930. ==Selected works== At an early age, she began to contribute poems and articles in prose to newspapers and magazines. Among the books she published are: * Violet Lee, and other Poems (Philadelphia, 1872) * Come for Arbutus, and other Wild Bloom (1882) * Hope's Heart Bells, a story of Quaker life (1884) * Daisies of Verse (1886) * Souvenirs of Occasions * Dialogues * Letters of Travel Her songs and hymns, set to music by different composers, were found in hymnals, and many of them in sheet form. ==References== Bibliography * * ==External links== * Category:1841 births Category:1930 deaths Category:19th-century American poets Category:19th-century American women writers Category:20th-century American poets Category:20th-century American women writers Category:American activists Category:American bankers Category:People from Chester County, Pennsylvania Category:American women bankers Category:American women poets Category:Poets from Pennsylvania ","title":"Sara Louisa Oberholtzer"},{"id":"35302706","text":"Chubeh (, also Romanized as Ch≈´beh, Ch≈´bah, and Chubakh) is a village in Khandan Rural District, Tarom Sofla District, Qazvin County, Qazvin Province, Iran.

In this model type, classes are aggregate in cells called components, that execute a role similar to the function in the structured programming, a way of processing information contemporary to the relational database model. So the component-orientation mixes a set of features of its predecessor models. Understanding it is simpler while thinking of the visual component, that is an applicationor even a small application or applet which not being deployed into an executable or bytecode but otherwise turned to be linked by an icon inside another application, icon when one clicks on it implements certain tasks. Then this concepts can be extended to non-visual components. In database activities, the component, visual or not, is an aggragate of classes, in the sense of OO, that can be linked to other ones by adapters. As after the OO model conception data and code programming code are mixed in a cohesive body, there are some difficulties in conceiving where the CODB and CO programming are separate one from the other. Although this enigma is important in conceptual epistemological area, in practical data processing there isn't so importance in this question because of usage of mapping models to large scale used software, like the mappings called ORDBMS and CRDB (component-relational database), in which the separation of data and code are still well defined. ==Implementation== In programming activity, the CO is often taken place with large-scale used OO languages (like C++, Java) with mapping adaptation. In designing the paradigm is supported by UML. In data modeling, data administration and database administration, the mapping adaptation is alike the ORDBMS paradigm. The adapted paradigm to component-based models is known as component-relational database (CRDB). ==Advantages== The main advantage of the component-oriented thinking, as seen in early chapters, is the optimization of reusability of work. Going far away from the uses of OO models, the CO paradigm allows the use of ready to use applications as modules to new and bigger projects. It is necessary to regard that these technical features are not achieved in traditional OO models, although the idea of component came up naturally from OO thinking. The basis support notions of OO like encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism not necessarily leads to the idea of reusing applications as modules of new works. The CO thinking also assures that components are fully tested, as a real application, and thus there is in this model the paroxism of reuse, as well as the feature of understanability to end users, as corollary of the app->comp way of realizing the IT works. Even using the same software that are present in OO paradigm, there are many specific consequences in the world of data-oriented activities. In analogous way, whole models composed of classes can be treated as a part (component) of a new more comprehensive model. ==Bibliography== * Buschmann, Frank; Meunier, Regine; Rohnert, Hans; Sommerlad, peter.

It was named after Guilliame Demorest (12 February 1769 ‚Äì 10 December 1848). Once much larger, it currently has a population of approximately one hundred. A formerly much larger (but now small) creek (known locally as \\"The Crick\\") which once powered mills fed by Fish Lake, flows through the center of town and has now been protected under the Demorestville Conservation Area. ==History== In 1783 explorer Guilliame Demorest crossed the Bay of Quinte where he followed a stream flowing from an inland lake. Finding it full of fish, he gave it the name \\"Fish Lake\\", the name it has retained since. Heading back downstream he built his home near the site of a small waterfall, which became the first building in Demorestville. This home also served as the town's first church under Wesleyan Methodist minister Thomas Madden, who also preached in the mill founded by Demorest. The town grew quickly, adding a grist mill, a sawmill, an ashery, a plow shop, a tannery, a carding and fulling mill, six general stores, three blacksmiths, furniture factories, clothing and show manufacturers, blacksmiths, and even a carriage shop building buggies. It also boasted the County's first grammar school, a newspaper, The Criticizer, and the first canning factory in Ontario to process tomatoes (founded by magnate Willington Boulter). This canning factory is now the location of Sophiasburgh Central School. In the early part of the century Demorestville was considered the most prominent city west of Kingston and was at the time larger than both York (now Toronto) and Meyer's Creek (now Belleville). In 1898 a phone line was built between the Grant Sprague's farm on neighbouring Big Island three kilometres away which drew people \\"wanting to see this modern marvel\\". However, in addition to three churches, the town had a less \\"Christian\\" side as well. In the 19th Century, Demorestville became known as \\"Sodom\\" or as the twin towns of \\"Sodom and Gommorah\\", a name still retained by Gommorah Road which circles the north west border of the village. This name was earned due to its reputation as a sin city of ill-repute with many taverns, brothels, and hotels servicing both the smugglers and the thriving lumber industry. Much like the Biblical story, \\"Sodom\\" was all but destroyed in a massive fire near the turn of the twentieth century, and with the mills gone and local businesses decimated, few chose to remain and the town was never rebuilt. Since then it has overgrown with forest and only a tiny population remains in this tiny village that was once one of Canada's largest metropolises. ==References== Category:Communities in Prince Edward County, Ontario ","title":"Demorestville, Ontario"},{"id":"35302841","text":"Kalaj (, also Romanized as KƒÅlaj; also known as KƒÅlach and Kelaj) is a village in Mian Band Rural District, in the Central District of Nur County, Mazandaran Province, Iran.

On September 12, 2012, he was acquitted of all charges by the Appeals Court. Many experts came forward supporting Puracal's innocence including the California Innocence Project, former DEA agent Thomas Cash, former Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada Irwin Cotler and Freedom Now founder and human rights attorney Jared Genser. Puracal's case is being managed by The David House Agency, an international crisis resource agency based in Los Angeles. On September 12, 2012 he was one of 12 people whose charges were vacated, according to his legal team and a judicial order signed. As of September 14, 2012, he has left Nicaragua and returned to the U.S. ==Case facts== According to media reports, on November 11, 2010, police entered Puracal's home and office, taking him into custody. Puracal was charged with international drug trafficking, money laundering and organized crime. After being held in police custody for 8 months, on August 29, 2011, Puracal was convicted of all counts. According to taped interviews on the Today show, former DEA Agent Tom Cash believes that there was an astounding lack of evidence presented by the prosecution. After reviewing the case, he believed no financial relationship was found between Puracal and the other defendants and that the evidence of money laundering was a misunderstanding of what a real estate escrow account is. This lack of evidence prompted the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention to rule that Puracal's imprisonment was, indeed, arbitrary and called for his immediate release. Further political figures have come forward in support of Puracal, including Congressman Adam Smith. Smith has publicly stated \\"They presented no evidence of a crime here. They have simply kidnapped and held him for a period of time and that is not in compliance with international law, it's not even in compliance with Nicaraguan law.\\" Puracal was sentenced to five years for organized crime, seven years for money laundering and ten years for international drug trafficking, totaling 22 years. Since his sentencing, Puracal has been held in La Modelo maximum-security prison outside of Managua. The appeals hearing for Puracal and his 10 co-defendants began On August 16, 2012. On September 12, 2012, he was acquitted of all charges by the Appeals Court. == Case significance == Puracal's story has received a significant amount of media attention because of claims of lack of evidence and precedent set by the conviction. Justin Brooks, director of the California Innocence Project said, \\"If the United States government does not vigorously fight for Jason's immediate release, other countries will realize all they have to do is call any case a 'drug' case and our government will not fight. They will know they can confiscate your property, throw you in prison and you will be powerless. We will all be at risk when we travel.\\" United States Congressman Adam Smith said that Puracal's arrest is tantamount to kidnapping. The three American hikers freed from Iran have spoken out against the American's conviction. == History of wrongful imprisonment == This is the second major international trial of an American living in San Juan del Sur, Nicaragua. American Eric Volz was wrongfully convicted in the same town. After being imprisoned for 14 months, he was exonerated in December 2007. The New York Times said the Volz trial made a \\"spectacle of the courts\\". Volz is now the managing director of The David House Agency and has been identified in the media as the case manager leading the efforts to free Puracal. == United Nations petition == On January 18, 2011, Puracal's sister, attorney Janis Puracal, along with co-council Jared Genser, filed a petition in the United Nation Working Group on Arbitrary Detention arguing that Puracal's August 29, 2011, conviction violated international law. The petition also urged the United Nations to take \\"urgent action\\" in the case, citing \\"physical abuse and the denial of food, water and proper medical care\\" inside the prison. ==References== Category:Living people Category:American people imprisoned abroad Category:Nicaraguan prisoners and detainees Category:1977 births Category:Wrongful convictions ","title":"Jason Puracal"},{"id":"35302846","text":"Kashkevar () is a village in Khandan Rural District, Tarom Sofla District, Qazvin County, Qazvin Province, Iran.

It would have been entrusted to the United Kingdom but was superseded by the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty, an agreement between Britain and Iraq with some similarities to the proposed mandate. The proposed mandate was awarded on 25 April 1920, at the San Remo Conference in Italy in accordance with the 1916 Sykes‚ÄìPicot Agreement, but was not yet documented or defined.The new Cambridge modern history. Volume xii. p.293. It was to be a class A mandate under Article 22 of the Covenant of the League of Nations. A draft mandate document was prepared by the British Colonial Office in June 1920, and submitted in draft form to the League of Nations in December 1920. Immediately after the end of World War I, Sir Arnold Wilson, the future High Commissioner to Iraq, recommended the annexation of Mesopotamia to India \\"as a colony of India and the Indians, such as the government of India administer it and gradually cultivate its vast plains, and settle the warrior Punjab races in it.\\" In a memorandum written on 22 April 1918, Cox listed the social groups that the British should support: the Jewish community in Baghdad, the notables in Baghdad and Basar, the rich landowning Arabs and Jews, and the Shaikhs of sedentary tribes. Mosul was added to the region of British influence following the 1918 Clemenceau‚ÄìLloyd George Agreement. The proposed mandate faced certain difficulties to be established, as a nationwide Iraqi revolt broke out in 1920, after which it was decided the territory would become the Kingdom of Iraq, via the Anglo-Iraq Treaty of October 1922. The Kingdom of Iraq became independent in 1931‚Äì1932, in accordance with the League of Nations stance, which stated such states would be facilitated into \\"progressive development\\" as fully-independent states. The civil government of British-administered Iraq was headed originally by the High Commissioner, Sir Percy Cox, and his deputy, Colonel Arnold Wilson. British reprisals after the murder of a British officer in Najaf failed to restore order. British administration had yet to be established in the mountains of north Iraq. The most striking problem facing the British was the growing anger of the nationalists, who felt betrayed at being accorded mandate status. ==Maps== File:Lawrence of Arabia's map, presented to the Eastern Committee of the War Cabinet in November 1918.jpgMap presented by TE Lawrence to the Eastern Committee of the War Cabinet in November 1918Lawrence's Mid-East map on show File:Middle East in 1921, UK Government map, Cab24-120-cp21-2607.jpgBritish Map appended to 1921 CAB24/120 cabinet memorandum showing proposed mandates ==Further reading== * Dodge, Toby \\"Inventing Iraq\\" (2009) * Fieldhouse, David K.

A spin bowler, he bowls left-arm orthodox spin, and bats left-handed. He made his first-class debut for Cardiff MCC University against Somerset in 2012 before making his debut for Somerset in the tour match against the South Africans later in the summer. ==Early life and education== Leach was born in Taunton, England on 22 June 1991, and attended Trinity School, Bishop Fox's School and Richard Huish College all in Taunton. He used to be employed to park trolleys at a branch of Sainsbury's supermarket in Taunton. At the age of 14, Leach was diagnosed with Crohn's disease. ==Cricket career== Leach graduated from the Somerset County Cricket Club academy in the summer of 2010, prior to signing a professional contract with Somerset. Leach represented Dorset County Cricket Club in the 2010 Minor Counties Cricket Championship, and bowled his side to victory in the final against Lincolnshire taking 6/21 in their second innings. Leach completed his degree at the University of Wales Institute, Cardiff in sports coaching. Whilst attending university Leach represented Cardiff MCCU in 2011 and 2012 making his first-class debut against his county side Somerset in March 2012, bowling 41 overs but failing to take a wicket as Somerset amassed 642/3d. Leach made his Somerset debut in a two-day match against the touring South Africans in July 2012, claiming the prized wicket of Hashim Amla. He made his first-class debut for Somerset in the 2012 County Championship match against Lancashire in August 2012, the rain affected match finished as a draw with Leach claiming Kyle Hogg as his maiden first-class wicket. Further opportunities in the first team were limited for the rest of the 2012 season with the signing of Pakistani spinner Abdur Rehman, and Leach only featured in one further County Championship match and three matches in the 2012 Clydesdale Bank 40, but ended the season ninth in the national first-class averages with 12 wickets at 18.83 runs apiece. Leach spent the 2012‚Äì13 winter playing grade cricket for Valley District Cricket Club in Brisbane, Australia, helping his side to win the T20 competition. Leach returned to Somerset for pre-season on a summer contract and played his first Championship game of the season against Warwickshire due to an injury to first choice spinner George Dockrell; he took his maiden five-wicket haul in the second innings, with 24 of his 44 overs being maidens. ==International career== On 14 February 2018, while playing for the England Lions against West Indies A, Leach achieved match figures of 8-110; in doing so, he beat the previous best figures by an England Lions spinner (Graeme Swann's 8-156). On 16 March 2018, he was called up to England's Test squad for the tour of New Zealand as an injury replacement for Mason Crane.https://www.telegraph.co.uk/cricket/2018/03/16/england-call-jack- leach-replace-injured-mason-crane/ He made his debut in the second Test in Christchurch. In an unusual circumstance, with 1 over left to play during a Test match against Sri Lanka on 15 November 2018, Leach opened England's innings as a nightwatchman, surviving till stumps. He was dismissed for 1 off 11 balls the next morning. In July 2019, in the one-off Test against Ireland, Leach was once again the nightwatchman for England, batting for a single over at the close of day one. England won the Test by 143 runs, with Leach scoring 92 runs, which earned him the man of the match award. He was then recalled for the second Ashes test at Lords, on 14 August 2019, where he scored 6 not out in the first innings and took 1-19 and 3-37 in Australia's first and second innings respectively. England drew the match. Leach scored 1 run in a partnership of 76 with Ben Stokes, to help England win the third Ashes test at Headingley, by 1 wicket. Leach gained a cult following over the summer of 2019, with his glasses being a contributing factor. He regularly cleans them through his innings, and has received free Specsavers glasses for life following his heroics supporting Ben Stokes in the dramatic Headingley test. This cult reputation was enhanced by his behaviour off the pitch, such as leading some of the England team out to recreate his famous run at Headingley after the match. On 29 May 2020, Leach was named in a 55-man group of players to begin training ahead of international fixtures starting in England following the COVID-19 pandemic. On 17 June 2020, Leach was included in England's 30-man squad to start training behind closed doors for the Test series against the West Indies. On 4 July 2020, Leach was named as one of the nine reserve players for the first Test match of the series. ==See also== * List of people diagnosed with Crohn's disease ==References * Category:1991 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Taunton Category:Alumni of Cardiff Metropolitan University Category:English cricketers Category:England Test cricketers Category:Dorset cricketers Category:Cardiff MCCU cricketers Category:Somerset cricketers Category:Marylebone Cricket Club cricketers Category:People with Crohn's disease ","title":"Jack Leach"},{"id":"35302941","text":"Canal Whiteside or Whiteside Channel is a channel in southern Chile, between Dawson Island (to the west) and Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego (to the east).

Illinois, 484 U.S. 400 (1988), is a United States Supreme Court decision in which the Court held that defense witnesses can be prevented from testifying under certain circumstances, even if that hurts the defense's case.. Taylor was the first case to hold that there is no absolute bar to blocking the testimony of a surprise witness, even if that is an essential witness for the defendant, a limitation of the broad right to present a defense recognized in Washington v. Texas (1967). Taylor was the first Compulsory Process Clause case since Washington v. Texas to provide a specific limitation on the right of defendants to force their witnesses to testify. In that case, the Court construed a defendant's right very broadly in his ability to present a defense. Here, however, the Court restricted that ability to comply with court rules, especially if those rules were of equal consequence upon both the prosecution and the defense. This decision was reached over the dissent of three Justices, all of whom felt a defendant's case should not be limited based on an error solely by the defendant's attorney to list appropriate witnesses. ==Background== History of discovery rules Discovery procedures for defendants began with adoption of state laws in the 1920s.. In the following decades, courts began instituting new procedures. In 1962, for example, the California Supreme Court ordered reciprocal discovery rules, without an initial law requiring it.. However, a series of problems surfaced with this judicially imposed system. Not only did both sides refuse to share intended testimony, but no 'alibi notice rule' was fashioned, leading to an unworkable position for both sides. In 1974, the California Supreme Court ordered the legislature to create the discovery system, ending the state's experiment with judicial discovery rule-making.. In 1970, the United States Supreme Court first set down principles in terms of the constitutionality of discovery rules. In Williams v. Florida,. the Court held that Florida's 'notice-of-alibi' rule did not violate the Fifth Amendment.. While the rule in Williams was reciprocal, it was not for another three years before the Court mandated that discovery rules had to be reciprocal as a general principle.. The decision articulated the \\"two-way street\\" approach, that \\"trials be run as a 'search for truth'\\" without either side maintaining \\"'poker game' secrecy for its own witnesses\\".. Along with these decisions that were specific to the discovery process, the Supreme Court broadened the general constitutional rights for defendants in the 1967 ruling of Washington v. Texas. In Washington, the Court incorporated the Compulsory Process Clause against the states, holding that \\"the Constitution is violated by arbitrary rules that prevent whole categories of defense witnesses from testifying\\"... Despite this, the Court did not rule specifically on whether the preclusion sanction was appropriate, instead applying the constitutional standard for an absolutist state law.. Over the next few decades, the Supreme Court rejected attempts to review the sole constitutionality of a preclusion sanction.. Taylor's trial On August 6, 1981, Ray Taylor was arrested for the murder of Jack Bridges in a fight in Chicago. In advance of the trial, the prosecutor submitted a request for all the defense witnesses in the case. The defense attorney for Taylor provided a list of four individuals, which did not include witnesses Alfred Wormley and Pam Berkhalter. When the defendant tried to introduce these witnesses on the second day of the trial, the trial judge sanctioned the defense for failing to put the witness names on the original list provided to the prosecution.. Therefore, it ruled the two unlisted witnesses would not be allowed to testify. The trial judge was specifically frustrated that the witness, Wormley, was known to the defense prior to trial, but was hidden away from the prosecution.. A jury convicted Taylor of the murder charge and the Illinois Appellate Court affirmed. It held that when \\"discovery rules are violated, the trial judge may exclude the evidence which the violating party wishes to introduce\\". The Appellate Court's ruling further gave the trial judge discretion in the appropriate remedy in such a case ‚Äì whether to exclude entirely the 'surprise' witnesses.. Taylor sought a writ of certiorari to the United States Supreme Court to review his case, which was accepted.. == Opinion of the Court == Justice John Paul Stevens wrote the alt=Justice John Paul Stevens Justice John Paul Stevens wrote the opinion, which affirmed the decision of the Illinois Appellate Court, and upheld Taylor's conviction. He began by addressing the position of the state of Illinois, who argued that there is never a Compulsory Process Clause concern when preclusion of a witness is used as a discovery sanction. The Court had held the converse view, Stevens wrote that \\"few rights are more fundamental than that of an accused to present witnesses in his own defense\\". This strong footing of Sixth Amendment values forced the Court to reject the State's absolutist argument. At the same time though, the Court rejected the defendant's broad claim that there could never be preclusion of a defense witness. Stevens wrote that \\"[t]he Compulsory Process Clause provides [the defendant] with an effective weapon, but it is a weapon that cannot be used irresponsibly\\". The whole adversarial process would be destroyed, Stevens argued, if either side could simply refuse to follow the basic rules of the Court. There are \\"countervailing public interests\\" which weigh against the absolute defense position. The broader idea embedded in the opinion was the idea that willful misconduct of an attorney lowers the truthfulness of proffered testimony.. In the instant case, the Court held that a trial judge could hold the \\"presumption\\" that a new witnesses' testimony is perjured due to \\"a pattern of discovery violations\\".. The pattern in Taylor's case was a series of two amendments to the witness list done in bad faith.. \\"It would demean the high purpose of the [Clause] to construe it as encompassing an absolute right to an automatic continuance or mistrial\\", Stevens wrote. As the misconduct of the judge towards the defense counsel did not implicate the Sixth Amendment's Compulsory Process Clause, there was no need to disrupt the lower courts' decisions. Further, even though the defendant was harmed by the defense counsel error, Stevens wrote that such an argument could not excuse the counsel's fault.. Despite the rejection of Taylor's constitutional position, the Court did create the framework for a balancing test for lower courts to use in handling future discovery preclusion questions.. A trial court must balance the defendant's interest in a robust defense with the (i) state's interest in 'efficient' justice, (ii) state's interest in excluding evidence lacking integrity, (iii) state's interest in a strong judicial authority with followed rules, and (iv) the prosecution interest in avoiding prejudice due to a defendant's discovery violation.. Brennan's dissent Justice Brennan's dissenting opinion was joined by Justices Marshall and Blackmun. Brennan argued that the \\"Court's balancing test creates a conflict of interest in every case involving a discovery violation\\" such that a better approach would be to hold that the \\"Compulsory Process Clause per se bars discovery sanctions that exclude criminal defense evidence\\". Brennan quoted at length from Washington v. Texas, a 1967 case which announced broad rights for defendants to present a defense. \\"The exclusion of criminal defense evidence undermines the central truthseeking aim of our criminal justice system\\", Brennan opined, \\"because it deliberately distorts the record at the risk of misleading the jury into convicting an innocent person\\". He went on to argue that simple preclusion of a defense witness was too extreme a penalty for a discovery violation, to the point that it \\"subverts criminal justice by basing convictions on a partial presentation of the facts\\". Blackmun's dissent Justice Blackmun wrote a separate one-paragraph long dissenting opinion. He stressed that \\"the State's legitimate interests might well occasion a result different from what should obtain in the factual context of the present case\\". == See also == * Due Process Clause * Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution ==NotesReferences== * * * ==External links== * Category:Compulsory Process Clause case law Category:Incorporation case law Category:United States Supreme Court cases Category:United States Supreme Court cases of the Rehnquist Court Category:1988 in United States case law ","title":"Taylor v.

He is credited with starting Hawaii's conversion to Christianity. His name was usually spelled Obookiah during his lifetime. His name Henry is sometimes Hawaiianized as Heneri. ==Biography== \`≈åp≈´kaha\`ia was born at Ka\`≈´ on the island of Hawai\`i in 1792. When he was 10, his family was murdered by Hawaiian warriors. In 1807, when Captain Caleb Britnall took him aboard the Triumph, the teenage boy had his first English lessons en route to New Haven, Connecticut, along with fellow Hawaiian cabin boy Thomas Hopu. As a student in the New Haven area, he was looked after in a succession of homes, and worked summers to help earn his keep. The future Reverend Edwin W. Dwight, a senior in Yale College at the time, met him in 1809, when he discovered\`≈åp≈´kaha\`ia sitting on the steps of the college. When \`≈åp≈´kaha\`ia lamented that \\"No one give me learning,\\" Dwight agreed to help him find tutoring. \`≈åp≈´kaha\`ia took up residence with one of Dwight's relatives, Yale president Timothy Dwight IV, a founder of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions, who instructed him in Christian and secular subjects. He had studied English grammar and the usual curriculum in public schools by the time he converted to Christianity in 1815, during the Second Great Awakening. He and other Polynesians and Native Americans requested training to spread the Gospel back home. This inspired the founding of the Foreign Mission School in 1816, administered from Boston by the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions (ABCFM). It had broad support from the residents of Cornwall, Connecticut, where it moved in 1817, and from donors elsewhere in Connecticut, Massachusetts and New York. During its ten years, about 100 students attended: \\"43 Native Americans, 13 Americans (white), and 20 Hawaiians, and other natives of the Pacific. including 2 Chinese\\".Mitchell, Sydney K. 1939. Phases of the History of Cornwall. (Torrington, CT: Cornwall Historical Society 1981). Cited in Sch√ºtz, p.87. Even before this school opened, Edwin Dwight wrote in 1818, \`≈åp≈´kaha\`ia had begun \\"'reducing to system his own native tongue. As it was not a written language, but lay in its chaotic state, every thing was to be done‚Ä¶he had made some progress towards completing a Grammar, a Dictionary, and a Spelling- book.'\\"Dwight, Edwin Wells. 1818. Memoirs of Henry Obookiah‚Ä¶; who died at Cornwall, Connecticut, February 17, 1818. Cited in Sch√ºtz p.88. However, these books no longer exist. Samuel B. Ruggles, one of the First Company of missionaries to Hawaii and a fellow student of \`≈åp≈´kaha\`ia at Cornwall, mentions in an 1819 letter that his own grammar was \\"much assisted by one which \`≈åp≈´kaha\`ia attempted to form.\\" Elisha Loomis, who was to be printer for the first mission, was inspired to join it by reading \`≈åp≈´kaha\`ia's memoirs, edited by Dwight in the year of his death from typhus fever, over a year before the First Company set sail from Boston. \`≈åp≈´kaha\`ia planned to return to Hawaii himself to preach, but contracted typhus fever and died in 1818 in Cornwall at the age of 26. In 1826 the Foreign Mission School was closed by a scandal ‚Äì two interracial marriages were too much for Cornwall residents. But both the school and \`≈åp≈´kaha\`ia were a catalyst for the Sandwich Island Mission and for the first concentrated efforts to analyse the language. ==Re- interment== In 1993, some descendants of \`≈åp≈´kaha\`ia's family decided to return his body from his grave in Connecticut to Hawaii. On Aug. 15, 1993, his remains were laid in a vault facing the sea at Kahikolu Church near the town of Napoopoo, Kona, on the Island of Hawaii. It was the third church established in Hawaii by missionaries inspired by Opukahaia. Hawaii's churches observe the third Sunday in February as a day of commemoration in honor of its first Christian. A plaque at the Cornwall gravesite reads: \\"In July of 1993, the family of Henry Opukahaia took him home to Hawaii for interment at Kahikolu Congregational Church Cemetery, Napo'opo'o, Kona, Island of Hawaii. Henry's family expresses gratitude, appreciation and love to all who cared for and loved him throughout the past years. Ahahui O Opukahaia\\" ==Works== Besides translating the Book of Genesis into Hawaiian, \`≈åp≈´kaha\`ia nearly completed a Hawaiian dictionary, grammar, and spelling book. The Memoirs of Henry Obookiah were published in New York City in 1818 and have been republished by the Woman's Board of Missions for the Pacific Islands several times since the 1960s. They have recently republished the 195-year-old book with a new epilogue of how his body was returned to the Big Island of Hawaii, along with new photographs.http://henryobookiahmemoirs.com ==NotesReferences== * ==Further reading== * Category:1790s births Category:1818 deaths Category:Converts to Protestantism from pagan religions Category:Native Hawaiian people Category:Hawaiian Kingdom Protestants Category:People from Hawaii County, Hawaii Category:Hawaiian Kingdom translators Category:Deaths from typhus Category:Infectious disease deaths in Connecticut ","title":"Henry Opukahaia"},{"id":"35303010","text":"Video statement (2014) Charles Muhamed Huber (born December 3, 1956 in Munich as Karl-Heinz Huber) is a German politician and actor.

It premiered on E4 in the UK on 12 March 2012. The episode is told from the point of view of character Liv Malone. Liv has been partying with her new best friend Alex ever since he arrived in Bristol, but then he disappears for a dirty weekend just when Liv needs him most. She reaches out to her other friends, but finds she is excluded from their lives. With nobody to turn to in her hour of need, Liv is forced to face up to the choices she's made and isn't quite as strong as she believed.http://www.channel4.com/programmes/skins/4od#3298774 ==Plot== Since finding Alex, Liv has been partying non-stop and suppressing her feelings about Grace's death, although she is plagued by occasional visions of her, similar to what Franky and Rich have suffered. After Alex meets an attractive boy named Donovan at a pre-exams party, the two decide to go out to a cottage on the coast together, leaving Liv alone in the house, where she is soon landed with her sister, Maude, by her recently released older sister, Bella. That night, she suddenly begins to suffer a massive stabbing pain in her side, and finds a large lump there, which she is scared might be Uterine cancer or an Ovarian cyst. The pain does not clear up. However, she resists the urge to go to the doctors to find out, and tells only Doug, her headmaster, when he confides in her that he is leaving Roundview to pursue a long sabbatical. With no one else to go to, she attempts to talk to Mini and Franky, but finds that Mini is reluctant to talk to her and she and Franky still have a tense relationship because of the previous incidents with Matty and Nick. After Liv and Franky lock horns in the corridor, and when Liv questions why Franky has never accepted her role in the accident that ultimately led to Grace's death, Franky violently slaps her across the face. Mini decides to tell her about the truth, but Liv interrupts her after she tells her about having had sex with Alo, before she can tell Liv about her pregnancy. She later attempts to talk to Rich, but he is too busy on his revision, which causes her to explode at him for his seeming indifferent to Grace's death. That night, while hanging out in an Occupy Bristol camp, Liv receives a call from Maude telling her that her \\"friend\\" is back, and she rushes home, excitedly expecting to see Alex. But when she enters his room, she is aghast to find that it is, in fact, Matty who has returned. Alex returns the next day and runs into Matty for the first time. Liv reluctantly takes him to Mini's house to see Franky - who emphatically tells him that she doesn't want to see him. Liv once again attempts to speak to Mini, but Mini again responds with her usual coldness. However, something in Liv snaps, and she violently punches Mini twice in the face, before Matty drags her off Mini, who subsequently confesses to being pregnant with Alo's baby. Distraught, Liv runs outside, and is once again attacked by the stabbing pain from the lump in her side. The next day, she goes straight to the clinic, but before a doctor arrives, the sympathetic receptionist offers to take a look at the lump. Upon looking at Liv's side, the receptionist tells her that there is no lump there, and when Liv looks, she finds the same thing - the lump was, in fact, imagined by her due to her fear of death, and the stabbing pain was a physical manifestation of her grief at Grace's death. Realising this, Liv breaks down in tears and finally begins to mourn Grace as the receptionist consoles her. The episode ends with Liv, Maude, Doug and Rich visiting Grace's grave.http://www.denofgeek.com/television/1281037/skins_series_6_episode_8_review_liv.htmlhttp://www.cultbox.co.uk/reviews/episodes/3187-skins- series-6-episode-8-review ==References== Category:Skins (British TV series) episodes Category:2012 British television episodes ","title":"Liv (Skins series 6)"},{"id":"35303201","text":"The Alberta College of Social Workers (ASCW) serves as the regulatory body for the profession of social work in the province of Alberta, Canada. It is among one of 30 healthcare professions legislated under the Alberta's Health Profession Act (HPA). The College provides membership activities that promote the engagement of ethical social work practice as well as policies, programs, and services that enhance the public interest. ==History== The Alberta College of Social Workers represents the whole of the social work profession in Alberta, campaigning for different policies and services that exercise ethical social work application.\\" ;Health Professions Act The Alberta College of Social Workers, first created in the 1961 as the Alberta Association of Social Workers, made continuous efforts, for a series of years, to become part of the Health Professions Act (HPA). This legislation requires professional colleges to follow similar regulations and for the members to apply educational and practice standards. The ACSW attained a prominent breakthrough by becoming a member of the Health Professions Act, on April 1, 2003, by demonstrating meticulous efforts in obtaining mandatory registration, between 2001 and 2003.Whitmore, E et al. 2011. Activism that Works. Halifax, NS: Ferwood Publishing. Becoming a member of the HPA was an important goal for the Alberta College resulting in increased public recognition and credibility as a self- regulated profession. ;Provincial Scale Alberta is one of the provinces to not have official poverty reduction plans enforced provincially as opposed to Ontario, Quebec, Manitoba, Nova Scotia, Newfoundland and Labrador. To compensate, the ASCW delivers reports on the current status of social justice issues. For example, the ACSW Social Policy Framework 2010: Visioning a more equitable and just Alberta, discussed the inequalities and the economic lifestyle as well as the quality of life all across the province. The policy is the second part of the Disparity Gap Project, an initiation to reduce the growing gap between the rich and the poor. Diana Gibson, the lead researcher of the project, presented the following recommendations to Rachel Notley and Harry Chase, members of the New Democratic Party and Liberal Party of Canada respectively: #Long-term, stable funding for social programs #Low cost child- care spaces #Increased effort to affordable housing #Increased benefits to poverty-line rates #Propose to the government to install a living wage policy These are some of the few aspects that the college would like to implement within the province with the goal of providing economic equality. The ACSW participated in protests of budget cuts to public services under the direction of Gil McGowan, president of the Alberta Federation of Labour, on March 21, 2010, and continues to play an active role in the discrimination of social inequality. ;Regional Scale On a regional scale, coordinators from different areas throughout the province stimulate the arrangement of meetings with members of the local community on current matters of interest. Meetings take the form of workshops and events. Regional coordinators provide different activities such as: *Calgary area: competency workshops for all social workers in the area # Dementia: Developing a Positive Perspective # Critical Experiential Social Work # Contemplative End of Life: Introduction and practice for social workers caring for patients who are dying and their families # Sacred Dance # Creating a Foundation for Living an Inspired Life # Lunch Hour Yoga Session *Edmonton area: # Social Policy Framework Presentation: A three-hour presentation about the social policy framework developed by the Alberta College of Social Workers in collaboration with Parkland Institute # A two-day workshop on Racism: Understanding Racism with The Centre for Race & Culture # Families First Edmonton: Making a Difference for Children / Social Work Week Luncheon: A Families First Edmonton Workshop presented by ACSW's Children's Issues Interest Group ==Mission statement== A mission statement offers, to the general public, a summary of the prominent elements being focused on by a social justice organization. A statement consists of both short-term and long-term goals depending on the importance of the issue being identified. Under the Health Professions Act, all professions are required to engage in a series of procedures under the approved schedules and regulations admitted by the Act. The ACSW focuses on the following social justice issues based on the Health Profession Act: # Ensure that the public is protected and offered a voice on social injustices. # Ameliorate and direct social work practices. # Enforce standards for registration, unconditional competence, and standards of practice from all social workers. # Maintain and enforce the code of ethics with the social work profession. # Approve educational programs in respect to registration processes. ==Description of Activities== ;ACSW ANNUAL CONFERENCE Since 2006, attendance at the ACSW Annual Conference attracts more than one thousand social workers. Each event focuses on the ethics and professional practice of social work, making it one of the largest in North America. The Annual Conference has the following goals: #To share social work practice experiences. #To present recent developments and future aspirations within the profession. #To showcase an efficient way of offering care, autonomy, and independence to the population that are looking for social justice and that social workers assist; providing ethical practice. #To provide networking opportunities for social workers. In 2012, the ACSW Annual Conference held in Edmonton, included key-note speaker Brene Brown, named one of \\"The 50 Most Influential Women of 2009.\\" The 2012 conference theme was \\"Social Work: Celebrating the Person and the Professional.\\" Past conference themes included: #2016 Conference Theme: \\"Social Workers Embracing a Diverse and Changing World #2015 Conference Theme: \\"The Art of Cultivating Communities\\" #2014 Conference Theme: \\"Social Work: Person in Environment ‚Äì NOW!\\" #2013 Conference Theme: \\"Shaping our World: Where Social Work and Technology Meet\\" #2012 Conference Theme: \\"Social Work: Celebrating the Person and the Professional\\" #2011 Conference Theme: \\"Social Workers as Nation Builders: Speaking Truth to Power\\" #2010 Conference Theme: \\"Social Workers: Inspired to Serve Humanity\\" #2009 Conference Theme: \\"100 Years of Change and Beyond\\" #2008 Conference Theme: \\"The Courageous Heart of Social Work\\" #2007 Conference Theme: \\"Becoming Your Best Professional Self\\" #2006 Conference Theme: \\"Social Work Matters: Rejuvenating Our Unity and Pride\\" ==Advocacy Activities== ;NO MORE SERVICE CUTS (2001‚Äì2002) In 2001, the No More Service Cuts campaign was initiated by the ACSW to provide awareness of government funding cuts that stemmed the reduction of services for children when the demand had augmented by nine percent. The campaign promoted information on this social issue through the use of billboards, website postings and newspaper advertisements. The significance of the change in the Children's Services budget was inconsequential, but led to an amplified awareness on the Alberta College of Social Workers by the public. ;RAISE INCOME SUPPORT RATES (2001‚Äì2003) In 2002, Raise Income Support Rates campaign was launched, stressing the low rates for income support programs. Awareness was presented through the use of billboard campaigns, website postings, and meetings with government officials and leaders. The increase in the income rate was discreet, but led to the recognition of the college and the invitation to participate in social justice related discussions. ;CLOSING THE DISPARITY GAP (2008‚ÄìPRESENT) Alberta College of Social Workers has significantly contributed to the Closing the Disparity Gap Campaign in efforts to increase economic and financial discrepancies in two phases: #Phase 1: launch a campaign on the issue of Alberta's disparity gap and the impact it holds on social work. #Phase 2: work on attaining positive change in social policies and programs from the foundation of knowledge and awareness fashioned in phase 1. Closing the Disparity Gap has the following goals: #Raise awareness on the issue of the separating gap that contributes to Alberta's social problems #Be proactive and provide different way of closing the gap #Work, in affiliation with the government, to apply efficient social policy programs. Closing the Disparity Gap desires the following outcomes: #Improvement of condition for the individuals being affected by the income disparity #Increased importance of political force for the Alberta College of Social Workers #Enhanced value of the social work profession ;DIGNITY FOR ALL CAMPAIGN Dignity for All is a campaign, developed by the Salvation Army that aspires to make Canada a poverty-free country, providing social security and cohesiveness nationally, by 2020. The campaign works at independent and local levels, reaching one client at a time, providing a sense of community, hope, and belonging for the individuals in need of help. The Dignity for All Campaign includes the following goals : #For the federal government to provide a comprehensive and integrative plan for poverty elimination. #The enactment of a federal act that ensures social development #Provide enough federal revenue to engage in social security. Alberta College of Social Workers is one of the 571 groups and 9143 individuals that support Dignity for All and promotes prominent news and information on the campaign to social work community. On February 14, 2012, Dignity for All hosted \\"What's next: How do we address poverty in Canada,\\" where the ACSW promoted information of the event, on its website, and encouraged all members and active participants of the college to attend. ;CHILD POVERTY AWARENESS Child poverty is a social justice issue that Alberta College of Social Workers dynamically participates in. With the increasing number of children living in poverty, the ACSW looks at different contributing factors that contribute to this issue as well as develop prominent strategies that will reduce poverty rates within families allowing children to live in between conditions. The In This Together: Ending Poverty in Alberta, is a report developed in collaboration between the Public Interest Alberta, Alberta College of Social Workers, and Edmonton Social Planning Council. It looks, in depth, at child and family poverty in Alberta. Together, the organizations work to establish different solutions that will decrease the overall poverty line within the province by : #Implement current concepts that effective #Obtain the government's active support #Provide gender equality #Provide affordable rents and ownerships The Parkland Institute Research in association with the Alberta College of Social Workers created a report on the ACSW Social Policy Framework 2010: Visioning a more equitable and just Alberta. With the ACSW making contributing advances in poverty existing within the province of Alberta and looking at different ways to improve the socio-economic policies, the report evaluated the policy and identified the following aspects: #Causes and Consequences: ## Key aspects of disparity: effects of minimum wage, unemployment rates, social assistance rates ## Key causes of disparity: tax cut agenda, stalled social spending, labour markets, offloading of community services # Solutions such as: ## Strengthen community services, provide a better quality of life for Albertans, invest in house affordability, and protect workers ==Organizational Structure== The Alberta College of Social Worker has a total of 18 staff members including seven social workers on staff. There are several hundred volunteers that serve the ACSW, offering their time in many different spheres within the organization such as: # Regulatory Committees: Clinical Committee, Competence Committee, Professional Social Work Education Board and Registration Committee. # Governance Committees: Executive Committee, Human Resources Committee, Bylaws & Policy Committee and Finance Committee. # Standing & Adhoc Committees: Nominations & Recruitment Committee, Indigenous Social Work Committee, Advocate Editorial Board, Communications Committee and Bursary Committee. # Interest Groups: Annual Conference, Area Coordinators & Regional Events, Children's Issues ‚Äì Edmonton, Children's Issues ‚Äì Calgary, Social Action/ Social Justice ‚Äì Edmonton, Calgary Social Workers for Social Justice, Northern Alberta Gerontology Social Work Interest Group, Gerontological Social Work Action Group ‚Äì Calgary, Social Workers in Health, International Social Work, Private Practice Interest Group and Retired Social Workers. ==References * https://web.archive.org/web/20140714213927/http://www.acsw.ab.ca/images/acsw_chart_12.jpg * http://www.acsw.ab.ca/pdfs/2012_conference_program.pdf * http://www.acsw.ab.ca/pdfs/in_this_together_2011_draft.pdf * http://www.acsw.ab.ca/pdfs/brochure.pdf * http://www.acsw.ab.ca/public/about_us * http://www.acsw.ab.ca/social_workers/members_services_activities/acsw_annual_conference * http://www.acsw.ab.ca/social_workers/members_services_activities/acsw_annual_conference/2012_annual_conference * http://www.acsw.ab.ca/students/td_meloche_monnex_student_scholarship_for_the_acsw_annual_conference * http://www.acsw.ab.ca/social_workers/members_services_activities/acsw_annual_conference/past_conferences/2010_conference * http://www.acsw.ab.ca/social_workers/members_services_activities/acsw_annual_conference/past_conferences/2009_conference * http://www.acsw.ab.ca/social_workers/members_services_activities/acsw_annual_conference/past_conferences/2008_conference * http://www.acsw.ab.ca/social_workers/members_services_activities/acsw_annual_conference/past_conferences/2007_conference * http://www.acsw.ab.ca/social_workers/members_services_activities/advocacy/disparity_campaign * Miller, Pamela.

The book evoked bewilderment as well as praise when first published. Reissued once in 1986, it went out of print in 1990. A paperback was issued by publisher W. W. Norton in 1999. It is considered by many to be Fox's masterpiece. ==Title== The title is derived from a poem by Rainer Maria Rilke called \\"Widow\\". ==Characters== There are five characters, a cast that revolves around the first. #Laura Maldonada Clapper - A 55-year-old faded beauty, twice married and daughter of the widow Alma #Desmond Clapper - her alcoholic husband #Clara - her timid daughter #Carlos Maldonada - her openly gay brother, a failed music critic #Peter Rice - her old friend and book editor ==Plot== The book is broken into seven chapters of unequal length: \\"Drinks,\\" \\"Corridor,\\" \\"Restaurant,\\" \\"The Messenger,\\" \\"The Brothers,\\" \\"Clara,\\" and \\"The Funeral.\\" Alma, the matriarch of the family, has died in a nursing home the day before Laura & Desmond are scheduled to leave on a trip to Africa.

Laura, dramatically and unexpectedly has an emotional outburst, seemingly over nothing, and flees out into the streets. The rest go their separate ways. Later Laura arrives at the hotel completely drenched and emotionally spent. She seems to be on the verge of an emotional collapse. \\"What is it?\\" Desmond cries. \\"My mother is dead,\\" Laura whispers. \\"She's dead...\\" At Desmond's request Peter visits Laura's two brothers, Carlos and Eugenio, to deliver the news. Laura has made it clear to Peter that she doesn't want Clara to be told of the death of her grandmother. \\"In a swirl of accusations and recriminations, thoughtless actions and sleep-deprived conversations, the final movement unrolls swiftly through a long dark night of the soul and into Alma's funeral the next day.\\" ==Publication history== *1976, USA, E.P. Dutton and Co., Inc. , Hardback Her fourth adult novel, The Widow‚Äôs Children was rejected by thirteen publishers before it was finally accepted by Dutton/Plume. ==Literary significance and reception== Although the plot seems simple, almost trivial, \\"what's important is what's going on underneath: what the characters don't say, to each other or to themselves; what they are thinking, what they feel; the long secret history of their uprooted, once Spanish, family. The intensity of those subterranean moments is part of what has kept the novel from dating. Even now it feels startlingly contemporary in its acceptance of multiple forms of sexuality, its sharp focus on the nature of identity and the costs of exile, and its grasp of what we now label \\"dysfunctional families.\\" \\"There is only a little more plot than there is in Woolf's The Waves, and, like The Waves, the swells and falls issue from an ensemble of endlessly interesting people‚Äîthinking about each other, reacting to each other, talking to (and arguing with) each other, trying to connect or to forsake connection. Because most of these people are related, it's also a novel about family, and that Pandora's box of rampant emotions. In bursts of energy, invention, absurdity, and passion, Fox lets those emotions fly out and injure or assuage where they will.\\" ==References== Category:1976 American novels Category:Novels by Paula Fox ","title":"The Widow's Children"},{"id":"35303217","text":"is a 1990 action video game published by Information Global Service (IGS) for the original Game Boy exclusively in Japan on October 12, 1990. It is the first Game Boy title to be published by that company. ==Story== The Dortoise Troops have hidden the ten power-up parts throughout outer space so that Astro Rabby cannot really fly. His creator, Doc, wants Rabby to soar freely in the sky so he asks Rabby to retrieve these special parts from the Dortoise Troops. ==Gameplay== Players must use the platforms to progress through the levels. The concept of Astro Rabby is that the player is a rabbit who has to travel through certain top-viewed levels with automatic scrolling. Since the number of usable platforms are severely limited in this game, learning to control the player's jumps becomes a primary asset. Landing on platforms causes the block to break due to the excess force that the player puts on it. Sometimes, power- ups are given that will extend the relatively short time limit that Astro Rabby offers. A heart is needed in each level in order to progress to the next level; the game is an infinite loop without collecting it. Players have control of a gun with limited ammo. While the jumping height is very short when beginning the game, it becomes longer as the player collects the appropriate power-up item. Enemies can also be avoided in addition to being shot at; making the fantasy violence component in the game completely optional. While larger platforms allow the player to jump farther, the use of power-ups can also improve the character's jumping ability to the player's advantage. ==Reception== On release, Famitsu magazine scored the game a 20 out of 40.„ÅäË≤∑„ÅÑÁâ©„Å´‰æøÂà© : Êñ∞‰Ωú„Ç≤„Éº„É†„ÇØ„É≠„Çπ„É¨„Éì„É•„Éº - „Ç¢„Çπ„Éà„É≠„É©„Éì„Éº.

Both the concept and the term \\"facet\\" were introduced by Paul Costa and Robert McCrae in the first edition of the NEO-Personality Inventory (NEO-PI) Manual. Facets were originally elaborated only for the neuroticism, openness to experience, and extraversion traits; Costa and McCrae introduced facet scales for the agreeableness and conscientiousness traits in the Revised NEO-PI (NEO PI-R). Each of the Big Five personality traits in the five factor model contains six facets, each of which is measured with a separate scale. The use of facets and facet scales has since expanded beyond the NEO PI-R, with alternative facet and domain structures derived from other models of personality. Examples include the HEXACO model of personality structure, psycholexical studies, circumplex models (e.g., Goldberg's Abridged Big-Five Dimensional Circumplex), the Multidimensional Personality Questionnaire (MPQ), and the California Psychological Inventory. == Five factor model ==  NEO PI-R  Costa and McCrae originally developed facet scales for neuroticism, extraversion, and openness to experience to reflect the fact that each broader trait is composed of different aspects of personality. They admit their decisions were somewhat arbitrary and acknowledge that each trait may actually have more or less than six facets. However, they justify their choices with the need for a balance between comprehension and comprehensiveness and research supporting their six facet breakdown of each Big Five personality trait. The following table displays the labels used by Costa and McCrae for each personality domain and its constituent facets. * Neuroticism: Anxiety, Hostility, Depression, Self- consciousness, Impulsiveness, Vulnerability * Extroversion: Warmth, Gregariousness, Assertiveness, Activity, Excitement-Seeking, Positive Emotions * Openness to Experience: Fantasy, Aesthetics, Feelings, Actions, Ideas, Values * Agreeableness: Trust, Straightforwardness, Altruism, Compliance, Modesty, Tender-mindedness * Conscientiousness: Competence, Order, Dutifulness, Achievement Striving, Self-Discipline, Deliberation  Lexical facets  In contrast with Costa and McCrae's admittedly arbitrary decisions, studies guided by the Lexical Hypothesis root facets in the personality language of laypeople. This approach is meant to test, and possibly enhance, the content validity of the measures used. Using the Five Factor Model, Gerard Saucier and Fritz Ostendorf explored each domain's facet structure through lexical studies. Using English and German participants and materials, they found a total of 18 facets, or \\"subcomponents,\\" of the Big Five. These are: * Neuroticism: Irritability, Insecurity, Emotionality * Extroversion: Sociability, Unrestraint, Assertiveness, Activity-Adventurousness * Openness to Experience: Intellect, Imagination-Creativity, Perceptiveness * Agreeableness: Warmth-Affection, Gentleness, Generosity, Modesty-Humility * Conscientiousness: Orderliness, Decisiveness-Consistency, Reliability, Industriousness  Abridged Big-Five Dimensional Circumplex  The standard five factor model conceives of personality as a collection of unidimensional, polar scales. In contrast, circumplex models explore personality as it is constructed in the two-dimensional space created by the intersections of these polar scales. Timothy Leary was the first to apply the circumplex to the study of personality. Following Leary's pioneering work in the 1950s, Jerry Wiggins' Interpersonal Circle was one of the most influential early circumplex models of personality. Despite similarities between the Interpersonal Circle and two of the Big Five, it was only later that the work of Lewis Goldberg with Dean Peabody, and Willem Hofstee and Boele de Raad integrated the circumplex and Five Factor models. The result was The Abridged Big-Five Dimensional Circumplex (AB5C). In place of specific facet labels, Goldberg and his colleagues use Roman numerals, and plus and minus signs corresponding to the two intersecting factors. For example, the facet corresponding to the intersection of extraversion and disagreeableness is represented by \\"I+II‚àí\\". The following tables list adjectives associated with the intersections of high scores (+) and low scores (‚àí) on the Five Factors. Corresponding NEO PI-R labels are provided in parentheses, with adjectives approximating pure Big Five traits (e.g., extraversion, neuroticism) in bold.

It has been used since its development in the Minnesota Twin Family Study. Three of the four broad traits measured by the MPQ contain between three and four facets, or \\"primary traits.\\" The fourth, \\"Absorption,\\" is classified as both a broad trait and a primary trait. In addition to these personality measures, the MPQ contains three scales assessing the validity of responses. The \\"Unlikely Virtues\\" scale is designed to assess impression management, the \\"True Response Inconsistency\\" scale assesses the tendency to answer all questions true (or false), and the \\"Variable Response Inconsistency\\" scale assesses inconsistent responses to similar or opposite questions. The following table displays Tellegen's labels for broad traits, primary traits (facets), and the subscales of Absorption. * Positive Emotional Temperament: Well-being, Social Potency, Achievement, Social Closeness * Negative Emotional Temperament: Stress Reaction, Alienation, Aggression * Constraint: Control, Harm-avoidance, Traditionalism * Absorption (subscales): Sentient, Prone to Imaginative and Altered States  HEXACO Model  The HEXACO Model is a six- factor model of personality. This model was developed in the early 2000s by Michael C. Ashton and Kibeom Lee using lexical studies. The HEXACO Model adds a sixth factor, Honesty-Humility, to five factors similar to those in the Big Five: Emotionality, Extraversion, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, and Openness to Experience. Despite these similarities, the facet structures of traits in the HEXACO Model differ from those in the Five Factor Model. In addition to these trait-specific facets, Ashton and Lee have proposed two \\"interstitial\\" facets located in the space between traits. The first, Altruism (versus Antagonism), is shared by Honesty-Humility, Agreeableness, and Emotionality. The second, Negative Self-Evaluation, is shared by Extraversion and Emotionality. The following table displays the trait and facet labels used by Ashton and Lee. * Honesty-Humility: Sincerity, Fairness, Greed Avoidance, Modesty * Emotionality: Fearfulness, Anxiety, Dependence, Sentimentality * Extraversion: Social Self-Esteem, Social Boldness, Sociability, Liveliness * Agreeableness: Forgivingness, Gentleness, Patience * Conscientiousness: Organization, Diligence, Perfectionism, Flexibility, Prudence * Openness to Experience: Aesthetic Appreciation, Inquisitiveness, Creativity, Unconventionality == References == Category:Personality traits Category:Psychological testing Category:Personality tests ","title":"Facet (psychology)"},{"id":"35303259","text":"Simon Hirschland Bank early 20th century on Lindenallee, Essen Germany The Simon Hirschland Bank was founded in 1841 in Essen, Germany, by Simon Hirschland (1807-1885), who started his business as a merchant, and over the years began to lend money.The History and Fate of the Jews of Essen: A Memorial book to fellow Jews of the city of Essen, by Dr. Hermann Schr√∂ter (circa 1984) The banking business began in 1841; Simon Hirschland also traded in wool, meat, pelts, nails, copper, lead and cattle, from 1 Weber Street.

British Columbia holds cultural sites throughout its geography and is home to many famous aboriginal archaeological sites, such as the Kw√§day D√§n Ts'√¨nchi, which was an archaeological site containing a frozen person in British Columbia's Tatshenshini-Alsek Park. British Columbia archaeological sites are held in accordance with both the Heritage Act and the federal Environmental Assessment Act, which regulates the areas where developers can utilize and where the provincial government can build infrastructure. This process has not been put into place to discourage development, but has been put into place to regulate historic cultural sites in order to retain historic areas, sites, ecofacts, and artefacts. ==Procedures== When applying for permits and assessments in regards to British Columbia development projects, there is an intense procedure that has to be followed, which contains many important steps and approvals. Upon receipt of an application in reference to a project report in regards to the Environmental Assessment Act, the following stages will occur: {  - ! Process ! From ! To -  Initial Screening and to determine branch responsibility  The Manager and Permitting/Assessment Section  Project Officer -  Review of Application; including maps, reports, and/or archaeological inventory  Project Officer  No Exchange -  In the case that archaeological sites would not be impacted, the file would exchange hands away from the archaeological assessment department of British Columbia Project Officer  Project Assessment Director (EAO) -  When archaeological impact is plausible, the project committee would be produced for a review of the said application  Project Officer  Project Committee -  After the detailed project review, the project committee can take one of three steps 1) Certify the project 2) Not certify the project 3) refer the project to the Environmental Assessment Board for a public hearing  Project committee  Appropriate ministers -  Where a public hearing is directed and unresolved archaeological resource management issues remain, the Project Officer will address these in the terms of reference for the hearing Project Officer  Hearing - } When in receipt of a development referral, the following procedure will be undertaken by the British Columbia, Archaeological Assessment office, in accordance with the Heritage Act and the Environmental Assessment Act: {  - ! Process ! From ! To -  Assignment of application for referral to be reviewed  Manager and Archaeological Permitting/Assessment Section  A project Officer -  In the process of reviewing the application, the project officer may utilize provincial archaeological inventory, maps, air photos, and/or reports  Project Officer  No exchange -  Project Officer responds to the referral within the time specified  Project Officer  No exchange -  If the proposed project is likely to damage archaeological resources in accordance with the Conservation Act, the project officer will advise for an archaeological impact assessment to take place before starting the development  Project Officer  Referral agency is advised, but no exchange occurs. -  In limited risk cases, the project advisor details a process that should be undertaken if archaeological remains or sites are encountered by the development crew  Project Officer  Referral Agency/Proponent is advised of procedure, no exchange occurs. -  Where damage is unlikely, the referral department/proponent are notified that development can proceed as proposed  Archaeological Assessment Officer  Referral Agency/Proponent - } ==Heritage Conservation Act== The British Columbia Heritage Conservation Act has been put into place in order to protect provincial heritage sites, objects, and other heritage property determined suitable by the Provincial Government of British Columbia. In a simpler sense, this act has been put in place to record and maintain historic buildings in British Columbia that hold significant importance to the history and culture of British Columbia, for both aboriginal and non-aboriginal lineage. First Nations of British Columbia have the ability to make an agreement with the Provincial Government under this act to protect what they may classify as a cultural or heritage site, these applications by First Nations must be approved by the Lieutenant Governor in Council of British Columbia. If there is another provincial act that conflicts with the interests of this act, in regards to heritage sites within British Columbia this Heritage Conservation Act will prevail. With the consent of the Lieutenant Governor in Council the minister may establish and distinguish heritage classifications and policies in accordance with heritage sites and object(s) managed by the government. The Heritage Conservation Act of British Columbia can delegate essentially what qualifies as historical and can claim any unclaimed historical and/or cultural property and call it as its own. The result of the object or site, can end up in a museum or as a preserved site by the Provincial Government of British Columbia. Essentially this act would provide certainty to the preservation of archaeological artefacts and would protect the area, along with the excavated arte/ecofacts found during an archaeological excavation, a development, and/or a discovery. ==Environmental Assessment Act== The Environmental Assessment Act is enforced by the provincial government of British Columbia and by the British Columbia Environmental Assessment Office. Under this act, the proposed development is not to occur or progress until an environmental certificate is authorized by the Environmental Assessment Office, when classified as a \\"reviewable project\\". If a project is designated to occur on treaty land, even with the authority of the Environmental Assessment Office no development is to occur until consent is given by the treaty First Nations band, and if authorization is not granted, the project will be stopped from operating on said treaty land. When determining a need for an environmental assessment certificate, the executive director may determine that the project may proceed without an assessment certificate, in the conditions that no adverse environmental, social, or cultural damage would occur. The executive director can also call for the need of an environmental assessment if he or she determines that there would be adverse effects on cultural, social, or other significant environmental factors. The executive director essentially has a lot of control under the determination of environmental assessments, including determining the hazard ratio of reviewable projects under his or her expertise. The executive director also would advise the proponent of their decision and for required documentation for him or her to make their final decision. All environmental assessment agreements with the federal or other provincial governments will be made through the provincial minister of British Columbia and can be approved or denied by the minister. With written notice by the minister, any individual holding consent of the minister may enter a reviewable site and inspect it as guided by the sanctions of the provincial Environmental Assessment Act. If a proponent begins with the operation of their project, the Environmental Assessment Act along with the Environmental Assessment Office has the authority to dismantle, modify, or cease the continuance of this project, as set forth by the laws included with this assessment act. If a said project goes forward without the consent of the Environmental Assessment Office, the minister may apply to the Supreme court to enforce the decision of the Environmental Assessment Office in accordance with the Environmental Assessment Act. If the proponent does not cease their acts that are not in compliance with rule 41, they may be liable to pay $100,000 on their first offence, $200,000 on their subsequent offences if a corporation, $100,000 (plus 6 months of jail time)/$200,000 (plus 12 months of jail time) for subsequent offences for individuals. ==Kw√§day D√§n Ts'√¨nchi Project== The Kw√§day D√§n Ts'√¨nchi or in translation \\"long ago person found\\" is an archaeological excavation that has occurred in the Tatshenshini-Alsek Park, which is part of the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations (CAFN), this person was found by hunters in 1999. This project holds a significant tie to the British Columbia Archaeological Assessment office due to their involvement in organizing the excavation team and their involvement in assuring the proper recovery of this body. The body that was recovered by archaeologists was radiocarbon dated back roughly 550 years ago, predating the voyage of Christopher Columbus to the New World, and dating to approximately 300 years before the arrival of Europeans on the Northwest Coast.

With cooperation of the First Nations community of this area and a team of forensic anthropologists, the Kw√§day D√§n Ts'√¨nchi was said to have died on a glacier, which quickly incorporated and preserved his body, where he would lie for hundreds of years, until several hunters would discover his remains.

The fund was established in October 2008 and became active in January 2009. It had an initial endowment of ‚Ç¨25 million. Proceeds from the endowment are directed to projects to conserve threatened and endangered species of animals, plants and fungi around the world. It gave more than $2.4m in 2010 to 214 projects in almost 80 countries. From 2009 to summer 2019, the MBZ Fund has supported 1,982 projects with $18.5 million dollars across more than 150 countries. Grant applications are submitted and managed through its website www.speciesconservation.org. Applications are reviewed three times per year by an independent board of advisers who make funding recommendations to the MBZ Fund's board of directors. The MBZ Fund accepts applications for grants requesting less than $25,000 per year for projects that engage in direct boots-on-the-ground, get-your-hands-dirty species conservation. The MBZ Fund is potentially interested in applications from any country and for any species type (amphibian, bird, invertebrate, fish, fungus, mammal, plant, reptile), particularly those that are threatened but do not normally receive conservation attention. ==Conservation Highlights== As of September 2019, the Mohamed bin Zayed Species Conservation Fund has supported 1,982 projects with $18.5 million dollars. Over the past several years, the fund has provided an average of an additional $1.5 million dollars each year to as many as 200 projects. There are many examples of its grant recipients rediscovering 'lost' species including a frog species in Zimbabwe known as the Cave Squeaker (Arthroleptis troglodytes) which had not been seen in 55 years and the Cropan's boa (Corallus cropanii) in Brazil which had not been seen in 64 years. Many grant recipients have discovered 'new' species including a species of woodlizard Enyalioides binzayedi was discovered through the support of the fund to the expeditions leading to the discovery of the specie in the Cordillera Azul National Park in Peru; and in 2017, a rare and majestic species of maple tree was discovered and named Acer binzayedii through the support of the fund and found in the mountainous cloud forest of Jalisco in Western M√©xico. As of September 2019 825 grant recipients highlight their projects through case studies published on the MBZ Fund website. ==Other Conservation Projects== The MBZ Fund was selected as the executing agency for the $5.8 million dollar Global Environment Facility funded Dugong and Seagrass Conservation Project - a project to protect dugong and their seagrass habitats across eight countries including Madagascar, Mozambique, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, Indonesia, Timor-Leste, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu. The project was completed in December 2018. The MBZ Fund, in collaboration with the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, has also supported the reintroduction of the Attwater Prairie Chicken in Oklahoma, USA. The MBZ Fund has also managed the interests of the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi in the big cat conservation through a donation to Panthera in support of its Global Alliance for Wild Cats conservation project. ==References== Category:Conservation projects Category:Nature conservation in the United Arab Emirates ","title":"Mohamed bin Zayed Species Conservation Fund"},{"id":"35303318","text":"The Oikos University shooting occurred on April 2, 2012, when a gunman shot at people inside Oikos University, a Korean Christian college in Oakland, California, United States. Within a few hours, the number of reported fatalities reached seven.(April 2, 2012). Death toll rises to 7 in Oakland religious school shooting, Los Angeles Times One L. Goh, a former student at the school, was taken into custody and identified as the suspect in the shooting. Along with the California State University, Fullerton massacre, this was the fourth-deadliest university shooting in United States history, after the Virginia Tech massacre, the University of Texas Clock Tower shooting, and the Umpqua Community College shooting, and the ninth-deadliest U.S. school massacre overall. It is the deadliest mass killing in the city's history. ==Details== The shooting happened at approximately 10:30 a.m. Pacific Daylight Time, when a gunman opened fire with a .45-caliber semi-automatic handgun with four fully loaded 10-round magazines on the university's campus, located at the Airport Business park in East Oakland, near the Oakland International Airport. The gunman stood up in a nursing classroom while class was in session, ordered classmates to line up against the wall, and fired at them. The shooter was reported to have said \\"Get in line ... I'm going to kill you all!\\" before opening fire, according to a witness. Six students and a professor were killed, and three others injured. The attacker continued to fire shots as he fled the campus, driving away in a car belonging to one of the victims. Hours later, he surrendered to authorities at a Safeway supermarket in the nearby South Shore area of Alameda, about five miles away from the scene of the shooting. ==Perpetrator== One L.

In February 2002, he legally changed his name to One Goh because he felt his birth name sounded \\"like a girl's name.\\"Associated Press (April 5, 2012). Calif. school shooting suspect changed name because his birth name sounded 'like a girl.' Washington Post Goh later moved from Virginia to the San Francisco Bay Area, where he took up residence in Castro Valley and Oakland. His mother Oak-Chul Kim also lived in Oakland, while his brother Su-Wan Ko, a non-commissioned officer in the United States Army, and another brother Su- Kwon remained in Virginia. On March 8, 2011, Su-Wan was killed in an automobile accident in Virginia while on assignment for the George C. Marshall Center. Later that year, his mother returned to Seoul, South Korea, where she died as well. While a student at Oikos University, Goh had disciplinary problems, and was asked to leave the school a few months prior to the shooting. Howard Jordan, the chief of the Oakland Police Department, said that Goh was angry at the administration after being expelled from the university, as well as having his request for a pro-rated tuition fee reversal on his $6,000 payment denied by Ellen Cervellan, one of the school's administrators. School officials later said he had not been expelled.La Ganga, Maria L.; Stevens, Matt (April 4, 2012). Oakland shooting suspect called loner, loser. Los Angeles Times Jordan said Goh went to Oikos with \\"the intent of locating [an] administrator\\", but when learning she was not there, he opened fire at random people. Jordan said Goh \\"was also upset that students in the past, when he attended the school, mistreated him, disrespected him, and things of that nature.\\" Goh died on March 20, 2019, while in custody at California State Prison-Sacramento. The Sacramento County coroner's office investigated the cause of Goh's death.https://abc7news.com/5220666/ As of April 9, 2019, the coroner did not release the results of its investigation. == Hearings == Goh was arraigned before Judge Sandra Bean of the Alameda County Superior Court on April 4 and charged with seven counts of murder and three counts of attempted murder, but did not enter a plea at the time. In interviews, Goh apologized for the shooting, stating that he did not remember many parts of the day in question and that it was difficult for him to speak about it. He was also hospitalized, and began refusing to eat; three weeks after his arrest, county sheriffs reportedly considered the possibility of obtaining a court order to have him fed forcibly through a feeding tube. Goh later resumed eating, though he had lost . On April 30, he appeared before Judge Bean again and entered a not guilty plea through his public defender David Klaus. If convicted, Goh would be eligible for the death penalty under California law due to enhanced penalties for special circumstances which could apply to his case, including the commission of multiple murders and the commission of murder during a carjacking. Goh's pre-trial hearing was originally scheduled for June 30. It was eventually held on October 1 before Judge Carrie Panetta. Klaus argued that Goh was not mentally competent to stand trial, and so Panetta ordered that the hearing be adjourned until November 16 so that a competency evaluation could be conducted. Goh used the services of a Korean interpreter during the hearing, and briefly disrupted the proceedings with an outburst when Klaus began speaking about Goh's mental competence. The court appointed two psychiatrists to evaluate Goh. The hearing resumed on November 19 to discuss the report of the first psychiatrist, which was completed on schedule. According to Klaus' statements, that report concluded that Goh had suffered from paranoid schizophrenia for up to a decade and a half, and that he lacked the ability to cooperate with his public defender due to his incomprehension of the criminal justice system. The report of the second psychiatrist was not yet complete by that time, so proceedings were again suspended until January 7, 2013. Goh refused medication while in jail. The second psychiatrist's report presented at the January 7, 2013 hearing also concluded that Goh suffered from paranoid schizophrenia. On that basis, Panetta ruled that Goh was unfit to stand trial, and ordered that he be confined to a mental institution for treatment, with further competency reviews to be held every ninety days. An additional hearing was scheduled for January 28, 2013. Alameda County District Attorney Nancy O'Malley has not yet concluded whether she will seek the death penalty for Goh if and when he goes to trial. On August 26, 2014, an Alameda County grand jury indicted Goh on seven counts of murder and three counts of attempted murder but as of September 9, 2014, he was still assessed as mentally incompetent for trial. During a hearing on December 2, 2015, Goh expressed his wish for the death penalty, though the attorneys on both sides are unsure whether he feels genuine guilt or still suffers from delusions. In May 2017, Goh pleaded no contest in the shooting. On July 14, 2017, Goh was sentenced to seven consecutive life sentences plus 271 years in prison, all without any possibility of parole. ==Victims== Seven people were killed and three were injured.

The episode is told from the point of view of character Nick Levan. Nick is desperately in love with Franky, but it's a one-way street. He has no choice but to accept Franky as his friend and nothing more, while his love for her grows with each passing day. Then Matty gets in touch - he's still in love with Franky and needs Nick's help to get him out of Morocco and back to Bristol. Ever loyal, Nick tries to put his feelings for Franky aside and agrees to help his brother. Torn between his love for Franky, his loyalty to Matty and his fear of confrontation, Nick's life begins to spin wildly out of control until he has no choice but to step up and discover what he's truly capable of. ==Plot== Nick and Franky have never been closer - she relies on him as support for her and his love for her is getting more intense with every passing day. Despite this, Franky gives off no signs of reciprocating his feelings, and the subject of love is still difficult for her since Luke. One day, Nick receives a Skype call from Matty in Morocco - he has found someone to smuggle him back into the country, and he asks a very reluctant Nick to visit a Russian man, known only as \\"The Doctor,\\" to pay him. Nick visits \\"The Doctor,\\" and learns that he will have to pay ¬£2,000 - which he does not have. Nick is distressed, and Franky notices during a chemistry lesson. She attempts to get him to talk, but he does not mention his problems, or even that Matty is trying to return. He later joins the rest of the gang (minus Franky) at a nightclub, where he blows his money on alcohol, and Alex convinces him to seduce a girl named Carly. However, the next morning, Franky turns up at his house and discovers him with Carly, and leaves in a huff. Carly also leaves, observing that he is clearly in love with Franky, but also that she reciprocates. After receiving an angry call from Matty, Nick breaks into his father's bank account and takes ¬£2,000 to \\"The Doctor,\\" but he informs him that he needs an extra thousand. Nick is outraged, but has no choice. He leaves, and, desperate for someone to talk to, he calls Alo, who is still at the nightclub from the night before. There, he informs the gang about his situation, but they merely chide him for constantly following his brother; he loses his temper and storms off. Franky follows him and demands to know why he didn't tell her about Matty returning. They get into an argument, which ends with Nick pouring his entire heart out to her about how he feels. Franky is shocked, but merely says that she doesn't feel the same way, and he storms off, and kisses Alex on his way out as a means of apology. Nick decides to step up, and returns to \\"The Doctor,\\" storms into his office and searches for his money, but it has already been put into the bank. \\"The Doctor\\" overpowers Nick and pins him to the floor. He tells Nick that he is a good man, but his loyalty to Matty is a weakness, before informing him that the deal is off, and letting him leave. Nick returns home, but finds he doesn't have his key. Franky, however, turns up with it - she had picked it up off the floor the night before. She hands him ¬£1,000 to fly Matty in, but he informs her that the deal is off. Franky then asks what he wants from her instead, and he slowly replies \\"Franky, you are the most beautiful person I have ever seen.\\" She finally reciprocates his feelings, and they make love upstairs in his room.

It aired on Fox in the United States on April 1, 2012. ==Plot== Bob has a classic arcade game called Burgerboss installed in the restaurant in the hopes that the game can help them make enough money to buy a new vent hood for the kitchen, with Linda thinking that they can use the money to get sailing lessons. Since the game is one of Bob's favorites from when he was younger, he decides to take it for a test run. Jimmy Pesto notices the new addition to Bob's Burgers and, being an aficionado of Burgerboss himself, decides to play a round. Jimmy plays so well that he gets the top overall score, but when he goes to enter his name he puts \\"BOB SUX\\" instead to taunt his longtime rival. After unplugging the machine and then plugging it back in fails to reset the score, an angry Bob decides to try and knock \\"BOB SUX\\" off the leaderboard despite Linda's worry that this is going to turn into another \\"peeing race\\" between the two. Bob dismisses Linda, correcting her by saying that it is actually a pissing contest, and plays the game nonstop for most of the next few days, including after hours, until Teddy notices that he may be suffering from \\"the carpal tunnels\\" because his fingers are all crooked from the repetitive strain. Bob visits a doctor, who puts him on painkillers and gives him wrist braces to wear to alleviate the pain but, in spite of this, refuses to stop playing. Linda puts her foot down and has the arcade machine taken out of the restaurant, driving Bob into a rage because now he cannot knock Jimmy Pesto off the board and Jimmy mocks Bob for it. Undeterred, Bob decides to track the game down and finds it at a local arcade called Family Funtime. The security guard on duty refuses to let him in, however, because the arcade policy does not allow adults to enter without a child present. Bob quickly returns home to grab Tina, Gene, and Louise and tells Linda they have a \\"thing\\" to go to, letting her believe they are going to their first sailing lesson. Instead, he takes them to Family Funtime so he can get back to playing Burgerboss. Bob buys a bunch of game tokens and hands out one to each of the kids, but since they cannot play any games with one token, Louise suggests they pass the time by crashing birthday parties. While Bob is playing the game, a kid walks up to him and watches his progress. After Bob tells him to go away, he warns Bob of an oncoming enemy and Bob loses his last life when he cannot kill it in time. When Bob wonders how the kid knew, he looks around to see that he is dealing with the person who has the high score on every other machine in the arcade, \\"DRL\\". Embarrassed, Bob seeks the advice of the kid, whose name is Darryl, on how to play better. Darryl can relate, considering that Jimmy Pesto is to Bob what a rich kid named Tyler is to him, a bully, and agrees to help him on the condition that Bob beats up Tyler for him. Over the next few days, Bob and the kids return to Family Funtime multiple times. Bob continues to get better at Burgerboss, while also abusing his painkillers to the point where he becomes high and hallucinates, while the kids keep enjoying themselves at birthday parties. Eventually, though, the kids run out of energy having crashed just about all the parties they can stomach and Louise decides they should crash the Commodores' Ball at the yacht club next door. Around the same time, Tyler comes into Family Funtime looking for Darryl. In a panic, Darryl dresses up a drugged up Bob like a tough guy and commands him to \\"kick his ass\\". Bob, however, is in no condition to fight and he passes out. Tyler responds by punching Darryl for his actions, but Bob quickly wakes up. Finding himself in the middle of a drug-induced hallucination that Darryl is being attacked by a chicken leg from Burgerboss, Bob springs to life and shoves Tyler down. Suddenly fearing for his safety, Tyler bolts out of the arcade as Bob chases him. Tyler comes charging into the yacht club, where his father happens to be the president, and tells him that Bob is trying to kill him after having thrown a manhole cover, which Bob thought was a tomato slice, at him. Security tackles Bob, but in his state he continues to try and fight them off. Tyler's father calls Linda, who is surprised to hear from him and believes that she is receiving a surprise, to come down to the club immediately. Linda excitedly dresses up in a sailing outfit and heads down to the club to find out the surprise is not what she expected. She discovers that the kids have stolen regatta pennants and oyster forks, in addition to several trays of food that Gene has eaten, and that Bob has not been taking the kids for sailing lessons but instead is still trying to beat Jimmy Pesto. Bob, meanwhile, has been fighting off security by swinging an oar at them and when he sees Linda, he believes that she is a character from Burgerboss and tries to enlist her help. Jimmy Pesto just happens to be at the party, being at the top of the waiting list for membership in the yacht club, and when he sees what is going on he once again taunts Bob over \\"BOB SUX\\". Linda chides him for his actions, blaming Jimmy for Bob's actions and saying that this is the result of another \\"peeing race\\". The membership is appalled by Linda's statement, not realizing what she really means, and thinks that Bob and Jimmy engage in illicit sexual acts. Thus, Jimmy is rejected for membership and Linda drags Bob out of the club by his ear, with the Belchers banned from the club for life. The next day, Darryl drops by the restaurant. Having been inspired by Bob, he has decided to face his bullying issues head on in the hopes of avoiding a future where he ends up being like Bob, who is still struggling with his own bully. Bob pays him under the table to get \\"BOB SUX\\" off the leader board. ==Reception== The episode received a 1.7 rating and was watched by a total of 3.66 million people. This made it the fourth most watched show on Animation Domination that night, beating The Cleveland Show, but losing to The Simpsons, American Dad! and Family Guy with 5.05 million. Rowan Kaiser of The A.V. Club gave the episode an A, saying \\"And yes, this episode was ridiculously funny, but the cherry on top of it all?

It premiered on E4 in the UK on 20 February 2012. The episode is told from the point of view of character Mini McGuinness.http://www.channel4.com/programmes/skins/episode- guide/series-5/episode-13 Mini's hates her mum's pervy new live-in boyfriend, and to make matters worse, Alo has broken the rules of their 'no strings attached' secret relationship and declared his love for her. Mini feels trapped; she's lost control of her life and needs to get away. Ignoring advice from her mum and Liv, she seeks refuge with her dad, who's never been around that much, but promises it'll be different this time. He sweeps Mini into his glamorous and grown-up world where she feels a million miles away from her problems, but Mini has a bigger problem that she can't run away from and will ultimately have to face on her own. ==Plot== As Mini is having sex with Alo in a nightclub toilet, he breaks the terms of their 'no-strings-attached' relationship by declaring he loves her. Freaked out, she returns home, but is kept awake by her mother and her irritating new live-in boyfriend Eric having sex. After having an argument with her mother, Shelley, about it the next day, Mini calls her father Gregory, and arranges to meet up at a local aquarium. The meeting goes well, and Mini begins to rebuild her relationship with Gregory, to the chagrin of her mother. As she begins to integrate herself into his life, including arranging to go to Sydney, and flirt with his assistant, she begins distancing herself from her friends at school. However, she has been hiding a dark secret that she cannot hide forever - she is pregnant. The only person who notices, however, is Franky, who recognises her regular vomiting spells as morning sickness, and her defensive attitude when questioned about it only serves to confirm Franky's suspicions. Although Franky promises not to say anything, Mini's sudden temper starts to alienate her from the others, including Liv and Alo. Things come to a head when the gang crashes a party that Gregory arranged, and Alo, after snorting some cocaine, is compelled to march over and confront Gregory's assistant, whom he believes has feelings for Mini, which upsets a lot of fellow partygoers, getting him thrown out and Mini declaring they're finished. Mini then seduces Gregory's assistant and they go off to have sex, but he stops himself, fearing for his job, and politely leaves, and he is replaced by Liv, who wants to talk to Mini about her sudden change in demeanour. After Mini once again pushes her away, and Liv gets angry and storms out, Franky questions Mini about her pregnancy, and she tearfully admits she has not come to terms with it herself yet. After some gentle coaxing, she goes to her father and confesses to the pregnancy. They then make arrangements to fly to Sydney in a couple of days, and Mini goes home to pack. Her mother implores her not to go, but she coldly brushes her off. Mini returns to Gregory's home, but arrives to discover it completely empty - he has left for Sydney permanently, just as Mini had feared he would, with only a note saying \\"Sorry. I love you\\" and a cheque for ¬£500. She tries to ring him, but he is already on the plane, and she collapses in the kitchen, ripping up the note as she cries. She then goes to Alo in the hope of making up with him, but he coldly tells her that he is fed up with her treatment of him and asks her to leave. She returns home and discovers her mother weeping in the kitchen. Her boyfriend comes outside to smoke a cigarette and finds Mini there, and she implores him not to do to her mother what her father did. The next day, Franky escorts Mini to an ultrasound clinic. There, an initially reluctant Mini is implored to look at the scan, and breaks down in tears of joy as she sees her baby for the first time on the screen. ==References== Category:2012 British television episodes Category:Skins (British TV series) episodes ","title":"Mini (Skins series 6)"},{"id":"35303583","text":"World Series of Dating is a British comedic speed dating reality television show.

Lundenberg Hundred was one of the so-called Five Hundreds or Strand Hundreds on the island, the others being Edoms Hundred, Beltring Hundred, Southern Goes Hundred, and Pellworm Hundred. It encompassed the southeastern part of the former island of Strand, between what are now the peninsulae of Nordstrand and Eiderstedt. The hundred was split in two as a result of the Grote Mandrenke in 1362. The towns of Ham and Lith, located north of the Heverstrom tidal creek, became part of Edoms Hundred. These towns were flooded and sank into the sea along with most of the island of Strand itself during the Burchardi flood of 1634. The southern part of the hundred did not entirely sink in the storm, but was nevertheless heavily damaged by waves, which completely destroyed the towns of Lundenberg and Padelack. Today, remnants of the old hundred are now part of the island-turned-peninsula of Nordstrand, as well as the site of the town of Simonsberg, Germany, located southwest of Husum. ==References== * Category:North Frisia Category:History of Schleswig- Holstein ","title":"Lundenberg Hundred"},{"id":"35303924","text":"Palangeh (, also Romanized as Palangah and Palangakh) is a village in Khandan Rural District, Tarom Sofla District, Qazvin County, Qazvin Province, Iran.

She was also known as \\"the Bazoom Girl\\", \\"the Burlesque Version of Jayne Mansfield\\", and \\"Miss 44 and Plenty More\\". ==Biography== Lee's act centered on how fast she could get her pastie propellers to spin and how dizzy she could make the audience. Due to her figure (42D\\"-26\\"-37), she became known as \\"The Bazoom Girl,\\" \\"The Burlesque Version of Jayne Mansfield,\\" and eventually, \\"Miss 44 and Plenty More\\". By the early fifties she broke into acting with minor roles in Peek-A-Boo (1953), Abandon (1958), Cold Wind in August (1961), and 3 Nuts in Search of a Bolt (1964) with Mamie Van Doren. Despite her ambitions of mainstream stardom, she found herself typecast in side roles, and never got her acting career off the ground. In 1955, she helped start a union for dancers, The Exotic Dancers' League of North America (or EDL), acting as the club's first president. During this time in Los Angeles, dancers' pay rates were extremely low and the EDL helped fight these matters as well as pushing for improved working conditions. Lee's own salary was extremely low as well, and she was forced to live in run- down studio apartments. The dancer tried to keep this from her friends, claiming in a 1980s interview: \\"They would've thought I was a hooker for sure.\\" During her career Lee appeared on the cover of several magazines, including: Stare in 1954; Risk in 1957; Frolic in 1958, among many others. She wrote an article on herself for a 1955 spread in Modern Man. Besides her life as a stripper, Lee was a noted pin-up girl throughout her career, but like most of her contemporaries, never posed nude, though in later years she did. She also wrote a monthly column on the burlesque and nightclub scene for several years that appeared in a variety of magazines. As the years went by, the EDL became more of a social organization for retired dancers and collectible items associated in their acts. Lee gathered press pictures, gowns, pasties, and G-strings of burlesque dancers for the organization and displayed them at businesses she ran, including her nightclub/bar The Sassy Lassy. The collection would become part of the Exotic World museum in Helendale, California, which was founded by Lee. By the late 1960s, an aging Lee lost interest in her own burlesque career but was still interested in supporting the next generation of Exotic Dancers and memorializing her own generation of burlesque performers. With her death at age 61 in 1990, fellow burlesque dancer, Dixie Evans, took over the Exotic World museum and helped keep burlesque and Lee's legacy alive. In 1958, she was immortalized in the song named after her, recorded by Jan and Dean, which was their first Top 20 pop hit. The song was credited to Jan & Arnie (Dean Torrance was in the army at the time of the recording. His friend Arnie Ginsburg, recorded the song with Jan Berry).https://musicvf.com/song.php?title=Jennie+Lee+by+Jan+%26+Dean&id;=20869 ==References * Jennie Lee at the Golden Days of Burlesque Historical Society * * Category:1928 births Category:1990 deaths Category:American film actresses Category:American female erotic dancers Category:American erotic dancers Category:American vedettes Category:20th- century American actresses Category:20th-century American dancers ","title":"Jennie Lee (dancer)"},{"id":"35303980","text":"Qolalu (, also Romanized as QolƒÅl≈´) is a village in Khandan Rural District, Tarom Sofla District, Qazvin County, Qazvin Province, Iran.

The Settlement Agreement assigns RACER three basic roles regarding former GM properties. First, for those properties with environmental issues, RACER manages and funds the environmental cleanup. Second, RACER manages the properties while they are owned by RACER. Third, RACER has authority to ‚Äútry to sell or transfer [its] Properties ... with the objective they be put to productive or beneficial use.‚Äù RACER is not a government entity but rather an independent trust. == GMC Bankruptcy == On June 1, 2009, General Motors Corporation and three wholly owned direct or indirect subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11, Title 11 of the United States Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York. On October 9, 2009, Remediation and Liability Management Company, Inc. (‚ÄúREALM‚Äù) and Environmental Corporate Remediation Company, Inc. (‚ÄúENCORE‚Äù) each filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 in the Bankruptcy Court.https://www.mlcguctrust.com/Page.aspx?Name=Home On July 5, 2009, the Bankruptcy Court approved the sale of assets, pursuant to 11 U.S.C. ¬ß 363, to NGMCO, Inc. (‚ÄúNewco‚Äù), now known as General Motors Company (‚ÄúNew GM‚Äù). Following the sale of assets, General Motors Corporation was renamed Motors Liquidation Company (‚ÄúMLC‚Äù). As part of the sale of assets, GMC excluded from the sale certain real property and personal property it owned. On March 31, 2011, these excluded properties were transferred to the newly formed RACER Trust. Parties to the Environmental Response Trust Consent Decree and Settlement Agreement (Case No. 09-50026 [REG]) included MLC, REALM, and ENCORE (collectively the ‚Äúdebtors‚Äù); the United States of America; the states of Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Michigan, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Virginia and Wisconsin; the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality, the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection; and the Department of Environmental Protection for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania (collectively the ‚ÄúStates‚Äù); the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe; and EPLET, LLC, not individually but solely in its representative capacity as Administrative Trustee of RACER Trust. == RACER Trust Properties == When GMC was renamed as MLC, its portfolio included properties at 89 locations in 14 U.S. states. These properties totaled more than 7,100 acres of land and nearly 40 million square feet of structural area.http://racertrust.org/Properties/Property_List At the time MLC's assets were transferred to RACER Trust, MLC had sold six properties outright and a portion of a seventh. While RACER Trust was conveyed the remaining properties, it was transferred the environmental cleanup and monitoring responsibilities of all properties that required environmental remediation and long-term monitoring, regardless of whether the property had changed ownership. Sixty of the properties carried environmental obligations, four of which were sold or partially sold by MLC prior to RACER Trust's creation. == RACER Trust Redevelopment Mission == RACERS begins the redevelopment process for new job-creating uses by meeting with local elected officials, community leaders and economic development organizations, with a goal of understanding the local community's common vision for the optimal re- use of each location. Based on this common vision, RACER determines how best to market the property for sale to prospective buyers. Following these initial steps, RACER published detailed marketing brochures and documents describing the terms for purchase, formally opening the marketing process. Offers for purchase are evaluated by RACER against six criteria set forth in the Settlement Agreement that resulted in RACER's creation. RACER also may consider additional factors, in its sole discretion, when assessing whether these criteria have been best satisfied by a particular offer. While purchase price will be evaluated, RACER also must consider each offer's ability to create jobs and generate new economic opportunity in the communities hurt by the GM bankruptcy.https://www.racertrust.org/who-we-are-and-what-we-do RACER strongly prefers buyers who have a specific plan to create new jobs in those properties while reusing, improving and expanding existing buildings, rather than buyers who intend to dismantle buildings and sell components of the properties they have purchased. Proceeds from property sales or leases are used to pay so-called holding costs at RACER sites, including the property taxes RACER pays on these properties, and maintenance, insurance and security expenses. Proceeds from the sale or lease of RACER properties are transferred to RACER's Administrative Funding Account, from which RACER pays its day-to- day expenses. RACER is self-sustaining, and the anticipated proceeds from the sale or lease of properties were factored into the ongoing operations of RACER at the time of its creation. Thus, donation of property as a redevelopment strategy is precluded. RACER does not invest directly in redevelopment (for example, by providing funding to offset infrastructure improvement costs) or otherwise pay third-party expenses (for example, for consultants to evaluate redevelopment proposals). RACER invests in local communities by maintaining properties in a marketable condition, paying property taxes and acting as an economic development partner in pursuit of new investment and job creation.https://www.racertrust.org/redevelopment-mission/our-successful- approach == Sales Criteria == RACER is obligated by terms of the Settlement Agreement to sell its properties at prices that approximate fair market value and that take into consideration the jobs and other economic benefits new projects can bring to auto communities hurt by the GM bankruptcy. The Settlement Agreement described the criteria that RACER, at a minimum, must consider when selling properties. These criteria include: 1\\\\. Whether the purchase price is sufficient; 2\\\\. The potential for job creation in the affected community and the state; 3\\\\. Increases in tax revenue or other benefits, like the reduction of blight, to the community, state or Tribe; 4\\\\. Avoiding an unanticipated increase in costs for the environmental cleanup; 5\\\\. The views of the local communities, the Tribe or the state; and, 6\\\\. The reputation and credibility of the prospective purchaser.https://www.racertrust.org/redevelopment-mission/our-successful- approach The Settlement Agreement does not require any particular weighting of the factors. Although the effects of a proposed sale on the states and localities are to be considered ‚Äî and are considered ‚Äî by RACER, these entities are not beneficiaries of RACER. Its sole beneficiary is the United States Government. == RACER Trust Environmental Mission == RACER Trust is responsible for conducting safe, effective cleanups of legacy environmental contamination resulting from previous operations at 60 former GM locations. The cleanups are conducted with the approval and oversight of state and federal regulatory agencies and funded by the principal and investment income from nearly $500 million that RACER received from the U.S. Department of the Treasuryhttps://www.racertrust.org/environmental-cleanup/cleanup-mission at the time of RACER's establishment. RACER's goal is to obtain \\"No Further Action\\" letters or other such instruments of completion from responsible regulatory agencies for all locations where cleanups were required. To the extent possible, RACER coordinates its cleanups to accommodate the interests of buyers or end users who seek to invest in new industrial or commercial development and job creation. In most cases, RACER properties can be sold for new uses even before environmental cleanups are started or completed, assuming RACER is guaranteed continuing access to the properties to conduct cleanup work. Budgets for each cleanup were incorporated into the Settlement Agreement that established RACER Trust. In cases where the established budget is insufficient, RACER Trust has access to supplemental funding with the approval of the signatories to the Settlement Agreement. == Notable Sales ==  Moraine, Ohio  RACER sold two of its properties, Moraine Industrial Land and Moraine Assembly Plant, to Industrial Realty Group (IRG) in June 2011. The adjacent sites totaled more than 3.3 million square feet of factory space on 379 acres of land in Moraine and Kettering, Ohio. In one of the largest international deals in Ohio's history, Fuyao Glass America purchased 1.5 million square feet of manufacturing space from IRG. The company, now the largest auto glass manufacturer in the world, supplies customers such as General Motors, Ford, and Honda. The plant also serves after-market glass suppliers, which includes companies such as Safelite AutoGlass. Fuyao originally pledged $230 million in investment and the creation of 800 jobs. One year later this jumped to $360 million in investment and 1,550 jobs.https://www.daytondailynews.com/news/breaking-news/fuyao-set-double- hiring-moraine-plant-500-jobs/XIW2hI9dJ3w0Rw5Uw8KVnL/ One year after that, Fuyao announced its labor need had risen to a total of 2,400 workers at this facility.https://www.mydaytondailynews.com/news/fuyao-chairman-moraine-plant- will-need-more-than-000-workers/OKnh5uBFkP9yrPeulWwlJO/ A total of 622 temporary construction jobs also were created. In July 2016, Fuyao announced it is leasing an additional 241,000 square feet of the plant in a 15-year agreement with IRG.https://www.mydaytondailynews.com/news/fuyao-glass-expand- new-plant-again/8wo24zR0u4lHpvohVHhjSL/ Fuyao's chairman, Cho Tak Wong, said it expects to have more than 3,000 employees at this site sometime in the future.https://www.daytondailynews.com/news/fuyao-chairman-says-000-jobs- possible-moraine-plant/K1twMMkw8ibtYQRJZiBRUJ/ IRG leases portions of the sites to other auto- and non-auto related manufacturers.  Kansas City, Kansas  In September 2013, RACER sold its 74-acre Kansas City, Kansas holdings to NorthPoint Development. The buyer named the site Central Industrial Parkhttps://www.racertrust.org/news/northpoint-racer-trust-close- sale-kansas-city-ks-development-projects-will-create-2000-new-jobs and prepared it for new industrial development. In 2015, NorthPoint developed a 74,000 square-foot, $10 million build-to-suit facilityhttps://www.bizjournals.com/kansascity/news/2016/07/21/northpoint- central-industrial-park-construction.html that was purchased by Plastic Omnium Auto Inergy, which manufactures plastic fuel tank systems for the nearby General Motors Fairfax Assembly Plant. The manufacturer employs approximately 200 new workers. NorthPoint then constructed an 842,000 square-foot speculative building that General Motors Company occupies under a long-term lease. This $55 million project is expected to employ approximately 500 new workers.https://www.bizjournals.com/kansascity/news/2016/11/16/gm-northpoint- fairfax-logistics-center-500-jobs.html Additional areas of the site are planned for redevelopment.  Pontiac, Michigan  In August 2014, RACER sold two of its Pontiac, Michigan properties, PCC Validation I and PCC Validation II, to M1 Concourse, LLC.https://m1concourse.com The two adjacent sites comprised 86 acres of vacant land once owned by the Rapid Motor Vehicle Company until being acquired by Old GM in 1909. The buyer built an exclusive community of more than 250 secure private garages set along the 1.5-mile Champion Motor Speedway, also part of the M1 Concourse development. Private garages are individually owned flexible storage and entertainment spaces.https://m1concourse.com/about-us/ A 6,000 square-foot entertainment venue, a restaurant and banquet/event center, and commercial/retail spaces were part of the nearly $70 million investment.https://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/autos/2016/06/08/concourse- race-track-car-condos-set-open-pontiac/85632304/  Indianapolis, Indiana  RACER sold its 103-acre Indianapolis Stamping Plant site in Indianapolis, Indiana to the Ambrose Property Group in March 2018. The property was once home to the 2.2-million square-foot General Motors Indianapolis Metals Center. RACER razed the vast majority of the structures on site prior to selling to Ambrose. Ambrose's site plan includes a mixed-use development along the White River that could require some 1,000 temporary construction jobs, 900 permanent jobs, and more than $500 million in project investments over 10 to 15 years.http://www.insideindianabusiness.com/story/37914741/former-gm-site-ripe- for-all-different-types-of-development-indianapolis-ambrose-property-group- stamping  Livonia, Michigan  RACER sold its Delco Chassis site in Livonia, Michigan to Ashley Capital in August 2015. The buyer built a 1-million square-foot facility that it leases to Amazon.com as a fulfillment center. Over 500 temporary construction jobs were created, and in the summer of 2017, Amazon estimated it would hire more than 1,000 employees to staff the facility.https://www.wxyz.com/news/first-amazon-fulfillment-center-in- michigan-opens-in-livonia Ashley Capital sold a portion of the same site to National Republic Distributing Corporation. The wine and spirits distributor is building a 515,000 square-foot development that will serve as both a regional headquarters and a logistics facility. It is estimated that the company will invest over $67 million in the project and need to hire 525 employees.https://www.hometownlife.com/story/news/local/livonia/2018/04/27/alcohol- distributor-invests-67-5-m-brings-525-jobs-livonia/550935002/  Ypsilanti Township, Michigan  In November 2016, RACER sold 312 acres of its iconic Willow Run Powertrain Plant to a partnership that has redeveloped the property into the American Center for Mobility, a state-of-the-art, four-season testing facility for connected and automated vehicles in Ypsilanti Township, Michigan. The facility includes a 2.5-mile test track with ramps, a 700-degree tunnel, and other components necessary to developing and marketing driverless automobiles and related technologies.http://www.crainsdetroit.com/article/20180404/news/657026/american- center-for-mobility-opening-at-willow-run-touted-as-crucial Prior to this sale, RACER sold 144,000 square feet of former manufacturing space on almost 17 acres of this property for the newly relocated Yankee Air Museum, which suffered a devastating fire at its previous location in 2004.https://www.firehouse.com/home/news/10516942/blaze-devours-michigans- yankee-air-museum-relics Spotsylvania County, Virginia Old GM owned a single property in Virginia, located near Fredericksburg in Spotsylvania County, which RACER took possession of as part of Old GM's bankruptcy. The 265,000 square-foot manufacturing facility and 76 acres of land were sold by RACER to idX Corporation in May 2017. idX stated in late 2017 that it will hire 175 employees and invest $9.8 million in its project.https://www.fredericksburg.com/news/local/spotsylvania/virginia- governor-headlines-ribbon-cutting-ceremony-for-global-manufacturer- in/article_2e4cc429-590b-51b4-b36d-381516a07259.html RACER Trust self- publishes case studies describing the redevelopment, reuse and environmental status of its former properties from time to time.http://racertrust.org/Properties/Case-Studies == Public Controversies ==  Ontario, Ohio  In August 2012, RACER announced it had reached agreement with the Brownfield Communities Development Company, a joint venture between Hilco Trading LLC and The Adler Group, for the sale of the former GM Ontario Stamping Plant, a 2.5-million-square-foot manufacturing facility in Ontario, Ohio.http://racertrust.org/News/10289 The sale was completed in December 2012. \\"We are taking an obsolete single-tenant facility and turning it into a modern multi-tenant business generator,‚Äù said Michael M. Adler, CEO and Chairman of Adler Group. \\"We are excited to start the next phase of the project and we are looking forward to working with the community.\\"http://racertrust.org/News/11171 The company promised to create 500 jobs within five years or pay a $1 million fine to the city.http://www.richlandsource.com/news/ontario-frustrated-with-progress-at- former-gm-%09site/article_a6aabab2-77f9-11e7-b599-7f4decb7d416.html Brownfield Communities Development Company represented to RACER and to the community in a Development Agreement dated August 16, 2012, that it intended to seek new tenants to occupy most of the intact building. In a letter dated April 12, 2013, Michael M. Adler, president of Ontario Business Park LLC, requested approval from the City of Ontario for demolition of the buildings on the property.https://www.destinationmansfield.com/blog/gm-pact-signed-work-begins- to-bring-1100-jobs/ The request was approved by the Ontario City Council and the buildings were demolished and sold for scrap. Brownfield Communities Development Company claimed that its marketing of the property was thwarted by ongoing environmental activity at the property, despite never having raised the environmental conditions as a potential impediment when purchasing the property and despite ample examples of RACER properties that were purchased and redeveloped while environmental activities were ongoing.https://www.mansfieldnewsjournal.com/story/opinion/columnists/2015/10/16/column- former-gm-site-ready-redevelopment/73986992/ The Ohio Environmental Protection Agency, the regulatory agency that oversaw RACER's cleanup activities at the property, issued a Covenant Not to Sue to RACER in April 2016, certifying the completion of environmental cleanup at the property.https://www.racertrust.org/news/ohio-epa-issues-covenant-not-sure- former-racer-trust-property-ontario-oh In August 2017, the Ontario City Council sent a notice of default of completion to the Adler Group, Inc.https://www.mansfieldnewsjournal.com/story/news/2017/08/03/ontario- council-files-notice-default-completion-guarantee-against-adler- group/534539001/ The property remains undeveloped.  Caddo Parish, Louisiana  In January 2013, RACER and Elio Motors announced that Elio Motors would purchase the former Shreveport Assembly Plant in Caddo Parish, LA, just outside Shreveport, and hire 1,500 people to manufacture the company's innovative three-wheel, gas-powered vehicles.https://www.reuters.com/article/us-trust-formergmplant/maker-of-high- mileage-3-wheel-vehicles-buys-former-gm-plant-idUSBRE9020M420130103 The deal was restructured to enable purchase of the facility by the Caddo Parish Industrial Development Board (IDB) in December 2013, with a master lease provided to Industrial Realty Group (dba Shreveport Business Park) and a secondary lease provided to Elio Motors. Shreveport Business Park, in addition to making monthly lease payments to the IDB, is responsible for all of the property's marketing, maintenance and upkeep. Local elected officials who initially were supportive of Elio Motors began to publicly criticize the deal as Elio Motors continued to miss start-of-production targets, citing lack of capital. In particular, Caddo Commissioner Matthew Linn and Louisiana State Rep. Cedric Glover, a prominent supporter of Elio Motors during his time as mayor of Shreveport, levied false allegations ‚Äî Commissioner Linn that RACER threatened to demolish the plant if the Caddo Parish IDB did not purchase it, and Rep. Glover that the sale of the plant prevented other prospects from leasing or purchasing the plant. Rep. Glover sponsored a House resolution requesting ‚Äúthe House Committee on Commerce to study the state of the automotive manufacturing industry in the state of Louisiana since the onset of the most recent worldwide economic downturn.‚Äùhttp://www.legis.la.gov/Legis/ViewDocument.aspx?d=1013537https://www.shreveporttimes.com/story/news/2016/09/28/whats- going-general-motors-shreveport-plant/91179046/ The House Committee on Commerce convened a hearing on the transaction on October 26, 2016, in Shreveport.https://www.ktbs.com/news/paul-elio-in-hot-seat-during-la-house- commerce-committee/article_cab813fb-a0ef-50db-85fe-607760847e1b.html The committee issued a two-page report that included no conclusions or finding of fact, except to note that, ‚ÄúSince the October 2016 meeting, officials with the North Louisiana Economic partnership announced that GLOVIS America, a subsidiary of Hyundai, will open a new distribution center in the former General Motors facility that will result in the production of 75,000 vehicles annually and the creation of 400 new positions in north Louisiana.‚Äùhttp://www.nlep.org/Media-Center/Press-Releases/GLOVIS-America- Facility-Opens-at-Former-GM-Plant-i.aspx In 2017, the Louisiana House authorized the creation of a subcommittee of the House Committee on Commerce ‚Äúto further examine certain matters relative to the (RACER Trust‚Äôs) fulfillment of fiduciary duties concerning the former General Motors Shreveport plant.‚Äùhttp://www.legis.la.gov/Legis/ViewDocument.aspx?d=1043775 A report of the subcommittee was due 30 days before the start of the 2018 Regular Session of the Legislature of Louisiana.

The Harris Farm Engagement was a part of the Battle of Spotsylvania Courthouse. The battle was led by Union Major General Winfield S. Hancock and Confederate general Richard S. Ewell. The battle was caused when the Union commander, Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant ordered Hancock's Union II Corps to trap Confederate soldiers between Richmond and Fredericksburg. Before General Hancock could trap the Confederate soldiers, Confederate General Robert E. Lee ordered Lieutenant General Richard S. Ewell, in command of the Confederate II Corps to ambush General Hancock's troops at the Harris Farm (also known as Bloomsbury Farm). == Background == The Harris Farm Engagement was a part of the Battle of Spotsylvania Courthouse. At the battle of Spotsylvania Courthouse, Gen. Ulysses S. Grant ordered Gen. Winfield S. Hancock's Federal II Corps to trap receding Confederate troops who were heading to Fredericksburg. Unbeknownst to General Grant, Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee heard of this and ordered Richard S. Ewell and the rest of the surviving Confederate Second Corps of the Army of Northern Virginia to ambush Hancock's troops at the Harris Farm. Ewell made camp near the Harris Farm and waited for the Hancock's troops to come near. == Battle == When Hancock's troops came into view Ewell had his men fire at them. Ewell then ordered a charge on Hancock's troops. Early in the battle Ewell had the upper hand until Hancock's superior numbers soon gained the control. Both sides quickly began taking heavy casualties, and Ewell began falling back. Grant, who was observing the battle, ordered Hancock to pursue the remaining troops. The battle continued until General Lee, who was also observing the battle, thought this engagement was about to turn into a battle of itself. Lee ordered his troops to disengage and head to Richmond. Grant and Hancock claimed victory, as they had forced a retreat of the enemy and officially ended the Battle of Spotsylvania Courthouse. == Aftermath == The Harris Farm Engagement claimed 1,598 casualties on both sides. The engagement was the end of the long Battle of the Spotsylvania Courthouse.

He was married to the editor and poet Constantia Grierson. ==Life== Grierson arrived in Dublin about 1703 and shortly afterwards set up a printing establishment, \\"The Sign of the Two Bibles\\" in Essex Street. He set about printing large impressions of Bibles and Books of Common Prayer of different sorts and sizes. In addition to Bibles and Prayer Books, he produced the volumes known as Grierson's Classics, works of classical writers of antiquity. Among his productions were the first edition published in Ireland, in 1724, of Paradise Lost; Sir William Petty's Maps of Ireland; and other valuable works. He also spent over ¬£700 on printing equipment.Memorial prepared by his son George Abraham Grierson in 1754 In 1709 he was admitted a Freeman of the City of Dublin by Special Grace. In 1720 he was one of the churchwardens of the Church of St. John, Drumcondra, in the Registers of which the baptisms and burials of his children are entered. After he became acquainted with Constantia Crawley she started editing many works Grierson was publishing. They married around 1727, shortly after the death of his first wife. By 1727 she had carefully edited titles in the pocket \\"Classics\\" edition, including Terence's Comediae, to which she prefixed a Greek epigram from her own pen, inscribing it to Robert, son of Lord Carteret; in 1730 she edited the work of Tacitus, inscribing it to Lord Carteret himself. Jonathan Swift was so impressed with her editing that he wrote to Alexander Pope on 6 February 1730: 'She is a very good Latin and Greek scholar, and hath lately published a fine edition of Tacitus, and she writes carmina Anglicana non contemnenda.' Constantia played an important role in her husband's business and household, which included apprentices and journeymen as well as domestic servants. Her husband emphasized her contributions in his successful petition to the Irish House of Commons in 1729 to be granted the patent for King's Printer: \\"the Editions corrected by her have been approved of, not only in this Kingdom, but in Great Britain, Holland and elsewhere, and the Art of Printing, through her care and assistance, has been brought to greater perfection than has been hitherto in this Kingdom.\\"Grierson, 1773, p. 240 After Constantia's death in 1732 Grierson married Jane Blow, daughter of the Belfast printer James Blow. ==NotesSources== * . * .

Pene, E. Courtine, A. Cariou, J.P. Mira. Toward theranostics. Crit Care Med, 37 (2009), pp. S50‚ÄìS58 The characteristics of heptamethine dyes can be understood by comparing research data on different dyes within the family. For example, the IR-780 dye exhibits a peak spectral absorption of around 780 nm. == Optical properties == The absorption and fluorescence spectrum of heptamethine dyes are in the near infrared region and vary largely on the solvent and concentration. IR-808 absorbs mainly between 775 nm and 796 nm and emits fluorescence between 808 nm and 827 nm with a large red shift as expected in the serum sample. These absorption rates are important for their medical applications due to the image capturing capabilities. Dyes with good pharmacokinetics and fluorescence above 680 nm are considered viable in biomedical imaging due to their significant tissue penetration and imaging signature relative to background frequencies. ==Patents== International patents on the use of heptamethine dyes for use in photographic use have also been approved and instituted. Fuji film placed a patent titled ‚ÄúHeptamethine cyanine compound, near infrared absorbing ink, near infrared absorbing sheet and silver halide photographic material‚Äù in 1999 and a follow-up international patent 6072059 in 2000.

Gale Research Company, 1969. p. 806 His parents were John and Irene Wickizer. While still at school Mulholland started his professional magic career from 1913. He was educated at Columbia University and College of the City of New York. Mulholland supplemented his income by teaching industrial arts at Horace Mann School during 1919-1925. ==Life and work== Mulholland learned the art of magic as a teenager with John William Sargent, President of the Society of American Magicians. Mulholland was a professional magician for two decades, working in small companies and large stage shows. He ran one of the first magic workshops and was from 1930 the editor of the magical trade magazine The Sphinx. He published many books on magic and its history. Mulholland was a close friend of Harry Houdini.Basbanes, Nicholas A. (1995). A Gentle Madness: Bibliophiles, Bibliomanes, and the Eternal Passion for Books. Henry Holt and Company. p. 419 Mulholland asserted that \\"Houdini once told me that he considered no man to be a magician until he was able skillfully to perform the cups and balls.\\"Osborne, Thomas James. (1937). Cups and Balls Magic. Kanter's Magic Shop. p. 8 His other friends included Gene Tunney, Harold Ross and Bert Terhune. Mulholland married Pauline Pierce on May 17, 1932. In 1939, he was the only foreign officer in the British Magical Society, and by that time had studied his craft in 42 countries. During World War II, he wrote a spellbook for soldiers. His impressive collection is now owned by David Copperfield. In 1949, Mulholland was issued a public $10,000 challenge. John J McManus (Magic Collector) issued the challenge in the Conjurors' Magazine (June 1949, Vol 5 Issue# 4). The full page ad called for Mulholland to re-create his famous 'Hooker Rising Trick' under controlled stage conditions with McManus providing the necessary props. Failure to answer the challenge or to correctly recreate the trick would call for publicly accepting the story of his trick as an 'exaggerated myth'. He left his editorial position at The Sphinx in 1953, officially due to health problems but in reality it was a cover for him to work for the Central Intelligence Agency. During the Cold War, Mulholland was paid by the CIA to write a manual on deception and misdirection. Copies of the document were believed to have been destroyed in 1973, however, copies later resurfaced and were published as \\"The Official CIA Manual of Trickery and Deception\\".\\"CIA's Lost Magic Manual Resurfaces\\".

In 2008, magician Ben Robinson authored The Magician: John Mulholland's Secret Life which documented his work with the CIA.\\"Secret CIA 'Magic' Manual Reveals Cold War Spy Tricks\\". Retrieved 24 May 2016. He was the editor of the Conjurer's Journal and was the only living magician listed in the book Who's who in America immediately after the death of Howard Thurston. Mulholland was also a member of Inner Magic Circle (honorary vice-president), International Brotherhood of Magicians and Society of American Magicians. ==Skepticism== Mulholland had criticized the claims of parapsychology and exposed the tricks of fraudulent spiritualist mediums. His book Beware Familiar Spirits (1938) revealed many of these tricks.The New Books. Review of Beware Familiar Spirits. The Saturday Review. November 26, 1938. p. 24Coleman, Earle Jerome. (1987).

These levels are used in preventing and responding to disasters. These guidelines are ascertained for one, short exposure (with a maximum of eight hours) by the air. The AEGL values are determined for varying times of exposure, such as ten minutes, thirty minutes, one hour, four hours and eight hours. The AEGL values describe the expected effects of inhalation exposure to certain compounds (airborne concentrations in ppm or mg/m3). Each AEGL is determined by different levels of a compound's toxicological effects, based on the 4 Ds: detection, discomfort, disability and death. There are three levels of AEGL-values: AEGL-1, AEGL-2 and AEGL-3. AEGL-1 is the airborne concentration above which notable discomfort or irritation could be experienced. However, the effects are not disabling and reversible once exposure stops. AEGL-2 is the airborne concentration above which irreversible or other serious, long-lasting adverse health effects or an impaired ability to escape could be experienced. AEGL-3 is the airborne concentration above which life-threatening health effects or death could be experienced. An example is shown below for chlorine gas AEGLs: {  +AEGLs for chlorine (in ppm) ! !10 min !30 min !60 min !4 hours !8 hours - AEGL-1 0.50 0.50 0.50 0.50 0.50 - AEGL-2 2.8 2.8 2.0 1.0 0.71 - AEGL-3 50 28 20 10 7.1 } In this example, several trends can be observed. First, as one moves from AEGL-1 to AEGL-3, the concentrations increase, based on the dose predicted to produce the respective effects (discomfort/irritation vs disability vs death). Second, as one moves from shorter exposures to longer (left to right in the same row), the overall concentration allowed decreases due to the effects of cumulative dose. This is not always the case for AEGL-1 values, however, since they represent a threshold for non-disabling outcomes and sometimes only depend on air concentration. ==See also== * Immediately dangerous to life or health * Lethal dose ==References== Category:Chemical safety Category:Emergency management Category:Firefighting in the United States Category:Medical emergencies Category:National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health Category:Occupational Safety and Health Administration Category:Toxicology ","title":"Acute Exposure Guideline Levels"},{"id":"35304372","text":"Kuhgir-e Sofla (, also Romanized as K≈´hgƒ´r-e Sofl√°, K≈´gƒ´r-e Sofl√°, and G\`≈´gƒ´r-e Sofl√°) is a village in Kuhgir Rural District, Tarom Sofla District, Qazvin County, Qazvin Province, Iran.

Sometimes, it is a journey to a sacred area or shrine of importance to innate faith. Members of every major religion participate in pilgrimages. A person who makes such a journey is called a pilgrim. Unlike some other religions, Hindus are not required to undertake pilgrimages during their lifetime.Berkley Center for Religion, Peace, and World Affairs - Hinduism See drop-down essay on \\"Hindu Practices\\" However, most Hindus go on such journeys to numerous iconic sites including those below: ==India== Varanasi known as Kashi is one of the holiest pilgrimage sites Kodlamane Shree Vishnumurthy Temple Tirupati temple Char Dham (Famous Four Pilgrimage sites): The four holy sites Puri, Rameswaram, Dwarka, and Badrinath (or alternatively the Himalayan towns of Badrinath, Kedarnath, Gangotri, and Yamunotri) compose the Char Dham (four abodes) pilgrimage circuit. Kumbh Mela: The Kumbh Mela (the \\"pitcher festival\\") is one of the holiest of Hindu pilgrimages that is held every three years; the location is rotated among Prayagraj, Haridwar, Nashik, and Ujjain. Old Holy cities as per Puranic Texts: Varanasi formerly known as Kashi, Prayagraj also known as Prayag, Haridwar-Rishikesh, Mathura-Vrindavan, Kurukshetra, the Land of Bhagavad Gita in Haryana and Ayodhya. Old Temple cities: Puri, which hosts a major Vaishnava Jagannath temple and Rath Yatra celebration; Katra, home to the Vaishno Devi temple; Tirumala - Tirupati, home to the Tirumala Venkateswara Temple; Madurai Meenakshi and Sri Ranganathaswamy Temple in Sri Rangam, and Sabarimala, where Swami Ayyappan is worshipped; Sri Padmanabhaswamy Temple at Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala. The oldest of these temple pilgrimage is the Pandharpur Wari which is said to be in tradition from the past 800 years. New Pilgrimage Centres: Three comparatively recent temples of fame and huge pilgrimage are Belur Math, the hub of the worldwide Ramakrishna Movement in West Bengal, Dakshineswar Kali Temple, Kolkata; Vivekananda Rock Memorial at Kanyakumari; Sri Ramana Ashram at Tiruvannamalai; Sri Radha Krishna Mandir https://www.iskconbangalore.org/ of ISCKON in Bengaluru. Ramakrishna Mission Swami Vivekananda's Ancestral House and Cultural Centre, the birthplace of Swami Vivekananda is also another popular destination. Shakti Peethas: An important set of pilgrimages are the Shakti Peethas, where the Mother Goddess is worshipped, the two principal ones being Kalighat and Kamakhya. There are altogether 51 shakti peethas. Jyotirlingas: Other set of important pilgrimages are the Jyotirlingas, where lord Shiva is worshipped in the form of Shiva Lingas. There are twelve Jyotirlingas in India. The twelve Jyotirlingas are: * Bhimashankar Temple, near Pune * Somnath in Gujarat * Mallikarjuna Jyotirlinga at Srisailam in Andhra Pradesh * Mahakaleshwar Jyotirlinga at Ujjain in Madhya Pradesh * Omkareshwar in Madhya Pradesh * Kedarnath in Uttarakhand * Vishwanath Temple at Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh * Tryambakeshwar at Nashik in Maharashtra * Vaidyanath Jyotirlinga * Aundha Nagnath in Hingoli, Maharashtra or Nageshvara Jyotirlinga at Dwarka * Rameshwar at Rameshwaram in Tamil Nadu * Grishneshwar at Verul near Ellora Aurangabad Divya Desam: Another important set of pilgrimages are the \\"Divya Desam\\", the holy temples where Lord Vishnu is worshipped.

The service was filled with a wonderful energy. Saffron robes and languages ranging from French to Bengali make annual appearances at the Annisquam Village Church in Gloucester. Modern- day Hindu Pilgrims visit to pay homage and walk in the steps of Swami Vivekananda, the first Hindu monk in America, who spoke from the Church's pulpit in 1893, just before he made history at the first meeting of the World Parliament of Religions in Chicago (an adjunct event to the Columbian Exposition) as representative of Hinduism. Eloquent and, at the time, exotic, Vivekananda mesmerized his audiences both here and in Chicago, winning new respect for and interest in the religions of the East. He started the Vedanta Societies in America to spread his message of harmony of religions and inherent divinity of the soul. Vivekananda remained in Gloucester for several weeks during his two visits. First as the guest of John Henry Wright, a Greek professor at Harvard who helped Vivekananda make the arrangements for his Parliament appearance; and then he stayed at the Annisquam residence of Alpheus Hyatt, whose marine biology station on Lobster Cove was the first iteration of the present-day Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute. Hyatt was the father of Gloucester's renowned sculptor, Anna Hyatt (later Huntington), who would have been 17 at the time of the Swami's visit. More than 100 years later, devotees of this visionary Hindu man make annual pilgrimages to the Village Church, to touch the stone doorstep and to meditate in the serene space where their leader spoke. The service included brief addresses by Swami Yogatmananda of Providence (Hindu Chaplain at Brown University and UMass Dartmouth), and Swami Tyagananda of Boston (Hindu Chaplain at Harvard and MIT), and the Rev. Deirdre Greenwood White, Pastor of the Annisquam Village Church. Music from both traditions included preludes of sitar and tabla. The children of the Village Church performed a short play portraying the arrival of Swami Vivekananda in Annisquam. A simple Indian meal followed the service and included a partial screening of the new documentary about Vivekananda's sojourn in America. First visit to the West (1893‚Äì97) Vivekananda started his journey to the West on 31 May 1893[82] and visited several cities in Japan (including Nagasaki, Kobe, Yokohama, Osaka, Kyoto and Tokyo),[83] China and Canada en route to the United States,[82] reaching Chicago on 30 July 1893,[84] [82] where the \\"Parliament of Religions\\" took place in September 1893.[85] The Congress was an initiative of the Swedenborgian layman, and judge of the Illinois Supreme Court, Charles C. Bonney,[86] [87] to gather all the religions of the world, and show \\"the substantial unity of many religions in the good deeds of the religious life.\\"[86] It was one of the more than 200 adjunct gatherings and congresses of the Chicago's World's Fair,[86] and was \\"an avant-garde intellectual manifestation of [...] cultic milieus, East and West,\\"[88] with the Brahmo Samaj and the Theosophical Society being invited as being representative of Hinduism.[89] Vivekananda wanted to join, but was disappointed to learn that no one without credentials from a bona fide organisation would be accepted as a delegate.[90] Vivekananda contacted Professor John Henry Wright of Harvard University, who invited him to speak at Harvard.[90] Vivekananda wrote of the professor, \\"He urged upon me the necessity of going to the Parliament of Religions, which he thought would give an introduction to the nation\\".[91] [note 3] Vivekananda submitted an application, \\"introducing himself as a monk 'of the oldest order of sannyƒÅsis ... founded by Sankara,'\\"[89] supported by the Brahmo Samaj representative Protapchandra Mozoombar, who was also a member of the Parliament's selection committee, \\"classifying the Swami as a representative of the Hindu monastic order.\\"[89] ==See also== List of Hindu temples ==References== https://www.iskconbangalore.org/ Category:Hinduism-related lists Category:Lists of pilgrimage sites ","title":"Hindu pilgrimage sites"},{"id":"35304410","text":"Molla Ali or Mulla-Ali () may refer to: *Molla Ali, East Azerbaijan *Molla Ali, Qazvin *Molla Ali, Sistan and Baluchestan *Molla Ali, alternate name of Molla Dadi, Sistan and Baluchestan Province ","title":"Molla Ali"},{"id":"35304416","text":"Qaleh (, also Romanized as Qal‚Äòeh and Kale) is a village in Kuhgir Rural District, Tarom Sofla District, Qazvin County, Qazvin Province, Iran.

It is directed by Joshua Michael Stern, written by Matt Whiteley, and produced by Stern and Mark Hulme. Steve Jobs is portrayed by Ashton Kutcher, with Josh Gad as Apple Computer's co-founder Steve Wozniak. Jobs was chosen to close the 2013 Sundance Film Festival. == Plot == The film opens in 2001 with a middle-aged Steve Jobs (Ashton Kutcher) introducing the iPod at an Apple Town Hall meeting. The story flashes back to Reed College in 1974. The high tuition forces Jobs to drop out, but Dean Jack Dudman (James Woods) allows him to sit in on classes. Jobs is particularly interested in a calligraphy course. Jobs meets up with his friend Daniel Kottke (Lukas Haas), who is excited to see Jobs with a copy of Be Here Now' by Baba Ram Dass. Influenced by this book and his experiences with LSD, Jobs and Kottke spend time in India. Two years later, Jobs is back in Los Altos, California, living with his adoptive parents Paul (John Getz) and Clara (Lesley Ann Warren). While working for Atari as a video game developer, Jobs develops a partnership with his friend Steve Wozniak (Josh Gad). Jobs is encharged by company President Nolan Bushnell to develop an arcade video game (Breakout), which he ends up having Wozniak build in his place. He also inequitably distributes the salary for the game development between Wozniak and himself. Later, Jobs discovers that Wozniak has built a prototype for a \\"personal home computer\\" (the Apple I), which he expresses interest in commercialising. They name their new company Apple Computer, though there is another company called Apple Records that is owned by The Beatles (Wozniak teases Jobs that this symbolizes his preference for Bob Dylan). Wozniak demonstrates the Apple I at the Homebrew Computer Club. Jobs is later approached by Paul Terrell (Brad William Henke) who shows interest in the Apple I. Jobs persuades his father Paul to let them set up their new company in the family garage (which is a carpentry/tool center). Jobs also recruits Kottke, Bill Fernandez, (Victor Rasuk) and Chris Espinosa (Eddie Hassell) to the Apple team. Terrell's disappointment in the Apple I (in his opinion, being only a motherboard and not a full computer as promised), inspires Jobs to restart with a second model. He hires Rod Holt (Ron Eldard) to re-conceptualize the power supply for what will be called the Apple II. Mike Markkula (Dermot Mulroney), a venture capitalist, notices Jobs and Wozniak's work, and also joins Apple. The Apple II is released at the 1977 West Coast Computer Faire where it is a remarkable success. Apple's success eventually causes Jobs to distance himself from his friends. Upon learning his high-school girlfriend Chrisann Brennan (Ahna O'Reilly) is pregnant, Jobs ends their relationship. Brennan gives birth to Lisa Brennan whom Jobs denies is his child. John Sculley (Matthew Modine) is recruited as CEO of the company. As Jobs' behavior grows more erratic (for example firing an employee for not appreciating his investment in using fonts), Jobs is moved from the Apple Lisa development team to the Macintosh Group where he works with Bill Atkinson, Burrell Smith (Lenny Jacobson), Chris Espinosa, and Andy Hertzfeld (Elden Henson). He also forces out Jef Raskin, the original Macintosh Group team 1 leader. Though the Macintosh is introduced with great fanfare in 1984, including a high-budget television commercial, Scully forces Jobs out of the company in 1985. The film jumps to 1996. Jobs is married to Laurene Powell Jobs (Abby Brammell) and he has accepted Lisa (Annika Bertea) as his daughter (she now lives with them). He has a son, Reed (Paul Baretto) and is also running NeXT. When Apple buys NeXT, then-CEO Gil Amelio asks Jobs to return to Apple as a consultant. Jobs is soon named the new CEO, and ultimately fires Amelio and also his ex-friend Markkula (who refused to support him when he was forced out of Apple 11 years prior). Jobs becomes interested in the work of Jony Ive (Giles Matthey) and strives to reinvent Apple. The film ends with Jobs recording the dialogue for the Think Different commercial in 1997. Before the credits, there is a photo montage of the main characters paired with film clips of the actor playing the part, plus a dedication to Steve Jobs. ==Cast== Apple * Ashton Kutcher as Steve Jobs * Josh Gad as Steve Wozniak * Lukas Haas as Daniel Kottke * Victor Rasuk as Bill Fernandez * Eddie Hassell as Chris Espinosa * Ron Eldard as Rod Holt * Nelson Franklin as Bill Atkinson * Elden Henson as Andy Hertzfeld * Lenny Jacobson as Burrell Smith * Giles Matthey as Jony Ive * Dermot Mulroney as Mike Markkula * Matthew Modine as John Sculley * J.

Screenwriter Matt Whiteley began work on the screenplay around the time Steve Jobs took medical leave from Apple to battle pancreatic cancer. Director Joshua Michael Stern stated in an interview that all material for the screenplay was collected via research and interviews: > Mark Hulme, our producer, had an expert team of researchers to comb through > all public records and interviews that had anything to do with Steve Jobs. > Mark, the screenwriter and the research team, also took it upon themselves > to interview quite a large pool of people who either worked at Apple or > worked with Steve to make sure we portrayed as accurate a portrait and > telling of the events possible within the constraints of the film's length. Filming Production began in June 2012 at Jobs' childhood home in Los Altos, California, with the help of Jobs' stepmother, Marilyn Jobs (who still lives there). It was also observed by his sister Patricia. The majority of the film was shot in the Los Angeles region.Russell Carpenter was the cinematographer. In August 2012, production moved to New Delhi and Vrindavan in order to provide the setting for Jobs' 1974 trek to India. Locations include \\"Delhi's Jama Masjid, the Hauz Khas Complex, Safdarjung Tomb and Humayun's Tomb.\\" Aseem Bajaj (Bandit Queen, Chameli, and Khoya Khoya Chand) served as cinematographer for scenes shot in India, though cinematographer Russell Carpenter went to India as well. Bajaj notes that they \\"shot guerrilla style in the crazy and mad by-lanes of Chandni Chowk in Old Delhi. We shot near the Red Fort and the famous Jama Masjid for two full days with multiple cameras spread across everywhere. Ashton stood frozen with the chaos staring right in his face which helped us capture what Steve Jobs must have felt on his visit to India.\\" ==Release== The Business Insider described the film's opening as a box office flop, earning $6.7 million in its first weekend and placing seventh overall. It had a worldwide gross of $42.1 million against its $12 million budget, making the film a modest box office success. ==Reception== On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 28% rating, based on 133 reviews, with a weighted average of 4.95/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"An ambitious but skin-deep portrait of an influential, complex figure, Jobs often has the feel of an over-sentimentalized made-for-TV biopic.\\" Review aggregator Metacritic gave the film a score of 44 out of 100, based on 35 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average rating of \\"B-\\". E! Online said, \\"Critics have taken the film to task for a reach that falls far short of its ambition, marred by its superficial and unsatisfying portrait of an icon who deserved better.\\" Forbes reported that the consensus among critics was \\"mixed positives for Kutcher's performance\\" and a \\"thumbs down for Joshua Michael Stern's film.\\" Robert X. Cringely, author of Accidental Empires and creator of the documentaries Triumph of the Nerds and Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview, argues that \\"the film is beautifully shot and Kutcher's portrayal of Jobs, while not spot-on, is pretty darned good. He certainly has the look down and the walk. But Ashton Kutcher also produced this film and he's definitely a better actor than producer. There are a lot of historical inaccuracies that just don't have to be there. ... The great failing of this film is the same failing as with Walter Isaacson's book: something happened during Steve's NeXT years (which occupy less than 60 seconds of this 122 minute film) that turned Jobs from a brat into a leader, but they don't bother to cover that.\\" Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle states that \\"at its best, it's a good picture, and at its worst, it's almost good.\\" Peter Travers of Rolling Stone suggests that \\"Kutcher nails the genius and narcissism. It's a quietly dazzling performance\\" but also notes that \\"Jobs is a one-man show that needed to go for broke and doesn't. My guess is that Jobs would give it a swat.\\" Contributor for rogerebert.com, Susan Wloszczyna, gave the movie 2/4 stars, saying that, \\"Rather than attempting a deeper plunge behind the whys and wherefores of the elite business-model gospel according to Apple Inc. guru Steve Jobs and ‚Äì more importantly ‚Äì what it says about our culture, the filmmakers follow the easy rise-fall-rise-again blueprint familiar to anyone who has seen an episode of VH1's Behind the Music.\\" She further discusses how Kutcher's performance and the overall movie failed to portray Jobs in the iconic manner that current pop culture suggests even after Jobs' passing. In a movie review for The New York Times, writer Manohla Dargis writes that Jobs was \\"inevitably unsatisfying\\" and a result of a poor performance of the filmmakers rather than the actors themselves. ==Historical accuracy== In a January 2013 interview with The Verge, Steve Wozniak notes that he was approached by the crew of Jobs and given an early script to read. He read it as far as he \\"could stomach it and felt it was crap. The Sony people got in contact with me too and in the end I went with them. You can't do both [films] and be paid.\\" At around the same time, he responded to the first promotional clip for the film on Gizmodo by stating that the \\"personalities are very wrong, although mine is closer ... our relationship was so different than what was portrayed.\\" In August 2013, before the wide release of the film, Kutcher responded to these critiques in a few interviews. In an interview with the Associated Press, Kutcher stated: He reiterated this point in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter by stating that Wozniak \\"is being paid by another movie studio to help support their Steve Jobs film, so he's gonna have an opinion that is connected to that, somewhat.\\" Wozniak responded to Kutcher's comments as well as to the film itself on Gizmodo by stating that \\"either film would have paid me to consult, but the Jobs one already had a script written. I can't take that creative leadership from someone else. And I was turned off by the Jobs script. But I still hoped for a great movie.\\" He also believed several individuals portrayed in the film were inaccurately and/or unfairly portrayed including himself and Steve Jobs. Wozniak reiterated these points in an interview with Bloomberg Television adding that he is \\"really easy to get a hold of, [Kutcher] could have called me and consulted over the phone any time.\\" The Verge noted that \\"Wozniak was in fact invited to consult on the film, but declined after reading the script, saying he and his wife were 'abhorred' by it. Wozniak was a consultant on Aaron Sorkin's 2015 Steve Jobs film. When asked why he did not at least correct the inaccuracies he saw, Wozniak said, 'I have a very busy life, and it came at a very busy time in my life.'\\" In an interview with Slashdot, Daniel Kottke states that he consulted on early versions of the screenplay and notes that \\"Ashton's very good. I have no complaints with him at all, no complaints with his portrayal of Jobs. The complaint that people would rightly have about the film is that it portrays Woz as not having the same vision as Steve Jobs, which is really unfair.\\" He also said that the early versions of the screenplay \\"were painful. Really painful. I forwarded the first draft to Mike Markkula because they wanted his feedback, and Mike took such a bad reaction to it, he wouldn't have anything more to do with the project. By the time it got to the fourth draft, it was okay. It wasn't making me cringe.\\" Kottke also outlines various areas that were both accurate and inaccurate in the film. Bill Fernandez was part of the same interview but states that he didn't see the film because \\"the whole thing is a work of fiction, and I don't want to be upset by all the things that the screenwriter has invented and don't represent the truth.\\" Kottke responded that he didn't think of the film as fiction because \\"I was involved early on in the film, and they really, sincerely tried to make it as accurate as they could.\\" In the same interview, Fernandez and Kottke commented on the characterization of Rod Holt (portrayed by actor Ron Eldard). Kottke disputed the characterization, noting that: \\"What completely cracked us all up is the scene where Rod arrives for the first time. Rod comes up wearing leathers, riding up on a motorcycle with long hair ... he's like this motorcycle dude. It just cracked us all up.\\" Fernandez, who had not seen the film at the time of the interview, was also surprised by this portrayal. Holt, however, (according to Kottke), \\"thought it was hilarious.\\" As for why he may have been characterized this way, Kottke states that, \\"Rod was really into dirt bikes. And I never saw him riding one, but he talked about it all the time. So the author just had him riding up on a motorcycle. I liked that guy. I met him on the set. I had no idea who he was when I met him because he doesn't look at all like Rod, he has long straight hair and he's wearing leathers.\\" Fernandez, who was equally amused by this vision of Holt responded by asking, \\"Who could this possibly be in the Apple universe? ... It seems to me that there's a lot of fan fiction about Apple Computer and about Steve Jobs, and I think that this is the biggest, flashiest piece of fan fiction that there's been to date. Chris Espinosa stated on Twitter, \\"FYI My position at Apple precludes my commenting on the #JobsMovie with the press or public. But I can say that I enjoyed watching the film.\\"Chris Espinosa@Twitter. August 16, 2013.

Much literature focuses on inequality between families, but inequality often exists within families as well. Though within-family inequality is not unique to immigrant families, the processes of migration and assimilation into American society provide new channels through which such inequality may emerge. ==Legal status== Immigrants to the United States vary widely in terms of their citizenship status. Some immigrants may lack documentation altogether. An individual's legal status in the United States determines many of the resources available to him or her. Legal status can thus provide the basis for many inequalities in the home. Mixed-status families The Citizenship Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution guarantees citizenship status to anyone born on United States soil \\"and subject to the jurisdiction thereof\\". This means that, regardless of parents' citizenship status, their children who are born in the United States are full citizens and are eligible for the rights and privileges that such status confers; this is called a mixed immigrant status family. Thus, within mixed-status families are a range of documentation patterns involving siblings: some born in the U.S. with birthright citizenship, some in the process of attempting to obtain documentation, and some fully undocumented. U.S. immigration policies shape the opportunities for 16.6 million mixed immigrant families. The experiences of mixed immigrant status families need to be in sharper focus, especially the effects on children growing up in these families. There are an estimated 5.5 million children with unauthorized immigrant parents, about three-quarters of whom are U.S. born citizens. The nature of immigration policy dehumanizes individuals in mixed status families through practices that threat and harm, such as deportation procedures, which is when a migrant is formally removed from the United States and is banned from reentering. Immigration policies and practices do not only affect the undocumented population itself. However, U.S. born children growing up in families where there are undocumented members living are negatively impacted by these policies. Children living in mixed immigration status households live with fear of deportation threats of parents or themselves. They often feel scared, sad and worried about possible separation. This can be traumatic and have negative effects on the children's well-being. As a result, children may interpret their reality as depriving and cruel. They may process their experiences with a consciousness that mirrors that of their undocumented parents, even though many are U.S. born citizens with all of the benefits rights, and privileges that U.S. citizenship carries. Immigrant children‚Äîdefined as those children under age eighteen who are either foreign-born or U.S.-born to immigrant parents‚Äînow account for one-fourth of the nation's 75 million children. By 2050 they are projected to make up one- third of more than 100 million U.S. children. This highlights that children of immigrants in mixed status families are growing in the United States. Therefore, it is of high importance to understand their experiences in this country and the impact that a mixed status has on the children growing up in these families facing unique needs and challenges. Mixed immigrant families' rights are being violated. When there is family separation through immigration practices, children in mixed status household are denied the right to grow up with their families. They are dehumanized, based on status of their parents. Legal status can thus lead to a restructuring of traditional family roles. Family members who may have previously been the primary breadwinners in the country of origin may be unable to find gainful employment due to their undocumented status. Family members who are legal citizens and thus have access to a wider range of employment opportunities may therefore hold a greater measure of power within the family. When these family members are children, who might traditionally be expected to defer to their elders, such an imbalance in legal status may create an upheaval in the traditional familial relations. Such unequal access to resources can create a power imbalance between family members who have citizenship status and those who do not. An individual's legal status may be used to keep him or her subjugated within the home and, in extreme cases, may prevent him or her from leaving an abusive situation. Access to resources Individuals who hold legal status in the United States enjoy many advantages over those who do not. Differences in legal status are also associated with differing access to various resources such as employment opportunities, as well as a host of social benefits. In addition, children in mixed-status families are at-risk and precisely the types of clients targeted by many social services, social workers, and public health organizations. For example, Hispanics in general are less likely to be insured, within the pan-ethnic Hispanic population, immigrants without legal authorization are less likely to have employer coverage and are currently excluded from purchasing coverage from the federal exchange in the Affordable Care Act. Employment opportunities Even when undocumented individuals are employed, their positions are often precarious. Approximately 40% of immigrant workers in low-wage jobs are undocumented. A lack of formal documentation means that many of these individuals must find work in the informal economy where there is a lack of protection for worker rights. Undocumented workers may have difficulty obtaining justice in cases of mistreatment since employers can easily threaten them with deportation. This leaves these immigrant workers vulnerable to exploitation. Exploitation may take many forms, one of these being wage theft. While there are regulations to protect the rights of workers, such as laws that cover private domestic work, these policies are often underutilized since workers may be unaware of their existence. Individuals who lack formal documentation may also feel less empowered to seek legal recourse because of fear of having their undocumented status made known. Family members with legal status are more likely to have access to jobs with higher pay and benefits. Second generation immigrants in the United States, who are most likely full citizens, tend to have higher earnings and are less likely to be in poverty than first generation immigrants, some of whom lack formal legal status.\\"Nation's Foreign-Born Population Nears 37 Million\\". Press Release. U.S. Census Bureau. October 19, 2010. (accessed March 2, 2012). Thus, the unequal access to employment opportunities can generate inequality among family members of different legal statuses. Social benefits Citizens of the United States are entitled to a host of social benefits. Government programs such as Food Stamps and Medicaid can provide support for low-income families. However, children who are U.S. citizens may not always be able to fully enjoy these benefits. Immigrant parents with limited English language ability may be unaware they are eligible for such benefits, or may not know how to take advantage of social welfare programs. Even legal non-citizens may find that their access to social supports is restricted due to welfare reforms. In addition, parents who are undocumented may be afraid to deal with government agencies, even if their citizen children are eligible for such assistance programs. When there is risk of deportation, it affects the likelihood of a mixed-status mother's use social services. The anti-immigrant sentiment increases this and then would deter mixed-status mothers to not to participate in government programs in which their U.S. born children are eligible to receive. Health care Undocumented immigrants in mixed status families tend to work in jobs that do not provide employee based health insurance and/or employed in occupations that pay off the books. Moreover, we can also expect that poor noncitizen children whose parents lack job-based coverage have lower rates of participation than poor citizen children of U.S. citizens. The lack of insurance for citizen children in mixed-status families means that these children are less likely to receive timely care for acute conditions, and less likely to have their chronic conditions diagnosed and appropriately managed. ==Gender== Inequality in the family may occur along gender lines. This is not an issue unique to immigrant families. In many cultures around the world, men have traditionally held more power than women. Among families in the United States alone, gender inequality often exists, which is evident in the unequal sharing of household labor. The process of immigration entails a move to a new country, whose culture may have values that differ greatly from those of the home culture. In this transition from one geographical and social context to another, new forms of gender inequality can arise. Shifts in gender roles The United States prides itself on being a society that supports gender equality. While, in reality, much gender inequality persists, there are indeed laws in place to protect the equal rights of everyone, regardless of gender. Depending on the home country, U.S. society may contain a much higher level of gender equality than immigrants are accustomed to, particularly if immigrants come from a traditionally patriarchal society. The disparity in gender norms between different cultures may cause gender roles in the family to shift. Immigrants may find that they are a part of a lower socioeconomic status group in the United States than they were in their home country. Immigration research shows that it is rarely the poorest citizens of the sending countries that immigrate to the United States, simply because they cannot afford the associated costs. This is particularly true when they come from countries where the cost of living is not as high as in the United States. Individuals who may have held professional occupations in their country of origin may find themselves in low-paying jobs if their certifications are not recognized by the United States. When families migrate to the United States from a country with a patriarchal society, men in particular may experience a loss of status. While women are also affected by the family's loss of status, they may simultaneously experience a boost in their own status relative to men because of the greater gender equality present in American society. Men, who may have been accustomed to filling the role of sole \\"breadwinner\\" in their home country may find themselves unable to do so in the United States. This is due both to restricted access to jobs and to prevalence of new immigrants in the low-wage sector. Immigrants in these jobs are unlikely to be able to support their entire families solely on their earnings. The increase in the number of female-dominated industries in the United States means that there are often more employment options for women in the low-wage sector than for men. If women begin to take a more active role in financially providing for their family, this is generally accompanied by enhanced status within the family. Domestic violence While the rate of domestic violence among immigrant groups does not differ from that of the general population, immigrant victims of domestic violence may face additional challenges. While victims can be of either gender, women may be especially vulnerable. The process of immigrating to another country and adjusting to American culture can be stressful, increasing the likelihood of domestic violence. Factors such as limited English language ability, legal status, and lack of social ties may create additional barriers for those trying to escape such situations. Even when a woman does have access to social services that could help her escape an abusive situation, cultural norms may make it difficult for her to leave. If a woman decides to leave an abusive spouse she may run the risk of social ostracism and of bringing shame to her family. Thus, a woman may choose to stay and suffer abuse rather than face the social consequences of leaving her husband. On the other hand, some individuals may actually find it easier to escape situations of abuse in the United States than they would have in their countries of origin. Among some immigrants there is much criticism of the way in which women in particular have been changed by American culture. Women may be seen as too Americanized because of the way they dress or their lack of deference to men. The general support for gender equality within American society can undermine traditional power hierarchies within the family in which men had control over the actions of women. One of the ways that such power is undermined is through the presence of laws against domestic violence. In some patriarchal societies, husbands may have complete control over their wives, including control over their bodies. U.S. laws do not support this sort of arrangement and women who are aware of their rights can utilize formal legal institutions to combat such gender imbalances within the family. The ability of government authorities to intervene in the realm of the family can undermine the traditional power balance and leave men feeling dispossessed. Relationships across national borders Families do not always immigrate as one unit. Given the various legal and economical factors associated with transnational migration, certain family members may find it easier to immigrate to the United States than others. In other cases, individuals may immigrate to the United States as an employment strategy, with no intention of permanently relocating their family to the U.S. The distribution of family members across national borders can generate unique forms of inequality within the families of immigrants. Global relationships as a strategy to uphold gender roles Some immigrants, particularly those from cultures in which women are subordinate to men, may express disapproval about the influence of American culture on girls and women. Men in particular may perceive women from their own cultural heritage who have assimilated into American society as too \\"independent\\" and thus incompatible with the traditional family structures that such men may wish to uphold. This may cause men to seek out spouses from their home countries, believing these women will be more willing to take on the traditional household duties of a wife. When these women come to the United States they may experience isolation, particularly if they do not have family members or friends already in the U.S. In such instances, men often control women's access to outside resources and support systems, creating a power imbalance within the home. In instances of domestic violence, this isolation may make it difficult for women to find the help they need. Transnational families Migration is often used as an employment strategy. Although many individuals choose to migrate permanently to another country, others may migrate on a more temporary basis or do so seasonally. When families do not all migrate together, they must negotiate family relationships across national borders. Which family members migrate and which stay behind can be important determinants of how inequality may manifest itself in these transnational families. Among families from Latin American countries, it is often the case that men will travel abroad to work. This means that the women in these families do the bulk of the day-to-day caring for the family. In more recent years, scholars have noted a shift in the demographics of migrant workers. Particularly in Asian countries, but also in Latin American countries, a growing number of women are traveling abroad for jobs as domestic and service workers. In many of these cases, women take on jobs caring for the children of families in wealthier nations, while leaving their own children in the country of origin. This can mean that their own children are not well-cared for and may suffer as a result. Distribution of household labor Although women may take a greater role in providing for the family financially, this does not always mean that men take on a greater share of the housework. Studies on Taiwanese and Korean immigrants in New York found that the distribution of household labor in the home varied with class. In general, husbands in families belonging to the professional class were more likely to take on household work than in those belonging to the working class. Among Chicano families belonging to the professional class, a study found that husbands took on an even greater share of the household labor when compared to professional- class families from other ethnic groups. These studies found, however, that even among immigrant families in the professional class, wives still did the bulk of the work. Among many Vietnamese immigrant families, reproductive labor is still seen as the responsibility of women. In the United States, the scope of this household work is expanded to include dealing with larger institutions like schools, utility companies, and the health-care system. Women may also take over the task of finding housing and dealing with landlords. Language barriers and the threat of feeling powerless may lead men to avoid interactions with such bureaucracies, leaving the job of navigating these complex systems to women. This results in women having superior knowledge of the workings of such systems. Among Vietnamese immigrants, women are often thought of as experts on health-care, and men may defer to women since they have more knowledge of how the health-care system operates. In the case of Vietnamese immigrants, although women were still expected to take responsibility for a disproportionate amount of household-related labor, the change in the nature of such labor gives them the skills and the confidence to know how to deal with societal institutions. This knowledge provides women with a certain amount of leverage within the household and provides them with a greater amount of social and cultural capital relative to men. ==Generation== Inequality may exist between members of different generations within a family. Assimilation into American society may create changes in the traditional family structure, particularly among immigrants who come from cultures in which age is a strong determinant of status and power. American culture places a high value on individuality. The high importance placed on self-determination in American culture may go against the traditional values of cultures in which children are expected to obey and respect the wishes of their parents in all facets of their lives. The migration process is often stressful and can lead to conflicts between family members, particularly those of different generations. Degree of assimilation Among many immigrant families, members of the younger generation tend to assimilate to American culture at a faster rate than members of older generations. This can create divides along generational lines. Members of the older generation may dislike the influence that American culture has on the younger generation, particularly shifts from communal values to a more individualistic mindset. On the other hand, members of the younger generation may view their elders as too set in their ways and out of touch with American society. Such sentiments can lead to conflict between family members. Points of contention include clothing, speech, displaying respect for elders, and dating practices. Family members who identify more with the culture of their home country may experience frustration when they attempt to instill their cultural values into younger family members. Popular media, schools, and peers act as powerful socializing agents and members of the older generation may feel that they cannot compete with these pervasive cultural and social forces. Parents may blame television and magazines for the unwanted change they see in their children and if they decide to act by cracking down on their children's access to popular media, this may lead to further generational schisms. These divides can also occur between members of the same generation, particularly between older siblings who may identify more strongly with their home country and younger siblings who may identify more with American culture. This is especially likely to occur when older siblings belong to the 1.5 generation, meaning that they were born abroad, and younger siblings were born in the United States. In many societies, older siblings are given greater responsibilities and may feel more pressure from parents to set a good example for their younger siblings by performing well in school and obtaining success. At the same time, this greater responsibility often affords older siblings a greater degree of power within the family. Older siblings may therefore also be more likely to uphold their parents' traditional values because of the power it affords them within the family. In America's more egalitarian culture, power hierarchies based on age are less likely to be accepted. Younger siblings may therefore reject the authority of their older siblings, fostering tensions within the family. The migration process can therefore destabilize traditional power hierarchies within the family based on age and in some cases may lead to a reversal of such hierarchies. Regardless of whether tension exists among members of different generations or members of the same generation, degree of assimilation may pave the way for divisions within the family. Language proficiency In many immigrant families, members of the younger generation have greater English language proficiency than their elders. In families where parents may know little to no English, children may act as interpreters. Young children may therefore be involved in important family matters, including finances. In cases where children are in charge of paying bills, they may be in a position to take a portion of their parents' money for their own use. Even when this is not the case, the role of interpreter gives a particular family member a certain measure of control over other family members who are unable to communicate as well in English. Cultural capital An interesting aspect of cultural capital that sometimes comes into play in immigrant families is familiarity with American laws. Parents may find that U.S. law is in conflict with their traditional means of disciplining their children. While parents may be accustomed to certain parental rights in their home country, these rights may not be protected in American society. There may be cases in which outside agents‚Äîeither school officials, police officers, or government officials‚Äîbecome involved in conflicts between parents and children. This is particularly true in cases of alleged physical abuse. Children, who may be more familiar with American laws, can use this knowledge to gain assistance from individuals outside of the family. The involvement of outside agents may tip the traditional power balance within the family and affords family members who are more familiar with the rules and norms of the United States a certain degree of power over family members who are not as familiar with these laws. Among immigrants who come from cultures with strict hierarchies based on age, such interventions can be devastating to parents who may feel that their authority has been undermined. Family members who are better assimilated into American culture are more able, and probably more likely, to utilize their knowledge of American laws to change the dynamics of family relations. This generates inequality based on degree of assimilation since those who are less assimilated are more likely to lose face as the result of the penetration of such laws into the traditionally private domain of the family.  Duality of exclusion  Nichollas Walter in his study of youth immigrants reveal that the young immigrants constantly encounters the duality of exclusion and inclusion in their life. They often define themselves as Americans because their philosophies and mindsets are no different from other contemporary Americans. However, at the same time, they feel excluded in real life because they cannot easily debunk their undocumented immigrant status. This experience often hampers a stable formation of identity among these young second- generations. Consequently, due to their discouraging youth period, these young immigrants are often discouraged to participate in the politics even after they gained appropriate legal status for residency in the United States. Recently, there have been #DREAMers online movements on different social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter. In fact, social media has become a key tool for the younger immigrant population in their process of assimilating into the U.S. society. By publicly sharing their narratives as undocumented immigrants, these young immigrants could successfully increase their political representation and solidify a sense of personal identity. Social mobility and resources Parents may feel that their authority over their children is weakened because there are greater resources available in the United States and children are thus less dependent upon their parents for financial support. Some parents believe that children's greater independence also makes them less likely to heed parent's teachings and advice. In particular, children in immigrant families may have greater access to education and work opportunities. These, in turn, can help facilitate social mobility, raising the socioeconomic status of subsequent generations of immigrants relative to first generation immigrants (see Second generation immigrants in the United States). Education In many immigrants' countries of origin, education is not free. Children therefore rely on their parents for the fees necessary to obtain an education. In some cases, this means that children are unable to complete their education because their parents are unable to pay the school fees or would rather invest that money someplace else, perhaps in another child's education. Girls, in particular, may be unlikely to complete their education because of many cultures' preference for boys. After immigrating to the United States, all children have access to free education through high school, and can apply for scholarships to help fund a college education as well. While parental contributions are still important, especially in the case of college tuition, this removes many of the barriers to educational achievement and also means that parents no longer have as much control over their children's access to educational opportunities. Among some immigrant groups, especially those who come from origin countries in which education is not free or widely available, first-generation immigrants may have had little formal schooling. Immigrant parents tend to have lower levels of formal schooling than U.S.-born parents. Low levels of education among parents can have a negative impact on their children's ability to succeed in school. On the other hand, the effort that these immigrant parents put into trying to help their children do well in school can have a significant impact on the academic achievement of students. Parents thus have some measure of control over the likelihood that their children will succeed in school. If children perceive their parents as supportive, they will be more likely to do well in their academic endeavors, regardless of the practical help their parents are actually able to provide. If parents are not invested in their children's success in school‚Äîor if they create barriers to children's education by asking children to work rather than attend school‚Äîthis lack of emotional support can have a negative impact on children's likelihood of educational success. Children who were born before the family immigrated to the United States may have more difficulty succeeding academically than children who were born after the move to the United States, or who were very young at the time of immigration. This is likely due to the fact children who were born in the United States, or immigrated at a very early age, are more likely to be assimilated into American culture and to possess greater levels of English language ability than children who were born before the family immigrated. Other research confirms the fact that second generation groups tend to have higher levels of academic achievement than first generation groups. Employment opportunities First generation immigrants may be more likely to hold \\"ethnic 'niche' occupations\\" as well as occupations in low-wage sectors. This occupational concentration provides few opportunities for advancement beyond relatively low-wage service-sector jobs. The employment opportunities available to immigrants are often dependent on their English language proficiency. Recent immigrants are less likely to be fluent in English which may only give them access to low-wage jobs where English proficiency is not as important. Recent immigrants are thus overrepresented in low-wage occupations. Subsequent generations, however, are less likely to be so occupationally concentrated by ethnicity and nationality. Members of later generations generally have access to a wider range of jobs which provide them with greater opportunities for upward social mobility. ==See also== *Birthright citizenship in the United States *Care work *Educational inequality *Feminization of migration *Gender inequality in the United States *Gender role *Immigrant health care in the United States *Immigration to the United States *Income inequality in the United States *Intra-household bargaining *Migrant worker *Second generation immigrants in the United States *Social inequality *Social mobility *Sociology of the family *Transnational marriage *Work-family balance in the United States ==References== Category:Cultural assimilation Category:Family in the United States Immigrants Category:Immigration to the United States Category:Social inequality ","title":"Inequality within immigrant families in the United States"},{"id":"35304484","text":"Sheykhlar or Shaikhlar or Shaykhlyar () may refer to various places in Iran: *Sheykhlar, Ardabil *Sheykhlar, East Azerbaijan *Sheykhlar, Marand, East Azerbaijan Province *Sheykhlar, Golestan *Sheykhlar, Qazvin *Sheykhlar, West Azerbaijan *Sheykhlar-e Mazari, West Azerbaijan Province *Sheykhlar, Zanjan *Sheykhlar, Khodabandeh, Zanjan province ==See also== *Shikhlar, Armenia *Sheykhlu (disambiguation), various places in Iran ","title":"Sheykhlar"},{"id":"35304488","text":"Math√©o Jacquemoud (born July 17, 1990) is a French ski mountaineer.

The election used the 13 wards created as a result of the Local Governance (Scotland) Act 2004, with each ward electing three or four Councillors using the single transferable vote system a form of proportional representation, with 43 Councillors elected. Local political activist Renee Slater caused great controversy when she registered a mannequin doll as 'Helena Torry' in the Hazlehead/Ashley/Queens Cross ward. This was withdrawn soon after being spotted and a report has been issued to Grampian Police. The election saw the Scottish Liberal Democrats decimated as they lost two thirds of their Councillors. The Scottish National Party secured 3 gains copper-fastening their by-election gains during the 2007-2012 term. However, it was Labour who proved to be the biggest winners with 7 gains and 17 total seats as they secured first place. Independents gained 2 seats while the Tories lost 2 seats. On 9 May an agreement was reached to form a coalition. The coalition was formed between the Scottish Labour Party, the Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party and three Independent councillors. Labour had 17 seats, the Tories contributed three and there were three independent members. ==Election results == Note: The net gain/loss and percentage changes relate to the result of the previous Scottish local elections on 3 May 2007.

It was released on 2 April 2012 in the United Kingdom, on the band's Nul Records. Unlike their four previous records, the disc was recorded entirely a cappella and features near to none instrumentation apart from vocals. The release of the album was accompanied by an acoustic and a cappella UK tour, during which they notably opened for the Red Hot Chili Peppers. The band went on a break following this tour, before reuniting in 2018, and releasing an album in 2019, Powers. == Background == The Futureheads appeared on Jo Whiley's Live Lounge on BBC Radio 1, on 17 April 2010, where they played a four-part harmony version of Kelis' \\"Acapella\\" song. They had arranged this cover in about 30 minutes, before debuting it live on the radio, with great success. The band later described this experience as \\"the most exciting thing\\" they'd ever done. Guitarist and vocalist Ross Millard was the first to propose the idea of recording such an album, and the Live Lounge performance acted as \\"the seed of the catalyst\\" for the project. In September 2011, the band contributed an a cappella cover of \\"Robot,\\" a song taken from their debut self-titled album, to the NExEA charity compilation for the Disaster Emergency Committee‚Äôs East Africa Crisis Appeal. It was later revealed that this track was part of their upcoming Rant album. On 15 February 2012, the album was officially announced on the band's official website, and revealed to be \\"an album with no instrumentation, just the four of [them], in the studio, arranging songs for the human voice.\\" The tracklist was also revealed, consisting of reinterpretations of past Futureheads tracks (such as earlier- revealed \\"Robot\\"), covers of pop songs (including Kelis' \\"Acapella\\") and folk classics. The announcement also detailed the reasons behind the making of this album: Commenting on track choices, bandleader Barry Hyde explained to NME that the cover of Black Eyed Peas' \\"Meet Me Halfway\\" was made at his request. He explained finding the track \\"amazing, melodically speaking\\", and liking the idea of covering a song previously sung by women. The other Futureheads members were at first unsure of this choice, but after reworking its basic elements and removing the rap section that was \\"a step too far\\", the track made its way to the record. == Recording and musical style == The Futureheads have previously been renowned for their work with vocal harmonies, which they started working on because of technical issues. Hyde explained in July 2011: \\"It was because the PA wasn‚Äôt loud enough. I‚Äôd be stood around singing and I remember thinking, 'Why is it just me singing?' So the others all started to join in,\\" citing the Beach Boys as an inspiration. He also referred to The Flying Pickets, an a cappella vocal group active in the 1980s, although \\"a bit asexual\\" sounding, while the band aimed for a rougher sound. Hyde valued the \\"unique position\\" that being able to produce such an album put them in. Commenting on the departure from the band's previous style, he said: Recording sessions took place at First Avenue in Heaton, Newcastle with recording engineer Dave Curle throughout 2011, with each song on the album taking over 100 takes. The band told it was \\"a nightmare\\" to make all of them be in tune and work together and they would leave the studio ‚Äúin a state of ultimate exhaustion,‚Äù after recording each day. == Touring == Following the release of the album, the band went on a full a cappella and acoustic UK tour. This tour took them to their hometown's Stadium of Light on 24 June 2012, where they opened for the Red Hot Chili Peppers on their I'm with You World Tour. They were nominated in the \\"Best Event Durham\\" category of The Journal Culture Awards for their September 2012 concert in the Durham Cathedral. They lost to A Sign in Space, which took place during the BRASS: Durham International Festival, but played at the event which was held on 22 April 2013. == Critical reception == At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 74, based on 13 reviews. Mayer Nissim of Digital Spy referred to this release as a \\"natural step\\" for the band, saluting the decision to mix reworkings of their songs with pop covers and traditional songs. According to him, the record would have fared better \\"as a shorter mini-album or EP,\\" but salutes the fact the band tried \\"something different,\\" \\"really chucking themselves into it.\\" Danny Wright of This Is Fake DIY also recognized this album makes \\"perfect sense\\" for the band, and describes it as \\"a fun and genuinely touching set of songs.\\" Andy Gill of The Independant particularly praised the band's cover of \\"Meet Me Halfway,\\" turning the Black Eyed Peas song into \\"something new and entirely original.\\" Robert Cooke of Drowned in Sound commented that this \\"isn‚Äôt the sort of album you‚Äôre going to listen to every day.\\" However, he wrote that this is \\"a timely reminder of what it was that set The Futureheads apart from their peers back in 2004 ‚Äì they are true innovators, completely distinctive, occasionally mad, but still pretty damn marvellous.\\" Laura Snapes of NME noted that even though this is not \\"the record that‚Äôs going to restore The Futureheads to their former stature,\\" it‚Äôs \\"glorious indeed.\\" Fraser McAlpine of BBC called Rant a \\"stunt album,\\" but an \\"exhilarating\\" one, and one \\"that more than whets the appetite for whatever it is they choose to do next.\\" Jill Greenaway from the Reading Museum qualified the cover of \\"Sumer Is Icumen In\\" as \\"enormous fun,\\" and praised the idea of a having a post-punk band covering what is believed to be the oldest written in the English language.  Accolades  Rant was nominated for the Artrocker Album of the Year Awards in 2012, but lost the award to Django Django's eponymous album. Their cover of Sparks' \\"The No. 1 Song in Heaven,\\" released in April 2012 as a single, peaked at number 55 on the UK Physical Singles Chart. == Track listing ==  Bonus tracks  # \\"Heartbeat Song\\" ‚Äì 1:48 == Personnel ==  The Futureheads  * Ross Millard ‚Äì vocals * Dave Hyde ‚Äì vocals * Barry Hyde ‚Äì vocals * David \\"Jaff\\" Craig ‚Äì vocals  Technical personnel  * Dave Curle ‚Äì producer, recording engineer * Stuart Hardie ‚Äì artwork == References  External links == * Category:2012 albums Category:The Futureheads albums Category:Nul Records albums Category:A cappella albums ","title":"Rant (The Futureheads album)"},{"id":"35304543","text":"Tuinan (, also Romanized as ≈¢≈´ƒ´nƒÅn; also known as ≈¢≈´nƒ´ƒÅn and T≈´nƒ´ƒÅn) is a village in Kuhgir Rural District, Tarom Sofla District, Qazvin County, Qazvin Province, Iran.

He graduated in medicine in 1908, with a dissertation on dementia praecox. In 1910 he married Alice Seckelson.Ludger M. Hermanns, 'Ernst Simmel', International Dictionary of Psychoanalysis, Gale, 2005. Reprinted online by answers.com. In 1913 he helped found the Society of Socialist Physicians (VS√Ñ), and became one of the pioneers of Social Medicine. During World War I he headed a hospital for psychiatric casualties of war in Posen; self-taught in psychoanalysis, he introduced the use of psychodynamic categories there. His pioneering work on the treatment of war neurosis with psychoanalytic methods drew him to the attention of Sigmund Freud,Peter Gay, Freud: A Life for Our Time (1989) p. 376 who would build explicitly on his work in Group Psychology and the Analysis of the Ego (1921).Sigmund Freud, Civilization, Society and Religion (PFL 12) p. 124 After the war, Simmel received a training analysis with Karl Abraham ‚Äî another leading analyst who rated the serious young physician very highlyElizabeth Ann Danto, Freud's Free Clinics (2007) p. 51 ‚Äî and himself provided the writer Alfred D√∂blin with training analysis. Simmel helped Abraham and Max Eitingon found the Berlin Psychoanalytic Institute in 1920, the world's first psychoanalytic clinic providing free analytic help for indigent patients: between 1920 and 1930, 1,955 consultations took place there, 721 resulting in some form of psychoanalysis.Peter Gay, Freud: A Life for Our Time (1989) p. 462 Simmel had played a model role in the institution by insisting from the start on confidentiality and equal treatment for non- paying as for paying analysands.Danto, p. 97 Simmel was President of the Society of Socialist Physicians from 1924 to 1933, and President of the Berlin Psychoanalytic Society from 1926 to 1930. In 1927 he founded a sanatorium at Tegel Palace in Tegel, which lasted until bankruptcy forced the sanitorium to close in 1931. Freud was his guest there during several visits to Berlin, and the sanatorium for five years played an innovative role in new clinical developments.Danto, p. 185 In 1929 he married his second wife, Hertha Br√ºggemann. Emigrating to the United States to escape Hitler in 1934, he was briefly at the Topeka Psychoanalytic Institute before settling in Los Angeles, where he was a founding member of what became the Los Angeles Psychoanalytic Society and Institute (LAPSI). Peck, John S., 'Ernst Simmel: psychoanalytic pioneering in California', in F. Alexander, S. Eisenstein, M. Grotjahn (eds.), Psychoanalytic pioneers, New York: Basic Books, 1966. ==Studies== Simmel was one of the discoverers of the \\"war neuroses\\", and stressed the part played in them by both the superego and the revival of forgotten infantile traumas.Otto Fenichel, The Psychoanalytic Theory of the Neuroses (London 1946) p. 120-6 He also did pioneering work on gambling, seeing it as a regressive attempt to obtain by force sought after narcissistic supply.Jon Halliday/Peter Fuller eds., The Psychology of Gambling (1974) p. 218 Simmel maintained that ‚Äúon the developmental path of mankind, games of chance are a reservoir for the anal- sadistic impulses held in a state of repression‚Äù, and that gambling served to satisfy the ‚Äúbisexual ideal which the Narcissus finds in himself‚Äù.Quoted in Halliday/Fuller, p. 16 Among other topics covered in the ten or so papers he published between 1918 and 1937 were screen memories; sadism in sex murderers; psychosomatic defences against psychosis; and hypochondriasis.Fenichel, pp. 257, 263, 356, 529 and 654 With respect to the latter, he focused on the role of introjects in affecting the hypochodriacally disturbed part of the body, writing that: ‚ÄúThe introjected parental substitute becomes the morbid material which must be eliminated if the patient is to recover‚Äù.Fenichel, p. 263 Simmel also pioneered the psychoanalytic study of alcoholism, considering alcoholic exaltation as an artificial mania,Fenichel, p. 378 and in his last paper (1948) urging future co-operation intreatment with Alcoholics Anonymous.Jerome D. Levine, Introduction to Alcoholism Counselling (1995) p. 158 Through such studies, Simmel played a significant part in ensuring that psychoanalytic theory was extended from individual diseases to include cultural issues and social situations.Danto, p. 204 For all his theoretical radicalism, however, Simmel's reputation as an analyst was for an austere and scrupulously meticulous analytic technique.Danto, p. 232 Anti-Semitism study One of Simmel's abiding contributions was made in the 1946 anthology on Anti-Semitism ‚Äî a collaborative work of psychoanalysts and social theorists based on the contributions to a 1944 symposium held in San Francisco. Other contributors were Theodor W. Adorno, Bernhard Berliner, Otto Fenichel, Else Frenkel- Brunswick, Max Horkheimer and Douglass W. Orr. In Simmel's own paper ‚Äî \\"Anti- Semitism and mass psychopathology\\" ‚Äî he interprets antisemitism on the basis of Freud's critical exploration of myth in his book Moses and Monotheism (1939). Simmel explained the anti-semitic complex in terms of irrational impulses in individuals and groups which were aimed at overcoming pathological disorders. A reversion to infantile modes of denying external reality (reaching back to stages of development dominated by the death drive), in Simmel's model anti-semitism appeared as a mass psychosis that nevertheless enabled the individual to compensate for psychological deficits, in such a way as to remain socially integrated and relatively intact psychologically: \\"The flight into mass psychosis is not only a flight from reality but also from individual insanity\\".Simmel, quoted in Werner Bergmann, Error without Trial (1988) p. 18 ==Papers== Simmel's papers are held at the Library of the New Center for Psychoanalysis in Los Angeles, and in special collections at UCLA.Russell Jacoby, The repression of psychoanalysis: Otto Fenichel and the political Freudians, University of Chicago Press, 1986, p.164 ==See alsoWorks== * Kriegs-Neurosen und \\"Psychisches Trauma\\", Munich & Leipzig: Otto Nemnich, 1918. * 'On the Psychoanalysis of War Neurosis', 1919.

It had an estimated magnitude ranging from 7.7 to 8.2 on the moment magnitude scale and a maximum perceived intensity of XI (Extreme) on the Mercalli intensity scale. It triggered a tsunami and caused at least 1,543 deaths. The earthquake caused an area of subsidence that formed the Sindri Lake and a local zone of uplift to the north about 80 km long, 6 km wide and 6 m high that dammed the Koree / Kori / Puran / Nara river. This natural dam was known as the Allah Bund (\\"Dam of God\\"). ==Tectonic setting== The Kutch District of modern-day Gujarat lies 3‚Äì400 km from the plate boundary between the Indian Plate and the Eurasian Plate, but the current tectonics is still governed by the effects of the continuing continental collision along this boundary. During the break-up of Gondwana in the Jurassic period, this area was affected by rifting with a roughly west‚Äìeast trend. During the collision with Eurasia the area has undergone shortening, involving both reactivation of the original rift faults and development of new low-angle thrust faults. The related folding has formed a series of ranges, particularly in central Kutch. The focal mechanism of most earthquakes is consistent with reverse faulting on reactivated rift faults. The 2001 Gujarat earthquake was caused by movement on a previously unknown south-dipping fault, trending parallel to the inferred rift structures. ==Earthquake== The earthquake lasted for two to three minutes. It was felt over an enormous area, from Chennai to Kolkata in the east, as far north as Kathmandu and as far west as Balochistan. The mainshock was followed by prolonged aftershock activity, with major earthquakes continuing for at least 50 years, including one with estimated magnitude of more than 6.5 in 1846. Maximum displacement during the earthquake is estimated at 12 m, based on the height of the bund and the amount of subsidence to the south. Combined with a lateral extent of at least 80 km, this gives an estimated magnitude of 7.7¬±2. This matches well with magnitudes estimated using both the total felt area and the area of VIII intensity. Other estimates based on intensity measurements give magnitudes as high as 8.2. Modelling of the surface deformation indicates that the fault that slipped during the earthquake dipped to the north at between about 50‚Äì67¬∞. As faults that dip in excess of 50¬∞ are normally unfavourable for slip, it has been suggested that there was relatively high pore-fluid pressure developed at depth to allow this displacement to occur. There is evidence that the Indus river shifted westwards after this earthquake. Allah Bund 1854 map of the region by George Bellas Greenough The most obvious topographic effect of this earthquake was the formation of a ridge about 6 m high, extending for 80 km (possibly as much as 150 km) that formed a natural dam across the Puran river. To distinguish it from the man-made dams that were common in the region, the uplifted area became known as the Allah Bund, or Dam of God. The mound produced had a markedly asymmetric geometry, with a shorter and steeper south- dipping margin, about 600 m wide and a dip of 0.65¬∞, and a broader north- dipping margin over 5 km wide with a dip of only about 0.05¬∞. Sindri Lake Sindri Lake, with a surface area of more than 1,000 km2, was formed due to subsidence of up to 3 m south of the Allah Bund. Initially, the lake was cut off from the river (damming further upstream had stopped the flow) and was filled with seawater. On the western margin of the lake a small delta built out from the eastern part of the larger Indus Delta. After 1826 the river broke through the artificial dam and eventually broke through the bund itself, causing the lake to become freshwater again. 1956 Anjar earthquake The 1956 Anjar earthquake was due to reverse faulting, similar in type to that which is thought to have caused the 1819 Rann of Kutch earthquake. 2001 Bhuj earthquake Changes in stress caused by coulomb stress transfer due to the 1819 earthquake may have been sufficient to trigger the 2001 Bhuj earthquake and other historic earthquakes that occurred in the region during the intervening period. ==Tsunami== There was a local tsunami that flooded the area known as the Great Rann immediately after the earthquake. The fort at Sindri was destroyed by the earthquake and then partly submerged by the tsunami, \\"forcing survivors to climb to the top of the ruins\\". ==Damage== The towns of Kothari, Mothala, Naliya and Vinzan suffered particularly heavy damage. Anjar, Bhuj, Lakhpat, Mandvi and Tera were also severely affected. At least 1,543 people were killed in the larger towns; the number of casualties in smaller towns and villages is unknown. There was some degree of damage to buildings over most of Gujarat, including the destruction of the \\"shaking minarets\\" of the Jama Masjid in Ahmedabad. At Jaisalmer in Rajasthan, \\"at least 500 guests were smothered at a wedding feast\\". ==See also== * List of earthquakes in India * List of historical earthquakes * List of historical tsunamis ==References== 1819 Rann Category:1819 earthquakes Category:Kutch district Category:History of Gujarat Category:Disasters in Gujarat Category:1819 in India Category:History of Kutch 1819 Rann Category:19th-century tsunamis Category:June 1819 events ","title":"1819 Rann of Kutch earthquake"},{"id":"35304900","text":"The Church of the Nativity of the Theotokos on Peryn (, Tserkov Rozhdestva Bogoroditsy na Peryni) in the environs of Veliky Novgorod is one of the city's oldest churches, dating from the 1220s.

The building has been designated an architectural monument of federal significance (#5310037007). Presumably, the church was built on a site previously consecrated to the pagan god Perun, hence the name. The first church on the site was built in 991. Later, it became a part of a monastery. The current church was built in the 1220s. It was fully restored after World War II and returned to the Russian Orthodox Church in the 1990s. The church is built of flat bricks and stone.

Like ShareData, American Game Cartridges was headquartered in Chandler, Arizona. AGC published three video games for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) in 1990. Prior to the founding of American Game Cartridges, ShareData hired Richard C. Frick as Vice President of Product Development. Frick worked previously at Atari Games, and had some experience with their console game subsidiary, Tengen. Tengen was one of several game developers who rejected the contract terms that Nintendo imposed on its licensees. Instead, such developers published unlicensed games that defeated the NES's lockout chip. Frick was acquainted with this strategy, and applied it at ShareData's new company, American Game Cartridges. To defeat the NES's lockout chip, called 10NES, AGC licensed technology from Color Dreams. AGC also licensed two titles from arcade game manufacturer Exidy: Chiller (1986) and Death Race (1976), which they adapted to the NES in 1990. Chiller was AGC's first game release, and was also ShareData's first title for the NES. Death Race quickly followed, as did an original work called Shockwave (1990). Keeping with ShareData's business model of producing low-cost video games, AGC attempted to undersell their competition by as much as 30%. However, debts mounted throughout 1991, and by the fourth quarter AGC's creditors were trying to force the company into a reorganization under Chapter 11 of the United States' Bankruptcy Code. ShareData itself was among the creditors pressuring American Game Cartridges, and American Game Cartridges filed for reorganization under Chapter 11 soon after. They remained in Chapter 11 until January 1994, when they finally filed their plan to reorganize. Richard Frick left ShareData and American Game Cartridges amidst these difficulties, and started another unlicensed NES game development company called American Video Entertainment. Meanwhile, developer Keith Rupp of American Game Cartridges completed a fourth title, Wally Bear and the NO! Gang, but AGC's financial difficulties preempted its release. Frick's new company secured the rights to the game, and published it in 1992. American Game Cartridges planned several other game releases, including a conversion of Exidy's Crossbow (1983), but was unable to complete development. ==See also== *Camerica *Hacker International *Home Entertainment Suppliers *List of Nintendo Entertainment System games *Video game publisher ==References== Category:Companies based in Chandler, Arizona Category:Video game companies established in 1990 Category:Video game companies disestablished in 1994 Category:Companies that filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 1991 Category:Defunct video game companies of the United States Category:Video game development companies Category:Video game publishers ","title":"American Game Cartridges"},{"id":"35305011","text":"WAIP may refer to: * WAIP-LP, a low-power radio station (103.9 FM) licensed to serve Gulfport, Mississippi, United States * WHUC, a radio station (1230 AM) licensed to serve Hudson, New York, United States, which held the call sign WAIP in 2012 ","title":"WAIP"},{"id":"35305050","text":"Tres Arroyos Airport is an airport serving Tres Arroyos, a city in the Buenos Aires Province of Argentina.

The area must be an important aspect of historic or prehistoric history of the province or of the peoples and or cultures contained within the province. Sites that are adjacent to known sites and could enhance or provide greater information associated with the known heritage sites are also eligible for declaration of heritage sites by the minister. At least sixty days before the minister makes his official designation of the area as a heritage site, he must serve the lessee or the owner of the site declaring his intention to designate the site a heritage site of the province, the minister must also publish a copy of the notice of intent in no less than two news paper issues, or two different newspapers that are in circulation around the region in which the site is located. Upon receiving the notice of intent, the owner of the land can either chose to accept or reject the issue, if there is no issue of an objection by the end of the sixty-day waiting period the minister is able to declare the site officially a heritage site. If the owner chooses to object he has 30 days from the issue of the notice of intent to file a declaration of objection. Upon the issue of an objection a hearing is scheduled and conducted in front of a municipal board that then makes a recommendation to the minister who has the final decision and will either decide to not designate the area a heritage site or to follow through with his declaration of the site. If the minister is unable to make a decision the matter is referred to the Lieutenant Governor in Council. Appeals of the decision can also be made after a verdict is determined. Any heritage site or site of which intent has been declared must perform a heritage impact assessment, under which the impact of excavating and recovering heritage items is assessed, the Minister issues a permit, if it is determined that heritage items will be harmed or destroyed in a project, either the excavation of or construction on a site then the minister has the power to issue an order to cease all work, activities, or development of the project. The minister can either issue a permit to continue work, or deny the development of an area; the minister also holds the right to waiver the necessity of a heritage impact assessment. No work can be conducted on a site unless the minister has issues a permit. The minister may also issue certain stipulations with the permit, such as the maintenance/preservation of the site by the owner/lessee. If one finds a heritage item, or artifact on public land then it is determined under the Manitoba government that the custody of the object is given to the finder, although if the object is discovered don private land the object belongs to the owner of the land. No person is allowed to harm or destroy heritage items regardless of possession or not. Any person who harms or destroys an object under the Manitoba Heritage Act can be convicted by a judge and ordered to pay for the restoration of the object that was harmed. Any individual who breaks any aspect of the Act is susceptible to fines ranging from CAD$5000.00 - $50,000.00. ==Canada-Manitoba Agreement for Environmental Assessment Harmonization== In 1994 Canada and Manitoba commit to the concept and use of sustainable development in their governments, and recognize the importance of integrating environmental and economic activities. In doing so Canada and Manitoba agree to recognizes jurisdictions between the two levels of government when aspects of environmental assessment projects rulings are required. The two levels of government agree to work together in order to ensure that projects are conducted under the set requirements of both the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act as well as Manitoba‚Äôs Environment Act. Under this agreement both parties conceded to work together on such issues using aspects of 'Harmonization' in order to achieve maximum results. By undertaking this agreement, Canada and Manitoba are attempting to cultivate cooperation between Federal and Provincial governments where environmental assessment is concerned. By doing this the two parties hope to achieve an improved level of efficiency of both public and private resources. Another aspect of this agreement is the attempt to establish a system of roles of responsibilities between federal and provincial governments including accountability issues. There is a heavy emphasis on cooperative work between the two groups every move is met with approval or acknowledgement from the other party. Jurisdiction, ownership, responsibilities are all negotiated constantly between the two groups; the groups even give notice to one another about their participation in assessments. When the two groups are both conducting surveys on the same location, they meet and determine a lead party based on the situation. In the end it is the parties (provincial or federal government) who determine the ‚Äòcompletedness‚Äô of a given project. * Aboriginal Involvement: If a project is deemed to affect or involve an aboriginal group then it is made sure that the specific group or individual is notified so they may participate in any assessment acts taking place. ==Triggers== Triggers for assessments (reasons/causes for assessment) under these acts include: whenever a federal authority (any federal agency or department, including ministers and the Government of Canada) proposes a project, if a federal authority provides financial assistance that enables a project to be carried out; if the federal agency sells, leases, or transfers control in any form, of a piece of federal land in order to carry out a project; if the federal agency has to provide a license or a permit then an assessment must occur. If one or more of these requirements are met then an assessment must occur in order for the project to proceed, during the assessment the project will be placed on hold until approval or disapproval of the assessment is awarded. These are not the only instances under which an assessment may have to be conducted; an assessment may also be conducted if the minister receives a petition form an individual or group requesting that the project have an assessment conducted. If the minister feels that the project warrants an assessment after reviewing the petition than they (the minister) may order that an assessment be held before any further work on the project continues. ==Aboriginal involvement== Aboriginal groups may become involved when: they feel there are certain aspects that should be included in the assessment process, or when the project or assessment process may potentially impact any established aboriginal or treaty rights. An assessment coordinator is in charge of notifying any aboriginal groups that they feel will be affected by an assessment, whether it is an infringement on aboriginal or treaty rights or anything they feel should be brought to the group‚Äôs attention. Aboriginal groups are invited to comment on the project or the project proposal, groups are prompted to make comments involving the assessment process, funds are made available for groups who wish to consult and or comment on the process, and finally the concerns of the aboriginal groups involved are carefully considered by the agency under which the assessment and or project falls. ==Human Rights Museum controversy== The Canadian Human Rights Museum, which is under construction in Winnipeg, Manitoba, was officially established in 2008 but has been in the works since approximately 2003. The Museum is located on the Assiniboine River and Red River. In recent years there has been a large amount of controversy surrounding the location of the museum, the museum is being constructed on one of the richest sites in the province for aboriginal artifacts. This creates an issue: a human rights museum being constructed on a lot that potentially holds a piece of history for a group of indigenous peoples. A former archaeologist in the province came out and accused the museum and those behind its construction of \\"mistreating First Nations heritage.\\" The museum did fund an archaeological dig held on the area prior to construction beginning, although those who oppose the building claim it was not enough. One of the Archaeologists involved stated that \\"only two percent of the artifacts buried at the site were recovered because the museum wouldn‚Äôt foot the bill for a larger dig.\\" The protesters argue that the reason for the apparent shortcuts when it comes to preserving heritage is that the government has one of the weakest systems when it comes to the regulation of heritage items. Even the two percent of artifacts recovered were not handled properly according to some sources, while the funding for the initial dig was sufficient the museum was also supposed to help allocate the discovered artifacts to the museum of Manitoba as well but \\"as soon as they found out there were costs they cancelled that\\", thus leaving the artifacts unsorted and left sitting in some basement of a government building and not in a museum serving educational purposes. To counter this, museum officials stated that they had met with aboriginal elders to discuss this project long before construction began in the area; in order to determine whether or not there were any \\"concerns about the project.\\" The museum then proceeded to fund the archaeological dig which lasted almost half a year, costing them approximately half a million dollars, the museum also claims to have invested in further analysis of artifacts including carbon dating. Museum officials say that they have monitored the progress of the construction and are documenting any find that are made, and while there have been some discoveries in other locations the ground has proved to be void of any artifacts and any artifacts found have been 'tagged and bagged' and are being placed in storage awaiting the access of archaeologists who may be interested in them. The building itself is being constructed in a way that it is not directly settled on the ground surface and is not compressing the earth underneath the structure, in a sense rendering no harm to any artifacts that may be housed there and yet to be found. The museum is continuing to work with officials to make sure that any artifacts or heritage items found at the site are handled appropriately. The museum also pointed out that it has met all of the provinces guidelines for heritage sites. ==References== Category:Archaeology of Canada Category:Manitoba law Category:Natural history of Manitoba ","title":"Manitoba archaeological regulations"},{"id":"35305086","text":"The province of New Brunswick has created and implemented various Acts, such as the Clean Environment Act, Clean Air Act, and the Clean Water Act, throughout history to ensure that the environment is considered and protected throughout various project. These acts describe the process that will be undertaken to assess the impact of projects, and the steps to be taken when certain situations arise. New Brunswick == Environmental acts == On a general scale, environmental acts are enacted by the Minister of Environment and require anyone who is disposing a contaminant to first receive approval from the Minister. These Acts give the Minister the power to control and/or stop the disposal of contaminants, and the ability to enforce laws that require individual to clean up contaminated site. Within these acts are the regulations on how to apply and receive approval. Within each act, there are various smaller acts that are directed at specific aspects of the environment or how to deal with specific contaminants. In total, within this legislative framework there are seven statues and 19 regulations. Within the Clean Environment Act, the Clean Air Act, and the Clean Water Act, there exists an Appeal Regulation that allows an individual to appeal the Minister's decision within 15 days of the initial judgement. The appealant must submit to the Minister a document outlining the reasons for the appeal and any supporting documents within 30 days of making the appeal.  Clean Environment Act  The Clean Environment Act contains many regulations that are centred on dealing with materials and actions that can contaminate the physical environment. It includes above and below surface level.  Environmental impact assessment  New Brunswick‚Äôs Environmental Impact Assessment Regulation 87-83 was established in 1987. The Minister of the Department of the Environment and local government are responsible for overseeing it and it falls under the Clean Environment Act. Implementation of the regulation is the responsibility of the Project Assessment Branch. = Types of review = == Determination review == All proposed projects that meet the criteria listed in Schedule A (below) must undergo a determination review. The purpose of a determination review is to evaluate and determine the environmental issues and concerns associated with the proposed project. The first step of the determination review is for the proponent to submit an outline that describes the project in detail, the existing environmental problems or concerns for that area, the potential environmental issues that may arise during the project, the action plan for if problems do occur that will eliminate or reduce the environmental impact. Once the outline is submitted it is presented to the public for consultation. The next step is for it to undergo a technical review, which is done by the Project Assessment Branch of the Department of the Environment and Local Government alongside a Technical Review Committee (TRC) which is composed of experts from various federal and provincial departments. Depending on the project location, experts may also be involved from municipalities or the District Planning Committee. The last step is to submit all the documents to the Minister. The minister then issues one of three actions: # Approval ‚Äì the proposed project can continue forward # Denied ‚Äì the proposed project is denied. It can not move forward. The proponent needs to reassess the project. # Further study needed ‚Äì the proposed project must undergo further study. It will be submitted for a Comprehensive review. == Comprehensive review == A comprehensive review takes place when the Minister decides that a proposal submitted for determination review needs further study. After announcing this decision he must release Draft Guidelines to the public within 60 days for review and input. These guidelines outline what the purpose of the review is, and the specific aspects and issues that are to be considered. After the public has had a chance to give input the revised proposal and suggestions are given back to the proponent. The proponent responds to the changes and suggestions, and submits a draft of the revised project to the Minister. After pursuing the draft the Minister submits a recommendation to the Lieutenant-Governor-in- Council for approval or denial. = Schedule A (triggers) =  Petroleum product storage and handling regulations  These regulations provide guidelines on the standards that must be met when designing and constructing petroleum storage tanks. These regulations requires individuals to register and licence a storage system that has a hold capacity of two thousand litres or more. The fees for licensing is between $10 and $500 a year depending of the type of licence needed. Within this regulation is also the requirements that an individual must fulfill in order to be licensed for installing petroleum systems.  Tire Stewardship Regulations  The Tire Stewardship Regulations establish the New Brunswick Tire Stewardship Board, who run the stewardship program outlined and approved by the Minister of Environment. In total, the board and regulations are responsible for the collection and disposal of used tires.  Regional Solid Waste Commissions Regulation  These regulations outline the financial management, auditing, and reporting procedures requirements in relation to solid waste commissions. They also outline what commissions may accept and provide service in regards to solid waste management.  Water Quality Regulation  The Water Quality Regulation largely applies to industrial operations. It provides guidelines for applicants to follow before submitting their project for approval to the Minister. Once the project is submitted it undergoes an environmental review. If approval is granted, the applicant will be given conditions to follow that will control construction and operating activities and the amount of contaminants which the facility may dispose of.  Clean Air Act  The Clean Air Act is the most recently created Act and it expands off the Clean Environment Act and the Clean Water Act. It allows for increased public opinion for reviews that relate to projects and contracts involving air emissions.  Air Quality Regulation  The Air Quality Regulation operates in a similar way to the Water Quality Regulation. It outlines how to submit your plan for approval and the guidelines that will have to be followed if approval is given. It controls how much of a contaminate the facility will be allowed to release into the air.  Ozone Depleting Substance Regulation  This regulation controls and places restrictions on substances which have a damaging effect on the stratospheric ozone layer. The regulation strives to prevent the release of the damaging substances by enforcing restrictions on how to dispose of and recycle the substance as well as controlling what the substances are used for. All technicians that will be handling the substances, or performing work on machines that contain the substances must undergo an ODS certification course. Both the provincial and federal government play a part in this regulation. The provincial government has the responsibility of controlling the use of the substances, while the federal government is in control of the manufacturing, importing, and exporting of the substances. Within this regulation is a support on both the national and international level to allow the recovery of the ozone layer by eliminating the use of all harmful substances.  Administrative Penalties Regulation  The Administrative Penalties Regulation provides guidelines for what penalties may be imposed for offences that are listed within the regulation. The degree of the penalty is determined by various factors, such as the number of steps that were taken to prevent the offence and the history of the individual in regards to past offences. The penalty is usually delivered in the form of a fine ranging from $200 to $5000. An individual may only pay a penalty for offences that are similar in nature three times before other enforcement actions will be taken.  Clean Water Act   Fees for Industrial Approvals Regulation  Once a facility or project has approval under the Water Quality Regulation, this regulation will impose on them an annual fee ranging from $100 to $42,000.  Potable Water Regulation  The Potable Water Regulation ensures that any water intended for human consumption meets the quality standards established by the Department of Environment and the Department of Health and Community Services. Within this regulation are guidelines for well drillers which makes the testing of potability in newly constructed wells mandatory. It also ensures that public water is tested on a regular schedule and that the results of the test are submitted to the Minister of Health and Community Services.  Water Well Regulation  Related to the Portable Water Regulation, the Water Well Regulation provides standards that must be met when constructing new wells. It also outlines the requirements that must be met in order to obtain a permit, fees that will need to be paid, how to get a well drillers certificate. It makes it mandatory to report to the Minister the rate of yield of a well.  Protected Area Designation Order  The Protected Area Designation Order is also referred to as the Water Course Setback Designation Order. It was designed to protect the surface water by establish 'protected areas' consisting of the area 75 metres from streams, lakes, ponds, and so on that are used for public drinking. It controls how the land within those areas is used and prevents the disposal of contaminants in the area.  Protected Area Exemption Regulation  This regulation was created so as to provide criteria whereby exemptions for the Protected Area Designation Order may be issued.  Watercourse Alteration Regulation  A watercourse is defined in this regulation as anything that contains water, such as lakes, streams, rivers and ponds. The purpose of the regulation is to protect these areas from activities that will cause unnecessary harm that affects the function of the watercourse. Individuals wishing to perform an activity that could cause unnecessary harm, such as building a bridge or cutting trees with 30 metres of the watercourse, must first obtain permission in the form of a permit from the Minister. This permit will outline what may be done, how it may be done, and the time of the year that it is allowed to be done. There are limitations to this regulation, such as that it does not apply to areas where a large river meets the ocean, such as below the Reversing Falls on the Saint John River.  Environmental Trust Fund Act  The Environmental Trust Fund Act established a fund which can be used for a various things which are outlined within the Act, such as promoting sustainable development, education about the environment, and conservation. The funds are gained through the saving of part of the fees collected under the Beverage Containers Act and donations. The Act requires the Minister of Environment to designate a board to advise him/her on how the fund should be used.  Pesticide Control Act  The Pesticide Control Act was created to regulates the use and disposal of pesticides in an appropriate and approved of manner.  General regulation  There are a limited amounts of pesticides that have been approved for use in New Brunswick. In order to sell these pesticides the companies must hold a Pesticide Vendor's License, and companies that offer services in regards to the use of pesticides must have a Pesticide Operator's License. These companies offering services involved with pesticide must hold a permit issued by the Minister of Environment, and each employee must have appropriate training and certification as listed out in this regulation. If the company is offering their service for applying pesticide from an aircraft, or to water, they must hold a separate Pesticide Use Permit. A Private Pesticide Applicator's Certificate is needed for an individual who wish to apply a pesticide to their own land or employer's land.  Unsightly Premises Act  The Unsightly Premises Act establishes guidelines surrounding the up keep of property. It prohibits individuals from allowing their property to overcome by garbage and appear unsightly to the general public. It outlines how the property owner should be notified the approved methods for enforcing the Act.  Beverage Containers Act  The Beverage Containers Act contains the guidelines on how to establish and maintain the deposit/refund system for beverage containers.  General Regulation  Under the General Regulation are the requirements surrounding the size and labeling of the containers. It establishes the procedures at recycling plants, also known as Redemption Centres, about how they are to operate, fees, and how/how much of the fees are to be sent to the Environmental Trust Fund. == See also == * Environmental law * Heritage Conservation Act (New Brunswick) ==References== Category:New Brunswick provincial legislation Category:Cultural heritage of Canada Category:Environment of Canada ","title":"New Brunswick environmental legislation"},{"id":"35305105","text":"This is a list of all tornadoes that were confirmed by local offices of the National Weather Service in the United States in April 2012. ==United States yearly totalApril== April 2 event { class=\\" collapsible\\" width=\\"100%\\" !colspan=\\"7\\"List of reported tornadoes - Monday, April 2, 2012 - EF#  Location  County  Coord.

McCarthy worked for four seasons as Music Director of the Interlochen Festival Orchestra, Interlochen, Michigan, as well as conducting the University of Akron Symphony Orchestra and the Terre Haute Symphony Youth Orchestra. McCarthy is a widely performed composer with over 100 titles in the catalog of C. Alan Publications (Greensboro, North Carolina) and 30 recordings (current as of April, 2012) on the Albany, Centaur, D'note Classics, Gesparo, Klavier, Capstone, MMC, Potenzamusic, and Xolo Record labels.

McCarthy, a dedicated martial artist, achieved promoted to 3rd Degree Black Belt in Chun Ma Tae Kwon Do and Asian Weapons in May 2012. A student of Grand Master Jeon Gyeong Ho, Akron, Ohio [2], he pursued additional studies in American Kenpo, and Chin Na Kung Fu with Grand Master Sifu James Adkins in Traverse City, Michigan [3]. == Works == McCarthy‚Äôs early music (1985-1999) would be best described as ElectroAcoustic but now his music style is funk, a hybrid of rock and jazz. McCarthy works at home in his basement studio where he produces his music. Usually his electronic music with live soloists or chamber ensemble and acoustic chamber music usually featuring an instrumental soloist. He frequently wrote for soloists who played instruments previously neglected by composers such as the marimba, tuba, euphonium, viola, saxophone, and bassoon. Much of the music he wrote during this period was influenced by J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings. His musical language was eclectic, ranging from non-serial atonality to tertian and modal harmonies, frequently contrapuntal, and had a high degree of metric/rhythmic animation. This musical language reflected his previous occupation as a commercial musician in jazz, funk, and rock genres. However, he had an abiding love for the music of Gustav Mahler and Igor Stravinsky which manifested itself in dark, somber musical moods. One of McCarthy‚Äôs early work is ‚ÄúRimbasly‚Äù composed for the marimba and synthesizer, commissioned in 1989 by Michael Buritt of Eastman School of Music. His writing style began to change coinciding with his appointment as Chair of Composition and Theory at the University of Akron School of Music (2000-2014). He became increasingly interested in his relationships with performers, writing music tailored to their virtuosic abilities and musical personalities (Barrick Stees, the Cleveland Orchestra, the Avalon, Harrington, and Arianna String Quartets, U.S. Marine Corps. Tuba/Euphonium Quartet, Timothy McAllister, Northwestern University, Joseph Lulloff, Michigan State University, Michael Burritt, The Eastman School of Music, among others). His compositional style generated music that was uniquely American and unique to himself as a boy who grew up in rural northern Michigan. This resulted in music that reflected McCarthy's adolescent persona such as \\"Turn the Page\\" for electric guitar and orchestra (based on a guitar solo played by Jimmy page from the rock group Led Zeppelin), and \\"Chamber Symphony No. 4 for Saxophone and Winds\\" inspired by the music of the funk group Tower of Power. This period of creativity fostered McCarthy's general philosophy of anti-elitism in arts and culture and an aversion to academe; hence, the atypical combination of his occupation of composer and martial artist. == Early life== McCarthy‚Äôs early life during the 60s would listen to the Beatles, Beach Boys, Jackson 5 and anything else that was going on, he was also exposed to opera, his earliest memory of music was his mom singing opera music by Verdi. His mother studied at Cleveland Institute of Music, and his older brothers also are art professionals. McCarthy‚Äôs brothers introduced him to Mahler, Stravinsky and Shostakovich. McCarthy attend Interlochen High School and found jazz. He found the love of jazz through a drummer named Peter Erskine who was in a jazz band. McCarthy played the trumpet, his favorite instrument at that time. He originally wanted to be a symphony trumpet player, his teacher, John Lindenau criticized that McCarthy was very inconsistent and wouldn‚Äôt win an audition. == Notes References== *University of Akron. \\"Composer Daniel McCarthy places in The American Prize competition \\" *Gabriel, Alisha (April 2005). \\"CD Reviews: Nostalgica\\".

(1819 - 6 December 1884) born in Cork, Ireland, was a prominent surgeon and medical practitioner in the early days of the colony of South Australia. He succeeded Dr. William Gosse as Colonial Surgeon. ==History== Moore's father was a member of a well-known family in County Limerick, and was a graduate of Trinity College, Dublin. He began the study of medicine in the South Infirmary at Cork in 1835, and in 1840 he commenced working at the Charing Cross Hospital, London, where two years later he was appointed Demonstrator of Anatomy. In August, 1842, he was admitted to the Royal College of Surgeons. He also gained experience at the Westminster Ophthalmic Hospital, and in the year 1845 he took his degree as Doctor of Medicine. In 1846 he migrated to New South Wales, where he gained employment as medical assistant for the notorious entrepreneur Benjamin Boyd of Twofold Bay. While with Boyd Dr. Moore met Oswald Brierly, the artist, who accompanied the Duke of Edinburgh on his visit to South Australia in 1867. Dr. Moore came to South Australia in 1847, and took up a practice in Burra, where he was appointed medical officer to the mines, holding this position for about three years. In 1851 he married Luduvine Dutton, daughter of William Hampden Dutton, and niece of Francis Stacker Dutton, who was for some time Agent-General of South Australia. This was shortly before the gold rush to Victoria, when around 1,500 men left South Australia for the goldfields, and a report published about the time states that the \\"streets of Adelaide were deserted, houses were abandoned by their tenants, property was unmarketable, and a general arrest put on all business\\". Dr. Moore was one of those who remained and in 1858 was selected by the then Government to act as Colonial Surgeon to replace Dr. William Gosse, who had resigned, also as Superintendent of the Lunatic Asylum and President of the Medical Board and membership of the Vaccine Board. He was soon relieved of the Lunatic Asylum, for which a resident officer was appointed. In 1869 Dr. Moore resigned from the post of Colonial Surgeon, being succeeded by Dr. Paterson, and went into private practice, but continued as President of the Medical Board and official visitor with the Lunatic Asylum. He was also associated with the Orphan Home from its commencement, and served as its consulting physician. He was a Governor of St. Peters College, an Honorary Surgeon of the Female Refuge, and a member of the Linn√¶an Society. He acted as a Judge at various Horticultural and Floricultural Shows. He was highly literate and owned a library considered one of the best in the colony. He had an extensive practice and was very popular among the poor, to whom he always displayed the greatest kindness and consideration. ==Family== He married Luduvine Charlotte Jane Dutton (1833 ‚Äì 14 May 1868) on 3 December 1851; their children included: *Robert Garret Moore (22 September 1852 ‚Äì 4 December 1890), solicitor *William Frederick Moore MB., ChM. (4 Mar 1854 ‚Äì 3 Aug 1913), medical practitioner in New Zealand *Arthur Kingston Moore (9 July 1857 ‚Äì ), sheep farmer in Port Lincoln, married Sophia Charlotte Cameron on 21 December 1878 *Louisa Moore (26 Feb 1859 ‚Äì 10 May 1940) married Dr. William F. Gardner on 30 March 1880 *Henry Percival Moore (8 Nov 1860 ‚Äì 7 July 1936), manager of the Strathalbyn Branch of the Bank of Australasia, married Eleanor Formby on 30 November 1885 *Edwin Canton Moore (3 April 1862 ‚Äì 25 April 1890), solicitor *Anna Theresa Moore (2 September 1866 ‚Äì ) married Harry Dove Young (7 February 1867 ‚Äì 22 June 1944) on 25 August 1904 ==His last days== He was in failing health the last few years of his life; he consulted physicians in Melbourne and Sydney to no avail. In his last weeks he was attended by Dr. Ellison and Dr. Phillips, and an old friend Dr. Graham of Melbourne. The funeral attracted a large congregation which included the Governor, Sir W. C. F. Robinson, Chief Justice Samuel Way, Sir Henry Ayers, Sir William Milne, G. C. Hawker, E. W. Hawker, J. B. Spence, W. L. Cleland, the Mayor of Adelaide W. Bundey, J. M. Stuart and J. H. Finlayson.

In addition to being a leader in the classic cocktail movement, he is an expert on the history and culture of spirits and drinks. Brown travels the world teaching seminars on the importance of alcohol in shaping our society, and learning about regional and local variations of spirits and drinks. He owns bars Columbia Room, The Passenger, Mockingbird Hill, Eat the Rich, and Southern Efficiency in Washington, D.C. Brown serves on the Board of Directors for the Museum of the American Cocktail and is the Chief Spirits Advisor for the National Archives Foundation. ==Early life == Brown was born in Washington D.C. and grew up in Olney, Maryland. He lived briefly in Charleston, South Carolina and Atlanta, Georgia before returning to the D.C. area to attend George Mason University. Throughout high school (at Sherwood High School) he was a part of the Washington, D.C. punk scene and is still a fan of the band The Clash. ==Career== Beginnings Brown began bartending in 2000 at Adams Morgan bar Rocky's before moving on to Chef Frank Ruta's Palena and becoming interested in wine. He started working at Michel Richard's Citronelle under the tutelage of sommelier Mark Slater and then moved on to work alongside Chef Johnny Monis as the sommelier at restaurant Komi and was included in Wine & Spirits magazine's 2007 Top 5 New Sommeliers in America. While at Komi, Brown was a founder of the underground cocktail club Hummingbird to Mars that operated out of Bourbon in Adams Morgan and highlighted then-forgotten classic cocktails. As an early pioneer of the classic cocktail movement, he decided to return to the bar full-time in 2008. He worked alongside owners Ian and Eric Hilton to open speakeasy The Gibson on the 14th Street Corridor in Washington D.C. which exalted classic cocktails and an old school cocktail lounge vibe. The Passenger and Columbia Room The Passenger In 2009, restaurateur Paul Ruppert approached Brown about opening a bar in a space adjacent to the Warehouse Theatre. Brown brought his brother Tom Brown on board, a bartender at wine bar Cork at the time, and they decided on turning the space into two projects. The first was The Passenger, which opened in November 2009. Designed to be a wine bar where customers could sip a fine burgundy while listening to Fugazi, it opened with a great wine list and no cocktail list. The brothers decided that if someone wanted to order a cocktail, it would be much easier to talk through their preferences than have the guest read a list of ingredients that gave an inaccurate indication of what the cocktail would actually taste like. This approach became a hit and very soon the wine list disappeared and The Passenger became a full swing cocktail bar, without a cocktail menu (though in later years, the bar did maintain a list of daily specials). The Passenger is named after the Iggy Pop song of the same name. Next up was Brown's Columbia Room, a 10-seat cocktail haven in the back of The Passenger which opened in March 2010. Also without a cocktail menu, Columbia Room focuses on a tasting menu that combines seasonal ingredients, classic cocktails, and a razor-sharp attention to craftsmanship. The Passenger and Columbia Room have garnered awards and acclaim under Derek Brown's direction including: * 2010 Bon Appetit Top 10 New Cocktail Bars in the U.S.: Columbia Room * 2010 GQ 25 Best Cocktail Bars in America: Columbia Room * 2011 US Airways Magazine 14 Most Trend Setting Restaurants in the US: The Passenger and Columbia Room * 2011 Garden & Gun Best New Bars: Columbia Room * 2011 Travel + Leisure America‚Äôs Best Cocktail Bars: Columbia Room * 2012 Food & Wine 50 Best Bars in America: The Passenger and Columbia Room * 2012 USA Today 10 Great Classic American Cocktail Bars: The Passenger and Columbia Room * 2012 James Beard Foundation Semi-finalist for Outstanding Bar Program: Columbia Room * 2012 Washington Post Dining Guide Critic's Rating 3 Stars: Columbia Room * 2012 Tales of the Cocktail Spirited Awards Top 4 Nominee - Best American Cocktail Bar: Columbia Room * 2012 Travel & Leisure America's Best Cocktail Bars: Columbia Room * 2013 Esquire 25 Best Bars in America: Columbia Room * 2013 Washington's 18 Most Iconic Drinks: Columbia Room's Dry Martini * 2014 James Beard Foundation Semi-finalist for Outstanding Bar Program: Columbia Room * 2016 Departures Magazine Best New Cocktail Bars in America * 2017 James Beard Foundation Semi-finalist for Outstanding Bar Program: Columbia Room * 2017 Spirited Awards: Best American Cocktail Bar Closing and Re-Opening On January 1, 2015 The Passenger and Columbia Room closed.

The Columbia Room re-opened in Blagden Alley in February on 2016 under Derek Brown's direction. The Passenger re-opened north of its old location on 7th Street in the fall of 2016 under the sole ownership of Tom Brown. Drink Company Formerly knows as Laughing Cocktail, Drink Company is owned by Derek Brown and Angie Fetherston. They formed their partnership in April 2010 and have since worked together on many projects, including a trio of bars named Mockingbird Hill, Eat the Rich, and Southern Efficiency - known as the DB3 - in the Shaw neighborhood. They also led the efforts in working with the D.C. City Council to pass a proclamation naming the Rickey the official cocktail of Washington, D.C. with author of Prohibition in Washington D.C. Garrett Peck. Mockingbird Hill, Eat the Rich, and Southern Efficiency were named among Bon Appetit magazine's 2014 \\"50 Best New Restaurants in America\\". Mockingbird Hill Mockingbird Hill Mockingbird Hill, which opened on June 5, 2013, is a bar that focuses on sherry (a fortified wine from the south of Spain) and is influenced by bars in Madrid. The name of the bar comes from The Clash song Spanish Bombs which gives homage to those who fought together against the fascist regime in the Spanish Civil War. Sherry, a long-time love of Derek's, is a complement to food, especially cured ham. * 2013 Garden & Gun 10 Best New Bars: Mockingbird Hill * 2013 Zagat Hottest new bars in D.C.: Mockingbird Hill * 2013 Washington Post: 2 stars for Mockingbird Hill * Washington Post: 13 Best Local Dishes of 2013: Trout Salad at Mockingbird Hill * 2014 Tales of the Cocktail Spirited Awards Best New Bar semifinalist: Mockingbird Hill * 2014 New York Times: 6 Innovative Ice Coffees: Mockingbird Hill * 2014 Southern Living 100 Best Bars in the South: Mockingbird Hill This restaurant has been closed for years, along with Eat the Rich, and Southern Efficiency.

He scored his last victory after he had already received the wound which would soon prove fatal. The observer ace hailed from a wealthy Greek family with a connection to James Bond series author Ian Fleming. == Background == James John Scaramanga, son of John George Scaramanga and his wife Louisa Yeames Scaramanga, was born on 25 July 1898 in Reigate, Surrey. Some sources give an alternate place of birth, Redhill, Surrey. By 1901, he was living at Tiltwood House in Worth, West Sussex, with his extended family, including his paternal grandmother, Elizabeth 'Eliza' Franghiadi Scaramanga. Tiltwood House, a fifteen-bedroomed mansion on Tiltwood Estate, in Crawley Down, Worth, had been purchased and enlarged by his Greek grandfather George Emmanuel Scaramanga. By the time of his grandfather's death in 1897, Tiltwood Estate was nearly 500 acres. His grandmother died in 1933, and the estate passed on to James's uncle Ambrose Scaramanga. James's first cousin George Ambrose Scaramanga (1911‚Äì1988) is alleged to be the inspiration for the choice of name for the Scaramanga villain in Ian Fleming's The Man with the Golden Gun, published posthumously. Fleming and George Ambrose Scaramanga had been schoolmates at Eton College in the 1920s and had apparently had a falling out; Fleming later used Scaramanga's name for his villain as a way of taking revenge. == Military career == F.E.2 aircraft with No. 20 Squadron. Bristol F.2b. James Scaramanga was posted to the No. 20 Squadron of the Royal Flying Corps on 28 December 1916, as an observer, with the rank of second lieutenant effective the following day. He initially flew in F.E.2's with No. 20 Squadron. In August 1917, his squadron was equipped with Bristol Fighters. Scaramanga was credited with twelve aerial victories, all from the Bristol F.2b. Lieutenant Scaramanga scored his first aerial victory on 9 March 1918 when he, with Lieutenant Douglas Graham Cooke piloting Bristol F2.b (C4605), sent an Albatros D.V out of control south of Comines, Nord, France. He racked up another victory four days later, on 13 March 1918. From Bristol F.2b (C4615), he and pilot Lieutenant Dennis Latimer sent a Pfalz D.III out of control over Comines-Wervicq. However, on 11 April 1918, both he and his pilot Canadian Major J. A. Dennistoun were seriously wounded. They were forced to land near Neuve-√âglise, Bas-Rhin, France under machine-gun ground fire, and Bristol (B1275) was destroyed. Lieutenant Scaramanga was posted to the No. 22 Squadron of the Royal Air Force on 6 June 1918, after he had recovered. All of his remaining victories (3 through 12) were with Lieutenant John Gurdon as his pilot. Also, his next seven victories (3 through 9) were all from Bristol F.2b (C989). On 19 June 1918, Lieutenant James Scaramanga scored a triple, taking out three Fokker D.VII aircraft southeast of Armenti√®res, Nord, France. Two were destroyed, and a third sent out of control. On 27 June 1918, he sent a Fokker Dr.I out of control, again southeast of Armenti√®res, his sixth victory. Scaramanga racked up his seventh victory on 1 July 1918 when he sent a Pfalz D.III out of control over Armenti√®res. He took out his eighth plane on 4 July 1918 when a Fokker D.VII was destroyed over Noyelles, north of Seclin, Nord. The lieutenant's ninth victory involved a DFW C destroyed north of La Bass√©e, Nord. Scaramanga's last three victories (10 through 12) all took place on the same day, 10 July 1918, from Bristol F.2b (C1003). He and his pilot Gurdon took on three Pfalz D.III aircraft, all over Armenti√®res-Lille, Nord. One was destroyed and the other two sent out of control. == Death == Church of All Saints in Crawley Down Scaramanga was severely wounded in a dogfight and lost consciousness before he took down his twelfth and final enemy aircraft on 10 July 1918. He regained consciousness and with his one good arm shot down the attacking Pfalz D.III that had been on their tail. He died that same day, soon after he and his pilot, Lieutenant John Everard Gurdon, landed, about two weeks short of his twentieth birthday. Scaramanga was interred at Aire Communal Cemetery in Aire-sur-la-Lys, Pas-de-Calais, France. His grave reference number is III. H. 25. He is also commemorated on the Crawley Down War Memorial in Crawley Down, Worth, Sussex. The monument is located at the junction of Vicarage Road and Sandy Lane, down the road from the Church of All Saints. While the memorial does not list the names of the fallen, there is a roll of honour which lists those names at the church. Despite having been credited with twelve aerial victories and seriously wounded twice, the second time fatally, Lieutenant James John Scaramanga does not appear to have been decorated. His pilot, Lieutenant Gurdon, survived the encounter that killed Scaramanga. On 3 August 1918, the Supplement to the London Gazette announced that he had been awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross. In addition, after he recovered, Gurdon scored an additional five victories in August 1918, for a total count of 28, and attained the rank of captain. == Gallery of aircraft downed == Image:ZK-DVA2 IMG 3492-Edit.jpgAlbatros D.V Victory 1 Image:Pfalzdiiia.jpgPfalz D.III Victories 2, 7, 10‚Äì12 Image:Fokker D.

Stone gates of this type are rare. Similar ones can be found in Slovenia, France and in Colorado, in the United States.

Nowadays trail go around monastic land and leads beneath first Vratna Gate or Little Prerast.Prerasti Vratne at serbia.travel.com == Geology == The Prerasts of Vratna consist of late Jurassic limestones and are of different origins. While the first two are remains of a former cave tunnel through which the river Vratna ran through, and part of the arch between them collapsed, the third resulted from the plunging of the river. Further chemical erosion and mechanical forces shaped the gates into their present look. In the vicinity of the gates are three caves, examples of karst terrain. They remain largely unexplored. The largest one is long, another one has a complex of tunnels and corridors while the third has a small lake. == Exploration == First records of the gates were left by Austro-Hungarian ethnographer and traveler Felix Philipp Kanitz who traveled across the Balkans in the 1850s-1880s. He left the detailed account of the gates. Some of the earliest Serbian geographers also researched the formation, and Jovan Cvijiƒá, who explored the gates in the late 19th century. Professors from the University of Belgrade Geography Faculty, Dragan Petroviƒá and Du≈°an Gavriloviƒá, accurately measured the gates. == Protection == Vratna Gates have been protected as the natural monuments since 1957. The wildlife includes red deer and mouflon, which were introduced in 1965 in the local hunting ground. There are also various bat and bird species. Birds are building nests in the hollows of the gates themselves. There are various medicinal herbs in the area. In the mid-2000s, severe droughts destroyed almost all aquatic life in the river. == Folklore == As with the rest of eastern Serbia, the local population has numerous magical myths about the gates and the nearby caves. Some of them say that they are inhabited by the vilas, which are good-hearted and like to help people. People still come to pray or to make a wish next to the gates. == See also == * List of rock formations in Serbia * Vratna monastery == References  Further reading == * == External links == * Prerasti Vratne Category:Bor District Category:Rock formations of Serbia ","title":"Vratna Gates"},{"id":"35305239","text":"Angophora inopina, commonly known as the Charmhaven apple, is a species of small, often multi-stemmed tree that is endemic to the Central Coast of New South Wales. It has rough bark on the trunk and branches, lance-shaped adult leaves, flower buds in groups of three or seven, white or creamy white flowers and ribbed, cup-shaped fruit. ==Description== Angophora inopina is a tree, often multi-stemmed, that typically grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber. It has greyish, fibrous bark on the trunk and branches. Young plants and coppice regrowth have more or less sessile, egg-shaped to lance- shaped leaves that are long, wide and arranged in opposite pairs. Adult leaves are also arranged in opposite pairs, leathery, usually glossy green but paler on the lower side, lance-shaped or curved, long and wide on a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged on the ends of branchlets in groups of three or seven on a bristly, branched peduncle long, the individual buds on pedicels long. Mature buds are globe-shaped, long and wide with white or creamy white petals that are long and wide with a green keel. Flowering has been observed in December and the fruit is a bristly, cup-shaped capsule long and wide with longitudinal ribs and the valves enclosed in the fruit. ==Taxonomy and naming== Angophora inopina was first formally described in 1997 by Ken Hill from specimens collected near Charmhaven in the same year. The specific epithet (inopina) is from the Latin inopinatus, meaning \\"unexpected\\", referring to the occurrence of this previously undescribed species near Sydney. ==Distribution and habitat== Charmhaven apple grows sandy soil over sandstone in woodland with a dense, shrubby understorey. It has a patchy distribution from Lake Macquarie to near the Hunter River and is most common in the Wyong and Lake Macquarie local government areas. ==Conservation status== This eucalypt is listed as \\"vulnerable\\" under the Australian Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 and the New South Wales Government Threatened Species Conservation Act 1995.

He was educated at a school in Clapham, Yorkshire, under Mr. Ashe, and was admitted sub-sizar of St John's College, Cambridge on 26 June 1716. He graduated B.A. in 1719; was ordained a deacon at Lincoln in 1720 and as a priest at Ely in 1721; then became a schoolteacher at March, Cambridgeshire in 1725, and was awarded his M.A. in 1730. He went on to settle in Abbey Street, Dublin. In 1744, he published a Report of the Trial in Ejectment of Campbell Craig, from his own shorthand notes. In 1751 he was appointed deputy-keeper of the records in Bermingham Tower of Dublin Castle; in 1759 he became deputy-clerk and keeper of the rolls, and was subsequently deputy-registrar of the court of prerogative. He died at Bath, Somerset, on 22 February 1774. ==Family== He married, first, Miss Hamilton, who claimed kinship with the Abercorn family; and, secondly, Edwarda Galland. His son, William Lodge LL.D. (1742‚Äì1813), the only survivor of his nine children, became in 1790 chancellor of Armagh Cathedral, and was rector of Derrynoose and rector of Kilmore in the same diocese. Some of John Lodge's books, with marginal notes and corrections, came into the Armagh Library, which about 1867 acquired other John Lodge papers by purchase from a great-grandson. ==Works== Lodge's chief work, The Peerage of Ireland, comprises four volumes, and was published in 1754. His own interleaved copy, with numerous manuscript notes, is now in the British Library (Add MSS 23703-23708). A second edition, revised and enlarged to seven volumes by Mervyn Archdall, was published in 1789. In 1770 Lodge published anonymously The Usage of Holding Parliaments in Ireland, and in 1772, also without his name, a selection of state papers and historical tracts illustrating the political systems of the chief governors and government of Ireland during the reigns of Elizabeth, James I, and Charles I, which he called Desiderata curiosa Hibernica. His collection of record indexes were deposited in 1783 in the office of the civil department of the chief secretary to the lord- lieutenant at Dublin in return for annuities of ¬£100 a year to his widow and ¬£200 a year to his son.

Incidental take permits and HCPs are required for deforestation activities that have the potential to result in an incidental take of federally listed wildlife. A Habitat Conservation Plan (HCP) is a required part of an application for an Incidental Take Permit, a permit issued under the United States Endangered Species Act (ESA) to private entities undertaking projects that might result in the destruction of an endangered or threatened species. It is a planning document that ensures that the anticipated take of a listed species will be minimized or mitigated by conserving the habitat upon which the species depend, thereby contributing to the recovery of the species as a whole. ==Background== The importance of preserving rare species was legally recognized in 1973 when the Endangered Species Act (ESA) was signed into federal law. The purpose of the ESA is not only to protect species that have been listed as threatened or endangered, but also to conserve the ecosystems upon which those species depend. In aiming to protect species in danger of becoming extinct, the ESA prohibits actions that have the potential to result in a \\"taking\\" of any listed species. The term \\"take\\" under the ESA refers to any attempt or action involving the harassment, harm, pursuit, hunting, shooting, wounding, killing, trapping, capturing, or collecting of any listed species. Under this definition, the alteration of habitat that results in injury to, or death of, any listed species by preventing essential behavior (such as breeding, feeding or sheltering) is considered unlawful \\"harm\\". The United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) and the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) are the lead agencies tasked with the implementation of the ESA and are therefore responsible for regulating prohibited and allowable activities. While the primary objective of the ESA is the protection of endangered species, and the take of such species is considered unlawful, the ESA is not absolute. In 1982, amendments were made to the 1973 ESA which authorize the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Commerce to allow the take of federally listed species (Endangered Species Act, Section 10a(1)(B)). When non-federal activities that would otherwise be legal have the potential to result in the take of a listed species for example, they may be allowed under an Incidental Take Permit, obtained through the USFWS. To mitigate the take of listed species, Section 10 of the ESA requires that parties wishing to obtain an Incidental Take Permit must submit a conservation plan, hereafter referred to as a \\"Habitat Conservation Plan\\" or \\"HCP,\\" with their application. ==Phases of Developing a HCP== I. Pre-application process Determine permit applicant(s)/HCP preparer(s) In determining the party to prepare a HCP and application for an Incidental Take Permit, two primary factors must be considered; first, the party must be capable of overseeing the implementation of the HCP once approved and second, the party must be capable of funding the implementation of the HCP. Beyond these requirements, parties can vary based on the scope of the proposed action. For example, a single landowner may be the sole preparer of a HCP if they intend to obtain an Incidental Take Permit for an action on their own property and they are the only interested party. For large-scale projects such as those covering a region of land rather than a single property, or those with multiple interested parties rather than a single landowner, the permittee may be a group such as a local or governmental agency. Determine the members of the steering committee (optional) For large-scale projects, applicants have the option of forming a steering committee composed of persons, such as stakeholders, with an interest in the HCP planning area or affected species. The purpose of a steering committee is to provide the applicant with direction, guidance, advice, and assistance in developing the HCP. Although the development and participation of a steering committee is not a requirement in preparing a HCP, it can be found valuable in facilitating the HCP process when multiple groups with differing interests and opinions regarding the project are involved. Consultation with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and National Marine Fisheries Service After the applicant and steering committee members have been determined, consultation with USFWS and NMFS is recommended to ensure that responsible parties have a thorough understanding of requirements and resources available for the development phase of the HCP. II. Development process Generate a species list Once the applicant has decided to initiate the development of a HCP, they must identify the species of concern that the HCP will be developed for. All federally listed animal species that have the potential to be impacted by the proposed action/project must be included in this list. Additional unlisted species may also be considered in the HCP. Including these additional species may be beneficial in some cases, if the proposed action has the potential to impact species that are not federally listed at the time the HCP is being developed but are anticipated to be listed within the active duration of the permit; in which case, the HCP would need to be revised to include the newly listed species and may further delay the proposed action.Incidental take permits and HCPs are not required for the incidental take of listed plant species; however, applicants are encouraged to incorporate federally listed plants in the HCP or planning process. Habitat- based approach An alternative method to developing a HCP for target species of concern is to develop a HCP for a particular habitat type. Under this approach, a specific habitat type found within the HCP area is selected as the focus of the HCP by the permittee and USFWS/NMFS based on the species known to use the habitat. The habitat-based HCP must consider all sensitive species known to use the particular habitat type and all of their habitat-related needs. All species considered within the habitat-based HCP may be included under the Incidental Take Permit. The benefit of developing a habitat-based HCP rather than a species-based HCP is that, if prepared properly, a single HCP would theoretically benefit multiple species or an entire ecosystem rather than only protecting the species listed under the ESA. Define geographic boundaries Once the target species or habitat type to be considered in the HCP have been identified, the geographic boundaries of the planning area need to be established. It is important to be precise when defining the land area to which the HCP will apply, with regards to impacts associated with the proposed action, to circumvent potential problems in later phases of the development process. The geographic boundaries of the HCP should encompass all areas that will be directly impacted by the proposed action and any areas where an incidental take has the potential to occur as a result of the proposed action.For projects covering a large amount of land, the project area may be divided into separate entities with their own set of requirements, rather than applying a single plan's criteria to a diverse region. Gather biological data After delineating the boundaries of the HCP area and the species within that area to be included in the HCP, current biological information for each of those species must be obtained. Data pertaining to the species' ecology, geographical distribution, and occurrence is required and may be available from existing sources. Guidance for locating this information is provided by USFWS and NMFS. If existing information is not available or sufficient for the requirements of the HCP, biological studies must be completed to supplement this requirement. If a biological study is determined necessary, USFWS and NMFS can suggest appropriate methods based on the species of concern. Discuss proposed activities After sufficient biological information has been collected for each of the species included in the HCP, the applicant must provide a discussion of all proposed activities that have a potential to result in an incidental take of said species. This portion of the HCP is where the applicant provides a detailed comprehensive description of the proposed action/project, which can vary in depth based on the scale of the project and HCP area. For the purpose of long-term planning, applicants are encouraged to include any actions that they have control over that are reasonably foreseeable to occur during the active permit period. Low-Effect HCP Due to the varying degrees by which a species may be impacted from a project, the Low-Effect HCP category is established to distinguish projects that are expected to have \\"minor or negligible effects on federally listed, proposed, or candidate species and their habitats or environmental values or resources\\". Low-Effect HCPs have a simplified and shortened application/approval process compared to a regular HCP. USFWS and NMFS will review the HCP and determine if it may be considered within the low-effect category or not. Determine significance of anticipated incidental take In requesting a permit that will authorize the incidental take of a listed species, the applicant must determine the extent of the potential take. To do this, the methods for calculating incidental take must be established. First, the number of individuals of each species, or number of acres of specific habitat, of concern that occur within the geographic boundaries of the HCP area must be determined. Subsequently, incidental take may be calculated based on the number of animals expected to be \\"killed, harmed, or harassed\\" as a result of the proposed action/project. If the applicant is incapable of determining the number of individuals/acres that occur in the area or the number that are expected to be impacted, incidental take may be calculated based on the acres of habitat anticipated to be affected by the proposed project. Once the number of individual species or acres of habitat are confirmed, the probability that proposed activities will result in the take of a species must be evaluated. Develop a mitigation program After an allowable level of take is determined, the applicant may begin to prepare the mitigation program. Because projects requiring an Incidental Take Permit are so diverse, applicable mitigation measures should be equally diverse; therefore, limits and rules are not established for this process. Common mitigation measures often include the following: # Avoid the impact # Minimize the impact # Rectify the impact # Reduce/eliminate the impact over time # Compensate for the impact The general goals of a mitigation program are to offset the immediate incidental take by either positively contributing to the species as a whole or to the objectives of the recovery plan designed for that species by USFWS. Mitigating for habitat loss Most projects requiring an Incidental Take Permit involve impacts to, or losses of, habitat. Mitigating for habitat loss requires either the replacement or protection of habitat within the HCP area or at another location. This may be accomplished through a variety of methods including: # Acquiring existing habitat; # Employing conservation easements to protect existing habitat; # Improving or restoring degraded habitat; # Management of habitats to achieve specific conditions; or # Creating new habitat. Examples of habitat mitigation programs * Habitat Banking- used to mitigate for habitat loss by designating and protecting land through conservation easements within the HCP area during the design phase of the project. * Mitigation Credit System- uses protected (banked) lands as credits available for purchase. This system enables parties capable of protecting large areas to receive monetary gain from other parties requiring habitat mitigation. Likewise, this system is beneficial for parties not capable of protecting sufficient habitat within their HCP area by enabling them to quickly purchase credits that satisfy their mitigation requirements. * Mitigation Fund- involves making monetary contributions of an established amount to an account that is used as a habitat acquisition fund. In general, it is recommended that habitat mitigation be located reasonably close to the location of habitat impacted by the proposed action/project, provide similar habitat types, and support the same species expected to be impacted by the proposed action/project; however, these attributes vary from project to project. It is typically expected that the extent of mitigation should mirror the proposed impact. For example, if a project will result in permanent destruction of habitat, mitigation measures will likely require either the creation of new habitat or the protection of habitat, and mitigated habitat should be permanently protected. Similarly, mitigation for Low-Effect HCPs and small projects may involve a payment to a fund or purchasing mitigation credits. Develop a monitoring program To ensure the effectiveness of the HCP, it is essential for monitoring to be implemented throughout the development of the action/project and following its completion. HCP monitoring programs are recommended to incorporate the following features:Monitoring programs should be designed in a way that will adequately identify trends in species populations in an economically efficient manner. The permittee may identify and assign an outside party for implementing the monitoring program, but the permittee is ultimately responsible for its funding, adequacy, and completion. # Establish specific objectives for monitoring; # Clarify the focus of the monitoring program (specific species, specific habitat types, etc.); # Specify the characteristics to be monitored and methods to be employed for data collection; # Establish a monitoring schedule that determines the frequency and duration by which monitoring will take place; and # Discuss the process by which data will be analyzed (who will perform the analysis, how will data be evaluated etc.) Identify/provide funding Every HCP is required to identify the funding that will be provided for its implementation. Sufficient funding must be provided for all proposed activities, including those relating to any necessary surveys, monitoring programs, mitigation programs, and construction of the proposed project. Funding amounts and contributors will vary based on the scale of the proposed project. Projects impacting large areas of land, for example, typically require funding from multiple sources. The HCP must identify all financial contributors and planned allocation of funds. Analyze alternatives Permittees are required to include a discussion of other options, besides the proposed action/project, that would not result in the proposed taking. It is common for this discussion to include two alternatives; one being a \\"no action\\" alternative under which a permit would not be issued and the proposed project would not be developed, the other being a specific project alternative that would result in a reduced impact/take than the proposed project. All alternatives considered during the permit application and HCP development process must be included. Following the discussion of possible alternatives, the permittee must explain why each of the alternatives was deemed unsuitable and not chosen as the proposed project.The number of alternatives required of an HCP may vary based on the scale of the proposed project. Consider unforeseen circumstances In the development phase of the HCP process, applicants are encouraged to consider elements that have the potential to change over time. Given the unpredictable nature of the future, it would be impossible to prepare for every situation that has the potential to arise. For this reason, an assurance policy is incorporated in the HCP process. No Surprises Policy The No Surprises Policy is designed to protect Incidental Take Permit-holders from having to make future revisions to their approved plan due to unforeseen circumstances. This means that once a permittee has prepared a HCP deemed adequate by USFWS/NMFS, has been issued an Incidental Take Permit, and is successfully implementing the approved HCP, USFWS and NMFS will not require revisions be made to the accepted plan (such as additional mitigation) if unexpected circumstances arise. III. Approval/Implementation Process Review of HCP required content Habitat conservation plans may vary to some degree in content; however, there are certain elements that are universally required. Inclusion of the following is required of every HCP: # Analysis of impacts that have the potential to occur as a result of the proposed taking of a threatened or endangered species; # Steps to be taken by the permit-holder to \\"‚Ä¶monitor, minimize, and mitigate for such impacts;\\" # Sufficient funding for implementing these steps; # A plan of action for handling any unanticipated circumstances; # A discussion of potential alternative actions taken into consideration by the permittee that would not result in the take of a listed species, and basis for not choosing these alternatives Interpret significance of anticipated incidental take Once the degree of incidental take is calculated based on the factors discussed above, it is up to UFSWS and NMFS to determine if the proposed incidental take should be authorized. When evaluating the estimated level of take, the following criteria (outlined in ESA section 10(a)(2)(B)) are employed to determine if the incidental take is acceptable: # The proposed \\"take\\" of a species would be incidental (it would be the result of, rather than the purpose for, an otherwise legal action). # The party applying for the Incidental Take Permit would develop a mitigation program capable of minimizing and mitigating the impacts of the proposed take to the maximum extent practicable. # The party applying for the Incidental Take Permit would ensure that sufficient funding for the HCP will be provided. # The proposed take would not substantially diminish the ability of the species to recover and survive in the wild. The HCP must be consistent with these criteria before being approved for an Incidental Take Permit. If the estimated level of take is determined to exceed allowable amounts by USFWS and NMFS, the HCP must be revised to further reduce the potential for take. This is often most easily achieved by increasing the amount of land that will remain undisturbed. Implementing agreement Implementing Agreements are made between the permittee and USFWS/NMFS to assure that the permittee will follow through on their obligation to implement the mitigation program identified by the HCP. They are individually tailored for HCPs and include all applicable permit conditions and requirements of the parties involved. They are signed by all parties, thereby establishing the intent of adhering to the terms identified by the HCP. Implementing Agreements are not required of every HCP; they are most often utilized for large-scale projects involving multiple parties and are rarely used for Low-Effect HCPs. ==Progress and momentum of the Habitat Conservation Plan== Since its inclusion in the ESA in 1982, the process of habitat conservation planning has been steadily gaining momentum. Between 1982 and 1992, the USFWS had approved a total of 14 HCPs and had issued 14 incidental take permits. As of December 2005, over 430 HCPs had been officially approved, varying in size and scope, with many more in the development phase. ==Additional conservation agreements== Congress addressed taking restrictions in the 1990s by creating additional agreements to assist in species recovery. Instituted by USFWS and NMFS, safe harbor agreements and candidate conservation agreements are incentive-driven and voluntary. Because of their greater flexibility for property owners, these agreements are likely to become more popular. Safe Harbor Agreement (SHA) Similar to HCPs, Safe Harbor Agreements (SHAs) are voluntary agreements between non-federal landowners and USFWS or NMFS. SHAs encourage landowners to create, enhance, or maintain habitat for threatened or endangered species on their property. Prior to the agreement, landowners and agencies establish baseline conditions for the habitat to be capable of supporting the species. The agency provides assurances to the landowners and guarantees that, if the conditions of the SHA are met, the landowners will not be subject to any additional requirements than previously agreed upon. Incidental take by the landowner is authorized as long as the species does not fall below the agreed-upon baseline conditions. Landowners are not bound indefinitely to SHAs and can either renew or let the agreements expire. This allows landowners to freely manage their property, including development, as long as they maintain baseline conditions. As of 2009, USFWS had entered into over 70 SHAs.Salzman, J., Thompson, B. 2010. Environmental Law and Policy. Thomson Reuters, New York Candidate Conservation Agreement (CCA) Similar to SHAs, Candidate Conservation Agreements (CCAs) are voluntary agreements between private or public parties (including landowners, state, local, and federal agencies) and USFWS or NMFS. CCAs aim to protect candidate species that are in decline and vulnerable to becoming endangered if measures are not taken to protect their habitat. CCAs encourage landowners to create, enhance, or maintain habitat for these species on their property. CCAs do not provide assurances for landowners or authorize incidental take. Candidate Conservation Agreement with Assurances (CCAA) Candidate Conservation Agreements with Assurances (CCAAs) are voluntary agreements between non-federal landowners and USFWS or NMFS. CCAAs provide assurances and authorize a specific allotment of incidental take by the landowner. ==Flexible scope of Habitat Conservation Plans== Example: Small- scale HCP HCPs are designed to be flexible to accommodate a range of projects that vary greatly in size and scope, from single-property developments to hundreds of thousands of acres involving multiple parties. An HCP created for construction of a single-family home on a 0.44-acre lot in Scotts Valley, California proposed mitigation and minimization measures aimed at the endangered Mount Hermon June beetle (Polyphylla barbata) and Ben Lomond spineflower (Chorizanthe pungens var. hartwegiana). Measures for the 5,856 ft2 project included no development on the land where the spineflower is located and elimination of non-native plants growth on the land to prevent competition. Measures to protect the beetle took into account breeding and flight activities and proposed landscaping to promote the beetle's habitat. Example: Large-scale HCP Threatened marbled murrelet (Brachyramphus marmoratus) Threatened northern spotted owl (Strix occidentalis caurina). A project, such as planned logging, that might lead to habitat destruction of the northern spotted owl would require submitting a Habitat Conservation Plan as part of its Incidental Take Permit. Alternatively, the large-scale HCP created for 211,700 acres of the Headwaters Forest in Northern California near Eureka dealt with the largest old-growth redwood ecosystem in the United States. The threatened northern spotted owl (Strix occidentalis caurina) and marbled murrelet (Brachyramphus marmoratus) rely on the large redwoods for nesting as well as the threatened coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch), who are dependent on the habitat's stream for spawning. Pacific Lumber Company, Scotia Pacific Holding Company, and Salmon Creek Company (collectively known as PALCO) created an HCP in 1998 that addressed road building and timber harvest as the greatest threats to the species. The resulting extensive mitigation and monitoring measures provided strict restrictions for land use, including buffers and operational limitations in riparian areas with active murrelet nests. The HCP also maintained that northern spotted owl nesting, roosting, and foraging habitat be provided and maintained. ==Strengths and weaknesses of HCPs== The environmental community and landowners take different stands on HCPs. Strengths: * Flexible to accommodate a wide range of projects that vary greatly in size and scope. * Forces consideration of species by all parties. * Reduced uncertainty for landowners. Weaknesses: * Inflexible with regards to changing knowledge relating to species and habitat. * The \\"No Surprises Policy\\" has been highly controversial with critics arguing that it burdens the agencies, rather than landowners, with additional financial and mitigation responsibilities if unforeseen circumstances arise. * HCPs are viewed as having weak and insufficient monitoring plans. Additionally, the parties responsible for monitoring HCPs are not regulated in a systematic manner due to private funding. * Criticism over scientific standards and limited credible scientific data. * Agencies have interpreted the role of HCPs under section 10(a) of the ESA as a means to contribute to survival of species but not as a recovery tool. The Habitat Conservation Planning Handbook is inconsistent with this stand and states that \\"‚Ä¶contribution to recovery is often an integral product of an HCP‚Ä¶\\" and in general, conservation plans that are not consistent with recovery plan objectives should be discouraged\\". ==The role of HCPs in court (previous cases/standing)== Endangered mission blue butterfly (Icaricia icarioides missionensis), protected by the San Bruno Mountain HCP. Endangered Alabama beach mouse (Peromyscus polionotus ammobates) at issue in Sierra Club v. Babbitt, in which it was threatened by beachfront condominium development. The number of approved HCPs has grown since the first HCP was created in 1983 for San Bruno Mountain in San Mateo County, California. Congress wanted the San Bruno Mountain HCP to serve as a model for future HCPs in that it was created from \\"an independent exhaustive biological study\\" and that it considered the habitat of the mission blue butterfly (Aricia icarioides missionensis) \\"to allow for enhancement of the survival of the species\\". This model has drawn concern because it focuses more on species survival, while the intent of HCPs is to aid species recovery; and has resulted in HCPs being frequently challenged in court. In Sierra Club v. Babbitt, 15 F. Supp. 2D 1274 (S.D.Ala.1998), the Plaintiff challenged the USFWS issuance of Incidental Take Permits to the developers of two beachfront condominium projects based on the HCPs submitted as part of the application process. The Plaintiffs argued that the HCPs created for the endangered Alabama beach mouse (Peromyscus polionotus ammobates) did not fulfill the requirements of ESA section 10(a)(2)(B) requiring the development of \\"a mitigation program that will minimize and mitigate the impacts of the proposed taking to the maximum extent practicable\\". Additionally, the Plaintiff argued that there was insufficient biological data for the Alabama beach mouse species in the HCP, including population abundance, to determine allowable levels of take. The Court found for the Plaintiffs and remanded the decision to issue the Incidental Take Permits to USFWS. ==NotesReferences== Category:Endangered species Category:Environmental law in the United States Category:Habitat ","title":"Habitat Conservation Plan"},{"id":"35305336","text":"The 2012‚Äì13 season was Livingston's second consecutive season in the First Division, having been promoted after winning the Scottish Second Division during season 2010‚Äì11.

The concert was held in honor of the German-born video-game composer Chris H√ºlsbeck, and featured orchestral arrangements exclusively based on H√ºlsbeck's works throughout his 22-year-long career. The concert was produced and directed by Thomas B√∂cker, with the majority of arrangements provided by Finnish composer and musician Jonne Valtonen, and with contributions by Japanese video-game composers Yuzo Koshiro, Takenobu Mitsuyoshi, and additional assistance from Adam Klemens. The concert was performed by The WDR Radio Orchestra Cologne and the FILMharmonic Choir under conduction from Arnie Roth, with guest performers Rony Barrak and Jari Salmela joining the orchestra at numerous occasions throughout the night. Symphonic Shades became the very first video game orchestra concert in history to be broadcast live on radio. Symphonic Shades marked the beginning of a series of concerts held in principally at the Cologne Philharmonic Hall, and would spawn 3 direct successor concerts, as well as branch out into numerous side shows. ==Concerts== Production In late 2007, Thomas B√∂cker announced that he is producing Symphonic Shades, a concert exclusively dedicated to the music of Chris H√ºlsbeck, taking place on 23 August 2008. The WDR Radio Orchestra Cologne was chosen to perform due to Winfried Fechner, manager of the WDR Radio Orchestra Cologne, wanting to gauge the interest of a new young audience in classical music through the use of video game music after having personally attended Fifth Symphonic Game Music Concert. Symphonic Shades would differ from the previous concert series produced by B√∂cker, the Symphonic Game Music Concerts. While Symphonic Game Music Concerts was a continuation of the conventional orchestra game music concerts originated by Koichi Sugiyama in 1991 with the Orchestral Game Concerts series, Symphonic Shades focused on one specific composer in its entirety, which was a very uncommon concept for video game orchestra concerts at the time, and the first of its kind in Europe. The use of specific themes would be utilized in all subsequent Symphonic shows produced by B√∂cker and his Merregnon Studios. B√∂cker stated the reason to focus on H√ºlsbeck was due to his own childhood memories of the composer's music, his value to the German fans and for being a true \\"melody maker\\" in the same vein as Nobuo Uematsu. The name of the concert was inspired by H√ºlsbeck's first noted composition, \\"Shades\\", which launched his video game career after being featured in the German magazine 64'er in 1986. A website was set up for the concert, providing news updates, interviews and other announcements leading up to the day of the show. Having worked together since 2000, B√∂cker positioned Jonne Valtonen to be lead arranger for the show, orchestrating all the pieces to be featured throughout the concert. On April 21 of 2008, It was announced on the official website that legendary SEGA composer Yuzo Koshiro would be present at the concert and provide an arrangement of Jim Power in Mutant Planet. On May 28, Takenobu Mitsuyoshi was announced to be attendance and provide his arrangement for Apidya. Both Koshiro and Mitsuyoshi had worked with B√∂cker in the past, with Koshiro providing a track alongside Valtonen on the Merregnon project in 2004, while Mitsuyoshi recorded the music for WCCF with the assistance of B√∂cker and Valtonen in Prague during 2007.MUSA website list, Game credits WCCF (accessed 2008-06-25) Though some of H√ºlsbeck's music had been featured in the Symphonic Game Music Concerts and Valtonen having provided an arrangement of Turrican as a part of a medley featuring Amiga video game music for PLAY! previously, Symphonic Shades featured all new exclusive arrangements using a more experimental approach, while also referring to H√ºlsbeck's own personal interpretations more extensively. Tickets for Symphonic Shades were sold out after six days, prompting the producers to schedule a second concert that would be performed to another sold-out audience at 23:00 on the same day of the Symphonic Shades world premiere. The artwork for the concert was provided by Hitoshi Ariga, most noted for his work on the Rockman manga series and The Big O. Shows The WDR Radio Orchestra Cologne and the FILMharmonic Choir performing Symphonic Shades The two concerts were held back to back on August 23, 2008. The first performance took place at 20:00 and the second at 23:00 local time at the Funkhaus Wallrafplatz in downtown Cologne. Both concerts were preceded by a Meet and Greet session with the guest of honor Chris H√ºlsbeck, Yuzo Koshiro and Takenobu Mitsuyoshi. The concert featured 14 titles selected from Chris H√ºlsbeck's library of titles throughout his career, including his most famous works The Great Giana Sisters, Turrican II: The Final Fight, as well as lesser known works from the short movie soundtrack Licht am Ende des Tunnels and the original concert composition Karawane der Elefanten. Arrangements ranged from many different styles, having influences of jazz, big band, cinema, concertos and experimental electronic soundscapes combined with the orchestra. The Finnish pianist Jari Salmela took the stage twice, first during a solo piano performance for Turrican 3 - Payment Day, and a second time accompanied by the orchestra for the finale, Turrican II. Rony Barrak provided Darbuka percussion for the Tunnel B1 suite. Most of the arrangements featured a grand bombastic sound due to H√ºlsbeck's strong influence from classic science fiction films and fiction. Mitsuyoshi wrote lyrics in Japanese for the choir accompanied with strong brass sections in his Apidya arrangement, wanting to make his arrangement very emotionally effective. Koshiro arranged his given material in an impressionist classical style similar to 19th century Johannes Brahms and Anton Bruckner, reminiscent of his previous work in Actraiser. Several unique elements were used to create a rich sound, some by using an emulated C64 backing track recorded by H√ºlsbeck himself for Symphonic Shades piece, while Gem'X made use of ceramic cups. H√ºlsbeck noted that the original composition Karawane der Elefanten came to be while he experimented with oriental gamut and Egyptian melodies, and began to imagine elephants walking through the desert. During certain intervals, German moderator Matthias Opdenh√∂vel would inform the audience on the background and origin for the upcoming pieces to be performed, as well as provide commentary on H√ºlsbeck's illustrious career. Like Symphonic Game Music Concerts before it, Symphonic Shades made minimal use of stage show elements, opting not to make use of video screens or other forms of imagery. A small amount of light production was used to create atmosphere in the concert hall. Each concert ran at approx 80 minutes. The event marked the first live radio broadcast of a video game music concert, broadcast on the WDR4 station. Despite being a German production based on a German composer, the concert had attendees from Japan, Finland, Sweden and Norway.

The concert was followed by a several minute standing ovation. Johan K√∂hn of LEVEL Magazine in Sweden stated that the concert was \\"magnificent\\", Denis Brown of ONLINEWELTEN.com called the concert a \\"great gift not only to Chris H√ºlsbeck, but also to his fans\\", Andreas Altenheimer of demonews.de stated \\"I have rarely heard such well functioning transitions within medleys, as in Symphonic Shades.\\", Robert Dietrich of Stereology recalled that \\"thunderous applause and standing ovation\\" from the audience went on for so long that Arnie Roth had to stop the cheering crowd due to another concert being scheduled 30 minutes later., and Andreas Hackl stated at Square Enix Music Online that despite not being familiar with the material prior to the concert, the show was \\"definitely worth it\\". During an interview with freelance writer Audun Sorlie, Sorlie stated that even though he had stepped off the plane only few hours before the concert and made it in the door 2 minutes prior to the event, it was one of the most \\"personal and important experiences\\" in his life to pay tribute to one of his childhood heroes. Winfried Fechner was overwhelmed by the success of Symphonic Shades, and immediately green-lit another production to be done in cooperation with Merregnon Studios for 2009. The 2009 concert would later be revealed to be Symphonic Fantasies and focus on the biggest titles from game developer Square Enix. Chris H√ºlsbeck himself stated the concert was a personal highlight for him, and the \\"defining moment\\" of his life. A visibly emotional and touched H√ºlsbeck could be seen at the concert itself, and after returning to his home in San Francisco, he wrote an open letter thanking the fans as well as the WDR and Merregnon Studios for all the support, noting the concert exceeded all his expectations and that he would be eternally grateful for the tribute. Sinfonia Drammatica On 4 August 2009, eight pieces of Symphonic Shades were performed by the Royal Stockholm Philharmonic Orchestra at the concert Sinfonia Drammatica in the Stockholm Concert Hall, along with titles of drammatica by Yoko Shimomura, uniquely combining works of a single Japanese and Western game music composer in one concert. For this occasion, Jonne Valtonen slightly revised his version of the Turrican II main theme. In a review Original Sound Version stated: \\"No lasers, no smoke machines, no backing track and no display screen with footage of the games. This was what I was hoping for: a serious concert that even people without game knowledge could appreciate. [...] Sinfonia Drammatica was awesome.\\" Additionally, the Duisburg Philharmonic performed nine arrangements from Symphonic Shades at their 3. Familienkonzert on 3 December 2009. Both H√ºlsbeck and Shimomura expressed hope that Sinfonia Drammatica could open the door for them and other composers from across borders to work together on music in the future. ==CD== On December 17, 2008, a concert recording was released by Chris H√ºlsbeck's own label synSONIQ Records. It contains live material from the concert that is complemented by recordings before and after the public performances. The first print of the CD was a collector's edition limited to 1000 copies and was sold out at the main retailer less than a month after the initial release. In order to ensure continuous availability of the recording, digital releases on iTunes and Amazon followed the CD, of which a second print was released on 20 May 2009. Unlike the limited collector's edition, the second print is lower in price and is shipped in standard CD trays, but still contains the booklet included with the first 1000 copies of the album, though with normal printing rather than a matte/gloss coating effect on the cover. The CD is as of 2011 entirely out of print, though the album is still available digitally on Amazon and iTunes. ==References *Symphonic Shades *MAZ Sound Tools *Chris H√ºlsbeck Productions *Personal website of Thomas B√∂cker Category:Video game concert tours Category:2008 concert tours ","title":"Symphonic Shades ‚Äì H√ºlsbeck in Concert"},{"id":"35305405","text":"The Sheriff of Tarbert was the sheriff principal of Tarbertshire.

It was opened 13 May 1945 in the garrison of Koria, which was the part of Elim√§ki municipality, now Kouvola town. The Engineers Museum has the status of the scientific military museum and it is supervised by the Military Museum of Finland (in Finnish: Sotamuseo). The Engineers Museum was re-opened in Miehikk√§l√§ in 2007. The Engineers Museum will stay in Miehikk√§l√§ still in 2012. In 2013 it will be opened in H√§meenlinna near The Artillery Museum of Finland. Two other attractions related to the Engineer corps of Finland will stay at their present places: Salpa Line museum and the Bunker museum. ==History== Lieutenant's idea The history of the Engineer Museum starts in 1929, when a second lieutenant Eero-Eetu Saarinen made a proposal to the commander of the engineer battalion, concerning an engineer corps museum. The engineer troops started to collect materials for the museum. Most of the collectibles achieved by Saarinen got lost during the Winter War. Opening after the wars On 12 May 1945 lieutenant colonel Eero-Eetu Saarinen delivered an opening speech of the museum. The museum worked in the barracks until 1965, when the municipality of Elim√§ki donated a log house the museum, so that the museum could become enlarged. Organised Engineers Corps Union Already in the beginning of the 1970s it became obvious that a new building would be needed. In the Koria garrison area, which was the main base of the Engineers corps, the new build main building was built opened by the lieutenant colonel Eero-Eetu Saarinen 25 July 1974 in Kivim√§ki of Koria. The next year, in 1975, the Pioneeriaselajin Liitto ry, was established to govern the Engineers Museum. Englargening The other outer building was built and opened in 1976. The construction site manager and inspector was military technician Arvo Tolmunen.Aimo Hattula, the Hakku (Pickaxe) magazine, number 3, 2007, page 7 The corps museum was granted an officials status as an official war historical museum by the minister of defence, Veikko Pihlajam√§ki, 24 March 1987. Diaspora and fire As the Kymi Engineer Battalion was moved from Koria to Vekaranj√§rvi garrison of the Karelia Brigade, the activities of the museum halted in Koria. The exhibits were packed and were delivered to separate locations. Most of the exhibits ended up to Kouvola and were burned also a kind of vandalism destroyed the materials. New start Kouvola municipality had planned to support the museum, but the idea did not survive, so that the registered Union of the Engineers Corps. Until the beginning of the 2000s a new plan was made in cooperation with Miehikk√§l√§ municipality. In 2003 a project for opening the museum was started with the financial help of the European union structural funds. The general headquarters did not take the museum to the category of the further developed museums on 4 March 2004, but it was added to the list 18 May 2005. ==Exhibitions== The museum will be open in June, July and August, from 10 o'clock to 18 o'clock. The museum has a relatively small number of visitors due to the distant location. In the same region there are two other museums related to the military engineering: Salpa- museo (The Salpa defence line museum) and Bunkkerimuseo (The bunker museum). Main building In the main exhibition there are about 500 exhibits. Specialities in the main building are models of the Kiviniemi, Vuoksi ja Syv√§rinniska field bridges. On the other half of the main building there is the Pit√§j√§museo, a local rural museum presenting the past agrarian life from the point of view of the household woodware.rf Kiviniemi bridge There has been at least six bridges over the Vuoksi river in Sakkola. The first known bridge was a wooden bridge in the 1800s, which was replaced by a stone bridge in 1827. The Vuoksi river was enlargened and the flow eroded the soil structures of the stone bridge, so that it had to be break down. Nordestam senate in 1870 authorised rebuilding, which was started in 1878, but the works ended during the first phases of the construction works. According to the next plan the new bridge was to be built, in the new place, onto the narrowest part of the Kiviniemi falls area, 300 metres further from the place, where the bridge had been two times. The new length of the bridge would be 74.8 metres. The construction works started in winter 1876 and the bridge was opened for the traffic in 1878. The budget of the construction works reached 139,000 Finnish marks. During the Winter War the Finns explored the bridge. The Soviets built another bridge from steel after the Moscow Peace Treaty of 1940 in the inter-war period. Before the advancing Finnish troops reached the bridge, the Soviet troops explored the bridge in the beginning of the Continuation War in 1941. The Finns built a railway bridge from steel, which was destroyed in 1944. Now there is a Soviet made bridge made of steel crossing Vuoksi. An anti-tank armoured assault vehicle Sturmgesch√ºtz III Ausf. G Front- and backyard There is a Sturmgesch√ºtz III Ausf. G on the frontyard of the museum, On the backyard there are several aluminic assault boats, KrAZ lorry with and without a pontoon bridge equipment. The heaviest vehicle is a T-72 main battle tank with a mine plough. ==Collections== There are about 3 700 collectibles in the museum. ==Salpa Centre== The Salpa Centre (Salpakeskus), which was established 7 July 2005, is a voluntary consortium of four participating communities: The Engineers Museum (governed by the Union of the Engineer Corps), The Salpa (Defence) Line Museum and the Salpa Line Tradition Association, the registered society, (Salpalinjan perinneyhdistys ry), both in Miehikk√§l√§, the Bunker Museum in Virolahti. The parties have been cooperation in developing the Bunker Museum, Engineers Museum and Salpa Line Museum with the support of the European union structural funds for less than a decade. On the Salpa defence line there will be organised annually a hiking tour. The 19th Salpa trekking was to take place in 2012 from 29 June to 1 July. The Salpa defence line is in some parts relatively good condition as it was never needed due to the truce of 5 September 1944 and Moscow Armistice, 19 September 1944, which ended the co-belligerence of Finland with the Greater German Realm and made the Lapland War inevitable. ==Open hours== { border=\\"1\\"  - !

The Bantu languages of western equatorial Africa. London: Oxford University Press. According to one of the newest updates to the Bantu classification system,Maho, Jouni. 2003. A classification of the Bantu languages: An update of Guthrie‚Äôs referential system. In Derek Nurse & G√©rard Philippson (eds.), The Bantu languages, 639‚Äì651. London: Routledge. other languages belonging to this subgroup are: Pol (A92a), P…îm…î (A92b), Kweso (A92C) and Kak…î (A93). The Kwakum people refer to themselves (and their language) as either Kwakum or Bakoum (sometimes spelled Bakum). However, they say that the \\"Bakoum\\" pronunciation only began after the arrival of Europeans in Cameroon, though it is frequently used today. Kwakum is mainly spoken in the East region of Cameroon, southwest of the city Bertoua. == Dialects == Kwakum is listed by Simons & Fennig as having three dialects: Til, Beten (or Mbeten, or Petem), and Baki (or Mbaki). According to David Hare, there are two main districts in which Kwakum is spoken: Dimako and Doum√©. The Dimako district has 8 villages centered around the town of Dimako. The Doum√© district has 8 villages centered around the town of Doum√©. The lexical similarity between the Kwakum spoken in these two districts is 92.3%. Among these villages are the two villages of Baktala and Longtimbi. The people who live in these villages consider themselves to be Kwakum, but also call themselves Til. There is a lexical similarity of 91.4% between the Kwakum spoken in the Dimako district and the language spoken in the Til villages. There are four villages of people who consider themselves to be Mbeten (and not Kwakum). The lexical similarity between the Kwakum of the Dimako district and the Mbeten villages is 81.3%. The Mbaki live far from the Kwakum and the lexical similarity is only 47.7%. It is thus unlikely that Mbaki should be considered a dialect of Kwakum. == Tone == Kwakum is a tonal language, and has been analyzed by Stacey Hare as having three tones. == Current Literature == The first analysis of Kwakum was completed in 2005 by Fran√ßois Belliard.Belliard, Fran√ßois. 2005.

She played in her 100th game for the Lakers on October 1, 2011. She would be held pointless as the Lakers would lose the game by a 1‚Äì0 tally to Quinnipiac. It was Quinnipiac's first victory over Mercyhurst in twelve regular season matches. Two weeks later (on October 15), Bram would register a hat trick as the Lakers blanked the Providence Friars women's ice hockey program by a 5‚Äì0 tally. On October 28, 2011, her sister (and Mercyhurst teammate) Shelby Bram would score her first career NCAA goal as Mercyhurst defeated the Lindenwood Lady Lions by a 7‚Äì0 tally.

It is a common species in regions of West Africa with significant forest cover, where it is often weedy. It is most common in disturbed, moist soils, in which it scrambles over other plants. The name Commelina thomasii was often used for West African plants until it was realized that Commelina acutispatha, an older name originally applied to plants from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, was the same species. The petals range in color from white to pale lilac to violet; the lower petal is about half as large as the upper paired petals. The central anther is reported to have a blue patch on the connective.

The family left for Poole, in Dorsetshire, United Kingdom around 1817.Smallwood, Joseph R. et al., eds, Encyclopedia of Newfoundland and Labrador Vol. 2 Newfoundland Book Publishers Ltd. pp.574,576 He was educated at Mr. Buller's school at Southampton, then commenced medical studies with a Mr. Salter in Poole. He entered Guy's Hospital as a pupil of his brother-in-law, the surgeon Mr. Morgan. He set up a practice in Hoddesdon in Hertfordshire, where he married Agnes Grant, of London. They remained there for fifteen years, then left for Australia, hoping the warmer climate would improve his bronchitis. They landed in Melbourne in 1850, but only remained there a week or so, and moved to Adelaide, arriving on 31 December 1850. In 1851 he joined the rush to the Victorian gold diggings, but soon returned empty-handed to South Australia. He next went into partnership with Dr. Benjamin Archer Kent (1808 ‚Äì 25 November 1864), for whom Kent Town is named. In 1853 he was appointed Colonial Surgeon, having the supervision of the Hospital, the Lunatic Asylum, and the Gaol. On resigning that position in 1857 he joined Dr. Anton Bayer and continued in practice with him until the latter's death in 1866. He then entered into partnership with Dr. H. Thomas Whittell (1826 ‚Äì 21 August 1899) and, apart from a time around 1870 when he travelled to London to receive his F.R.C.S. diploma and to Heidelberg to receive his M.D., remained with him until 1873, when he was joined by his son, Dr. Charles Gosse, newly returned from gaining qualifications in Britain. He was elected to the Adelaide Hospital's first Board of Management and also appointed as honorary surgeon, a position he held until 1876 when he retired, and was appointed consulting surgeon. ==Interests== In his youth he had an interest in natural history, which was developed by collecting specimens for the great naturalist Philip Henry Gosse, a cousin of his father. For about fifteen years he was a Governor of the South Australian Institute. He helped Julia Farr found in 1878 the Home for Incurables, with which he had a continued association until his death. He was appointed visitor to the Parkside Lunatic Asylum, and held that position for many years. He was elected the first Warden of the Senate of the University of Adelaide, which position he filled until the time of his death, with one interval. He was an active member of the Church of England Synod, representing Trinity Church, North Terrace, until he moved to Wakefield Street, Kent Town.

J√°nos √Åder was elected President with an absolute majority. ==Background== P√°l Schmitt was elected head of state of Hungary in summer 2010, following the 2010 Hungarian parliamentary election in which Fidesz came out with an absolute majority of seats and PM Viktor Orb√°n nominated him. As a result of an allegation of academic misconduct he was stripped by a legal session of the Senate of the SOTE of his doctorate degree on 29 March. On 2 April, Schmitt told Parliament he would resign as President saying that \\"under the Constitution, the President must represent the unity of the Hungarian nation. I have unfortunately become a symbol of division; I feel it is my duty to leave my position.\\" Speaker of the National Assembly L√°szl√≥ K√∂v√©r then took over as acting President according to the Constitution of Hungary, which also mandates the National Assembly has 30 days to elect a new President. One of the five Deputy Speakers of the Parliament, S√°ndor Lezs√°k, was commissioned with exercising the Speaker's rights and responsibilities in the interim period. ==Candidates== The Socialist Party (MSZP), Politics Can Be Different (LMP) and the Democratic Coalition (DK) agreed about the opposition parties' guarantees for having a meaningful say in the presidential election. The Socialist Party also submitted a bill to mandate a four-fifths majority in order to elect a new head of state instead of the current two-thirds majority so as to stymie Fidesz-KDNP's ability to unilaterally elect a new President without the opposition. Jobbik nominated MEP Krisztina Morvai and former Minister of Defence Lajos F√ºr as the party's candidates to the presidential position on 4 April. However, F√ºr later announced that he would not accept the nomination. Fidesz announced that will nominate MEP J√°nos √Åder.http://derstandard.at/1334132568712/Janos-Ader-soll-neuer-Praesident- werden √Åder was criticised for his close relationship with Prime Minister Viktor Orb√°n on the grounds that he would not serve as a check on the power of the Prime Minister.http://www.voanews.com/english/news/europe/Hungary- Confirms-Orban-Ally-Ader-as-President-149830875.html ==Results== MSZP boycotted the vote because they said the move would strengthen the hand of the ruling party who have already appointed allies to the judiciary and in the media. LMP and the Democratic Coalition also joined the boycott. LMP's Benedek J√°vor said their decision was based on taking a stand against the procedure of √Åder's nominated as, following Schmitt‚Äôs resignation, there was a trust deficit in democratic institutions and a consensus should have been made on a non-partisan candidate. √Åder took the oath of office immediately and was congratulated by Prime Minister Viktor Orb√°n, Parliamentary Speaker L√°szl√≥ K√∂v√©r, Deputy Prime Minister Zsolt Semj√©n and the four parliamentary group leaders; he then met with his predecessor P√°l Schmitt, former Prime Ministers P√©ter Boross and P√©ter Medgyessy and the President of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences J√≥zsef P√°link√°s. {  + Hungarian presidential election, 2012 - ! style=\\"text-align:left\\"  Candidate ! style=\\"text- align:left\\"  Nominating Party ! style=\\"text-align:left\\"  Votes ! style=\\"text-align:left\\"  % -  In favor of J√°nos √Åder  Fidesz  262  67.87% -  Against √Åder  ---  40  10.36% -  colspan=2  Did not vote  79  20.47% -  colspan=2  Invalid votes  5  1.30% - ! colspan=2  Total votes ! 307 ! 79.53% - ! colspan=2  Total seats ! 386 ! 100.00 } Reactions After the vote, √Åder said that he would \\"avail himself fully of both his constitutional rights and obligations\\" and that he \\"say[s] to the people of the neighbouring countries, and to our allies in the European Union and NATO, we offer them friendship and respect - which also means that we expect the same respect and friendship back\\". He also added that the new Constitution, which he helped draft, \\"provides from all aspects an adequate direction and framework to find the right solutions to the fundamental issues and challenges of the 21st century... Let me reach out to believers and to non-believers alike, and ask them to see in each other what unites us, as understanding one another will enrich us all\\". Prime Minister Viktor Orb√°n added that the best decision for \\"setting in motion and stabilising\\" the constitution was made as √Åder was an \\"anchor\\". \\"We know the President, we respect him and think highly of him\\". Jobbik's deputy leader Zolt√°n Balcz√≥ said that √Åder should be above \\"party identity\\" and that the party had hoped \\"national cooperation\\", as announced by Fidesz-KDNP, meant a non-partisan candidate should have been chosen. For its part, the Democratic Coalition's √Ågnes Vadai said that √Åder was not trustworthy enough to safeguard the democratic nature of the state. LMP's Benedek J√°vor also said that √Åder should start a constitutional review of electoral and justice laws. Academic reactions to the result included Attila Juh√°sz, of the think tank Political Capital, who said: \\"You should not expect √Åder to become a power check and resist the Prime Minister, that's not what you can read from his career. It's also important that the president elected now will be in office until 2017, and the office will be held by someone from the innermost circles of Fidesz even if the party loses the 2014 parliamentary elections\\". Ferenc Kumin of the Sz√°zadv√©g Foundation, said that √Åder was presented as representative of the plurality of groups within the country in opposition to the criticism levelled against him of his closeness to the \\"political right\\" and that his first speech to Parliament was \\"convincing proof\\" of his readiness for the \\"high position and the magnitude of his job with due humility\\". G√°bor Filippov of the Hungarian Progressive Institute said that √Åder will be to show that he is not bound by his previous Fidesz-associations as he took the duties of President from a non-partisan approach. ==References== 2012 Category:2012 elections in Europe Category:2012 in Hungary ","title":"2012 Hungarian presidential election"},{"id":"35305594","text":"Victor George Carrington was an Australian administrator.

He is the first South Korean-born baseball player to be selected in the MLB draft. ==Career== With his parents, Kang moved to the United States at age 14 from South Korea. They lived in Alabama, where Kang had an aunt, for two years. They relocated to the Atlanta, area, as his parents could not find work in Alabama. As his parents researched schools in the Atlanta area, they read an article on Jeff Francoeur, who graduated from Parkview High School, and decided to enroll Kang there. His parents moved back to South Korea after Kang's brother graduated from high school in 2007. The Tampa Bay Devil Rays selected Kang in the 15th round of the 2006 Major League Baseball (MLB) Draft, 439th overall. He became the first South Korean-born baseball player to be selected in an MLB draft. Turning down scholarships from four-year colleges, such as the University of Georgia, Kang attended Chattahoochee Valley Community College, a junior college, where he played college baseball for one season. He signed with the Rays as a draft-and-follow prospect in prior to the 2007 draft. He initially requested a signing bonus of $1 million, but agreed to sign for $75,000. Kang spent his first two professional seasons with the Princeton Rays in the Rookie-level Appalachian League and Hudson Valley Renegades in the Class-A Short Season New York‚ÄìPenn League. In 2009, Kang played for the Bowling Green Hot Rods of the Class-A Midwest League, where he led the team with a .307 batting average. During the season, Bowling Green manager, Matt Quatraro raved about Kang's ability and potential: \\"He's just a good hitter. He is more of a double hitter than a home run hitter, but I can see him hitting 25 homers in the big leagues with a lot of doubles. He has that kind of power. He hasn't shown it yet, but it's there. Watch batting practice and you immediately see the way the ball comes off his bat. He's got a lot of raw talent.\\" In this year, Kang represented the Rays in the All-Star Futures Game.,http://m.mlb.com/news/article/5725750/ In 2010, Kang was promoted once again, to the High-A affiliate Charlotte Stone Crabs in the Florida State League, however this year his batting average dropped over 60 points to .241, and he managed to hit only one home run. When speaking to Kang about the 2010 season, he said \\"I tried to muscle to ball too much and over swung too often. After having a good year this past season, I started to think too much about hitting homeruns, and I think that got the best of me. Although that season was a huge disappointment, it allowed me to take a step back and not be too aggressive at the plate.\\"http://www.milb.com/news/print.jsp?ymd=20100507&content;_id=9866450&vkey;=news_t2730&fext;=.jsp&sid;=t2730 Beginning the 2011 season as a reserve with the Montgomery Biscuits of the Class-AA Southern League, Kang played his way into a starting role by hitting 11 home runs in the 316 at bats. Diving deeper into the numbers, there was another encouraging sign from Kang in 2011. He had a line drive percentage of 25.6 which was the fourth highest rate in the entire system for players with more than 200 plate appearances. This is indicative of a return to a line drive approach at the plate that as you will see in his scouting report, is the natural result of his swing when he is going well at the dish.http://rays.scout.com/story/1136925-rays-prospect-profile-49-kyeong-kang He opened the 2012 season with the Biscuits. Kang led the team with 14 homeruns in Double-A, but saw a jump in his strikeout rate, posting 135 strikeouts to 51 walks. He struggled particularly against left handed pitchers, batting just .111 in 90 at bats (.290 against righties in 255 at bats), while striking out 45 times to just 5 walks. In fact, all 14 of his homeruns came against right handed pitchers. [8][9] To start the 2013 season, Kang was demoted to High-A Charlotte, but quickly found himself back in Montgomery, after slashing .339/.426/.525 in 17 games. He once again led the team with 15 homeruns, and also hit 17 doubles and 7 triples in Double-A. He became the first player to lead Montgomery in homeruns in back-to-back seasons in 60 years. Between two levels, Kang recorded career highs in homeruns (16), total bases (193), and also improved upon his weakness against lefties (.250 vs. 252).[10] After the 2013 season, Kang became a free agent. On November 18, 2013, he signed a minor league contract with the Baltimore Orioles. He played for the Bowie Baysox of the Class-AA Eastern League in 2014. The Double-A Bowies outfield was extremely crowded all-season long with player such as Dariel Alvarez, Ronald Bermudez, Chih-Hsien Chiang, and Kang struggled to find playing time during the month of April, only playing in 11 games. He was often benched against left handed pitchers, which made it harder for him to find his rhythm. However, with patience, Kang's numbers started looking better during the months of June (.333/.367/.533) and July (.293/.336/.424). Kang saw his numbers dip a bit during the month of August, but his offensive production flourished again towards the end of the season.

Corte-Real's high level of intelligence had been manifest since his early schooling. He enrolled at the University of Coimbra, where he gained his doctorate in canons in 1686 and in law in 1687. He then held the office of chief judge of the Porto Comarca and, during the course of his duties, became well-liked for his righteousness and character. The judge's competence did not go unnoticed by the Royal Court and the King, Peter II, sent him a summons in January 1691 to leave magistrature and to become a special diplomat in the Dutch Republic, in order to settle the matter of the constant attacks of the Dutch navy against Portuguese ships.  Diplomat  On 3 March, that same year, Corte-Real embarked to the Dutch Republic. On 14 April, as they sailed across the coast of England, the ship ran aground on a sandbank. The danger was imminent. Panic took over the passengers and crew, but Corte-Real kept his calm, and helped the officers overseeing the evacuation procedure. Corte-Real, his family, and the captain left the ship aboard a boat, the rest of the crew aboard another boat. The ship foundered, and the two boats spent the night adrift until morning, when their occupants spotted the English coastline. Corte-Real travelled to London, where he departed for The Hague. Diogo de Mendon√ßa Corte-Real proved to be efficient in dealing with the difficulties that arose between Portugal and the Dutch Republic. After a series of conferences about the matter, on 22 May 1692, the diplomat achieved the goal of his mission when the two nations signed a treaty in which the Dutch Republic paid eighty-thousand patacas as compensation for all the attacks on Portuguese ships. The success of this mission earned him praise from the Portuguese King. The King, who had wanted send an envoy to the Spanish Court, saw Corte-Real fit to the task, and named him as such in 1693. Corte-Real stayed at the Spanish Court until 1703, year in which he returned to Portugal on account of the death of King Charles II of Spain and the outbreak of the Spanish War of Succession. On 2 April 1701, King Peter II named him Secret√°rio Real das Merc√™s e do Expediente having, as duties, passing decrees, orders, letters, and papers that were not of State-level importance and, more specifically, the ordering of merc√™s (mercies, roughly translated; the repayment for services to the State and Crown). When Portugal joined the Spanish War of Succession, Corte-Real was encharged with the administration of armed operations. Later, he took part in the negotiations leading to the signing of the Treaty of Utrecht, that would put an end to the conflict.  Secretary of State  King Peter II died on 9 December 1706, and King John V rose to the throne. The new King named Diogo de Mendon√ßa Corte-Real his Secret√°rio de Estado (Secretary of State, a position equivalent to the present-day Prime Minister) on 27 April 1707. Corte-Real was, during the course of his duties, encharged with the marriage contracts between Prince Joseph of Portugal and the infanta of Spain, Mariana Victoria, as well as between the Prince of the Ast√∫rias D. Ferdinand and the infanta Barbara of Portugal. Mendon√ßa Corte-Real married D. Teresa de Bourbon, widow of √Ålvaro da Silveira e Albuquerque, colonel of the regiment in Cascais and Governor of Rio de Janeiro, in October 1718. Their first daughter, D. Joaquina de Bourbon, was baptized by D. Tom√°s de Almeida, the Cardinal Patriarch of Lisbon, and their first son, Jo√£o Pedro de Mendon√ßa Corte-Real, had King John as his godfather. The diplomat was active and was in office until his unexpected death on 9 May 1736. He had been strolling through his farm in Benfica, Lisbon, when he felt a piercing pain. He died in a few hours. His body was buried in the Church of Nossa Senhora do Amparo. == References == * Redac√ß√£o Quidnovi, com coordena√ß√£o de Jos√© Hermano Saraiva, Hist√≥ria de Portugal, Dicion√°rio de Personalidades, Volume XV, Ed.

He split his childhood years between the low country, where the Savannah River merges with the coastal marsh, and in the Georgia segment of the Appalachian called the Blue Ridge Mountains. == Biography == Nigel was born to Whittier and Erin Wright, both professional artists. The Wrights acquaintances included professional artists, writers, and musicians. As an only child, schooled at home, and in the regular presence of working artists, Nigel Wright came to songwriting with a background of individualism and exploration. Though trained on piano, Wright began experimenting with guitar, using improvisation and alternate tunings. While the southern United States is known for its heritage of storytelling, Wright felt drawn to abstraction and intuition in his lyrics, saying, \\"You feel like you're not on earth anymore when you're swimming, and when you're weightless‚Äì and an otherworldly quality is something I think that weightlessness and songwriting have in common. Those first few moments when you start putting lyrics you came up with days ago while you were walking outside‚Äì and they just merge perfectly with some chords you just happen to stumble across.\\" Butterfly Records (Est. 2011) discovered Nigel Wright's work in 2011 on SoundCloud. According to the record label, Wright's album \\"Millfoil\\", recorded at his home studio, displayed the sixteen- year-old's mature grasp of musical structures, verse, and vocalization. ==2012== Nigel played his European premiere at the Haldern Pop Bar January 19, 2012, supporting Nada Surf for the occasion of the 20 years anniversary of the German INTRO magazine.

He is the founder and artistic director of the critically acclaimed Toronto Tabla Ensemble. ==Biography== Early life Ritesh Das was born in Kolkata, West Bengal to parents Nrityacharya Prohlad Das and Smt. Nilima Das. He is the brother of renowned Kathak dancer, Late Pandit Chitresh Das. Das graduated from Don Bosco High School in 1975 and went on to study commerce at City College, Kolkata from 1976-1978. His parents opened a music and dance academy, Nritya Bharati, the first of its kind in Kolkata, which allowed him immediate exposure to music and tabla at a young age. His musical studies began in 1972, studying tabla with Pandit Shankar Ghosh, vocals with T.L. Rana, and sitar with M.D. Mullick. When Das was 22 years old, he moved to Los Angeles, USA, to be a part of the AMAN Folk Ensemble. While in California, he served an apprenticeship under Zakir Hussain and then began studying tabla with his current guru, Pandit Swapan Chaudhuri at the Ali Akbar College of Music. Toronto Tabla Ensemble (1991 - Present) In 1987, Das moved to Toronto where he began teaching tabla on a full-time basis. In 1991, he formed the Toronto Tabla Ensemble.

Fancy describes itself as \\"part store, blog, magazine and wish list,\\" and Einhorn has said that it seeks to redefine the shopping experience. Fancy was valued at $600 million by American Express, Billionaire Len Blavatnik, Actor Will Smith and other investors on July 3, 2013. In February 2015, Einhorn's company Fancy raised a $20 million Series D strategic funding round which was led by Mexico's Carlos Slim Domit and the CCC holding company. In July 2019, Einhorn opened a comic book store called Loot. == Biography == Einhorn was born in New York City, NY, and turned 30 years old in 2012. He is married with two sons and two Chihuahuas. Drake and Joe Einhorn Einhorn became involved in the startup world at age 16, when he became the first employee of Capital IQ, a corporate information service. In 2004, he co-founded and served as CTO of Inform Technologies, LLC, which connected related content across online media and information companies. In 2009, Einhorn founded the social e-commerce platform Fancy. Einhorn is a fan of rap music ‚Äì especially by the artist Drake ‚Äì and has said that Kanye West's blog influenced Fancy's website. Einhorn has also been a personal user and supporter of Google Glass, leading to his company's Google Glass app that suggests items based on colors the user is looking at. ==Loot== Einhorn is the owner of the comic book store Loot in Brooklyn, which opened in July 2019. He plans to host workshops on teaching kids how to write and draw their own comics in order to promote creativity and alternatives to video games at Loot. Einhorn credits his motivation to promote creativity in kids to a high school science fair, during which he won a chance to make a hologram that he has kept to this day. Loot was featured on the Today Show in January 2020. The name of the store comes from the idea that kids can earn 'loot' for buying, borrowing, or making and selling their own comics. Einhorn's inspiration for the store comes from his own interest in comics as a kid and loot mechanics in Fortnite. The store's collection of comics began as Einhorn's personal stash and has grown with donations, with additional sponsorships coming from Warby Parker and Louis Leterrier. Most of the store's collection consists of superhero comics. == Fancy == Einhorn founded Fancy in 2009. He has described his company as a service that \\"combines the best features of Pinterest with the traditional Amazon experience,\\" creating an image-centric e-commerce platform where users set the trends by posting items they 'fancy.' In a 2012 interview with Hypebeast, Einhorn said that Fancy seeks to become \\"the new Amazon.com\\" by creating a social e-commerce platform where users can interact with one another to explore, discover, and purchase items. Fancy is distinctly different from sites like Pinterest in that it offers merchants the ability to sell items directly to consumers. In order to sell on Fancy, a merchant needs to 'claim' an item that users have already posted. Fancy takes a commission fee from each sale. Fancy has attracted a number of well-known backers and board members, including American Express, Francois-Henri Pinault, Len Blavatnik, Will Smith, Jack Dorsey of Twitter, and Chris Hughes of Facebook. High-profile users include Mark Zuckerberg and Kanye West, who has been an outspoken supporter of the site. In September 2013 Einhorn secured an investment round of $7 million for Fancy from, among others, Richard C. Perry, owner of Barneys New York, and his son David Perry. In February 2015, Fancy raised a $20 million Series D strategic funding round which was led by Mexico's Carlos Slim Domit and the CCC holding company. Fancy noted that it would use the funding to \\"continue to build out its technology platform and execute on new key strategic partnerships‚Äù. ==Recognition== * Crain's New York Business listed Einhorn as one of the 40 most successful entrepreneurs under the age of 40 for 2014. * Business of Fashion named Einhorn in its list of 500 People Shaping the Global Fashion Industry. * Business Insider ranked Einhorn at #32 in its Silicon Alley 100 list of the Coolest People in New York Tech. == References == Category:American technology chief executives Category:American chief technology officers Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Joseph Einhorn"},{"id":"35306505","text":"\\"I Don't Know\\" is a single from the Canadian band The Sheepdogs.

It is located on the outskirts of the city of Le Mans, on the left bank of the Huisne, adjoining the town of Yvr√©-l'√âv√™que. The abbey was suppressed in the French Revolution. The surviving buildings came close to destruction on several occasions, but their preservation was finally assured in 1958 by the General Council of the Sarthe department. ==History==  Origins  Perseigne Abbey, built within the confines of Norman Maine by the powerful William III of Bell√™me, can be considered the oldest Cistercian abbey in Maine. It was built in 1145, and is today situated in the commune of Neufch√¢tel-en-Saosnois. All that remains of it today is a section of wall. During the second millennium, Le Mans saw the construction of several abbeys. Religious faith was booming in the town: The renowned La Couture abbey was built, as were the Saint-Pierre, Saint-Paul and Saint- Vincent abbeys. Mostly, the abbeys were built in privileged areas in the heart of the forest. In 1199, the English queen Berengaria of Navarre was beside herself with grief. Her husband, King Richard the Lionheart, had succumbed to his wounds in a crossbow battle at Ch√¢lus in Haute-Vienne. The Queen was removed from power in Maine but settled among the Plantagenet dynasty in 1204. She became a dowager. In addition, she began to spend all of her time at the Palace of the Count of Maine. Legend has it that the Queen found asylum, but not happiness, in the town. Certain local government figures, in cohorts with her mother-in-law, Eleanor of Aquitaine, or brother-in-law, John Lackland, constantly waged battle with the Queen, trying to steal the land granted to her by the French king Philip Augustus. Only after 26 years in exile did the Queen, aged 59, decide to found an abbey.  Construction of the abbey  Saint-Benoit rules maintained that an abbey built outwith the city limits should respect the obligations of spiritual sanctuary. However, the Queen elected to have the abbey built between town and forest, at the city limits of Le Mans. The Queen built it for her own salvation. Both history and legend suggest that this abbey may also have been built to redeem the fortunes of Plantagenet Kings. On 25 March 1229, the Queen ordered the Citeaux monks to begin construction of Notre-Dame-de-l'Epau. Furthermore, the Queen was a benefactor of this order. The decision to choose monks residing locally was not left to chance. The Queen was also a great friend of confidant Adam de Perseigne, priest at the monastery of the same name and long time confidant of Richard the Lionheart. Father of the Queen, Sanche VI, himself founded the abbey at Oliva in 1140. This tranquil site was chosen as the river Huisne was teeming with fish. Although Louis IX ceded the Espal grounds to the Queen, it would be the monks of Co√´ffort who would be troublesome to Queen Berengaria. This brotherhood asked the Queen for financial compensation, claiming that the land had been left to them by Arthur of Brittany, Queen Berengaria's nephew. Plans for the abbey were classic with construction respecting the style of other Cistercian buildings. Construction took from 1230 to 1365. The early phases of construction went smoothly. Four years after construction began, the Bishop of Le Mans Geoffroy de Laval placed the monastery under the patronage of both Notre-Dame and Saint John the Baptiste. The main buildings were not finished until 1280.  The Hundred Years' War  In March 1365, in the middle of the Hundred Years' War, the people of Le Mans burned the building of their own accord. As the monks had left the abbey, the inhabitants feared that enemy troops would seize the building and use it as a base from which to attack the town. In fact, it was the noblemen who forced the people to take action. The church was the part of the abbey to suffer the most damage. However, the following year the bourgeois of Le Mans decided to completely rebuild the damaged parts of the church. But they were not the ones who financed the renovation. Money was difficult to come by in the region and donations to religious orders were rare.  14th-17th centuries  All the damaged buildings were renovated between 1400 and 1444. Charles VI raised finance by taxing the local population. One of the main artisans of the church restoration was Guillaume de Bonneville.  18th-19th centuries  At the beginning of the French Revolution the abbey was transformed into a gigantic agricultural outbuilding. Yet the abbey was already listed as a \\"historic monument.\\" Its cultural value was already recognised by the old regime, in particular the ancient church, its sacristy and most of all its 18th-century staircase. In July of 1940, the German Wehrmacht turned the abbey into a \\"frontslager\\" to house French officer POW's who were taken after the armistice in the region of the Sarthe. Eventually this camp was closed and the prisoners were moved to Oflag XIIIA. After the war, the elected politicians of the Sarthe and Mayenne regions voted unanimously to buy back and restore the abbey which had been a monastic retreat for half a millennium. In 1958, the building was acquired by the regional council of the Sarthe for 11 million old francs. The abbey underwent a long restoration, strictly observing the 13th-century architectural style. Both the National School of Fine Arts of Le Mans and Paris actively participated. The church, the sacristy, the chapter house, the staircase and the cellar had already been listed since 1925 and the fa√ßades and roof were first listed in 1961 before these were reclassified in 1973 and again in 2005. At this point the abbey became both a place to visit and host events. Between 1965 and 1990, the abbey became popular for cultural functions, in particular for classical music events, conferences and exhibitions. The location is also used as the chair for the departmental assembly, in particular the 18th-century wing, which was restored in 1990. By 1991, a total of 60 million new francs had been spent overall on renovations. == The Queen's tomb == As she neared death, Berengaria of Navarra made clear her wish to be buried within the Abbey. Doubt remains over the exact location of her burial. Although the recumbent statue and tomb are there today, the exact whereabouts of her burial is unknown. In 1960, Pierre T√©rouanne found a wholly intact female skeleton in the basement of the chapter house. A small oak box has always followed the recumbent figure of the Queen despite its many pilgrimages since the Revolution. The marking Ossa Berangeria / 1230-1672-1821-1861 appears on the box. In reality, the Queen died before the Abbey could be finished. The only possibility for her burial site would have been in the abbey grounds. Her remains should therefore be situated underneath the tomb, a medieval work of art from the 13th century. On the tomb, the recumbent statue is similar to that of Ali√©nor d'Aquitaine at Fontevrault Abbey. The Queen is resting on her back, dressed in a long robe tied at the waist by a belt. The royal crown is placed on her head, which rests up on a cushion. At her feet, a lion is depicted slaying a greyhound. The lion and crown are symbols of royalty while the money-bag by her belt represents generosity. Her hands, folded over her chest, hold a book, the cover of which represents her own burial. In 1365, the building was devastated by fire and the tomb would certainly have been moved to the chapter house. It was definitely brought into the abbey in 1672, where it remained until the French Revolution when the building was sold as a clergy asset. The building became a gigantic agricultural grange and the tomb was lost carelessly under straw. Charles Albert Shotard, specially brought over from England, had to intervene and enforce that the tomb be respected. Pierre Thor√©, owner of the grange at the abbey, resolved himself to be separated from the tomb shortly afterwards. In December 1821, it was transferred to the northern transept of the cathedral. In 1861, the tomb was moved to the southern transept to make room for another tomb; that of Monseigneur Bouvier. The Queen's tomb was again displaced in 1920, when it was moved back to the northern transept in order to make room for a monument for the priests of the diocese who died for France. It would be 1970 before the Queen's tomb would finally be brought back to the chapter house at the Abbaye de l'Epau. It was placed above the mysterious remains found by Pierre Terouanne. This skeleton belonged to a woman who died in her sixties, or the age of the Queen at the time of her death. What is inside the box attached to the Queen's tomb is still a mystery to this day. == External links == * * Photos of the abbey Category:1229 establishments in Europe Category:1220s establishments in France Category:Buildings and structures in Sarthe Category:Christian monasteries established in the 13th century Category:Cistercian monasteries in France ","title":"L'√âpau Abbey"},{"id":"35306555","text":"Yogi Bear's Gold Rush (European title: Yogi Bear in Yogi Bear's Goldrush) is a 1994 2D action platformer video game developed by British studio Twilight for the Game Boy. ==Summary== Yogi Bear has to save Jellystone National Park from an evil ghost named Jake; who stole the funds needed to keep the park operating.Overview of Yogi Bear's Gold Rush at MobyGames There are six different stages in the game that range from a large city to the Wild West. There are no-powerups in the traditional sense; players must collect 100 picnic baskets for an extra life. Hidden doors and areas must be found in order to crack open the safes. Once inside a safe, Yogi must collect 25 gold coins to make a bar. In order to unlock the best ending, Yogi needs to convert 300 gold coins into 12 gold bars that will provide the park with the money to continue operations. The player has the ability to jump on most enemies to kill them. Some enemies must be left alone due to the lack of ability to wield a weapon. Falling down into bottomless pits or navigating into dangerous hazards will cause Yogi to lose a life. By default, the player gets three lives and one additional continue. ==Reception== GamePro rated the game as an inoffensive but unimpressive Super Mario clone, though they did praise the developers for creating an entirely new Yogi Bear game instead of a standard down-port of the SNES game Adventures of Yogi Bear (which was released almost simultaneously with Yogi Bear's Gold Rush). The four reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly were sharply divided about the game, giving it scores ranging from 3 to 8 out of 10 (averaging at 5.5 out of 10). However, all but one of them commented that Yogi Bear's Gold Rush is a generic platformer with levels lacking in both challenge and originality. Allgame gave the game a 2.5 out 5 rating, calling it \\"standard side-scrolling platform fare, borrowing heavily from the Super Mario Bros. series of games.\\"Rating information for Yogi Bear's Gold Rush at allgame ==References== Category:1994 video games Category:Yogi Bear Category:Game Boy-only games Category:GameTek games Category:Platform games Category:Side-scrolling video games Category:Single-player video games Category:Sunsoft games Category:Video games based on Hanna-Barbera series and characters Category:Video games based on animated television series Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom Category:Game Boy games Category:Cancelled Game Gear games ","title":"Yogi Bear's Gold Rush"},{"id":"35306558","text":"Jason Ballesteros (born October 7, 1985) is a Filipino professional basketball player for the Meralco Bolts of the Philippine Basketball Association (PBA).

Four designs were created for this house by Swiss architect Le Corbusier, but it was never built. This is the first project into which Le Corbusier incorporated \\"free plan\\" and \\"free facade\\" into his design. These ideas later become two of Corbusier's famous Five Points of Architecture. Domino Frame is also an outcome of this experimental design, which became the dominant design concept of Corbusier's later works. Most of the design drawings are published in the Le Corbusier File, a book that collects most of Le Corbusier's work. Forty-three plans were collected under the name of \\"Villa Meyer.\\" ==Four Versions== April‚ÄìMay, 1925 For the first version of the Villa Meyer, Le Corbusier chose a plot on Avenue Madrid. The plan is characterized by its \\"ring\\" feature, which creates a continuous central ramp extending to the top of the house. The entire house is built around the ramp. The house includes a central hall, affording a high degree of privacy to the occupants. October, 1925 The second version incorporated significant changes. The centralized plan was replaced with a rectangular plan. The cored ramp was also replaced with an attached spiral ramp. In this design, Corbusier also utilized another design methodology, the rhythmic component of the \\"bay module\\". He defined three type of bay to construct the house, Bay A which is 5 meters, B is 2.5 meters and C is around 1.25-1.5 meters. In this project he used CABAB and CAAA as two kinds of spatial arrangement. April, 1926 In the third design, the spiral ramp is removed, and the \\"A, B, C\\" bay arrangement became the most important thesis in this project. June 1926 This is the final project for Villa Meyer. This project is more focused on the overhang roof garden and the \\"A, B, C\\" bay arrangement. This was also the first design that used both free facade and free plan. The design includes a ramp connecting the three floors, and a double-height outdoor space incorporated into the building volume. At this stage, the client hired another architect to design the residence, so we do not know exactly in which location Le Corbuiser wished to construct this house. ==Relationship to landscape and surroundings== The gardens and the house of La Folie Saint-James, next to the Bois de Boulogne, are one of the best-known surviving designs by Belanger. Another of Belanger's extant buildings, Bagatelle, is located in the Bois de Boulogne, within close walking distance of the Folie Saint-James, though in its altered post-nineteenth- century state. This area lies next to Avenue Charles de Gaulle, the main axis of Paris, from the Arc de Triomphe. The house oriented toward west, opposite direction from downtown Paris. > Behind the swimming pool and service rooms, you would take breakfast...

This garden is not a French > formal garden but a small wilderness where, thanks to the woods of the Parc > St. James, one can imagine oneself far away from Paris. In 1925, on a drawing for the Villa Meyer project, Le Corbusier depicted in the margins, in a small thumbnail sketch, Belanger's Folie Saint-James while, in a letter to the owners, he described how it lies 'face √† un site hautement classique'. He stated his intention of choosing highly oriented plan. One reason was creating this feeling of \\"away from Paris\\"; the other reason is the consideration of privacy. Two houses were built adjacent to this house. Privacy became a big consideration in his design. This is also part of his letter to this land owner. ==The Final Rejection== Though Le Corbusier was infatuated by this plot and put so much effort, they are still fired him for unknown reasons. This is the letter written by the landowner, Mme Hirtz: > Dear Sir, Given the monetary crisis through which we are passing, I find > myself under the obligation of breaking off our discussions. I am very sorry > about this, but I hope that it will eventually be possible to reopen them ‚Äì > this is my sincere wish ‚Äì on my return from holiday. It is regrettable that this project was never built. But it had a lot of influence on Le Corbusier's later projects, including the Villa Stein-de Monzie and Villa Cook. ==Postscript: a further rejection== When Le Corbusier was asked in 1928 to design a house for the writer Victoria Ocampo in Buenos Aires, he made some quick changes to the Villa Meyer design and sent it to her. She chose instead to build a design by Alejandro Bustillo. ==ReferencesFurther reading== *‚ÄòCe jardin n'est point un jardin √† la fran√ßaise mais est un bocage sauvage o√π l'on peut gr√¢ce aux futaies du Parc St.-James se croire loin de Paris Le Corbusier‚Äô (Le Corbusier and Pierre Jeanneret, ≈íuvre compl√®te 1910‚Äì1929, p. 88‚Äì9) *Max Risselada (2008).

As a wicketkeeper-batsman, Charles started his ODI career against Australia in March 2012. His first T20I came against England in September 2011, and he became just the second cricketer from the island of St Lucia to play for the West Indies (the first was Darren Sammy, who was captain in Charles' international debut). Johnson was included in the West Indies' 15-man squad for the 2012 ICC World Twenty20 held in September and October that year. ==Domestic and T20 franchise career== Charles played his first twenty20 match in January 2008, representing Saint Lucia in the Stanford Twenty20. Opening the batting with Keddy Lesporis, Charles managed scores of 2 and 21 from the only matches he played in the competition. Later that year he debuted for the Windward Islands in the West Indies Board Cup, the regional one-day tournament. His performances were not sufficient to secure a place in the team's one-day side, and in 2009 Charles played neither List A nor twenty20 cricket. However, he made his first-class debut in January that year and played eight matches for the Windward Islands in the Regional Four Day Competition. In 16 visits to the crease he accumulated 292 runs, including a single half-century, putting him seventh in the team's list of leading run-scorers in that year's competition. Charles did not represent the Windward Islands in the 2009/10 Regional Four Day Competition, but in 2010 he returned to the List A side for the West Indies Board Cup, and played his first twenty20 match for the team. In the first match of the Caribbean T20, Charles opened the batting with Devon Smith and exploited several reprieves (Charles was dropped three times and nearly run out) to score his first half- century in the format. On 3 June 2018, he was selected to play for the Toronto Nationals in the players' draft for the inaugural edition of the Global T20 Canada tournament. In November 2019, he was selected to play for the Sylhet Thunder in the 2019‚Äì20 Bangladesh Premier League. In July 2020, he was named in the Barbados Tridents squad for the 2020 Caribbean Premier League. ==International career== Having been selected in the West Indies squad for the 2012 Twenty20, Charles opened the bat with Chris Gayle in the third match (he batted after the fall of the first wicket in the West Indies opening match and in the second did not bat as the match was rained off). After building a century partnership with Gayle, Charles (who was described by ESPNCricinfo as having \\"little obvious pedigree as an opening batsman\\") went on to score 84 to help his team to victory against England. It was his highest score in first- class, List A, or even twenty20 cricket. The following month Charles was dropped from the West Indies squad to face Bangladesh in a five-match ODI series. He's also having the joint record for taking the most catches by a substitute fielder in a T20I innings.(2) along with Jonathan Carter, Eoin Morgan, Hashim Amla, Jeetan Patel and Chamu Chibhabha.. ==References * Category:1989 births Category:Living people Category:Saint Lucian cricketers Category:West Indies One Day International cricketers Category:West Indies Twenty20 International cricketers Category:Saint Lucia representative cricketers Category:Windward Islands cricketers Category:Antigua Hawksbills cricketers Category:St Lucia Zouks cricketers Category:Rangpur Rangers cricketers Category:Jamaica Tallawahs cricketers Category:Nangarhar Leopards cricketers Category:Rajshahi Kings cricketers Category:Multan Sultans cricketers ","title":"Johnson Charles"},{"id":"35306604","text":"John Benjamin Myhers (December 18, 1921 ‚Äì May 27, 1992) was an American character actor of stage and screen (both big and small).

Chafing is usually contracted in the inner thighs and inner glutes; armpits and nipples can also develop chafing although it is less common. Severe chafing is known as friction burn. ==Causes== Chafing is caused by clothing rubbing against the skin. Chafing can also be caused by improper or overly loose fitting clothing generating extra friction. Obesity is commonly thought to be the leading cause of thigh chafing, and in some cases losing body fat may help the issue, but the problem is just as noticeable in athletes with well developed quadriceps and people with tight bone structures. Chafing is quite prevalent among long distance athletes such as cyclists or marathon runners due to the extensive time periods during which the skin is in irritating conditions. Chafing may be caused by the salt and residue left behind after sweat evaporates. If sweat is allowed to dry, and exercise is resumed, the salt may intensify the friction and cause further irritation. Other contributing factors include hot weather, sensitive skin, sand from the beach getting into problem areas, and prior skin irritation. ==Prevention and treatment== Staying dry may keep the skin from the developing further chafing, although this can be next to impossible in hot weather and requires avoiding exercise. After the workout, you must take a bath daily because sweat will evaporate and its salt causes chafing or you can use certain products such as baby powder, potato flour or antiperspirant may help with keeping the problem areas dry. An alternative to staying dry is lubricating the skin with petroleum jelly or other lubricants in order to reduce the friction and allow the body parts to glide without forming a rash. In many cases, however, especially those involving the upper thighs, clothing is the biggest culprit. Cotton clothes should be avoided as should anything with large seams. Sports focused underwear and clothing made from polyester, nylon or spandex can largely reduce or entirely solve the issue in some cases. Problems caused by salt residue from evaporated sweat can be solved by using wet wipes to clean problem areas before resuming exercise. Once the source that caused the irritation is taken away, the affected skin area will normally heal in a few days. Severe cases (friction burn) may become infected and require medical attention. They may also leave scars upon healing. == External links == Category:Skin conditions resulting from physical factors ","title":"Chafing (skin)"},{"id":"35306646","text":"The Ambassador of Great Britain to Sweden was the foremost diplomatic representative in Sweden of the Kingdom of Great Britain, created by the Treaty of Union in 1707, in charge of the British diplomatic mission in Stockholm.

Twenty of the 47 occupants on board were killed. ==Aircraft and crew== Flight 736 was operated using a Convair CV-580 (registration number N5802). The aircraft was originally certificated as a Convair CV-440 on March 4, 1957, but was modified to include upgraded turbine engines and propellers and re-certificated as a CV-580 on May 25, 1965. At the time of the accident, the aircraft had accumulated a total of 29,173 flight hours. The CV-580 was flown by Captain Gary L. Mull, aged 33, and co-pilot Richard B. Gardner, aged 30. ==Flight== Flight 736 took off from Detroit, Michigan bound for Washington D.C., with intermediate stops in Erie, Bradford, and Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. The flight was uneventful until the aircraft began its approach to Bradford. At 19:57 Eastern Standard Time, Flight 736 reported passing a DME east of Erie, and was instructed to descend to 4,000 feet and cleared for an approach to Bradford. At the same time, Flight 736 was advised that, at the last hourly observation, Bradford weather reported light snow showers, blowing snow, and one mile visibility. At 20:05, Bradford approach controllers advised Flight 736 again of light snow, blowing snow, and one mile visibility. Flight 736 acknowledged each weather advisory. At 20:08, Flight 736 reported that they were turning inbound for runway 32 and they were informed the wind was 290 degrees at 15 knots. This was Flight 736's last transmission before the crash. Flight 736 continued to descend until the aircraft first struck trees approximately 2-1/8 nautical miles short of the runway. The airplane cut through the trees for a further 800 feet, extensively damaging the engines, until it impacted the ground. The fuselage came to rest inverted with the top portion (roof) of the fuselage torn away. Most of the survivors were seated toward the back of the aircraft and were wearing seatbelts, remaining in their seats until the plane came to a halt. Passengers who were able to free themselves then worked to free the remaining survivors. Due to a blinding snowstorm, rescue workers were initially prevented from reaching the crash site. Survivors started a bonfire outside of the aircraft using wood, seat cushions, and luggage to keep warm and attract rescuers to the crash site. ==Investigation== The National Transportation Safety Board investigated the accident. After reviewing the cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder, the NTSB determined that the flight was flawless until the flight reached a DME 2.9 miles from the airport. The minimum altitude at the 2.9 mile DME was 2,900 feet above mean sea level; after reaching the DME, Flight 736 was authorized only to descend to the minimum descent altitude (MDA) of 2,543 feet. However, the aircraft continued to descend below the MDA until it contacted the trees at an altitude 462 feet below the MDA. The NTSB concluded that neither pilot was aware of the aircraft's proximity to the ground until initial contact with trees, at which point the first officer yelled, \\"Pull up.\\" The pilots then attempted to pull up, but one second later the right wing struck a large tree, causing the aircraft to roll over. The investigators focused on determining why the pilots allowed the aircraft to descend below the MDA. Crew fatigue, instrument or autopilot malfunction, and other mechanical issues were all considered and dismissed as unlikely causes. The NTSB concluded that the most likely explanation was that the descent was unintentional and resulted from both pilots looking away from the instruments, having instead focused on making visual contact with the runway. Based on cockpit conversations and weather data, the NTSB also concluded that while light snow and 1-mile visibility was reported to the pilots from the Bradford airport, weather conditions and visibility may have been substantially worse in the final approach area. The NTSB determined the probable cause to be \\"the continuation of the descent from the final approach fix through the Minimum Descent Altitude and into obstructing terrain at a time when both flight crewmembers were looking outside the aircraft in an attempt to establish visual reference to the ground. Contributing factors were the minimal visual references available at night on the approaches to the Bradford Regional Airport; a small but critical navigational error during the later stages of the approach; and a rapid change in visibility conditions that was not known to the crew.\\" ==Aftermath== Less than two weeks after Flight 736 crashed, Allegheny Airlines Flight 737 also went down on approach to Bradford Airport. Both aircraft were approaching the same runway but in opposite directions at the time of the crashes. Shortly after Flight 737's crash, Allegheny Airlines self-imposed new rules for landings at airports. The rules required visibility of 1,000 feet up and three miles out for any airport without instrument landing systems. Allegheny cancelled 124 out of 1,409 scheduled flight segments in the first week after the new visibility rules were adopted. Almost 42 years after the crash, one of its survivors announced she was paying for a plaque for the flight's victims, survivors, and rescuers. ==References *Allegheny Airlines Flight 736 at Airdisaster.com Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in the United States in 1968 Category:Accidents and incidents involving the Convair CV-240 family Category:Airliner accidents and incidents in Pennsylvania Category:Airliner accidents and incidents caused by pilot error Category:Airliner accidents and incidents caused by weather Category:Airliner accidents and incidents involving controlled flight into terrain Category:Allegheny Airlines accidents and incidents Category:1968 in Pennsylvania Category:December 1968 events ","title":"Allegheny Airlines Flight 736"},{"id":"35306670","text":".

Its mountainous terrain facilated the construction of the Hinze Dam () which impounds the Nerang River () and Little Nerang Creek () to create Advancetown Lake (). The lake is the dominant feature in the south of the locality; it supplies water for most of the Gold Coast.Hinze Dam / Advancetown Lake . Seqwater. Retrieved on 3 April 2012. Two named peaks within the locality are: * Mudgeeraba in the south-east of the locality () at above sea level * Pages Pinnacle in the south () at above The northern part of the locality, downstream from the dam, is lower and flatter and has mixed use with rural residential areas and rural areas (mostly grazing on native vegetation). One landmark in this area is Latimers Crossing, a crossing point of the Nerang River between Advancetown and Gilston (). ==History== The mountain Mudgeeraba takes its name from the Bundjalung language words mudherri meaning sticky and ba meaning place, that is, a muddy place. The mountain Pages Pinnacle is named after local land owner Sir Earle Christmas Grafton Page. The area first attracted timber-cutters in the 1870s because of the abundant supply of good quality timber. In 1881 David Yuan established at saw mill and European settlement began. A small settlement sprang up as a rest point for the bullock teams hauling timber to the railway at Nerang. As late as the 1930s, there were still up to 24 bullock teams operating in the area. In 1884 the first hotel was built by W. H. Turner called the Beechmont Hotel. In 1905, Ernest Belliss opened a hotel on the corner of Numinbah Road and a bullock road from Beechmont known as the Black Shoot; he called it the Advancetown Hotel. Belliss also donated land for the Advancetown school, which made the name endure. Belliss sold the hotel in March 1924 and the timber building burned down in July 1933. A new Advancetown Hotel was built and opened in February 1934. Advancetown State School opened in 1909, but then closed in 1913. It reopened in 1918 but had temporary closures in 1921 and 1952. It closed permanently in 1960. Hinze Dam was first completed in 1976 (Stage 1), providing a storage of 42,400 million litres of water to surrounding residents. The dam named after local pioneers Carl and Johanna Hinze (grandparents of Queensland politician Russ Hinze) who lived in the valley that was flooded by the dam. The settlement of Advancetown including the school (which was closed by then) was lost under the dam's waters. As the settlement of Advancetown was gone, on 31 March 1979 the name Advancetown was dropped in favour of Latimer, after nearby Latimer Creek, but the name Advancetown was restored on 11 May 1985. In 1989 Stage 2 of the dam was completed, increasing the storage to 161,070 million litres of water. Advancetown was part of the Shire of Albert until it was amalgamated into the City of Gold Coast in 1995. In 2011 Stage 3 f the dam was completed, increasing the storage to 310,730 million litres of water. It reportedly cost $395 million dollars. At the 2011 Census the population was 352.

Wi√±oy Tripantu is celebrated with a ceremony on the shortest day of the year, during which various families or even various communities may come together to celebrate communally. All members of the community have a participatory role in the ceremony, which may involve songs, dances, a communal meal, and offerings to the land. Typically, a wood fire is lit, which traditionally is kept burning until sunrise the following day. Elders of the family or community tell stories with philosophical, cultural, and political undertones, as a method of transmitting Mapuche culture and history from one generation to the next. The ceremony ends with a communal breakfast. Although Wi√±oy Tripantu has been celebrated in Wallmapu (now southern Argentina and Chile) for centuries, it has seen a particular revival since the late twentieth century, associated with a broader revival of Mapuche cultural practices and land claims. == References == Category:Mapuche culture Category:Winter events in Argentina Category:Winter events in Chile Category:Winter holidays (Southern Hemisphere) ","title":"We Tripantu"},{"id":"35306686","text":"Triodia adriaticus is a species of moth belonging to the family Hepialidae.

Connaughton, 491 U.S. 657 (1989), was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States supplied an additional journalistic behavior that constitutes actual malice as first discussed in New York Times Co. v. Sullivan (1964).. In the case, the Court held that departure from responsible reporting and unreasonable reporting conduct alone were not sufficient to award a public figure damages in a libel case. However, the Court also ruled that if reporters wrote with reckless disregard for the truth, which included ignoring obvious sources for their report, plaintiffs could be awarded compensatory damages on the grounds of actual malice.. ==Background== In November 1983, Daniel Connaughton unsuccessfully ran for the position of Municipal Judge of Hamilton, Ohio, losing to incumbent James Dolan. A local newspaper, the JournalNews, supported the incumbent Dolan. About a month before the election, Dolan's Director of Court Services resigned his position and was subsequently arrested on perjury charges. On November 1, 1983, while a grand jury investigation of the charges was taking place, the JournalNews ran a front page article quoting Alice Thompson, a witness in the trial. Thompson was quoted as saying Connaughton had used \\"dirty tricks\\" and had offered both Thompson and her sister tangible benefits (including employment opportunities and a trip to Florida) \\"in appreciation\\" for Thompson's testimony in the trial. Lower court proceedings Connaughton filed suit against Harte-Hanks Communications, the publisher of the JournalNews, alleging that its article had defamed him. He claimed the article was false, had injured his personal and professional and political reputation and was published on the grounds of actual malice. Harte-Hanks pushed for summary judgment, arguing that even if Thompson's statements were false, the article was protected under the neutral reportage privilege. The District Court denied their motion, saying it could not be proven the article was written with disinterest. The case moved to trial, in which jurors listened to three separate interviews‚Äîtwo by JournalNews reporters and a third by Connaughton. The jury found that the reporting fulfilled three special verdicts for public figure libel: the article was defamatory, the article was false and the article was published with actual malice. The court awarded Connaughton $5,000 in compensatory damages and also $195,000 in punitive damages. Harte-Hanks appealed, again citing the First Amendment defense against libel. The Sixth Circuit affirmed the lower court's decision however, writing that the court's ruling did not encroach upon the First Amendment rights of the publisher, and that the lower court was not incorrect in labeling the article as defamatory and false. ==Opinion of the Court== The Supreme Court decided the case unanimously in favor of Connaughton. Justice Stevens delivered the opinion of the Court, joined by all members of the Court except Justice Scalia, who wrote an opinion concurring in the judgment. Separate concurring opinions were written by Justices White, Blackmun and Kennedy. Justice Stevens began his opinion by referencing New York Times Co. v. Sullivan (1964) and Curtis Publishing Co. v. Butts (1967),. which state that public figures, such as Connaughton, must definitively prove actual malice to be awarded damages in libel suits. He then referenced the case Hustler Magazine v. Falwell (1988), which had occurred the year before, and had ruled that public figures \\"may not recover for the tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress . . . without showing . . . that the publication contains a false statement of fact which was made . . . with knowledge that the statement was false or with reckless disregard as to whether or not it was true.\\". However, citing St. Amant v. Thompson (1968),. Stevens ruled that the reporters had acted with \\"reckless disregard for the truth.\\" Stevens focused on Patsy Stephens, the elder sister of Alice Thompson. Stephens had been present when Connaughton had allegedly played \\"dirty\\" tricks with the sisters, and Thompson reported that Stephens could confirm the accusations against Connaughton. The editor of the JournalNews then instructed his employees to interview every witness to Connaughton and Thompson's conversation‚Äîexcept Patsy Stephens. Every other witness to the exchange denied Stephens' accusations. Justice Stevens wrote that a responsible newspaper would and should corroborate with obvious sources, particularly since Thompson had earlier assured that Stephens could confirm her charges, and Stephens would be the only witness to do so. Justice Stevens also wrote that \\"if the Journal News had serious doubts concerning the truth of Thompson's remarks, but was committed to running the story, there was good reason not to interview Stephens.\\" Additionally, Justice Stevens noted that Jim Blount, editorial director for the JournalNews, had penned an editorial on October 30, two days before the article in question surfaced. This editorial predicted that more information concerning the impropriety and integrity of the candidates might surface in the next few days. Stevens wrote that this can be taken to be mean that the JournalNews had already decided to publish the article on October 30, well before it had verified its sources. Justice Stevens then explains that while public figures can legally endure more defamation than private persons, they are not completely unprotected by the courts, provided they can prove the defendants acted with actual malice. He finished his opinion by stating that, because of the inconsistencies with the JournalNews' reporting, and because they deliberately ignored sources that would have either affirmed or denied Stephens' allegations, the JournalNews was guilty of reckless disregard for the truth and, by extension, actual malice. ==Aftermath== After the case was remanded to the lower court, Connaughton won the retrial, and the Supreme Court affirmed the decision by the Sixth Circuit. ==ReferencesCategory:1989 in United States case law Category:United States defamation case law Category:United States Supreme Court cases Category:United States Supreme Court cases of the Rehnquist Court ","title":"Harte-Hanks Communications, Inc. v.

They remained part of Gauliga competition throughout the course of World War II, but earned only mid-to-lower table results until finishing as vice-champions in the war weakened Gauliga Weser-Ems in 1944.

ASV made two appearances in play for the Tschammer-Pokal, predecessor to the modern day DFB-Pokal (German Cup), going out against Polizei Hamburg in 1939, and against Dresdner SC in the second round in 1940, having beaten Hamburger SV in the first round.

In 1963, the Amateurliga became a third tier circuit with the formation of the new national first division Bundesliga and the two Regionalliga (II). Despite another 4 divisional titles and participation in qualification play for the Regionalliga Nord (II) the team was unable to advance. In 1977, BSV crashed out following a 16th place finish.

Jon's head is cut off and stabbed by a cartoon warlock as he shouts \\"What the fuck!?\\". * * * Cast: Jon Schnepp as Himself, Laya Bella as Warrior - X is for XXL Xavier Gens Gertrude, an overweight woman, wanders the streets of France as people everywhere taunt her size; she is haunted by images of thin, attractive women. She sadly gorges herself on food before deciding to finally do something about her weight. Using a variety of sharp objects, Gertrude proceeds to cut the fat off of her body. She walks out of the bathtub in a skeletal state and missing all her skin; she poses briefly and then bleeds to death. * * * Cast: Sissi Duparc as Gertrude, Sarah Bonrepaux as The Girl, Chems Dahmani as Bad Guy, Rurik Sall√© as Bad Guy, Iv√°n Gonz√°lez as Bobo - Y is for Youngbuck Jason Eisener A pedophilic janitor teaches a young boy he has been watching from afar to hunt deer, and is then implied to sexually assault the boy. The janitor continues to watch all the boys play basketball and then licks up their sweat afterwards. The boy, haunted by his time with the janitor, appears in the gymnasium and kills him with the severed head of a deer. * * * Cast: Tim Dunn as Janitor, Rylan Logan as Kid Note: Features the song \\"Vengeance\\" by the Australian Synthwave duo Power Glove. - Z is for Zetsumetsu (Extinction) Yoshihiro Nishimura A mysterious man named Dr. Strangeluv is shown the \\"positive\\" aspects of American culture and how it relates to Japan. All throughout, imagery of rice and sushi, a topless woman with a Nazi hat and giant penis, and naked people with hats resembling bombs reading \\"Big Boy\\" are unapologetically shown throughout. Strangelv stands up and shouts \\"My Emperor, it is standing!\\" as his penis rises exposed and fires rice. * * * Cast: Seminosuke Murasugi as Dr. Strangeluv, Arata Yamanaka as Government Spokesperson, Hiroaki Murakami as Salaryman 1, Tsuyoshi Kazuno as Salaryman 2, Katsuyuki Miyake as Salaryman 3, Demo Tanaka as Salaryman 4, Kurumi Ochiai as Sazae-San, Je$$ica as Rice Woman, Hiroko Yashiki as Female Detective, Naoko Takahashi as Office Lady, Yoshio Komatsu as Man Shot in Head 1, Sadashi Matsubayashi as Man Shot in Head 2, Atsushi Hiroki as Man Shot in Head 3 } ==Reception== Rotten Tomatoes reports that 37% of critics gave the film a positive review and an average score of 4.8/10 based on 68 reviews. The consensus says the film \\"is wildly uneven, with several legitimately scary entries and a bunch more that miss the mark\\". Nerdist calls it \\"a midnight movie for folks with a sick sense of humour\\". The Austin Chronicle says it \\"soars to such artistic heights, and such tasteless depths, on a global scale, no less, bodes well for the future of cinema fantastique and otherwise\\", while Inside Pulse says the movie has a \\"brilliant concept but not great execution\\". Many reviewers criticized the film shorts' unevenness. Dread Central gave a mixed review for the film, saying the film is \\"full of installments that are more bad than good\\" but that it was an \\"easy watch\\" overall. Film School Rejects gave The ABCs of Death a B rating, praising D is for Dogfight while saying that \\"M is for Miscarriage is almost insulting in its laziness\\". Screen Crush gave an overall positive review, saying that it was \\"a good time at the movies\\". Dave Canfield writing for film magazine Magill's Cinema Annual said of the film: \\"The ABCs of Death is for anyone who loves horror since it is easy to skip through segments that are not to taste. Any viewer should be prepared to laugh pretty hard; feel tense; get grossed out like they would at any halfway decent horror film. But that same viewer now has a chance to find out about some of the best directors working in horror today.\\" == Sheila Kearns case == After showing the film to a group of high school Spanish students, former Ohio substitute teacher Sheila Kearns was found guilty of four counts of disseminating matter harmful to juveniles. As of Thursday, January 16, 2015, Kearns was convicted, and on 5 March 2015, she was sentenced to 90 days in jail and probation for three years. ==References* * * Category:2012 films Category:2012 black comedy films Category:2012 comedy horror films Category:American films Category:American comedy horror films Category:American black comedy films Category:American independent films Category:English-language films Category:Bigfoot films Category:Films based on urban legends Category:American horror anthology films Category:American supernatural horror films Category:American splatter films Category:Films directed by Jason Eisener Category:Films directed by Noboru Iguchi Category:Films directed by Jake West Category:Films directed by Ti West Category:Films directed by Xavier Gens Category:Films directed by Yoshihiro Nishimura Category:Vampires in film Category:American monster movies Category:American serial killer films Category:Films about child sexual abuse ","title":"The ABCs of Death"},{"id":"35306913","text":"This is a list of cinemas that exist or have existed in Metro Manila, Philippines. ==Araneta City Cineplex== { - !CinemaScreensLocationRemarks - Ali Mall Cinemas  4  Araneta City, Cubao, Quezon City  C3: Dolby Digital C4: SDDS - Gateway Cinemas  10 (+9 upon opening of Gateway Mall 2 on 2020)  Araneta City, Cubao, Quezon City  Dolby Digital EX Ultra Sound C5: Dolby Atmos / Large Format C10: Platinum Cinema (Dolby 3D) - } ==Ayala Malls Cinemas== { - !CinemaScreensLocationRemarks - Alabang Town Center  5  G/F New Entertainment Complex, Alabang Town Center, Ayala Alabang,Muntinlupa  C1: THX C2: Dolby Digital C3-5: DTS - Ayala Malls Circuit  4  Circuit Makati, Makati City  C1: A-Luxe Seats / Dolby 7.1 C2: Dolby Atmos C3-C4: Dolby Surround 7.1 - Ayala Malls Cloverleaf  6  Balintawak, Quezon City  Dolby Surround 7.1 C6: VIP - Ayala Malls Feliz  4  Dela Paz, Pasig City  C1: Dolby Atmos C2-C4: Dolby Surround 7.1 - Ayala Malls Manila Bay  10  Aseana City, Para√±aque  C1/3/4/6/9: Dolby Surround 7.1 C2/5/10: Dolby Atmos C7: A-Giant Screen w/ Skybox C8: A-Luxe Seats (DTS) - Ayala Malls South Park  4  Ayala Malls South Park, Alabang, Muntinlupa  Dolby Digital - Ayala Malls The 30th  4  Ayala Malls The 30th, Ortigas Center Pasig  C1,C2,& C4: Dolby Digital C3: Dolby Atmos - Ayala Malls Vertis North  3 North Avenue, Quezon City  C1&3: A-Luxe VIP Seats / Dolby Atmos C2: A-Giant Screen / Skybox VIP and Regular Seating / Dolby Atmos - Bonifacio High Street Central Square  4  Bonifacio Global City Taguig  C1-2: Dolby Atmos C3: Dolby Surround 7.1 C4: 4DX - Fairview Terraces  6  Fairview Terraces, Novaliches Quezon City  Dolby Surround 7.1 - Glorietta 4  7  Glorietta 4, Ayala Center Makati  C1-3: Dolby Digital C4-7: DTS - Greenbelt 1  2  Greenbelt 1 Ayala Center Makati  C1: Dolby Digital C2: SDDS - Greenbelt 3  5  Greenbelt 3 Ayala Center Makati  C1-4: Dolby Digital C4: VIP C5: 3D/4DX - Market!

She was a member of the South Korean co-ed group Coed School and the girl group F-ve Dolls. == Biography == Ryu was born on 22 April 1993 in Gwangju, South Korea.

A year later, she debuted with Coed School. == Career ==  2010‚Äì15: Debut and acting debut  Ryu made her debut as a member of Coed School in 2010. The group debuted on September 30, 2010.

The reports featured a picture of an alleged text conversation between Ryu and Areum, T-ara's member at the time, in which Ryu threatened Areum with comments such as \\"I'll scratch up your face so you can't be on TV\\" and \\"Stupid bitch. Show up in front of me, we'll see what happens.\\" Following this, viewers demanded that Ryu step down from her TV series Golden Pouch. ==DiscographyFilmography== Television series {  - ! Year !

The company laid off all employees and closed its doors in May 2013 after their finances dropped below the minimum condition of a $50 million clean-energy loan awarded by the US Department of Energy in March 2011. AM General reached an agreement with the Department of Energy to acquire the assets of VPG in September 2013, after it had purchased the $50 million DOE loan for $3 million. AM General created Mobility Ventures, a wholly owned subsidiary to again produce and distribute the MV-1 through its dealer network.

It was unveiled at the 2005 International Association of Transportation Regulators (IATR) conference and later that year at the Taxicab, Limousine, and Paratransit Association (TLPA) annual convention in Las Vegas. In mid-2008, it was announced that a contract had been signed with South Bend, Indiana-based AM General to build the Standard Taxi taxicabs, beginning in 2009.Issue 11 at StandardTaxi.com Through market feedback, VPG developed a more advanced and user-friendly vehicle known as the MV-1 to replace the Standard Taxi, which never entered series production.

It was intended to replace the planned Standard Taxi, and like that car it was developed in collaboration with AM General. The first MV-1 rolled off the line in October 2011 and was delivered to disabled former American football player Marc Buoniconti, who was a company spokesperson. Developed from the Standard Taxi, it was a more advanced and user-friendly vehicle than its predecessor. The MV-1 was the first production-made purpose-built vehicle in North America constructed from the ground up for people with disabilities. It seats up to six adults, with two full-size wheelchairs. Chairs are allowed entry via an ADA-approved ramp, able to carry and which stows under the vehicle's floor. The rear doors are 36 inches wide and 56 inches tall, to accommodate bulky wheelchairs. On 21 October 2011 it was announced that New York City's Taxi and Limousine Commission had approved the MV-1 for use as a yellow cab. Because it is handicap accessible, the MV-1 will continue to be approved for taxi use even after the new Nissan NV200 has replaced all other yellow cabs. The MV-1 is the first purpose-built taxicab to be allowed to enter service as a yellow cab since the iconic Checker Marathon.

Board of Chosen Freeholders, 566 U.S. 318 (2012), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that officials may strip- search individuals who have been arrested for any crime before admitting the individuals to jail, even if there is no reason to suspect that the individual is carrying contraband.Supreme Court Ruling Allows Strip Searches for Any Arrest Retrieved April 8, 2012. == Background == Albert W. Florence was riding in a BMW sport-utility vehicle in New Jersey driven by his wife with their three children when she was pulled over for a traffic offense. The officer looked up Florence in the police computer database and discovered an outstanding warrant issued in Essex County. Florence had paid the fine, but the computer erroneously listed an outstanding warrant. Florence was placed under arrest in Burlington County and spent six days in jail before being transferred to Essex County's jail. At both jails, custody officers \\"conducted a visual inspection of his body, instructing him to open his mouth, lift his tongue, lift his arms, and then lift his genitals.\\" Florence went before a judge and was quickly released from jail. Florence filed suit against the two jails under alleging that his Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights had been violated.. Florence, with Counsel of Record Susan Chana Lask, argued that \\"persons arrested for minor offenses cannot be subjected to invasive ... (Fourth Amendment-unreasonable searches) ... searches unless prison officials have ... (Fourteenth Amendment-due process clause) ... reason to suspect concealment of weapons, drugs, or other contraband.\\" A federal judge agreed. On appeal, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the \\"jails' interest in safety and security outweighed the privacy interests of detainees ‚Äì even those accused of minor crimes.\\" The case was subsequently appealed to the United States Supreme Court; the Court granted certiorari on April 4, 2011.Albert W. Florence, Petitioner v. Board of Chosen Freeholders of the County of Burlington, et al. Retrieved April 8, 2012. == Opinion of the Court == In a 5‚Äì4 decision written by Justice Anthony Kennedy, the Court held that officials may strip-search individuals who have been arrested for any crime before admitting the individuals to jail, even if there is no reason to suspect that the individual is carrying contraband. Kennedy was joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Antonin Scalia, Samuel Alito, and Clarence Thomas. Justice Thomas joined all parts of Kennedy's opinion except part IV. In his opinion, Kennedy noted that Timothy McVeigh was stopped by a state trooper after the Oklahoma City federal building bombing for driving without a license plate. And, one of the September 11 hijackers was \\"stopped and ticketed for speeding just two days before hijacking Flight 93,\\" emphasizing the discrepancies that may exist between why an individual is arrested and the kind of threat they pose to society. Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Alito issued separate concurrences. Justice Stephen Breyer dissented, joined by Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan. In the dissent, they argued that empirical evidence on strip-searches suggests there is no convincing reason that, in the absence of reasonable suspicion, involuntary strip-searches of those arrested for minor offenses are necessary. They cited a study conducted in New York under the supervision of federal courts, where out of 23,000 people searched, only one inmate had hidden contraband in his body in a way that would have avoided detection by x-ray and a pat-down. A cited California study found only three instances out of 75,000 inmates strip-searched in a five-year period. == Subsequent developments == The American Civil Liberties Union released a press statement saying that the decision \\"puts the privacy rights of millions of Americans at risk.\\" == See also == * List of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 566 * Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution * Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution * Search and seizure * Strip search == References Further reading== * * Fordham Law Review ==External links== * * Coverage of the case on SCOTUSblog * Coverage of the case on the New Jersey ACLU's site Category:United States Supreme Court cases Category:United States Supreme Court cases of the Roberts Court Category:United States Fourth Amendment case law Category:2012 in United States case law Category:Burlington County, New Jersey Category:Strip search ","title":"Florence v.

The Court held that illegality can only act as a defence where the plaintiff is seeking to profit from illegal conduct or where a tort action is being used to circumvent or negate a criminal penalty. ==Background== The defendant, Jean Hebert, owned a 1968 Pontiac Firebird, and had been drinking with the plaintiff, Vincent Hall. They were out driving when the car stalled on a rough gravel road near steep drop-off. The plaintiff, originally the passenger, asked if he could drive in an attempt to roll start the car. The defendant agreed, aware that he had consumed 11 or 12 bottles of beer that evening. The plaintiff lost control of the car, which left the road down the steep slope and flipped over. The plaintiff suffered severe head injuries as a result. At trial the judge found the defendant liable for negligence but apportioned liability at 75 percent to the defendant and 25 percent to the plaintiff. The central issue on appeal was whether the doctrine ex turpi causa non oritur actio provided a complete defence. ==Opinion of the Court== The majority of the Court held that illegal conduct can bar recovery in tort only limited circumstances.[1993] 2 SCR 159 at 169. The defence only operated when the integrity of the legal system is threatened by the claim, such as in situations where the plaintiff is attempting to profit from his illegal conduct, or when a tort claim is used to circumvent, subvert, or negate a criminal penalty.Ibid at 178. Further, the doctrine of ex turpi causa can only be used as a defence and cannot be used to negate a duty of care, because it would inappropriately place an onus on the plaintiff to show absence of illegal or immoral conduct; the duty of care cannot be selectively applied to heads of damage; and the consideration of illegal or immoral conduct in duty of care would raise procedural problems where there are concurrent claims. In the result, the plaintiff in this case was not seeking to profit from his illegal conduct (drinking and driving), nor was he circumventing the criminal law. However, he was contributorily negligent - therefore the damages were reduced to 50 percent. ==Aftermath== Following this decision, the doctrine of ex turpi causa had a very limited application, and some commentators noted that the decision \\"for all practical purposes, makes the defence of illegality inapplicable to negligence actions.\\"Philip H Osborne, The Law of Torts, 4th ed (Toronto: Irwin Law, 2011). at 117. The Supreme Court revisited the doctrine in British Columbia v. Zastowny,2008 SCC 4 where they applied the decision in Hall to hold that a person is not entitled to compensation for unemployment during a prison sentence, except in circumstances such as a wrongful conviction. This followed from the rationale that such compensation would create a clash between the criminal justice system and civil law, which would compromise the integrity of the legal system. ==References * Category:Canadian tort case law Category:Supreme Court of Canada cases Category:1993 in Canadian case law ","title":"Hall v Hebert"},{"id":"35307235","text":"Macna platychloralis is a species of snout moth in the genus Macna.

Adverse security assessments are findings by the Australian Security and intelligence Organisation that a person who has been found to be a refugee is a security risk. Such people are kept in detention until such time as it is determined that they are no longer security risks. They do not have access to the evidence on which the assessments are made; but in some cases may have some indications of the nature of the accusations. Stone had reviewed 22 of 52 adverse assessments as of June 2014, as a result of which four people have had their adverse assessments removed. By June 2015 Stone finalised a further 24 reviews, finding that five adverse assessments were either flawed or not appropriate.

Langhorne was educated at the Germantown Academy. At the age of 18 he established his home in Duncannon, Pennsylvania where he engaged in the manufacture of iron. He enlisted in the Union Army at the outbreak of war. Langhorne Wister served as a captain in the 13th Pennsylvania Reserve Regiment, fighting at the Battle of Gaines's Mill, where he was wounded. In this role he also fought with distinction at the Battle of Fredericksburg. Later Wister recruited and served as colonel of the 150th Pennsylvania Infantry (\\"Bucktail\\") Regiment. He fought at the Battle of Chancellorsville in I Corps of the Army of the Potomac. Wister assumed command of a brigade on the first day of the Battle of Gettysburg after Colonel Roy Stone was wounded.

A noted critic of the Thai monarchy and government, in June 2011, Marshall resigned from Reuters in controversial circumstances after the news agency refused to publish exclusive stories he was writing on the Thai monarchy. His 2014 book A Kingdom in Crisis was banned in Thailand and a prominent Thai royalist made a formal complaint to police accusing Marshall of several crimes including l√®se majest√©. ==Career== Marshall was a correspondent for Reuters for 17 years, covering political upheaval in Thailand and the conflicts in Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan. In 2000, he was named Reuters' Deputy Bureau Chief in Bangkok. He was Reuters' Baghdad bureau chief from 2003 to 2005 as a violent insurgency gripped Iraq, and was Reuters' managing editor for the Middle East from 2006 to 2008. From 2008 he was based in Singapore as a political risk analyst and emerging markets editor. He left Reuters in June 2011 when the agency refused to publish a set of articles about Thailand's monarchy he authored based on his analysis of leaked US diplomatic cables. ==#thaistory controversy== In June 2011 Marshall announced he had resigned from Reuters to publish a set of stories about Thailand that the news agency had refused to run. Later the same month he published the material himself. Entitled \\"Thailand's Moment of Truth\\", his study analysed the role of the monarchy in Thai politics and included references to hundreds of leaked US diplomatic cables. The cables were also later released by WikiLeaks. Thailand has harsh lese majeste laws that criminalise criticism of the royal family, and journalists covering the country have tended to follow a policy of self-censorship, refraining from any comment on the monarchy that could be deemed critical. Marshall's study, usually referred to by its Twitter hashtag #thaistory, used evidence from the cables to argue the monarchy played a central political role in Thailand which had never been properly reported.Andrew MacGregor Marshall, \\"Thailand's Moment of Truth\\", published 23 June 2011 In an article for the Independent newspaper, Marshall noted that his publication of #thaistory meant he may be imprisoned if he returned to Thailand, and that he understood Reuters' refusal to publish the material given the risks to its staff and business in Thailand if it offended the monarchy.Andrew MacGregor Marshall, \\"Why I decided to jeopardise my career and publish secrets\\", The Independent, 23 June 2011 Reuters gave a different explanation, telling The Times and The Independent that the story didn't \\"work\\" in the format in which it was delivered, that they had questions regarding length, sourcing, objectivity and legal issues, and that Marshall \\"was not participating in the normal editing process.\\"Brian Rex, \\"Monarchy in spotlight: tensions that threaten new turmoil in Thailand\\" , The Independent, 23 June 2011 Marshall's #thaistory generated significant comment and debate. Nicholas Farrelly, a fellow at the Australian National University, wrote that the initial instalments published \\"have quickly become online sensations\\", adding \\"his insights will reverberate in Thai analytical circles for many years to come\\".Nicholas Farrelly, \\"Why criticising the Thai royal family might be bad for your career\\", The Conversation, 6 July 2011 Joshua Kurlantzick, Southeast Asia fellow at the Council of Foreign Relations, said Marshall's work was \\"perhaps the biggest bombshell of reportage on Thailand in decades\\".Joshua Kurlantzick, \\"Bombshell Report on Thailand May Open Debate on Monarchy\\", 27 June 2011 Graeme Dobell of the Lowy Institute for International Policy described #thaistory as \\"journalism of the highest order\\"Graeme Dobell, \\"The danger of a Thai civil war\\", 5 July 2011 and Pavin Chachavalpongpun of the Institute of South East Asian Studies wrote: \\"Marshall has undoubtedly helped push the boundaries much further as one looks at the present state of the Thai monarchy.\\"Pavin Chachavalpongpun, \\"Thailand‚Äôs Yingluck Factor: Can the Lady In Red Lead?\\" , Indonesian Strategic Review, August 2011 Richard Lloyd Parry, Asia editor for The Times newspaper, said #thaistory was \\"a profound study, beyond mere journalism\\".Nicholas Farrelly, \\"Andrew Marshall's Thai Story\\", New Mandala, 23 June 2011 The Thai authorities have a policy of not officially acknowledging the existence of controversial Wikileaks cables, and so did not comment on #thaistory, but Thanong Khanthong, managing editor of the generally pro-establishment Nation newspaper, claimed it was part of an international plot to destabilise Thailand.Thanong Khanthong, \\"More Confrontation is Inevitable\\", The Nation, 1 July 2011 ==Death of King Ananda Mahidol== Marshall has done extensive research into the mysterious shooting of Ananda Mahidol, King Rama VIII of Thailand, on 9 June 1946. He argues that the evidence overwhelmingly suggests Bhumibol Adulyadej killed his brother, probably accidentally, and this was covered up to enable Bhumibol to become king.Andrew MacGregor Marshall, \\"Thailand's Saddest Secret\\", 6 March 2013 == A Kingdom in Crisis == Marshall's book A Kingdom in Crisis was published by Zed Books in October 2014. Reviewing the book for the New Mandala website, Patrick Jory, senior lecturer in Southeast Asian History at the University of Queensland, wrote: \\"Marshall, a former Reuters journalist, has for some years now been the foremost commentator on the taboo subject of the role of the monarchy in Thailand‚Äôs politics...

She was taken to the headquarters of the Crime Suppression Division in Bangkok along with the couple's three-year-old son, and her father.

Melted sugar is carried by a small ladle made by bronze or copper. After it cools, it will be stuck to a bamboo stick and removed using a spatula. Three dimensional objects can be created by laying solidified sugar. ==History== Sugar painting may have originated during the Ming dynasty when aristocratic families or government officials molded small animals made of sugar for religious rituals. This art form then became popular. After that period, as techniques improved, Chinese folk artists combined the molded sugar with other arts, like shadow play and paper cutting, to create a more diverse rang of patterns. In Sichuan, during the Qing dynasty, further developments were made in production seeing the replacement of the molds with the now-common small ladle. Nowadays, sugar painting is considered as a representation of the wisdom and creativeness of Chinese people. To inherit and develop this kind of art and food, the government listed it as Provincial Non-Material Culture Heritage. After the implementation of reform and re-opening policy, many famous sugar painting artists are invited to foreign countries, such as Japan and Spain to exhibit Chinese folk art. ==Technique== An artisan finishes a goldfish figure, attaches the stick, and removes it from the working surface to present it to the customer. The process of sugar painting includes four steps, including boiling down syrup, painting on a plane, sticking to a stick, removing from the plane. If a three dimensional figure is created, layers of pre-made two dimensional sugar painting are used. Although techniques vary, normally the hot sugar is drizzled from a small ladle onto a flat surface, usually white marble or metal. The outline is produced with a relatively thick stream of sugar. Then, supporting strands of thinner sugar are placed to attach to the outline, and fill in the body of the figure. These supporting strands may be produced with swirls, zig-zags, or other patterns. Finally, when completed, a thin wooden stick, used to hold the figure, is attached in two or more places with more sugar. Then, while still warm and pliable, the figure is removed from the surface using a spatula-like tool, and is sold to the waiting customer, or placed on display. In 2012, automatic machines for making sugar paintings started to appear in the market. Once sugar is added, the machine is programmed to paint on a plane in a process similar to automatic engraving. It does not need any art skills or experience, and is easy to operate. There are hundreds of graphics than can be painted using this machine. == Folktale == Some say that it is created by a Chinese writer, Chen Zi'ang (Èô≥Â≠êÊòÇ), during Tang Dynasty. He loved to eat brown sugar, but he liked to eat it in a unique way that he can both appreciate like an artwork and enjoy like sweets. So he melted the sugar and casted the sugar into molds to form its shape. One day, as he was holding the sugar casting on his hand, the prince passed by and saw it. He asked for it and took it away. After he got back, the emperor saw it and thought of it as an interesting invention. He complimented Chen Zi'ang and gives it a name, ‚Äúsugar pancake‚Äù. So it became a snack popular in the court. After he left the palace, he spread this technique in his hometown, located in modern Sichuan province. Because of the emperor's compliment, this form of art and food became popular quickly and developed as the sugar painting nowadays. ==Objects== alt= This snack is popular among children. Customers (especially children) usually select a figure by spinning the arrow on a wheel which will randomly land on popular objects. These objects include animals, like duck, fish, monkey, dog, bird. The subject of painting can be personalized as well. The common objects are usually objects that symbolize fortune or famous characters from Chinese classical novels. For example, artists can paint Chinese mythical creatures, Chinese gods, fictional characters from the Chinese opera (ex. warriors), plants (ex. Flowers), daily objects (ex. bicycles), and fortune symbols (ex. dragon and phoenix). Almost everything can be painted, depending on the skills and creativity of the artists. == Location == Authentic sugar painting can be found in Sichuan province. But since it become more and more popular, it can also be found in Henan, Tianjin, Beijing, and so on. An artist is making and displaying his sugar painting in a People's Park in Jiangxi province, China. ==See also== *Chinese folk art * List of Chinese desserts * List of desserts * *Sugar people ==ReferencesImages * Images * Video Category:Chinese desserts Category:Chinese folk art Category:Candy Category:Articles containing video clips ","title":"Sugar painting"},{"id":"35307636","text":"Matthew or Matt Harrison may refer to: * Matt Harrison (baseball) (born 1985), American baseball player * Matthew Harrison (minister) (born 1962), American Lutheran clergyman * Matthew Harrison (director) (born 1959), American television and film director * Matthew Angelo Harrison (born 1989), American artist ","title":"Matthew Harrison"},{"id":"35307639","text":"The Montreal Process, officially known as the Montreal Process Working Group on Criteria and Indicators for the Conservation and Sustainable Management of Temperate and Boreal Forests, is a voluntary agreement on sustainable forest management. It was formed in Geneva, Switzerland in June 1994 as a result of the Forest Principles developed at the 1992 Earth Summit. == Background == The Montreal Process was formed in June 1994 as a direct response to the Rio Forest Principles, a document that was created at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development suggesting recommendations for sustainable management of forests (The Montreal Process, 2015, p. 8). One of the first orders of business for the Montreal Process Working Group was to create and implement criteria and indicators for the conservation and sustainable management of forests (Montreal Process, 2014, para. 1). In February 1995, countries in the Montreal Process adopted the Santiago Declaration which confirmed their commitment to the conservation and sustainable management of forests. They completed their first order of business by endorsing seven criteria and sixty-seven associated indicators as guidelines for policy makers to refer to in determining national forest trends and advancing toward a more sustainable forest management (The Montreal Process, 2015, p. 8). In 2003, the Montreal Process countries created and published their first country reports which were highlighted in the Montreal Process First Forest Overview Report 2003. They also adopted the Qu√©bec City Declaration in September 2003 which set a vision for the Montreal Process for the timeframe from 2003 until 2008 (The Montreal Process, 2015, p. 8). In November 2007, the member countries revised the first six criteria in Buenos Aires and used these improvements to prepare the second country reports in 2009 once again showing their commitment for the sustainable management of forests (The Montreal Process, 2015, p. 8). In addition to this, they also established the framework for the Montreal Process Strategic Action Plan: 2009-2015 which serves as the overall guiding document for the Montreal Process and helps in efforts of communicating with the international community the Montreal Process's objectives and priorities (The Montreal Process, 2015, p. 9). In 2009, the Montreal Process countries revised the seventh criteria in South Korea and trimmed the criteria and indicators to seven criteria and fifty-four indicators (The Montreal Process, 2015, p. 9). Although there has been many successful initiatives, there is still considerable room for improvement of the country reporting practices. Chandran and Innes, researchers at the Department of Forest Resources Management, University of British Columbia, stated ‚Äúcurrent reporting practices, if not corrected, will create difficulties in communicating progress in sustainable forest management amongst countries‚Äù (Chandran, 2014, p. 103). == Member countries == Becoming a member of the Working Group is completely voluntary and members currently includes countries from both the northern and southern hemisphere that cover a vast array of natural and social conditions (The Montreal Process, 2015, para. 3). Currently there are twelve members of the Montreal Process and those countries are: Argentina, Australia, Canada, Chile, China, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, New Zealand, Russia, United States and Uruguay (The Montreal Process, 2015, p. 5). These member countries account for: (The Montreal Process, 2015, p. 5). *90% of the temperate and boreal forests (as well as areas of tropical forests) *58% of planted forests *49% of the world's forests *49% of the world's roundwood production *31% of the world's population == Criteria and indicators == The main goal of sustainable forest management is to maintain a broad, specified range of forest values for an indefinite period of time. It is extremely difficult to assess progress towards the goal, therefore, criteria and indicators are used to make the mission understandable by simplifying the essential components of sustainable forest management by providing a common understanding, as well as a universal framework for describing each individual country's progress towards sustainability at a national level (The Montreal Process, 2015, para. 4). The member countries of the Montreal Process agreed upon initially seven criteria and sixty-seven associated indicators before trimming it down to seven criteria and fifty-four indicators. The Montreal Process Working Group settled on these criteria and indicators after consulting with various professionals such as forest managers and users, researchers, private industry, technical and policy experts from non-member countries, and the international scientific community (The Montreal Process, 2015, p. 8). The seven criteria the member countries agreed to are: Conservation of biological diversity, Maintenance of productive capacity of forest ecosystems, Maintenance of forest ecosystem health and vitality, Conservation and maintenance of soil and water resources, Maintenance of forest contribution to global carbon cycles, Maintenance and enhancement of long-term multiple socio-economic benefits to meet the needs of societies, Legal, institutional and economic framework for forest conservation and sustainable management. (The Montreal Process, 2015, p. 8) == Strategic action plan == The Montreal Process Strategic Action Plan is the definitive guiding document for the Montreal Process Working Group. It is also an extremely useful tool in communicating the Montreal Process's objectives and priorities to member countries, domestic stakeholders and the international community (The Montreal Process, 2015, p. 9). The Montreal Process Strategic Action Plan: 2009-2015 is based on the five strategic directions: Enhance the relevance of the Montreal Process criteria and indicators for policymakers, practitioners and others; Strengthen member country capacity to monitor, assess and report on forest trends and progress toward sustainable forest management using the Montreal Process criteria and indicators; Enhance collaboration and cooperation with forest related regional and international organizations and instruments and other criteria and indicator processes; Enhance communication on the value of criteria and indicators and the accomplishments of the Montreal Process; Enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of the Montreal Process Working Group and its Technical Advisory Committee and Liaison Office (The Montreal Process, 2015, p. 9). == Impact == The Montreal Process's criteria and indicators is ‚Äúa prima facie example of sectoral capture of a normative process‚Äù that were agreed to remarkably quick for an intergovernmental agreement, unlike what occurred at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development where efforts in creating a legally- binding forest management agreement was met with constant rejection and failure (Gale, 2014, p. 174). The sustainable management of forests idea that emerged from the Montreal Process has been highly influential on future sustainable forest management ideas with many forest agreements that were signed after the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development referencing the criteria and indicator processes from the Montreal Process when referring to sustainable management of forests, including, the Non- Legally Binding Instrument on All Types of Forests agreed in 2007 at the United Nations Forum on Forests (Gale, 2014, p. 171). Some other processes the Montreal Process has influenced is the Helsinki Process, which developed criteria and indicator for European temperate and boreal forests, and the Tarapoto Process, which developed criteria and indicator for countries managing tropical forests in Amazonia (Gale, 2014, p. 174). The Montreal Process has helped member countries in improving their sustainable management of forestry by examining the country's current needs in the present and in the future allowing them to provide economic, social, and environmental benefits for future generations. Countries such as New Zealand have seen a 50% increase in the volume of sustainable harvesting, an increase in the standing volume of plantation forests, and an increased focus on the health and safety of workers in the forestry industry (Montreal Process, 2016, para. 10). ==See also== *Deforestation by country ==References== * Chandran, A., & Innes, J.

Their work depends on use of complex mathematical models implemented in sophisticated IT environments. For instance, a firm that invests its money in funds of investment is thought to have a result that depends on a mix of scientific questions and hazards. Different decisions in how to divide the financial resources into the funds lead to different sets of probabilities of return. Advising the investor about the consequences of each possible decision in the risk-return context is one of the typical roles of a rocket scientist. == Core activities == Although the financial rocket science is found mostly in banks and financial enterprises, this area is emerging in firms with other kinds of core activities. The reasons why firms may have to hire these professionals vary and may be related to the core itself, or to auxiliary areas. An example of the first case is the one of an insurance firm that needs to calculate sets of probabilities of expenses, from probabilities of accident of its customers. The other one is advising about what the need every organization, or even every individual, has for properly deciding what to do with the money. == Goals == The goal of a financial rocket scientist is to survey the high administration of a firm with the most precise scenario possible of the result probabilities in choosing decisions like investing, trading and borrowing. It means that not only how to invest money is a problem to rocket scientists, but also matters like pricing assets, creating new products or managing debts. == Skills == The skills required of a financial rocket scientist are broadly based. These include knowledge of microeconomics, macroeconomics,these two areas differ one from the other in that the former studies the behavior of firms and families from an internal point of view, as the latter deals with a national scope and concepts as inflation and employment pure mathematics, statistics, information technologies and financial market practice. The microeconomics knowledge is necessary because the firm itself is an entity subject to microeconomics laws. Macroeconomics are needed to evaluate the response of groups of entities to a wide range of external factors and influences. Pure mathematics and statistics are required to solve the problems arising from questions submitted to the tech workers. Finally, financial market practice is needed to determine the possible decisions built into the financial models. Also, skill with Information Technology is required to prepare effective data-entry into complex computer systems. Some concepts and tools found in this area are the Pareto optimum, the Value at Risk, and the Monte Carlo simulation. == It's not rocket science == Although this phrase, very often found in sources of every kind, seems to deny the ontological existence of the theme here in approach, it actually means context-dependently that some matter is not difficult to understand in certain level of depth. The term Rocket Science was originally derived from WWII rocket developments by Warner Von Braun and later by the NASA aerospace engineering program in the 1960s with the objective of reaching the moon. It was later coined in 1995 by the child of comedian Davis Mathews == Similar activities == Some professions or activities are similar but not identified with rocket science, and they are lied by common issues and relations mean- goal, these areas are basically the financial engineering and risk analysis, according to some sources. Nonetheless, a second and smaller set of sources found in this research identifies them as a unique matter. == See also == * Computational finance * Mathematical finance * Financial modeling * Securities * Trading * Derivatives * Investment management == References == Category:Mathematical finance Category:Business intelligence ","title":"Rocket science in finance"},{"id":"35307656","text":"Martin Reuben Merritt Wallace (September 29, 1829 - March 6, 1902) was a Union Army officer from October 12, 1861 to November 3, 1864 during the American Civil War.Eicher, John H., and David J.

In recognition of his service, in May 1866, he was nominated for appointment and confirmed to the grade of brevet brigadier general of volunteers, to rank from March 13, 1865.Eicher, 2001, p. 760. ==Biography== Martin R. M. Wallace was born in Urbana, Ohio on September 29, 1829. He was the eighth child (fourth son) born to John Wallace; his brother W. H. L. would go on to become a general. In 1834, the Wallaces moved to LaSalle County, Illinois. Wallace attended public school in the winter and worked on the farm the rest of the year. In 1839, the family moved to Ogle County, Illinois near Mount Morris, where Wallace's father was a trustee of the Rock River Seminary. Wallace attended that institution and, after graduating, decided to pursue law as a profession. He studied with elder brother W. H. L. Wallace at Dickey & Wallace in Ottawa, Illinois. Wallace was admitted to the bar in 1858 and moved to Chicago, Illinois to form a practice with Thomas Dent. Upon the outbreak of the Civil War, Wallace helped to organize the 4th Regiment Illinois Volunteer Cavalry. He received a commission of major for the regiment on October 12, 1861. He served under former law associate Colonel Theophilus Lyle Dickey. He led a battalion at the battles of Fort Henry, Fort Donelson, and Shiloh. At the latter engagement, Wallace's brother W. H. L. Wallace was killed. Martin R. M. Wallace assumed control of the 4th Illinois Cavalry Regiment following the death of Colonel William McCullough in December 1862. Wallace was promoted to lieutenant colonel on January 5, 1863, and to a full colonel on June 3, 1863. Wallace was mustered out of the volunteers on November 3, 1864. On May 4, 1866, President Andrew Johnson nominated Wallace for appointment to the grade of brevet brigadier general of volunteers (an honorary commission in recognition of his service in view of the fact he was no longer an army officer), to rank from March 13, 1865, and the United States Senate confirmed the appointment on May 16, 1866. After the war, Wallace was named United States Assessor for the Chicago District. In 1868, he was elected to the Cook County Court, serving for eight years. In 1889 he was appointed by Gov. Joseph Fifer to serve as Justice of the Peace for South Chicago. He also served as an attorney on the Cook County board. Wallace's wife Emma achieved some note as a philanthropist. Martin R. M. Wallace died on March 6, 1902 at Chicago, Illinois and was interred in Rosehill Cemetery. ==ReferencesSee also== *List of American Civil War brevet generals (Union) Category:1829 births Category:1902 deaths Category:Union Army colonels Category:People from Urbana, Ohio Category:People from Mount Morris, Illinois Category:Military personnel from Ohio Category:Military personnel from Illinois Category:Burials at Rosehill Cemetery ","title":"Martin R.

C. was applied retroactively to Panagis Vartelas and was thus unconstitutional.. == Background == In the early 1990s, Panagis Vartelas, a Greek immigrant to the United States, got involved with counterfeiting traveler's cheques.http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/publications/supreme_court_preview/briefs/10-1211_petitioner.authcheckdam.pdf Vartelas pleaded guilty in 1994 to \\"conspiracy to make or possess a counterfeit security.\\" In January 2003, Vartelas took a one-week trip to Greece. While returning through John F. Kennedy Airport, an immigration officer questioned Vartelas about his 1994 conviction. In March 2003, Vartelas was served a notice to appear for removal proceedings \\"because he had been convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude in 1994.\\" Vartelas appeared before an immigration judge in a series of hearings. In 2006, an immigration judge denied Vartelas' application for waiver and ordered Vartelas removed to Greece. Vartelas made a timely appeal to the Board of Immigration Appeals, which the board dismissed. Vartelas subsequently filed a motion to reopen with the Board of Immigration Appeals. The motion to reopen \\"claimed that Vartelas' prior counsel was ineffective having failed to raise the issue of whether 8 U.S.C. ¬ß 1101(a)(13)(C)(v) could be applied retroactively.\\" The Board of Immigration Appeals denied the motion to reopen; Vartelas filed a petition for review with the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. The Second Circuit denied the petition for review; Vartelas appealed the Second Circuit's decision to the United States Supreme Court. == Opinion of the Court == In a 6‚Äì3 opinion written by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the Court held that the enforcement of a provision of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 was improperly applied retroactively to Panagis Vartelas. Normally, laws are presumed to apply prospectively only. Absent clear evidence of a congressional intent that the law operate retroactively, it was error to do so Justice Ginsburg's opinion was joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Anthony Kennedy, Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan. Justice Antonin Scalia wrote a dissenting opinion in which he stated that \\"we should concern ourselves with the statute's actual operation on regulated parties, not with retroactivity as an abstract concept or as a substitute for fairness concerns.\\" He was joined in his opinion by Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito. Scalia held that the law was not applied retroactively under a \\"commonsense approach\\" to the statute and therefore this was a \\"relatively easy case.\\" == See also == * List of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 566 == References  Further reading == * == External links == * * Coverage of the case on SCOTUSblog Category:United States Supreme Court cases Category:United States immigration and naturalization case law Category:2012 in United States case law Category:United States Supreme Court cases of the Roberts Court Category:Greece‚ÄìUnited States relations ","title":"Vartelas v.

Dawsonia, along with other members of the order Polytrichales, are taller than most mosses and have thicker leaves. Their sporophytes have conducting systems analogous to those of vascular plants. Dawsonia superba is found in New Zealand, Australia and New Guinea. D. longifolia is found in the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Australia. There is uncertainty as to whether D. superba and D. longifolia are actually distinct species. == Etymology == Dawsonia was named in honor of Dawson Turner (1775‚Äì1858), distinguished cryptogamist and friend of Robert Brown, who named the genus in 1811. == Description ==  Height  Moss gametophytes lack internal transport tissues, which, coupled with the absence of cuticles, leads to the water-loss characteristic of bryophytes. As bryophytes can only grow when hydrated, the lack of conducting tissue restricts most mosses, even in relatively wet habitats, to a low stature. However, Dawsonia (along with other genera in the Polytrichales order) reaches heights comparable to those of vascular plants. Polytrichales are acrocarpous mosses ‚Äì they have vertical stems with terminal reproductive structures, with the sporophyte growing vertically (along the same axis as the gametophyte stem). The tallest moss in the world is D. superba, which can have a stem up to tall.  Leaves  The leaves of Polytrichum and Dawsonia (and related moss) differ from those of most mosses, which are only one or two cells thick. The Polytrichaceae have lamellae ‚Äì upright sheets of small, photosynthetic cells on the upper surface of the leaves with a function analogous to the mesophyll cells of vascular plant leaves. They increase the surface area of cell walls available for CO2 uptake, while at the same time maintaining layers of moist air between lamellae, reducing water loss. Lamella margins have a surface wax layer which prevents water from flooding into the interlamellar spaces.  Stems  Section of a Dawsonia stem. The cylinder of hydrome can be seen in the centre, and a ring of leaf traces can be seen outside the cylinder The stems of Polytrichales have conducting systems which are analogous to the xylem and phloem of vascular plants. The water-conducting tissue is the hydrome, made up of elongated cells known as hydroids. Unlike the xylem of vascular plants, there is no secondary thickening of cell walls, as bryophytes lack lignin. The phloem analogue in Polytrichales is the leptome, made up of leptoids, they are similar to sieve cells. Hydrome and leptome are well-developed in Polytrichales, and also appear in a number of other bryophytes. == References == * * == External links == * Interactive, virtual slide cross-section of Dawsonia Category:Polytrichaceae Category:Moss genera ","title":"Dawsonia (plant)"},{"id":"35307769","text":"Robert Lindstedt and Horia TecƒÉu are the two times defending champions, but this year they decided not to participate.

The word \\"medium\\" refers to the physical storage layer, the medium on which the data is stored; as opposed to errors related to e.g. protocol, device/controller/driver state, etc. Medium errors are most commonly detected by checking the read data against a checksum ‚Äì itself being most commonly also stored on the same device. The mismatch of data to its supposed checksum is assumed to be caused by the data being corrupted. Locations of medium errors can be either temporary (as in the case of bit rot ‚Äì there is no damage to the medium, the data was simply lost), or permanent (as in the case of scratching ‚Äì the physical location is unusable from that point onwards). Devices can sometimes recover from medium errors, either by retrying or by managing to reconcile the data with the checksum. If the medium has incurred permanent damage, the device might remap the logical address where the error occurred to a different, undamaged physical location. Medium errors are often associated with long latency for the IOs. This is due to the device retrying and attempting to recover from the error. ==Examples of conditions that might cause medium errors== * The head executed a Read request while being improperly aligned, causing it to read data from a wrong physical position. * Previous operation of the disk harmed the medium in some manner (e.g. scratched it), corrupting data in the location that is now discovered as problematic. * External conditions (e.g. dust particles) physically harmed the medium, or caused the head to harm the medium. * A previous Write on a nearby physical location caused the head to corrupt bits in the read location (imprecision in the physical write location).

It was released on his 2012 mixtape Rich Forever. The track was released as a digital download from iTunes on April 17, 2012.

On \\"Sweet\\", the lines \\"Y'all niggas man, y'all soft motherfuckers/Singing all around me man, la la la/ You ain't motherfucking Frank Sinatra/Uh, lil' bitch./Sweet ass motherfucker.\\" are the reason why \\"Stay Schemin'\\" is directed at Common. Later, Common's album debuted at number 18 on the Billboard 200 and sold 69,000 copies in its first week, his lowest first week sales since his 2002 album Electric Circus. Common responded to \\"Stay Schemin'\\" with a remix that featured the original verses from Rick Ross and Drake as well as a new verse from Common. Common called out Drake by name on the track, calling him among other things \\"Canada Dry.\\" Common ended the song with \\"Say My Name,\\" a song originally sung by Destiny's Child that Drake has sung live previously as a way to coax Drake into using Common's name in his diss tracks.

Di Nicola's approach to working with families across cultures brought together a new synthesis of family therapy and transcultural psychiatry.DiNicola, Vincenzo. The strange and the familiar: Cross‚Äëcultural encounters among families, therapists, and consultants. In M Andolfi & R Haber (Eds), Please Help Me With This Family: Using Consultants as Resources in Family Therapy. New York: Brunner/Mazel, 1994, pp. 33‚Äë52. Critical reviews were positive and encouraging by leaders in family therapy, such as Mara Selvini Palazzoli and Celia Jaes Falicov, as well as those in transcultural psychiatry, such as Armando Favazza. This preliminary work was collected and integrated into his model of cultural family therapy in A Stranger in the Family in 1997. ==Outline of the book==  Introduction  Cultural family therapy (CFT) is a synthesis of family therapy and transcultural psychiatry. CFT is an interweaving of \\"stories\\" (family predicaments expressed in narratives of family life) and \\"tools\\" (clinical methods for working with and making sense of these stories in cultural context). By interweaving stories and tools, CFT is aimed at understanding and change. Neither one alone suffices, as each of them produces only part of the solution. The book recounts over two dozen family \\"stories\\" varying from brief vignettes and cameo portraits to longer, more detailed multigenerational narratives. Nine \\"conceptual tools\\" for CFT are described. \\"Tools\\" refers to the actions and thoughts of therapists, part of their toolkit. Some are actions (like \\"spirals\\"), others are like lenses (such as \\"masks\\"). The book is divided into three parts, each with an overarching theme.  Part I: Meeting strangers  Chapter 1. The strange and the familiar: intercultural encounters among families, therapists, and consultants An overture, sounding the main themes: intercultural consulting is introduced, stories of families moving across cultures, issues of translation. \\"Spirals\\", the first conceptual tool of CFT is introduced, describing a way of meeting strangers through negotiation and collaboration, integrating the work of Mara Selvini Palazzoli's Milan systemic family therapy and Michael White's narrative therapy. Chapter 2: Cultural family therapy: a new synthesis Outlines a synthesis of family therapy with transcultural psychiatry, critiquing family therapy's use of culture. The need for multiple descriptions of predicaments; two basic therapeutic temperaments (technocratic and phenomenological); and problems with family therapy across cultures. \\"Paradigm\\" and \\"syntagm\\" are contrasted, the latter calling for a fresh approach, seeing each family as a unique culture. Chapter 3: The presenting culture: a context for family therapy An update of the synthesis, reframing the presenting issue in therapy as the \\"presenting culture\\" as opposed to the \\"presenting problem\\". The second conceptual tool of CFT is \\"masks\\" or cultural costume and camouflage, inspired by the work of family therapist Edwin Friedman. The third conceptual tool of CFT is about \\"roles\\" of insiders and outsider, describing how the therapist positions in relation to the family.  Part II: On the threshold: language, identity, and cultural change  Chapter 4: Beyond Babel: cultural and therapeutic translation This chapter examines language and translation in culture and therapy, inspired by the seminal work on translation by George Steiner in After Babel. Translation across cultures is reviewed in light of the work of British cultural anthropologist Mary Douglas' essay, \\"Self-evidence\\" in Implicit Meanings. \\"Codes\\" is the fourth conceptual tool of CFT. Cultural and therapeutic translation are illustrated with clinical vignettes. Chapter 5: Changelings: children and families in cultural transition Examines identity and cultural change. The \\"presenting culture\\" is the royal road for understanding \\"mind\\", \\"self\\", and \\"identity\\". Changelings‚Äîchildren and families undergoing cultural change‚Äîare explored through five stories of migrant children. \\"Cultural strategies\\" is the fifth conceptual tool of CFT, exploring adaptation and acculturation. Chapter 6: Threshold therapy: liminal people and transitional states Calls for the study of liminal people and transitional states, inspired by the work of British cultural anthropologist Victor Turner. The relationship between culture and mental illness is reviewed and culture-change syndromes are defined and illustrated with clinical vignettes of children with selective mutism. CFT is described as threshold therapy with liminal people. Chapter 7: Stones and bridges: the myth of independence Examines \\"the myth of independence\\" as a theme in Western psychological theories and therapies. Two aspects are examined: (1) how independence is enshrined as a goal in Western family therapy, (2) how this differs in India and Japan. Chapter 8: Stones without bridges: four orphan cases Four \\"orphan cases\\" are presented. Cut off from a more complete relationship to her family and society, each of these women suffered in a unique way. This illustrates the implications of the myth of independence and identifies the sixth conceptual tool of CFT‚Äî\\"bridges\\"‚Äîor understanding the family life cycle in cultural context.  Part III: Families as storying cultures  Chapter 9: The garden of forking paths: exploring a family's alternities of being Explores the use of CFT's conceptual tools in family narratives. \\"Stories\\" is the seventh conceptual tool of CFT‚Äîa family's evolving narrative and therapy itself as \\"the garden of forking paths\\", a metaphor from a short story by Jorge Luis Borges, meaning a series of choices. This year-long story of the course of family's therapy demonstrates all the tools presented so far in the book‚Äîspirals of negotiation, cultural translation, and playing with roles, masks, cultural strategies, and bridges. Chapter 10: The web of meaning: metaphor and the transformation of experience Metaphor and its power to transform experience is the subject of this chapter. Metaphor opens the \\"web of meaning\\" of other lives. Working with a Portuguese immigrant family illustrates the potential for narrative transformation, the eighth conceptual tool of CFT‚Äî\\"multiple codes\\"‚Äîmultiple messages encoded in metaphor (figurative language) and somatics (embodied meaning). Chapter 11: Strangers no more: a family therapist meets his father Concludes with the author's own family story, with several layers: his journey to meet his father in Brazil, how to stitch fragments and outtakes into a coherent whole, and reflections on the nature of therapy. If family predicaments are \\"stories gone awry\\", as narrative therapy sees it, then \\"suturing\\"‚Äîthe ninth and final conceptual tool offers CFT as \\"story repair\\". ==Reception== A Stranger in the Family was well-received as an important contribution to working with immigrant families. Following this positive reception of Di Nicola's work on cultural family therapy, a Brazilian edition in Portuguese translation, Um Estranho na Fam√≠lia: Cultura, Fam√≠lias e Terapia appeared in 1998. Di Nicola continued to elaborate his model of cultural family therapy in articles, chapters, a follow-up volume, Letters to a Young Therapist: Relational Practices for the Coming Community, as well as invitations to present the 4th Annual Stokes Endowment Lecture in family studies at The George Washington University and a thirty-year perspective on his model presented at McGill University where he first developed it and the Accademia di Psicoterapia della Famiglia in Rome, Italy where Di Nicola's model is taught. ==See also== * Cross-cultural psychology * Cross-cultural studies * History of the family * Sociology of the family ==References== Category:1997 non-fiction books Category:Family therapy Category:Child and adolescent psychiatry Category:Social psychology Category:English-language books Category:Clinical psychology ","title":"A Stranger in the Family"},{"id":"35307851","text":"Red Banks is the former name of an unincorporated area in Shenandoah County, Virginia, United States.

It is the third film adaptation (the others were in 1976 and 2002) of Stephen King's 1974 novel of the same name and the fourth film in the Carrie franchise. The film was produced by Kevin Misher, with a screenplay by Lawrence D. Cohen and Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa. The film stars Chlo√´ Grace Moretz as the titular character Carrie White, alongside Julianne Moore as Margaret White. The cast also features Judy Greer, Portia Doubleday, Gabriella Wilde, Ansel Elgort and Alex Russell. The film is a modern re-imagining of King's novel about a shy girl outcast by her peers and sheltered by her deeply religious mother, who uses her telekinetic powers with devastating effect after being a victim of a cruel prank at her senior prom. The film held its world premiere at the Arclight Hollywood in Los Angeles on October 7, 2013 and was released in the United States by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Screen Gems on October 18, 2013. The film received mixed reviews, with critics calling it \\"unnecessary\\", criticizing the lack of originality and scares, though they praised the modern updates and cast. The film grossed $85 million worldwide at the box office. ==Plot== Margaret White, a disturbed religious fanatic, sits alone in her home on her bed and gives birth to a baby girl. She intends to kill the infant but changes her mind. Years later, her daughter Carrie, a shy, unassertive girl, nears her graduation from Ewen High School in Maine. While showering after the gym at school, Carrie experiences her first menstrual period. Never having been taught to prepare for this, she believes she is bleeding to death and runs out of the shower yelling for help. The other girls ridicule her by throwing tampons and pads at her. Longtime bully Christine \\"Chris\\" Hargensen records everything on her smartphone and uploads it to YouTube. Miss Rita Desjardin, the gym teacher, comforts Carrie and sends her home with Margaret, who believes menstruation is a sin. Margaret demands that Carrie abstain from showering with the others. When Carrie refuses, Margaret hits her in the forehead with a Bible and locks her in her \\"prayer closet.\\" As Carrie screams to be let out, a crack appears on the door, and the crucifix in the closet begins to bleed. Carrie begins to experience more signs over the oncoming days that point to her having telekinesis. She researches her abilities, learning to harness them. Miss Desjardin informs the girls who teased Carrie that they are given a choice to either endure boot-camp-style detention for their behavior or be suspended from school, prohibiting them from attending prom; Chris is the only one who refuses to take part in detention and is suspended from school after denying the allegation and refusing to give up her smartphone. Sue Snell regrets her part in the incident. To make amends, she asks her boyfriend, Tommy Ross, to take Carrie to the prom. Carrie accepts Tommy's invitation and makes a prom dress at home. Her mother, Margaret, forbids Carrie to attend. Asking her mother to relent, Carrie manifests her telekinesis. Margaret believes this power comes from the Devil and is proof that Carrie has been corrupted by sin. Meanwhile, Chris, her boyfriend Billy Nolan, and his friends plan revenge on Carrie; they obtain pig blood to put in a bucket. On Prom Night, Margaret tries to prevent Carrie from going, but Carrie uses her powers to lock her mother in the closet. At the prom, Carrie is nervous and shy, but Tommy kindly puts her at ease. As part of Chris and Billy's plan, Chris' friend, Tina Blake, discreetly slips fake ballots into the voting box, which names Carrie and Tommy as prom queen and king. At home, Sue receives a text from Chris, taunting her about her scheme to humiliate Carrie. Sue drives to the prom, arriving just as Carrie and Tommy are about to be crowned. Billy warns Chris not to tell anyone about the bucket as it is criminal assault; Chris agrees to say nothing. Sue sees the bucket of blood dangling above Carrie and attempts to warn someone. Desjardin locks her out of the gym, suspecting that Sue plans to hurt Carrie. Chris dumps the blood onto Carrie and Tommy. Nicki plays the \\"shower video\\" of Carrie on the large screens above the stage, inciting laughter from some in the audience. Carrie pushes Miss Desjardin with her powers when Desjardin attempts to help her. The bucket falls onto Tommy's head, killing him. Enraged, Carrie takes her revenge and uses her telekinesis to kill nearly every student and staff, but spares Desjardin. An electrical wire merges with leaking water, and a fire breaks out. As the school burns to the ground, Carrie walks away, leaving behind a trail of destruction. Chris and Billy attempt to drive away, but Carrie crashes the car, killing Billy. Chris attempts to run Carrie over, but Carrie lifts the car and throws it at a gas station, killing her. Carrie tips over an electric power pole, setting the car on fire. Carrie arrives home and takes a bath and changes into her nightgown afterward. Carrie tearfully tells Margaret about the prank. Carrie and Margaret embrace and Margaret recounts Carrie's conception. After having shared a bed platonically with her husband, they yielded to temptation one night, and, after praying for strength, Carrie's father \\"took\\" Margaret, who enjoyed the experience. After the talk, Margaret stabs Carrie in the back with a knife. She declares that she must kill Carrie in order to prevent the Devil from possessing her again and attacks Carrie, but Carrie kills her with several sharp tools. She becomes hysterical and makes stones rain from the sky to crush the house. When Sue arrives, a furious Carrie lifts her with her powers but senses that Sue is pregnant with a baby girl. Carrie protects Sue and throws her out of the house to safety as the house collapses and sinks, apparently killing Carrie as well. After giving her testimony in court regarding the prom incident, Sue visits Carrie and Margaret's grave, which has been vandalized to read \\"CARRIE WHITE BURNS IN HELL,\\" and places white roses by the headstone. As she leaves, the gravestone begins to break, and Carrie's enraged scream is heard. ==Cast== * Chlo√´ Grace Moretz as Carrie White * Julianne Moore as Margaret White * Judy Greer as Miss Desjardin * Portia Doubleday as Chris Hargensen * Alex Russell as Billy Nolan * Gabriella Wilde as Sue Snell * Ansel Elgort as Tommy Ross * Barry Shabaka Henley as Principal Henry Morton * Zo√´ Belkin as Tina Blake * Karissa Strain as Nicki Watson * Katie Strain as Lizzy Watson * Samantha Weinstein as Heather Mason * Demetrius Joyette as George Dawson * Mouna Traor√© as Erika Langton ==Production== In May 2011, representatives from MGM and Screen Gems announced that the two companies were producing a film remake of Carrie. The two studios hired Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark playwright Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa to write a screenplay that delivers \\"a more faithful adaption\\" of King's novel‚ÄîAguirre- Sacasa previously adapted King's work The Stand into a comic book in 2008. Reshoots were ordered, as the screenplay was re-written by Lawrence D. Cohen, who also wrote the original film. Upon hearing of the new adaptation, King remarked, \\"The real question is why, when the original was so good?\\" He also suggested Lindsay Lohan for the main role and stated that \\"it [the film] would certainly be fun to cast\\". Actress Sissy Spacek, who played Carrie in the 1976 adaptation, expressed an opinion on the choice of Lohan for the character of Carrie White, stating that she \\"was like, 'Oh my God, she's really a beautiful girl' and so I was very flattered that they were casting someone to look like me instead of the real Carrie described in the book. It's gonna be real interesting.\\" In March 2012, the role of Carrie White was offered to Chlo√´ Grace Moretz, who accepted the role.\\"Chloe Grace Moretz celebrates 16th birthday with star-studded bash\\" . WMAR-TV-ABC News. Kimberly Peirce directed the film, while Moore starred as Margaret White and Gabriella Wilde played Sue Snell. Alex Russell and Ansel Elgort were cast in key roles, and Judy Greer played the gym teacher Miss Desjardin. Principal photography began on June 27, 2012 and wrapped on August of that same year. ==Release== The original release date was March 15, 2013, but in early January 2013 the release date was moved to October 18, 2013. Sony held a \\"First Look\\" event at the New York Comic Con on October 13, 2013 that allowed attendees to view the film prior to the release date. The event was followed by a panel session with several members of the cast and crew. Trailers for the film included a phone number that offered promotions to the caller, as well as a recording of a simulated encounter with characters from the film.Barton, Steve (October 15, 2012). \\"Carrie called. Messages left. Listen now.\\" Dread Central. Retrieved April 6, 2013. Home video The film was released on DVD and Blu-ray on January 14, 2014. The Blu-ray features an alternative opening and ending and nine deleted scenes. In the alternative opening, a young Carrie has a discussion with her teenage neighbor, who is sun-bathing, over the fact that Margaret believes that women with breasts are sinful. Margaret catches them in the conversation and believes that the neighbor is offending Carrie, not before the neighbor's mother disagrees with her. Suddenly, stones begin to rain only on the White household. Margaret, believing it is a sign from God, takes shelter inside her home with a distressed Carrie. In the alternative ending, the cracking gravestone and the court speech are not present. After placing the roses on Carrie's grave, Sue suddenly feels pain from her pregnancy and begins to go into labor. Sue is in the hospital and is preparing to give birth to her baby. As she struggles to give birth, Carrie's bloody hand suddenly emerges and grabs Sue's arm. Sue screams loudly as she wakes up in her own bedroom, with her mother comforting her and telling her that her nightmare is over. A subliminal frame image of Carrie soaked in pig's blood is seen carrying Sue's baby as Sue continues to scream in her room. ==Reception== Critical reception The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 50% approval rating with an average rating of 5.49/10 based on 180 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"It boasts a talented cast, but Kimberly Peirce's 'reimagining' of Brian De Palma's horror classic finds little new in the Stephen King novel -- and feels woefully unnecessary.\\" On Metacritic, it scored a 53 out of 100 based on 34 reviews, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews.\\" Kevin C. Johnson of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch gave the film a favorable review, saying, \\"Long before the blood starts spilling, it's clear the new team has mostly nailed it. The reboot is as good a Carrie remake as possible, though it's not truly a scary movie; the film takes its time living up to its R rating.\\" Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle also gave the film a favorable review, remarking: \\"In a way, the new Carrie is almost too easy to enjoy. Everything discordant and all the nagging weirdness and strange feelings surrounding the original have been smoothed down, and what we're left with is a well-made, highly satisfying and not particularly deep high school revenge movie.\\" Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune gave the film a positive review, stating: \\"The acting's strong; in addition to Moretz and Moore, Judy Greer is a welcome presence in the Betty Buckley role of the sympathetic gym instructor. But something's missing from this well-made venture. What's there is more than respectable, while staying this side of surprising.\\" Joe Neumaier of the New York Daily News gave it three out of five stars, saying, \\"With the exception of some appearances by social media, 'Carrie' doesn't try to hip up King's basic, often slow story. And while De Palma's version is fondly recalled as a high-blood-mark of the 1970s, this new take seems to linger a bit more on the bugaboos of overparenting and bullying while underplaying Mama's fanaticism. Peirce only glancingly lets her heroine have a mild discovery-of-powers moment that feels 'X-Men'-ish.\\" In a positive review on Roger Ebert's website, Matt Zoller Seitz awarded the film three out of four stars, praising the portrayal of Carrie and Margaret's relationship and the feelings of sympathy Carrie manages to evoke, although he criticizes the representation of Chris as \\"exaggeratedly evil\\". Seitz ultimately concludes by stating: \\"The first Carrie was horror. This is tragedy.\\" A. A. Dowd of The A.V. Club gave the film a C- rating, criticizing Moretz's Carrie as \\"too adjusted, coming across less like the 'very peculiar girl' King described in his novel and more like the stealth babe of some nottie-to-hottie teen romance.\\" Dowd lamented on the film as a whole, \\"It's a strange thing to say about a movie so obsessed with the red stuff, but this Carrie is bloodless.\\" Box office Sony estimated the revenue for the opening weekend of Carrie as between $16 million and $18 million, while others estimated a bigger margin of $24 million to $28 million due to the Halloween season. However, the final takings totaled $16,101,552 and the film was ranked at number 3 behind Gravity and Captain Philips, both of which were in their second and third weeks, respectively. By the end of the week, the film managed to gross $20,121,355. In week two, the film slipped 62.8% to sixth place with $5,900,000 and 43.2% to ninth place in its third week with $3,400,000. At the end of its run, the film has grossed $35,266,619 in North America and $49,524,059 in other countries for a worldwide gross of $84,790,678. It is the 67th highest-grossing film of 2013 in the United States. Accolades {  style=\\"width:100%;\\" - ! Year ! Award ! Category ! Recipient(s) !

He was known as El Gran Tendilla, and was a Spanish noble of the House of Mendoza. He was the son of √ç√±igo L√≥pez de Mendoza y Figueroa, the first Conde de Tendilla, and the grandson of the poet √ç√±igo L√≥pez de Mendoza, 1st Marquis of Santillana. == Early life == √ç√±igo was born in Guadalajara, Kingdom of Castile, and was educated along with his brother, Diego Hurtado de Mendoza y Qui√±ones (who would later become a cardinal), in the palatial house of his grandfather. He would also receive instruction in political and military matters from his father, the ambassador to Pope Pius II in the council of Mantua and from his uncle, the powerful cardinal Pedro Gonz√°lez de Mendoza. == Biography == Coat of arms of the House of Mendoza. Succeeding his father in 1479 as Conde de Tendilla, he entered the Royal Court at Toledo in 1480 to show his loyalty to the Catholic Monarchs and offered his services for the ongoing conquest of Granada. It was in the Granada War that he first showed his military prowess. His nephew, Rodrigo D√≠az de Vivar y Mendoza, the son of Cardinal Pedro Gonz√°lez de Mendoza, who educated √ç√±igo, served under him during this time. He was there named Alcaide de Alhama de Granada and was made, at his own expense, to defend those lands against the armies of Muley Hac√©n from 1484‚Äì85. In 1486, the Catholic Monarchs named √ç√±igo ambassador to Pope Innocent VIII. During his tenure, he accomplished a very ambitious agenda which included: pushing for a peace treaty between the Pope and the Kingdom of Naples, renewing the Papal Bull favoring the Crusade of 1482, reforming the church, and giving the power to appoint Bishops to the King. He was also able to get the pope to recognize the illegitimate children of his uncle, the cardinal Pedro Gonz√°lez de Mendoza. Pope Innocent VIII gifted the Conde with a sword which can still be seen on display today at the Museum of L√°zaro Galdiano in Madrid. While in Rome, Conde √ç√±igo befriended the humanist Peter Martyr d'Anghiera, with whom he would have a lifelong friendship, bringing him to Spain as a tutor for his children. In August 1487, he returned to military campaigning, this time against the Nazar√≠ Kingdom of Granada after being named the High Adelantado of Andaluc√≠a. He fought in many actions here under the command of Gonzalo Fern√°ndez de C√≥rdoba. After the defeat of Boabdil and conquest of Granada in winter of 1492, King Ferdinand named √ç√±igo Governor of Alhambra and Captain General of Granada. During his tenure as governor, Conde √ç√±igo subdued the first Moorish uprising in Granada (1500‚Äì1502), which was brought about by the forced mass conversions enacted by Cardinal Francisco Jim√©nez de Cisneros. He later would command troops against further uprisings in Alpujarras along with King Ferdinand and the \\"Gran Capitan\\", Gonzalo Fern√°ndez de C√≥rdoba. After the death of Isabella I of Castile in 1504, √ç√±igo was one of the only nobles, along with the future Duke of Alba who controlled Castile, who remained faithful to King Ferdinand. Infighting against the supporters of Philip I of Castile broke out. Conde √ç√±igo also fell out of favor with his cousin Rodrigo D√≠az de Vivar y Mendoza, the Marquesado del Venete and with the \\"Gran Capitan\\".

The defining characteristics of these Classifiers were defined by elements whose levels within the cells created markers that could be measured. High markers and low markers were established and a ‚Äúclassifier molecule‚Äù was created to insert into prospective cells, and would induce apoptosis only when cells exhibit the threshold level of High or Low markers. These classifiers would use a small interfering RNA which targeted the repressor and activator in the Lac operon.

In vitro applications are possible provided the classifier molecule can be safely integrated into cultured cells. == Cancer cell identification and classification == Cancer cells can be classified by identifying the MicroRNA expression. These mRNA expression levels can be used as a diagnostic and prognostic tool in tumor and cancer classifications, although current tumor classification methods do not incorporate experimental knowledge. As is evident in experimental knowledge, different types of cancer can be associated with the irregular expression of particular miRNAs. Other parameters considered to be critical are the location of the miRNAs on the strand, cancer associated genomic regions, epigenetic alteration of miRNA expression and abnormalities in processing target genes and proteins. Recent evidence show that miRNAs play an important role in human malignancies and could act as a tumor/oncogene suppressor. == RNAi for apoptosis == Recently it has been discovered that small RNA can trigger specific gene silencing in human cells. The RNAi reaction enables a complete elimination of a specific protein which can potentially enable researchers to target pivotal structures within a cell to eliminate the cell altogether. RNAi silencing can also strongly inhibit proliferation of cells with genetic mutations that encourage oncogenic activation. ==RNAi delivery methods== Since its discovery RNAi knowledge has grown substantially. Although quite useful, RNAi in vivo delivery to tissues proves to be a challenge that still eludes science- especially to deep tissues within the body. RNAi delivery is only easily accessible to surface tissues such as the eye and respiratory tract. In these instances siRNA has been used in direct contact with the tissue for transport and the resulting RNAi has been extremely successful in focusing on target genes. When delivering siRNA to deep tissue layers within the body measures need be taken to protect the siRNA from nucleases, but targeting specific areas becomes the main difficulty. This difficulty has been combatted with high dosage levels of siRNA to ensure the tissues have been reached, however in these cases hepatotoxicity was reported. ==References== Category:RNA interference Category:Oncology ","title":"RNAi-Based Identification System and interference of Specific Cancer Cells"},{"id":"35307868","text":"The was a producing coal mine in the northwestern area of Uchibanare and Iriomote Islands, Okinawa Prefecture, Japan. At its peak, between 120,000 and 130,000 tons of coal were produced annually in the years 1936 and 1937 by 1,400 coal mine workers, but production ceased in 1960. ==History== On Iriomote Island, sandstone layers of the Iriomote Formation of the Yaeyama Group were laid down in the Miocene era. Between the layers of sandstone are layers of coal which vary from 15 to 90 cm thick. On the island, this burning stone had been known for a long time. In a document written at end of the 18th century, this burning stone was described in detail. In 1853 a technician with American Commodore Matthew C. Perry reported the presence of coal in Shioya Bay, Okinawa. In 1854 Ry≈´ky≈´ ordered the people of Iriomote to plant trees to hide the coal mines. In 1871 Hayashi Tasuke of Satsuma asked ≈åhama Kana to find the coal. ≈åhama was exiled to a remote island for leaking the secret. In 1885 the Japanese Government first investigated the Iriomote Coal Mine. In 1886 a politician, Yamagata Aritomo inspected the site with Masuda Takashi of Mitsui Zaibatsu company, and suggested the use of prisoners to mine the coal. Mitsui Bussan Company started mining the coal with between 100 and 200 workers including prisoners. On 21 September 1889, there was a severe outbreak of malaria which put an end to mining operations for the time being. ==The development of the Iriomote coal mines== In 1891, several companies resumed coal mining at Iriomote but ceased their operations shortly thereafter. After the Russo-Japanese War and World War I were over, there was a new boom in coal mining. The Okinawa Mining Company and Ryukyu Mining Company, both founded in 1906, were successful in coal mining operations at Iriomote. The mines were distributed on Uchibanare Island and the areas along the Nakaragawa river and the Urauchigawa River. The extracted coal was energy rich and was exported to Japan and to Formosa, Shanghai and Hong Kong. ==Problems of the workers== There had been repeated founding and merging of coal mine companies which had led to problems for the workers. The payment of wages was made by the Naya Seido or Kinsaki method, by which a Kinsaki person was responsible for the production of coal and the personal management of the wage money.Higa[1983jo:915] The salary of the workers was under the control of the Kinsaki person or Nayagashira, and given in coupons redeemable at the shops of the company. The coupons were said to be interchangeable for bank notes, but at unfavorable rates. Many workers grew to have debts due to the job brokers. Originally Iriomote Island was sparsely inhabited, and the workers were imported from various parts of Japan, Taiwan and China without detailed information of the work they would be doing or the conditions they would be living in. Employment brokers used sweet words such as, \\"It is warm in Iriomote, and there is no need of clothes. There are many women and you can eat pine and bananas by extending your arms. You can make lots of money and there is no place better than this.\\" However, the bananas have owners, and the pines were really pandanus tectorius and not edible.Miki[1996:93] The working conditions were very hard. Some of the workers tried to escape from the island, but they were seldom successful. The biggest company did have a 300-seat theater and other worker facilities.Miki[1996:117] ==Decline and end of Iriomote Coal Mine== In 1941, the Pacific War had started and many workers were drafted for military service with the Japanese Imperial army. In 1943, the coal mines ceased production due to a shortage of workers. After the war, the mines were taken over and reopened in 1953 by Americans who resumed production. Eventually, the arrangement of the coal in thinning layers did not allow large quantities of coal to be mined. This led to small profits for the owners and the mines final closure in 1960. ==See also== *Utara Coal Mine ==References== *Kei Higa, Okinawa Encyclopedia 1983 j≈ç ch≈´ ge, Okinawa Times Sha, Naha. *Takeshi Miki, History of Okinawa Iriomote Coal Mine 1996, Nihon Keizai Hy≈çronsha, Tokyo. *Takeshi Miki, Photo Album of Iriomote Coal Mine 2003, Nirai Sha, Okinawa. ==Footnotes== Category:Buildings and structures in Okinawa Prefecture Category:Yaeyama Islands Category:Coal mines in Japan Category:Former coal mines ","title":"Iriomote Coal Mine"},{"id":"35307882","text":"A patrial name or geographical surname is a surname or second cognomen given to person deriving from a toponym, the name for a geographical place.

This proof compression method was presented as an algorithm named ReduceAndReconstruct, that operates as a post-processing of resolution proofs. ReduceAndReconstruct is based on a set of local proof rewriting rules that transform a subproof into an equivalent or stronger one. Each rule is defined to match a specific context. A context involves two pivots (p and q) and five clauses (\\\\alpha, \\\\beta, \\\\gamma, \\\\delta and \\\\eta). The structure of a context is shown in (). Note that this implies that p is contained in \\\\beta and \\\\gamma (with opposite polarity) and q is contained in \\\\delta and \\\\alpha (also with opposite polarity). The table below shows the rewriting rules proposed by Simone et al.. The idea of the algorithm is to reduce proof size by opportunistically applying these rules. {  - ! Context !!

The International Conference on Computer-Aided Design, 2010. In addition: * Rule A2 does not perform any reduction on its own. However, it is still useful, because of its \\"shuffling\\" effect that can create new opportunities for applying the other rules; * Rule A1 is not used in practice, because it may increase proof size; * Rules B1, B2, B2' and B3 are directly responsible for the reduction, as they produce a transformed root clause stronger than the original one; * The application of a B rule may lead to an illegal proof (see the example below), as some literals missing in the transformed root clause may be involved in another resolution step along the path to the proof root. Therefore, the algorithm also has to \\"reconstruct\\" a legal proof when this happen. The following example shows a situation where the proof becomes illegal after the application of B2' rule: {\\\\mathbf{qo}}\\\\, p \\\\qquad \\\\mathbf{p \\\\overline{q}}}{\\\\mathbf{po}}\\\\, q \\\\qquad \\\\cfrac{qr \\\\qquad \\\\overline{p} \\\\overline{q}}{\\\\overline{p} r}\\\\, q}{or}\\\\, p \\\\qquad \\\\overline{o} s}{rs}\\\\, o }} Applying rule B2' to the highlighted context: }{\\\\mathbf{p}}\\\\, q \\\\qquad \\\\cfrac{qr \\\\qquad \\\\overline{p} \\\\overline{q}}{\\\\overline{p} r}\\\\, q}{or}\\\\, p \\\\qquad \\\\overline{o} s}{rs}\\\\, o }} The proof is now illegal because the literal o is missing from the transformed root clause. To reconstruct the proof, one can remove o together with the last resolution step (that is now redundant). The final result is the following legal (and stronger) proof: {p}\\\\, q \\\\qquad \\\\cfrac{qr \\\\qquad \\\\overline{p} \\\\overline{q}}{\\\\overline{p} r}\\\\, q}{r}\\\\, p }} A further reduction of this proof by applying rule A2 to create a new opportunity to apply rule B2'. There are usually a huge number of contexts where rule A2 may be applied, so an exhaustive approach is not feasible in general. One proposal is to execute \`ReduceAndReconstruct\` as a loop with two termination criteria: number of iterations and a timeout (what is reached first). The pseudocode below shows this. 1 function ReduceAndReconstruct(\\\\pi /* a proof */, timelimit, maxIterations): 2 for i = 1 to maxIterations do 3 ReduceAndReconstructLoop(); 4 if time > timelimit then // timeout 5 break; 6 end for 7 end function \`ReduceAndReconstruct\` uses the function \`ReduceAndReconstructLoop\`, which is specified below. The first part of the algorithm does a topological ordering of the resolution graph (considering that edges goes from antecedentes to resolvents). This is done to ensure that each node is visited after its antecedents (this way, broken resolution steps are always found and fixed). 1 function ReduceAndReconstructLoop(\\\\pi /* a proof */): 2 TS = TopologicalSorting(\\\\pi); 3 for each node n in TS 4 if n is not a leaf 5 if n_\\\\text{piv} \\\\in n_\\\\text{clause}^\\\\text{left} and \\\\overline{n_\\\\text{piv}} \\\\in n_\\\\text{clause}^\\\\text{right} then 6 n_\\\\text{clause} = Resolution(n_\\\\text{clause}^\\\\text{left}, n_\\\\text{clause}^\\\\text{right}); 7 Determine left context of n, if any; 8 Determine right context of n, if any; 9 Heuristically choose one context (if any) and apply the corresponding rule; 10 else if n_\\\\text{piv} otin n_\\\\text{clause}^\\\\text{left} and \\\\overline{n_\\\\text{piv}} \\\\in n_\\\\text{clause}^\\\\text{right} then 11 Substitute n with n^\\\\text{left}; 12 else if n_\\\\text{piv} \\\\in n_\\\\text{clause}^\\\\text{left} and \\\\overline{n_\\\\text{piv}} otin n_\\\\text{clause}^\\\\text{right} then 13 Substitute n with n^\\\\text{right}; 14 else if n_\\\\text{piv} otin n_\\\\text{clause}^\\\\text{left} and \\\\overline{n_\\\\text{piv}} otin n_\\\\text{clause}^\\\\text{right} then 15 Heuristically choose an antecedent n^\\\\text{left} or n^\\\\text{right}; 16 Substitute n with n^\\\\text{left} or n^\\\\text{right}; 17 end for 18 end function If the input proof is not a tree (in general, resolution graphs are directed acyclic graphs), then the clause \\\\delta of a context may be involved in more than one resolution step. In this case, to ensure that an application of a rewriting rule is not going to interfere with other resolution steps, a safe solution is to create a copy of the node represented by clause \\\\delta. This solution increases proof size and some caution is needed when doing this. The heuristic for rule selection is important to achieve a good compression performance. Simone et al. use the following order of preference for the rules (if applicable to the given context): B2 > B3 > { B2', B1 } > A1' > A2 (X > Y means that X is preferred over Y). Experiments have shown that ReduceAndReconstruct alone has a worse compression/time ratio than the algorithm RecyclePivots.Bar-Ilan, O. ; Fuhrmann, O. ; Hoory, S. ; Shacham, O. ; Strichman, O. \\"Linear-Time Reductions of Resolution Proofs\\". HVC, 2008. However, while RecyclePivots can be applied only once to a proof, ReduceAndReconstruct may be applied multiple times to produce a better compression. An attempt to combine ReduceAndReconstruct and RecyclePivots algorithms has led to good results. ==Notes== Category:Articles with example pseudocode Category:Proof theory ","title":"Resolution proof reduction via local context rewriting"},{"id":"35307891","text":"Chris Feauai-Sautia (born 17 November 1993) is an Australian professional rugby union footballer.

It was proposed by Scott Cotton in his paper \\"Two Techniques for Minimizing Resolution Proof\\".Cotton, Scott. \\"Two Techniques for Minimizing Resolution Proofs\\". 13th International Conference on Theory and Applications of Satisfiability Testing, 2010. The Splitting algorithm is based on the following observation: Given a proof of unsatisfiability \\\\pi and a variable x, it is easy to re-arrange (split) the proof in a proof of x and a proof of eg x and the recombination of these two proofs (by an additional resolution step) may result in a proof smaller than the original. Note that applying Splitting in a proof \\\\pi using a variable x does not invalidates a latter application of the algorithm using a differente variable y. Actually, the method proposed by Cotton generates a sequence of proofs \\\\pi_1 \\\\pi_2 \\\\ldots, where each proof \\\\pi_{i+1} is the result of applying Splitting to \\\\pi_i. During the construction of the sequence, if a proof \\\\pi_j happens to be too large, \\\\pi_{j+1} is set to be the smallest proof in \\\\\\\\{\\\\pi_1, \\\\pi_2, \\\\ldots, \\\\pi_j\\\\\\\\}. For achieving a better compression/time ratio, a heuristic for variable selection is desirable. For this purpose, Cotton defines the \\"additivity\\" of a resolution step (with antecedents p and n and resolvent r): : \\\\operatorname{add}(r) := \\\\max(r-\\\\max(p, n), 0) Then, for each variable v, a score is calculated summing the additivity of all the resolution steps in \\\\pi with pivot v together with the number of these resolution steps. Denoting each score calculated this way by add(v, \\\\pi), each variable is selected with a probability proportional to its score: : p(v) = \\\\frac{\\\\operatorname{add}(v, \\\\pi_i)}{\\\\sum_x{\\\\operatorname{add}(x, \\\\pi_i)}} To split a proof of unsatisfiability \\\\pi in a proof \\\\pi_x of x and a proof \\\\pi_{ eg x} of eg x, Cotton proposes the following: Let l denote a literal and p \\\\oplus _x n denote the resolvent of clauses p and n where x \\\\in p and eg x \\\\in n. Then, define the map \\\\pi_l on nodes in the resolution dag of \\\\pi: :\\\\pi_l(c) := \\\\begin{cases} c, & \\\\text{if } c \\\\text{ is an input} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\pi_l(p), & \\\\text{if } c = p \\\\oplus_x n \\\\text{ and } (l = x \\\\text{ or } x otin \\\\pi_l(p)) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\pi_l(n), & \\\\text{if } c = p \\\\oplus_x n \\\\text{ and } (l = eg x \\\\mbox{ or } eg x otin \\\\pi_l(n)) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\pi_l(p) \\\\oplus_x \\\\pi_l(p), & \\\\text{if } x \\\\in \\\\pi_l(p) \\\\text{ and } eg x \\\\in \\\\pi_l(n) \\\\end{cases} Also, let o be the empty clause in \\\\pi.

In 1957, Charles Phillips divided the history of public schooling in Canada into four periods or stages: :The first was characterized by church-controlled education and lasted from the early 1700s through to the mid 1800s. Stage two, which extended to the late 1800s, saw the introduction of more centralized authority, universal free education, and taxation for schooling at the local level. Stage three, the early 1900s, saw the development of provincial departments of education, a more consistent curriculum, better trained teachers and the start of provincial government financial support for schools. The fourth stage, since the Second World War, has been characterized by the appointment of Ministers of Education in each provincial government and a far greater involvement of government in all aspects of education.Brenda B. MacKay and Michael W. Firmin, \\"The Historical Development of Private Education in Canada\\" Educational Research & Perspectives (2008) p 68, citing Charles Phillips, The development of education in Canada (1957). For the current situation, see Education in Canada. For the First Nations history, see Canadian Indian residential school system. ==Religious schools== The first schools in New France were operated by the Catholic church (as indeed were schools in France itself). In the early nineteenth century the colonial governments moved to set up publicly funded education systems. Protestants and Catholics were deeply divided over how religious and moral education should be delivered. In Upper Canada the Catholic minority rejected the Protestant practice of Biblical study in schools, while in Lower Canada the Protestant minority objected to the education system instilling Roman Catholic dogma. Thus in both these areas two schools systems were established, a Catholic and a Protestant. The first organizational outline for education in Canada was written by Egerton Ryerson in the year 1847. His aim was to promote British culture in Upper Canada, as well as preserve it in light of its powerful neighbours. He did this in a report titled Report on a system of public elementary instruction for Upper Canada Upon Confederation these schools systems were enshrined in the British North America Act (BNA), 1867. Both Quebec and Ontario were required by section 93 of the BNA Act to safeguard existing educational rights and privileges of the Protestant and Catholic minorities. Thus, separate Catholic schools and school boards were permitted in Ontario. However, neither province had a constitutional requirement to protect its French- or English-speaking minority. Toronto was formally established as Ontario's provincial capital at this time. British Columbia established a non-sectarian school system in 1872. In the three Maritime provinces, schools were mainly Protestant, and a single Protestant oriented school system was established in each of them. In Newfoundland there was not only the Catholic/Protestant split, but also deep divisions between Protestant sects, and nine separate schools systems were set up, one catering to each major denomination. Eventually the major Protestant boards merged into an integrated school system. Over time, the originally Protestant school boards of English Canada, known as the public schools, became increasingly secularized as Canadians came to believe in the separation of Church and state, and the main boards became secular ones. In Ontario all overt religiosity was removed from the public school system in 1990. In two provinces the sectarian education systems have recently been eliminated through constitutional change. Newfoundland and Labrador eliminated its tri- denominational Catholic-Protestant-Pentecostal system after two referendums. In Quebec the Catholic/Protestant divide was replaced with a French language/English language one. Religious colleges are attached to numerous universities.Laurence K. Shook, Catholic Post-Secondary Education in English- Speaking Canada: A History (University of Toronto Press, 1971). Language war and school crisis in Ontario In Ontario in 1912, the Conservative government of Sir James P. Whitney issued Regulation 17 which severely limited the availability of French-language schooling to the province's French- speaking minority.Robert Craig Brown, and Ramsay Cook, Canada, 1896-1921: A nation transformed (1974) pp 253-62Chad Gaffield, Language, Schooling, and Cultural Conflict: The Origins of the French Language Controversy in Ontario (1987) French could only be used in the first two years of schooling, and then only English was allowed. Few of the teachers at these schools were fluent in English, so they had to shut down. French-Canadians‚Äîgrowing rapidly in number in eastern Ontario because of migration, reacted with outrage, journalist Henri Bourassa denouncing the \\"Prussians of Ontario\\"‚Äîa stinging rebuke since Canada was at war with Prussia and Germany at the time. It was one of the key reasons the Francophones turned away from the war effort in 1915 and refused to enlist. Ontario's Catholics were led by the Irish, who united with the Protestants in opposing French schools.Jack Cecillon, \\"Turbulent Times in the Diocese of London: Bishop Fallon and the French-Language Controversy, 1910-18,\\" Ontario History, Dec 1995, Vol. 87 Issue 4, pp 369-395 Regulation 17 was eventually repealed in 1927.Marilyn Barber, \\"The Ontario Bilingual Schools Issue: Sources of Conflict,\\" Canadian Historical Review, (1966) 47#3 , pp 227-248Jack D. Cecillon, Prayers, Petitions, and Protests: The Catholic Church and the Ontario Schools Crisis in the Windsor Border Region, 1910-1928 (2013) ==Prairies== The three Prairie provinces adopted a system based on Ontario's with a dominant Protestant system, and smaller Catholic ones. Manitoba Schools Question In 1891, Manitoba moved to eliminate the Catholic board, sparking the Manitoba Schools Question. It demonstrated the deep divergence of cultural, religious and language values and became an issue of national importance. The Catholic Franco-Manitobains had been guaranteed a state- supported separate school system in the original constitution of Manitoba, such that their children would be taught in French. However a grassroots political movement among English Protestants from 1888 to 1890 demanded the end of French schools. In 1890, the Manitoba legislature passed a law removing funding for French Catholic schools. The French Catholic minority asked the federal government for support; however, the Orange Order and other anti- Catholic forces mobilized nationwide to oppose them. The federal Conservatives proposed remedial legislation to override Manitoba, but they were blocked by the Liberals, led by Wilfrid Laurier, who opposed the remedial legislation because of his belief in provincial rights. The Manitoba Schools issue became an issue in the Canadian federal election of 1896, where it worked against the Conservatives and helped elect the Liberals.Paul Crunican, Priests and Politicians: Manitoba Schools and the Election of 1896 (1975) As Prime Minister, Laurier implemented a compromise stating that Catholics in Manitoba could have their own religious instruction for 30 minutes at the end of the day if there were enough students to warrant it, implemented on a school-by- school basis. Alberta The Catholic archbishop of Edmonton, Henry Joseph O'Leary had a considerable impact on the city's Catholic sectors, and his efforts reflect many of the challenges facing the Catholic Church at that time. During the 1920s, O'Leary favored his fellow Irish and drastically reduced the influence of French Catholic clergy in his archdiocese and replaced them with Anglophone priests. He helped to assimilate Ukrainian Catholic immigrants into the stricter Roman Catholic traditions, extended the viability of Edmonton's separate Catholic school system, and established both a Catholic college at the University of Alberta and a seminary in Edmonton. In 1892 Alberta adopted the Ontario schools model, emphasizing state-run institutions that stressed the English language, English history and English customs. The Catholic community, under the control of Irish, joined the British Protestant community in these new policies, despite the complaints of the French-Canadian minority. Predominantly francophone communities in Alberta maintained some control of local schools by electing trustees sympathetic to French language and culture. Such groups as the Association Canadienne- Fran√ßaise de l'Alberta expected trustees to implement their own cultural agenda. An additional problem francophone communities faced was the constant shortage of qualified francophone teachers during 1908‚Äì35; the majority of those hired left their positions after only a few years of service. After 1940 school consolidation largely ignored the language and culture issues of francophones. Canadianization of immigrants After 1870 numerous non- Anglophone immigrants arrived from Europe, including Germans, Ukrainians, Scandinavians and many others. Large numbers headed to the attractive free farms in the Prairie Provinces. Education was a central factor in their assimilation into Canadian culture and society. An important indicator of assimilation was the use of English; the children of all immigrant groups showed a strong preference in favour of speaking English, regardless of their parents' language. From 1900 to 1930, the governments of the Prairie Provinces faced the formidable task of transforming the ethnically and linguistically diverse immigrant population into loyal and true Canadians. Many officials believed language assimilation by children would be the key to Canadianization. However, there was opposition to the direct method of English teaching from some immigrant spokesmen. English-language usage in playground games often proved an effective device, and was systematically used. The elementary schools especially in rural Alberta played a central role in the acculturation of the immigrants and their children, providing, according to Prokop, a community character that created a distinctive feature of Canadian schools glaringly missing in the European school tradition. ==Academic versus vocational education== Historic educational ideals in Canada, contrasted to the United States, have been more elitist, with an emphasis on training church and political elites along British lines. In 1960, for example 9.2 percent of Canadians aged 20 to 24 were enrolled in higher education, compared to 30.2 percent in the United States. Even at the secondary level, enrollments were higher in the United States. Furthermore, the United States has long led in vocational, technical and professional education, while the Canadian schools resist their inclusion.Seymour Martin Lipset, Revolution and Counterrevolution: Change and persistence in social structures (2nd ed, 1970) pp 40-41 According to research by Lawrence Downey: : Canadians, as a group, assigned considerably higher priority than did Americans to knowledge, scholarly attitudes, creative skills, aesthetic appreciation, and morality , as outcomes of schooling. Americans emphasized physical development, citizenship, patriotism, social skills, and family living much more than did Canadians.Lawrence William Downey, The task of public education: The perceptions of people (Midwest Administration Center, University of Chicago, 1960), Quoted in Lipset, Revolution and Counterrevolution p 42. Ivor F. Goodson and Ian R. Dowbiggin have explored the battle over vocational education in London, Ontario, in the 1900-1930 era, a time when American cities were rapidly expanding their vocational offerings. The London Technical and Commercial High School came under heavy attack from the city's social and business elite, which saw the school as a threat to the budget of the city's only academic high school, London Collegiate Institute.Ivor F. Goodson and Ian R. Dowbiggin, \\"Vocational education and school reform: the case of the London (Canada) Technical School, 1900-1930\\" History of Education Review (1991) 20#1: 39‚Äì60. ==Educational theory== Ontario took the lead in the early 20th century in developing a theoretical approach to education that was not only taught in universities, but largely shaped government policies in Ontario, and in other provinces as well.Robert Stamp, \\"Education and the economic and social milieu: The English-Canadian scene from the 1870s to 1914.\\" in Robert M. Stamp and J. Donald Wilson eds, Canadian education: A history (1970) pp: 290-313. The central theme was that schooling could be approached in scientific fashion.Patrice Milewski, \\"The scientisation of schooling in Ontario, 1910-1934.\\" Paedagogica Historica (2010) 46#3 pp 341-355. == Credentialism in Early Education == The training required to become a teacher formalized in the 1840s. Until this point there were few schools, and teachers would be deemed qualified upon availability more so than intellect and ability. At this point they started introducing qualifications aimed at instructing teachers in how to best do their job. The conditions for teachers at this time were quite poor. They had low wages and poor working conditions. Their salaries ranged from 400-1400 for women, or 600-2100 for men. Accounting for inflation, that would be approximately $8000 for women, or $10,000 for men by today's standards. Along with the low wages, the teachers would be responsible for everything in the school. This included janitorial duties, and administrative tasks on top of teaching the students. This made teaching a quite difficult and unappealing job. The first union for teachers was created in 1920, The Canadian Teachers Confederation (CTF). This allowed for teachers to unify with each other, as well as advocate for increased workplace rights. ==NotesFurther reading== * Axelrod, Paul.

It is considered to be aligned to right-of-centre in its policies. == Origins and history == The Vivekananda International Foundation describes itself as an \\"independent, non-partisan institution that promotes quality research and in-depth studies.\\" The Foundation was established in December 2009, at a site in New Delhi's Chanakyapuri allotted by the P. V. Narasimha Rao government in 1993. Ajit Doval, who retired as the director of the Intelligence Bureau in 2005, became its founder Director. The Foundation made news in 2011‚Äì2012 when it was said to be instrumental in bringing together Anna Hazare, Arvind Kejriwal and Kiran Bedi, along with Baba Ramdev, to form the 'Team Anna'.In the right place, Business Standard, 7 June 2014.

Joseph Rostaing was living in Villieu, a small village in the French department of Ain, just 50 kilometers away from Lyon. Joseph Rostaing created in 1789 an artisanal tannery in the Toison's riverside. There, he used to produce vegetal leather to create shoes for postmen and soldiers. He died in 1830 and gave his tannery to his son, Fran√ßois Rostaing. Fran√ßois Rostaing succeeded into managing the business even though there was a major crisis following the revolution and the republican insurrection in Paris in 1848. Joann√®s Rostaing, his son, kept the old tradition by creating leather with tallow. This soft and fat leather was sold to horse's and ox‚Äôs tools specialists (harnesses, belts‚Ä¶). In 1920, Leon Rostaing, the great-grand-son, developed vegetal tanning with oak‚Äôs bark especially for shoes. The luxury bootmakers and shoemakers in Lyon, Paris and Cannes were then using soles buffered \\"TANNERY ROSTAING founded in 1789.\\" This successful activity lasted until 1950. It was then difficult to keep the business going because the tools used were getting too old. Jean Rostaing, who was studying at the Tannery school in Lyon, joined the family company and developed in 1959 a new business: manufacturing protection gloves. He introduced the first protection gloves in leather for coppersmiths and iron makers during the 1960s. WRostaing developed water and oil repellent leathers and treated them against heat. Jean Rostaing was a partner of the first security group to protect workers all over their body. This group was at first shared with Essilor, VTN and Paraboot and lasted 50 years. Thanks to the French industrialization, the demand for gloves did not stop increasing and the company had a huge success. Rostaing also supplied the first personalized protection gloves for EDF. In 1976, the company launched its range of gloves used for gardening. In the same time period, the company has also outsourced some of its factories (Tunisia, Morocco and Vietnam). The branch in charge of producing gloves is now managed Jean Rostaing‚Äôs three children: Catherine, Jacques and St√©phane. In 2007, the company decided to go back to its roots by launching a new tannery based in Vietnam. ==Rostaing Vietnam== Rostaing Vietnam (also called Rostaing VN) is a branch of Rostaing SA created in 1995. 1995: Branch launch Rostaing VN was created in 1995 by Jacques Rostaing in the aim of reorganizing the industry. The factory is 1500 m2 large and is located near Ho Chi Minh City. According to Mr. Rostaing, ‚ÄúLaunching a business in Asia is not like launching one in Africa or Eastern Europe, where you only have to find a Managing Director who wants to go there. In Asia, it is a choice, it is crucial for your company. You need to have a strong management as well as a local way of thinking. What really matters is to stay in control of your production. You cannot focus only on outsourcing in Asia.‚Äù In Vietnam, the textile factory is a processing industry. Raw materials - thread, fabric, wool, leather = are bought in France and imported in Vietnam to process them. Thus, old techniques are now used again in Vietnam, such as hand-sewn. In 2001, Rostaing SA is becoming the leader of the gardening gloves market in France. In 2002, Jacques Rostaing received a prize for the implementation and development of his company abroad. 2003: development In 2003, the Vietnam branch has 350 employees and 3 different factories. The profit is about 1 million dollars. In France, St√©phane Rostaing is in charge of managing the company, the production and the commercialisation. The Marketing and Sales department is led by Catherine Rostaing. In Vietnam, a latex department is created, Rostaing Technic, as well as a special department for leather goods. 2006: Vertical integration In 2006, the company is coming back to its roots by developing the historical industry: tannery. When Jacques Rostaing opens his tannery, there were only 19 others in Vietnam. This tannery employs 90 people and gives the opportunity to Rostaing VN to take control over the major part of the production, that is to say, from creating leather from raw materials to creating gloves. While the leather glove has been so far the specialty of Rostaing, it appeared ranges of rubber gloves. A fourth plant was born, for a total of 450 workers. Creating a business in Vietnam was a challenge but Rostaing group succeeded into using Rostaing VN as a starting point for developing. For instance, new jobs were created in France to take care of controlling the quality and safety of the products. 2009 - 2012: Diversification In June 2009, the Canova Company is bought by Rostaing. Canova is a company of silk printing. In 2010, Canova Rostaing is created in the aim of using the furniture of Canova while producing fabric and outdoor bags. In May 2011, Rostaing bought Apex's assets which is specialised in backpacks. Apex‚Äôs activity is added to Canova Rostaing, and the company now focuses on backpacks. Each year, about 6 million Rostaing gloves are sold in 35 countries. Rostaing Vietnam is now employing 600 people and the company controls 90% of its production line. ==Rostaing Mongolia== In 2010 was created Rostaing Mongolia by Jacques Rostaing. Rostaing Expertise was also created as a consultancy company for investors in Mongolia. In 2011, the first shop JR was opened in Arizona Plaza 65, in Ulan Bator. JR is a brand of luxury leather accessories (gloves, bags‚Ä¶). The same year has seen the takeover of the model agency Asian Models now called Asian Models Agency which is specialized in Mongolian models. The Rostaing Mongolia Trophy will take place from August 26 to 31. The Rostaing Mongolia Trophy, supported by the Ministry of Environment and Tourism in Mongolia, is a race for outdoor travelers and will be located in Gorkhi-Terelj National Park, in Central Mongolia not far from Ulan Bator. The competitors, in teams of three, will move forward through horseback riding, biking and running. They will cover all types of terrain ‚Äì from screaming downhill runs, across the high country, through grassy steppe and pasture to snow-capped mountains. The competition will start at the statue of Genghis Khan, and will finish in the S√ºkhbaatar place, named after Damdin S√ºkhbaatar, the Mongolian Revolution's hero. == References  * Rostaing Vietnam - Official Page * Rostaing Technic - Official Page * Rostaing Tannery - Official Page * Rostaing Canova - Official Page * Rostaing Mongolia Trophy * Rostaing Mongolia expertise Category:Leather Category:Leather manufacturers Category:Tanneries Category:Manufacturing companies established in 1789 Category:French companies established in 1789 ","title":"Rostaing"},{"id":"35308036","text":"TestPAC (formerly known as \\"TestPAC, Please Ignore\\") is a crowdfunded, non- connected political action committee in the United States. Its Chairman is Jeromie Whalen. It is best known for its 2012 campaign to defeat incumbent U.S. Representative Lamar Smith (R-TX) in response to the Congressman's introduction of the Stop Online Piracy Act and H.R.1981 http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d112:h.r.1981: ==History== TestPAC was registered with the Federal Election Commission on January 31, 2012. TestPAC started when several members of the Reddit community initiated a netroots boycott of GoDaddy.com and \\"Operation Pull Ryan\\", where Reddit members helped Paul Ryan's opponent, Rob Zerban raise $15,000 in 48 hours. When Ryan eventually came out in opposition of SOPA, activists Andy Posterick and Jeromie Whalen formed a political action committee for potential future campaigns. TestPAC was originally registered as \\"TestPAC, Please Ignore.\\" The name is a play on an inside joke on Reddit;https://thenextweb.com/us/2012/03/30/meet-testpac-an-upstart-political- action-committee-that-calls-reddit-home/ the site's most popular post ever was titled \\"Test Post, Please Ignore.\\" https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/92dd8/test_post_please_ignore/ ==Overview== TestPAC crowdsources its mission, goals and campaigns from its member-base on the PAC's discussion forum on Reddit. Although most decisions are made among PAC members, major decisions are put to an official vote on the PAC's website. So far, the organization has held two official votes: one asking members whether to campaign against Lamar Smith and one to decide on a concept for a billboard advertisement. TestPAC primarily relies on crowdfunding as a means of fundraising and solicits donations on social media websites such as Facebook, Twitter, and Reddit. ==Current campaigns== In February 2012, TestPAC members voted between removing 13-term incumbent Lamar Smith from office or Campaign Finance Reform for the PAC's first target issue. With 63% of the vote, members elected to start a campaign against Lamar Smith. The campaign was officially titled \\"Mr. Smith Comes Back From Washington\\". TestPAC had chosen this campaign primarily because of Rep. Smith's support of the controversial Stop Online Piracy Act and introduction of H.R. 1981. The primary strategy for accomplishing this is encouraging registered Republicans and Democrats to vote in the May 29th semi-open Republican Primary against Smith. On April 4, 2012, TestPAC released its first television commercial ==Leadership== Test PAC's leadership structure is volunteer-based and open to anyone. The PAC lists several officers on its website who organize operational elements of the PAC's campaigns and manage day-to-day operations of the organization. According to the Federal Election Commission, Andrew J Posterick is registered as the PAC Treasurer. == References  External links == * TestPAC official website * TestPAC Twitter official Twitter * Sub-Reddit TestPAC official sub-Reddit Category:Political advocacy groups in the United States Category:527 organizations Category:Internet privacy organizations Category:Internet-related activism Category:Political organizations based in the United States Category:Organizations established in 2012 Category:Politics and technology Category:2012 establishments in the United States ","title":"TestPAC"},{"id":"35308046","text":"O≈ºar√≥w Mazowiecki railway station is a railway station in O≈ºar√≥w Mazowiecki, Poland.

In 1914 the line rebuilt to standard gauge and in 1916, the line became double track. The section from B≈Çonie to Sochaczew was electrified in 1959 and in 1961 the next section to Kutno was electrified. The electrification of the E20 line was completed in 1988. In 1992 the modernisation of the section Warsaw - Poznan started, with the task to adapt the E20 route to a driving speed of 160 km/h. On the section Sochaczew - ≈Åowicz permissible maximum speed is 120 km/h and on the section B≈Çonie - Sochaczew - 160 km/h. ==Modernisation== In October 2015 renovation of the station, including the renovation of the main entrance and the replacement of windows and doors throughout the building was started.

It aired on April 2, 2012, on FOX. ==Plot== The episode begins with a US Army Captain (Sharif Atkins) from the 1st Infantry Division. His brother (Arlen Escarpeta), who himself is army personnel, has been charged with treason. Foreman informs the team that the patient experienced a generalized tonic‚Äìclonic seizure. They find out that the soldier had exposed the details of a US Army blunder (\\"blown the whistle\\"). Adams believes that House is losing his observational skills, but the rest of the team believe that nothing is wrong at all. The team believe that he was faking to get out of military prison, but when questioned, the man explains his actions. He also presents with 2 more symptoms, bruising on his abdomen and his legs. House and the team come up with various procedures and decide to ultrasound his belly to find any obstructions. Adams tells her theory to Wilson about House, and says that House is suffering from hepatic encephalopathy due to continued Vicodin abuse. Wilson rebukes this idea, but decides to tell House this and House tells Wilson to not be concerned. The patient tells the team that he got into the Army to find out how his father, also a soldier, actually died. While telling the team this, they notice bleeding from his eyes and hands, blood in his urine, and an enlarged spleen. The team do an emergency operation to release more blood from his spleen but find his spleen to be lumpy. After House makes Taub guess several explanations during the D/Dx, he eventually comes up with sarcoidosis. While the DDx is going on, House and Taub are playing a game and House loses, Adams suggests that this is another example of House's impaired coordination. Park agrees with this, but Chase says that it's ironic that they're talking about a whistle blower while \\"Blowing the Whistle\\" on House. The patient decides to announce on live TV why he showed the video tape for which he was found treasonous, and unless he is granted this, he won't accept treatment. Chase, Taub and Foreman suggest his older brother sign a form to be his conservator. House decides to give the patient an offer he can't refuse, so they manage to get the Army to declassify the pages from his father's record. During this, Taub tricks House into providing a stool sample which proves his liver is failing. This then leads to a double DDx for the patients and for House. House says that their result isn't real. They decide to go straight to Foreman. Chase argues this puts patients at risk due to House being suspended if he rejects treatment. During treatment, the patient suffers from cyanosis, for which they give him heparin. House sees the patient and asks him if it was worth it to release the tape of the Army releasing a bomb on a supposed insurgent hideout. The patient tells him he couldn't take the thought of the suffering of the innocent civilians who died. He tells House his hair turned grey in three days, after which he shaved off all his hair. House tells the teams it's Graves' disease; the team suggests otherwise but House tells them to treat with anti-thyroids. The team decide against this due to their belief that House is seriously ill and his mental state is off. The patient tells the team that he's cold, even though he has a temperature of 104. During a DDx Foreman tells House and the team that all further treatments have to go through him unless House is deemed cleared of all possible illness. House also believes that the patient is suffering from malaria. The patient rejects treatment based on the fact the notes haven't arrived yet. His brother then asks Taub to draw up the paperwork to deem his brother mentally unstable to have them treat him. Adams and Taub realize that the file did arrive but the brother hid this from the patient. When Taub confronts the brother, he tells the patient that their father drank a lot and died in a car crash, killing himself along with a civilian, but asked his friends to change the file records to state that he died a hero's death. Even though they start anti-malarial treatment, the patient is still suffering. House also tells the team, during another DDx, that he was tricking them all along just so he could find out which of the team he could actually trust. While telling them he realizes that he has worked out what's wrong with the patient, typhus. This came from the fact that the Afghan civilian furniture was infested with rat lice. House also tells them that typhus presents with psychiatric problems, so he can fight his case by claiming that he had suffered from disease-related mental instability. He rejects this on the basis that it proves that what he did wasn't the right thing and that going to prison allows him to keep his honor. Towards the end of the episode, House confronts Wilson about being the rat. Wilson rejects the notion and House then realizes that Chase was the rat. Chase explains that House's motives were to see who has the sharpest mind for when House's mind does actually begin to go. ==Reception== The A.V.

He was a leading member of a group of antiquaries in west Penwith: this group also included John and Thomas Boson, William Gwavas, Thomas Tonkin, William Borlase, Oliver Pender, and James Jenkins of Alverton. His teacher was John Boson. In addition to Cornish and English, Keigwin had a command of the French, Latin, Greek and Hebrew languages. ==Family background== Keigwin was the son of Martin Keigwin and his second wife, Elizabeth, Scawen. This made him the nephew of William Scawen, another scholar of the Cornish language.DNB John Keigwin ==Works== Keigwin undertook translations of Pascon agan Arluth and Creacon of the World. These were later published by Davies Gilbert in 1826 and 1827 respectively. He also translated into Cornish King Charles I's letter to the people of Cornwall, written at Sudeley Castle in 1643. ==Criticism== The scholars Edward Lhuyd and William Borlase described Keigwin's knowledge of the Cornish language as \\"profound and complete\\", but later commentators have been more critical. Henry Jenner noted \\"extraordinary mistakes\\" in Keigwin's translations of Pascon and Creacon.Henry Jenner (1904). Handbook of the Cornish Language. Elsewhere, Jenner and Peter Berresford Ellis observed that, in his translation of King Charles's letter, Keigwin used the Hebrew word for war, milchamath, instead of bresel.Peter Berresford Ellis (1974). The Cornish Language and its Literature. London: Routledge. ; p. 92 Google Books Robert Morton Nance regarded Keigwin's Cornish as poor. However, E. G. Retallack Hooper maintained that criticism resulted in part from the way Davies Gilbert had edited his writings: Gilbert did not understand any Cornish himself, and was unable to read Keigwin's handwriting properly. Although Keigwin's reputation in Cornwall was good, his work was neglected until it was reexamined by Whitley Stokes and others.Ellis (1974); p. 91; citing Old Cornwall; vol. 3, nos. 4 &5 and A. S. D. Smith The Story of the Cornish Language; revised by E. G. Retallack Hooper.

It was discovered that the number of passengers aboard exceeded the total capacity of the 27-year-old ferry. ==Sinking== The 2,840 ton Asia South Korea sailed from Mandaue on Cebu Island late on 22 December bound for Iloilo City on the island of Panay. She had been initially barred from sailing after a Coast Guard inspection found that the ship was overloaded. Permission was finally given to sail after excess passengers were debarked. At 05:00 on 22 December the ship was off Bantayan Island in stormy weather. According to one crew member a large wave swamped the ferry, knocking out the power. Life vests were then distributed and rafts were launched immediately. Other reports state that the ship was off course and struck a reef before sinking. The cargo ship MV Jon Dexter reported that they saw the ferry listing on its port side with no lights showing minutes before it sank. The Jon Dexter and the ferry MV St. Peter the Apostle rescued many survivors before Philippine naval ships and military helicopters arrived. Numbers aboard and fatalities In the immediate aftermath of the tragedy a spokesman for the operators, Trans-Asia Shipping Lines, claimed that there were only 606 passengers and 52 crew aboard the 27-year-old ferry, which was authorized to carry 614 passengers and a crew of 58, denying that it was overloaded, citing the Coast Guard head-count before sailing. However the local military authorities coordinating search and rescue efforts estimated the number aboard as 755. The number of those killed is also disputed; the Philippine Daily Inquirer claimed 42 fatalities, while the Office of Civil Defense, claimed 45. According to a 2008 International Maritime Organization Maritime Safety Report there were 56 fatalities. In early 2000 charges were laid against the master and chief mate of the Asia South Korea of failing to safely navigate their ship, manslaughter, and causing physical injury. ==See also== * List of maritime disasters * List of shipwrecks in 1999 ==References== Category:1972 ships Category:Ships built in Japan Category:Ferries of the Philippines Category:Shipwrecks of the Philippines Category:Shipwrecks in the Visayan Sea Category:Maritime incidents in the Philippines Category:Maritime incidents in 1999 ","title":"MV Asia South Korea"},{"id":"35308342","text":"The Maulana Azad Stadium (also spelled Molana Azad Stadium) is a stadium in Jammu and is one of the home venues for the Jammu and Kashmir cricket team.

He obtained his M.A. and Ph.D. in Psychology in 2000 and 2005, respectively, at the University of Toronto where he studied under Jordan B. Peterson. ==Research== DeYoung's research in personality psychology has examined the theoretical structure of personality and the biological basis of personality. Models of Personality In contemporary psychology, the most commonly accepted model of personality structure is the \\"Big Five\\" or \\"Five Factor Model.\\"Goldberg, L. R. (1990). An alternative \\"description of personality\\": The Big-Five factor structure. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 59, 1216-1229.Costa,P. T.,& McCrae,R. R. (1992). Four ways five factors are basic. Personality and Individual Differences, 13,653‚Äì665. Recent research using factor analysis has suggested that the five domains of the Big Five have two higher-order factors, referred to as metatraits.Digman,J. M. (1997). Higher-order factors of the Big Five. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 73,1246‚Äì1256.DeYoung, C. G., Peterson, J. B., & Higgins, D. M. (2002). Higher-order factors of the Big Five predict conformity: Are there neuroses of health? Personality and Individual Differences, 33, 533-552. The two metatraits are Stability, which is composed of Big Five factors of Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, and Emotional Stability (the reverse of Neuroticism) and Plasticity, which includes the Big Five factors of Extraversion and Openness/Intellect (commonly referred to as Openness to Experience). Stability is defined by one's maintenance of stability and hypothesized to be related to the neurotransmitter serotonin, while Plasticity is seen in one's adaptability to novelty and hypothesized to be related to the neurotransmitter dopamine.DeYoung, C. G., Hasher, L., Djikic, M., Criger, B., & Peterson, J. B. (2007). Morning people are stable people: Circadian rhythm and the higher-order factors of the Big Five. Personality and Individual Differences, 43, 267-276. DeYoung has also proposed an expanded classification of the Big Five dividing each of the Big Five into two sub-dimensions. DeYoung, Quilty and Peterson (2007)DeYoung, C. G., Quilty, L. C., & Peterson, J. B. (2007b). Between facets and domains: 10 Aspects of the Big Five, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 93, 880-896. suggested the following aspects of the Big Five factors: *Neuroticism: **Volatility - irritability, anger, and difficulty controlling emotional impulses **Withdrawal - susceptibility to anxiety, worry, depression, and sadness *Agreeableness: **Compassion - empathetic emotional affiliation **Politeness - consideration and respect for others' needs and desires *Conscientiousness: **Industriousness - working hard and avoiding distraction **Orderliness - organization and methodicalness *Extraversion: **Enthusiasm - positive emotion and sociability **Assertiveness - drive and dominance *Openness/Intellect (or Openness to Experience): **Intellect - ingenuity, quickness, and intellectual engagement **Openness - imagination, fantasy, and artistic and aesthetic interests The classification system utilizing these ten aspects allows for nuanced discrimination within the Big Five, which can reveal subtleties in differences in personality domains otherwise undetected. Biological Basis of Personality DeYoung et al.'s (2010)DeYoung, C. G., Hirsh, J. B., Shane, M. S., Papademetris, X., Rajeevan, N., & Gray, J. R. (2010). Testing predictions from personality neuroscience: Brain structure and the Big Five. Psychological Science, 21, 820‚Äì828. research indicates that the sizes of certain brain regions are related to four of the five different domains of the Five Factor Model. The volume of the medial orbitofrontal cortex, which is responsible for coding reward values, was positively associated with Extraversion. Neuroticism was related to reduced dorsomedial prefrontal cortex and posterior hippocampus volume and increased mid-cingulate gyrus volume, which are areas sensitive to threat and punishment and associated with negative emotion and emotional dysregulation. Reduced posterior left superior temporal sulcus and increased posterior cingulate cortex and fusiform gyrus volume were associated with Agreeableness and have been shown to be involved in interpretation of others' motives and beliefs. Increased volume in the middle frontal gyrus in the left lateral prefrontal cortex, an area responsible for maintaining and executing information and planned action, was positively correlated with Conscientiousness. Openness/Intellect (Openness to Experience) was the only member of the Big Five lacking a significant relationship to brain structure volume. However, other research by DeYoung et al. (2009)DeYoung, C. G., Shamosh, N. A., Green, A. E., Braver, T. S., & Gray, J. R. (2009). Intellect as distinct from Openness: Differences revealed by fMRI of working memory.

The text is included in the syllabus of Bengali in the university degree courses. Three days later, on 29 March 2012, Dainik Drishtipat and Dainik Alor Parash, two Jamaat-e- Islami supported local newspapers reported that blasphemous remarks about the Islamic prophet, Muhammad, were made in the drama. Though the news was proved to be false later on, tensions began to mount once the news spread. On 30 March, South Sripur Union Parishad member Abu Jafar Sanpui filed a case with Kaliganj police station accusing a dramatist, a headmaster and an assistant headmaster. Police arrested the headmaster and the assistant teacher and send them to jail. A group of Muslims and mullahs held noisy demonstrations after Jumma prayers on Friday, blocking roads for hours. == Attacks == On Saturday, people from neighbouring areas began to gather in Fatehpur village under the banner of Touhidi Janata. Hundreds of people from Krishnanagar and Bishnupur unions and other areas assembled outside the Fatehpur village of South Sripur union. At around 9a.m. they attacked the Fatehpur High School and Fatehpur Government Primary School with sticks, iron rods and machetes. Then they attacked the houses of Shahinur Rahman and his three brothers and set them on fire. In the Banshtala market, they set fire to the shop of Abdul Hakim Sardar, a member of the administrative committee of Fatehpur High School. Then as the sun set the Muslims burnt down the house of 7 Hindu families including Mita Rani Hazra. They also robbed valuable things from those houses. On Sunday afternoon, rumour spread that Lalita Sardar, a Hindu housewife from Chakdaha village had made another blasphemous remark about Muhammad. People began to gather in the Sardar residence. In the evening, Firoz Kabir Kajal, the president of Nazimganj Bazar Committee arrived at their house along local Union Parishad members. They began to pressurize Lalita to publicly apologize for her blasphemous remarks. During this meeting about two hundred youths from nearby villages gathered near their house and threatened to kick the family and send them to India. At around 7pm thousands of teenagers and youths were called to the spot from the different villages of Kaliganj Upazila. The outsiders gathered around the houses of the minority Hindus and began to pelt stones and brick bats in their houses. The Hindu men, women and children fearing for their lives, began to run towards safety. The attackers then broke open their houses and looted their valuables, including jewelry, garments, land deeds and other valuable documents. They also snatched the jewelry box from Lalita Sardar. After securing the loot in safe havens, the miscreants doused the houses in petrol and set them on fire. The houses of 10 Hindu families were looted and set on fire. The loot and arson took place in the presence of the police. The fire brigade was blocked from entering into the area until the houses were completely burnt. The District Magistrate, District Superintendent of Police, the Additional D.I.G. (Khulna Range) and RAB officers arrived at night and tried to bring things under control. == Aftermath == A week after the attacks, the majority of the Hindu victims still remained terrorized. Members of many of the families haven't returned to their houses. On Wednesday, 11 April 2012 District Commissioner of Satkhira District canceled declaration of the daily drishtipat because of provocating the attack on Hindu families and failure to answer show cause order of the High Court. == Protests == Mainstream Bangladeshi media completely maintained a silence over this incident. Then as the Hindu Students of Jagannath Hall of Dhaka University protested against the persecution. Bangladeshi media highlighted this event. Students of Dhaka University Jagannath Hall staged demonstrations putting up barricades on Shahbag-Matsya Bhaban road on Thursday, 5 April 2012 morning. Nearly 500 students brought out a procession from their dormitory in the morning and later took position at Shahbagh around 10:30am. They demanded tougher actions against the people responsible for the incident. Earlier, on Wednesday night, the students blocked Elephant-Matsya Bhaban road for an hour on the same issue. Bangladesh Hindu Mohajot also protested against the incident. ==See also== * 1962 Rajshahi massacres * 1964 East-Pakistan riots * 1971 Bangladesh genocide ** Operation Searchlight ** Chuknagar massacre ** Jathibhanga massacre ** Shankharipara massacre ** Razakar * 1989 Bangladesh pogroms * 1990 Bangladesh anti-Hindu violence * 1992 Bangladesh violence * 2012 Chirirbandar violence * 2012 Hathazari violence * 2012 Ramu violence * 2013 Bangladesh Anti-Hindu violence * 2014 Bangladesh anti-Hindu violence * Noakhali riots * Persecution of indigenous peoples in Bangladesh * Persecution of Hindus in Bangladesh * Persecution of Buddhists in Bangladesh * Persecution of Chakma buddhists * Persecution of Ahmadis in Bangladesh * Persecution of Christians in Bangladesh * Persecution of atheists and secularists in Bangladesh * Freedom of religion in Bangladesh * Human rights in Bangladesh == References == Category:Satkhira District Category:2012 crimes in Bangladesh Category:Anti-Hindu violence in Bangladesh Category:21st-century Hinduism Category:March 2012 events in Asia ","title":"2012 Fatehpur violence"},{"id":"35308419","text":"Johan Ernst van Nassau-Siegen Johan (or John) Ernst of Nassau-Siegen or Hans Ernst (21 October 1582 ‚Äì September 27, 1617) was a German army general in the Uskok War. ==Background== Johan Ernst was the eldest son of John VII of Nassau-Siegen and his first wife, Magdalena of Waldeck. Through his uncle, William Louis of Nassau-Dillenburg, he could join the Dutch States Army. He managed to stand out in the army of the States, so he became the commander of the \\"Oude Walen\\"-regiment and he was appointed as second in command during the War of the J√ºlich succession. However, his ambitions were halted after the signing of the Twelve Years' Truce, and the Treaty of Xanten, which ended the warfare in the region. ==War declared== In 1616 the Venetian Republic declared war on the Archduke of Styria, of Inner Austria. Early on, Venice addressed the Netherlands for support, whether in money, troops or ships, as the transportation of goods across the Alps to Venice was denied for years. Jan Ernst served in late September 1616 when the resident Suriano and got a contract for six months. The preparations lasted a month, but the Amsterdam shipowners argued excessive demands on the rental of twelve ships, so Jan Ernst emigrated to Enkhuizen and Rotterdam. Half way through November all ships were ready, but partly because of the unfavorable winds and storms, the ships were unable to leave for three months. Meanwhile, mutiny broke out on the ships in Schiedam. Johan Ernst had serious problems with paying an advance on the pay as from the date of appointment and not from the date of exit. The inhabitants of Texel demanded money for all sailors who were housed by the island population. Johan Ernst lost his courage, because the Venetians would only pay when the soldiers arrived. The captains had stashed food reserves for a period of three months and after a short period of time the sailors had already consumed 2,5 months supplies. The owners of the ships were increasing claims on Johan Ernst. It seemed that they would not get the profits which they had reckoned with, and they threatened to leave. The terrible boredom and frightening rumor that the Republic of Venice was about to negotiate peace, but also illness, expensiveness, mutual fights (and religious strife) played a disastrous role in that year. Only on March 2, 1617 the troops left the Texel, a ship stranded off the coast, the rest came on April 4 in the lagoon of Venice. Johan Ernst was granted the rank and title of General by the Doge of Venice, Giovanni Bembo. John Ernst of Nassau came with his 3,100 men, including his brother William and Joachim Ernst of Schleswig-Holstein, for Gradisca d'Isonzo, a small but powerful Habsburg city in the county of Gorizia and Gradisca, on the River Isonzo. For the past 18 months, the city had been in the hands of the Venetians, under the command of Giovanni de 'Medici. Initially, two enemy forts were taken by the Dutch, but because of dissension, John Ernst of Nassau requested his resignation in late July. Prince Maurice insisted, however, to remain at his post. Then, September 26, 1617 the Peace of Madrid was concluded and the siege was abandoned. ==Death== Jan Ernst had already contracted dysentery and died in Udine, because he had never recovered from this terrible disease. The corpse was embalmed, but the ecclesiastical authorities do not have permission to bury him on the spot. His Protestant background proved too strong, in fact, even if Johan Ernst wanted to be buried at Arnhem, it seems to have been buried in Siegen. Shortly before his death he ordered the owners to pay various debts and the remaining amount of about 80,000 florins. The troops of many other leading Dutch were reduced in a short time. The war of Uskok and developments in Bohemia, where he was deposed Wren, has led to the Thirty Years War. == References == Category:1582 births Category:1617 deaths Category:Dutch generals Johan Ernst Category:People from Dillenburg ","title":"Johan Ernst van Nassau-Siegen"},{"id":"35308455","text":"Powari may mean: *pertaining to the Powar, a Hindu social group *Powari dialect, spoken in India ","title":"Powari"},{"id":"35308505","text":"Monument to Pompeo Giustiniani Pompeo Giustiniani (1569‚Äì1616) was an Italian military commander and author. ==Life== Giustiniani was born in 1569 in Ajaccio.

Due to his role in the Bahraini uprising, he was arrested, allegedly tortured, and sentenced to 10 years in prison. His sentence was later reduced to five years by an appeals court. Amnesty International designated him a prisoner of conscience. ==Biography== Mahdi Abu Deeb studied art at University of Baghdad. Later he became a teacher. In 2001, Deeb was promoted by the Ministry of Education to take responsibly for outlining the arts study program and courses offered by government schools. He founded the BTA in the same year to empower teachers' role and equity, and was elected its president. In 2009, he received a PhD in education from Arabian Gulf University. In 2010, he was elected Assistant Secretary-General of the Arab Teachers' Union. ==Role in the Bahraini uprising== In February 2011, large-scale pro-democracy protests began in Bahrain as part of the international Arab Spring. During the period between 19 February 2011 and 16 March when authorities allowed protests in the Pearl Roundabout, BTA played an important role in the uprising; they shared demands with the protesters and pressured the government to achieve them. Deeb was there almost daily. \\"He would leave home in the morning and come back late at night. If he wasn't at Pearl, he was meeting people about schools,\\" his eldest daughter Maryam said. On 20 February, the BTA called for a three-day strike demanding reforms in Bahrain's educational system and protesting killing and suppression of activists, of whom students made up a high percentage. More than five thousand teachers participated in the strike. When the martial law was imposed on 16 March, BTA called for another strike, this one lasting ten days. Arrest Knowing that the government was targeting activists who participated in the uprising, Deeb hid in his relatives' houses. On 20 March, his father's house in A'ali was raided by 30 security officers after midnight; forcing his brother-in-law to guide them to Deeb's house. Finding him gone, they proceeded to interrogate his wife and daughter. According to his daughter, the security officers refused to allow her or hers mother to dress properly before their interrogation. Bahrain Mirror reported that during their raid, police broke down doors and furniture, and confiscated papers and electronic devices. After seven failed attempts to arrest him, Deeb was finally arrested on 6 April, where he was thrown to the ground from the second story of his cousin's house. He was then allegedly beaten by the remaining group on site and during his transportation to prison. His cousin, Sa'aed Ali Muhanna was also arrested and later released on August 2011. The following day, the Ministry of Social Development ordered the dissolution of the BTA, for \\"issuing statements and speeches inciting teachers and students\\" and \\"calling for a strike at schools, disrupting educational establishments, in addition to manipulating school students\\". A military prosecutor also announced that Deeb was accused of \\"issuing BTS statements inciting hatred of the political regime and violent crimes\\". Imprisonment and mistreatment Deeb was first held in Criminal Investigations Directorate (CID) in Adliya, then moved to Asri prison, then to Al Qurain military prison and finally to Juw prison. He alleges that following his arrest, he was kept in solitary confinement for 64 days, and that security officials struck him on the head, legs, and back using a hose, also making him stand for extended periods. Deeb also said that beating continued even after being forced to sign papers and confess in front of a camera to committing the allegations made against him. According to Bahrain Mirror, on 9 April, while being transferred to military hospital, Deeb was beaten and insulted by a military nurse. He was then transferred to Al Qurain military prison. His cellmates, who included Abdulhadi Alkhawaja and Mohamed al-Tajer, reported hearing Deeb get beaten and noticing difficulties in his walk as a result of the attacks. As of 9 April, Deeb had lost about 15 kg and was transferred to a prison hospital where he was diagnosed with kidney damage. Deeb stated that he identified two of his alleged torturers from reading their names and hearing others calling them. On 11 September, Deeb began a hunger strike protesting his detention. His strike lasted for three weeks. During one of his hearings, Deeb stated that despite being told in prison that his health condition was well, a medical examination revealed he had 2 broken fused ribs, friction in knees, cartilage displacement, fragility of bones and weakness in neck muscles. ==Trial== On 25 September, Deeb was put on trial by a military court along with BTA vice president Jalila al-Salman on charges of \\"halting the education process, promoting hatred of the regime and disseminating fabricated information\\" as well as \\"promoting the overthrow of the government by force\\". A National Security Agency detective testified that both Deeb and al-Salman \\"had issued statements that led to problems within Bahrain's entire education sector\\". Deeb was sentenced to 10 years in prison. Al-Salman was sentenced to three years' imprisonment. On 12 December, Deeb's first hearing at the Supreme Court of Appeal was postponed to 19 February 2012, when it was postponed again to 2 April. In his third hearing, Deeb reported to the judge that he had been tortured, including being exposed to a number of fake executions and electric shocks. The hearing was postponed to 2 May. On 21 September 2012, his sentence was reduced by an appeals court from ten years to five years. On 1 July 2013, Abu Deeb's request that his sentence not be enforced until his torture allegations were investigated was rejected by the Court of Cassation. Responses Deeb and al-Salman's sentences drew protest from domestic and international human rights and education groups. Amnesty International protested the sentences, stated that Deeb and al-Salman appeared to be prisoners of conscience, \\"targeted solely on account of their leadership of the BTA and peacefully exercising their rights to freedom of expression\\". The organization called for their immediate releases, as well as investigation of the claims that Deeb was tortured. Human Rights Watch named Deeb's case among Bahraini government violations of freedom of association. Education International denounced the dissolution of BTA and the trial its leaders in a military court, and called the government to respect basic \\"human and trade union rights and freedoms of teachers\\". The British teachers' union NASUWT also issued a statement in support of Abu Deeb and al-Salman, condemning their treatment as \\"brutal and inhumane\\". The Bahrain Centre for Human Rights and the Gulf Centre for Human Rights issued a joint statement that they were \\"deeply concerned\\" by the \\"politicised sentence\\", also noting that the trial of civilians by a military tribunal was a violation of Bahraini law. On 7 January 2012, A number of Bahrain opposition political parties organized a sit-in expressing solidarity with Deeb and demanding his immediate release \\"as the Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry report has recommended\\". The Arab Teachers' Union demanded Deeb's immediate release, asking the government to respect international laws. On 15 March 2012, the Parliament of the European Union called for \\"the immediate and unconditional release of all peaceful demonstrators, political activists, human rights defenders, doctors and paramedics, bloggers and journalists\\" in Bahrain, naming Deeb's case as a specific example of a prisoner who had \\"been detained or convicted for exercising their rights to freedom of expression, association and peaceful assembly or complying with their professional obligations\\". The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights also began an inquiry into Deeb's case, to which a Bahraini ambassador responded by enumerating the charges against Deeb and noting that he had \\"been afforded all judicial guarantees\\" and had the right to an appeal. The Office's Special Rapporteur on torture described this response as insufficient, noting that the Bahraini government's formal response \\"did not address the allegation of torture or ill-treatment at all\\". Deeb's daughter Maryam has actively campaigned for her father's release through a Twitter account. Release Deeb was released from jail on 5 April 2016, after serving five years. ==References== Category:1962 births Category:Amnesty International prisoners of conscience held by Bahrain Category:Arabian Gulf University alumni Category:Bahraini activists Category:Bahraini dissidents Category:Bahraini prisoners and detainees Category:Bahraini torture victims Category:Living people Category:People of the Bahraini uprising of 2011 Category:Politics of Bahrain Category:University of Baghdad alumni ","title":"Mahdi Abu Deeb"},{"id":"35308576","text":"David Caldwell (born June 13, 1974) is a former professional tennis player from the United States.ITF Pro Circuit Profile ==Career== Caldwell was a three time All-American while at the University of North Carolina.ATP World Tour Profile He and Paul Goldstein were doubles gold medalists at the 1995 Summer Universiade, held in Fukuoka.

The Welbeck Academy or Welbeck Circle is a name that has been given to the loose intellectual grouping around William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Newcastle-upon-Tyne in the first half of the 17th century. It takes its name from Welbeck Abbey, a country house in Nottinghamshire that was a Cavendish family seat. Another term used is Newcastle Circle.A. P. Martinich, Hobbes: A Biography, pp. 98‚Äì102. The geographical connection is, however, more notional than real; and these terms have been regarded also as somewhat misleading. Cavendish was Viscount Mansfield in 1620, and moved up the noble ranks to Duke, step by step; \\"Newcastle\\" applies by 1628. Newcastle was a royalist exile in continental Europe in the latter part of the First English Civil War and the Interregnum. He then returned to England and lived to 1676. His life shows many instances of cultural and intellectual patronage. ==Science and mathematics== One of Francesco Fanelli's popular equestrian small bronzes A scientific interest was optics. The group involved in these studies included Charles Cavendish (William's brother), Thomas Hobbes, Robert Payne and Walter Warner. This core \\"academy\\" group was disrupted when Newcastle took on responsibility for the Prince of Wales, in 1638. At a later point John Pell was in Newcastle's service. Charles Cavendish's circle included Henry Bond, Richard Reeve or Reeves the instrument-maker, John Twysden and John Wallis. He was a patron of William Oughtred. ==Literature and the arts== Newcastle in the 1630s became a major patron to Ben Jonson. His second wife was Margaret Cavendish, n√©e Lucas, the writer. Newcastle was called \\"our English Maecenas\\" by Gerard Langbaine the Younger; he was a patron after the Restoration to both John Dryden and Thomas Shadwell.James Anderson Winn, John Dryden and his World (1987), p. 224. Other writers he supported included William Davenant, William Sampson, James Shirley and John Suckling. He bought sculptures by Francesco Fanelli for Welbeck. ==In exile== William Cavendish. As a consequence of the royalist defeat at the Battle of Marston Moor in 1644, Newcastle and some of his entourage went into exile. He returned to England only with the Restoration of 1660. Initially he went to Hamburg. By 1645 Newcastle was in Paris: his circle had contacts in Marin Mersenne and Claude Mydorge, whom Charles Cavendish had met in France at least 15 years earlier. In France Newcastle met and married that year Margaret Lucas who was with the exiled court of Queen Henrietta Maria. She studied with Charles Cavendish, and became a writer on natural philosophy, initially a proponent of atomism. Besides Hobbes, who joined them in Paris, the Cavendishes knew at this period Ren√© Descartes, Kenelm Digby, and Christiaan Huygens. Much of the latter part of their exile was spent at Antwerp; there, though in debt, they lived in the Rubenshuis. Other associations were with Walter Charleton who came to know Margaret Cavendish (not necessarily abroad, since she returned to England for a time), and William Brereton, 3rd Baron Brereton. ==Relationship with Hobbes== Hobbes was employed by another branch of the Cavendish family (the Devonshire Cavendishes, who owned Chatsworth House). His association with Welbeck started at a date that is not completely clear. It was certainly by 1631, when he was tutor to a different Earl of the same name, William Cavendish, 3rd Earl of Devonshire. But possibly Hobbes had met Mansfield (as he then was) by 1627, on a tour of the Peak District, according to surviving poems (his own and by Richard Andrews), as related by Noel Malcolm.Noel Malcolm, Reason of State, Propaganda, and the Thirty Years' War: An unknown translation by Thomas Hobbes (2010), p. 10. Hobbes himself claimed he had been in discussion with the Cavendish brothers by 1630; by 1636 he was engaging in a scientific correspondence with Newcastle. A manuscript work from the Cavendish group of this period, the so-called Short Tract on First Principles, is considered by Malcolm to be by Payne though very much influenced by the issues Hobbes was addressing at the time, and his approach. But the work has also been attributed to Hobbes himself, by scholars from Ferdinand T√∂nnies (who christened it) onwards. ==Notes== Category:History of science Category:Literary circles ","title":"Welbeck Academy"},{"id":"35308618","text":"The Toyota Fuel Cell Hybrid Vehicle-Advanced (FCHV-adv) is a fuel cell vehicle based on the first generation Toyota FCHV.

The building served as a museum for a number of years during the second half of the 20th century. Currently (2012), it is rented out as a residence with an artist's workshop. == Description == The Wijnkopersgildehuis facade is decorated with support arches (ontlastingsbogen) over the windows made of sandstone blocks. The facade is topped by three neck- gables with ornate side-pieces (klauwstukken). The 1633 entrance gate is made out of natural stone and was designed by Pieter de Keyser. The gate pediment depicts Pope Urban I, patron saint of wine cultivation and trade. The basic layout of the interior is a voorhuis (front part of the house) with side- rooms. In the hallway, the original floor beams are still present, possibly dating back to the 16th century. The guild room (gildezaal) in the achterhuis (back part of the house) measures 6 by 9 meters, and also still has the original floor beams. Bridging the gap between the hall and guild room is a small stone stairway counting four steps. In the hall, two gable stones have been placed into the wall. One of these, dating from 1701, originally adorned the building at Spuistraat 77 and depicts a cooper. The second, originally from the building at Vijzelstraat 39, depicts a wine trader and one of his customers in a wine bottling workshop. This gable stone carries the inscription De Wyn De Mackt Fracht Dat / Menych Hart Voerhuecht. An 18th- century gable stone has been added the back facade, on the inner courtyard, depicting a salamander surrounded by flames, a symbol traditionally used by apothecaries.Onno Boers, De gevelstenen van Amsterdam, Uitgeverij Verloren, 2007, pp. 29-30 (Dutch) == History== Koestraat, the street where the Wijnkopersgildehuis is located, was originally part of the terrain around the Bethani√´nklooster monastery. On the location of the Wijnkopersgildehuis, three houses were built around 1551. The building as it stands today was created in 1611, when the investor Claes Jansz Geus joined the three houses behind a single facade with three neck-gables. The remodeling was done by the mason Hendrick Gerritsz, among others. The new building was called Het Vergulde Leeuwshooft (\\"the gilded lion's head\\"). The oldest sections of the original houses were lost during renovations in 1633 and 1655. In 1613 the building started to be used as an inn, known as De Toelast. The building was purchased in 1630 by the guild of wine buyers, who had it radically altered by the Amsterdam master mason Pieter de Keyser. In 1633 the right wing of the building (Koestraat number 10) began to be used as guildhall, with a meeting room for the guild directors at the front, a new back wing with a communal guild room (gildezaal), large cellars for storage, and an entrance gate designed by Pieter de Keyser. This gate originally depicted Bacchus astride a barrel of wine, but this was later replaced with an image of the saint Urban. The left part of the building (Koestraat number 12) became a residence. The guild room was modernised around 1757. New additions included a wooden entrance door in Louis Quinze-style with carved grapevines. Around the same time, the original kruiskozijnen windows (with a horizontal and vertical beam dividing them into four sections) were replaced with more modern sliding windows. In 1798, during the French Revolutionary period, all guilds in the Netherlands were dissolved, including the wine buyers' guild. The two sections of the building were sold in 1818 and 1821 respectively. Subsequently, the building was used as a theater, office space and inexpensive residential space, among others. In 1917, Koestraat 10 was purchased by the wine buyer Jacobus Th. Boelen. At that moment, 13 families were living in the building. A year later, he also purchased Koestraat 12. Following restoration, the entire building was rented out. The purchase and restoration of the building led Boelen and others to found the historic preservation society Vereniging Hendrick de Keyser in 1918, with Boelen as the first chairman. The building was bought by the society in 1947. It underwent restoration in 1921, 1950-1953, and 1956-1957. During the last restoration, an 18th-century fireplace, originally from another building, was placed.Minne Dijkstra, Poortjes van Amsterdam 1571 - 178: Een inventarisatie van historische poortjes in het Centrum van de stad\\". Vrienden van de Amsterdamse Binnenstad (Dutch) In 1950, the residential part of the building was converted into exhibition space, and in 1951 the Medisch-Pharmaceutisch Museum (\\"medical-pharmaceutical museum\\") was housed in the building, followed by a wine museum in 1961.

The species is known from upper Paleocene sediments exposed in the state of North Dakota, USA. It is the first Ginkgo species to be described from Paleogene period with reproductive structures. ==History and classification== Ginkgo cranei is represented by a group of fossil specimens from the Upper Paleocene aged Sentinel Butte Formation exposed near the town of Almont, North Dakota. The specimens are preserved in a fine-grained yellow- to brown-colored shale with a notably high iron content. Fossils found in the shales are often three- dimensionally preserved with stem and seed structure intact. The age of the formation is based on the recovery of late Tiffanian mammals in the upper section of the formation along with the floral and palynological assemblages of the formation. Many of the G. cranei seeds are preserved as casts with hollow crystalline interiors and exterior cuticle present. Associated with the ovulate organs are fossil leaves that were formerly assigned to the taxon Ginkgo adiantoides. The type specimens for G. cranei include two ovulate organ fossils, a holotype and a paratype. The holotype is numbered number UWSP42706 which, along with four other specimens, is currently preserved in the paleobotanical collections of University of Wisconsin‚ÄìStevens Point in Stevens Point, Wisconsin. The paratype, number PP34187, along with one additional specimen, are part of the geology collections maintained at the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, Illinois. A total of only seven G. cranei ovulate organ fossils were known at the time of the species description. The specimens were studied by paleobotanist Zhiyan Zhou of Nanjing University, Cheng Quan of Jilin University and Yu-Sheng (Christopher) Liu of East Tennessee State University. Zhou and associates published their 2012 type description for G. cranei in the International Journal of Plant Sciences. The chosen specific name cranei was in honor of Sir Peter Crane who, with Steven Manchester and David Dilcher, first discovered the Almont Ginkgo fossils. ==Description== G. cranei ovulate organs are noted for the presence of distinct epidermal cells that have thick, dome-like periclinal walls. Overall the ovulate organs range from by . Both the size and cell structuring is different from the living Ginkgo biloba ovulate organs, which are larger at and have less bulging periclinal walls. The stomata complexes found on G cranei ovulate organs and leaves are sparser in distribution and fewer in total number than the complexes on G. biloba. ==References== Category:Flora of North Dakota Category:Fossil taxa described in 2012 Category:Ginkgophyta Category:Paleocene plants Category:Plants described in 2012 Category:Extinct flora of North America Category:Prehistoric trees ","title":"Ginkgo cranei"},{"id":"35308777","text":"Pudur is a locality in Chennai, Ambattur (ward 80 of Chennai corporation), which is a large neighbourhood in Chennai City. ==History of Pudur== Pudur has developed from being a rural area along the Redhills high road to become one of the important residential localities of Ambattur.

The role was created by large capitalization private equity groups and the importance of driving corporate change in building value increased as sellers became more sophisticated and financial engineering less central to private equity investments in the 2000s. . Firms with such Operating Partners argue that value creation potential is better achieved by a fully dedicated and senior partner than solely relying on external consultants. An operating partner has evolved into a full-time position drawing a combination of salary, performance bonus and carried interest similar to an investment partner in the portfolio investment. == Definition == Operating partners are proven business leaders, functioning as either generalists or specialists, and have established track records of building shareholder value. They are usually more capable of developing strategies and leadership teams than a deal-oriented partner, and they are expected to spend more time levering their professional networks to successfully improve portfolio company value. They are usually former CEOs, COOs, CROs (Chief Revenue Officers), or CFOs with significant deal experience in general or in the VC or PE‚Äôs target industry(es). They typically focus on strategic planning, commercial growth, operational efficiency and financial controls, and lever their analytical and industry experience to solve problems facing portfolio companies. == Role and Responsibilities == The role of an operating partner can span the full investment cycle, from due diligence to post transaction integration through to a liquidity event or full exit event. Operating partners are levered by investors and boards as a catalyst for change, as coaches or mentors and in some cases, to serve as ‚Äúsparring partners‚Äù for management. Operating partners may oversee short to medium term as well as long-term operational improvement programs for a portfolio company. They may also support management in day-to-day operations as interim management, board members or as external advisors. The role of an operating partner should not be confused with the role of a venture partner or an entrepreneur-in-residence. A Venture Partner is a non-salaried external resource who is expected to source and play a significant role in a few or more companies over the life of a fund, receiving salary and stock options directly from the target company. An Entrepreneur in Residence (EIR) is similar to a venture partner, but differs in that the person works on only a single company, and typically steps into the company as the full-time CEO, CFO, or other C-level position. == Value == All VC and PE firms seek to maximize the value of their investment. In recent years, the industry has experienced increased pressure to drive operational value creation ‚Äì in other words, shifting focus from leverage and multiples arbitrage to increasing the fundamental financial, operational and commercial performance of their invested portfolio companies. As a result, operating improvement must translate into increased enterprise value, in order to yield higher investment returns. Hence the new partnership triad between general partners, limited partners and operating partners. == Types of Operating Partners == Operating partners use their specialized skills to create enterprise value by improving their portfolio company‚Äôs cash flow or increasing its valuation multiple. The types of operating partners include:  Digital Operating Partner  The private equity digital operating partner is a business executive with experience in strategy, science & technology and operations. Their role is to create enterprise value by identifying, planning and managing the execution of digital initiatives. This process is often referred to as digital transformation. Although any type of technology (high, mid, low) can be applied to any type of company, digital transformation generally refers to the process of using high technology (the Internet of Things (IoT), Data Science (Analytics & AI), the Digital Twin, sensor fusion, AR and Blockchain) to transform traditional companies into digital-traditional companies. == Notable Operating Partners == * Jack Welch was appointed as an operating partner at Clayton, Dubilier & Rice following his retirement as CEO of General Electric http://www.prnewswire.co.uk/news-releases/jack-welch-becomes-a-special- partner-of-clayton-dubilier--rice-156565835.html * Charles Giancarlo was appointed as Managing Director and an operating partner at Silver Lake Partners following his departure from Cisco Systems Inc where he was CDO and President of Linksys http://www.lightreading.com/ethernet- ip/routers/giancarlo-quits-cisco-paddles-to-silver-lake/d/d-id/650526 * Richard Baker was appointed an Operating Partner at Advent International having previously served as CEO at Boots plc and COO at Asda * Mark Gillett was appointed as Managing Director and an operating partner at Silver Lake Partners following his departure from Microsoft where he was a CVP and served as COO and CDO of Skypehttp://allthingsd.com/20131028/top-skype-exec-mark- gillett-departs-microsoft/ * Thomas Ryan is an Operating Partner at Advent International which he joined after stepping down as President and CEO of CVS Health * Bob Swan Prior to assuming the CEO role at Intel, served as an Operating Partner at General Atlantichttps://www.intc.com/investor- relations/investor-education-and-news/investor-news/press-release- details/2019/Intel-Names-Robert-Swan-CEO/default.aspx * Gary M.

The leader of the West Australian Labor Government, Dr Carmen Lawrence lost an election to the Court Liberals before it could make a substantial move against workplace smoking, Traditionally, Liberal governments supported the tobacco industry against activist moves to restrict smoking (especially in the workplace) but in WA, the Liberal Health Minister Peter Foss took a hard line against smoking. At a joint meeting of the state Health Ministers acting as a Ministerial Council on Drug Strategy (MCDS) he led the move to have prominent health warnings on every pack with a \\"Quit\\" phone number included. This was considered by the industry to be a major threat. In December 1994 he openly attacked the Tobacco Institute of Australia and its CEO Donna Staunton, saying \\"the people who sell tobacco can only be described as international drug pushers.\\" This caused much consternation in the party across Australia since the massive donations made to the party in other states were a major source of campaign funding. The tobacco taxes collected supposedly to support a \\"Quit\\" campaign had been systematically syphoned off for other budget items. In November 1994 the Western Australian Health Department announced that it would review the Western Australian Tobacco Control Act which is aimed at restricting sponsorship of sporting events by tobacco companies. Foss's lead in these efforts was a reason for industry concern around the world because this established a priority that others might follow. Foss refused to back down saying: \\"The bill that we have for smoking related diseases is just enormous. And we certainly don't get back in tobacco taxes anything like the sort of money that we spend on hospitals which have an extra load because of the premature illness caused by tobacco.\\" He wanted warnings to cover the entire side of cigarette packets, and he led the other state Health Ministers in an attempt to get uniform generic packet legislation. ==References== Category:Living people Category:Members of the Western Australian Legislative Council Category:Liberal Party of Australia members of the Parliament of Western Australia Category:1946 births Category:Australian people of Portuguese descent Category:Australian Queen's Counsel Category:21st-century Australian politicians ","title":"Peter Foss"},{"id":"35308825","text":"Andreas Brantelid (2018) Andreas Brantelid (born 8 October 1987) is a Swedish- Danish cellist.

It was considered the more conservative wing of the Group of 89 formed by established elites in the debate of drafting the Hong Kong Basic Law and democratisation. It proposed the ultra-conservative Bicameral Model for the future political structure. The alliance's key person was secretary Lo Tak-shing who had an eye on the Chief Executive post after 1997, the alliance became less active as Lo's chance of contesting the post got slimmer and it ceased to exist in 1999. ==History== It was founded by the minority wing of the Group of 89, the conservative faction in the Hong Kong Basic Law Drafting Committee (BLDC) and Consultative Committee (BLCC), as well as Legislative Council members, District Board members, civil servants, and members from the Progressive Hong Kong Society (PHKS) but its leader, Maria Tam Wai-chu did not join the alliance due to its incompatibility of the alliance's aim at influencing government policies and her own role as Executive Council member, though she was still involved in it informally. Led by Lo Tak-shing, the former Executive Council and Legislative Council member and subsequently the chairman of the BLCC Standing Committee, the alliance's general committee had 32 members, 21 were from the Group of 89 and 10 from the PHKS, and at least 6 belonged to both Group of 89 and the PHKS. Core founding members included Raymond Wu wai-yung, Maria Tam Wai-chu, Kan Fook-yee, Chan Wing-kee, Lee Jung-kong, Veronica Cha, Philip Kwok Chi-kuen and Peter Wong Hong-yuen, and was supported by Lo's cousin Henry Litton, Tso Wung-wai, Elsie Leung and the later Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying. Lo Tak-shing was elected honorary secretary, Legislative Council member Peter Wong as treasurer, Veronica Wu and Raymond Wu as press secretaries and Urban Council member Pao Ping-wing as recruitment officer. For the future political structure of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region after 1997 during the drafting of the Basic Law, the alliance proposed a political structure which was considered ultra-conservative called the Bicameral Model, in which only 25 of the Legislative Council members would be directly elected before 2005. Each chamber in the bicameral structure would have the veto power vis-a-vis the other. The Chief Executive would not be directly elected before 2005. The Bicameral Model caused head-to head confrontation of the supporters of the compromised \\"4-4-2 Model\\" which was supported by members of the Group of 89 such as Vincent Lo Hong-shui. Lo Tak-shing and other four alliance members tried to block the adoption of the \\"4-4-2 Model\\" which led to some key alliance members from the party, such as Peter Wong, James Tien, William Fung, Chan Wing-kee, Raymond Wu, Veronica Wu, Philip Kwok to quit the alliance in early 1990. The alliance won one seat in the 1991 election of the Legislative Council of Hong Kong, Philip Wong in the Commercial (Second) functional constituency. Ronnie Wong Man-chiu and Winnie Cheung Wai-sun contested the Island West constituency on a joint-ticket but were beaten by the United Democrats team of Yeung Sum and Huang Chen-ya.

He was arrested in 2009 and 2010 for his human rights activities and released later. In 2011, he was arrested, allegedly tortured and sexually abused, and sentenced to life imprisonment for pro-democracy activism during the Bahraini uprising. ==Background== Abduljalil Alsingace is an engineer by training and was an associate professor of engineering at the University of Bahrain. Until 2005, he was the chief of mechanical engineering department when he was demoted by the head of university. Alsingace family say the Prime Minister was behind this decision, due to Alsingace's human rights activity. ==Disability== Alsingace was disabled at a young age and usually uses a wheelchair or crutches. ==Activism== Alsingace was Al Wefaq's member of the board of directors. He resigned in 2005 and joined the newly formed Haq Movement for Liberty and Democracy becoming the head of its Human Rights Bureau and its official spokesman. Alsingace began to operate a blog titled \\"Al-Faseelah\\", critical of a perceived lack of freedom in Bahrain. During a visit of George W. Bush to Bahrain in 2008, Alsingance attempted to present him with a petition of 80,000 signatures protesting his description of Bahrain as a democracy and demanding the \\"right to draft a democratic constitution\\". In January 2009, he was arrested on charges that he had participated in a \\"terror plot\\" and that his blog articles had \\"incited hatred against the regime\\". His blog was also blocked by authorities in February of that year, leading the Bahrain Centre for Human Rights to begin a letter-writing campaign calling for authorities \\"to respect freedom of expression, particularly for human rights defenders\\". Alsingace was soon released following \\"international and local pressure\\", and was eventually given a royal pardon. In June 2009, Alsingace wrote an op-ed for The New York Times calling on Barack Obama not to talk to the Muslim world about democracy unless he truly meant to pursue it. ==2010 arrest== In August 2010, he spoke at a conference at the British House of Lords, at which he criticized Bahrain's handling of human rights issues. On landing at Bahrain International Airport with his family on 13 August, he was arrested. A security official stated that Alsingance had \\"abused the freedom of opinion and expression prevailing in the kingdom\\". Government officials later stated that Alsingance had been arrested for \\"inciting violence and terrorist acts\\". Alsingance was represented by Mohammed al-Tajer, who would himself be arrested by security forces the following year. Alsingace was held incommunicado until February 2011, during which time he alleges that he suffered \\"physical and mental torture\\" as well as solitary confinement at the hands of authorities. He was briefly released before being re-arrested in March, following the widespread protests of the 2011-2012 Bahraini uprising. ==2011 arrest== On 17 March, two days after protesters were evacuated from the Pearl Roundabout, Alsingace was arrested. His family said that on the middle of night about 4 dozens of police, some masked in plainclothes and some speaking Saudi accent broke into their house. A family member stated that Alsingace was beaten inside house and on the street during the arrest \\"I saw them drag [Abdul Jalil] in his underwear and without his glasses, with a gun pointed at his head\\". His eldest son, Husain (28 years old) was arrested the next week and sentenced by a military court to seven-year prison on 6 October. Imprisonment and mistreatment Alsingace was first taken to police station for few hours before being moved to Al Qurain military prison. According to his family, one month after his arrest, Alsingace was allowed to make a ninety-second phone call to them, and another one the following month. The Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry (BICI) report revealed that Alsingace was verbally and physically abused, and sexually assaulted, losing more than 10 kg and suffering from multiple health problems as a result. According to the report, he was beaten on daily basis and told his daughter was being raped and sexually abused by \\"finger thrust into his anus.\\" Despite being handicapped, Alsingace was forced to stand on his good leg without crutches for prolonged periods, put in solitary confinement for two months in a 2m x 3m dark cell and humiliated by being forced to \\"lick the shoes and wipe them on his face\\". Alsingace also stated at his trial that his prescription glasses and medications had been taken from him for nine weeks. Trial He was brought to trial by the military National Safety Court in June 2011 and charged with \\"plotting to topple\\" the government, receiving a life sentence. The appeals chamber of the National Safety Court upheld the sentence on 28 September. Responding to the verdict, the Committee to Protect Journalists condemned the Bahraini government's \\"stunning disregard for due process and basic human rights\\". Reporters Without Borders also protested Alsingace's sentence, stating that his only crime was \\"freely expressing opinions contrary to those of the government\\". English PEN described its organization as \\"shocked\\" by the sentence and began a letter campaign calling for Alsingance's \\"immediate and unconditional release\\". Dutch European Parliament member Marietje Schaake has also spoken out in protest of Alsingace's imprisonment. The Bahraini Press Association described the verdict as \\"unfair and outrageous\\", \\"marred by abuses and violations of all legal and human rights standards\\". ==References *Al-Faseela, Alsingace's blog Category:Bahraini bloggers Category:Bahraini dissidents Category:Bahraini engineers Category:Bahraini human rights activists Category:Living people Category:University of Bahrain faculty Category:1965 births Category:Bahraini prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment Category:Prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment by Bahrain ","title":"Abduljalil al-Singace"},{"id":"35309099","text":"James Bunstone Bunning (6 October 1802 ‚Äì 2 November 1863) was a British architect. He held the post of architect to the City of London from 1843 until his death, and is probably best remembered for his design for the Coal Exchange. ==Life== Bunning was born in London on 6 October 1802. He was trained in the office of his father, the surveyor Daniel James Bunning, from the age of thirteen. He was then articled to George Smith. He exhibited at the Royal Academy between 1819 and 1848., giving his address as Bernard Street between 1819 and 1823, and Guilford Street after 1832. He was a fellow of the Institute of British Architects, and of the Society of Antiquaries. ==Early career== Bunning was district surveyor for Bethnal Green, (where he built the workhouse in 1840-2), and, from around 1825 surveyor to the Foundling Hospital estates. He went on to hold the same post with the Haberdashers' Company, the London and County Bank, the Thames Tunnel, the Victoria Life Office and the Chelsea waterworks. For the Haberdashers he built the Five Bells Hotel, the Railway Tavern, Hatcham Terrace, Albert Terrace and other streets on the Company's estate at New Cross, and for the London and County Bank he built or converted many branches, including those at Chatham, Canterbury, Brighton and Leighton Buzzard. In 1834 he built a \\"receiving house\\" ‚Äì a first-aid post for people rescued from the water ‚Äì by the Serpentine in Hyde Park for the Royal Humane Society. He won the commission in a competition, entered under a pseudonym, but, as a member of the committee of the society,waived his fee. He also won the competition to build the new City of London School on the site of Honey Lane Market in Cheapside. Begun in October 1835, it was a Gothic building more than 180 feet long, accommodating 400 pupils. He also entered the competitions to rebuild the Royal Exchange and the Houses of Parliament. In 1839 he became surveyor to the London Cemetery Company for whom he did work at Highgate Cemetery, possibly including the design of the Terrace Catacombs (1842), and laid out Nunhead Cemetery (1840) and designed its gates and lodges. Among the last works he did in private practice, before taking up his appointment with the Corporation of the City of London were the towers and parts of the approaches for Brunel's Hungerford Suspension Bridge. ==Architect to the City of London== Bunning's City of London School (1835) In 1843, Bunning was appointed Clerk of the City's Works to the City of London in 1843, a post for which William Tite had also been a candidate. The title of the post was changed to City Architect in 1847. In this role he built the Coal Exchange in Thames Street (1849); the City Prison at Holloway, its front and gateway a ragstone imitation of Warwick Castle; Billingsgate Market (1853), in red brick and stone, in an Italianate style, with a central campanile; the Freemens' Orphans' Schools in Brixton, also Italianate and in red brick and stone (1852‚Äì54), and the Metropolitan Cattle Market in Islington, opened in 1855. He had previously made a design for remodelling the market on its existing site at Smithfield. In 1856 he built two law courts at the Guildhall, and in 1858 began the complete reconstruction of Newgate prison, leaving only George Dance's outer walls intact. In 1858 he built Rogers' almshouses at Brixton and the Pauper Lunatic Asylum at Stone in Kent, both in a \\"domestic Gothic\\" style. Much of his time as City architect was spent on work connected with the valuation, leasing and sale of the City estates. He also surveyed and planned many road improvements, including the building of New Cannon Street (opened in 1854). His unexecuted projects included one for the widening of London Bridge. Thomas Leverton Donaldson, paying tribute to Bunning shortly after his death, said \\"Not content with the mere routine of official duty (which however he carried out zealously and with stern integrity), he had higher aims, and with an earnestness beyond all praise he directed his efforts to give his buildings for the city the stamp of a monumental character, worthy of the corporate body whom he represented\\", and called the central hall of Bunning's Coal Exchange \\"a grand feature, recalling the sentiment of an antique Roman building.\\" Another duty was to provide decorations for the annual Lord Mayor's banquet, and for state occasions in the City. His last work was the decoration of London Bridge and other buildings for the ceremonial welcome of Princess Alexandra of Denmark to London. During this time his health broke down and he tendered his resignation from his post with the City of London, which was not accepted. Bunning died at his home in Gloucester Terace, Regent's Park, on 2 November 1863. A street in Islington is named after him. ==Family== In 1826, he married a Miss Basan, who was of Italian origin. She survived him.

The 1K17 Szhatie (Russian: 1–ö17 –°–∂–∞—Ç–∏–µ ‚Äî \\"Compression\\") is a self-propelled laser vehicle of Soviet origin. The platform uses a Msta-S chassis with a battery of laser projectors mounted in the turret. It was developed by the Soviet Union in order to disable the optical-electronic equipment of enemy missiles, ground and aerial vehicles. ==History== The 1K17 Szhatie was developed in the 1970s and 1980s. Although the Soviet Union attempted to keep the plans secret, the Pentagon managed to obtain drawings from defectors. Western intelligence services code named it the Stiletto. With the collapse of the Soviet Union, the development of the Szhatie was abandoned, as the development and manufacturing of the laser projection system had become too expensive and unnecessary. Two of these \\"tanks\\" were tested, with one being scrapped and the other being displayed in the Army Technology Museum near Moscow, but without its laser projector. The Russian Armed Forces already have been commissioned some types of laser weaponry, Russian Deputy Defense Minister Yuri Borisov said on 2 August 2016. These might be laser systems for jamming tank armament command systems or air defence/anti-missile systems. The first of these laser systems were supplied to the Russian Armed Forces in 2017 according to President Vladimir Putin and Borisov later claimed that these systems are able to destroy hostile targets instantly. ==Design== The \\"tank\\" used an intense laser beam to disable the optical-electronic equipment of the enemy vehicles. This was created by focusing light through 30 kg of artificial rubies which made the whole system very expensive to produce. The optics that produced the laser were placed at the end of a silver coated spiral which helped amplify the beam and increase convergence. The energy to power the laser was provided by a generator and an auxiliary battery system. The lenses themselves were able to operate in different environments by moving metal caps closer to protect the lens. It was also equipped with a 12.7mm NSV machine gun to defend itself against attacks by infantry and air.

He was a self-realized master who devoted more than 50 years to promoting non-violence, peace and knowledge of the self. Guruji ( as he is lovingly called by many of his devotees ) was born on June 15, 1926 in Sikhopur, a small foothill village in Haryana, India. The village was later named Sushilgarh in Guruji‚Äôs honor. As a seven year old he left his home to live with Shri Chotelalji Maharaj, who later become his religious guru. When Guruji was still a young boy, Shri Roop Chandji Maharaj appeared to him in his spirit and told him to become a monk. ( MAHARAJ was a great yogi and enlightened master in the family of monks to which Guruji belongs. He left his body 100 years ago. Shri Roop Chandji Maharaj is Guruji‚Äôs Spiritual guru ). In this life, Guruji was not taught yogic systems from any master. His knowledge was realised through direct experience, and his powers were awakened through the grace of past lives. When he was 15 years old he became a Jain muni ( monk ) in Swetamber Sthanakwasi sect. During his academic career in India, he passed through a number of examinations such as Shastri, Acharya, Sahitya- Ratna, Vidya-Ratna, etc., and mastered the classical studies of Indian religious and yogic philosophies. His primary ashram in North America, Siddhachalam, located in Blairstown, New Jersey was established in 1983. He was among the founding fathers of American Jainism.A Jainist Monk Brings Ascetic Ways Here, KENNETH A. BRIGGS, New York Times, August 28, 1975Jainism: A Pictorial Guide to the Religion of Non-Violence, Kurt Titze, Motilal Banarsidass Publ., 1998, p. 241 Although he was ordained as a monk in the SthƒÅnakavƒÅsƒ´ Jain tradition, he regarded himself to be non-sectarian. In 1979, he formed Arhat Sangh, a syncretic, non-sectarian group within Jainism.Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Jones, Constance A., and Ryan, James D, Facts on File Inc., 2007, p. 251. ==Life== Sushil Kumar was born into a Brahmin household. As a Jain monk, he traveled on foot thousands of miles across the length and breath of India. He represented the SthƒÅnakavƒÅsƒ´ Jain tradition in the making of Saman Suttam, a compilation of Jain principles that was acceptable to all sects of Jainism. He discovered and mastered the secrets of sounds behind the Namokar Mantra, an auspicious rendering that is central to Jains and wrote a book on the subject, Song of the Soul. For hundreds of years and as long as historical records are available, Jain monks did not use any mechanical means for travel. However, on June 17, 1975, Kumar made the decision to travel outside India by aircraft. He said he was prodded in meditation to do so by the 12 C Acharya, Dadaguru Manidhari Jinchandra Suriji Maharaj. Dadaguru asked him to travel to faraway lands to spread Bhagwan Mahavir's message of ahimsa (non-injury) and anekantavada ( belief that no one has a monopoly on truth) This act allowed other Jain monks and nuns to begin using mechanical means of travel, including outside India. The decision caused some controversy in the Jain community. He has traveled and taught extensively , spreading the message of non-violence and self-awareness. He has founded many ashrams and centres in the East and West. During his travels, Kumar helped found many organizations and communities across the globe that engage in promoting ahimsa and anekantavad. One of the principal organizations he founded in North America was the International Mahavira Jain Mission which manages the ashram Siddhachalam that he founded in New Jersey. Siddhachalam is regarded as the first tirtha (site of pilgrimage) outside India. On March 1, 1980, Sushil Kumar was declared an \\"Acharya\\" (master) of Arhat Sangh of the Jain church. Guruji was a master of meditation and the science of sound. His teaching system is called Arhum Yoga. It is an ancient system of the mastery of the inner self through watchfulness and direct perception. Arhum yoga encompasses all aspects of philosophy and yogic practice in the Arihant spiritual tradition. Kumar gained wide recognition as a fountain of wisdom, truth and understanding. He actively promoted peace and harmony throughout India and played a role of peacemaker for conflicting religious groups. He had a strong willed, forceful and articulate personality. An area in which he worked unceasingly was to establish universal brotherhood amongst religious groups of India. At the time of strife in the state of Punjab, he motivated the Sikh leader Master Tara Singh to participate in an open and peaceful dialogue with the government. When Pope John Paul's visit to India was strongly opposed, he spoke in favor of the Pope's visit. His warmth helped the country welcome the Pope. In 1986, he brought Punjab's Akali Leader Sant Longowal and India's Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi together to reach an accord to end Punjab conflicts and attempts of some to cause Punjab to secede from India. Trusted by both the terrorists and the government, we helped bring about peace in Punkab through the Rajiv-Longowal Award. His efforts to bring peace in the Punjab during the early 1980s gained wide attention. Later,in 1992, he was actively involved in promoting dialogue between Muslim and Hindu factions during the Ayodhya dispute. Acharya Sushil Kumar's had a vision of an earth united in the pursuit of ahimsa, peace and brotherhood. In 1957, he convened a World Religions Conference with more than 1200 representatives from 27 countries and 500,000 people in attendance. His work was not limited to creating religious harmony; he also received acclaim for his pioneering work in the fields of animal and environmental protection. In 1966, he initiated India's cow protection movement to signify protection of the weakest. From 1954 to 1994, Sushil Kumar organized and presided over several World Religions Conferences which were attended, among others, by then Presidents and Prime Ministers of India, including Pandit Jawahar Lal Nehru, Dr. Rajendra Prasad, Dr. Radhakrishnan, Dr. Zakir Hussain, Fakkruddin Ali Ahmed, Zail Singh and Indira Gandhi. He also organized several International Jain Conferences which too adopted resolutions of non-violence, peaceful co-existence and reverence to all life forms. In 1982, Guruji inspired the leaders of eight nations to submit a memorandum demanding peace through non-violence to the Secretary General of the United Nations. He stressed that peace through non-violence alone will ensure the sanctity of human life as well as extend protection to animal life and the environment. Guruji and his devotees rallied along with a million other individuals in New York City in support of the memorandum. In August 1989, Sushil Kumar was invited to inaugurate and preside over the World Hindu Conference in Britain. Since the Hindus regarded him as one of their spiritual leaders, they enthusiastically embraced his notion of Ahimsa (Non- Violence) and vowed to join him in propagating the virtues of meditation, vegetarianism and unity. That same year, Guruji addressed the World Conference of Religions for Peace in Melbourne, Australia. Advocating the dire need to protect the animal kingdom and our natural environment, he explained that all living beings equally share the right to life. In 1988, Guruji was a distinguished speaker at Vishwa Hindu Sangh Conference held in Nepal, where once again made moving speeches. In 1990, Guruji was an honored guest at the Global Conference for Human Survival in Moscow. More than 1200 individuals from 70 countries traveled to the USSR to take part in this historic gathering and were present to participate in Guruji's meditation and to listen to his views on the need for non-violence, including Mikhail Gorbachev. The two discussed various issues relating to the establishment of world peace and global co-operation. In 1991 he traveled to Iran in an attempt to persuade Saddam Hussein to adopt a peaceful resolution to the Gulf Crisis. Although poor roads and the prevailing war conditions prevented him from entering Iraq, Guruji was widely recognized and appreciated for his valiant efforts to stop the Gulf War. At the World Parliament of Religions conference at Chicago in 1993, he delivered the keynote address where he emphasized the need to create a charter of Animal Rights for ecological balance, a key to human survival. Siddhachalam, a Jain ashram he founded in the U.S., draws pilgrims from around the world. In 1982, the International Mahavir Jain Mission founded by him became affiliated with the United Nations and the concept of Ahimsa was adopted at the Sacred Earth Gathering as a core principle for protecting all forms life. At the Sacred Earth Gathering held on the sidelines of the 1992 Earth Summit, the World Movement of Non-Violence for Peace and Environment was launched in Rio with Guruji serving as a founding President along with Dr. Robert Muller. That same year, a Jain Studies Department was initiated at Columbia University, New York, and a Jain \\"Chair\\" established at Toronto University in Canada under his inspiration. A Jain Encyclopedia was also incorporated into the Hindu Encyclopedia (Macmillan Press). Sushil Kumar inspired the founding of many spiritual organizations, including the World Fellowship of Religions (1957) and the Vishwa Ahimsa Sangh (1957). The 25' Centenary Celebration of the 24th Tirthankara of Jainism, Lord Mahavir, was convened by him in India. He also founded the International Mahavir Mission (1977), the World Jain Congress (1981) and the World Center of Non-Violence. He was the Honorary President of the World Conference of Religions for Peace, the director of the Temple of Understanding, a Founding Member of the Global Forum of Spiritual and Parliamentary Leaders on Human Survival, President of the Punjab Peace Unity Committee, President of the Ram Janambhoomi-Babri Masjid Solution Committee and a Founding Member of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad. His aim was uniting the world in a State of Ahimsa. Wherever he journeyed around the world, he was sought after for his wisdom, his loving and childlike simplicity, and for his love and brotherhood. He was known to engage in deep meditation for days at a sitting and easily traverse time, space and lives.

C.) was a composer and professor of music. He was born in Philadelphia, attended the University of Pennsylvania, then the Juilliard School in New York. Among his teachers were Otto Luening, Aaron Copland, Jacques Ibert, and Peter Mennin (although he always claimed that the effect of these teachers on his own composing technique was 'minimal'). After a year of study on a Fulbright Fellowship in Paris (where he was meant to study with Arthur Honegger, but hardly ever saw him), and a year teaching at the University of Washington in Seattle, he settled in the Washington, D.C. area in 1952. Parris joined the faculty of The George Washington University in 1963 where he taught theory and composition. Parris liked to describe himself as a 'colorist', and he therefore tended to write for small ensembles or a single instrument accompanied by piano or orchestra. His first international recognition came in 1958 with his Concerto for Five Kettledrums and Orchestra, premiered by tympanist Fred Begun and the National Symphony Orchestra in Washington, under Howard Mitchell. Parris was notorious for pushing instruments to the limits of any player's abilities: his solo violin sonata is particularly difficult, and the composer-directors of CRI believed his trombone concerto to be unplayable until they heard a recording of it. But he was also the most inventive of orchestrators: Parris's concerto for kettledrums was always a crowd-pleaser in performance because it was so surprisingly melodic: its last movement is built around a traditional hymn (like Copland's Appalachian Spring) but Parris gives the initial statements of that hymn‚Äîand its dramatic summation‚Äîto the kettledrums. Begun, the NSO principal tympanist who premiered the piece, made the original suggestion for the piece, but he later remarked, \\"\\"I suggested five drums jestingly.\\"Fred Begun, obituary, The Washington Post, October 1, 2012. In the sixties and seventies Parris was a sometime music critic for The Washington Post and the Washington Evening Star. In this period Parris‚Äîwho taught himself Spanish‚Äîalso turned to Borges for inspiration and produced the Book of Imaginary Beings (Part I) a work for flute (pic), violin, cello, piano, celeste, and percussion, from 1972. Part II was published in 1983. A revival of the Concerto for Five Kettledrums and Orchestra, also in 1983, by the National Symphony Orchestra, under the direction of Mstislav Rostropovich, was such a success that it resulted in new performances of his Concerto for Trombone (first performed in 1964) by the NSO in 1985 and, then, to Parris's largest commission. His Symphonic Variations, performed in 1988 to great acclaim, was the result. A retrospective concert of his works at The George Washington University in this same year led Washington Post music critic Joseph McLellan to refer to Professor Parris as ‚Äúone of (Washington‚Äôs) major music assets.‚Äù ==References *Interview with Robert Parris, October 22, 1988 Category:1924 births Category:1999 deaths Category:American male composers Category:Musicians from Philadelphia Category:20th-century American composers Category:20th-century American male musicians ","title":"Robert Parris"},{"id":"35309310","text":"Coprosma autumnalis, (In MƒÅori: kanono or raurƒìkau) is a native forest shrub of New Zealand.

It faces across the street the similarly Baroque facade of San Giacomo in Augusta. It is more correctly called Chiesa dei Santi Nomi di Ges√π e Maria (\\"Church of the Holy Names of Jesus and Mary\\"). The church was made a cardinalate deaconry by Pope Paul VI in 1967 with the name of Santissimi Nomi di Ges√π e Maria in Via Lata (\\"Most Holy Names of Jesus and Mary on Via Lata\\"). \\"Via Lata\\" is the old name of Via del Corso. The church now serves as an apostolate of the Institute of Christ the King Sovereign Priest. ==History== Interior of nave. Initially a church titled Sant'Antonio Abate in Augusta was located on the site, which was previously owned by the Colona family. Construction of the church was begun in 1633 for a Discalced Augustinian order, with designs by Carlo Buzio (also called Carlo Milanese).Accurata, E Succinta Descrizione Topografica, E Istorica Di Roma, Volume 1, by Ridolfino Venturini, published by Carlo Barbellieni, Rome (1768); page 147.The attribution to the more famous Carlo Maderno by many sources is not substantiated by archival evidence, according to Italian Wikipedia entry. The structure was completed by 1635, and consecrated the next year to Jesus and Mary. Later the architect Carlo Rainaldi was commissioned to design the simple travertine facade (1671‚Äì1674) and ornamented Baroque interiors, including the main altar. From 1678 to 1690, the expensive and ornate marble interior decoration was installed under the patronage of Giorgio Bolognetti, bishop of Rieti. From the 18th through 19th centuries, the church belonged to the Jesuit order. The church was reconsecrated the next year as recalled by an inscription in the sacristy. ==Interior == The vault and the main altarpiece, depicting a Coronation of the Virgin (1679), are painted by Giacinto Brandi. Stucco work was by Gramignoli and Monsu Michele.As cited in F. Titi, Descrizione delle Pitture, Sculture e Architetture esposte in Roma, Roma 1763, pp. 381-384 The church entrance to the sacristy has frescoes by Giovanni Lanfranco. Other paintings in the sacristy are by Padre Matteo di San Alessio from Palermo. The main altarpiece, Charity of St Thomas of Villanova was painted by Felice Ottini. On the left side of the church are chapels dedicated to St Thomas of Villanova (with painting by Felice Ottini), St Joseph, and to the Madonna of Divine Help. It contains funeral monuments for Ercole and Luigi Bolognetti, brothers of bishop Giorgio Bolognetti, whose monument is present further down along the nave. On the right side of the church are chapels dedicated to the Crucifixion (with statuary by Francesco Aprile), St Nicholas of Tolentino (canvas painted by Basilio Francese or Giovanni Carbone), and St Anne. This side contains funeral monuments dedicated to Pietro and Francesco Bolognetti (by Pietro Cavallini, 1681), and to Mario Bolognetti (by Francesco Aprile). By the entrance, the first funeral monuments on the right were for members of the Corno family, including a Monument to Giulio del Corno made by Ercole Ferrata and Domenico Guidi, pupils of Bernini.Rome: A tour of many days : in three volumes, Volume 1. By George Head, Page 104, London, 1849 The first chapel on the right has the bust of Sig. Bolognetti by Francesco Aprile.

Previously the place was called Gorakhmata, a centre of Sidhh-jogis named after the ounder of their order, Gorakhnath, at the distance of 30 miles from Reetha sahib. Here, Guru Nanak on his first udasi had a long discourse with siddhas on matters of religion and metaphysics. This discourse has been recorded in the Siddh-Gost in Guru Granth Sahib. Later on, the place was named Nanakmatta to perpetuate the memory of Guru's visit. The town is associated with Guru Nanak Dev and Guru Hargobind. It is situated on the bank of Deoha stream, which has since been dammed into a reservoir named Nanak Sagar. The Gurudwara is located 15 kilometres west of Khatima Railway Station on road to Tanakpur. The holy shrine is near the town of Sitarganj.Nanakmatta Udham Singh Nagar district Official website. It is one of three Sikh Holy places in the state, with others being Gurdwara Hemkunt Sahib and Gurudwara Reetha Sahib. It is also an Uttarakhand Legislative Assembly constituency within the Nainital-Udhamsingh Nagar (Lok Sabha constituency). right ==Karsewa at Gurudwara == Before 1937, the gurudwara was maintained by mahants. A small gurudwara was constructed by the local people. The land for the Gurudwara was donated by Nawab Mehndi Ali Khan. Karsewa began in 1975. The gurudwara building is magnificent and has marble all over. The complex consists of the main hall, the langar hall, the parikarama, the sarai, offices, etc. A second gurudwara, Gurudwara Patshahi Sixth, is also present here.

He was most recently the head coach of Fredrikstad. As a player Aune played for Fredrikstad at the second and third tier from 1990 to 1999 only interrupted by two seasons at Sogndal, where he got 19 appearances in Tippeligaen in 1994. ==Early life== Aune was born in Oslo, and as a kid he played two years for Enebakk. His family then moved to Lisleby in Fredrikstad, and he started playing for Lisleby FK. ==Player career== Aune made his debut for Lisleby's first team in 1988, and the next season he scored 22 goals for the club, which were playing at the fourth tier. Ahead of the 1990 season he transferred to Fredrikstad FK. The club was then playing at the second tier, and Aune was a regular starter for the team. In 1991, he scored nine goals, and was the team's second top goalscorer, only beaten by Stian Solberg, who scored ten goals. In 1992 Fredrikstad was relegated to the third tier for the first time in the club's history. A lot of players left the club, but Aune stayed for one more year. Fredrikstad finished second in the 1993 Second Division, and Aune was the team's top goalscorer with ten goals. Aune then moved to Sogndal, and played 19 matches in Tippeligaen in 1994, when the team was relegated. He played for Sogndal until August 1995, when he moved back to his home-town team Fredrikstad. He played four more years for Fredrikstad, before he moved to the local rivals Sarpsborg, where he spent two seasons before he retired. ==Coaching career== After his retirement, Aune worked several years as a teacher in high school. He was hired as youth coach in Fredrikstad in 2002, but after one year he quit the job because FFK wanted Aune to work full-time as youth coach while Aune wanted to still be a teacher. After one year as head coach in his youth-club Lisleby, and one year as head coach in Kvik Halden, Aune was again hired as youth-coach in Fredrikstad in October 2004. When Anders Gr√∂nhagen was signed as head coach of Fredrikstad, Per Morten Haugen and Aune become assistant coaches. Aune quit his job as a teacher in 2008, and during the 2009-season he stepped in temporarily as head coach when Gr√∂nhagen was on a sick leave.

He was introduced in the third series as a socially inept teenager who was a long-time friend of both Freddie McClair and James Cook. JJ is notable for having Asperger's syndrome and was a virgin when the series started. However, as series three and four progress, JJ becomes more socially confident. He is the only character in the third and fourth series to appear in every episode. ==Characterization== JJ is a friend of Cook and Freddie who dub themselves The Three Musketeers. He is very well spoken, articulate and excels academically, particularly in maths and science. He has Asperger syndrome, and although he can understand some social cues, such as humour and sarcasm and is able to interact with his friends normally, he has difficulty interacting with strangers and controlling his emotions, and is extremely sensitive to sensory stimulation. As a result, he finds it difficult to make friends outside of his main circle, and is prone to becoming stressed and disorientated when in a large crowd of people, an intense party atmosphere, or an awkward situation - which he refers to as being ‚Äúlocked on\\". He often needs a friend come to his rescue, such as in his self-titled episode in series three and Pandora's episode. Because of this, he has been put on various medications geared towards making him appear more neurotypical (although this is not common medical practice for autism alone). JJ is interested in magic tricks, and his proficiency in magic is something that allows him to be accepted by the rest of the gang, most of whom view him with a mixture of affection, amusement and mild irritation. JJ becomes close to Emily Fitch, who finds him to be a source of support for her own issues and in turn helps him with his. Because of this, he is the first person to whom she confides about her closeted homosexuality, and she in turn has sex with him, so that he may lose his virginity. This is in sharp contrast to the unkindness her more judgemental sister, Katie, shows him. JJ often acts as a mediator whenever Freddie and Cook fight. Although he was in love with her in series three, he also grew to dislike Effy, seeing her as the cause for the break-up of Freddie and Cook's friendship. He forms a close friendship with Thomas Tomone in series four, who proves instrumental in getting JJ his first real girlfriend, Lara. ==Character history== Series 3 JJ first appears in \\"Everyone\\" when he meets best friends Freddie and Cook before starting their first day at Roundview College. There he often goes unnoticed despite his magic tricks and articulate speech. He, along with Freddie and Cook become infatuated with Effy. In ‚ÄúCook‚Äù, JJ manages to impress the gang with a magic stunt involving a goldfish, which Cook spoils. Cook persuades JJ to accompany him to a brothel where JJ nervously asks for a kiss from a prostitute. In ‚ÄúPandora‚Äù, JJ and Cook attempt to sneak into Pandora's ‚Äúgirls only‚Äù party. After Cook goes in, JJ goes in himself only to find Emily and Naomi kissing. The party turns into a massive house party when Katie's boyfriend and his football mates come round. JJ calls Freddie to get him out of the party after he gets ‚Äúlocked on‚Äù. Freddie arrives and takes him home. In \\"Freddie\\", JJ witnesses Effy's destructive influence over his closest friends. He performs an elaborate fire eating stunt which impresses Effy, Freddie and Cook. He votes against Karen in a reality television program, under Cook's instructions, as revenge against her stealing Freddie's shed, a previous popular hang out place for the gang. However, this sparks a violent confrontation between Freddie and Cook. In \\"Naomi\\", JJ proves a useful asset in helping Cook's sixth form President campaign. In JJ's centric episode, his autism and his temperament are made clear. He regularly attends a clinic where he requires heavy medication, here he also expresses his fury at Effy's manipulation of both Freddie and Cook. At the clinic, he meets Emily who is receiving counselling, and the two discuss their woes outside the clinic. She confides to him about her homosexuality, and he in turn confesses his desire to be normal, shocking her with the number of drugs he has been prescribed. He also expresses his fury that the friendship he had shared with Freddie and Cook has been destroyed the love triangle caused by Effy. At Emily's urging, he stands up to Freddie over his treatment of him, accidentally revealing Emily's homosexuality to her twin sister Katie in the process. He then confronts Effy about her role in destroying a friendship he prized so much and confesses his love for her. Effy, seeing the impact she has had on his life, is apologetic and suggests they become friends, and is hurt when he coldly refuses. When he goes to confront Cook, he accidentally discovers that he is continuing his affair with Pandora, though he does not reveal this to anyone else. Seeing that Cook is, like Freddie, indifferent to his own feelings, JJ explodes at him over it. Cook, moved by this, gives him a hug and invites him to buy drugs, which subsequently gets busted. Cook and JJ escape and Cook, desperate for drugs, takes JJ's new medication on JJ's suggestion. JJ, however, did this because he knew that the drug is designed to both calm someone down and make them more honest. As a result, at a party Cook settles into a relaxed state, which surprises the gang, and reveals his affair with Pandora, which Pandora's boyfriend Thomas overhears. Cook also reveals Effy loves Freddie. JJ leaves the party and finds a distraught Emily whom he allows her to stay at his place after her argument with Katie. She in turn offers to take his virginity which JJ nervously accepts, and the two have sex. The next morning he introduces Emily to his mother (portrayed by Juliet Cowan) who is relieved to see that her son finally made a good friend. In ‚ÄúEffy‚Äù JJ accompanies the gang (minus Cook) on a camping trip. When Cook invites himself along the gang reveal their true feelings about him, including JJ who states they are no longer friends after the way Cook had been treating him. In ‚ÄúKatie and Emily‚Äù, JJ sees Emily through her disguise as her sister in an exam, but does not tell anyone else. Later on, he and Freddie meet the Fitch sisters while buying clothes for the college prom. Emily is horrified when JJ reveals he told Freddie about their fling. Freddie mentions it to Katie, who is equally shocked. Katie then reveals Emily and JJ's fling to Naomi, who is upset. This causes a fight between the Fitch sisters. In the series finale, While at work with Freddie he gets into an argument with when he says that it's fine refuting this saying angrily that nothing's fine and resigns from his job and walking out on Freddie. JJ then encounters Effy's mum, Anthea who reveals her sadness at not having Effy around who has run off with Cook. After Freddie receives a call from Effy, JJ pressures him to find her, accompanying him along the way. Cook challenges Freddie and JJ to a race, the winner is allowed to keep Effy. JJ wins the race using his intelligence, and as a result he forces Effy to admit she is in love with Freddie and not Cook, which upsets the latter. They flee the town on Cook's dad's boat. Series 4 In ‚ÄúThomas‚Äù, the series opener, JJ attempts to make the gang seem happier despite the suicide of Sophia, Effy's refusal to return to college and Thomas‚Äô strained relationship with Pandora hanging over them. JJ concedes that Effy's disappearance is affecting the ‚ÄúThree Musketeers‚Äù. In ‚ÄúEmily‚Äù, JJ tries to break up a fight between Cook and a fellow party-goer, Shanky Jenkins only for Cook to head butt him in rage, although Cook did not see JJ at the time. This upsets JJ and Freddie, the latter confronting Cook about it. In subsequent episodes, JJ develops a close friendship with Thomas as Cook is arrested and Freddie spends more time with Effy. This highlights JJ's developing maturity and his ability to make other friends. In ‚ÄúJJ‚Äù, JJ asks out Lara Lloyd (played by Georgia Henshaw), a fellow co-worker at a confectionery store. Thomas pressures JJ to do this after he concedes he has developed feelings for her. Before the date, Freddie forces a recently escaped Cook onto JJ who is not pleased to see him. JJ allows Cook to stay at his in exchange for some dating tips. JJ discovers Lara is a single mother and her baby, Albert, is fathered by her previous boyfriend Liam. Liam catches JJ with Albert and demonstrates his overly protective attitude for his son. The date does not go well, largely because of Cook's poor dating advice. However, Lara reciprocates JJ's feelings and they make love at her house. Liam sees JJ at a clinic receiving his medication. JJ takes Lara to meet Emily and Naomi. Emily confides to JJ that Lara could be using JJ to get back at Liam; JJ refutes this by stating they have trust in their relationship, something Emily and Naomi lacks. This brings Emily to tears. JJ later takes Lara to meet his parents but this does not go as well. JJ's mother, via a Freudian slip, mentions that she thinks Lara is a slut. This, along with JJ and his mother arguing over the bathroom door being locked causes Lara to leave, and JJ reveals Cook is hiding in the bathroom. Liam confronts JJ at the confectionery store, demanding to know about his medication. JJ angrily lashes out at Liam which prompts a watching Lara to break up with him. JJ later apologises to Liam who admits his protectiveness is of his son. He does ask JJ to take care of Lara. JJ, with the help of his friends, manages to win Lara back. After his centric episode, JJ makes fewer appearances but is usually seen at parties with the gang. Lara makes no more appearances, but JJ is sometimes seen with Albert, suggesting they are still together. In ‚ÄúEffy‚Äù, the gang receives their A-Level results, and JJ scores very well; 2 A's and a B. JJ is last seen at Freddie's shed partying with the rest of the group. ==External links== *JJ Jones on the official E4 Skins site *JJ Jones Character Blog on E4 Skins site * JJ Jones on IMDb *JJ Jones on Myspace Category:Skins (British TV series) characters Category:Fictional British people Category:Fictional English people Category:Television characters introduced in 2009 Category:Fictional characters on the autism spectrum ","title":"JJ Jones (Skins)"},{"id":"35309864","text":"JJ Jones or J.

Sugar people (Á≥ñ‰∫∫) is a traditional Chinese form of folk art using hot, liquid sugar to create three-dimensional figures. These fragile, plump figures have a distinct brownish-yellow colour, usually with yellow or green pigment added. They are mainly purchased for ornamental purposes and not for consumption, due to sanitary concerns. Popular figures include animals such as dragons, roosters and pigs, and such objects machetes and spears. 150px Similar to the trade of producing sugar paintings, this art form has been practiced in public places for hundreds of years, and can still be seen today. Traditionally, artists set up their point of production and sale in areas such as markets, and outside schools, as the figures appeal to children. These days, this art form is practiced in tourist areas. Prices can range from one or two, to tens of RMB, depending on the piece. However, during difficult economic times, artists would exchange figures for metal scraps, broken shoes, old clothing, and notably, toothpaste. Children would often scavenge for these items in order to purchase a figure. ==Technique== 150px Using a small charcoal stove, sugar is heated in a metal vessel. When at the correct temperature, a ball is extracted. It is then kneaded in the artist's hands to product consistency and pliability. A thin straw is then inserted into the ball, and the artist begins to blow air into it, in order to slowly inflate it. Simultaneously, the artist pinches and pulls parts of the ball, by hand, or sometimes with tools such as tweezers, to produce limbs, and various shapes. Before the figure has completely cooled, colours, typically red or green, are added to the surface, and a wooden stick is inserted into the underside. The straw is then extracted, and the figure put on display for sale. ==See also== *Amezaiku in Japan *Sugar painting *Sugar sculpture * T√≤ he ==References * Video * Category:Chinese folk art ja:È£¥Á¥∞Â∑• ","title":"Sugar people"},{"id":"35309983","text":"Vespina quercivora is a moth of the family Incurvariidae.

He then joined the band Opus 13, led by the arrangers Joaqu√≠n Betancourt and Juan Manuel Ceruto. Paulito took over leadership of Opus 13 in the early 1990s, and changed the name of the group. In 1995 Paulito released Sofoc√°ndote, one of the most innovative recordings of the new dance genre timba. This was the first CD featuring his drummer Yoel P√°ez, one of Cuba's best. Paulito (El bueno soy yo) was released in 1996. It features Sergio Noro√±a (piano), Yosvel Bernal (synthesizer keyboard), Joel Dom√≠nguez (bass), Tom√°s Cruz (congas), and Yoel P√°ez (drums). In 1997 he released Con la conciencia tranquila, considered by many to be his masterpiece (Moore 2011: web) The piano guajeos were individually constructed for each song. Joel Dom√≠nguez' bass-playing was both rhythmically aggressive and significantly melodic. Dom√≠nguez's bass lines were one of the major elements after the vocal choruses, giving the music its distinctive contrapuntal character. Creatively incorporating elements from different folkloric sources, the conga tumbaos of Tom√°s Cruz interlocks with the timbales/drumset hybrid parts created by Yoel P√°ez. The horn-playing and Ceruto's charts were also remarkable. Una vez m√°s...por amor (2001) was a continuation of Paulito's most creative period. The album marked the end of his collaboration with Juan Ceruto, with half of the songs arranged by Ceruto and the other half after his departure. Personnel included Mauricio Herrera (drums), Jorge \\"El Toro\\" Castillo (congas), Crist√≥bal Verdecia (bass), and Rolando Luna (piano). ==Musical significance== Paulito FG is one of the most innovative Cuban timba artists. He spontaneously moves his rhythm section through various arrangement changes, created on the spot with specialized hand signals. All the while, he constantly dances, interacts with the crowd, and reinterprets his own lyrics. Paulito's bands broke new ground with a number of innovations. Some of the most significant contributions came from his conga drummer Tom√°s Cruz. Cruz's creations offered clever counterpoints to the bass and chorus. Many of his tumbaos span two or even four claves in duration, something very rarely done previously. He also made more use of muted tones in his tumbaos, all the while advancing the development of songo-type innovations created by Changuito and Ra√∫l \\"el Yulo\\" C√°rdenas of Los Van Van. The example on the right is one of Cruz's inventos ('musical inventions'), a band adaptation of the Congolese- based Afro-Cuban folkloric rhythm makuta. He played the pattern on three congas for the Paulito song \\"Llamada an√≥nima.\\" ==Cultural significance== Like other timberos, Paulito takes the contemporary speech of the street and places it into the refrains of his estribillos (choruses). Paulito considers the estribillo to be a synthesis of his overall message, and \\"the secret lies in the treatment of the estribillo inside the literary body of the song‚Äù (Vaughan 2010: 752). Paulito stated that during Cuba's economic crisis of the mid-1990s, known as the Special Period, timba music provided an opportunity ‚Äúto forget the shortages, the cutoff electricity, the bad transportation, to find refuge‚Äù (Vaughan 2012: 10). At the same time, timba, the first internationalized Cuban dance craze in decades, brought much needed tourist dollars into Havana. Over time, timba musicians sought to obtain some of the wealth they were earning for state institutions. They began to dress in a more flashy, hip-hop style, emulating the economic aspirations of many struggling Cubans. This led to the state withdrawing its support, and becoming hostile to the timba movement. Paulito: Paulito FG is a supporter of the Castro Regime and shares ties with many of the generals that serve in the Cuban Military. > There was a time during the special period when we [los timberos] were an > important economic help for the Revolution, but later this changed‚Äîprecisely > because of the great demand we had created‚Äîthis became something that was > frowned upon in a society like this one (2003 Paulito interview.

Actually, can I start that again? Everyone deserves a death.\\" Bristol, England, present day: Annie muses on her current situation. She's a young woman who also happens to be a ghost, killed after a fall in her home. As her family, friends and fianc√© move on without her, she haunts her former house. Unable to either communicate or even effectively make herself known to the succession of tenants who rent it, she is close to succumbing to \\"the worst thing about being a ghost... It's lonely. You'll give anything for that crumb of comfort. That feel of skin against skin that says, 'It's okay. I'm here.' It's a hunger. The most basic instinct.\\" Her voiceover plays over scenes of her loneliness. However, Annie is not alone in her terrible separation from humanity. Two young men each have a similar, related problem. Mitchell, a former young soldier, is now a vampire for whom \\"death isn't the end, but the beginning\\" and who harbours terrible guilt over his victims. George is a reluctant werewolf, whom Annie describes as being among \\"the ones that should have died. But shattered and bloody, they walk away from the train wreck. But what's the cost? They're scarred. Transformed. They're monsters now too. Aberrations. The stuff of nightmares. The big bad wolf.\\" (In parallel intercuts, the viewer is shown Mitchell's recruitment and awakening as a vampire, and George's survival of a werewolf attack followed by a scene of his transformation from man to wolf: also shown is Mitchell's killing of a young woman, Lauren, by draining her blood.) Annie continues her monologue: \\"So here we are. Overlooked and forgotten. Unnatural and... supernatural. Watching the dance from the sidelines... What have we got left to look forward to? Us refugees? The flotsam and jetsam of death. Maybe, if we still deserve such a thing as mercy, we find each other.\\" The final scenes are of Mitchell and George, already friends, preparing to move into Annie's house. From inside, Annie watches them through the window. She smiles her first genuine, hopeful smile. Main episode Mitchell has trouble restraining his blood lust in the present and has to deal with its consequences in the past. Herrick, the local vampire king, is trying to cajole him back into the vampire fold, reasoning that Mitchell's legendary reputation will inspire other vampires. Herrick has also recruited the most recent victim of Mitchell's intermittent blood lust, Lauren, as a vampire; and she comes to see Mitchell with vengeance on her mind. Annie must deal with her past: most specifically, the fact that her former fianc√© Owen (also the owner of the house where she, Mitchell and George live) is now engaged to her former rival Janie Harris. When Owen comes to visit his tenants at the house, Annie must deal with the fact that he cannot see her - and with her own feelings. George finds that he no longer has a safe place to transform when the hospital renovates the basement storage room he has been using up until now. With Mitchell's help, he tries to use the woods but finds them full of people: the only safe place to transform is at home, although he smashes the furniture and upsets his housemates.

The roles of Mitchell, Annie, Herrick and Lauren were all recast. This was partially due to the longer-than-usual waiting period between pilot episode and formally committed series (resulting in some of the original actors becoming unavailable) and partially due to a shift in tone for which other actors were better suited. Compared to the pilot, producer Matthew Bouch described the series as \\"less gothic and slightly more rooted\\" as well as \\"a bit funnier\\"; he also described the series as \\"kind of a reboot\\" of the pilot. These factors resulted in a distinct change in tone from the pilot episode. Annie (now played by Lenora Crichlow) was an ostensibly sunnier and more scatterbrained character than had been suggested by the more awkward, dour characterisation from Andrea Riseborough in the pilot; while Aidan Turner's take on Mitchell was more relaxed and smooth in presentation. Most notably, the recast Herrick (originally played by Adrian Lester) was altered in multiple respects including speech style, race and general demeanour. Originally an elegant, reserved and stylish vampire monarch, the new portrayal by Jason Watkins reinvented Herrick as a pudgy, avuncular middle-aged vampire working as a police sergeant, with a friendly manner masking a vicious streak. ==Relationship with pilot episode== Although Flotsam and Jetsam is the first episode of Being Human (and for most long-term viewers, the set-up episode to the show) it was preceded one year previously by a pilot episode, later titled The Monsters Within. Series creator Toby Whithouse has stated that he considers the story and events in The Monsters Within to be canonical, even though the production style and casting were noticeably different. The events of The Monsters Within precede those of Flotsam and Jetsam by an unspecified period, but probably no more than days or weeks as Mitchell's killing of Lauren and its immediate aftermath is still relatively recent. The cold open of Flotsam and Jetsam restated, in a highly compressed form, several events and plot elements either shown or referred to The Monsters Within. These included the attack which infected George with the werewolf condition (and his subsequent transformation) and Mitchell's attack on Lauren. It also introduced elements not covered in The Monsters Within, including Mitchell's own recruitment into the vampire world by Herrick and greater illustration (via montage) of Annie's experiences of loneliness, resentment and disaffection following her own death. Several scenes from The Monsters Within were recreated or adapted for the main body of the episode. These included the scene in which Mitchell warns off Seth from entering the hospital (which was mostly unaltered) and the scene in which Herrick notifies Mitchell of the coming vampire takeover and the need for Mitchell to pick a side (which was scripted, staged and played with an entirely different tone and no longer involved Lauren). Some of the other events and scenes which took place in The Monsters Within were neither recreated nor referred to in Flotsam and Jetsam. Notably, there was no attempt to restage the initial meeting of Mitchell, George and Annie (the main episode began with all three relatively comfortably established as housemates), George and Mitchell's original application for jobs at the Bristol hospital, or Herrick's sumptuously staged address to the vampires in the Bristol basement. Some of the content of the latter (which was now too grandiose for the new conception of the character) was reworked into dialogue within \\"walk-and-talk\\" scenes between Herrick and Mitchell in and around the hospital grounds. The subplot of George's abandonment of his former girlfriend Julie and her attempts to confront him over it (which had been central to The Monsters Within) was jettisoned. It was not denied or explicitly contradicted over the course of the subsequent series, but nor was it ever referred to again, and Julie would not return to the series. George would refer only in the most general sense to those he'd had to leave behind, and viewers would not encounter anyone from George's previous life until Daddy Ghoul (the sixth episode of Series 3, which focussed specifically on George's parents). The abandonment of this subplot also meant the loss of a significant scene in which George confronted Julie's abusive new boyfriend Peter and succeeded in intimidating him while also holding off his own werewolf urge to kill and eat. Abandoning the Julie story also meant not recreating the climactic sequence in The Monsters Within (during which Julie confronts George in his safe room just as he is due to transform, unaware that she is risking her life, and in which Annie has to intervene to save Julie). This sequence had established Annie's conquering of her own ghost-fear (presented as being similar to agoraphobia) of leaving her own place of death. Annie's development of greater confidence and abilities, including the ability to leave her home and travel further afield, was developed at a slower pace over the course of Series 1. ==References== Category:2009 British television episodes Category:Being Human (TV series) episodes Category:Television episodes written by Toby Whithouse ","title":"Series 1, Episode 1 (Being Human)"},{"id":"35310075","text":"Medieval stone moulds are well represented in the Herbert Art Gallery & Museum in Coventry with over 169 examples.

The method is based on the combination of a unilateral Laplace transformation with the real-valued and positive transform parameter and the slowness field representation. It is named after Louis Cagniard and Adrianus de Hoop; Cagniard published his method in 1939, and de Hoop published an ingenious improvement on it in 1960.De Hoop, A.

Thanks to its versatility, however, the technique has become popular in other disciplines and is nowadays widely accepted as the benchmark for the computation of wavefields in layered media. In its applications to calculating wavefields in general N-layered stratified media, the Cagniard-De Hoop technique is also known as the generalized ray theory. The complete generalized-ray theory, including the pertaining wave-matrix formalism for the layered medium with arbitrary point sources, has been developed by de Hoop (with his students) for acoustics waves,De Hoop, A.

The Danish claim to the island stems from Norse settlement of southern Greenland which lasted from the 980s till the 15th century. Scholars believe that the earliest known Norse settlements in Greenland originated from Iceland. Scholars believe that Erik the Red founded an early colony in 985. Icelandic control of Greenland is estimated to have lasted until 1261. The Kingdom of Norway later claimed and controlled Greenland singularly from roughly 1261‚Äì1319. These Norse settlements vanished during the 14th and early 15th centuries,\\"Why societies collapse\\". ABC Science. with the Inuit people being the sole occupants of the island, expanding to the southern and western coasts, and being de facto independent for over 200 years until European colonization resumed. Despite this, a de jure continuing European possession of Greenland was assumed by European powers. European colonization in the 18th ‚Äì 20th centuries European contact with Greenland was not re-established until 1721 with the mission of Hans Egede, which were followed by the Moravian missions. These established enduring colonies and ‚Äî after failing to find the Norse peoples ‚Äî attempted to Christianize the Inuit. By this time Norway and Denmark had been unified under Denmark‚ÄìNorway which considered Greenland part of its territory. This ended on 14 January 1814 after Norway was ceded from Denmark as a result of the Napoleonic Wars in Europe. As a result of the Treaty of Kiel, Denmark gained full colonial control of Greenland soon after. From 1814‚Äì1953, Greenland was a colony, not independent and not part of Denmark, but directly controlled by the Danish government. American protectorate and occupation During the Second World War, Denmark was occupied and controlled by Nazi Germany between 1940 and 1945. As a result, the Danish and US governments signed an agreement to hand over defense and control of Greenland to the United States on 9 April 1941. (the Danish government was represented by the Danish ambassador to the US, as the US did not recognize the Nazi government of Denmark). The first troops arrived in Greenland on 7 July 1941. The US-built two airports with full-length runways, which as of 2018 still are the main international airports of Greenland; however, they are located far away from any traditional settlement. Greenland was effectively independent during these years and allowed the United States to build bases on its territory, in spite of the Danish pre-war neutrality. After the war the pre- war situation was restored, the US bases remained and Denmark, with Greenland as a part of the Kingdom, joined NATO. == Moves towards independence == In 1953 a new Danish Constitution incorporated Greenland in Denmark, the island thereby gained representation in the Danish Parliament and was recognized as a Danish province known as the County of Greenland. In 1979 the Danish government granted Greenland home rule, with Denmark keeping control of a number of areas including foreign relations, defense, currency matters and the legal system in Greenland. In 2008 Greenland's citizens approved the Greenlandic self-government referendum with a 75% vote in favor of a higher degree of autonomy. Greenland took control of law enforcement, the coast guard, and the legal system. The official language changed from Danish to Greenlandic on 21 June 2009, Greenland national day. The act gives control of foreign relations of Greenland to the island in trade and other areas it is responsible for. Greenland has representatives in Copenhagen, Brussels, Reykjavik, and Washington, D.C. As part of the self-rule law of 2009 (section ¬ß21), Greenland can declare full independence if they wish to pursue it, but it would have to be approved by a referendum among the Greenlandic people. A poll in 2016 showed that there was a clear majority (64%) for full independence among the Greenlandic people, but a poll in 2017 showed that there was a clear opposition (78%) if it meant a fall in living standards. Greenland's former prime minister, Kuupik Kleist, has repeatedly expressed the need to diversify Greenland's economy, which mainly relies on fishery, tourism and a substantial annual block grant from the Danish state. The block grant equals about two-thirds of Greenland's government budget or about one-quarter of the entire GDP of Greenland. Economic stability is seen as a basis for full political independence from Denmark. When Kim Kielsen was reelected with a strong majority as the leader of the largest Greenlandic pro-independence party Siumut in 2017, observers considered it a win for the \\"slow- independence\\" faction instead of the \\"now-independence\\" faction. (His opponent, Vittus Qujaukitsoq, had argued for independence even if it meant losing the large annual block grant from the Danish state.) During a debate in the Danish Parliament (which also includes members from Greenland) in 2018, Danish Prime Minister Lars L√∏kke said that Greenland needs to make it clear if they wish to remain a part of the Kingdom or become independent. If Greenland were to become an independent country, the annual block grant from Denmark to Greenland would cease. In 2008, independence campaigners touted the year 2021 (the 300th anniversary of Danish colonial rule) as a date for potential independence. ==See also== *History of Greenland *1979 Greenlandic home rule referendum *Faroese independence movement *Icelandic independence movement *Norwegian independence movement ==References== Independence Category:Independence movements ","title":"Greenlandic independence"},{"id":"35310280","text":"A Map for England is an initiative launched in March 2012 by the Royal Town Planning Institute (RTPI), the UK body that represents 23,000 planning professionals, to make publicly available major maps for England relating to policies and programmes on the economy, transport, communications, housing and the environment that are held by individual government departments. The Institute argues that there is still no single place or data source within government that makes all of these maps available to view. A Map for England is designed to help policy makers make better judgments about how individual policy proposals interact with and affect development of the country as a whole through better spatial planning. It would also, it is claimed, increase consistency in appraisal, improve security and resilience, and provide a better understanding of sectoral issues that might complement or conflict with each other. ==Research findings== The RTPI commissioned a study from the University of Manchester examining a broad range of existing government policies and how they relate to each other. To reach their conclusions, the researchers from the University's Centre for Urban Policy Studies examined government web sites, individual policy documents and large numbers of reports to find policies and programmes that have strong ‚Äòspatial‚Äô aspects to them: policies which potentially have a different impact in different parts of the country. It was a major task in itself to pull together almost 100 policy maps. In about one third of these documents the researchers found that implications for different places are made explicit but in fully two thirds they are not. By overlaying a number of these maps and diagrams together, the researchers demonstrated that some policies and programmes, when considered against each other in relation to different parts of the country, may have unintended consequences. For example, the study revealed that there is considerable overlap between broad areas where housing growth is projected in the future and where there are the greatest environmental and policy constraints to growth. These constraints include the risk of flooding and expected future household water shortages. ==References== Category:Town and country planning in England ","title":"Map for England"},{"id":"35310288","text":"Bhekumuzi Luthuli (13 July 1961 - 7 April 2010) was a well known South African Maskandi musician.

The son of Sir Thomas, John was fined and imprisoned for Recusancy under Elizabeth. John Giffard (1534‚Äì1613) was a Staffordshire landowner and Member of the English Parliament, notable as a leader of Roman Catholic Recusancy in the reigns of Elizabeth I and James I. ==Background and early life== John Giffard's father was Sir Thomas Giffard of Caverswall Castle. The Giffard's had their seat at Chillington Hall, near Brewood, from the late 12th century.Victoria County History, volume 5, chapter 8, s.3. Sir Thomas, like his father, Sir John Giffard, had considerably expanded the family estates until they were the wealthiest landed gentry family in Staffordshire. Sir John was still alive when his grandson John was born, so Thomas Giffard was living at Caverswall, which he had acquired through his first wife, the heiress Dorothy Montgomery. Both Sir John and Sir Thomas were MPs of religiously conservative disposition, although both had generally acquiesced in the legislation that carried through the English Reformation. John Giffard's mother was Ursula Throckmorton, daughter of Robert Throckmorton of Coughton Court, Warwickshire, and Elizabeth Baynham. She was Thomas Giffard's second wife: Dorothy had died by 1529, leaving Thomas with a daughter, but no surviving sons. He married Ursula in 1529. She was part of a wealthy landowning family, generally of a similar religious conservative outlook to the Giffards. Her brother, George Throckmorton, was MP for Warwickshire in the English Reformation Parliament, elected in 1529. His sympathies were strongly Catholic and he was arrested in 1537, in the aftermath of the Pilgrimage of Grace, with which he was thought to sympathise. He made a rambling and confused confession of his part in the Catholic opposition, narrowly escaping with his life.The History of Parliament: Members 1509‚Äì1558 ‚Äì THROCKMORTON, Sir George (Author: S. M. Thorpe) In 1539, when John was still a child, Thomas Giffard bought the site of Black Ladies Priory, a dissolved Benedictine nunnery near Brewood.Victoria County History, volume 5, chapter 8, s.4. Shortly after, the family moved into the house,Giffard of Chillington at Ancestry.co.uk which Thomas had rebuilt as fine Tudor brick residence, set on a moated site, with fishponds. At about the age of 16, John Giffard married Joyce Leveson, and their first child, Walter, was born about a year into the marriage. By the age of 21, he was considered ready for parliament.The History of Parliament: Members 1509‚Äì1558 ‚Äì GIFFARD, John (Author: A. D.K. Hawkyard) ==Parliamentary career== John Giffard was first elected to as Member of Parliament for Lichfield in the first parliament of Queen Mary I's reign, opened on 5 October 1553, four days after her coronation. Lichfield had been a parliamentary constituency in the Middle Ages, but had lost the right to elect MPs, only regaining it in 1547, after a gap of almost two hundred years.The History of Parliament: Constituencies 1509‚Äì1558 ‚Äì Lichfield (Author: N. M. Fuidge) The main influence on the selection of MPs was William Paget, 1st Baron Paget, who had been a close supporter of the regime of the Protector Somerset. Humiliated at Somerset's fall, he was one of the Privy Councillors who escaped from custody to recognise Mary as Queen during the succession crisis of summer 1553. He ensured that Lichfield returned MPs he could rely on. Giffard's senior colleague was Sir Philip Draycott, a friend of Paget who had shared his political fortunes.The History of Parliament: Members 1509‚Äì1558 ‚Äì DRAYCOTT, Sir Philip (Author: Alan Davidson) Giffard himself was an obvious supporter of the Catholic Queen, with excellent connections in Staffordshire and neighbouring counties. Giffard was able to travel up to London with his father, Thomas, who was elected to the same parliament as member for Staffordshire. Mary's first parliament legislated for a return to Catholic practice in the churches, reversing the reforms of Edward VI's reign to return the situation to that at the end of Henry VIII's. It did not restore links with the Papacy, and it set landowners minds at rest by leaving the monasteries and chantries dissolved.Whitelock, Anna (2009): Mary Tudor: England's First Queen, London: Bloomsbury, The Giffards accepted these measures, which were fully in line with their own beliefs. The parliament lasted just two months and the members were home for Christmas. Giffard was also elected to the next parliament, which assembled in April 1554. This time he represented the borough of Stafford. This time he was returned first in order of precedence, with Humphrey Swynnerton, husband of his aunt Cassandra Giffard,The History of Parliament: Members 1509‚Äì1558 ‚Äì SWYNNERTON, Humphrey (Author: A. D.K. Hawkyard) as his colleague. Swynnerton was an intensely pious Catholic, who spent much of his limited wealth on rebuilding the church at Shareshill.Victoria County History, volume 5, chapter 22, s.7. Elections at Stafford took place among a small circle of burgesses, chaired by the bailiff.The History of Parliament: Constituencies 1509‚Äì1558 ‚Äì Stafford (Author: N. M. Fuidge) The returning officer at Stafford was the High Sheriff of Staffordshire, at that time Thomas Giffard himself, completing the indenture in Latin for his own son and brother-in-law. This parliament was even shorter, lasting just a month. Its main business was to pass the Act for the Marriage of Queen Mary to Philip of Spain and the constitutionally important Act concerning Regal Power. The latter gave parliamentary authority to a queen regnant in England for the first time. Once again, there was no prospect of a Giffard opposing the queen's wishes. ==Landowner and recusant== John Giffard's father, Sir Thomas Giffard, did not inherit the family estates until 1556. He died only four years later, leaving John with very large holdings across the southern half of Staffordshire and in Derbyshire, although the focus remained Brewood parish, where the Giffards had their seat at Chillington. John's brother Humphrey was provided for by Sir Thomas, having Black Ladies for the rest of his life, with the reversion to John. In fact, Humphrey outlived John, and it was to Walter, his heir, that Black Ladies returned. With the family generally well-provided for, and the advantage still of youth, John's fortunes appeared assured, apart from the religious issue, which was to dog the Giffards for generations. Initially, the accession of Elizabeth I in 1558 did not affect the Giffards greatly. The queen rapidly moved to reassert a Protestant monarchy and Church of England. However, there was no inquisition into Catholic's beliefs, only practice, and the authorities were long tolerant of offences of omission. Many who began as recusants gradually drifted into conformity. John did not succeed his father as Justice of the Peace until 1573, the same year he was pricked High Sheriff of Staffordshire. Both these offices required taking the Oath of Supremacy, swearing to accept the monarch as \\"the only supreme governor of this realm, and of all other her Highness's dominions and countries, as well in all spiritual or ecclesiastical things or causes, as temporal.\\" Imposed by the Act of Supremacy 1558, failure to meet this requirement more than once had been turned into a treasonable offence by a further act of 1562. In trusting him with public office, the regime was clearly signalling its wish to co-opt John Giffard into the county's ruling elite. His behaviour on that occasion probably gave rise to suspicion, but it was only two years later that matters took a serious turn for the worse. Prayer book of 1559, which John Giffard was expected to use. In 1575 the Queen visited Staffordshire and, on her progress through the county, stayed at Chillington early in August. Giffard promised to attend worship at the parish church, but Elizabeth herself noticed that he was not present,Citation needed as he should have been according to the Act of Uniformity 1558, the other main pillar of the Elizabethan Religious Settlement. Just three days later he was summoned by the Privy Council to explain himself. He was interviewed by four bishops and then placed in the custody of Edmund Freke, the Bishop of Rochester, a particularly zealous heresy-hunter. However, Chillington needed work after the royal stay, so Giffard was soon granted leave to return there to reorder his home. Soon after, he was formally released from custody on condition that he attend church and use the Prayer Book even in his private chapel. However, Giffard continued to avoid parish worship. As a result, his estates were sequestered by the Crown and he was placed under house arrest, confined to his own homes in London or at Chillington. The only exception to this regime was for licensed visits to the spa at King's Newnham, near Rugby, Warwickshire. Despite this treatment at the hands of the State, Giffard remained, in his own way, entirely loyal. In 1588, when the country was threatened by Spanish invasion, he took the oath of allegiance and sent men to serve in the army. However, the main factor in mitigating Giffard's later treatment by the authorities was his son Gilbert's role in betraying the Babington Plot. Gilbert had gone to France in 1577, hoping to train for the Catholic priesthood. He became involved in a plot to assassinate Elizabeth I and install her Catholic cousin Mary, Queen of Scots on the throne. He thus linked up with Charles Paget, the son of Baron Paget, who was already a double agent working for Sir Francis Walsingham, head of the queen's intelligence operation. On his return to England, late in 1585, Giffard was arrested at Rye, East Sussex, and agreed to act as a double agent for Walsingham, taking the alias No. 4. His information and activities proved vital, allowing Walsingham to penetrate Mary's correspondence with the French ambassador. He subsequently went absent without leave and was arrested by the forces of the Catholic League in a Paris brothel, together with an English prostitute and a man who claimed to be a retainer of the Earl of Essex.Letter of Sir Edward Stafford to Walsingham, 15 December 1587 in Calendar of State Papers Foreign, Elizabeth, Volume 21, Part 1: 1586‚Äì1588 Imprisoned for 20 years, he died during the siege of Paris in 1590. It is not certain what Gilbert's motives were. The authorities considered him \\"the most notable double, treble villain that ever lived.\\"Letter of Sir Edward Stafford to Walsingham, January 1588, Calendar of State Papers Foreign, Elizabeth, Volume 21, Part 1: 1586‚Äì1588 Nevertheless, attitudes to his family softened and the restrictions on John Giffard were relaxed in his later years. However, the Giffard fortunes were damaged severely by the recusancy of John and his successors. He did what he could to dispose of his estates before his death, and made his will on 27 August 1613, paying off debts and leaving small bequests to servants. He died the following day and was buried in the Church of St Mary and St Chad in Brewood. ==Marriage and family== Tomb of John Gifard and Joyce Leveson, showing some of their children. John Giffard married Joyce Leveson on 10 April 1550. she was the daughter of James Leveson of Lilleshall, a wealthy Wolverhampton businessman, one of the Merchants of the Staple who had the monopoly of wool exports from England. Leveson had made a fortune not only from trade but also from leasing the property of St Peter's Collegiate Church in Wolverhampton:Victoria County History ‚Äì Staffordshire: Vol. 3, chapter. 44: in 1550, James's cousin John and Robert Brooke took on most of the college property at fixed low rents on perpetual leases ‚Äì a ruse by the prebendaries to profit doubly from the dissolution of the institution.

Hooke, The Landscape of Anglo-Saxon Staffordshire: the charter evidence (Keele University 1983: Department of Adult Education), 29 66 70-2. but in 1086, it was waste, because of the king's forest.Domesday Book, f.247d. Haswic became Ashwood Hay, one of three hays (hedged hunting areas) of Kinver Forest. The hay was managed by a bailiff, who occupied the farm of Prestwood by the sergeanty of keeping the bailiwick of Ashwood Hay. This belonged to a family who took their name from the estate, and owned the estate for over a century until Richard de Prestwood granted it to William son of Adam de Chetwynd in 1292. William granted it to Agnes widow of Roger de Somery of Dudley Castle and her son. On the death of John de Somery in 1322, it was described as half a carucate and some meadow, but on the death of Roger de Hilary in 1357, it consisted of a messuage, a virgate and 10 acres of meadow, though it is not clear why it should have been his, as it long continued to be the property of the lords of Dudley Castle. It thus came into the hands of John Dudley, Duke of Northumberland, the Lord Protector to Edward VI, but was attainted of high treason following the accession of Queen Mary.This is based on various documents listed in Calendars of Patent Rolls, Calendars of Inquisitions Post Mortem, and so on. In 1554, the estate was granted by the queen to Edward Hastynges, who quickly sold it to Sir John Lyttelton. In 1597, there was a dispute between his son Gilbert Lyttelton and Edward Sutton, 5th Baron Dudley, as owner of Ashwood Hay. This seems to have related to the boundary between Ashwood Hay and Prestwood Hill (which was open to it) and whether Lyttelton had the right to graze cattle on Ashwood Hay (by then a common. This resulted in Star Chamber proceedings and was part of a political dispute between the two families at the same date. Gilbert's son John Lyttelton died in prison, having been attainted for complicity in Essex' rebellion, so that his estates were forfeited. Most of his estates were restored by James I to his widow Merriel, but only in 1618, did she regain Prestwood (now described as a manor). Three years later it was sold to Sir Edward Sebright, 1st Baronet, for ¬£3,000. His son sold it to Thomas Foley the great ironmaster, who settled it on his youngest son Philip Foley.This is partly based on estate title deeds, in the Foley collection at Herefordshire Record Office. Philip Foley rebuilt the house as a mansion, which remained the family home of his descendants for over 250 years, passing to his son Paul, his grandson William, and great grandson (also William). On the death of the great-grandson, it passed to his sister Elizabeth Foley, who married John Hodgetts of Shut End. Their only child Eliza Maria Foley Hodgetts in 1790 married her distant cousin Hon. Edward Foley. Under their marriage settlement the Prestwood estate passed to her second son John Hodgetts-Foley and then to his son Henry Hodgetts-Foley. Henry's son Paul Henry Foley inherited the Stoke Edith estate on the death of Lady Emily Foley, but sold most of the Prestwood estate in the 1920s.The descent from the 1670s is much the same as the manor of Kinver: Victoria County History: Staffordshire, XX, 130. ==Prestwood Hospital== Prestwood House was subsequently used as a tuberculosis sanatorium.

The statue and its basin date to the Nara period and have been designated National Treasures. ==Subject== The birth of Shaka, the historical Buddha (Sanskrit: SiddhƒÅrtha Gautama or ≈öƒÅkyamuni), is one of the eight major events in the life of the Buddha that formed a popular subject for artistic representation. While MƒÅyƒÅ was walking in the Lumbinƒ´ gardens and had stopped to pick flowers, the Buddha is said to have emerged from her right side. According to the Dƒ´rghƒÅgama S≈´tra, the young prince immediately took seven steps in the four directions and declared \\"in the Heavens and on Earth, only I am the Venerable One\\".Â§©‰∏äÂ§©‰∏ãÂîØÊàëÁã¨Â∞ä (tenj≈ç tenga yuiga dokuson); as a modern idiom these words are sometimes used to satirize self-aggrandizing conceit The Lalitavistara relates that the infant was then bathed by two nƒÅga, Nanda and Upananda, serpent deities or Dragon Kings. The Sutra on the meritorious action of bathing the Buddha's image was translated into Chinese in 710. Reenacting the legend of the Buddha's birth, the annual rite known as kanbutsu-e (\\"rite of sprinkling the Buddha\\", more popularly hana matsuri or \\"flower festival\\") sees the bathing of small Buddha statues amidst garlands of flowers. Perfumed water was once used but, since the nineteenth century, this has generally been replaced by sweet hydrangea tea known as amacha.Amacha was also used to sweeten beverages, before the introduction of sugar to Japan in the seventeenth century; mixed with ink it is used to write on paper that is the glued to the wall of houses to ward off insects Another variant sees the image repeatedly wiped with a silk cloth rather than anointed. Celebrations of the Buddha's birth have been staged in Japan on the eighth day of the fourth month since Empress Suiko ordered that vegetarian feasts should be held in all the temples in 606. Kanbutsu-e or \\"sprinkling\\" ceremonies are known to have been held at the Seiry≈çden, led by a priest from Gang≈ç-ji, in 840 and the Engi shiki lists the utensils used at these Palace ceremonies. Earlier temple records and inventories of their treasures list kanbutsuz≈ç or \\"images for sprinkling\\" at H≈çry≈´-ji and Daian-ji, and early surviving examples include one dating to the Asuka period at in Aichi Prefecture (Important Cultural Property). This example at T≈çdai-ji is generally dated to the 750s. At T≈çdai- ji today, a is erected each year before the Daibutsuden (Great Buddha Hall). This National Treasure Shaka at Birth was still used in the ceremony when Langdon Warner was writing in the late 1950s and indeed as late as the 1980s. More recently it has been replaced with a copy. ==Statue== Evoking the legend of his birth, the statue of the infant Buddha has its right arm raised, pointing to heaven, and left arm pendant, pointing to the earth; he is bare chested and wears a skirt. The elongated earlobes and spiral-shaped curls of hair, resembling snail-shells, are among the eighty secondary physical characteristics of the Buddha. The deep ridges on both body and arms \\"emphasize the fleshiness\\" of the smiling child's body. The soft, rounded, \\"sweet-faced\\" features of the young Buddha have been likened to those of the celestial musicians on the roughly contemporary octagonal lantern erected in front of the T≈çdai-ji Daibutsuden. The original pedestal on which the image stands has been lost and replaced with a small wooden base carved with lotus petals. ==Basin== Like the statue, the basin or kanbutsuban is the largest of its type known. The exterior has incised images of human figures, animals real and imaginary, birds, and butterflies, set against a landscape of flowers, grasses, shrubs, trees, mountain peaks, clouds, and pagodas. Images of hermits with banners riding on birds, barbarians in foreign garb astride Chinese lions, and hunters chasing tigers are similar to motifs found on metalwork in T≈çdai-ji's celebrated repository the Sh≈çs≈çin. Much of this decoration is secular rather than Buddhist in inspiration. Like the statue, the basin shows the influence of contemporary Tang China. ==Technology== Both statue and basin are of gilt bronze, cast using the lost-wax method. The statue was cast in one piece, other than for the right forearm which is a restoration; the join is clearly visible. Pieces of the clay core were left inside after casting. The decorative motifs on the outside of the basin were engraved and the background of dots hammered with a burin in the technique known as . Both statue and bowl are recognized as masterpieces of eighth-century metalwork. ==See also== * List of National Treasures of Japan (sculptures) * Hanamatsuri * Vesak * T≈çdai-ji ==NotesReferences== Category:National Treasures of Japan Category:Japanese sculpture Category:Bronze sculptures in Japan Category:Buddha statues in Japan ","title":"Shaka at Birth (T≈çdai-ji)"},{"id":"35310556","text":"Hon.

Exemplary of a personal contribution is Brewster Kneen's 2014 memoir Journey of an Unrepentant Socialist, chronicling his own forays and deepening/widening radicalization into Canadian issues and concluding that socialism can be the only commendable framework of analysis and resolution. A significant resource for discerning the liberation theme in Canadian works are the writings of those in inner-city or urban ministry. While the \\"liberation\\" term may not be readily present intimations abound. Representative are Tim Dickau's Plunging into the Kingdom: Practicing the Shared Strokes of Community, Hospitality, Justice, and Confession (2010) and Barry K. Morris' (co-editor) The Word on the Street:: Invitation to Community Ministry in Canada; Hopeful Realism in Urban Ministry; and a forthcoming A Faithful Public-Prophetic Witness: Pursuits and Pitfalls of \\"Success\\" in Canadian City Ministries. Then, there are personal memoirs from street ministries such as Greg Paul's God in the Alley; Jesse Zink's Grace at the Garbage Dump; Tim Huff's Bent Hope: A Street Journal; Al Tysick' preface to Out in the Open: Life on the Street; and not all, the 1970s Norm Ellis' My Parish is Revolting. Another valued body of writings arises from recent reflections on First Nations' history, especially the challenges to contextualize the consequences of colonization and major inquiries or commissions on the ill effects of residential schools and murdered and missing women. Suggestive of the liberation theme therein are Art Manuel's Unsettling Canada: A National Wake-up Call and Mennonite historian and theologian Steve Heinrichs' Buffalo Shout, Salmon Cry: Conversations on Creation, Land Justice, and Life Together and, not all, Unsettling the Word: Biblical Experiments in Decolonization. Some Canadian theologians have felt animated but then chastened by the earlier -- and perhaps enduring -- thrusts of liberation theology especially when it embraced Marxist analysis and even its philosophical and political prescriptions (where a virtual monopoly of the economy by a centralized if not authoritarian political structure was evident if not commended). The emergence of Christian or theological realism was instrumental in this outcome, which seems dominant today - despite occasional Canadian efforts to distinguish \\"realism\\" from its USA sources and spokespersons. To an extent, Canadian adoption of community organizing models and actual staff input via the Industrial Areas Foundation illustrate the incorporation of realism combined with liberation themes. Does one wonder if this is the best that can be achieved? However, if the social historian and investigative journalist, par excellent, Naomi Klein, is correct and prophetically apt, then the fierce conflict -- and kairos moment -- between the climate and capitalism may well provoke revisiting and posing a constructive critique of any constrained political posture that could be deemed normative. The liberation thrust remains active. See thus Klein's This Changes Everything: Capitalism versus The Climate and On Fire: The Burning Case fora Green New Deal (dedicated to the above Arthur Manuel). Further research could unearth: National denominational staff persons of Canada's once mainstream Christian denominations who have contributed aspects of the liberation theme in their occasional reports and committee work to produce resolutions to their national assemblies (and beyond). They would include the late Robert Lindsey of the United Church of Canada; Don. Brown of the Anglican Church in Canada as well as their late primate Ted Scott; the late RC Bishop of Victoria, BC, Remi De Roo; and doubtlessly, others in the Presbyterian Church; the Mennonite churches; the Baptists; and Religious Society of Friends or Quakers. More research may well uncover book or article titles on these figures and their earnest contributions. Publications have also exhibited liberation themes, many of them sadly defunct - such as the Catholic New Times, Practice of Ministry in Canada, and The Grail -- but thankfully Geez: Contemplative Cultural Resistance lives on (with its Manitoba roots). == See also == * Liberation theology * Religion in Canada == References ==  Footnotes  Bibliography : Category:Christianity in Canada Category:Liberation theology ","title":"Liberation theology in Canada"},{"id":"35310596","text":"Djamel Benchergui (born 7 December 1981) is an Algerian professional footballer.

The settlers were former Cossacks Kompaniiskyi regiments. They had been Hetman light cavalry, whose were guarding the southern and western borders and providing an intelligence service. Probably this happened after the reform of October 24, 1775. Before the soldiers arrived, there were farmers growing wheat, rye, barley and oats and raising livestock. The lands and the peasants farming them were taken over by the nobility in 1782. Military reform caused a significant settlement of former Kompaniian. After retirement they were assigned to a particular social status, such as (Burghers, peasants or Cossacks.

Pronounced Ndi√≤gfap in local language, this name means farmers of old vineyards.Although Bandrefam is the official name, the population of this chiefdom call themselves Kouo'shi,which means :emerging from the ground. This name will take the form of Fab'gwe around 1921, then of Ndi√≤gfap around 1928. Finally, the German colonists will call it Bandrefam, as it is known today. The Kouo'shi are Bamil√©k√© people (Semi-Bantu) who are descended from several generations of migrants from North Cameroon and whose origins could be traced back to Egypt during Pharaohs‚Äô time. Bandrefam is located about 300 km from Douala the commercial capital of Cameroon, about 300 km of Yaounde the political capital and 25 km from Bafoussam, the regional capital. At the administrative level, it is part of the Bayangam commune, in the Department of Koung-Khi in the West province of Cameroon. Since 2018 ,the Kingdom has been ruled by His Majesty Georges Jiejip Tchomgang, son of His Majesty Jiejip Pouokap who died in january 14, 2018 after an extensive illness. Georges Jiejip is the 105th King of a long dynasty founded by Fo Kaputse several centuries ago. The king is assisted in the exercise of his functions by Notables who sit in secret societies and neighborhood leaders. His Majesty Georges Jiejip Tchomgang, Chief Bandrefam ==History== Bandrefam is a several-century-old kingdom. It was founded between the 12th and 13th century. It is one of the oldest kingdoms in the Bamil√©k√© region. Because of inheritance quarrels between sons, this kingdom split up, leading to the creation of the chiefdoms Bangoua, Batoufam and Babouantou. During the previous centuries, Bandrefam suffered from numerous attacks from its neighbors. The most recent one is the nine-year war against the Bangoua chiefdom. This fratricidal war ended with the signing of a peace treaty (Pact of reconciliation and forgiveness) between the two chiefdoms on September 30, 2006. During the years of war, before and after the independence of Cameroon, Bandrefam got annihilated, like many other Bamil√©k√© chiefdoms, by Ahidjo‚Äôs repressive regime, backed by the French army.(see Bamil√©k√© genocideOwono, Julie (25 January 2012) http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2012/01/201211871746225899.html ). This repressive violence contributed to a significant destruction of the population by tens of thousands. The majority of the survivors were forced to go into exile. Most of them never came back. ==Geography== Bordered on the West and South-West by Bangoua, on the North by Batoufam and on the East by Bagang-Fokam, Bandrefam covers an area of about 17 square km divided in six districts : Ngouonkouong, Nka‚Äôala, Pou‚Äôguieu, Tchieu, Toula et Ntchi. Its relief is formed by plateaus (L√¥‚Äôoshit√¥, Tch√Æ, Sinkou√¥) and mountains (Kouofiog, Kouomenang) interspersed with fertile valleys rich in fine sand. Panch√™h and Wooze are the main rivers running through the village. The climate is tropical, characterized by a long dry season and a short rainy season.Regional Route(D63) crossing Bandrefam ==Population== The population of Bandrefam, relatively consistent, is estimated today at about five thousand (5000) inhabitants living in the kingdom‚Äôs area. But in the late 1960s, there was a wave of nomadic Mbororo pastoralists from Northern Cameroon in search of pasture for their cattle. Also noted, since the outbreak of the civil war in 2017 in the two English-speaking provinces, a migratory flow of civilians who have come to settle in the village, in search of refuge and land to cultivate. During harvesting time and funerals the population can increase substantially, because of relatives visiting temporarily from outside the kingdom.Downtown Bandrefam ==Language== Bandrefam is also a language and is part of the Bantu languages group, which in turn is part of the gigantic Niger‚ÄìCongo languages family. ==Religion== Kouo'shi people are usually attached to ancestral practices : the cult of the dead. The sacred place or ancestral place of worship is called Koupmb√¢, place where the \\"Shi\\" (God) is evoked and worshiped. \\"Shi Koupmb√¢\\" (God of Koupmb√¢ or God of the sacred place) is the expression commonly used to invoke his presence in case of misfortune, happiness or simply during a meeting between individuals. It is not uncommon to hear the following expressions:‚ÄúShi Koupmba Tchop N‚Äôzog Mo.‚Äù Translation: God of Koupmba, have mercy on us. Or, ‚ÄúShi Koupmba loo N‚Äôji. \\"Translation: May the God of Koupmba accompany you. A minority is either Christian or animist.Some churches got built, the main ones being the chapel of the Catholic Church and the parish of the Evangelistic Church of Cameroon. ==Economy== Subsistence farming, small livestock farming and handicraft are the main sources of income of the population. They generally grow peanuts, corn, potatoes, yam, manioc, plantain bananas but also small exploitations of substinence crops such as tomatoes, cabbage, watermelons, etc. Yam-Bandrefam-Cameroon They breed goats, sheep, and poultry for commercial purposes. Farming Arabica coffee is also part of the agricultural activities. Funerals is another significant commercial activity that create temporary jobs for unemployed people. Bandrefam has a local market where villagers go to sell their products. Since 2017, the international sustainable development network (Global Ecovillage Network) , locally called ‚ÄúKOUO'SHI NDAMNZ√ô‚Äù - which means ‚ÄúKouo'shi of the future‚Äù or ‚ÄúBandrefam of the future‚Äù - settled in the village in the Nka'ala neighborhood.

The archeological site of K√πog fi√≤g, made up of several blocks of granite carved several centuries ago, located about 2 km away from the chiefdom, and the last remains of the Bana-Foumban road built by the Germans are other points of interest for tourists. Before the fire of May 29, 1961 caused by the Ahidjo regime after independence and the looting that followed, the Bandrefam chiefdom was a very attractive cultural and tourist site teeming with a large number of sculptural objects. Nowadays, there are still some vestiges of these preserved art objects on display in front of the reception hall of the palace. The work of bamboo, and the weaving of straw and reed are also attractions which will not escape the curiosity of the visitor. ==Infrastructure== The Bandrefam chiefdom is accessible by land. It is located not very far (about 4 km) from the national road number 4, connecting Yaound√©, the political capital of Cameroon and Bafoussam, the regional capital of the West. It is crossed, from East to West, by the secondary road (D63) that connects Bati√© to Bagang- Fokam, via Bandenkop and Bangou. Some sections of this road are sealed but the stretch between national road 4 and Bandrefam is not sealed.

M√©ndo√π is a men‚Äôs dance, performed in a circle in the center of which the drum rolls and the balafon cadenced by the dancers‚Äô songs make up the main symphony. It is usually a languid and sorrowful rhythm, probably as a reminder of the sad and painful memories from the past centuries. The white gandoura and the ch√©chia make up the dance uniform that offers an exuberant spectacle. Methi√®u is a women‚Äôs dance, also performed in a circle in the center of which the lead singer gives the rhythm with her voice and her dance steps. All the other dancers join in unison. The dancers wear flowery loincloths and a small jingle bell around the ankle, the only musical instrument of the dance. With coordinated steps, these jingle bells make a harmonious tinkling sound, making the choreography very pleasant to watch.Here, the rhythm is more lively and cheerful. The songs are usually in honor of the dignitaries, children and benefactors of the kingdom. Women also sing the love of their fellows and peace between people. The Nzouh or the royal dance which is practiced during the release of the new King from Laakam and the warrior dance Lali which is invariably practiced in times of war or peace (during funeral ceremonies for example) are other types of dances performed. in the kingdom, generally, by men. ==Life and Society== Agir- Association-Bandrefam- Sons and daughters native of Bandrefam but living outside the Kingdom gather in associations to join their efforts in order to help the development of their locality.

An underground dam is a wall constructed to save underground water from pouring into the sea so that it can be put to human use. ==Generals== Fukuzato Dam adjoins Sunakawa Underground Dam and experimental underground Minafuku Dam. An underground wall, 27 meters in height and 1790 meters in width stops incoming seawater and outgoing water within the island. The saved water is pumped up through 85 wells for use such as irrigation into the sugarcane fields. One of the good points of underground dams is that the areas above the dams are used as fields, sugarcane fields in Miyakojima and there is no sight of dam lakes. ==Geology== Miyakojima is covered with the limestone and beneath the layer is a water-resistant Shimajiri layer. There are 8 underground valleys along which underground water flows into the sea of the southern areas of the island.Nakanishi[2002:68] These valleys are indications for underground dams. The Minafuku Dam stops the underground water of the 3rd valley (from the east) and the Fukuzato Dam stops water of the 4th valley. ==Construction== Originally a main dam and three side dams were planned but later only two side dams were evaluated as necessary and constructed. The dam proper is situated more than 20 meters underground, and cannot be seen. For construction, a pile driver equipped with an auger drill first opens a hole, 60 cm in diameter at a distance of 90 cm, and between the holes, the auger drill forms a plate-formed cavity and concrete is poured into the cavity. Together with the Sunakawa Dam, an area of 8400 hectares of agricultural fields is well irrigated with these facilities. the wall of Fukuzato Dam strengthened at distal areas ==History== The geology of Miyakojima is characterized by unstable availability of water for sugarcane agriculture because of changeable rainfall and the lack of rivers. Especially a long drought of 1971 reduced the production of sugarcane to one fourths of the yearly production in Miyakojima. Therefore, the agricultural underwater was investigated and the project of underground dams started in 1974. In 1977, construction of an experimental dam, Minafuku Dam, was started. The experience with the auger in the 1980s Fukuoka Underground Rail construction, helped with the construction of the Miyakojima underground dam. Planning was done between 1984 and 1986 and the construction of the Fukuzato Dam started in 1988 as a national project and the main dam was completed on July 24, 1996 and the side dams were completed on December 18, 1998. By these facilities, agriculture in Miyakojima flourished with sugarcane, tobacco, pumpkins and other vegetables. ==Miyakojima Underground Dam Museum== Underground Dam Museum In 2013, Miyakojima Underground Dam Museum was completed near the Fukuzato Underground Dam. The geology, agriculture, the model of the dam, the 3-axis auger drill used are demonstrated.

Buddhist Indonesian are located throughout the country, and are ethnically identified as Chinese Indonesians. ==Etiquette == In Indonesia, etiquette ‚Äì methods of showing respect () ‚Äì has been considered as one of the key factors in social interactions. Etiquette varies greatly depending on one's status relative to the person being interacted with. Some key points of Indonesian etiquette include: * Hierarchical relationships are respected, emphasised and maintained, * Respect is usually shown to those with status, power, position, and age * Elders must be respected by doing a salim or gently touching the head of people elder to you * Avoiding direct confirmation * Saving one's face means one should consider others' dignity and avoid them to experience shame or humiliation. * Openly correcting or pointing one's mistake would cause someone to felt ashamed, and humiliating someone is considered extremely rude. * Saying terima kasih (\\"thank you\\") after receiving services or favours demonstrates one's good manner. * Addressing Muslims by using Islamic greeting assalamu 'alaikum, and will receive walaikum salam reply. * When greeting or introducing oneself, smiling, handshake (salam) and a slight nod is a good gesture, gently touch the counterpart‚Äôs extended hands, before finally bringing one‚Äôs hands back to the chest to demonstrate that you welcome from the heart. The greeted party will then reciprocate this gesture. * If it is not possible to handshake your counterparts, for example addressing larger crowds with a distance between you, making a greeting gesture by putting your hand together in front of your chess while slightly bowing. It is similar to A√±jali MudrƒÅ. * Some conservative Indonesian Muslims might avoid direct touch with opposite sex including handshake, so performing non-touching salam (anjali) is recommended when greeting opposite sex that are conservative Muslims. * Always using right hand, when shaking hands, offering a gift, handing or receiving something, eating, pointing or generally touching another person. * Do not touch the head of an adult, as it is commonly believed that the soul inhabits the head, and the head is therefore sacred. * One should avoid putting their chin upward, putting their hands on their hips or pointing when talking to other people. * Pointing toward someone with index fingers are considered rude, pointing with thumbs are considered more polite. * Speaking softly but clear with a somewhat subdued tone is recommended, as speaking too loud is considered rude. * Conservative and modest dress sense should be adopted ‚Äî especially by women. * When visiting a place of worship, the proper dress etiquette for such places is of utmost importance. * When entering a mosque, always remove your shoes. * Bathing suit and swimwear are only suitable to wear in and around beaches and swimming pools. * Women swimwear and bikini are best covered from hips with sarong when coming out from water. * To announce your presence, ring a bell or knock at the door while saying assalamu 'alaikum if the host is Muslim, or more common permisi. * Wait to be allowed to enter the house, and wait to be allowed to sit in guest room. * Wait to be allowed to drink, finishing the whole cup is indicating that the guest wished the drink to be refilled. * Do not overstay your welcome, the host will not express any sign of unwelcome since it is considered extremely rude. It is up to the guest to estimate the length of their visit and initiate the farewell. * Food is often taken from a shared dish in the middle. In banquet seated dinner party, you will be served the food and it would not be considered rude if you helped yourself after that. Wait to be invited to eat before you start. * It is better to sit down while eating, yet in some circumstances eating while standing is acceptable. * Depending on the situation some people may use their hands to eat. Eat or pass food with your right hand only. * Making sounds while eating is considered not polite, try not make a sound when slurping or the sound of spoon touching the dish. * Trying not to mix and \\"play\\" with one's food too much, as it is considered as not polite and childish. * Offer gifts with the right hand only, or better yet with both hands. * Gifts are not opened when received. ==Social gathering== Arisan Generally the arisan is a social gathering that involves Rotating Savings and Credit Association. It takes place at a fixed interval, usually once a month, however being an informal social network this may vary. It takes place at each member's home in turn. Each member should chip in the same amount of money and then the lot is drawn. The member that wins, receives payment of the collected money and will organize place and food, for the next gathering. In the course of the arisan the amount paid to other members will equal the amount received when the arisan is held. There is also a saying' eat or not eat as long as we have each other' Selametan Selametan is a communal feast from Java, representing the social unity of those participating in it. It is practised by Javanese, Sundanese, and Madurese ethnic groups. It can be understood as a kind of thanksgiving ritual, but many consider that by being involved, the individual also seeks blessings and protections from God. Selamet in Javanese means safe from any harm, and can also means successful, relieved from any troubles or obstacles. The selametan is usually held at life cycle events such as birth, circumcision, engagement, marriage, and death. Or life events such as moving residence, departing for a long trip (such as hajj pilgrimage or working abroad), opening a new business (such as opening warung), career promotion. Javanese believe selametan could be performed as tolak bala, a ritual to deter negative elements or unfortunate events that might take place in the future. Selametan also might be held in accordance with religious events, such as Mawlid or Satu Suro. During selametan, cone shaped rice portions called tumpeng are usually served. Harvest festival In Indonesia there are many kinds of festive ceremonies and rituals that linked to agricultural activities, from plant the seeds to harvest. One of them is Seren Taun, an annual traditional Sundanese rice harvest festival and ceremony. This festivals originally held to mark the new agriculture year in Sundanese ancient calendar as well as thanks giving for the blessings of the abundance rice harvest, and also to pray for the next successful harvest. Other ethnics such as Javanese might held slametan ceremonies for starting agricultural calendar to harvesting. While Dayak people performing Hudoq dances during harvest thanksgiving festival.

In 1930, the family moved to Kansas City, Kansas. Helm experienced a solitary childhood, full of illness, and was a shy, anxious child. After high school, Helm enrolled in anthropology at the University of Kansas, because of its modest tuition, and there she completed a year of education. In 1942, her father's machinery repair business experienced a boom, leading to the finances necessary for Helm to transfer to the University of Chicago, her school of choice. Helm graduated with a Bachelor of Philosophy from the University of Chicago in 1944, after completing the two-year program. Helm received her M.A. in 1949. She received encouragement from Robert Redfield and George Peter Murdock, both of whom influenced her study. Helm received her PhD in 1958 from the University of Chicago, after completing her dissertation, which was published by the National Museums of Canada in 1961, titled Lynx Point People. ==Personal life== In 1945, Helm married Richard ‚ÄúScotty‚Äù MacNeish, who was a Ph.D candidate in the field of archaeology. In 1949, they moved to Ottawa, Ontario. The two amicably divorced in 1958, at which point Helm returned to Chicago. In 1968, Helm married Pierce King, an architect. The two stayed together until her death. In 1989, Helm suffered from a stroke, which resulted in partial paralysis. She continued to teach for another decade, however, retiring in December 1999. ==Career== In 1945, Helm and MacNeish travelled to Mexico, where MacNeish completed archaeological field work. This was Helm's introduction to field work, and the next year, she conducted ethnographic research among the people of the region, for her Masters' thesis. Upon Helm and MacNeish's move to Ottawa, Helm became a sessional lecturer at Carlton University, from 1949 to 1959. In the summer of 1950, while MacNeish took part in an archaeological survey of the Mackenzie River, Helm became involved with the Dene people living nearby, to whom she gave the name ‚ÄúThe Lynx Point People‚Äù in her 1958 dissertation. While working there, Helm learned that they were interested in having their children learn English, so the following summer, Helm returned with Teresa Carterette. The two volunteered as teachers, and also spent time doing fieldwork, to get a better understanding of the people. Helm continued to conduct interviews between 1954 and 1957, contacting people from Chipewyan, Hare and Slavey communities. Upon her return, Helm focused on the history and ethnography of the Slavey communities, of which there was little. Helm made great forays in understanding and relating the culture of the northern Athapaskan people, and she disproved hypotheses or discovered errors in the works of Julian Steward and Leslie Spier. In 1957, during a linguistics course, Helm met Nancy Oestreich Lurie, and the two became friends. In 1959, the two went to do fieldwork among the Dogrib people in the Northwest Territories. They returned to work with other Dogrib groups in 1962 and 1967. After this point, Helm continued her research alone, making ten trips to do fieldwork between 1959 and 1979. Helm worked as a tenured professor of Anthropology at the University of Iowa, having worked there from 1960 to December 1999. When Helm first joined the department, it was the Department of Sociology and Anthropology; she worked towards the creation of separate departments, which came to fruition in 1969, and she served as chair. Helm also established an American Indian and Native Studies program, and serves as the first chair, from 1993‚Äì1996. In 1996, Helm was contacted by John Zoe, a Dogrib official, and Thomas Andrews, an archaeologist at the Prince of Wales Northern Heritage Centre, located in Yellowknife, regarding artifacts which had been taken by a graduate student of the University of Iowa in 1894, Frank Russell. Helm assisted in the negotiations for repatriation of the artifacts, particularly a caribou skin tent, which had been too large to exhibit. The negotiations were successful, and the tent was returned to the Dogrib people. Throughout her career, Helm published 11 books and monographs, and more than 40 articles and chapters. Helm spent the last few years of her life assembling her notes, photographs and records from her fieldwork, and sent them to Yellowknife, to be available to the Dene people. == Honours and accomplishments == Helm served as an adviser to the Indian Brotherhood of the Northwest Territories (now the Dene Nation), assisting them as a consultant in terms of land claims rights and research in the Mackenzie Valley Pipeline Inquiry.

It is set in Leningrad just before and during the Siege of Leningrad by German forces in World War II. The book was shortlisted for the Orange Prize in 2002 and for the 2001 Whitbread Prize. The Siege is the first of a two-book series. The second, The Betrayal was published in 2010 and is also set in Leningrad, but later in 1952. ==Synopsis== Anna is a nursery-school assistant who lives in a dacha outside Leningrad with her father Mikhail and her young brother Kolya. Germany invades the Soviet Union in June 1941 and approaches Leningrad. Anna's family, and thousands of others, flee to the safety of the city. Mikhail joins the People's Volunteers to fight the advancing Germans, while Anna and thousands of other women dig anti-tank traps on the city's outskirts. By September the German army overruns Leningrad's outer defences and encircle the city, cutting off its food supplies. With winter approaching and strict food rationing, life becomes a struggle for the city's inhabitants. Andrei, a medical student from the hospital, brings a wounded Mikhail home to Anna's apartment. Frequent visits by Andrei to care for her father brings them close and he moves in with her and Kolya. The winter of 1941‚Äì42 is brutal and they struggle with freezing temperatures and the threat of starvation. Limited food supplies arrive via the ice road over the frozen Lake Ladoga, but they are nowhere near sufficient to feed the city of over three million people. Mikhail never recovers from his injuries and dies. Anna and Andrei cannot bury him because they are too weak. By May 1942 the German siege of Leningrad is still in place, but with the spring thaw, more supply routes open up to the city bringing in vital food and supplies. Rationing eases and while the city's survivors are still hungry, they are no longer starving. Anna, Andrei and Kolya have survived, and though they are still weak from malnutrition, they enjoy the outdoors in the sunshine. The nursery-school has re-opened and Anna is busy again. They bury Anna's father alongside thousands of others. Half of Leningrad's population died that winter. ==Reception== In The New York Times, Janice P. Nimura described The Siege as an \\"epic\\" and said that the language used was \\"elegantly, starkly beautiful\\". She wrote that Dunmore does not resort to sentimentality, yet still conveys \\"a fierce note of humanism\\". Nimura felt that the book is \\"quieter and more powerful\\" than her previous historical novel, A Spell of Winter, and added, \\"There is no need here to manufacture fear. History is frightening enough.\\" John Mulian, in The Guardian, focused on the importance of the basic need of sustenance to stay alive in the early days of the siege, and described the novel as an \\"agonizing read\\". He said that at its heart the book is about \\"the realism of the senses\\", particularly that of taste, and how they slowly shutdown as cold and hunger set in. Mulian wrote, \\"It is a kind of insensate blankness in the minds of the novel's characters.\\" In another review in The Guardian, Isobel Montgomery found The Siege to be \\"delicately evocative and immensely readable\\", yet \\"in some primary way indigestible.\\" She felt that when it comes to writing about Leningrad and the blockade, Dunmore has \\"borrowed rather than truly inhabited the history\\". Montgomery wrote that while the book's characters are well crafted and believable, they tend to \\"fall into expected patterns\\" when dealing with \\"real places and events\\". Montgomery concluded that while Leningrad's history is a rich source of material to write about, \\"it is questionable whether The Siege is equal to that depth, or ever probes beyond its obvious paths.\\" The Guardian ranked The Siege 92 in its list of 100 Best Books of the 21st century. ==ReferencesWorks cited== * Category:2001 British novels Category:Russian historical novels Category:Novels set in 20th- century Russia Category:Novels set in Saint Petersburg Category:Novels set during World War II Category:Novels by Helen Dunmore Category:Viking Press books ","title":"The Siege (Dunmore novel)"},{"id":"35311167","text":"Animal Joy is the seventh studio album by the Austin, Texas, band Shearwater.

In 1778 the expedition under d'Estaing, who sent the Chasseurs-Volontaires de Saint- Domingue to assist the U.S. Continental Army, Chavannes was one of those who had volunteered. He distinguished himself during the operations in Virginia and New York, and specially during the retreat from Savannah in December 1778. Once the independence of the American colonies had been accomplished, Chavannes returned to Haiti. When Vincent Og√© landed near Cap-Fran√ßais, 23 October 1790, intending to create an agitation amongst the people of African descent in favor of their political rights, Chavannes sided with him. Chavannes wanted all the slaves to be declared free, but Og√© did not follow his advice, and informed the assembly of his intention to take the opposite course. The mulattoes raised a force of about 1,000 men. The mulattoes being defeated by the colonists, Og√©, Chavannes, and a few others took refuge in the Spanish part of the island, and the Haitian assembly asked for their extradition, according to treaty. The jurist Vicente Faura made a powerful plea in their favor, and the king of Spain gave him a decoration, but the Royal Audiencia of Santo Domingo decided against the refugees, who were delivered to the Haitian authorities on 21 December 1790. Two months later Chavannes and Og√© were sentenced to be hammered to death, and the sentence was executed in the presence of the provincial assembly and authorities of Cap- Fran√ßais. Chavannes protested to the last moment against the oppression of the people of African descent. ==NotesReferences== * ==External links== * Category:1740s births Category:1791 deaths Category:People of Saint-Domingue Category:Haitian people of Mulatto descent Category:Haitian people of French descent Category:Haitian soldiers Category:People of the American Revolution Category:Abolitionists Category:Executed Haitian people Category:Executed revolutionaries Category:People executed by the French First Republic Category:People executed during the French Revolution Category:18th-century executions by France Category:People executed by breaking wheel Category:People of the Haitian Revolution ","title":"Jean-Baptiste Chavannes"},{"id":"35311198","text":"Chiococceae is a tribe of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae and contains about 233 species in 27 genera.

He was the son of organist Benjamin Harper Burrows, and brother of violinist and orchestra conductor Grace Burrows. He studied organ with H. P. Ellis and music theory with Charles Kitson. He worked as music teacher at Leicester University, but also had skills as a precision engineer and horologist. He is noted for his development of a system for music typography and founded his own publishing house, Bodnant Press, to publish his music and teaching monographs. Among his prominent music students is the composer Joyce Howard Barrell. ==Music== Burrows is best known for his art songs. Under the influence and friendship of Jane Vowles, a soprano to whom he taught theory, he composed 93 songs in 21 months. After her parents insisted on her abandoning studies with him, Burrows wrote only one more song (in 1953). His songs have been compared with those by Ivor Gurney and Peter Warlock. They include settings of poetry by A. E. Housman, Rossetti, Herrick, de la Mare, Robert Frost, and Emily Dickinson, several of which have been recorded. He also composed several instrumental works. Between 1929 and 1935 composed a string quartet and sonatas for violin, viola, violoncello, and piano., In later years he concentrated on church music, for his own use at Leicester church where he was organist from 1929 to 1955. ==Selected compositions== Orchestral * In Praise of Music for chamber orchestra (1913) * Lyric Piece No. 2 (1914) * Lyric Piece No. 3 (1914) * Dusk for chamber orchestra (1914) * Dawn for chamber orchestra (1914) * Poem (1914) * Prelude (1915) * Lady of Shalott (1915) * Three Miniatures (1915) * Two Valses-Caprices (1916); orchestration of Nos. 2 and 3 from Three Valses for piano * Song of Darkness and Light for chamber orchestra (1921) * Folk Song Settings for string orchestra (1943) * Prelude for string orchestra (1945) Chamber music * Two Pieces for violin, cello and piano (1911) * Three Trios for violin, cello and piano (1911) * Variations on an Original Theme for string quartet (1912) * Second Concert Piece for violin and piano (1918) * On Shadowy Waters for violin or viola and piano (Augener, 1919) * Lament and Gigue for viola and piano (Augener, 1927) * Sonata for violin and piano (1929) * Sonatina for cello and piano (1930) * Sonata No. 2 for cello and piano (1931) * Sonata No. 3 for cello and piano (1932); unfinished; movement III only * String Quartet (1932) * Two Movements (String Quartet No. 2) for string quartet (1932?) * Sonata for viola and piano (1932‚Äì1933) * Suite in C for descant recorder and piano (Schott, 1955) * Quintet for flute, oboe, clarinet, horn and bassoon (1958) * Theme, Variations and Finale for oboe and piano (1958) * Three Pieces for cello and organ (1961) Keyboard * Variations on an Original Theme for organ and piano (1948) ;Organ * Prelude (1911) * Seven Chorale Preludes (1912) * Three Impressions (1916); arrangement of Three Easy Pieces for piano * Prelude (1923) * Elegy (1923) * Pastorale (1923) * Postlude (1923) * Prelude in F (1925) * Air (1932?) * Seven Chorale Preludes * Seven First Pieces (1948) ;Piano * 4 Pieces (1912) * 3 Pieces (1912) * Nocturne (1913) * Two Picture-Pieces (1913?) :# Twilight :# By the Stream * Sea (1913?) * Four Pieces (1913) * Six Compositions (1913) * Legend (1913) * Three Melodies (1913) :# Stillness :# June Night :# Consolation * Suite (1915) * Valse 2, Dance Rhythms 1 (1916) * Minuet, Dance Rhythms 2 (1916) * Lyric (1916?) * Four Lyrics (1916) * Four Preludes (1916?) * By the Fireside, 5 Pieces (1917) :# The Day Is Done :# Pleasant Visions :# Night :# Resignation :# Lullaby * Jig (1919) * Twelve Studies in Style and Expression (1921) * Country Idylls (1922) :# The Close of Day :# A Hidden Brook :# Woodland Depths :# Still Waters :# The Brookside :# Summer Night * Among the Heather (1923) * Summer Musings (1923) * Prelude (1924) * Intermezzo (1924) * Romance (1924) * Scherzo (1924) * Pictures from The Fairy Queen (1925) * Chimes (1925) * Fancies, 5 Pieces (1925) * Variations on Walsingham 16th c.

The term was originally coined by Lorcan Dempsey in a blog post. The term is now widely used within the academic and research community with Wankel proposing the following definition: The extension of a physical event (or a series of events) through the use of social media tools for expanding access to (aspects of) the event beyond physical and temporal bounds. Such amplification takes place in the context of intent to make the most of the intellectual content, discussion, networking, and discovery initiated by the event through the process of sharing with co-attendees, colleagues, friends and wider informed publics. A paper by illustrates how amplified conferences are becoming mainstream in a discussion on \\"how social media have been employed as part of the project, particularly around event amplification\\". As described by Guy in the Ariadne ejournal the term is not a prescriptive one, but rather describes a pattern of behaviors which initially took place at IT and Web-oriented conferences once WiFi networks started to become available at conference venues and delegates started to bring with them networked devices such as laptops and, more recently, PDAs and mobile phones. ==Different Approaches to 'Amplification' of Conferences== There are a number of ways in which conferences can be amplified through use of networked technologies: *Amplification of the audiences' voice: Prior to the availability of real time chat technologies at events (whether use of IRC, Twitter, instant messaging clients, etc.) it was only feasible to discuss talks with immediate neighbours, and even then this may be considered rude. * Amplification of the speaker's talk: The availability of video and audio-conferencing technologies make it possible for a speaker to be heard by an audience which isn't physically present at the conference. Although use of video technologies has been available to support conferences for some time, this has normally been expensive and require use of dedicated video-conferencing technologies. However the availability of lightweight desktop tools make it much easier to deploy such technologies, without even, requiring the involvement of conference organisers. * Amplification across time: Video and audio technologies can also be used to allow a speaker's talk to be made available after the event, with use of podcasting or videocasting technologies allowing the talks to be easily syndicated to mobile devices as well as accessed on desktop computers. * Amplification of the speaker's slides: The popularity of global repository services for slides, such as SlideShare, enable the slides used by a speaker to be more easily found, embedded on other Web sites and commented upon, in ways that were not possible when the slides, if made available at all, were only available on a conference Web site. * Amplification of feedback to the speaker: Micro-blogging technologies, such as Twitter, are being used not only as a discussion channel for conference participants but also as a way of providing real-time feedback to a speaker during a talk. We are also now seeing dedicated microblogging technologies, such as Coveritlive and Scribblelive, being developed which aim to provide more sophisticated 'back channels' for use at conferences. * Amplification of a conference's collective memory: The popularity of digital cameras and the photographic capabilities of many mobile phones is leading to many photographs being taken at conferences. With such photographs often being uploaded to popular photographic sharing services, such as Flickr, and such collections being made more easy to discover through agreed use of tags, we are seeing amplification of the memories of an event though the sharing of such resources. The ability of such photographic resources to be 'mashed up' with, say, accompanying music, can similarly help to enrich such collective experiences. * Amplification of the learning: The ability to be able to follow links to resources and discuss the points made by a speaker during a talk can enrich the learning which takes place at an event, as described by Shabajee's article on \\"'Hot' or Not? Welcome to real-time peer review\\" published in the Times Higher Educational Supplement in May 2003. * Long term amplification of conference outputs: The availability in a digital format of conference resources, including 'official' resources such as slides, video and audio recordings, etc. which have been made by the conference organisers with the approval of speakers, together with more nebulous resources such as archives of conference back channels, and photographs and unofficial recordings taken at the event may help to provide a more authentic record of an event, which could potentially provide a valuable historical record. The amplification of conferences can be viewed as an example of how new technologies are altering standard practice. By using these techniques a different type of interaction is created at the conference itself, but also the boundaries around the conference can be seen as permeable, with remote participants engaging in discussion. An amplified conference also provides a considerably altered archive compared with a 'traditional' one. For the latter, the printed proceedings will be the main record, but for an amplified event this record is distributed across many media and takes in a wider range of content types, including the papers, videos of the presentations (for example on YouTube), the slides (e.g. on Slideshare), photos of the event (Flickr), interaction between participants (Twitter), reflections and comments (blogs), etc. The amplified conference represents an example of changing practice in digital scholarship. == References == Category:Social media Category:Conferences ","title":"Amplified conference"},{"id":"35311270","text":"Fairmount Park is a park in Riverside, California, designated by the Riverside Cultural Heritage Board as Landmark No. 69. The park's band shell, designed in 1920 by Mission-style architect Arthur Burnett Benton, is separately designated as Landmark No. 10. The park is located at 2601 Fairmount Boulevard, and lies SouthEast of the Santa Ana River with Route 60 to the North. The California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment has issued a safe eating advisory for any fish caught in Lake Evans, in the Western portion of the park, due to elevated levels of mercury and PCBs. In addition, there is a notice of \\"DO NOT EAT\\" for Catfish. ==History== Fairmount Park in vintage postcard image c. 1916 The firm Olmsted and Olmsted was commissioned in 1911 to design Fairmount Park. Although Frederick Law Olmsted, who designed New York City's Central Park, had died in 1903, his design principles were evident in his sons' planning of Fairmount Park. The primary design aspects of the park were implemented over the following 13 years, ending in 1924 with Lake Evans. In 1985, a tree inventory showed that many of the trees in the reforesting effort from 1911 were still living. ==Rehabilitation and revitalization== APA Great Public Spaces plaque, Fairmount Park, 2011 Rehabilitation of the park was prompted by flooding and deterioration of Lake Evans and the increase in crime in and nearby the park. The revitalization was championed by local residents such as Pat Stewart, current chair of Friends of Fairmount Park. The rehabilitation efforts began in 2001 with volunteers willing to pick up waste or provide other general maintenance needs for the park. Community effort catalyzed funding for a $2.6 million playground.

His career with Plessey was dominated by a battle with Arnold Weinstock of GEC for control of the company together with English Electric from the 1960s. This culminated in the late 1980s with the takeover and break-up of Plessey.Sir John Clark, Obituary,Daily Telegraph 6 December 2001, accessed 3 April 2012 ==Early life== Clark was born in Paddington, London and educated at Harrow School. He joined the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve (RNVR) during the Second World War. Clark later began a business apprenticeship with Metropolitan-Vickers and the Ford Motor Company. He then spent a year with American battery and electrical manufacturer P. R. Mallory and Co Inc before joining the Plessey board in 1953. ==Career with Plessey== In 1957 he became general manager of Plessey Components. In 1961 Plessey acquired two large British telephone equipment companies, Ericsson Telephones Ltd. and the Automatic Telephone and Electric Company (AT&E;). This doubled the size of the company. Clark was closely involved having been appointed joint managing director by his father in 1961. After Sir Allen Clark's death in 1962 the company underwent a struggle for power between Clark and his brother Michael along with some other board members, but a vote of no confidence failed. Clark took over the chairmanship of AT&E; and British Ericsson, and in 1964 called in McKinsey's, the management consultancy company, to advise on reorganization. Plessey was then reorganized into product groups and in 1967 Clark was appointed deputy chairman. In 1967 the General Electric Company (GEC) merged with Associated Electrical Industries (AEI). There was concern that Plessey might be the next target for GEC and an approach was made to English Electric's chairman Lord Nelson. However, Nelson agreed a merger with GEC and this was backed by government's Industrial Reorganisation Corporation. In 1971 Clark succeeded Field Marshal Lord Harding as chairman of Plessey. In 1976 he became chief executive as well as chairman keeping both roles until 1989. During the 1970s Plessey supplied half of the UK's telephone equipment. At Plessey's Caswell Research Centre in Northamptonshire, equipment for digital exchanges, known as System X, was developed. Plessey was awarded the largest part of the digital contract in competition with GEC in the late 1970s. Plessey's workforce grew to around 34,000 by 1985. In 1988, the telecommunications divisions of GEC & Plessey merged to form GEC Plessey Telecommunications (GPT) with Clark as chairman. It was, however, not an harmonious relationship, and it also came under financial criticism from shareholders. In 1988 GEC announced a new partnership with the German electronics group Siemens to once again bid for Plessey. Clark was outmanoeuvred by Arnold Weinstock, Managing Director of GEC, and in September 1989 Clark agreed a ¬£2 billion bid from GEC and Siemens. By then he had already announced his own intention to step down as chief executive. In the late 1990s, GEC acquired Siemens' 40% stake in GPT and, in 1999, the parent company of GPT, GEC, renamed itself Marconi. ==Personal life== On 29 April 1952 he married Deirdre Kathleen Waterhouse (b 1929-30) and they had one son and one daughter. The marriage was dissolved in 1962 and he married Olivia Ann Pratt (b 1942-43) on 22 May 1970. They had one daughter and twin sons. In 1971 Clark was knighted for services to exports. He died on 3 December 2001, in Barbados. ==See also== * Plessey * Plessey System 250 * Plessey Code ==References== Category:1926 births Category:2001 deaths Category:People educated at Harrow School Category:British chief executives Category:Knights Bachelor Category:Businesspeople awarded knighthoods Category:Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve personnel of World War II ","title":"John Allen Clark"},{"id":"35311327","text":"Almenevo () is the name of several rural localities in Russia: *Almenevo, Kozlovsky District, Chuvash Republic, a village in Yangildinskoye Rural Settlement of Kozlovsky District of the Chuvash Republic *Almenevo, Vurnarsky District, Chuvash Republic, a selo in Yermoshkinskoye Rural Settlement of Vurnarsky District of the Chuvash Republic *Almenevo, Kurgan Oblast, a selo in Almenevsky Selsoviet of Almenevsky District of Kurgan Oblast ","title":"Almenevo"},{"id":"35311330","text":"The Iglesia de San Gin√©s (Spanish: Iglesia de San Gin√©s) is a church located in Guadalajara, Spain.

Sir Walter Scott referred to the resulting love letters that passed between Burns and Maclehose as \\"the most extraordinary mixture of sense and nonsense, and of love human and divine, that was ever exposed to the eye of the world.\\" On or around 8 December he wrote to her to explain his misfortune and pay her compliments, saying: \\"I can say with truth, Madam, that I never met with a person in my life whom I more anxiously wished to meet again than yourself... I know not how to account for it. I am strangely taken with some people; nor am I often mistaken, You are a stranger to me; but I am an odd being: some yet unnamed feelings; things, not principles, but better than whims, carry me farther than boasted reason ever did a Philosopher.\\" To this epistle Agnes quickly replied: \\"I perfectly comprehend.... Perhaps instinct comes nearer their description than either \\"Principles\\" or \\"Whims\\". Think ye they have any connection with that 'heavenly light which leads astray'? One thing I know, that they have a powerful effect on me, and are delightful when under the check of reason and religion.... Pardon any little freedoms I take with you.\\" This strange mixture of encouragement and restraint led to his response to some verses sent by Agnes: \\"Your lines, I maintain it, are poetry, and good poetry.... Friendship... had I been so blest as to have met with you in time, might have led me ‚Äî God of love only knows where.\\" The use of the word 'love' resulted in a reminder, namely \\"Do you remember that she whom you address is a married woman?\\" At Christmas, they exchanged verse, Agnes's poem revealing her feelings about her unhappy marriage, whilst at the same time reminding Burns about the ultimate barriers which could not be crossed: { border=\\"0\\" -  :\\"Talk not of Love, it gives me pain, :For Love has been my foe; :He bound me with an iron chain. :And plunged me deep in woe.... :Your Friendship much can make me blest, :O, why that bliss destroy! :Why urge the odious, one request :You know I must deny!\\" } Burns matched these verses to the tune, \\"The Borders of Spey\\" for the Scots Musical Museum publication. At this point Burns agreed to Agnes's suggestion of using the Arcadian names of 'Sylvander' and 'Clarinder'. Another mention of love brought an objection and a reproof from Burns: \\"I do love you if possible still better for having so fine a taste and turn for Poesy. I have again gone wrong in my usual unguarded way, but you may erase the word and put esteem, respect, or any other tame Dutch expression you please in its place.\\" The congregation of the Tolbooth Kirk c.1750 Her guilty feelings however show in the lines: \\"I entreat you not to mention our corresponding to anyone on earth. Though I've conscious innocence, my situation is a delicate one.\\" The Reverend John Kemp of the sternly Calvinistic congregation of the Tolbooth Kirk, was her spiritual adviser and would certainly not have approved, nor would Lord Craig, whose generosity was essential to her. On 30 December 1787, Burns wrote to a close confidant, Captain Richard BrownHecht, Page 169 at Irvine: \\"Almighty Love still 'reigns and revels' in my bosom; and I am at this moment ready to hang myself for a young Edinr. Widow, who has wit and beauty more murderously fatal than the assassinating stiletto of the Sicilian banditti, or the poisoned arrow of the savage African.\\" Burns was able to visit Nancy in a sedan chair on 5 January, the first of six visits that month. The love letters and visits continued, the most telling being after they had been together again on the evening of 23 January, Agnes wrote: \\"I am neither well nor happy. My heart reproaches me of last night. If you wish Clarinda to regain her peace, determine against everything but what the strictest delicacy warrants.\\" On 26 January Burns writes that: \\"Perhaps the 'line' you had marked was a little infringed,\\" and Agnes replied, \\"but, though I disapprove, I have not been unhappy about it.\\" Burns's failure to achieve a physical 'conquest' may have directly resulted in his sudden affair with Agnes's personal maid, Jenny Clow, resulting in the birth of a son. A rapid exchange of letters in late February, was the result of either the Reverend Kemp or, more likely, Lord Craig, having sent a \\"haughty dictatorial letter\\" about the erosion of his niece's reputation. On Saturday, 23 February, Robert Burns arrived at Willie's Mill in Tarbolton, to see Jean Armour who had left her parents house due to her pregnancy to stay with the Muir family.Westwood, Page 21 Burns wrote to Agnes from Mossgiel, saying: \\"Now for a little news that will please you. I, this morning as I came home, called for a certain woman. I am disgusted with her; I cannot endure her! I, while my heart smote me for the prophanity, tried to compare her with my Clarinda; 'twas setting the expiring glimmer of a farthing taper beside the cloudless glory of the meridian sun. Here was tasteless insipidity, vulgarity of soul, and mercenary fawning; there, polished good sense, heaven-born genius, and the most generous, the most delicate, the most tender Passion. I have done with her, and she with me....\\" Robert married Jean Armour within six weeks of this letter, something Agnes had urged him to do, a fact however which he left his friend Robert Ainslie to tell her. He had received his commission with the Excise and his marriage may well have been a condition of this appointment. On 6 December 1791 Robert and Agnes met in Edinburgh for the last time; she outlived him by 45 years. Under the date, 6 December 1831, Nancy wrote in her journal: \\"This day I can never forget. Parted with Burns, in the year 1791, never more to meet in this world. Oh, may we meet in Heaven!\\" In her old age Agnes Maclehose took great delight in talking of the poems and songs Burns had written in her honour and also of her own verses he had received and approved. On the anniversary of any event concerning Burns, she noted in her journal, \\"Things I never can forget\\". ;The letters The Correspondence of Burns and Clarinda. 1843. Agnes was careful to retain control of the letters after Burns's death. In negotiations with his biographers Alexander Cunningham and John Syme she offered to select passages from his letters to her in exchange for the return of her own; she eventually succeeded in recovering the manuscripts, and only a few passages from Burns's side of the correspondence were published during her lifetime. It was her grandson, W. C. Maclehose, who published in 1843, for the first time legally, both sides of the correspondence, minus some of her letters, which she had apparently destroyed, and some passages from Burns's letters, which according to the preface had been destroyed by frequent handling as Agnes Maclehose showed them to visitors or cut pieces out for autograph hunters. This may partly explain the belief Agnes tampered with many of the dates and names on her letters for some obscure reason of her own. An earlier attempt to publish the \\"Letters to Clarinda\\" without permission had been blocked by a Court of Session interdict.Annandale, V.1, Page 80 Songs On 27 December, Burns sent a letter to Agnes from Dumfries containing \\"Ae Fond Kiss\\", by far the best among the other nine songs he had written for her. The song celebrates Burns's passion for her, and first appeared in the 'Museum', 1792. The letter is held by National Library of Scotland as part of the Watson Autograph collection of manuscripts. { border=\\"0\\" -  :\\"Ae fond kiss, and then we sever; :Ae fareweel, alas, for ever! :Deep in heart-wrung tears I'll pledge thee, :Warring sighs and groans I'll wage thee. :Who shall say that Fortune grieves him, :While the star of hope she leaves him? :Me, nae cheerful twinkle lights me; :Dark despair around benights me. :I'll ne'er blame my partial fancy, :Naething could resist my Nancy: :But to see her was to love her; :Love but her, and love for ever. :Had we never lov'd sae kindly, :Had we never lov'd sae blindly, :Never met-or never parted, :We had ne'er been broken-hearted. :Fare-thee-weel, thou first and fairest! :Fare- thee-weel, thou best and dearest! :Thine be ilka joy and treasure, :Peace, Enjoyment, Love and Pleasure! :Ae fond kiss, and then we sever! :Ae fareweel alas, for ever! :Deep in heart-wrung tears I'll pledge thee, :Warring sighs and groans I'll wage thee\\". } ==Jean Armour== Jean Armour was well aware of her husband's fondness for Agnes and also knew that he corresponded regularly with her.Westwood, Page 24 In 1821 she accepted an invitation to stay with George Thomson in Edinburgh and one of the visitors with whom she had tea was Agnes Maclehose. They talked at length about each other's families and it was clear to her that Agnes had a great fondness for departed husband.Westwood, Page 49 ==Jenny Clow== Jenny Clow was a domestic servant to Agnes Maclehose.

Obliged, from all the symptoms of a rapid decay, to quit her service, she is gone to a room almost without common necessaries, untended and unmourned. In circumstances so distressing, to whom can she so naturally look for aid as to the father of her child, the man for whose sake she has suffered many a sad and anxious night, shut from the world, with no other companions than guilt and solitude? You have now an opportunity to evince you indeed possess those fine feelings you have delineated, so as to claim the just admiration of your country.

He was associated with the so-called Welbeck Academy by his position as chaplain (with duties as secretary) to William Cavendish, 1st Earl of Newcastle. The position also brought him a close friendship with Thomas Hobbes. ==Life== Payne was born in Abingdon, and was educated at John Roysse's Free School in Abingdon, (now Abingdon School). He matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford in 1611, and graduated B.A. in 1614. He was a contemporary as student of William Backhouse, who later showed him friendship at the end of the First English Civil War. In 1624 he became the second Fellow of Pembroke College. He put himself forward as candidate for Gresham Professor of Astronomy in 1626. In 1630 Payne entered the Cavendish orbit with his nomination as rector of Tormarton by the Earl of Newcastle. A mathematical correspondence with Charles Cavendish led him out of academia. He was taken on as chaplain, by April 1632, at Welbeck Abbey, where he assumed multiple roles in the household. This period of his life, from which his notability as an intellectual figure arises, was cut short in 1638. At that point Newcastle took on responsibility for the upbringing of the Prince of Wales. Payne then returned to Oxford, as a canon of Christ Church from 1638-1648. He was created D.D. in 1642, and was deprived of his living in 1646. At this period Payne did what he could to circulate the ideas and manuscripts of Hobbes in Oxford, and to reduce the hostility of Gilbert Sheldon. The Parliamentary visitation of Oxford in 1648 saw Payne deprived of his college position. He ended his life with family, in Abingdon. ==Works== Payne was not a published author: his significant work was left in manuscript. He undertook some chemical experiments with Newcastle in the 1630s. As reported later by Newcastle, one involved lapis prunellae (a mixture here of saltpetre and brimstone), as a form of indoor firework.Margaret Cavendish, Duchess of Newcastle, Charles Harding Firth (editor), The Life of William Cavendish, Duke of Newcastle, to which is added The true relation of my birth, breeding and life (1886), p. 200 note; archive.org. He translated a work by Galileo, Della scienza mecanica, from Italian to English in 1636, from a manuscript copy. The previous year he had also translated the second half of Della misura dell'acque correnti of Benedetto Castelli, a work on fluid mechanics. The original manuscripts were obtained from Marin Mersenne, and the work was for Charles Cavendish. Scholarly debate continues as to the possible attribution of manuscripts from the Cavendish circle to Payne: the discussion goes deeper than handwriting, since Payne acted also as a copyist. One work, the Short Tract on First Principles initially thought to be by Hobbes, is now thought by Timothy Raylor and Noel Malcolm to be by Payne. Mordechai Feingold suggests another candidate. ==See also== * List of Old Abingdonians == References == Category:1596 births Category:1651 deaths Category:17th-century English Anglican priests Category:Fellows of Pembroke College, Oxford Category:English translators Category:English scientists Category:Natural philosophers Category:People educated at Abingdon School ","title":"Robert Payne (natural philosopher)"},{"id":"35311463","text":"The Salt mine of Im√≥n (Spanish: Salinas de Im√≥n) is a salt mine located in Sig√ºenza, Spain.

With a handful of welders and general workers, Fisher began designing and building snowplows, producing approximately 50 in the first year. Initially, Fisher Engineering built snowplows exclusively for Willys Jeep vehicles, the only light-duty four-wheel-drive vehicle at the time. As new models of lightweight four-wheel-drive vehicles came to market, Fisher responded by introducing corresponding snowplow models. At the same time, he began introducing new innovations. By 1957, the trip-edge cutting surface and under-the-hood, belt-driven hydraulic systems were available in the FISHER snowplow line. In 1984, Dean Fisher sold Fisher Engineering to Douglas Dynamics of Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The purchase gave Douglas Dynamics ownership of the two largest snowplow manufacturers in America at the time‚ÄîWestern Products and Fisher Engineering. ==Innovations== In 1957, Fisher Engineering developed a ‚Äútrip-edge‚Äù system, which allows the lower cutting surface of the blade to collapse backward when the snowplow hits an immovable object. In 1962, Fisher Engineering introduced the ‚ÄúQuick-Switch‚Äù hydraulic angling system. The system enabled the snowplow operator to change the angle of the blade left and right, hydraulically, from a control lever mounted inside the vehicle‚Äôs cab. Until then, the snowplow operator had to manually change the angle of the blade from outside the vehicle. In 1975‚Äì76, Fisher Engineering created an electrically-driven hydraulic system capable of operating off the electrical systems of modern trucks. In 2005, Douglas Dynamics purchased the Blizzard Corporation, which is known for its adjustable-wing snowplows. Shortly thereafter, Fisher Engineering introduced the XLS adjustable-width snowplow that incorporates the technology acquired from Blizzard Corp. ==Products== Snowplows * Homesteader ‚Äì Straight- blade snowplow for residential use * HT Series ‚Äì Full-size straight-blade snowplow for half-ton pickups * SD Series ‚Äì Straight-blade snowplow for lightweight four-wheel-drive vehicles * HD Series ‚Äì Commercial-grade straight- blade snowplow for heavy-duty pickups and four-wheel-drive vehicles * XBLADE ‚Äì Straight-blade commercial snowplow with crossbar reinforcements and a stainless steel moldboard * XtremeV ‚Äì Commercial-grade, hydraulic V-plow * XLS ‚Äì Adjustable-width snowplow with wings that are extendable and can be put into scoop and windrowing positions * MC Series ‚Äì Large municipal and contractor- grade snowplow * HD2 - Replaced the HD with more accessories, made with more reinforced vertical ribs * HDX - Replaced the XBLADE snowplow with an articulating A-frame and adjustable attack angle Spreaders * POLY- CASTER ‚Äì Large salt and sand spreader for commercial or municipal ice control, mountable in large pickup trucks * PRO-CASTER ‚Äì Salt and sand spreader mountable in pickup, dump or platform trucks, for commercial and municipal ice control * SPEED-CASTER 2 ‚Äì Tailgate-mounted salt and sand spreader for commercial and residential ice control * Low Profile ‚Äì Low-profile tailgate- mounted salt and sand spreader for commercial and residential ice control ==References * Category:Manufacturing companies based in Maine Category:Companies based in Knox County, Maine Category:Snowplows Category:Manufacturing companies established in 1948 ","title":"Fisher Engineering"},{"id":"35311540","text":"The Church of los Remedios (Spanish: Iglesia de los Remedios) is an old church located in Guadalajara, Spain.

Many of Dalton Maag's typefaces have been designed for corporate clients. Dalton Maag's larger clients include Netflix, BBC, Amazon, Nokia, BMW, Vodafone, Ubuntu and Toyota. They also have a library of typefaces available to purchase from their website. Transport-related typefaces have included \\"Pantograph\\" for Manchester Metrolink and \\"Barlow\\", named after William Henry Barlow, for St Pancras railway station and the associated High Speed 1 signage. \\"Barlow\\" was created from a typeface called \\"Stroudley\\", which itself was descended from \\"Casey\\", designed for the KCR Corporation in Hong Kong. The Ubuntu typeface was notable for being created for open source software company Canonical Ltd to use in their Ubuntu operating system, branding and publicity material. It was the first typeface to be designed with the intention that it should be expanded upon by the Open Source community. Because of the free and open-source nature of the Ubuntu operating system, the font is available to download for free. Dalton Maag attracted some publicity when they created Nokia Pure for the Finnish mobile phone company Nokia, which replaced the earlier Nokia Sans font created by Erik Spiekermann. Spiekermann commented that he was disappointed that Dalton Maag had not consulted him on the new design and accused it of blandness. However, the new design was generally well received elsewhere, and in February 2012 Nokia Pure was nominated for the Design Museum Designs of the Year 2012 award in the graphics category. The font went on to win the Graphics category. In July 2012 the Rio 2016 Olympic Games released their brand font created by Dalton Maag. It was based on the letters and numbers within the logo already created by Brazilian design agency, T√°til. The typeface took eight months to create and comprises 5448 characters. The design work was mainly done by Dalton Maag's Brazilian office, which worked with the London team during the font engineering stage, and also with Brazilian consultant Gustavo Soares, who worked as the technical interface between Dalton Maag and the Rio 2016 team. Dalton Maag's library of typefaces include Lexia, Aktiv Grotesk, Magpie and Elevon. Elevon was originally created for the Virgin Galactic spaceflight programme. Magpie was designed by Vincent Connare, who is known for designing Comic Sans. It was called Magpie because of the distinctive descenders in the italic form which are said to resemble the tails of magpies.

It opened in January 2011 and was located in The Emelie, a structure on the National Register of Historical Places at 340 North Senate Avenue in Indianapolis, Indiana, until January 2019. Funding for a new building at 543 Indiana Avenue was secured, and the library reopened to the public on November 9, 2019. The library serves as a cultural and educational resource facility, museum, art gallery, and reading room. It supports language and visual arts education through programs and outreach activities with other local arts organizations to foster a strong arts network for both the local and national community. One of the goals for the Kurt Vonnegut Museum and Library is to help bring tourism to Indianapolis. Tourism officials from the city look at the library as an important attraction and reason for people to visit. The library is one of several efforts supported by the city and institutions such as the Lilly Endowment and Ball State University to expand the city's cultural activities, alongside the Indianapolis Museum of Art and The Children's Museum of Indianapolis. Ball State University along with partner contributors granted the library $76,710 to digitize rare archival material and make the content more accessible to the general public via a digital display. ==Interior== Highlighted attractions of the library include a museum, art gallery, and reading room. The museum features rare remnants from Vonnegut's life, including the author's Purple Heart medal awarded to him for his service in Dresden, Germany during World War II, the author's Smith-Corona Coronamatic 2200 typewriter, an unopened box of the author's Pall Mall cigarettes discovered by his children behind a bookcase following his death, an unopened letter sent overseas (in the course of World War II) to the author from his father, a series of rejection letters sent to the author by magazines which are periodically rotated, and a complete replica of his writing studio. The library's art gallery displays art by local and national artists. A small reading room with a selection of books by Vonnegut sits in the corner of the library. On the wall of the reading room is a quote by the author: \\"We are what we pretend to be so we must be careful what we pretend to be.\\" The new building also features a permanent Slaughterhouse-Five exhibition, and a new Freedom to Read exhibit that celebrates First Amendment rights will open soon. ==Public service== The library functions as an educational resource to schools ranging from grade school to high school levels. Resources for high schools include support for the Shortridge High School newspaper, the same newspaper Vonnegut edited as a teenager. Teachers can also look to the library for continuing education through the ‚ÄúTeaching Teachers to Teach Vonnegut‚Äù program, a program designed to assist educators in learning key methods of teaching Vonnegut's works to teenagers. The library holds an annual writing contest for high school students, and winners receive scholarships such as the Kurt Vonnegut Writing Award and the Jane Cox Vonnegut Writing Award. Resources are also available to local professional, and amateur writers including a variety of writing events and discussions. The library sponsors a literary magazine, So It Goes, that debuted in December 2012. The library is an active opponent of banning books. When the Republic High School in Missouri banned Vonnegut's classic 1969 novel Slaughterhouse Five, the library offered students of the high school a free copy of the novel so they could read it themselves and draw their own conclusions. In regard to the book giveaway, a library representative stated: \\"We have up to 150 books to share thanks to the generosity of an anonymous donor ‚Ä¶ We‚Äôre not telling you to like the book ‚Ä¶ we just want you to read it and decide for yourself.\\" The library includes military veterans in its programming, with an annual event titled \\"Veterans Reclaim Armistice Day\\"; exhibitions of veterans' artwork, performance art, and writings; writing workshops; and opportunities for veterans to learn to use the arts and humanities as a way to communicate. Vonnegut himself was a veteran of World War II. ==References== Category:2011 establishments in Indiana Category:Kurt Vonnegut Category:Libraries in Indiana Category:Monuments and memorials in Indiana Category:Libraries established in 2011 Vonnegut, Kurt ","title":"Kurt Vonnegut Museum and Library"},{"id":"35311564","text":"The Tower of √Ålvar F√°√±ez (Spanish: Torre√≥n de √Ålvar F√°√±ez) is a tower located in Guadalajara, Spain.

The trains were manufactured by a consortium between Renault, Brissonneau et Lotz, and Alstom and operated on Line 11 from 1956 to 1999, when they were replaced by refurbished MP 59 stock from Line 4. == Conception == After the successful testing of the MA 51 on the la voie navette segment (connecting track) between Line 3bis and Line 7bis, the RATP decided to order 71 new train cars to equip Line 11, since the line contained a steep grade. The first train (M.3001-N.4001-AB.5501-M.3002) was delivered beginning on October 1, 1956 and went into service on November 8, 1956, with all 17 trains were in service by October 1957. == Description == The MP 55 was composed of 4 car trainsets, with three of the cars motorized. Originally, the trains were painted in a light blue livery and contained soft fluorescent lighting. Like many trains during the 1950s, the MP 55 trains contained both first class and second class cars. The maximum acceleration for the MP 55 was restrained at for passenger comfort. The traction equipment used was either electro-pneumatic (EMC) or camshaft electric (Jeumon-Heidmann, or JH) and the braking system used was also of electro-pneumatic type, though a gradual variant was used. In 1967, automatic drive (ATO) was implemented on all trainsets. Side view of the MP 55. == Refurbishment and retirement == In 1977, the trains underwent their mid-life refurbishment and received a darker blue livery similar to that of the MP 73. During the late 1980s, the RATP decided that it was time to retire the MP 55. Because of this, the trains were not repainted in the RATP's current mint green and white livery, however many trains were fitted with the RATP's current logo. The retirement process began in 1995, with the arrival of the newer MP 89CC trains on Line 1, and refurbished MP 59 trainsets from Line 4 gradually replaced all of the MP 55 trainsets. The final train was retired on January 30, 1999, completing the retirement process. Unlike the Sprague-Thomson, no MP 55 trainset was safeguarded in its entirety; nearly all of them were scrapped after their retirement.

The name Mafia K'1 Fry comes from a rap verse during a freestyle improvised in √† Orly at the \\"Demi-Lune\\": \\"Tu peux pas test avec la Mafia K'1 Fry,\\" with \\"K'1 Fry\\" being a verlan term for africain, hence, translated into English, African Mafia. It was also known as \\"L'Union\\" and later \\"113 Clan\\". Las Montana was also a leader in the group that suffered from many legal problems as many of its members went to prison on certain charges. The members of Intouchable were hit by even bigger problems with a series of deaths of its members like Mamad, Las Montana and M.S. The diverse group concentrated on Hip-Hop, but there were also breakdancers like Mokob√©, Selim du 94 and Teddy Corona, graffiti artists like AP and Douma, backers like Las Montana, Mamad, Rocco, OGB, beatboxers like Mista Flo and DJs like DJ Mehdi and DJ Mosko. Besides solo projects by many of its members, the collective realised two mini albums: Les Liens Sacr√©s and L√©gendaire before departure of Kery James in 2003 (he rejoined in 2007), and death of certain members most notably Las Montana and disappearance of M.S. Some members had big commercial success like 113 and Rohff and Intouchable (with Dry, Demon One and Mamad) before Mamad's death in 2003 just after the collective joint album La cerise sur le ghetto, which marked the release of music videos for \\"Pour ceux\\" and \\"Balance\\" . The period was marked by the departure of Popa Project and Rohff although keeping some nominal relations with the collective, with Rohff. In 2007, the collective released its biggest successful album Jusqu'√† la mort (#7 in French albums chart). Mafia K'1 Fry will be releasing a new title in 2012. ==Members== Refer to infobox on right ==In popular culture== *A documentary about the collective titled Si tu roules avec la Mafia K'1 Fry also found great success (both critically and commercially).

He received his Ph.D. in 1993 under Dennis DeTurck at the University of Pennsylvania, with a dissertation titled \\"Noncommutative Determinants and Applications\\".. He is the author of several important results in combinatorics (especially additive combinatorics), harmonic analysis and other areas. In 2003, jointly with Jean Bourgain and Terence Tao, he proved that any subset of \\\\Z/p\\\\Z grows substantially under either addition or multiplication. More precisely, if A is a set such that \\\\max(A \\\\cdot A, A+A) \\\\leq KA , then A has size at most K^C or at least p/K^C where C is a constant that depends on A. This result was followed by the subsequent work of Bourgain, Sergei Konyagin and Glibichuk, establishing that every approximate field is almost a field. Somewhat earlier he was involved in establishing new bounds in connection with the dimension of Kakeya sets. Jointly with Izabella ≈Åaba and Terence Tao he proved that the upper Minkowski dimension of Kakeya sets in 3 dimensions is strictly greater than 5/2, and jointly with Terence Tao he established new bounds in large dimensions. In 2010, Katz along with Larry Guth published the results of their collaborative effort to solve the Erd≈ës distinct distances problem, in which they found a \\"near-optimal\\" result, proving that a set of N points in the plane has at least cN / \\\\log N distinct distances. In early 2011, in joint work with Michael Bateman, he improved the best known bounds in the cap set problem: if A is a subset of (\\\\Z/3\\\\Z)^n of cardinality at least 3^n/n^{1+c}, where c > 0, then A contains three elements in a line.

In addition, the press was quick to seize on the irony of the BBC's decision that the production was unsuitable for children: Kemp, loc.cit. Miller had envisaged an Alice \\"with no stage experience, not very pretty but curiously plain, sallow and a bit priggish\\"Quoted by Philip Kemp, loc.cit. After advertising the part, he cast Mallik within twenty minutes of meeting her, having asked her (as Mallik recalled) to recite the poem \\"You Are Old, Father William\\" which Alice performs for the Caterpillar. Miller's first impression of her was of a \\"rather extraordinary, solemn child\\" who proved to be \\"naturally expressive\\" and \\"not amused by anything [she was] surrounded by\\".Jonathan Miller and Anne- Marie Huxstep, Arena, 31 March 2012 In similar, though less complimentary, vein, the biographer of Peter Cook, who played the Mad Hatter, has described Mallik's Alice as \\"a sullen, pouting, pubescent with no sense of bewilderment\\", noting also that, in his view, \\"the whole piece was strangely lacking in either humour or fear\\".Harry Thompson (1997) Peter Cook: a Biography Mallik's return to obscurity after Alice was such that, in 1986, the BBC had difficulty tracking her down to pay a repeat fee.Alice was shown again as part of a season to mark the 50th anniversary of BBC television. She was, by then, a naval wife, living in Southsea, and was located only after a newspaper reader recognised a photograph of her.The Times, 31 October 1986 A DVD of Alice was released by the British Film Institute in 2003BFIVD519 (2003) and, in 2012, Mallik appeared in conversation with Miller (their first meeting since 1966) in a BBC Arena programme about Miller‚Äôs life and work. Among other things, Mallik recalled that, making Alice, she was not awed by the distinguished cast because she had been used to mingling with friends of her \\"much older\\" parents who had achieved distinction in their careers.Arena, 31 March 2012 ==Family and later career== Mallik married a naval officer. They had four children. Although she told Jonathan Miller in 2012 that she had been \\"hugely glad\\" to have played Alice,Arena, loc. cit. she never contemplated an acting career and went into banking.The Times, 31 October 1986 Anne-Marie Mallik hails from a famous family of Calcutta, India. Her father was Joypaul Mallik son of Manmatha Chandra Vasu Mallik and belongs to the famous Vasu Mallik family of Calcutta, and migrated to England. Raja Subodh Mallik of Kolkata was his nephew (son of his elder brother Probodh Chandra). The family is known for its patriotism and contribution to India's freedom movement. The movement against partition of Bengal in 1905 was mainly directed from the family's ancestral house in Calcutta under the leadership of Arabinda Ghose. ==References * Stills of Anne-Marie Mallik in Alice in Wonderland Category:1952 births Category:Living people Category:People from Fordingbridge Category:English film actresses Category:English television actresses ","title":"Anne-Marie Mallik"},{"id":"35311733","text":"The Church of Santa Mar√≠a (Spanish: Iglesia de Santa Mar√≠a) is a church located in Cogolludo, Spain.

Thorne first became interested in matters pertaining to archaeology and human evolution as a lecturer in human anatomy at the University of Sydney and eventually joined the Australian National University (ANU) as a professor, where he taught biology and human anatomy. Over time, through many excavations such as Lake Mungo and Kow Swamp, Thorne posited significant arguments that have contradicted traditionally accepted theories explaining the early dispersion of human beings.Kow Swamp Revisited. AIATSIS Seminar Series, 2004 ==Career== Thorne worked as a journalist before he emerged on the university campus as a lecturer and then later as a prominent academic figure. Anthropologist Neil Macintosh was a mentor for Thorne, and Thorne eventually earned his PhD under Macintosh at the University of Sydney. Thorne subsequently embraced the work and ideas of Macintosh, who died in 1977, throughout his own career. Thorne held positions with many organisations, such as the Myanmar-Australian Archaeology Project and the Australian Academy of the Humanities, and served as an executive committee member for the International Association for the Study of Human Paleontology. Thorne was also known for making a large number of documentary films that have touched on various anthropological topics, such as the film series, Man on the Rim. Lake Mungo In 1969, whilst teaching at the University of Sydney, Alan Thorne reconstructed the remains of LM1 (also known as \\"Mungo Lady\\") and LM3 (also known as \\"Mungo Man\\") in 1974. He is also accredited for reconstructing fossil WLH-50 in 1982. Though Jim Bowler has been credited with the discovery of both LM1 and LM3, Thorne performed the reconstruction and analysis of the individual fossil sets. Through the initial reconstruction of \\"Mungo Lady\\", Thorne found the bones to be thin and frail, very similar to the bones found in human beings today. The skull thickness of the \\"Mungo Lady\\" set, in particular, proved to be the most significant contradiction, as other uncovered Australian hominid specimens dated to approximately the same time period (about 25,000 years ago) have been tall and thick-skulled. Upon realising this contradiction, Thorne began to examine the possibility of new theories to address the fundamental question of \\"where did Homo sapiens come from?\\".Frayer, David W.& Wolpoff, Milford H.& Thorne, Alan G.& Smith, Fred H.& Pope, Geoffrey G. Theories of Modern Human Origins: The Paleontological Test. American Anthropologist, New Series, Vol. 95, No. 1 (Mar. 1993), pp. 14‚Äì50 Thorne's discovery and reconstruction of \\"Mungo Lady\\" led him to question the validity of the \\"Out of Africa\\" theory commonly held by many anthropologists. His specimen contained an advanced skull and overall anatomy that resembled modern day humans, but originated during an era and in a location where such hominids were believed not to exist. As a result of what had been uncovered at Lake Mungo, Thorne devoted a large amount of time and energy into constructing a theory that would prove that there had been only one human migration out of Africa and sought support from colleagues in various parts of the world. The single migration, which could have taken place around two million years ago, would have involved Homo sapiens, rather than the Homo erectus species posited by his opponents. When speaking publicly on the matter, Thorne conveyed confidence in his new discovery, stating that \\"only one species of human has ever left Africa, and that is us.\\" For Thorne, the Lake Mungo study clearly demonstrated that instead of a second wave of Homo sapiens migration taking place approximately 100,000 to 120,000 years ago out of Africa, \\"regional continuity\\" occurred. Thorne believed that the second migration never happened and that the first wave of migration from Africa two million years ago is the basis of human evolution.Mapes, Jennifer. Discoveries Breathe New Life into Human Origins Debate. National Geographic News, 2001Bowler, Jim. M. & Thorne, Alan. G. Human remains from Lake Mungo: discovery and excavation of Lake Mungo III. Australian National University, 1976 Kow Swamp Thorne played an influential role in the leading of the excavations at the Kow Swamp burial ground, southeast of Cohuna in the central Murray Valley, Australia. Between 1968 and 1972, Thorne, together with colleagues, unearthed 22 individual sets of remains, with a portion dating back to the Pleistocene era. The excavations at Kow Swamp formed part of Thorne's PhD research and he is credited with providing Australian anthropology with the first ever fossil sets from established contexts ‚Äì that is, from provenience and dating. Through the reconstruction of the individual specimens excavated, Thorne and his team were able to further examine the many features that characterised the time period. The Kow Swamp research provided great insight into the potential appearance of Australia's ancestors, in addition to the variety of lifestyles adopted. Furthermore, this work was combined with the many other excavations being undertaken in Australia and Asia during a similar time period that were exploring the possibility of multiregional human evolution, rather than the widely accepted \\"Out of Africa\\" theory.Brown, Peter. Australian& Asian Paleoanthropology. Personal.une.edu.au, 1997‚Äì2012. Studies performed on the Kow Swamp fossils led to the formulation of an alternate theory, as the bodies that were reconstructed proved to be structurally similar to modern humans, rather than the temporal era that was assigned to them. Thorne, alongside similarly minded colleagues, insisted that the predominant theory was flawed. ==Regional Continuity Theory== The theory of \\"regional continuity\\" has been significant in the anthropological realm for several decades and has been explored by many researchers in various fields, as they have attempted to respond to the fundamental question of how humans have evolved. Of particular importance to the verification of the theory is the resultant questioning of the fundamental knowledge that humans hold about their own anatomy. Thorne, together with colleagues around the world, called \\"regional continuity\\" the more likely path of human history. The details of the theory contend that around two million years ago, Homo sapiens (not Homo erectus) left Africa and dispersed across the Middle East, into Europe, North and South America and Asia, right down through to Australia. It was thus argued by Thorne that all humans have originated from this initial, single journey. The theory then explains that the sub-species of the hominids (Homo erectus and Homo antecessor) are the basis for the different human physical attributes of the modern age, such as tall, slender southern traits and short, stocky northern characteristics. Fundamental to this argument is the ability of such hominids to sexually reproduce with a member of the opposite sex from any of the different hominid races (Thorne used learnings from his own extensive animal studies as substantiation here). As time progressed, this behaviour is likely to have migrated outwards and further reproduction with different hominids has, according to Thorne's theory, created the races found today.D'Agnese, Joseph.

While making excavations in the pyramids of Cholula, he discovered some idols that are now in the National Museum of Mexico. He became a member of the Mexican Congress in 1869, and supported Presidents Benito Ju√°rez, Sebasti√°n Lerdo de Tejada, Manuel Gonz√°lez, and Porfirio D√≠az in succession, notwithstanding their different policies. On 25 June 1879, the government of Diaz ordered the execution of nine citizens of Veracruz who were suspected of conspiracy. This act was severely criticised, and great indignation was shown against Mier y Ter√°n, who had executed the order, and against Diaz. Chavero, then grand master of a masonic lodge, and expelled Mier y Ter√°n from the brotherhood, and suspended Diaz from his masonic rights. This action gave Chavero great popularity. In congress Chavero also made a strong speech against Mier and Diaz, but afterward became one of his adherents. Chavero was elected senator in 1886, and was professor in the mining and law schools of Mexico. He is the author of the dramas ‚ÄúLa Reina Xochitl‚Äù and ‚ÄúLa tempestad de un beso,‚Äù ‚ÄúQuetzalcoatl,‚Äù ‚ÄúLos amores de Alarc√≥n,‚Äù ‚ÄúLa hermana de los √Åvilas,‚Äù ‚ÄúEl mundo de ahora,‚Äù and others. His books relative to Father Sahag√∫n and to the Sun Stone are often referred to. Chavero was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1881.American Antiquarian Society Members Directory When the Mexican government proposed the Law of Monuments (1897), which passed overwhelmingly in the Mexican Congress, Chavero opposed the provision banned the export of Mexican artifacts, which in his view \\"hindered the flow of artifacts to museums abroad and thus obstructed the cause of science.\\"Christina Bueno, The Pursuit of Ruins: Archeology, History, and the Making of Modern Mexico. Albuquerque: University of New Mexico Press 2016, p.84-85.

Constructed of Alcarria limestone, the rectangular structure has three round towers and a square keep. A well stands at the centre of its courtyard.

He graduated in Biology in 1970.http://www.fh- bingen.de/aktuelles/detail.html?tx_ttnews%5Byear%5D=2010&tx;_ttnews%5Bmonth%5D=07&tx;_ttnews%5Bday%5D=09&tx;_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=603&cHash;=83fdada0e063e1ef913fdc1780e9d40b From 1968 to 1971 he was employed at the Max Planck Institute for Brain Research in Frankfurt. He spent the years 1971 to 1973 in the jungle of Sarawak on Borneo. After returning to Germany he was awarded his doctorate in biology in 1974. In 1975 he qualified to teach anatomy and until 1978 was lecturer at the Anatomical Institute of the University of G√∂ttingen. At the age of 32 he was appointed Professor of Human Biology at the Free University of Berlin, a post he held as head of the Institute until 2010. In 1987 he was consultant to the IUCN as a member of the Species Survival Commission. In 1993 he was appointed as professor of zoology at the University of Essen and was a visiting professor of Systematic Zoology and Evolutionary Biology at the University of Potsdam. During a research trip in 1991 to Sulawesi, he discovered the primate Tarsius dianae. In 1996 he introduced in the Anthropological Society a proposal to ban the use of the term \\"race\\", which was later adopted officially by the society. In addition to his field research on primates and the study of biomechanics, one of his research interests was the origin of language and writing, with investigation into communication amongst anthropoid apes. He was one of those who regarded facial expressions and gestures as a precursor of human writing skills. In brief, his thesis was that the abilities to read and write are biologically older than those of language, because such visual communication was later supplemented by vocal and acoustic signals. In the late eighties and the nineties he was one of those who raised the alarm about the depletion of tropical rain forests. From 2000 Niemitz developed an \\"amphibious\\" theory of the evolution of upright human posture and walking erect, according to which \\"there was a period in our evolution when it was wading and shore use which in a sustained and substantial way helped to shape today's people\\".Niemitz 2006, p 210 Niemitz rejects the more extensive aquatic ape hypothesis, which accepts a real aquatic (water living) phase in human evolution.Niemitz 2006, pp. 204-210 His publication list includes over 350 titles and many books. He also became active as a translator and as a writer of textbooks and for radio, film and television. ==Memberships== Niemitz was president of the Anthropological Society and later of the Berlin Society for Anthropology, Ethnology and Prehistory (BGAEU). He is Deputy Chairman of Urania in Berlin, a centre for the discussion of scientific results with the general public. == Works== * Zur Biometrie der Gattung Tarsius Storr, 1780 (Tarsiiformes, Tarsiidae).
