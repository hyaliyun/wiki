To avoid the violent city still in the madness of the gold rush, James' French mother took him to live in Paris, which was then an Empire under the rule of Napoleon III. The nephew of Napoleon I left his mark on James by making France a wild, flamboyant stage for ornate theatrical displays and public works, and mystifying ceremonies. As a child, James was fascinated with the French court and all of its glamor and pomp. Also, because of the lively brilliance of the live theater, he acquired a lifelong liking of adventure. During boyhood he was taught in Belgium by the Jesuits and later studied law at the University of Leipzig. He entered the French military academy, Saint- Cyr, at 19. In 1875, he graduated with high marks. Shortly thereafter, his father died. Three years later, Harden-Hickey married the Countess de Saint- Pery and fathered two children. By then he had mastered French, was accounted a master swordsman and began writing novels. ==Literary career== On November 10, 1878, Harden-Hickey first published the newspaper Triboulet, named for a jester of King Louis XII, eight years after Napoleon's fall from power. Though popular, the strongly anti-republican stand of this paper involved Harden- Hickey in no fewer than a dozen duels, several dozen lawsuits and numerous fines. Sadly for Harden-Hickey and his fellow royalists, their funds were exhausted by 1887. As of 1880, he had 11 novels published. Two of the novels are borrowed from Michael Strogoff, by Jules Verne and another is based on Don Quixote by Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra. His novels praise the virtues of monarchies and are anti-democratic. James was made a baron of the Holy Roman Empire (which legally ceased to exist in 1806) for his strong defense of the church in his works and in practice. His novels include the following, all published under the pen name Saint Patrice: *Un Amour Vendeen *Lettres d'un Yankee *Merveilleuses Adventures de Nabuchodonosor Nosebreaker *Un Amour dans le Monde *Memoirs d'un Gommeux Sometime after, James Harden-Hickey divorced his first wife and renounced Catholicism; he acquired an interest in Buddhism and Theosophy. This was a turning point in his life, and he took the opportunity to travel around the world, staying a year in India, learning Sanskrit and studying the philosophy of the Buddha. He returned to Paris and met Annie Harper Flagler, daughter of John Haldane Flagler, head of a successful pipe company and one of Andrew Carnegie's partners in the steel business. They were married at the Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church in New York on March 17 (St. Patrick's Day), 1891. He lived with and off the Flaglers in New York for two years. Traveling to Tibet before his marriage, his crew made a stop in the South Atlantic. Harden-Hickey noticed that the tiny island of Trinidad in the South Atlantic Ocean had never been claimed by any country and was, legally, \\"res nullius\\". He claimed the island and proclaimed himself James I, Prince of Trinidad. He wanted an independent state with himself as military dictator, and later in 1893, he got just that. ==As Prince James I of Trinidad== The now-James I was given attention ‚Äì most of it negative and derogatory ‚Äì by various nations and news organizations when he started selling Principality of Trinidad government bonds, opened an office in New York City and began making secretarial appointments, such as M. le Comte de la Boissiere as his Secretary of State. Trinidad was seized by Great Britain, however, in 1895 as a telegraph cable-relay station, and James I was forced to surrender it to them, leaving him with only a homemade crown, and a schooner. While the Brazilians and British were threatening war over their respective claims, James I was forgotten, although he had the prior claim of sovereignty. Appeals to the United States to act as a mediator did nothing for his cause when US Secretary of State John Milton Hay released his letter appealing for American mediation to the press, opening James I to harsh ridicule in the popular press. After the British invaded \\"his\\" Trinidad island in 1895, James I designed a plan to invade England from Ireland and even asked the wealthy Henry Flagler to finance his invasion plan, but Flagler demured, and denied his request. James I then tried to raise money by selling his ranch in Mexico but failed to assemble enough funds to continue operating.Famous Suicides James A. Harden-HickeyNew York Press ‚Äì William Bryk Although somewhat apocryphal, there is evidence to suggest that during this time, James I was approached by a certain filibuster named Ralston J. Markowe with a plan in 1895 to make him the King of Hawai'i (per Richard Harding Davis,s:Real Soldiers of Fortune/Chapter 2) but any such plans as may have existed never came to fruition.) ==Later years== Over the next two years, Harden-Hickey fell into deep depression. His vision for his island was easily realizable, and it had become the core of his existence, but, despite the validity of his claim on Trinidad and his seriousness at realizing his dream, he received little real support, only receiving such from his family and friends; and after all of his attempts at restoring his claim had failed, the world laughed at him for even trying. In truth, his only public support came from the [New York Times, which gave him some praise and compassion. He gave the managing editor and a reporter for the Times the Order of Trinidad for their understanding of his passion. James Harden-Hickey had written a book titled Euthanasia: The Aesthetics of Suicide, showing that suicide was a powerful art form and \\"a privilege.\\" He wrote that life wasn't so important or even worth living if one was to suffer, and stated clearly that \\"it is of greater moment to live well than to live long, and that often it is living well not to live long.\\" Destitute and depressed, he lived up to his ideology by living and dying as a strong proponent of suicide: Harden-Hickey took an overdose of morphine on February 9, 1898 in an El Paso, Texas hotel when he could not sell his Mexican ranch that he acquired while living with the Flaglers. Found among his effects were a suicide note to his wife and his memorabilia from his glory days with him, including his hand-made crown. ==References== ==External links== *, by Richard Harding Davis from Project Gutenberg.

G. Wrigley & Co Limited, issued 16. March 1922 E G Wrigley & Co Limited was a British tool maker, car component, and mechanical parts manufacturer, located at Foundry Lane, Soho, Birmingham active from 1897 to 1923. ==Foundation== Edward Greenwood Wrigley established a tool making business at 232 Aston Road, Birmingham in 1898. He expanded in 1902 by moving some operations to Foundry Lane, Soho, Birmingham. They manufactured high- speed twist drills and made a specialty of milling cutters, taper and adjustable reamers and gear cutters.The Olympia Show, The Commercial Motor, 22 November 1906, page 13 ===Small tools and Gears=== In addition to the small tools mentioned Wrigley's made gears of many types for all mechanisms but the engine and they assembled gears into boxes making a number of products. Their reputation for high quality was excellent though Dr Lanchester went on record as saying the one use for a Wrigley Worm was for fishing. ===Transmission sets=== A range of three speed gearboxes and worm-driven back axles with propellor shaft and torque mechanism and transmission brakes and front axles with steering gear. In 1906 Wrigley's showed a complete car gearbox at that year's Olympia Show and were manufacturing front and live-rear axles. ==Developments== In 1912 at the opening of a new building at Soho Foundry Lane core activities were: * Manufacture of twist drills, cutters and small tools of all kinds * the machining of toothed gearing * assembly of gearboxes and other complete units Other special tools made in large numbers were: hobs, metal-splitting saws and all kinds of special cutters and gauges. At that time it was reported there were now eighteen draughtsmen, 47 staff and 280 men in the workshops.The Birthplace of the Wrigley Worm, The Commercial Motor, 7 March 1912, page 12 After the war, due to ill health, Wrigley handed over the running of his business to F G Woollard. Wrigley died in January 1941. ===Cars=== Wrigley cars were only made during 1913. In 1913 they began experimenting with a cyclecar with a two-cylinder, air- or water-cooled engine and two-speed gearbox. Very few were built before the business was involved in war work, including making aircraft parts.L P Jarman and R I Barraclough, The Bullnose and Flatnose Morris, David & Charles, Newton Abbott, UK 1976 ==Morris Commercial Cars== Wrigley's continued building, among other products, engines and gearboxes. At the end of 1923 it was placed in receivership following the failure of principal customer (undercut by Morris), Angus-Sanderson for whom they had geared up for large-scale production. On 1 January 1924 William Morris bought from the receiver the complete assets, including the buildings, and on 4 February of that year, the former Wrigley business, now incorporated as Morris Commercial Cars Limited, began the manufacture of light commercial vehicles with a 1-ton truck. By 1930 trucks of from 10 cwt up to 5 tons capacity were being made and Dictator and Imperial single and double-decker buses. ==See also== * List of car manufacturers of the United Kingdom ==References== Category:Defunct companies based in Birmingham, West Midlands Category:Manufacturing companies based in Birmingham, West Midlands Category:Engineering companies of the United Kingdom Category:Automotive companies of the United Kingdom Category:Cyclecars Category:Defunct motor vehicle manufacturers of England Category:British companies established in 1898 Category:Vehicle manufacturing companies established in 1898 Category:Manufacturing companies disestablished in 1924 Category:1898 establishments in England Category:1924 disestablishments in England Category:British companies disestablished in 1924 ","title":"EG Wrigley and Company"},{"id":"3230839","text":"Website defacement is an attack on a website that changes the visual appearance of a website or a web page.

Corporations are also targeted more often than other websites on the World Wide Web and they often seek to take measures to protect themselves from defacement or hacking in general. Websites represent the image of a company or organisation and these are therefore suffer significant losses due to defacement.

The peak on the left is Bald Rock Mountain. The Brushy Mountains are a mountain range located in northwestern North Carolina. They are an isolated \\"spur\\" of the much larger Blue Ridge Mountains, separated from them by the Yadkin River valley.North Carolina: The History of a Southern State, by Hugh Talmadge Lefler & Albert Ray Newsome, Copyright 1973, University of North Carolina Press. A deeply eroded range, they move from the southwest to the northeast, and cross five counties in North Carolina: Caldwell, Alexander, Wilkes, Iredell, and Yadkin. The Brushy Mountains divide, for much of their courses, the waters of the Yadkin River and the Catawba River, two of central North Carolina's largest rivers. The range is approximately long, but only 4 to 8 miles wide. The highest point in the chain is Pores Knob (2,680 feet, 817 meters), in Wilkes County. Among the other notable peaks in the range are Hibriten Mountain in Caldwell County, which marks the western end of the Brushy Mountains and is a prominent landmark in the city of Lenoir, North Carolina; Hickory Knob, the highest point in Alexander County, North Carolina; and Fox Mountain, the highest point in Iredell County, North Carolina. The \\"Brushies\\", as they are often called by locals, usually rise from 300 to above the surrounding countryside, with few peaks rising more than a thousand feet above their base. The forests on the mountains are part of the Southeastern mixed forests ecoregion. The Mountains are primarily known for their abundance of fruit orchards. The last Saturday in July is the Brushy Mountain Peach and Heritage Festival hosted by the Community Center and held in Downtown Wilkesboro. On the first Saturday in October, the Brushy Mountain Apple Festival is hosted by the Brushy Mountain Ruritan Club and held in North Wilkesboro, North Carolina each year to celebrate the harvest. The region was also once known as a hotbed of \\"moonshining\\", or the production of illegal homemade liquor. Several of the earliest stars of stock-car racing in the 1940s and 1950s got their start in the moonshining business in the Brushy Mountains. James Larkin Pearson, a newspaper publisher and editor who served as North Carolina's official Poet Laureate from 1953 to 1981, was born and raised in the Brushy Mountains, and lived in the Brushies his entire life.

He represented Western Australia as well as his native Victoria in the Sheffield Shield and also played county cricket for Hampshire. He was part of Sheffield Shield-winning sides in 1979‚Äì80 (Victoria) and 1983‚Äì84 (Western Australia). ==Biography== Graf was born in 1957 in Somerville, Victoria, Australia. Educated at St Bede's College, Graf made his grade debut at the age of 19 for St Kilda Cricket Club in the 1976‚Äì77 season as an all-rounder, bowling right-arm medium fast and batting left-handed with an emphasis on driving. Graf travelled to England during 1979 and played for Wilshire in the Minor Counties competition. Highlights include 51 against Oxfordshire, 7‚Äì73 against Dorset and 79 and four wickets against Berkshire. He took 6‚Äì27 playing for the Gloucestershire Second XI. ===1979‚Äì80 First Class Debut=== Graf made his first-class debut in 1979‚Äì80 for Victoria. He turned in a number of notable performances that season, including 3‚Äì24 against WA, 58 not out against WA, and seven wickets against South Australia. Graf also had some good games in the McDonald's Cup. In his debut he took 1‚Äì44 and 19 not out against SA, helping Victoria win by three wickets. In the final he took 2‚Äì34, helping Victoria win the game and the championship. Victoria also won the Sheffield Shield that season. In grade cricket, Graf took 4‚Äì54 and scored 93 helping St Kilda beat Melbourne. He took five wickets in the final but Footscray won the match. ===1980 ‚Äì Hampshire=== Graf received an offer to play over the 1980 English summer with the Hampshire County Cricket Club. He performed disappointingly, scoring 214 runs at 19 and only exceeding 50 in a first-class game once, and taking only 16 first-class wickets at an average of 48 with best figures of 2‚Äì24. Highlights included 44 against Oxford, Hampshire came last that season. and 57 not out against Essex in his final county game. His form was slightly better in one day games, taking 3‚Äì44 against Derbyshire, 2‚Äì12 against Somerset, 3‚Äì26 against Lancashire, and 2‚Äì24 against Essex. He also had some good games for the Hampshire 2nd XI, taking five wickets and scoring 51 in one game. ===1980‚Äì81 ‚Äì International Player=== Graf's first- class form was better in the Australian 1980‚Äì81 season. In his first Shield game, against WA, he scored 34 and 64 and took four wickets. He leapt into international consideration in another game against WA, scoring 100 not out and taking 3‚Äì24. In one day games he took 2‚Äì6 against Queensland. Australia was looking for an all rounder and these efforts saw Graf named in the Test team for the second Test against the touring New Zealand. Graf wound up as 12th man though and did not play. He was however selected to make his ODI debut in November 1980 against New Zealand at the Adelaide Oval. \\"If we have a deficiency at the moment, it is possibly that we lack a true all-rounder\\", said Australian captain Greg Chappell at the time. \\"Shaun Graf is an up-and- comer in this area and he is possibly what Australia needs ‚Äì not only in one day cricket but in Test matches as well\\". Graf made a duck and took 1/40 in the match. He was kept on in the side for the next game, against New Zealand, taking 2‚Äì40. Against India he took 0‚Äì30 and scored 5. He took 0‚Äì15 against New Zealand and 2‚Äì23 against India. Graf was dropped from the Australian Test team for the third Test against New Zealand due to a back injury, which saw him miss a Shield game; he was replaced by Trevor Chappell, who played as 12th man. Graf passed a fitness test and replaced Chappell for the first Test against India; however Graf was made 12th man again. He was replaced in the next test by Bruce Yardley. In one day cricket Graf took 0‚Äì31 against India, 2‚Äì40 and 7 in a thrilling one run loss to New Zealand, scored 2 and took 1‚Äì36 against India and scored 2 against New Zealand. Graf played in nine of Australia's ten group matches in that season's triangular ODI tournament, but was omitted from the team for the finals series after scoring just 16 runs at an average of 3.20 with a top score of 7 despite being picked as an all- rounder batting at number seven or eight. He did manage to take eight wickets at 31.88 in the series, with three two-wicket hauls. Towards the end of the summer he was dropped in favour of Graeme Beard. Towards the end of the season, Graf took six wickets and scored 51 in a game against Queensland and 3‚Äì40 in a McDonald's Cup game. However his form was not particularly strong in other matches and he was overlooked for selection on the 1981 tour of England (Graeme Beard and Trevor Chappell went instead). ===1981‚Äì82=== The following season Graf's highlights include five wickets in a Shield game against Queensland and scores of 55 and 39 against NSW Graf returned to the Australian one day side in the second and third matches of the ODI series, replacing an injured Dennis Lillee. He made his top score of eight against Pakistan at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, but after failing to take a wicket in that match, he conceded an expensive 56 runs in nine overs without success against the West Indies in the following match, and was dropped. He took 3‚Äì28 in a state one day game. ===1982‚Äì83=== Graf was unable to force his way back into the Australian one day side the following summer. He had his best first-class bowling returns to date against WA, taking 4‚Äì53 and 5‚Äì95. and played excellently in the McDonald's Cup semi final against WA, scoring 29 and taking 4‚Äì15. The majority of the rest of his performances were disappointing, however. Graf returned to England for the 1983 English summer, playing for Cornwall in the Minor Counties Championship. Highlights include 7 wickets against Devon, 46 against Buckinghamshire, 62 and 56 against Cheshire, 60 against Shropshire, and 4‚Äì19 against Dorset. ===1983‚Äì84 Move to WA=== In 1983‚Äì84 he moved to Western Australia for one year, and was part of the winning Sheffield Shield team. Highlights included 3‚Äì55 against WA, 54 and four wickets against Pakistan, scores of 34 and 73 plus three wickets in a narrow victory over Victoria, 74 and 31 not out against Queensland, and five wickets against Tasmania. In the final against Queensland, Graf took 3‚Äì111 and 3‚Äì34 and scored 14 and 17 not out; he was at the crease when WA won by four wickets. In the McDonald's Cup final, Graf's late innings knock of 37 off 33 balls brought WA within eight runs of victory. Graf returned to Victoria the following season, playing one Shield game (scoring 49 and taking four wickets against Queensland) before retiring. In all, he played 55 matches, scoring 1,559 runs at an average of 25.14 with one century, and claimed 124 wickets at an average of 33.91 with a best bowling of 5/95. In limited overs matches, he averaged 25.22 with the bat and 25 with the ball. ===Later career=== He became a Victorian selector in 1990‚Äì91 and became the cricket operations manager of the Victorian Cricket Association in 1995. Graf played grade cricket for St Kilda until the 1999‚Äì2000 season. St Kilda won the competition in 1984‚Äì85 and 1985‚Äì86 (Graf scored 58 in the final). They reached the final in 1989‚Äì90 after a semi final where Graf scored 53 and took 6‚Äì39; they lost the final despite Graf taking two wickets and scoring 102. They won the competition in 1991‚Äì92 with Graf taking 2‚Äì41 ‚Äì Shane Warne was in the St Kilda team. ==See also== * List of Victoria first-class cricketers * List of Western Australia first- class cricketers == References == * Category:1957 births Category:Living people Category:Australia One Day International cricketers Category:Hampshire cricketers Category:Victoria cricketers Category:Western Australia cricketers Category:Wiltshire cricketers Category:Cornwall cricketers Category:Australian cricketers Category:Cricketers from Victoria (Australia) Category:Sportspeople from Melbourne ","title":"Shaun Graf"},{"id":"3230899","text":"(born , 20 February 1950 ‚Äì 29 March 2020) was a Japanese comedian. He co- starred with Masashi Tashiro, Nobuyoshi Kuwano in the Japanese variety show '. Throughout his comedy career, Shimura was known for his \\"Bakatono-sama\\" character, which was unusual among Japanese comedians, in that he could satirize the deeds of powerful figures (a company president, a politician, a family head, a school principal, the head of a Japanese yakuza gang) under the garb of a foolish king who lived in the country a long time ago. Another popular shtick of Shimura in the same show was \\"Henna Oji-san\\" [weirdo] who entertained himself in the company of nubile girls. After being caught for his pranks, the character regularly ended the shtick with a song 'Sou desu. Watashi wa Henna Oji-san desu'. (\\"That is correct. I am Henna Oji-san.\\") He was also known for his nonsense catchphrase \\"Daffuna\\" which would often end a Henna Oji-san skit. Shimura was most famous for starring in with the comedy group The Drifters and Fun TV with Kato-chan and Ken-chan with Cha Kato, another former member of The Drifters. Shimura's comedic work was inspired in part by that of Jerry Lewis. == Career == Shimura became known in 1974, replacing Chu Arai in the famous comedy group The Drifters. With the help of the other members of the group, he learned to act and make the audience laugh. Over time, he showed a knack for comedy. Some memorable pictures of that time are the mustache dance, in which he starred with Cha Kat≈ç and the song Higashimurayama, referring to his homeland. With this group, he participated in the weekly program Hachiji Dayo! Zen'inshugo! from 1974 to 1985, reaching 40% to 50% of viewers at their best. From 1977, he also participated in the television program Dorifu Daibakusho (\\"Dorifu, big burst of laughter\\"), which were special sketches, totaling one and a half hours. It is currently possible to see members together only on television specials. The rapport Shimura had with Cha Kat≈ç, also a member of Higashimurayama, kept them together on television. In 1986, they created the Kato-chan Ken-chan Gokigen Terebi, which aired until 1992. In The Detective Story, they are two detective friends who get into a lot of trouble. The high ratings allowed for high-cost scenes with exploding cars, helicopters and crowds. A famous painting of this time is Shimura as a monk, who asked people to repeat the words \\"Daijoubuda, ... ueh, ueh, ueh\\", whereas \\"daijoubuda\\" literally means \\"I'm all right.\\" This program ran about three times a year since 1986. In it, Shimura is a feudal lord (\\"tono\\") who does not want to rule and only thinks about having fun. The character was created at the time of Hachiji Dayo! Zen'inshugo! and is characterized by an all-white face, extremely thick eyebrows and hair tied at the top of the head. The program always featured celebrity stakes. \\"Ken Shimura Daijoubuda\\" from 1987 to 1993 and was the beginning of Shimura's career as the sole leader. His new companions were also his \\"disciples\\" in the sense that they learned from Shimura. Among others, Masashi Tashiro, his first favorite \\"disciple\\", Yoko Ishino, favorite \\"disciple\\" and former bride Nobuyoshi Kuwano, who played the trumpet, and Noriko Matsumoto. At that time, Shimura created the famous character \\"henna ojisan\\", which means \\"strange uncle\\". ===Post-Daijoubuda=== Following up his previous big hits, Shimura led several shows, mostly on the Fuji TV network with the renewal of his \\"disciples\\". The most famous of them was Masashi Tashiro. However, after Tashiro's involvement with voyeurism, drugs, and subsequent arrests, Shimura, disappointed, cut him from their act. From 1996, he began working with newbie Yuuka, who eventually became his favorite \\"disciple\\". Shimura's participation in the career of humorists (such as Katsuhiro Higo and Ryuuhei Ueshima, and Haruna Kondou and Haruka Minowa) and other celebrities is notorious. *1993‚Äì1995: Shimura Ken wa Ikagadeshou (\\"How about a Ken Shimura\\") ‚Äì with Masashi Tashiro, Yoko Ishino, Nobuyoshi Kuwano, Minayo Watanabe, etc. *1995‚Äì1996: Shimura Ken no Ore ga Nani Shitano yo (\\"Ken Shimura's What the Hell Did I do?\\") ‚Äì with Masashi Tashiro, Nobuyoshi Kuwano, Minayo Watanabe, etc. *1996‚Äì1997: Shimura X ‚Äì with Maiko Kawakami, Yukiko Someya, Kazumi Murata, Yuuka, Housei Yamasaki and Ryuuhei Ueshima. *1997‚Äì1998: Shimura XYZ ‚Äì with Maiko Kawakami, Yukiko Someya, Kazumi Murata, Yuuka, Housei Yamasaki and Ryuuhei Ueshima. *1998‚Äì2000: Shimura X-Tengoku (\\"Shimura Paradise X\\") ‚Äì with Maiko Kawakami, Yukiko Someya, Kazumi Murata, Yuuka, Housei Yamasaki and Ryuuhei Ueshima. *2000‚Äì2002: Henna Ojisan TV (\\"Strange Uncle's TV\\") ‚Äì with Yuuka, Katsuhiro Higo, Ryuuhei Ueshima, Masanori Ishii and Yoshiyuki Ishizuka. *2002‚Äì2004: Shimura Ryuu (\\"Shimura's Style\\") ‚Äì with Yuuka, Katsuhiro Higo, Ryuuhei Ueshima, Masanori Ishii, Yoshiyuki Ishizuka, Chizuru Yamada and Ayumi Kato. *2004: Shimura Juku (\\"Shimura's Class\\") ‚Äì with Yuuka, Katsuhiro Higo, Ryuuhei Ueshima, Masanori Ishii, Yoshiyuki Ishizuka, Chizuru Yamada, Ayumi Kato, etc. *2004‚Äì2005: Shimura Tsuu (\\"Shimura, a tasteful person\\") ‚Äì with Yuuka, Katsuhiro Higo, Ryuuhei Ueshima, Jun Natsukawa, Chizuru Yamada, etc. *2005‚Äì2008: Shimura Ken no Daijoubuda II (\\"Ken Shimura's I'm All Right II\\") ‚Äì with Yuuka, Katsuhiro Higo, Ryuuhei Ueshima, Wakako Shimazaki, Jun Natsukawa and Chen Qu. *2004‚Äì2020: Tensai!

Shimura D≈çbutsuen continued airing after Shimura's death, with on air remembrances of his time with the animals. On July 4, 2020, it was reported that Nippon TV had decided to end the broadcast, citing that it would be painfully difficult and heartbreaking to continue filming in a set filled with memories, that was destined for Shimura's advice.

His mother had a degree in furniture technologies. In 1978, he was baptized as a Russian Orthodox at the age of one year, but wore no pectoral cross until the first one was given to him in 1988 or 1989, while attending church together with his grandmother. Mother could not accept such fact, but Yevgeny never removed the cross; later he began wearing it not with chain, but with a small string. After finishing ninth grade at a rural school of Kurilovo in Moscow Oblast, he began to work at a furniture factory and trained to be a driver. == Military service and capture == A cross on Yevgeny Rodionov's tomb in Satino-Russkoye village Though Yevgeny aspired to be a cook, he was conscripted into the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation on 25 June 1995. His training took place in 2631 Military Unit of Russian Border Troops in Ozersk, Kalningrad Oblast. On 10 July 1995 the military oath was taken by private Rodionov. He was deployed to Chechnya, where he served in the Russian army's border troops as RPG operator at 3rd border outpost of 3rd Motorised Maneuvre Group of 479th Border Troops Special Operations Unit (No. 3807)¬´‚Ä¶–°–º–µ—Ä—Ç—å –æ—Ç –º—É—á–∏—Ç–µ–ª–µ–π —è–∫–æ —á–∞—à—É –•—Ä–∏—Å—Ç–æ–≤—É –ø—Ä–∏—è–≤¬ª // –°–∞–π—Ç –°–æ—é–∑–∞ –†–∞–±–æ—Ç–Ω–∏–∫–æ–≤ –ü—Ä–∞–≤–æ–æ—Ö—Ä–∞–Ω–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω—ã—Ö –û—Ä–≥–∞–Ω–æ–≤.. On 13 January 1996 Yevgeny was deployed to Caucasus Special Border District to Nazran Border Unit (No. 2094) where he served for one month. A month later, on 14 February 1996, he went to mount guard over the road accompanied by privates Andrey Trusov, Igor Yakovlev and Alexander Zheleznov. During their duty an ambulance car transporting weapons and driven by Chechen Republic of Ichkeria brigade general Ruslan Khaikhoroev was stopped by soldiers. During their attempt to examine the ambulance all of them were overpowered by dozen of Chechen rebels and taken prisoners. Initially the soldiers were announced as deserters, and military police came to Yevgeny's mother's home to search for her missing son. Only after the detailed survey of the checkpoint the soldiers the traces of blood and fighting were discovered by the military police, and then three missing soldiers were declared as missed in action and possibly taken prisoners. Yevgeny's mother Lybov came to Chechnya, but Yevgeny's unit commander only told her that her son had been captured. Shamil Basayev promised to help Lybov to find her son, but after the meeting she was brutally beaten by Basayev's brother, who had broken her spine. Only after paying big amount of money Lybov has found the corpse of her son. It was revealed that on 23 May 1996, on Yevgeny's 19th birthday, after more than 100 days of tortures, Yevgeny and two other soldiers were offered to renounce their Christian faith and convert to Islam in order to save his life. Yevgeny refused to convert to Islam and even to remove his silver cross he wore. After that decision he was beheaded by Chechen rebels. The soldier was killed in the outskirts of the Chechen village Bamut. Ruslan Khaikhoroev, the murderer, accompanied by OSCE representative, later confessed in the murder of Yevgeny Rodionov, saying to Yevgeny's mother: \\"Your [Yevgeny's mother] son had a choice to stay alive. He could have converted to Islam, but he did not agree to take the cross off. He also tried to escape once.\\"\\"Russian Soldier Goes Through Chechen Captivity Hell\\", Pravda Online, January 8, 2003. Andrey Trusov was beheaded, Igor Yakovlev and Alexander Zheleznov were shot dead. The Yevgeny's cross was given to St. Nicholas Church in Pyzhy.

There was a growing movement within the Russian Orthodox Church to canonize him as a Christian saint and martyr for faith. Some Russian soldiers, feeling themselves abandoned by their government, have taken to kneeling in prayer before his image. One such prayer reads: > Thy martyr, Yevgeny, O Lord, in his sufferings hath received an > incorruptible crown from Thee, our God, for having Thy strength he hath > brought down his torturers, hath defeated the powerless insolence of demons. > Through his prayers, save our souls. , religious icons depicting Yevgeny had become popular. His mother has one herself; she has suggested that the icon of her son sometimes emits a perfume which she believes to be holy, to the extent that it actually drips with it. Because of the popular devotion given to the New Martyr Yevgeny, the pious faithful sought official canonization from the Moscow Patriarchate. Initially, it refused, which divided the Orthodox Church in Russia. Maksim Maksimov, Secretary of the Canonization Commission, explained the Synod's position in Tserkovny Vestnik (Church Bulletin), the official publication of the Russian Orthodox Church. His arguments can be summarized in three points: #The only evidence that the soldier was executed for this faith is the testimony of his mother, who in her love made a god of her son; #The Russian Orthodox Church has never canonized anyone killed in war; #The period of new martyrs ended with the collapse of the Bolshevik regime. However, he emphasized that the deceased can be honoured without canonization. Patriarch Alexy II of Moscow personally blessed the popular account of Yevgeny's life but worried that his cult would balloon into anti-Muslim rage. Opponents of the decision, including Alexander Shargunov, a well-known priest, argued that an outbreak of people's love is enough for the truth and that Yevgeny's grave works miracles, curing the sick and reconciling enemies. They also pointed out that the soldier did not die at war but in captivity and that to say that the time of martyrs is over is nearly heresy. ==References== ==External links== *\\"Boy soldier who died for faith made 'saint'\\", The Daily Telegraph, January 24, 2004 *\\"A Drive to Turn a Soldier Into a Saint\\", The Moscow Times, October 19, 2004 * Evgeniy Aleksandrovich Rodionov (1977-1996) Find A Grave memorial *\\"From Village Boy to Soldier, Martyr and, Many Say, Saint\\", The New York Times, November 21, 2003 *\\"The First Saint of the Chechen War\\", RIAN, October 5, 2004 Category:1977 births Category:1996 deaths Category:Christians executed for refusing to convert to Islam Category:Islamism-related beheadings Category:Executed people from Penza Oblast Category:Executed Russian people Category:Folk saints Category:People from Kuznetsky District, Penza Oblast Category:People of the Chechen wars Category:Persecution by Muslims Category:Prisoners of war massacres Category:Recipients of the Order of Courage Category:Russian military personnel Category:Russian Orthodox Christians from Russia Category:Russian prisoners of war Category:20th-century Eastern Orthodox martyrs ","title":"Yevgeny Rodionov"},{"id":"3230902","text":"Jesse Fuller (March 12, 1896 ‚Äì January 29, 1976) was an American one-man band musician, best known for his song \\"San Francisco Bay Blues\\". ==Early life== Fuller was born in Jonesboro, Georgia, near Atlanta. He was sent by his mother to live with foster parents when he was a young child, in a rural setting where he was badly mistreated. Growing up, he worked at numerous jobs: grazing cows for ten cents a day; working in a barrel factory, a broom factory, and a rock quarry; working on a railroad and for a streetcar company; shining shoes; and even peddling hand-carved wooden snakes.Koenig, Lester (1963). Liner notes to Jesse Fuller: San Francisco Bay Blues. Good Time Jazz S10051. By the age of 10, he was playing the guitar in two techniques, which he described as \\"frailing\\" and \\"picking.\\" In the 1920s he lived in southern California, where he operated a hot-dog stand and was befriended by Douglas Fairbanks. He worked briefly as a film extra in The Thief of Bagdad (1924) and East of Suez. In 1929 he settled in Oakland, across the bay from San Francisco, where he worked for the Southern Pacific Railroad for many years as a fireman, spike driver, and maintenance-of-way worker. He married, and he and his wife, Gertrude, had a family. During World War II, he worked as a shipyard welder, but when the war ended he found it increasingly difficult to secure employment. Around the early 1950s, Fuller began to consider the possibility of making a living as a musician. ==Music career== Up to this point, Fuller had never worked as a full-time professional musician, but he was an accomplished guitarist and he had carried his guitar with him and busked for money by passing the hat. He had a good memory for songs and had a large repertoire of crowd-pleasers in diverse styles, including country blues, work songs, ragtime and jazz standards, ballads, spirituals, and instrumentals. For a while, he operated a shoe-shine stand, where he sang and danced to entertain passersby. He began to compose songs, many of them based on his experiences on the railroads, and also reworked older pieces, playing them in his syncopated style. When he set out to make a career as a musician, he had difficulty finding reliable musicians to work with: thus his one-man band act was born, and he started calling himself \\"The Lone Cat.\\" Starting locally, in clubs and bars in San Francisco and across the bay in Oakland and Berkeley, Fuller became more widely known when he performed on television in both the Bay Area and Los Angeles. In 1958, at the age of 62, he recorded his first album, released by Good Time Jazz Records. Fuller's instruments included 6-string guitar (an instrument which he had abandoned before the beginning of his one-man band career), 12-string guitar, harmonica, kazoo, cymbal (high-hat) and fotdella. He could play several instruments simultaneously, particularly with the use of a headpiece to hold a harmonica, kazoo, and microphone. In addition, he would generally include at least one tap dance, soft-shoe, or buck and wing in his sets, accompanying himself on a 12-string guitar as he danced. His style was open and engaging. In typical busker's fashion, he addressed his audiences as \\"ladies and gentlemen,\\" told humorous anecdotes, and cracked jokes between songs. He told of his love of his wife and family, but some of his stories were anything but cheerful, often including recapitulations of his tragic childhood, his mother's illness and early death, his determination to escape the segregated racial system of the South, suicide, and death. The British label Topic Records issued his album Working on the Railroad in 1959 as a 10-inch vinyl LP, including \\"San Francisco Bay Blues\\". This recording is included as track six on the first CD of the Topic Records 70-year anniversary boxed set Three Score and Ten. ==The fotdella== The fotdella was a musical instrument of Fuller's own creation and construction. He built at least two of them, in slightly different patterns, as evidenced in photographs and film footage of his performances. As a one-man band, Fuller wanted to supply a more substantial accompaniment than the typical high-hat (cymbal) or bass drum used by other street musicians. His solution was the fotdella, a foot-operated percussion bass, consisting of an upright wood box, shaped like the top of a double bass, with a short neck at the top, and six piano bass strings attached to the neck and stretched down over the body. The strings were played by means of six piano or organ pedals, each connected to a padded piano hammer which struck a string.Van Ronk, Dave, and Wood, Elijah (2005). The Mayor of MacDougal Street. Boston: Da Capo Press. . Removing his shoe and placing his sock-covered foot in a rotating heel cradle, Fuller played the six pedals of the fotdella like a piano. With the instrument's six notes, he could play bass lines in several keys. He occasionally played without it, if a song exceeded its limited range. The name was coined by his wife, who took to calling the instrument a \\"foot-diller\\" (a \\"killer-diller\\" instrument played with the foot), which was shortened to fotdella. The term foot piano has been used by some performers and musicologists to describe this type of instrument. ==Death== Fuller died in January 1976 in Oakland, California, from heart disease, at the age of 79. He was interred at Evergreen Cemetery, in Oakland. His fotdella and his 1962 Silvertone Electric-Acoustic guitar (the latter purchased from a Sears and Roebuck store in Detroit to replace his Maurer guitar, which had been stolen while he was on tour) are in the possession of the Smithsonian Institution. ==Influence== Fuller influenced and has had songs covered by Bob Dylan (\\"You're No Good\\")Dalton, David (2012).

During Fuller's UK tour in 1965, Don Partridge booked him for a sold-out concert in Ealing and was so influenced by Fuller that he developed his own stand-up one-man band concept for street busking in the UK, later leading to his pop success.Keene, Pat; Warner, Rod (2011).

The book sold more than a million copies worldwide. The Hindi movie 3 Idiots is based on this book.The book was also adapted into a play by the theatre company \\"Evam. ==Plot== The book is narrated by Hari, with some small passages by his friends Ryan and Alok, as well as a letter by Hari's girlfriend Neha Cherian. It deals with the lives of the 3 friends, whose elation on making it to one of the best engineering colleges in India is quickly deflated by the rigour and monotony of the academic work. Most of the book deals with the numerous attempts by the trio to cope with and/or beat the system as well as Hari's fling with Neha who just happens to be the daughter of Prof. Cherian, the domineering head of the Mechanical Engineering department of their college. It takes some dark turns every now and then, especially when it comes to the families of the protagonists. Most of the action, however, takes place inside the campus as the boys, led by the ever creative Ryan, frequently lamenting how the internationally lauded IIT system has stifled their creativity by forcing them to value grades more than anything else. Uninspiring teaching and numerous assignments add to their woes, though the boys do find a sympathiser in Prof Veera. ==Characters== ===Hari Kumar=== Hari Kumar is the narrator of the story. While he talks about others a lot he doesn't really talk about himself. Hari lacks confidence and is very bad at vivas. He isn't very attractive and is a 'loser' like Alok. R. Madhavan plays Farhan Qureshi, a character based on Hari in 3 Idiots while Srikanth plays the role in the Tamil remake Nanban. === Ryan Oberoi=== He is rich, creative and likes original ideas (like Professor Veera). He cares a lot for his friends and claims not to love his parents, even though he hints he misses them every now and then.He is a machine-lover. His character is played by Aamir Khan as Ranchoddas \\"Rancho\\" Shamaldas Chanchad / Phunsukh Wangdu (Hindi) and Vijay as Panjavan Paariventhan / Kozakshi Pasapugazh (Tamil) in the film adaptations. ===Alok Gupta=== He is a 'cry baby', fat and a loser as claimed by his friend Ryan. His family is poor and he is in IIT for them. His sister is not getting married as he does not have enough dowry to give the groom's family. In the start of the story he dislikes Ryan as he is always having fun and not studying but, after he comes back after breaking friendship with Ryan and Hari, his perspective about Ryan changes. Alok is played by Sharman Joshi as Raju Rastogi in the movie 3 Idiots and by Jiiva in Nanban. ==Translation== The book has been translated into Hindi and is published by Prabhat Prakash.Advaniji releases two novels; Five Point Someone and One Night @ the Call Centre. Organiser. 9 November 2008. p. 12 It set a record by being purchased by 30,000 people in one month, and has gone on to become a top seller in Hindi.Jagran Yahoo! India. In.jagran.yahoo.com. Retrieved 5 January 2012. ==Reception== Despite its commercial success, the book was universally panned by contemporary book critics in India, with some calling it 'fast food literature'. Many discarded it as 'Bollywood on paper' referring to its over the top nature. ==Film adaptations== This book was made into two films, 3 Idiots in Hindi and Nanban in Tamil. The names of the characters and their attributes were changed. Also, both the films were not full adaptations of the books, as many of the scenes from the book, including the climax, were changed in the films. *Ryan Oberoi : Ranchoddas Shamaldas Chanchad (Rancho) aka Phunsukh Wangdu (played by Aamir Khan (Hindi))/Panchavan Parivendan (Pari) aka Kosaksi Pasupugazh (played by Vijay (Tamil)), ‚Äì A young, energetic and supposedly wealthy college going student who is passionate about engineering. Though Rancho wants to be an engineer, he leans more towards inventing rather than seeking for a job in an MNC unlike his other college-mates. According to him, one's profession should be something he or she loves doing, irrespective of how much it pays. He also keeps stating throughout the film that one should run after excellence, not after success. Rancho also believes in the concept of \\"All Is Well\\", in which people should focus on the present and live it as it is, instead of worrying over the future. There are many significant differences between the Ryan and Rancho characters, both in their background and attitudes. *Hari Kumar : Farhan Qureshi (played by Madhavan (Hindi))/Venkat Ramakrishnan (played by Srikanth (Tamil)) ‚Äì The narrator of the story, a young college going student who loves wildlife photography, but is being forced by his parents to become an engineer. Hari's background (as acknowledged in one chapter of the book) was not elaborated upon. However, Hari seemed to be auto-biographical and the \\"Krish\\" character in Chetan Bhagat's 2 States (who apparently continues on from the Hari character) would provide greater details about Hari's background. *Alok Gupta : Raju Rastogi (played by Sharman Joshi (Hindi))/Sevarkodi Senthil (played by Jiiva (Tamil)) ‚Äì A young and insecure college going student who isn't confident enough to deal with problems in life all by himself and always relies on God. Raju's only mission in life is to pull his family out of poverty, improve their economic status and get his elder sister married. This character is very similar to the one in the book. *Prof. Cherian : Viru Sahastrabuddhe (Virus) (played by Boman Irani (Hindi))/Virumaandi Santhanam (played by Sathyaraj (Tamil)) ‚Äì A hugely competitive, efficient, strict and disciplined man who has been running the Imperial College of Engineering (Ideal Engineering College in Tamil) for the last three decades. He believes that life is a race, the ones who are not efficient about work and time get crushed. He sneers at Rancho's concept of studying for knowledge rather than marks and constantly spars with him and his friends due to this. He is known as \\"Virus\\" among the students. Virus has a greater role at the college when compared to Prof. Cherian. *Neha Cherian : Pia Sahastrabuddhe (played by Kareena Kapoor (Hindi))/Ria Santhanam (played by Ileana D'Cruz (Tamil)) ‚Äì A young, beautiful, eccentric doctor, daughter of Viru Sahastrabuddhe and Rancho's love interest. This character is a complete departure from the book, because in the book, she was Hari's girlfriend. Also while Pia and Rancho finally end up together, Neha and Hari maintain a long distance relationship despite of Hari's job at Mumbai and Neha at Delhi. *Venkat : Chatur Ramalingam (played by Omi Vaidya in Hindi)/Srivatsan (played by Sathyan in Tamil) ‚Äì A competitive and studious South Indian college student (NRI student in Tamil) who believes rote learning is the only way to excellence and also believes that there is no time for creativity and innovation in the turbulent and competitive race of life. Venkat has a small role in the book, while Chatur is one of the major characters in the movie. Following the success of 3 Idiots in East Asian markets such as China and Hong Kong, the producer Vidhu Vinod Chopra has announced that Hong Kong film star Stephen Chow (known for comedy films such as Shaolin Soccer and Kung Fu Hustle) will be producing a Chinese remake of the film. Chopra also announced that there are plans for a Hollywood remake, and is in talks with three different American studios interested in remaking the film. Chopra stated that there is an Italian film studio also interested in remaking the film. == Awards == *Indo-America Society's Society Young Achiever's Award (2004) *The Publisher's Recognition Award (2005) *It was adapted into a play by the theatre company \\"Evam\\" which took it on a national tour in India in 2010. == 3 Idiots controversy == Before the release of the film, director Rajkumar Hirani commented on the relationship between Five Point Someone and 3 Idiots stating: :Chetan gave me this book to read and I wanted to make a film on it. But I knew right from the start that I could not make a film completely on the book, as it was very anecdotal and a film needs a plot. So I had decided to rewrite it in a screenplay format. You'll see that the film is very different from the book. After I wrote the script, I called Chetan and narrated it to him. I told him that if he did not like the script, I would stop the project. But he was okay with it.\\"Aamir's dedication is mistaken as interference\\", Rediff.com, 23 December 2009. The day after the film opened, Chetan also noted: :Initially I did sit down with Raju and Abhijat while they were deciding to make a film based on 'Five Point Someone'. I even went to IIT with Abhijat a couple of times. But it was just not possible for me to be involved at every stage of the screenplay writing process since I was in Hong Kong at that time, working full-time and busy writing other books. Moreover, Abhijat is based in USA, Raju was in the US for quite a while working on the screenplay but it was not practical for me to do that [...] The film retains the soul of the book. 3 Idiots is different from the book but at the same time it does borrow many things from the book. The core theme and message of the film is coming from the book itself. And that's why the makers have officially credited the film as 'Based on a novel by Chetan Bhagat.'\\"3 Idiots retains the soul of Five Point Someone\\" , Chetan Bhagat interview, One India. A controversy developed a few days after the release, however, over the fact that Chetan's credit, \\"Based on the novel Five Point Someone by Chetan Bhagat\\" appeared in the closing credits rather than in the opening ones. At that time, Bhagat stated that he \\"was expecting an opening credit and I was quite surprised on not seeing it.

The Greek physician Galen believed that muscles contracted due to a fluid flowing into them, and for 1500 years afterward, it was believed that nerves were hollow and that they carried fluid. Ren√© Descartes, who was interested in hydraulics and used fluid pressure to explain various aspects of physiology such as the reflex arc, proposed that \\"animal spirits\\" flowed into muscle and were responsible for their contraction.Columbia University. History of Neuroscience. Retrieved on January 25, 2007. In the model, which Descartes used to explain reflexes, the spirits would flow from the ventricles of the brain, through the nerves, and to the muscles to animate the latter. In 1667, Thomas Willis proposed that muscles may expand by the reaction of animal spirits with vital spirits. He hypothesized that this reaction would produce air in a manner similar to the reaction that causes an explosion, causing muscles to swell and produce movement. ==Physiological refutations of the theory== Swammerdam's illustration of a nerve-muscle preparation. He placed a frog thigh muscle in a glass syringe with a nerve protruding from a hole in the side of the container. Irritating the nerve caused the muscle to contract, but the level of the water, and thus the volume of the muscle, did not increase. In 1667, Jan Swammerdam, a Dutch anatomist famous for working with insects, struck the first important blow against the balloonist theory. Swammerdam, who was the first to experiment on nerve-muscle preparations, showed that muscles do not increase in size when they contract (and he supposed if a substance such as animal spirits flowed into muscles, their volume should increase when they contract). Swammerdam placed severed frog thigh muscle in an airtight syringe with a small amount of water in the tip. He could thus determine whether there was a change the volume of the muscle when it contracted by observing a change in the level of the water (image at right). When Swammerdam caused the muscle to contract by irritating the nerve, the water level did not rise but rather was lowered by a minute amount; this showed that no air or fluid could be flowing into the muscle. Swammerdam did not believe the results of his own experiment, suggesting that they were the result of artifact. However, he concluded in his book The Book of Nature II that \\"motion or irritation of the nerve alone is necessary to produce muscular motion\\". This idea was an important step toward the current understanding of how nerves actually cause muscle contraction. Balloonist theory took a second hit from Francis Glisson who performed an experiment in which a man flexed a muscle under water. The water level did not go up (in fact it went down slightly), further supporting the conclusion that no air or fluid could be entering the muscle. Giovanni Alfonso Borelli performed an experiment to test the idea that muscle is inflated by air. He slit the muscle of an animal under water and watched to see whether bubbles of air would rise to the surface. Since no bubbles were seen to rise, this experiment helped to refute the balloonist theory. The invention of the microscope allowed preparations of nerves to be viewed at high magnification, showing that they are not hollow. In 1791, Luigi Galvani learned that frogs' muscles could be made to move by the application of electricity. This finding provided a basis for the current understanding that electrical energy (carried by ions), and not air or fluid, is the impetus behind muscle movement. ==See also== *Passions of the Soul ==References== Category:History of neuroscience Category:Muscular system ","title":"Balloonist theory"},{"id":"3230933","text":"WNTR is a commercial radio station located in Indianapolis, Indiana, broadcasting on 107.9 FM. WNTR airs an adult contemporary format under the ownership of Cumulus Media. Its studios are located on North Meridian Street, and its transmitter tower is on the northwest side. ==History== ===Prior use of 107.9 FM in Indianapolis=== Indiana Broadcasting Company was granted a construction permit to build a new radio station on 107.9 FM in Indianapolis on July 21, 1960. The station went on air October 22, 1961, as WISH-FM, a sister station to WISH (1310 AM) and WISH-TV (channel 8). In November 1963, owner Corinthian Broadcasting opted to focus on its television stations and sold the WISH radio stations to the Star Stations group, headed by Don Burden. Under Burden, WISH-AM-FM became WIFE-AM-FM. Lucky 13 WIFE was a Top 40 dynasty into the 1970s, while the FM operation was an automated beautiful music station. However, Burden ran afoul of the Federal Communications Commission for a number of serious violations, some of them concerning the Indianapolis operation, and the FCC ruled to deny license renewals to all Star Stations in 1975. After the exhaustion of all appeals, the transfer of the AM station to a competing applicant, and a short-lived flip to country as \\"CB-108\\" in the final months, WIFE-FM left the air on September 2, 1976. ===WTPI=== Even before WIFE-FM had signed off, applicants formed to make bids on the vacant 107.9 MHz frequency. After receiving nine applications by the November 1976 cut-off date, In 1978, the FCC designated five bids for comparative hearing, from Peoples Broadcasting Corporation; Radio Circle City, headed by former WIFE-AM-FM general manager Robert Kiley; Mediacom; Radio Corporation of Indiana, consisting of several local investors; and Indianapolis Communications Corporation. The FCC did not rule in favor of any of the applications until May 1982, when it selected Peoples. However, the winning applicant had developed a flaw in the intervening years, as Peoples head Joseph Cantor died in September 1981. FCC rules which froze the qualifications of competing applicants at a certain point in time meant that the two ruling administrative law judges had to consider Peoples as if Cantor was still alive. The losing bidders appealed, but the FCC review board and the full commission upheld the decision. On October 15, 1984, Peoples Broadcasting went on the air, using the call letters WTPI. The station was called \\"the Top for Indianapolis,\\" relating to its location at the top of the Indianapolis FM dial. The first program director at WTPI was Mark Edwards, and the station's new studios overlooked Monument Circle in downtown Indianapolis. Longtime morning personality Steve Cooper (a.k.a. Jim Carr) was with the station for its entire lifetime. Cooper also did stints at WNDE (1260) and WIFE (1310). Overnights were handled by Mike O'Brien (a.k.a. Dave Heck, now an engineer at Emmis Radio) for nearly 20 years. The station was known for \\"Night Breeze\\", a nightly light AC and Jazz show in the 1990s. Over the years, WTPI was the radio home of Jennifer Carr, Paul Poteet, Oleta Martin, Pat Moore, Jerry Curtis, Gia Berns, and Kelli Jack, to name a few. WTPI was sold twice in the 1980s. In 1986, original owner Peoples sold the station for $8.5 million to the Somerset Group, a local firm. Three years later, the Pinnacle Group‚Äîrenamed MyStar Communications in 1990‚Äîacquired WTPI for $12 million. The radio station eventually moved from Monument Circle to the 3100 block of North Meridian Street, and finally to its current site at 9245 North Meridian. Long- time WTPI program director was Gary Havens. ===Recent history=== On October 3, 2005, Entercom dropped the adult contemporary music format in favor of adult hits, and changed the call letters to WNTR. The station's on-air identifier was \\"107.9 The Track.\\" Programming featured a somewhat \\"Jack-like\\" format proclaiming \\"We Play Everything.\\" A popular live syndicated show featuring Tom Kent occupied the evening shift on WNTR. They also broadcast American Top 40 The 1980s with Casey Kasem on Saturday at 6:00 am and also on Sunday at 8:00 am. On November 13, 2009, WNTR began stunting with Christmas music with a format flip coming after Christmas Day. On December 28, 2009, at 12:28 p.m., WNTR was rebranded as \\"My 107.9\\", retaining the adult hits format. On May 22, 2013 at 5PM, after playing Kesha's \\"Blow\\", and a goodbye message, followed by Simple Minds' \\"Don't You (Forget About Me)\\", WNTR began stunting with micro- formats (Rock as Rock 107.9, all Garth Brooks as Garth 107.9, Christmas music as Yule 107.9, all boy bands as Heartthrob 107.9, all Midwestern-born artists as 107.9 Heartland Radio, and sounds of nature as Earth 107.9). The following day at 5 PM, an AC format was introduced under the name \\"107.9 The Mix\\", with Dave Smiley from sister station WZPL launching the station with Fall Out Boy's \\"My Songs Know What You Did in the Dark (Light Em Up)\\". On February 13, 2019, Cumulus Media and Entercom announced an agreement in which WNTR, WXNT, and WZPL would be swapped to Cumulus in exchange for WNSH in New York City and WHLL and WMAS-FM in Springfield, Massachusetts. Under the terms of the deal, Cumulus began operating WNTR under a local marketing agreement on March 1, 2019. The swap was completed on May 13, 2019. On April 10, 2020 WNTR dropped its hot AC format and began stunting with Christmas music again. The stunting was framed as a form of escapism in response to the global uncertainly brought on by the COVID-19 Pandemic. On May 14, 2020 WNTR ended its Christmas music stunt and launched an adult contemporary format, still branded as Mix 107.9.WNTR Ends Over A Month Of Christmas Music With AC Shift Radioinsight - May 14, 2020 ===HD Radio=== WNTR is licensed to broadcast in the HD Radio format.https://hdradio.com/station_guides/widget.php?latitude=39.8646455&longitude;=-86.1039189 HD Radio Guide for Indianapolis ==References== ==External links== * NTR Category:Radio stations established in 1984 Category:Cumulus Media radio stations Category:Mass media in Indianapolis ","title":"WNTR"},{"id":"3230934","text":"Dmitri Ivanovich Sautin (; born 15 March 1974) is a Russian diver who has won more medals than any other Olympic diver.

It is famous in the history of geology for Hutton's Unconformity found in 1788, which James Hutton regarded as conclusive proof of his uniformitarian theory of geological development. ==History== St. Helen's Chapel. Siccar Point was the site of a dun, or small hill fort, in the territory of the ancient Britons. Siccar Point is now in the parish of Cockburnspath but was formerly in the parish of Old Cambus, from which the ancient parish church of St Helen's Chapel survives as a ruin about one kilometre to the west of the point. The church is built in a Romanesque style, in a mixture of Old Red Sandstone believed to have been quarried from the nearby Greenheugh Bay and of the greywacke rock also used in the drystone dyke forming the field boundaries. It is likely that the medieval village of Old Cambus was nearer to Siccar Point than the extant hamlet of Old Cambus. To the south of the point twentieth-century quarrying for greywacke to be used as roadstone left a hollow named Old Cambus Quarry which is now occupied by a vegetable distribution warehouse complex. ==Hutton's Unconformity== The rugged point shows gently sloping beds of red sandstone above vertical beds of greywacke, forming a classic example of Hutton's Unconformity. Siccar Point is notable in the history of geology as a result of a boat trip in 1788 in which geologist James Hutton observed the angular unconformity of the point. He wrote later that the evidence of the rocks provided conclusive proof of the uniformitarian theory of geological development; that is, that the natural laws and processes which operate in the universe have never changed and apply everywhere. ==See also== *List of places in the Scottish Borders *List of places in Scotland == References == ==External links== *James Hutton's account of his visit to Siccar Point in Berwickshire *John Playfair's historic remarks upon seeing Siccar Point, in vol.

The building has been claimed as the epitome of Post-modernism. ==History== Main entrance The Neue Staatsgalerie was designed after Stirling and Wilford won a limited entry competition in 1977. It was constructed between 1979 and 1984. Located next-door to Stuttgart's Alte Staatsgalerie, the design echoed the neoclassical design of the older building.

This was a time of war between the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms of southern England and Viking invaders from Denmark. The English military preparations, conducted under the leadership of King Alfred of Wessex, included fortified burhs or places of refuge and interconnecting herepaths using either existing routes or new works. As superior or safer roads, sometimes following ridgeway routes, herepaths were intensely used by ordinary travellers and hauliers. Where these roads exist today, local legend often imputes them with magical, romantic or mystical origins in prehistoric time and the name is rather wantonly applied to any old trackway, especially in the region of Wessex. In the Old English language the word here means \\"armed host\\".Oxford English Dictionary, 1989 It is also found as a prefix in compound words such as harbour (a burh with a garrison) and heretoga (a militia leader). The term herepath has cognates in other Germanic languages in forms such as Heerweg (German) and H√¶rvejen (Danish). In all three languages, a herepath in later times simply denotes a road that was a via publica, maintained at central government expense.Landau, Georg: Beitr√§ge zur Geschichte der alten Heer- und Handelsstra√üen in Deutschland, Kassel, B√§renreiter, 1958 ==References== Category:Conflict in Anglo-Saxon England Category:Ancient trackways in England ","title":"Herepath"},{"id":"3230983","text":"Alan Turner (born 23 July 1950, Camperdown, New South Wales) is a former Australian cricketer. He was a left-handed batsman who played for New South Wales from 1968 until retirement in 1978. He scored over 5,700 runs as a stocky opener with a practised cut shot, though he was not able to prove his abilities at best at international level. He played in fourteen Test matches and six One Day Internationals from 1975 to 1977. On the back of his several good Sheffield Shield seasons he was selected for Australian tours of England and New Zealand. He scored a single Test century against the touring West Indian side in 1975‚Äì76. By a noted cricket writer Peter Hanlon, Turner was described as \\"an ordinary man in the company of Gods.\\" His nickname was \\"Fitter-an'\\", as in \\"fitter and turner\\". ==Career== After leaving school, Turner went to work for British American Tobacco. He would stay there for 43 years, working in management in finance and accounting, sales, marketing, and supply chain. ===Early First Class Cricket=== Turner made his first class debut in 1968-69. He was a solid performer for New South Wales, scoring eight fifties in 1969-70. He made his debut first class century in 1971-72. ===1975 Tour of England and Canada=== Turner was selected on the 1975 tour of Canada and England after a 1974-75 season where he scored 578 runs at 32.11 with a top score of 88. Captain Ian Chappell admitted \\"some might consider\\" Turner's selection \\"a surprise, but he is a hard, tough, experienced player with a strong season behind him. Turner has opened the innings for NSW and has batted in a variety of positions. For this reason he must have been given the nod over Ashley Woodcock, who was most unfortunate to have broken down in the last Shield game\\". ====1975 World Cup==== He made his first appearance for Australia in the 1975 Cricket World Cup. He scored 46 against Pakistan. then in a match against Sri Lanka, became the first Australian to score a century in a One Day International. He scored 101 runs from 113 balls, all in the morning session prior to his dismissal, in a partnership of 178 with fellow opening bat Rick McCosker. His blistering innings included 9 fours and a six. He followed this with 7 against the West Indies, 7 in the semi final against England and 40 in the final against the West Indies. ====1975 Ashes==== Turner made his test debut against England in 1975. \\"No one said much to me before my first Test,\\" he recalled. \\"You were an Australian, you'd got there because you could play, and you were expected to man up.\\" He scored 37, taking part in an opening stand of 80 with Rick McCosker, helping Australia win by an innings. Australia had struggled to find a consistent opening combination under Ian Chappell and so Turner's debut was considered promising. However Turner performed less well in the next match, making 9 and 21. 105 runs in eight first class innings saw him dropped for the third test in favour of Gary Gilmour. A score of 118 against Essex saw him back for the 4th test, making 2 and 8. \\"I underestimated the toughness of an Ashes battle,\\" said Turner. \\"It was a lot more intense than I imagined, and I failed to distinguish myself with the bat.\\" ===1975-76 vs West Indies=== Turner began the 1975-76 summer well, making 106 and 66 for NSW against the West Indies. He was picked in the Australian side for the first test and made 81 and 26. Turner then scored 23 and 0, 21 and 7 and 53 and 15. In the fifth test Turner made 26 and 136, his debut century. \\"I wasn't nervous after I reach ed 80 and just put my head down to make sure of the century,\\" he said. \\"It was a bit of a relief to get the ... 100 because I could then get back to scoring more runs\\". In the 6th test Turner made 30 and 21. \\"That Australian team was very committed to each other and to the cause,\\" he recalled. \\"There were no divisions.\\" He made 46 in a one-day game against the West Indies. ===1976-77=== Turner was selected against Pakistan. He scored 33 and 48 in the first game, a game memorable for Turner's collision with Jeff Thomson, which put the latter out of action that summer. Turner made 82 and 5 for the second test and 0 and 11 for the third. Turner was picked on the New Zealand tour. He was going to delay his departure to be with his wife when their son was born. However Turner changed his mind. He later said \\"There's always the danger that if I arrive late, somebody will get 100 and take my test position.\\"\\"Fitness - Chappell's key to keeness\\", Cricketer, March 1977 p 19 Against New Zealand he made 3 and 20 and 30 and 20. Turner was dropped from the Australian team at the end of the 1976-77 summer, missing selection for the Centenary Test. \\"We had three openers: myself, Rick McCosker and Ian Davis, and the selectors wanted to find room for David Hookes in the middle order,\\" he said. \\"While we were in New Zealand, Hookes had scored five consecutive Sheffield Shield centuries. That demanded his selection for the Centenary Test.\\" On the first day of the Centenary Test, Rick McCosker's jaw was broken and the Australian batting collapsed. It was unsure if the test would last five days and the Queen was meant to attend on day five. If the match finished early they planned to play a one-day game; Turner was asked to bring his gear to Melbourne as McCosker's replacement. However the game ended up going for five days. Turner also missed selection on the 1977 Ashes. ===World Series Cricket=== Turner was offered the chance to join World Series Cricket. He turned it down after he found the matches would be played in opposition to the Australian Cricket Board matches that were being sponsored by his employer, British American Tobacco. \\"I felt I couldn't turn my back on a company that had supported me in cricket for nearly ten years, and by then I wasn't really enjoying playing cricket for a living,\\" said Turner. As an experienced test batsman, Turner was considered a strong chance to play for the \\"establishment\\" Australian team that summer against India. However he suffered a poor run of form. Turner decided to retire at the end of the summer, aged only 27. \\"I was trying my guts out this season\\", he said at the time. \\"I really was, but things just didn't go my way... I have not gained ground in any direction in the past 12 months. I have been static in my cricket. So I decided to get out now to give some other younger bloke a go in an atmosphere without pressure. I don't want people saying I'm like a rat deserting a sinking ship. Believe me, the ship has sunk\\". ==Post cricket career== Turner continued playing grade cricket for Randwick and was president of the club from 1977 to 1988.

They are established in major prefectural police departments supervised by the National Police Agency. The SAT is national-level counter-terrorism asset cooperating with territorial-level Anti-Firearms Squads and Counter-NBC Terrorism Squads. Most information on the unit has been confidential, its existence officially revealed only in 1996. SAT is officially known in Japanese as simply and individual teams officially take the name of the Metropolitan or Prefectural police departments to which they are assigned; an example would be for the SAT unit assigned to the Tokyo Metropolitan Area. ==Background== By the mid-1970s, Japanese police already established the , launched as a response to the Kin Kiro Incident in 1968. They were sniper teams basically, and entry teams were also built in the Metropolitan Police Department; these squads were predecessors of the Anti-firearms squads, but they were only part-time SWAT teams at this time. In response to the Dhaka Incident, the National Police Agency decided to set up full-time anti-terrorism special units at the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department and the Osaka Prefectural Police Department in secret. The Tokyo unit was established as the of its 6th Riot Police Unit and the Osaka unit as the \\"Zero\\" Company of its 2nd Riot Police Unit. The Tokyo unit was nicknamed SAP (Special Armed Police), and it was recognized as the official name around 1982 and the flag was awarded. In 1996, it was officially announced that the tactical units had been organized, and their unit name were changed to SAT, Special Assault Teams. In addition to the MPD and Osaka, teams in Hokkaido, Kanagawa, Chiba, Aichi, Fukuoka Prefectural Police were also established. In 2005, a team of the Okinawa Prefectural Police was established, and existing units were also reinforced. ==Organization== SAT operators rush from a heavy-armored SWAT vehicle. === Structure === SAT teams are set up at eight Prefectural Police Departments. In most prefectures they belong to the Riot Police Unit, but in the MPD it is directly under its First Security Division, and the Security Division in the Osaka. Total strength is about 300 officers. It is said that three teams in the Metropolitan Police Department, two teams in the Osaka Prefectural Police Department, and one team in each of the other Prefectural Police are set up. Each team consists of a command section, a entry section, a sniper support section, and a technical support section. === Recruitment and training === Members are recruited from Riot Police Units. When the unit was founded, the members were selected from rangers, rescue specialists, snipers and martial artists. It is said that they will be subject to inspection and inspection for officers under 30 years old. In order to maintain physical strength, the period of service is assumed to be approximately 5 years. Graduates are usually transferred to other departments in the Security Bureau, but some are transferred to the Special Investigation Team (SIT) of the criminal investigation department to introduce their high SWAT capability to the detectives. Although SAT training is enigmatic, a retired SAP member recalled that Airborne Ranger Courses of the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force, counter-insurgency, and air assault training had been conducted. Nowadays, SAT has training facilities in six locations nationwide, and training at Yumenoshima is sometimes released to reporters. There were also exchanges with overseas police forces, at least with joint training with the German GSG 9. 10 SAT officers were placed under training by Queensland Police's Specialist Service Branch in Queensland, Australia. ===Equipment=== In addition to standard service handguns, the SAP units used Heckler & Koch P9S pistols as their main sidearms. After being reorganized into SAT, usage of Heckler & Koch USP and Smith & Wesson Model 3913 have been confirmed, there is information that Glock 19, SIG Sauer P226 and Beretta 92 Vertec are adopted. As their mainarms, the SAP unit used Heckler & Koch MP5A5, MP5SD6, MP5K submachine guns. There is also information that SAT units have adopted Howa Type 89 assault rifles and M4 carbines. Japanese police have adopted Howa Golden Bear, then M1500 as their sniper rifle. Also in the SAP, Howa Type 64 rifle was also used as designated marksman rifles. And in the SAT, Heckler & Koch PSG1 and L96A1 also have been deployed. SAT teams operate special and unmarked bulletproof cars. ==Operational history== The \\"Zero\\" Company of the Osaka Prefectural Police had its first known incident on January 26, 1979 when they were deployed during a Mitsubishi Bank hostage incident in Osaka. In the incident, they shot dead Akiyoshi Umekawa after he gunned down two employees and two policemen. As the SWAT ability of other departments improved, the SAT became \\"last ditch\\" of the Security Bureau of the National Police Agency, and opportunities to conduct domestic direct action decreased. In the Gulf Crisis of 1990, the SAP unit was dispatched to Saudi Arabia for non-combatant evacuation operation. During the Japanese embassy hostage crisis in Peru, the SAT had simulated raids on retaking buildings similar to the Japanese Embassy as a possible counter-measure to a similar incident on Japanese soil. On June 21, 1995, All Nippon Airways Flight 857 was hijacked at the Hakodate Airport in Hokkaido by a lone hijacker named . This incident marked the first time that the Japanese Air Self-Defense Forces cooperated with the SAP by providing Kawasaki C-1 aircraft as means of transportation from Haneda Airport.https://flyteam.jp/news/article/65182 SAP officers assisted Hokkaido Prefectural Police officers entering the plane. In May 2000, the Osaka and Fukuoka SAT assisted the detectives of the Hiroshima Prefectural Police storm a hijacked bus in Fukuoka in the Neomugicha incident, capturing the lone hijacker alive. In September 2003, the Aichi SAT unit was deployed to resolve a hostage incident. However, the hostage-taker committed suicide in an explosion which killed three and injured 41 others. On September 10, 2005, Okinawa was established for a SAT unit to be operational.https://web.archive.org/web/20121001051450/http://www.stripes.com/news/okinawa- police-form-assault-team-for-response-to-terrorism-1.38051 According to the NPA, the presence of American troops and the region's geography were taken to consideration to create a unit to be stationed there, especially after Al- Qaeda had made terrorist threats against Japan in the past. In May 2007, in another hostage case in Nagoya, an ex-yakuza gangster named was captured after he killed , an Aichi SAT operative. In this operation, the Aichi SIT was in charge of direct action and the SAT was backing up, but the stray bullets hit the SAT operative. Posthumously promoted to Captain, he is the first SAT officer killed in action.Aichi standoff ends after shooter gives himself up, May 18, 2007 by Kyodo News. His death has forced National Public Safety Commission Chairman Kensei Mizote to issue a press report, stating that SAT gear will be checked to see if it was responsible for Hayashi's unfortunate death. The SAT Support Staff (or the SSS) unit was created on May 2007 in the wake of the hostage taking in Aichi Prefecture. In 2015, Japanese media suggested that the SAT can potentially be dispatched to work alongside officers from the Terrorism Response Team-Tactical Wing for Overseas.https://www.sankei.com/premium/news/150209/prm1502090004-n3.html The SAT was deployed in May 2016 at the 42nd G7 summit, providing security alongside the Special Boarding Unit.http://biz- journal.jp/2016/06/post_15327_2.html == References == === Books === * * * === Articles === * ==External links== * Special Operations link * SpecWarNet link Category:Law enforcement in Japan Category:Special forces of Japan Category:Non-military counter-terrorist organizations ","title":"Special Assault Team"},{"id":"3231026","text":"The Bedlam Series is the name given to the Oklahoma‚ÄìOklahoma State rivalry. It refers to the athletics rivalry between Oklahoma State University Cowboys and Cowgirls and the University of Oklahoma Sooners of the Big 12 Conference. Both schools were also members of the Big Eight Conference before the formation of the Big 12 Conference in 1996, and both were divisional rivals in the Big 12 South Division prior to 2011. The Bedlam Series is, like most other intrastate rivalries, a rivalry that goes beyond one or two sports. Both schools also have rivalries with other schools, though most of those rivalries are limited to one or two sports at the most. The rivalry is all the more intense since their games often decide the conference championship. While the football and basketball games stand today as the marquee events in the Bedlam Series, the term \\"Bedlam\\" actually began with the rivalry between the schools' prestigious wrestling programs, more particularly the raucous crowds that attended the matches held at Oklahoma State's Gallagher-Iba Arena. ==Football== The original Bedlam Series logo. The first Bedlam football game was held at Island Park, now known as Mineral Wells Park, in Guthrie, Oklahoma. It was a cold, and very windy day with the temperatures well below the freezing mark. At one moment in the game when the Oklahoma A&M; Aggies were punting, the wind carried the ball backwards behind the kicker. If the Oklahoma A&M; squad recovered the ball it would be a touchback and if the University of Oklahoma squad recovered it, it would be a touchdown. The ball rolled down a hill into the half-frozen creek. Since a touchdown was at stake, members of both teams dove into the icy waters to recover the ball. A member of the OU team came out with the ball and downed it for a touchdown. OU won the game, 75‚Äì0. In 2007, author Steve Budin, whose father was a New York bookie, publicized the claim that the 1954 Bedlam Game was fixed by mobsters in his book Bets, Drugs, and Rock & Roll (). Allegedly, the mobsters threatened and paid off a cook to slip laxatives into a soup eaten by many OU Sooner starting players, causing them to fall violently ill in the days leading up to the game. OU was victorious in the end, but their 14‚Äì0 win did not cover the 20-point spread they had in their favor. However, many people involved in the 1954 contest do not recall any incident like the one purported by Budin to have occurred. Nor do any of the pregame and postgame newspaper articles mention any such condition. One possible reason for the Sooners' lackluster performance, according to one coach, was that the players were \\"beat up\\" from the previous game against Nebraska. Since it started in 1904, Bedlam is now the 4th-longest continuously-played rivalry in FBS (Division 1) college football. Because it is uninterrupted since 1910, it is also now the single longest uninterrupted rivalry, between two public universities, in the same state, that have a game named \\"University of _ vs. _ State University.\\" ===Game results=== ==Men's basketball== Oklahoma owns the all-time series record in men's basketball, 140‚Äì100, and have won 22 of the last 34 meetings. The Sooners swept the Cowboys in 2018-2019, giving Oklahoma its seventh Bedlam sweep since 2006, including 2013‚Äì14, 2014‚Äì15 and 2015‚Äì16 regular season Bedlam series. Oklahoma State has swept just once in that span, in 2017. ==Wrestling== Oklahoma State holds a lopsided advantage in the schools' wrestling rivalry, the original \\"Bedlam Series.\\" The Cowboy wrestling program currently holds a 141‚Äì27‚Äì10 record against the Sooners, which is all the more remarkable considering that both schools have long been national powers in wrestling. Oklahoma has won seven team national championships in its history, while Oklahoma State's wrestling program has a record thirty-four team national titles. ==See also== * List of NCAA college football rivalry games * List of most-played college football series in NCAA Division I ==References== ==External links== * Bedlam Series at OKState.com * Bedlam Series at SoonerSports.com *Voices of Oklahoma interview with Bob Barry Sr. First person interview conducted on March 31, 2011, with Bob Barry Sr. Original audio and transcript archived with Voices of Oklahoma oral history project.

An additional armed transport unit was established in 1973. In 1985, the 1st Airborne Brigade was involved in rescue operations of the downed Japan Airlines Flight 123 in the ridges of Mount Takamagahara in Gunma Prefecture after the local volunteer fire corps found some survivors, marking the first time that the Brigade was seen in the public eye. Later on, they were also deployed in Yamanashi Prefecture for civil operations and after the Great Hanshin-Awaji earthquake in 1995. A Guide Unit was established on October 20, 1999, and based at Funabashi, Chiba. Preparations to create a new special forces unit went underway in the Brigade in 2000. In 2003, the framework of the Special Operations Group was established as an anti-guerrilla/terrorist unit embedded in the Brigade, but was established and separated from the Brigade in 2004 and placed under the control of the Defense Agency via the JGSDF like most of the JSDF's special forces units. Brigade paratroopers were involved in Iraq as the Brigade rotated ground personnel as part of the Japanese government's commitment to Iraq. They were withdrawn alongside the bulk of the Japanese Iraqi Reconstruction Support Group in the middle of 2006. The brigade was added to the Central Readiness Force on March 28, 2007. On October 9, 2006, members of the Oregon National Guard had a hand in assisting soldiers of the 1st Airborne Brigade in establishing a sniper school to train the unit's first generation of highly skilled snipers during Orient Shield '07. ===Controversy=== ====Firearms Handling==== In 1994, Colonel Yasunobu Hideshima was arrested by JGSDF military police officers for violating both the Self-Defense Forces Law and the Firearm and Sword Control Law when he allowed three of his friends to use JGSDF firearms without prior authorization. Lieutenant Colonels Yoshiharu Amano and Michihiko Suzuki were suspended for 20 days for neglect of duty. ====Iraq War==== Another scandal emerged from within the unit when a 38-year-old 1st Airborne Brigade paratrooper was arrested in Inzai, Chiba Prefecture for shoplifting. He admitted to officers that he did it to demonstrate that he was serious in his effort to avoid deployment to Iraq. When JGSDF officials heard about this, they told press officials that they require the consent of the troopers and their relatives. Otherwise, they would not be deployed. The Iraq deployment had caused a national debate in Japan, and a new public consensus was necessary for the military to develop a modern role and structure. ==Requirements== Komatsu LAV (Light Armored Vehicle) on display with 1st Airborne Brigade markings.

The lady of the title is a female corpse which is stolen from a Chicago morgue before the dead woman's identity can be established. The book is to a large extent a send-up of the hardboiled school of crime writing. Crane is depicted as an ambivalent figure. Although he is tough and eventually solves the case through reasoning and cunning strategy, he is also a heavy drinker and ever so often prefers taking a nap to investigating the crime for which he has been hired. On the other hand, he is not afraid to deal with gangsters when he believes this might help him clear up the mystery. Historians Robert A. Baker and Michael T. Nietzel describe The Lady in the Morgue as Latimer's \\"masterpiece\\" and \\"as funny and bizarre as a Marx Brothers comedy.\\" Baker, Robert A. and Michael T. Nietzel. Private Eyes: One Hundred and One Knights : a Survey of American Detective Fiction 1922-1984. Bowling Green State University Popular Press, 1985. p 101. Accessed 13 February 2018. ==Plot summary== Throughout the novel the true identity of the young, attractive woman found hanging dripping wet from a rope in her hotel room remains a mystery. Neither her clothes nor the conspicuous lack of any shoes provides the police with any clue as to what has happened, and they assume the woman has committed suicide. At the same time a young woman from a prominent New York family goes missing, but when the stolen body is retrieved by Crane her relatives assert that these are not her human remains. Only in the final pages is it found out that a case of switched identities is at the bottom of the riddle. The Lady in the Morgue is remembered for its frank treatment of drug addiction among artists, for its frequent references to contemporary jazz and swing music, and for its bizarre setting (morgues, cemeteries). ==Publication history== The British publishing house Methuen & Co. Ltd. republished The Lady in the Morgue in hardcover in 1957. ==Film adaptation== The Lady in the Morgue was adapted for the big screen in 1938 (aka The Case of the Missing Blonde in the UK). The screenplay was written by Eric Taylor and Robertson White; the film, which starred Preston Foster as Bill Crane, was directed by Otis Garrett. It has often been cited as a particularly well-made B-movie. ==References== ==Read on== *Peter Cheyney's Can Ladies Kill?

He is the protagonist of the series of books about a former FBI agent and psychologist who works in Washington, D.C. == Character == Alex Cross is an African American detective and psychologist based out of the Southeast quadrant of Washington, D.C. He started in the homicide division of the Washington, D.C. Metropolitan Police Department (MPDC), but eventually becomes a Senior Agent with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Cross returns to private psychology practice, but continues to work with the police as needed, ultimately rejoining the MPDC as a special consultant to the Major Case Squad. Cross is a highly intelligent, rational man who holds his emotions in check. He is a model father and quite empathetic in dealing with the public. He is very involved in the community, exemplified by his volunteerism at St. Anthony's Parish. Despite the fact that he makes a decent living, he chooses to live in the Southeast quadrant of Washington, D.C., an area notorious for poverty and violent crime. == Biography == Cross had been told by relatives that at age eight his mother died of lung cancer and a year later his father died of alcoholism, so he was sent to Washington, D.C. to live with his grandmother, whom he calls Nana Mama. Later, he finds out the truth about his parents deaths, as detailed below at \\"Parents.\\" He eventually received a doctorate in psychology from Johns Hopkins University and then worked as a migrant farm worker for a year. Afterwards, he started a private practice and worked as a psychologist for two years, but eventually decided to become a policeman after he had become disillusioned with the politics of the medical community (Violets Are Blue). Cross joined the police force because the people in his neighborhood could not afford his services. His first case involved two men who were shot and whose killings were written off as drug-related. Since he knew both men, he began to investigate and found one of the men was dating a woman who was also dating the local drug dealer. He was still living with Nana Mama and his children, Damon, Janelle (Jannie), by his late wife Maria Simpson-Cross and Alex Jr. (Ali) from his fianc√©e, Christine Johnson. Cross teaches his two elder children boxing in his home's basement (Pop Goes the Weasel). Cross carries a Glock 9 mm pistol. He drives a 1974 Porsche and bought a Mercedes-Benz R350 to replace Maria's old Toyota. He plays the piano to relax and owns an Abyssinian cat named Rosie, who showed up one day and never left. Cross volunteers at St. Anthony's soup kitchen frequently, where he is known as the \\"Peanut Butter Man\\". He began doing this with Maria. His partner in the PD, John Sampson, also volunteers there. Sampson calls Cross \\"Sugar\\" as a term of endearment while Cross calls Sampson \\"Man-Mountain\\" or \\"Two-John\\". They have been best friends since the age of 10 (Pop Goes the Weasel). === Love interests === Alex has bad luck with women. His wife Maria was murdered before the series began. His lover in Along Came a Spider, Jezzie Flanigan, is involved in the kidnapping of two children, for which she is executed by lethal injection. In Kiss The Girls, Cross develops a deep friendship with Dr. Kateyla \\"Kate\\" McTiernan. There were hints of a possible romantic relationship, but they preferred to remain friends. In Jack & Jill, Alex meets Christine Johnson for the first time and falls in love with her by Cat & Mouse, in which they start dating. In Pop Goes the Weasel, Christine accepts his proposal. Christine is then kidnapped for almost a year by Geoffrey Shafer, during which time she is pregnant with Alex's son \\"Ali\\". After finding her at the end of the book, Alex meets his new son for the first time. By Roses Are Red, Christine has changed. She breaks off the engagement and moves to Seattle, leaving Ali with Alex. Detective Patsy Hampton then shows interest in Alex, but she is killed by Geoffrey before anything serious could happen. An FBI agent with whom he had partnered in Roses Are Red, Betsey Cavalierre, showed possible romantic interest in Alex and the two began a relationship. She was murdered by a serial killer called \\"The Mastermind\\". It was later revealed, by the Mastermind himself, in Violets Are Blue, that Betsey really liked Alex, even more than just a friend. Later he met a San Francisco Police Department inspector, Jamilla Hughes, with whom he struck up a relationship in Violets Are Blue. They remained together for a few books, but due to living far apart and Alex's commitment to his job, they parted company in Mary Mary. After breaking with Jamilla, Alex meets Jeanne Galleta, who shows some interest, but the two never officially start a relationship, going out only once. He next begins a relationship with Dr. Kayla Coles, a resident physician at a hospital in Southeast Washington, D.C. The two meet in Four Blind Mice and start dating in Mary Mary. Both Alex and Kayla became close in Cross. They were both born in North Carolina and raised in Washington, D.C. Kayla has since returned to North Carolina. In Cross Country, it is revealed that Alex dated a woman named Eleanor Cox in college. She was Alex's first love, before Maria and they fell in love during his summer internship at Sibley Memorial. Eleanor is killed by The Tiger, which causes Alex great pain. Also in Cross Country, Alex meets a reporter from The Guardian newspaper, Adanne Tansi, in Nigeria. They share a kiss and show romantic interest in each other, but prefer to remain friends. Adanne, too, is killed by the Tiger. His next romantic involvement is with a rising star in the PD, Detective Brianna \\"Bree\\" Stone, who is introduced in Double Cross. Deeply in love with Bree, Alex proposes to her in I, Alex Cross, and she happily accepts. They marry in Cross Fire, finally ending Alex's bad luck. Maria was originally thought to have been killed by an antagonist named Michael \\"The Butcher\\" Sullivan. However, in Cross, Cross learns that his best friend, John Sampson, and another detective, Rakeem Powell, had killed Maria's real murderer, Jimmy Hats Galati. Sampson couldn't bring himself to tell Cross because he knew that Cross would be unable to deal with the fact that he had not done it himself. Alex finally comes to terms with Maria's death at the end of Cross and is able to move on, hoping that he may find love again in the future. == Relationships with other characters == === Close family === ==== Parents ==== His mother died from lung cancer when he was nine and his father died of alcohol abuse a year later ‚Äî or so Alex thought. \\"Cross Justice\\" reveals that his mother was smothered by her drug dealer and his father, Jason Cross, was blamed for her death. Shot and believed dead after falling off a bridge, Jason survived, was nursed back to health and moved to Florida. After a young marine named Paul Drummond shot himself in the face, Jason assumed the marine's identity and fulfilled the young man's duties in the Marines. Alex Cross and his father cross paths in \\"Cross Justice\\" and Paul Drummond eventually reveals his true identity. Not even Nana Mama knew the truth ‚Äî her sisters hid it from her and Alex. ==== Nana Mama ==== Alex was raised by his grandmother, Regina \\"Nana Mama\\" Cross. The two have a strong relationship with each other. Regina raised Alex by using tough love to build his character. She allowed Alex and best friend Sampson to be held in a jail cell after they robbed a store, to teach them a lesson. She expressed her love for him from time to time, extending into his adult years. She comforted Alex when his wife died, having him move back in with her and helping him raise his children. She worries for Alex as he pushes on his cases. She tells Alex that she doesn't want to see his children become orphans. She also worries about Alex's lonely life, wanting him to be happy with someone special like he did with Maria. She would reach her limit with him when his job crossed certain boundaries. She left him and his family in Cross, when Alex is almost killed while on a case, only to change her mind when she realized how wrong it was of her. She cried in Merry Christmas, Alex Cross when Alex was called away on Christmas Eve, worrying that he might not return. Despite occasional arguments, they consistently show support for each other. ==== Children ==== Alex has three children, two by Maria, and the other by Christine. Janelle and Damon were part of the story from Along Came a Spider to Pop Goes the Weasel, when \\"Ali\\" appears. Both Damon and Janelle were too little to remember Maria. Alex makes time with them whenever he can. He takes them to the movies or for ice cream. He also trains them to box. Damon attends boarding school in Cross Country. A homeless girl named Ava is adopted by the family in Kill Alex Cross, but she is thought to be killed in Alex Cross, Run. Come to find out that the burnt body of supposedly Ava is Elise, a friend of Ava in \\"Cross My Heart\\". Alex and Bree spend time in the whole book looking for Ava. Ava does not want to be found because she is fearing for her death because she owes someone money. At the end of the book Ava ends up helping Alex pretend to be a victim with the death of his whole family. === Other family === ==== Blake Cross ==== Alex's brother is Blake Cross. It is revealed in I, Alex Cross, that Blake was on drugs and had fatally overdosed. His death put a huge strain on Alex and Blake's wife, who blames him for not helping Blake. Blake rejects Alex's attempts to help. Blake's wife cuts ties with the family, although her daughter Caroline moved into his neighborhood. ==== Caroline Cross ==== Caroline is Blake's daughter. Despite their proximity, Caroline didn't see or talk to Alex, mostly because she worked as a high-end \\"escort\\". After her murder by a serial killer and rapist named Zeus in I, Alex Cross, Alex eventually discovers Caroline's killer and closes the case. When Alex solves Caroline's murder, he informs her mother, hoping to ease her pain. ==== Naomi Cross ==== Alex's other niece is Naomi. When Naomi is kidnapped by a killer named Cassanova, in Kiss the Girls, Alex leaves his jurisdiction to find her, eventually finding and rescuing her. In Pop Goes the Weasel, Naomi makes a brief appearance to comfort Alex when his fianc√©e Christine is kidnapped. ==== Aunts ==== Alex also has aunts who come to visit him and his grandmother. ==== Stefan Tate ==== Stefan Tate is another of Alex Cross's cousins. In Cross Justice, Stefan was framed for both the murder of a thirteen-year-old boy called Rashawn Turnbull and the rape of Sharon Lawrence (which turned out to be a lie). Alex was informed by his niece Naomi that Stefan had been brutally beaten by both the guards and inmates of a prison that he was serving time behind bars in. By the end of the Novel, Stefan is freed of all charges and he continues to date his fianc√©e Patty Converse. === Friends === ==== John Sampson ==== Alex is best friends and partners with Detective John Sampson. They met when Alex moved to Washington, D.C. after his parents died and became great friends. They were constant companions, even robbing stores together. They view each other as brothers. Regina would take John in when his parents got in trouble with the law. They separated for a period, but later become detective partners the Metropolitan Police Department. In Four Blind Mice, they do have a fight over a friend's death, who was wrongly convicted and sentenced to die by lethal injection. John has protected Alex throughout a lot of his life, he discovered Maria's murderer and killed him, to spare his friend from the trauma of vengeance when he has two kids. When Alex finds out in Cross, he forgives John and thanks him for everything he has done to protect him. This relieves John's guilt of keeping the secret. Alex has also helped John out as well, by killing Geoffrey Shafer, who had killed John's former love interest, Nina Childs. When John is kidnapped by the Audience Killer in Double Cross, Alex worries deeply for his friend and later rescues him. Even when Kyle Craig, the Mastermind returns for revenge against Alex, John protects his family. ==== Dr. Adele Finaly ==== Alex has a friendship with psychologist Dr. Adele Finaly, whom he see for counseling. The two have great respect for each other and care for one another as well. She consoles him when Christine leaves Alex. Adele helps Alex through Maria's death. ==== Ned Mahoney ==== While in the FBI, Alex meets agent Ned Mahoney, who becomes his best and most loyal friend in the Bureau. They worked together on the Wolf case and catch the killer, despite his suicide. In Kill Alex Cross, Ned is told to keep Alex away from the search for the two kidnapped children of the President of the United States.

While off the Dutch coast in December 1919, she struck a mine which broke her in two, but the aft part of the vessel remained afloat and was repaired. She served as a civilian cargo ship during World War II and was scrapped in 1950 in Baltimore. == Early career == Hog Island Hull No. 517 was laid down as SS Scooba on June 12, 1918 but by the time it was launched on June 14, 1919 it had been renamed SS Liberty Glo. Delivered to the U.S. Shipping Board on August 2, 1919, she was a cargo ship of and , 394 feet (120 m) long and 54 feet (16 m) beam. Liberty Glo was the 36th Hog Islander built and one of twelve built as \\"Type B\\" troop carriers. (Liberty Glo was not a Liberty Ship, which were a similar concept of vessel built during World War II.) On December 5, 1919, the Liberty Glo struck a mine 10 mi (19 km) northwest of Terschelling on the coast of the Netherlands. The explosion broke the hull in two from waterline to waterline at number two cargo hold, the deck plates and bulwarks holding the ship together so that, despite the heavy sea running, the captain was able to get it ashore with no casualties and save most of the US$2,000,000 cargo. Captain Stousland paid the following tribute to the Hog Island product: :She broke close to the rivets but they remained intact, notwithstanding the fact that the number three bulkhead is now the bows and against it the breakers hammered without mercy to my great surprise it remained intact. The Liberty Glo was built as good as any ship afloat and how she hung together after being cut in two was most remarkable. == Later career == On 28 February 1929, Liberty Glo ran aground off Terneuzen, Zeeland, the Netherlands. She was refloated on 2 March 1929. By 1939, Liberty Glo was one of four ships sailing for the American Foreign Steamship Corporation of New York. During World War II, the ship sailed in several Atlantic convoys to the Mediterranean.Convoyweb.org.uk The ship was renamed North Glow in 1947, but only sailed for three more years. In November 1950, the ship was broken up in Baltimore. ==References== *http://www.usmm.org/ww1merchant.html ==External links== *Full history of Hog Islanders Category:1919 ships Category:Design 1022 ships Category:Hog Islanders Category:Maritime incidents in 1929 Category:World War II auxiliary ships of the United States ","title":"SS Liberty Glo"},{"id":"3231088","text":"In the USA, the rescue doctrine of the law of torts holds that if a tortfeasor creates a circumstance that places the tort victim in danger, the tortfeasor is liable not only for the harm caused to the victim, but also the harm caused to any person injured in an effort to rescue that victim. This doctrine was originally promulgated by Benjamin N. Cardozo in the 1921 case, Wagner v. Int'l Ry. Co.Wagner v. Int'l Ry. Co., 232 N.Y. 176, 133 N.E. 437 (N.Y. 1921). There, writing for the Court of Appeals of New York (which is the supreme court of that state), Cardozo stated: \\"Danger invites rescue. The cry of distress is the summons to relief [...] The emergency begets the man. The wrongdoer may not have foreseen the coming of a deliverer. He is accountable as if he had.\\"Wagner, 232 N.Y. at 180. The rescue doctrine was established nineteen years later, in the landmark case of Cote v. Palmer.Cote v. Palmer, 127 Conn. 321 (1940). Essentially, the rescue doctrine means that the rescuer can recover damages from a defendant when the rescuer is injured rescuing someone. The defendant is usually negligent in causing the accident to occur. Other cases have occurred where the plaintiff is injured rescuing the defendant and is able to collect damages. In Wagner v. International Railway, riders on the defendant's trains were allowed to walk between cars while the train was moving. In one incident, a rider fell through the cars. The plaintiff, trying to help the fallen rider, was injured himself/herself. The court found the defendant liable because of negligence to allow riders to walk between cars while the train was moving. The aforementioned example is a reference to the concept that Danger invites Rescue. Whoever caused the accident will be liable for any subsequent accident which develops as a result of the original accident. Essentially, in its pure form the Rescue Doctrine boils down to 4 main elements - all of which must be met in order to bring it to bear for the person asserting its privilege. # There must be peril or the appearance of peril to a third party, caused by the defendant. # That peril or appearance of peril must be imminent # A reasonable person would recognize the peril or appearance of peril and the plaintiff must also have actually recognized it. # The plaintiff must have exercised reasonable care in effecting the rescue. ==See also== *Fireman's rule == References == Category:Tort law Category:Legal doctrines and principles ","title":"Rescue doctrine"},{"id":"3231093","text":"In Greek mythology, Melaena or Melena (, feminine \\"black, dark\\")Mike Campbell, Behind the Name or Melane () was a Corycian nymph, or member of the prophetic Thriae, of the springs of Delphi in Phocis, who was loved by Apollo and bore him Delphos.

With only one major tributary, the Nazko River (\\"river flowing from the south\\" in the Carrier language), its confluence with the Fraser is approximately 40 km northwest of Quesnel. It forms the division between the Chilcotin Plateau (S) and the Nechako Plateau (N), which are subdivisions of the Fraser Plateau. The river is long, draining an area of approximately , and dropping over before joining with the Fraser. The river is of significant historical importance to both First Nations and Canadian history. For centuries, the Dakelh (Carrier) and Tsilhqot'in peoples used a trail‚Äîthe so-called \\"Grease Trail\\"‚Äîon the northern side of the river in their trade with coastal First Nations communities. The name Grease Trail refers to one of the main commodities transported along the route‚Äîeulachon grease, a highly prized staple, traces of which coated parts of the route after centuries of use. It was this trail that Sir Alexander Mackenzie used in his historic overland journey west to the Pacific Ocean in 1793, traversing the river itself on his return. He named the river in 1793. The West Road (Blackwater) River has been designated as a heritage river by the government of British Columbia.

The 82 mm (3.2 in) and 132 mm (5.2 in) diameters were chosen because the standard smokeless gunpowder charge used at the time was 24 mm (0.94 in) in diameter and seven of these charges fitted into an 82 mm cylinder. First test-firing was done in November 1929. In 1937, aerodynamically efficient RO-82 rail launchers were designed for mounting these weapons on aircraft. ==Operational history== RS-82 Following the pioneering use of Le Prieur rockets in the use of air-launched rocket armament in World War I, done since 1916 on the Western Front, and that had been first done for the Central Powers in WW I by Rudolf Nebel from Halberstadt D.II biplanes of the Luftstreitkr√§fte during the first half of 1916, the earliest known use by the Soviet Air Force of aircraft- launched unguided anti-aircraft rockets in combat against heavier-than-air aircraft took place in August 1939, during the Battle of Khalkhin Gol. A group of Polikarpov I-16 fighters under command of Captain N. Zvonarev were using RS-82 rockets against Japanese aircraft, shooting down 16 fighters and 3 bombers in total. Six Tupolev SB bombers also used RS-132 for ground attack during the Winter War. RS-82 officially entered service in 1937 and RS-132 in 1938. Like most unguided rockets, RS suffered from poor accuracy. Early testing demonstrated that, when fired from 500 m (1,640 ft), a mere 1.1% of 186 fired RS-82 hit a single tank and 3.7% hit a column of tanks. RS-132 accuracy was even worse, with no hits scored in 134 firings during one test. Combat accuracy was even worse, since the rockets were typically fired from even greater distances. To further complicate the matters, RS-82 required a direct hit to disable light German armor, with near-misses causing no damage. RS-132 could defeat medium German armor with a direct hit but caused almost no damage to light or medium armor with a near-miss. Best results were usually attained when firing in salvos against large ground targets. Almost every Soviet military aircraft of World War II was known to carry RS-82 and RS-132, often using field-made launchers. Some Ilyushin Il-2 were field-modified to carry up to 24 rockets although the added drag and the weight made this arrangement impractical. RS-derived M-8 and M-13 rockets were used by the famous Katyusha rocket artillery. ==Variants== * RS-82 and RS-132 - earlier high-explosive warhead (HE-Frag) * RBS-82 and RBS-132 - armor-piercing warhead (APHE) * ROFS-82 and ROFS-132 - later high-explosive warhead (HE-Frag) * M-8 - improved RS-82 with a much larger warhead (0.64 kg (1.4 lb) of explosives) and rocket motor for BM-8 Katyusha * M-13 - improved RS-132 with a much larger warhead (4.9 kg (10.8 lb) of explosives) and rocket motor for BM-13 Katyusha. ==Specifications (RS-82)== * Body diameter: 82 mm (3.2 in) * Wingspan: 200 mm (8 in) * Length: 600 mm (24 in) * Weight: 6.8 kg (15 lb) * Explosive weight: 0.36 kg (0.8 lb) * Fragmentation radius: 7 m (23 ft) * Maximum speed: 340 m/s (1,115 ft/s) * Range: 6.2 km (3.9 mi) * Spread: 16 angular mil ==Specifications (RS-132)== * Body diameter: 132 mm (5.2 in) * Wingspan: 300 mm (11 in) * Length: 845 mm (33 in) * Weight: 23.0 kg (50 lb) * Explosive weight: 0.9 kg (2 lb) * Fragmentation radius: 10 m (33 ft) * Maximum speed: 350 m/s (1,150 ft/s) * Range: 7.1 km (4.4 mi) * Spread: 16 angular mil ==See also== * High Velocity Aircraft Rocket * List of aircraft weapons * RP-3 ‚Äì British 3 inch rocket, known as \\"60lb\\" ==References== * ==External links== * http://www.airwar.ru/weapon/anur/rs82-132.html * https://web.archive.org/web/20040818195252/http://www.new- factoria.ru/missile/wobb/bm13/bm13.shtml Category:Air-to-ground rockets Category:Air-to-air rockets Category:Rocket artillery Category:World War II weapons of the Soviet Union ","title":"RS-82 (rocket family)"},{"id":"3231121","text":"The Testimony of the Evangelists, Examined by the Rules of Evidence Administered in Courts of Justice is an 1846 Christian apologetic work by Simon Greenleaf, a principal founder of the Harvard Law School. Greenleaf's Treatise on the Law of Evidence, published in three volumes between 1842 and 1853, forms the basis for his study of the Gospels. Greenleaf came to the conclusion that the witnesses were reliable, and the resurrection of Jesus occurred. Testimony of the Evangelists is sometimes cited by contemporary Christian apologists. ==Summary== Greenleaf begins his book by arguing for the need to suspend prejudices and to be open to conviction, \\"to follow the truth wherever it may lead us\\" (p. 1). He cites Bishop Daniel Wilson's Evidences by stating that Christianity does not \\"bring irresistible evidence\\" but offers sufficient evidences for \\"the serious inquirer\\" (p. 2). He limits the scope of his book to an inquiry \\"to the testimony of the Four Evangelists, bringing their narratives to the tests to which other evidence is subjected in human tribunals\\" (p. 2). His specific inquiry is concerned with testing \\"the veracity of these witnesses by the same rules and means\\" employed in human tribunals (p. 3). Greenleaf argues the case by first inquiring as to the genuineness of the four gospels as ancient writings. Here he applies what is known in law as the ancient documents rule, stating that \\"Every document, apparently ancient, coming from the proper repository or custody, and bearing on its face no evident marks of forgery, the law presumes to be genuine, and devolves on the opposing party the burden of proving it to be otherwise\\" (p. 7). Greenleaf maintains that the Four Gospels do not bear any marks of being forgeries and the oldest extant copies may be received into court as genuine documents. Greenleaf proceeds to argue that \\"In matters of public and general interest, all persons must be presumed to be conversant, on the principle that individuals are presumed to be conversant with their own affairs\\" (p. 9). On the basis of this legal rule, Greenleaf briefly profiles those traditionally attributed as authors of the Four Gospels, Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, concerning (in the case of John and Matthew) their firsthand knowledge of the life of Jesus of Nazareth and (in the case of Mark and Luke) their intimate personal links with Jesus' original band of disciples. Greenleaf then builds a cumulative case by claiming to cross-examine the oral testimony of the evangelists in their accounts of the death and resurrection of Jesus. Greenleaf develops his case on the basis of the following tests: > \\"The credit due to the testimony of witnesses depends upon, firstly, their > honesty; secondly, their ability; thirdly, their number and the consistency > of their testimony; fourthly, the conformity of their testimony with > experience; and fifthly, the coincidence of their testimony with collateral > circumstances\\" (p. 28). Greenleaf then argues that the gospel writers can be shown to be honest in their character and do not show any motives to falsify their testimony (pp. 28‚Äì31). He claims that keen observations and meticulous details are related by Matthew and Luke, and he concludes this demonstrates their ability (pp. 31‚Äì32). Greenleaf notes that there are parallel accounts from the evangelists concerning the central events of Jesus' life and that these accounts are not verbally identical. He maintains that discrepancies in their accounts are evidence that the writers are not guilty of collusion, and that the discrepancies in their respective accounts can be resolved or harmonized upon careful cross-examination and comparison of the details (pp 32‚Äì35). Greenleaf argues against the scepticism of the Scottish empirical philosopher David Hume concerning reports of miracles. He finds fault with Hume's position about \\"immutable laws from the uniform course of human experience\\" (p. 36), and goes on to assert that it is a fallacy because \\"it excludes all knowledge derived by inference or deduction from facts, confining us to what we derive from experience alone\\" (pp. 37‚Äì38). Greenleaf takes as his own assumption that as God exists then such a being is capable of performing miracles. He then argues that the various miracles reported in Jesus' ministry occurred in open or public contexts where friend and foe alike were witnesses (pp 39‚Äì42). Lastly, Greenleaf examines the problem of uniform testimony among false and genuine witnesses, and finds there is sufficient circumstantial evidence to support the accounts of the Four Evangelists. Greenleaf sums up his argument with the following plea: > \\"All that Christianity asks of men on this subject, is, that they would be > consistent with themselves; that they would treat its evidences as they > treat the evidence of other things; and that they would try and judge its > actors and witnesses, as they deal with their fellow men, when testifying to > human affairs and actions, in human tribunals. Let the witnesses be compared > with themselves, with each other, and with the surrounding facts and > circumstances; and let their testimony be sifted, as if it were given in a > court of justice, on the side of the adverse party, the witnesses being > subjected to a rigorous cross-examination. The result, it is confidently > believed, will be an undoubting conviction of their integrity, ability and > truth ... Either the men of Galilee were men of superlative wisdom, and > extensive knowledge and experience, and of deeper skill in the arts of > deception, than any and all others, before or after them, or they have truly > stated the astonishing things which they saw and heard\\" (pp. 46 & 53). ==Literary importance in Christian apologetics== In the history of Christian apologetics there have been many lawyers who have written texts commending and defending their faith. In recent years writers such as John Warwick Montgomery, Ross Clifford and Philip Johnson have described the contributions made by lawyers as a distinct school of thought and use the terms \\"juridical apologetics\\", \\"jural apologetics\\" and \\"legal apologetics\\". These writers point to the Seventeenth century Dutch legal scholar Hugo Grotius as one of the first juridical apologists. Montgomery, Clifford and Johnson argue that Greenleaf may be ranked as one of the most important representative figures of this particular school of apologetic thought. Johnson states that Greenleaf, \\"must be regarded as the pivotal figure in juridical apologetics.\\" As a Christian apologist of the mid-Nineteenth century, Greenleaf was one of many writers who contributed to the debates that ensued on both sides of the Atlantic concerning the historicity of the gospel accounts in general, and specifically the miracle of the resurrection of Jesus Christ. Part of his argument relied on earlier Christian apologists such as William Paley, Thomas Hartwell Horne, and Mark Hopkins, and he cites their works in The Testimony of the Evangelists. Here he followed the basic appeals to logic, reason, and historical evidences on behalf of the Bible generally, and in defence of the possibility of miracles occurring. However, what distinguished Greenleaf from previous apologists is that he is the first American apologist to develop an argument favoring the reliability of the gospels and specifically on the evidences for the resurrection of Jesus Christ using technical legal criteria. His technical arguments concerning the evidentiary weight of the eyewitness passages found in the gospel narratives, the criteria for cross-examining that eyewitness testimony, and the claimed status of the gospels as competent evidence, have been relied on and restated by several American Christian apologists of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, such as Clarence Bartlett (As A Lawyer Sees Jesus), Walter M. Chandler (The Trial of Jesus), Pamela Binnings Ewen (Faith on Trial), Francis J. Lamb (Miracle and Science), Irwin H. Linton (A Lawyer Examines the Bible), Josh McDowell (More Than A Carpenter, The Resurrection Factor), Howard Hyde Russell (A Lawyer's Examination of the Bible), Joseph Evans Sagebeer (The Bible in Court), and Stephen D. Williams (The Bible in Court or Truth vs Error). ==Critical assessment== There are two examples of writers in recent years who have made critical assessments of Greenleaf's work, and of legal apologists who model their arguments on his book. Howard Richard Packham is a retired foreign language instructor and former part-time estate planning attorney who holds to an atheist worldview. He has written an internet article criticising the technical arguments set forth by Greenleaf and others. Packham holds that what Greenleaf submits as eyewitness testimony is technically hearsay and therefore does not comprise direct evidence to demonstrate the resurrection of Jesus. He also holds that the criteria for the \\"ancient documents rule\\" is not met by the gospel documents and that the force of Greenleaf's argument is thereby undermined. Packham argues that the ancient documents rule technically only applies to a limited genre of legal documents, such as wills and contracts and other specific legal instruments, to which the gospels do not belong. However, there are problems in Packham's argument. The Ancient Documents Rule is not limited to express legal instruments, but covers any type of documents. The criteria for the Ancient Documents Rule is simple and straightforward. According to legal authorities, documents of any type must meet three criteria in order to qualify for the Ancient Documents Rule: 1) that the document is at least 20 years old, 2) presumed to be genuine, 3) come from proper custody (cf. Black's Law Dictionary, FRE 901(b)(8)). Greenleaf, as a writer of highest legal authority, concluded that the Gospels should be received under the ancient documents rule. In ¬ß9 of his Testimony of the Evangelists, Greenleaf cites the legal reception by the British Record Commission of the Domesday Book and Ancient Statues of Wales, as well as many other ancient writings. Packham maintains that in a court procedure it is up to a judge to decide if a document may be admitted. However, the issue of allowing any evidence is whether the evidence has enough value for the trier of fact to reach a conclusion, whether for or against (FRE 104 (b) notes). Packham also argues that admitting a document is not tantamount to saying that its contents have automatically been authenticated by the judge's decision. However, that means the written document is allowed into evidence in the case and that evidence of its contents have to be further weighed by the trier of fact. The interesting dilemma is that both advocates and opponents must cite the Gospels in order to admit or omit their contents. Thus the probative value, and the logical and conditional relevancy of the Gospel materials is exhibited. Packham liberally cites the Gospel material and biblical higher critics in order to make his points. Ross Clifford, who is a former Australian barrister and a theologian, has often written about the subject of legal apologists. Clifford affirms the case for the resurrection of Jesus. He states that it may appear to opponents that legal apologists like Greenleaf have at different points overstated their case. In his first book Leading Lawyers' Case for the Resurrection he devoted a brief chapter on Greenleaf's life and work. In that text he raised a technical question about the ancient documents rule and suggested that hypothetically a court could admit the gospels as ancient documents, but that does not mean that their specific contents are automatically acknowledged as facts (p. 141). However, the trier of fact is allowed to weigh the evidence of the contents of the writings. Clifford clarifies the purpose of the ancient documents rule in his book John Warwick Montgomery's Legal Apologetic (pp. 51‚Äì65). Clifford says that apologists may appear to their opponents to have overstated their conclusions based on the ancient documents rule. But Clifford supports Greenleaf's and Montgomery's legal apologetic approach. Clifford states: > \\"The 'Ancient Documents' rule at common law has traditionally related more > to the authentication of the document than with the admissibility of its > contents. It does not automatically lead to admission of the substance of > the document irrespective of its credibility. (It can be argued this is even > true today for the United States, even though the Federal Rule of Evidence > 803 [16] states statements in Ancient Documents are admissible as exemptions > to hearsay). Greenleaf takes no cognisance of this position and asserts that > when an instrument is admitted under the said rule the court is bound to > receive into evidence its substance as well unless the opposing party is > able to impeach it ... The question as to whether the authentication of the > gospels under the 'Ancient Documents' rule leads to receiving their > substance into evidence is contentious. It could be strongly pleaded there > is justification for doing so. Yet, it should be noted such pleading would > be met by the adverse party's strong rejoinder\\" (pp. 60-61 & 63). As an apologist Clifford argues a case on the evidences for the resurrection and touches Packham's arguments. Greenleaf's book remains the subject of contemporary interest as proved by these two writers: from Packham as sceptic and from Clifford as Christian advocate. == References == * Clifford, Ross, Leading Lawyers' Case for the Resurrection, (Edmonton: Canadian Institute for Law, Theology and Public Policy, 1996), pp. 41‚Äì55. * Geisler, Norman L., \\"Simon Greenleaf,\\" in Baker Encyclopedia of Christian Apologetics, (Grand Rapids: Baker, 1999), pp. 298‚Äì299. * Greenleaf, Simon, The Testimony of the Evangelists Examined by The Rules of Evidence Administered in Courts of Justice, reprint of the 1874 edition, (Grand Rapids: Baker Book House, 1984). * --, \\"The Testimony of the Evangelists,\\" reprinted from the 1903 edition as an appendix in John Warwick Montgomery, The Law Above The Law, (Minneapolis: Bethany Fellowship, 1975), pp. 91‚Äì140 & 149-163. * Johnson, Philip, \\"Juridical Apologists 1600 - 2000 AD: A Bio-Bibliographical Essay,\\" Global Journal of Classical Theology, Vol. 3, no. 1 (March 2002). * Electronic photocopy of original publication \\"The Testimony of the Evangelists\\" by Simon Greenleaf available online at \\"Digital Library Production Service, University of Michigan\\" ==Bibliography of legal apologists influenced by Greenleaf== * Clarence Bartlett, As A Lawyer Sees Jesus: A Logical Analysis of the Scriptural and Historical Record, (New York: Greenwich Book Publishers, 1960). * Walter M.

For a 3 √ó 3 matrix A, its determinant is :\\\\begin{align} A = \\\\begin{vmatrix} a & b & c \\\\\\\\\\\\ d & e & f \\\\\\\\\\\\ g & h & i \\\\end{vmatrix} &= a\\\\,\\\\begin{vmatrix} \\\\Box & \\\\Box & \\\\Box \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\Box & e & f \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\Box & h & i \\\\end{vmatrix} - b\\\\,\\\\begin{vmatrix} \\\\Box & \\\\Box & \\\\Box \\\\\\\\\\\\ d & \\\\Box & f \\\\\\\\\\\\ g & \\\\Box & i \\\\end{vmatrix} + c\\\\,\\\\begin{vmatrix} \\\\Box & \\\\Box & \\\\Box \\\\\\\\\\\\ d & e & \\\\Box \\\\\\\\\\\\ g & h & \\\\Box \\\\end{vmatrix} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[3pt] &= a\\\\,\\\\begin{vmatrix} e & f \\\\\\\\\\\\ h & i \\\\end{vmatrix} - b\\\\,\\\\begin{vmatrix} d & f \\\\\\\\\\\\ g & i \\\\end{vmatrix} + c\\\\,\\\\begin{vmatrix} d & e \\\\\\\\\\\\ g & h \\\\end{vmatrix} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[3pt] &= aei + bfg + cdh - ceg - bdi - afh. \\\\end{align}title=Determinanturl=https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Determinant.html Here, bfg, cdh, bdi, and afh are broken diagonals of the matrix. In fact, broken diagonals are used in the calculation of the determinants of all matrices 3 √ó 3 or larger. This can be shown by using the matrix's minors to calculate the determinant. ==References== Category:Magic squares ","title":"Broken diagonal"},{"id":"3231124","text":"Wakefield Poole (born Wakefield Walter Poole III in Jacksonville, Florida in 1936), is an American dancer, choreographer, theatrical director, and pioneering film director in the gay pornography industry from the 1970s and 1980s.'Wakefield Poole: Theater, Dance, and Porn', The Rialto Report, audio interview with Wakefield PooleIMDB entry ==Career== Poole joined the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo in 1957 and later became a dancer, choreographer, and director on television and Broadway. From 1964 to 1968, Poole was married to Nancy Van Rijn, a Broadway performer and choreographer. In the late 1960s, Poole and his lover Peter Schneckenburger (later known as Peter Fisk, star of Boys in the Sand) began experimenting with film and multimedia shows, culminating in a multimedia gallery show for Broadway poster artist David Edward Byrd at the Triton Gallery in New York. Poole made his directorial film debut with Boys in the Sand (1971). He and Boys in the Sand producer Marvin Shulman made another film the following year entitled Bijou, starring Bill Harrison. Poole and Shulman then attempted to make a crossover film, Wakefield Poole's Bible, a trio of Old Testament stories focusing on female Biblical figures and starring Georgina Spelvin as a comic Bathsheba. The film was unsuccessful with audiences, though well received by the few critics who saw it. A number of Poole's films starred Casey Donovan, one of the best known porn stars of his time. One of them, Moving! (1974) challenged what Poole in a 1978 interview called the \\"middle-class values\\" of \\"the vast majority of gays\\" with its lengthy and graphic fisting scenes, which Poole considered important as \\"one interpretation of reality related man-to-man.\\"Jack Fritscher, \\"DIRTY POOLE (Everything You Fantasized about Porn Director Wakefield Poole, But Were Too Wrecked to Ask),\\" Drummer, February 1979, http://www.jackfritscher.com/Drummer/Issues/027/Dirty%20Poole.html#Feature%20article.

The location is a popular destination for hikers and people interested in the paranormal. ==History== The Hermitage was originally built in 1830 by the Reverend George Sheed. The property is about two miles west of Ancaster, in the Dundas Valley. Otto Ives (1804‚Äì1835) http://my.tbaytel.net/bmartin/jmiller.htm - Otto Ives (1801‚Äì1835), Ancaster Parish Records 1830‚Äì1838, Ontario Historical Society, Papers and Records Volume 5, Published in Toronto in 1904 (http://www.hwcn.org) was the third land owner. He was an English officer who had fought in the Greek War of Independence against the Ottoman Empire. He met Magdalene Diamanti, a daughter of the Governor of an Aegean island. They married in Corfu in 1824, and had arrived in Ancaster by 1833. They brought her sister or niece with them to act as a companion for Mrs Ives. It was here that Otto Ives purchased the Hermitage from the heirs of the Rev. George Sheed. Ives had hired a coachman by the name of William Black. Although it is said that Black was also a tutor in the English language, evidence exists that this post was filled by Mary Rosebeury (later Mrs Peter Filman of Hamilton). The ladies of the household spoke only Greek, and it is said that Black fell in love with the sister or niece. Black went to Otto Ives and asked for his niece's hand in marriage. Ives was very upset by the thought, and rejected the proposal. The next morning, Ives and his wife were to go out for the day, but the coachman was not at the front door with the carriage as planned. Ives went out to the barn to see why the coachman had not appeared, and discovered Black's body dangling from the rafters in the barn near the first Hermitage. Although this story has become legend in Ancaster, and although Otto Ives owned the Hermitage in the 1830s, there is little other information from the time to substantiate the legend of the coachman and the niece's love affair. There is also a note appended to deeds of sale, mentioning that a family friend had hanged himself from a tree in the bush, because of love for the niece. In 1853, the Hermitage was purchased by George Gordon Browne Leith (1812‚Äì1887) and his wife Eleanor Ferrier (1814‚Äì1900). Over the next several years, a large stone house, attendant outbuildings, a farmhouse, barns, and entrance lodge were constructed. After Mrs Leith's death, the property was purchased by her youngest daughter, Eleanor Alma Dick Lauder (1854‚Äì1942). She lived here until the house was destroyed by fire in 1934, and afterwards, in a small house constructed inside the ruins. ==References== ==Affiliations== The Museum is affiliated with: CMA, CHIN, and Virtual Museum of Canada.

The Anchankovil enriches the Pathanamthitta district of Kerala state. It joins with the Pamba River at Veeyapuram, in the Alappuzha district of Kerala. Achankovil is also the name of the forest area, which is the catchment area for this river, and of a small town situated in the Achenkovil forest area. The Achankovil village is not easily accessible; however, it can be reached through forest routes. == Townships on the banks of River Achankovil == The River Achankovil nurtures numerous townships on its fertile banks. Among them is Pathanamthitta Town, which is the capital of the Pathanamthitta district. It derives its name from its association with the river; Pathanamthitta, from the Malayalam words Pathanam and thitta, means \\"houses by the riverside\\". Mavelikkara Mavelikara is a taluk and a municipality in the Alappuzha district of the Indian state of Kerala. Located in the southern part of the district on the banks of the Achankovil River. The name Mavelikara is believed to be turned out from the words Maveli the mythical king of Kerala, and Kara means land. This land is believed to be the place where king Mahabali knelt before Vamana, offering his head for Vamana to keep his feet. The town boasts about a rich historical and cultural background. The Chettikulangara Devi Temple, known for the Kumbha Bharani festival is located near the municipality, which is home to one of the 108 Shiva temples of Kerala created by Lord Parashurama, the Kandiyoor Mahadeva Temple . It was also a major centre of trade and commerce in ancient Kerala and the erstwhile capital of the rulers of Onattukara. As a result of the close association with the Travancore Royal Family, Mavelikkara gained modern facilities well ahead of other places in the state. It is one of the oldest municipalities of the state. Even before India attained independence, Mavelikara had a super express transport service to Trivandrum.

The left hand of the idol of Ayyappa at Achankovil Shastha Temple always holds ‚ÄòChandan‚Äô (sandalwood paste) and Thirtha (holy water). The Chandan and Thirtha are considered to have medicinal properties to cure snake bites. The temple complex also contains other deities associated with the Ayyappa legend. The festivals and rituals held here have strong Tamil roots. During the Sabarimala pilgrimage, devotees also visit this temple to offer their prayers. It is believed that the idol of this temple was consecrated by Sage Parasurama. On both sides of the idol, Poorna and Pushkala, the consorts of Lord Sastha are also installed. The most important festival here is celebrated from the first to tenth day of Malayalam month Dhanu (December ‚Äì January) == Attractions == Achankovil river near Konni The river is unique in that along its route is a large number of ancient temples, indicating that the richness of the river basin has been identified by humans since ancient times and they preferred to settle down there so that they could grow their crops on the fertile lands.

Throughout his childhood, he is haunted by his father's past and cruelly harassed by other children, including the bully Jerry Sykes (Lloyd Bridges). As a young man, Danny's only friend is Gilly Johnson (Gail Russell), who is falling in love with him, despite the fact that her boyfriend is Danny's chief tormentor, Jerry Sykes. After a particularly intense confrontation in the woods, during a dance, Danny and Sykes fight and, in self-defense, Danny kills him. He fears the same fate as his father and his behavior grows erratic and temperamental, puzzling Gilly. When Jerry's body is found and Sheriff Clem Otis (Allyn Joslyn), who suspects Danny acted in self- defense and is sympathetic, starts closing in, Danny becomes crazed. He nearly strangles the harmless mute Billy Scripture (Harry Morgan), who found Danny's pocket knife near the murder scene, and he jumps from a Ferris Wheel when he notices Otis following Gilly and him as they try to enjoy a date at the fair. While hiding out in the swamps, Hawkins visits his grandma (Barrymore), who tells him the truth about his father's crime.

The gardens of Byzantium were, however, mostly destroyed after the 15th-century Turkish conquest of the city. ==Design== Byzantine gardens were based largely on Roman ideas emphasizing elaborate hellenistic mosaic designs, a typical classical feature of formally arrayed trees and built elements such as fountains and small shrines. These gradually grew to become more elaborate as time passed. Byzantine gardens have influenced Islamic gardens and particularly Moorish gardens (because Spain was before a Byzantine province, Hispania Baetica). ==Study== Little else is known about Byzantine gardens and very few references, let alone entire treatises, exist on the subject. The Byzantines, like their Greco-Roman predecessors, attached great importance to matters of aesthetics. However, ancient Greek and Roman gardens were more developed and better documented.

The tradition is popularly thought to be associated with Kabbalah and religious forms of Judaism. The red string itself is usually made from thin scarlet wool thread.

The group's members were Grandmaster Flash, Melle Mel, The Kidd Creole (not to be confused with Kid Creole), Keef Cowboy, Mr. Ness/Scorpio and Rahiem. The group's use of turntablism, breakbeat DJing, and conscious lyricism were significant in the early development of hip hop music. In the late 1970s, Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five built their reputation and achieved local success by performing at parties and live shows. By 1980, the group had signed with Sugar Hill Records. Under Sugar Hill Records, the group rose to prominence in the early 1980s with their first hit \\"Freedom\\". It was not until the release of the song \\"The Message\\" in 1982 and the album of the same name that they achieved mainstream success. The song provided a political and social commentary and went on to become a driving force behind conscious hip-hop. Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five split into two separate groups, due to differences, until a brief reunion in 1987 led to the release of the original line-up's second album On the Strength. Afterwards, they disbanded permanently. Today, the group's legacy continues as Grandmaster's Furious Five with only Melle Mel and Scorpio as remaining members. The group are widely regarded as one of the greatest groups of all time. They were inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2007; the first hip hop group to be inducted. In 2002, its first year of archival, \\"The Message\\" was one of 50 recordings chosen by the Library of Congress to be added to the National Recording Registry. Rolling Stone ranked \\"The Message\\" number 51 on its list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time in 2004. ==History== === Formation and early years (1978‚Äì1979) === Prior to the formation of the Furious Five, Grandmaster Flash worked with the \\"L Brothers\\", which consisted of \\"Mean Gene\\" Livingston, Claudio Livingston and Grand Wizzard Theodore.Hess, G. Icons of hip hop: an encyclopedia of the movement, music, and culture, Volume 1, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2007 Flash then recruited his friend Cowboy, Melle Mel and The Kidd Creole (Nathaniel Glover). The trio called themselves the Three MC's, forming the first emcee group as it relates to rap as it is known today. Cowboy performed a \\"scat routine\\" at a party (at \\"The Black Door\\") for a friend who had just joined the U.S. Army. He began scat singing the words \\"hip/hop/hip/hop\\" in a way that mimicked the rhythmic cadence of the U.S. Army marching drill. He then worked the \\"hip hop\\" cadence into part of his performance. This led to the term \\"hip hoppers\\" being used derogatorily by the culture's early detractors, most of whom were from the disco set, to label the music used. This evolved into the term \\"Hip Hop\\" and was later adopted by the industry. Melle Mel and The Kidd Creole were the first rappers to call themselves \\"MCs\\" (Masters of Ceremonies). The 3 emcees worked with Flash, who went on to bring in Mr. Ness/Scorpio (Eddie Morris) and Rahiem (Guy Todd Williams). After the formation of the Furious 5, Flash also worked with rapper Kurtis Blow doing parties in Queens. During the time Flash worked with Kurtis Blow, it was mainly due to internal disputes with the emcees, so for a short time prior to the formation of the Cold Crush Brothers in 1981, DJ Charlie Chase was the Furious 5's DJ. Grandmaster Flash & The Furious 5 were the number one rap group on the streets of New York City before rap music was embraced by the music industry, setting the standard for all other emcee groups who came after them. The first single they released was \\"We Rap More Mellow\\", which was registered under the name The Younger Generation. The name change was made by the producer, who considered it better. The group was popular locally, gaining recognition for their skilful raps and deejaying, but it was not until the Sugarhill Gang's \\"Rapper's Delight\\" proved that hip hop music could achieve mainstream success that they began recording. In 1979, they released their first single on Enjoy Records, \\"Superappin\\". The group went on to sign with Sylvia Robinson's Sugar Hill Records, following an agreement that they could perform over a then-popular DJ favorite. ===Mainstream success and The Message (1980‚Äì1982)=== In 1980, the group released their Sugarhill Records debut, \\"Freedom\\", which reached #19 on the R&B; chart and sold over 50,000 copies., Grandmaster Flash Biography, iTunes The follow-up, \\"Birthday Party\\" was also a hit. In 1981, Grandmaster Flash released The Adventures of Grandmaster Flash on the Wheels of Steel, which was a multi-deck, live recording of one of his routines that featured Queen's \\"Another One Bites the Dust\\" and Chic's \\"Good Times\\". The release marked the first time that scratching & turntablism were featured on a record. In 1982, the group released \\"The Message\\", which was produced by Clifton \\"Jiggs\\" Chase and Ed \\"Duke Bootee\\" Fletcher, the latter of whom wrote the song (Sylvia Robinson added Melle Mel's rhyme from an earlier song to complete the recording). It provided a political and social commentary and went on to become a driving force behind conscious hip-hop. The song peaked at #4 in the R&B; chart and #62 in the pop chart, and established hip-hop's credibility in mainstream music. Other than Melle Mel, however, no members of the group (except for background vocals at the end) actually feature on the record. Their debut album, also named The Message, went on to become a prominent achievement in the history of hip-hop. ===Breakup (1983‚Äì1986)=== In 1983, Grandmaster Flash, who had never appeared on any of the group's studio recordings, sued Sugar Hill Records for $5 million in unpaid royalties. This resulted in the single \\"White Lines (Don't Don't Do It)\\" being credited to \\"Grandmaster & Melle Mel.\\" The song reached #47 in Billboard's Hot R&B;/Hip- Hop Songs chart. Another lawsuit was filed over certain elements of the song being stolen from \\"Cavern\\" by Liquid Liquid, from which Sugar Hill Records would never recover. The royalties dispute split the group, and Melle Mel, Mr. Ness/Scorpio and Cowboy left after \\"White Lines (Don't Don't Do It)\\" was a hit. They then formed Grandmaster Melle Mel and the Furious Five and released the album Grandmaster Melle Mel and the Furious Five in 1984. Meanwhile, Grandmaster Flash, The Kidd Creole and Rahiem left for Elektra Records and added three new members to the group: \\"The Lord LaVon\\" (Kevin L. Dukes ‚Äì Phenomenal writer, Rapper and Bassist), Russell Wheeler (Rapper ‚Äì \\"Mr. Broadway\\") and \\"Larry-Love\\" (Larry Parker ‚Äì Dancer). They worked under the name \\"Grandmaster Flash\\" on They Said It Couldn't Be Done, The Source, and Ba- Dop-Boom-Bang. The additional members The Lord La Von, Larry Love and Mr. Broadway formed the \\"Furious Five\\" but they could not use the name as Sugar Hill Records owned the rights. Grandmaster Flash and his new \\"Furious Five\\" had hits with their three albums, which made it to the top fifty of Billboards R&B;/Hip-Hop Albums chart, whereas Melle Mel and his group fared better, most notably with the recording of \\"Beat Street Breakdown\\", which peaked at #8 in the R&B; chart. During this period, Melle Mel gained higher success, appearing in Chaka Khan's \\"I Feel for You\\", which won the Grammy Award for Best Female R&B; Vocal Performance in 1985. ===Reunion and waning popularity (1987‚Äì1988)=== In 1987, the original lineup of Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five reformed for a performance at a charity concert at Madison Square Garden. They soon reunited for their first studio album in nearly five years, recording On the Strength, which was released on April 1988. Reception of the album was lukewarm, and it failed to achieve the same levels of success as The Message. The group never enjoyed the same success as they did in the early 1980s and permanently broke up afterwards. ===Permanent disbandment and post- On the Strength (1989‚Äìpresent)=== Since disbanding, some members of the group have briefly worked together. Melle Mel, Scorpio and Cowboy released another album as Grandmaster Melle Mel and the Furious Five, Piano, in 1989. Keith \\"Cowboy\\" Wiggins died on September 8, 1989.Vibe, Dec 1994 ‚Äì Jan 1995, p.73 In 1990, Grandmaster Flash produced Just-Ice's album Masterpiece. He went on to work as musical director for The Chris Rock Show, and later released The Official Adventures of Grandmaster Flash, Essential Mix: Classic Edition, and The Bridge ‚Äì Concept Of A Culture. He has also received many accolades, including the DJ Vanguard Award from Bill Gates in 2004, RIAA's Lifetime Achievement Award at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum in 2005, and BET's I Am Hip-Hop Icon Award in 2006. His autobiography, The Adventures of Grandmaster Flash: My Life, My Beats, was released in 2008. In 1985, Melle Mel met Quincy Jones at the Grammys, and they began to collaborate for Back on the Block. This led to Mel being featured in the song \\"Back on the Block\\", which won him the Grammy Award for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group in 1991. He would pick up an additional Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album in 2002 for his contributions in Q: The Autobiography of Quincy Jones. 1997 saw him sign onto Straight Game Records and release Right Now with Mr. Ness/Scorpio. The album also featured Rondo; the two went on to form a group called Die Hard. In 2012, they released an album titled On Lock. On January 23, 2007, Mel changed his name to Grandmaster Melle Mel and released his first solo studio album, Muscles. The first single and music video was \\"M3 ‚Äì The New Message\\". He has also released the children's book The Portal in the Park, which features a CD on which children can read and rap along with him. This project featured a then-unknown Lady Gaga. She performs with Mel on the songs \\"World Family Tree\\" and \\"The Fountain Of Truth\\". When asked of a possible reunion in 2002, Melle Mel responded: However, 2014 saw Melle Mel and Scorpio begin playing shows across the United States, UK and Europe as Grandmaster's Furious Five ft Melle [sic] and Scorpio, culminating in them writing and recording new music. Their first single 'Some Kind of Sorry' was released on May 27, 2016, to coincide with a UK and European tour, which they are undertaking alongside The Sugarhill Gang. On August 2, 2017, The Kidd Creole was arrested and charged with the murder of a New York city homeless man. ==Legacy and influence== Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five are a well-respected group in the history of hip-hop music. They have been honored at the VH1 Hip Hop Honors in 2005 and were inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2007. The Smithsonian National Museum of American History in Washington, D.C. displays in their historical archives the vinyl records and the turntable used by DJ Grandmaster Flash. They have influenced many musical acts such as New Order, The Cold Crush Brothers, Run-D.M.C., Whodini, Public Enemy, Boogie Down Productions, KRS-One, EPMD, Stetsasonic, Doug E. Fresh, Salt-n-Pepa, Ultramagnetic MC's, DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince, Eminem, Pharoahe Monch, Busta Rhymes, DJ Quik, Beastie Boys, Hieroglyphics, Too Short, Wu-Tang Clan, Digital Underground, Tupac Shakur, The Notorious B.I.G., N.W.A, Snoop Dogg, Ludacris, Heavy D, and The Roots, among many others.

Storm windows can be made of glass, rigid plastic panels, or flexible plastic sheets; and may be permanently or temporarily mounted. They function similarly to insulated glazing. The term may also refer to a small openable flap found in the side window on light aircraft. In the United States, the older style of this window is often referred to as a \\"storm sash\\". On modern houses they serve on existing windows in order to improve their thermal insulation and soundproofing. Aside from insulation, storm windows provide an additional measure of protection for homes against damages to costly glass panes during inclement weather such as hail. On older houses, storm windows were installed in autumn when window screens were removed. Later units combined the storm and screen pieces. Similarly, storm doors (also called \\"screen doors\\") allow similar energy savings with less efficient primary doors ‚Äì and allow a screen for summer ventilation. ==Energy upgrade== Modern storm windows are a typical energy upgrade solution for cold climates. They are mostly intended to improve the insulation value (R-value) of existing windows, especially single-glazed units.\\"Storm Windows\\"; Energy.gov ==Advantages and disadvantages== Storm windows can be very cost effective in cold climates. They are inexpensive, and can reduce heat loss by up to 50%, increasing the building's comfort and reducing the heating costs, which is difficult to achieve with inexpensive replacement windows. They can also reduce exterior air infiltration significantly. Storm windows are an inexpensive add-on: even the best storm windows - three track exterior windows with low-E glass ‚Äì will cost a small fraction of the price of standard replacement windows. Interior storm windows can produce problems of condensation and be visually obstructive; exterior storm windows can have a negative visual effect. The negative visual effect can be minimized by using single line storm sashes. Condensation problems can be avoided by incorporating vent holes and a sealed fit.\\"Testing the energy performance of wood windows in cold climates\\"; PDF, A Report to The State of Vermont Division for Historic Preservation ==Types== A plastic PVC interior storm panel is particularly inexpensive and easy to install but these panels lose quality over time and may get broken quite easily. Storm windows with Low-E glass and metal frames are a more durable choice, and can provide better insulation. == Manufacturing process and applications == There are several laminated glass manufacturing processes: The first method utilizes two or more pieces of glass bonded between one or more pieces of plasticized polyvinyl butyric resin using heat and pressure. The second method uses two or more pieces of glass and poly-carbonate, bonded together with aliphatic urethane inter-layer under heat and pressure. The third type of laminated glass is interlaid with a cured resin.

Low-rise pants, also known as \\"low-cut jeans\\", \\"lowriders\\" or \\"rap pants\\", are a type of pants that sit low on, or below, the hips, usually at least 8 centimetres (3 inches) lower than the navel. Low-rise pants have been available since the 1990s, in styles for both men and women, with popularity increasing in the 2000s. == Terminology == The \\"rise\\" of any bottom apparel is determined by the distance between the crotch and the waist and is usually around 30 cm (12 inches) on regular pants. In comparison, the average measurement of low-rise trousers is roughly 20 cm (8 inches), with some as little as 7‚Äì10 cm (3-4 inches). Several jeans brands also reflect the rise on the zipper, by creating pants with zippers far shorter than regular pants, usually between 5 and 7 cm (2-3 inches), and some manufacturers, such as Dorinha Jeans Wear, even provide 2.5 cm (1 inch) zippers. The latter can also be classified as \\"ultra low-rise jeans\\", and the small zipper no longer has its traditional function, but is rather a display of fashion.Good Girls Don't Have to Dress Bad: A Style Guide for Every Woman - Shari Braendel. ==History== Hip-huggers, the precursor to low-rise pants, rose to popularity during the mid 1960s due to the mod subculture, and eventually by the hippies in the late 1960s. Often worn with light-cotton, paisley-printed tops or nehru-collared jackets, bell-bottomed hip-huggers were popularized by rock icons such as Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, Jim Morrison, and Robert Plant. Later, hip-huggers became a staple of popular culture and were incorporated into the disco scene of the 1970s. During the late 1970s and early 1980s, however, waistlines moved higher as wide, flared, bell-bottoms gradually gave way to designer straight-legged jeans. Throughout the 1980s and into the 1990s, as more women entered the corporate workforce, the high waist design remained predominant, with commercial designers such as Gloria Vanderbilt and Calvin Klein at the forefront. The 1990s revival of low-rise jeans can be credited to British fashion designer Alexander McQueen, who first showed his famous low-rise \\"bumster\\" trousers in his 1996 \\"Taxi Driver\\" collection show. One commentator observed: \\"The bumster for me is what defined McQueen. For me it was the look that put him on the map because it was controversial. Those little bumsters were in his first shows. It was like 20 people in England were wearing them back then.\\" Following McQueen's lead, the fashion of low-rise pants gradually spread. The iconic low-rise fashion emerged in 2000, particularly among youth; Britney Spears is most credited with popularizing the fashion in the US after she started wearing them that same year.The Gilroy Dispatch - Low-rise Jeans Unflattering to Moms - Thanks a Lot, Britney Spears Although its popularity also increased among women and men of other ages, the major focus of advertising is still directed at teenage girls and boys, with typical teen stores selling low-rise jeans in different styles and colors. Most American teenage and twenty-something-oriented retail stores that carry jeans (e.g., Guess, American Eagle, Abercrombie & Fitch, Stitches) only or mostly carry low-rise jeans. ==Styles== Woman in 2001 wearing low-rise jeans exposing her thong, an early 2000s fashion trend referred to as a whale tail Low-rise jeans are manufactured in many styles, including boot-cut, flared, loose, straight, baggy, skinny, boyfriend, and slim. Due to the popularity of low-rise jeans, manufacturers have also begun making low-rise styles of other kinds of pants, such as cargo pants and dress pants. Low-rise jeans may be worn to display more skin at the waist, torso, and hips. Accordingly, they are sometimes worn in combination with crop tops, giving a glimpse of skin between the jeans and the top, or (more commonly in the summer or in warmer countries) showing their entire midriff including the navel. From 2001 to 2007, the low rise style frequently revealed the thong or G-string underneath, but after 2007 this fell out of favor and thongs began their decline. When the wearer sits down or bends forward, sometimes cleavage is visible. When a thong is exposed above a pair of low-rise jeans on the back, it is commonly referred to as a whale tail, due to its somewhat similar shape. When boxer shorts become visible this is known as \\"sagging\\". Because underwear was no longer always hidden, more men and women choose their underwear to function with their low- rise jeans.Janelle Brown, \\"Here come the buns\\", Salon.com, May 28, 2002.Jennifer D'Angelo, \\"Cleavage Fashion Flips Upside Down\\", FOXNews.com, December 5, 2001. ==Medical concerns== In the Canadian Medical Association Journal 2003, Dr. Malvinder S. Parmar pointed out that wearing tight low-rise jeans may put pressure on a sensory nerve, the lateral cutaneous nerve of the thigh, which can cause pain and paresthesia in the nerve's area of distribution. This is known as meralgia paresthetica and is associated with a tingling or a burning sensation on the lateral aspect of the thigh. The condition was diagnosed in three obese women who had worn low-rise jeans for 6‚Äì8 months. The condition resolved itself after they avoided wearing low-rise jeans for 4‚Äì6 weeks.

Spoofing has both legitimate uses (setting the company name from which the message is being sent, setting your own mobile number, or a product name) and illegitimate uses (such as impersonating another person, company, product). This can also send \\"mysterious\\" messages that look like they are from legitimate numbers or contacts. ==How SMS spoofing is carried out== SMS Spoofing occurs when a sender manipulates address information. Often it is done in order to impersonate a user that has roamed onto a foreign network and is submitting messages to the home network. Frequently, these messages are addressed to destinations outside the home network ‚Äì with the home SMSC essentially being ‚Äúhijacked‚Äù to send messages into other networks. In advanced cases they can even hijack existing contacts in a phone. In other words, you can message from any number you want The impact of this activity is threefold: # The home network can incur termination charges caused by the delivery of these messages to interconnect partners. # These messages can be of concern to interconnect partners. Their customers may complain about being spammed, or the content of the messages may be politically sensitive. Interconnect partners may threaten to cut off the home network unless a remedy is implemented. Home subscribers will be unable to send messages into these networks. # While fraudsters normally used spoofed- identities to send messages, there is a risk that these identities may match those of real home subscribers. The risk therefore emerges, that genuine subscribers may be billed for roaming messages they did not send. If this situation occurs, the integrity of the home operator‚Äôs billing process may be compromised, with potentially huge impact on the brand. The legitimate use cases for SMS spoofing include: # A sender transmits an SMS message from an online computer network for lower more competitive pricing, and for the ease of data entry from a full size console. They must spoof their own number in order to properly identify themselves. # A sender does not have a mobile phone, and they need to send an SMS from a number that they have provided the receiver in advance as a means to activate an account. # A sender adopts the default network gateway identifier provided by an online service, in order to send an anonymous sms, rather than specifying a number of their own choosing. # A third party sends a message to a virtual number, which then forwards (resends) the message to one or more recipients in such a way that the true originator address (rather than the virtual number) appears as the sender ID and the recipient(s) can reply, call, sort, save, or otherwise process the message in the expected way. An SMS Spoofing attack is often first detected by an increase in the number of SMS errors encountered during a bill-run. These errors are caused by the spoofed subscriber identities. Operators can respond by blocking different source addresses in their Gateway-MSCs, but fraudsters can change addresses easily to by-pass these measures. If fraudsters move to using source addresses at a major interconnect partner, it may become unfeasible to block these addresses, due to the potential impact on normal interconnect services. ==Legality== In 2007, The UK premium rate regulator, PhonepayPlus (formerly ICSTIS) concluded a public consultation on anonymous SMS, in which they stated they were not averse to the operation of such services. However, in 2008 PhonePayPlus introduced new regulation covering anonymous SMS, requiring anonymous SMS service providers to send a follow-up message to the recipient stating that a spoofed SMS has been sent to them, and operate a complaints helpline. ==Protecting users from SMS spoofing== If a user can prove that their SMS sessions have been spoofed, they should contact both law enforcement and their cellular provider, who should be able to track where the SMS messages were actually sent from. A user may also modify the phone's settings so that only messages from authorized numbers are allowed. This is not always effective since hackers could be impersonating the user's friends as well. ==References== Category:Mobile technology Category:Computer security exploits Category:Cybercrime Category:Text messaging ","title":"SMS spoofing"},{"id":"3231328","text":"James Masayoshi Mitose (born Masayoshi Mitose, December 30, 1916 - March 26, 1981) was a Japanese American martial artist who brought the art of Kenpo to the United States starting in 1936. Many Kenpo teachers trace their lineage to him. Mitose was and remains a controversial figure in the history of Kenpo in America. He was convicted of murder and extortion in 1974 and given a life sentence. He died in prison in 1981 due to complications from diabetes. ==Martial arts training and lineage== James Masayoshi Mitose (Masakichi Kosho Kenposai) was born in Kailua-Kona, North Kona District, Hawaii on December 30, 1916. On October 22, 1920, at the age of four, he and his two sisters were taken by their mother back to Japan to be given formal education and upbringing with family living there. While there, in addition to their schoolwork and university studies, they trained in the art of Kenpo. James returned to Hawaii on February 25, 1935, arriving at Honolulu on the SS Tatsuta Maru at the age of 21. His martial arts practices contained marked similarities to Okinawan karate and Japanese jujutsu. Mitose always claimed his art was Japanese rather than Okinawan. Mitose began teaching Kenpo in Hawaii in 1936, and in 1941 set up a martial arts school. He gave the style he taught a number of different names during his lifetime, including \\"Shorinji Kenpo\\" and \\"Kenpo Jujutsu,\\" (both names of recognized Japanese martial arts), but over time, settled on the name Kosho Sh≈çrei-ry≈´ Kenpo. The word \\"Kenpo\\" (or \\"Kempo\\") is the Japanese pronunciation of \\"Ch'uan Fa.\\" When the attack on Pearl Harbor occurred, Mitose enlisted in the Hawaii National Guard, but was honorably discharged after three weeks. He was later interned in Sand Island, a camp on the north side of Oahu. After his release in 1942,he spent most of the war teaching Kenpo in Hawaii to prepare American civilians for a possible Japanese invasion. He worked as an herbalist and was known to be an extraordinary healer. Tracy's Kenpo has martial lineage through Ray Arquilla to James Mitose and Will Tracy trained under GM Fusae Mitose (Mitose's sister). Mitose claimed that his family in Japan lived near a \\"Mt. Akenkai's Shaka-In temple.\\" Tracy's believe that Mount Akenkai might be Mount Kinkai, near the town of Kinkai, Nagasaki on the island of Ky≈´sh≈´. This may have been where the Kosho sect of the Yoshida (Urabe) clan taught. Michael Brown of Rhode Island Martial Arts possesses documents showing three families of James Mitose. The first family being from Mitose's father's side. This includes his father, Otokichi Mitose and Otokichi's parents, Kaheiji Mitose, and Kano Kawakami Mitose. The second family, from Mitose's mother's side, includes his mother Kiyoka Yoshida Mitose and Kiyoka's biological father, Sakuhei Yoshida. Sakuhei Yoshida was married to a woman who was not Kiyoka's biological mother. Sakuhei Yoshida conceived Kiyoka Yoshida Mitose with a woman outside of his marriage named Toju Kosho. James Mitose would learn Kosho-ry≈´ from the family of Toju Kosho. It is worthwhile to note that on Mitose's parents' record of marriage, Kiyoka Yoshida Mitose's mother is not named as Toju Kosho. Instead the name Toju Unknown occupies this position of the document. To his students and in his book, What is True Self-Defense?, Mitose described his teachings as those of Japanese style. In the book, Mitose describes methods of Japanese yoga and the tai sabaki principles found in many Japanese arts. His later book, What Is Self Defense? and accounts and photos strongly suggest that, however he got it, Mitose had a background in an Okinawan style. Some modern proponents of Kosho Sh≈çrei-ry≈´ believe that he used an Okinawan art as a vehicle for his teaching of a native Japanese art. The contents of What Is Self Defense? seem to echo those of an earlier book: Karate Kenpo by Mutsu Mizuho (1933). This includes the arrangement of diagrams and photographs; in one case, a photo (of Higaonna Kamesuke) is reproduced entirely. Mitose's book also includes a picture of Motobu Ch≈çki, reproduced from Motobu's book, in a position that usually indicates a student acknowledging his teacher. It is from here that some assume that Mitose was acknowledging Motobu as his teacher. Mitose listed Motobu as a Kenpo master in his book. Mitose is known to have taught only one Kata at his school: the Naihanchi Kata, which also was Motobu Ch≈çki's primary form and the only one featured in Motubu's second book Okinawan Kenpo Kumite Hen. Mitose also taught the use of the Makiwara, a signature Okinawan training method. A thriving Okinawan community existed in Hawaii and Okinawan martial arts training was available there. Higaonna Kamesuke stayed in Hawaii after 1933 with Thomas Miyashiro, and taught classes in Kona. Higaonna had studied under Mutsu and Motobu, and taught Karate Kenpo in Mitose's home town of Kona just a few years before Mitose opened his school, although Mitose was still in Japan at the time. ==Kosho Shorei-Ry≈´ Kenpo== Mitose ultimately called his style Kosho Shorei-Ry≈´ Kenpo, which can be translated as \\"Old Pine Tree School Fist Law\\". Matsumura S≈çkon's style, which he taught to Ank≈ç Itosu who taught it to Gichin Funakoshi and Motobu Ch≈çki, was Okinawan Sh≈çrin-ry≈´, which is often translated as \\"Little Forest School\\". When Mitose first began teaching in 1936, he called his art Kenpo Jiu-Jitsu (\\"fist law flexible technique\\") and would later refer to it as Shorinji (small forest temple) Kempo (a Japanese translation of \\"qu√°nf«é,\\" which means \\"fist law\\" in English) or goshin jutsu (\\"self-defense technique\\"). The word \\"Shorin\\" is characteristic of styles from Okinawa, although in modern times \\"Shorinji Kempo\\" is used to refer to an unrelated Japanese martial sect founded by Doshin So in 1947. Mitose claimed that he learned martial arts and religion in a Buddhist temple, but his descriptions of organization and practices of the temple do not match those practiced by mainstream Japanese Buddhism. It is possible that Mitose came from a heterodox background. Mitose often dressed as a Christian minister. In \\"What Is True Self Defense?\\" he stated that one should practice the dominant religion of whatever country one is in, including its application to martial arts and spiritual practices. This book (the original manuscript of his first book was completed and published while he was imprisoned), discourages offensive martial arts techniques completely, presenting its contents as a form of yoga and escape. Mitose even writes that karate is \\"evil.\\" The description or lineage Mitose gave for his style also emphasized its Chinese roots. As a Japanese-American emigrating to Hawaii in 1935, he might have prudently downplayed the Japanese side of his background. ==Later years and conviction== In 1953, James Mitose ceased teaching Kenpo regularly and moved to Southern California. He privately taught a few students in that time, including Terry Lee for about a year. In 1974 Mitose was arrested in Los Angeles and convicted of murder and extortion stemming from a conflict over a loan and a murder committed by Terry Lee. During the trial there was conflicting testimony and the court acknowledged that Japanese testimony had not been accurately translated. According to trial transcripts, James Mitose denied inciting Lee to commit murder but took responsibility as his martial arts instructor. Lee claimed Mitose had suggested on numerous occasions that Lee commit murder. Lee also testified that Mitose and his wife Dorothy had given him a rope, a knife, a screwdriver and an air pistol in order to carry out his actions. Mr. Namimatsu was killed by Lee on March 20, 1974. The official cause of death was strangulation by rope. Namimatsu also suffered a completely collapsed eye, had been stabbed multiple times with a screwdriver and had a shoe imprint on his chest matching the shoes Lee was wearing. After the assault, Lee testified he had left Namimatsu breathing. As a result of Lee's testimony, Mitose was sentenced to life in prison. He served the majority of his sentence at Folsom State Prison but when his health deteriorated, he was transferred to San Quentin State Prison and died there of complications from diabetes on March 26, 1981. The actual murderer, Lee was given three years for testifying against his teacher/employer. While in prison, on two occasions Mitose attempted to instruct his son Thomas Barro Mitose, who referred to his father as a \\"crazy old man\\", and refused to accept his fathers teachings. He also instructed Bruce Juchnik, Rick Alemany, Ray Arquilla, and Eugene Sedeno verbally. In \\"What is True Self Defense?\\", he acknowledges Arnold Golub as \\"Honorable Headmaster\\", an \\"administrative title\\", and the other four men as \\"Honorable Masters 1-4.\\" In later years after Mitoses' passing, Golub would insist that Mitose intended him to oversee Kosho, not Juchnik. He would ultimately support Thomas as the 22nd Great-Grandmaster and inheritor of the art, and be given a high position in the MKKI. In James Mitose's final days he was visited by his wife Dorothy, son Alvin, and Bruce Juchnik. Mitose's last will and testament is still being debated and argued about to the present. James Mitose maintained his innocence until his death. The details of the crime and Mitose's role remain controversial in the martial arts community. ==ReferencesCategory:1916 births Category:1981 deaths Category:Deaths from diabetes Category:American martial artists Category:Kenp≈ç Category:Hawaii National Guard personnel ","title":"James Mitose"},{"id":"3231356","text":"\\"I Got a Woman\\" (originally titled \\"I've Got a Woman\\") is a song co-written and recorded by American R&B; and soul musician Ray Charles. Atlantic Records released the song as a single in December 1954, with \\"Come Back Baby\\" as the B-side. Both songs later appeared on the 1957 album Ray Charles (subsequently reissued as Hallelujah I Love Her So). ==Origin== The song builds on \\"It Must Be Jesus\\" by the Southern Tones, which Ray Charles was listening to on the radio while on the road with his band in the summer of 1954. He and a member of his band, trumpeter Renald Richard, penned a song that was built along a gospel-frenetic pace with secular lyrics and a jazz-inspired rhythm and blues (R&B;) background. The song would be one of the prototypes for what later became termed as \\"soul music\\" after Charles released \\"What'd I Say\\" nearly five years later. ==Recording== The song was recorded on November 18, 1954 in the Atlanta studios of Georgia Tech radio station WGST. It was a hit‚ÄîCharles' first‚Äîclimbing quickly to #1 R&B; in January 1955. Charles told the Pop Chronicles that he performed this song for about a year before he recorded it. The song would lead to more hits for Charles during this period when he was with Atlantic. It was later ranked No. 239 on Rolling Stones list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time, one of Charles' five songs on the list. A re- recorded version by Ray Charles, entitled \\"I Gotta Woman\\" (ABC-Paramount 10649) reached No. 79 on the Billboard pop chart in 1965. ==The Beatles versions== The Beatles recorded two versions of the song for BBC radio. The first version was recorded on 16 July 1963 at the BBC Paris Theatre in London for the Pop Go The Beatles radio show. This version was first released in 1994 on the Live at the BBC compilation. The second version the band recorded was recorded on 31 March 1964 at the Playhouse Theatre in London for the Saturday Club radio show. This version was released in 2013 for the On Air ‚Äì Live at the BBC Volume 2 compilation and is shorter than the Live at the BBC version. ==Other cover versions== Other versions that have made the pop or R&B; charts in the US are those by Jimmy McGriff (#20 pop, #5 R&B;, 1962), Freddie Scott (#48 pop, 1963), and Ricky Nelson (#49 pop, 1963).

Nicol appeared in many Westerns including The Man from Laramie (1955). He appeared in more than forty feature films as well as directing many television shows including The Wild Wild West (1967), Tarzan (1966), and Daniel Boone (1966). He also played many roles on Broadway. ==Biography== Nicol was born in Ossining, New York, in 1916. When his movie career started thirty-four years later he adjusted the year to 1919. \\"I was a little older than some of the other people under contract so I thought, 'Well, I'll cure that right now',\\" he later confessed. His father was the arms keeper at Sing Sing. He studied at the Feagin School of Dramatic Art before joining Maurice Evans' theatrical company, with whom he made his Broadway debut with a walk-on in Henry IV, Part 1 (1939). Later a member of The Actors Studio, Nicol would play Brick in Tennessee Williams's Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, under the direction of Studio co-founder Elia Kazan. However, it was as a character actor that Nicol spent most of his career. He also directed films, and appeared frequently on television. His acting career was interrupted by a five-year stint in the army. He served with the 101st Cavalry and attained the rank of Technical Sergeant. Upon discharge, Nicol returned to Broadway in a revival of Clifford Odets' pro-union drama Waiting for Lefty (1946). Shortly thereafter, he was admitted to The Actors Studio, where he worked with Elia Kazan; this led to a role in the Studio's 1948 production of Sundown Beach, staged by Kazan. Nicol next appeared in Forward the Heart, and then as part of the original cast of Rodgers and Hammerstein's musical South Pacific (1949), playing one of the marines, but after a few weeks in the show he successfully auditioned to replace Ralph Meeker as Mannion in Mister Roberts, and was also made understudy to the play's star Henry Fonda. While acting in Mister Roberts, Nicol was seen by the Universal Studios director George Sherman, who was in New York City to film The Sleeping City (1950). He cast Nicol as a young doctor. Nicol was given a contract by Universal, and Sherman also directed his second film, Tomahawk (1951), in which he played a cavalry officer with a hatred of Indians. Small roles as a prisoner of war in Target Unknown (1951) and a trainee pilot in Air Cadet (1951) preceded Nicol's first major part, co-starring with Frank Sinatra and Shelley Winters in the musical drama Meet Danny Wilson (1952). In his next film he was an antagonist again, causing Loretta Young to be wrongly sent to prison in Because of You (1952). He played a troublesome sergeant in Red Ball Express (1952), directed by Budd Boetticher. Nicol's first lead role was opposite Maureen O'Hara in The Redhead from Wyoming (1953) directed by Lee Sholem. Going freelance, Nicol was directed by Daniel Mann in About Mrs. Leslie (1953) starring Shirley Booth and Robert Ryan. Nicol returned to Universal (at a much larger salary than he had been getting as a contract player) to appear in two George Sherman films, The Lone Hand (1953) and Dawn at Socorro (1954). Nicol then made three films in England, most notably Ken Hughes' The House Across the Lake (1954). Anthony Mann directed Nicol in his role as a navigator in Strategic Air Command (1955), and it was Mann who then gave the actor his best-remembered role as the weak psychopathic son of a patriarch rancher (Donald Crisp) that menaced Jimmy Stewart in The Man from Laramie (1955). After a supporting role in Jacques Tourneur's Great Day in the Morning (1956) Nicol believed his Hollywood career was not progressing. In 1956 he returned to Broadway to replace Ben Gazzara in the lead role of Brick, in Cat on a Hot Tin Roof. When the Broadway run ended Nicol starred in the tour. Poster for Nicol's directorial debut, The Screaming Skull Nicol starred with Shelley Winters in the play Saturday Night Kid (1958). He then returned to Hollywood where he made his first film as a director, The Screaming Skull (1958), in which he also acted. Nicol traveled to Italy when director Martin Ritt gave him a role in Five Branded Women (1959). While there he was offered parts in other movies. He and his family remained in Europe for two years. One of his last assignments in Italy was another directorial credit, Then There Were Three, also known as Three Came Back, a World War II combat and spy actioner, which he also produced and was one of the co-stars, along with Frank Latimore. Returning to the United States in 1961, he played Paul Anka's father in the thriller Look in Any Window (1961), with subsequent acting roles including The Twilight Zone episode \\"Young Man's Fancy\\" in 1962; two westerns, The Savage Guns (1962) and Gunfighters of Casa Grande (1964); Roger Corman's Bloody Mama (1969), based on the life of Ma Barker, and the independently mede religious horror The Night God Screamed. Second-billed to star Jeanne Crain, he portrayed her husband, a small-time evangelist whose death at film's midpoint occurs through crucifixion by religious fanatics led by a charismatic guru styled upon Charles Manson, whose 1969 cult murders were still fresh in the public's mind during the film's production in 1971. Nicol later worked as a director in television and did episodes of Daniel Boone, Wild Wild West, and many episodes for Tarzan starring Ron Ely. The last film in which he acted was A*P*E (1976), an independent movie made by a friend of the actor. He retired in the late 1980s and died of natural causes in Montecito, California in 2001. Alex Nicol was survived by his wife, Jean and his three children, Lisa Nicol, Alexander Nicol III, and Eric Nicol. ==ReferencesAlex Nicol at the American Film Institute Catalog * * Category:1916 births Category:2001 deaths Category:American male stage actors Category:American male film actors Category:Male Western (genre) film actors Category:American male television actors Category:American film directors Category:American television directors Category:Male actors from New York (state) Category:United States Army soldiers Category:20th-century American male actors ","title":"Alex Nicol"},{"id":"3231370","text":"Plugger may refer to: * Precision Lightweight GPS Receiver (PLGR), a US military handheld GPS system colloquially known as the \\"plugger\\" * Flip-flops, a type of footwear similar to sandals but without securing the ankles * Tony Lockett, a former Australian rules footballer * Song plugger, a musician employed by a music publisher to promote their songs ==See also== *Pluggers, comic strip ","title":"Plugger"},{"id":"3231399","text":"Tear of a Doll, previously called \\"Tears of a Doll\\" (also known as T.O.D.) is a musical group from Paris, France which started as a hardcore punk band and later blended the speed and energy of that style with more complex structures inherited from the experiments of 1970s progressive rock, 1990s noise rock or math rock and even non-western traditional music. Tear of a Doll also features female vocals sung in various languages (mainly English, but also Japanese, German, French and Hungarian). ==Biography== ===Early history 1988-1992=== Tears of a Doll started in Paris, France, in October 1982, as a sequel to Heimat-los (an influential Hardcore punk from the 80s): It was founded by three members of that band. Originally they spelled their name with an \\"S\\". Their name was chosen as opposite of the typical Hardcore punk band names, and also in reference to a style of Hardcore that had originated in Washington, D.C. and that would be later called \\"emo\\". ===Later history 1992-...=== After they lost their original singer (Norbert from Heimat-los) and their second guitarist (Nydeu, ex. Kromozom 4) and got a new drummer (the third one), they took the opportunity to radically change their sound. From then on they created a new repertoire showing obvious influences of Victims Family and NoMeansNo but with a very personal touch. Astrid Orion (female vocalist) joined the band around that time. The most representative recording of Tear of a Doll is a full-length untitled album recorded in 1996 on which wild hardcore punk songs are interspersed with more experimental songs that some would label avant-garde rock. Since the end of 1996 guitarist and founding member Fran√ßois L'H. has spent more time expatriated in Asia than in France. During this time the band has been almost inactive, only playing at Trans-Musicales (1997), a festival in Rennes, France and occasionally releasing a few songs on compilations. == Discography == === With Norbert on vocals (up to 1992) === * Ca y est t'es r√©veill√©? cassette (2nd demo tape), 1990 * Various artists \\"Euro punk domain\\" LP, Black Hand (Czech Republic), 1991 * Various artists \\"Don't forget the punks of Bangkok\\" 12\\"EP (USA) 1991 * Tears of a Doll\\" (untilted) EP, Alternativnoise (France), 1992 * Various artists \\"Art primitif\\", On a faim (France) === With Astrid Orion on vocals (from 1992 on) === * La fille aux allumettes cassette, 1993 * Une araign√©e dans le plafond cassette, 1994 * Tear of a Doll\\" (untilted) CD, Pandemonium & Dodoll (France), 1996 * Various artists \\"La col√®re\\" Angrrr (France), 1997 * Various artists Bars en trans 97\\", 1997 * Various artists 5 years of Pandemonium\\", Pandemonium (France),1998 * Various artists Allez les filles!\\", Rock Hardi * \\"Erase-yer-head No. 9\\" split EP with Melt Banana, God is My Co-Pilot & Camp Blackfoot, Pandemonium, 1999 * Various artists International Punk Boxset\\" (10 CD in a metal box), Canada, 2002 * Various artists Une autre vision des choses\\" (Re)Aktion (France) * Various artists Hangover heartattack (a tribute to Poison Idea)\\", Farewell, Network of Friends (Germany) & Ataque Sonoro (Portugal), 2003 Category:French hardcore punk groups Category:Math rock groups Category:Noise rock groups Category:Musical groups from Paris ","title":"Tear of a Doll"},{"id":"3231407","text":"Colonel D.M.

With increasing interest in the NFL Draft, the scouting combine has grown in scope and significance, allowing personnel directors to evaluate upcoming prospects in a standardized setting. Its origins have evolved from the National, BLESTO, and Quadra Scouting organizations in 1977 to the media event it has become today. Athletes attend by invitation only. An athlete's performance during the combine can affect their draft status and salary, and ultimately their career. The draft has popularized the term \\"workout warrior\\", whereby an athlete's \\"draft stock\\" is increased based on superior measurable qualities such as size, speed, and strength, despite having an average or sub- par college career. ==History== Tex Schramm, the president and general manager of the Dallas Cowboys from 1960 to 1989, proposed to the NFL competition committee a centralization of the evaluation process for NFL teams. Prior to 1982, teams had to schedule individual visits with players to run them through drills and tests. The national invitational camp (NIC) was first held in Tampa, Florida, in 1982. It was originated by National Football Scouting, Inc. as a means for member organizations to look at NFL draft prospects. For non- member teams, two other camps were created and used 1982‚Äì1984. The NIC was held in New Orleans, Louisiana, in 1984. It was renamed the NFL Scouting Combine following the merger of the three camps in 1985 to cut the cost of running the extra camps. It was held in Arizona in 1985 and once again in New Orleans in 1986 before permanently moving to Indianapolis in 1987. == Tests and evaluations == Tests/evaluations include: * 40-yard dash * Bench press (225 lb repetitions) * Vertical jump * Broad jump * 20-yard shuttle * 3 cone drill * 60-yard shuttle * Position-specific drills * Interviews ‚Äì each team is allowed 60 interviews in 15-minute intervals * Physical measurements * Injury evaluation * Drug screen * The Cybex test * The Wonderlic test Sports writers question whether these tests have any relationship with future NFL performance. Empirical research conducted by Brian D. Lyons, Brian J. Hoffman, John W. Michel, and Kevin J. Williams (2011) found that the 40-yard dash, vertical jump, 20-yard shuttle, and 3 cone drill tests have limited validity in predicting future NFL performance. In fact, the Lyons et al. (2011) study suggests that a prospect's past performance in college is a better indicator of future NFL performance than the aforementioned physical ability tests. ===20-yard shuttle=== The 20-yard shuttle, also simply called the short shuttle, is primarily run to evaluate the quickness and change-of-direction ability of players. Although not as highly regarded a test as the 40-yard dash, it is still an important barometer used by NFL personnel to compare players. Canadian football also uses the shuttle test. The name \\"20-yard shuttle\\" is derived from the total yards that athletes travel during the drill. This drill is also known as the \\"short shuttle\\" or the \\"5-10-5\\" drill.\\" The athlete starts at the center cone of three cones, each a distance of 5 yards apart. The athlete then pushes off their dominant leg in the opposite direction for 5 yards and touches the line. After covering this distance and touching the line as quickly as possible, the athlete must reverse and go 10 yards in the opposite direction and again touch the line. Finally, they reverse direction again, ending the drill at the starting point after traveling another 5 yards. The procedure is timed and the athlete starts the drill on reaction to the word \\"Go\\" as announced by the person starting the stopwatch. The NFL Scouting Combine allows each participant three opportunities to run the drill, and the best time of the three attempts is recorded as that players' time. The drill is designed to measure short-area quickness, lateral movement, flexibility and the speed at which a player can change directions. The drill also gives scouts an idea of how well a player can keep a low center of gravity as well as their ability to sink their hips.NFL Combine Drills Explained ===Bench press=== At the NFL combine, bench press is used as a test of muscle strength and stamina, in which athletes lift as many times as possible. Since 1999, only 17 men at the combine have managed to achieve more than 40 repetitions. * 51 reps: Justin Ernest (1999) * 49 reps: Stephen Paea (2011) * 45 reps: Mike Kudla (2006), Mitch Petrus (2010), and Leif Larsen (2000) * 44 reps: Brodrick Bunkley (2006), Jeff Owens (2010), Dontari Poe (2012), and Netane Muti (2020) * 43 reps: Scott Young (2005), Larry Allen (2006) * 42 reps: Isaac Sopoaga (2004), Tank Tyler (2007), Russell Bodine (2014), Harrison Phillips (2018) * 41 reps: Igor Olshansky (2004), Terna Nande (2006), David Molk (2012), and Vita Vea (2018) ==Scouting organizations== The NFL's first scouting organization, LESTO (Lions, Eagles and Steelers Talent Organization), was started in 1963 by the teams mentioned in its name with headquarters in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. It became BLESTO when the Bears joined the following year and BLESTO-V when the Vikings came on board later in the decade; by 1971 the Bills, Colts and Dolphins had joined and the group was known as BLESTO-VIII. It is now known simply as BLESTO despite the fact that the Bears and Eagles are no longer members. The group's offices stayed in Pittsburgh until 2007 when the headquarters moved to Jacksonville, Florida, with support offices remaining in Pittsburgh. CEPO (Central Eastern Personnel Organization), formed in 1964, was a joint venture of the Colts, Browns, Packers and Cardinals. Its name was changed to United Scouting after the Falcons, Giants and Redskins joined, then to National Football Scouting in 1983 to avoid confusion with the United States Football League, which began operations that year. National Football Scouting is now known simply as The National. Another scouting organization formed in 1964 was Troika, launched by the Cowboys, Rams and 49ers. It was renamed Quadra when the Saints joined in 1967. Quadra no longer exists; its former members now all belong to The National. As of the 2015 season, eighteen franchises participate in The National (Arizona Cardinals, Atlanta Falcons, Carolina Panthers, Cincinnati Bengals, Dallas Cowboys, Denver Broncos, Green Bay Packers, Houston Texans, Kansas City Chiefs, New Orleans Saints, New York Jets, Philadelphia Eagles, Los Angeles Rams, Los Angeles Chargers, San Francisco 49ers, Seattle Seahawks, Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and Tennessee Titans), with eight served by BLESTO (Buffalo Bills, Detroit Lions, Jacksonville Jaguars, Miami Dolphins, Minnesota Vikings, New York Giants, Pittsburgh Steelers, and Washington Redskins). Each of the six non-affiliated teams (Baltimore Ravens, Chicago Bears, Cleveland Browns, Indianapolis Colts, Las Vegas Raiders, and New England Patriots) relies on its in-house scouting staffs. ==Combine invitations== In a typical year, there are about 330 invited players. About 250 invitations are sent before bowl games are completed to those who have completed their seasons. However, underclassmen have until mid-January to confirm their draft status. Invitations are made to those receiving supermajority support from the selection committee. ==Criticism== Sports writer Steve Silverman explains, in an article he wrote, what happened to Terrell Suggs in 2003. Suggs was a star player for Arizona State but when Suggs ran a slow 4.83 40 he was downgraded. Later, he became a star player for the Ravens. Doug Tatum of Times-Picayune argues that it is unlikely players will be asked to run a 40-yard dash again during their career. Silverman says that the best way to scout is to simply watch them play. Others think the value in the 40 depends on the position; Daniel Jeremiah, a former scout and an analyst on the NFL Network says \\"The position where the 40 holds the most weight is cornerback. If you're a receiver who runs a 4.6 like (Anquan) Boldin, but you have short-area quickness and strong hands, the 40 isn't a big deal. But if you're a cornerback who runs a 4.6 and you're facing a receiver who runs a 4.4, it doesn't matter how good your ball skills are.\\" ==Television== The NFL scouting combine was first shown on television in 2004. Media and cameras were historically prohibited, but with the launch of NFL Network on November 4, 2003, six installments of one-hour shows to recap the day's events aired in February 2004. NFL Network aired two hours of combine workouts for each workout day in 2005, 26 total hours of coverage in 2006, 27 hours in 2007, and 25 hours in 2009. It began airing over 30 hours of Combine coverage starting in 2010, which received 5.24 million viewers. In 2019, ESPN began to additionally provide live coverage from the Combine, with daily broadcasts of NFL Live on-site, including a two-hour edition airing on ABC with coverage of quarterback and wide receiver drills (marking the first time that official coverage had been provided outside of NFL Network). ==Regional combines== Beginning in 2011, a series of eleven regional combines for players not invited to the main scouting combine, as well as other free agents, were held in eight cities (Los Angeles, Houston, Baltimore, Tampa, East Rutherford, Chicago, Atlanta, and Cleveland) from January to March. The best players from these regional combines were invited to the NFL super regional combine at Ford Field in Detroit in late March. In 2016, the NFL went away from this format only holding five Combines in Houston, Arizona, Baltimore, Minnesota and New Orleans. ==Veteran combine== The first NFL Veteran Combine was scheduled on March 22, 2015 at the Arizona Cardinals' team facility. The combine corresponded with the NFL owners' meetings also being held in Phoenix from March 22‚Äì24, 2015. The combine featured veteran free agents, and all 32 clubs in attendance. There were over 2,000 applications from players to participate, although only a select few were chosen. Some of the notable players included Adam Carriker, Felix Jones, Michael Sam, and Brady Quinn. However, only two players participating in the combine (linebacker Brandon Copeland and tight end Ifeanyi Momah) were still on NFL rosters by Week 1 of the 2015 regular season. The NFL cancelled the planned 2016 Veteran Combine, citing a lack of player interest. On December 16, 2016, the NFL announced it would bring back the veteran combine renaming it the Pro Player Combine and focus its attention on younger players instead of veterans trying to get another chance in the NFL. ==See also== * Progression of the bench press world record ==ReferencesCombine on NFL.com * NFL Regional Combines website Category:National Football League Draft Category:Sports in Indianapolis ","title":"NFL Scouting Combine"},{"id":"3231444","text":"Rev.

Jarm Logue added an \\"n\\" to the end of his last name, learned to read, worked various jobs in Canada and New York, studied at the Oneida Institute in Whitesboro, New York, and opened schools for black children in Utica and Syracuse, New York. Jarm and Caroline Logue ran a major depot (stop) on the Underground Railroad. When they built their Syracuse home, they had a special ‚Äúfugitive chamber‚Äù built for their operation. The Logue family did not hide the fact that they were helping runaway slaves. They would provide them with meals, a bath, and a sense of security. If any of the slaves decided to settle in the area, the Logues would help them find a job. Jarm Logue was known as ‚Äú‚ÄòKing of the Underground Railroad.‚Äô Caroline was his queen.‚Äù Loguen became an elder in the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church and took the middle name Wesley after John Wesley, founder of the Methodist movement. He held various church posts and was appointed bishop in 1868. Loguen became a popular abolitionist speaker and authored an autobiography, The Rev. J. W. Loguen, as a Slave and as a Freeman, a Narrative of Real Life (1859). The wife of his former master, Sarah Logue, wrote Loguen demanding $1000 compensation. Loguen wrote a scathing reply which was published in The Liberator. == The Jerry Rescue == Loguen was involved in rescuing William Henry, a cooper and a former slave. On October 1, 1851, Henry, known as \\"Jerry,\\" was arrested under the Fugitive Slave Law. The anti-slavery Liberty Party was holding its state convention in the city, and when word of the arrest spread, several hundred abolitionists broke into the city jail and freed Jerry. The event came to be widely known as the Jerry Rescue. After the rescue, several people accused Loguen of assaulting a federal marshal and encouraging the violence of others. Although Loguen admitted he was at the planning of the rescue, he denied participating in the storming of the building or committing any type of violence. Fearful of being returned to slavery, he took refuge in Canada. Once in Canada, Loguen wrote a letter to District Attorney Lawrence denying the charges made against him. He also wrote a letter to New York governor, Washington Hunt, saying that he was willing to face trial if he could be assured that he wouldn‚Äôt be captured and returned to slavery. Loguen didn‚Äôt receive an answer to either letter. After the trials concluded, and a letter was published in the Frederick Douglass‚Äô Paper that claimed that Loguen would be safe in Syracuse, Loguen decided to come back to Syracuse. He was now confident that the Fugitive Slave Law was nullified in Syracuse, and so they conducted the Underground Railroad in an open manner. Loguen printed announcements about fugitives passing through Syracuse in newspapers, advertised his personal address, and gave reports of the amount of fugitives who came through his home. ==Family== Loguen married Caroline Storum, who was born near Jamestown, New York. She was biracial, from a free and educated abolitionist family. Jermain and Carolina had six children. Their daughter, Amelia, married Lewis Henry Douglass, oldest son of the famous abolitionist Frederick Douglass, in 1869. Amelia (Helen Amelia) and Lewis followed in their parents' footsteps, passionate for justice and education for the enslaved and newly freed. Another daughter, Sarah Loguen Fraser, became one of the first African-American women to become a licensed medical practitioner, and later became the first female doctor in the Dominican Republic. ==See also== *Sarah Loguen Fraser *List of slaves ==References== ==Further reading== * edition of his 1859 memoir: The Rev.

According to the 2011 census it had a population of 1,534. ==History== Berrow was part of the hundred of Brent-cum-Wrington. ==Governance== The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council's operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council. The village falls within the Non-metropolitan district of Sedgemoor, which was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, having previously been part of Axbridge Rural District, which is responsible for local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection and recycling, cemeteries and crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism. Somerset County Council is responsible for running the largest and most expensive local services such as education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, policing and fire services, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning. An electoral ward of the same name exists. Although Berrow is the most populous area the ward stretches north along the coast to Brean. The total population of this ward taken from the 2011 census was 2,169. It is also part of the a county constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election, and part of the South West England constituency of the European Parliament which elects seven MEPs using the d'Hondt method of party-list proportional representation. ==Church== The Church of St Mary dates from the 13th century and was restored in the 19th. The tower contains a bell dating from 1801 and made by Thomas and James Bilbie of the Bilbie family. It has been designated by English Heritage as a grade I listed building. ==Beach and dunes== The wreck of the Norwegian barque SS Nornen on Berrow beach The wreck of the barque Nornen in 2006 Berrow beach was awarded the Blue flag rural beach award in 2005. The beach is home to the shipwreck of the Norwegian barque SS Nornen, which ran aground on 3 March 1897. The ship was built in 1876 as the Maipu in Bordeaux, before being sold to S. C. Larson in Norway and renamed. She ran aground in a storm and most of the structure was removed for scrap. In July 2003, Sedgemoor District Council threatened to remove the wreck from the beach fearing it could be held liable if any jet-skiers were to hit the wreck while submerged at high tide. Berrow Dunes, west of the village, has a golf course, and is a noted site for various unusual plants, including a strong colony of lizard orchids. A 200 hectare (494 acre) area was designated in 1952 as a Site of Special Scientific Interest. Berrow Marsh, contained within the dunes between the village and the beach, is a mixture of reedbed and salt marsh. Birds found here include many wetland species such as reed and sedge warbler and in winter occasional jack snipe amongst large numbers of common snipe. ==Notable people== * Charles Brooke, Rajah of Sarawak born in the vicarage in 1829 ==References== ==External links== Category:Villages in Sedgemoor Category:Sites of Special Scientific Interest in Somerset Category:Sites of Special Scientific Interest notified in 1952 Category:Somerset Levels Category:Civil parishes in Somerset Category:Populated coastal places in Somerset ","title":"Berrow, Somerset"},{"id":"3231494","text":"Pulau Tekong Reservoir (; ) is a reservoir located on the north west of Pulau Tekong, an island in Singapore.

It was one of only eight feudal baronies in Devon. The family retained the barony until 1547. It comprised almost 32 knight's fees in the Cartae Baronum of 1166.Sanders, I.J. English Baronies, Oxford, 1960, pp.106-7 The family came from La Pommeraye, Calvados, near Falaise in Normandy.Sanders, op.cit., quoting Anglo_Norman Families, p.78; See also: Powley, E.B. The House of De La Pomerai, Liverpool, 1944 ==Berry Pomeroy Castle== Berry Pomeroy Castle, about one mile north-east of the village, was built as the home of the de la Pomerayearly spelling Pomeray, per Vivian, Heraldic Visitations of Devon, 1895, p.605-6 family in the late 15th century. On 1 December 1547 Sir Thomas Pomeroy (d.1566) sold the castle, park and manor of Berry Pomeroy, with other lands, to Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset.Vivian, Heraldic Visitations of Devon, 1895, p.607 The duke gave it to his eldest son from his first marriage, Sir Edward Seymour henceforth known as \\"of Berry Pomeroy\\" to distinguish him from the duke's other three sons also named Edward. The duke's second wife later persuaded him to exclude by entail the children of his first marriage from inheriting his main estates. However, on the expiry of the line of descent from this second marriage, the Berry Pomeroy line inherited the Dukedom of Somerset, in the person of Edward Seymour, 8th Duke of Somerset. The Castle was abandoned by the Seymour family in the late 17th century and was later considered a 'romantic ruin' by the Victorians. It is still owned by the Duke of Somerset, but is now maintained by English Heritage. The castle has often been cited as being the most haunted castle in Britain, and has appeared in a BBC Timewatch documentary \\"White Slaves and Pirate Gold\\", and the British television show Most Haunted. ===Castle Legends=== The castle is said to be haunted by several ghosts. There is a beautiful young lady, most likely a Pomeroy, who is a portent of death. Lady Margaret Pomeroy, who was imprisoned by her sister Lady Eleanor Pomeroy and starved to death in the castle dungeons now attempts to lure the living to her tower, where if they are tempted in they fall to their death. An unidentified woman in a blue hooded cape will not rest till she finds the baby she smothered to death. It is said that the baby was sired by her own father.Anthony D. Hippisley Coxe, Haunted Britain, pg. 27, McGraw-Hill Book Company, New York 1973Peter Underwood, Gazetteer of British Ghosts, pgs. 24-26, Walker and Company, New York 1971 ==Royal associations== Parliament Cottage is a mile away from the village, in Longcombe. This was where William of Orange is said to have held his first Parliament after invading England in 1688. In 2005, Berry Pomeroy revived \\"Queene's Day\\", the anniversary of the accession of Elizabeth the First on 17 November. Celebrations begin with evensong in the parish church and culminate with a bonfire in the adjacent field, upon which is burned an effigy of Satan. ==Parish church== St. Mary's Church, in the village centre, has a rood screen forty-two feet long,Stabb, John Some Old Devon Churches: their rood screens, pulpits, fonts, etc.. 3 vols. London: Simpkin, Marshall, Hamilton, Kent, 1908, 1911, 1916, p. 15 and the stained-glass window dates from the fifteenth century. The rood screen is very unusual in being complete from end to end but also has the original coving, cornice and cresting. The wainscoting has painted figures. Between 1681 and 1834 the village was served by just three vicars: John Prince, John Fox and John Edwards.Mee, Arthur (1965) The King's England: Devon; rev. ed. by E. T. Long. London: Hodder and Stoughton, p. 38 The church was once visited by William III and more recently by the Duke of Kent. American soldiers were stationed in the village in the buildup to D-Day and were billeted in tents opposite the church, in which items of that time are on display. American veterans revisited Berry Pomeroy for the 60th anniversary of the invasion. The church features in the final wedding scene of Ang Lee's 1995 film Sense and Sensibility. Lord Edward Seymour (died 1593) is buried here, along with his son Sir Edward Seymour, 1st Baronet, standing against the north wall of the north aisle of the Seymour Chapel. ==Annual fete== Manor House - Berry Pomeroy. To celebrate the turning of the millennium in 2000, a new bench was erected opposite the War Memorial, and every summer, a fete is held in the grounds of the manor house next to the church, which includes maypole dancing, Devonshire cream teas and a coconut shy. ==Local government== Berry Pomeroy's Parish Council meets at the Village Hall, next to Berry Pomeroy Parochial Primary School.

Agostino Scilla (10 August 1629 ‚Äì 31 May 1700) was an Italian Baroque painter, paleontologist, geologist, numismatist, and a pioneer in the study of fossils and in scientific illustration. He is known for his paintings and also in the history of paleontology for the book La vana speculazione disingannata dal senso (\\"Vain Speculation Undeceived by Sense\\", 1670) which was introduced to English audiences by William Wotton of the Royal Society in 1696. He was among the first to promote a scientific understanding of fossils in contrast to fantastic Biblical and divine interpretations. ==Life== The son of a notary in Messina, Sicily, Scilla studied under Antonio Barbalunga in Messina and Andrea Sacchi in Rome and became a painter. His frescos in Messina were painted for the church of San Domenico, and in the Nunziata de' Teatini, and many paintings including one of San Ilarione dying painted for the church of S. Ursula. His frescos in the Cathedral of Syracuse date from 1657. After participating in an unsuccessful revolt against Spanish rule, in 1678 he was exiled from Sicily. Scilla worked as a painter in Turin and then Rome for the rest of his life. He was a censor in the Academy of Design in Rome in 1695.Il centesimo dell'anno 1695 celebrato in Roma dall'Accademia del Disegno, by Giuseppe Ghezzi, page 5. One of his pupils was the painter Antonio Madiona. ==Works== 223x223px Scilla began to study fossils found in the hills of Sicily, sometimes accompanied by botanist Paolo Boccone. His only written scientific work is La vana speculazione disingannata dal senso (\\"Vain Speculation Undeceived by Sense\\", 1670).Agostino Scilla, La vana speculazione disingannata dal senso, ed. by Marco Segala, Florence: Giunti, 1996. Original edition available on archive.org. The book was dedicated to the Sicilian nobleman Don Carlo di Gregorio, who founded the Accademia della Fucina (1639‚Äì1678) in Messina. In this work Scilla argues for a scientific explanation for fossils, as opposed to them being of fantastic origin or a test of faith from God. He also correctly identified the supposedly magical objects that were called glossopetrae, or \\"tongue stones\\", as the teeth of sharks. He was however not the first to do this. Nicolas Steno had made a similar claim about three years earlier but it is not known if Scilla had seen that work. Fabio Colonna in Dissertatio de glossopetris (1616) had burnt these fossils to show that they were made of lime, organic matter, rather than minerals. The book included 29 drawings of fossils drawn from specimens by him and engraved using copper-plate by Pietro Santi Bartoli. The book was rediscovered by William Wotton of the Royal Society in 1696 and an English summary became widely available. Scilla was apologetic about being but an untrained artist and the style of writing was commented on by Wotton as lacking art. Scilla argued that his training gave him a painter‚Äôs eye with the ability to probe into nature and interpret things better, and depict nature without mediation. Shark teeth and glossopetrae drawn by Scilla Scilla argued that fossils were not lusus naturae, whimsical simulacra of animals and plants created by God or divine Nature. He termed fossils as \\"jokes of time, not of nature.\\" Athanasius Kircher had claimed that inanimate nature could produce pictures and sculptures that resembled living things. Girolamo Cardano claimed in his On the Subtlety of Things (1550) that he owned a piece agate that had the face of the Roman emperor Galba in it. Scilla dismissed Cardano's claim. Scilla may have seen fossil collections in Rome belonging to Cardinal Francesco Barberini (1597‚Äì1679) and his secretary Cassiano dal Pozzo (1588‚Äì1657). Scilla had also been influenced by Giovan Pietro Bellori (1613‚Äì1696) who had lectured on the role of the artist in inquiry. Bellori besought artists to go deep into a subject just as they examined the squaring of the circle and explored anatomy below the skin of the nudes they depicted, as depicted in Carlo Maratta's Tanto che basti (1682). Maratta had been a student of Sacchi alongside Scilla. Scilla gained reputation as a scientific illustrator and worked for Marcello Malpighi. Scilla is considered to have been the first to use dotted lines to indicate reconstructions in paleontological illustration. John Ray made use of some of Scilla's fossil illustrations. Scilla's fossil collection was acquired by John Woodward (1665-1728), an English physician, in 1717. These went into the University of Cambridge and became the nucleus of the collections of the Sedgwick Museum of Earth Sciences. Dorsum Scilla on the Moon is named after him.Romano, Marco, Historical Biology (2013): ‚ÄòThe vain speculation disillusioned by the sense‚Äô: the Italian painter Agostino Scilla (1629‚Äì1700) called ‚ÄòThe Discoloured‚Äô, and the correct interpretation of fossils as ‚Äòlithified organisms‚Äô that once lived in the sea, Historical Biology: An International Journal of Paleobiology, DOI: 10.1080/08912963.2013.825257 == See also == List of Italian painters ==References== ==External links== *La vana speculazione disingannata dal senso (1670) - digital facsimile from the Linda Hall Library * Scan from the Biodiversity Heritage Library on the Internet Archive Category:1629 births Category:1700 deaths Category:17th-century Italian painters Category:Italian male painters Category:Italian Baroque painters Category:Sicilian painters ","title":"Agostino Scilla"},{"id":"3231525","text":"William Francis Brinsley Le Poer Trench, 8th Earl of Clancarty, 7th Marquess of Heusden (18 September 191118 May 1995) was a prominent ufologist. He was an Irish peer, as well as a nobleman in the Dutch nobility. ==Biography== He was the fifth son of William Frederick Le Poer Trench, 5th Earl of Clancarty by Mary Gwatkin Ellis. He had four older half-brothers born to the 5th Earl's first wife, Isabel Maud Penrice Bilton, the actress known as Belle Bilton, who died of cancer in 1906. Brinsley was educated at the Pangbourne Nautical College. From 1956 to 1959 Clancarty edited the Flying Saucer Review and founded the International Unidentified Object Observer Corps. He also found employment selling advertising space for a gardening magazine housed opposite Waterloo station. In 1967, he founded Contact International and served as its first president. He also served as vice-president of the British UFO Research Association (BUFORA). Clancarty was an honorary life member of the now defunct Ancient Astronauts Society which supported the ideas put forward by Erich von D√§niken in his 1968 book Chariots of the Gods?. In 1975 he succeeded to the earldom on the death of his half-brother, Grenville Sydney Rocheforte, 7th Earl of Clancarty, giving him a seat in the British Parliament. He used his new position to found a UFO Study Group at the House of Lords, introducing Flying Saucer Review to its library and pushing for the declassification of UFO data. Four years later he organised a celebrated debate in the House of Lords on UFOs which attracted many speeches on both sides of the question. In one debate, Lord Strabolgi, for the Government, declared that there was nothing to convince him that any alien spacecraft had ever visited the Earth. ==Private life== Clancarty first married, in 1940, Diana (1919‚Äì1999), daughter of Sir William Younger, Bt. This marriage was dissolved in 1947. He married secondly, in 1961, Mrs Wilma Belknap (n√©e Vermilyea) (1915‚Äì1995) and that marriage was dissolved in 1969. His third marriage was in 1974, to Mrs Mildred Allewyn Spong (n√©e Bensusan) (1895‚Äì1975). She died in 1975 but Clancarty remarried a fourth time, in 1976, to Mrs May Beasley (n√©e Radonicich) (1904‚Äì2003). He lived most of his life in South Kensington and died in Bexhill-on-Sea in 1995, leaving his extensive collection of papers to Contact International. He was succeeded to the earldom by his nephew Nicholas Le Poer Trench (b. 1952). ==Hollow Earth theory== In 1974, Trench published Secret of the Ages: UFOs from Inside the Earth, a book which theorised that the centre of the Earth was hollow, with entrances to its interior located at both the north and south polar areas. The interior, he suggested, consisted of large tunnel systems connecting a large cavern world. Trench also believed that the lost continent of Atlantis actually once existed and that these tunnels were probably constructed all over the world by the Atlanteans, for various purposes. Trench believed that there was no actual North Pole, but instead a large area with a warm sea dipping gradually into the interior of the Earth. He said that humans were 'living on the deck of a ship, unaware of the life going on under our feet'. One argument he put forward for this theory was that whilst the Earth is spherical, it is flattened at the poles. Additionally, he questioned how all icebergs could be composed of frozen fresh water, if no rivers were flowing from the inside of the Earth to the outside. He had also suggested that a large proportion of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) emanated from the Earth's interior. These objects were likely to have been created by a group of much more technically advanced beings, similar to humans, but a group that likely possessed extrasensory abilities, as well as the ability to manipulate psychic phenomena. Another argument for the Hollow Earth theory was that everything, he suggested, including nebulae, comets and planets, is hollow and these conditions would certainly prove favourable for a hollow Earth. Whilst Trench had in one of his earlier books disregarded the Hollow Earth theory, he admitted to at the time 'being educated along with millions of other people to believe that the Earth had a liquid molten core'. ==Other claims== According to Trench in his book The Sky People, Adam and Eve, Noah and many of the other characters from the Bible originally lived on Mars. Trench believed that Adam and Eve were experimental creations of extraterrestrials.Lost Lands, Forgotten Realms: Sunken Continents, Vanished Cities, and the Kingdoms that History Misplaced, Bob Curran, 2009, p. 31 His claim was that the Biblical description of the Garden of Eden was inconsistent with what was on Earth and as Mars contained canals, that the Garden of Eden must have been located on Mars. He further claimed that the north polar ice cap melted on Mars, and this caused the descendants of Adam and Eve to move to Earth.The Book Of Lists: The Original Compendium of Curious Information, David Wallechinsky, 2005, p. 311 Atlantis Rising, Brad Steiger, Dell Pub. Co., 1973, p. 198 Trench also claimed to know a former U.S. test pilot who said he was one of six persons present at a meeting between President Eisenhower and a group of aliens, which allegedly took place at Edwards Air Force Base on 4 April 1954. Clancarty reported that the test pilot told him \\"Five different alien craft landed at the base. Three were saucer-shaped and two were cigar shaped... the aliens looked something like humans, but not exactly.\\"[Source: Ruth Montgomery's \\"Aliens Among Us\\" Putnam, 1985 p. 227] He claimed that he could trace his descent from 63,000 BC, when beings from other planets had landed on Earth in spaceships.Curing Hiccups with Small Fires: A Delightful Miscellany of Great British Eccentrics, Karl Shaw, 2009, p. 105 ==Bibliography== * The Sky People (1960) * Men Among Mankind (1962) * Forgotten Heritage (1964) * The Flying Saucer Story (1966) * Operation Earth (1969) * The Eternal Subject (1973) * Secret of the Ages: UFO's from Inside the Earth (1974). * Reptiles from the Internal World (1979) * China in the Closet: A Romantic Mystery (1981) * Egos and Sub-Egos (1983) * UFOs: Just Shiny Birds? with Anna Robb (1984). ==References== ==External links== * Category:1911 births Category:1995 deaths Category:Dutch nobility Category:Hollow Earth proponents Category:Marquess of Heusden Category:Pseudohistorians Category:Atlantis proponents Category:Ancient astronauts proponents Category:Ufologists Brinsley Category:20th-century historians Category:Earls of Clancarty ","title":"Brinsley Le Poer Trench, 8th Earl of Clancarty"},{"id":"3231526","text":"Kinnettles Parish Kirk Kinnettles House Kinnettles is located in Angus, a Council Area in the northeast of Scotland.

Some 4,000 volunteers, mostly Jews but also non-Jews, arrived from all over the world.Benny Morris, 1948: A History of the First Arab-Israeli War, 2008, p.85.Not home alone: Foreigners came to Israel's rescue in 1948, Haaretz June 15, 2012 Mahal is an acronym of (Mitnadvei Hutz LaAretz, \\"volunteers from abroad\\"). Mahal was disbanded after the war and most of the volunteers went home, although some remained in the country as permanent residents. ==History== Many members of Mahal were World War II veterans from United States and British Armed Forces. Allied armies were reduced considerably after the end of the war and many soldiers were demobilised; moreover, the service experience became mundane and did not suit some servicemen, particularly pilots. In various circumstances they were invited, or heard of the Jewish state's struggle for independence and volunteered. In some cases those who enlisted had no prior military experience. Nir Arielli (2014), There were Jews and Christians, both ideological supporters of Zionism and mercenaries. The Ha'apala movement, also called \\"Aliyah Bet\\", which attempted to evade the 1939 and 1948 British naval blockade restricting Jewish immigration to Palestine, was assisted by 236 Machal former servicemen of the Allied navies as crews of ten clandestine Jewish refugee ships, out of sixty-six participating vessels. The 1948 Arab-Israeli War saw approximately 3500 foreign volunteers from 58 countries among the Jewish forces, out of an estimated 29,677‚Äì108,300 total (it grew considerably in size due to increasing levels of militarisation). A total of 123 Mahalniks were killed in battle (119 men and 4 women). One of the most famous Machal volunteers was Mickey Marcus, a Jewish United States Army colonel who became Israel's first aluf (brigadier general). Marcus' wartime experience was vital in the 1948 Battle for Jerusalem. Other important Mahalniks were Canadian officer Ben Dunkelman and U.S. pilot Milton Rubenfeld, and Major Wellesley Aron, an English-born Palestinian Jew who had commanded a unit in the British Army during World War II. In 1947, while on a lecture tour of the United States, he was requested by the Haganah to organize the recruitment of men with \\"know-how\\" who could help in defending the newly established state. ==Aid to Israeli Air Force== The largest presence of Mahal was felt in the Israeli Air Force (IAF), making up nearly two-thirds of its personnel, to the point that English overtook Hebrew as the most widely used operational IAF service language.Of the roughly 600 soldiers serving as the aircrew of the newly formed IAF, over 400 were volunteers from overseas. Inscription on Mahal memorial in Israel Cargo flights flown by Mahal air crews transported weapons and supplies to Palestine from Europe, and thousands of Jewish refugees from Arab countries. During the Egyptian Army siege of the Negev region in 1948, Mahal pilots airlifted thousands of tons of supplies to communities behind enemy lines, usually by night landings of large cargo planes and converted airliners on makeshift, unpaved sand runways, hand lit by oil lamps. The national Israeli airline El Al was partially founded by Mahal veterans. The integration of Mahal personnel into the Israel Defense Forces did not proceed without difficulty. Occasional tensions surfaced due to the superior pay and service conditions demanded by and given to the volunteers over resident or native Israeli soldiers, mainly in the air force; some of the volunteers were adventurers with little commitment to Zionism or to a rigid, disciplined hierarchy. This culminated in the disbandment of the Air Transport Division, following an \\"industrial action\\" by its Mahal personnel over pay conditions. The division was re- established with Israeli personnel. Logistic support of the founding of the IAF was provided by various diaspora groups which procured planes in the critical months of 1948-9. One important such activity in Australia led to the export to Israel of six planes, despite the arms blockade enforced only against Israel amongst the combatants. A few hours before the final cease-fire on 7 January 1949, a flight of four British RAF Spitfires bypassed the southern Israeli border on a reconnaissance flight. They were attacked by a pair of Israeli Air Force Spitfires, resulting in three of the British planes being shot down. The Israeli Spitfires were flown by Mahal volunteers \\"Slick\\" Goodlin (USA) and John McElroy (Canada). Both were former US Army Air Forces and Royal Canadian Air Force pilots, veterans of World War II. ==Legacy and commemoration== Mahal Street, Jerusalem After the end of the war in 1949, the majority of the Mahal returned to their home countries. Some remained to live in Israel; the village of Kfar Daniel near Lod was founded by Mahal veterans from North America and the United Kingdom. Then Prime Minister David Ben- Gurion said \\"the Mahal Forces were the Diaspora's most important contribution to the survival of the State of Israel.\\" A memorial honoring the Mahal volunteers was erected near Sha'ar HaGai on the road from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. On it is inscribed a verse from : \\"All those of valour shall pass armed among your brethren, and shall help them.\\"Jerusalem Memorial to Machal, the Foreign Volunteers who helped found Israel during the War of Independence. Over the years, changing road configurations made accessibility to the Sha'ar HaGai memorial obscure with a corresponding, significant, drop off in visitation. Contemporary awareness of the vital role of Mahal in the birth of Israel diminished. The Jewish American Society for Historic Preservation recognized the problem and the necessity for historical memory. December 2017, a new Mahal memorial was dedicated on Mahal street in Jerusalem directly across from Jerusalem's Ammunition Hill Museum to the Battle of Ammunition Hill during the Six Days War.http://www.jewish-american-society-for-historic- preservation.org/internationalprograms/machalmemorialisrael.htmlhttps://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293983-d19865393-Reviews- Machal_Memorial- Jerusalem_Jerusalem_District.html#photos;aggregationId=&albumid;=&filter;=7&ff;=445825164https://www.jpost.com/diaspora/jerusalem- monument-to-be-dedicated-to-machal-517548 The memorial, funded by the Jewish American Society for Historic Preservation, and the American Veterans of Israel Legacy Corporationhttps://www.facebook.com/avilegacy/, was designed by noted Israeli artist Sam Philipe. The Memorial is a massive relief boulder symbolizing Mahal as one of the foundational rocks in the birth of Israel. Mounted on the boulder are bronze sculpted symbols of branches of the Israel Defense Forces that Mahal contributed to, Air Force, Army, and Navy. The new Mahal memorial, with its interpretive historical signage, is seen by hundreds of thousands of visitors a year.http://www.jewish-american-society-for- historic- preservation.org/images/From_the_Old_Maccabees_to_the_New_Maccabees.pdf ==Volunteer programs today== Overseas residents can serve in the IDF through various volunteer programs which are for young non-Israelis of Jewish background who are legal residents in Israel (and descendants of a Jewish grandparent) and overseas Israelis who are younger than 24 (men), 21 (women), 36 (physicians). The programs consist typically of 18 months of IDF service (21 months, if IDF-Hebrew study program, or ulpan, is necessary) including extended training for those joining combat units or 1 month of non-combat training. All overseas volunteers serve in regular Israeli military units. Sar-El is another IDF volunteer program open to Jews and non-Jews which focuses on non-combat support. ==Notable Mahal members== *Chalmers Goodlin *Paul Kor *Mickey Marcus *Tom Derek Bowden ==See also== * Foreign Legion * George Beurling * Lone soldier * Garin Tzabar *Above and Beyond, a 2014 documentary film about the Mahal ==References== ==Further reading== * ==External links== * FOCUS on Israel: MACHAL - Overseas Volunteers Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs * Machal and Aliyah Bet Virtual museum * Machal veterans association * Books by and on Machal Pilots, Multimedia files * Spitfire vs Spitfire ‚Äî Air Combat between the Israeli Air Force and the RAF * Mahal IDF Volunteers: Guide & Assistant * Machal Museum * World Machal website * Garin Mahal website * Above and Beyond: The Birth of the Israeli Air Force Sample Reel * Guide to the Records of MACHAL (Mitnadvei Hutz LaAretz) and Aliyah Bet at the American Jewish Historical Society, New York, NY *Teddy Eitan (Thad√©e Diffre), non-Jewish volunteer from France Category:1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War Category:Expatriate units and formations Category:Israel Defense Forces ","title":"Mahal (Israel)"},{"id":"3231529","text":"Three's Co. is the third album by American indie rock band The Tyde, released in 2006. \\"Three's Co.\\" has been greeted with critical acclaim, including the NME who rated it 8/10, calling it, \\"beach-pop that Brian Wilson might have sounded like if he'd listened obsessively to '80s indie legends Felt while he was playing in his sandpit.\\" Spin Magazine has praised the album's \\"bright anxious pop-rock melodies that pulse with a geeky charm\\" (3 stars).

Caspar Georg Carl Reinwardt (5 June 1773 in L√ºttringhausen - 6 March 1854 in Leiden) was a Prussian-born Dutch botanist. He is considered to be the founding father of Bogor Botanical Garden in Indonesia. == Biography == Lithograph of Lily pond and fountain at the Bogor Botanical Gardens, 1880s Photograph of Lily pond and fountain at the Bogor Botanical Gardens, 2014 In 1787 he was apprenticed to an Amsterdam pharmacy where his brother worked. He came in contact with several scientists, including the botanist Gerardus Vrolik (father of Willem Vrolik). He had his education at the Athenaeum Illustre where he successfully engaged in the study chemistry and botany. Under the Batavian Republic and the Kingdom of Holland he served as a professor of natural history at the University of Harderwijk from 1800 to 1808. After a while he became associate professor of chemistry and pharmacy. In 1808 he appealed to king Louis Bonaparte and was offered work as director of the \\"to be built\\" botanical and zoological gardens and museums. In 1808 he became a member of the Royal Institute of the Netherlands. And in 1810 just before the annexation of the Kingdom of Holland by the French Empire, he became professor of natural history in Amsterdam. After the restoration of independence in 1813 and of its colonial empire in 1816, the Netherlands was eager to re-establish contact with its colonies. In 1816 he was offered a position as head of agriculture, arts and science of the colony, and journeyed to the Dutch East Indies where he conducted various botanical investigations throughout the archipelago. Reinwardt was the founder (1817) and first director of the botanical gardens at Bogor (then called Buitenzorg) in Java. There he gathered and cultivated various flora from the surrounding islands such as the Moluccas, Timor and Sulawesi.ADB: Reinwardt, Kaspar George Karl @ Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie Reinwardt also undertook several expeditions to collect plants that were sent to the Hortus Botanicus Leiden. However, not many of these plants survived the journey from Java to the Netherlands. He remained as director of the Botanical Gardens until 1821 and spent most of his time gathering tropical plants. He returned to the Netherlands in 1822 and became a professor of natural history at the University of Leiden in 1823, where he devoted his life to chemistry, botany and mineralogy.BHL Taxonomic literature : a selective guide to botanical publications Reinwardt also studied amphibians and reptiles, describing two new species of snakes, Laticauda semifasciata and Xenopeltis unicolor.\\"Reinwardt\\". The Reptile Database. www.reptile-database.org. In 1831 Reinwardt published a catalog of the plants growing in the Leiden Hortus. He counted exactly 5,600 species and varieties, an increase of nearly 600 since 1822. In particular, the numbers of Australian, Chinese and Japanese plants had increased. This increase in number of varieties was largely contributed by Philipp Franz von Siebold who sent many plants to the Hortus Botanicus in Leiden. Reinwardt finally retired as a professor in 1845 and died nine years later. He was succeeded by Willem Hendrik de Vriese.

Email clients include smartphones and, less strictly, IMAP personal computer mail applications. == Comparison with polling email == Outgoing mail is generally pushed from the sender to the final mail delivery agent (and possibly via intermediate mail servers) using Simple Mail Transfer Protocol. If the receiver uses a polling email delivery protocol, the final step from the last mail delivery agent to the client is done using a poll. Post Office Protocol (POP3) is an example of a polling email delivery protocol. At login and later at intervals, the mail user agent (client) polls the mail delivery agent (server) to see if there is new mail, and if so downloads it to a mailbox on the user's computer. Extending the \\"push\\" to the last delivery step is what distinguishes push email from polling email systems. The reason that polling is often used for the last stage of mail delivery is that, although the server mail delivery agent would normally be permanently connected to the network, it does not necessarily know how to locate the client mail user agent, which may only be connected occasionally and also change network address quite often. For example, a user with a laptop on a Wi-Fi connection may be assigned different addresses from the network DHCP server periodically and have no persistent network name. When new mail arrives to the mail server, it does not know what address the client is currently assigned. The Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) provides support for polling and notifications. When a client receives a notification from a server, the client may choose to fetch the new data from the server. This makes retrieval of new messages more flexible than a purely push system, because the client can choose whether to download new message data. == Mobile users == Although push email had existed in wired-based systems for many years, one of the first uses of the system with a portable, \\"always on\\" wireless device outside Asia was the BlackBerry service from Research In Motion. In Japan, \\"push email\\" has been standard in cell phones since 2000. === iOS === Apple's iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch support Hotmail push email. Until early 2013, they supported Gmail push email (via Google Sync) and Microsoft's Exchange ActiveSync platform, allowing them to synchronize email, calendars and contacts with mail servers.Corporate E-mail Coming to iPhone - Look Out BlackBerry! - Switched Apple's iCloud service offers support for push email, contacts, and calendars,Apple Introduces MobileMe Internet Service . although as of the 24 February 2012, this has been temporarily disabled in Germany due to lawsuits.Apple halts \\"push\\" email services in Germany However, by setting up a new account using IMAP IDLE, push email is restored. === Android === Android's built-in Gmail client uses Google Cloud Messaging to push email for Gmail accounts set up to sync with the phone. Android also supports Microsoft Exchange accounts natively through its default mail application. When \\"Push\\" is configured, emails arriving into the Microsoft Exchange inbox are instantly pushed to the device. Calendar events sync both ways between Exchange and the device. Yahoo Mail may be pushed to an Android device, as Android now supports IMAP4 (as of September 2015). An alternative for Yahoo Mail is to install the free Yahoo Mail app, which provides instant push email. Numerous Yahoo users have complained that push does not function reliably; Yahoo has attributed this to server issues rather than the Smartphone app. In 2010 Hotmail, and its replacement, Outlook.com, have been made push configurable for Android smartphones through the default mail application. === Windows Mobile and Windows Phone === Microsoft began offering real-time email notification with Windows Mobile 2003 (sending SMS messages when new mail arrived), then replaced it with a simulated push experience (long polling) in 2007 with the release of Windows Mobile 5 AKU2Mobile- review.com under the name \\"Direct Push Technology\\". 'Direct Push' technology is an additional feature added to Microsoft Exchange 2003 with service pack 2 that adds messaging and security features. A phone device running Windows Mobile 5 is enabled to poll the Exchange Server every 30 minutes. If new mail arrives in the polling interval, it is instantly pulled, using a subscriber's existing wireless phone account. This allows the device to have a changing IP or to traverse NAT/Proxy. === Nokia Symbian Series 60 === Some Nokia Symbian S60 models support basic IMAP IDLE functionality with its built-in client. But on newer E72, E52 etc. phones this functionality is broken, because connection to the mail server is closed (probably even outside the mailing application) and never restored. ==== Nokia Mail for Exchange ==== The Nokia asha smartphones and select models of Nseries smartphones and newer s60 and Symbian^3 handsets running symbian os 9.x or Symbian^3 support the Mail for Exchange software, which is compatible with Microsoft Exchange Server Active Sync and Direct Push, allowing the Nokia smartphones to receive push email as well as sync contact lists, calendars, and tasks with Exchange servers. Global Address Lookup is also supported, starting with version 2 of the Mail for Exchange software.Nokia - Mail for Exchange ==== Nokia Messaging ==== Nokia Messaging Email is a push email service and client application that supports most of the popular email providers like Windows Live Hotmail, Yahoo! Mail, Gmail and many more. Nokia Messaging servers aggregate messages from up to ten accounts on and pushes them to compliant devices (Nokia S60 and some S40, plus Maemo-based devices like the N900).Nokia - Nokia Email service Nokia - Nokia Email application As of August 2012 Nokia Messaging Email is in the process of being phased out.Nokia Support Discussions - Re: Unable to connect with the information provide... - Page 2 - Nokia Support Discussions === Palm OS === Palm Smartphone devices have had IMAP IDLEPalm.com available through the use of 3rd Party software ChatterEmail as early as 2004. There is no additional server software required. === Palm webOS === The Palm Pre webOS has push email for Gmail, IMAP, and Exchange accounts. === BlackBerry === BlackBerry uses wireless mail user agent devices and a BlackBerry Enterprise Server (BES) attached to a traditional email system. The BES monitors the email server, and when it sees new email for a BlackBerry user, it retrieves (pulls) a copy and then pushes it to the BlackBerry handheld device over the wireless network. BlackBerry became very popular, in part because it offers remote users \\"instant\\" email; new emails appear on the device as soon as they arrive, without the need for any user intervention. The handheld becomes a mobile, dynamically updating, copy of the user's mailbox. As a result of the success of BlackBerry, other manufacturers have developed push email systems for other handheld devices, such as Symbian- and Windows Mobile-based mobile phones. However, they only support push email for some email services. With the release of the BlackBerry 10 operating system for its new generation of mobile device, BES is no longer available for non-corporate client email delivery. Instead, BlackBerry 10 offers POP, IMAP, or ActiveSync for transferring email to and from a device. Of these, the latter two can provide push email delivery if the server supports it. Data compression is also not provided anymore. === Sony Ericsson === Sony Ericsson Smartphones (M600, P990, W950, P1, W960, W995, G900, G700) as well as some Cybershot phones (K790, K800, K810, K850, C510, C905,J105i) feature push email using IMAP IDLE or with the built-in ActiveSync client (developed by Dataviz). Most other Sony Ericsson phones support IMAP IDLE push email quite well (only the inbox however). === Other mobile solutions === Most non-proprietary solutions are network independent, meaning that as long as a device is data-enabled and has an email client, it will have the ability to send/receive emails in any country and via any telephone company that has data service on its network. It also means that as long as the device is not SIM locked (in the case of GSM systems), the constraints of BlackBerry, such as network locking, vendor locking (BlackBerry devices and BlackBerry Connect devices) and data-roaming charges (for non-home access) are not an issue. For a GSM system, install a SIM card appropriate for the location, have the correct APN settings and one's mail will be delivered at local rates. == Simulation using traditional email == Traditional mobile mail clients may poll for new mail at frequent intervals, with or without downloading the mail to the client, thus providing a similar user experience as push email. IMAP allows many notifications to be sent at any time, but not message data. The IDLE command is often used to signal the ability of a client to process notifications sent outside of a running command, which effectively provides a user experience identical to push. == Protocols == In contrast to traditional email, most of the protocols used in popular current systems are proprietary. For example, BlackBerry uses its own private protocols. Both the Push-IMAP standard and parts of the SyncML standards are attempting to develop more open solutions. IETF Lemonade is a set of extensions to IMAP and SMTP to make them more suited to the demands of mobile email. Among the extensions are rapid IMAP resynchronization and a new NOTIFY command in IMAP. == References == Email Category:Wireless email ","title":"Push email"},{"id":"3231544","text":"William Montgomery Watt (14 March 1909 ‚Äì 24 October 2006) was a Scottish Orientalist, historian, academic and Anglican priest. From 1964 to 1979, he was Professor of Arabic and Islamic studies at the University of Edinburgh. Watt was one of the foremost non-Muslim interpreters of Islam in the West, and according to Carole Hillenbrand \\"an enormously influential scholar in the field of Islamic studies and a much-revered name for many Muslims all over the world\\". Watt's comprehensive biography of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, Muhammad at Mecca (1953) and Muhammad at Medina (1956), are considered to be classics in the field. ==Early life and education== Watt was born on 14 March 1909 in Ceres, Fife, Scotland. His father, who died when he was only 14 months old, was a minister of the Church of Scotland. ==Career== ===Ordained ministry=== Watt was ordained in the Scottish Episcopal Church as a deacon in 1939 and as a priest in 1940. He served his curacy at St Mary The Boltons, West Brompton, in the Diocese of London from 1939 to 1941. When St Mary's was damaged in The Blitz, he moved to Old Saint Paul's, Edinburgh to continue his training. From 1943 to 1946, he served as an Arabic specialist to the Anglican Bishop of Jerusalem. After Watt returned to academia in 1946, he never again held a full-time religious appointment. He did, however, continue his ministry with part-time and honorary positions. From 1946 to 1960, he was an honorary curate at Old Saint Paul's, Edinburgh, an Anglo-Catholic church in Edinburgh. He became a member of the ecumenical Iona Community in Scotland in 1960. From 1960 to 1967, he was an honorary curate at St Columba's-by-the-Castle, near Edinburgh Castle. Between 1980 and 1993, following his retirement from academia, he was an honorary curate at St Mary the Virgin, Dalkeith and at St Leonard's Church, Lasswade. ===Academic career=== Watt was Professor of Arabic and Islamic Studies at the University of Edinburgh from 1964‚Äì79. He has been called \\"the Last Orientalist\\".Interview: William Montgomery Watt Watt held visiting professorships at the University of Toronto, the Coll√®ge de France, and Georgetown University ==Later life== Watt died in Edinburgh on 24 October 2006 at the age of 97.The Herald, The Scotsman, The Times, 27 October 2006 ==Honours== Watt received the American Giorgio Levi Della Vida Medal and won, as its first recipient, the British Society for Middle Eastern Studies award for outstanding scholarship. Watt received an Honorary Doctorate from Aberdeen University. ==Views== Watt believed that the Qur'an was divinely inspired but not infallibly true. Martin Forward, a 21st-century non-Muslim Islamic scholar, states: Carole Hillenbrand, a professor of Islamic History at the University of Edinburgh, states: His account of the origin of Islam met with criticism from other scholars such as John Wansbrough of the University of London's School of Oriental and African Studies, and Patricia Crone and Michael Cook, in their book Hagarism: The Making of the Islamic World (1977), and Crone's Meccan Trade and the Rise of Islam.Patricia Crone, Meccan Trade and the Rise of Islam, Princeton University Press. 1987 However, Both Patricia Crone and Michael Cook have later suggested that the central thesis of the book \\"Hagarism\\" was mistaken because the evidence they had to support the thesis was not sufficient or internally consistent enough. ==Criticism== Pakistani academic, Zafar Ali Qureshi, in his book, Prophet Muhammad and His Western Critics: A Critique of W. Montgomery Watt and Others has criticized Watt as having incorrectly portrayed the life of Muhammad in his works. Qureshi's book was praised by Turkish academic ƒ∞brahim Kalƒ±n, and has been seen by its proponents as an attempt at countering Orientalist bias, inaccuracies and distortion. Georges-Henri Bousquet has mocked Watt's book, Muhammad at Mecca, describing it as \\"A Marxist interpretation of the origins of Islam by an Episcopal clergyman.\\" ==Selected works== * The faith and practice of al-GhazƒÅlƒ´ (1953) * Muhammad at Mecca (1953) * Muhammad at Medina (1956) (online) * Muhammad: Prophet and Statesman (1961) , a summary of the above two major works (online) * Islamic Philosophy and Theology (1962) * Islamic Political Thought (1968) * Islamic Surveys: The Influence of Islam on Medieval Europe (1972) * The Majesty That Was Islam (1976) * What Is Islam?

The village lies immediately to the south of the A27 road between Lewes and Polegate, about three miles (4.8 km) west of the latter. The parish is located in the River Cuckmere floodplain, north of the South Downs.'' The place-name 'Berwick' is here first attested in the Domesday Book of 1086, where it appears as Berewice. The name means 'corn farm'.Eilert Ekwall, Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Place-names, p.39. There are two public houses in the parish: the Berwick Inn near the railway station, and The Cricketers, in the village itself. The village also has an example of a \\"K6\\" red telephone box. ==Berwick Church== The chancel arch, St Michael and All Angels, Berwick Part of the United Benefice of Arlington, Berwick, Selmeston-with-Alciston and Wilmington, the church dedicated to St Michael and All Angels, is a Grade 1 listed building. Built on what may be a pre-Christian sacred site, the church dates back at least to the 12th century, although the Saxon frontage appears to be earlier. Additions were made in the 14th century, and a tower built in 1603, originally with a spire. The building suffered in the 18th century, losing its spire to lightning on 8 August 1773. Several Victorian leaded windows were damaged by World War II bombs on 17 October 1944. They were replaced by clear glass, unusual in churches, for fear of further damage. However, some of the church's stained-glass windows survived. The clear-glass windows help to illuminate the church's unique murals. Partly inspired by the pre-Reformation practice of decorating churches with murals, these were painted in 1941 by Duncan Grant, Vanessa Bell, and Quentin Bell, of the Bloomsbury Group. The murals depict local people, sometimes in period clothes, but set in biblical scenes. ==Berwick Station== Berwick Station is a small settlement that has grown up around Berwick railway station. Located about two miles (3.2 km) north of the main village of Berwick, Berwick Station includes a garage, a small shop and a pub called the Berwick Inn (previously The Fullers' Arms). The Vanguard Way, which links Croydon and Newhaven, runs through the village. Berwick railway station lies on the East Coastway Line between Glynde and Polegate railway stations. ==Berwick industry== The Ludlay Brick and Tile Company comprised a clay pit and a brick-works. The works was established by 1880 and was close to Berwick Church. The two were linked by a 2' gauge tramway. Until about 1950 bricks were only made during the summer because it was not possible to dry them in winter. Some work was done during winter, digging clay and piling it up to 'weather'. The works closed in 1965 and remained derelict for over 20 years. ==Long distance walks and countryside== The Vanguard Way, a long-distance walk, goes through the village, and the South Downs Way passes along the Downs just above it. Walkers often stop and travel down into the village. A common walk in this area is to start at the village car park, walk down the road known as The Village, past Church Farm and the tyre heap, and on to the dilapidated New Barn, just a few years ago an important store for hay from the surrounding fields, but now falling apart. This building is made of attractive red-rusting iron and next to it is an old stone farmhouse - currently unused and overgrown with plants, but in good condition, it is home to wood warblers in the summer and grey wagtails often feed by it. The hedgerows in this area are excellent for bird life and a lot of rabbits can be seen hopping around. Walks can continue from the New Barn up along a shaded avenue to a large hedgerow full of blackberries in autumn. From here there is a winding path up onto the Downs and this is where the walker meets the South Downs Way. One can then continue into Alfriston. The area at the end of this walk is home to red foxes. ==References== ==External links== Category:Villages in East Sussex Category:Civil parishes in East Sussex Category:Wealden ","title":"Berwick, East Sussex"},{"id":"3231562","text":"A distinction is made between Greek gardens, made in ancient Greece, and Hellenistic gardens, made under the influence of Greek culture in late classical times. Little is known about either. ==Minoan gardens== Before the coming of Proto-Greeks into the Aegean, Minoan culture represented gardens, in the form of subtly tamed wild-seeming landscapes, shown in frescoes, notably in a stylised floral sacred landscape with some Egyptianising features represented in fragments of a Middle Minoan fresco at Amnisos, northeast of Knossos.Maria C. Shaw, \\"The Aegean Garden\\" American Journal of Archaeology 97.4 (October 1993:661-685); see also J. Sch√§fer, \\"The role of 'gardens' in Minoan civilisation\\", in V. Karageorghis, The Civilisations of the Aegean and their diffusion in Cyprus and the eastern Mediterranean 2000-600 B.C. (Larnaca, 1992:85-87). In the east wing of the palace at Phaistos, Maria Shaw believes, fissures and tool-trimmed holes may once have been planted. In the post-Minoan world, Mycenaean art concentrates on human interactions, where the natural world takes a lessened role,\\"Mycenaean art of the later Bronze Age (Late Helladic III) plays a lesser role in my considerations, largely because it copies from earlier art and because its themes are concerned more with people and their actions than with nature\\" (Shaw 1993:662). and following the collapse of Mycenaean palace-culture and the loss of the literacy connected with it, pleasure gardens are unlikely to have been a feature of the Greek Dark Age. ==Literature== In the eighth century BC, the works of Homer contain a reference to gardens, the Neverland of Alcinous, in the purely mythic Phaeacia, which stood as much apart from the known world of Homer's hearers as it did from the heroic world of Achaeans he was recreating, with much poetic license:M.I. Finley, The World of Odysseus (1954, 1965) examines the created cultural world of the epic tradition, which Finley sees as neither authentically Mycenaean nor an accurate reflection of Homer's eighth century BCE. \\"We live far off\\", said Nausicaa, \\"surrounded by the stormy sea, the outermost of men, and no other mortals have dealing with us.\\"Odyssey VI. 205. > \\"Now, you'll find a splendid grove along the road‚Äî > poplars, sacred to Pallas‚Äî > a bubbling spring's inside and meadows run around it. > There lies my father's estate,his blossoming orchard too, > as far from town as a man's strong shout can carry. > Take a seat there\\"Robert Fagles' translation; \\"town\\" is Fagles' license: no > such settlement was known to Homer's hearers. The gardens of the palace were possessed of an unearthly lushness, in the fenced orchard outside the courtyard, fronting the high gates: > \\"Here luxuriant trees are always in their prime > pomegranates and pears, and apples glowing red, > succulent figs and olives swelling sleek and dark. > And the yield of all these trees will never flag or die, > neither in winter nor in summer, a harvest all year round.\\"Robert Fagles' > translation, p. 183. The description is beloved of writers on gardens, nevertheless.It is quoted by Dorothy Burr Thompson and Ralph E. Griswold, Garden Lore of Ancient Athens (American School of Classical Studies at Athens, 1963), p. 5: \\"In it flourish tall trees: pears and pomegranates and apples full of fruit, also sweet figs and bounteous olives...Here too a fertile vineyard has been planted...Beyond the last row of trees, well laid garden plots have been arranged, blooming all the year with flowers. And there are two springs; one leads through the garden while the other dives beneath the threshold of the great court to gush out beside the stately palace; from it the citizens draw their water\\" Poetic descriptions of the Greek landscape and flora are well known from early times - the tale of Narcissus, Daphne's transformation into a lauren, oaks inhabited by dryads and streams with nymphs, and Persephone eating pomegranate seeds, but it's not until the Hellenistic era that gardeners write treatises on their work call kepourika. No such gardens were known to Homer's contemporaries, as far as archaeologists can discern, any more than palaces like Alcinous', whose very doors were of bronze. The gardens of Greek myth were untended gardens,Noted by Thacker, p. 9. maintained in orderly fashion simply because order, themis, was in the nature of things, as in the garden of the Hesperides, which was an orchard. ==Classical Greece== Archaeologists have not identified planted courtyards within the palaces of Mycenean culture nor in Greek houses of the Classical period. When the editors of a symposium on Roman gardensElizabeth B. Macdougall and h Wilhelmina Jashemski, eds. Ancient Roman Gardens (series Colloquia on the History of Landscape Architecture 7), Dumbarton Oaks, 1981). included a contribution on the expected Greek precursors, Brunilde Sismondo Ridgway's article prompted a reviewerNorman Neuerburg, in 'Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians 42.2 (May 1983:200); Neuerburg's summary: \\"To this reviewer even the Greek antecedents scarcely explain the subsequent Roman development of the art of the decorative garden.\\" to observe, \\"For all practical purposes there appear to have been no gardens of any sort in Greek city homes, beyond perhaps a few pots with plants.\\" Aside from vegetable plots and orchards, Ridgway found some literary and a small amount of archaeological evidence for public, or semi-public gardens linked to sanctuaries. In fifth- and fourth-century Athens, some public places were planted with trees,Trees that were landmarks mentioned in inscriptions are briefly noted by Thompson and Griswold 1963, p. 9. as Plato directed in his Laws, \\"The fountains of water, whether of rivers or springs, shall be ornamented with plantings and buildings for beauty\\", though he does not offer details. Temple of Hephaestus, Athens, replanted with myrtle and pomegranates in the 3rd-century planting pits In 1936, the surroundings of the Temple of Hephaestus at Athens were excavated to bare rock, in which rectangular planting pits were identified, which ran round three sides of the temple but not across its front and were lined up with the columns of the temple. In their bases were the shattered remains of flower pots in which layered stems had been rooted; however, associated coins show that the first of these plantings had been made not before the third century BC.Thompson and Griswold 1963, p. 10 and illustrations. The planting was restored with myrtle and pomegranates. By that time, in mainland Greece and Ionia, the influence of Achaemenid Persia was paramount in humanly-tended gardens, but in the previous century, of Alexander the Great, Plutarch observedPlutarch, Moralia, 342b, noted by Julian Reade, \\"Alexander the Great and the Hanging Gardens of Babylon\\", Iraq 62 (2000:195-217) p. 195 that as a boy he would inquire of Persian visitors to his father's court in Macedon, about Persian roads and military organization, but never of the Hanging Gardens of Babylon; Herodotus, who probably visited Babylon in the mid-fifth century, does not mention the hanging gardens.Herodotus and Xenophon (in his romanticised Cyropaedia) do give extensive accounts of Cyrus the Great's palatial city of Pasargadae and its gardens. Xenophon, under Achaemenid Persian influence,In his Anabasis, Xenophon introduced into Greek the Old Persian term for an enclosed royal hunting park, paradeisos. planted a grove upon his return to Athens. The myth, set in Macedon, of Silenus discovered drunken by Midas can be dated to the Hellenistic period simply from its setting, a rose garden. In Athens, the first private pleasure gardens appear in literary sources in the fourth century.Christopher Thacker, The History of Gardens p. 18, notes the Academy, the gardens of Theophrastus and of Epicurus. The Academy had its site in an ancient grove of plane trees sacred to an obscure archaic hero, Akademos. Sacred groves were never actively planted, but simply existed from time immemorial and were \\"recognized\\" as sacred:Much later, in the first century CE, Nero included pseudo-sacred groves in his artificial landscaping of Domus Aurea. they have no place in the history of gardens, save as a resort for contemplation and, at Plato's Academy, for intellectual discourse. By contrast, the olive trees in the Academy, watered by the river Cephissus, were planted, grown, it was said, from slips taken of the sacred olive at the Erechtheum. The temenos, or sacred ground, of the Academy was walled round, for ritual reasons, as pleasure gardens would be, for practical ones; within its precincts were buildings: small temples, shrines and tombs, in addition to that of the presiding hero. In 322 BC, Theophrastus, the father of botany, inherited Aristotle's garden, along with his scholars and his library; of the garden we know only that it had a walk, and that Theophrastus lectured there: it may have been in some respects a botanical garden with a scientific rather than recreational purpose. On his return to Athens in 306 BCE, the philosopher Epicurus founded The Garden, a school named for the garden he owned about halfway between the Stoa and the Academy that served as the school's meeting place; little is actually known of the ascetic philosopher's garden, though in cultural history it grew retrospectively in delight: of his garden at Geneva, Les D√©lices, Voltaire could exclaim, with more enthusiasm than history, \\"It is the palace of a philosopher with the gardens of Epicurus‚Äî it is a delicious retreat\\".Voltaire, letter of 23 January 1755, quoted by Thacker, p. 18. Gardens of Adonis, under Syrian influence, were simple plantings of herbal seedlings grown in saucers and pots, which, when they collapsed in the heat of summer, were the signal for mourning for Adonis among his female adherents: these were not gardens in any general sense. ==Hellenistic gardens== Though Harpalus, Alexander's successor at Babylon, grew some Greek plants in the royal palace and walks,œÑŒ¨ Œ≤Œ±œÇŒØŒªŒµŒπŒ± Œ∫Œ±·Ω∂ œÑŒøœÖœÇ œÄŒµœÅŒπœÄŒ¨œÑŒøœÖœÇ (Plutarch, Life of Alexander 35). His unsuccessful attempt to grow ivy in the withering heat of Mesopotamia, was probably for its associations with Dionysos rather than as a garden ground-cover. mainland Greece, mother of democracy and Western cultural traditions, was not the mother of European gardens: the great Hellenistic garden was that of the Ptolemaic dynasty in Alexandria, a grand, walled paradise landscape that included the famous Library of Alexandria, part of the Musaeum. Water-powered automata and water organs featured in Hellenistic gardens, playthings devised by technicians such as Hero of Alexandria, who, not incidentally, also devised machinery for the stage. In late classical times the peristyle form became dominant in grand private houses. This was a paved courtyard, which came to be outfitted with potted plants, a Persian and Egyptian idea, surrounded by a roofed colonnade. It was used for palaces and gymnasia. Roman decorative gardening first appeared after Roman encounters with gardening traditions of the Hellenized East. ==References== ==Further reading== * Birge, Darice Elizabeth (1982).

He is the first (and best known) version of Hobgoblin. In 2009, the Hobgoblin was ranked by IGN as the 57th-greatest comic book villain of all time. The character has been featured in various media adaptations, such as television series and video games. ==Publication history== Roderick Kingsley made his debut in The Spectacular Spider-Man #43 (June 1980). Art by Mike Zeck. Spider-Man's precognitive \\"spider-sense\\" mysteriously alerted of what appeared to be an ordinary and weakly stranger. Roderick Kingsley made his first appearance in Peter Parker, The Spectacular Spider-Man #43 (June 1980) and was created by Roger Stern, Mike Zeck and John Romita Jr.Marvel Age #111, April 1992, Marvel Comics The Hobgoblin's identity was not initially revealed, generating one of the longest-running mysteries in the Spider-Man comics. According to Stern, \\"I plotted that first story with no strong idea of who the Hobgoblin was. As I was scripting those gorgeous pages from JR [John Romita Jr.], particularly the last third of the book, and developing the Hobgoblin's speech pattern, I realized who he was. It was Roderick Kingsley, that sunuvabitch corporate leader I had introduced in my first issue of Spectacular\\". A handful of readers deduced that Kingsley was the Hobgoblin almost immediately. In order to throw readers off the scent and provide a retroactive explanation for his inconsistent characterization of Kingsley in his early appearances, Stern came up with the idea of Kingsley having his brother Daniel Kingsley sometimes impersonate him, sealing the deception by having the Hobgoblin appear in the same room as Kingsley in Amazing Spider-Man #249. Stern's original plan was to have the mystery of the Hobgoblin's identity run exactly one issue longer than that of the Green Goblin's identity, meaning the truth would be revealed in The Amazing Spider-Man #264. However, Stern left the series after The Amazing Spider-Man #252, and his successors felt Kingsley was a weak choice for the Hobgoblin's true identity. Thus, the Hobgoblin was ultimately unmasked as Ned Leeds in The Amazing Spider-Man #289 (after considerable creative struggle over the issue), and Jason Macendale took over as the Hobgoblin. Stern was unhappy with the revelation that the Hobgoblin's civilian identity was Leeds and wrote the three-issue miniseries Spider-Man: Hobgoblin Lives in 1997, with the retcon that Kingsley was the original Hobgoblin and had brainwashed Leeds as a fall guy. Stern followed up the miniseries with the Spider-Man storyline \\"Goblins at the Gate\\", which resulted in Kingsley and Norman Osborn being bitter rivals obsessed with each other's destruction over the Goblin legacy. ==Fictional character biography== Roderick Kingsley started out as a fashion designer and billionaire who had criminal underworld connections and had come about his wealth through unethical business practices and corporate raiding. Coincidentally, Kingsley was an employer of Mary Jane Watson for a time. As a means of avoiding the drill of day-to-day appearances, he had his timid identical twin brother Daniel Kingsley pose as him to run his corporation. Kingsley's activities gave him many enemies, one of which was Bella Donna (Narda Ravanna), a rival fashion designer whose business he had ruined and attempted revenge on Kingsley but is twice thwarted by Spider-Man. After these incidents, Kingsley seeks to protect himself and his empire by gaining more power. The thug George Hill reports to Kingsley of stumbling upon Norman Osborn's secret lair in hopes of earning a reward. Kingsley instead kills Hill to make sure that no one else gets wind of the discovery. Upon examining the lair and gleaning its secrets, Kingsley decides to use the Goblin equipment. Arriving to the conclusion that all the previous Green Goblin mantle wearers went mad, he instead creates a similar but different mantle: the Hobgoblin identity. Soon afterwards, he encounters Spider-Man. He uses some of Osborn's files to blackmail prominent figures, and attempts to buy Osborn's old corporation and merge with his own. These schemes bring him into conflict with Spider-Man. Among Osborn's notes, Kingsley also finds incomplete remnants of Mendel Stromm's strength enhancing potion and was obsessed with finding the complete formula or perfecting the incomplete notes. During his various criminal activities, Kingsley repeatedly loses to Spider-Man, as he lacked raw physical power. Kingsley eventually perfected the strength-enhancing formula, but, aware that Osborn was driven insane, Kingsley opts to test on someone else first, tricking small-time hood Lefty Donovan after using a mind-control device developed by Gerhard Winkler (Osborn's former employee). With Donovan having administered the Goblin formula and then in the Hobgoblin costume to fight Spider-Man, Kingsley monitored his pawn's vital signs and behavior from a distance. When Spider-Man overwhelms and unmasks Donovan and the brainwashing begins to fail, Kingsley acts to protect his identity by programming Donovan's glider to crash into a building, instantly killing Donovan. Judging the experiment a success, Kingsley immerses himself in his completed formula derivative and gains greater strength than the original Goblin. He uses this strength to battle Spider-Man and the Black Cat. Despite his increased abilities, he is still narrowly defeated by Spider-Man. Worse, he attracts the attention of powerful criminal interests who perceive him as a threat, including the Kingpin. It is also revealed later that during this time, after the Hobgoblin made his appearance, Norman (presumed to be dead at the time) made a brief return to New York City in an attempt to deal with this Goblin, but ultimately abandoned this for the sake of schemes against Spider- Man. After a bitter encounter with Spider-Man, Kingsley discovers he had been followed by Daily Bugle reporter Ned Leeds having discovered his lair. Kingsley captured Leeds and brainwashes the reporter with Winkler's device into being the Hobgoblin. Kingsley discovered that Leeds had been working with Richard Fisk on a plan to bring down the Kingpin's empire as Richard adopted the Rose crime lord identity, using Leeds to handle some negotiations, and fooling many criminals into believing that his pawn was the Hobgoblin and hoping to use the Kingpin's downfall to advance his own interests. As Leeds gets too erratic to function as a decoy, Kingsley arranged for Leeds to be assassinated by Jason Macendale and the Foreigner while on a trip to Berlin, and decided to retire from the Hobgoblin identity. During the events of Secret Wars II, Kingsley is recruited by Mephisto's Legion Accursed, a team of ninety-nine supervillains who try to destroy the Beyonder. The Hobgoblin later kidnaps Harry Osborn. He battles Osborn who uses his own father's weaponry against the Hobgoblin. Roderick Kingsley as Hobgoblin on Spider-Man: Hobgoblin Lives #1 (January 1997). Art by Ron Frenz After a retirement of several years, Kingsley returns to New York. He kills Macendale to prevent from giving the authorities information that would jeopardize his secret identity in addition to seeing Macendale an unworthy successor.Spider-Man: Hobgoblin Lives #1 (January 1997) Learning that Betty Brant has begun to investigate Ned's activities as the Hobgoblin‚Äîinformed of the truth by Spider-Man after realizing that the Foreigner's human operatives could never have killed Leeds if Leeds had been super-powered‚ÄîKingsley kidnaps Betty and sets a trap for Spider-Man.Spider-Man: Hobgoblin Lives #2 (February 1997) In the final fracas, Daniel is captured and the Hobgoblin is unmasked, clearing Ned's name. Roderick is taken to prison, imprisoned in the same cell where he killed Macendale.Spider-Man: Hobgoblin Lives #3 (March 1997) Furious at Norman's return and denial of being the Goblin, Kingsley spreads rumors that there exists a secret journal of Osborn's that proves beyond a doubt of being the Goblin, but this was later revealed to be a ruse, knowing Osborn has been sending spies on him: all of the journals in his possession had been destroyed during a battle with Spider-Man years before. He offers to barter this information, for his freedom, with the District Attorney, guessing that Osborn will try to get to him first. Osborn, deciding to make a deal with Kingsley, breaks him out of prison. Kingsley is then confronted by both Osborn and another Green Goblin.Spectacular Spider-Man #259 (July 1998) Osborn provides Kingsley with new Goblin equipment, and both Goblins swoop in to collect Daniel, now in protective custody, who Roderick claims knows the final journal's location. Spider-Man defends Daniel, but is drugged and both men are taken back to Osborn.Spectacular Spider-Man #260 (August 1998) Osborn knew Kingsley was lying about the journal and has bought Kingsley's company out from underneath him; the purpose of helping Kingsley escape is for Osborn to eliminate the one person who possibly can prove that Osborn is the Goblin personally. Kingsley furiously attacks Osborn who is shocked to discover that Kingsley is stronger and thus fails at killing him. The building began to burn as a result of their battle, and Spider-Man escapes with Daniel. All three of the villains managed to escape as well. With several million dollars hidden away in foreign bank accounts, Kingsley quietly moves to a small island in the Caribbean to enjoy his retirement.Spectacular Spider-Man #261 (September 1998) Kingsley is seemingly killed by Phil Urich who takes on the Hobgoblin mantle,The Amazing Spider-Man #649 but this was in fact Daniel with Roderick still active in Ecuador under the alias Devil-Spider. Roderick learns that his brother has been murdered and plans his return to New York.Amazing Spider-Man #691 Kingsley arrives in New York City and returns to the Hobgoblin role, intending to go after Urich.The Amazing Spider-Man #694 (September 2012) Kingsley attacks Urich and the Kingpin in Shadowland.

Urich insists on going after but Kingsley stuns Urich with a taser so they can both escape. Kingsley decides to let Urich remain the Hobgoblin, but only if Urich gives him a cut of whatever profits are made.The Amazing Spider-Man #697 (November 2012) Kingsley obtains one of Mysterio's suits which he sells to a criminal who takes on the name Mysterion.Avenging Spider-Man #26 He sells the Crime Master's gear to an unnamed Maggia operative.The Superior Spider-Man #22 He ends up in a gang war with the Goblin Nation, selling equipment to low-level criminals who became the latest versions of 8-Ball, Answer, Blaze, Devil-Spider, Gibbon, Hitman, Killer Shrike, Mauler, Melter, Ringer, Steeplejack, Tumbler, and Unicorn as well as a new villain named Bruin who wears one of Grizzly's old exoskeleton bear suits.The Superior Spider-Man #25 He is killed by the first Goblin King while his henchmen are claimed for the Goblin Nation but his butler Claude went in his place so that his enemies could be distracted and Kingsley is actually in Paris.

Following his inversion, Kingsley returns to New York and finds himself happier with his inversion, although still motivated by greed rather than altruism. He reactivates his franchises where he leases the personas and costumes of deceased or retired superheroes to ordinary people, but remains a wanted criminal. He also enfranchises his Hobgoblin persona to various people to perform heroic deeds as Hobgoblin and publishes a comic about the group for promotion. Among those who answer an ad are the amnesiac Lily Hollister and the underemployed teenager John Myers. Other attendees include a different Demolition Man, Flower Girl, Leather Boy, a new Razorback, and a new Water Wizard. He sets a three phase program including a book and various articles with his brand and underground speeches named after Ned for people to make their own franchises in exchange for a share of their profits.AXIS: Hobgoblin #1 Kingsley debuts his Hob-Heroes: Lily as Queen Cat, Myers as Missile Mate, Flower Girl, Leatherboy, Rocket Head, and Water Wizard. When the second Goblin King confronts Kingsley in his headquarters, Myers is convinced by Urich's claims that Kingsley will soon abandon the heroes he has trained. Missile Mate goes to Urich's headquarters and asks to join to be a supervillain. Urich is reluctant, but Myers shows also gathering all the supervillains Kingsley \\"abandoned\\" after being a good guy.AXIS: Hobgoblin #2 When the celebration of a \\"Hobgoblin Day\\" is being held with a parade in Kingsley's honor, Missile Mate betrays Kingsley and attempts to murder him in the Goblin King's name. Kingsley has already expected the betrayal and has been using a hologram decoy which takes Missile Mate's blow. As soon as Kinglsey confronts Missile Mate, Urich appears with the Goblin Nation and attacks the celebration. Kingsley bests Urich in combat and leaves his rival to the authorities. After, he is approached by Steve Rogers to be part of a team of Avengers with the objective to stop the inverted X-Men from detonating a gene bomb which would kill everyone on the Earth who wasn't a mutant.AXIS: Hobgoblin #3 The Avengers team that Kingsley joins is called the Astonishing Avengers. After the reinversion spell is cast to restore the Avengers and X-Men members that were affected by it back to the side of good, Kingsley is evil again.Avengers & X-Men: AXIS #9 Kingsley starts to get his old franchises back under control. Outside of recruiting Blizzard, Kingsley regains his former minions Beetle, Bruin, Hitman, Ringer, and Unicorn as well as establishing his versions of Cutthroat, Diamondback, Mockingbird, and Viper. When franchisee Porcupine informs him of an intent to end the contract, Kingsley tries to kill with a Pumpkin Bomb in order to reclaim said suit for future franchisees.Spider-Woman Vol. 6 #13 In the resulting battle with Porcupine and crimefighting mentor Spider-Woman, Kingsley is taken down by Captain Marvel.Spider-Woman Vol. 6 #16 Kingsley turns up as a member of the Sinister Six led by the Iron Spider. He accompanies the Sinister Six in a plot to steal a decommissioned S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier.Spider-Man #234 ==Powers, abilities, and weaknesses== Roderick Kingsley initially had no superhuman abilities, but possessed a keen analytical intellect with enough knowledge of chemistry and biology to understand Norman Osborn's notes regarding the Goblin formula. Kingsley not only recreated the formula but perfected by removing side-effects. Further, he updated many of Osborn's various Goblin inventions. With a technological means developed by Brainwasher, Kingsley can control the human mind through hypnosis and programming, typically to create stand-ins for himself. Kingsley was skilled in the management of both criminal organizations and legally run professional businesses. Due to his green chemical solution exposure, Kingsley possesses superhuman strength on par with Spider-Man and stronger than Osborn (due to its improvements and duration of Kingsley's exposure was longer). Likewise, his reflexes, speed, stamina, and intellect were also enhanced to superhuman levels. As the Hobgoblin, he wore bulletproof mail with an overlapping tunic, cape, and cowl. A computerized system cybernetically causes the finger-blasters to randomly vary their attack vectors when trained on a particular target. He uses a Goblin glider, a one-man miniature turbo-fan- powered vertical thrust, cybernetically-controlled vehicle. It can reach high velocities and is extremely maneuverable. He uses concussion and incendiary Jack O'Lanterns, wraith-shaped smoke and gas-emitting bombs, bat shaped razor- edged throwing blades, and gloves woven with micro-circuited power conducting filaments which channel pulsed discharges of electricity. He wore a shoulder bag to carry his small, portable weaponry. ==Other versions== ===MC2=== Roderick Kingsley made his MC2 debut as a hired assassin to kill many of the Spider-Girl characters, including Normie Osborn, Spider-Girl, and Peter Parker.Spider-Girl #97 After a fight against both Spider-Girl and her father, he came close to victory, but at the end his only success lay in killing the Venom symbiote, and also in escaping without a trace.Spider-Girl #100 (September 2006) He attempted a complex plot to become the new kingpin of crime, but was undone due to an act of treachery by his partner, the Mindworm.

The plan was originally drafted between 1958 and 1960 by Viljo Revell; Heikki Castr√©n continued work on the plan after Revell's death in 1964. The fulfillment of the plan would have required the demolition of several old buildings that are today considered to be a vital part of Helsinki's heritage. The only part of the plan that was implemented as planned is the 1967 office and shopping centre building right across the street from the Helsinki Central railway station, popularly known as Makkaratalo, Finnish for \\"sausage house\\": the elevated parking lot occupying the third floor is encircled by a decorative railing which is said to resemble a sausage. The first occurrence of the name was in a caricature drawn by the Finnish cartoonist Kari Suomalainen in Helsingin Sanomat. In the cartoon, a man is buying food from a snack bar near the Makkaratalo. He points at the railing, and the snack bar vendor replies, \\"Well, I'm just a small-time businessman.\\" Today, the term \\"City-Center\\" refers to the entire shopping complex consisting of the Makkaratalo, various older properties, and the pathways connecting them to the adjacent streets. However, the term is rarely used and is unfamiliar even to most natives of Helsinki. The Finnish real estate company Sponda bought the City-Center in 2000 and has extensively renovated it. The building is currently protected by Finland's National Board of Antiquities as part of the city's heritage. In 2005 a decision was made to place the building under protection, allowing removal of the car-ramps but not the \\"sausage\\".Helsingin sanomat 26.1.2006: Valitukset uhkaavat lyk√§t√§ Makkaratalon ymp√§rist√∂n muutoksia The Helsingin kaupunginmuseo (Helsinki city Museum Bureau) also concluded in a written statement that > The Makkaratalo reflects the Finnish ideology of planning in the 60's, e.g., > the view that the city of Helsinki should prepare for a wider use of cars as > part of becoming a modern metropolis.

In the Domesday Book of 1086, estates at Berwick and Asserton were part of Winterbourne Stoke; by the 12th century the village had its present name. Stapleford Castle, a medieval ringwork castle, was just south of the parish at Stapleford. Manor Farmhouse, on the village High Street, is late 16th century; Berwick House, to the west of the High Street, is early 19th century. In medieval times Asserton was a village or hamlet, with its own church or chapel, and in the 14th and 15th centuries it was a separate tithing. In 1557 Asserton manor was granted to James Basset, a courtier to Queen Mary.

In 1968 he completed his Bachelor of Arts degree in Oriental Studies at Princeton University, having interrupted his studies from 1966 to 1967 to pursue the study of Arabic at the Middle East Centre for Arab Studies (MECAS) in the village of Shimlan, Lebanon. From 1968 to 1970 he served with the U. S. Army, seeing duty with U. S. Army Security Agency in Herzogenaurach, Germany in 1969-1970. He then studied oriental philology for a year (1970-1971) at the Friedrich-Alexander Universit√§t in Erlangen, Germany, before returning to Princeton for doctoral work. Donner received his PhD in Near Eastern Studies from Princeton in 1975. He taught Middle Eastern history in the History Department at Yale University from 1975-1982 before taking his position at the University of Chicago in 1982 (The Oriental Institute and Department of Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations). He served as chairman of his Department (1997‚Äì2002) and as Director of the University's Center for Middle Eastern Studies (2009‚Äìpresent). In 2007, he was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship to examine Arabic papyri from the first Islamic century (seventh century CE) at collections in Paris, Vienna, Oxford, and Heidelberg. Donner was President of Middle East Medievalists from 1992 until 1994 and served as editor of the journal Al-Usur al-Wusta: The Bulletin of Middle East Medievalists from 1992 until 2011. Donner was President of the Middle East Studies Association of North America. He has been a member of MESA since 1975, served an earlier term on MESA's Board of Directors (1992-1994) and was awarded MESA's Jere L. Bacharach Service Award in 2008.

In Narratives of Islamic Origins (1998), Donner argues for an early date for the Qur'an text. He responds in particular to the theory of late canonization of the Qur'an proposed by John Wansbrough and Yehuda D. Nevo.Narratives of Islamic Origins p. 62 The book attempts to explain how concerns for legitimation in the developing Islamic community shaped the themes that are the focus of Islamic historical writing, particularly the themes of prophecy, community, hegemony, and leadership. Donner's book Muhammad and the Believers: At the Origins of Islam, an account of the early years of the spiritual movement that would come to be known as Islam, was published by Harvard University Press in May 2010. Donner's main argument is that what came to be called Islam began as a monotheistic \\"Believers' movement\\" inaugurated by Muhammad which included righteous Christians and Jews as well as those monotheists who followed the teachings of the Qur'an. Only under the rule of Abd al-Malik (685-705) did Islam begin to separate from Christians and Jews.Patricia Crone: Among the Believers Tablet Magazine 10 August 2010 This argument was first presented at a \\"Late Antiquity and Early Islam\\" workshop in London in 1993, and published in his article \\"From Believers to Muslims,\\" which appeared in the journal Al- Abhath 50-51 (2002‚Äì2003), pp. 9‚Äì53. ==Reception== Donner's book The Early Islamic Conquests (1981) has been described as \\"magisterial\\" and \\"a major contribution to the understanding of early Islamic history\\" (International Journal of Middle East Studies).Review of The Early Islamic Conquests in the International Journal of Middle East Studies It is used as a set text for several university courses.e.g. refer University of Oklahoma (accessed 2 October 2007) Donner's Muhammad and the Believers has been described as \\"learned and brilliantly original\\" in a The New York Times review.New York Times, The Muslim Past, Sunday Book Review by Max Rodenbeck 25 June 2010 Patricia Crone wrote that the only direct evidence for Donner's central thesis of an ecumenical early Islam comes from several Quranic verses, while the rest is based on conjecture. According to Crone, The New York Times review of Donner's book indicates that his account of a \\"nice, tolerant, and open\\" Islam appeals to American liberals, and it may perform a useful role in educating the broader public, but as a scholarly work \\"it leaves something to be desired\\".Patricia Crone: Among the Believers Tablet Magazine 10.

At the time of the Domesday Book in 1086 it was recorded (as Leie) as having been held prior to the Norman Conquest by Northmann of Mereworth of Abingdon Abbey and to have passed under the same overall ownership to the minor feudal lord William the Chamberlain.Open Domesday Retrieved 7 May 2016 ===Bessels=== The manor of Leigh was acquired by the family of Bessels (or Besils, Bessiles, etc.) in the mid-14th century, possibly by Thomas Bessels, and by the next century had become known as \\"Bessels Leigh\\" to distinguish it from the many other places in England called \\"Leigh\\". According to the antiquary John Leland, the Bessels family had been settled at Besil's Leigh in Berkshire since the reign of King Edward I.,Leland, quoted by Tudor Place but originated in Provence in France and were \\"men of activitye in feates of arms as it appearith in monuments at Legh; how he faught in listes with a straunge knyghte that challengyd hym, at the whitche deade the kynge and quene at that time of England were present\\".Leland, quoted by Tudor Place ===Fettiplace=== Arms of Fettiplace: Gules, two chevrons argent Richard Fettiplace (c.1456‚Äì1511) married Elizabeth Besil, only daughter and heiress of William Besil of Besil's-Leigh, which he made his chief seat.Guillim, John, The banner display'd: or, An abridgment, Volume 1, p.141 Richard was buried in the chancel of Poughley Priory Church, near Great Shefford in Berkshire, and bequeathed property to that church and a 99-year lease lands to a chantry chapel within in the parish church of East Shifford \\"to keep an obiit there for my soul and to yearly keep in order the said parish church and to maintain lights there\\". In January 1527, Edward Fetyplace, Treasurer to the Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk, wrote to Thomas Cromwell, upbraiding him with breaking his word as to granting him the site of the dissolved Poughley Priory, on the faith of which he had given Cromwell 40 shillings at the time of its dissolution, but the lease had been granted to another man.Houses of Austin canons: The Priory of Poughley' in: A History of the County of Berkshire: Volume 2 (1907), pp. 85‚Äì86 Fetyplace complains that he had bought of Cromwell certain implements belonging to the Priory, of which he left there the well bucket and rope, and a brass pan set in the wall to brew with, which said implements the scholars of the Cardinal's College 'have perused and worn in the time of their lying there,' but the bursar refuses to pay for them. In February 1529, Edward Fetyplace wrote again to Cromwell desiring his interest that he might be assured of more years in the farm of Poughley. From this letter it is evident that Cromwell had been recently visiting the dismantled priory, as Fetyplace records a visit to Poughley, on 'the Thursday after our departing,' of one John Edden who came with a cart to carry off such stuff as was appointed to go to Wolsey's College at Oxford; the bedding was in Fetyplace's chamber, which was locked, but Edden 'with great oaths and with levers brak up the doors.'

The aircraft crashed onto what was then a military firing range at Great Park Farm, Besselsleigh and almost immediately burst into flames. All three members of its crew were killed. At the time United States Army soldiers were billeted at Besselsleigh Park. They and a local man, Ron Amey, tried without success to rescue the crew. The pilot, Sgt DC Adamson, is buried in the Commonwealth War Graves Commission section of Botley Cemetery, on the outskirts of Oxford. Ron Amey went on to succeed his father William Amey as head of the Amey quarrying and construction company. ==Economy and amenities== The Greyhound public house Besselsleigh has a public house, the Greyhound.

Archaeologists have been able to recreate the layout and analyse the plants used in the garden. Roman gardens and ornamental horticulture became highly developed under Roman civilization. The Gardens of Lucullus (Horti Lucullani), on the Pincian Hill in Rome, introduced the Persian garden to Europe around 60 BC. It was seen as a place of peace and tranquillity, a refuge from urban life, and a place filled with religious and symbolic meaning. As Roman culture developed and became increasingly influenced by foreign civilizations, the use of gardens expanded. == Influences == Roman gardening was influenced by Egyptian and Persian gardening techniques, through acquaintance with Greek gardening. The gardens of Ancient Persia were organized around rills, known from Pasargadae and other sites. Although archaeological evidence of rills have yet to be found in classical Greek gardens, scholars believe that the Romans learned this technique from the Greeks. Persian gardens developed in accordance with an arid climate. Gardens were enclosed to protect them from drought, and became rich and fertile in contrast to the barren Persian terrain. When Alexander the Great conquered parts of Western Asia, he brought back with him new varieties of fruits and plants that prompted a renewed interest in horticulture. Formal gardens had existed in Egypt as early as 2800 BC. At the time of the 18th dynasty of Egypt, gardening techniques, used to beautify the homes of the wealthy, were fully developed. Porticos (porches) served to connect the home with the outdoors, creating outdoor living spaces. Even before Alexander, Cimon of Athens is said to have torn down the walls of his garden to transform it into a public space. Roman pleasure gardens were adapted from the Grecian model, where such a garden also served the purpose of growing fruit, but while Greeks had \\"sacred grove\\" style gardens, they did not have much in the way of domestic gardens to influence the peristyle gardens of Roman homes. Open peristyle courts were designed to connect homes to the outside world. Athens did not adopt the Roman style that was used to beautify temple groves and create recreational spaces in the less traditional Grecian cities of Sparta, Corinth and Patras, which adopted the Western peristyle domestic gardens. == Uses == Roman gardens were built to suit a range of activities. Initially, lower class Romans used gardens as a source of food to provide for their families and mainly grew herbs and vegetables. In Ancient Latium, a garden was a part of every farm. According to Cato the Elder, every garden should be close to the house and should have flower beds and ornamental trees. Later, the different influences of Egyptian, Persian, and Greek gardens became a part of Roman horticulture, producing villa and palatial pleasure gardens, along with public parks and gardens meant for enjoyment or to exercise in. No type of garden was specifically reserved for wealthy Romans; all a civilian needed was to have their own land or home. Excavations in Pompeii show that gardens attached to residences were scaled down to meet the space constraints of the home of the average Roman. Horace wrote that during his time, flower gardens became a national indulgence. Augustus constructed the Porticus Liviae, a public garden on the Oppian Hill in Rome. Outside Rome, gardens tended to proliferate at centers of wealth. Modified versions of Roman garden designs were adopted in Roman settlements in Africa, Gaul and Britannia. ==Places for a garden== Gardens were usually built in one of six structures: Domus (townhouse) ‚Äì this free-standing structure was usually one story, containing multiple rooms for everyday activities and an atrium toward the front of the house to collect rainwater and illuminate the area surrounding it. Toward the back of the house was often a hortus or peristylium (an open courtyard). Roman villa (typically a country house for wealthy people) Villa rustica (a villa set in the countryside, often as the hub of a large agricultural estate) Palace villa ‚Äì reserved for imperial families alone, very large and extravagant. Non-residential gardens ‚Äì these would be the public parks, pleasure gardens, temple gardens, tombs, etc. == Elements of a garden == All Roman gardens were generally made up of the same basic elements. Depending on the style or type of garden, elements may be added or embellished more, or may be omitted altogether. Even though an atrium is found inside the house, it is considered part of the garden because it has an opening that would allow Romans to collect rain water. Pleasure gardens would incorporate different designs according to the taste of their builders. All gardens of this type have the same basic parts to them: a patio at the entrance, a terrace, an orchard or vineyard, several water features, a kitchen garden, shrines or grottoes and other garden features that would personalize the garden. The patio would normally be decorated with outside garden furniture, a water basin or fountain, and be the starting point of a walk that would show off all the features of the garden. Peristyle ‚Äì from a Greek word, where \\"peri\\" means \\"around\\" and \\"style\\" means \\"column\\" ‚Äì denotes a type of open courtyard, which is surrounded by walls of columns supporting a portico (porch). The xystus (garden walk or terrace) was a core element of Roman gardens. The xystus often overlooked a lower garden, or ambulation. The ambulation bordered a variety of flowers, trees, and other foliage, and it served as an ideal place for a leisurely stroll after a meal, conversation, or other recreational activities. The gestation was a shaded avenue where the master of the house could ride horseback or be carried by his slaves. It generally encircled the ambulation or was constructed as a separate oval- shaped space. Paths or walkways were often constructed through the garden. These were made with loose stone, gravel, sand, or packed earth. Gardens featured many ornamental objects, from sculpture to frescoes to sundials. These depicted nature scenes or were put in place as a shrine (aedicula) to the gods or otherworldly creatures. The plants that were grown ranged from flowering plants to herbs and vegetables for everyday use, as well as trees. The most popular plants found in a typical Roman family's garden were roses, cypress, rosemary, and mulberry trees. Also possibly included were a variety of dwarf trees, tall trees, marigolds, hyacinths, narcissi, violets, saffron, cassia, and thyme. == Legacy == Roman garden designs led to the Italian garden, elements of which were adopted by Renaissance, Baroque, Neoclassical, and even 20th century landscape architects. == See also == * Giardino all'italiana * Landscape design history * Agriculture in ancient Rome == References == == Further reading == * * Ciarallo, Annamaria.

Its dimension is n(n+1)/2 (where the dimension of V is 2n). It may be identified with the homogeneous space :U(n)/O(n), where U(n) is the unitary group and O(n) the orthogonal group. Following Vladimir Arnold it is denoted by Œõ(n). The Lagrangian Grassmannian is a submanifold of the ordinary Grassmannian of V. A complex Lagrangian Grassmannian is the complex homogeneous manifold of Lagrangian subspaces of a complex symplectic vector space V of dimension 2n. It may be identified with the homogeneous space of complex dimension n(n+1)/2 :Sp(n)/U(n), where Sp(n) is the compact symplectic group. ==Topology== The stable topology of the Lagrangian Grassmannian and complex Lagrangian Grassmannian is completely understood, as these spaces appear in the Bott periodicity theorem: \\\\Omega(Sp/U) \\\\simeq U/O, and \\\\Omega(U/O) \\\\simeq Z\\\\times BO ‚Äì they are thus exactly the homotopy groups of the stable orthogonal group, up to a shift in indexing (dimension). In particular, the fundamental group of U/O is infinite cyclic, with a distinguished generator given by the square of the determinant of a unitary matrix, as a mapping to the unit circle. Its first homology group is therefore also infinite cyclic, as is its first cohomology group. Arnold showed that this leads to a description of the Maslov index, introduced by V. P. Maslov. For a Lagrangian submanifold M of V, in fact, there is a mapping :M -> Œõ(n) which classifies its tangent space at each point (cf. Gauss map). The Maslov index is the pullback via this mapping, in :H1(M, Z) of the distinguished generator of :H1(Œõ(n), Z). ==Maslov index== A path of symplectomorphisms of a symplectic vector space may be assigned a Maslov index, named after V. P. Maslov; it will be an integer if the path is a loop, and a half-integer in general. If this path arises from trivializing the symplectic vector bundle over a periodic orbit of a Hamiltonian vector field on a symplectic manifold or the Reeb vector field on a contact manifold, it is known as the Conley‚ÄìZehnder index. It computes the spectral flow of the Cauchy‚ÄìRiemann-type operators that arise in Floer homology. It appeared originally in the study of the WKB approximation and appears frequently in the study of quantization, quantum chaos trace formulas, and in symplectic geometry and topology. It can be described as above in terms of a Maslov index for linear Lagrangian submanifolds. ==References== *V. I.

Tucker's Town is a small community in St. George's Parish, Bermuda at the mouth of Castle Harbour. It is the only part of the parish on the Main Island, and includes the Tucker's Town Peninsula that today is the site of many homes belonging to wealthy non-Bermudians. The most densely populated part of Tucker's Town was situated west of Tucker's Town Bay (not on the peninsula), and was almost entirely cleared to make way for golf links. ==History== ===Forgotten community=== Oliver Constantine Lambert and his son-in-law, Osmond Charles Fanshaw Talbot, two of the residents who fought the compulsory purchase of Tucker's Town Tucker's Town was founded by the recently arrived Governor of Bermuda Daniel Tucker in 1616, but the land was found \\"verie meene\\", while the harbour itself was unprotected from the weather and isolated from the rest of the island.Jarvis, Michael, Bermuda's Architectural Heritage: St. George's (Bermuda National Trust 1998), p. 14 Tucker ignored these issues and began to lay out a street grid plan ‚Äì featuring a road‚Äîand had a small chapel built,Jarvis (1998), p. 149 but was unable to attract any migrants from the main settlement at St, George's. The following year, only two or three cottages had been built in the area, and those were inhabited by soldiers manning Castle Island.Jarvis (1998), p. 3 Once the failure of the Town was acknowledged, the land was allotted to officers stationed at Castle Island, and off-duty soldiers tended to spend their time there instead of at the Island's sentry post. The only civilian presence was the family of the fort commander. By 1750, a small civilian community‚Äî35 families living on of public land‚Äîhad finally been established, as had a whaling station to support hunting off Bermuda's south shore. In 1758, Governor William Popple regranted the land to a group of wealthy landowners, but this had little effect on the tenants. In 1780, the Government of Bermuda began an initiative to encourage the cultivation of cotton in Tucker's Town. The move was not commercially successful, as the wrong kind of cotton was grown. By 1834, former slaves owned property in Tucker's Town as part of St. George's large free black population (some 45% of St. George's blacks prior to that year's abolition of slavery).Jarvis (1998), p. 8 An 1856 hurricane strike, coupled with frequent waterspouts and tornadoes, destroyed much of the area's pastures and houses.Jarvis (1998), p. 150 During the American Civil War in the 1860s, hundreds of barrels of gunpowder and saltpetre were stored at Tucker's Town and Smith's Island.Jarvis (1998), p. 52 In 1862, a 42-year-old black labourer named James Talbot purchased over of Tucker's Town from the estate of lawyer Benjamin Dickinson Harvey, who in 1800 had acquired nearly of the area. In 1882, Talbot sold part of his estate for a nominal fee so that a school could be built. The school's eight trustees planned for a one-room school that would also be used to encourage temperance (see also: temperance movement). The schoolhouse survives as \\"Lookout Cottage\\" at the entrance of the Mid Ocean Club. ===Tourism centre=== Tucker's Town in 1895 Officers of the 3rd Battalion Royal Fusiliers during Battalion Training at Tucker's Town in 1904. The area was long used by the military for coastal defence, tent camps, and field training By the twentieth century, the area was one of Bermuda's poorest and most neglected locales. The Bermuda Development Company was formed in response to growing American tourism. This body aimed to create an exclusive and prestigious enclave for wealthy tourists, and was empowered to force residents to sell their land.Duncan McDowall, \\"Trading Places,\\" BERMUDA Magazine, Summer 1996, pp. 18‚Äì29 & Duncan McDowall, Another World: Bermuda and the Rise of Modern Tourism (Macmillan Educational: 1999) The plan was favoured by most Bermudians, who were excited by the prospect of a post-war tourism revival, and a petition objecting to the plan was signed by only 24 people, mostly belonging to a handful of closely related families residint in Tucker's Town.Jones, Rosemary. Bermuda: Five Centuries (Panatel: 2004), p. 165 The land was purchased for well-below asking price, and many of the displaced moved to the area of Devil's Hole.Jarvis (1998), p. 151 Most of the signatories of the 23 July, 1920, petition against the planned land acquisitions and redevelopment called for in the \\"Bermuda Development Company Act (No. 2), 1920\\" were related to the Talbot Brothers band, including their maternal grandfather, Oliver Constantine Lambert, parents Osmond Charles Fanshaw Talbot (husband of Mamie Susan Kennedy Augusta Lambert) and Ainslie Letitia Dansmore Manders (born Lambert), maternal uncles Stewart Hastings Lambert and Oliver Ceylon Lambert, maternal aunts Essie Celina Gertrude Lambert, Ann Mahew Constantine Simmons, and Ada Permelia Arlene Simmons, and other relatives Eliza Harriet Talbot (Smith), Rose Ann Smith, Dinna Smith, and five other Smiths, to whom they were related through both the Lambert (via their maternal grandmother, Rose Ann Lambert, born Rose Ann Smith) and Talbot families.

Ombudsman for Bermuda The petition was unsuccessful and Tucker's Town was compulsorily purchased with Dinna Smith the last resident to leave when she was forcibly removed from her property in 1923. Many of these relatives were participants in the civil suit of the descendants of Josiah Smith (the maternal grandfather of sisters Mamie Susan Kennedy Augusta Lambert and Ainslie Letitia Dansmore Lambert, the mothers of the Talbot Brothers band members) against the Bermuda Development Company in the Supreme Court in 1924 that resulted in compensation paid to the descendants for the land known as the Josiah Smith Estate at Tucker's Town. The BDC partnered with the Furness Withy, the steamship company that operated passenger liners between Bermuda and North America, which hired Charles B. Macdonald to design a golf course for its new Castle Harbour Hotel, the Mid Ocean Club. Macdonald's course was finished in December 1921,The Heritage , Mid Ocean Club, accessed 17 December 2008 with the assistance of Portuguese workers from the Azores.Jones (2004), p. 117 The BDC also encouraged the richest of visitors to build their own mansions at Tucker's Town. Childs Frick and Abby Aldrich RockefellerJarvis (1998), p. 152 were among the early elites to build summer homes. The hotel itself was completed, after two years of construction, on 30 November 1931. Opened by Governor General Sir Thomas Astley Cubitt, it featured 400 rooms and was built by 600 Azorean contractors.Jones (2004), p. 168 Prominent visitors were often photographed and used to market Bermuda, and included Babe Ruth, Albert Einstein, Harpo Marx, Irving Berlin and Shirley Temple. In 1935, almost 75,000 tourists visited the overseas territory, compared to 27,000 in 1911 and less than 1,400 in 1885.Jarvis (1998), p. 9 Following the Second World War ‚Äì during which Tucker's Town was garrisoned as the site of the Cable and Wireless transatlantic telegraph cable hutJones (2004), p. 187 ‚Äì the Mid Ocean Club (and Furness, who by that point ran several more hotels in Bermuda) was struggling financially, and in 1951 it was sold to its members. Golf course architect Robert Trent Jones was hired to redesign the course, though he made few changes to MacDonald's design.

It still possesses a section of moat and some original stained glass. New Hall was built between 1560 and 1593 by the family of Robert Drury (c.1456-1535), who gave his name to Drury Lane in London. One of the daughters from this family was rumoured to have been drowned in the lake at Lord Byron's family home, Newstead Abbey. Reference books on ghost stories claim that she was murdered along with a coachman with whom she formed a relationship; a 'phantom coach' is said to haunt the Abbey. The Hall possesses one of the few surviving 'tilting grounds' in England; tilting grounds were used for jousting by medieval knights. A local road has achieved wider notoriety, because of the connotations of its first syllable: Slutshole Lane (sometimes Sluts Hole Lane). However, according to maps and documents held at Norfolk & Norwich Library, the road has also been known as Slutch Hole Lane. The word \\"slutch\\" was an archaic term for mud; it is said to be a cognate of \\"slush\\" , although a rival etymology connects it to \\"sluice\\" (which originated as the Dutch sluis), in the sense of an engineering device created to drain fens. It has also been suggested that the current name was the result of an error by census takers, during the late Victorian era. Attempts to change the spelling, including a residents' petition in 1999, have been opposed by local historians. ==References== ==External links== * Besthorpe New Hall history Category:Villages in Norfolk Category:Civil parishes in Norfolk Category:Breckland District ","title":"Besthorpe, Norfolk"},{"id":"3231642","text":"Sheriff Mustapha Dibba (10 January 1937 - 2 June 2008) was a veteran Gambian politician who was the 1st Vice-President of the Gambia (1970‚Äì1972) and also served as the country's National Assembly speaker from 2002 to 2006. He was also leader of the National Convention Party (NCP). == Biography == Dibba was the son of Mustapha Dibba, a Mandinka chief and farmer. His father would later become the district chief of Central Baddibu in 1967. He was born in Salikene, Central Baddibu in January 1937. He educated at Armitage High School and then at the Methodist Boys High School in Bathurst from 1955 to 1957. He briefly worked as a clerk for the United Africa Company before resigning in 1959 to work for the recently formed People's Progressive Party (PPP). There he organized the party's youth wing and was elected to the House of Representatives as representative for the Central Baddibu constituency in the 1962 election. After the 1966 elections, he was appointed as Minister of Works and Communications and replaced Sheriff Sisay as Minister of Finance of the Gambia in December 1967. When Gambia became a republic after the 1970 referendum, Dibba was appointed as vice president and continuing to serve as Finance Minister. Dibba was the Gambia's first vice-president in 1970. He resigned from that position on 15 September 1972, as a result from the butut scandal, which his younger brother Kutubo was arrested for smuggling Gambian currency and contraband goods to neighbouring Senegal in August 1972 and found to have working out of Sheriff Dibba's official residence, No. 1 Marina. In October 1972, he was appointed as Gambia's first ambassador to the European Economic Community and in July 1974, he was recalled by President Jawara from Brussels and appointed as Minister of Economic Planning and Industrial Development. In late July 1975, Jawara accused Dibba of trying to unseat him through a cabinet revolt and Dibba was dismissed immediately. Dibba was later sacked from the PPP in August 1975. He later formed the National Convention Party (NCP) in 1975. Following elections in 1977, the NCP became the main opposition party in the Gambia. He was arrested in August 1981, along with others NCP members and activists, and incarcerated for his alleged involvement in the foiled coup attempt that year, but was freed after 11 months in detention in July 1982.along with others NCP members and activists, A presidential election was held on 4 May 1982, months after a constitutional amendment instituting direct election of the country's head of state. Dibba was defeated by incumbent President Dawda Jawara. He ran again as the NCP presidential candidate in 1987 and 1992, placing second to Jawara both times.Elections in The Gambia, African Elections Database. Following the overthrow of the Jawara government in 1994, the NCP and other political parties were banned. The ban on the NCP was lifted in mid-2001 and Dibba contested the election held on 18 October of that year. He was defeated by incumbent President Yahya Jammeh and placed fourth out of five candidates, winning 3.8% of the vote. Dibba then gave his support to Jammeh and his party, the Alliance for Patriotic Reorientation and Construction, and after the legislative elections of January 2002, he was elected Speaker of the National Assembly at the first meeting of the new legislature on 3 February. In April 2006, Dibba was arrested for nine days and dismissed as speaker; he was allegedly linked to the coup attempt against Jammeh in the previous month.\\"Gambian parliament gets new speaker\\" , AngolaPress, April 20, 2006. Dibba himself was over 65 years old by this time and was therefore not eligible to run.\\"Former speaker joins the Jammeh camp\\", African Press Agency, September 6, 2006. Nevertheless, after his release, he reaffirmed his loyalty to President Jammeh. He later retired from politics prior to his death. He died from a heart attack at the Royal Victoria Teaching Hospital (RVTH) in Banjul on the morning of 2 June 2008, at the age of 71, after being hospitalized on 30 May. ==References== Category:Vice-Presidents of the Gambia Category:Finance ministers of the Gambia Category:Speakers of the National Assembly of the Gambia Category:1937 births Category:2008 deaths Category:National Convention Party (Gambia) politicians Category:Alumni of Armitage High School Category:People from North Bank Division Category:People of Mandinka descent Category:Prisoners and detainees of the Gambia ","title":"Sheriff Mustapha Dibba"},{"id":"3231648","text":"St Aloysius College (SAC) is fee-charging Catholic college run by the Jesuits in Birkirkara, Malta. It was founded in 1907 to complement the seminaries and tertiary institutions already in existence on the island. Today it is a boys' primary and secondary school with a coeducational sixth form. The College compound also houses a parish church which is used by the school and opened to the public. ==History== On 8 October 1907 the Jesuits, at the request of Pope Pius X, founded the school with 139 boys. The College served as a hospital for Allied soldiers during the Second World War. The primary school was originally Stella Maris School, a separate school founded by the Franciscan Missionaries of Mary, and has been incorporated into the College: boys can now attend the school from kindergarten through to sixth form. ==Secondary School== The secondary school of St Aloysius College is a boys-only college located in Old Railway Road (Triq il-Ferrovija l-Qadima), Birkirkara. It is three storeys high with another storey underground, and incorporates a small inner ground and a large hall which serves as a theatre for cultural events held at the College. Such events include the Soir√©e, the Secondary School Concert, and the celebration of the Eucharist on feast days in the Jesuit calendar. The building was last renovated in the summer of 2006. The college celebrated its centenary in the scholastic year 2007/2008. The school is known for its emphasis on discipline. Each form has its own prefect, to maintain respect and discipline. He is a member of the secondary school board. Each class has a Form Teacher who acts as a mentor for the class and represents the students before school authorities such as the Rector, Prefect of Discipline, and Prefect of Studies. Each class also has a captain and a vice-captain for control during changing of periods, and division captain and vice-division captain to assist them. 300px The college is equipped with science laboratories for physics, chemistry, and biology as well as two computer labs and four chapels. The chapels are dedicated to St. Francis Xavier, one of the three most important Jesuit saints, and La Storta Chapel, a unique chapel in itself. The college sports complex includes a gymnasium, a pavilion that serves as a basketball and handball court, courts for volleyball, badminton, and indoor 5-a-side football, a full-sized UEFA-compliant turf football pitch, a 400m athletics track, and two tennis courts. A swimming pool is in the making but requires more funds. ===Classes=== In scholastic year 2009/2010 a new system for classes was introduced. Instead of letters (1A, 1B, 1C,...) each class has been named for a Jesuit (Francis Xavier, Pierre Favre, Aloysius Gonzaga, Ignatius Loyola, Giuseppe Pignatelli, and so on). ===Students' Council=== The Secondary School has a Students' Council with members elected annually and all students eligible. It has ten members, two from each form. Its president spans fourth/fifth form. The Council is responsible for most school events, including the organisation of casual days and the Form 5 School Leaving Party, or \\"Social\\". ==The Sixth Form== The Sixth Form Section St Aloysius College Sixth Form has been in existence for the best part of 30 years. It offers four major courses ‚Äì science, maths, commerce, and arts ‚Äì each requiring about two years. There are two classes in each course, three for arts. The college annually accepts around 220 new students who have passed the core O Level subjects. Facilities include biology, chemistry, physics, and computer laboratories, a media room, library, and assembly hall. Among the many annual events hosted by the Sixth Form, its Cultural Soiree in early February is most popular, with ticket sales for 2009 around 1,700. It includes dancing, acting, singing, and music and concludes with a 45-minute musical directed and choreographed by the students themselves. Each year the stage crew also presents a small act dubbed the \\"crew item\\". ===The Sixth Form Students' Representative Council=== The Sixth Form has its own Students' Council, with elections in late October and all students eligible. Since 2012 the Council includes four students from each of Lower and Upper Sixth Form, with the president from Upper. The Council is responsible for most school events including the organisation of \\"Unplugged\\" and \\"Christmas Dinner\\", and has an important say in the Soir√©e. ==Saturday schooling== From its inception in 1907, St Aloysius College never held classes on Wednesday but instead on Saturday morning, making it the only school in Malta to do so. On October 13, 2006, a decision was made by Maltese Jesuit Provincial Fr. Paul Chetcuti and College Rector Fr. Patrick Magro to replace Saturdays with Wednesdays to conform to the practice of other schools. In the view of some, this deprived St. Aloysius' College of its uniqueness.The Malta Independent Online The change took effect in September 2007, with St Aloysius' Sixth Form also conforming to the practice of fellow Sixth Forms: De La Salle College (Malta), Junior College (Msida), Giovanni Curmi Higher Secondary School (Naxxar), and the new St. Martin's College Sixth Form (Swatar - Msida) which opened in September 2007. ==Extra-curricular activities== All students are encouraged to participate in extracurricular activities, which include: * Battle of the Bands * Subsonic * Unplugged * Secondary School Concert * Charity work * Cultural Soir√©e * Model European Parliament (MEP) by Aƒ°en≈ºija ≈ªgƒßa≈ºagƒß * NSTF Mini European Assembly * EuroScola * President's Award President's Award Scheme (Malta) * Public Debating Activities (e.g., BCA Speak Your Mind competition & Science Forum) * Young Enterprise SchemeYoung Enterprise Malta * Young Scientist competition * FestAlwigi (Formerly known as SACFest) * Music festival * After School Sports The college also has its own Scout group, one of the oldest established on the island, having formed in 1916. ==Notable alumni== * Robert Arrigo - Member of Parliament, businessman, and Nationalist Party deputy leader for party affairs * David J.

It is a Civil Parish in the Newark & Sherwood district of Nottinghamshire. The population of the civil parish as of the 2011 census is 195. The village is on the A1133 between Newark and Gainsborough, and is 1.5 miles north of the larger village of Collingham, north east of Newark on Trent. The village lies 1 mile east of the River Trent and the River Fleet flows south to east parallel with the village & A1133. Besthorpe acquired Conservation Village status in 2006 because it has maintained much of its original layout focused on Low Road and the Green. == Etymology == Besthorpe's name is derived from the Scandinavian word ‚Äòthorpe‚Äô meaning outlying farmstead or hamlet and probably the name of a key character called something like ‚ÄòBosi‚Äô. It indicates that there was sufficient settlement here in the period of the Danelaw in the 10th century to give the place a name. Parishes and their boundaries were to be well established by the time of the Domesday Book in 1086. ==Geography== Two key environments meet in Besthorpe. To the north and east the East Nottinghamshire Sandlands are an increasingly rare habitat supporting grass heaths, bracken, gorse and broom with mixed small-scale plantations of birch, oak and Scots pine. The River Fleet and the fields to the west are part of the Trent Washlands which provide the village with its River Meadowlands landscape of meadow and river pastures, extensive grasslands and meandering river channels. The Millennium Wood, alongside the A1133, was planted originally in 2000 and bluebells were added to mark the Diamond Jubilee in 2012. A current clearance project aims to keep this Wood accessible for leisure use. ===Besthorpe Nature Reserve=== The Nottinghamshire Wildlife Trust have spent many years reworking old sand and gravel quarries into a nature reserve (officially opened in June 2011) and over 100 species of birds have been recorded including key colonies of tree-nesting great cormorants, a major heronry and sand martins. In 2013 a number of little egrets raised their chicks here ‚Äì at the time considered to be the most northerly such colony in the UK. . The Nature Reserve is easily accessible from Trent Lane and the road to the carpark runs alongside an SSSI meadow noted particularly for its flowers including great burnet and the grass species Yorkshire fog and meadow foxtail. In the spring a range of wild flowers including orchids can be found around the reserve. ==History== === Prehistory === Palaeolithic (Old Stone Age) hunter-gatherers are known to have occupied caves at Creswell Crags on the Notts/Derbys border near Worksop for thousands of years down to 10,000 BC. By this time they used a distinctive range of flint and stone tools examples of which have been found at Farndon ‚Äì possibly a temporary summer hunting camp. During the Mesolithic (Middle Stone Age) the Trent Valley became a multi-channelled river system with extensive wetlands and developed a heavily forested landscape. A detailed pollen sequence taken from a peat-filled former river channel at Girton has revealed changes in the floral environment between 7000 BC and 1000 BC. Fieldwalking at Collingham prior to quarrying produced a high density of flintwork from c 5000 BC along the edge of what was then a gravel island and this would be associated with the activities of hunter- gatherers living off the natural food resources of the Valley. The Neolithic (New Stone Age) is linked with the introduction of farming as the major source of food and a degree of more settled existence. Traces of settlement are notoriously difficult to find and indeed no evidence has been found in our area. However at Langford Lowfields in Collingham archaeologists excavated what they described as a ‚Äòlog jam‚Äô in a former channel of the Trent where flooding in c 2000BC had swept away material from a site upstream only for it to be held up by fallen trees. Animal bones revealed evidence for cattle, pig, wild boar, red and roe deer, horse, dog and sheep and human remains including skulls lodged in the debris were interpreted as coming from a funerary or ritual site disturbed by the floods. The population was increasing with a complex network of social relationships uniting widely dispersed mobile or sedentary groups some of whom must have passed by or even temporarily set up home in Besthorpe even if we don't have firm evidence of their presence. The Bronze Age produced evidence at Girton of a burnt mound. This oval pile of burnt stones some 10‚Äì12 metres in diameter and 0.4 metres high can be linked to heating water and probably cooking. Other archaeological evidence is in the form of a ‚Äòpit alignment‚Äô examined in Besthorpe Quarry in the 1990s; this consisted of a line of deep pits dug presumably to support large posts and usually interpreted as being significant of boundaries or divisions in the landscape. As the alignment was away from any contemporary settlement and its domestic rubbish no finds were made to assist dating. By the later stages of the Iron Age (1st century BC) and into the Roman Period (after 43 AD) a sizeable community had established itself at Ferry Lane Farm between Collingham and Besthorpe. Excavations by Manchester and Salford Universities took place for several summers until 2012. Though there is no suggestion of any significant material wealth, the site revealed a well-ordered system of rectilinear fields, closely spaced enclosures and trackways supporting theories of a relative increase in population densities. Similar sites have been recorded by aerial photography. === Roman === Along the east side of the Valley were a range of farmstead settlements but not ‚Äòvillas‚Äô. Fieldwalking next to A1133 just south of Besthorpe revealed a dense scatter of pottery indicating one of the sites on an elevated gravel terrace safe from flooding. These sites would have had links with the Roman road system (Fosse Way) and traded to a degree with the ‚Äòsmall town‚Äô at Crococalana (Brough) and the larger urban centre of Lindum (Lincoln). At Meering there are suggestions of possible pottery kilns and a hoard of 1,347 Roman coins was found in 1964 by workers in the gravel pits at Besthorpe. Study of the coins which had been crammed into a pot showed that the dateable sequence ended abruptly in 354AD. A first century AD pot was discovered in a house foundation trench at Trent Lane. In later Roman times climatic deterioration lead to flooding and some sites like Ferry Lane Farm were buried under alluvium while others were covered by sand-blown deposits ‚Äì we still have episodes of sand-blow which can cause significant build-up at field edges and on the A1133. === Post-Roman === In post-Roman times the area continued to be settled with the best excavated evidence coming from a site just 500 metres north of Girton. Here a settlement with wattle and daub buildings situated across the crest of a sand dune was occupied between about 650 and 815AD and archaeologists found evidence of textile processing with the discovery of loomweights and spindle whorls. The Scandinavian period is also marked in Girton churchyard by a monumental grave cover dated to c 1000AD. The Parish system established prior to 1086AD tends to create linear parishes perpendicular to the river allowing each to have its share of meadow, arable, pasture, woodland and water. The Fleet is considered to be one medieval course of the river. In 1976 excavations in a garden off Trent Lane discovered a small house with low stone walls and a red clay floor outside of which had been a midden. Pottery found included green glazed fragments of jugs made in Lincoln and capable of being dated to c1250AD. Archaeologists were able to restore an almost complete cooking pot which had been broken at this period and thrown away on the midden. The soot from the open fire on which it was used was still visible on its side. Church records state that the current Victorian church was built in 1844 to replace a Chapel of Ease which was built about 1535AD and fell into disuse after 1760. The stone foundations of the east end of this stone chapel were located during the redevelopment of the church for the Besthorpe Project in 2013. At Mill Farm are the remains of a Windmill, consisting of the oak post, quarter bars and cross trees of a Post mill inside a brick roundhouse, now used as a store.Pevsner, Nikolaus. 1979. The Buildings of England:Nottinghamshire. page 71. Harmondsworth, Middx. Penguin. Besthorpe Mill was built c. 1832, and ceased working by 1909 although the sails and machinery remained intact until at least the 1930s. In 1899 the miller Charles Merriman committed suicide inside the mill by cutting his throat. According to a tenant, Ron Wilkinson, who moved into the mill house in the 1930s the roundhouse floorboards were bloodstained. They were later concreted over.Shaw, T. (1995). Windmills of Nottinghamshire. Page 5.Nottingham: Nottinghamshire County Council. == Holy Trinity Church, Besthorpe == Holy Trinity Church was built in 1844 to replace an old Chapel of Ease built circa 1535, for St Helena's Church, South Scarle and which fell into ruins in 1760. There is evidence that it was dismantled between 1760 and 1770 with various mentions of the sale of bells and bell ropes to South Scarle. A school was built from the ruins of the church and completed in 1734. ‚Äú Its [the church's] alteration into a school house is thought to have been affected about AD 1734. That such a transformation did take place is testified by a pillar of the old church which has been built into an inner wall of the school master's dwelling\\" The school was established under the will of George Carver, who in 1709 bequeathed an annual sum of ¬£5 for educating the poor children of Besthorpe. This information is shown on the stone which was set into the new school building in 1845 and remains in place today. In 1844, part of the land on which the school stood was transferred to form the site of the new chapel. There is evidence that the church was partly rebuilt in 1897 at a cost of ¬£215. The original wooden window frames were replaced with stone and tinted glass. The floor was concreted and a new pulpit provided. The church is unusual in that it is aligned North to South with the altar being at the south end in the apse. The school was demolished, leaving the master's house abutting onto the new chapel and a new school built in 1845 and run under the auspices of the National Society. The master's house was demolished in 1919. Another new school was built in 1879 and the former National School building became the current Village Hall There used to be a Quaker meeting room in the Village but when, in 1986, the Methodist Chapel closed, Holy Trinity was left as the only building for Christian worship.

It lies close to the shore opposite the town square (King's Square), in St. George's Harbour. ==History== St. George's Town, from Barrack Hill, in 1857, with Ordnance Island at left The only island in the town, it covers just and was created by reclaiming the land between several small islands which were once situated here. The original islands of Ducking Stool, Frazer's and Gallows were used, in the early days of the colony, for executions. Joined together to form Ordnance Island, they became a Royal Army Ordnance Corps (RAOC) depot in the 19th Century, supplying ordnance to forts and batteries around St. George's. Prior to this, munitions had been kept within the town (as at the time of the 'Gunpowder Plot', when 100 barrels of gunpowder were stolen at the request of George Washington, and sent to the rebellious Americans during the American War of Independence), and on Hen Island, further out in St. George's Harbour. An accidental detonation on Hen Island resulting from a lightning strike once smashed windows throughout St. George's on 1 November 1812. Ordnance Island is far closer to the town, and a similar explosion here would have been catastrophic. The RAOC operated a second, smaller depot, from a wharf on East Broadway on the outskirts of Hamilton. By the Second World War, the depot had fallen into disuse with the Army and was loaned to the US Navy for use as a submarine base from 1942 to 1945. The channel between Ordnance Island and the King's Square was not bridged 'til after the Second World War. The island is visible as a location in the 1962 film That Touch of Mink, with Cary Grant and Doris Day. At the time, the bridge was clearly wooden. Today, the island is joined to St. George's Island by a concrete bridge. Guard of TS Admiral Somers, the Bermuda Sea Cadet Corps unit of St. George's, parades on Ordnance Island to greet the American Promise in 1986. Most of the buildings erected by the Army and the US Navy have been razed. One large Army building, the Storekeeper's House remains, and was recently refurbished as offices for the Corporation of St. George. The only other buildings on the island are an office of HM Customs used to clear visiting yachts, and a new cruise ship terminal. There is, however, a prominent replica of the Deliverance located on the island. The original was one of the two ships built by the survivors of the Sea Venture, flagship of the Virginia Company, which was wrecked in Bermuda in 1609, accidentally beginning Bermuda's settlement. Ordnance Island was the starting and finishing point of Dodge D. Morgan's record-breaking 1985-1986 non-stop, solo circumnavigation of the planet aboard the American Promise. The Major Donald H. (Bob) Burns Memorial Park on the island includes the Desmond Hale Fountain statue of Admiral Sir George Somers (credited as the founder of Bermuda, and at the helm of the Sea Venture when she was driven on the reefs) which was unveiled by Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon in 1984, during the 375th anniversary of the shipwrecking. The Memorial Park was unveiled on 20 April 1997 during the Twinning Ceremonies with Lyme Regis. ==References== Category:Islands of Bermuda Category:Installations of the British Army Category:Military of Bermuda Category:World War II sites in Bermuda Category:World War II sites of the United Kingdom Category:World War II sites of the United States Category:St. George's, Bermuda ","title":"Ordnance Island"},{"id":"3231686","text":"Ranendra \\"Ronen\\" Sen (born 9 April 1944) is a veteran Indian diplomat who was India's ambassador to the United States of America from August, 2004 to March, 2009.

Hypogea will often contain niches for cremated human remains or loculi for buried remains. Occasionally tombs of this type are referred to as built tombs. The term hypogeum can also refer to any antique building or part of building built below ground such as the series of tunnels under the Colosseum which held slaves (particularly enemy captives) and animals while keeping them ready to fight in the gladiatorial games. The animals and slaves could be let up through trapdoors under the sand-covered arena at any time during a fight. ==Examples== An early example of a hypogeum is found at the Minoan Bronze Age site of Knossos on Crete. Hogan notes this underground vault was of a beehive shape and cut into the soft rock. The ƒ¶al-Saflieni Hypogeum in Paola, Malta, is the oldest example of a prehistoric hypogeum, the earliest phase dating to 3600‚Äì3300 BC; it is a complex of underground chambers, halls and passages covering approximately on three levels, partly carved to imitate temple architecture and containing extensive prehistoric art. In Larnaka, Cyprus‚Äîthe Lefkaritis Tomb was discovered in 1999. Hypogea were also found in Dynastic Egypt, such as at the Northern Mazghuna pyramid, Southern Mazghuna pyramid and Southern South Saqqara pyramid. The hypogea in ancient Palmyra contained loculi closed with slabs bearing sculptured portrait reliefs, and sarcophagi with sculptured family banqueting scenes on their lids. The later Christians built similar underground shrines, crypts and tombs, which they called catacombs. But this was only a difference in name, rather than purpose and rituals, and archeological and historical research shows they were effectively the same. Werner Jacobsen wrote, > Like other ambitious Romans, the bishop-saints of the third and fourth > centuries were usually buried in hypogea in the cemeteries outside the walls > of their cities; often it was only miracles at their tombs that caused their > successors to adopt more up-to-date designs.

It has the distinction of being the first student society in Uppsala preoccupied with the natural sciences. The society was founded in 1800 by a few students under the name Societas pro historia naturali (\\"Society for Natural History\\"), which was changed in 1802 to Zoophytolithiska s√§llskapet (\\"Zoophytolithic Society\\") and finally in 1807 to Linn√©ska institutet (\\"Linnaean Institute\\". The Linnaean disciple Adam Afzelius, then botanices demonstrator (and later professor), was elected its president in 1802. At the time of its last change of name in 1807, done to celebrate the 100th anniversary of Linnaeus' birth, the society had a memorial medal made and published the only fascicle of Linn√©ska institutets skrifter (\\"Publications of the Linnaean Institute\\"); this issue, which was the only one ever published, was reprinted in an edition of Johan Markus Hulth in 1906. Activities ceased in 1813. Besides Afzelius, members or collaborators in the only issue of the journal included Lars Herman Gyllenhaal (later Swedish prime minister for justice), the geologist and mining engineer Jacob Henrik af Forselles, the palaeozoologist Johan Wilhelm Dalman, the collector Gabriel Marklin, the physician Carl Stenhammar (later a professor at Karolinska Institutet), and the later civil servant and amateur naturalist Baron Fredrik Anton Wrangel. Dalman, who was secretary of the society, had appreciated it as an unpretentious meeting place for informal discussions between students and teachers, but resented the pompous character it acquired with the change of name and the magnificent celebration of the Linnaean anniversary in 1807, which he likened to a funeral service for the society.

Robert D. Coe, who studied with him, described Chanler as being \\"eccentric and almost bizarre.\\" Chanler rose to prominence as an acclaimed American artist when his work was exhibited in the 1913 Armory Show in New York City. ==Family and early life== Robert Winthrop Chanler, 1912, Leopard and Deer, gouache or tempera on canvas, mounted on wood, , Rokeby Collection.

When he returned to the U.S. in the early 1900s, he purchased a townhouse on East 19th Street, decorated it with his own works, and called it his House of Fantasy. The townhouse became a social center for New York's art community. Like Shinn, Chanler was a personality and a figure in his time. Chanler was a member of the New York State Assembly (Dutchess Co., 2nd D.) in 1904, but did not run for re-election. In 1907, he was elected sheriff of Dutchess County, New York, and remained in that office for three years.Tad Richards, \\"Robert Chanler: Over the top wasn‚Äôt enough,\\" Hudson Valley One, June 2, 2016 Chanler specialized in painted screens and was a member of the National Society of Mural Painters. A ceiling mural of buffaloes painted by Chanler is in the Coe House in Brookville, New York. He was also a member of the Architectural League of New York. He painted a ceiling inside the Colony Club, a private member's club located at Park Avenue and 62nd Street in New York City. In 1905, Chanler exhibited a work entitled Au Pays des Girafes (or et argent) at the Salon d'Automne in Paris (no. 328 of the catalogue).Salon d'Automne, 1905, Au Pays des Girafes, no. 328, Catalogue des ouvrages de peinture, sculpture, dessin, gravure, architecture et art d√©coratif This was the exhibition that prompted critic Louis Vauxcelles to label a group of painters \\"fauves\\" (wild beasts), thus marking the birth of Fauvism.Russell T.

Robert Winthrop Chanler, stained glass window (one of seven, with a study drawing) in the Whitney Studio, New York City, 1918‚Äì1923, private collection Like many women of her class, Mai Rogers Coe was a patron of artists and had a taste for the elaborate, decorative works of Robert Winthrop Chanler. He painted decorative murals in Mai Coe's bedroom (1921) and in the family's breakfast room, the Buffalo Room (1920). In 1918, Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney commissioned Chanler to create a set of seven stained glass windows for her sculpture studio on MacDougal Alley in Greenwich Village. She asked Chanler to decorate the entire space and over a period of five years, he created an immense chimney-piece of three-dimensional flames, floor to ceiling, in plaster with additional inserts of bronze blazes.Allison Meier, \\"Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney‚Äôs Restored Studio Opens for Public Tours,\\" Hyperallergic, May 17, 2016 He covered the entire ceiling with plaster constellations and then created the windows.Wendy Moonan, \\"Robert W. Chanler's (Stained) Glass Menagerie,\\" Introspective Magazine Chanler also designed murals for Gertrude's studio in Greenvale, New York, including a seaworld fantasy in the bathroom. The studio is extant and privately owned. Chanler's murals at the Villa Vizcaya, 1916 Gertrude Vanderbilt and Mai Rogers Coe were perhaps Chanler's greatest patrons, but he received commissions from other wealthy families for decorative murals and screens. By 1920, when he completed the murals in the Buffalo Room, Chanler's work was well known. He later received favorable commentary in The Upholsterer and Interior Decorator magazine for his murals in Mai Coe's bedroom (1921) and in International Studio magazine for his painted screens (1922). Around this time, Chicago industrialist James Deering commissioned him to paint an \\"undersea fantasy\\" fresco on the ceiling of the indoor/outdoor swimming pool at Villa Vizcaya (1916‚Äì1925), Deering's winter home in Miami, Florida. Clarissa Buch, \\"Vizcaya Restores Iconic Swimming Pool Grotto and Rare Mural by Robert Winthrop Chanler,\\" Miami New Times, Monday, June 13, 2016Allison Meier, \\"The Fantastic Fall of a Boisterous and Beloved Gilded Age,\\" Hyperallergic, September 16, 2016 Chanler was close friends with Hervey White and a member of White's Woodstock artist colony in the early 1920s. White wrote of Chanler, \\"He could correlate his subjects in any period, the politics, sociology, and art. He could illustrate with the customs of the populace, he could give incidents for illustration of his points, then break off with a personal explanation of his conduct. He was a man of great emotion and great mind.\\" Towards the end of his life, Chanler owned a house in Woodstock, where he exhibited his work in local exhibitions.The Art of Robert W. Chanler ==Personal life== Plaster bust of Robert W. Chanler by Cecil de Blaquiere Howard, 1928 On April 12, 1893, he married Julia Remington Chamberlain, a daughter of William Chamberlain and Mary Bradhurst Remington. Julia's elder sister Alice was the first wife of Robert's elder brother Lewis. They had two daughters: Julia on November 24, 1898, and Dorothy Chanler on March 25, 1905. The couple divorced on August 7, 1907. After his divorce from Julia, Chanler had a whirlwind romance with opera singer Natalina \\"Lina\\" Cavalieri. They married on June 18, 1910, but separated by the end of their honeymoon, and their divorce became final in June 1912. After the divorce, Lina returned to Europe, where she became a much-loved star in pre- Revolutionary St. Petersburg, Russia, and in Ukraine. Chanler died on October 24, 1930, at an art colony in Woodstock, New York, after being in a coma for 12 hours. ==Legacy== Chanler's work has been compared to the fantastical works of some renaissance painters. His works involve the use of sculpted gesso, transparent glazes, and gilded finishes to produce ornate and decorative designs. His work still exists in his family's estate, Rokeby near Barrytown, New York, the Luxembourg Museum, and in private collections across the country. In 2010, Chanler's decorative plaster ceiling at the Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney Studio was the focus of a conservation study by a graduate student at the University of Pennsylvania.Whitney Studio Ceiling, Architectural Conservation Laboratory. The ceiling, which had been painted over numerous times, was found to contain vivid colors amidst metallic overlays and glazes.Art of Robert Winthrop Chanler. Extensive restoration of Chanler's murals and the painted plaster ceiling at Villa Vizcaya was begun in 2016. ==References== ==Further reading== * Robert Winthrop Chanler: Discovering the Fantastic, Edited by Gina Wouters, Andrea Gollin, Foreword by Eve M.

Greene had first suggested it as an idea for a film script in 1937, set during the Spanish Civil War, and later developed it whilst working for MGM during the 1940s. Nothing came of it and the rights were offered for sale by MGM in 1983. The buyer (Anthony Blond) allowed Greene to revise and subsequently publish the work. Greene also writes of this novel that \\"I prefer it in many ways to The Third Man\\". ==Plot summary== The story begins in a prison in occupied France during the Second World War. It is decreed that one in every ten prisoners is to be executed; lots are drawn to decide who will die. One of the men chosen is a rich lawyer. He offers all his money to anyone who will take his place. One man agrees. Upon his release from prison the lawyer must face the consequences of his actions. The story comprises four parts. In Part I, set in prison, the occupying German guards issue a decimation order to the thirty inmates. One of the three chosen by drawing lots is a rich lawyer named Chavel. Chavel becomes hysterical and desperately offers his entire wealth to any man willing to die in his place. A young man, known as Janvier, accepts his offer and is executed. In Part II, the war is over and Chavel is alive and free, but virtually destitute. He returns to the house he sold for his life and finds it occupied by Janvier‚Äôs mother and sister, Th√©r√®se. Assuming the false name Charlot, he becomes their servant. Part III sees the arrival of an impostor, named Carosse, who claims to be Chavel. Carosse attempts to denounce Charlot, win the favour of Th√©r√®se and stake a claim on the property.

Joe: A Real American Hero toyline, comic books and animated series. He is the G.I. Joe Team's Heavy Machine Gunner and debuted in 1984. Roadblock is one of the most prominent African-Americans in the series. He is portrayed by Dwayne Johnson in the 2013 film G.I. Joe: Retaliation. ==Profile== Roadblock's real name is Marvin F. Hinton and he was born in Biloxi, Mississippi. His primary function in G.I. Joe is as a heavy machine gunner and his secondary function is as a cook. Roadblock grew up with a large extended family, but was shy despite being a Boy Scout and singing in the church choir. Before he enlisted in the U.S. Army, Roadblock wanted to be a gourmet chef, and was working as a bouncer to earn enough money to attend Escoffier School in France. An army recruiter convinced him that he could learn to be a chef in the Army. After enlisting, Roadblock found Army food appalling, and transferred to infantry where he excelled at using heavy weapons. Roadblock is one of the biggest and strongest members of G.I. Joe, able to carry a fully loaded M2 Browning machine gun as a personal weapon, which can weigh up to 134 lbs, which usually requires a dedicated squad to transport and operate. Despite working in infantry, he still maintains his passion for making good food, and indulges in it while engaging in his secondary duty. He is a qualified expert with the M2 Browning .50 cal heavy machine gun, all Warsaw Pact heavy machine guns, M-16, and the M-1911A1 auto pistol. When the G.I. Joe team temporarily disbanded, Roadblock finally took the opportunity to become a gourmet chef. He wrote several cookbooks that became best-sellers, endorsed a line of cooking products under his name, and briefly hosted his own television cooking show. But when the team was reinstated, he happily hung up his chef's hat and rejoined them once again, staying on when the team was re-activated with a reduced roster. In the UK Action Force toy series, Roadblock is originally from the French Congo. As the Action Force and G.I. Joe toy lines merged, his profile altered to the American variant. In the animated series, Roadblock is inexplicably depicted as speaking in rhyme. He has a cousin named Heavy Duty. ==Toys== Roadblock was first released as an action figure in 1984. A second version of the figure was released in 1986, and the original figure was repainted and released as part of the \\"Tiger Force\\" line in 1988. A new version of Roadblock was released in 1992. This figure was repainted and released as part of the \\"Battle Corps\\" line in 1993. A new version of Roadblock was also released in 1993 as part of the Star Brigade line, which was repainted and re-released in 1994. Additionally, G.I. Joe issued a 12\\" Roadblock action figure for the 1992 Hall of Fame series that brought back the 12\\" G.I. Joe action figures. After that, G.I. Joe issued two other versions of the 12\\" Roadblock. Roadblock's head is bald and the face has a mustache. Some versions have a small goatee on the chin. An action figure called Double Blast used one of the Roadblock molds causing fear in fans that Hasbro lost the rights to Roadblock's name. Hasbro released a figure named Roadblock with Double Blast's information and real name on the filecard. All other versions of Roadblock have been remakes of the original. ==Comics== ===Marvel Comics=== Unlike the cartoon version, the comic book Roadblock does not spout rhymes, and is mentioned to have a fierce temper that \\"is a long time building, and a long time going\\". He has been known to say things like \\"Flush 'em out with a burst of fifty 'cal\\", meaning force enemies out into the open with concentrated fire from his .50 caliber machinegun. Roadblock first appeared in Marvel Comics' G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero #22 (April 1984). In that issue he is standing guard with Duke. They are overlooking the funeral of General Flagg, which is taking place at Arlington National Cemetery. Cobra attacks the funeral with a Rattler plane. Before anyone is hurt, Roadblock and Duke shoot it down, killing the pilot.G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero #22 (April 1984) In the next issue, Roadblock is part of a Joe team attempting to keep Cobra Commander prisoner in the Rocky Mountains. The ninja Storm Shadow manages to rescue the Commander, though he himself is captured by Roadblock.G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero #23 (May 1984) In issue #69, while in an American embassy that is being looted, Roadblock threatens a man who is intending to burn an American flag. Roadblock aims his weapon at the man's head, asking him to \\"desist in your actions or I will be obliged to reduce your head to a fine red mist.\\" When the threatened man points out how looters are stealing typewriters, Roadblock states that \\"Nobody ever died for a typewriter.\\" The man backs down.G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero #69 (March 1, 1988) In issues #77 and #78, he and other Joes battle American agents who are trying to frame and arrest every single G.I. Joe member. Roadblock is originally captured along with Hawk and ally General Hollingsworth. He violently escapes from captivity in order to organize the resistance movement. He manages to organize a group of Joe allies, along with the unexpected assistance of Destro, temporarily halting the conspiracy.G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero #77-78 (October 1988) In another incident, detailed in the Secret Missions series, Roadblock and Chuckles escort a Harvard- educated African prince back to his homeland, to help him stabilize a power struggle. Despite the Joes' assistance in saving the prince's life (who is a capable fighter in his own right), the man evicts all foreign embassies from his soil. In issue #145, Roadblock is chosen to go into space with the Star Brigade, a small team of Joe members. They travel on board the Joes' own space shuttle, the Defiant. The team fights rampaging robots inside an asteroid that threatens all of Earth. The Joes, along with the Oktober Guard, destroy the asteroid, saving billions of lives.G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero #145 (Feb. 1, 1994) Issue #154 is a Roadblock story in which, on his way to a cooking competition, he ends up on a civilian plane loaded with Cobra Vipers. Roadblock acquires a rocket launcher from the cargo hold, parachutes out of the plane, and destroys it with the weapon.G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero #154 (Nov. 1, 1994) ===IDW Publishing=== In a direct continuation of the original Marvel Comics series, still written by Larry Hama, Cobra is a worldwide popular paramilitary strike force and G.I.Joe is on the run. Roadblock kills a Cobra assassination team and hooks up with other Joes to steal proof for the United States President that Cobra is acting against America's interests.\\"G.I.Joe: A Real American Hero\\" #156 - 160 (2010) ===Devil's Due Comics=== The Joe team spends much time inactive. When Cobra is revealed to be a threat yet again, Roadblock, now making a living as a chef, eagerly answers the call to reform the team.\\"G.I.

It is in the historic county of Cumberland. According to the 2001 census the parish had a population of 411, reducing to 391 at the 2011 Census. The parish is large and includes the settlements of Roadhead and Sleetbeck. To the north the parish extends to the border with Scotland. To the east the parish bounds Northumberland. ==Etymology== The origin of the name Bewcastle can be traced accurately from its spelling in ancient documents. These show that it was originally \\"bothy/booth caster\\", which translates as \\"the Roman fort where there were bothies or shielings\\". 'C√¶ster' is \\"an Anglian side-form of OE 'ceaster', referring to the defences of the Roman camp...a medieval fortress was built within these defences...\\" The original form of the first element \\"was clearly 'Buth-' from ON b√∫√∞, 'booth'.\\" (OE=Old English; ON=Old Norse). Antiquarians, who did not have our access to well-catalogued and studied ancient documents, leapt at the chance to link the place name with a semi-mythological figure named Bueth, due to his romantic links with the prestigious Barony of Gilsland. The well-respected book The Place-names of CumberlandArmstrong, 1950, p..60-61 states that it is \\"impossible\\" for Bewcastle to be named after Bueth. ==Governance== Bewcastle is in the parliamentary constituency of Penrith and the Border. Neil Hudson was elected its Conservative Member of Parliament at the 2019 General Election, replacing Rory Stewart. Before Brexit, it was in the North West England European Parliamentary Constituency. ==Church and cross== St Cuthbert's churchyard contains the famous 7th-Century Bewcastle Cross. The sundial on its surface is the oldest in Britain, divided into the four 'tides' which governed the working day in medieval times. Its importance has been described by Nikolaus Pevsner thus; \\"The crosses of Bewcastle and Ruthwell ... are the greatest achievement of their date in the whole of Europe.\\"Pevsner, Nikolaus (1967) The buildings of England - Cumberland and Westmorland. Penguin Books. A reconstruction of the whole cross is located in the churchyard of St Mary's neo-Romanesque Church at Wreay near Carlisle, but this differs in style and detail from the original. Stephen MatthewsMatthews, S. 2007. Sarah Losh and Wreay Church; Bookcase, Carlisle calls the Wreay cross a \\"reinvention\\". ==Roman Fort== The parish is also known for its unusual hexagonal Bewcastle Roman Fort, which has been identified as Fanum Cocidi; its grassy ramparts can still be seen surrounding the churchyard. The fort was originally built from turf and timber and garrisoned by the First Nervian Cohort of Germans. It was built as an outlying defence of Hadrian's Wall to the south, to which it was linked by a road direct from the Roman fort of Banna (Birdoswald) on the wall, and a signal station on Gillalees Beacon between the two. The fort was later rebuilt in stone. Much of the stone was subsequently used to build a Norman castle within the northern perimeter of the fort. The ruins of Bewcastle Castle have recently been consolidated by English Heritage, and are accessible to the public without charge.'Bewcastle' in The Cumberland News supplement 6 June 2014. ==People== Two brothers born in Bewcastle, Joseph Armstrong (1816‚Äì1877) and George Armstrong (1822‚Äì1901), became noted steam locomotive engineers; their careers were spent mainly on the Great Western Railway. ==Gallery== File:Bewcastle - geograph.org.uk - 1945279.jpg Bewcastle castle File:Bewcastle - geograph.org.uk - 460783.jpg The castle File:Bewcastle church and cross from the west.jpgBewcastle church and cross from the west File:Bewcastle cross south perspective view.jpgBewcastle cross south perspective view File:Bewcastle church interior.jpgInterior of St Cuthbert's church, Bewcastle, Cumbria.

Hermann Winter as a fool-proof trainer for novice student pilots to experience solo flight. ==Design and development== The LF-1 was designed by Prof. Dr.-Ing. Hermann Winter and some of his students from the Technische Universit√§t Braunschweig (English:Technical University of Brunswick), Lower Saxony, Germany. Winter was a former chief engineer at the Bulgarian company, DAR (Drzhavnata Aeroplanna Rabotilnitsa in Cyrillic –î–ê–† ‚Äì –î—ä—Ä–∂–∞–≤–Ω–∞—Ç–∞ –∞–µ—Ä–æ–ø–ª–∞–Ω–Ω–∞ —Ä–∞–±–æ—Ç–∏–ª–Ω–∏—Ü–∞), where he created a line of aircraft; DAR-1, DAR-1A, DAR-2, DAR-3 Garvan, tri motor DAR-4, DAR 5 Brambar, DAR-6 and DAR-7 as well as the DAR Zdravka Vekilski and DAR Zdravka Toprakchiev gliders for the Bulgarian Army. The LF-1 is a parasol wing monoplane with a high-set tailplane, powered by a Z√ºndapp Z 9-092 engine delivering , able to operate from a airstrip. The two-piece wings are set at 16¬∞ dihedral and are supported by a pair of v cabane struts and v-struts either side from approx half-span to the lower centre fuselage. Full span leading edge slats extend automatically and full span trailing edge flaps / drooping ailerons can be extended manually by the pilot. The fixed tailwheel undercarriage attaches to the fuselage with long struts and oleo pneumatic shock absorbers. It was a proof-of-concept design for a 'fool-proof' trainer intended for novice pilots with only one hour of ground instruction, the hour being reduced to five-minutes for those who had already flown gliders, and was intended to be impossible to either stall or spin.Brown, Eric RN Wings on My Sleeve Orion books, 2006 p.157-158 ==Operational history== D-EBCG Fly by The first prototype, the LF-1 V1, was built in 1940 and made its maiden flight, piloted by Winter himself, in December 1940. Test flights stopped in November 1942 after part of the wing ruptured causing the aircraft to crash. In 1943 a second prototype, the V2, was built, receiving the registration D-YBAR. The aircraft was tested for military applications and was once even armed with a Panzerfaust 100 recoilless anti-tank weapon. At the end of World War II the Zaunk√∂nig registration D-YBAR was taken to the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE) at Farnborough for slow flying tests; given the British serial VX190., where amongst others, it was flown by Eric \\"Winkle\\" Brown CO Aero Flight, the aircraft also being soloed by the then-head of the RAE Aerodynamics Section, Handel Davies, after half an hour of ground instruction, and whose only previous piloting experience was as a pupil in a dual-control Miles Magister. It was sold to a British private owner in June 1949 as G-ALUA, and then to the Experimental Flying Group and to the Ultra Light Aircraft Association, subsequently in 1974 to an Irish owner, being registered EI-AYU, returning to Germany, in 1976, as D-EBCQ. As of 2008, it was preserved in the Deutsches Museum collection at Oberschleissheim near Munich. Encouraged by the positive British reviews Prof. Ing. Hermann Winter decided to build a third LF-1. The construction started in 1954 and it was the first new aircraft in Germany after the war to receive a certificate by the Luftfahrt-Bundesamt (LBA) in Braunschweig and the registration D-EBAR. Winter envisioned the Zaunk√∂nig as a People's Aircraft affordable for all (for a price of around DM 6,000). At the time a fourth LF-1 V4 was already under construction and it flew a few months after the fatal accident with the V3. It received its certificate in 1958 and the registration D-ECER. This aircraft flew for some years in Germany until grounded after the death of Prof. Ing. Winter in 1968. It was restored in 1980 and flew until 1999 as D-EBCG and as of 2008 preserved in the collection of the Internationales Luftfahrtmuseum Manfred Pflumm near Villingen- Schwenningen. ==Specifications (LF-1)== ==See also== * Tuc√°n T-1 * I.Ae. 31 Colibr√≠ ==References== ;Notes ;Bibliography * * * ==External links== * TU Brunswick (German) * (German) * (French) Category:1940s German civil trainer aircraft Category:Parasol-wing aircraft ","title":"Braunschweig LF-1 Zaunk√∂nig"},{"id":"3231813","text":"Excellent may refer to: *Excellence *Excellent ring, in mathematics *Excellent scheme, in mathematics *The Excellents, an early 1960s doo wop group * Excellent (album), a hip-hop and spoken word album by Propaganda *\\"Excellent\\", Mr. Burns' catchphrase on the cartoon The Simpsons ==See also== *Excellence (disambiguation) ","title":"Excellent"},{"id":"3231815","text":"Bewholme is a village and civil parish in the East Riding of Yorkshire, England.

It is part of the borough of Amsterdam-Zuid and situated west from the Leidseplein and the Museumplein. The park was opened in 1865 and originally named Nieuwe Park (English: New Park), but later renamed Vondelpark, after the 17th-century playwright and poet Joost van den Vondel. The park has around 10 million visitors annually. Within the park is an open- air theatre, a playground and several food service facilities. ==History== ===19th century=== In 1867 the vegetation in the new park had yet to flourish. The statue of Joost van den Vondel in the late 19th century In 1864 a group of citizens led by Christiaan Pieter van Eeghen established the Vereeniging tot Aanleg van een Rij- en Wandelpark (). They bought several hectares of grass- land and marshes at the rim of the city of Amsterdam, in order to create the new park. They assigned its design to the architect Jan David Zocher, and in 1865 \\"Het Nieuwe Park\\" (English: \\"The New Park\\") was opened free for members of the association and with other citizens paying an entrance fee. Two years after the park opened, in 1867, a statue of writer and playwright Joost van den Vondel by sculptor Louis Royer was placed in the park on a stand designed by architect Pierre Cuypers As a result, people started to call the park \\"Vondelspark\\" (English: \\"Vondel's Park\\"). In 1873 a bandstand was built. In the same year, brewer Gerard Adriaan Heineken was denied permission to open a bar in the park, so he built the Bierhuis Vondel (English: \\"Beer House Vondel\\") in a nearby street in what is now Vondelstraat 41. The last part of the park was designed by Louis Paul Zocher, Jan David Zocher's son, and was realized from 1875 to 1877.Plan for the expansion of the Vondelpark by J.D. and L.P. Zocher at the Amsterdam City Archives The park then arrived at its current size of 47 hectares. The English garden style design of the Zochers has been roughly maintained, although in the late 19th century the elongated park had a stream of water running through it with many paths and bushes alongside it. In 1878 the Pavillon (English: \\"Pavilion\\") was built to replace a wooden chalet built by Louis Paul Zocher. The Pavillon is currently known as the Vondelparkpaviljoen (English: \\"Vondelpark Pavilion\\"). The park's name officially became \\"Vondelpark\\" (English: \\"Vondel Park\\") in 1880. Already in the 1880s and 1890s cycling in the park was causing problems. The park management tried to resolve this with restrictive measures against cyclists, such as special bike paths, limited opening hours, and fines for cyclists that were going faster than a horse's trot. It was only after mediation of the Algemene Nederlandsche Wielrijders-Bond (English: \\"General Dutch Cyclists Union\\"), that helped fund the park, that a park guard was installed and cyclists were again permitted to cycle normally. ===20th century=== The Blauwe Theehuis in 2010 In 1936, a rose garden was created in the center of the park. One year later in 1937, the Blauwe Theehuis (English: \\"Blue Tearoom\\") was opened. This tearoom is a round modernist building, designed by the architectural office Baanders. In the following years the overall maintenance of the park became too expensive for the Vereniging tot aanleg van een rij- en wandelpark (English: \\"Association for the creation of a park for riding and strolling\\"), due to an intensified use, and in 1953 the association donated the park to the city of Amsterdam. The landscape architect Egbert Mos renovated the Vondelpark for the city in the 1950s. The purpose was improve the park for both usage and maintenance. Small bushes were grouped into larger bushes, superfluous paths were removed, and the rose garden was renovated. Also the stream of water in the \\"trunk\\" near the northern entrance of the park was removed. In the 1960s children's playgrounds were created. During the flower power era in the 1960s/1970s the Vondelpark became a symbol of a place where \\"everything is possible and (almost) everything is allowed\\".Documentation regarding hippies sleeping in the Vondelpark at the Amsterdam City Archives In the 1980s an open-air theatre was built. The Vondelpark received the status of rijksmonument (English: \\"state monument\\") in 1996. ===21st century=== People in the park on a Sunday in September 2008 In the 1990s the number of visitors grew to approximately 10 million visitors annually. The grassy areas are used as sports field and the paths as bike paths. Consequently, the city renovated the park from 1999 to 2010. The purpose was to beautify the park and lessen the need for maintenance. The renovation took more than ten years in order to increase convenience for visitors and for the security of resident animals. Starting in September 2008, adults were legally allowed to have sex in the park,Quirky News from Ananova as long as they \\"[took] their garbage with them afterwards and never [had] intercourse near the playground.

It is the largest and most expensive amusement park in Southeast Asia, built and funded by the Bruneian government for $1 billion. During its first few years of operation, the park was completely free, with no admission fees and free rides. In 2009, it was reported that the number of visitors and tourists had dropped significantly. The owners introduced a one-time B$15 admission fee and a ride ticketing system. Currently, the theme park has reduced its footprint to Phase 1 and 2, the original Playground. It has revised its ride admission with a new ticket card system. The park is once again free entry to the general public with a fee to use a ride or other attraction. An $8 ticket card has 4 slots and 1 free slot (effectively allowing one guest to use 5 rides/attractions - or 2 guests to use two rides with one extra). The $10 ticket card has 5 slots plus 3 free slots (which means a guest can use 8 rides attractions and so on). ==History== Jerudong Park first opened in 1994. Michael Jackson performed a free concert on 16 July 1996 in front of 60,000 people. The concert, part of his HIStory World Tour, was in celebration of the 50th birthday of Hassanal Bolkiah, the Sultan of Brunei, and was attended by the Brunei royal family, though the Sultan himself did not attend. Jackson returned to perform another show on New Year's Eve 1996. On August 24, 1996, singer Whitney Houston performed at the park for the wedding of Princess Rashidah, the eldest daughter of the Sultan of Brunei. It was a very momentous event that was attended by locals and foreigners. Janet Jackson performed a private concert during her Velvet Rope Tour to celebrate the twenty-first birthday of Princess Hamidah of the Brunei royal family. An exclusive audio recording of the show was issued to all those in attendance. In August 2006, the company began to implement a revitalization program. It started with the launching of the GIGGLES led by their Manager Mr. Wilhelm Bayona, their in- house entertainment team. The team is composed of seven entertainers from the Philippines with various artistic and entertainment skills. The team specialised in family entertainment programs and activities that appealed to school children and schools. This served as a means of regenerating interest in the park. In December, management began a special program on the weekends featuring local artists as the main performers. The program, called Family Night, featured singers, magicians, and dancers who hails from Brunei. The program attracted more than 6,000 people on a single evening. In 2007, the Park became the venue for a series of activities called Kids' Day. Although the main target was children, it drew families as well because of the \\"family\\" factor - the games involved adults such as moms and dads as well. The GIGGLES also began appearing regularly during activities at the Mall and around the country at shopping centers. By the end of 2007, the Giggles had made appearances in schools, public events, and party functions. In late 2008, JPCC launched its Family Concert Nights (later renamed \\"Local is Best - Family Entertainment Night\\") featuring local talents. The program's goal was to provide local artists a family friendly venue to perform and create an audience for their music. The shows are reviewed and approved by a Censorship Board. On December 12, 2009, JPCC Management introduced a new ticket system. Entrance to the Playground was made free, and guests who wanted to use the attractions had the option to buy an $8 \\"4 plus 1 ride\\" ticket, and a $10 \\"5 plus 3 ride\\" ticket. By the end of 2010, attendance to the park was up to 144,000 people annually. This figures are based on the actual park admittance and ticket sales. The park underwent an internal remodelling in 2011. The park was reopened on March 19, 2011 with new family oriented attractions including a type of bumper car and pedal boats, an electric train, and scooters. That month also saw a record high of over 70,000 visitors. ==References== Category:Amusement parks in Brunei Category:1994 establishments in Brunei Category:Amusement parks opened in 1994 ","title":"Jerudong Park"},{"id":"3231831","text":"Bexton is a village and civil parish in the unitary authority of Cheshire East and the ceremonial county of Cheshire, England.

Married to a Polish princess, John III had Roman Catholic leanings, and the college, which was to train clergymen, was located to the old Franciscan monastery on Riddarholmen, and employed Jesuit teachers, such as Laurentius Nicolai. As the king's enthusiasm for Roman Catholicism waned from about 1580, larger number of Protestant teachers started to be employed, especially during the years 1583‚Äì1587. When Uppsala University, which had been suppressed by the king during the 1580s, was reopened in 1593, the remaining professors of the college were transferred to the university.

Pneumatic artificial muscles (PAMs) are contractile or extensional devices operated by pressurized air filling a pneumatic bladder. In an approximation of human muscles, PAMs are usually grouped in pairs: one agonist and one antagonist. PAMs were first developed (under the name of McKibben Artificial Muscles) in the 1950s for use in artificial limbs. The Bridgestone rubber company (Japan) commercialized the idea in the 1980s under the name of Rubbertuators. The retraction strength of the PAM is limited by the sum total strength of individual fibers in the woven shell. The exertion distance is limited by the tightness of the weave; a very loose weave allows greater bulging, which further twists individual fibers in the weave. One example of a complex configuration of air muscles is the Shadow Dexterous Handhttp://www.shadowrobot.com/products/dexterous-hand/ developed by the Shadow Robot Company, which also sells a range of muscles for integration into other projects/systems. == Advantages == PAMs are very lightweight because their main element is a thin membrane. This allows them to be directly connected to the structure they power, which is an advantage when considering the replacement of a defective muscle. If a defective muscle has to be substituted, its location will always be known and its substitution becomes easier. This is an important characteristic, since the membrane is connected to rigid endpoints, which introduces tension concentrations and therefore possible membrane ruptures. Another advantage of PAMs is their inherent compliant behaviour: when a force is exerted on the PAM, it \\"gives in\\", without increasing the force in the actuation. This is an important feature when the PAM is used as an actuator in a robot that interacts with a human, or when delicate operations have to be carried out. In PAMs the force is not only dependent on pressure but also on their state of inflation. This is one of the major advantages; the mathematical model that supports the PAMs functionality is a non-linear system, which makes them much easier than conventional pneumatic cylinder actuators to control precisely. The relationship between force and extension in PAMs mirrors what is seen in the length-tension relationship in biological muscle systems. The compressibility of the gas is also an advantage since it adds compliance. As with other pneumatic systems PAM actuators usually need electric valves and a compressed air generator. The loose-weave nature of the outer fiber shell also enables PAMs to be flexible and to mimic biological systems. If the surface fibers are very badly damaged and become unevenly distributed leaving a gap, the internal bladder may inflate through the gap and rupture. As with all pneumatic systems it is important that they are not operated when damaged. == Hydraulic operation == Although the technology is primarily pneumatically (gas) operated, there is nothing that prevents the technology from also being hydraulically (liquid) operated. Using an incompressible fluid increases system rigidity and reduces compliant behavior. In 2017, such a device was presented by Bridgestone and the Tokyo Institute of Technology,Development of a Hydraulic Drive High-Power Artificial Muscle through the Cabinet Office Tough Robotics Challenge with a claimed strength-to-weight ratio five to ten times higher than for conventional electric motors and hydraulic cylinders. ==See also== *Artificial muscle *Electroactive polymer ==Notes== ==External links== *Pneumatic Artificial Muscles: actuators for robotics and automation *Bas Overvelde's ballooning muscles *Pneumatic artificial muscles * Biped robot powered by pneumatic artificial muscles *Soft Robot Manipulators with McKibben muscles *Air Muscles from Images Company *Air Muscles from Shadow Robots Category:Automation Category:Robotics hardware ","title":"Pneumatic artificial muscles"},{"id":"3231889","text":"V90 may refer to: * V.90, an ITU-T recommendation for data communication over the telephone network * Hanlin eReader V90, an ebook reader * Vestas V90, a three-bladed upwind wind turbine generator series * Volvo V90, a car ","title":"V90"},{"id":"3231891","text":"Bickerstaffe is a village and civil parish in the West Lancashire district of Lancashire, England.

Talalikhin became a fighter pilot in the Soviet Air Forces in the late 1930s, flying the Polikarpov I-153 during the Winter War. He served in the air defense of Moscow during World War II with an aviation regiment of the Soviet Air Defence Forces. He became one of the first Soviet aviation heroes of the war after ramming a German bomber at night with his Polikarpov I-16, but was shot down and killed in late October while flying a Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-3. Talalikhin claimed three victories during the Winter War and four in the air defense of Moscow. ==Early life and military career== Talalikhin was born on 18 September 1918 in the village of Teplovka in Saratov Governorate to a peasant family. In 1924, he and his family moved to Volsk, where he studied at its Secondary School No. 1. In the summer of 1933, Talalikhin and his family again moved to Moscow, where he graduated from the factory school of the Moscow Meat Processing Plant in 1934. Talalikhin worked at the plant from 1934 to 1937; he joined a factory gliding group in September 1935 and with a Komsomol direction took flying lessons at the Proletarsky District flying club. Talalikhin made his first solo flight in a Polikarpov U-2 in June 1937. After joining the Red Army in December of that year, Talalikhin graduated from the 2nd Borisoglebsk Military Aviation School of Pilots in December 1938 as a Junior Lieutenant. He became a junior pilot in the 3rd Squadron of the 27th Fighter Aviation Regiment (IAP), part of the Air Forces of the Moscow Military District, flying the Polikarpov I-153 biplane. With the 27th IAP he fought in the Winter War of November 1939-March 1940, flying 47 sorties and claiming three individual victories in addition to one shared. For his actions, Talalikhin received the Order of the Red Star. In the spring of 1941, he graduated from courses for flight commanders, and joined the 177th Fighter Aviation Regiment PVO, then forming in the Moscow area, as a flight commander in its 1st Squadron. == World War II == In 1941, during the first few weeks of fighting on the Eastern Front during World War II, he was first a flight commander, then the deputy commander of the 1st Squadron, flying with 177th Fighter Aviation Regiment PVO of the Soviet Air Defence Forces, providing air defense for Moscow. Talalikhin flew his first combat mission on 22 July. He downed a Junkers Ju 88 on the night of 5‚Äì6 August. On the night of 6‚Äì7 August 1941, flying a Soviet Air Defense Forces Polikarpov I-16 fighter over Moscow, Talalikhin rammed a German Heinkel He 111 bomber after running out of ammunition, destroying both aircraft. Wounded by machine-gun fire from the German bomber, he parachuted to safety, landing in a small lake. He was reported as the first pilot in history to ram an enemy aircraft at night, and was feted in Moscow by Soviet media as the first major Soviet air hero of World War II. However, Pyotr Yeremeyev, another Moscow air defense pilot, had earlier performed the same feat on 29 July. On 8 August, Talalikhin was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union and the Order of Lenin. He soon became a squadron commander in the 177th. Subsequently, Talalikhin began flying the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-3. On 27 October, he led a mixed group of two MiG-3s and six I-16s in an action over Podolsk, covering ground troops. Near the village of Kamenka, he descended to attack German positions, but the Soviet aircraft were ambushed by six Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighters attacking from a higher altitude. Talalikhin claimed two Messerschmitt Bf 109s before being shot down and killed by another. His body was sent to Moscow and cremated, and on 23 February 1959 the urn with his ashes was moved to the Novodevichy Cemetery. == Legacy == On 30 August 1948, Talalikhin was permanently added to the muster list of the 1st Squadron of the 177th Fighter Aviation Regiment. Monuments to him were built in Moscow and Podolsk, and an obelisk was placed at the 43rd kilometer of the Warsaw Highway, over which the ramming took place. Streets were named for Talalikhin in Moscow, Kaliningrad, Volgograd, Krasnoyarsk, Vladivostok, and Borisoglebsk. Parts of the He 111 that he downed by ramming are displayed in the Central Armed Forces Museum. In June 2014, the wreckage of the I-16 that Talalikhin rammed the bomber in was discovered in a forest 20 kilometers from Moscow. ==Notes== ==References== * * * Category:1918 births Category:1941 deaths Category:People from Volsky District Category:People from Volsky Uyezd Category:Soviet Air Force officers Category:Russian aviators Category:Pilots who performed an aerial ramming Category:Soviet military personnel killed in World War II Category:Heroes of the Soviet Union Category:Recipients of the Order of Lenin Category:Recipients of the Order of the Red Banner Category:Burials at Novodevichy Cemetery ","title":"Viktor Talalikhin"},{"id":"3231911","text":"Bickerton is a village and civil parish in the unitary authority of Cheshire East and the ceremonial county of Cheshire, England, about north of Whitchurch in Shropshire.

He was transported to Maryland but escaped back to Britain, and joined Bonnie Prince Charlie's army on its 1745 march to Derby, before returning to Bickleigh until his death. He is buried in the graveyard.Stabb, John (1908) Some Old Devon Churches, (1908-16) The church is home to carved bench-ends depicting scenes of medieval life. Major John Gabriel Stedman, author of a History of Surinam, d. 1797, was buried here in an unmarked grave near the vestry door. == Attractions == Farmer Nick Lees and his family have constructed several maize mazes in a field near the village. The subjects include Elizabeth II's Golden Jubilee, the 200th anniversary of the Battle of Trafalgar, the bicentenary of the birth of Isambard Kingdom Brunel and 100th anniversary of the Scouting movement. It is also the location of one of the biggest vineyards in the South West of England, Yearlstone, which has a state of the art winery, wine bar and cafe. Yearlstone is now 3.5 hectares, and hosts Devon Wine Week in the last week in May each year, a celebration of local food culture. To the northwest of the village on the River Exe is The Fisherman's Cot. == Popular culture == A persistent myth among the residents of the area is that the village's medieval bridge over the Exe inspired Paul Simon to write Bridge Over Troubled Water; Simon is known to have stayed in the village in the mid-sixties. Although Art Garfunkel denied the rumour in a 2003 interview, stating that Simon had taken the phrase from a Baptist hymn, it is entirely possible that Simon intended more than one allusion. ==References== ==External links== The Bickleigh village website.

The \\"item in question\\" that Adam's father's letter leads him to acquire from a safe deposit box in Switzerland is a precious Russian Orthodox icon made long ago for the Russian tsars which by misadventure came into the possession of Hermann G√∂ring sometime in the 1930s. Following the Second World War G√∂ring wanted Scott's father (one of his jailers at Nuremberg) to have it in token of his kind treatment and because G√∂ring realized Scott's father would be unfairly blamed for his pre-execution suicide. But the icon contains something that even G√∂ring did not dream of: the only official Russian copy of a secret codice to the Alaska Purchase treaty by which the United States purchased Alaska from Russia in 1867. \\"Seward's Folly\\" turns out to have not been a true purchase at all, but a 99-year lease akin to the British hold on Hong Kong, with a right of return to Russia (now part of the Soviet Union) if they can only retrieve their copy before the lease deadline, only days away. == Plot == In June 1966 disgraced British colonel Gerald Scott leaves a mysterious letter to his only son, Adam Scott. Adam's mother tells him that she had already asked his father to destroy the letter. Later, Adam opens the letter to discover that his father was one of Hermann G√∂ring's jailers at Nuremberg following the end of World War Two. The evening before his execution, G√∂ring requested a meeting with Scott in order to give him an envelope containing the location of the tsar's icon of St. George and the Dragon in a deposit box in a vault of the Swiss bank Bischoff et Cie. Afterwards, G√∂ring commits suicide via poisoned cigar and the suspicion falling on Scott for his interaction with G√∂ring leads Scott to resign from the military. The colonel then leaves the issue of the letter to his son to deal with. Adam decides to visit Switzerland to retrieve the icon and has it valued to potentially sell it. However, he is ambushed by KGB agent Major Alexander Romanov, who murders his German girlfriend Heidi and tracks Scott through the country. Romanov has been sent to get the icon by any means necessary. The Swiss police suspect Scott of murdering his girlfriend, causing him to become a fugitive as he attempts to escape the country. Scott hitchhikes with a musician on tour, Robin Beresford of the Royal Philharmonic Society whose bus eventually deposits him at a village near Frankfurt in Germany. Climbing his way to the highway, Scott is shot at by Romanov and slightly injured. He finds an English family to travel with who take him back over the Swiss border and then to Dijon in France. At Dijon, Scott accidentally drops the icon, splitting it open to reveal the Russian copy of the Alaska Purchase, signed by the tsar himself and dated for 20 June 1966. After this discovery, Scott becomes more determined to get to England. A call with London means that a plane will land at a disused aerodrome near the city to fetch him. The previous English family take him to the airfield where a plane with six SAS soldiers lands. The soldiers disembark and Scott boards, with Romanov and his aide attacking just as the plane lifts off. Damage to the fuel tank causes the plane to crash land soon after take off, with Scott and the injured pilot going their separate ways. Romanov tricks the SAS soldiers and American reinforcements into shooting at each other. However, his aide, Valchek, is wounded in the battle and eventually put out of his misery by Romanov. Meanwhile, President Johnson learns of the Russian ambassador's deposition of 712 million dollars worth of gold bullion in a New York bank and request for a meeting with the Secretary of State on 20 June, in preparation for returning Alaska to the Soviet Union. Adam makes his way to Paris and is arrested by the French police there, although he assumes that he will be taken to the British embassy and debriefed there. Colonel Pollard arrives to fetch Scott from the police station yet turns out to be an imposter who defected to the Soviets and Scott is knocked out. He awakens in a soundproofed room in the Russian Embassy and finds Romanov, Pollard and their colleague Stavinsky. Scott is tortured to the point of death yet refuses to give up the icon's location, even when offered papers that exonerate his father from assisting G√∂ring to his death. He escapes from the embassy by knocking out Pollard and climbing over the wall at night. After retrieving the icon from the Louvre, he hires a car to travel to the French coast to cross to England. The date is 19 June. Adam makes a feint towards Boulogne to throw off Romanov and instead heads towards Dunkerque, where he meets with the musician from before, Robin. She helps him to travel across the Channel to England and accompanies him after the crossing. However, Romanov learns of the deception and follows them with Pollard in tow. Scott goes to Robin's home in Waterloo East in London in order to capture Pollard, whom Romanov has sent to ambush Robin when she gets home. After learning of Romanov's whereabouts from Pollard, Scott calls Romanov at the Soviet Embassy and negotiates with him; if Romanov exchanges an inferior copy of the icon, painted in the early 20th century and which the Soviets have been guarding for 50 years, and the papers proving Colonel Scott's innocence, Adam will return the real icon and the Alaska Purchase copy to him. Romanov agrees and the transaction takes place at Tower Bridge. However, Scott had, prior to the swap, performed a switch of the icons that results in Romanov, unknowingly giving the real icon back to Scott (with the Purchase inside) and Scott giving the copy back. Romanov, convinced he has the true icon, triumphantly heads to the Soviet Ambassador's office to report his success while Scott travels to Heathrow Airport to watch Romanov take off for Moscow. Romanov is assassinated on board by a British agent and Scott is stunned to learn that the agent is a friend who works at the bank. One month later, Scott and Robin are having the icon auctioned. The Soviets do not have the real icon and were unable to claim Alaska without their copy of the Alaska Purchase. The US therefore retained the state. Scott and Robin receive fourteen thousand pounds for the icon. ==Characters== ‚Ä¢Captain Adam Scott, MC - Scott is a decorated officer of the Royal Wessex Regiment and known for his father, Colonel Gerald Scott and the stigma brought on him by his father's acts. Scott ends up in possession of the famous icon of St. George and the Dragon, by Rublev, and is pursued by the KGB. He has a clear, calm demeanour and devises schemes to stay ahead of the Soviets. ‚Ä¢Major Alexander Petrovich Romanov - An agent of the KGB sent after Scott to obtain the icon and its contents. Fluent in English, German and French in addition to his native Russian, he has an immense passion for catching Scott after finding that his mission is to do so and has no qualms about murdering those who get in his way. ==External links== * Jeffrey Archer's official website Category:1986 British novels Category:Books about Alaska Category:Novels by Jeffrey Archer Category:British spy novels Category:British thriller novels Category:Hodder & Stoughton books ","title":"A Matter of Honour"},{"id":"3231960","text":"Bickley is a former civil parish, now in the parish of No Man's Heath and District, in the unitary authority of Cheshire West and Chester and ceremonial county of Cheshire, England.

It was activated on 15 March 2004, after what was effectively a redesignation of its predecessor command, Allied Forces Southern Europe (AFSOUTH), originally formed in 1951.Franco Veltri, AFSOUTH 1951‚Äì2004: Over Fifty Years Working for Peace and Stability , AFSOUTH, April 2004 In NATO Military Command Structure terms, AFSOUTH was a \\"Major Subordinate Command\\".Allied Command Structures in the New NATO, DIANE Publishing edition, 18. The commander of JFC Naples reports to the Supreme Allied Commander Europe at the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe, Casteau, Belgium. ==History== === Cold War === Arms of Headquarters, Allied Forces Southern Europe Originally, Allied Forces Southern Europe was one of two major NATO commands in the Mediterranean area, the other being Allied Forces Mediterranean based on the island of Malta, responsible for naval activities in the region. While Admiral Robert B. Carney of the U.S. Navy was appointed as Commander-in-Chief Allied Forces Southern Europe (CinCAFSOUTH) on 19 June 1951, AFMED was not activated until 1953. The delay was due to negotiations and compromises between the Americans and the British, who wished to retain one of their commanders over Britain's traditional sea lines of communication stretching through the Mediterranean to the Suez Canal and beyond. From 1951 to 2003, the Commander-in-Chief of Allied Forces Southern Europe was always a United States Navy admiral, based at Naples, who also held the US Navy position of Commander-in-Chief United States Naval Forces Europe and functioned as the Navy service component commander for United States European Command within the US-only chain of command. AFSOUTH headquarters was established at Nisida island, Naples. The initial command arrangements for AFSOUTH consisted of the classic three land, sea, and air headquarters preferred by Eisenhower. Allied Land Forces Southern Europe (LANDSOUTH), Allied Naval Forces Southern Europe (NAVSOUTH), and Allied Air Forces Southern Europe (AIRSOUTH) were all established in Italy.Pedlow, Evolution of NATO's Command Structure 1951-2009. Greece and Turkey joined the alliance in early 1952. On 8 September 1952, a new allied land command, Allied Land Forces South-Eastern Europe (LANDSOUTHEAST), was created with its headquarters in Izmir, Turkey, under the command of a U.S. officer, Lieutenant General Willard G. Wyman. Under this command, with its headquarters in Izmir assisted by the subordinate Thessaloniki Advanced Command Post, were to be most of the Greek and Turkish armies in case of war. The first AIRSOUTH commander became U.S. Major General David M. Schlatter, USAF. On 14 October 1953, the Sixth Allied Tactical Air Force was also established in Izmir, commanded by Major General R.E.L. Easton, USAF, and responsible to Allied Air Forces Southern Europe for the air defence of Greece and Turkey. Three national air Commands were assigned to it: the Turkish 1st and 3rd Tactical Air Forces, and the Greek Air Force's Royal Hellenic 28th Tactical Air Force. In terms of actual forces this meant two Greek wings and four Turkish fighter- bomber groups of F-84 aircraft, plus some B-26A Mosquitoes. Later in 1953, the various national naval forces within Allied Forces Mediterranean were organised into six Sub-Principal Subordinate Commands (Sub-PSCs), each commanded by an Admiral (including one French (MEDOC), one Greek, one Turkish, one Italian and two British). In time of war, CINCAFMED would be responsible for securing the Sea lines of communications throughout the Mediterranean Sea. Some of AFSOUTH's first exercises took place in 1952. Operation Ancient Wall was a series of military maneuvers involving ground small unit tactical training, land-based tactical air support, and carrier-based air support under the overall command of Admiral Carney.\\"The NATO Exercises, Part 1\\" Flight (September 26, 1952) p. 402-404 Exercise Grand Slam was a combined naval exercise held in the Mediterranean Sea between 25 February to 16 March 1952. The exercise included allied warships escorting three convoys of supply ships which were subjected to repeated simulated air and submarine attacks, as well as anti-submarine warfare (ASW) operations and naval gunfire shore bombardment. Operation Longstep was a ten-day naval exercise held in the Mediterranean Sea held during November 1952. It involved over 170 warships and 700 aircraft, and it featured a large-scale amphibious assault along the western coast of Turkey. 1953 AFSOUTH exercises included: * \\"Italic Weld\\" ‚Äî a combined air-naval-ground exercise in northern Italy involving the United States, Italy, Turkey, and Greece * \\"Weldfast\\" ‚Äî a combined amphibious landing exercise in the Mediterranean Sea involving British, Greek, Italian, Turkish, and U.S. naval forces In 1957, Operation Deep Water simulated the defence of the Dardanelles from a Soviet attack. The exercise included an 8,000 strong amphibious landing. The drawdown of the British Mediterranean Fleet, the military difficulties of the politically-decided command structure, and the withdrawal of the French from the military command structure forced a rearrangement of the command arrangements in the southern region. Allied Forces Mediterranean was disbanded on 5 June 1967, and all forces in the south and the Mediterranean assigned to AFSOUTH. AFSOUTH continued to conduct exercises in the 1960s and 1970s, among which was exercise 'Dawn Patrol,' a five-nation naval and air exercise conducted throughout the Mediterranean in 1974.Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships, America III , accessed July 2011 The U.S. contribution to the exercise was based on the USS America carrier battle group. During the 1960s Exercise Deep Furrow appears to have been held annually. Deep Furrow, will be conducted from 20‚Äì29 September 1973 in the southern region of Allied Command Europe. Forces from Greece, Turkey and other countries in AF South Command will participate in Exercise Deep Furrow 73, which is scheduled annually by CINCSOUTH. Land forces will hold maneuvers in Greek and Turkish Thrace and naval Force will exercise in the Eastern Mediterranean, including the Aegean Sea; naval activities will include amphibious and carrier operations. As part of the exercise, ground units will be airlifted from their home stations in the United Kingdom and the United States to northwestern Turkey, where Turkish National Forces will execute plans for receiving them. Turkish National Forces will also conduct operations with Hellenic Armed Forces and NATO air units providing fighter-bomber and reconnaissance support throughout the area of operations. Highlights of the exercise in Turkish Thrace will be a multi-national amphibious landing on 25 September 1973 and a multinational airborne operation on 26 September 1973. From 1967 the overall shape of AFSOUTH did not significantly change until the command was renamed in 2004. There were five principal subordinate commands (PSCs).NATO Handbook, 50th Anniversary Edition, NATO Office of Information and Press, November 1999, p.252, and IISS Military Balance, 1975-76, p.16-17 The number rose to six when Greece was taking part in the military structure; Greece withdrew from the NATO military structure after the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in 1974, and after some behind the scenes negotiating by NATO officials, returned in October 1980. Two land commands, Allied Land Forces Southern Europe and Allied Land Forces Southeastern Europe, were tasked to defend Italy and Turkey respectively. Each was directly responsible to Commander-in-Chief, AFSOUTH, and supported by a tactical air force, Fifth Allied Tactical Air Force in Italy and Sixth Allied Tactical Air Force in Turkey. The two allied tactical air forces were under an overall air command, Allied Air Forces Southern Europe, headquartered at Naples in Italy under a United States Air Force officer, ComAirSouth, responsible himself to CinCAFSOUTH.Operation Deny Flight was directed by Allied Forces Southern Europe (AFSOUTH) in Naples, under the command of the Commander-in-Chief of Allied Forces Southern Europe. Smith and Boorda, however, delegated day to day authority to Allied Air Forces Southern Europe (AIRSOUTH) commanded by Lieutenant General Joseph W. Ashy (until 1994) and then Lt. Gen Michael Ryan. While AIRSOUTH maintained day to day command, \\"mission tasking and operational control\\" were delegated to the commander of the NATO Fifth Allied Tactical Air Force (5ATAF). ComAirSouth held the U.S. national appointment of Commander Sixteenth Air Force for a long period. Due to political considerations, command of the naval forces in the region was split. Allied Naval Forces Southern Europe, at Naples, operated most of the NATO allies' naval forces in the Mediterranean under an Italian admiral. But due to the U.S. desire to retain control of their nuclear-armed naval forces,Sean Maloney thesis, Securing Command of the Sea, University of New Brunswick, 1992 the United States Sixth Fleet reported directly to CinCAFSOUTH, supported by a separate headquarters named Naval Striking and Support Forces Southern Europe (STRIKFORSOUTH). The sixth command was an Allied command responsible for the land defence of Greece, named Allied Land Forces South-Central Europe or LANDSOUTHCENT. However it is not certain that it actually was ever operational, with the 1998/99 NATO Handbook listing it as 'yet to be activated.' Below these PSCs were smaller headquarters such as Maritime Air Forces, Mediterranean, at Sigonella, Sicily, responsible for coordination of the aerial anti-submarine effort, Submarine Forces, South, and the Naval On- Call Force Mediterranean, a multinational escort squadron activated at intervals. === Structure in 1989 === Command Structure of AFSOUTH in 1989 (click to enlarge) At the end of the Cold War consisted of the following commands: * Allied Command Europe, in Mons, Belgium ** Allied Forces Southern Europe (AFSOUTH), in Naples, Italy *** Allied Land Forces Southern Europe (LANDSOUTH), in Verona, Italy **** 3rd Italian Corps, in Milan **** 4th Italian Alpine Corps, in Bolzano **** 5th Italian Corps, in Vittorio Veneto *** Allied Land Forces South-Eastern Europe (LANDSOUTHEAST), in ƒ∞zmir, Turkey **** 1st Turkish Army, in Istanbul **** 2nd Turkish Army in Malatya **** 3rd Turkish Army, in Erzincan *** Allied Land Forces South-Central Europe (LANDSOUTHCENT) in Larissa, Greece *** Allied Air Forces Southern Europe (AIRSOUTH), in Naples, Italy **** Fifth Allied Tactical Air Force (5 ATAF), in Vicenza, Italy **** Sixth Allied Tactical Air Force (6 ATAF), in ƒ∞zmir, Turkey **** Seventh Allied Tactical Air Force (7 ATAF) in Larissa, Greece, a planned command for the Greek Air Force, but never actually established *** Allied Naval Forces Southern Europe (NAVSOUTH), in Naples, Italy, with the following national commands of Mediterranean NATO members: **** Commander Gibraltar Mediterranean (COMGIBMED), in Gibraltar, under a Royal Navy Rear Admiral, who doubled as Commander British Forces Gibraltar **** Commander Western Mediterranean (COMMEDWEST), under a French Navy admiral, until 1962 in Algiers, then Toulon, after France left NATO's integrated command structure in 1966 the command was absorbed by NAVSOUTH **** Commander Central Mediterranean (COMEDCENT), in Naples, under an Italian Navy admiral **** Commander Eastern Mediterranean (COMEDEAST), in Athens, under a Greek Navy admiral **** Commander South-Eastern Mediterranean (COMMEDSOUTHEAST), under a British admiral in Malta, after the disbanding of the Mediterranean Fleet, the command was absorbed by NAVSOUTH **** Commander North-eastern Mediterranean (COMEDNOREAST), in Ankara, under a Turkish Navy admiral (includes the Black Sea) **** Commander Maritime Air Forces Mediterranean (COMMARAIRMED), at Naval Air Station Sigonella, Italy, under Commander US Navy Fleet Air Wing Mediterranean **** Commander Submarines Mediterranean (COMSUBMED), in Naples, under Commander US Navy Submarine Group 8 *** Naval Striking and Support Forces Southern Europe (STRIKFORSOUTH), in Naples, Italy, centered around the US Navy Sixth Fleet === Post Cold War === From 1992 AFSOUTH was heavily involved in NATO operations in the Balkans, initially with NATO seaborne enforcement of a UN arms embargo, Operation 'Maritime Monitor,' which began in July 1992. This operation was fused with a similar Western European Union effort and thus became Operation Sharp Guard from July 1993. AFSOUTH also directed activities such as Operation Deny Flight from AIRSOUTH headquarters in Italy. Commander-in-Chief AFSOUTH directed the NATO peacekeeping missions in Bosnia & Hercegovina, IFOR and SFOR, from December 1995. While technically in charge of KFOR from mid-1999, General Sir Mike Jackson's autobiography, Soldier, indicates General Wesley Clark at SHAPE in Belgium directly supervised many of KFOR's activities, without going through AFSOUTH, at least during the Allied Rapid Reaction Corps' tour as HQ KFOR in 1999. Beginning 10 July 1951, Headquarters Allied Land Forces Southern Europe was responsible for the defence of the Italian North-Eastern sector, in cooperation with other NATO nations. During the intervening 40 years, the HQ produced plans and studies to counter a potential invasion by the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact. After 53 years in the city of Verona, what had become Joint Command South (JCS) closed its doors on 15 June 2004. Also closing was Joint Headquarters Southwest in Madrid and Joint Headquarters Southeast/Joint Command Southeast in Izmir. ===Joint Force Command Naples=== The reorganisation of AFSOUTH as JFC Naples in 2004 was a part of NATO‚Äôs transformation, initiated by the Prague summit of 2002, aimed at adapting the allied military structure to the operational challenges of coalition warfare, to face the emerging threats in the new millennium. The new NATO Command Structure is leaner, and focused on conducting a much wider range of missions. NHQ Sarajevo remains operational, and also NATO Headquarters Tirana, an outgrowth of the former Kosovo Force (KFOR) Communications Zone West originally established in 1999. Communication Zone West was retitled NHQ Tirana on 17 June 2002,NHQT Factsheets and it now performs a Defence Reform and Security Sector Reform advisory role, aiming to support the Albanian Armed Forces, now a member of NATO. In 2013 a further command structure reorganisation began to take effect. Allied Maritime Command Naples, Allied Air Command ƒ∞zmir and Allied Force Command Madrid were all deactivated. From 2013 Allied Command Operations started directing the Allied Joint Force Command Brunssum and Allied Joint Force Command Naples, and three component commands, Allied Air Command at Ramstein, Germany, Allied Land Command at Izmir, Turkey, and Allied Maritime Command at Northwood, UK. NATO and Romanian Ministry of Defense representatives activated the Headquarters Multinational Division Southeast (HQ MND-SE) headquarters in Bucharest, Romania, on December 1, 2015. The new HQ was activated as part of the Readiness Action Plan agreed at the 2014 Wales Summit. JFC Naples will serve as the operational control of MND-SE. The division HQ will be prepared to execute command and control over the NATO Force Integration Units in Romania and Bulgaria for a range of missions, which includes Article V operations based on NATO advance planning, when authorized by the North Atlantic Council and directed by the Supreme Allied Commander Europe. ==Role== Commander, Allied Joint Force Command Naples, is responsible for conducting the full range of military operations throughout the NATO Area of Responsibility (AOR) and beyond in order to deter aggression and to contribute to the effective defence of NATO territory and forces, safeguard freedom of the seas and economic lifelines and to preserve or restore the security of NATO nations. ==References== ==Further reading== *Dionysios Chourchoulis, The Southern Flank of NATO, 1951‚Äì1959: Military Strategy or Political Stabilization (Google eBook), Lexington Books, 18/12/2014 *Dionysios Chourchoulis, \\"A nominal defence?

He returned to Nuremberg around 1924, and was hired by the Fr√§nkische Tagespost, a newspaper linked to the German Social Democrats. When he was dispatched to cover the second Luppe-Streicher trial with instructions to draw a caricature of Julius Streicher, he instead drew caricatures of Nuremberg's mayor, , who was also involved in the trial. The cartoons were published by Der St√ºrmer in December 1925, and Rupprecht was hired by the paper. With the exception of 1927, he was Der St√ºrmers sole regular cartoonist under the pen-name of \\"Fips\\" until February 2, 1945, when the last edition of Der St√ºrmer appeared, drawing thousands of anti-Semitic caricatures. His style changed during the course of his career, but his caricatures always depicted Jews as short, fat, ugly, unshaven, drooling, sexually perverted, bent-nosed, and with pig-like eyes.

Bowed string instruments in particular benefit from an application of soft pencil graphite in the notches of the nut, to preserve the delicate flat windings of their strings. ==Etymology== The word may have come from the German Nut (pronounced \\"noot\\"), meaning groove or slot. The nut, however, is called a de:Sattel (\\"saddle\\"; also Obersattel) in German, whereas the part of a guitar known as the saddle in English, the surface of the bridge on which the strings rest, is called a de:Stegeinlage or Steg, in German. In French, the nut is known as a :fr:sillet, which, like German, can also translate to mean saddle. The Italian term, capo tasto (or capotasto; \\"head of fretboard\\"), is the origin of the capo. ==Variations== Not all string instruments have nuts as described. The nuts on some instruments are notched deeply enough that they are just string spacers. These instruments use a zero fret‚Äîa fret at the beginning of the scale where a normal nut would be that provides the correct string clearance. The zero fret is often found on less expensive instruments, as it is easier to set up an instrument this way. However, a zero fret also makes the sound of the open string similar to fretted notes. A conventional nut can make open strings sound slightly different‚Äîand for this reason some high-end instruments use a zero fret. String slots in a nut without a zero fret must be cut to the proper depth to make string height correct. Strings that are too low at the nut can buzz against the frets, and too high throws off intonation of fretted notes. Compensated nut on a Music Man Bongo 5 bass guitar Some fretted instruments have a compensated nut. This type of nut provides better average theoretical intonation across the instrument, although this improved accuracy may be below the threshold of human ability to hear it and may also be below the threshold of uncontrollable note-to-note intonation variability. The principle given that strings are different thicknesses and have different tensions, the temperament of each fret is not 100% accurate for an equal temperament instrument. This is especially evident on the first few frets of an electric guitar. Many guitar players notice how 'open position' chords (Such as E, A, C, D and G) never sound in tune with each other. A compensated nut aims to correct this, by staggering the starting position of each string according to thickness. While not a complete solution such as a true temperament fretboard, there is a noticeable difference in tuning within chords. Many guitar companies, such as Music Man, and ESP include compensated nuts as standard on most of their instruments, and companies such as Earvana provide retrofittable types. Another type is a locking nut. This nut‚Äîusually used in conjunction with a locking vibrato system such as a Floyd Rose or Kahler‚Äîclamps the strings against the nut. This improves tuning stability when using the vibrato bar. A drawback however, is that the locking nut must be loosened using an Allen wrench to tune outside the range of the fine tuners on the bridge (if present). The erhu does not use a hard nut to define the vibrating length of the open string, but rather a qiƒÅn jin (ÂçÉÊñ§), a loop of string, or, less commonly, a metal hook. Some guitars have a rolling nut. In this design, made popular by Fender, the strings sit on roller bearings instead of nut slots. The rollers let the string freely slide or roll through the nut. The roller nut helps keep the guitar in tune by preventing the strings from getting stuck in the nut.Guitar Nut Repair article on the Guitar Repair Bench Luthier Website ==Keyboard instruments== The term \\"nut\\" also refers to bridges on certain keyboard instruments. On harpsichords, it designates the non-sounding bridge located near the tuning pins away from the player. On virginals, the term usually designates the bridge on the left side, away from the tuning pins. The term is not always applied consistently. == References == Category:String instrument construction Category:Musical instrument parts and accessories ","title":"Nut (string instrument)"},{"id":"3231995","text":"Bicton Parish Church of St Mary, built in 1850 Bicton is a civil parish and a former manor in the East Devon district of Devon, England, near the town of Budleigh Salterton. The parish is surrounded, clockwise from the north, by the parishes of Colaton Raleigh, Otterton, East Budleigh and Woodbury. According to the 2001 census it had a population of 280. Much of the parish consists of Bicton Park, the historic home of the Rolle family, with Bicton Common, adjacent to Woodbury Common, in the west. The parish includes the village of Yettington on its southern border. ==History== Bicton appears in the Domesday Book of 1086 as Bechetone, held by William Porter, probably by the service of guarding the gate at Exeter Castle and the prison there.Thorn, Caroline & Frank, (eds.) Domesday Book, (Morris, John, gen.ed.) Vol. 9, Devon, Parts 1 & 2, Phillimore Press, Chichester, 1985, part 2, 51:1. The manor passed through several families until Sir Thomas Denys (1559‚Äì1613) left two daughters as co- heiresses. The eldest was Anne Denys, who by her marriage to Sir Henry Rolle (d.1616) of Stevenstone, brought Bicton to the Rolle family. Bicton House and its lake The gardens at Bicton were begun in around 1735, supposedly to a design by Andr√© Le N√¥tre, but most of the work was undertaken by John Rolle, 1st Baron Rolle in the early 19th century. This included the digging of the lake in 1812 by French prisoners of war, planting the arboretum in 1830 and the noted araucaria avenue in 1842. Other features include the orangery (1806), the \\"bulbous\\" palm house (c. 1825), and the castellated octagonal China Tower of 1839. John Rolle died, childless, aged 86 in 1842. However, after his marriage to his second wife, Louisa Trefusis, he decided to appoint as his heir her nephew, the six-year-old Mark George Kerr Trefusis (the younger brother of the 20th Baron Clinton) requiring him to change his name to Rolle, which he did. However, when Mark Rolle died in 1907 he left no male heir so the Rolle inheritance passed to his nephew, Charles Hepburn-Stuart- Forbes-Trefusis, 21st Baron Clinton (1863‚Äì1957). The 21st Baron let and later sold the mansion house and surrounding lands to Devon County Council as an agricultural college, now Bicton College, which as of 2016 covers , and sleeps 231 residential students. The gardens at Bicton were renovated by the baron in the 1950s and opened to the public in 1963. The 22nd Baron gave the botanical gardens to a charitable trust in 1986, which sold them in 1998 to Simon and Valerie Lister who turned their into a commercial visitor attraction named Bicton Park Botanical Gardens ‚Äì see below. The remainder of the land comprising the former manor of Bicton is still owned by Baron Clinton under the management of Clinton Devon Estates. This includes of tenant farmland, of woodland and of the East Devon Pebblebed Heaths. The equestrian venue known as Bicton Arena is also part of the estate. Bicton old church. The chancel is now the Rolle Mausoleum. ==Church== In 1850, Lady Louisa Rolle commemorated her late husband by building a new church on the estate close to the old one, which was partly demolished and the chancel reworked by Augustus Pugin as a mausoleum to the Rolle family. The mausoleum, which is not open to the public, contains Minton floor tiles, a vaulted ceiling, east and west decorated windows by Pugin, and a Rolle monument on the north wall designed by George Myers. It also contains the baroque marble tomb of Denys Rolle (died 1638) and his wife and son, which was described by W. G. Hoskins as \\"magnificent\\". Some fifty years before its demolition, the topographer John Swete made a watercolour painting of the old church, and wrote of its picturesque setting in his journal in 1795.Gray, Todd & Rowe, Margery (Eds.), Travels in Georgian Devon: The Illustrated Journals of The Reverend John Swete, 1789‚Äì1800, 4 vols., Tiverton, 1999, vol.2, pp.140‚Äì145 The church of 1850 was designed by the Exeter-based architect, John Hayward: Hoskins simply called it \\"dull\\", though it was later described as an early example in Devon of the ideals of the Cambridge Camden Society. ==Landmarks== Obelisk erected in 1747 Brick pillar, situated on crossroads between the parishes of Bicton and Otterton, both owned by the Rolle family Bicton Obelisk on the edge of the park was built in 1747 by Henry Rolle, 1st Baron Rolle (1708‚Äì1750) as a visual attraction for the gardens. Rolle also built the four-sided pillar in the centre of the four-cross-ways between Bicton and Otterton in 1743. As well as serving as a signpost for the various places to which the four roads lead, it incorporates biblical inscriptions, such as \\"Her ways are ways of pleasantness\\", etc. Railway at the Bicton Park Botanical Gardens ==Bicton Park Botanical Gardens== Bicton Park Botanical Gardens is a tourist attraction on the southern part of the former Bicton estate. The landscaped park includes historic glasshouses, a countryside museum, the Bicton Woodland Railway train ride, nature trail, maze, mini golf, indoor and outdoor children's play complexes, restaurant and shop. The gardens, which originated in c.1730 are Grade I listed. The four glasshouses at Bicton Gardens were designed to re- create the natural environment of plants from different continents. The Palm House was built in the 1820s to a curvilinear design, using 18,000 small glass panes in thin iron glazing bars. The Tropical House is the home of the Bicton orchid (Lemboglossum bictoniense), named after the Park where it first bloomed in 1836. The Arid House features cacti and other succulents growing in a naturalistic desert landscape. ==Notes== ==References== ==External links== * Bicton Park Botanical Gardens *Bicton Arena *Bicton College Category:Villages in Devon Category:Civil parishes in Devon ","title":"Bicton, Devon"},{"id":"3231996","text":"David G.

The village is situated about south of Pocklington. According to the 2011 UK census, Bielby parish had a population of 258, a decrease on the 2001 UK census figure of 281. About two miles north-east of Bielby, on the edge of Hayton, lie the ruins of an ancient Roman military fortress, an important archaeological site. The University of Durham, Dept of Archaeology, led an excavation between 1995 and 1998 with assistance from local residents and University of Leeds students. A well, a bath-house and many other parts of the Roman fortress have been identified. The name Bielby, spelled Belebi in the Domesday Book, derives from the Old Scandinavian personal name Beli, and means \\"farmstead or village of a man called Beli.\\" The total rent collected from tenants in Bielby dropped from 1066 to 1086 from ¬£56 to ¬£8. By the 11th century Bielebi (Bielby) had almost 10 residents. One home in Bielby is proudly named Bielbyville. Most homes in Bielby have a name plate sign displayed either on the front exterior wall or in the yard (even though the homes are modest in size). Another House at the end of the village is Manor Cottage where many a farmers worked on land next to the house (although since 2009 been empty). Bielby has an Anglican church (St. Giles), which dates back more than 900 years. The Methodist revival which swept England in the 18th century still has a visible presence in Bielby, although the old Methodist Church building in the village is now a private residence. ==History== The Great Heathen Army of the Vikings captured much of the area in 866, and, in 876, their remnants settled permanently in parts of the Yorkshire countryside. The Great Heathen Army marched directly through the section Bielby would be established near in 865, conquering what would become York in 866. Viking kings ruled the whole region around Bielby, known to historians as \\"The Viking Kingdom of Jorvik\\", for almost a century. In 954, the last Viking king, Eric Bloodaxe, was expelled and his kingdom was incorporated in the newly consolidated Anglo-Saxon state. Great Heathen Army battles ==Notable people from Bielby== * John Smith (1807‚Äì1895), of Bielby, was a maker of sundials and \\"a remarkable man in his way\\". ==People named Bielby== Until recently, residents named Bielby lived in the village. The last Bielby was an Alice Bielby who formerly taught in the village school during the middle 20th century. (source: A Bielby village bearer of the key for St. Giles Church in 2001) There are no known Bielbys left in the village. Some Bielby's have their names spelled Beilby or Beelby on different documents. There are people bearing the name Bielby or Beilby living across England, Canada, the US, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and elsewhere. Some Bielbys who spread throughout England became famous for their glass-blowing skill. The Beilby goblets boast the highest auction prices of any King's goblets sold in markets in recent history. Rev. Beilby Porteus was a well-known preacher and author who was Bishop of London from 1787 until his death in 1809. Some of the Bielbys in Canada and America have known forefathers who were Methodist (see the John Bielby family and descendants from Lake City, Michigan, immigrating from Ontario to Michigan in about 1900. Also his grandfather, Richard Milson Bielby, was a noted Holiness Church member in Huntsville, Ontario during the last half of the 19th century) He is mentioned in Methodist articles from that time period as a significant lay member of their movement. Traces of Methodist influence from England into America via the Bielbys exist primarily in Canada. Other than St. Giles Church, the old Methodist Church-which is now a home, no other religious organizations were represented in Bielby. In addition to St. Giles, The College Arms (a small pub serving lunch and dinner), Bielby is mostly residential, with a few newer homes. Geese are still raised on the edge of the village. The Pocklington Canal still provides a splendid water supply for such purposes. A Beck also runs close to Bielby and used to drive an old flour Mill, but from time to time it can flood, as it did in June 2007, overflowing the streets of Bielby up to the doorsteps of some homes. Karl Pearson's grandmother was named Bielby. She lived in Crambe and other places near Bielby. ==Church restoration== Medieval wall painting of St Christopher in St Giles Church The parish church of St Giles has recently been restored. Plaster has been removed and sandstone walls restored. Two arches on the outside of the church, and a pillar and skeleton on an inside wall, have been uncovered. Removal of the external rendering has uncovered a history of the church, with pillars and arches now visible that would have been part of a larger structure. Inside, an ancient blue-coloured painting was revealed, showing the legs of St Christopher. The plasterwork had deteriorated to such an extent that when efforts were made to protect it, it crumbled off the wall in fragments. The box pews are among the best-preserved in the East Riding of Yorkshire.

The deserted medieval village (DMV) of Kettleby was first recorded in a will of 1066. Domesday records two manors: Kettleby, whose Lord of the Manor was Ralph, nephew of Geoffrey Alselin, and Kettleby Thorpe, whose Lord was listed only as Gilbert. Thereafter Kettleby merged with Kettleby Thorpe, also a deserted settlement. Kettleby is mentioned in 1334. Today the area is occupied by the earthworks of Kettleby Hall. Kettleby Hall was reputedly a moated hunting lodge built in the reign of James I and later the chief seat of the Tyrwhitt family. The last male heir sold-up in 1648 because of debts, and the building was demolished in 1696-97. The present farmhouse on the site dates from the nineteenth century. ==References== ==External links== *\\"Bigby\\", Genuki.org.uk Category:Villages in Lincolnshire Category:Civil parishes in Lincolnshire Category:West Lindsey District ","title":"Bigby, Lincolnshire"},{"id":"3232039","text":"John Pike (1613-1688/89) was a founder of Woodbridge Township, New Jersey and a judge and politician of the early colony of New Jersey. ==Early life and education== Pike was born in Wiltshire, England. He came to the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1635 with his father, John Pike (1572‚Äì1654), who first settled in Newbury. In 1665, acting on the invitation of Governor Philip Carteret, a number of Newbury residents formed a corporation to settle in Woodbridge, named after Rev. John Woodbridge, a Newbury clergyman. The younger John Pike, one of the original nine \\"associates\\" of Woodbridge, was granted some in Woodbridge in 1665, more than the common freeholders. He was \\"the prominent man of the town\\" in its early years. He was elected President of Woodbridge, and in 1671 was appointed to the Governor's Council. After 1675, he was appointed captain of the militia, and afterward was known as Capt. Pike. James Albert Pike moved to the united kingdom where he became a property baron in London In 1684, together with his son John, he was charged and convicted of possession of stolen goods, a felony. After his death, the New Jersey assembly passed an act clearing his name, as well as one allowing his family to sue for defamation. He was well respected despite the felony conviction. After years of local leadership, Pike was chosen to represent the township in the colonial General Assembly three times: 1692-3, 1696, and 1697-8. ==Marriage and family == Pike and his first wife had several children together: John (1634‚Äì1714), Thomas, Joseph, Hannah, and Ruth, and three others who predeceased him. As a widower aged 72, Pike married his second wife Elizabeth Fitz Randolph in 1685. He died a few years later. He is also an ancestor of Albert Pike, a prominent Confederate brigadier general and an important Freemason; and Lt. Colonel Emory Jenison Pike, awarded a posthumous Medal of Honor for actions during World War I in France, where he was killed. Another notable descendant is General Zebulon Pike of Pikes Peak fame. ==References== Category:1613 births Category:1680s deaths Category:Kingdom of England emigrants to the Thirteen Colonies Category:Members of the New Jersey General Assembly Category:People of colonial New Jersey Category:People from Newbury, Massachusetts Category:People from Woodbridge Township, New Jersey Category:People from Wiltshire Category:Members of the East New Jersey Provincial Council ","title":"John Pike (settler)"},{"id":"3232042","text":"Baldwin de Redvers, 1st Earl of Devon (died 4 June 1155), feudal baron of Plympton in Devon,Sanders, I.J.

In 1820 Biggin was said to have a population of 164 people \\"BIGGIN, in the parish of Church Fenton, wapentake of Barkston-Ash, liberties of St. Peter and Pontefract; 6 miles SE. of Tadcaster, 7 from Selby, 11 from Pontefract. Pop. 164\\". ==Population== Age structure of Biggin 2001 In 2001 Biggin had a population of 117. 29.9% of people living in Biggin were between the ages of forty five to fifty nine and a further 22.2 per cent were thirty to forty four. By the time of the census 2011 the population had increased only slightly to 121. This suggests the area is fairly affluent as over half the population are at or near to an age where they should be peaking in their chosen careers. Only twenty two people are of an age to go to school in Biggin which is an indicator as to why there is no primary school for a five-mile radius. The fact Biggin's population has actually decreased over a century isn't really surprising or significant for a parish of its size as more than eighty per cent of Britain's population now live in urban areas. ==Notable places== Biggin is located eighteen miles east of major city Leeds and is also thirteen miles south of York. Biggin does not have a railway station; there is one in Sherburn in Elmet which is a 3.7 mile journey by car and Church Fenton which is slightly closer at 3.1 miles. Church Fenton runs trains every hour to both Leeds and York, with Leeds taking as little as twenty-eight minutes and York just sixteen Church Fenton's station is favourable for most Biggin residents. There are no Primary or Secondary schools within Biggin however there are forty-nine within the Selby district, giving parents a wide choice if prepared to travel. The most local primary school to Biggin is Sherburn Hungate Community Primary school which is just under five miles away. Oxmoor Lane acts as the main road running through the centre of Biggin. Driving south down Oxmoor Lane will lead you out of Biggin and on to a rural B road the B1222 leading to the A63. ==Economy and climate== The Blacksmith Arms lies in the centre of Biggin along Oxmoor Lane. It was a former dwelling-house which became a public house after its sale in the late 19th century. It is currently the only trader in Biggin. It is a pub with great history to the local area, with records dating back over a hundred years. ==References== ==External links== Category:Civil parishes in North Yorkshire Category:Selby District Category:Villages in North Yorkshire ","title":"Biggin, North Yorkshire"},{"id":"3232057","text":"Martha daughter of Boethus (d. AD 70), in the Mishnah and Babylonian Talmud, was one of the richest women in Jerusalem in the period prior to the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 C.E. (Talmud Gittin 56a; see also Talmud Ketubot 104a.) After her first husband died, she became engaged to Joshua ben Gamala. (Mishnah Yevamot 6:4; Talmud Yevamot 61a.) Rav Assi said that she paid King Jannai (whom scholars identify with Herod Agrippa II) a quantity of money equal in size to 72 eggs to nominate Joshua to become High Priest of Israel (Talmud Yoma 18a), even though the Sanhedrin had not elected him to the post. (Talmud Yevamot 61a.) Even though the general rule was that a high priest should not marry a widow (Mishnah Yevamot 6:4), the couple went on to marry, and the Mishnah cites the event for the proposition that a priest who betroths a widow and subsequently becomes high priest may consummate the marriage. (Mishnah Yevamot 6:4; Talmud Yevamot 61a.) It was said of Martha's son, who was a priest, that he was so strong that he could carry up to the altar two sides of a huge ox without any lack of decorum. (Talmud Sukkah 52b.) The Talmud recounts the story of her last day during the Siege of Jerusalem (AD 70). (Talmud Gittin 56a.) At that time, Martha sent her manservant out to bring her some fine flour, but it had sold out. He told her that there was no fine flour, but there was white flour. She then sent him to bring her some white flour. By the time he went, the white flour had sold out. He told her that there was no white flour, but there was dark flour. She sent him to bring her some dark flour. By the time he went, the dark flour had sold out. He told her that there was no dark flour, but there was barley flour. She sent him to bring her some barley flour. By the time he went, the barley flour had also sold out. In desperation, without even putting on her shoes, she went out to see if she could find anything to eat. She stepped in some dung and died of shock. Rabban Johanan ben Zakkai thus applied to her the Biblical verse, \\"The tender and delicate woman among you who would not adventure to set the sole of her foot upon the ground.\\" () Some report that she ate a fig left by Rabbi Zadok, became sick, and died. Rabbi Zadok observed fasts for 40 years in order that Jerusalem might not be destroyed. When he wanted to restore himself, they used to bring him a fig, and he used to suck the juice and throw the rest away. (Talmud Gittin 56a.) When Martha was about to die, she brought out all her gold and silver and threw it in the street, saying, \\"What is the good of this to me,\\" thus giving effect to the verse, \\"They shall cast their silver in the streets.\\" () (Talmud Gittin 56a.)

By measuring the resulting isotopic composition, it is possible to calculate the amount of the analyte present in the sample. Isotope dilution analysis is a method of determining the quantity of chemical substances. In its most simple conception, the method of isotope dilution comprises the addition of known amounts of isotopically-enriched substance to the analyzed sample. Mixing of the isotopic standard with the sample effectively \\"dilutes\\" the isotopic enrichment of the standard and this forms the basis for the isotope dilution method. Isotope dilution is classified as a method of internal standardisation, because the standard (isotopically-enriched form of analyte) is added directly to the sample. In addition, unlike traditional analytical methods which rely on signal intensity, isotope dilution employs signal ratios. Owing to both of these advantages, the method of isotope dilution is regarded among chemistry measurement methods of the highest metrological standing. Isotopes are variants of a particular chemical element which differ in neutron number. All isotopes of a given element have the same number of protons in each atom. The term isotope is formed from the Greek roots isos (·º¥œÉŒøœÇ \\"equal\\") and topos (œÑœåœÄŒøœÇ \\"place\\"), meaning \\"the same place\\"; thus, the meaning behind the name is that different isotopes of a single element occupy the same position on the periodic table. ==Early history== The Hungarian chemist George de Hevesy was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for development of radiotracer method, which is a forerunner of isotope dilution Analytical application of the radiotracer method is a forerunner of isotope dilution. This method was developed in the early 20th century by George de Hevesy for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for 1943. An early application of isotope dilution in the form of radiotracer method was determination of the solubility of lead sulphide and lead chromate in 1913 by George de Hevesy and Friedrich Adolf Paneth. In the 1930s, US biochemist David Rittenberg pioneered the use of isotope dilution in biochemistry enabling detailed studies of cell metabolism. ==Tutorial example== Tutorial illustration of isotope dilution analysis with fish counting in lakes Isotope dilution can be effectively explained using mark and recapture method from biology - a method commonly used in ecology to estimate the population size of fish. Isotope dilution can be likened to Lincoln-Petersen method. Assume that the number of fish in a pond is to be determined. Five labeled fish are added to the pond during the first visit (nB = 5). On the second visit, a number of fish is captured and one observes that the ratio of native-to-labeled is 10:1. From here, we can estimate the original number of fish in the pond, nA: :n_\\\\mathrm{A} = n_\\\\mathrm{B} \\\\times \\\\frac{10}{1} = 50 This is a simplified view of isotope dilution yet it illustrates the salient features of isotope dilution. A more complex situation arises when the distinction between labeled and unlabeled fish becomes fuzzy. This can occur, for example, when the lake already contains a small number of labeled fish from the previous field experiments. In such situation, the following expression can be employed: :n_\\\\mathrm{A} = n_\\\\mathrm{B} \\\\times \\\\frac{R_\\\\mathrm{B}-R_\\\\mathrm{AB}}{R_\\\\mathrm{AB}-R_\\\\mathrm{A}} \\\\times \\\\frac{1+R_\\\\mathrm{A}}{1+R_\\\\mathrm{B}} where RA is the ratio of the native-to- labeled fish in the lake, RB is the ratio of the native-to-labeled fish in the lot of nB marked fish which are added to the pond, and RAB is the ratio of the native-to-labeled fish captured during the second visit. ==Applications== Isotope dilution is almost exclusively employed with mass spectrometry in applications where high-accuracy is demanded. For example, all National Metrology Institutes rely significantly on isotope dilution when producing certified reference materials. In addition to high-precision analysis, isotope dilution is applied when low recovery of the analyte is encountered. In addition to the use of stable isotopes, radioactive isotopes can be employed in isotope dilution which is often encountered in biomedical applications, for example, in estimating the volume of blood. ==Single dilution method== { class=infobox width=200px !colspan=2Isotope dilution notation -  - ! Name !! Symbol -  Analyte  **A** -  Isotopic standard (Spike)  **B** -  -  Analyte + Spike  **AB** } Consider a natural analyte rich in isotope iA (denoted as A), and the same analyte, enriched in isotope jA (denoted as B). Then, the obtained mixture is analyzed for the isotopic composition of the analyte, RAB = n(iA)AB/n(jA)AB. If the amount of the isotopically-enriched substance (nB) is known, the amount of substance in the sample (nA) can be obtained: :n_\\\\mathrm{A} = n_\\\\mathrm{B} \\\\frac{R_\\\\mathrm{B}-R_\\\\mathrm{AB}}{R_\\\\mathrm{AB}-R_\\\\mathrm{A}} \\\\times \\\\frac {x(^{j}\\\\mathrm{A})_\\\\mathrm{B}}{x(^{j}\\\\mathrm{A})_\\\\mathrm{A}} Here, RA is the isotope amount ratio of the natural analyte, RA = n(iA)A/n(jA)A, RB is the isotope amount ratio of the isotopically-enriched analyte, RB = n(iA)B/n(jA)B, RAB is the isotope amount ratio of the resulting mixture, x(jA)A is the isotopic abundance of the minor isotope in the natural analyte, and x(jA)B is the isotopic abundance of the major isotope in the isotopically-enriched analyte. For elements with only two stable isotopes, such as boron, chlorine, or silver, the above single dilution equation simplifies to the following: :n_\\\\mathrm{A} = n_\\\\mathrm{B} \\\\frac{R_\\\\mathrm{B}-R_\\\\mathrm{AB}}{R_\\\\mathrm{AB}-R_\\\\mathrm{A}} \\\\times \\\\frac {1+R_\\\\mathrm{A}}{1+R_\\\\mathrm{B}} In a typical gas chromatography analysis, isotopic dilution can decrease the uncertainty of the measurement results from 5% to 1%. It can also be used in mass spectrometry (commonly referred to as isotopic dilution mass spectrometry or IDMS), in which the isotopic ratio can be determined with precision typically better than 0.25%.EPA publication SW-846, \\"Test Methods for Evaluating Solid Waste, Physical/Chemical Methods\\", available at http://www.epa.gov/epaoswer/hazwaste/test/sw846.htm. See Method 6800, \\"Elemental and Speciated Isotope Dilution Mass Spectrometry\\", available at http://www.epa.gov/epaoswer/hazwaste/test/pdfs/6800.pdf. ===Optimum composition of the blend=== In a simplified manner, the uncertainty of the measurement results is largely determined from the measurement of RAB: :u(n_\\\\mathrm{A})^2 \\\\propto \\\\left ({\\\\frac{\\\\partial{n_\\\\mathrm{A}}}{\\\\partial R_\\\\mathrm{AB}}} \\\\right)^2 u(R_\\\\mathrm{AB})^2 = n_\\\\mathrm{A}^2 \\\\frac{(R_\\\\mathrm{A}-R_\\\\mathrm{B})^2}{(R_\\\\mathrm{A}-R_\\\\mathrm{AB})^2(R_\\\\mathrm{AB}-R_\\\\mathrm{B})^2} u(R_\\\\mathrm{AB})^2 From here, we obtain the relative uncertainty of nA, ur(nA) = u(nA)/nA: :u_\\\\mathrm{r}(n_\\\\mathrm{A})^2 \\\\propto \\\\frac{(R_\\\\mathrm{A}-R_\\\\mathrm{B})^2}{(R_\\\\mathrm{A}-R_\\\\mathrm{AB})^2(R_\\\\mathrm{AB}-R_\\\\mathrm{B})^2} u(R_\\\\mathrm{AB})^2 The lowest relative uncertainty of nA corresponds to the condition when the first derivative with respect to RAB equals zero. In addition, it is common in mass spectrometry that u(RAB)/RAB is constant and therefore we can replace u(RAB) with RAB. These ideas combine to give :u_\\\\mathrm{r}(n_\\\\mathrm{A})_\\\\mathrm{min} \\\\mapsto \\\\partial \\\\left(\\\\frac{(R_\\\\mathrm{A}-R_\\\\mathrm{B})}{(R_\\\\mathrm{A}-R_\\\\mathrm{AB})(R_\\\\mathrm{AB}-R_\\\\mathrm{B})} R_\\\\mathrm{AB} \\\\right) / \\\\partial R_\\\\mathrm{AB} = 0 Solving this equation leads to the optimum composition of the blend AB, i.e., the geometric mean between the isotopic compositions of standard (A) and spike (B): :R_\\\\mathrm{AB} = \\\\sqrt{R_\\\\mathrm{A} R_\\\\mathrm{B}} This simplified equation was first proposed by De Bievre and Debus numerically and later by Komori et al. and by Riepe and Kaiser analytically. It has been noted that this simple expression is only a general approximation and it does not hold, for example, in the presence of Poisson statistics or in the presence of strong isotope signal ratio correlation. ==Double dilution method== The single dilution method requires the knowledge of the isotopic composition of the isotopically-enriched analyte (RB) and the amount of the enriched analyte added (nB). Both of these variables are hard to establish since isotopically-enriched substances are generally available in small quantities of questionable purity. As a result, before isotope dilution is performed on the sample, the amount of the enriched analyte is ascertained beforehand using isotope dilution. This preparatory step is called the reverse isotope dilution and it involves a standard of natural isotopic-composition analyte (denoted as A*). First proposed in the 1940s and further developed in the 1950s, reverse isotope dilution remains an effective means of characterizing a labeled material. { class=infobox width=200px !colspan=2Isotope dilution notation -  - ! Name !! Symbol -  Analyte  **A** -  Natural standard  **A*** -  Isotopic standard (Spike)  **B** -  -  Analyte + Spike  **AB** -  Standard + Spike  **A*B** } Reverse isotope dilution analysis of the enriched analyte: :n_\\\\mathrm{B} = n_\\\\mathrm{A*} \\\\frac{R_\\\\mathrm{A*}-R_\\\\mathrm{A*B}}{R_\\\\mathrm{A*B}-R_\\\\mathrm{B}} \\\\times \\\\frac {x(^{j}\\\\mathrm{A})_\\\\mathrm{A*}}{x(^{j}\\\\mathrm{A})_\\\\mathrm{B}} Isotope dilution analysis of the analyte: :n_\\\\mathrm{A} = n_\\\\mathrm{B} \\\\frac{R_\\\\mathrm{B}-R_\\\\mathrm{AB}}{R_\\\\mathrm{AB}-R_\\\\mathrm{A}} \\\\times \\\\frac {x(^{j}\\\\mathrm{A})_\\\\mathrm{B}}{x(^{j}\\\\mathrm{A})_\\\\mathrm{A}} Since isotopic composition of A and A* are identical, combining these two expressions eliminates the need to measure the amount of the added enriched standard (nB): :n_\\\\mathrm{A} = n_\\\\mathrm{A*} \\\\frac{R_\\\\mathrm{A*}-R_\\\\mathrm{A*B}}{R_\\\\mathrm{A*B}-R_\\\\mathrm{B}} \\\\times \\\\frac{R_\\\\mathrm{B}-R_\\\\mathrm{AB}}{R_\\\\mathrm{AB}-R_\\\\mathrm{A}} Double dilution method can be designed such that the isotopic composition of the two blends, A+B and A*+B, is identical, i.e., RAB = RA*B. This condition of exact-matching double isotope dilution simplifies the above equation significantly: :n_\\\\mathrm{A} = n_\\\\mathrm{A*} \\\\; (R_\\\\mathrm{A*B}=R_\\\\mathrm{AB} \\\\land R_\\\\mathrm{A*} = R_\\\\mathrm{A}) ==Triple dilution method== To avoid contamination of the mass spectrometer with the isotopically-enriched spike, an additional blend of the primary standard (A*) and the spike (B) can be measured instead of measuring the enriched spike (B) directly. This approach was first put forward in the 1970s and developed in 2002. ==Calculations using calibration curve == Many analysts do not employ analytical equations for isotope dilution analysis. Instead, they rely on building a calibration curve from mixtures of the natural primary standard (A*) and the isotopically- enriched standard (the spike, B). Calibration curves are obtained by plotting measured isotope ratios in the prepared blends against the known ratio of the sample mass to the mass of the spike solution in each blend. Isotope dilution calibration plots sometimes show nonlinear relationships and in practice polynomial fitting is often performed to empirically describe such curves. When calibration plots are markedly nonlinear, one can bypass the empirical polynomial fitting and employ the ratio of two linear functions (known as Pad√© approximant) which is shown to describe the curvature of isotope dilution curves exactly. ==See also== * Standard addition * Internal standard * Mass spectrometry * Mark and recapture * Lincoln index ==References== ==Further reading== * * Category:Scientific method Category:Scientific techniques Category:Laboratory techniques ","title":"Isotope dilution"},{"id":"3232069","text":"The Rhinebeck and Connecticut Railroad was chartered on June 29, 1870 for the purpose of building a railroad from Rhinecliff on the Hudson River east to the Connecticut state line.

During 1964, Meggitt, a Dorset-based light engineering business, was wholly acquired by Willson Lathes; subsequently, management decided to change the company's name to Meggitt Holdings. ===1980‚Äì1999=== During 1983, Nigel McCorkell and Ken Coates, together with 3i Group, took control of Meggitt via a management buy-in. The new management team soon embarked on a series of acquisitions, aimed at increasing the business' geographical diversity to become an international engineering company; it focused on speciality sectors within fields such as aerospace, controls, electronics and energy. During 1985, Meggitt Holdings acquired London-based avionics specialist Negretti and Zambra. In 1986, the company bought the engineering interest Bestobell, which had historically focused on aviation air ducting and sealing solutions. Following the appointment of Michael Stacey as the CEO of Meggitt Holdings in 1990, the company was reorganised to focus its efforts around three core markets: aerospace, defence systems and electronics. Further acquisitions were conducted during the 1990s. In 1992, Meggitt acquired sensor specialist firm Endevco, specialists in sensors for test and measurement applications. During 1998, engine diagnostics specialist Vibro-Meter was also acquired to improve the company's portfolio of condition monitoring capabilities. In the following year, Californian aviation aftermarket support firm Whittaker Corporation was also acquired by Meggitt for $380m. During July 1997, Meggitt received their first contract from American commercial airline manufacturer Boeing to provide solid-state clocks for the Boeing 737; separately, it was contracted to provide the secondary flight display system for the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II. That same year Spanish aviation company CASA appointed it to supply the air ducting system for its new C-295 utility transport aircraft. In 1998, Raytheon Aircraft awarded the company a contract to supply solid state altimeters and secondary flight display systems for numerous business aircraft, including the Beech King Air, Beech 1900D, Hawker 800XP and Hawker Horizon, in its lineup. Later that year, Boeing announced that Meggitt would be its sole supplier of solid-state electronic standby instrumentation for all of its airlines. ===2000‚Äì2009=== During 2001, a new CEO, Terry Twigger, took over at Meggitt. The company continued to expand through numerous acquisitions throughout the 2000s. In 2002, it arranged to acquire Lodge (Brothers), a British manufacturer of speed and temperature sensors for aero engines, from Smiths Aerospace. During the following year, Meggitt bought Western Design, which manufactured automated ammunition-handling apparatus and environmental control systems. In 2003, it acquired Caswell International, a provider of high-tech live fire training systems. During 2004, the company, in cooperation with The Carlyle Group, bought the Dunlop Standard Aerospace Group's design and manufacturing divisions; the deal included Dunlop Aerospace Braking Systems, Dunlop Ice Protection & Composites, Dunlop Precision Rubber; Dunlop Equipment, Serck Aviation, and Stewart Warner South Wind. This rapid acquisition rate was attributed with Meggitt's high increases in annual revenue around this period. During 2005, Meggitt acquired sensors and electronics specialist Sensorex; that same year, it also bought ECET, an airborne electronic equipment and ignition systems manufacturer, as well as refuelling equipment specialist Avery-Hardoll. In 2006, the company purchased both simulation provider Firearms Training Systems and compressor producer Airdynamics. By this point, the North American market comprised around 50 per cent of the firm's revenue stream. A year later, Meggitt acquired K&F; Industries, the parent company to the Aircraft Braking Systems Corporation. During 2008, it bought Ferroperm Piezoceramics A/S, which manufactured high quality piezoceramic materials for sensors. The company launched several products throughout the decade, such as the Meggitt Avionics new Generation Integrated Cockpit (MAGIC) for business aircraft, bleed air leak detection (BALD) system, and its Electro-Thermal-based Ice Protection (ETIP) system, often choosing to promote its latest entries at the annual Farnborough Air Show. Meggitt has been a long time supplier of Brazilian aircraft manufacturer Embraer; in 2018, it was announced that the company had been selected to provide various systems, including the pneumatic bleed air system, brake control system, and carbon brake units, of the firm's Legacy 450/500 business jet. Meggitt's vibration monitoring system was also integrated into multiple platforms, including the CFM International CFM56, General Electric GEnx, Rolls-Royce Trent and PowerJet SaM146 turbofan engines, amongst others. ===2010‚Äì2020=== Meggitt facility at Miami, Florida, United States In 2010, the company restructured itself into five new divisions; consequently, all business units of Meggitt have operated thereafter through divisional management. In 2011, Meggitt acquired the Pacific Scientific Aerospace Group, a component supplier of both civilian and military aerospace sectors; this acquisition included Securaplane Technologies Inc., an aerospace camera and battery supplier involved in producing GS Yuasa's batteries for the Boeing 787 Dreamliner fleet, which was grounded in January 2013 due to multiple onboard battery fires. Subsequent investigation found that the charger was not at fault for the battery defects, clearing Meggitt products of culpability for the fires. During 2013, Meggitt's finance director, Stephen Young, took over as its CEO following Terry Twigger's retirement. In 2016, Tony Wood joined Meggitt as its CEO, becoming Chief Executive during the following year after Stephen Young's retirement. During 2015, the company began to build up its composites division via the acquisition of British manufacturer EDAC, as well as the advanced composites division of Cobham PLC. In 2018, Meggitt announced plans to relocate its UK headquarters from Bournemouth Airport to a purpose- built facility in Ansty, Warwickshire. == See also == * Aerospace industry in the United Kingdom ==References== ==External links== * Official site Category:Engineering companies of the United Kingdom Category:Aerospace companies of the United Kingdom Category:Defence companies of the United Kingdom Category:Companies listed on the London Stock Exchange Category:Manufacturing companies established in 1947 Category:Companies based in Hampshire Category:3i Group companies Category:1947 establishments in England ","title":"Meggitt"},{"id":"3232086","text":"Biggin is a village in the Derbyshire Dales district of Derbyshire, England.

Biggin is hidden away over a ford down a tiny track below Hulland village and, Brigadoon-like, it disappears when the mists lie low across the countryside; strangers to this area will pass by totally unaware of its existence. ==Census== Total population of Biggin, Hulland, as reported by the Census of Population from 1881 to 2011 The population statistic of this village was at an overall steady rate as shown from the 'Biggin Derbyshire population time series 1881‚Äì2011'. From this time period, the highest historical population record of Biggin was during the year of 1881 with 125 people living in the area; while the trough point of Biggin's population was found in 1931 with 82 people only. After this period, the population trend had increased again to the year of 1961 onwards. In recent years, the population of Biggin has been rising shortly from 105 to 120 residents.

The occupation levels are much more widespread in both genders with the highest number of females working in the Administrative and Secretary industry and that the occupation with the highest number of males is the Managers, Directors and Senior officials. This result shows that as time goes by, the people of Biggin becomes more educated that enables both genders to work in more professional service industries nowadays.

His work represents gauchesco scenes with a bit of humor. ==Biography== Molina Campos was born in Buenos Aires. His first exhibition was at the Central Hall of the Argentine Rural Society, in 1926. Marcelo Torcuato de Alvear, the President of Argentina at that time, named him art teacher of the \\"Colegio Nacional Avellaneda\\" after seeing the exhibition. In 1930, the Alpargatas company, makers of espadrilles, under the supervision of engineer Luis Pastorino, commissioned 12 illustrations (using gouache technique) from him for their 1931 calendar. These were so successful that Molina Campos continued to provide the drawings for the next 12 years. In 1942 he exhibited at the Modern Art Museum of San Francisco, which following the exhibition toured the United States. In 1956 he had an exhibition at the Witcomb Gallery in Buenos Aires. Molina Campos (right) with Walt Disney in 1941 when the American entrepreneur visited Argentina In the late 1940s until the mid-1950s he was engaged as a creative artist consulting for the studio of his long-time friend Walt Disney. Together during their trips to Bariloche they worked on the creation of characters for the 1942 animated film, Bambi. His contribution to the film can be recognized in the style of the animals and trees in the film that reproduces the wild life of Victoria Island on Nahuel Huapi Lake, in Argentina's Patagonia. As an artistic consultant with the Disney studios he also contributed in the creation of inexpensive package films, containing collections of cartoon shorts, and issued them to theaters during this period. The most notable and successful of these were Saludos Amigos (1942), its sequel The Three Caballeros (1945), Fun and Fancy Free (1947) and in the original movie poster of Alice in Wonderland (1951).

It is part of the local government area of the City of Mitcham. ==History== The name \\"Blackwood\\" most likely comes from either the Acacia melanoxylon, also known as the Australian blackwood, which grows in the nearby Mount Lofty Ranges, or the Eucalyptus odorata, which grows in Blackwood and has dark bark. The earliest reference to Blackwood was a mention of Blackwood Vale Farm in 1847, though this is in present-day Glenalta. One of the earliest places named for Blackwood was the Blackwood Inn, which opened in 1869. In 1880 it changed names to the Belair Hotel. Belair Post Office opened on 3 April 1859 and was renamed Blackwood in 1881, when the Belair office was moved some distance away. The first land grants in the area had been made in 1840, and various churches were established throughout the 19th century, but most development in Blackwood didn't take place until the Adelaide to Aldgate section of the Adelaide-Wolseley railway line was opened, with Blackwood railway station opening in 1883. Land was subdivided for housing at about the same time and the railway line was later connected all the way to Melbourne. ==Places of interest== Blackwood Soldiers' Memorial was erected in 1921 in the most prominent place in Blackwood: the five-ways roundabout. It is a place of Local Heritage, listed for being \\"a notable landmark in the area\\". Wittunga Botanic Garden, originally a private property with English gardens established in 1901, is located in Blackwood and features displays of Australian and South African plants. Blackwood High School and Blackwood Primary School are located nearby in Eden Hills. St Peters Lutheran School is also located on Cumming Street, opposite to the Blackwood Football Club oval, bordering the suburb of Craigburn Farm. There is diverse fauna in the park that wanders into Craigburn Farm including kangaroos, koalas, and echidnas. Many waterfalls, creeks and gullies are also scattered and found throughout the area. Uniting (former Methodist), Anglican, Church of Christ, Baptist, Roman Catholic and Lutheran churches are located in Blackwood, as well as Pentecostal churches including the Hills Christian Family Centre and Frontier Christian centre. Since the late nineteenth century, Main Road, Blackwood and surrounding areas have formed a vibrant and diverse food and retail centre.

Arthur Beresford Pite (2 September 1861 ‚Äì 27 November 1934) was a British architect known for creating Edwardian buildings in Baroque Revival, Byzantine Revival and Greek Revival styles. ==The early years== Arthur Beresford Pite was born on 2 September 1861 in Newington, London to Alfred and Hephzibah Pite. Pite was educated at Kings College School. In 1877, he entered the office of The Builder's Journal doing mainly literary work, he also attended the Royal Architectural School. In 1882 he became a partner with the notable architect John Belcher. They had already been friends for some time. Architectural historian Alastair Service has described Beresford Pite as 'a vividly original thinker' who together with Belcher developed the 'striking yet intimate Baroque style' which Belcher became known for in the 1890s. Pite worked in the Belcher office until he won the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) Soane Medallion for his design for a West End Club House in 1882. Following this, Pite travelled to the continent with his brother William (also an architect) and they were joined by Belcher and J W James for part of the trip. Pite returned to Belcher's practice and the partnership lasted 12 years. ==Mid life== The Pite family transferred to Ramsgate, Kent where Arthur and William shared rooms and an architectural office. In 1887 Arthur married Mary Kilvington Mowll and they moved back to Brixton, London. They had four children, Grace Sarah (1888), Ion Beresford (1891), Molly (who died shortly after birth) and Arthur Goodhart (1896). ==Professor== Pite continued working on his commissions including the Burlington Arcade, Piccadilly, Christ Church and one other church in Brixton, Kampala Cathedral, Uganda, a hospital in Jerusalem, the Chartered Accountants' Hall in Moorgate (with Belcher), the West Library in Islington and buildings in Marylebone to name but a few. He served as professor of architecture at the Royal College of Art from 1900 to 1923 and professor at Cambridge University where he was considered a gifted teacher and speaker. As an active church member, he ran a bible school for young students and a weekly bible class for prisoners in Wormwood Scrubs Prison. He designed many notable non-conformist churches with Alfred Eustace Habershon (b. 1865 or 1866) who was enumerated as a Greenwich resident in 1901 and had an office in Queen Street, Erith. During this period, with the sculptor Edward Clemens, he also designed several War Memorials including those at Cheadle Hulme, Harrow, and Canterbury. ==30 Euston Square== In 1906, Pite began his commission to build the headquarters of the London, Edinburgh and Glasgow Assurance Company at 30 Euston Square. It was a magnificent building of Portland stone, Grecian in style and spanning seven floors. The building took two years to build and was opened on 22 January 1908. The main entrance hall was decorated with yellow and sage green Doulton Parian ware, tiled arches and a curious ceiling of dentils. The mosaic floor features an astrological design. The director's boardrooms on the first floor are lined in oak with oak strip floors and stunning marble fireplaces as their focal point. The basement housed the records for the Assurance Company; the walls are three feet thick in places and further protected by steel \\"bomb blast\\" doors. The new office building was also fitted with a passenger lift, electric lighting and oil-fired central heating. Considerably modern for its time, Pite's detail was meticulous; each window arch was lined with white glazed brick, which can only be seen if you lean out of the window backwards! Five light wells, also lined in white glazed brick, flooded the lower floors with light. Further light was provided to the basement level by skylights. Pite was asked to add further extensions fronting Melton Street almost as soon as the Euston Square building was finished. He continued to enlarge the building for almost 20 years with the addition of the 9 Melton Street tower being his final work there. With the widening of Euston Road in the late 1920s the final expansion took place; the architect this time was not Pite but one of his contemporaries, Josiah Gunton. The London, Edinburgh and Glasgow Assurance Company had moved out in 1910, the new occupants were the National Amalgamated Approved Society. The building is Grade II* listed due to its significant architectural importance. ==The Marylebone years== At least half of Pite's smaller commissions were in the Marylebone area off Oxford Street. He always retained an office in this vicinity even when he lived in Brixton and Beckenham. At 48 Harley Street, Pite was asked to make alterations on the property for Gibson Sankey. His trademark mosaic tiling, this time in blue glass, still remains today surrounding the entrance. Pite built 82 Mortimer Street circa 1900 for Doctor Dudley Buxton as a family house and consulting rooms. It was constructed of red brick and Portland stone over 4 storeys with a basement and slated mansard. The sculptures flanking the 2nd floor, seated male and female figures, were not by Pite but produced by the firm of Farmer & Brindley, architectural sculptors. Arguably one of Pite's most revered works is 37 Harley Street in South East Marylebone. Built in 1897-9, architectural press at the time proclaimed it to be 'nothing short of a revolution in Harley Street architecture'. Pite regularly attended the Nash-built All Souls Church in Langham Place, where he was invited to design the Peace Memorial floor of 1918/19. Its Byzantine mosaic style is reminiscent of his floor in the London, Edinburgh, and Glasgow Assurance Company's entrance hall. ==Later life== In 1914, Pite moved his home to Hampstead. Following Mary's death, his sister Annie cared for Arthur and his family. His daughter Grace who suffered ill health spent most of her time at Earlywood with Sadler, the family's old nanny as she felt the coastal air more beneficial. In 1930, Pite moved to Beckenham, Kent to live near his brother William and this is where on 27 November 1934 he died from exhaustion and skin cancer. He is buried in London at West Norwood Cemetery.Brian Hanson, 'Pite, Arthur Beresford (1861‚Äì1934)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography ==Events after death== In 2012, the Daily Mail reported about a paranormal investigator, Jeane Trend-Hill, who claimed to have seen Pite's ghost whilst working as the building manager of 30 Euston Square. Trend-Hill subsequently carried out research about Pite, tended his grave and unveiled a plaque to mark the 75th anniversary of his death. ==References== Category:1861 births Category:1934 deaths Category:Architects from London Category:Academics of the Royal College of Art Category:People from Newington, London Category:Burials at West Norwood Cemetery ","title":"Arthur Beresford Pite"},{"id":"3232155","text":"Farfa Abbey () is a territorial abbey in northern Lazio, central Italy. It is one of the most famous abbeys of Europe. It belongs to the Benedictine Order and is located about 60 km from Rome, in the commune of Fara Sabina, of which it is also a hamlet (It. frazione). ==History== View of the abbey from Monte Acuziano A legend in the 12th-century Chronicon Farfense (Chronicle of Farfa)Chronicon Farfense ed. U. Balzani. Rome, 1903. dates the founding of a monastery at Farfa to the time of the Emperors Julian, or Gratian, and attributes the founding to Laurence of Syria, who had come to Rome with his sister, Susannah, together with other monks, and had been made Bishop of Spoleto. According to the tradition, after being named bishop, he became enamoured of the monastic life, and chose a forested hill near the Farfa stream, a tributary of the Tiber, to build a church and a monastery. Archaeological discoveries in 1888More recent and more systematic archaeology at Farfa, undertaken by the British School at Rome, has been summarised in Charles B. McClendon, The Imperial Abbey of Farfa: Architectural Currents of the Early Middle Ages, 1987. find strong evidence that the first monastic establishment was built on the ruins of a pagan temple. This first monastery was devastated by the Vandals in the fifth century. Only a handful of sixth- century finds document the early presence of the monastic community.McClendon 1987. In the seventh century, a wave of Irish monasticism spread over Italy. The foundation the Abbey of Saint Columbanus in Bobbio. and of Farfa by monks from Gaul, about 681, heralded a revival of the great Benedictine tradition in Italy. The Constructio Monasterii Farfensis, which dates probably from 857, relates at length the story of its principal founder Thomas of Maurienne;Maurienne is one of the provinces of Savoy with an ancient capital now Saint-Jean-de-Maurienne. he had made a pilgrimage to Jerusalem and spent three years there. While in prayer before the Holy Sepulchre, the Virgin Mary in a vision warned him to return to Italy, and restore Farfa; and the Duke of Spoleto. Faroald II, who had also had a vision, was commanded to aid in this work. At a very early date we find traces of this legend in connexion with the foundation by three nobles from Benevento of the monastery of St Vincent on the Volturno, over which Farfa claimed jurisdiction. Thomas died in 720; and for more than a century Frankish abbots ruled at Farfa. The abbey's court The Lombard chiefs, and later the Carolingians, succeeded in withdrawing Farfa from obedience to the Bishops of Rieti, and in securing many immunities and privileges for the monastery. If we may credit the Chronicon Farfense, with the exception of the Abbey of Nonatola, Farfa was at this period the most important monastery in Italy both from the point of view of worldly riches and ecclesiastical dignity. In 898, the abbey was sacked by Saracens who then burned it.Mary Stroll, The Medieval Abbey of Farfa: Target of Papal and Imperial Ambitions, (Brill, 1997), 32-33. Between 930 and 936, Farfa was rebuilt by Abbot Ratfredus, who was afterwards poisoned by two wicked monks, Campo and Hildebrand, who divided the wealth of the abbey between them, and ruled over it until Alberic I of Spoleto, Prince of the Romans, called in Odo of Cluny to reform Farfa and other monasteries in the Duchy of Rome. Campo was exiled, and a holy monk with the Merovingian name of Dagibert took his place. At the end of five years, he also died by poison ‚Äî and the moral condition of Farfa was once more deplorable. The monks robbed the altars of their ornaments, and led lives of unbridled vice. Abbey's tower. Owing to the protection of the Emperor Otho, the abbot John III, who had been consecrated circa 967 by the pope, succeeded in re-establishing a semblance of order. But the great reformer of Farfa was Hugues (998-1010). His nomination as abbot was not secured without simony ‚Äî but the success of his government palliates the vice of his election. At this instance, abbots Odilo of Cluny and William of Dijon, visited Farfa, and re-established there the love of piety and of study. The Consuetudines Farfenses drawn up about 1010 under the supervision of Guido, successor to Hugues of Farfa, bear witness to the care with which Hugues organized the monastic life at Farfa. Under the title Destructio Monasterii, Hugues himself wrote a history of the sad period previous to his rule; and again under the title Diminutio Monasterii, and Querimonium, he related the temporal difficulties that encompassed Farfa owing to the ambition of petty Roman lords. These works are very important for the historian of the period. The Last Judgement by Hendrick van den Broeck One of Hugue's successors, Berard I, abbot from 1049 to 1089, made the abbey a great seat of intellectual activity. The monk Gregory of Catino (b. 1060) arranged the archives. To substantiate Farfa's claims and the rights of its monks, he edited the Regesto di Farfa, or Liber Gemniagraphus sive Cleronomialis ecclesi√¶ Farfensis composed of 1324 documents, all very important for the history of Italian society in the 11th century. In 1103, Gregory wrote the Largitorium, or Liber Notarius sive emphiteuticus, a lengthy list of all the concessions, or grants, made by the monastery to its tenants. Having collected all this detailed information, he set to work on a history of the monastery, the Chronicon Farfense; and when he was 70 years old, in order to facilitate reference to his earlier works, he compiled a sort of index which he styled \\"Liber Floriger Chartarum cenobii Farfensis\\". Gregory was a man of real learning, remarkable in that, as early as the eleventh century, he wrote history with accuracy of view-point, and a great wealth of information. The monks of Farfa owned 683 churches or convents; two towns, Centumcell√¶ (Civitavecchia) and Alatri; 132 castles; 16 strongholds; 7 seaports; 8 salt mines; 14 villages; 82 mills; 315 hamlets. All this wealth was a hindrance to the religious life once more. Between 1119 and 1125, Farfa was troubled by the rivalries between Abbot Guido, and the monk Berard who aimed at being abbot. During the Investiture conflict, Farfa was, more or less, on the side of the Ghibellines.The vicissitudes of Farfa during the Investiture Controversy are examined by Mary Stroll, The Medieval Abbey of Farfa: Target of Papal and Imperial ambitions, Leiden 1997. The monks issued an Orthodoxa defensio imperialis in support of the Ghibelline party. The collection of canonical texts contained in the Regesto seems to omit purposely any mention of the canonical texts of the reforming popes of the eleventh century.s But when, in 1262, the victory of the popes over the last of the Hohenstaufen put an end to the Germanic rule in Italy, Farfa sought the protection of Urban IV. At the end of the 14th century the Abbey of Farfa became a cardinalatial in commendam, and since 1842 the Cardinal Bishop of Sabina, a suburbicarian bishop, bears also the title of Abbot of Farfa. The Orsini family stayed to the early 16th century, consecrating the cathedral in 1494. They were succeeded by the Della Rovere, but the Orsini came back and stayed until 1542. Later the monastery was taken over by the Farnese family. Ranuccio Farnese (cardinal) was its abbot commendatory when in 1561 he commissioned the Flemish painter Hendrick van den Broeck to create a large painting of the Last Judgememt for the Abbey.[http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/ranuccio- farnese_%28Dizionario-Biografico%29 FARNESE, Ranuccio di Gigliola Fragnito, in: Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani - Volume 45 (1995) Under the management of Ranuccio's brother Cardinal Alessandro Farnese, the monastery joined the Cassinese Congregation (1567). During the next two centuries in spite of some restorations and new constructions Farfa lost all importance. The monastery was suppressed in 1798 followed another in 1861 by the new Kingdom of Italy. Part of the possessions were sold to private citizens. The heirs of the last owner, Count Volpi, donated part of the monastery owned by them and some land around it to the monks. In 1920, a group of monks sent by Alfredo Ildefonso Schuster, then Abbot of the Abbey of St. Paul Outside the Walls in Rome (attached to the Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls), gave new life to Farfa Abbey in establishing a monastic community, Farfa was declared a national monument but only much later were steps taken to reconstruct and repair the buildings. ==Cathedral== The church's facade. The church's interior The cathedral has a huge Romanesque gate, with magnificent floral friezes. The interior has three naves, and the middle one is surmounted with a lunette representing the Virgin and the Child. The Renaissance hall has several chapels: the most venerated image of Farfa is housed in the Crucifix Chapel. The interior wall of the fa√ßade has a large canvas depicting the Last Judgment (1571) by the Flemish painter Hendrick van den Broeck. Ruins of the ancient 9th century church are included in the church and the monastery. In 1961, in the apse, a precious Roman sarcophagus from the 1st or 2nd century AD was discovered. The large cloister is from the 16th century. The bell tower belongs to the original Carolingian buildings. Inside, at the lower end, Abbot Sichard had an oratory built.The architectural history is outlined in Charles McClendon, The Imperial Abbey of Farfa: Architectural Currents of the Early Middle Ages (Yale Publications in the History of Art) 1987. ==List of abbots== #Thomas of Maurienne (680/700‚Äìc.720) #Aunepert (720‚Äì24) #Lucerius (724‚Äì40) #Fulcoald (740‚Äì59) #Wandelbert (c.759‚Äì61) #Alan (‚Äì769) #Guicpert (769‚Äì70) #Probatus (770‚Äì81) #Ragambald (781‚Äì86) #Altpert (786‚Äì90) #Mauroald (790‚Äì802) #Benedict (802‚Äì15) #Ingoald (815‚Äì30) #Sichard (c.830‚Äì42) #Hilderic (844‚Äì57) #Perto (857‚Äì72) #John I (872‚Äì81) #Anselm (881‚Äì83) #Teuto (883‚Äìc.888) #Nordepert (c.888) #Spento (c.888) #Vitalis (c.889) #Peter (c.890‚Äìc.919) #Rimo (c.920‚Äì930) #Ratfredus (930‚Äì36) #Hildebrand (936‚Äì43/7) #Campo (936‚Äì943/7) #Dagobert (943/7‚Äì952) #John III (967‚Äì) #Hugh (998‚Äì1039) #Berard I (‚Äì1089) #Berard II (‚Äì1099) #Oddo (1099) Abbots commendatory: * Francesco Tomacelli (1400-1406) * Francesco Viterbese (1406-1414) * Giordano Orsini (1420-1437) * Giovanni Orsini (1437-1476) * Latino Orsini (1476) * Cosimo Orsini (1476-1481) * Battista Orsini (1482-1504) * Galeotto Franciotto della Rovere (1505-1513) * Giovanni Giordano Orsini (1513-1517) * Napoleone Orsini (1517-1530) * Francesco Orsini (1530-1546) * Ranuccio Farnese (cardinal) (1546-1564) * Alessandro Farnese (cardinal) (1564-1573) (interregnum) * Alessandro Peretti di Montalto (1591-1623) * Francesco Orsini (1623-1627) * Francesco Barberini (1627-1666) * Carlo Barberini (1666- ? ) ==The village== Some houses of the village The little medieval village of Farfa lies around the abbey and has a population of 42. ==Transport== Nearest railway station, Fara Sabina- Montelibretti, is located at Passo Corese and is 10 km far from the abbey.

The public garden, with its nationally significant collection of rhododendrons hybridized by Charles Dexter, over 1,000 varieties of daylilies and extensive hosta collection, is complemented by three gallery buildings containing a world-class collection of American automobiles, American folk art and a working 1919 carousel and rare carousel figures. The museum's grounds were once the estate of noted rhododendron hybridizer Charles O. Dexter, where between 1921 and 1943 Dexter developed between 5,000 and 10,000 seedlings annually. He planted many on the site. In 1969, Josiah K. Lilly III (1916‚Äì1995) and his wife established Heritage Plantation of Sandwich on the property. == The gardens and grounds == The gardens' principal interest is its collection of thousands of rhododendrons, which now include 125 of the 145 known Dexter cultivars. Their typical bloom time is from Memorial Day Weekend to mid-June. This collection has been painstakingly recovered since 1972, as Dexter's own named cultivars had been scattered without records. Each cultivar had to be recollected from gardens and nurseries up and down the East Coast. The site was prepared in 1972, and by the summer of 1977 it included over 300 plants representing nearly 100 cultivars, with an additional 25 cultivars as small plants in the nursery. All are now mature plantings. Other items of horticultural interest include holly, daylily, herb, hosta, and heather gardens, as well as more than a thousand varieties of trees, shrubs and flowers, many labeled. The grounds also include the Old East Mill, a windmill built in Orleans, Massachusetts in 1800 and extensively restored in 1999‚Äì2000. Visitors may view its interior on special days. In 2002 a labyrinth was added to the grounds, designed by Marty Cain, one of the best-known labyrinth designers in North America. The Hart Family Maze Garden was established on the grounds in 2005, and a Cape Cod Hydrangea garden was added in the fall of 2008. For children and families, Hidden Hollow was added in 2010. It is a Certified Outdoor Nature Classroom where children and families can rediscover the joy of being outside together. In 2015, an adventure park was added on the grounds, after much opposition from neighbors. ==References== == External links == * Category:Botanical gardens in Massachusetts Category:Automobile museums in Massachusetts Category:Carousels in Massachusetts Category:Museums in Barnstable County, Massachusetts Category:Art museums in Massachusetts Category:Folk art museums in the United States Category:Folk art museums in Massachusetts Category:Open-air museums in Massachusetts Category:History museums in Massachusetts Category:Parks in Barnstable County, Massachusetts Category:Buildings and structures in Sandwich, Massachusetts ","title":"Heritage Museums and Gardens"},{"id":"3232180","text":"Apples (Malus species) are used as food plants by the caterpillars of a number of Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths).

In countries where large numbers of sheep are kept for wool, sometimes many thousands in a flock, shearing sheds are vital to house the necessary shearing equipment, and to ensure that the shearers and /or crutchers have a ready supply of dry, empty sheep. The shed also provides space where the wool is classed and pressed into approved wool packs and stored to await transport to market. Location of the shed is important as the site needs to be well drained and in an area reasonably close to most of the flock. It is helpful and will save a lot of money if the shed is located near to the electricity supply. At least some yards will be needed to facilitate shedding and count-outs. Regional variants of shearing shed architecture throughout Australia and New Zealand have been identified through different uses of building materials and local styles of design. During recent years occupational safety and health and animal welfare issues in Australia also have to be considered during shed building or renovating. There should be guard rails around raised shearing boards and loading landings should be fenced to prevent falls. Separate facilities are to be provided for workers' meals. ==Sheep penning area== Woolly Merinos penned for shearing It is usually regarded as necessary to be able to shed, and keep dry, sheep for two days of shearing. Wet or damp sheep may cause health problems for the shearers and damp wool can't be pressed. In many instances sheep are held under the shed or in an adjacent area known as a sweating shed. In the shearing shed the woolly sheep will be penned on a slatted wooden or woven mesh floor above ground level. The sheep entry to the shed is via a wide ramp, with good footholds and preferably enclosed sides. After shearing the shearing shed may also provide warm shelter for newly shorn sheep if the weather is likely to be cold and/or wet. In recent years shearing sheds have usually included improved penning systems to assist with the movement of sheep and ideally will include swing/slide gates to facilitate their closure. A single sheep is sometimes penned in a small pen at the front of the forcing lane to coax the other sheep forward. The slats in a catching pen run in the direction that the sheep are to be dragged. Modern sheds often include a catching pen floor that slopes towards the board to help shearers move their sheep towards their ‚Äústand‚Äù. ==Shearing area== Roustabout removing a fleece from a curved, raised shearing board Ideally shearers should not have to cross the shearing board with their sheep or move them excessive lengths. Earlier shed plans often had the catching pen on the opposite side of the release chutes which necessitated shearers crossing the board and paths with the roustabout. Nowadays the shearing board may be of a curved and/or raised style to save the roustabout extra walking and bending. Sheep may be released through the wall or through a chute in the floor, depending on the plan used. A tongued and grooved wooden floor is best for the shearing board and wool processing area (wool room) as it is easier to keep clean, especially with scrapers and to slide butts of wool along. ==Wool room== This area is planned to reduce walking distances for all shed hands. The shorn fleece is picked up by the roustabout and cast onto a wool table for skirting, rolling and classing, before being placed in the appropriate wool bin. Wool bins should be made of a solid material in order that the different lines do not mix. Slatted wool tables are of two styles: round, revolving tables, which are handy if there is only one wool-roller; or the traditional rectangular type. Adequate lighting and ventilation is provided for all shearers and shedhands who work in the shed. Good light is essential for quality shearing, wool classing and grinding etc., and is a very significant factor affecting sheep flow in the penning area. In the southern hemisphere southern walls can have translucent sheeting installed there as a source of natural lighting because direct sunlight is never a problem. Good ventilation is essential to provide fresh air and improve working conditions during hot weather. Shearing sheds can become extremely hot, even in cooler climates, during the summer. The body heat of the sheep and the insulating qualities of wool contribute to the problem. Ceiling fans are reasonably priced and helpful in this regard. The grinding area (for sharpening combs and cutters) should be situated away from walkways to reduce the risk of injury. Power operated, self pinning wool presses with inbuilt scales, which produce standard wool bales, have made a major contribution to shearing shed productivity. The wool producer is responsible for ensuring that the shearing shed is ready for shearing by testing the equipment, cleaning, disinfecting the shed and supplying emery papers, wool packs etc. Shearing sheds are often inspected during shearing for compliance to various shed standards for the production of quality wool. Basically this means that the shed is clean, free of rubbish, dogs and twine. ==See also== * Roustabout * Sheep shearer * Sheep shearing * Shearing machinery * Wool classing ==References== *Sheep Management and Wool Technology, J B D'Arcy (1986) *The Shedhand‚Äôs Manual, Rosalind Martel (1989) *Cottle, D.J.

McDowell is a designer working in narrative media. He is a strong advocate of world building and immersive design and integrates digital technology and traditional design technique in his work. He has created a holistic design process that incorporates ideation, inception, prototyping, and production for tangible story worlds. ==Early work== Alex McDowell was born in Borneo, to British parents. His father, H Blair McDowell, was an engineer for Royal Dutch Shell, and his brother, Jonathan McDowell, is a London-based architect at Matter. He attended Quaker boarding schools from age 7 to 18. McDowell wanted to become a painter from an early age, and studied fine art at the Central School of Art and Design in London where in 1975 he and Sebastian Conran staged the Sex Pistols first headline concert. The consequent immersion into the London punk scene led to designing and printing T-shirts for Malcolm McLaren and Vivienne Westwood's legendary King's Road shop Sex. With musician Glen Matlock, he founded graphic studio Rocking Russian Design in 1978, which is where Neville Brody started his career. McDowell designed album covers for punk rock groups and a wide variety of musicians including Rich Kids, Siouxsie and the Banshees, The Clash, and Iggy Pop. In 1979, McDowell was commissioned to design Pop's Soldier album. Iggy asked him to make his first three music videos for Soldier, and so, a year before the launch of MTV, and knowing very little about the role, McDowell became a production designer. In 1981 he co-founded design studio Da Gama, alongside renowned typographer and designer John Warwicker, the first studio in London to simultaneously art direct record sleeves and art direct/direct videos for bands. He began to work with director Tim Pope, designing a famous series of videos for The Cure, among many others. Pope and McDowell traveled widely with many bands, making a video with Depeche Mode at the Berlin Wall, with Queen in Munich, and Neil Young in California. Gradually his production design work overtook his work as graphic designer until in 1986 he moved permanently to Los Angeles to work in the burgeoning music video and commercials industry in Hollywood. During the late 1980s and 1990s, he designed the sets for over one hundred music videos including artists like Madonna, Michael Jackson, ZZ Top, Aerosmith and others. He moved from production company Limelight, where he designed and directed music videos, including \\"Paradise\\" (1988) for Nigerian singer Sade, to the prolific Propaganda Films, co-owned by director David Fincher. McDowell worked for a solid year with Fincher, seven days a week, designing sets for Madonna's videos \\"Express Yourself\\", \\"Oh Father\\" and \\"Vogue\\" amongst many others, and commercials for companies like Levi's, Converse, Nike, Pepsi, Revlon, Sony, Coca-Cola, and Chanel. As the young video and commercial directors that McDowell was working with started to attract feature producers, McDowell too was pulled towards film. His first feature was also the first to feature virtual reality, The Lawnmower Man. Back at Propaganda Films, his work was seen by director Alex Proyas who asked him to design The Crow (1994), an independent fantasy action film starring Brandon Lee, which opened at the top of the box office and went on cult status. == Filmography == ===Production design=== Beginning with The Crow in 1994, McDowell began to production design features back-to-back, working with directors like Terry Gilliam (Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, 1998), and again with David Fincher for one of the most controversial films of 1999, Fight Club. In 1999, he was asked by Steven Spielberg to design Minority Report. This film, which began with no script and involved two separate pre-production design phases, provoked McDowell to develop a new design methodology that built a holistic world for the narrative, within which the script evolved, and created the first fully digital art department. When the film released in 2002, it was noted for its deep attention to the detail, and the reality of this future world. In addition, it became apparent that the visionary technologies that grew from the world and became part of the landscape of the film one by one became realized in the real-world. From the experience during the film and observation of its long-term world-facing outcomes McDowell developed a narrative design practice known as world building, which continues to be the basis of his creative practice. As a concrete example of the design fiction influence of the film John Underkoffler, who had acted as science advisor and collaborator with McDowell for the art-science of film's design had built a start-up, Oblong Industries, to produce systems using gesture modeled on the fictional ideas that he proposed in the world build of the film. *The Lawnmower Man (1992) *The Crow (1994) *Crying Freeman (1995) *Fear (1996) *The Crow: City of Angels (1996) *Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (1998) *Fight Club (1999) *The Affair of the Necklace (2001) *Minority Report (2002) *The Cat in the Hat (2003) *The Terminal (2004) *Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005) *Corpse Bride (2005) *Breaking and Entering (2006) *Bee Movie (2007) *Watchmen (2009) *Fantastic Mr. Fox (2009) (visual consultant) *Rise of the Guardians (2012) (visual consultant) *Upside Down (2012) *Man of Steel (2013) ===Production=== *Bunraku (2010) (co-producer) ==World Building== As opposed to World building in interactive and multi-player games, the world building practice as initiated by McDowell in 2000 describes a rigorous narrative design system capable of addressing massively complex challenges in both fictional and real-world scenarios. World building is the engine that initiates each output. The practice that McDowell launched upturned the cinematic tradition of linear storytelling that conventionally springs from a funded script or a client brief. In world building a unique world is developed as a container for multiple narratives. Each world is developed in cross- disciplinary collaboration and expertise, distributing broad research to a holistic knowledge-base known as a Mandala, which in turn provokes deeper layers of research, culminating in multiple narratives. These core narratives trigger non-linear prototyping to produce tangible outcomes for change. World building combines the power of rigorous research and collective storytelling to make sense of the rapidly changing world. In this unique time of exponential progress and massive disruption, world building enables organizations to envision, design, and experience preferred futures ‚Äî and create the stable steps to realize these futures. Increasingly the practice has evolved to build worlds that prototype the future and provoke change. ==Current work== Experimental.design is a multi-platform, cross-discipline narrative design studio at the forefront of World Building. Led by McDowell, every project and partnership begins with the creation of a world. In April 2015, McDowell was awarded the BritWeek Business Innovation Award. McDowell currently serves as a professor of cinema practice at the University of Southern California. McDowell was named the William Cameron Menzies endowed chair in Production Design in 2014. ==World Building Media Lab== In addition to teaching world building, he directs the USC World Building Media Lab (WbML), where McDowell and his interdisciplinary students engage in funded research to build immersive worlds for storytelling and vast collaboration for synchronous media technologies. In 2014, the research lab was awarded the prestigious Future Voice Award at the Interaction Awards. The lab is engaged in an ongoing research project to develop a new visual language for molecular biology and the biological sciences, expressed in the World in a Cell, development of an immersive virtual reality experience of the interior of a single Pancreatic Beta Cell. In a funded partnership with the USC Bridge Institute, the project aims to create outcomes that include high school and undergraduate teaching platforms, public-facing exhibitions, and a tool for scientific investigation and collaboration. https://dornsife.usc.edu/bridge- institute/world-in-a-single-cell/ https://staging.worldinacell.com/ ==World Building Institute== In October 2008, McDowell founded the World Building Institute. The preeminent knowledge space for designers and creators in cross- platform narrative media, the Institute provides opportunities for creative thinkers across multiple disciplines to explore how world building and narrative design can be applied in broad contexts. Current members include: Christopher Bailey, Wolfgang Bergmann, Jim Bissell, John Seely Brown, Rick Carter, Chris Defaria, Dr. Syliva Earle, Scott Fisher, Terry Jones, Ann Pendleton-Jullian, Yuval Sharon, among many others. From 2007 to 2016 the World Building Institute hosted the Science of Fiction Festival every eighteen months. Centered around how creativity and art-science projects affect the human experience, the event reaches upwards of 300 participants each year, from corporate leaders to youth from 6‚Äì16. In 2014, the practice-based initiative focused on how world building can change the future of storytelling, thus providing an opportunity for fiction to be the testing ground for reality within the World Building Media Lab's Rilao project. The Institute has a strong presence in Europe and for the past decade has hosted workshops at the Berlin Film Festival, at the Berlinale Talents. https://www.berlinale-talents.de/bt/program/telelecture/967 https://www.berlinale-talents.de/bt/program/telelecture/3152 ==Awards== In 2002 he won the San Diego Film Critics Society award in the Best Production Design category for his work on Minority Report and, in 2004, the Art Directors Guild award for Excellence in Production Design for The Terminal. In 2006, McDowell was named Royal Designer for Industry by the RSA, the UK's most prestigious design society, and was appointed Visiting Artist at the MIT Media Lab. ==References== ==External links== *University of Southern California Faculty Page *World Building Institute *World Building Media Lab *5D GlobalStudio * *The Terminal Diary Category:1955 births Category:British film designers Category:Living people Category:Malaysian people of English descent Category:Alumni of the Central School of Art and Design ","title":"Alex McDowell"},{"id":"3232277","text":"The A939 'Lecht Road' connects the A96 at Nairn on the Moray Coast with the A95 Grantown on Spey, then it continues to the A93 at Ballater by way of the Grampian Mountains, passing Tomintoul and the Lecht Ski Centre.

He co-authored two books with Charles Berlitz, including The Roswell Incident. ==Career== Interested in UFOs since he was a teenager, Moore attended Thiel College, located in Greenville, Pennsylvania graduating in 1965. He taught language and humanities at various high schools. He became Arizona state section director of the Mutual UFO Network and left teaching to pursue a career as a freelance writer. Moore wrote The Philadelphia Experiment - Project Invisibility with Charles Berlitz in 1979, about an alleged naval military experiment popularly known as the Philadelphia Experiment aboard the USS Eldridge in 1943. In 1980, Moore wrote The Roswell Incident with writing partner Charles Berlitz, which alleged the Roswell UFO incident had involved the crash of an extraterrestrial space ship. In May 1987, Moore along with ufologists Jaime Shandera and Stanton Friedman circulated the Majestic 12 documents that purported the existence of a high-level policy making group overseeing UFOs and extraterrestrials. At a 1989 MUFON conference, Moore claimed that he had been engaged in \\"disinformation\\" activities against Paul Bennewitz on behalf of the Air Force Office of Special Investigations. == Critical reception == According to author Barna William Donovan, The Philadelphia Experiment - Project Invisibility was \\"largely dismissed even by the most committed conspiracy and supernatural buffs as nothing more than a shoddy, uncritical repeat of a lingering and completely unsubstantiated urban myth.\\" Donovan wrote that critics have deemed The Roswell Incident \\"a collection of wild hearsay\\" offering \\"second - and third-hand accounts Berlitz and Moore then use for fantastic speculation and to jump to a lot of unwarranted conclusions\\", and that when critics and skeptics characterized the Majestic 12 documents as fraudulent, \\"The accusing fingers were pointing at Moore.\\" ==Books== * The Philadelphia Experiment - Project Invisibility (1979) * The Roswell Incident (1980) ==See also== *UFO conspiracy theory ==References== Category:American male non-fiction writers Category:American UFO writers Category:American conspiracy theorists Category:UFO conspiracy theorists Category:Ufologists Category:Roswell UFO incident Category:1940s births Category:Living people ","title":"Bill Moore (ufologist)"},{"id":"3232292","text":"Fossegrim playing a harp in a waterfall under the statue to the violinist Ole Bull in Bergen Fossegrimen by Nils Bergslien (1853-1928) Fossegrim, also known simply as the grim (Norwegian) or Str√∂mkarlen (Swedish), is a water spirit or troll in Scandinavian folklore. Fossegrim plays the fiddle, especially the Hardanger fiddle. Fossegrim has been associated with a mill spirit (kvernknurr) and is related to the water spirit (neck) and is sometimes also called n√§cken in Sweden. It is associated with rivers (Swedish name \\"Str√∂mkarlen\\" means \\"The River Man\\") and particularly with waterfalls (foss in Norwegian) and mill races. Benjamin Thorpe, Northern Mythology: comprising the principal popular traditions and superstitions of Scandinavia, north Germany, and the Netherlands, 3 vols. London: Lumley, 1851-52, , Volume 2 Scandinavian Popular Traditions and Superstitions, p. 23. Eugen Mogk, Mythologie, Grundri√ü der germanischen Philologie 1, Strasbourg: Tr√ºbner, 1891, , p. 1028 equated them, but Reimund Kvideland and Henning Sehmsdorf, Scandinavian Folk Belief and Legend, Nordic Series 15, Minneapolis: University of Minnesota, 1988, , p. 248, distinguish the \\"mill sprite\\" as a mischievous creature who punishes grinding on Christian holy days. ==Description== Fossegrim is described as an exceptionally talented fiddler: the sounds of forest, wind and water play over his fiddle strings. Fossegrims can be induced to teach the skill. The Swedish str√∂mkarl's lay is said to have eleven variations, the final one being reserved for the night spirits because when it is played, \\"tables and benches, cup and can, gray-beards and grandmothers, blind and lame, even babes in the cradle\\" will begin to dance.Jacob Grimm, Teutonic Mythology, 4th ed. tr. James Stallybrass, Volume 2, London: Bell, 1883, , pp. 492-93. Fossegrim is said to be willing to teach away his skills in exchange for a food offering made on a Thursday evening and in secrecy: a white he-goat thrown with head turned away into a waterfall that flows northwards,Jacob Grimm, Teutonic Mythology, p. 493. or smoked mutton (fenal√•r) stolen from the neighbour's storage four Thursdays in a row. If there is not enough meat on the bone, he will only teach the supplicant how to tune the fiddle. If the offering is satisfactory, he will take the pupil's right hand and draw the fingers along the strings until they all bleed, after which he will be able to play so well that \\"the trees shall dance and torrents in their fall stand still\\". Jacob Grimm cites a variant in 18th-century Chorographia Bahusiensis by Johan √ñdman (1682-1749) according to which the Str√∂mkarlen must be offered redemption or he will merely break his instrument and weep bitterly. Famous fiddlers who were rumored to have learnt from the Fossegrim include Torgeir Augundsson (1801‚Äì1872) known as Myllarguten and Ole Bull (1810‚Äì1880) whose statue in the centre of Bergen depicts a fossegrim playing his harp under the falling water. ==In Popular Culture== *Fossegrim is featured in the digital card game Mythgard (2019) as a rare minion in the Norden faction. ==References== Category:Norwegian folklore Category:Swedish folklore Category:Water spirits Category:Germanic mythology Category:Supernatural legends Category:Scandinavian folklore Category:Scandinavian legendary creatures ","title":"Fossegrim"},{"id":"3232293","text":"Sligo is a town in the North West of the Republic of Ireland and the county town of County Sligo, and has produced several noted artists, entertainers, politicians and business-people. == Music == *Thomas Connellan, harper/composer *William Connellan, harper/composer *Naisse Mac Cithruadh, musician *James Morrison, musician *Paddy Killoran, musician *Michael Coleman, musician *Mary O'Hara, singer and harpist *Seamie O'Dowd, multi- instrumentalist and former member of Dervish *Tabby Callaghan, musician, The X Factor finalist *Kian Egan, member of Westlife *Markus Feehily, member of Westlife *Shane Filan, member of Westlife *Carmel Gunning, traditional Irish musician and singer *Perry Blake, singer and songwriter *Lisa Stanley, Irish country singer/songwriter and daughter of Masie McDaniel == Arts and literature == *Muireadhach Albanach √ì D√°laigh, Ollamh of poetry at Lissadell and crusader *Giolla √çosa M√≥r Mac Fir Bhisigh, historian, scribe compiler of the Yellow Book of Lecan, Great Book of Lecan *Tadhg Dall √ì hUiginn, file/poet, author of many poems in classical D√°n D√≠reach style *Dubhaltach Mac Fhirbhisigh, Irish scribe, author of the Great Book of Irish Genealogies *Owen Connellan, scholar, RIA *Thady Connellan, scholar, published Irish-English dictionary 1814 *Leland Bardwell, poet, novelist and playwright. *Neil Jordan, filmmaker and novelist; won an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay for The Crying Game *Brian Leyden, short story writer and novelist *Joe McGowan, author and historian *William Butler Yeats, poet *Jack Butler Yeats, painter and cartoonist == Historical and political figures == *Cairbre Mac N√©ill, Irish king and warrior, son of Niall of the Nine Hostages *Tuathal Mac Cormac Maelgarbh ua Cairbre, King of Ireland?, conqueror of Brega *Nath √≠ of Achad an R√≠, 6th century Irish ecclesiastic *Feich√≠n of Fore, Irish ecclesiastic *St. Attracta of Killaraght, Irish ecclesiastic, 5th century, Saint *Fearghal √ì Gadhra, Chief of Coolavin, patron of the Annals of the Four Masters *Brian Luighnech Ua Conchobhair, King of Cairbre Drom Cliabh, ancestor of the √ì Conchobar Sligigh, son of Toirdealbhach M√≥r √ì Conchobar, High King of Ireland 1106-1156 *Liam Pilkington, IRA commander, 3rd western division,1921-23.

It is held every Labor Day weekend with the first start scheduled for Friday afternoon. The 238-mile race was started in 1932 and takes racers from Stamford east to Buzzards Bay and back. The first race had 23 starters with five finishers. The race has been held every year since its founding, except for three years during World War II. It is also the final race of the Northern Ocean Racing Trophy series, the New England Lighthouse Series and the Doublehanded Ocean Racing Trophy. In 1982 the race was described by Bob Bavier in Yachting as one of the \\"yachting classics.\\" and: :The greatest distance races of the world have several things in common -- a challenging course, competitive fleets and an interesting array of famous yachts. By those standards, the Stamford Yacht Club's Vineyard Race rates close to the top. Like a miniature Fastnet, the Vineyard has a combination of coastal cruising, where currents play a big role, a stretch of ocean sailing, and a mark to round -- the Buzzards Bay tower -- before returning. The fastest time to complete the Vinyard course was set by Fujin in 2017. The Bieker 52 catamaran, skippered by Greg Slyngstad of Seattle Yacht Club, broke the old course record by five hours, finishing the course in 15 hours, six minutes and 50 seconds:06:50 hours. The fastest time by a monohull was set by the US Merchant Marine Academy Foundation's Volvo 70, WARRIOR, the same year. Skippered by Stephen Murray, Jr., WARRIOR covered the course in 17 hours, 42 minutes and 9 seconds. The race is several races in one. Competitors must navigate Long Island Sound before passing into Block Island Sound through one of several narrow passages where there are tough tidal currents. After rounding the tower they must leave Block Island to starboard before heading back into the Sound. A typical race involves a variety of conditions. In 2019 Stamford Yacht Club held the 85th running of The Vineyard Race. == External links == * Stamford Yacht Club web site Category:Sailing competitions in the United States Category:Recurring events established in 1932 Category:Yachting races Category:Sailing in Connecticut ","title":"Vineyard Race"},{"id":"3232303","text":"Nonantola (Modenese: ) is a town and comune in the province of Modena in the Emilia-Romagna region of northern Italy. It is in the Po Valley about from Modena on the road to Ferrara. ==History== In ancient times the territory of Nonantola was inhabited by the Celtic tribes, more specifically by the Boii. After the Roman conquest of Northern Italy (Cisalpine Gaul) the Boii were subjugated, and as a result they started to slowly speak Latin, giving rise to the local Gallo-Romance language, a variety of Gallo-Italic languages. Nonantola's history is strongly connected to the Benedictine monastery founded by the Lombards. Its creation in 752 totally supplanted the old Roman past and was the premise of Nonantola's High Middle Ages importance, as it was chosen for the meeting in 883 between Pope Marinus I and the emperor Charles the Fat. Pope Hadrian III was buried here. In the year 890 the town and the monastery were devastated by Hungarian marauders. Nonantola was disputed between Modena and Bologna until it fell under Este's suzerainty (as an autonomous commune) in 1412. A constitution was issued in 1419. Nonantola remained a pacific agricultural centre well into the 17th century, when it had several urbanistic renovations. In the Napoleonic Wars the abbey lost all its territories, which were acquired by the count Leonardo Salimbeni. In 1898 his palace, which once belonged to the monastery, was sold to the comune of Nonantola, becoming the Town Hall. In this age the agriculture started dying out, as the Modenese nobles used archaic methods of cultivation, and industries, trade and water were lacking. During the German occupation in World War II the Nonantolani hosted 73 Jewish children, enabling them to flee to Switzerland. The city was awarded a Cross of War Medal for Military Valour for this feat and for its contribution to the Italian resistance movement. Today Nonantola is an increasingly important cultural and tourist resort. East end of Nonantola abbey ===Abbey=== Nonantola Abbey a Benedictine monastery, was founded in 752 by the Lombard duke of Friuli, St. Anselm. It was richly endowed by King Aistulph, but of the older edifices only traces remain. Pope Stephen II appointed Anselm its first abbot, and presented the relics of St. Sylvester to the abbey, named in consequence S. Sylvester de Nonantula. After the death of Aistulph (756), Anselm was banished to Monte Cassino by the new king, Desiderius, but was restored by Charlemagne after seven years. Up to 1083 it was an imperial monastery, and its discipline often suffered severely on account of imperial interference in the election of abbots. In the beginning of the Conflict of Investitures it sided with the emperor, until forced to submit to the pope by Matilda of Canossa in 1083. It finally declared itself openly for the pope in 1111 when Placidus of Nonantola wrote his De honore Ecclesi√¶, a defence of the papal position during the Conflict of Investitures. From the 13th century onwards the monastery decayed badly; the final decline began in 1419, when it came under the jurisdiction of commendatory abbots. In 1514 the abbey came into the possession of the Cistercians, but continued to decline until it was finally suppressed by Clement XIII in 1768. On 23 January 1821 Pius VII restored the monastery, with the provision that its prelature nullius should belong to the Archbishopric of Modena. ==Main sights== Nonantola contains several remains from the Middle Ages. These include the two towers called dei Modenesi and dei Bolognesi, and the Pieve of S. Michael Archangel (9th century). The main monument, however, is the renowned abbey of San Sylvester Romanesque basilica, erected from the 8th century onwards. In the years 1913-17 it was restored to its original early 12th-century condition. ==References== Category:Cities and towns in Emilia-Romagna ","title":"Nonantola"},{"id":"3232310","text":"Emmet Friars (born 14 September 1985 in Derry, Northern Ireland) is a footballer, who plays for NIFL Championship side Limavady United. ==Career== ===Notts County=== Emmet began his career as a trainee with Notts County, but failed to establish himself in the first team.

Takuma had a long history of mentally disturbed and anti-social behavior, and an extensive criminal record including a conviction for rape. He stabbed to death eight students and seriously wounded fifteen others at Ikeda Elementary School in a knife attack that lasted several minutes. Takuma was convicted in August 2003 and executed on 14 September 2004. == Early life == Mamoru Takuma was born on 23 November 1963 in Itami, Hy≈çgo Prefecture, Japan. As a child, he displayed unusual and anti-social behavior, including blocking traffic on highways and setting fire to cats. During his second year of high school, Takuma reportedly attacked a teacher and ran away from home for several months. Takuma dropped out of school and got into a physical confrontation with his father, who tried to seek psychiatric help for him as a result. After the hospital refused to treat Takuma, his father disowned him. Takuma worked at a gas station for several months until enlisting in the Japan Air Self Defense Force, but was discharged a year later for having sexual intercourse with a minor. In 1984, Takuma and his mother left his family house and purchased an apartment, leaving his oldest brother and father by themselves. They lived together for a year and a half, until his father came back for his wife. == Criminal history == In November 1984, Takuma was arrested for raping a woman while collecting rent for a condominium management company, and sentenced to three years in prison. Takuma was detained at a juvenile detention center in Nara from 1986 to 1989. Takuma was also arrested for driving his car in reverse gear on the Hanshin Expressway but released after he was found mentally unfit. After his release from prison, Takuma moved to Ikeda and found work as a bus driver and garbage truck driver. Takuma's coworkers described him as a quiet and unremarkable man, but a bit of a loner who did not like dealing with customers. In 1998, Takuma was fired after assaulting a passenger over the smell of her perfume. Takuma found a new job as maintenance man at Itami Elementary School, 6 kilometers away from Ikeda. On 3 March 1999, Takuma dissolved some of his own tranquilizer, temazepam, into the tea served in the teachers' room at Itami Elementary School, sending 4 people to the hospital. Takuma was arrested and sent to a psychiatric hospital, where he was diagnosed with schizophrenia, and later jumped from the roof of the psychiatric hospital in an attempt to commit suicide but failed. After one month's treatment, Takuma was judged to be \\"capable of taking care of himself\\". After his release from the psychiatric hospital, Takuna continued to display odd behavior, stating that he was a survivor of the Japan Airlines Flight 123 crash. In November 1999, Takuma was arrested on suspicion of entering a private home, but the charges were dropped. Takuma managed to get a job as a taxi driver in September 2000, but was fired on October 16 after he assaulted a hotel bellhop in Osaka and broke the bellhop's nose. Takuma was also kicked out of several apartments for, among other things, throwing his garbage out from the balcony. On 23 May 2001, Takuma voluntarily admitted himself into a psychiatric hospital for depression, but left the next day without treatment. Takuma was arrested at least eleven times and had married four times before June 2001. In October 1998, Takuma was arrested on suspicion of assaulting his ex-wife. == Massacre == On 8 June 2001, the day of his court hearing for the bellhop assault case, Takuma went on a murderous rampage in the Ikeda Elementary School where he had worked as a janitor. Takuma began to attack students and staff with a kitchen knife until he was wrestled down by staff within minutes. In the quick attack, Takuma killed eight students (seven 8-year-old girls and one 7-year-old boy) and seriously wounded thirteen other children and two teachers. Takuma was described as being in an extremely confused state when arrested, at first repeating \\"I went to the elementary school\\", and then saying \\"I went to the train station and stabbed 100 people with my knife. I did not go to the elementary school.\\" Takuma also stated: :„Äå‰Ωï„ÇÇ„Åã„ÇÇÂ´å„Å´„Å™„Å£„Åü„ÄÇ‰ΩïÂõû„ÇÇËá™ÊÆ∫„ÇíÂõ≥„Å£„Åü„ÅåÊ≠ª„Å´„Åç„Çå„Å™„ÅÑ„ÄÇÊçï„Åæ„Åà„Å¶Ê≠ªÂàë„Å´„Åó„Å¶„Åª„Åó„Åã„Å£„Åü„ÄÇ„Äç : Nani mo kamo iya ni natta.

I wanted to be caught and be given a death sentence.\\" Takuma also hated \\"elite\\" children who attended Ikeda Elementary School. == Trial and execution == Takuma's lawyers argued that he was suffering from temporary insanity at the time of the attack, but the psychiatrist who had initially diagnosed Takuma as schizophrenic told the court he later determined that Takuma actually had paranoid personality disorder. At one point, Takuma claimed to have been influenced by the Shimonoseki Station massacre that occurred two years earlier and sought to imitate it himself. On August 28, 2003, Takuma was found guilty of multiple counts of murder and sentenced to death. Takuma remained unrepentant, refusing to apologize to the families of the victims, and asked only for the sentence to be fulfilled as fast as possible. In court, Takuma engaged in intentionally provocative behavior, including yawning, shaking his body, and staring at victims' family members. His statement was, \\"I should have used gasoline, so I could have killed more than I did.\\" On the last day of the trial, Takuma still expressed no guilt or remorse, and continued to insult the victims' families until the judge removed him. The sentence was carried out unusually quickly by Japanese standards (condemned prisoners in Japan usually spend many years on death row), and Takuma was executed by hanging only a year later at the Osaka Detention House on September 14, 2004. ==Influence== Kaoru Kobayashi, who sexually assaulted and murdered 7-year-old Kaede Ariyama in Nara in November 2004, considered Takuma to be a charismatic murderer and sought a speedy execution like him.

The Pallavas fought a series of wars in the northern Vengi region, before Mahendravarma decimated his chief enemies at Pullalur (according to Pallava grants at Kuram, kasakudi and tadantottam). Although Mahendravarma saved his capital, he lost the northern provinces to Pulakeshin.KAN Sastri, A History of South India, p136 Tamil literature flourished under his rule, with the rise in popularity of Tevaram written by Appar and Sambandhar. Mahendravarman I was the author of the play Mattavilasa Prahasana which is a sanskrit satire and another play called Bhagavadajjuka. Mahendravarma was succeeded to the throne by his more famous son Narasimhavarman I in 630 CE. who defeated Pulakeshin II of Chalukya dynasty and ransacked the Chalukyan capital city of Vatapi (also known as Badami). ==Patronage of arts and architecture== Mahendrravarma was a great patron of letters and architecture. He constructed a Lighthouse in Mahabalipuram and also constructed Kanchi University where vedas, Buddhism, Jainism, Painting, Music & Dance was taught. He was the pioneer of Rock-cut Architecture amongst the Pallavas. The inscription at the rock-cut Mandagapattu Tirumurti Temple hails him as Vichitrachitta and claims that the temple was built without wood, brick, mortar or metal. The five-celled cave temple at Pallavaram was also built during his reign as was the Kokarneswarar Temple, Thirukokarnam of Pudukottai, Tamil Nadu.KAN Sastri, A History of South India, p412He made Kudimiya malai Inscription. His paintings are found in Sittanavasal Cave (Tamil Nadu). Fine examples of his rock-cut temples can be witnessed at Mahabalipuram, (Satyagirinathar and Satyagirishwarar twin temples), Siyamangalam (the Siva temple Avanibhajana Pallaveswaram) in North Arcot district and the upper rock-cut temple at Trichy. Apart from the Siva temples, Mahendravarma also excavated a few Vishnu cave temples, the Mahendravishnugrha at Mahendravadi, and the Ranganatha Temple at Singavaram in present-day Gingee (then North Arcot district).KAN Sastri, A History of South India, p413 He was also the author of the play Mattavilasa Prahasana, a farce concerning Buddhist and Saiva ascetics. He is also claimed to be the author of another play called Bhagavadajjuka,. This is evident by the inscriptions found at Mamandur cave shrines (near Kanchipuram - this place is mentioned as Dusi Mamandur to avoid confusions with other places by the same name). However, there is an alternate view that attributes this play to Bodhayana.KAN Sastri, A History of South India, p313 ==Religion== Mahendrravarma was initially a patron of the Jainism, but he converted into the Saiva faith under the influence of the Saiva saint Appar. According to Dhivyacharitam a Sanskrit work on life of Alwars written in 12th century, Yatotkara perumal (mahavishnu), enshrined in Kancheepuram left the city along with his great devotee Thirumalisai Alvar, because the Vaishnava Alwar faced tough persecution and exilement from the king who had at least temporarily come under the influence of Jainism.KAN Sastri, A History of South India, p 382‚Äì383Stein, p 122 ==Notes== ==References== * * * Category:7th-century Indian monarchs Category:Pallava kings Category:Ancient Indian dramatists and playwrights Category:7th-century Indian writers Category:Indian male writers Category:Indian male dramatists and playwrights Category:Dramatists and playwrights from Tamil Nadu ","title":"Mahendravarman I"},{"id":"3232344","text":"Luke Joseph Duffy (1890 ‚Äì 3 August 1961) was an Irish trades unionist and Labour Party politician, who served for five years as a Senator. Born in Gurteen, County Sligo in 1890, Duffy's first job was as a draper's apprentice in Moon's of Galway. By 1910, he was an active member of the local branch of the Irish Drapers' Assistants Association (IDAA), and he was elected branch secretary in 1911. In the following years, he was vice-president and trustee of the Trades Council, secretary of the Volunteers and of the Galway City Gaelic Athletic Association, and active in the Irish National Foresters. In 1914, he chaired the IDAA's annual conference in Dublin. Sacked from Moon's for union activity in 1916, he was appointed Munster organiser of the IDAA. A few years later, he was elected as general secretary of the renamed Irish Distributive and Administrative Trade Union. In 1933, he became general secretary of the Irish Labour Party. In 1944, he was elected by the Industrial and Commercial Panel as a member of the 5th Seanad. He was re-elected in 1948 to the 6th Seanad, but resigned when appointed to the board of the newly established Industrial Development Authority for Industry and Commerce (IDAIC), by Daniel Morrissey, Minister for Industry and Commerce. This appointment was for a term of five years through 25 May 1954. He resigned from the Senate to accept this appointment and also relinquished his position as General Secretary of the Labour Party. In his appointment to the IDAIC Duffy worked at developing strategies that would ultimately lead to attracting direct foreign investment into Ireland. The IDAIC was placed on statutory footing in 1950. Duffy spent the rest of his career in advancing the aims and objectives of the IDAIC.

It is often used to intimidate the opposition, but can also be used in a humorous spirit. Trash- talk is often characterized by use of hyperbole or figurative language, such as \\"Your team can't run! You run like honey on ice!\\" Puns and other wordplay are commonly used. Trash-talk was commonly used by the heavyweight boxing champion Muhammad Ali in the 1960s and 70s. In 1963, Ali even released a popular full-length record album consisting largely of trash-talk poetry. It was entitled I Am the Greatest!, a phrase that became his signature line. Since then, it has become common for boxers, wrestlers, and many other sports competitors to use trash-talk. However, in amateur sports ranks, trash talking is generally frowned upon as unsportsmanlike conduct (especially in youth leagues). UFC Lightweight Champion Conor McGregor is a more recent example of a prominent trash-talker, while former UFC fighter Chael Sonnen is considered by some to be the greatest trash talker in UFC history. Although the practice of trying to distract opponents by verbal abuse is common to virtually all sports, other sports sometimes have their own terminology for verbal abuse: for example, cricket calls it sledging and in ice hockey it is called chirping. The Wealdstone Raider, a notorious fan hailing from Wealdstone, is known for trash-talking the opposition and opposition's fans. Trash-talk has become a debatable term especially in North American sports, with the greatest trash talkers being acknowledged for both their trash talking skills as much as their athletic and mental abilities. == Usage == In sports, trash-talk most commonly comes in the form of insults to an opposing player's playing ability or physical appearance. The intended effects of trash-talk are to create rivalry between the players and increase psychological pressure of opposing players to perform well. The quality of performance of players under the pressure of trash-talk is debated, but one study found that participants who were subject to a trash-talk message exerted more effort in completing their task and perceived their opponent with more incivility and rivalry, when compared to participants who were subject to a neutral, irrelevant, or no message at all. Trash-talk is more prevalent in contact sports than non- contact sports, and it is also more prevalent between male competitors than female competitors. ==Smack talk== Smack talk is a slang term seen in chat channels in chat room, blog, and massively multiplayer online game (MMOG) conversations. The term came about in the early 1990s. It generally refers to the use of threatening or intentionally inflammatory language. Smack talk can also be used with bullying, whether that be face-to-face interaction, or cyber-bullying. Smack talk is also a slang term used in sports. It refers to inflammatory comments made by a person or team in order to insult, anger, annoy or be boisterous toward their opponents. Although it began as a term used by sports fans and athletes, it has spread to all areas of culture where competition takes place. In the United States, it is synonymous with \\"trash talk\\". The social interaction within MMOGs has been observed to be quite active and often leads to long-term social relationships.Social interactions in massively multiplayer online role-playing gamers, CyberPsychology and Behavior, Volume 10, pp. 575-583, H. Cole and Griffiths, MD., 2007 MMOG groups, such as \\"teams\\", \\"guilds\\" or \\"corporations\\", are composed of groups of people who often initially have no other social contact or interactions with each other.Study: Want to Make a Friend for Life? Play an MMORPG, James Brightman, August 15, 2007 As a result, their conversations contain a subtext of discovery of language skills, social values, and intentions. One of the first indicators of these is the use or offense taken by the usage of smack talk. For the purpose of setting a social context or to comply with MMOG end user license agreement restrictions, MMOG groups may establish bylaws, traditions, or rules (formal or informal) that either permit, discourage, or prohibit the use of smack talk in their conversations and postings. == Morality == The ethics of using trash-talk as a strategy is debated. In sports, trash talking is often seen as unsportsmanlike, as throwing insults at opposing players goes beyond the limits and conventions of the game. Some argue, on the other hand, that trash talking can be used as a valid strategy to increase tension in opponents and thus benefit from opponents' poor performance, since any action not explicitly banned in the rules is permitted. ==See also== * The dozens * Fighting words * Flaming (Internet) * Flyting * Hip hop music * Profanity * Sledging (cricket) * Talking shit * Wolf-whistling ==References== Category:Humour Category:Pejoratives Category:Sports culture ","title":"Trash-talk"},{"id":"3232391","text":"Fortescue may refer to: ==People== * Fortescue (surname), a British surname Includes list of name-holders * Fortescue Ash (1882‚Äì1956), Anglican bishop in Australia * Fortescue Graham (1794‚Äì1880), British Royal Marines general ==Places== * Fortescue, Missouri, United States, a village * Fortescue, New Jersey, United States * County of Fortescue, Queensland, Australia * Fortescue Bay, Tasmania, Australia * Fortescue River, Western Australia ==Titles== * Earl Fortescue, a title in the Peerage of Great Britain * Fortescue baronets * Baron Fortescue of Credan, an extinct title in the Peerage of Ireland ==Other uses== * Fortescue Metals Group, an Australian iron ore company * Fortescue National Football League, an Australian rules football league * Fortescue grunter (Leiopotherapon aheneus), a freshwater fish * Fortescue transformation for symmetrical components * Fortescue, protagonist of The House of Fortescue, a 1916 silent film ","title":"Fortescue"},{"id":"3232400","text":"‚ÄúEvery Sperm Is Sacred‚Äù performed at the Python reunion, Monty Python Live (Mostly) in 2014 \\"Every Sperm Is Sacred\\" is a musical sketch from the film Monty Python's The Meaning of Life. A satire of Catholic teachings on reproduction that forbid masturbation and contraception, the song was released on the album Monty Python Sings and was nominated for a BAFTA Music Award for Best Original Song in a Film in 1983. Andr√© Jacquemin and David Howman wrote the music and Michael Palin and Terry Jones wrote the lyrics and performed the song, which is hailed as one of the Pythons' great sketches. Viewing Python as the ‚Äúgreat originator‚Äù of combining provocative humour and high-quality original music, Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane regarded the song as his favourite Python number, stating, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs so beautifully written, it‚Äôs musically and lyrically legit, the orchestrations are fantastic, the choreography and the presentation are very, very complex ‚Äì it‚Äôs treated seriously.‚Äù ==Content and production== The song is a satire of Catholic teachings on reproduction that forbid masturbation and contraception by artificial means. The sketch, called \\"The Third World\\", is about a Catholic Yorkshire worker played by Michael Palin, with his wife played by director Terry Jones. They have sixty- three children, who are about to be sold for scientific experimentation purposes because their parents can no longer afford to care for such a large family with the local mill being closed. When their children ask why they should not use any form of birth control, or why the father cannot perform self-castration, their father explains that this is against God's wishes, and breaks into song, the chorus of which is: The stern Protestant couple (Palin and Jones at the 2014 Python reunion) comment disapprovingly on the Catholic Church forbidding contraception while the Catholic couple next door (and their 63 children) sing ‚ÄúEvery Sperm is Sacred‚Äù The production in The Meaning of Life was filmed in Colne, Lancashire, and Burnley, Lancashire, and choreographed by Arlene Phillips to a storyboard by Jones. The hearty and cheerful nature of the musical number is counterpointed as the children are marched off to their fate as the song ends, singing a dour rendition of the chorus as their middle-aged Protestant neighbours (played by Graham Chapman and Eric Idle) comment on the teachings of the Catholic Church. They add that they have two children, which is the exact number of times they have had sex in their marriage. The grounds of Cartwright Hall art gallery in Bradford, West Yorkshire, was used as a location for the singing and dancing nurses. The song is a style pastiche of the song \\"Consider Yourself\\", from the musical Oliver! by Lionel Bart. Later, Jones denied that it was explicitly written to make fun of the genre of musical comedy: Every Sperm is Sacred' is not a parody of these things, it just is those things, it's a musical song, it's a hymn, it's a Lionel Bart-style musical, but it's not making fun of a Lionel Bart-style musical.\\" The song was performed at Monty Python Live (Mostly), with Idle singing Palin's part. It also has the Protestant married couple with Palin playing the Protestant husband. ==Influence== ===Sexuality and reproduction=== The phrase \\"every sperm is sacred\\" has become almost proverbial in the field of animal and human sexuality and reproduction. This extends to such areas as cloning, where the song is used to criticize anti- cloning activists who argue that every embryo or fertilized egg is sacred. P. 82. Abortion-rights activists have sung the song outside abortion clinics to ridicule their opponents, legal scholars have alluded to it in discussions of women's reproductive rights, and it is used generally to do what has been described as \\"[exposing] the absurdity of the anti-choice argument when taken to its extreme\\". ===Religion=== The religious import of the sketch is significant, and is reflected in the widely dispersed usage of the phrase. In the book Monty Python and Philosophy, the argument is teased out to reach a broader (still humorous) conclusion: \\"The Pythons ask us to consider the consequences of the belief that God cares about our reproductive practices and sees everything. If so, then he watches our sexual activities. ...Christians must concede that all things considered, this [watching people have sex] is one of God's less onerous activities.\\" Philip Jenkins discusses the sketch as an important sign of a growing willingness in the popular media of the 1970s and 1980s to criticize the Catholic Church, saying that \\"Catholic attitudes toward sex and contraception are ruthlessly parodied\\" in the song, proving that \\"Catholicism was available as a legitimate subject of serious fiction.\\" Richard Dawkins, in his The God Delusion, cites the song for that reason, the illustration of the \\"surreal idiocy\\" of some pro-religion, anti-abortion arguments. ===Masturbation=== It is sometimes difficult to separate the comic from the serious application of the phrase, and two recent publications on the penis use it for precisely that purpose, Talking Cock, by Richard Herring, and Dick: A User's Guide. In both cases, the sketch is used to ridicule those who condemn masturbation, and sex for any purpose other than procreation. ==Reverse censorship== According to the interview with Palin on the DVD extras, he said \\"at the end of my sock\\" in the original scene, with the word \\"cock\\" being overdubbed later. This was done because the scene featured numerous underage children and the Pythons were already concerned they were \\"pushing the limit\\". By modern-day child safety standards, Monty Python's skit involving children would constitute a clear breach in ethical standards. Years later, several of the child actors stated they had no idea what they were singing about. ==See also== * Humor about Catholicism ==References== ==External links== * Every Sperm is Sacred - Monty Python's The Meaning of Life - Official Monty Python channel on YouTube.

It has many applications, notably in construction equipment (engineering vehicles), manufacturing machinery, and civil engineering. == Operation == Hydraulic cylinders get their power from pressurized hydraulic fluid, which is typically oil. The hydraulic cylinder consists of a cylinder barrel, in which a piston connected to a piston rod moves back and forth. The barrel is closed on one end by the cylinder bottom (also called the cap) and the other end by the cylinder head (also called the gland) where the piston rod comes out of the cylinder. The piston has sliding rings and seals. The piston divides the inside of the cylinder into two chambers, the bottom chamber (cap end) and the piston rod side chamber (rod end / head end). Flanges, trunnions, clevises, and lugs are common cylinder mounting options. The piston rod also has mounting attachments to connect the cylinder to the object or machine component that it is pushing or pulling. A hydraulic cylinder is the actuator or \\"motor\\" side of this system. The \\"generator\\" side of the hydraulic system is the hydraulic pump which delivers a fixed or regulated flow of oil to the hydraulic cylinder, to move the piston. The piston pushes the oil in the other chamber back to the reservoir. If we assume that the oil enters from cap end, during extension stroke, and the oil pressure in the rod end / head end is approximately zero, the force F on the piston rod equals the pressure P in the cylinder times the piston area A: :F = P \\\\cdot A === Retraction force difference === For double-acting single-rod cylinders, when the input and output pressures are reversed, there is a force difference between the two sides of the piston due to one side of the piston being covered by the rod attached to it. The cylinder rod reduces the surface area of the piston and reduces the force that can be applied for the retraction stroke.Management of Hazardous Energy: Deactivation, De-Energization, Isolation, and Lockout, Thomas Neil McManus, page 678, August 8, 2012 by CRC Press, Reference - 942 Pages - 273 B/W Illustrations, During the retraction stroke, if oil is pumped into the head (or gland) at the rod end and the oil from the cap end flows back to the reservoir without pressure, the fluid pressure in the rod end is (Pull Force) / (piston area - piston rod area): :P = \\\\frac{F_p}{A_p - A_r} where P is the fluid pressure, Fp is the pulling force, Ap is the piston face area and Ar is the rod cross-section area. For double-acting, double-rod cylinders, when the piston surface area is equally covered by a rod of equal size on both sides of the head, there is no force difference. Such cylinders typically have their cylinder body affixed to a stationary mount. == Applications == Hydraulic cylinders are used in earth-moving equipment to lift or lower the boom, arm, or bucket. These cylinders are also used in hydraulic bending machine, metal sheet sheering machine, particle board or plywood making hot press. == Parts == A hydraulic cylinder has the following parts: === Cylinder barrel === The main function of the cylinder body is to contain cylinder pressure. The cylinder barrel is mostly made from honed tubes.\\"HONED TUBES  SRB TUBES  HYDRAULIC CYLINDER TUBES\\", YOUNGLEE METAL, Sep 16, 2018. Honed tubes are produced from Suitable To Hone Steel Cold Drawn Seamless Tubes (CDS tubes) or Drawn Over Mandrel (DOM) tubes. Honed tubing is ready to use for hydraulic cylinders without further ID processing. The surface finish of the cylinder barrel is typically 4 to 16 microinch. Honing process and Skiving & Roller burnishing (SRB) process are the two main types of processes for manufacturing cylinder tube.\\"Honing and Skiving&Burnishing; Process for Manufacturing Cylinder Tubes\\", SKYLINE PIPES, Sep 6, 2018. The piston reciprocates in the cylinder.The cylinder barrel has features of smooth inside surface,high precision tolerance, durable in use etc. === Cylinder base or cap === The main function of the cap is to enclose the pressure chamber at one end. The cap is connected to the body by means of welding, threading, bolts, or tie rod. Caps also perform as cylinder mounting components [cap flange, cap trunnion, cap clevis]. Cap size is determined based on the bending stress. A static seal / o-ring is used in between cap and barrel (except welded construction). === Cylinder head === The main function of the head is to enclose the pressure chamber from the other end. The head contains an integrated rod sealing arrangement or the option to accept a seal gland. The head is connected to the body by means of threading, bolts, or tie rod. A static seal / o-ring is used in between head and barrel. === Piston === The main function of the piston is to separate the pressure zones inside the barrel. The piston is machined with grooves to fit elastomeric or metal seals and bearing elements. These seals can be single acting or double acting. The difference in pressure between the two sides of the piston causes the cylinder to extend and retract. The piston is attached with the piston rod by means of threads, bolts, or nuts to transfer the linear motion. === Piston rod === The piston rod is typically a hard chrome-plated piece of cold-rolled steel which attaches to the piston and extends from the cylinder through the rod-end head. In double rod-end cylinders, the actuator has a rod extending from both sides of the piston and out both ends of the barrel. The piston rod connects the hydraulic actuator to the machine component doing the work. This connection can be in the form of a machine thread or a mounting attachment. The piston rod is highly ground and polished so as to provide a reliable seal and prevent leakage. === Seal gland === The cylinder head is fitted with seals to prevent the pressurized oil from leaking past the interface between the rod and the head. This area is called the seal gland. The advantage of a seal gland is easy removal and seal replacement. The seal gland contains a primary seal, a secondary seal / buffer seal, bearing elements, wiper / scraper and static seal. In some cases, especially in small hydraulic cylinders, the rod gland and the bearing elements are made from a single integral machined part. === Seals === The seals are considered / designed as per the cylinder working pressure, cylinder speed, operating temperature, working medium and application. Piston seals are dynamic seals, and they can be single acting or double acting. Generally speaking, Elastomer seals made from nitrile rubber, Polyurethane or other materials are best in lower temperature environments, while seals made of Fluorocarbon Viton are better for higher temperatures. Metallic seals are also available and commonly use cast iron for the seal material. Rod seals are dynamic seals and generally are single acting. The compounds of rod seals are nitrile rubber, Polyurethane, or Fluorocarbon Viton. Wipers / scrapers are used to eliminate contaminants such as moisture, dirt, and dust, which can cause extensive damage to cylinder walls, rods, seals and other components. The common compound for wipers is polyurethane. Metallic scrapers are used for sub zero temperature applications, and applications where foreign materials can deposit on the rod. The bearing elements / wear bands are used to eliminate metal to metal contact. The wear bands are designed as per the side load requirements. The primary compounds used for wear bands are filled PTFE, woven fabric reinforced polyester resin and bronze === Other parts === There are many component parts that make up the internal portion of a hydraulic cylinder. All of these pieces combine to create a fully functioning component.Component Parts of a Hydraulic Cylinder  http://www.crconline.com/component-parts.html * Cylinder base connection * Cushions * Internal Threaded Ductile Heads * Head Glands * Polypak Pistons * Cylinder Head Caps * Butt Plates * Eye Brackets/Clevis Brackets * MP Detachable Mounts * Rod Eyes/Rod Clevis * Pivot Pins * Spherical Ball Bushings * Spherical Rod Eye * Alignment Coupler * Ports and Fittings === Single acting vs. double acting === * Single acting cylinders are economical and the simplest design. Hydraulic fluid enters through a port at one end of the cylinder, which extends the rod by means of area difference. An external force, internal retraction spring or gravity returns the piston rod. * Double acting cylinders have a port at each end or side of the piston, supplied with hydraulic fluid for both the retraction and extension.\\"Hydraulic Cylinders \\", Metro Hydraulic, Retrieved June 6, 2016. == Designs == There are primarily two main styles of hydraulic cylinder construction used in industry: tie rod style cylinders and welded body style cylinders. === Tie rod cylinder === A tie rod cylinder Tie rod style hydraulic cylinders use high strength threaded steel rods to hold the two end caps to the cylinder barrel. They are most often seen in industrial factory applications. Small bore cylinders usually have 4 tie rods, and large bore cylinders may require as many as 16 or 20 tie rods in order to retain the end caps under the tremendous forces produced. Tie rod style cylinders can be completely disassembled for service and repair, and they are not always customizable.\\"Welded Cylinders vs. Tie Rod Cylinders \\", Best Metal Products, Retrieved June 6, 2016. The National Fluid Power Association (NFPA) has standardized the dimensions of hydraulic tie rod cylinders. This enables cylinders from different manufacturers to interchange within the same mountings. === Welded body cylinder === Welded body cylinders have no tie rods. The barrel is welded directly to the end caps. The ports are welded to the barrel. The front rod gland is usually threaded into or bolted to the cylinder barrel. That allows the piston rod assembly and the rod seals to be removed for service. A Cut Away of a Welded Body Hydraulic Cylinder showing the internal components Welded body cylinders have a number of advantages over tie rod style cylinders. Welded cylinders have a narrower body and often a shorter overall length enabling them to fit better into the tight confines of machinery. Welded cylinders do not suffer from failure due to tie rod stretch at high pressures and long strokes. The welded design also lends itself to customization. Special features are easily added to the cylinder body, including special ports, custom mounts, valve manifolds, and so on. The smooth outer body of welded cylinders also enables the design of multi-stage telescopic cylinders. Welded body hydraulic cylinders dominate the mobile hydraulic equipment market such as construction equipment (excavators, bulldozers, and road graders) and material handling equipment (forklift trucks, telehandlers, and lift-gates). They are also used by heavy industry in cranes, oil rigs, and large off-road vehicles for above-ground mining operations. == Piston rod construction == The piston rod of a hydraulic cylinder operates both inside and outside the barrel, and consequently both in and out of the hydraulic fluid and surrounding atmosphere. === Coatings === Wear and corrosion resistant surfaces are desirable on the outer diameter of the piston rod. The surfaces are often applied using coating techniques such as Chrome (Nickel) Plating, Lunac 2+ duplex, Laser Cladding, PTA welding and Thermal Spraying. These coatings can be finished to the desirable surface roughness (Ra, Rz) where the seals give optimum performance. All these coating methods have their specific advantages and disadvantages. It is for this reason that coating experts play a crucial role in selecting the optimum surface treatment procedure for protecting Hydraulic Cylinders. Cylinders are used in different operational conditions and that makes it a challenge to find the right coating solution. In dredging there might be impact from stones or other parts, in salt water environments there are extreme corrosion attacks, in off-shore cylinders facing bending and impact in combination with salt water, and in the steel industry there are high temperatures involved, etc. There is no single coating solution which successfully combats all the specific operational wear conditions. Every technique has its own benefits and disadvantages. === Length === Piston rods are generally available in lengths which are cut to suit the application. As the common rods have a soft or mild steel core, their ends can be welded or machined for a screw thread. == Distribution of forces on components == The forces on the piston face and the piston head retainer vary depending on which piston head retention system is used. If a circlip (or any non preloaded system) is used, the force acting to separate the piston head and the cylinder shaft shoulder is the applied pressure multiplied by the area of the piston head. The piston head and shaft shoulder will separate and the load is fully reacted by the piston head retainer. If a preloaded system is used the force between the cylinder shaft and piston head is initially the piston head retainer preload value. Once pressure is applied this force will reduce. The piston head and cylinder shaft shoulder will remain in contact unless the applied pressure multiplied by piston head area exceeds the preload. The maximum force the piston head retainer will see is the larger of the preload and the applied pressure multiplied by the full piston head area. The load on the piston head retainer is greater than the external load, which is due to the reduced shaft size passing through the piston head. Increasing this portion of shaft reduces the load on the retainer. === Side loading === Side loading is unequal pressure that is not centered on the cylinder rod. This off-center strain can lead to bending of the rod in extreme cases, but more commonly causes leaking due to warping the circular seals into an oval shape. It can also damage and enlarge the bore hole around the rod and the inner cylinder wall around the piston head, if the rod is pressed hard enough sideways to fully compress and deform the seals to make metal-on-metal scraping contact.Maximizing Cylinder Performance: A checklist of design guidelines ensures the best pneumatic cylinder for an application, Aug 20, 1998, Kenneth Korane, Machine Design magazine The strain of side loading can be directly reduced with the use of internal stop tubes which reduce the maximum extension length, leaving some distance between the piston and bore seal, and increasing leverage to resist warping of the seals. Double pistons also spread out the forces of side loading while also reducing stroke length. Alternately, external sliding guides and hinges can support the load and reduce side loading forces applied directly on the cylinder.Fluid Power Design Handbook, Third Edition, page 112, By Frank Yeaple, CRC Press, 1995, 854 pages, == Cylinder mounting methods == Mounting methods also play an important role in cylinder performance. Generally, fixed mounts on the centerline of the cylinder are best for straight line force transfer and avoiding wear. Common types of mounting include: Flange mounts‚ÄîVery strong and rigid, but have little tolerance for misalignment. Experts recommend cap end mounts for thrust loads and rod end mounts where major loading puts the piston rod in tension. Three types are head rectangular flange, head square flange or rectangular head. Flange mounts function optimally when the mounting face attaches to a machine support member.\\"Mounting Style Can Dramatically Improve Hydraulic and Pneumatic Cylinder Performance\\", Hydraulics & Pneumatics, Retrieved June 6, 2016 Side- mounted cylinders‚ÄîEasy to install and service, but the mounts produce a turning moment as the cylinder applies force to a load, increasing wear and tear. To avoid this, specify a stroke at least as long as the bore size for side mount cylinders (heavy loading tends to make short stroke, large bore cylinders unstable). Side mounts need to be well aligned and the load supported and guided. Centerline lug mounts ‚ÄîAbsorb forces on the centerline, and require dowel pins to secure the lugs to prevent movement at higher pressures or under shock conditions. Dowel pins hold it to the machine when operating at high pressure or under shock loading. Pivot mounts ‚ÄîAbsorb force on the cylinder centerline and let the cylinder change alignment in one plane. Common types include clevises, trunnion mounts and spherical bearings. Because these mounts allow a cylinder to pivot, they should be used with rod-end attachments that also pivot. Clevis mounts can be used in any orientation and are generally recommended for short strokes and small- to medium-bore cylinders. == Special hydraulic cylinders == === Telescopic cylinder === Telescopic cylinder (ISO 1219 symbol) The length of a hydraulic cylinder is the total of the stroke, the thickness of the piston, the thickness of bottom and head and the length of the connections. Often this length does not fit in the machine. In that case the piston rod is also used as a piston barrel and a second piston rod is used. These kinds of cylinders are called telescopic cylinders. If we call a normal rod cylinder single stage, telescopic cylinders are multi-stage units of two, three, four, five or more stages. In general telescopic cylinders are much more expensive than normal cylinders. Most telescopic cylinders are single acting (push). Double acting telescopic cylinders must be specially designed and manufactured.\\"What are Telescopic Cylinders, and How Do They Work?\\", Pneu-Hyd, Retrieved June 6, 2016. === Plunger cylinder === A hydraulic cylinder without a piston or with a piston without seals is called a plunger cylinder. A plunger cylinder can only be used as a pushing cylinder; the maximum force is piston rod area multiplied by pressure. This means that a plunger cylinder in general has a relatively thick piston rod. ===Differential cylinder=== Differential cylinder (ISO 1219 symbol) A differential cylinder acts like a normal cylinder when pulling. If the cylinder however has to push, the oil from the piston rod side of the cylinder is not returned to the reservoir, but goes to the bottom side of the cylinder. In such a way, the cylinder goes much faster, but the maximum force the cylinder can give is like a plunger cylinder. A differential cylinder can be manufactured like a normal cylinder, and only a special control is added. The above differential cylinder is also called a regenerative cylinder control circuit. This term means that the cylinder is a single rod, double acting hydraulic cylinder. The control circuit includes a valve and piping which during the extension of the piston, conducts the oil from the rod side of the piston to the other side of the piston instead of to the pump‚Äôs reservoir. The oil which is conducted to the other side of the piston is referred to as the regenerative oil. === Position sensing \\"smart\\" hydraulic cylinder === Position sensing hydraulic cylinders eliminate the need for a hollow cylinder rod. Instead, an external sensing \\"bar\\" using Hall Effect technology senses the position of the cylinder‚Äôs piston. This is accomplished by the placement of a permanent magnet within the piston. The magnet propagates a magnetic field through the steel wall of the cylinder, providing a locating signal to the sensor. == Terminology == In the United States, popular usage refers to the whole assembly of cylinder, piston, and piston rod (or more) collectively as a \\"piston\\", which is incorrect. Instead, the piston is the short, cylindrical metal component that separates the two parts of the cylinder barrel internally. == References == Cylinder Cylinder, Hydraulic Category:Actuators Cylinder ","title":"Hydraulic cylinder"},{"id":"3232423","text":"Corpus Christi Records is a British independent record label started by some of the members of Crass and their recording engineer and business partner John Loder, to release records by artists who did not perhaps fit in with some of the stricter ideals of the Crass Records label. Several of the artists on the label had debuted with 7-inch single/EP releases on Crass Records, but Corpus Christi was used for future releases.

Some of the artists on the label, however, such as UK Decay, Icons of Filth, and the American band Crucifix were signed by Loder without any prior involvement with Crass. The label was active between 1982 and 1987, and its releases were regularly placed highly in the UK Indie Chart, with Conflict's It's Time to See Who's Who LP topping the indie album chart in 1983.

It is often simply referred to as the memorandum. In the UK, it has to be filed with the Registrar of Companies during the process of incorporating a company. It is the document that regulates the company's external affairs, and complements the articles of association which cover the company's internal constitution. It contains the fundamental conditions under which the company is allowed to operate. Until recently it had to include the \\"objects clause\\" which let the shareholders, creditors and those dealing with the company know what is its permitted range of operation, although this was usually drafted very broadly. It also shows the company's initial capital. It is one of the documents required to incorporate a company in India, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Canada, Nigeria, Nepal, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Sri Lanka, and Tanzania and is also used in many of the common law jurisdictions of the Commonwealth.http://www.mca.gov.in/SearchableActs/Schedule1.htm ==Requirements: United Kingdom== It is still a requirement to file a memorandum of association to incorporate a new company, but it contains less information than was required before 1 October 2010. The Companies (Registration) Regulation 2008 included pro-forma Memoranda. It is basically a statement that the subscribers wish to form a company under the Companies Act 2006, have agreed to become members and, in the case of a company that is to have a share capital, to take at least one share each. It is no longer required to state the name of the company, the type of company (such as public limited company or private company limited by shares), the location of its registered office, the objects of the company, and its authorised share capital. Instead, these details appear solely in the Articles of Association. Companies incorporated prior to 1 October 2009 are not required to amend their memoranda, and for these companies the provisions which would have appeared in the memorandum but are now required to appear in the Articles, such as the objects clause and details of the share capital, are deemed to form a part of the latter. ==Capacities== The memorandum no longer restricts the activities of a company. Since 1 October 2009, if a company's constitution contains any restrictions on the objects at all, those restrictions will form part of the articles of association. Historically, a company's memorandum of association contained an objects clause, which limited its capacity to act. When the first limited companies were incorporated, the objects clause had to be widely drafted so as not to restrict the board of directors in their day to day trading.

The line connected Pocomoke City, Maryland, to Norfolk, Virginia, interchanging with the Norfolk Southern Railway at both ends. Delmarva had been previously served by the New York, Philadelphia and Norfolk Company (N.Y.P.& N.) led by William Lawrence Scott which ran south down the peninsula to a freight depot, terminal and harbor at the headland point at Cape Charles, Virginia, a town which it founded and laid out in 1883‚Äì1884. A ferry barge system then operated crossing the lower Chesapeake Bay to the Norfolk piers. The NYP&N; was later absorbed by the Pennsylvania Railroad which dominated the eastern U.S.A. along with the New York Central Railroad and the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad in the first half of the 20th century. A rail ferry service was used to span the 26 mile water route across the Chesapeake Bay between Cape Charles, Virginia and Norfolk. Tug boats were contracted to move the two barges (car floats) of 25 and 15 car capacity. This particular car float operation has been in continuous service since April 1885, and is one of only two remaining in the United States (the other being New York New Jersey Rail, LLC). The Eastern Shore Railroad was taken over in February 2006 by Cassatt Management, LLC., and was operated and renamed as the Bay Coast Railroad.

Protz, Classic Stout & Porter, London: Prion, 1997, p. 61 Beamish and Crawford operated until 2009 and had a number of owners, including Carling O'Keefe, Elders IXL, Scottish & Newcastle and, most recently, Heineken International. While the Beamish and Crawford brewery closed in 2009, Beamish stout is still brewed in the city, at a nearby Heineken operated facility. ==History== The Counting House, part of the brewery complex in central Cork, Ireland The Beamish and Crawford brewery was founded in 1792, when two merchants, William Beamish and William Crawford, went into partnership with two brewers, Richard Barrett and Digby O‚ÄôBrien. They purchased an existing brewery (from Edward Allen) on a site in Cramer's Lane that had been used for brewing since at least 1650 (and possibly as early as 1500). Beamish and Crawford's Cork Porter Brewery prospered, and by 1805 it had become the largest brewery in Ireland and the third largest in the then United Kingdom as a whole. In 1805, its output was 100,000 barrels per annum ‚Äì up from 12,000 barrels in 1792. It remained the largest brewery in Ireland until overtaken by Guinness in 1833. Beamish Stout, 1919 advert for the noted Cork brewers In 1865, the brewery underwent a modernisation programme and was completely revamped at a cost of ¬£100,000. Alfred Barnard, a noted brewing and distilling historian, remarked in his book Noted Breweries of Great Britain & Ireland in 1889 that: :\\"The business of Beamish & Crawford in Cork is a very old one dating as far back as the seventeenth century and it is said to be the most ancient porter brewery in Ireland.\\" The company went public in 1901, issuing a share capital of ¬£480,000. Further expansion was aided by the acquisition of a number of local breweries in the early 1900s. In 1962, it was purchased by the Canadian brewing firm Carling-O'Keefe Ltd, who embarked on a modernisation programme at the brewery. In 1987, Elders IXL purchased Canadian Breweries (incorporating Carling-O'Keefe). In 1995, Elders sold the brewery to Scottish & Newcastle. With the 2008 takeover of Scottish & Newcastle, the brewery passed into the hands of its main Cork-based rival Heineken International. In December 2008, it was announced that the Beamish and Crawford brewery was to close in March 2009 with the loss of 120 jobs. Production was moved to the nearby Heineken Brewery (previously Murphy's), with about forty of the Beamish staff moved to Heineken. The brewery buildings (including the Tudor fronted \\"counting house\\") are still in the heart of Cork's medieval city, close to the South Gate. The original brewery facilities are subject to planning permission for use as a visitor and events centre. ==Products== Before the takeover and closure of the brewery, beers included: * Beamish stout, Beamish and Crawford's flagship product, now brewed by Heineken at the Murphy's brewery. * Beamish Red, a sweetish Irish red ale, made to resemble Kilkenny or Murphy's Irish Red. Production ceased immediately following the takeover. Several Cork pubs which once stocked Beamish Red replaced it with Franciscan Well Rebel Red. In addition to their own beers, Beamish and Crawford brewed and distributed a number of internationally known brands of beer, with the Irish franchises for Fosters, Kronenbourg 1664 and Miller. Fosters has remained with the new owners, while Miller was transferred to a new distributor, importing the beer from SABMiller's Netherlands brewery. In 2009, after just over two years of being reintroduced to the US market, owners Heineken decided to stop distribution of Beamish products outside Ireland. == References == Category:Beer in Ireland Category:1792 establishments in Ireland Category:Heineken brands ","title":"Beamish and Crawford"},{"id":"3232437","text":"ƒåerigaj is a village in West Herzegovina near ≈†iroki Brijeg with a population of about 300. ==External links== * Pictures of Cerigaj Category:Populated places in ≈†iroki Brijeg ","title":"ƒåerigaj"},{"id":"3232438","text":"The Candidate is a 1972 American political comedy-drama film starring Robert Redford and Peter Boyle, and directed by Michael Ritchie. The Academy Award‚Äìwinning screenplay, which examines the various facets and machinations involved in political campaigns, was written by Jeremy Larner, a speechwriter for Senator Eugene J. McCarthy during McCarthy's campaign for the 1968 Democratic presidential nomination. ==Plot== Marvin Lucas (Peter Boyle), a political election specialist, must find a Democratic candidate to oppose California Senator Crocker Jarmon (Don Porter), a popular Republican. With no big-name Democrat eager to enter the unwinnable race, Lucas seeks out Bill McKay (Robert Redford), the idealistic, handsome, and charismatic son of former California governor John J. McKay (Melvyn Douglas). Lucas gives McKay a proposition: since Jarmon cannot lose and the race is already decided, McKay is free to campaign saying exactly what he wants. McKay accepts in order to have the chance to spread his values, and hits the trail. With no serious Democratic opposition, McKay cruises to the nomination on his name alone. Lucas then has distressing news: according to the latest election projections, McKay will be defeated by an overwhelming margin. Lucas says the party expected McKay to lose but not to be humiliated, so he moderates his message to appeal to a broader range of voters. McKay campaigns across the state, his message growing more generic each day. This approach lifts him in the opinion polls, but he has a new problem: because McKay's father has stayed out of the race, the media interpret his silence as an endorsement of Jarmon. McKay grudgingly meets his father and tells him the problem, and the elder McKay tells the media he is simply honoring his son's wishes to stay out of the race. With McKay only nine points down in the polls, Jarmon proposes a debate. McKay agrees to give answers tailored by Lucas, but just as the debate is ending, McKay has a pang of conscience and blurts out that the debate has not addressed real issues such as poverty and race relations. Lucas is furious, as this will hurt the campaign. The media try to confront McKay backstage, but arrive as his father congratulates him on the debate; instead of reporting on McKay's outburst, the story becomes the reemergence of the former governor to help his son. The positive story, coupled with McKay's father's help on the trail, further closes the polling gap. With the election a few days away, Lucas and McKay's father set up a meet-and-greet with a labor union representative to discuss another possible endorsement. During the meeting, the union representative tells McKay that he feels that they can do a lot of good for each other if they work together. McKay ostensibly tells him that he is not interested in associating with him, but the tension is quelled with uncomfortable yet unanimous laughter. After a publicized endorsement with the union rep, and with Californian workers now behind him, McKay pulls into a virtual tie. McKay wins the election. In the final scene, he escapes the victory party and pulls Lucas into a room while throngs of journalists clamor outside. McKay asks Lucas, \\"What do we do now?\\" The media throng arrives to drag them out, and McKay never receives an answer. ==Cast== ==Production== The character of McKay is based on US Senator John V. Tunney. Director Michael Ritchie worked for Tunney's campaign in the 1970 Senate election.Kelley, Beverly Merrill (2012). Reelpolitik Ideologies in American Political Film. Lexington Books. Page 23 In the campaign, Tunney's media adviser had \\"bulls- eyed the young/old contrast\\" between Tunney and incumbent opponent George Murphy. Ritchie, Redford and writer Jeremy Larner spent the whole summer of 1971 putting together the script. The scene where McKay is berated in a men's room is based on an incident that happened to presidential candidate Eugene McCarthy. In the original script, there was a dialogue planned for McKay's mistress, however was cut by Redford's request.

In April 1887 Colonel Edward Robert King-Harman was appointed Parliamentary Under-Secretary to the Lord Lieutenant, but he died on 10 June 1888 and no further appointments were made.Haydn's Book of Dignities, third edition (1894) p. 564. ==Under- Secretaries for Ireland== * Thomas Waite 1747‚Äì1774 * Sackville Hamilton 1780‚Äì1795 * Lodge Morres 1795 * Sackville Hamilton 1795‚Äì1796 * Edward Cooke 1796-1801 * Alexander Marsden 1801-1806 * James Traill 1806-1808 * Sir Charles Saxton 1808-1812 * William Gregory 1812-1831 * Sir William Gossett 1831-1835 *Thomas Drummond 1835‚Äì1840Famous scots, Retrieved 9 January 2009 *Norman Hilton Macdonald 1840‚Äì1841 *Edward Lucas 1841‚Äì1845 *Richard Pennefather 1845‚Äì1846 *Sir Thomas Nicholas Redington 1846‚Äì1852 *John Arthur Wynne 1852‚Äì1853 *Sir Thomas Aiskew Larcom 1853‚Äì1868 *Sir Edward Robert Wetherall 1868‚Äì1869 *Thomas Henry Burke 1869‚Äì1882 *Sir Robert George Crookshank Hamilton 1882‚Äì1886 *Sir Redvers Henry Buller 1886‚Äì1887 *Sir Joseph West Ridgeway 1887‚Äì1893 *Sir David Harrel 1893‚Äì1902 *Sir Antony MacDonnell 1902‚Äì1908 *Sir James Brown Dougherty 1908‚Äì1914 *Sir Matthew Nathan 1914‚Äì1916 *Sir Robert Chalmers 1916 *Sir William Byrne 1916‚Äì1918 *James Macmahon 1918‚Äì1922 (jointly with Sir John Anderson from 1920) *Sir John Anderson 1920‚Äì1922 (jointly with James Macmahon) ==Assistant Under-Secretaries for Ireland (1895 onwards)== *Sir James Brown Dougherty 1895‚Äì1908 *Sir Alfred Cope 1920‚Äì1922 *Sir Mark Beresford Russell Grant-Sturgis 1920‚Äì1922 ==References== * Chris Cook and Brendan Keith, British Historical Facts 1830‚Äì1900 (Macmillan, 1975) p. 149.

The terms were used to describe unacceptable methods of influencing the market, sometimes by creating a local monopoly for a certain good, usually food. The terms were often used together, and with overlapping meanings. They became obsolete in 1844. Blackstone's Commentaries described them as offences against public trade: forestalling--the buying or contracting for any merchandise or victual coming in the way of the market; or dissuading persons from bringing their goods or provisions there; or persuading them to enhance the price, when there; any of which practices make the market dearer to the fair trader. regrating--the buying of corn or other dead victual, in any market, and selling it again at the same market, or within four miles of the place. For this also enhances the prices of the provisions, as every successive seller must have a successive profit. engrossing--the getting into one's possession, or buying up, large quantities of corn, or other dead victuals, with intent to sell them again. This must of course be injurious to the public, by putting it in the power of one or two rich men to raise the price of provisions at their own discretion. Blackstone described a monopoly as \\"the same offence in other branches of trade\\", i.e., not food. ==Forestalling== \\"Shaving a Forestaller\\", 1800 etching. The barber says \\"I must really be obliged to charge gentlemen of your profession an extra price for shaving ‚Äî your faces being three times as long as they were before the harvest!\\" Blackstone says that this was a common law offence. The derivation does not come from setting up a stall in front of another but buying before the goods got to a stall in open market. Typically, forestalling referred to the practice of intercepting sellers on their way to a market, buying up their stock, then taking it to the market and marking it up, which is a type of arbitrage. It could also mean the creation of partnerships or agreements under which goods would not be brought to market. Forestalling is often used and understood as a catch-all clause for marketing offences. The Domesday Book recorded that \\"foresteel\\" (i.e. forestalling, the practice of buying up goods before they reach market and then inflating the prices) was one of three forfeitures that King Edward the Confessor could carry out through England.Pollock and Maitland, History of English Law Vol. II, 453 As early as 1321 the practice of forestalling was recognized as a specific offence and was regulated in London in the early twelfth century, and in other cities and towns, including goods coming by land or sea. However, originally the word itself was not used. In the laws of Henry I of England forestalling was the crime of assault on the highway, an offence against the King's Peace. It acquired the meaning of the marketing offence through the distribution of the regulations of the Marshalsea whose officers were empowered by Edward I of England to regulate trade in the shires. In time these regulations became known as the Statute of Forestallers, though probably never passed by any formal process. The laws provided for heavy penalties against forestalling. In practice the normal penalty was a fine, or, for repeated cases, exposure in the pillory. ==The Act against Regrators, Forestallers and Ingrossers== In 1552 Edward VI's Parliament passed an Act to regulate trade, saying in the preamble, as so often, that previous laws had proved inadequate (5&6 Edward VI c. 12)iii. The Act excluded from the penalties it imposed the purchase and sale \\"in open Fair or Market\\" of \\"corn, Fish, Butter or Cheese, by any such badger, Lader, Kidder, or Carrier\\" as was granted a licence by three Justices of the Peace from the County in which he dwelt. ==The Act touching Badgers of Corn and Drovers of Cattle, to be licensed== Like its precursors this Act was perceived to be inadequate, so in 1562 the Parliament of Elizabeth I passed a further Act, tightening the regulation of badgers and drovers (5 Elizabeth I, c. 12 iv). The Act recited that \\"such a great Number of Persons seeking only to live easily, and to leave their honest Labour, have and do daily seek to be allowed and licensed . . . being most unfit and unmet for those Purposes . . . diminishing the Number of good and necessary Husbandmen\\". Under this Act a licence could only be granted under strict conditions. Badgers had to be male, resident in the shire for 3 years, householders, (have been) married, and 30 years of age, or more. Household servants or Retainers could not apply. In addition to buy corn or grain out of market or fair to sell again, the licence had to contain \\"express words\\" allowing this. Licences could only be granted at Quarter Sessions, and by three Justices, of whom one had to be of the Quorum. Each one had to sign and seal the Licence. The Licence could be granted for no more than a year, and all licences expired on 1 May unless expressed to last longer. The Justices were entitled, but not required, to require a \\"bond or surety\\" by recognizance from or for the Badger. This could be up to ¬£5, the maximum penalty for a first offence against the Act. The Clerk of the Peace, or Deputy Clerk, but no lesser officer, had to write out the Licence, which cost 12 pence, and to enter the terms of licences in a register, which had to be produced at the Quarter Sessions. The Act was written in very detailed terms. The stringent technical requirements suggest that the legislature were concerned not only that markets were being threatened by competition from unregulated traders but also that Licences were too freely available, either legitimately because the Justices did not know how many were being granted, but also that they were being obtained illegally, perhaps from corrupt court officials or counterfeiters. Counterfeit licences for vagabonds and others were a constant problem. In practice licences were granted outside these conditions, including to women. Although Badgers, in common with most travellers in medieval and Elizabethan times, were required to have a Licence, and presumably carried it with them and produced it if challenged, there was no requirement in the legislation for them to wear a badge. There is anecdotal reference to it, and it is possible that in practice there was a custom or habit for them to do so, or be required to do so at some markets, (e.g., Smithfield Market). ==Repeal== The Acts regulating badgers were repealed in 1772 by 12 Geo III, c 71, An Act for repealing several laws therein mentioned against Badgers, Engrossers, Forestallers, and Regrators and for indemnifying Persons against Prosecutions for Offences committed against the said Acts. However, it was found not to have effectually repealed them because of repeated prohibitions in previous Acts. In 1800, one John Rusby was indicted for having bought ninety quarters of oats at 41s. per quarter and selling thirty of them at 43s. the same day. Lord Kenyon, the presiding judge, argued strongly against the repealing act, and addressed the jury strongly against the accused. Rusby was heavily fined, but, on appeal, the court was equally divided as to whether engrossing, forestalling and regrating were still offences at common law. Another repealing act was required in 1844 when 7 & 8 Vic. c. 24 (An Act for abolishing the Offences of Forestalling, regrating and engrossing, and for repealing certain Statutes passed in restraint of Trade), finally tidied up the law by repealing 19 other Acts passed between the reigns of Henry III and Edward VI. ==Notes== ==References== * *W.

Additionally, the concept of inhibition or reactive inhibition which is also latent, is introduced. The assumption is made that during states of attention inhibition linearly increases with a slope a1 and during states of distraction inhibition linearly decreases with a slope a0.According to this view the distraction states can be considered a sort of recovery state. It is further assumed, that when the inhibition increases during a state of attention, depending on the amount of increase, the inclination to switch to a distraction state also increases. When inhibition decreases during a state of distraction, depending on the amount of decrease, the inclination to switch to an attention state increases. The inclination to switch from one state to the other is mathematically described as a transition rate or hazard rate, making the whole process of alternating distraction times and attention times a stochastic process. == Theory == A non-negative continuous random variable T represents the time until an event will take place. The hazard rate Œª(t) for that random variable is defined to be the limiting value of the probability that the event will occur in a small interval [t,t + Œît]; given the event has not occurred before time t, divided by Œît. Formally, the hazard rate is defined by the following limit: :\\\\lambda(t) = \\\\lim_{\\\\Delta t \\\\to 0} \\\\frac{\\\\Pr(t \\\\le T < t + \\\\Delta t \\\\mid T \\\\ge t)}{\\\\Delta t} The hazard rate Œª(t) can also be written in terms of the density function or probability density function f(t) and the distribution function or cumulative distribution function F(t): :\\\\lambda(t) = \\\\frac{f(t)}{1-F(t)} The transition rates Œª1(t), from state 1 to state 0, and Œª0(t), from state 0 to state 1, depend on inhibition Y(t): Œª1(t) = ‚Ñì1(Y(t)) and Œª0(t) = ‚Ñì0(Y(t)), where ‚Ñì1 is a non-decreasing function and ‚Ñì0 is a non- increasing function. Note, that ‚Ñì1 and l0 are dependent on Y, whereas Y is dependent on T. Specification of the functions l1 and l0 leads to the various inhibition models. What can be observed in the test are the actual reaction times. A reaction time is the sum of a series of alternating distraction times and attention times, which cannot be observed. It is, nevertheless, possible to estimate from the observable reaction times some properties of the latent process of distraction times and attention times, i.e., the average distraction time, the average attention time, and the ratio a1/a0. In order to be able to simulate the consecutive reaction times, inhibition theory has been specified into various inhibition models. One is the so-called beta inhibition model. In the beta-inhibition model, it is assumed that the inhibition Y(t) oscillates between two boundaries which are 0 and M (M for Maximum), where M is positive. In this model ‚Ñì1 and ‚Ñì0 are as follows: :\\\\ell_1 (y) = \\\\frac{c_1 M}{M - y} and :\\\\ell_0 (y) = \\\\frac{c_0}{y} both with c0 > 0 and c1 > 0. Note that, according to the first assumption, as y goes to M (during an interval), ‚Ñì1(y) goes to infinity and this forces a transition to a state of rest before the inhibition can reach M. According to the second assumption, as y goes to zero (during a distraction), ‚Ñì0(y) goes to infinity and this forces a transition to a state of work before the inhibition can reach zero. For a work interval starting at t0 with inhibition level y0 = Y(t0) the transition rate at time t0 + t is given by Œª1(t) = l1(y0 + a1t). For a non-work interval starting at t0 with inhibition level y0 = Y(t0) the transition rate is given by Œª0(t) = ‚Ñì0(y0 ‚àí a0t). Therefore :\\\\lambda_1 (t) = \\\\frac{c_1 M}{M - (y_0 + a_1 t)} and :\\\\lambda_0 (t) = \\\\frac{c_0}{y_0 - a_0 t} The model has Y fluctuating in the interval between 0 and M. The stationary distribution of Y/M in this model is a beta distribution (the beta inhibition model). The total real working time until the conclusion of the task (or the task unit in case of a repetition of equivalent unit tasks), for example, in the Attention Concentration Test, is referred to as A. The average stationary response time E(T) may be written as : \\\\operatorname E(T) = A + \\\\frac{a_1}{a_0} A. For M goes to infinity Œª1(t) = c1. This model is known as the gamma ‚àí or Poisson inhibition ‚àí model (see Smit and van der Ven, 1995). == Application == Inhibition theory has especially been developed to account for short-term oscillation as well as the long-term trend in the reaction time curves obtained in continuous response tasks such as the Attention Concentration Test (ACT). The ACT typically consists of an overlearned prolonged work task in which each response elicits the next. Several authors, among them Binet (1900), stressed the importance of the fluctuation in the reaction times suggesting the mean deviation as a measure of performance. In this connection it is also worthwhile to mention a study by Hylan (1898). In his experiment B, he used, a 27 single digits addition task indicating the importance of the fluctuation of reaction times and was the first to report gradually increasing (marginally decreasing) reaction time curves (Hylan, 1898, page 15, figure 5). Recently, the inhibition model has been also used to explain the phase durations in binocular rivalry experiments (van der Ven, Gremmen & Smit, 2005). The model is able to account for the statistical properties of alternating phase durations T11, T01, T12, T02, T13, T03, ..., representing the amount of time a person perceives the stimulus in one eye T1j and in the other eye T0j. ==See also== * Cognitive inhibition == References == * Binet, A.

Virtanen answers: \\"Evidently 3270 Finnish marks.\\" B. Virtanen is a Finnish comic strip written by Ilkka Heil√§. In 2009, the comic was published in almost 50 newspapers. The strip is about the family and work life of a typical Finnish man named B. Virtanen. His full first name is never revealed and few, if any, Finnish first names start with the letter B, which does not occur in Finnish except in loanwords. He is married and has a steady job but both cause him constant trouble as he is hen- pecked by his wife at home and oppressed by his superiors at work. The main setting is the office in which B. Virtanen works. His employer is named Oy Firma Ab, literally \\"Company Ltd.\\"; its exact line of business is thus never revealed but the company has some sort of production since a factory has been mentioned. Heil√§ explained the B in an interview: Heil√§ made the character for a newspaper comic strip contest in 1989, and almost the first thing in his mind was the name. In that time, people used to talk about \\"A-class\\" and \\"B-class\\" citizens. B. certainly isn't second class, but his life isn't really \\"A-class\\" either. The idea of the series is simple, everyone walks over him. Heil√§ made about 20 strips of that idea, and got the shared second prize of the competition. The abbreviation of Virtanen's forename to an initial is not unusual in itself. It has been revealed in the comic that Virtanen does so because the name itself is so humiliating. In one strip his name is revealed to his co-workers (but censored to the reader) and the crowd bursts out laughing. Virtanen is among the most common surnames in Finland. The strip contains some running gags. One example is B. Virtanen filling out a company survey. Criticism is often made impossible because there are only positive or more positive choices to choose from. If there are negative choices the superiors will intimidate Virtanen not to give any \\"wrong\\" answers. Another example is the constantly malfunctioning copy machine. ==Characters== ; B. Virtanen: The main character. A meek middle-aged, overworked and abused worker in an office. He has been an employee for at least seventeen years. At home, he is hen-pecked by his wife and run over by their son. Occasionally he attempts to stand up to his superiors, family and even his cat but invariably ends up failing. ; Armi: B. Virtanen's domineering wife. She spends her days reading Me Siskot (\\"We Sisters\\") magazine and watching TV. She is prone to magnificent kitchen failures and is usually unable to produce food her family would be content to eat. She is significantly overweight and occasionally comes up with a dieting idea which tends to lead into even worse food and her forcing exercise on her husband as well. ; Marko: B. Virtanen's son. A grade school aged boy who rebels against his parents, has abysmal school performance, smokes, and has been shown having a variety of illegal pastimes. Occasionally he tries to earn extra money by selling some of his parent's possessions e.g. their car. ; Pasi: B. Virtanen's cat. Virtanen calls Pasi his best friend, but even though the cat is shown to be an affectionate and gentle family cat, it seems to stand higher in the family hierarchy. Virtanen cannot even make Pasi leave the recliner chair. ; Reino Murikka: A project manager at the office and B. Virtanen's immediate superior. He is fat, bald and middle- aged. He is very harsh towards B. Virtanen and often makes him work overtime. He often takes credit for Virtanen's good work. He is depicted as simple and can hardly operate a copy machine or computer. Murikka still lives with his mother Selma Murikka and has very little experience in dating or relationships although he does have a crush on Miss Jantunen. He has a twin brother named Antero. ; Selma Murikka: Reino Murikka's nurturing but overprotective mother. She relates critically to her son's would-be relationship with Miss Jantunen. ; Miss Jantunen: The company's secretary. She strongly feels there is gender discrimination in the company and often points it out. She is aware of Murikka's feelings for her but is not interested in him. ; Lennart Nilk√©n: A middle manager. He is fashionable and concerned with himself more than anything else. He has a habit of introducing convoluted and confusing reforms to the office and brown-nosing director Hyn√§l√§ in hopes of raises and promotion. He does very little actual work and often sneaks out to play golf or tennis. He has a spoiled daughter named Lisette. ; Director Hyn√§l√§: The company's CEO. He considers himself a perfect director \\"like in the good old days\\" but only cares about his company's profits and is very detached from the office's every-day reality. His underlings think of him as a dictator. He is almost always seen smoking a cigar. In one strip it was revealed that his father was the founder of the company and that is how he rose from errand boy directly to board of management. ; Topi: The most junior employee in the company and the only one in a lower position than B. Virtanen. However, this is only because of the short history of his employment and he is looking forward to being promoted. In 2014, Topi started his mandatory service in the Finnish Defence Forces and will be on leave from the company during this time. ; S√§de: Lennart Nilk√©n's niece, temporarily replacing Topi as an errand person while he is doing his armed service. S√§de is very loud-mouthed and rude to B. Virtanen and Reino Murikka and disinterested in her job. However, Virtanen and Murikka do not dare complain because their superior happens to be her uncle. ; The Doctor: The company doctor who always fails in curing the employees. ==References== Category:Comic strips missing date information Category:Comics characters Category:Finnish comic strips ","title":"B.

The Qliphoth are the unbalanced force of a particular sephirah. Netzach is the sephirah 'victory', the ability of raw, emotional, passionate energy to overcome obstacles, but it needs to be balanced by Hod, the ability to rationalize and exercise a degree of self-control. If it is not balanced it becomes uncontrolled passion, desire, greed and covetousness, the dark side of Venus, which is unbridled lust. The raven of dispersion is thought by some authors to be related to the raven Noah let fly from his ark while the waters dispersed. Also known as Harab Serapel.

They are usually found in country that is designated as rangeland. In 2013 there were a total of 527 pastoral leases in Western Australia.There are 452 stations made up of 507 pastoral leases covering about 87 million hectares of WA. - in https://au.news.yahoo.com/thewest/countryman/a/19462468/warning-on-worthless- leases/ - Brad Thompson - The West Australian on 19 October 2013 And all leases were put up for renewal or surrender in 2015.\\"All pastoral leases expire on 30 June 2015 with the current lease terms ranging from 21 years to 50 years. Most leases have been offered renewal for the same length of time as their current term.\\" Stations/pastoral leases are a significant part of Western Australian history. At different stages inquiries, pleas for extensions of lease times and royal commissions have been made into the industry. Nearly 90 million hectares or 36% of the area of Western Australia are covered by these stations.The Pastoral Lands Board of Western Australia ‚Äì Ensuring ecologically sustainable use of pastoral lands Despite the very low population involved in general management of stations, significant numbers of seasonal workers (shearers and others) have moved through the sheep stations to shear for wool. Also more recently stations have been used as holding places of feral goats for export and meat production. ==Administration== The current administration of leases is conducted by the appointed Minister for Lands of the day and the Pastoral Lands Board of Western Australia, which succeeded the Pastoral Board after changes to the Land Act of 1933 (repealed) and the new Land Administration Act of 1997.Pamphlet titled Pastoral Leases (February 1998) Land Administration Act Implementation Project of the Department of Land Administration (the Government Authority now known as Landgate) Further current policies and details of governance are updated within publications and websites administered by the Pastoral Lands Board.Pastoral leases home In 2006 the Pastoral Lands Board within the Department of Planning and Infrastructure produced a 24-page pamphlet,(2006) Travelling in Outback Western Australia ‚Äì Tips to help you enjoy your outback adventure Pastoral Lands Board; (National Library of Australia record) which although appearing to be dealing with Outback issues, deals mainly with the process of accessing pastoral leases in Western Australia. The significant distances between stations and points of transport have seen droving or \\"stock routes\\" created in the past, such as the Canning Stock Route. Also the rail route to Meekatharra can be seen as a means of reaching into the station country to facilitate stock transport. ==List== The list that follows is from various sources ‚Äì abandoned, amalgamated, relinquished, and historical (no longer current) leases may be in the list. The list includes the local government, and regional locations ‚Äì for more specific locating of the stations, the Travellers Atlas of Western Australia map identifies all current pastoral leases.Streetsmart Travellers Atlas of Western Australia (2006) Department of Land Information and West Australian Newspapers,9th ed. In the state Maps (Road Maps of Western Australia Maps 1-154) 'Pastoral Lease Stations' are identified with their names and boundaries. === A-C === { class=\\"sortable \\" - !width=\\"200\\"Name of pastoral lease !width=\\"200\\"Region !width=\\"200\\"LGA -

In 1837, Wallis was admitted to the bar. Wallis early developed a taste for literature and contributed to periodicals many articles of literary and historical criticism, also occasional verses. He became a proficient in Spanish literature and history and was elected a corresponding member of the Royal Academy of history of Madrid in 1843. He may have been an acquaintance of the budding poet and author Edgar Allan Poe, (1808-1849), along with his friend, the author and political figure John Pendleton Kennedy. In 1846, he was chosen a fellow of the Royal Society of Northern Antiquaries of Copenhagen, in the Kingdom of Denmark.New York Daily Tribune. August 13, 1846, p. 1, col. 1. In 1847 he visited Spain and in 1849 the U. S. Government sent him on a special mission to that country to examine the title to the public lands in their former colony of East Florida (on the peninsula), as affected by royal Spanish Crown grants during the negotiations for the treaty of 1819, which provided for the American annexation of Florida, and creation of the Territory of Florida. In 1851, he was the speaker at the first commencement exercises held for the newly renamed Central High School of Baltimore, (traditionally the third oldest public high school in America, founded as the High School in 1839, later the Male High School after 1844 (with the founding of two female secondary schools - Eastern and Western High Schools), and later titled by 1866 as The Baltimore City College), then located in the old \\"Assembly Rooms\\" building of 1796, famous as a former landmark Greek Revival styled dancing-social-literary and civic hall for the Baltimore Dancing Assembly, and later reading rooms and book stacks of the Library Company of Baltimore along with its newer rival, the Mercantile Library Association to the 1830s at the northeast corner of Holliday and East Fayette Streets, nextdoor to the famous Holliday Street Theatre, to the north, both of which perished in a large fire in November 1873, but the Theatre was later rebuilt and endured until 1917, now the site of the War Memorial Plaza and the War Memorial Building built in the mid-1920s, facing the massive Baltimore City Hall of 1867-1875. While the high school moved to its first new building at the southwest corner of West Centre and North Howard Streets, dedicated 1875). Wallis maintained a frequent and constant interest in the premier local public school and in the public schools system as a whole From 1859 until 1861, Wallis contributed largely to the editorial columns of the local newspaper, the Baltimore \\"Exchange\\", and wrote for other journals as well. He was a Whig until the organization of the American or \\"Know-Nothing\\" party, after which when it faded as a political and moral force, he was a Democrat. In April 1861, Wallis was elected to the lower House of Delegates of Maryland in the General Assembly of Maryland, and took an active part in the special proceedings of the Maryland Legislature, called into special session that Spring by Gov. Thomas H. Hicks, (1798-1865), as the authority of the Governor of Maryland at Frederick instead of the state capital at Annapolis which was then occupied by Massachusetts and New York militia under the command of Gen. Benjamin F. Butler, (1818-1893), deciding on the issue of secession and the state's relationship to the pending crisis and the forming war policies of President Abraham Lincoln. He was chairman of the committee on Federal relations, and made himself obnoxious to the Federal authorities by his reports, which were adopted by the Legislature, and which took strong ground against the possibilities of Civil War, as well as against the then prevailing \\"doctrine of military necessity\\". In September 12 of that year, four months after Butler's occupation of the state's major city, Wallis was arrested with many other members of the Maryland Legislature and other citizens of the city and state (including the new police marshal George Proctor Kane, (1820-1878), and newly elected reform mayor George William Brown), and imprisoned for more than fourteen months in Fort McHenry, Fort Lafayette, and Fort Warren for not citing a Union Oath before a succession vote. He was finally released by November, 1862, without conditions and without being informed of the official cause of his arrest. He then returned to the private practice of the law in Baltimore. In 1870, on the death of his friend John Pendleton Kennedy, (1795-1870), Wallis was elected provost of the University of Maryland at Baltimore. In December, 1872, as chairman of the art committee of private citizens appointed by the Maryland Legislature, he delivered the address upon the unveiling of sculptor William Henry Rinehart's statue of Maryland's own Chief Justice Roger Brooke Taney, (1777-1864), of the United States Supreme Court, eight years after his death, having served since 1835 and the similarly long tenure of Chief Justice John Marshall. ===Trivia=== One of his colleagues imprisoned with him in the 1860s, Henry Mactier Warfield, named his fifth son Teackle Wallis Warfield. He in turn in 1896 named his daughter Bessie Wallis Warfield. She later became famous as Wallis Simpson, Duchess of Windsor. ==Legacy== Statue of Wallis in Baltimore A bronze statue of Wallis in his likeness, was erected to his memory and stands east of the Washington Monument in West Mount Vernon Place in the park square sloping downhill to the east facing St. Paul Street along East Monument Street in Baltimore, Maryland, on a pedestal with his name and birth-death years. A bust of Wallis stands outside the ceremonial courtroom of the Mitchell Courthouse in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. ==Published works== Wallis contributed to many periodicals and numerous pamphlets on legal and literary subjects. Wallis also published: * Glimpses of Spain (1849) * Spain: Her Institutions, Politics, and Public Men (1853) * Discourse on the Life and Character of George Peabody (1870) * The Guerrillas: A Southern War Song.

Henderson first professional club was Aston Villa and following a series of loans went on to play most notably for Brighton and Hove Albion as well as playing six times for the Republic of Ireland. Henderson retired in 2009 following a spinal injury. ==Personal life== Born in Dublin, Henderson comes from a family of goalkeepers. His father Paddy played for Shamrock Rovers in the 1960s, and older brothers Dave and Stephen played with great success in the League of Ireland in the 1980s and 1990s. His nephew Stephen is who plays for Crystal Palace. Henderson is married to former The Apprentice contestant Liz Locke. ==Club career== Henderson played schoolboy football for Dublin side Cherry Orchard, before joining Aston Villa in 1999. He did not play for Villa's first team, but he wore the number 1 shirt in their FA Youth Cup win in 2002. During his time at Villa, Henderson was loaned out several times: to Tamworth in March 2004; Wycombe Wanderers (April‚ÄìMay 2004), Notts County (August to October 2004 and December 2004 to January 2005), and Brighton and Hove Albion (August to December 2005). Following his loan spell at Brighton, he was purchased by the club in January 2005. On 30 January 2007, Henderson handed in a transfer request at the Seagulls, and on 31 January he joined Preston North End for a fee of ¬£150,000, which could rise to ¬£250,000 depending on first- team and international appearances. However, after only a handful of appearances for Preston North End, Henderson picked up a serious back injury in August 2007. He was expected to return to training in time for pre season the following season, however complications with the injury kept him out for longer than expected. On 27 February 2009, Henderson signed an initial one- month loan deal with Grimsby Town. Henderson was signed by Grimsby boss Mike Newell to fill the boots of their keeper at the time Phil Barnes whose performances had dipped. Henderson was an integral part of the Grimsby side that managed to stave off relegation from the Football League. On 15 March 2011, after battling against a serious spine injury for over two years and never fully recovering, Henderson was released from his contract at Preston. He announced his retirement the following week. ==International career== Henderson represented Republic of Ireland at every level including the U-16 team at the 2000 UEFA European Under-16 Football Championship and the U-20 team at the 2003 FIFA World Youth Championship, and was the first-choice goalkeeper for the Republic of Ireland Under-21 football team. On 16 February 2006 Henderson received his first senior call up to the Republic of Ireland and made his international debut on 1 March 2006, playing in the second half of the 3‚Äì0 win over Sweden. He received his second cap in the 1‚Äì0 defeat to Chile, although keeping a clean sheet. Henderson was also called up to face the Czech Republic in a Euro 2008 qualifier in October 2006; the final score was 1‚Äì1, and against San Marino in a Euro 2008 qualifier, finishing 2 ‚Äì 1 to Ireland.

It is a closed ring of seven carbon atoms joined by three double bonds (as the name implies) and four single bonds. This colourless liquid has been of recurring theoretical interest in organic chemistry. It is a ligand in organometallic chemistry and a building block in organic synthesis. Cycloheptatriene is not aromatic, as reflected by the nonplanarity of the methylene bridge (-CH2-) with respect to the other atoms; however the related tropylium cation is. ==Synthesis== Albert Ladenburg first generated cycloheptatriene in 1881 by the decomposition of tropine. The structure was finally proven by the synthesis of Richard Willst√§tter in 1901. This synthesis started from cycloheptanone and established the seven membered ring structure of the compound. Cycloheptatriene can be obtained in the laboratory by photochemical reaction of benzene with diazomethane or the pyrolysis of the adduct of cyclohexene and dichlorocarbene. A related classic synthesis for cycloheptatriene derivatives, the Buchner ring enlargement, starts with the reaction of benzene with ethyl diazoacetate to give the corresponding norcaradiene ethyl ester, which then undergoes a thermally-allowed electrocyclic ring expansion to give 1,3,5-cycloheptatriene 7-carboxylic acid ethyl ester.Buchner, et al., Ber., 18, 2377 (1885);For a variation: The Buchner ring expansion, a classical synthesis for cycloheptatriene derivatives ==Reactions== Removal of a hydride ion from the methylene bridge gives the planar and aromatic cycloheptatriene cation, also called the tropylium ion. A practical route to this cation employs PCl5 as the oxidant. CHT behaves as a diene in Diels‚ÄìAlder reactions.

One of her few historical novels written specifically for adults, it is her interpretation of the legend of King Arthur. This is the first novel that Sutcliff wrote using a first-person singular point of view for her story. In an interview with Raymond H. Thompson (in 1986), she explained that she actually spent the eighteen months while writing this story thinking like a man and felt that the story was being fed to her. Unlike most of the series The Eagle of the Ninth, it does not follow either the inheritor of the dolphin seal ring or the person who will eventually marry said inheritor; although the current inheritor, the son of the protagonist of The Lantern Bearers, is a minor character in the book, the action follows the character of Artos (Arthur) as established in The Lantern Bearers. ==Plot== The events of the novel follow and continue those of The Lantern Bearers. Artos (Sutcliff's version of Arthur) recalls his life as he lies near death, from the time when he served under his uncle, the British high king Ambrosius. He gathers a core cavalry group, Artos' Companions, who will be pivotal to the resistance of the British kingdoms to the invading Saxons. While visiting Arfon, in North Wales, where he grew up, Artos meets a woman, Ygerna, who drugs and seduces him. He is unaware that the woman is his half-sister, and that her seduction was a deliberate plan to gain revenge against their father; Ygerna is Uther's daughter, whereas Artos is Uther's illegitimate son. Artos' seduction and the conception of Medraut is Ygerna's means of bringing ruin to Artos. Artos marries Guenhumara in order to bolster his forces with much needed troops. His relationship with her is difficult as a result of his previous involvement with Ygerna, and his best friend Bedwyr eventually betrays Artos by his involvement with Artos' wife. Sutcliff presents the Arthur legend in a realist manner, portraying Arthur as a historical figure, and excluding the grail quest, Merlin and many of the more fantastic elements of the legend. However many elements, such as the death of his daughter being linked to a Celtic 'curse', retain magical elements, but linked to Celtic religious practices. Indeed, Artos is shown as a man of two worlds, part Romano British, the descendant of the Romanised city-dwelling peoples of the South of Britain and part descendant of the more Celtic tribes of the mountains of Wales and Southern Scotland. The tension between these two cultures influences Artos's character, and his seduction by Ygerna. The battles in particular are described realistically. The Battle of Badon Hill is set at the Vale of the White Horse at Uffington and was planned out with the aid of a military advisor. The story removes Lancelot, and gives the friend-and-lover's role to Bedwyr (old Welsh form of the name Bedivere). The name Ygerna is related to Igraine. Other characters familiar from Arthurian legend who are members of Arthur's Companions include Gwalchmai (Gawain) and Cei (Kay). ==Adaptations== Sword at Sunset was adapted for the stage by award-winning playwright James Beagon and performed by the Edinburgh University Theatre Company from 25 February-1 March 2014 at The production received a 'Nae Bad' from . ==External links== * Interview with Rosemary Sutcliff by Raymond H.Thompson in 1986 Rosemary Sutcliff discusses her experience of writing Sword at Sunset * Hic Jacet Arthurus Rex Quondam Rexque Futurus by Francis Brett Young.

It describes the Moonshae Isles of Faer√ªn. ==Contents== The book describes the Celtic-inspired isles in the Sea of Moonshae, setting for the novel Darkwalker on Moonshae and its sequels by Doug Niles, describing the climate, topography, and economy of the islands, including the Korinn Archipelago, which was created by Aaron Allston and first detailed in the module N4 Treasure Hunt.Allston, Aaron. Treasure Hunt (TSR, 1986) It also details two different regional cultures: the realms of the indigenous Ffolk, and the area held by the invading Northmen. The book discusses the character races, character classes, politics, conflicts, geography, and economics within the Moonshaes. The islands are home to the Ffolk, a druidic people who worship the Earthmother, a neutrally aligned aspect of Chauntea, the neutral-good goddess of agriculture. The Ffolk share the Moonshaes with the Northmen, a strong, warlike race of raiders who hail from the lands north of Waterdeep. Conflicts frequently erupt between the two races, as the Northmen expand their holdings on the Moonshaes at the expense of the Ffolk. Magic-users are viewed with suspicion by both groups. The Moonshaes are also home to marauding firbolgs, orcs, goblins, trolls, and other more dangerous monsters. The book next describes the major supernatural entities which exist in the countryside and seas. The most important of these is the Earthmother. She gives life and vitality to the land, and her power is manifested in the Moonwells. The Moonwells are pools of water with the magical power to cure the wounds of those who strive to maintain the \\"mystic balance\\", and are tended by druids who can use them to charge or restore charges in magical items. The Earthmother is served by her three immortal children: Leviathan, a huge whale; Kamerynnm, a majestic unicorn; and the Pack, a pack of dire wolves who roam the Isles. They are opposed by the evil Kazgoroth the Beast, who seeks to disrupt the balance and bring corruption to the Isles, aided by its magically created Blood Warriors: undead soldiers who obey its every command. Several specific locales of the Moonshaes are also described, from the perspective of Elminster as a tour of the people and places he has visited. The style of presentation is similar to that used in the Forgotten Realms Campaign Set. The sixty-four page booklet comes wrapped in a removable cover. Included with the book is a fold-out color poster map of the Moonshae Isles, which lie to the west of the main continent of the Forgotten Realms setting. This large color insert has maps of the Moonshae Isles printed on both sides. One side is at a scale of 20 miles per inch, while the reverse is scaled at 30 miles per inch. Both maps contain the same amount of detail, the major difference being that there is less open sea surrounding the 20-miles-per-inch map. One of the maps lines up with the edges of the maps in the Forgotten Realms Campaign Set. Two appendixes explain using the Moonshaes in a campaign and the magical items of the Moonshaes. ==Publication history== FR2 Moonshae was written by Douglas Niles, with cover art by Tim Hildebrandt and interior illustrations by George Barr, and was published by TSR in 1987. The book features editing by Mike Breault, and cartography by Dave S. LaForce. Shannon Appelcline commented that as role-playing games became supplemented with more publication of background material in the 1980s, \\"TSR finally recognized this new direction and made it an industry standard in the late '80s. This wasn't through their publication of the Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting (1987) ‚Äî which was a lot like The World of Greyhawk campaign box that had preceded it ‚Äî but rather through their release of a string of detailed setting books that began with FR1: Waterdeep and the North (1987) and FR2: Moonshae (1987).\\" In June 2018 Wizards of the Coast working with Baldman Games published Rising Shadows: Moonshae Isles Regional Guide by Shawn Merwin, Robert Alaniz, and Eric Menge. Douglas Niles provided a foreword. ==Reception== Jim Bambra reviewed Moonshae for the December issue of Dragon magazine in 1988. Bambra felt that the physical quality of the supplement was high, although he felt that not all available space was used to its best effect. For example, the inside of the wrap-around cover is blank, as it could have been used to provide village or town maps, or even sample monster lairs. He did feel that maps were also put to good use to graphically depict the extent of Northmen settlements in the Moonshaes, and to show the economies and trade routes of the Isles. Bambra commented on Niles' design of the book: \\"it's more than just the background and people presented in this supplement that makes Moonshae a very strong source pack.

As a reserve unit, it has a status roughly equivalent to that of a British Army Reserve or United States Army National Guard unit. ==History== ===Origin=== This unit was formed in East London in 1876, as the Buffalo Corps of Rifle Volunteers, for service in the 9th Frontier War. It disbanded in 1879. (East London is situated on the Buffalo River, hence the name). ===Reformed=== The unit was re-formed in July 1883 and was named after the region of Kaffraria, the 19th-century name for the region around East London. There had previously been many other units from this region, from which the Regiment can also claim descent: *Kaffrarian Volunteer Corps, *Kaffrarian Mounted Rifles (Kaffrarian Rangers), *Buffalo Volunteer Rifles Corps, *Buffalo Volunteer Engineers, *Kaffrarian Volunteer Artillery Corps, *Berlin Mounted Volunteers, *Cape Mounted Yeomanry (1st Regiment), * Frontier Mounted Riflemen (Brabant's Horse), *East London Volunteers (Von Linsignen's Buffalo Corps and later Walkers Horse). On 1 December 1900 George Herbert Farrar was appointed as a Major in the Kaffrarian Rifles. ===Under the Union Defence Force=== By 1913 the unit was embodied in the Citizen Force as the 5th Infantry (Kaffrarian Rifles), but regained its old name in 1932. The unit was temporarily amalgamated with the First City Regiment, as the First City/The Kaffrarian Rifles from 1954 to 1956. ===Conflicts=== This Regiment and its predecessors took part in all of South Africa's armed conflicts, including: * the Bechuanaland Campaign (1897), * the Second Boer War, * World War I (when it fought in the then German South-West Africa and most of its members went on to serve in East Africa and Europe), * World War II (when it fought in the Western Desert during 1941 - 1943) as well as in * South Africa's \\"Border War\\" during 1975 to 1986 (when it fought in South-West Africa, Angola and Zambia). ===Under the SANDF post 1994 and Peacekeeping=== In order to keep pace with the changing political climate in South Africa, the regiment was renamed the Buffalo Volunteer Rifles in 1999. As of 2014 this regiment is considered to be a \\"fully integrated and representative\\" army unit. Members have been attached to the United Nations Operation in Burundi and recently a Rifle company returned from the Democratic Republic of the Congo after a six-month spell of active duty as part of MONUSCO. == Leadership == ==Regimental symbols== * Current regimental colour (since 2001): a dark green background with embroidered in the centre a wreath of ten proteas and two king proteas. Beneath the wreath and above the ribbon is an aloe with five blooms. This symbolises the BVR link with the Border region, the fact that some of its members are Xhosas from the greater Eastern Cape, and its status of the 5th Infantry Regiment from 1913 to 1933. Within the wreath is the regiment's Maltese cross (symbolic of the regiment's King's Royal Rifle Corps and German affiliations, as many of the Regiment's 19th century members were of German extraction) with a buffalo head in the centre, surrounded by two concentric circles. Between the circles the regimental motto, Nunc animus (meaning \\"Now with courage\\" or \\"Now without fear\\") is inscribed. At the top of the regimental crest is a powder horn, symbolizing the link with the British Royal Green Jackets regiment. * East London bestowed the freedom of the city on the regiment on 25 May 1957. ===Previous Dress Insignia=== SADF era Buffalo Volunteer Rifles insignia ===Current Dress Insignia=== Buffalo Volunteer Rifles unique ranks The Buffalo Volunteer Rifles still utilize a British Infantry tradition where officers had a red backing and ranks were blackened out on fatigues.

Widmer attended the Mennonite church at Montb√©liard as a young man and was baptised there. He attended the √âcole Normale in Besan√ßon, where he developed a love for poetry. In 1936, Widmer married H√©l√®ne Sommer, the daughter of Pierre Sommer, a man of great enthusiasm for the Mennonite church. He was the best known itinerant French Mennonite preacher, responsible for the first French Mennonite conferences, founder and editor of the journal Christ Seul (Christ Alone). In Widmer's youth, the Mennonites were a small community in France (about 4,000 people) living in isolated rural communities in Alsace, Lorraine and the Pays de Montb√©liard. They were the descendants of the Swiss Anabaptist communities which fled to France during the 16th century Reformation. ==War service== Unlike North American Mennonites, who emigrated in the 18th century, French Mennonites had largely abandoned the principle of non-resistance or pacifism. It was not unusual then that Widmer enrolled in the Ecole des Sous-Officiers, a military academy at Saint Maixent. Afterwards, he became a primary school teacher near Montb√©liard but remained in the Army reserves. When France declared war on Germany in September 1939, Widmer was recalled up to the Army. He was serving on the front along the Rhine when Germany invaded France in June 1940. His unit was beaten back to the Vosges mountains. Widmer was taken prisoner by the Germans at Masevaux in the Haut Rhin. ==POW== Widmer spent five years in three different German prison camps for French officers. During that time, he was apparently treated well since French officers enjoyed better conditions than captured enlisted men. However, the experience of the war and captivity deeply marked Widmer. He devoted himself to caring for the spiritual needs of his comrades, serving as a de facto camp chaplain. In this role, he came to meet and appreciate the convictions of Lutheran, Reformed, Darbyist, Evangelical and even Catholic prisoners. Widmer also became convinced of the futility of war, even a patriotic or \\"just war\\". This change in his position about violence is clear in the poems that Widmer wrote during captivity, published in 1987 as Ombres et Lumi√®res or \\"Shadows and Light\\". Upon his release from the prison camp at the end of the war, Widmer was awarded the Croix de Guerre and a Citation √† l'Arm√©e pour Actes de Bravoure. ==Post-war Mennonite tensions== When Widmer returned to his home in Montb√©liard in May 1945 at the end of the war, he found a French Mennonite community in upheaval. The experience of the war had exacerbated tensions between Alsatian and French-speaking Mennonite communities. The fighting had destroyed many Mennonite farms. The Mennonite community was increasingly aged and isolated. Widmer was regarded by many Mennonites with great respect because of having endured the long captivity, for his relative youth (33 years), and because he was the natural successor of church leader Pierre Sommer, his father-in-law. Widmer is elected Ancien or elder of the Montb√©liard church in 1945. When Widmer took the floor at the Synode of Mennonite churches in May 1946, he called for greater unity among the Mennonite communities and a greater focus on activities for youth. His proposals were not unanimously appreciated. The Alsatian Mennonites decided at their conference at Pfastatt a few weeks later to turn down Widmer's proposal for a single French Mennonite association of churches. Fearing a loss of tradition, Hans Nussbaumer, elder of the Mennonite church at Altkirch, spoke out against Widmer's activities with youth. But the Synode did appoint Widmer to replace the aging Pierre Sommer as editor of Christ Seul, a position he would hold for 38 years. Widmer also won approval for his offer to become a full-time itinerant pastor in 1948. ==Links to the United States== Widmer was instrumental in renewing ties with American Mennonites, and in bringing an ecclesiology to French Mennonites that was regarded by many as being particularly American. Widmer represented French Mennonites at the Mennonite World Conference in Goshen, Indiana, in 1948. During his stay in the United States, Widmer was impressed by the level of organization in the American churches, including youth activities and Sunday schools. He was also deeply influenced by the American Mennonite commitment to pacifism. American Mennonites such as Harold Bender, Guy Hershberger and Orie Miller wrote and spoke out on the topic of non-resistance and peacemaking. Bender's 1942 article \\"The Anabaptist Vision\\" posits that the Mennonites should return to the faith of the 16th century Anabaptists, characterized by non-conformity to the world, complete love and service to one's neighbors, and a rejection of all forms of violence. John H. Yoder, a disciple of Bender from Goshen, came to France to work with the Mennonite Central Committee in the 1950s. He and Widmer collaborated on many projects, including a translation into French of The Anabaptist Vision, and the creation of a children's home at Valdoie, near Belfort. Widmer was also instrumental in creating American-style Sunday school classes for children at many French Mennonite churches. He organized the first summer camps for children at Laxou near Nancy. Widmer was the motor behind the creation of many French Mennonite associations. He was the co-founder and president of the Comit√© Missionaire Mennonite Fran√ßaise (French Mennonite Missions Committee) which supported missionaries abroad, co-founder and president of La Mission Mennonite Fran√ßaise (collaborated with the MCC to support evangelisation and relief efforts in post-war France), co-founder and first professor of the Mennonite Biblical Institute in Basel, Switzerland, co- founder of the Evangelical seminary at Vaux-sur-Seine, co-founder and president of the Entente √âvangelique du Pays de Montb√©liard, among others. In 1962, Widmer's wife H√©l√®ne died of cancer. Widmer remarried two years later to Christianne Buy, the widow of Robert Gaudry, the director of the children's home at Valdoie that Widmer had helped to create. ==Later work== With the mouthpiece of the journal Christ Seul, Widmer brought articles about peace and social justice into the homes of thousands of French Mennonites. Widmer published Pages Choisies de Pierre Sommer (selected writings of Pierre Sommer) upon his father-in-law's death in 1952, in which he emphasizes Sommer's commitment to peace. Widmer was part of a committee of French Mennonites which, with the help of General Neyhauser, unsuccessfully petitioned successive French governments from 1949 onward to allow the creation of civic service as an alternative to obligatory military service. He also fostered an opening of the French Mennonite church to other denominations. He was the elder member of the Mennonite committee to the Lutheran-Mennonite dialogues of 1981-84. He did not hesitate to propose joint activities with other churches, such as the creation of the Evangelical Seminary at Vaux-sur-Seine. But Widmer was also conscious of preserving a distinctive Mennonite identity, even as the church embraced fellow Christians. His book Ce que croient les Mennonites (What Mennonites Believe), published in 1981 during the Lutheran-Mennonite dialogues, is an affirmation of the core beliefs of the church, including a commitment to peace and service. Widmer also wrote Il y a des gens qui vous troublent (There are those that trouble you) in 1984 in which he defended traditional Mennonite beliefs against the influences of Pentecostal and charismatic movements. ==Retirement== Widmer retired from his work at Christ Seul in 1984, turning his editors desk over to his son-in-law from his second marriage, Pierre Lugbull. In 1993 his second wife Christianne Buy died. As his health deteriorated, Widmer withdrew as Ancien from the Montb√©liard church in 1997. He died in Montb√©liard in 1999 at the age of 87. == Notes == Category:French Mennonites Category:1912 births Category:1999 deaths Category:Mennonite ministers Category:20th-century Anabaptist ministers ","title":"Pierre Widmer"},{"id":"3232652","text":"Pressure experiments are experiments performed at pressures lower or higher than atmospheric pressure, called low-pressure experiments and high-pressure experiments, respectively.

Both enantiomers occur in nature. (+)-Citronellol, which is found in citronella oils, including Cymbopogon nardus (50%), is the more common isomer. (‚àí)-Citronellol is found in the oils of rose (18‚Äì55%) and Pelargonium geraniums. ==Preparation== Citronellol can be prepared by hydrogenation of geraniol or nerol. ==Uses== Citronellol is used in perfumes and insect repellents, and as a mite attractant. Citronellol is a good mosquito repellent at short distances, but protection greatly lessens when the subject is slightly further from the source. When complexed with Œ≤-cyclodextrin, it has on average a 90-minute protection duration against mosquitoes. Citronellol is used as a raw material for the production of rose oxide. ==Health and safety== The United States FDA considers citronellol as generally recognized as safe (GRAS) for food use. Citronellol is subject to restrictions on its use in perfumery, as some people may become sensitised to it, but the degree to which citronellol can cause an allergic reaction in humans is disputed.Survey and health assessment of chemical substances in massage oils ==See also== * Citronellal * Geraniol * Rhodinol * Pelargonium graveolens * Perfume intolerance (allergy) ==References== Category:Perfume ingredients Category:Flavors Category:Monoterpenes Category:Alkenols ","title":"Citronellol"},{"id":"3232702","text":"Kent Robert Williams (born 1962) is an American painter and graphic novel artist.

Before 1978 it was known as under-23 team. It ceased to exist on the breakup of the Union. Following the realignment of UEFA's youth competitions in 1976, the USSR Under-21 team was formed. The team had a good record, winning the competition twice, reaching the last four once, but failing to qualify for the last eight on five occasions. After the dissolution of the USSR (on 26 December 1991), the senior team played out its remaining fixtures, which were the finals of Euro 92. Because the USSR U-21s had, by 26 December, already failed to qualify for their version of the 1992 European Championship, the former Soviet states didn't play as a combined team at U-21 level ever again. Of the former Soviet states, only Russia entered the 1992‚Äì1994 competition. A total of 15 former Soviet states play international football today; 11 in Europe under UEFA, 4 in Asia under the AFC. Since the under-21 competition rules insist that players must be 21 or under at the start of a two-year competition, technically it is an U-23 competition. USSR's unparalleled record in U-23 competitions is also shown. == UEFA U-23 Championship Record == * 1972: Runners-up. * 1974: Losing semi-finalists. * 1976: Winners. == UEFA U-21 Championship Record == * 1978: Did not qualify.

The station contains part of Lake Austin and close to Nallan Creek. ==History== 128 bales of greasy wool from the station were sold in London in 1910 at 11d. per pound. Later the same year a bank clerk named Studds from Cue was found to have committed suicide on the property and was found several weeks later with his revolver still in his hand. A tragedy occurred at the station in 1911 when a character from the Day Dawn goldfields, Jimmy the Fiddler, left the station in very hot weather and was found a week later from a well. The 70-year-old was thought to have died of dehydration. By 1912 the station had a flock of 10,000 sheep that were to be sheared in early August using 9 stands. The station suffered some damage during an intense storm in 1914, when some out-buildings were destroyed hy the wind. J. P. Meehan reported that rain fell in 20 minutes and several trees were hit by lightning. In 1918 the station shore 28,000 sheep and in 1921 the second shearing of the season saw 8,000 shorn for 214 bales of wool. During the 1919 season two men were struck down with influenza and Meehan took them to Cue for treatment. Upon arrival the men were isolated at the Cue State School. Another man was taken from the station to join them a few days later. Five other men remained at the station but confined to bed for several days. Shearing operations were suspended until the men recovered. The Meehans cut out 15,500 sheep, including 1,200 lambs, for 279 bales of wool in 1925, the following year 10,000 sheep were shorn for 238 bales of wool. Leslie Keamy, the prominent merino stud breeder and owner of Cardo Station, once held an interest in Austin Downs and Yarraquin Station. A flash-flood washed through the area following heavy thunderstorms on New Year's Day in 1929. The rain broke drought conditions and refilled both the nearby Wire Pool and then flowed through the station onward to Lake Austin. In 1929 the station cut out 16,081 sheep for 377 bales on the first clip with lambs and straggler to be collected for a second. The station experienced some flooding when of rain fell in 1933. Flooding occurred on the property in 1934 following heavy downpours, of rain was recorded in a day at the station with heavier falls at surrounding properties. The crossing at Wire Pool was at a record level and all surrounding road were rendered impassable. The station is the subject of a book The Station at Austin Downs written by Jo Jackson King. After two years of drought, one of the longest dry spells on record, the area received relieving rains in 2010. . By 2010 the leasee was the Jackson family under the management of Tom Jackson. Austin Downs is operating under the Crown Lease number CL192-1972 and has the Land Act number LA3114/600. ==See also== *List of ranches and stations *List of pastoral leases in Western Australia ==References== Category:Mid West (Western Australia) Category:Pastoral leases in Western Australia Category:Stations (Australian agriculture) ","title":"Austin Downs"},{"id":"3232738","text":"Gollion is a municipality of the canton of Vaud in Switzerland, located in the district of Morges. ==History== Gollion is first mentioned in 1228 as Gollun. ==Geography== Fields outside Gollion Aerial view (1949) Gollion has an area, , of .

Pope Paul VI elevated Hossu to the rank of cardinal in pectore, that is, secretly, in 1969 but did not publish his appointment until after Hossu's death. The Communist authorities arrested Bishop Hossu on 28 October 1948. From 1950 to 1955 he was detained as political prisoner at the Sighet prison. He spent the rest of his life under house arrest and died in 1970. Pope Francis confirmed Hossu and six other prelates' beatification in 2019 and it was celebrated in Blaj, Romania on 2 June 2019.https://www.americamagazine.org/faith/2019/06/02/joyous-celebration- romania-pope-francis-beatifies-seven-bishop-martyrs Pope Francis personally presided over the beatification as well. ==Life== ===Education and priesthood=== His uncle Vasile who ordained him as a priest. Iuliu Hossu was born in 1885 in Mila»ô in the then-Austro-Hungarian empire to Ioan Hossu (1856‚Äì???) and Victoria MƒÉriu≈£iu. His brothers were Vasile (a barrister) and Traian (a doctor) and Ioan (an engineer). His paternal grandparents were Vasile Hossu (1831‚Äì89) and Maria Sebeni; his paternal cousin was Iustin Hossu. A nephew was Stefan Hossu. His paternal aunts were Alecsa and Nicolae Hossu (1859‚Äì1914). His great-grandfather was Iosif Hossu (1822‚Äì46) and before him were Nicolae (1768‚Äì1841) and Petre (c. 1525). Hossu studied at the ecclesial school in Cluj and later in Budapest. His grade four studies were overseen at a Roman Catholic school in T√¢rgu Mure≈ü while grade five to eight was spent at a Greek-Catholic school in Blaj. He also studied at the Vienna college in Austria and later at the Pontifical Urbanian Athenaeum in Rome where he went on to obtain doctorates in philosophical studies in 1906 and in theological studies in 1908. His uncle Vasile Hossu (30.01.1866‚Äì13.01.1916) ordained him to the priesthood on 27 March 1910. He completed further studies from 1910 to 1911 and served as an archivist and a librarian. From 1911 to 1914 he served as the personal aide to the Bishop of Gherla (his uncle Vasile) and became friends with Prime Minister Istv√°n Tisza. He later served as a chaplain to the Romanian soldiers in the Austro-Hungarian armed forces during World War I between 1914 and 1917. His brothers Vasile and Traian were mobilized as soldiers during the war while his brother Ioan was made a rail officer at the Oradea station. His cousin Iustin fought and died on the Serbian front. The death of his cousin prompted him to join as a chaplain so the new lieutenant left in December 1914 from Timi»ôoara to Vienna where he tended to the soldiers. ===Episcopate=== ====Austria-Hungary==== Pope Benedict XV appointed him as the Bishop of Gherla on 17 April 1917 and he received his episcopal consecration on 4 December 1917; the Blessed Karl I nominated him for the position on 3 March and forwarded it to the pope for his confirmation. Iuliu Hossu (right) reading in Alba Iulia the Resolution of the National Assembly on 1 December 1918 ====Romanian National Assembly of Alba Iulia==== In November 1918 Bishop Hossu was nominated representative by right in the National Assemby of all Romanians in Hungary, which declared the Union of Transylvania with Romania on 1 December 1918. On 1 December 1918 Hossu read the Resolution of the National Assemby in front of the crowds gathered in Alba Iulia, preceding it with the following words: \\"Brethren, the hour of fulfillment is this one, when God Almighty is speaking out His centuries-old longing for justice through His faithful people. Today, by our decision, Greater Romania is achieved, one and indivisible, all Romanians from these lands happily calling: We are joining forever our Motherland, Romania! [..] Justice has prevailed\\". Next day, at Iuliu Maniu's proposal, the High National Romanian Council mandated representatives Vasile Goldi»ô, Alexandru Vaida-Voevod, Iuliu Hossu and Miron Cristea to go to King Ferdinand and present him with the Resolution of the National Assembly. ====Kingdom of Romania==== He was named as the Bishop of Cluj-Gherla when the see was transferred on 5 June 1930 and Pope Pius XI later appointed him as the Apostolic Administrator of Maramure≈ü from 1930 until 1931 when a successor for that diocese was named. Hossu was named an Assistant at the Pontifical Throne on 16 September 1936 which made him a Monsignor. He also made the Apostolic Administrator of Oradea Mare from 1941 until 1947 when Pope Pius XII appointed him as such. ====Communist repression, forced attempts at union with Orthodox Church==== For his opposition to the government he was forced to flee his diocese on 28 October 1948 but was soon arrested. He was confined at Jilava and Drogoslavele and later at Sighet and Gherla from 1948 to 1964. He was relocated to a convent near Bucharest from that point until 1970 and was transferred to a hospital there in May 1970. He opposed the forced passage of Greek-Catholic believers to the Romanian Orthodox Church.Sergiu Grosu (1992) Ordeal Christian Romania, ABC Literary Talk & DAVA, p. 36. On 1 October 1948 he gave an Exclamation Decree (ipso facto) to the participants in the Cluj Assembly of the 36 Greek Catholic priests who would decide to break the Greek-Catholic union with the Church of Rome. On 28 October 1948, Hossu was arrested in his episcopal residence in Cluj and taken to the patriarchal villa of Dragoslavele, where he was held under guard in hunger and cold together with the other Greek-Catholic bishops arrested. Both the communist authorities and the leadership of the Romanian Orthodox Church represented by Patriarch Justinian Marina personally offered him the Orthodox metropolitan chair of Moldavia in exchange for renouncing the Catholic faith and the connection with Rome and Catholic Church. Refusing to convert to Orthodoxy, Bishop Iuliu Hossu was first transferred to CƒÉldƒÉru≈üani Monastery, and in 1950 to the Sighet Penitentiary. In 1955 he was taken to Curtea de Arge»ô, and in 1956 to the Ciorog√¢rla Monastery. Following the Greek-Catholic Liturgy celebrated at the Church of the Piarists in Cluj on 12 August 1956 by the three united bishops alive at the time, they were dispersed from Ciorog√¢rla. During his forced domicile at Ciorogarla Monastery, Hossu was regularly visited by Orthodox hierarchs, including Justinian Marina, Teoctist ArƒÉpa»ôu and Gherasim Cristea.L-a turnat pe cardinalul Hossu la Securitate din... respect. romanialibera.ro Bishop Iuliu Hossu arrived again in CƒÉldƒÉru≈üani, where he stayed with compulsory residence until the end of his life.

On 28 April 1969 he was created a cardinal but Pope Paul VI reserved Hossu in pectore (to be kept secret). His elevation to the rank of cardinal was announced on 5 March 1973, after Hossu's death. On 22 February 1969 the pope had granted a private audience to Monsignor Hieronymus Menges and the prelate asked Paul VI to do something that would encourage the faithful and give them a sign that the Romanian people were close to his heart. Paul VI asked: \\"what?\\" The prelate then recommended that the pope raise Hossu and future Servant of God √Åron M√°rton as cardinals and to appoint some priests as monsignors. Archbishop Agostino Casaroli sent his aide not long after this to Bucharest to ask the Minister for Culture whether or not the government would accept the two promotions. The government agreed to accept M√°rton but not Hossu as a cardinal. M√°rton learned of this and refused the honor when he learned that the government had rejected Hossu's appointment, with the result that Paul reserved Hossu in pectore and did not make M√°rton a cardinal. ===Death=== Hossu died on 28 May 1970 at 9:00am at Colentina Hospital in Bucharest with Bishop Alexandru Todea at his side. He was buried in Bucharest and his last words were recorded as being: \\"My struggle ends; yours continues\\". On 7 December 1982 his remains were exhumed and transferred. ==Beatification== Hossu on a 2018 Romanian stamp. The beatification process ‚Äì which conferred the title Servant of God upon him ‚Äì commenced with the declaration of \\"nihil obstat\\" (nothing against) to the cause on 28 January 1997. The eparchial process delved into his life (and that of six other prelates in the joint cause) through the collection of documentation and testimonies. This process spanned from 16 January 1997 until 10 March 2009. The end of this local process saw all the findings taken in boxes to the Congregation for the Causes of Saints in Rome who validated the process on 18 February 2011. The relator was appointed on 27 May 2011 and helps in drafting the Positio dossier with the cause's officials. The dossier was submitted to the C.C.S. in April 2018. All nine theologians voted in favor of the cause in January 2019 and the C.C.S. also voted in favor of it over a month later. Pope Francis confirmed the cause on 19 March 2019 for Hossu and the other six prelates which allows for them to be beatified; it was celebrated in Blaj on 2 June 2019. There were reports that a papal visit to Romania was being planned for late 2018 and it referred to the fact that Pope Francis would preside over the beatification for Hossu and six others if and when he visits according to Archbishop Ioan Robu. The visit did not occur in 2018 but has been scheduled for mid-2019 which opened the door to Hossu's beatification during the papal visit in Blaj on 2 June during the Mass there. The current postulator for this joint beatification cause is Fr. Vasile Man. The current relator for the cause is the Conventual Franciscan friar Zdzis≈Çaw Kijas. On 25 March 2019, it was confirmed that Pope Francis would beatify Hossu and the other prelates on 2 June at Blaj Romania's Liberty Field.https://www.ncronline.org/news/vatican/pope-beatify-martyrs-visit- marian-shrine-trip-romania Francis beatified Hossu and the six other prelates as scheduled. ==Notes and referencesCatholic Hierarchy * Hagiography Circle Category:1885 births Category:1970 deaths Category:20th-century Christian martyrs Category:20th-century Eastern Catholic bishops Category:20th-century venerated Christians Category:Beatifications by Pope Francis Category:Eastern Catholic beatified people Category:Honorary members of the Romanian Academy Category:Inmates of Sighet prison Category:Members of the Senate of Romania Category:People from Bistri»õa-NƒÉsƒÉud County Category:People from the Kingdom of Hungary Category:Romanian anti- communist clergy Category:Romanian Austro-Hungarians Category:Romanian beatified people Category:Romanian bishops Category:Romanian cardinals Category:Romanian Greek-Catholic bishops Category:Representatives of the Alba Iulia National Assembly ","title":"Iuliu Hossu"},{"id":"3232789","text":"\\"Come Back to What You Know\\" is a song by English rock band Embrace, released as the 4th single from their debut album The Good Will Out on 25 May 1998.

The genes transcribed by RNA Pol III fall in the category of \\"housekeeping\\" genes whose expression is required in all cell types and most environmental conditions. Therefore, the regulation of Pol III transcription is primarily tied to the regulation of cell growth and the cell cycle, thus requiring fewer regulatory proteins than RNA polymerase II. Under stress conditions however, the protein Maf1 represses Pol III activity. Rapamycin is another Pol III inhibitor via its direct target TOR. == Transcription == The process of transcription (by any polymerase) involves three main stages: *Initiation, requiring construction of the RNA polymerase complex on the gene's promoter *Elongation, the synthesis of the RNA transcript *Termination, the finishing of RNA transcription and disassembly of the RNA polymerase complex ===Initiation=== Initiation: the construction of the polymerase complex on the promoter. Pol III is unusual (compared to Pol II) by requiring no control sequences upstream of the gene, instead normally relying on internal control sequences - sequences within the transcribed section of the gene (although upstream sequences are occasionally seen, e.g. U6 snRNA gene has an upstream TATA box as seen in Pol II Promoters). There are three classes of Pol III initiation, corresponding to 5S rRNA, tRNA, and U6 snRNA initiation. In all cases, the process starts with transcription factors binding to control sequences, and ends with TFIIIB (Transcription Factor for polymerase III B) being recruited to the complex and assembling Pol III. TFIIIB consists of three subunits: TATA binding protein (TBP), a TFIIB-related factor (BRF1, or BRF2 for transcription of a subset of Pol III-transcribed genes in vertebrates), and a B-double-prime (BDP1) unit. The overall architecture bears similarities to that of Pol II. ====Class I==== Typical stages in 5S rRNA (also termed class I) gene initiation: *TFIIIA (Transcription Factor for polymerase III A) binds to the intragenic (lying within the transcribed DNA sequence) 5S rRNA control sequence, the C Block (also termed box C). *TFIIIA serves as a platform that replaces the A and B Blocks for positioning TFIIIC in an orientation with respect to the start site of transcription that is equivalent to what is observed for tRNA genes. *Once TFIIIC is bound to the TFIIIA-DNA complex, the assembly of TFIIIB proceeds as described for tRNA transcription. ====Class II==== Typical stages in a tRNA (also termed class II) gene initiation: *TFIIIC (Transcription Factor for polymerase III C) binds to two intragenic (lying within the transcribed DNA sequence) control sequences, the A and B Blocks (also termed box A and box B). *TFIIIC acts as an assembly factor that positions TFIIIB to bind to DNA at a site centered approximately 26 base pairs upstream of the start site of transcription. *TFIIIB is the transcription factor that assembles Pol III at the start site of transcription. Once TFIIIB is bound to DNA, TFIIIC is no longer required. TFIIIB also plays an essential role in promoter opening. ====Class III==== Typical stages in a U6 snRNA (also termed class III) gene initiation (documented in vertebrates only): *SNAPc (SNRNA Activating Protein complex; subunits: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) (also termed PBP and PTF) binds to the PSE (Proximal Sequence Element) centered approximately 55 base pairs upstream of the start site of transcription. This assembly is greatly stimulated by the Pol II transcription factors Oct1 and STAF that bind to an enhancer-like DSE (Distal Sequence Element) at least 200 base pairs upstream of the start site of transcription. These factors and promoter elements are shared between Pol II and Pol III transcription of snRNA genes. *SNAPc acts to assemble TFIIIB at a TATA box centered 26 base pairs upstream of the start site of transcription. It is the presence of a TATA box that specifies that the snRNA gene is transcribed by Pol III rather than Pol II. *The TFIIIB for U6 snRNA transcription contains a smaller Brf1 paralogue, Brf2. *TFIIIB is the transcription factor that assembles Pol III at the start site of transcription. Sequence conservation predicts that TFIIIB containing Brf2 also plays a role in promoter opening. === Elongation === TFIIIB remains bound to DNA following initiation of transcription by Pol III (unlike bacterial œÉ factors and most of the basal transcription factors for Pol II transcription). This leads to a high rate of transcriptional reinitiation of Pol III-transcribed genes. ===Termination=== Polymerase III terminates transcription at small polyTs stretch (5-6). In eukaryotes, a hairpin loop is not required, but may enhance termination efficiency in humans. ==Transcribed RNAs== The types of RNAs transcribed from RNA polymerase III include: *Transfer RNAs *5S ribosomal RNA *U6 spliceosomal RNA *RNase P and RNase MRP RNA *7SL RNA (the RNA component of the signal recognition particle) *Vault RNAs *Y RNA *SINEs (short interspersed repetitive elements) *7SK RNA *Several microRNAs *Several small nucleolar RNAs *Several gene regulatory antisense RNAs ==See also== *RNA polymerase ==References== Category:Gene expression Category:Proteins ","title":"RNA polymerase III"},{"id":"3232821","text":"Filmer Stuart Cuckow Northrop (November 27, 1893 in Janesville, Wisconsin - July 21, 1992 in Exeter, New Hampshire) was an American philosopher. After receiving a B.A. from Beloit College in 1915, and an MA from Yale University in 1919, he went on to Harvard University where he earned another MA in 1922 and a Ph.D. in 1924.New York Times, July 23, 1992. Obituary Northrop was an influential comparative philosopher. His most influentialp.54, \\"Methodologies of Comparative Philosophy\\", 2009. Robert Smid. SUNY Press. work, The Meeting of East and West, was published in 1946 at the aftermath of World War II. Its central thesis is that East and West both must learn something from each other to avoid future conflict and to flourish together. He was appointed to the Yale faculty in 1923 as an instructor in Philosophy, and later was named professor in 1932. In 1947 he was appointed Sterling Professor of Philosophy and Law. He chaired the Philosophy department from 1938 to 1940 and was the first Master of Silliman College, from 1940 to 1947. Northrop was personally acquainted with and close to a great number of leading figures in philosophy, politics, and science. These included G. H. Hardy, Bertrand Russell, Ludwig Wittgenstein, Erwin Schroedinger, Hermann Weyl, Norbert Wiener, Mao Zedong, John Foster Dulles and Mohammed Iqbal, among many others. For instance, see the dedication to \\"Man, Nature, and God.\\" He was the author of twelve books and innumerable articles on all major branches of philosophy. Chapter-length studies of seven of these books can be found in Fred Seddon‚Äôs An Introduction to the Philosophical Works of F. S. C. Northrop. ==Ideas== Northrop‚Äôs major contribution to philosophy is in the area of epistemology, specifically his theory of concepts. He divides all concepts into two kinds: intuition and postulation. For Northrop, the source of the meaning of the concept is the source of its difference. This can be seen from the definitions of these concepts. A concept by intuition is one which denotes, and the complete meaning of which is given by something that is immediately apprehended. Northrop gives blue in \\"the sense of the sensed color\\" as an example of a concept by intuition. (The Logic of Science and Humanities, p. 82.) The other kind is concepts by postulation. A concept by postulation is one the meaning of which in whole or in part is designated by the postulates of the deductive theory in which it occurs. Blue in the sense of the frequency or wavelength in electromagnetic theory is a concept by postulation. (The Logic of the Sciences and the Humanities, p. 83.) According to Northrop, these two types of concepts exhaust the available concepts (i.e., providing terms with meanings) from which any scientific or philosophical theory can be constructed and therefore provides a means to do comparative philosophy, analyze and solve the problem of world peace, tame nations, provide a philosophical anthropology, explain why economists from Smith to Marx were incapable of providing a dynamics to supplement their statics, and to ground art and religion as well as legal and ethical theory. Northrop substantiates these claims in his The Logic of the Sciences and the Humanities. There remains one crucial notion: what is the relationship between postulation and intuition. For Northrop the relation is epistemic correlation. Northrop provides the following definition: (The Logic of the Sciences and the Humanities, p. 119.) The sensed color blue is related to theoretical color blue by an epistemic correlation. Note what this relation is not. It is not the relation of causality or identity. Concept-by- postulation blue does not cause concept-by-intuition blue. As Northrop reports in Science and First Principles, (pp. 251‚Äì252) concept-by-intuition blue is a multivalued relation. One relatum of concept-by-intuition blue is the angstrom number currently associated with concept by postulation blue. To assume that only one of the relata of a relation could cause that relation is as silly as assuming that the female (or the male) member of a marriage causes the marriage. Nor is the proper relation between postulation and intuition \\"identity\\", as can easily been seen using \\"blue\\". Concept-by-postulation blue is not identical with concept-by-intuition blue, but is just one among many relata that go to form this complex secondary quality. Neither identity nor causality is the proper relation between sensed blue and theoretic blue. Note that the problem is: \\"what is the epistemic correlate of one's directly inspected visual image?\\" The problem is not what is really real. Unlike (certain interpretations of) Plato and Plotinus, there is in Northrop no propensity to degrade or downgrade the world-as-it-is-sensed in favor of the world-as-known by concepts-by-postulation. To experience the visual image of blue is as epistemically valuable and irreducible as knowing blue postulationally. The two sources of all our knowledge give information that is both complementary and supplementary. Without concepts-by-intuition we could never know the world in its particularity. Without concepts-by-postulation we could never know the world in its universality and necessity. We now have enough information to give a name to Northrop's epistemology. He calls it \\"logical realism in epistemic correlation with radical empiricism.\\" In other words, reason (in the form of concepts-by-postulation) epistemically correlated with the senses (in the form of concepts-by-intuition). The consequences of this theory cannot be overestimated. It has ramifications for psychology, epistemology, religion, culture and philosophy. Not only will the world now come to be seen as something that can be known both by theory as well as by sense perception, but the knower can also be known by both methods. Humans are not only what the latest science has postulated them to be, but also what they sense themselves to be. One early claim by Northrop in Ch. 2 of \\"The Meeting of East and West\\" was that Eastern Thought in general (really most applicable to Chinese thought) deals with the world as an ‚Äúundifferentiated aesthetic continuum.‚Äù That is, reality is all connected and unified, not separated into distinct objects (undifferentiated continuum) and is in reality qualitative as perceived (aesthetic = perception, but later related to theory of art). Some Chinese have dismissed this as racist and simple-minded. Others have embraced it as a correct characterization. What Northrop contrasts with it in the west is an abstract, mathematical or formal conception of reality along with an atomistic conception of reality as fundamentally separate objects. Concepts are in the west ‚Äúby postulation,‚Äù while in the East ‚Äúby intuition.‚Äù ==Bibliography== *Science and First Principles, New York: The Macmillan Company, 1931.

The origin of the word \\"Kuki\\" is uncertain,it is an exonym: it was not originally as a self-designation by the tribes that are now called Kukis. According to the colonial British writer Adam Scott Reid, the earliest reference to the word Kuki can be dated to 1777 CE, when it first appeared in British records. Ancient Sanskrit legendary literature mentions the Kirata people, which have been identified with tribes such as the Kuki. According to CA Soppit, the \\"Old Kukis\\" migrated to Manipur in the early 11th century, while the \\"New Kukis\\" migrated to Manipur during the first half of the 19th century. ===Contact with outside world and resistance=== Long ignored by the outside world, an important landmark in the history of the Kuki people was the arrival of missionaries and the spread of Christianity among them. Missionary activity had considerable social, cultural and political ramifications while the acceptance of Christianity marked a departure from the tradition religion of the Kuki peoples as well as both the Kuki peoples' ancestral customs and traditions. The spread of English education introduced the Kuki people to the \\"modern era\\". William Pettigrew, the first foreign missionary, came to Manipur on 6 February 1894 and was sponsored by the American Baptist Mission Union. He, together with Dr. Crozier, worked together in the North and the Northeast of Manipur. In the south, Watkins Robert of the Welsh Presbytery mission organised the Indo-Burma Thadou-Kuki Pioneer Mission in 1913. To have a broader scope, the mission's name was changed to North East India General Mission (NEIGM).T. Haokip, 'Kuki Churches Unification Movements', Journal of North East India Studies, Vol. 2(1), 2012, p. 35. The first resistance to British hegemony by the Kuki people was the Kuki Rebellion of 1917‚Äì19 after which their territory was subjugated by the British and divided between the administrations of British India and British Burma.Burma and Assam Frontier, ‚ÄòKuki rising, 1917‚Äì1919‚Äô, L/PS/10/724, Oriental and India Office Collections (OIOC), British Library, London Up until their defeat in 1919, the Kukis had been an independent people ruled by their chieftains. The Dobashi, Lengjang Kuki was credited as responsible for preventing the Kukis of the Naga Hills from joining the Kuki Rebellion of Manipur. During World War II, seeing an opportunity to regain independence, the Kuki fought with the Imperial Japanese Army and the Indian National Army led by Subhas Chandra Bose but the success of the Allied forces over the Axis group dashed their hopes. ==Cultures and traditions== The land of the Kukis has a number of customs and traditions. ===Sawm=== Sawm, a community centre for boys ‚Äì was the centre of learning in which the Sawm-upa (an elder) did the teaching, while Sawm-nu took care of chores, such as combing of the boy's hair, washing of the garments and making the beds. The best students were recommended to the King's or the Chief's service, and eventually would achieve the office of Semang and Pachong (ministers) in their courts, or gal ‚Äìlamkai (leaders, warriors) in the army.Paokhohao Haokp, \\"Reinculcating Traditional Values of the Kukis with Special Reference to Lom and Som\\", in T. Haokip (ed.). The Kukis of Northeast India: Politics and Culture. New Delhi: Bookwell, 2013, Chapter 11. ===Lawm=== Lawm (a traditional type of youth club) was an institution in which boys and girls engaged in social activities for the benefit of the individual and the community. It was also another learning institution. Every Lawm has a Lawm-upa (a senior member), a To‚Äôllai-pao (an overseer or superintendent) and a Lawm- tangvo (assistant superintendent). Besides being a source of traditional learning, the institution of the Lawm also facilitated the transmission of both technical as well as practical knowledge to its members, especially with regard to particular methods of farming, hunting, fishing and sporting activities such as Kung‚ÄìKal (high jump, especially over a choice mithun), Ka‚Äông Ka‚Äôp, Ka‚Äôngchoi Ka‚Äôp (top game), Suhtumkhawh (javelin throw using the heavy wooden implement for pounding-de-husking-paddy) and So‚Äôngse (shot put). The Lawm was also a centre where young Kuki people learned discipline and social etiquette. After harvest season, the Lawm meet is celebrated with a Lawm-se‚Äôl and, as a commemoration, a pillar is erected. The event is accompanied by dance and drinking rice-beer, which sometimes continues for days and nights. ==Laws and government== ===Governance=== With regard to governance, Semang (cabinet) is the annual assembly of a Kuki village community held at the Chief's residence represents the Inpi (Assembly). In such an assembly, the Chief and his Semang and Pachong (cabinet members and auxiliary of Inpi) and all the household heads of the village congregate to discuss and resolve matters relating to the village and the community.T.

New Delhi: Bookwell, 2013, Chapter 1. ===Religions=== The Bnei Menashe (, \\"Sons of Menasseh\\") are a small group within the indigenous people of India's North-Eastern border states of Manipur and Mizoram; since the late 20th century, they claim descent from one of the Lost Tribes of Israel and have adopted the practice of Judaism.Weil, Shalva. \\"Double Conversion among the 'Children of Menasseh'\\" in Georg Pfeffer and Deepak K. Behera (eds) Contemporary Society Tribal Studies, New Delhi: Concept, pp. 84‚Äì102. 1996 Weil, Shalva. \\"Lost Israelites from North-East India: Re-Traditionalisation and Conversion among the Shinlung from the Indo- Burmese Borderlands\\", The Anthropologist, 2004. 6(3): 219‚Äì233. The Bnei Menashe are made up of Mizo, Kuki and Chin peoples, who all speak Tibeto- Burman languages, and whose ancestors migrated into northeast India from Burma mostly in the 17th and 18th centuries. They are called Chin in Burma. In the late 20th century, an Israeli rabbi investigating their claims named them Bnei Menashe, based on their account of descent from Menasseh. Most of the peoples in these two northeast states, who number more than 3.7 million, do not identify with these claims. Some have supported other movements to separate from India. Prior to conversion in the 19th century to Christianity by Welsh Baptist missionaries, the Chin, Kuki, and Mizo peoples were animists; among their practices were ritual headhunting. Since the late 20th century, some of these peoples have begun following Messianic Judaism. The Bnei Menashe are a small group who started studying and practicing Judaism since the 1970s in a desire to return to what they believe is the religion of ancestors. The Bnei Menashe number below 9,000; several hundred have emigrated to Israel. The majority of Kukis are now Christians, with most belonging to Protestant denominations, especially Baptist.Chin Cultural Profile ==Notable people== * Gokhothang, Prince from Mualpi. * Laldenga, MNF Leader * Henry Van Thio, Burmese politician. * Thangkhopao Kipgen, IAS. *Zoramthanga, Burmese Indian boxer,first indian to win medal at Boxing World Cup. ==See also== * Zale'n-gam ==References== ==External links== Category:Ethnic groups in Bangladesh Category:Ethnic groups in Manipur Category:Ethnic groups in Tripura Category:Ethnic groups in Myanmar Category:Tribes of Assam Category:Kuki tribes Category:Headhunting Category:Scheduled Tribes of Nagaland Category:Scheduled Tribes of Assam Category:Scheduled Tribes of Mizoram Category:Scheduled Tribes of Meghalaya Category:Ethnic groups in Northeast India Category:Ethnic groups in South Asia ","title":"Kuki people"},{"id":"3232825","text":"Varnava Rosiƒá () was the Patriarch of the Serbian Orthodox Church from 1930 to 1937. He was born Petar Rosiƒá in Pljevlja, belonging at that time to the Ottoman Empire, on August 29, 1880. ==Life== Since Metropolitan Parthenios of Debar and Veles (1907-1913) was frequently absent from his eparchy serving as a member of Holy Synod in Constantinople, it was decided that an auxiliary bishop should be appointed for administration of the eparchy. By that time, Varnava Rosiƒá was serving as a Serbian Orthodox priest in Constantinople and he was chosen and consecrated as bishop on 10 April 1910 in the Patriarchal Church of Saint George. As an auxiliary bishop serving in the Eparchy of Debar and Veles, he welcomed the liberation of that region from Turkish rule in 1912 and annexation to the Kingdom of Serbia. Metropolitan Parthenios was finally transferred to another eparchy in 1913, and bishop Varnava was left in charge not only in the Eparchy of Debar and Veles, since administration of other ecclesiastical territories annexed to Kingdom of Serbia was also entrusted to him. During First World War, upon the Bulgarian occupation of southern parts of Kingdom of Serbia in 1915, he had to leave his eparchy, returning after liberation in 1918. In 1920, he was elected Metropolitan of Skopje, and served in that eparchy until 1930, when he became new Serbian Patriarch. During the office of Varnava, the dioceses of Zagreb and Mukacheve were formed. Between 1931 and 1937, the Serbian Church consisted of 27 dioceses and a vicarate in Skadar, Albania. Church life was on the move in all regions. Many monasteries, churches and church buildings were erected, some of these being the present Patriarchate building in Belgrade, Vavedenje Monastery, etc. The construction of the edifice of the great Temple of Saint Sava was initiated in Belgrade (one of the largest churches in the world). Varnava firmly resisted the introduction of legislation giving greater privileges to the Roman Catholic Church not in Yugoslavia in general, but in Serbia in particular (hence The Concordat Crisis). He maintained that these would certainly undermine positions of both the Serbian Orthodox church and those of other faiths in the country. He died unexpectedly during the night between July 23-24, 1937 when the Concordat legislation was carried into Parliament. The Holy Synod was also against government pro-Concordat policy, and the government was soon forced to withdraw this new legislation. Many people believed that Patriarch Varnava was poisoned because of his struggle against Concordat, and his death is still unresolved. He was the great-uncle of performance artist Marina Abramoviƒá. Patriarch Varnava was awarded Order of the White Eagle and a number of other decorations. ==References== ==Sources== * * * ==External links== * Prayerful remembrance of Patriarch Varnava Rosiƒá * Category:1880 births Category:1937 deaths Category:People from Pljevlja Varnava I Category:Serbian Orthodox metropolitans of Skopje Category:20th-century Eastern Orthodox bishops Category:Serbs of Montenegro Category:Recipients of the Order of the White Eagle (Serbia) ","title":"Varnava, Serbian Patriarch"},{"id":"3232844","text":"WTLC-AM is an AM radio station owned by Radio One in Indianapolis, Indiana. The station operates on the AM radio frequency of 1310 kHz. The studios are located downtown at the corner of Meridian and St. Joseph Streets. The transmitter and antenna, according to the FCC, are located on the south side of Indianapolis between Troy and Sumner Avenues near the Indiana Railroad (the same block as WTTV's former studios). ==History== WTLC began operation in 1941 as WISH. It was put on the air by engineer and pioneer radio broadcaster Russ Salter. In 1947, principal owner C. Bruce McConnell sold WISH to Frank H. McKinney and associates for a \\"stripped price of approximately $500,000.\\" The owners of WISH radio also started a television station with the same call letters on Channel 8 in Indianapolis. In late 1963 the radio station, along with its sister FM operation, was sold to STAR Broadcasting (Don W. Burden) who changed the call letters to WIFE and WIFE-FM. WIFE was the ratings leader during the mid and late sixties, sometime garnering as much of a forty share of the Indianapolis radio audience. The station built this audience for \\"Lucky 13\\" by playing contemporary hit music (i.e., Rock'n'Roll) along with heavy and frequent contesting such as, \\"The 100 Thousand Dollar Dream Home\\", \\"The 100 Thousand Dollar Cash and Car Give-A-Way\\", just to name a few. The hands-on owner, Don W. Burden, hired some major on-air personalities and developed others, dubbed the \\"WIFE Good Guys\\" - Big Jack Armstrong, Roger W. Morgan, Reb Porter, Jay Reynolds, Joe Light, Jay Hawkins, Buddy Scott, Jim Fox, T.J. Byers, Scott Wheeler, Mike O'Brien, Dan Summers, Steve Miller. The 24-hour news department was home of news announcers Lyle Dean, Bob Schuman, Dean Sheppard and Paul Casey. During these years, the station was infamous for a billboard near Indianapolis' Weir Cook Airport (now Indianapolis International Airport) which told passing motorists, \\"While you're away, we'll be here with your WIFE\\". After Burden later ran afoul of the FCC, Star Stations of Indiana was denied its license renewal application for WIFE in 1976. The station was ordered off the air, forcing a sale to new ownership and management. An era of frequent call letter changes (WMLF, WTUX, WTLC) and formats (Music of Your Life, Adult Standards, and Urban Oldies) began in 1984 and continued into the 1990s.https://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1990s/1992/RR-1992-09-04.pdf In late 1997, then-owner Panache sold the frequency to Emmis Communications and the new owners settled on Urban Gospel. For a two-year period the majority of programming was syndicated from Sheridan Broadcasting and branded as \\"The Light\\". In January 2001, the station was purchased from Emmis by Radio One. Shortly thereafter the affiliation with Sheridan was dropped but the station retained the name \\"The Light\\". ==Station broadcasting information== WTLC broadcasts using 5 kW of daytime power and 1 kW between sunset and sunrise. With a directional antenna at night, the broadcast signal focuses more to the north-northeast, west-northwest, and east-southeast. More information can be found at the WTLC query on the FCC website. ==Programming== WTLC is a contemporary gospel station. ==References== ==External links== *Indiana Radio Archive, WTLC *1310 The Light website *FCC History Cards for WTLC TLC Category:Urban One stations Category:Mass media in Indianapolis Category:Radio stations established in 1982 Category:Gospel radio stations in the United States Category:1982 establishments in Indiana TLC ","title":"WTLC (AM)"},{"id":"3232855","text":"Xana or XANA may refer to: * Xana, an Asturian mythical entity * XANA (Code Lyoko), XANA or X.A.N.A., a digital entity antagonist in the television series Code Lyoko and its sequel Code Lyoko: Evolution * Xana Antunes (1964 2020), British business journalist * Khana Qubadi (Xana Qubad√Æ in Kurdish) ","title":"Xana (disambiguation)"},{"id":"3232859","text":"Charles Wanyoike Rubia (1923 ‚Äì 23 December 2019) was the first native African mayor of Nairobi.

His name is lent to the Laporte rule in spectroscopy and to the Otto Laporte Award of the American Physical Society.Laporte Award recipients , retrieved August 22, 2008. ==Education== Laporte‚Äôs ancestors came from French Huguenot families who fled to Switzerland in the 17th century. His father was an officer in the military. Before World War I, they were stationed in the fortified cities of Mainz (where Laporte was born), Cologne, and Metz, in which he received his early education. After the war started, they returned to Mainz.Laporte ‚Äì National Academy of Sciences Press In the spring of 1920, the family moved to Frankfurt, staying just one year, where Laporte attended the University of Frankfurt. There, he was influenced by the mathematicians Arthur Schoenflies, Ludwig Bieberbach, and Ernst Hellinger, and the physicists Max Born, and Alfred Land√©. In the summer of 1921, the Laporte family moved to Munich, where Laporte became a student of Arnold Sommerfeld at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich (LMU). Max Born had sent an enthusiastic recommendation of Laporte to Sommerfeld. At that time, Wolfgang Pauli was an assistant to Sommerfeld and Sommerfeld‚Äôs students included Werner Heisenberg, Gregor Wentzel, Karl Herzfeld, and Paul Peter Ewald - all of whom would go on to become famous physicists in their own right. Laporte‚Äôs first independent research was on the diffraction of electromagnetic waves around a spherical bodyOtto Laporte Annalen der Physik 70 (8) 595-616 (1923) and this was the basis for his doctoral thesis under Sommerfeld. His doctorate was granted in 1924. While at LMU, he also analyzed various spectra and made a contribution to understanding atomic structure.Otto Laporte Multipletts im Spektrum des Vanadiums, Naturwiss. 11 779-782 (1923), as cited in Mehra, Volume 1, Part 2, p. 802.Otto Laporte √úber die Anordnung der Vanadiumlinien in Multipletts, Phys.

Through these research efforts, he discovered what is known in spectroscopy as the Laporte rule. ==Life and work== When Sommerfeld was a visiting professor in the United States, he learned about the International Education Board fellowships set up through the Rockefeller Foundation. Sommerfeld heartily recommended Laporte for a fellowship, which was granted to him for two years starting in 1924. Laporte used the fellowship to do postdoctoral studies and research at the National Bureau of Standards in Washington, D.C.. There, he was influenced by William F. Meggers, Gregory Breit, Merle A. Tuve, Paul D. Foote, F. L. Mohler, Arthur Ruark, and Harold Urey. After his fellowship, Laporte was invited, in 1926, to the University of Michigan by Harrison M. Randall, chairman of the physics department. Laporte served as an instructor for one year and then was promoted to assistant professor. It was the intention of Randall to build up the theoretical physics capabilities at Michigan, so in 1927 Laporte was joined by George Eugene Uhlenbeck, Samuel Abraham Goudsmit, and David M. Dennison, who remained at Michigan for many years. In 1928, Laporte was invited as a guest lecturer at the Imperial University of Kyoto. While in Japan, he got an urgent message from Sommerfeld, who was going to the United States and wanted Laporte to lecture in his place at LMU. Laporte had to cut his visit short and make a two-week, non-stop trip via the Trans-Siberian Railway in order to arrive in Munich in time. His next visits to Japan were as a lecturer at the University of Tokyo, on leave from Michigan, in 1933 and 1937; during these periods, he learned to speak Japanese and understand their culture. In between these visits, in 1935, he became a naturalized citizen of the United States. From 1954 to 1955, and again from 1961 to 1963, he was a scientific advisor to the American Ambassador in Tokyo. His activities resulted in a landmark atomic energy agreement between the United States and Japan, and he was cited by the U.S. State Department for his key contributions. Between his foreign services in Japan, he served the United States in Germany. From 1949 to 1950, Laporte was an intelligence analyst for the U.S. Army of Occupation in Heidelberg. It was in 1944 that Laporte added a new area to his professional activities ‚Äì fluid dynamics, which includes the sub-field of hydrodynamics. That year, he published a paper giving an exact solution to the problem of the lift of an airfoil of elliptical outline. Two years later, he conducted experiments in fluid dynamics with an advanced design shock tube facility put together under Lincoln Smith at Michigan. When Smith left in 1946, Laporte took over the facility. The shock tube allowed him to make spectroscopic measurements in new regions through the shock heating of gases. The addition of fluid dynamics to his research activities was in reality a convergence of a number of his professional interests in quantum mechanics and spectroscopy. And his time at LMU influenced this, as Sommerfeld had done work in hydrodynamics and Heisenberg‚Äôs doctoral thesis was on hydrodynamics. Laporte was one of the charter members of the American Physical Society‚Äôs Division of Fluid Dynamics, and he served as the division's chairman in 1965. Laporte had a number of hobbies, which included playing the piano and horticulture, specializing in plants of the cactus and the euphorbia families. Otto Laporte died in 1971 in Ann Arbor, Michigan of stomach cancer leaving Adele Laporte (wife), Irene Laporte, Claire Laporte, and Marianne Laporte (daughters). ==Honors== *1971 - First person posthumously elected to the National Academy of Sciences *1972 - American Physical Society, Division of Fluid Dynamics, established the Otto Laporte Memorial Lectureship (which in 1985 was changed into the Otto Laporte Award) ==Books== *Otto Laporte Theorie der Multiplettspektren Offprint from Walter Grotrian et al., Grundlagen der Astrophysik Vol. 3, Part 2 (Springer, 1930) *Otto Laporte and R.

It covers an area of 21.5 acres (8.6 ha) and its species-rich grassland is particularly ecologically important as this type of habitat represents only 0.15% of the total land area of Cheshire. Common spotted orchid and marsh orchid thrive in the wet flushes of this highly variable grassland.

Galley) is a Serbian and former Yugoslav rock band from Ni≈°. The central figures of the band are brothers Nenad Milosavljeviƒá (vocals, acoustic guitar and harmonica) and Predrag Milosavljeviƒá (vocals). Galija was formed in 1976, and its first several releases were progressive rock-oriented, but in the mid-1980s, the band moved towards more mainstream-oriented sound. In the late 1980s, the band started to cooperate with lyricist Radoman Kanjevac, releasing the album trilogy consisting of Daleko je Sunce (1988), Korak do slobode (1989) and Istorija, ti i ja, with which they achieved huge mainstream popularity. The band managed to sustain their popularity throughout the 1990s, but went on a hiatus at the end of the decade. Since the return to the scene in the mid-2000s, the band remains one of the top mainstream acts of the Serbian rock scene. ==Band history== ===1976 ‚Äì 1984: progressive rock years=== Galija frontman Nenad Milosavljeviƒá started performing as singer- songwriter while still in his teenage years. Influenced by Hippie movement, he performed his songs playing acoustic guitar and harmonica. He had his first public appearance 1975, on the Evening of Poetry and Music at the Ni≈° Film Festival, performing his own songs and songs by Jos√© Feliciano. In 1976, he performed at the Festival Omladina in Subotica and Belgrade Spring Festival. He composed music for the amateur theatre Treƒáa polovina (Third Half). On 11 April 1977 he held a concert in the National Theatre in Ni≈°, on which he was accompanied by the members of the band Dva Lustera (Two Chandeliers). After the concert, Nenad Milosavljeviƒá and Dva Lustera members agreed to start working together as a band. The first lineup of Galija featured Nenad Milosavljeviƒá (guitar and vocals), Goran Ljubisavljeviƒá (guitar), Predrag Brankoviƒá (bass guitar), Nenad Tanƒçiƒá (drums) and Branislav Stamenkoviƒá (keyboards). The band was named Galija after the famous kafana in Ni≈°. Tanƒçiƒá soon left the band due to his army obligations, and was replaced by Boban Pavloviƒá, who would, during the following years, remain one of the rare permanent members of the band. In 1978, with the new keyboard player, Zoran Stankoviƒá, Galija won the first place at the Gitarijada Festival in Zajeƒçar. At that time they used to appear on stage in 18th century uniforms. Several months after Gitarijada, they performed at the Festival Omladina in Subotica with Ljubodrag Vukadinoviƒá playing the keyboards. During 1978, they performed as the opening band on Smak tour, at the end of the year they performed at the BOOM Festival in Novi Sad. In 1979, the band released their debut album Prva plovidba (The First Sail) to mixed reviews by the critics. Nenad Milosvaljeviƒá's brother Predrag Milosavljeviƒá appeared on the album on vocals as a guest musician, and also wrote most of the album lyrics. The album brought hits \\"Avanturista\\" (\\"Adventurer\\"), \\"Gospi\\" (\\"To the Lady\\") and \\"Decimen\\". After the band's performance at Bijelo Dugme's rock spectacle on JNA Stadium, on which they performed alongside Bijelo Dugme, Kako, Mama Rock, Formula 4, Aerodrom, Opus, Senad od Bosne, Boomerang, Prva Ljubav, Prljavo Kazali≈°te, Toma≈æ Domicelj, Metak, Suncokret, Parni Valjak, Generacija 5, Siluete and other acts, Ljubisavljeviƒá, Brankoviƒá and Vukadinoviƒá left the band. The bass guitarist Zoran Radosavljeviƒá, the guitarist Du≈°an Radivojeviƒá and the keyboardist Neboj≈°a Markoviƒá became the band's new members. In 1980, the band released their second album, Druga plovidba (The Second Sail). The album was produced by Gordi guitarist Zlatko Manojloviƒá. The songs were composed by Nenad, and the lyrics were written by Predrag Milosavljeviƒá. Druga plovidba was the first Galija album to feature Predrag Milosavljeviƒá as the official band member. During the same year, the band performed at the Split festival, playing at Poljud Stadium with Azra, Metak, Drago Mlinarec, Generacija 5, Senad od Bosne, Aerodrom, Dado Topiƒá and other acts. During this period, Galija achieved huge success with the audience in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and until the beginning of Yugoslav wars the band had the biggest fanbase in Bosnia. Boban Stamenkoviƒá left the band in 1980, and was replaced by Zoran Stamenkoviƒá. During that summer, they performed in Makarska, and during the following years they would continue to hold regular concerts in the town. In 1981, the band performed, alongside Pomaranƒça, Tunel, Radomir Mihajloviƒá Toƒçak Trio, Piloti, Bulevar, Siluete and other acts, at the Belrade Rock Festival in Pionir Hall. In 1982, the album Ipak verujem u sebe (Nevertheless, I Believe in Myself) was released, bringing hits \\"Jo≈° uvek sanjam\\" (\\"I'm Still Dreaming\\") and \\"Burna pijana noƒá\\" (\\"Stormy Drunken Night\\"). At the beginning of 1982, Boban Pavloviƒá returned to the band. In 1983, Galija performed as the opening band at Joe Cocker's concert in Pionir Hall in Belgrade, and on 10 June 1983 they held a big concert at Belgrade's Ta≈°majdan Stadium with Potop and Kerber as the opening bands. Potop leader, keyboardist Sa≈°a Lokner, soon became a member of Galija. ===1984 ‚Äì 1988: shift to mainstream rock=== In October 1983, Galija recorded their fourth studio album Bez naglih skokova (Without Bounces). The album, released in 1984, was recorded in Manchester and was produced by Nightwing bass guitarist Gordon Rowley (who previously worked with another band from Ni≈°, Kerber), and mixed in California. The material was offered to record label Jugoton, but the label refused the material, so the band once again signed with PGP-RTB. Unlike the band's previous releases, Bez naglih skokova did not bring any hits. After the album release, the band performed, together with Bajaga i Instruktori, Laboratorija Zvuka and Leb i Sol, on a fundraising concert in Sarajevo, dedicated to the victims of the 1983 Kopaonik earthquake. At the end of 1984, Galija were voted \\"The Best Live Act on the Shore\\" by Split youth. During the year, the band started to hold regular concerts in Music Club 81 in Ni≈°, on which they performed covers of foreign rock hits. During the same year, Lokner joined Bajaga i Instruktori, and was replaced by Aleksandar Ralev. Jean- Jacques Roscam, a Belgian of Zaire origin, a former Peƒëa D'Boy Band member, soon joined Galija as the lead guitarist. In 1986, the band released album Digni ruku (Raise Your Hand), with the title track becoming a hit. The band wanted the album cover to feature a provocative image of the Hero of Socialist Labour Alija Sirotanoviƒá with a blindfold, which the record label refused. The album featured Roscam's song \\"Winter's Coming\\", with lyrics written by Dani Klein, the singer of the Belgian band Vaya Con Dios. ===1988 ‚Äì 1994: cooperation with Radoman Kanjevac and album trilogy=== Galija in the late 1980s In the late 1980s, the band was joined by the keyboard and flute player Bratislav \\"Bata\\" Zlatkoviƒá, who graduated from Sarajevo Music Academy, and started to work with the lyricist Radoman Kanjevac, the two bringing new ideas. Kanjevac brought up an idea of releasing an album trilogy which would deal with problems of SFR Yugoslavia in transition, and Zlatkoviƒá introduced folk music influences into Galija's sound. The album Daleko je Sunce (Distant is the Sun), named after Dobrica ƒÜosiƒá's novel, featured numerous guest musicians: Kornelije Kovaƒç, Sa≈°a Lokner, Nenad Stefanoviƒá \\"Japanac\\", Ivan Vdoviƒá, Fejat Sejdiƒá Trumpet Orchestra and others. Songs were named after the works of writers Dobrica ƒÜosiƒá, Branko ƒÜopiƒá, Ivo Andriƒá, Laza Lazareviƒá and Aleksa ≈†antiƒá. The album's biggest hits were the ballad \\"Da li si spavala\\" (\\"Did You Sleep\\") and the folk-oriented \\"Mi znamo sudbu\\" (\\"We Know the Destiny\\"). The other hits included \\"Intimni odnosi\\" (\\"Intimate Relationship\\"), \\"Orlovi rano lete\\" (\\"Eagles Start Flying Early \\") and \\"Kao i obiƒçno\\" (\\"Like Usual\\"). The song \\"Zebre i bizoni\\" (\\"Zebras and Buffalos\\") was dealing with the enigma of Josip Broz Tito's residence at Brijuni. As the record label considered the song politically problematic, \\"Zebre i bizoni\\" lyrics were not printed on the inner sleeve. Due to lyrics perceived as politically provocative, the editors of Radio Belgrade and Radio Zagreb marked two songs from Daleko je sunce unsuitable for broadcasting, while the editors of Radio Sarajevo decided not to broadcast four songs from the album. After Daleko je Sunce was released, Zoran Radosavljeviƒá left the band, and was replaced by Predrag Milanoviƒá. The second part of the trilogy, Korak do slobode (One Step to Freedom) was released in 1989. The album was produced by Sa≈°a Habiƒá. While Daleko je sunce lyrics were written by both Kanjevac and Predrag Milosavljeviƒá, the lyrics for Korak do slobode were written by Kanjevac only. The song \\"Sloboda\\" (\\"Freedom\\") featured Kerber frontman Goran ≈†epa on vocals. The album hits included \\"Na tvojim usnama\\" (\\"On Your Lips\\"), \\"Kopaonik\\", \\"Korak do slobode\\" and \\"Kad me pogleda≈°\\" (\\"When You Look at Me\\"). Roscam's reggae song \\"Ljubavna pesma\\" (\\"Love Song\\") had ironic lyrics dealing with the growing nationalism in Yugoslavia. During the same year, Nenad Milosavljeviƒá won the Composer of the Year Award at MESAM festival, although Zlatkoviƒá was the band's main author. The new bass guitarist Du≈°an Karad≈æiƒá soon joined Galija. The band promoted the album with a concert in Du≈°anova Street in Ni≈° in front of some 20,000 people. At the beginning of 1990, Galija, alongside Riblja ƒåorba, Valentino, Viktorija and Bajaga i Instruktori, performed in Timi»ôoara, Romania, at the three-day concerts organized two months after the Romanian Revolution. All five acts performed on three concerts in Timi»ôoara Olympia Hall in front of some 20,000 people each night. During the same year, the compilation album Jo≈° uvek sanjam (Najveƒái hitovi) (I'm Still Dreaming (Greatest Hits)) was released, with some of the old songs re-recorded. At the time of the first multi-party elections in Yugoslavia, Galija, after the idea of Kanjevac and journalist Petar \\"Peca\\" Popoviƒá, recorded an EP with songs \\"On je isti kao on\\" (\\"He Is just Like Him\\", which compared Josip Broz Tito and Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá), \\"Ti si moja jedina partija\\" (\\"You Are My Only Party\\"), \\"Posle svega\\" (\\"After Everything\\") and \\"Komunista\\" (\\"Communist\\", which featured Romani musician ≈†aban Bajramoviƒá on vocals). The EP featured provocative lyrics dealing with the uncertain future of the country, and was, because of the political censorship, never released. With the album Istorija, ti i ja (History, You and Me), released in 1991, the trilogy was complete. The album was produced by Valentino member Nik≈°a Brato≈° and featured Sa≈°a Lokner, Slavi≈°a Pavloviƒá, flutist Bora Dugiƒá and the group Renesans as guests. Istorija, ti i ja featured some of the band's biggest hits: \\"Skadarska\\" (\\"Skadarska Street\\"), \\"Trube\\" (\\"Trumpets\\"), \\"Da me nisi\\" (\\"If You Haven't\\"), \\"Trava\\" (\\"Grass\\") and \\"Seti se maja\\" (\\"Remember May\\"). Soon after the album release, Roscam left Yugoslavia because of the growing tensions in the country. and Dragutin Jakovljeviƒá replaced him in Galija. In June, Galija was the opening band on Bob Dylan's concert in Zemun. The band, in the new lineup, released the compilation album Ni rat ni mir (Odlomci iz trilogije) (Neither War nor Peace (Passages from the Trilogy)), which consisted of songs from the trilogy, and two new songs \\"Pravo slavlje\\" (\\"Real Celebration\\", also a word play, as \\"Pravoslavlje\\" means \\"Orthodoxy\\") and \\"Na Drini ƒáuprija\\" (\\"The Bridge on the Drina\\"). The 7\\" single with these two songs was given as a present to the members of the audience on their concert in Sava Centar, which featured Fejat Sejdiƒá Trumpet Orchestra, St. George Choir and pianist Milo≈° Petroviƒá as guests. A year later, they held another concert in Sava Centar, as a part of celebration of the publishing house Srpska knji≈æevna zadruga hundred years of existence. For this occasion, they recorded another gift-single, entitled Jednom u sto godina (Once in a Hundred Years), with a cover of Film song \\"Mi nismo sami\\" (\\"We Are Not Alone\\") and a cover of Indexi song \\"Sanjam\\" (\\"I'm Dreaming\\"), the latter cover featuring a recording of Ivo Andriƒá's voice. At the beginning of 1993, Zlatkoviƒá left the band. Oliver Jezdiƒá became the new keyboard player, and Bratislav Milo≈°eviƒá became the new bass guitarist. The double album, Karavan (Caravan), was recorded in Cyprus and produced by Sa≈°a Habiƒá. Part of the album lyrics were written by Kanjevac, and part by Predrag Milosavljeviƒá. The album featured Generacija 5 guitarist Dragan Jovanoviƒá on acoutic guitar as guest. The album featured a cover of traditional song \\"Petlovi\\" (\\"Roosters\\"). With Karavan Kanjevac ended his cooperation with the band. ===1994 ‚Äì 2000: after Kanjevac, without Predrag Milosavljeviƒá and hiatus=== During the summer of 1994, Karavan was promoted with a large number of free concerts, one of them being a concert in the park outside Belgrade's Old Palace. At the time, Galija started to promote the Socialist Party of Serbia, which has provoked a part of the critics and fans, who have proclaimed Galija a \\"state's band\\". In 1996, the album Trinaest (Thirteen) was released. Alongside Predrag Milosavljeviƒá's lyrics, Trinaest songs featured lyrics from Branko Radiƒçeviƒá, Stevan Raiƒçkoviƒá and Petar Pajiƒá's poems. During the next year, the band released the compilation album Veƒçita plovidba (Eternal Sail), and the studio album Voleti voleti (To Love to Love), which featured the hit \\"Kotor\\". The recording of the concert they held in ƒåair Hall in Ni≈° on 8 March 1998 was released on the live album Ja jesam odavde (I Am From Here).

It is almost entirely located within the Ancash Region. The range extends over an area about 230 km long and 25‚Äì40 km wide, stretching in a NNW-SSE direction parallel to the Pacific coast, its ridge is about 60 km from the coastline. It is part of the Andes mountain range which inland borders on the Costa, the narrow strip of coastal deserts along the South American coast. In the north and east the range is bordered by the Santa River which crosses the coastal ridge at 8¬∞ 45' S and runs parallel to the Cordillera Negra for almost all its length. In the south the range is bordered by the Patiwillka River at 10¬∞ 30'. In the central part of the range near Huar√°z, Casma River breaks through the ridge of the range. The Cordillera Negra has rocky peaks with very little winter snowfall. The gullies of the Cordillera Negra are gloomy and dark. Most of them are dry or their flow is scarce. The Santa River separates the Cordillera Negra from the Cordillera Blanca, a snow-covered range rising up to 6,768 m in the east almost parallel to it. Most of the year it has no snow although it rises up to 5,181 m in its highest parts. It intercepts the warmth from the Pacific Ocean, causing the line of perpetual snow sinking as low as 5,100 m in the Cordillera Blanca. Today the Cordillera Negra is sparsely inhabited by a mainly indigenous population growing wheat, maize and oats at an elevation of well above 4,000 m. The range is rich in mineral resources like gold, silver and copper. == Mountains == The highest mountain in the range is Qu√±uqranra at .

The highway begins with a paved path that arrives up to Yaut√°n. Then it quickly begins to ascend through an unpaved path by the sides of the Cordillera Negra, following the course of the Casma River. This route becomes more steep once it arrives to Pariacoto. Along the road, there are not important towns at all, except for Pira that offers some traveler's services. This route, extremely steep and narrow, goes between big abysses and gullies. It can be seen small rural districts with chakras (smallholdings) that have been sown with potatoes, wheat, barley and other food products. It can also be seen livestock and a lot of human activity. ==Guitarrero Cave== In the 1960s, the Guitarrero Cave was discovered on the northern edges of Cordillera Negra, a cave containing bones of mastodon and llama and suggesting human occupation as far back as 10,950 to 10,230 BC. == References == *This article mainly uses a wide variety of maps as sources.

His mother, Aloysia Evans, moved Tony and his older sister Nancy to southern California for the warmer climate. While Tony was a teenager, his mother remarried, to Oscar LeVier, who gave the children his name. From an early age, Tony LeVier had been much more interested in flying than his studies, so he dropped out of high school to pursue flying full-time. He worked odd jobs to pay for food and flying, mostly maintaining airplanes or flight instructing. == Air racing == In 1936, he began to try his hand at air racing, starting with the national air races in Los Angeles. In 1938 he flew, for the first time, a Keith Rider racer dubbed The Firecracker, owned by air racing enthusiast Bill Schoenfeldt. In this plane, he won the Greve Trophy in Cleveland that year. His landing after that flight was rough and damaged the aircraft too heavily to allow him to compete for the Thompson Trophy the next day. A year later, he was back in Cleveland, and this time placed second in the Thompson race. == Postwar air racing == After the end of World War II, LeVier bought a war surplus P-38 Lightning for $1,250 in Kingman, Arizona. He modified it for air racing and painted it bright red. He competed at the national air races in Cleveland in 1946 and won second place in the Thompson Trophy. == Mechanic and airline pilot == After the 1939 races, LeVier got his first formal job, working as a mechanic for the Douglas Aircraft Company, hoping to get promoted to test pilot. However, frustrated by his chances with that company, he earned an instrument rating and went to work for Mid-Continent Airlines in Kansas City. Six months later, though, he left that job also, to work with General Motors testing engines for Cessna aircraft in Wichita. When a job opened for him at the Lockheed Corporation in Burbank, California, he left Wichita and returned to southern California. == Lockheed career == LeVier started at Lockheed ferrying Hudson bombers to Canada for delivery to the Royal Air Force. He later trained and checked out pilots in the Hudson and its transport variant, the Lodestar. His job description was changed to engineering test pilot in 1942 to fly the PV-1 Ventura. His test flying was instrumental in proving the Lockheed P-38 Lightning design. He and chief engineering test pilot Milo Burcham alternated flying dive tests to observe the design's performance at transonic speeds. To demonstrate the reliability of the design in the hands of a skilled pilot, he performed aerobatic shows for students at the Polaris Flight school at War Eagle Field in nearby Lancaster. In 1944, LeVier visited Eighth Air Force air bases in Great Britain to demonstrate the engine-out reliability of the P-38.Caidin, Martin. Fork-Tailed Devil. Ballantine, 1968 He left England less than a week before the invasion of Normandy. == P-80 Shooting Star == When he returned to the United States, testing of the P-80 Shooting Star jet fighter was underway. He had made the first flight of the XP-80A in January, and the testing program continued through 1944 and into 1945. In October 1944, Milo Burcham was killed in the crash of a production P-80, and Tony LeVier filled his office as chief engineering test pilot in January 1945. Just two months into his career as head of this department, he suffered a serious crash on March 20, 1945, when his P-80 lost its tail due to a faulty turbine blade. Upon landing, he broke his back and had to wear a brace during his recovery, but six months after his crash, he was back in the air. He tested two evolutions of the P-80: the T-33 and the three variants of the F-94 Starfire. He also performed most of the tests of the XF-90 penetration fighter prototype. He also flew the first flights of the XF-104 Starfighter, and the U-2. He was succeeded as chief engineering test pilot at Lockheed by Herman \\"Fish\\" Salmon. He died at the age of 84 on February 6, 1998 from complications of cancer and kidney failure, after surviving eight crashes and one mid-air collision. == Awards == * Aviation Week & Space Technology Flight Safety Award, 1971. * National Aviation Hall of Fame inductee, 1978. * National Aeronautic Association Elder Statesman Award, 1986. * National Aviation Club Clifford Henderson Award for Achievement, 1986. *Aerospace Walk of Honor inductee, 1990. * Society of Experimental Test Pilots James H.

A relative of his predecessor Authari, Agilulf was selected king on the advice of the Christian queen and widow of Authari, Theodelinda, whom he then married. Although he assumed the royal dignity at the beginning of November 590, he was raised on the shield‚Äîthe ceremonial investment of his title‚Äîby Lombard warriors in Milan in May 591.Paul the Deacon, History of the Lombards 3.35; translated by William Dudley Foulke, 1907 (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania, 1974), pp.148-150 He was baptized to appease his wife and his nation followed suit, though they adopted the Arian heresy, not the Roman faith. In 603, under the influence of his wife, he abandoned Arianism for Catholicism, and had his son Adaloald baptised. He and his wife built and endowed the cathedral of Monza, where the Iron Crown of Lombardy is still preserved and where Agilulf's crown, dedicated to St John, existed (now lost) bearing the inscription rex totius Italiae, meaning \\"king of all Italy\\", as Agilulf evidently saw himself. His long reign was marked by the cessation of war with Francia, whose chief peacemaker Guntram, king of Burgundy, had died in 592. Without him, the Franks descended into civil war which prevented a united assault on Lombardy throughout Agilulf's rule. A truce with the Papacy negotiated in 598 temporarily ended thirty years of Lombard terror in the Ducatus Romanus and he spent most of his war-making energies on the Byzantine threat. In that year, he consolidated Lombard power, extending the dominion of his kingdom by taking Sutri and Perugia among other Umbrian cities from the exarchate of Ravenna, while maintaining good relations with the Bavarians. He fought the Avars and Slavs, and entered a truce with the Byzantine emperor Maurice in 598 with the aid of Pope Gregory the Great. The following year, Exarch Callinicus broke the truce by kidnapping the travelling daughter of the Lombard king.Paul the Deacon, History, 4.20; translated by Foulke, p. 165 War erupted and, in 602, the Byzantine emperor Phocas lost Padua, which Authari had cut off from Ravenna a decade prior. The loss of Padua in turn cut off Mantua and, before the year was out, that city too fell to Agilulf. In 607, Witteric, king of the Visigoths, initiated a quadruple alliance against Theuderic II of Burgundy involving Theudebert II of Austrasia, Clotaire II of Neustria, and Agilulf. Theuderic's grandmother and sister had murdered Theuderic's wife, the daughter of Witteric. The alliance does not seem to have had success. Nothing of any actual combat is known except that it took place, probably around Narbonne. In 605, he was recognized by the emperor Phocas, who paid a tribute and ceded Orvieto among other towns. The Persian Wars drew Byzantine attention to the Orient and gave respite to Agilulf's final decade on the throne. He had to put down some insurrections and the Avars did not desist from invading Friuli, where they slew its duke, Gisulf, in 610. Otherwise, his reign ended peacefully and he died in 616, after reigning for more than a quarter of a century. He was succeeded by Adaloald, his son by Theodelinda, who was still an adolescent, though he had been associated with the throne. He had a daughter Gundeberga who married Arioald who later became king. == Notes == Category:6th-century births Category:Year of birth unknown Category:616 deaths Category:6th-century kings of Italy Category:7th-century kings of Italy Category:6th-century Arian Christians Category:7th-century Arian Christians Category:Lombard kings Category:Lombard warriors Category:6th-century Lombard people Category:7th-century Lombard people Category:7th-century monarchs in Europe Category:6th-century monarchs in Europe Category:People from Monza Category:People from Brianza Category:Baiuvarii ","title":"Agilulf"},{"id":"3233025","text":"Frank Burrows (born 30 January 1944 in Larkhall) is a Scottish former football player and manager. ==Biography== Frank Burrows began his football career at Scottish club Raith Rovers. In 1965 he moved south to England and joined Scunthorpe United. Impressive performances as a defender for Scunthorpe led to him being signed by Swindon Town F.C. for the 1968‚Äì69 season as a replacement for the departing Mel Nurse. Burrows was a major factor in helping Swindon to their most successful ever season in which they won promotion and the League Cup. Burrows played alongside team captain Stan Harland in the middle of a defence that conceded just 35 goals in 46 League matches. He went on to make over 350 appearances for Swindon. At the start of the 1973‚Äì74 season he was made a player coach, such was the feeling that he was a natural leader as well as a solid defender. The 1975‚Äì76 season saw his coaching come more into prominence. The season had not gone well for Swindon with a defeat at the hands of Tooting & Mitcham United in the FA Cup and a slide down the Football League Division Three table into a perilous position. Ambitious as a manager, Burrows left Swindon to be appointed Assistant Manager to Jimmy Dickinson at Portsmouth. When Dickinson resigned in 1979 Burrows replaced him. Burrows enjoyed success at Portsmouth as a manager winning promotion from the fourth division in May 1980, after leaving the club in 1982 he spent time as assistant manager at Sunderland, before being appointed manager at Cardiff City in May 1986. Burrows arrived to a Cardiff side demoralised by two successive relegations under former manager Alan Durban that had left the club in the bottom rung of the Football League. Burrows brought in his own coaching staff, including former City manager Jimmy Goodfellow, Bobby Smith and Gavin Tait, and set to work revitalising a side that had dropped the new depths. Burrows managed to lead City to promotion in the 1987‚Äì88 season, but the side struggled in the old Third Division and following disagreements with the board of directors, Burrows resigned in August 1989. Later that year, he returned to Portsmouth as assistant manager to John Gregory, before being appointed manager in 1990. However, he left the following year after a string of poor performances. Burrows then arrived at Swansea City in March 1991, and enjoyed a productive four-year spell as manager of the Swans. Whilst at Swansea he led them to victory in the 1994 Football League Trophy Final. However, a falling out with the board led to Burrows departure in July 1995, being succeeded in the position by his assistant, Bobby Smith. He was then on the coaching staff at West Ham United, working under manager Harry Redknapp before returning to Cardiff City as manager in February 1998, succeeding Kenny Hibbitt in the manager's position. Under Burrows, Cardiff won promotion to the old Division Two in the 1998‚Äì99 season, but the team found themselves struggling to stay out of the relegation zone, and Burrows resigned in February 2000, being succeeded by his assistant Billy Ayre. From 2000 until 2004, Burrows was assistant manager to Gary Megson at West Bromwich Albion and helped them win promotion to the Premiership twice. In 2001 Burrows was diagnosed with cancer of the kidney, and spent several weeks away from The Hawthorns to recover from major surgery. In 2002, he signed a new three-year deal with the Baggies. Burrows took charge of two games as caretaker-manager following Megson's departure in November 2004, but left the Hawthorns once Bryan Robson arrived, despite being offered a role in the new setup. He was then given an opportunity to resurrect his partnership with Gary Megson, when he was offered the job of first team coach at Nottingham Forest, but he turned the post down, citing family reasons. He did join up with Megson again two years later though, taking up a role in the Leicester City coaching setup. The partnership was not to last long, however, as after just 41 days in the job Megson resigned, leaving Burrows as caretaker manager alongside Gerry Taggart. This continued until 22 November 2007, when Ian Holloway was appointed as the new Leicester manager and Burrows left the club by mutual consent. ==External links== * * Frank Burrows profile at the League Managers Association * ==References== Category:1944 births Category:Living people Category:Scottish footballers Category:Scottish football managers Category:Raith Rovers F.C. players Category:Scunthorpe United F.C. players Category:Swindon Town F.C. players Category:Premier League managers Category:Portsmouth F.C. managers Category:Leicester City F.C. managers Category:Cardiff City F.C. managers Category:Swansea City A.F.C. managers Category:West Bromwich Albion F.C. managers Category:Kidney cancer survivors Category:People from Larkhall Category:Sportspeople from South Lanarkshire Category:Association football defenders ","title":"Frank Burrows"},{"id":"3233033","text":"Parkhouse Hill is a small but distinctive hill in the Peak District National Park in the English county of Derbyshire. It lies on the north side of the River Dove, close to the border with Staffordshire. Geologically, the hill is the remains of an atoll (a 'reef knoll') which is believed to have existed during the Carboniferous period when what is now the Peak District was covered by a tropical sea. Together with its higher but less distinctive neighbour, Chrome Hill, it forms the Chrome and Parkhouse Hills SSSI, cited for their geology and limestone flora. For many years access to Parkhouse Hill was difficult, as there was no right of way to the summit. Access is now possible under the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000, as the hill is a designated access area. In 1997, the writer Jeff Kent discovered that a double sunset could be seen against Parkhouse Hill from nearby Glutton Grange and, two years later, the phenomenon was first captured on film by the photographer Chris Doherty. The occurrence is visible in good weather in late March, early April and September, when the sun sets just to the south of the summit of the hill, begins to re-emerge almost immediately afterwards from its steep northern slope before fully reappearing and later sets for a second and final time at the foot of the hill. The precise event and its location are described in Kent's book The Mysterious Double Sunset.The Mysterious Double Sunset, especially pages 103-104, 106, 201 and 202 and photographs 18 (i)-(iv), Jeff Kent, , Witan Books, 2001. ==External links== * Geology of Parkhouse Hill - From the British Geological Survey * Photographs of Parkhouse Hill by Robin Weaver ==References== Category:Mountains and hills of the Peak District Category:Mountains and hills of Derbyshire Category:Sites of Special Scientific Interest in Derbyshire ","title":"Parkhouse Hill"},{"id":"3233036","text":"Histone H1 is one of the five main histone protein families which are components of chromatin in eukaryotic cells. Though highly conserved, it is nevertheless the most variable histone in sequence across species. == Structure == A diagram showing where H1 can be found in the nucleosome Metazoan H1 proteins feature a central globular \\"winged helix\\" domain and long C- and short N-terminal tails. H1 is involved with the packing of the \\"beads on a string\\" sub-structures into a high order structure, whose details have not yet been solved. H1 found in protists and bacteria, otherwise known as nucleoprotein HC1/HC2 (), lack the central domain and the N-terminal tail. H1 is less conserved than core histones. The globular domain is the most conserved part of H1. == Function == Unlike the other histones, H1 does not make up the nucleosome \\"bead\\". Instead, it sits on top of the structure, keeping in place the DNA that has wrapped around the nucleosome. H1 is present in half the amount of the other four histones, which contribute two molecules to each nucleosome bead. In addition to binding to the nucleosome, the H1 protein binds to the \\"linker DNA\\" (approximately 20-80 nucleotides in length) region between nucleosomes, helping stabilize the zig-zagged 30 nm chromatin fiber. Much has been learned about histone H1 from studies on purified chromatin fibers. Ionic extraction of linker histones from native or reconstituted chromatin promotes its unfolding under hypotonic conditions from fibers of 30 nm width to beads-on-a-string nucleosome arrays. It is uncertain whether H1 promotes a solenoid-like chromatin fiber, in which exposed linker DNA is shortened, or whether it merely promotes a change in the angle of adjacent nucleosomes, without affecting linker length However, linker histones have been demonstrated to drive the compaction of chromatin fibres that had been reconstituted in vitro using synthetic DNA arrays of the strong '601' nucleosome positioning element. Nuclease digestion and DNA footprinting experiments suggest that the globular domain of histone H1 localizes near the nucleosome dyad, where it protects approximately 15-30 base pairs of additional DNA. In addition, experiments on reconstituted chromatin reveal a characteristic stem motif at the dyad in the presence of H1. Despite gaps in our understanding, a general model has emerged wherein H1's globular domain closes the nucleosome by crosslinking incoming and outgoing DNA, while the tail binds to linker DNA and neutralizes its negative charge. Many experiments addressing H1 function have been performed on purified, processed chromatin under low-salt conditions, but H1's role in vivo is less certain. Cellular studies have shown that overexpression of H1 can cause aberrant nuclear morphology and chromatin structure, and that H1 can serve as both a positive and negative regulator of transcription, depending on the gene. In Xenopus egg extracts, linker histone depletion causes ~2-fold lengthwise extension of mitotic chromosomes, while overexpression causes chromosomes to hypercompact into an inseparable mass. Complete knockout of H1 in vivo has not been achieved in multicellular organisms due to the existence of multiple isoforms that may be present in several gene clusters, but various linker histone isoforms have been depleted to varying degrees in Tetrahymena, C. elegans, Arabidopsis, fruit fly, and mouse, resulting in various organism-specific defects in nuclear morphology, chromatin structure, DNA methylation, and/or specific gene expression. == Dynamics == While most histone H1 in the nucleus is bound to chromatin, H1 molecules shuttle between chromatin regions at a fairly high rate. It is difficult to understand how such a dynamic protein could be a structural component of chromatin, but it has been suggested that the steady-state equilibrium within the nucleus still strongly favors association between H1 and chromatin, meaning that despite its dynamics, the vast majority of H1 at any given timepoint is chromatin bound. H1 compacts and stabilizes DNA under force and during chromatin assembly, which suggests that dynamic binding of H1 may provide protection for DNA in situations where nucleosomes need to be removed. Cytoplasmic factors appear to be necessary for the dynamic exchange of histone H1 on chromatin, but these have yet to be specifically identified. H1 dynamics may be mediated to some degree by O-glycosylation and phosphorylation. O-glycosylation of H1 may promote chromatin condensation and compaction. Phosphorylation during interphase has been shown to decrease H1 affinity for chromatin and may promote chromatin decondensation and active transcription. However, during mitosis phosphorylation has been shown to increase the affinity of H1 for chromosomes and therefore promote mitotic chromosome condensation. == Isoforms == The H1 family in animals includes multiple H1 isoforms that can be expressed in different or overlapping tissues and developmental stages within a single organism. The reason for these multiple isoforms remains unclear, but both their evolutionary conservation from sea urchin to humans as well as significant differences in their amino acid sequences suggest that they are not functionally equivalent. One isoform is histone H5, which is only found in avian erythrocytes, which are unlike mammalian erythrocytes in that they have nuclei. Another isoform is the oocyte/zygotic H1M isoform (also known as B4 or H1foo), found in sea urchins, frogs, mice, and humans, which is replaced in the embryo by somatic isoforms H1A-E, and H10 which resembles H5. Despite having more negative charges than somatic isoforms, H1M binds with higher affinity to mitotic chromosomes in Xenopus egg extracts. == Post-translational Modifications == Like other histones, the histone H1 family is extensively post-translationally modified (PTMs). This includes serine and threonine phosphorylation, lysine acetylation, lysine methylation and ubiquitination. These PTMs serve a variety of functions but are less well studied than the PTMs of other histones. == See also == *nucleosome *histone *chromatin *linker histone H1 variants *Other histone proteins involved in chromatin: :*H2A :*H2B :*H3 :*H4 == References == Category:Proteins ","title":"Histone H1"},{"id":"3233040","text":"Gordon Alan Marlatt (November 26, 1941 ‚Äì March 14, 2011) was a leading clinical psychologist in the field of addictive behaviors from the 1980s through the 2000s. He conducted pioneering research in harm reduction, brief interventions, and relapse prevention. == Biography == Born in Vancouver, British Columbia in 1941, Marlatt received his Ph.D. in clinical psychology from Indiana University in 1968. After serving on the faculties of the University of British Columbia (1968‚Äì1969) and the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison (1969‚Äì1972), he joined the University of Washington faculty in the fall of 1972. He eventually became a Professor of Psychology and Director of the Addictive Behaviors Research Center at that institution. He conducted pioneering research in three areas: harm reduction, brief interventions, and relapse prevention. In 1996, Dr. Marlatt was appointed as a member of the National Advisory Council on Drug Abuse of the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA). He served as the President of the Society of Psychologists in Addictive Behaviors from 1983 to 1984; President of the Section for the Development of Clinical Psychology as an Experimental- Behavioral Science of the Society of Clinical Psychology (Division 12 of the American Psychological Association), 1985‚Äì1986; and President of the Association for the Advancement of Behavior Therapy, 1991‚Äì1992. Marlatt's books include Alcoholism: New Directions in Behavioral Research and Treatment (1978), Relapse Prevention: Maintenance strategies in the treatment of addictive behaviors (1985, 2005), Assessment of Addictive Behaviors (1985; 2005), Addictive Behaviors Across the Lifespan (1993), Harm Reduction: Pragmatic Strategies for Managing High-Risk Behaviors (1998), Changing Addictive Behavior (co-authored with Dennis M. Donovan and Jalie Tucker) (1999), and Brief Alcohol Screening and Intervention for College Students (BASICS) Manual (1999), The Tao of Sobriety: Helping You to Recover from Alcohol and Drug Addiction (Forward) (2002), and Therapist's Guide to Evidence-Based Relapse Prevention (2007). In addition, he published over 200 book chapters and journal articles and served on the editorial boards of numerous professional journals, including the Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, Journal of Abnormal Psychology, Addictive Behaviors, and Journal of Studies on Alcohol. Marlatt received continuous funding for his research from a variety of agencies including the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, the National Institute on Drug Abuse, the ABMRF/The Foundation for Alcohol Research, and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. In 1990, Marlatt was awarded The Jellinek Memorial Award for outstanding contributions to knowledge in the field of alcohol studies from the International Society for Biomedical Research on Alcoholism. In 2001, he was given the Innovators in Combating Substance Abuse Award by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, and in 2004 he received the Distinguished Researcher Award from the Research Society on Alcoholism. He received the Distinguished Psychologist award for Professional Contribution to Knowledge from the Washington State Psychological Association in 1990 and the Distinguished Scientist Award from the Society for a Science of Clinical Psychology in 2000. Marlatt died on March 11 , 2011 of kidney failure in Warm Beach, Washington. == Urge Surfing == Urge surfing is a technique attributed to the late psychologist Alan Marlatt, Ph.D., a pioneer in the field of addictions treatment. We can think of an urge as an impulse to engage in an old habit, such as drinking or using, and they are often experienced as physical sensations in the body. Urges are like waves in that they rise in intensity, peak, and eventually crash. ==See also== * Relapse Prevention ==References== * Alan Marlatt at the University of Washington Psychology Department * Addictive Behaviors Research Center at the University of Washington ==External links== * An Interview with Alan Marlatt (Psychotherapy.net) Marlatt Category:Researchers in alcohol abuse Category:University of Washington faculty Category:1941 births Category:2011 deaths Category:Writers on addiction ","title":"G.

He was also Medical Director of the charity, the Foundation for Liver Research a UK registered charity (RCN 1134579) and was the lead person of the Lancet Commission into Liver Disease in the UK. He was educated at St Mary's College, Southampton, and The London Hospital Medical College (now Barts and Royal London Medical School), graduating MBBS in 1949. After National Service in the RAMC, he worked at the Postgraduate Medical School, London and between 1959-1965 was a Lecturer in Medicine in Professor Sheila Sherlock's Liver Unit at the Royal Free Hospital, including a year as the Rockefeller Travelling Fellow in Medicine at the Presbyterian Hospital, New York. Appointed as Clinical Tutor and Consultant Physician at King's College Hospital in 1966, he set up a Unit dedicated to research into liver disorders based on multidisciplinary groups of scientists, physicians and surgeons. Together with Sir Roy Calne, he pioneered liver transplantation in the UK, the first liver transplant at King's College Hospital being carried out on September 28, 1968. Other pioneering work in acute liver failure led to the first dedicated unit for patients with this condition. The Liver Unit was recognised in 1992 by King's College London as an Institute of Liver Studies. In 1996, Roger Williams moved to a new research Institute at University College London, funded by the Foundation for Liver Research. New areas of translational clinical study were initiated including Living Donor Liver Transplantation and devices for temporary liver support. His return to King's College Hospital in June 2016 followed an invitation from the Chairman of the Hospital to relocate the Institute of Hepatology to that site. Professor Williams received numerous awards and medals, the most notable of these being the Distinguished Achievement Award of the American Association for the Study of Liver Disease in 2013, the first British subject to have this honour. Other awards include the American Society of Transplantation Senior Achievement Award in 2004, a Hans Popper Lifetime Achievement Award in 2008, and the Distinguished Service Award of the International Liver Transplant Society in 2011. He was a Fellow of the Academy of Medical Sciences, Honorary Fellow of the American College of Physicians and of the Irish College of Physicians. He was a founder member of European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL), serving as Chairman in 1983 and as Honorary President in 2008. He was appointed CBE for services to medicine in 1993. He was the author of approximately 3000 papers, chapters and reviews published in learned journals and books. In 2010 he was quoted as the most cited researcher of the year in his specialty by ISI Thomson Scientific. Professor Williams practiced at King's College Hospital and in the Harley Street Diagnostic Clinic until he died in 2020. Outside medicine, his interests were opera, piano music and sport. He enjoyed tennis and yacht racing and was a member of the Royal Yacht Squadron and Royal Ocean Racing Club.

Histone proteins are highly post-translationally modified however Histone H3 is the most extensively modified of the five histones. The term \\"Histone H3\\" alone is purposely ambiguous in that it does not distinguish between sequence variants or modification state. Histone H3 is an important protein in the emerging field of epigenetics, where its sequence variants and variable modification states are thought to play a role in the dynamic and long term regulation of genes. == Epigenetics and post-translational modifications == The N-terminus of H3 protrudes from the globular nucleosome core and is susceptible to post- translational modification that influence cellular processes. These modifications include the covalent attachment of methyl or acetyl groups to lysine and arginine amino acids and the phosphorylation of serine or threonine. Di- and Tri-methylation of lysine 9 are associated with repression and heterochromatin (see H3K9me2 and H3K9me3), while mono-methylation of K4 (K4 corresponds to lysine residue at 4th position)(see H3K4me1), is associated with active genes. Acetylation of histone H3 at several lysine positions in the histone tail is performed by histone acetyltransferase enzymes (HATs). Acetylation of lysine14 is commonly seen in genes that are being actively transcribed into RNA (see H3K14ac). == Sequence variants == Mammalian cells have seven known sequence variants of histone H3.

Featuring a main globular domain and a long N-terminal tail, H4 is involved with the structure of the nucleosome of the 'beads on a string' organization. Histone proteins are highly post-translationally modified. Covalently bonded modifications include acetylation and methylation of the N-terminal tails. These modifications may alter expression of genes located on DNA associated with its parent histone octamer. Histone H4 is an important protein in the structure and function of chromatin, where its sequence variants and variable modification states are thought to play a role in the dynamic and long term regulation of genes. ==Genetics== Histone H4 is encoded in multiple genes at different loci including: HIST1H4A, HIST1H4B, HIST1H4C, HIST1H4D, HIST1H4E, HIST1H4F, HIST1H4G, HIST1H4H, HIST1H4I, HIST1H4J, HIST1H4K, HIST1H4L, HIST2H4A, HIST2H4B, HIST4H4. ==Evolution== Histone proteins are among the most highly conserved eukaryotic proteins. For example, the amino acid sequence of histone H4 from a pea and cow differ at only 2 out of the 102 positions. This evolutionary conservation suggests that the functions of histone proteins involve nearly all of their amino acids so that any change is deleterious to the cell. Most changes in histone sequences are lethal; the few that are not lethal cause changes in the pattern of gene expression as well as other abnormalities. == Structure == Histone H4 is a 102 to 135 amino acid protein which shares a structural motif, known as the histone fold, formed from three a-helices connected by two loops. Histone proteins H3 and H4 bind to form a H3-H4 dimer, two of these H3-H4 dimers combine to form a tetramer. This tetramer further combines with two H2a-H2b dimers to form the compact Histone octamer core. == Sequence variants == Histone H4 is one of the slowest evolving proteins, and there appear to be no known sequence variants of histone H4. However, there are H4 genes that are constitutively expressed throughout the cell cycle that encode for proteins that are identical in sequence to the major H4. The reason for a lack of sequence variants remains unclear. == Alternative translation == The Osteogenic Growth Peptide (OGP) is a 14-aa peptide produced from alternative translation of Histone H4 mRNA, sharing the C-terminal sequence \`ALKRQGRTLYGFGG\` of histone H4. It is found in human and rat circulation as well as regenerating bone marrow. In blood serum it is bound to Œ±2M along with two other binding proteins that are not clearly identified. A specific receptor has not been identified, but some signaling pathways involved in its bone-regenaration function has been elucidated. ==Post-translational modifications== Eukaryotic organisms can produce small amounts of specialized variant core histones that differ in amino acid sequence from the main ones. These variants with a variety of covalent modifications on the N-terminal can be added to histones making possible different chromatin structures that are required for DNA function in higher eukaryotes. Potential modifications include methylation (mono-, di-, or tri- methylation) or acetylation on the tails. === Methylation === Histone methylation occurs on arginine, lysine and histidine amino acids residues. Mono-, di- or tri-methylation has been discovered on histone H2A, H3 and H4. Histone methylation has been associated with various cellular functions such as transcription, DNA replication, and DNA damage response including repair, heterochromatin formation, and somatic cell reprogramming. Among these biological functions, transcriptional repression and activation are the most studied. Studies have shown that H4R3 methylation by PRMT1 (a histone methyltransferase) appears to be essential in vivo for the establishment or maintenance of a wide range of ‚Äúactive‚Äù chromatin modifications. Also methylation of histone H4 by PRMT1 was sufficient to permit subsequent acetylation on the N-terminal tail. However, acetylation of H4 inhibits its methylation by PRMT1. === Acetylation === Acetylation of histones is thought to relax condensed heterochromatin as the negative charge of acetyl groups can repel the DNA phosphate backbone charges, thus reducing the histone binding affinity for DNA. This hypothesis was validated by the discovery of the histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity of several transcriptional activator complexes. Histone acetylation influences chromatin structure in several ways. First, it can provide a tag for the binding of proteins that contain areas which recognize the acetylated tails. Secondly, it can block the function of chromatin remodelers. Thirdly, it neutralizes the positive charge on lysines. Acetylation of histone H4 on lysine 16 (H4K16ac) is especially important for chromatin structure and function in a variety of eukaryotes and is catalyzed by specific histone lysine acetyltransferases (HATs). H4K16 is particularly interesting because this is the only acetylatable site of the H4 N-terminal tail, and can influence the formation of a compact higher-order chromatin structure. Hypoacetylation of H4K16 appears to cause delayed recruitment of DNA repair proteins to sites of DNA damage in a mouse model of the premature aging syndrome Hutchinson Gilford progeria. H4K16Ac also has roles in transcriptional activation and the maintenance of euchromatin. ==List of H4 modifications== H4S1p H4R3me H4K5ac H4K8ac H4K12ac H4K16ac H4K16adp H4K20me H4S47o-p H4K91ac H4K91ub ==See also== * Histone code#Histone_H4 == References == == See also == *nucleosome *histone *chromatin *Other histone proteins involved in chromatin: :*H1 :*H2A :*H2B :*H3 ","title":"Histone H4"},{"id":"3233097","text":"Enefiok Udo-Obong (born 22 May 1982), also known as Enee, is a Nigerian sprinter and accomplished athlete.

Marsh was a three-time ABA senior amateur champion who went on to become the British, European and IBF light welterweight world champion as a professional. He was the first European boxer ever to retire as an undefeated World Champion, a feat later equalled by Romanian Michael Loewe, Germany's Sven Ottke and Welshman Joe Calzaghe. Marsh was charged with the attempted murder of his former manager, the boxing promoter, Frank Warren following Warren's shooting in London in 1989. Marsh spent 10 months on remand before he was released after being acquitted at trial. Marsh changed his name by deed poll to \\"None Of The Above X\\" and stood in the 2010 and 2015 UK general elections as an independent candidate in protest against there being no option to vote for \\"none of the above\\". ==Early life== Marsh was born in Stepney, East London, where he grew up in a small terraced house with his parents and three brothers. Marsh, who was a junior chess champion, began boxing as a youth at the St George's Club in Stepney before the family moved to Basildon in Essex. Marsh attended Westminster City School between 1969 -1971. Before he became a professional boxer, Marsh was a Royal Marine who served in Cyprus and in Crossmaglen in Northern Ireland during the Troubles. He later became a firefighter with the Essex County Fire and Rescue Service, serving on White Watch, Tilbury. ==Amateur career== As an amateur Marsh was a National schoolboy champion, NABC champion and twice junior ABA champion before going on to win three senior national titles whilst representing the Royal Navy boxing team. Marsh's first title came in 1978 in the lightweight division beating Edmund Gajny in the final. The following year Marsh moved up to the light welterweight division and again reached the final but was this time defeated by Eddie Copeland. In 1980, Marsh again moved up a weight, to welterweight, and again reached the final, defeating Edward Byrne. 1981 saw Marsh's final year as an amateur: this year he remained at welterweight and again reached the final, his fourth in a row. In the 67 kg final, he defeated the future British, Commonwealth and WBO champion Chris Pyatt to win his third senior title. He also won a multi-nations gold medal representing England in the Philippines in 1981 capping an unbeaten international amateur record. ==Professional career== Robe worn during his defence. He had his first professional fight in October 1981, defeating Andrew DaCosta on points over six rounds, in Bloomsbury, London. In his thirteenth fight he won the vacant Southern Area Light-Welterweight Title, defeating Vernon Vanriel on points over ten rounds, at York Hall in Bethnal Green. In September 1984, he defeated Clinton McKenzie to take the British Light- Welterweight Title. The fight was at the Britannia Leisure Centre, Shoreditch, and Marsh won on points over twelve rounds. In October 1985, he fought the Italian, Alessandro Scapecchi for the vacant European Light-Welterweight Title. The bout was held in Monte Carlo and Marsh won by a knock out in the seventh round. He successfully defended his European title against Tusikoleta Nkalankete (French) in January 1986, and Francesco Prezioso (Italy) in April 1986. On 4 March 1987, he fought the American, Joe Manley for the International Boxing Federation (IBF) World Light-Welterweight title. The fight was at his home town of Basildon, and Marsh won on a technical knockout in the tenth round. On 1 July 1987, he defended his IBF title against Japanese fighter, Akio Kameda at the Royal Albert Hall, Kensington. Insisting it would be his last fight Marsh won, by a technical knockout in the seventh round. He then retired as undefeated IBF world champion. In September 1987 he announced that he had epilepsy.ITN News at Ten, 14 September 1987 He took up chessboxing at the age 56 winning the World Chessboxing association welterweight title against Dymer Agasaryan from Armenia. ==The shooting of Frank Warren== On 30 November 1989, Warren was to attend one of his boxing promotions at The Broadway theatre in Barking which featured Colin McMillan. As he arrived at the venue he was approached by a masked gunman who appeared from the crowd and shot him twice in the chest with .22 bullets from a Luger pistol at close range. The gunman fled and Warren was taken to hospital. Warren lost half a lung and was in great pain after the shooting. The business style of Warren had made him enemies, and following his shooting there were a number of suspects. The ongoing libel case between Marsh and Warren led police to believe Marsh had a strong personal motive to undertake the attack due to the bad blood between the pair. During a search of Marsh's home police found ammunition in his possession, but this was explained by Marsh's previous career as a Marine and it did not match the bullets used in the attack. Two months after the shooting and despite the lack of forensic evidence, any confession or identification Marsh was charged with the attempted murder of Frank Warren and was remanded in custody. During the trial a prison confession was used against Marsh. Marsh did not appear in the witness box to give evidence. He was subsequently acquitted. The outstanding libel case was subsequently contested by the two protagonists and the jury found in favour of Marsh. ==Personal== Marsh retired in December 1987 after he was diagnosed as having epilepsy. In the late 1980s, the Terry Marsh Leisure Centre in Pitsea, Essex was named in his honour. However, subsequent squabbles between local councillors have seen this renamed the Eversley Leisure Centre, although the plaque bearing his image remains. Since then, Marsh has attempted to enter politics, first for the Labour Party. However, when Labour announced they would have a female-only short-list for Basildon, he stood for the Liberal Democrats at the 1997 General Election, but was forced to withdraw from the contest, as he was charged with fraud and deception for allegedly having fraudulently claimed two student grants after going back to the then London Guildhall University at the end of his boxing career. He was later cleared of the offence. In 2009, he set up a new political party, NOTA, which stands for \\"None of the Above\\". He had an acting role in the 1989 film Tank Malling, and has since written and published his autobiography, Undefeated. Following his retirement from boxing Marsh became a stockbroker. On May 4, 2017 Marsh was physically prevented from leaving a polling station, relating to a County election, by the Presiding officer (Carl Sayonas). Marsh was taking his ballot paper with him rather than vote for any of the candidates available. Having been detained against his will Marsh kneed the presiding officer in the groin in order to escape and subsequently was charged with two offences; the fraudulent removal of a ballot paper from a polling station and assault & battery. At the trial the first charge was dropped; Indicating it is not unlawful to take your vote home. However, Marsh's defence of self defence was rejected by the Court on the assault charge. It was deemed that Marsh was entitled to use self defence but his response was excessive. ==2010 and 2015 general elections== In 2010, Marsh was a candidate in that year's general election as an independent candidate in the seat of South Basildon and East Thurrock. Marsh changed his name by deed poll to \\"None Of The Above X\\" as a protest against there being no facility to select \\"None of the above\\" as an option on the ballot paper. Under UK law, a political party cannot call itself \\"None of the Above\\", but this restriction does not apply to candidate names. His chosen surname of \\"X\\" meant that he was likely to be the last entry on the ballot paper. He said that if he won he would not take his seat. He received 125 votes, placing last out of six candidates. In the same election a candidate who changed his name to \\"None of the Above Zero\\" stood in Filton and Bradley Stoke. X stood again in 2015, this time receiving 253 votes and placing sixth of seven candidates. They did not do any electioneering during the campaign. == Amateur achievements == *1973 Junior ABA champion *1974 Junior ABA champion *1974 National schoolboy champion *1976 NABC champion *1978 ABA Lightweight champion *1980 ABA Welterweight champion *1981 ABA Welterweight champion *1981 Multi-Nations Gold Medalist - Manila ==References== ==External links== * Category:Living people Category:1958 births Category:English male boxers Category:People with epilepsy Category:Sportspeople from Basildon Category:People from Stepney Category:Royal Marines ranks Category:International Boxing Federation champions Category:Independent politicians in England Category:England Boxing champions Category:Boxers from Greater London Category:Undefeated world boxing champions Category:Light-welterweight boxers ","title":"Terry Marsh (boxer)"},{"id":"3233104","text":"The Graduate Student Organizing Committee (GSOC) is a labor union representing graduate teaching and research assistants at New York University (NYU). GSOC is affiliated with the Technical, Office, and Professional Union, United Auto Workers Local 2110, an amalgamated union that also represents employees at the Village Voice newspaper, the American Civil Liberties Union, the Museum of Modern Art, and several other locations. ==Formation and first contract== GSOC is one of several labor organizations of graduate student teachers and researchers that formed at private universities in the 1990s. It is the first graduate employee union at a private U.S. university to have achieved collective bargaining unit recognition and negotiated a contract. (The contract expired in 2005 and the collective bargaining relationship with the university is scuttled.) When GSOC began to organize in the late 1990s, members believed that shifts in the academic labor market, including greater reliance on graduate student teaching and research, made necessary the formation of collective bargaining units. Members also sought a collective voice in their pay and working conditions. In 2000, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) unanimously ruled that graduate assistants were statutory ‚Äúemployees‚Äù under the National Labor Relations Act. As well, it stipulated that NYU was obliged to enter into collective bargaining negotiations with GSOC after a majority of graduate employees at the university voted in favor of the union in an NLRB election. In accordance with federal labor relations law and motions made by NYU and GSOC, the bargaining unit represented by GSOC in contract negotiations did not include graduate students who were primarily funded by private fellowships, those whose funding was not contingent on the performance of any work, and some other categories. In 2002, GSOC and NYU negotiated the first graduate assistant union contract at an American private university. (Many public universities already had union contracts under state labor laws.) The three-year contract increased stipends (dramatically for some), instituted a health care plan, and created a third- party arbitration procedure for economic disputes. ==2005-2006 strike== In 2004, a newly constituted NLRB voted 3-2 to reverse its 2000 NYU decision in a case involving graduate assistants at Brown University. The Republican- controlled board stated in their decision that \\"there is a significant risk, even a strong likelihood, that the collective-bargaining process will be detrimental to the educational process.\\" The dissenting opinion stated that \\"Today's decision is woefully out of touch with contemporary academic reality\\",This line was written by Glenn Stephens, a Senior Counsel on the Liebman staff, now working in the Civil Rights Division at USDA. and further that \\"It disregards the plain language of\\" Section 2(3) of the National Labor Relations Act, which \\"defines employees so broadly that graduate students who perform services for, and under the control of, their universities are easily covered\\". Soon thereafter, NYU asked members of the university community for feedback regarding whether it ought to negotiate a second contract with GSOC upon the August 31, 2005 expiration of the first. On August 5, 2005, NYU announced its decision not to negotiate with GSOC. Its primary grounds for this decision were the claim that GSOC had filed several grievances on non- academic matters regarding teaching assignments and that it had offered to negotiate with GSOC as long as the union would agree, before the start of negotiations, to surrender the previous contract‚Äôs third-party arbitration and agency shop provisions and become an \\"open shop\\" union, common in many southern states but largely without precedent in New York. However, on an official website devoted to the labor dispute, NYU to date has only cited two \\"non-academic\\" grievances, both of which were decided in the University's favor by an independent arbitrator appointed by both sides. In response, GSOC argued that without rights to third-party contract arbitration and an agency- shop provision, the contract offer would render the union virtually powerless to represent its members, a union in name only. The union also dismissed NYU's claims of disruptive grievances, arguing that the grievances to which the administration referred were economic disputes in which some graduate students were given the same jobs as in previous semesters, but reclassified as lower- paid adjunct professors not covered by the union contract. The union argued that this was not only damaging to graduate employees' wages and benefits, but a deliberate tactic to weaken the union by depriving it of members. The union also said that the administration had only given it 48 hours to respond to its ‚Äúultimatum‚Äù and that the GSOC leadership, due to union policy, could not agree to contract terms without the consent of their members. After several months without a contract, GSOC held a strike vote in which, according to GSOC representatives, 85 percent of those voting approved a strike. The strike began on November 9, 2005 and lasted through the entire spring semester. It is thought to have been the longest strike by academic workers at a college or university in U.S. history. In response to the Brown decision, NYU‚Äôs decision not to negotiate, the strike, and the administration‚Äôs response, several GSOC- supportive groups have formed at NYU to call upon president John Sexton to end the strike by negotiating a new contract. More than 200 faculty members - including prominent physicist Alan Sokal, who has written several essays voicing his opinion on the situation - have joined a group called Faculty Democracy . Student support of GSOC has been mixed. Undergraduates supporting GSOC have formed Graduate/Undergraduate Solidarity, and law students have formed Law/Grad Solidarity. The unions of adjunct faculty members, office support staff, security personnel, and other NYU employees have variously supported GSOC. On April 27, 2006, GSOC announced at a membership convention that a public majority of its members continued to support the union and had signed a petition which called on the University Leadership Team to bargain a second contract. After the convention, 43 GSOC members and 14 supporters engaged in an act of civil disobedience and were arrested for blocking traffic. GSOC members resumed their teaching duties on September 5, 2006 (the first day of classes for the 2006-2007 academic year), officially ending their six-month-long strike without receiving a second contract or winning back administrative recognition of the union's collective bargaining rights. The administration had recognized these rights prior to the August 31, 2005 contract expiration. GSOC, through the UAW, funded a failed lawsuit against the developer of a future NYU dorm. The plaintiffs in the lawsuit were community members, but a large portion of the legal fees were provided by the UAW, which was not named on the lawsuit. The suit was dismissed on Sept. 22, 2006. ==2013 vote and recognition== In 2009, GSOC issued a petition to the NLRB to reverse the Brown decision. The regional labor relations board voted in favor of GSOC-UAW, but the petition stalled at the national level. In 2013, New York University and GSOC-UAW made a joint decision that GSOC would withdraw its petition to the NLRB. In November of that year, the University administration announced that if a majority of the graduate assistant population would vote in favor of GSOC-UAW again representing them in collective bargaining with the University, GSOC-UAW would be recognized in such a role. In December 2013, graduate assistants at NYU voted 620 to 10 in favor of collective bargaining with NYU allied with GSOC-UAW. As a result of this vote, GSOC-UAW again represents graduate assistants at NYU, and continues to bargain with the administration. ==Controversies== The GSOC strike has caused various disruptions across campus, including canceled classes, classes moved to off-campus locations , class boycotts, and protests inside Bobst Library . Sympathy for the GSOC strike also kept some speakers and recruiters from participating in campus events. Several actions taken by the Sexton administration during the strike have sparked strong opposition among many faculty, students, and observers, including some who are not supportive of GSOC. Others, including some administrators, parents, undergraduates, have said that GSOC's strike is an unnecessary disruption to the academic process. Soon after the strike began, several NYU administrators discreetly signed on as instructors to the Blackboard course management systems for courses with teaching assistants in order to monitor the impact of the strike. When the professors teaching these classes discovered this, a strong reaction among faculty against this perceived violation of academic freedom forced a reversal of the move. In November 2005, NYU announced that graduate assistants who remained on strike past the fall 2005 semester would be locked out of working and receiving their stipends for one or two semesters. The university promised to fully fund tuition and healthcare, regardless of an individual GA's decision on whether to strike. In January 2006, Sexton followed through with the measures, revoking the stipends of 23 striking graduate students for two semesters. However, in late February 2006, 15 of the 23 punished GAs received letters stating that their fall stipends would be restored. Grievances filed by these blacklisted GAs through the university's new non-union \\"interim\\" grievance procedure in early 2006 remained unaddressed as late as December 23, 2006. ==See also== * Coalition of Graduate Employee Unions * List of graduate student employee unions * National Labor Relations Board ==References== ==External links== * GSOC-UAW Local 2110 * Nerds for GSOC (blog) Category:Graduate school trade unions Category:New York University Category:Trade unions affiliated with the United Auto Workers Category:Trade unions established in 1998 Category:1998 establishments in New York (state) ","title":"Graduate Student Organizing Committee"},{"id":"3233106","text":":For information about the day commemorating veterans and civilians in World War I, World War II, and other wars, see Remembrance Day.

Pinnacle West Capital made a profit of $500 million in 2017. With 4,000 MW of generating capacity, APS serves more than one million customers in 11 counties throughout most of the state, but mainly concentrated in northern and central Arizona.Pinnacle West: The Peak of the Energy Pyramid, SeekingAlpha.com, By Ted Allrich, posted on: November 20, 2006 APS is one of the two major suppliers of electricity to the Phoenix metropolitan area (the other being Salt River Project). APS is regulated by the Arizona Corporation Commission (ACC), the state agency that, by mandate of Article 15, Section 2 of the state's constitution, regulates energy utilities in Arizona, with the notable exception of SRP, the rural electrical districts, and the City of Mesa electric utility serving Downtown Mesa and the immediate vicinity (with the rest of the city being served by SRP). The holding company, Pinnacle West Capital, through its APS utility sells wholesale and retail power to the wider western United States and also provides energy-related services. Through another major subsidiary, Pinnacle West also developed and managed real estate in Arizona. Pinnacle West left the real estate business in 2010. The utility company also operates three nuclear reactors. Its Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station in Arizona, the largest nuclear plant in the U.S., came under scrutiny by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in 2005 when operational problems began to cause prolonged outages. ==History== In 1884, the Phoenix Light and Fuel Company was formed to provide electricity and heat to the people of the three-year-old town of Phoenix. It changed its name to Pacific Gas and Electric Company in 1906 and to Central Arizona Light and Power in 1920. Also in 1920, it paid a dividend, and continued the annual dividend without interruption for the next 69 years. The company became a subsidiary of the giant conglomerate American Power and Light in 1925, but became an independent company once again in 1945. In 1949, it merged with Northern Arizona Power and Light. In 1952, it merged with Arizona Edison and changed its name to Arizona Public Service.

However, by then the company had accumulated over US$2.1 billion in long-term debt. In 1982, APS issued another preferred stock (formerly ) with an 11.9% dividend, callable in 1987. And in 1983, it issued a third preferred stock (formerly ) paying an adjustable rate between 6 and 12%, through 1986. 1984 was a down year for both earnings and the stock price, which at its low that year had lost almost half its value from the 1983 peak. ==Service territory== APS serves about two-thirds of the Phoenix metropolitan area. It primarily serves downtown and northern Phoenix, as well as a large swath to the north and east of the city. Outside of the Valley, it serves Flagstaff, Prescott, Yuma and Douglas. ==Major power outage== On September 8, 2011, there was a widespread power outage affecting a region spreading west from Yuma, Arizona, to San Diego, California, and affecting parts of Northern Mexico. The outage was the result of 23 events that occurred on five power grids in a span of 11 minutes including the APS North Gila Substation. Federal, regional and local officials are investigating what happened and why the outage cascaded the way it did. Most of the areas affected were served by San Diego Gas & Electric, which saw its entire service area lose power. The outage appears to have been caused by the actions of an APS employee in the North Gila substation, and it is unknown why safeguards did not keep the outage limited to the Yuma area.Damon Gross, Cause of Widespread Outage Under Investigation; APS Works to Restore Service to Customers in Yuma Area , APS News Release, September 8, 2011. Accessed September 9, 2011 The outage occurred days before the tenth anniversary of the September 11 attacks, and hours before the United States Department of Homeland Security warned of a potential terrorist attack leading up to the anniversary, but the Federal Bureau of Investigation and SDG&E; early in their investigations ruled out terrorism. ===Blackout settlement=== On July 7, 2014, APS agreed to a $3.25 million settlement with NERC and FERC related to the September 2011 blackout. ==2018 Street Protests== On September 7, 2018, APS cut off the power to 72-year-old retiree Stephanie Pullman, due to an overdue electric bill. The same day, the temperature in the city hit 107 ¬∞F. Within a week, miss Pullman had died from heat exposure. Her death sparked statewide media coverage and street protests over APS's disconnect policy. The incident led to Arizona regulators banning power shutoffs on hot summer days. ==Solar Generation== As of 2016, APS has available one gigawatt of solar generating capacity. Approximately half is generated at large solar power stations and half at small rooftop solar systems. ==See also== *Path 46, also called West of Colorado River, Arizona-California West-of-the-River Path (WOR) *Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station *Four Corners Generating Station ==References== ==External links== *APS official site Category:History of Arizona Category:2011 in Arizona Category:Public utilities established in 1920 Category:Companies based in Phoenix, Arizona Category:Electric power companies of the United States Category:Nuclear power companies of the United States ","title":"Arizona Public Service"},{"id":"3233120","text":"Broons (, Gallo: Bron) is a commune in the C√¥tes-d'Armor department in Brittany in northwestern France. ==International relations== Broons is twinned with the town Neufahrn i.NB in Bavaria since 1971. ==Population== Inhabitants of Broons are called Broonais in French. == Heraldry == Blazon: Azure a cross Argent fretty Gules. ==Personalities== Bertrand du Guesclin, made Constable of France by the King of France. * Bertrand du Guesclin, French knight and constable of France during the Hundred Years' War, born in Broons in 1320. * Olivier de Clisson, French knight and constable of France. ==See also== *Communes of the C√¥tes-d'Armor department ==References== ==External links== *Official website Category:Communes of C√¥tes-d'Armor ","title":"Broons"},{"id":"3233121","text":"Omagh College of Further Education (often referred to as just Omagh College or \\"The Tech\\" by locals) is a college in Omagh, County Tyrone in Northern Ireland.

Rocks and Ruins by David Young Cameron 1913 Ben Ledi by David Young Cameron Sir David Young Cameron (28 June 1865 - 16 September 1945) was a Scottish painter and etcher. == Life == Cameron was the son of the Rev. Robert Cameron and was born in Glasgow, Scotland. He was educated at The Glasgow Academy. From around 1881 he studied at the Glasgow School of Art and in 1885 enrolled at the Edinburgh Schools of Art. Cameron became a skilled etcher making a name for himself in this medium and gaining international recognition by the 1890s. He was elected associate of the Royal Society of Painter-Etchers (RE) in 1889. In 1895 he was elected Fellow of the RE. He exhibited regularly from 1889 to 1902, before resigning his membership in 1903. His subjects included architectural studies, of which he produced a number of popular 'sets' and landscapes. He received various medals and awards for his etchings. It was during this time that he published a number of sets of etchings (such as \\"The Clyde Set\\", \\"The North Holland Set\\" and \\"The North Italian Set\\"). In general his prints feature areas of great darkness, offset by highlights. Cameron would later become known for his church interiors and barren landscapes of Scotland done in drypoint. The feathery lightness of these drypoints was in visual contrast with the rock and water of the subjects. He became highly sought after by collectors, until the Great Crash of 1929 brought a collapse in prices for prints in general. He exploited his popularity by producing an unprecedented number of states of his prints, and is believed to hold the record at twenty-eight states in one case. As well as becoming well known as an etcher the artist also produced a great many oil paintings and watercolour sketches of landscapes and architectural subjects. Cameron's earliest known oil painting dates to 1883. His work was influenced by the Glasgow Boys and the Hague School. His first exhibition of 14 paintings received mixed reviews. Amongst the many good reviews others described his work as lacking in subtlety and substance with too much concentration on decoration. This was due in part to his romanticising of his subjects. From 1900 he stopped exhibiting portraits and figure studies, concentrating solely on landscapes and architectural subjects in both his painting and etching. In 1899 Cameron and his wife moved to Kippen in the Scottish Highlands. This was near to Stirling with views of Ben Lomond and across to Stirling Castle. They lived in the village for rest of their lives, as well as keeping a house in London. They also made regular trips abroad including visits throughout Italy and France. Italy provided the inspiration for a number of etchings of architectural subjects, with church interiors proving successful. His etchings, which examined light and shade, again show the influence of the Hague School as well as Whistler and Rembrandt. In 1901 Cameron became a member of the anti-Royal Academy society the International Society of Sculptors, Painters and Gravers, (later The International) that had been founded by Whistler in 1898. He exhibited with the society from 1898 and later served on its council. Following his resignation from the RE, Cameron and 11 other artists formed The Society of Twelve in 1904 with the objective to promote the original print. He became a member of the Royal Society of Painters in Watercolours in 1906. He was elected Associate of the Royal Scottish Academy (RsA) in 1904 (on his 6th attempt) and became RsA in 1918. Having previously been elected Associate of the Royal Academy (ARA) in the engraver class in 1911, in 1916 he was also elected ARA for his painting. He was elected a full Royal Academician (RA) in 1920. During these years Cameron's work was also exhibited at the Royal Society of Oil Painters, the Royal Glasgow Institute, the Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool, as well as showing in overseas exhibitions. After 1907 Cameron's work showed a greater focus on Scottish landscape subjects and from 1908 to 1917 he moved from etching to painting. Around this time he largely stopped including figures in his compositions, apart from in his architectural studies. By this time his works were receiving wide critical acclaim and he was well known both in the UK and abroad. Around 1908 his work began to lighten in colour, prior to this Cameron's work had been criticised for being too dark with a heavy use of brown tones. Visits to France and Italy in the 1920s seemed to have a further influence on his works and brought about a much brighter palette. His painting can be characterised by an interest in tone and design over colour and detail. At the same time there was a shift in influence away from the Glasgow Boys and their decorative style and he became known for his atmospheric highland landscapes. The Battlefields of Ypres‚ÄîAfter (1920) commissioned for the Hall of Remembrance, a commemoration of the dead of World War One. Cameron was well known and liked in the art world and held a great many appointments to societies and boards. On the retirement of RsA president Sir James Guthrie in 1919, it was suggested that Cameron stand for the presidency. Cameron declined however, citing too many existing responsibilities in London. In 1917-18 Cameron was commissioned by the Canadian Government to paint the war in France. Cameron was knighted in 1924 and was a Trustee of the Tate Gallery from 1921 to 1927 and the Scottish National Gallery, and was the King's Painter and Limner in Scotland 1933. Cameron died in Perth, Scotland on 16 September 1945. ==Artistic Recognition by Others== In 1914 he was sculpted by Percy Portsmouth ARSA.http://www.glasgowsculpture.com/pg_biography.php?LMCL=Jvs142‚äÇ=portsmouth_p ==References*Print REbels: Haden - Palmer - Whistler and the origins of the RE * Works in the National Galleries of Scotland *Tate: The Wilds of Assynt *Tate: Sir David Cameron *Collection of images *Culloden Moor *University of Michigan - Sir David Young Cameron *David Young Cameron's biography & artwork from the Permanent Collection of the Gracefield Arts Centre in Dumfries, Scotland biography & virtual representation of David Young Cameron's artwork of Gracefield Arts Centre at exploreart.co.uk *Sir David Young Cameron exhibition catalogs * Profile on Royal Academy of Arts Collections Category:1865 births Category:1945 deaths Category:19th-century Scottish painters Category:20th-century British printmakers Category:20th- century Scottish painters Category:Alumni of the Edinburgh College of Art Category:Alumni of the Glasgow School of Art Category:Royal Academicians Category:Royal Scottish Academicians Category:Scottish knights Category:Scottish male painters Category:Scottish printmakers Category:19th- century male artists ","title":"David Young Cameron"},{"id":"3233136","text":"Tooting & Mitcham United Football Club is an association football club based in the London Borough of Merton. They are currently members of the and play at Imperial Fields in Morden. Their nickname is \\"the Terrors\\" or \\"the Stripes\\". ==History== In 1932, Tooting FC (founded 1887) and Mitcham Wanderers FC (founded 1912) united to become the modern club representing the two areas. Their merger had been mooted for two years previously, but it was only after it became clear that the area couldn't host two competitive teams that anything happened to advance it. Originally playing in white shirts, in 1956 the broad black and white stripes were adopted. The club has reached the FA Cup proper on 10 occasions, the last time being the 2009‚Äì10 season. It has also won the Isthmian League twice, in 1958 and 1960. Other honours include the Surrey Senior Cup which the club has won nine times and the London Senior Cup which the club has won six times. Perhaps the most famous FA Cup run was in 1959, when the club reached the third round; drawn at home to First Division Nottingham Forest, on a frozen pitch they went into a 2-goal lead with goals from Grainger and Murphy before Forest fought back with the aid of a Murphy own goal and a penalty. Forest won the replay 3‚Äì0 in front of a crowd of 42,362 and went on to win the trophy that year. A British Pathe newsreel features this game. Alex Stepney, who was born in Mitcham in 1942, joined the club in 1958. In 1963 he signed for Millwall and later played for Chelsea, Manchester United and England. Dario Gradi, who spent more than twenty four years as manager of Crewe Alexandra, briefly played for the club in the 1960s. Tooting enjoyed a more sustained period of FA Cup glory in the 1970s. In 1974‚Äì75, they reached the first round proper for the first time since 1963‚Äì64 and were drawn at home against Crystal Palace, who played just five miles down the road and were in Football League Division 3. The game was played at Tooting's Sandy Lane ground on 27 November 1974, a Wednesday afternoon, in front of a packed crowd of, according to The Times,10,000. A Crystal Palace side which included Terry Venables, Peter Taylor and Alan Whittle won 2‚Äì1. Tooting's goal was scored by Steve Grubb.http://www.tmufc.co.uk/history/season/1970/74-75.htm In 1975‚Äì76, Tooting went three steps further reaching the fourth round proper, the last 32. They beat Romford 1‚Äì0 in the first round proper and Leatherhead 2‚Äì1 after a replay in the second. In the third round they triumphed over Football League opposition defeating Swindon Town of Football League Division 3.http://www.tmufc.co.uk/history/season/1970/75-76.htm After a 2‚Äì2 draw at Swindon (Tooting's goalscorers were Nicky Glover and Derek Casey), Tooting won 2‚Äì1 at Sandy Lane with goals from Dave Juneman and Alan Ives.http://www.tmufc.co.uk/history/season/1970/75-76.htm, http://www.swindon- town-fc.co.uk/HeadToHead.asp?Team=Tooting_and_Mitcham_United On 24 January 1976, the team and its supporters made the long journey to Bradford City of Football League Division 4. Although they did get on the scoresheet through Dave Juneman, they went down 3‚Äì1. After the game, Bradford City's Don Hutchins, who scored two of his side's goals, said he thought ‚Äòthe game was tougher than Rotherham and Shrewsbury‚Äô (Bradford's Football League opponents in the previous two rounds). ‚ÄòTooting put up a good fight.‚Äôhttp://www.bantamspast.co.uk/history/cityvsouthampton.htm This proved to be the club's high point although the team went on to reach the second round proper in 1976‚Äì77 losing away at Kettering 1‚Äì0http://www.tmufc.co.uk/history/season/1970/76-77.htm and the first round proper in 1977‚Äì78 losing 2‚Äì1 at home to Northampton Town of Football League Division 4.http://www.tmufc.co.uk/history/season/1970/77-78.htm In 2000‚Äì01 Keith Boanas led the club to the Isthmian League Second Division title, before leaving to manage Charlton Athletic Ladies. In the Isthmian League First Division, the club were managed by Richard Cadette, whose lengthy list of former clubs include Falkirk, Millwall and Brentford. The team played a very consistent first half of the 2005‚Äì06 season but injuries and the loss of star player Gavin Grant to Gillingham saw the team lose some of their cutting edge and start to falter. At the end of this season Cadette was sacked as the team once again failed to gain promotion following defeat in the playoff semi- finals to Tonbridge Angels. Former player Billy Smith was appointed as manager for the start of the 2006‚Äì07 season, in which the club won the Surrey Senior Cup and London Senior Cup. In May 2008, the club secured promotion to the Isthmian League Premier Division by defeating Cray Wanderers 1‚Äì0 at Imperial Fields. In the 2009‚Äì10 season they reached the first round of the FA Cup where they played in front of over 3,000 people against Stockport County although they were beaten 5‚Äì0. Despite an encouraging season the board announced that the club required a 40% cut in budget, these changes saw manager Billy Smith, his assistant George Wakeling and many of the players leave the club. Former Sheffield United player Mark Beard was appointed manager in May 2010, with former player Kevin Cooper as his assistant. After a good start to the 2011‚Äì12 season Beard was relieved of his position in December 2011 when results declined. Academy manager Danny Lee was appointed caretaker manager but declined the job permanently. As a result, Kenny Brown was appointed the new manager. However the results got worse and Tooting were relegated at the end of the 2011‚Äì12 season. Tooting & Mitcham had three managers in the 2012‚Äì13 season (Roberto Forzoni, Jamie Martin and Phil Simpson). The manager up until the end of the 2014‚Äì15 season was former player Craig Tanner who was in his second season at the helm with the Terrors before being sacked because of a lack of progress. Frank Wilson took his first senior role in football from 2015/16, an uncertain start saw a change in staff. Wilson introduced Paul Dale as 1st team coach in November 2015, a move that saw results improve, a climb away from relegation and the season rounded off with 2‚Äì0 victory in the London Senior Cup against Hendon. The following season saw them finish as Division One South Champions, finishing on 105 points, earning themselves a place in the Isthmian Premier Division. ==Stadium== Imperial Fields has a capacity of 3,500 (including 612 seats) and is located in Morden. There are two adjoining artificial 3G multi-purpose pitches, used primarily for training but also games of various sporting activities. The stadium was selected as a 2012 Olympics Torch bearer change-over point, the torch was carried in by BBC Sport commentator and presenter, Sue Barker.Olympic torch: Doreen Lawrence takes flame on relay BBC News, 23 July 2012Olympic torch comes to SW London Wimbledon Guardian, 23 July 2012 The club moved to Imperial Fields in 2002 from their previous historic ground at Sandy Lane in Mitcham. The new stadium had previously been the site of a former Chelsea, Crystal Palace and Brentford training pitch and is adjacent to the River Wandle. The stadium was chosen to host the 2007 and 2011 finals of the London Senior Cup. For a period at the end of the 2017/18 season and during 2018/19, Dulwich Hamlet F.C., played their home games at Imperial Fields whilst the club was in dispute with the owners of Champion Hill. The club also has an Academy scheme to develop talented 16 to 21-year-olds. This is run partly in association with Ernest Bevin College. ==Players== ===Current squad=== == Honours == *London Senior Cup **Winners (7): 1942‚Äì43, 1948‚Äì49, 1958‚Äì59, 1959‚Äì60, 2006‚Äì07, 2007‚Äì08, 2015‚Äì16 == Records == *FA Cup **Fourth Round 1975‚Äì76 *FA Trophy **Quarter Finals 1975‚Äì76 *FA Vase **Quarter Finals 2000‚Äì01 ==References== ==External links== * Category:Football clubs in London Category:Isthmian League Category:Sport in the London Borough of Merton Category:Association football clubs established in 1932 Category:Athenian League Category:1932 establishments in England Category:Football clubs in England ","title":"Tooting &amp; Mitcham United F.C."},{"id":"3233141","text":"Farandole dancing in Saint-Geni√®s-de-Comolas The farandole is an open-chain community dance popular in Provence, France. The farandole bears similarities to the gavotte, jig, and tarantella. The carmagnole of the French Revolution is a derivative. ==Traditional dance== The farandole was first described in detail by the English folklorist Violet Alford in 1932.Violet Alford (1932): The Farandole. Journal of the English Folk Dance and Song Society 1: 18‚Äì33. The following description is from the county of Nice: Traditionally led by the abbat-mage holding a ribboned halberd, the dancers hold hands and skip at every beat; strong beats on one foot, alternating left and right, with the other foot in the air, and weak beats with both feet together. In the village of Belv√©d√®re, on the occasion of the festival honoring patron Saint Blaise, the most recently married couple leads the dance. Musically, the dance is in time, with a moderate to fast tempo, and played by a flute and drum. ==Historical context== Folklorists of the early 20th century (e.g. Alford 1932) interpreted most folk dances as being very ancient, and postulated even for the farandole an ancestry traceable to ancient Greece, remaining more or less unchanged \\"during its two or three thousands years of life\\".Jean Baumel (1958): Les Danses populaires, les farandoles, les rondes, les jeux chor√©ographiques et les ballets du Languedoc m√©diterran√©en.

Esselte, Uppsala 1983 claim that the farandole is a medieval dance, but never provide an actual medieval quote mentioning the farandole. While there exist Renaissance descriptions of chain and circle dances, and medieval and renaissance iconography showing people dancing in chains and circles, there is no connection between these early dances and the recent folk farandole: Arbeau, the most well-known source for renaissance chain and circle dances such as the branle, does not contain any dance with farandole-specific steps and figures. The term \\"farandole\\" is not found in dictionaries of Old French or of Old Occitan \\"farandoulo\\", and the earliest appearance in the French form farandoule (as being derived from Occitan) is in 1776.Paul Robert, 2nd ed. rev. Alain Rey: Le Grand Robert de la langue francaise. Paris 1985, \\"Farandole\\" Its earliest appearance in English is even younger, 1876.J. Stainer & W. A. Barrett (eds.): A Dictionary of Musical Terms. London 1876, \\"Farandola\\" Consequently, the medieval dance researcher Robert Mullally concludes that there is no evidence that the modern folk farandole resembles any kind of medieval dance.Robert Mullally (2011): The Carole. A Study of a Medieval Dance. Ashgate Publishing Ltd., Burlington. page 35 ==In classical music== Farandole du ballet de Marseille (Farandole of the Ballet de Marseille) by . Charles Gounod used a farandole, set in front of the Arles Amphitheatre, to open the second act of his opera Mireille (1864). Georges Bizet features the farandole as the fourth and concluding movement of his second L'Arl√©sienne suite (1872). In Tchaikovsky's The Sleeping Beauty ballet (1890), the dames propose a farandole in the fourth scene of the second act. There is a farandole in Camille Saint-Sa√´ns' opera Les Barbares (1901), and a farandole is present in the classical saxophone piece Tableaux de Provence (1958) by Paule Maurice, the first movement of five. ==In popular culture== In the 1940 Abbott and Costello film, \\"A Night in the Tropics,\\" the movie ends with the singing and dancing of \\"The Farandola.\\" In 1969, a band by the name of \\"Love Sculpture\\" had an album entitled Forms & Feelings. One of the songs was \\"Farandole\\" by Georges Bizet. Bob James on his album \\"Two\\" performed Bizet's Farandole in a jazz funk style. Released in 1975, the album charted at number two on the Jazz Album Charts. During his time as a member of the 1980s metal band Talas, Billy Sheehan performed another rock cover of Bizet's \\"The Farandole\\", which was subsequently covered, in a similar manner by Dream Theater. The Majesty Demos 1985‚Äì1986; YtseJam Records Official Bootleg Series. In Madeleine L'Engle's A Wind in the Door, the Farandolae are fictional organelles of mitochondria, which have a similar endosymbiotic relationship with mitochondria, as mitochondria have with eukaryotic cells. Over the course of the novel, characters physically journey inside a mitochondrion and encounter the farandolae as sentient creatures that do circular \\"dances\\" around their \\"trees of origin\\" that drain the elder fara of energy. Within the Society for Creative Anachronism and other associations who attempt to recreate dances of the Middle Ages and Renaissance, the farandole is sometimes danced due to its assumed medieval origin (but see the historical concerns above).

He is best known for composing, writing and scoring the award-winning Jerry Springer: The Opera with book and additional lyrics co-written with Stewart Lee. Thomas collected the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Musical Score in 2004. Richard Thomas's comedy career began in 1987, doing a musical act on keyboards. In 2000, he wrote and performed a one-act opera called Tourette's Diva with four actors, which aired at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe. Thomas had the idea for an opera based on Jerry Springer at this time, and wrote it over the next two years, chiefly in workshops at Battersea Arts Centre. Thomas would offer a \\"Beer for an Idea\\", where any audience members submitting a good idea would be rewarded with a can of Foster's and poor ideas with a supermarket store brand. After a number of small scale performances of the first act, which was in much the same shape as it remains today, the second act (where the characters descend into hell) was vague and unformed. Thomas brought his friend Stewart Lee in to assist with the writing. Six months later, the opera was in a far more recognisable state, and was snapped up by the National Theatre. Thomas has also worked on BBC comedy shows such as Attention Scum and This Morning with Richard Not Judy. Starting on 25 February 2007, BBC Two aired his series, Kombat Opera Presents..., comprising five standalone musical parodies of well-known television programmes. Thomas wrote the libretto for Mark-Anthony Turnage's 2011 opera Anna Nicole, and co-wrote music for the 2010 film Uncle David as a part of the Avant-Garde Alliance. In 2013 Thomas was commissioned by London's LGBT choir The Pink Singers, to bring his humor to writing a piece celebrating the styles and techniques employed by a choir during performances.

It attracted mild controversy and censorship as a result of its portrayal of same-sex marriage. The episode first aired on January 18, 1996. ==Plot== Ross' ex-wife Carol (Jane Sibbett) and her lesbian life partner Susan (Jessica Hecht) are getting married; Ross' sister Monica caters the wedding. Carol's parents refuse to attend the wedding, leading Carol to doubt her decision, but Ross ‚Äì initially hesitant to see his ex-wife remarry ‚Äì finds himself in the position of being the one to encourage her to go ahead with the ceremony despite her parents' opposition. At the reception, Susan thanks Ross for his part in saving the wedding, and offers to dance with him; he agrees, apparently resolving their strained relationship. One of Phoebe's massage clients, Rose Adelman, dies on the massage table and her spirit apparently gets stuck inside Phoebe for a while. Rose, via Phoebe, corrects people's behavior and makes weird jokes using references to obscure people or events. Upon talking to Rose's husband, who states that Rose wanted to see everything, Phoebe takes Rose sightseeing around New York, but is not able to rid herself of Rose. However, during Carol and Susan's wedding, Rose blurts out that she has now seen everything and promptly bolts out of Phoebe's body. During the reception, Phoebe muses to Chandler about how she misses Rose; one of the wedding guests (Lea DeLaria), comically assuming that Phoebe and Rose were a lesbian couple, suggests that Phoebe find a way to forget about Rose and move on with her life, and offers to buy her a drink, which Phoebe accepts. Meanwhile, Rachel's mother, Sandra (Marlo Thomas), makes a major life decision after seeing how Rachel has learned to fend for herself: she is considering leaving Rachel's father. Rachel is horrified at the thought of her parents splitting up and angry at her mother, but Sandra admits she wants to do this because Rachel did not marry her Barry, the man she never loved, but she did hers. Rachel, stunned at this revelation, gives her mother her blessing to move on. Early on in the episode, Joey makes his first appearance on the long-running soap opera Days of Our Lives as Dr. Drake Ramoray. He shares with the group a \\"smell-the-fart\\" acting tip he had learned from the actress he did his first scene with. ==Reception== As a result of its portrayal of a lesbian couple marrying, the episode attracted some controversy across the United States.

Some 3,000 Black Loyalists were evacuated from New York to Nova Scotia; they were individually listed in the Book of Negroes as the British gave them certificates of freedom and arranged for their transportation.The Book of Negroes, Black Loyalists. The Crown gave them land grants and supplies to help them resettle in Nova Scotia. Some of the European Loyalists who emigrated to Nova Scotia brought their slaves with them, making for an uneasy society. One historian has argued that those slaves should not be regarded as Loyalists, as they had no choice in their fates.Barry Cahill, \\"The Black Loyalist Myth in Atlantic Canada\\", Acadiensis, University of New Brunswick Other Black Loyalists were evacuated to London or the Caribbean colonies. Thousands of African slaves escaped from plantations and fled to British lines, especially after British occupation of Charleston, South Carolina. When the British evacuated, they took many former slaves with them. Many ended up among London's Black Poor, with 4,000 resettled by the Sierra Leone Company to Freetown in Africa in 1787. Five years later, another 1,192 Black Loyalists from Nova Scotia chose to emigrate to Sierra Leone, becoming known as the Nova Scotian settlers in the new British colony of Sierra Leone. Both waves of settlers became part of the Sierra Leone Creole people and the founders of the nation of Sierra Leone. Thomas Jefferson referred to the Black Loyalists as \\"the fugitives from these States\\". While most Black Loyalists gained freedom, some did not. Those who were recaptured by slave traders were sold back into slavery and treated harshly for having served under the British. ==Background== Slavery in England had never been authorized by legal statutes. Villeinage, a form of semi-serfdom, was legally recognized but long obsolete. In 1772, a slave threatened with being taken out of England and returned to the Caribbean challenged the authority of his master in Somersett's case. Chief Justice Lord Mansfield ruled that slavery had no standing under common law and slave owners therefore were not permitted to transport slaves outside England and Wales against their will. Many observers took it to mean that slavery was ended in England. Lower courts often interpreted the ruling as determining that the status of slavery did not exist in England and Wales, but Mansfield had ruled more narrowly. The decision did not apply to the Thirteen Colonies and Caribbean colonies, where legislatures had passed laws to institutionalize slavery. A number of cases were presented to the English courts for the emancipation of slaves residing in England, and numerous American runaways hoped to reach England where they expected to gain freedom. American slaves began to believe that King George III was for them and against their masters as tensions increased before the American Revolution. Colonial slaveholders feared a British-inspired slave revolt, and Lord Dunmore wrote to Lord Dartmouth in early 1775 of his intention to take advantage of the situation. == Proclamations == === Lord Dunmore's Proclamation === In November 1775, Lord Dunmore issued the controversial Lord Dunmore's Proclamation. As Virginia's royal governor, he called on all able-bodied men to assist him in the defense of the colony, including slaves belonging to the Patriots. He promised such slave recruits freedom in exchange for service in the British Army. Within a month, about 800 former slaves had fled to Norfolk, Virginia to enlist. Outraged Virginia slave owners decreed that runaway slaves would be executed, and they also contradicted the British Army's promises by claiming that slaves who escaped to the British would be sold to sugar cane plantations in the West Indies. But many slaves were willing to risk their lives for a chance at freedom. Lord Dunmore's Proclamation was the first mass emancipation of slaves in America. The 1776 Declaration of Independence refers obliquely to the Proclamation by citing it as one of its grievances, that King George III had \\"excited domestic Insurrections among us\\". An earlier version of the Declaration was more explicit, stating the following of King George III, but these controversial details were dropped during the final development of the document in Congress. After the war began, a number of British generals issued proclamations calling for Loyalists to free their slaves so that they could join the undermanned British army and bolster its numbers. Among those issuing proclamations were John Murray, 4th Earl of Dunmore, Governor of Virginia, and Sir Henry Clinton. Jamaica's Governor John Dalling drafted a proposal in 1779 for the enlistment of a regiment of mulattoes and another regiment of free Negroes. ===Philipsburg Proclamation === With the arrival of 30,000 Hessian mercenary troops, the British did not have as much need of former slaves. Sir William Howe banned the formation of new Black regiments and disbanded his own. But freeing slaves of rebels still held value as economic warfare against the American so-called Patriots. In 1779, Sir Henry Clinton issued the Philipsburg Proclamation, expanding Lord Dunmore's Proclamation and promising freedom to any escaped slave of a Patriot. By contrast, the British often returned escaped slaves to Loyalist masters and requested the owner to refrain from punishment. In 1778 the Patriots promised freedom to escaped slaves of Loyalists. Many slaves who escaped to one side or the other, however, ended up being sold back into slavery. ==Evacuation and resettlement== When the British evacuated their troops from Charleston and New York after the war, they made good on their promises and took thousands of freed slaves with them. They resettled the freedmen in colonies in the Caribbean, such as Jamaica, and in Nova Scotia and Upper Canada, as well as transporting some to London. The Canadian climate and other factors made Nova Scotia difficult. In addition, the Poor Blacks of London, many former slaves, had trouble getting work. British activists ultimately founded Freetown in what became Sierra Leone on the coast of West Africa, as a place to resettle Black Loyalists from London and Canada, and Jamaican Maroons. Nearly 2,000 Black Loyalists left Nova Scotia to help found the new colony in Africa. ==Black Loyalist military units== Lord Dunmore's proclamation and others led to the formation of several Black regiments in the British army. The most notable were Dunmore's Ethiopian Regiment and Clinton's Black Company of Pioneers. Other regiments included the Jersey Shore Volunteers, the Jamaica Rangers, the Mosquito Shore Volunteers, and the Black Dragoons of the South Carolina Royalists. It was also common for Black Loyalists to serve the military in non-combat positions, such as the Black Company of Pioneers. ===Black Company of Pioneers and Guides and Pioneers=== The largest Black Loyalist regiment was the Black Company of Pioneers, better known as the \\"Black Pioneers\\" and later merged into the Guides and Pioneers. In the military terminology of the day, a \\"pioneer\\" was a soldier who built roads, dug trenches, and did other manual labor. These soldiers were typically divided into smaller corps and attached to larger armies. The Black Pioneers worked to build fortifications and other necessities, and they could be called upon to work under fire. They served under General Clinton in a support capacity in North Carolina, New York, Newport, Rhode Island, and Philadelphia. They did not sustain any casualties because they were never used in combat. In Philadelphia, their general orders to \\"attend the scavangers, assist in cleaning the streets & removing all newsiances being thrown into the streets\\". ===Ethiopian Regiment=== Lord Dunmore organized his 800 Black Loyalist volunteers into the Ethiopian Regiment. They trained in the rudiments of marching and shooting before engaging in their first conflict at the Battle of Kemp's Landing. The Patriot militia at Kemp's Landing was unprepared for the attack and retreated. Next, Dunmore led the Royal Ethiopians into the Battle of Great Bridge; Dunmore was overconfident and misinformed about the Patriot numbers, however, and the Patriots overwhelmed the British troops. After the battle, Dunmore loaded his Black troops onto ships of the British fleet, hoping to take the opportunity to train them better. The cramped conditions led to the spread of smallpox. By the time that Dunmore retreated to the Province of New York, only 300 of the original 800 soldiers had survived. ===Black Brigade=== The \\"Black Brigade\\" was a small combat unit of 24 in New Jersey led by Colonel Tye, a slave from Monmouth County, New Jersey who had escaped to British lines early in the war. The title of colonel was not an official military designation, as blacks were not formally commissioned as officers, but such titles were permitted in an unofficial capacity. Tye and the Black Brigade were the most feared Loyalists in New Jersey, and he led them in several raids from 1778 at the Battle of Monmouth to defending the British in occupied New York in the winter of 1779. Beginning in June 1780, Tye led several actions against Patriots in Monmouth County, and he was wounded in the wrist during a raid on a Patriot militia leader in September. Within weeks, he died from gangrene, and Black Pioneer leader Stephen Blucke took over the Black Brigade and led it through the end of the war.Jonathan D. Sutherland, African Americans at War, ABC-CLIO, 2003, pp. 420-421, accessed 4 May 2010 ==Postwar treatment== When peace negotiations began after the Battle of Yorktown, a primary issue of debate was the fate of Black British soldiers. Loyalists who remained in the United States wanted Black soldiers returned so their chances of receiving reparations for damaged property would be increased, but British military leaders fully intended to keep the promise of freedom made to Black soldiers despite the anger of the Americans. In the chaos as the British evacuated Loyalist refugees, particularly from New York and Charleston, many American slave owners attempted to recapture their former slaves. Some would capture any Black, including those born free before the war, and sell them into slavery. The US Congress ordered George Washington to retrieve any American property, including slaves, from the British, as stipulated by the Treaty of Paris (1783). Since Sir Guy Carleton intended to honour the promise of freedom, the British proposed a compromise that would compensate slave owners and provide certificates of freedom and the right to be evacuated to one of the British colonies to any Black person who could prove his service or status. The British transported more than 3,000 Black Loyalists to Nova Scotia, the greatest number of people of African descent to arrive there at any one time. One of their settlements, Birchtown, Nova Scotia was the largest free African community in North America for the first few years of its existence. Black Loyalists found the northern climate and frontier conditions in Nova Scotia difficult and were subject to discrimination by other Loyalist settlers, many of them slaveholders. In July 1784, Black Loyalists in Shelburne were targeted in the Shelburne Riots, the first recorded race riots in Canadian history. The Crown officials granted land to the Black Loyalists of lesser quality and that were more rocky and less fertile than that given to White Loyalists. In 1792, the British government offered Black Loyalists the chance to resettle in a new colony in Sierra Leone. The Sierra Leone Company was established to manage its development. Half of the Black Loyalists in Nova Scotia, nearly 1200, departed the country and moved permanently to Sierra Leone. They set up the community of \\"Freetown\\".Ferguson, William Stenner. Why I Hate Canadians, 1997. In 1793, the British transported another 3,000 Blacks to Florida, Nova Scotia and England as free men and women.Among them was Deborah Squash, a 20-year-old woman who had escaped from George Washington's plantation in 1779. She is described in the Book of Negroes as a \\"stout wench, thick lips, pock marked. Formerly slave to General Washington, came away about 4 years ago.\\" Their names were recorded in the Book of Negroes by General Carleton. Not all were so lucky. In the South, blacks were seen as easy targets, and planters often ignored their claims of freedom. Many British officers and Loyalists considered them to be spoils of war. When Britain ceded Florida to Spain, many of the freedmen, who had been transported there from the United States, were left behind when the British pulled out. However, the Spanish both offered freedom and the right to bear arms to blacks who would convert to Catholicism and encouraged slaves to escape to Florida. ==Descendants== Many descendants of Black loyalists have been able to track their ancestry by using General Carleton's Book of Negroes. The number of these descendants is unknown. ===Nova Scotia=== Reverend William Furmage, Old Burying Ground (Halifax, Nova Scotia), Huntingdonian Missionary to the Black Loyalists; established school for Black students in Halifax (1786) Jack C. Whytock. The Huntingdonian Missionaries to Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, c. 1785-1792 Jack C. Whytock. Historical Papers 2003: Canadian Society of Church History. Edited by Bruce L. Guenther, p.154. Between 1776 and 1785, around 3,500 Blacks were transported to Nova Scotia from the United States, part of a larger migration of about 34,000 Loyalist refugees. This massive influx of people increased the population by almost 60%, and led to the establishment of New Brunswick as its own colony in 1784. Most of the free Blacks settled at Birchtown, the largest Black township in North America at the time, next to the town of Shelburne, settled by whites. There are also a number of Black loyalists buried in unmarked graves in the Old Burying Ground (Halifax, Nova Scotia). A Black Loyalist wood cutter, at Shelburne, Nova Scotia, in 1788 Among, the descendants of the Black Loyalists are noted figures such as Rose Fortune, a Black woman living in Nova Scotia who became a police officer and a businesswoman. Measha Brueggergosman (n√©e Gosman), the Canadian opera and concert singer, is a New Brunswick native and descendant of a Black Loyalist through her father. In the closing days of the Revolution, along with British troops and other Black Loyalists, her paternal four-times-great-grandfather and grandmother left the colonies. They were resettled in Shelburne with their first child, who had been born free behind British lines in New York. ==Commemoration== The Black Loyalist settlement of Birchtown, Nova Scotia was declared a National Historic Site in 1997. A seasonal museum commemorating the Black Loyalists was opened in that year by the Black Loyalist Heritage Society. A memorial has been established at the Black Loyalist Burying Ground. Built around the historic Birchtown school and church, the museum was badly damaged by an arson attack in 2008 but rebuilt. The Society began plans for a major expansion of the museum to tell the story of the Black Loyalists in America, Nova Scotia and Sierra Leone.Black Loyalist Heritage Society website ===Sierra Leone=== Lawrence Hartshorne, d. 1822, a Quaker who was the chief assistant of John Clarkson in helping the Black Nova Scotian Settlers emigrate to Sierra Leone (1792), Old Burying Ground (Halifax, Nova Scotia) Canadian Biography Also see Hartshorne's portrait by Robert Field (painter) Find a Grave Some Black Loyalists were transported to London, where they struggled to create new lives. Sympathy for the black veterans who had fought for the British stimulated support for the Committee for the Relief of the Black Poor. This organization backed the resettlement of the black poor from London to a new British colony of Sierra Leone in West Africa. In addition, Black Loyalists in Nova Scotia were offered the opportunity to relocate, and about half chose to move to the new colony. Today the descendants of these pioneers are known as the Sierra Leone Creole people, or Krios. They live primarily in the Western Area of Freetown. Black Loyalists from the American South brought their languages to Freetown, such as Gullah from the Low Country and African American Vernacular English. Their lingua franca was a strong influence on the descendants of this community, who developed Krio as a language. Many of the Sierra Leone Creoles or Krios can trace their ancestry directly to their Black Loyalist ancestors. An example of such an ancestor is Harry Washington, likely born about 1740 in The Gambia, enslaved as a young man and shipped to Virginia. He was purchased by George Washington in 1763; he escaped about 1776 in Virginia to British lines, eventually making his way to New York. He was among free blacks evacuated to Nova Scotia by the British following the war.Black Loyalist website. He later took the opportunity to migrate to Freetown in Africa. There by 1800 he became the leader of a rebellion against colonial rule and faced a military tribunal. His descendants are part of the Creole population, who make up 5.8% of the total. == Notable Black Loyalists == * Stephen Blucke * David George * Abraham Hazeley * Boston King * John Kizell * John Marrant * Cato Perkins * Thomas Peters * Colonel Tye * Harry Washington ==In popular culture== * The saga of the Black Loyalists inspired Lawrence Hill's 2007 novel The Book of Negroes (published as someone knows my name in the United States).

He left home at 17, and began his career as a magician's assistant, becoming a leading actor in traveling tent shows in the American Midwest. He briefly established his own theater company in Memphis, Tennessee which included his father and stepmother, Ed and Anna Henderson. He went to Hollywood in 1931, when the film industry began producing movies with sound and needed \\"actors who could talk\\". His screen test at Warner Bros. was watched and appreciated by studio production chief Darryl F. Zanuck and, even more so, by director William Wellman who immediately wanted to cast Talbot. Talbot became a contract player at Warners along with future stars like Bette Davis and Humphrey Bogart. ==Career== ===Film === Most notable among Talbot's film work were his appearances in Three on a Match and 20,000 Years in Sing Sing (both 1932). He played a star running back in College Coach (1933) with Pat O'Brien and Dick Powell, romanced opera singer Grace Moore in One Night of Love in 1934, and pursued Mae West in Go West, Young Man (1936). He was a gangster in Ladies They Talk About and Heat Lightning and a doctor kicking a drinking habit in both Mary Stevens, M.D. and Mandalay. He co-starred with Pat O'Brien in Oil for the Lamps of China (1935). He would appear opposite Ann Dvorak, Carole Lombard, Barbara Stanwyck, Mary Astor, Ginger Rogers, Loretta Young, Glenda Farrell, Joan Blondell and Shirley Temple during his career, as well as sharing the screen with Humphrey Bogart, Spencer Tracy and Tyrone Power. Overall, Talbot would appear in some 150 movies. Early in his career at Warners, Talbot took part in one of Hollywood's most extravagant and ambitious publicity junkets, barnstorming across the country with Bette Davis, cowboy star Tom Mix, comedian Joe E. Brown, boxer Jack Dempsey and a host of WB actors and chorus girls on \\"the 42nd Street Special,\\" a train covered in silver and gold leaf and electric lights. With stops in dozens of cities, they were promoting the new Busby Berkeley musical and ended up in Washington, D.C. at Franklin Delano Roosevelt's first inauguration in March 1933 in a show of the studio's support for the new president. The press dubbed Talbot the train's \\"Romeo\\" and described him as \\"handsome as hell\\" and \\"likable as a collie.\\"\\"The Entertainer: Movies, Magic and My Father's Twentieth Century\\" by Margaret Talbot, Riverhead Books 2012 pp. 183-201. Back in Hollywood, working long hours six days a week, Talbot became a co-founder of the Screen Actors Guild. His activism in SAG union affairs reportedly hurt his career. Warner Bros. dropped him from its roster, and Talbot seldom received starring roles again. He became a capable character actor, playing affable neighbors or crafty villains with equal finesse. Talbot's supporting roles spanned the gamut, as he played cowboys, pirates, detectives, cops, surgeons, psychiatrists, soldiers, judges, newspaper editors, storekeepers, and boxers. In later years, he would claim to have never rejected a single role offered to him, including three now infamous Ed Wood, films: Glen or Glenda, Jail Bait and Plan 9 from Outer Space. Talbot worked with the Three Stooges in Gold Raiders, was the first actor to portray evil scientist Lex Luthor (wearing a \\"bald cap\\") onscreen in Atom Man vs. Superman (1950), played villains in four comedies with The Bowery Boys, and took the role of Commissioner Gordon in the 1949 serial Batman and Robin. His last film role was in Amazon Women on the Moon (1987). === Stage === Having started his career in the theater and later co-starred on Broadway in 1940-1941 in Separate Rooms with Glenda Farrell and Alan Dinehart, Talbot returned to the stage in the 1960s and 1970s, starring in national road company versions of Thornton Wilder's The Matchmaker with Ann B. Davis, Gore Vidal's The Best Man with Hugh Marlowe and K.T. Stevens, Neil Simon's The Odd Couple and Barefoot in the Park, Arthur Sumner Long's play Never Too Late with Penny Singleton, and appearing as Captain Brackett in a 1967 revival of South Pacific (at Lincoln Center) starring Florence Henderson and Giorgio Tozzi. He also starred in Preston Jones' \\"The Last Meeting of the Knights of the White Magnolia\\" at the Alley Theater in Houston and the Chicago area Lincolnshire Theater. He rode the wave of the dinner theater phenomenon in the 1970s, acting in light comedies onstage in various Midwestern towns where former television actors were major attractions. As early as 1962, Talbot directed and co-starred with Ozzie and Harriet Nelson and a young Sally Kellerman in \\"Marriage Go Round,\\" a play Talbot and the Nelsons took on the road again in the early 1970s. ===Television=== Although Talbot once starred in a film called Trapped by Television (1936), the invention of TV actually revived his acting career, as his movie roles faded. Talbot was a frequent presence on American television from the 1950s well into the 1970s with occasional appearances in the 1980s. From 1955‚Äì1966, he appeared in some seventy episodes of The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet, as neighbor Joe Randolph. He also had a recurring role (1955‚Äì58) as Robert Cummings's character's buddy from the Air Force, Paul Fonda, in numerous episodes of The Bob Cummings Show. During the 1950s/1960s, Talbot acted in every genre from westerns to comedies to mysteries. He played Colonel Billings three times on the syndicated western series, The Adventures of Kit Carson (1951‚Äì1955), and appeared four times as a judge on the syndicated western The Cisco Kid. He guest starred on Gene Autry's The Range Rider. From 1950‚Äì1955, he was cast five times in different roles on the western, The Lone Ranger. In 1955, he appeared as Baylor in six episodes of the series, Commando Cody: Sky Marshal of the Universe. From 1953‚Äì1957, he was cast as different characters in four episodes of the anthology series, Lux Video Theatre. In 1967, he played Colonel Blake three times on The Beverly Hillbillies, and also appeared three times (between 1965‚Äì1971) on Green Acres. On one episode of Green Acres Talbot played himself, as a senator, in a spoof on actors who became politicians. In 1959, Talbot played Sheriff Clyde Chadwick in the episode \\"The Sanctuary\\" on Colt .45. Other guest appearances included: Annie Oakley; It's a Great Life; The Public Defender; The Pride of the Family; Crossroads; Hey, Jeannie!; The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show; Broken Arrow; The Millionaire; Richard Diamond, Private Detective; Tales of Wells Fargo; Buckskin; Cimarron City; Angel; Hawaiian Eye; 77 Sunset Strip; Surfside 6; The Roaring 20s; The Restless Gun; Stagecoach West; The Red Skelton Show; The Lucy Show, The Adventures of Wild Bill Hickok; Topper; The Adventures of Rin Tin Tin; Laredo; Perry Mason; The Real McCoys; Rawhide; Wagon Train; Charlie's Angels; Newhart; The Dukes of Hazzard; St. Elsewhere; and Who's the Boss?. He appeared occasionally on television in his eighties and narrated two PBS biographies, The Case of Dashiell Hammett and World Without Walls about pioneering pilot Beryl Markham, both produced and written by his son, Stephen Talbot, formerly a recurring cast member, Gilbert Bates, on Leave It to Beaver, another series on which his father had also appeared. Talbot was the first live action actor to play two prominent DC Comics characters on-screen: the aforementioned Commissioner Gordon in Batman and Robin, and supervillain Lex Luthor in Atom Man vs. Superman (who at the time was simply known as Luthor). Talbot began a longstanding tradition of actors in these roles that were most recently filled by Gary Oldman and Kevin Spacey, respectively. ==Personal life== Talbot had several brief marriages, to Elaine Melchoir (1930), Marguerite Cramer (1937‚Äì40) Abigail Adams (1942) and Keven McClure (1946)Margaret Talbot. The Entertainer (2012) and a number of romantic entanglements. In 1948, he married for the fifth time, to actress and singer Paula (n√©e Margaret) Epple. She was 20, and he was a 46-year-old actor with a drinking problem. Under Epple's influence, Talbot quit drinking. The couple had four children and they worked together on stage in summer stock and community theater. They remained married for more than forty years until her death in 1989. Three of their four children became writers or journalists. Only Cynthia Talbot, the elder daughter, did not. She is a family physician and residency director in Portland, Oregon. * Stephen Talbot was for many years a reporter and documentary producer for KQED-TV in San Francisco and for the PBS series Frontline and \\"Frontline World\\" and became the executive producer of Sound Tracks: Music Without Borders. As a child actor, he played Gilbert on the hit television show Leave it to Beaver. * David Talbot is an author (\\"Brothers\\" about John F. and Robert F. Kennedy and \\"Season of the Witch\\" about San Francisco in the 1960s and 1970s) and the founder and editor of Salon.com. * Margaret Talbot of The New Yorker who wrote about her father's long career beginning in pre-Code Hollywood, why he never became a big star, and his role in founding the Screen Actors Guild, in her magazine's edition of October 1, 2012. ==Death== On March 6, 1996, Talbot died at his home in San Francisco, California, aged 94, from congestive heart failure. ==Filmography== { class= - !

Clar√≠n, 17 March 2009 ==Origins== The party was formed by Alejandro Biondini in 1990 as the Partido Nacionalista de los Trabajadores (Nationalist Worker's Party), initially as a breakaway from the Justicialist Party.'Kalki y las camisas negras' The party leader anticipated economic crisis in the country which he felt would set up the basis for a takeover by revolutionary nationalism.D. Gatti, 'Cybernetic Neo-Nazis' Biondini is a veteran of the international neo-nazi scene, having established a group called Alerta Nacional in 1984, which he described as 'a small part of the great worldwide socialist movement'. This group has attempted to build links between the country's various extreme right groups.'\\"Neo\\" Nazismo en Am√©rica Latina' ==Development== The party was re-launched as the New Triumph Party in November 1997, identifying itself as 'the political, militant and electoral expression of Argentine national socialism'. At a time when use of the internet by fringe political groups was limited but growing in popularity the New Triumph Party's online publication Libertad de Opini√≥n (Freedom of Opinion) broke new ground in Argentina by providing a regular forum for Argentine neo-Nazism and anti- Semitism. Ricardo Brinzoni was briefly associated with the group as his lawyer Juan Enrique Torres Bande was a member. 'Nuevo Triunfo de Brinzoni' The party has consistently attempted to gain legal recognition but has been rejected. Nonetheless, in the 2005 Argentine legislative election two members of the party, Biondini's wife and son, featured as candidates for Acci√≥n Ciudadana, a group headed by Jorge Colotto, the general commissioner of the Polic√≠a Federal Argentina.Carnota, Fernando (1995), El Palacio de la Corrupci√≥n, Buenos Aires: Editorial Sudamericana. ==Ideology== The party supports Neo-Nazism and seeks to use Argentina as the new Nazi base. It has been claimed that Biondini believes that Adolf Hitler had identified Argentina as the future of Nazism. He has claimed that in the final days in the F√ºhrerbunker Hitler pointed to Argentina on a map and stated that 'from there the new leader will come'. The party has also been vocal in its criticism of the major political parties and leaders, denouncing Fernando de la R√∫a as a puppet of the Zionist Occupation Government. As part of this rhetoric it also emphasises its grounding in Christianity.Programme of Government ==Platform== The ideas of the party have been summed up by them in declaration of policies which states five aims for the Argentine people. These are listed as: * The reaffirmation of the values of Argentina, based on God and country with a firm stance taken against all who would seek to damage these values. * Dignity for the Argentine worker, through the establishment of a corporatist parliament. * Defence of national sovereignty at all costs, with a systematic programme of rearmament in order to recover the Falkland Islands and Patagonia. * The establishment of a purely Argentine economic system which would eliminate usury and unite classes under corporatism. * A much stricter legal code, including punishments for those it feels have benefitted from Argentina's struggles. ==References== ==External links== * Official site * Flags of the PNT * Interview with Biondini Category:2009 disestablishments in Argentina Category:Antisemitism in Argentina Category:Fascism in Argentina Category:Christian political parties Category:Neo-Nazism in South America Category:Neo-Nazi political parties Category:Political parties established in 1990 Category:1990 establishments in Argentina Category:Defunct political parties in Argentina Category:Banned far- right parties Category:Political parties disestablished in 2009 Category:Peronist parties and alliances in Argentina Category:Third Position Category:Far-right political parties ","title":"New Triumph Party"},{"id":"3233223","text":"A'ali burial mounds. Map showing the locations of the ancient burial mounds. The Dilmun Burial Mounds () are a UNESCO World Heritage Site comprising necropolis areas on the main island of Bahrain dating back to the Dilmun and the Umm al-Nar culture. Bahrain has been known since ancient times as an island with a very large number of burials, the (originally) quite a number of square kilometres of mounds were said to be one of the largest cemeteries in the ancient world. The cemeteries are concentrated in the north of the island, on the hard stony areas slightly above the arable farming soils ‚Äì the south of the island is mainly sandy and desert-like. Recent studies have shown that the estimated/approximately 350,000 ancient grave mounds could have been solely produced by the local population over a number of thousands of years. The graves are not all of the same era, or of exactly the same styles, and can vary considerably in size in different areas of the moundfield. Research, under the auspices of the Bahrain National Museum (with the Bahrain Historical and Archaeological Society taking a keen interest), is still continuing, to establish a firm timeline for all these variations and continuations, as well as considering the implications for the society or societies that produced them. ==Excavations== Between Sunday the 10th and Tuesday the 19th of February 1889, some of the mounds were excavated by the British explorer J. Theodore Bent and his wife Mabel Bent. According to the diary of Mrs Bent they found ‚Äú‚Ä¶ bits of ivory, charcoal, ostrich eggshell‚Ä¶‚Äù. The Travel Chronicles of Mrs J. Theodore Bent, Vol 3, 2010, page 22. Oxford: Archaeopress. These finds are now in the British Museum, London.For the Bents‚Äô finds at A‚Äôali: https://research.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=3190900&partId;=1&searchText;=A%27ali&images;=true&view;=list&page;=1. Theodore Bent published his results in two articles,The Mounds of Bahrein, Athen√¶um, 1889, Issue 3219 (Jul), 38; The Bahrein Islands, in the Persian Gulf, Proceedings of the Royal Geographical Society and Monthly Record of Geography, Vol. 12 (1) (Jan 1890), 1-19, but a more extended account appeared in the Bents' book Southern Arabia (1900).See Chapter 2, Southern Arabia by Theodore and Mabel Bent, 1900. London: Smith, Elder and Co. A Danish group in the 1950s was excavating at Qal'at al-Bahrain, the capital city of the Bronze Age, when they opened some tumuli and discovered items dating to around 4100‚Äì3700 BP of the same culture. Many others began to excavate more of the graves, providing a view of the construction and content on these graves.Flemming H√∏jlund, 2007, The Burial Mounds of Bahrain: Social Complexity in Early Dilmun.Crawford, 2016, Dilmun Temple At Saar. ===Chambers (tumuli)=== Each of the tumuli is composed of a central stone chamber that is enclosed by a low ring-wall and covered by earth and gravel. The size of the mounds varies, but the majority of them measure 15 by 30 ft (4.5 by 9 m) in diameter and are 3‚Äì6 ft (1‚Äì2 m) high. The smaller mounds usually contain only one chamber. The chambers are usually rectangular with one or two alcoves at the northeast end. Occasionally there are additional pairs of alcoves along the middle of the larger chambers. Although the chambers usually contained one burial each, some contain several people and the secondary chambers often contain none. The deceased were generally laid with their heads in the alcove end of the chamber and lying on their right sides. The bodies were accompanied by few items. There were a few pieces of pottery and occasionally shell or stone stamp seals, baskets sealed with asphalt, ivory objects, stone jars, and copper weapons. The skeletons are representative of both sexes with a life expectancy of approximately 40 years. Babies were generally buried at and outside the ring-wall. The average number of children per family was 1.6 persons. ===Conservation controversies=== Attempts to protect the burial mounds have run into opposition by religious fundamentalists who consider them unIslamic and have called for them to be concreted over for housing. During a parliamentary debate on 17 July 2005, the leader of the Salafist al Asalah party, Sheikh Adel Mouwda, said \\"Housing for the living is better than the graves for the dead. We must have pride in our Islamic roots and not some ancient civilisation from another place and time, which has only given us a jar here and a bone there.\\" == See also == * List of archaeological sites in Bahrain ==References== Category:Archaeological sites in Bahrain Category:Tourism in Bahrain Category:World Heritage Sites in Bahrain ","title":"Dilmun Burial Mounds"},{"id":"3233227","text":"The Hualapai Mountains (Mojave language: Amat 'Avii KahuwaalyMunro, P et al.

Hiking trails reach Aspen and Hayden Peaks. Several areas, including Ghett's and Hayden Peaks, are home to radio transmitter/receiver towers. ==Habitat== The Hualapai Mountains are covered in pine trees, namely pinyon pine. Above the ponderosa pine appear. Most pine trees are found on the cooler north facing slopes. The habitat is mainly forest, and has many natural springs. The ecology of the Hualapai Mountains is comparable to that of the San Bernardino Mountains and San Jacinto Mountains in southern California, with major forests of many conifer species, as well as aspen groves at higher elevations. The higher elevations of the Hualapai Mountains support Madrean Sky Islands habitats. Bear, elk, mule deer, mountain lion, javelina, and other animals can be found here.

The Pinion Pine community has two fire stations with one station staffed full-time.\\"Hualapai Mountain Park\\", Mohave County Parks Department ===Pine Lake=== At the top of the Hualapai Mountain, just past the Hualapai Mountain Park, is a community known as Pine Lake. The community has approximately 140 homes and is a little over . in elevation. Several amenities are located in Pine lake, including the Hualapai Mountain Resort. The 'Pine Lake' community has a volunteer fire department, which also holds seasonal events for the neighborhood. There is a lodge, privately owned cabins for rent, and permanent housing. The lake is privately owned by the Pine Lake Inn Bed and Breakfast and not available to the public. Pine Lake is visited regularly by a local herd of elk, and many mule deer wander around daily. ==Off-road trails== From the Pine Lake Community there are a number of dirt roads that lead out into the mountains. There are primarily two main routes out of the community, Flag Mine Road and the ATV trail head located at Hualapai Mountain Park which alleviates some of the traffic in the neighborhood. From Flag Mine Road one can access many different routes along the ridges of the Hualapai Mountains and through the various valleys, canyons and washes. Continuing out Flag Mine Road, along the ridges of the mountains, over elevation. there are a number of routes going off the road, including the Moss Wash Basin. At the end of Flag Mine Road is the Boreana Mine, and the route to Yucca.

The episode premiered on NBC on January 28, 1996, as the lead-out for NBC's telecast of Super Bowl XXX. The main storyline of the episode follows Ross, who learns that his former pet monkey Marcel had been employed for a film being shot in New York City, and then tries to get a role in said film as a ploy to reunite with the monkey. Citing previous failures in the high-profile post-Super Bowl timeslot, NBC deliberately decided against premiering a new series, and instead chose to schedule a high-profile episode of an existing, popular series. It was part of an effort by the network to achieve the \\"highest-grossing ad-revenue day in television history.\\" The episode featured many guest stars, including Brooke Shields, Chris Isaak, Julia Roberts, Jean-Claude Van Damme, Fred Willard, and Dan Castellaneta. With 52.925 million viewers and a 47 percent audience share, \\"The One After the Superbowl\\" was the most-watched episode of the series, and is the highest-rated Super Bowl lead-out program of all time. The episode itself received mixed reviews, with some critics arguing that the excessive number of guest stars dampened the episode's quality (with several reviews making comparisons to The Love Boat), but others praising it for its funnier moments. Brooke Shields was considered a standout among the guest stars; impressed by her performance, NBC would cast her in the starring role of its new sitcom Suddenly Susan. ==Plot== After seeing a monkey in a beer commercial that reminds him of his former pet monkey Marcel, Ross decides to pay a visit to his old pet at the San Diego Zoo during his business trip to California. When Ross cannot find the monkey, the zoo administrator (Fred Willard) tells him that Marcel has died. However, a janitor (Dan Castellaneta) later informs Ross that Marcel was kidnapped and forced into show business and is currently filming a movie in New York. Meanwhile, Joey has to contend with a mentally ill stalker (Brooke Shields) who delusionally thinks that Joey is actually Dr. Drake Ramoray, the character he plays on Days of Our Lives. Despite this, Joey goes on a date with her. She later confronts him when she suspects \\"Drake\\" is cheating on her with another woman (actually another character in the soap opera). He tells her he is just an actor, but when she does not believe him, the others claim that Joey is \\"Drake\\"'s evil twin \\"Hans\\", in order to get her to leave him alone. Phoebe dates Rob (Chris Isaak) who hires her to perform at children's concerts at a local library. However, the songs she sings to the children are disturbing to the attending parents because they tell truths that the children have never heard before. When Rob's attempts to convince Phoebe to tone down her material for her next performances fail, he is forced to fire her, but the children then come to Central Perk to listen to more of Phoebe's songs. Ross, hoping for a reunion with Marcel, looks for him on the movie set. Joey meanwhile, sucks up to the production assistant to land a part in the movie. While on set, Chandler meets his old childhood friend Susie \\"Underpants\\" Moss (Julia Roberts) working on the production, with whom he has a colored history; when they were in elementary school, Chandler pulled up Susie's skirt when she was on stage, revealing her panties to the entire school. They arrange a date, Chandler unsuspecting that it is a plot to get revenge. After convincing him to wear her panties, Susie leaves him wearing nothing but the panties in a bathroom stall in the restaurant where they are having dinner. Meanwhile, Monica (Courteney Cox) and Rachel meet the movie's star Jean-Claude Van Damme, and compete for his attention. This creates tension between them, as they both argue over who should get to date him. They both dump him when he tries to convince them to have a threesome with Drew Barrymore. Ross finally reunites with Marcel and Joey lands a small role in the movie, but loses his solitary line after overacting. ==Production== Actress Julia Roberts guest starred in the episode as Susie. The first part of \\"The One After the Superbowl\\" was written by Mike Sikowitz and Jeffrey Astrof, and the second part by Michael Borkow. Both parts were directed by Michael Lembeck. On January 28, 1996, the day the episode aired, executive producer Kevin S. Bright commented: \\"It'll be bigger in size and scope than a regular Friends episode. Tonight we go one step beyond.\\" At the beginning of January 1996, it was confirmed that Julia Roberts, Brooke Shields, Chris Isaak and Jean-Claude Van Damme would all guest star in \\"The One After the Superbowl\\". Actors and comedians Fred Willard and Dan Castellaneta also made minor guest appearances in the episode, as the zookeeper and the zoo janitor respectively. Bright commented that Shields' performance was \\"a little into silly land\\" at first, but it \\"eventually turned in a very funny performance.\\" Shields commented that when she was asked to appear on the show, she \\"said yes basically sight unseen. I don't know where I was on the list. Maybe everybody else said no.\\" The writers had difficulty devising jokes that would be funny when Van Damme said them. In order to create \\"Van Damme-proof\\" jokes, one writer \\"would say them in a really horrible French accent, putting the emphasis on the wrong word\\". If people laughed, Van Damme was given the joke to perform. One line created in this way was Van Damme's \\"I can crack a walnut with my butt.\\" Roberts recorded her scenes from January 6‚Äì8, 1996. She had a relationship with cast member Matthew Perry at the time and an audience member said about their on-screen kiss, \\"Julia looked at Matt and said 'I'm glad we rehearsed this over the weekend'.\\" A sound recordist commented: \\"I've seen screen kisses before but this was the best. They really went at it.\\" Roberts thought her appearance on the show was \\"the most nerve-wracking thing\\" she had done since auditioning for Pretty Woman. \\"I wanted to be the best I could be. [Perry] is incredibly funny, and you want to inspire that same kind of joy that he does. Then at a certain point at lunch, you go, 'Well, it ain't gonna happen. I'll just try to be cute.'\\" The decision to air the episode directly after Super Bowl XXX was made by NBC in hopes of making that Sunday the \\"highest-grossing ad-revenue day in television history.\\" The guest stars were cast to draw more viewers and further increase the advertising revenue. In past years, networks had \\"exploited\\" the post-Super Bowl time slot to launch new series. NBC made an exception with Friends because they believed it would attract more advertising revenue than a new show. Curt King, press manager for Friends, commented: \\"Try to think of the new shows that were premiered after recent Super Bowls and name one that's still around. What we decided to do this year was not to unveil a new show but give people an extra-special version of a show they already like a lot.\\" ==Reception== \\"The One After the Superbowl\\" is the most-watched episode in the history of Friends, with a total of 52.9 million viewers tuned in after the Super Bowl ended. The episode generated a 29.5 Nielsen rating and a 47 percent audience share, making it the highest-rated episode of any show ever (scripted or otherwise) to debut after the Super Bowl. The advertising rates for \\"The One After the Superbowl\\" averaged $600,000 for 30 seconds of commercial time. This was one of the largest advertising rates ever for a sitcom at the time. The episode's director, Michael Lembeck, won the 1996 Emmy Award in the \\"Outstanding Individual Achievement in Directing for a Comedy Series\\" category for this episode, the only Emmy won by Friends that year. Guest star Jean-Claude Van Damme played himself in the episode, but his performance was not well- received.\\"The One After the Superbowl\\" received mixed reviews from television critics. Lisa Davis of the Fort Worth Star-Telegram called the guest appearances \\"a blatant ploy to boost ratings.\\" The Charlotte Observer's Tim Goodman said the episode's \\"pathetic infusion of 'star appeal'\\" made him \\"nauseous\\" and commented that the producers \\"should just make Bernie Kopell a regular and turn it into the Love Boat all over again.\\" Diane Holloway of the Austin American-Statesman also noted the similarities with the television series Love Boat, known for its many guest stars: \\"[The episode] had a couple of chuckles, but came off like a young Love Boat.\\" Entertainment Weekly called the episode \\"fragmented, poorly paced, and only sporadically funny. Cramming the already crowded ensemble with celebs may have been a ratings grabber ... but the results are forced sitcomedy and stilted acting,\\" specifically citing Van Damme. Colin Jacobson of DVD Movie Guide wrote that the episode \\"feels like nothing more than a big stunt to follow the big game.\\" He went on to say that the cameos of Willard and Castellaneta \\"offers easily the best parts of the program.\\" Shields was praised for her performance. Alan Pergament of The Buffalo News said she \\"showed a different side and was the best guest star\\" in the episode. Peter Marks of The New York Times commented that Shields' performance was \\"so edgy and unbridled\\" that she \\"stole the episode\\" from Roberts and Isaak. Jae-Ha Kim of the Chicago Sun-Times wrote that the chemistry between Perry and Roberts was \\"authentic\\" and that Shields \\"may have found her niche as a sitcom queen.\\" Her performance in the episode impressed NBC so much that she was offered her own sitcom, Suddenly Susan, for the network's 1996 fall lineup. In discussion of Shields performance, Joanne Ostrow of The Denver Post noted that she \\"did a nice turn to help her stalled career.\\" She went on to say that Roberts' appearance was \\"to little effect\\". Ostrow commented that the Monica and Rachel storyline \\"was evidence of unfunny, lazy writing.\\" Kim, however, thought the storyline offered some \\"funny moments.\\" Ostrow was complimentary of cast members Lisa Kudrow and David Schwimmer's performances. \\"Lisa Kudrow, as Phoebe, singer of truthful folk songs, continues to be a Friends highlight and David Schwimmer can carry off amusing, emotionally tinged moments even opposite a monkey.\\" DVD Talk's Earl Cressey named the episode one of the highlights of the second season of Friends. Hal Boedeker of The Orlando Sentinel praised \\"The One After the Superbowl\\" for being better than most episodes of Friends and \\"pleasantly off- the-wall and in keeping with the Friends spirit.\\" The authors of Friends Like Us: The Unofficial Guide to Friends wrote that there are \\"some lovely moments of slapstick\\" in the episode. They called Roberts \\"a fine guest-star\\", while Van Damme was \\"embarrassing\\". Pergament said \\"The One After the Superbowl\\" \\"had its moments\\", but he thought it felt more like an episode of Seinfeld than an episode of Friends. The Houston Chronicles Ann Hodges gave the episode a more negative review, commenting that the Friends writers \\"dropped the ball\\" with it: \\"Women's underwear, three-way-sex jokes, and a monkey ‚Äî that was it. The insipid, stupid script was an insult to guest stars like Julia Roberts and Jean-Claude Van Damme.\\" ==References== ==External links== *\\"The One After the Superbowl: Part 1\\" at the Internet Movie Database *\\"The One After the Superbowl: Part 1\\" at TV.com *\\"The One After the Superbowl: Part 2\\" at the Internet Movie Database *\\"The One After the Superbowl: Part 2 at the TV.com Category:1996 American television episodes Category:Friends (season 2) episodes Category:Super Bowl lead-out shows Category:Emmy Award-winning episodes ","title":"The One After the Superbowl"},{"id":"3233234","text":"A.

Alexander Kazbegi studied in Tbilisi, Saint Petersburg and Moscow, but on returning home, decided to become a shepherd to experience the lives of the local people.

After his death in Tbilisi, his coffin was carried across the Jvari Pass to his hometown of Kazbegi (now renamed Stepantsminda), which also preserves his childhood home as a museum in his honor. His most famous work, the novel The Patricide is about a heroic Caucasian bandit named Koba, who, much like Robin Hood, is a defender of the poor. Koba has nothing but contempt for authority, a proclivity towards violence, and a firm belief in vengeance. Kazbegi's work was a major inspiration to Iosif Jughashvili, later known as Joseph Stalin, who used Koba as a revolutionary pseudonym. ==References== * The Prose of the Mountains: Tales of the Caucasus, translated by Rebecca Ruth Gould (Budapest: Central European University Press, CEUP Classics series, 2015). * Bullock, Allen.

This strip did not sell, however. In 1958, Harry Elmlark, \\"an agent from the George Matthew Adams Service\\", asked DC Comics editor Jack Schiff for a science- fiction comic to be adapted into strip form, to capitalize on American interest in the Space race in the wake of the previous year's launch of Sputnik. Schiff rejected Space Busters and then either collaborated in the creation of a new strip, or simply encouraged Kirby and Wood to produce \\"a strip that dealt with rocket launchings, moon shots, and general story lines just a little ahead of current developments in the news.\\"Schiff, quoted in: Ro, Ronin. Tales to Astonish: Jack Kirby, Stan Lee and the American Comic Book Revolution (Bloomsbury, 2004) ===Creation=== Wally Wood's first wife Tatjana Wood recalled in the Wood biography Wally's World that it was Jack Kirby who sought out the famous science-fiction artist to collaborate on Sky Masters. Wallace Wood had proven to be American comics' best science-fiction artist through his landmark work on EC's Weird Science, Weird Fantasy and Wood was invited by Will Eisner to collaborate on the Outer Space Spirit newspaper series. By the time Kirby was thinking about a space strip, Wood had given up comic book work for higher-paying magazine and advertising work, including Mad and illustrating top science-fiction authors in Galaxy, Worlds of If, and other magazines and books. But Wally Wood was happy to accept Kirby's invitation. With art samples and story outline approved by Elmlark, Kirby penciled the strip, which was initially written by brothers Dick & Dave Wood and inked by the unrelated Wally Wood; at that same time, Dave Wood was also working with Kirby on the Showcase Comics issues of Kirby's \\"Challengers of the Unknown\\" feature for DC Comics, and Wally Wood would later ink issues #2-8 of Kirby's Challengers of the Unknown comic book series during the last half of 1958 and the first half of 1959. Once Kirby and Schiff got into a dispute, Wally Wood moved on to other projects. Later Sky Masters strips were written by Kirby, and inked by Dick Ayers, with the final month penciled and inked by Kirby alone. Ayers described in participation in a 1996 interview: === Conflict === Dave Wood promised Schiff \\"a percentage for arranging the deal,\\" which Kirby allegedly assumed was a one-time payment but that Schiff understood to be on-going. In Spring 1958, pre-publication, Kirby verbally agreed to pay Schiff an ongoing percentage, in large part to safeguard his (Kirby's) lucrative relationship with DC. But confusion over whether the percentage should come from gross or net income (and the apparent expectation that Kirby would personally cover the strip's production costs) strained the relationship between Kirby and Schiff. Kirby also butted heads with writer Dave Wood, requesting a higher percentage of the royalties, ostensibly to cover costs of paying Wally Wood for inking. When Kirby threatened to leave the strip, Schiff implied Kirby should ink himself, and noted that Wood required money to pay his brother, Dick, who was helping with the writing. On April 15, 1958, Schiff drew up a formal agreement documenting the royalty cuts between Kirby and Wood, and also Schiff himself (4%). By July, Schiff requested a higher percentage before the strip debuted on September 8, 1958 in \\"over three hundred newspapers.\\" With the arrival of the first royalty checks, the Wood brothers sent money to Schiff, but Kirby refused, leading to tension between himself and DC. In an attempt to defuse the situation, Kirby attempted to buy Schiff out of the contract, reiterating the feeling that Schiff was only due a onetime payment rather than an ongoing percentage of the royalties. ===Legal challenge=== Schiff refused the offer, and subsequently fired Kirby from Challengers of the Unknown, claiming that ideas from the Challengers story conferences were finding their way into Kirby's Sky Masters work. On December 11, 1958, Kirby discovered that Schiff was suing both him and the Woods for breach of contract, and counter-sued Schiff. Kirby claimed that Schiff was merely an editor who had \\"assigned him, the Wood brothers, and Eddie Herron freelance work,\\" that Kirby and the Woods had visited Elmlark without Schiff, that Schiff was not involved in the agency agreement, but that he and the Woods had offered Schiff a gift. Kirby further alleged that Schiff had implied that not paying his demands would lead to Kirby losing work at DC. Schiff's lawyer Myron Shapiro questioned Kirby at trial, and confirmed that Schiff had not verbalised such threats. Jack Liebowitz (executive vice president and general manager of National/DC) testified on Schiff's behalf, and the signed agreement promising Schiff an ongoing percentage led to Schiff being successful after a \\"very short trial at the supreme court in White Plains, New York\\". Kirby left then \\"market leader\\" DC, and returned to work for Atlas Comics, but continued to draw Sky Masters until early 1961.Ro, Ronin.

Belgrave's great-grandfather was Admiral James Richard Dacres who commanded HMS Guerriere as a captain in 1812.Sir Charles Belgrave's Autobiography, Personal Column, p. 214. (1960) ==Recruitment by Bahrain== In the early 1920s the British in Bahrain were concerned to secure the political stability of the island. In 1923 Shaikh Isa ibn Ali Al Khalifa, nearly 80 years old, was induced to hand over power to his son Shaikh Hamad and a series of administrative reforms were carried out. After a succession of Political Agents it became apparent that a permanent administrator should be found who would ensure some political continuity. Shaikh Hamad agreed to appoint a Personal Adviser employed by himself and not by the British Government, who would help him to modernise the state. There were no readily available candidates and the post was advertised in The Times in August 1925. It is not known how many applicants there were, but after interviews Charles Belgrave was appointed with an annual salary of ¬£720 ‚Äì enough for him to get married on. During the war he had served with the Frontiers Districts Administration Imperial Camel Corps and had spent two years in the oasis of Siwa Oasis. At the time of his appointment he was on leave after two years in the Colonial Service in Tanganyika. He brushed up his Arabic at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London and arrived in Bahrain in March 1926, to remain there until 1957. In Bahrain, he was commonly referred to as Al Mustashar (), \\"the Advisor\\". To his family and friends, he was known as \\"Carol\\". ==Achievements in Bahrain== Amongst his many achievements in Bahrain, Belgrave was responsible for the establishment of a system of civil and criminal courts, a functioning and well trained police service, general and widely available education, municipal authorities and political support for the exploration for oil. It was largely the energy of Belgrave in support of the search for oil that put Bahrain ahead of other gulf states in being the first to discover oil in 1932. Belgrave understood the importance of trade and was the driving force behind the creation of the 'Bab Al Bahrain' (Gateway to Bahrain) structure at the entrance to the market area adjacent to the dhow landing jetties (now all reclaimed land). Belgrave is widely reported as having been a well-known and popular figure regularly seen riding his horse, wearing a topee (pith) hat, and visiting markets and public gathering places to listen to the views and aspirations of Bahrainis. His office, the 'Advisory', remains to this day as the old home of Bahrain's courts and justice system. ==1950s disturbances== A general strike was called by the people of Bahrain in March 1956 to remove Belgrave as advisor and force him to leave the country. During the strike, which was estimated to have included 30,000 people, 9,000 of them oil workers, at least 11 people were reported killed in riots on 11 March, after an argument broke out at a vegetable market. The riots started at the Bahrain's oil refinery. A few days before the riots broke out the car of Selwyn Lloyd, the British foreign secretary, was attacked with rocks, with the attackers shouting \\"Down with Belgrave!\\" British nationals were forced to stay indoors for safety. As a result, Belgrave's powers were reduced significantly, although Shaikh Salman refused to remove him totally. Shaikh Salman also allowed the establishment of the first legal political party, the National Union Committee (NUC; aka \\"Committee for National Unity\\") a step toward democratic elections. The total killed was later reduced to 5. Some American officials said that this was another example of the British trying to hold on to their colonialism. The uprising is said to have been started through the effort of Gamal Abdel Nasser, the ruler of Egypt at the time, going as far as secretly funding merchants of the bazaar, because of the disagreement that he was having with the British, and other western powers, over Israel. The Soviet Union would take advantage over the tensions caused by this spring upheaval and the criticisms of the western powers (Britain, France and the United States) to supply arms to the Nasser government. ==Leaving Bahrain== Belgrave was the country's economic adviser for thirty years, but he would leave the country in six months after the protests and having his powers diminished. In December 1956, five NUC men were jailed and found guilty for formulating a plot to destroy the royal palace, kill the royal family, and kill Belgrave. The biggest long-term benefit to the country during Belgrave's tenure has been said by some to be the establishment, by his wife Marjorie Belgrave, of schools for girls. However, this caused tensions with some traditionalists. According to authors Philip L. Kohl, Mara Kozelsky, and Nachman Ben-Yehuda in their work Selective Remembrances, Belgrave was \\"the first westerner to use and advocate the name \\"Arabian gulf\\", first in the journal Soat al-Bahrain (Voice of Bahrain) in 1955.\\" ==See also== * History of Bahrain * Ahmed Al-Fateh * National Union Committee ==References== * Sir Charles Belgrave's Autobiography, Personal Column (Hutchinson & Co. 1960) * Personal Diary of Charles Belgrave (1926‚Äì1957) * * Historic photos of Charles Belgrave ==External links== * * LIFE Magazine (Nov. 17, 1952) article about Charles Belgrave in Bahrain Category:1894 births Category:1969 deaths Category:People educated at Bedford School Category:Alumni of Lincoln College, Oxford Category:Colonial Service officers Category:British colonial political officers Category:History of Bahrain Category:British colonial army officers Category:Knights Commander of the Order of the British Empire Category:Tanganyika (territory) people Category:People of former British colonies and protectorates in Asia ","title":"Charles Belgrave"},{"id":"3233283","text":"\\"Fireworks\\" is a song by English rock band Embrace, released as the group's second single, and the first to reach the top 40 in the UK (#34).

Set in Britain in the last decade of the 3rd century, it is the story of Justin and Flavius, two cousins in the Roman legions who find themselves in the intrigue and battle surrounding the struggles between Carausius, a self- proclaimed emperor in Britain, Allectus, Carausius's treasurer, and Constantius, emperor in Rome.www.amazon.comwww.barnesandnoble.com The silver branch of the title is an article in the possession of Carausius's slave Cullen, his eccentric Fool who calls himself Carausius's hound and who wears a dog's tail as part of his motley. Subtle allusions to the silver branch recur in other novels in the Eagle of the Ninth series, and it presumably refers to the otherworldly musical instrument mentioned in the medieval Irish narrative The Voyage of Bran. The Silver Branch was also a symbol of authority and a temporary \\"pass card\\" used by the Celts, consisting of a sprig of mistletoe or an apple branch. The Silver Branch is #2 in the Roman Britain Series, following The Eagle of the Ninth (1954) and preceding Frontier Wolf (1980), The Lantern Bearers (1959), and Sword at Sunset (1963). ==Summary== The story is set in 3rd-century Roman Britain, when Marcus Aurelius Carausius (Curoi), the military commander, has rebelled against Rome and named himself the emperor of Britain and northern Gaul. After a series of naval victories, he is temporarily recognized by Rome's ruler Maximian. Justin (Tiberius Lucius Justinianus), a shy young army surgeon who had just completed his apprenticeship in Beersheba, is posted to Britain for the first time, although his family has been connected with the island for years. On arriving at Rutupiae, he meets a young Centurion called Flavius (Marcelus Flavius Aquila), who turns out to be a distant cousin, and they become fast friends. Upon overhearing a plot against Carausius by his finance minister Allectus, they try to warn the emperor but, due to their perceived disloyalty, are instead reposted to Magnis on the Northern Wall in disgrace. Allectus, as treasurer, has a crucial role in Carausius's government, overseeing the minting of the coins Carausius uses to consolidate power and spread propaganda (Carausius, with the help of Allectus, issues the first proper silver coins to appear in the Roman Empire for generations, knowing that good quality bullion coinage would enhance his legitimacy and make him look more successful than Diocletian and Maximian). By luck, Justin and Flavius meet Evicatos of the Spear (an exiled Dalriad hunter) who convinces them that the danger is real. They attempt to race back to warn Carausius, but it is already too late by then. Faced with the prospect of capital punishment for desertion, the two cousins go into hiding with the help of a rebel leader. When he is betrayed, the two young men must take over the banner of rebellion and continue his work of protecting and smuggling away people who are disenchanted with Allectus, or who are in danger from his cruel edicts. Finally, the western Emperor Constantius and his aide, the Praetorian prefect Asclepiodotus, sail to Britain to attempt to put an end to Allectus's misrule. Flavius and Justin assemble a ragtag group of people prepared to fight on their behalf, but are much derided for their shabby appearance. When they are hiding at their Great Aunt Honoria's place in Calleva, they discover the lost eagle standard that was buried by their ancestor, Aquila, and which entitles them to call themselves a Roman legion. Despite their looks, the new 'legion' helps the main Roman force find their way and defends the helpless inhabitants of Calleva from the fighting. In recognition of their help, the cousins are pardoned by Constantius and praised for their efforts. The motifs of the lost eagle standard and dolphin signet ring reoccur in this book. ==Background== The book is based around the 3rd century events of the Carausian Revolt, the subsequent life and death of Carausius and the defeat of the traitor Allectus. ==References== Category:1957 British novels Category:1957 children's books Category:British children's novels Category:Children's historical novels Category:Novels by Rosemary Sutcliff Category:Novels set in Roman Britain Category:Novels set in the 3rd century Category:290s ","title":"The Silver Branch (Sutcliff novel)"},{"id":"3233309","text":"Colonel General Abdul Kadir Dagarwal (Russian: –ê–±–¥—É–ª –ö–∞–¥—ã—Ä, Dari/Pashto: ÿπÿ®ÿØ ÿßŸÑŸÇÿßÿØÿ± ÿØ⁄Øÿ±ŸàÿßŸÑ; ), was an Afghan politician, diplomat, and a military officer in the Afghan Air Force who participated in the coup d'√©tat that created the Republic of Afghanistan under the President Dawood Khan, and later directed the Afghan Air Force and Army Air Corps squadrons that attacked the Radio-TV station during the Saur Revolution. He served as the acting leader of the country for three days when the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA) took power and declared the foundation of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan, before handing over power to PDPA leader Noor Mohammad Taraki. He later served two terms as Minister of Defense, the first as part of the Taraki government from April to August 1978, and the latter as part of the Babrak Karmal government from 1982 to 1986. His second term took place during the Soviet war in Afghanistan. == Early life == Abdul Qadir was born in Herat, Herat Province in Afghanistan in 1944. He was an ethnic Tajik whose family hailed from Herat Province. He went to the military school run by the Afghan National Army and was trained as the pilot, qualified to fly the Mig-15, Mig-21, and Su-7, in the Soviet Union. His education comes from the Soviet Union, having studied and excelled in Russian staff colleges. During his career in the Afghan Air Force, he joined Communist Party and later aligned with the Parcham (Flag faction). == The Republican Revolution of 1973 == In 1973, Colonel Qadir helped maneuver the coup d'√©tat led by Prime Minister Dawood Khan with support by General Abdul Karim Mustaghni, who had been Chief of Staff of the armed forces. President Dawood Khan promised radical land reform, the legalisation of political parties and other reforms. The Parcham was offered four minister posts in Daoud's government. As a Parcham member, Qadir was nominated vice chief of the Afghan Air Force, while another Parcham supporter, Major Zia Mohammadzi Zia, was appointed chief of the Afghan Army. However, by 1974 Daoud removed and downgraded many of the Parcham ministers in the government. Qadir was thus downgraded to head of Kabul's Military abattoir. Many Parcham supporters, including Colonel Qadir, shifted allegiance to Khalq. In April 1978 Daoud and his hardline interior minister, General Abdul Qadir Khan Nuristani, launched a sharp government crackdown on the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA). It proved to be a miscalculation. Colonel Qadir and Colonel Mohammad Aslam Watanjar, another leading PDPA member in the military, narrowly escaped arrest and early on 27 April Hafizullah Amin was able to smuggle out the order to restart the coup. == The Saur Revolution == He also ordered the attack against the Arg, and against the Royal Palace of President Mohammad Daoud Khan. The tank commander on the ground was Colonel Aslam Watanjar, of the first battalion of the 4th tank brigade. Together, the troops under their command took Kabul. The government fell, and Daoud was killed. At 19:00 on 27 April, Chairmain Qadir made an announcement over Radio Afghanistan, in the Dari language, that a Revolutionary Council of the Armed Forces had been established by him, with himself as the leader of the country. The council's initial statement of principles, issued late in the evening of 27 April was a noncommittal affirmation of Islamic, democratic, and nonaligned ideals: The Revolutionary Council was formed by himself, Hafizullah Amin, and Major Mohammad Aslam Watanjar, it assumed the control of the country until a civilian government was formed. On 30 April the newly created PDPA's Revolutionary Council (with Nur Mohammad Taraki and Babrak Karmal in its leadership) issued the first of a series of fateful decrees. The decree formally abolished the military's revolutionary council. A second decree, issued on 1 May, named the members of the first cabinet that included Qadir as Minister of Defence. == Member of the Khalqist Government == He became minister of defense, for three months starting in May 1978. On 6 May Qadir asked the Soviet commanders for advice on how to deal with all the people under arrest. On 17 August, Qadir, still defence minister, was arrested for his part in a conspiracy that allegedly had been organized by the Parchams exiled abroad. Since Qadir remained popular in the military, President Taraki did not dare to kill him and instead he was sentenced to fifteen years in jail. The policy of Taraki and Hafizullah Amin to get rid of people they considered unsuitable in order to concentrate all power in their own hands became very apparent. Prime Minister Amin later reported: == Member of the Parchamite Government == After the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 that assassinated Hafizullah Amin, Qadir was released from jail under the new regime of Babrak Karmal, the political posts he held in the PDPA before being sent to jail were restored. He served once again as Minister of Defence (1982‚Äì1985) during the Babrak Administration. After the Soviet Invasion, Kabul was put in a state of siege. The bridges were blocked, barriers and hidden ambushes were set up on all the roads leading into the city. Qadir was made commander of the city. As part of the changes in the leadership of the country, he resigned from the Politburo in November 1985, a year later was appointed Ambassador to Warsaw, Poland by President Mohammad Najibullah. He was recalled to Afghanistan in 1988, and was subsequently elected to Parliament. After the Soviet withdrawal in 1989 it was believed he fled to Bulgaria and sought political asylum. == Later years and death == After some years of living in Bulgaria, Qadir returned to Russia, where he lived with his family. In 2011 or 2012 he returned to Afghanistan, where he lived in Kabul and completed his book. He died as a result of a stroke at Sardar Mohammad Daoud Khan National Military Hospital on 22 April 2014. == Views == At a mourning ceremony in Moscow to honour the memory of Ahmad Shah Massoud > \\"Though Massood and I used to be enemies I am sure he deserves great respect > as an outstanding military leader and, first of all, as a patriot of his > country\\". \\\\- 2001-09-21 == References == == External links == *Abdul Qadir Dagarwal's obituary *¬ª –í –ö–∞–±—É–ª–µ —Å–∫–æ–Ω—á–∞–ª—Å—è —É—á–∞—Å—Ç–Ω–∏–∫ –°–∞—É—Ä—Å–∫–æ–π —Ä–µ–≤–æ–ª—é—Ü–∏–∏ –≥–µ–Ω–µ—Ä–∞–ª –ê–±–¥—É–ª –ö–∞–¥–∏—Ä –•–∞–Ω Category:1944 births Category:2014 deaths Category:Afghan Tajik people Category:People from Herat Category:Afghan military personnel Category:Afghan revolutionaries Category:Afghan communists Category:Communist rulers of Afghanistan Category:Communist government ministers of Afghanistan Category:Soviet people of Afghan descent Category:Democratic Republic of Afghanistan Category:People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan politicians Category:20th-century Afghan politicians Category:Afghan diplomats Category:Afghan expatriates in Pakistan Category:Afghan expatriates in the Soviet Union Category:Afghan expatriates in Bulgaria ","title":"Abdul Qadir (Afghan communist)"},{"id":"3233315","text":"ML/1 (Macro Language/One) is a powerful general-purpose macro processor. Typical uses of ML/1 include: * editing, modifying, correcting, or reformatting text files * translating source code from one programming language to another * acting as a source-code preprocessor to allow the user to add new syntactic forms to an existing programming language *supporting program source-code parameterization (e.g. a parameter might determine whether debugging statements are to be included in the program source code that is passed to the compiler) ML/1 was developed in 1966 by Peter J. Brown as part of PhD research at Cambridge University in England. In 1984, Robert D. Eager, one of Peter Brown's colleagues at the University of Kent, rewrote ML/I, first in BCPL in 1981, and later in C in 1984, which increased its portability. * Note that Peter Brown's original name for the language was ML/I, where (as in IBM's PL/I) the last character is the Roman numeral \\"I\\", not the Arabic numeral \\"1\\". Most subsequent implementations however have been called ML/1 (where the last character is the Arabic numeral \\"1\\"). Since then, ML/1 has been ported to many platforms and operating systems, including VMS, MVS, MS- DOS, OS/2, and UNIX. In his implementations of ML/1, Bob Eager has added features and capabilities in addition to those originally specified in Peter Brown's thesis. That version is available for multiple platforms via the ML/1 web site, http://www.ml1.org.uk . The ML/1 web site provides further information about ML/1, as well as documentation (including a tutorial, simple introductory guide, and full user manual). Although the total number of ML/1 users in the world is small, there are ML/1 users all over the world, and Bob has corresponded with ML/1 users in the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Germany, Holland, and India. In a 1976 paper, Andrew S. Tanenbaum describes using ML/I as a compiler-compiler. == Overview == ML/I accepts input in completely free form, treating data as a stream of bytes rather than a series of lines or records. It does not require any particular flagging of macro calls, which makes it particularly useful for processing arbitrary text. Replacements of text can be simple (e.g. PIG is to be replaced by DOG) or complex (e.g. replace the item between the third and fourth commas after the last full stop, by the contents of some counter). ML/I was used to implement several items of portable software, including itself. It was originally written in a special descriptive language, then mapped into a suitable language for each target system. This mapping was done using ML/I itself. There were two different forms of this descriptive language; high level and low level. After this mapping ML/I was often used to implement SIL's (system implementation languages, such as C) for the new generation of 16-bit architecture minicomputers. == How ML/1 works == In the most basic terms, here's how ML/1 works. * The user supplies ML/1 with a file containing input text. * In another file (or, optionally, in the same file) the user supplies a set of ML/1 macros. The macros tell the ML/1 interpreter what insertions, deletions, expansions, translations and other modifications the user wants made to the input text. * When ML/1 is run on the input text, ML/1 follows the instructions in the ML/1 macros, changes the text, and writes out a new file containing the modified text. == Distinctive features of ML/1 == There are several ways in which ML/1 is more powerful than simple \\"scan and replace\\" utilities. ML/1 does not process text on a character-string by character- string basis; it processes text on a word by word (or, in ML/1's terminology, on an \\"atom by atom\\") basis. For many applications, it is extremely useful to be able to process a text as a sequence of atoms rather than a sequence of characters. Suppose, for example, that we wish to translate a program from a programming language that has a DO ... END syntax, into a language that has a BEGIN ... END syntax. We therefore wish to replace \\"DO\\" with \\"BEGIN\\". If we do the replacement with an ordinary scan-and-replace utility, all occurrences of the string \\"DO\\" will be changed to \\"BEGIN\\", including any \\"DO\\"s that are embedded in words such as \\"DOCUMENT\\" (which will become \\"BEGINCUMENT\\"). With ML/1, in contrast, this will not happen because the string \\"DO\\" will trigger text-replacement only when it occurs as a word (that is, when it is preceded and followed by delimiters such as spaces, tabs, newlines, or punctuation characters). ML/1, rather than operating on a line-by-line basis, recognizes patterns of text that can be quite complex, nested, with multiple delimiters, and spanning many lines. ML/1 can, for instance, process a pattern such as the common programming language IF ... THEN ... ELSE ... ENDIF structure that spans multiple lines, and contains embedded text that itself may include a nested IF ... THEN ... ELSE ... ENDIF structure. ML/1 can recognize embedded comments and literal quotations, and protect them from alteration. Ordinary scan-and-replace utilities change strings indiscriminately, whether they occur in the program text as a keyword or variable name, embedded in a comment, or in a quoted literal. In order to deal with such complicated patterns, ML/1 needs to be a programming language in its own right. Like other programming languages, ML/1 supports variables and assignment statements, GOTOs and labels, IF... THEN tests and loops. These features give ML/1 an unusual degree of power and flexibility. == Limitations == ML/1 is case-sensitive, so it does not support case-insensitive text processing. == References == == External links == * http://www.ml1.org.uk Category:Macro programming languages ","title":"ML/I"},{"id":"3233324","text":"Lin Dunn (born May 10, 1947) is an American women's basketball coach, currently a special assistant to the head coach with Kentucky.

She is in the Athletics Hall of Fame at both Austin Peay and Miami. Dunn also was president of the Women's Basketball Coaches Association in 1984-85. Dunn was abruptly fired at Purdue after the 1995-96 season, but resurfaced in the pros with the American Basketball League's Portland Power in 1996. She was ABL's coach of the year in 1998, right before that league folded. Dunn then became the first coach and GM of the expansion Seattle Storm in the ABL's rival, the WNBA. Her folksy southern personality was a hit in Urbane, Seattle, with fans often wearing Dunn masks and quoting her rustic aphorisms. The team started with a dismal 6-26 season. Dunn left the Storm just as it was starting to have success. New superstars Lauren Jackson and Sue Bird led the team to the 2002 playoffs, where they were swept by the Los Angeles Sparks. Dunn then resigned, leaving the path open for Anne Donovan to build a championship team just two seasons later. Dunn is a former head coach of the Indiana Fever.Lin Dunn .

He was the founding president of the Piper Aircraft Corporation and led the company from 1929 until his death in 1970. He graduated from Harvard University in 1903 and later became known as \\"the Henry Ford of aviation\\". Prior to Piper's successful business career he was an officer in the United States Army serving in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. He was then in the United States Army Corps of Engineers during World War I. In total Piper served 18 years in the Army. When he returned from World War I he was primarily an investor and businessman in the oil industry until 1929 when he became an investor in the Taylor Brothers Aircraft Corporation. He went on to purchase the soon-renamed Taylor Aircraft Corporation and head it until reorganizing the company into Piper Aircraft in 1937, eventually seeing tremendous success and becoming a well-known aviation figure of the 20th century. Piper Aircraft sold over 80,000 units when he oversaw the company, cementing Piper as a global aerospace manufacturing power. Piper was posthumously inducted in the National Aviation Hall of Fame class of 1980. The William T. Piper Memorial Airport in Lock Haven, Pennsylvania is named in his honor.

His father dabbled both in dairy farming and in the promising crude oil business as Piper was growing up often helping his father. By the time he was eight, Piper was milking cows and walking several miles to a one-room country school. At the age of nine he introduced himself to the oil business when he assisted his father in the task of repairing well pumps. When family finances improved, the Piper family moved to Bradford, Pennsylvania. In 1898 due to the sinking of the USS Maine Piper lied about his age and joined the United States Army. Piper attended Harvard University where he was on the track and field team. He graduated in 1903 with honors with a degree in business and mechanical engineering. ===Military and aviation career=== Piper J-3 Cub, the company's most influential aircraft Piper served in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War and World War I, in the latter as a captain in the Corps of Engineers. He made most of his fortune from oil wells. In 1929, he became the original investor in the Taylor Brothers Aircraft Corporation for $400 ($5,647 in 2017 dollars), led then by aircraft designer and aviation entrepreneur Clarence Gilbert Taylor. A year later, during the onset of the Great Depression, the company went bankrupt and Piper bought its assets and reorganized it into the Taylor Aircraft Corporation, keeping Gilbert Taylor on as president. During this period, he sought to manufacture reliable and affordable light aircraft. In 1937, two years after Piper bought out Gilbert Taylor from the company due in part to contentious clashes between the two, he established the Piper Aircraft Corporation and, by 1940, it dominated the light aircraft market. At the time, a Piper Cub and flying lessons cost $1,325 dollars ($19,808 in 2017 dollars). The Piper Cub (which derives from the Taylor Cub) would go on to become the most-produced fabric-covered monoplane in history, with over 20,000 units delivered from 1938‚Äì1947. Its simplicity, affordability and popularity often invokes comparisons to the Ford Model T. ==Death and legacy== The Piper family mausoleum located atop Highland Cemetery in Lock Haven, where William is interred Piper died in his home in Lock Haven due to natural causes on January 15, 1970. Just prior to his death, in 1968, Piper's son, William Piper, Jr., took over the company and was appointed president. In 1970, Piper Jr. was also named chairman by the board, and in 1973, Piper Aircraft was sold, moving from Pennsylvania to where it is located today, Vero Beach, Florida. In 1980, William Piper was posthumously inducted into the National Aviation Hall of Fame. In 1993, Piper was inducted into the International Air & Space Hall of Fame at the San Diego Air & Space Museum.Sprekelmeyer, Linda, editor. These We Honor: The International Aerospace Hall of Fame.

He was sometimes known as the Red Violinist (der rote Geiger). S√µrmus was born in the village of K√µivu, Luunja Parish, Tartu County, in the Governorate of Livonia (present-day Estonia). He inherited part of his interest for music from his mother Leena, who had a lovely singing voice and who used to sing during her daily tasks. When S√µrmus was 6 years old, his father gave him his first violin. S√µrmus¬¥s first music teacher was a local tailor named Gustav Puks. S√µrmus went to Hugo Treffner Gymnasium in Tartu from 1888. In gymnasium, he continued playing violin with Johann Kelder, who was a medical student in the University of Tartu. S√µrmus then gave his first concerts in his farmstead and in a neighbouring house. In 1899, S√µrmus went to university and started studying law at the university. After a year in the faculty of law, he changed his studies over to history and languages. In 1902, S√µrmus continued his violin studies at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory under the hand of violin master Leopold Auer. S√µrmus became active in the Russian Revolutionary movement and eventually took part in the 1905 Russian Revolution. In 1904, he began touring, giving violin recitals and giving ardent speeches of proletarian sufferings and miseries. That was enough to be listed in the police's list of most wanted. In 1906, because of his revolutionary activity, he was forced to flee Russia, so he toured Europe giving recitals. After this he continued his studies with Henri Marteau in Berlin and Lucien Capet in Paris. S√µrmus spent World War I in Paris and London, after which he returned to Russia for a couple of years and then toured the continent again. One concert was held in Edinburgh, Scotland, in 1934 where his wife, Virginia, played the pianoforte. He died in a nursing home in Moscow whilst his wife, Virginia, was visiting her family in Britain. S√µrmus was a labour activist. He gave a number of charity concerts, the proceeds of which went to help the poor, and concerts to children. Near Dresden, there is a children¬¥s orphanage which was built with donation money collected during S√µrmus's concerts. In the 1920s, he was mainly active in Germany.

He was best known for being fired from New York City station WABC-AM in 1969, after he reported over the air that the singer Paul McCartney might have died, circulating the now infamous Paul is Dead folktale saga and conspiracy theory. ==Early life and education== Born in Fort Jackson, South Carolina, Yonge grew up in Ocala, Florida. He got his first radio job at WTMC-AM 1290 Ocala, Florida when he was 15 years old. Roby's first Miami, Florida job was as a newsman at WIOD, which was then WCKR. By the mid 1960s Roby was working for Top 40 WQAM, Miami, Florida until hired in New York City at WABC. ==Career== Yonge moved to Miami's WQAM, where his on-air nickname was \\"The Big Kahuna\\". In December 1967, Yonge moved to New York and WABC. Five- minute snippets of Yonge, each spotlighting a fact in rock history, aired on other ABC radio stations as well, such as WLS-AM, on weekday evenings during early 1969. Originally hired for the 1-3 PM shift, Yonge was moved into the overnight shift in August 1969 when Charlie Greer left the station. He was told by WABC program director Rick Sklar, in the early fall of that year, that his contract would not be renewed. He subsequently went on the air with the Paul McCartney \\"death\\" rumor on October 21, 1969, having heard the rumor from kids calling in from a college in Indiana. Stating that his contract was up in two weeks and would not be renewed, and that at 12:39 AM, he would not be \\"cut\\" because there was nobody around, Yonge began to speculate on rumors circulating about the possible death of McCartney. He never said that Paul was dead, but rather enumerated various \\"clues\\" in album cover art and within certain songs, some played backwards with clues like \\"Paul is dead\\" and \\"I buried Paul\\" which he said had been catalogued by thirty Indiana University Bloomington students. Callers lit up the station switchboard. Since all the phone lines were jammed with thousands of calls, Rick Sklar could not get through to the station and it was an hour and a half before Program Director Sklar arrived at the station in his bath robe. He got Les Marshak the newsman on duty in the adjacent studio to relieve Yonge and Sklar told Roby, \\"When you come in tomorrow to do your show, I don't want you to talk any more about this McCartney might be dead rumor\\". Roby then told Sklar, \\"I won't be in anymore but you'll be famous in the morning\\". The next day, many newspapers nationwide carried the story about the \\"is Paul dead\\" rumor and Roby Yonge. In an interview with his friend John Paul Roberts (\\"JPR\\"), former WQAM DJ, Roby said this about the Paul McCartney rumor, \\"I never said the guy is dead, and I don't say it now, but there's reason to believe something is going on\\". A 90-minute JPR interview with Roby Yonge, where he talks in detail about the \\"Paul is dead\\" rumor as well as the circumstances leading to his being hired at WABC, can be heard at this website. Marshak continued to do Yonge's show on WABC until a replacement was hired. Sklar's reach did not cross radio bands, as, less than three weeks later, on November 14, 1969, former WABC DJ Bob \\"Bob-a-loo\\" Lewis did a full production \\"Paul is Dead\\" show on WABC-FM, putting forth many of the same assertions about McCartney's supposed death that had resulted in Yonge being yanked off the air. Yonge was hired by WCBS- FM, where he helped introduce the \\"Oldies\\" format of popular songs to that station. After a few years, he returned to Florida, where he served as general manager of Mother WMUM, an early FM rock station in Palm Beach. After the demise of Mother in 1972, Yonge became a morning personality on Y100 WHYI in Fort Lauderdale/Miami. He was fired after the first day on the air, August 3, 1973. by WHYI National Program Director Buzz Bennett, who Roby had a personality conflict with. The next day he moved to the competitor WMYQ-FM, where he did the moring show. In 1987, Yonge did a morning show at WKAT in Miami, then returned in 1993 to do a music/talk show on 790 WMRZ. ==Death== Roby Yonge died on July 18, 1997 of an apparent heart attack at age 54. ==References== Category:1943 births Category:1997 deaths Category:American radio DJs Category:People from Ocala, Florida ","title":"Roby Yonge"},{"id":"3233349","text":"\\"Hooligan\\" (released 1 November 1999) is a song by English rock band Embrace, which became their sixth Top 40 single (#18 in the UK), and the first from their second album Drawn From Memory.

The company is responsible for cutting some of the most famous diamonds in the world including two of the top three largest diamonds ever found. Its headquarters still stand at its original location Tolstraat 127 in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. The company also has regional headquarters in New York City (Royal Asscher of America) and Tokyo (Royal Asscher of Japan). Royal Asscher is still owned by the Asscher family, today a renowned diamond dynasty. The Asscher Diamond Company, made famous at the turn of the 20th century by Joseph and Abraham Asscher, became Royal Asscher Diamond Company in 1980 when it was bestowed with the Dutch Royal Predicate from Queen Juliana of the Netherlands in recognition of the company's stature both in the Netherlands and across the world. In 2011 Queen Beatrix perpetuated the Royal Prefix for another 25 years. ==History== ===The establishment of the company=== In 1854 Joseph Isaac Asscher, a known artisan in the diamond industry, established the I.J Asscher diamond company, named for his son Isaac Joseph Asscher, who followed in his father's footsteps and entered the diamond industry. He passed down his expertise to his five sons, including Joseph (a prolific and unrivalled diamond cleaver) and Abraham (a talented innovator and businessman). Together, they became the 20th century's most prodigious diamond experts. Under Joseph and Abraham, the company is known as the Asscher Diamond Company and cuts diamonds to be set in jewellery for world famous boutiques and maisons internationally. As one of the largest diamond polishing companies in the world at that time, the company was known for having Royalty, celebrities and politicians as private clients. ===The Asscher Cut=== In 1902 Joseph Asscher designed and patented his namesake original Asscher cut. This emblematic cut was the world's first patented diamond cut protecting it from replication by other companies. The Asscher Diamond Company held its exclusive patent until the Second World War and saw strong sales internationally, particularly during the 1920s and 30s when the cut and company were both at the height of success. The original design had 58 Step cut facets, a small table, high crown and steep pavilion with cut corners. An accurate description would be a cut cornered square emerald cut diamond. Also known as square emerald cuts, Asscher cut diamonds are roughly square in shape when viewed from above but have cut corners for more light to enter the diamond. They typically have 50 or 58 facets and their ideal length to width ratio is 1 to 1.04. The Asscher cut was a staple of art deco and art nouveau era jewellery, with its straight lines and faceting arrangement making it perfect for clean and graphic elements brought to life by the movement. Because of their facet arrangement, high crown, and depth, Asscher's can produce outstanding brilliance and are known for creating a ‚Äòhall of mirrors‚Äô effect. ===The Royal Asscher Cut=== Almost 100 years after the Original Asscher Cut was first conceived, Joseph Asscher's great-grand nephews, Edward and Joop Asscher, revised the design, adding sixteen additional facets to make it reminiscent of the Cullinan II diamond of the Imperial Crown. The result is a 74 facet step-cut square diamond, absorbing the light from each angle, creating an endless mirrored pool effect, a kaleidoscope of all of the colors that make up a spectrum of light, designed to catch the eye with the brilliance of a round cut, and the intricacies of the artfully-constructed angles of an emerald cut. ===The Royal Asscher Round Brilliant=== By adding facets on the outside of the diamond, the Royal Asscher Round Brilliant Cut removes some of the darker elements seen in a traditional round diamond, even an ideal cut. The effect is a crisp, clear centre, which though true to the round diamond shape is distinctively different with 74 facets compared to the generic diamond's 58 ===The Royal Asscher Oval Cut=== Inspired by the intrinsic beauty of the slender, flattering and popular Oval shape which is often cut irregularly, the Asscher family launched The Royal Asscher Oval Cut in 2018, like the company's other diamond cuts the Royal Asscher Oval Cut is patented, with 74 facets compared to the generic round diamond's usual 58. Edward Asscher (fifth generation) and Mike Asscher (sixth generation) set out to master the creation of a consistently beautiful Oval by playing with proportions and faceting patterns, the diamond has what is typically known as a modified-brilliant faceting style. ===The Royal Asscher Cushion Cut=== The Royal Asscher Cushion Cut was launched in 2018, the diamond has additional faceting on the table and bottom of its design, which enhance its beauty by exposing the diamond's sparkle potential without losing the soft pillowy elegance of the cut. Like Royal Asscher's other diamond cuts the design is patented. ===The Excelsior diamond=== In 1903, at , the Excelsior diamond was the largest diamond ever found. The gem required expert handling to be properly carved: inclusions within the rough diamond prevented it from being polished as a single stone. Abraham Asscher was charged with cleaving the Excelsior; to minimize flaws, he carved the stone into ten diamonds which were primarily sold to anonymous purchasers. Rumor and myth abound regarding the location of the diamonds. The Excelsior diamond was the focal point of the 2003 Victoria's Secret Fantasy Bra valued at approximately $13 million with a jeweled panty for additional $1 million. ===The Cullinan diamond=== In 1905 the Cullinan diamond was discovered. At it was a legendary find, and achieved instant renown across the globe. The diamond was presented to King Edward VII, and he invited the Asscher brothers to London to discuss cleaving the diamond. It was decided that Joseph Asscher would cleave the Cullinan into three parts, necessitated by inclusions within the rough diamond. Nine large stones were cut from it, the largest being the Cullinan I at . In February 1908 a notable audience gathered to watch Joseph Asscher cleave the huge stone. In order to yield large, beautiful diamonds he needed to hit the Cullinan in exactly the right place. On his first strike his blade broke, while the stone remained intact. He dismissed all present and set to work creating larger, stronger tools. The following week, armed with new tools, Joseph resumed his work, allowing no one but the notary public in the cutting room. Urban legend recounts that Joseph fainted after striking the Cullinan diamond with a tremendous blow. He later commented that the adrenaline surging through him the moment the stone split was so strong all he could think to do was to examine the stone and check his workmanship over and over again before rushing to the next room to share the good news. Later, the Cullinan diamonds were polished, ready to take pride of place in Great Britain's Crown Jewels. ===World War II=== During the Second World War battle of the Netherlands the Nazis as part of their extermination plans, entered the Asscher Diamond Company's Amsterdam headquarters and seized its diamonds. Since the Asscher family were Jewish they were eventually deported from the Netherlands and interned in concentration camps, along with nearly all of the company's 500 master polishers. Most of the Asscher family and over 96 percent of the polishers were murdered by the Nazis. During the war the patent on the original Asscher cut expired. With no one to renew the patent, other companies started to utilize the Asscher cut, leading to market confusion about the origin of many Asscher cut diamonds. Some companies chose to call their Asscher cut diamonds square-emerald cuts instead. Many of these diamonds were cut for yield and did not necessarily follow Joseph Asscher's original proportion calculations for the Asscher cut, which specified parameters for the diamond's crown height, table size, and facet alignment. ===After the war=== Only ten Asscher family members and fifteen of the five hundred polishers survived the Holocaust. Although once the world's diamond polishing capital, the diamond industry in Amsterdam was virtually wiped out during the war, including the Asscher Diamond Company. Antwerp subsequently emerged as a major diamond polishing center. In 1946 Joop and Louis Asscher were invited to utilize their expertise to start a new company in New York, but they chose to remain in their home of Amsterdam and rebuild the Asscher Diamond Company. At this point during the 1950s and 1960s the company began exploring new markets and became a prominent diamantaire in Japan. ===Royal title=== In 1980 Her Majesty Queen Juliana of the Netherlands granted the Asscher Diamond Company a royal title in tribute to the leading, century-old role the company and Asscher family held in the diamond industry. With this honor, the Asscher Diamond Company became the Royal Asscher Diamond Company. ===Authenticity=== The Asscher family secured international design patents on all of their cuts, so that they can not be legally imitated; Royal Asscher is also trademarked and the company owns exclusive rights to the name. To further guarantee authenticity each diamond is laser inscribed with the Royal Asscher logo and an identification number belonging to a single diamond only. The number is logged with the Royal Asscher Diamond Company in Amsterdam and a Royal Asscher certificate accompanies the diamond. ===Fancy Cut Specialists=== Today the Royal Asscher Diamond Company are Fancy Cut specialists. Consumer understanding of diamonds has increased with the advent of the internet, online sellers and social media. Today's consumer is willing to buy online and people looking for something individual and rare - this created a growing interest in generic fancy shape diamonds. Non-round shapes used to be much harder for customers to find and purchase. Rounds were ever popular and fancy shapes typically harder to source in beautiful variants. That's because there is no universal cut grading system existing for fancy shapes, whereas round diamond shapes have the ideal category (as best in cut class). Seeking to create a new level of perfection in this class, Royal Asscher as known pioneers of shape undertook research and development and have debuted four cuts which the company states are the shapes ultimate expressions of beauty, each cut has 16 more facets when compared to their generic counterparts. ===Present=== The fifth and sixth generations of the Asscher family are at the helm of an international company. Edward Asscher, father works in conjunction with daughter Lita and son Mike. In March 2020, Edward Asscher announced his retirement from the company. With his departure, his daughter Lita Asscher and son Mike Asscher will serve as co-presidents of the firm. ==The Golden Book== The company keeps a ‚ÄòGolden Book‚Äô of visitors, who have included Emperor Hirohito of Japan, Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom, and Queen Juliana and Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands. Royal Asscher jewellery is often seen at red-carpet events. ===Tolstraat 127=== Designed by renowned Architect Gerrit Van Arkel the castle like structure of the original Asscher factory is today the jewel of Amsterdam's De Pijp area, Working on the principle of needing ample light for the diamonds to be worked within, the castle-like factory had huge windows and originally featured a police station outside. At one time over 500 diamond polishers worked in the building alongside numerous administrative staff and family. It was here in this grand building where some of the largest and most iconic diamonds in the world were cut and polished. Such was the stature of 127 Tolstraat that the area became known as the Diamantbuurt (DiamondDistrict) with street names such as Diamantstraat (Diamondstreet), Robijnstraat (Rubystreet), Saffierstraat (SapphireStreet) and Smaragdstraat (EmeraldStreet).

He was well known to Charles I and Charles II, and the French cardinals Richelieu and Mazarin. He attended the meeting of the 1660 committee of 12 on 28 November 1660 that led to the formation of the Royal Society, and was influential in gaining its Royal Charter and formulating its statutes and regulations.The most complete work on this man remains A. Robertson, The Life of Sir Robert Moray (London: Longman, 1922) ==Early life== Moray was the elder of two sons of a Perthshire laird, Sir Mungo Moray of Craigie. His grandfather was Robert Moray of Abercairney (near Crieff), and his mother was a daughter of George Halket of Pitfirran, Dunfermline. An uncle, David Moray, had been a personal servant of Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales. Biographers have claimed that Moray attended the University of St Andrews and continued his university education in France, however, Moray himself wrote to his friend Alexander Bruce (who probably had attended St Andrews), jocularly proposing a debate between the 2 men, in which Moray said he would force Bruce to \\"rub up your St Andrews language\\", and \\"one may give you your hands full that was scarcely ever farrer East then Cowper\\" (Cupar lies several miles to the west of St Andrews). Moray's name does not appear in the matriculation records of the university. Moray appears to have taken an interest in applied science early in life. In 1623 he visited the artificial island constructed in the Firth of Forth at Culross by Sir George Bruce (Alexander's grandfather), from which coal was mined. In a letter written later in his life, Moray cites 1627 as the year when he began study \\"to understand and regulate my passions\\". In 1633, he joined the Garde √âcossaise, a regiment which fought under Colonel John Hepburn in the army of Louis XIII. He became a favourite of Cardinal Richelieu, who used him as an agent (spy). Richelieu promoted Moray to Lieutenant Colonel and sent him to join the Covenanters army in Edinburgh in 1638.Steve Murdoch and Alexia Grosjean, Alexander Leslie and the Scottish Generals of the Thirty Years' War, 1618-1648 (London, 2014), p.108 Experienced in military engineering, he was appointed quartermaster-general in the Scottish Army that invaded England in 1640 in the Second Bishops' War and took Newcastle upon Tyne. Several Freemasons who were members of the Lodge of Edinburgh initiated him into Freemasonry there on 20 May 1641. Although he was initiated into a Scottish lodge, the event took place south of the border: this is earliest extant record of a man being initiated into speculative Freemasonry on English soil.Cooper, Robert L D, (2006) Cracking the Freemasons Code, pp 120-21 Thereafter, he regularly used the five pointed star, his masonic mark, on his correspondence. Robert Moray returned to France by 1643 and was captured at Tuttlingen in November of that year. Upon his release, and upon the death of James Campbell, 1st Earl of Irvine, Moray took over command of the Garde √âcossaise.Steve Murdoch and Alexia Grosjean, Alexander Leslie and the Scottish Generals of the Thirty Years' War, 1618-1648 (London, 2014), p.161. ==After 1649== Moray helped to persuade the Prince of Wales, the future Charles II, to visit Scotland for his coronation as King of Scots at Scone on 1 January 1651. Charles then invaded England from Scotland, but was defeated at the Battle of Worcester in September 1651, and forced to escape to France. In Scotland, Moray became Lord Justice Clerk, a Privy Councillor, and a Lord of Session in 1651. He married Sophia Lindsay, daughter of David Lindsay, 1st Lord Balcarres, but she died in childbirth on 2 January 1653 and the child was stillborn. Moray joined a Scottish uprising in 1653 which was suppressed by Cromwell, and Moray returned to the continent in 1654. Moray spent time in Bruges in 1656, then in Maastricht until 1659, when he joined Charles in Paris. Following the restoration of Charles II, Moray was one of the founders of the Royal Society at its first formal meeting on Wednesday 28 November 1660, at the premises of Gresham College on Bishopsgate, at which Christopher Wren, Gresham Professor of Astronomy, delivered a lecture. The twelve in attendance were an interesting mix of four Royalists (William Brouncker, 2nd Viscount Brouncker, Alexander Bruce, 2nd Earl of Kincardine, Sir Paul Neile, William Balle) and six Parliamentarians (John Wilkins, Robert Boyle, Jonathan Goddard, William Petty, Lawrence Rook, Christopher Wren) and two others with less fixed (or more flexible) views, Abraham Hill and Moray. Moray was influential in gaining the new society its Royal Charter and formulating its statutes and regulations. Moray was the first President of the society which holds its Annual General Meeting on Saint Andrew's Day (30 November) the Patron Saint of Scotland in apparent acknowledgement of Moray's importance in the formation of the society. Moray became a Privy Councillor again in February 1661, and was later a Lord of the Exchequer. His younger brother, Sir William Moray, was Master of Works to Charles II. The King granted him an apartment at the Palace of Whitehall, where he engaged in chemical experiments. He became a recluse in later life, and, by the time of his death, he was virtually a pauper. He was buried in Westminster Abbey'The Abbey Scientists' Hall, A.R. p12: London; Roger & Robert Nicholson; 1966 at the order of the King. His grave is unmarked, but his name appears on the stone of Abraham Cowley, near the ashes of Geoffrey Chaucer and Edmund Spenser, in Poets' Corner.Ars Quatuor Coronatorum, Vol 42, 1930. p 77 Moray had a range of notable friends: James Gregory, Samuel Pepys, Thomas Vaughan, Andrew Marvell, John Evelyn and Gilbert Burnet. ==Legacy== Moray's legacy is just beginning to be appreciated in the country of his birth. In 1969 a masonic lodge of research, Lodge Sir Robert Moray, No.1641, (Edinburgh, Scotland) was established in his honour.Year Book of the Grand Lodge of Antient, Free and Accepted Masons of Scotland, 2014. p 209 ==References== ==External links== *\\"Sir Robert Moray - Soldier, scientist, spy, freemason and founder of The Royal Society\\", lecture by Dr Robert Lomas at Gresham College, 4 April 2007 *London Region archives, AIM25 *Fellow of the month, November 2005 - Sir Robert Moray from the Royal Society *The first recorded initiation in England, Grand Lodge of British Columbia and Yukon * *\\"Moray, Robert\\" Entry in 'The Scotland, Scandinavia and Northern European Biographical Database (SSNE)' published by St Andrews University Category:1609 births Category:1673 deaths Category:Alumni of the University of St Andrews Category:Covenanters Category:Founder Fellows of the Royal Society Category:Scottish Freemasons Category:French spies Category:17th-century Scottish people Category:Garde √âcossaise officers Category:17th-century scientists Category:Philosophers of science Category:Scottish spies Category:Scottish diplomats Category:Scottish chemists Category:Senators of the College of Justice Category:Members of the Privy Council of Scotland Category:People from Perth and Kinross Category:Burials at Westminster Abbey Category:Commissioners of the Treasury of Scotland Category:Lords Justice Clerk Category:17th-century Scottish judges Category:17th-century soldiers Category:17th-century spies ","title":"Robert Moray"},{"id":"3233375","text":"Arioald was the Lombard king of Italy from 626 to 636.

Blood going from the heart to the lungs goes through the pulmonary valve, whose purpose is to prevent blood from flowing back to the heart. In pulmonary valve stenosis this opening is too narrow, leading to a reduction of flow of blood to the lungs. While the most common cause of pulmonary valve stenosis is congenital heart disease, it may also be due to a malignant carcinoid tumor. Both stenosis of the pulmonary artery and pulmonary valve stenosis are forms of pulmonic stenosis (nonvalvular and valvular, respectively) but pulmonary valve stenosis accounts for 80% of pulmonic stenosis. PVS was the key finding that led Jacqueline Noonan to identify the syndrome now called Noonan syndrome. ==Symptoms and signs== Cynosis Among some of the symptoms consistent with pulmonary valve stenosis are the following: * Heart murmur * Cyanosis * Dyspnea * Dizziness * Upper thorax pain * Developmental disorders ==Cause== In regards to the cause of pulmonary valve stenosis a very high percentage are congenital, the right ventricular flow is hindered (or obstructed by this). The cause in turn is divided into: valvular, external and intrinsic (when it is acquired). ==Pathophysiology== The pathophysiology of pulmonary valve stenosis consists of the valve leaflets becoming too thick (therefore not separate one from another), which can cause high pulmonary pressure, and pulmonary hypertension. This however, does not mean the cause is always congenital. The left ventricle can be changed physically, these changes are a direct result of right ventricular hypertrophy. Once the obstruction is subdued, it (the left ventricle) can return to normal. ==Diagnosis== Pulmonary valve stenosis-Echocardiogram The diagnosis of pulmonary valve stenosis can be achieved via echocardiogram, as well as a variety of other means among them are: ultrasound, in which images of the heart chambers in utero where the tricuspid valve has thickening (or due to Fallot's tetralogy, Noonan's syndrome, and other congenital defects) and in infancy auscultation of the heart can reveal identification of a murmur. Some other conditions to contemplate (in diagnosis of pulmonic valvular stenosis) are the following: * Infundibular stenosis * Supravalvular pulmonary stenosis * Dysplastic pulmonic valve stenosis ==Treatment== In terms of treatment for pulmonary valve stenosis, valve replacement or surgical repair (depending upon whether the stenosis is in the valve or vessel) may be indicated. If the valve stenosis is of congenital origin, balloon valvuloplasty is another option, depending on the case. Valves made from animal or human tissue (are used for valve replacement), in adults metal valves can be used. ==Epidemiology== The epidemiology of pulmonary valve stenosis can be summed up by the congenital aspect which is the majority of cases, in broad terms PVS is rare in the general population. ==References== ==Further reading== * * == External links == * Overview at American Heart Association Category:Valvular heart disease Category:Articles containing video clips ","title":"Pulmonary valve stenosis"},{"id":"3233381","text":"Phyllomedusa is a genus of tree frogs in the family Phyllomedusidae from tropical and subtropical South America (south to northern Argentina) and Panama. It has 16 recognised species. ==Secretion== Some Phyllomedusa species produce a waxy secretion that reduces the evaporative water loss of their bodies. If they begin to dry out, they move their limbs over their backs, where the secretory glands are, and spread the lipid secretion over their entire skin. Some indigenous groups from South America use the secretions of Phyllomedusa bicolor, the giant leaf frog, in shamanic hunting practices. The substance is said to intoxicate the hunters who ingest it, causing them to temporarily improve their sensorial capacities. ==Reproduction== In this genus of tree frogs, eggs are deposited on a leaf surface, interspersed with hydrating jelly capsules. During the mating process, the frogs fold the leaf around their batch of eggs using their limbs, with a jelly plug at the bottom of the folded leaf to prevent the eggs from falling out. At hatching, the jelly plug is liquified, and the tadpoles drop through the previously plugged hole. These nests are made above water, so the tadpoles drop into a suitable habitat, where they begin their lives as filter feeders. ==Scientific classification== Phyllomedusa tetraploidea Phyllomedusa venusta The following species are recognised in the genus Phyllomedusa: * Phyllomedusa bahiana * Phyllomedusa bicolor, giant leaf frog * Phyllomedusa boliviana * Phyllomedusa burmeisteri, Burmeister's leaf frog * Phyllomedusa camba * Phyllomedusa chaparroi * Phyllomedusa coelestis * Phyllomedusa distincta * Phyllomedusa iheringii * Phyllomedusa neildi * Phyllomedusa sauvagii, waxy monkey leaf frog * Phyllomedusa tarsius, tarsier leaf frog * Phyllomedusa tetraploidea * Phyllomedusa trinitatis * Phyllomedusa vaillantii * Phyllomedusa venusta Several other species formerly included in this genus are now placed in two other phyllomedusid genera: Callimedusa and Pithecopus. ==Captivity== The waxy monkey tree frog is known to be kept in captivity. ==Further reading== * ==References== ==External links== *Phyllomedusa Gallery with some infos *Use of the Phyllomedusa bicolor venom as a vaccine by the Matses Indians, with pharmacological info Category:Phyllomedusidae Category:Amphibian genera Category:Taxa named by Johann Georg Wagler ","title":"Phyllomedusa"},{"id":"3233389","text":"Fryderyk Getkant or Frederick Getkant (, , ) (1600‚Äì1666) was a Prussian military engineer of Lithuanian descent, artillery lieutenant and cartographer, (born in Ragnit or according to other sources in Rhineland, Holy Roman Empire).

On Friday December 2, 2011, Andrade was shot and wounded in Mexico's Ciudad Juarez, several times (some reports say she was shot five times) by a group of armed men as she was leaving work. The shooting was initially blamed by officials on an attempted carjacking. The focus of the investigation later changed when it was learned that Andrade received death threats on the day of the shooting. It was reported that unknown individuals contacted the school where she is employed the morning of the attack. These individuals asked various questions like when she arrived, when she would be leaving, and if she was planning to come to work in the afternoon. The unknown callers then threatened to be waiting outside the school for her after it was clear that the staff wasn't revealing any information. Many members of the Nuestras Hijas de Regreso a Casa A.C. have reported threats they have received in their fight against female homicide to the authorities.

TKR was created by writer/producers Rick Copp and David A. Goodman, based on the original series created by Glen A. Larson, who was an executive producer. TKR was produced by Gil Wadsworth and Scott McAboy and was distributed by Universal Domestic Television and ran only a single season of 22 one-hour episodes. ==Plot== The story is about a new team of high-tech crime fighters assembled by the Foundation for Law and Government (FLAG, formed by Wilton Knight) who follow in the tracks of the legendary Michael Knight and his supercar KITT. Instead of \\"one man making a difference\\", there are now five team members who each have a computerized talking vehicle counterpart. Like the original duo, TKR goes after notorious criminals who operate \\"above the law\\" ‚Äì from spies and assassins to terrorists and drug dealers. The final episode of the season, and series, featured the reappearance of Michael Knight (seen only from behind and played by a body double) at the very end, serving as a cliffhanger to the season which was never resolved due to the series being cancelled. ==Cast== ===Team Knight Rider members=== * Kyle Stewart, (played by Brixton Karnes), a former CIA agent and leader of TKR * Jenny Andrews, (played by Christine Steel), a former Marine and Gulf War veteran. An episode of the series insinuates she may be the daughter of Michael Knight, however the question is never resolved. * Duke DePalma, (played by Duane Davis), a former Chicago police officer and small-time boxer. * Erica West, (played by Kathy Trageser), a former con artist and thief who was given a second chance to use her skills for law enforcement. * Kevin \\"Trek\\" Sanders, (played by Nick Wechsler), a geeky yet handsome technical genius. His nickname was given to him by his parents, who are huge Star Trek fans. ===Other FLAG members=== * Gil, (played by Vince Waldron), one of the lead mechanics aboard Sky One. * Clayton, (played by Rick Copp), the head chef aboard Sky One. * Captain J.P. Wyatt, (played by Lowell Dean), the pilot of Sky One. * Dr. Felson, (played by Steve Sheridan), the medical doctor aboard Sky One. * Scott, (played by Michael Lexx), a mechanic aboard Sky One. * Shadow, (played by Steve Forrest), a mysterious person who guides and feeds the team information throughout the season, eventually revealed to be a holographic projection controlled by K.I.T.T. ===Other prominent characters=== * Jim Marland is a character that replaced the original series' Devon Miles as leader of FLAG and was responsible for the design and construction of KRO (See other vehicles below). Later, Marland stepped down and Stewart was given both operational and field service control over TKR. His mindset since the KRO incident was \\"One man can be given too much power\\" and thus the 5 vehicles were created, each with their own weaknesses. * Martin Jantzen, (played by Bill Bumiller), the criminally psychotic driver of K.R.O. * Mobius, (voiced by David McCallum), the wheelchair and ventilator bound, criminal mastermind behind season 1's inter- episode subplot. * Dennis, (played by Jim Fyfe), a mechanic aboard Sky One eventually revealed to be a mole paid off by Mobius to infect the cars with a computer virus. * Liz \\"Starr\\" Starrowitz, (played by Rainer Grant ), a criminal who later reappears as the sidekick/lover of Mobius, and as a member of Mobius's \\"Legion of Doom\\". * Max Amendes (listed as Max Amato in the credits of both episodes he appeared in and played by Jim Piddock), a criminal who later reappears as a member of Mobius's \\"Legion of Doom\\". * Kayla Gordon, (played by Marta Martin), a criminal who later reappears as a member of Mobius's \\"Legion of Doom\\". * Roland Laschewsky, (played by Roland Kickinger), Starr's bodyguard (and, therefore, Mobius' bodyguard as well). ==Production== ===Team vehicles=== Team Knight Rider use five different vehicles for their missions, each with its own computer AI system similar to the original Knight Industries 2000 vehicle. Unlike KITT, these are specialized units with specific roles in the team. In addition, after the K.R.O. incident, Garland has had each vehicle installed with intentional weaknesses to act as a fail- safe in case any of them go rogue. Although armored to protect their occupants, the vehicles do not share the original KITT's nearly indestructible \\"molecular bonded shell\\". Windows can be shattered by bullets or blown open with a small explosive, for example, while body panels can be damaged in collisions and roll-overs. The vehicles deploy their own self-repair system enabling the cars to fix their own minor damage ‚Äì shattered windows and crushed body panels have been shown \\"fixed\\" soon after taking damage. More severe impacts however, require body shop maintenance to repair the vehicles. *Dant√© (DNT-1), (voiced by Tom Kane), is a modified Ford Expedition sport utility vehicle driven by Kyle. The truck has enough room to transport the entire TKR team and functions like a mobile command center. Dant√©'s AI expresses himself in a haughty British manner and has no misgivings about making his driver and passengers feel uncomfortable. He is the de facto leader of the vehicles (if they'd ever listen to him) and he usually speaks on their behalf. *Domino (DMO-1), (voiced by Nia Vardalos), is a modified Ford Mustang convertible driven by Jenny. The AI's manner is sleek, sexy and flirtatious. She is also talkative and likes to gossip to the annoyance of the other TKR vehicles. *Attack Beast (BST-1), (voiced by Kerrigan Mahan), is a modified Ford F-150 full-sized pickup truck with off-road capability, driven by Duke. Beast's AI has a stubborn and argumentative attitude that talks tough and is not afraid to stand up to a fight. Much to Duke's embarrassment, Beast also has a fondness for the music of Alanis Morrissette. His favorite tactic is to crash through walls and surprise the enemy. Beast does not like to take orders from Duke or anyone else, but he is fiercely loyal and gets the job done. TKR member Jenny is the only one Beast will listen to, and his aggressive nature softens when she is around. *Kat (KAT-1), (voiced by Andrea Beutner), is a high-tech motorcycle that merges with her twin, Plato, to form the advanced High Speed Pursuit Vehicle, capable of high speeds and incredible maneuverability. Kat is driven by Erica and her AI has a polar opposite personality to that of her driver. Kat is always concerned with rules and regulations and is in constant conflict with Erica's amoral traits. She acts more like Erica's mother than her partner, but she will do whatever is necessary to get Erica out of a jam. *Plato (PLATO-1), (voiced by comedian John Kassir), is the other motorcycle that merges with his twin Kat to form the High Speed Pursuit Vehicle. Plato is driven by Trek and, like his operator, Plato is a nerdy brainiac completely consumed by facts, figures and data. Plato likes to quote television commercials and famous movie lines and talks in sort of a code that only Trek can understand. The two have developed a strange symbiotic relationship that the other TKR members can never figure out. ===Other vehicles=== *Sky One (SKY-1), (voiced by Linda M. McCollough), is a massive C5 military cargo airplane with special VTOL capability. Sky One acted as TKR's mobile base and vehicle transport, and carries a crew of 65, including the TKR field operatives, the flight crew, maintenance crew, mechanics, fire crew, kitchen staff, and medical staff. *K.R.O., (pronounced Crow, an acronym for Knight Reformulation One) was supposed to have been the replacement for KITT. KRO is a modified black Ferrari F355 with a highly unstable AI similar to KARR. After events that led to his murdering of five people, KRO was deactivated. KRO's operator, Martin Jantzen, was equally unstable. KRO later escapes to kill his creator and FLAG is forced to destroy him. KRO was voiced by John B. Wells. *K.A., short for Knight Alpha, a prototype vehicle introduced in \\"Legion of Doom\\" for a possible European Knight Rider team being prepared for delivery to Berlin. KA is a European-made Ford Ka compact hatchback. KA is capable of many languages, but refuses to speak English, preferring German. ==Episodes== { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" fff;\\" - ! 6A9CB3;\\" No. ! 6A9CB3;\\" Title ! 6A9CB3;\\" Directed by ! 6A9CB3;\\" Written by ! 6A9CB3;\\" Original air date } == See also == * Knight Rider franchise ==References*Team Knight Rider.com- Comprehensive website about the series *Team Knight Rider fansite Category:1997 American television series debuts Category:1998 American television series endings Category:American action television series Category:English-language television shows Category:NBC original programming Category:Knight Rider television series Category:Television series about robots Category:American sequel television series Category:Television series by Universal Television ","title":"Team Knight Rider"},{"id":"3233514","text":"Monument to the children of G≈Çog√≥w Inscription citing Gallus Anonymus: \\"It is better and more honourable if the citizens as well as the hostages die by the sword for the fatherland than by submission pay for a dishonourable life as slaves of alien masters.\\" The Siege of G≈Çog√≥w or Defense of G≈Çog√≥w (, ) was fought on 24 August 1109 at the Silesian town of G≈Çog√≥w, between the Kingdom of Poland and the Holy Roman Empire. Recorded by the medieval chronicler Gallus Anonymus it is one of the most well known battles in Polish history. The Polish forces were led by Duke Boles≈Çaw III Wrymouth, while the Imperial forces were under command of King Henry V of Germany. Boles≈Çaw was victorious. ==Prelude== After a long-term rivalry within the ruling Piast dynasty, Boles≈Çaw III in 1107 had finally expelled his elder half-brother and co-ruler Duke Zbigniew from Poland. Zbigniew fled to the Holy Roman Empire where he sought help from King Henry V. The king however did not take action, as he was stuck in an inner-Hungarian rivalry, supporting the √Årp√°d prince √Ålmos against his brother King Coloman, and had started an armed expedition to Bratislava (Pozsony). Henry tangled with Boles≈Çaw, when the Polish duke, loyal to King Coloman, took the occasion to campaign in the Bohemian lands in 1108: as soon as the Bohemian duke Svatopluk heard of the invasion, he left the Imperial army to oust the Polish troops. Left alone, King Henry was forced to abandon his Hungarian campaign. Chafing under this defeat, Henry finally associated himself with Zbigniew and requested Boles≈Çaw to reinstate his half-brother as co-ruler, as well as to pay an annual tribute to the Empire. The Polish duke categorically rejected both demands. The next year the German forces gathered at Erfurt, crossed the Polish border near Krosno on the B√≥br River, and on St. Bartholomew's Day approached the fortified town of G≈Çog√≥w (Svatopluk's troops arrived in September). At first they defeated a Polish garrison which was stationed near the town, while Boles≈Çaw rushed from his battle against the Pomeranians at Nak≈Ço. ==Siege== According to Gallus' Gesta principum Polonorum, King Henry resorted to lay siege to G≈Çog√≥w but granted its citizens a five-day ceasefire to ask their king for permission to surrender. He allegedly even made the townsmen give up their children as hostages as a guarantee of the ceasefire and promised to give them back alive no matter what Boles≈Çaw's answer would be. The Polish duke however had no intention to hand over the city and ordered the defense of G≈Çog√≥w. After the five days were up, King Henry began to barrage the town. Breaking his promise, he chained the child hostages to his siege engines, hoping that the people of G≈Çog√≥w would not shoot their own offspring, which would allow him to conquer the Polish settlement. However, Gallus stated that his cruelty towards children only strengthened the resolve of G≈Çog√≥w's defenders. Several harsh attacks by the Imperial army were repulsed, while Henry suffered significant losses by Polish guerilla fighters. After many days of unsuccessful fighting, the king was forced to abandon the siege and march south. ==Aftermath== King Henry's campaign turned out to be a complete failure, when it ended in Boles≈Çaw's final victory at the Battle of Hundsfeld (Psie Pole). Duke Svatopluk was assassinated - probably by Bohemian Vr≈°ovci liensmen - still at the G≈Çog√≥w camp on September 21. His successor Vladislaus reconciled with Boles≈Çaw, whereafter Zbigniew was able to return to Poland in 1111, only to be arrested and blinded by his half-brother shortly afterwards. Boles≈Çaw's position towards the Empire was strengthened, and in the following years he was able to consolidate his rule in Pomerania and Lubusz Land. It was not until 1157, when Emperor Frederick Barbarossa in aid of the Silesian duke W≈Çadys≈Çaw II the Exile launched a successful campaign to the Polish lands. After centuries-long ambivalent relations with Germany, the successful defense and the tradition of Henry's cruelty had evolved to a key element in the memory of the Polish nation. A first memorial stone was erected by the G≈Çog√≥w citizens on the occasion of the 850th anniversary of the battle in 1959. On 1 September 1979 a large Socialist Realistic memorial to the G≈Çog√≥w children was inaugurated to commemorate not only the 870th anniversary but also the 40th memorial day of the German Invasion of Poland. The Battle of G≈Çog√≥w is commemorated on the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, Warsaw, with the inscription \\"GLOGOW 1109\\". ==External links== *Battle of G≈Çog√≥w Category:1109 in Europe Category:12th century in Poland Category:History of Silesia Glogow Glogow Glogow Category:1100s in the Holy Roman Empire ","title":"Siege of G≈Çog√≥w"},{"id":"3233515","text":"Arkansas Highway 41 (AR 41, Hwy. 41) is a designation for two state highways in Western Arkansas.

After the encounter, due to the many dead and dying left on the battlefield; Kad≈Çubek remarked, that the \\"...dogs which, devouring so many corpses, fell into a mad ferocity, so that no one dared venture there.\\" Hence, the site became known as \\"dogs' field\\" (, ). Kad≈Çubek's relation was questioned in the late 19th century Encyklopedia Powszechna by Samuel Orgelbrand. Present-day historians are split on the issue, with some arguing that the battle was rather an unimportant skirmish, and the Chronica, written at the court of Boles≈Çaw's son Casimir II the Just almost hundred years after the event, is not fully reliable. Though, regardless of the magnitude, the clash contributed to Henry V's retreat.\\"S. Orgelbranda Encyklopedia Powszechna\\", Warsaw 1902, vol. XII, page 406M.

He was born along with his sister, Draupadi, from a yajna organised by king Drupada of Panchala. He was the commander-in-chief of the Pandava army during the entire Kurukshetra War i.e. for 18 days. Dhrishtadyumna killed Drona, the royal guru, when he was meditating in the ongoing battle, which was against the rules of engagement. ==Birth== Birth of Dhrishtadhyumna from yagna made by BILAL HABSI, folio of Razmnama After Pandavas and Kauravas completed their training under Drona, they were asked by Drona to attack and defeat Drupada as Gurudhakshina. Arjuna defeated Drupada. After Drupada's defeat, Panchala was divided into two parts. The enraged Drupada sought vengeance. None of Draupada's children could defeat Drona. So, he performed a yajna (sacrifice) to obtain a son, capable of killing Drona. From the holy flames of the yajna emerged a full grown man, who shone like the fire. The armoured youth held a sword and a bow in his hands. Drupada named him Dhrishtadyumna. After Dhrishtadyumna, a beautiful maiden Draupadi rose from the fire. After some time, Drona visited Panchala and met Dhrishtadyumna. Even though Dhrishtadyumna was prophesied as the slayer of Drona, he was accepted as a student by Drona; he learned advanced military arts. ==Draupadi's Swayamvar== Dhrishtadyumna explaining the rules of the competition Dhrishtadyumna hosted his sister Draupadi's swayamvar and told its rules to the kings and princes. When a young Brahmin won Draupadi in front of all the princes and nobility, Dhrishtadyumna secretly followed the Brahmin and his sister, only to discover that the Brahmin was in fact Arjuna, one of the five Pandava brothers. ==Marriage and children== Dhristadyumna in Javanese Wayang Dhrishtadyumna had multiple wives. He had 4 sons - Kshtradharman, Kshatravarman, Kshatranjaya and Dhrishtaketu. The first 3 were killed in the Kurukshetra War by Drona, whereas Dhrishtaketu was killed by Karna. ==Kurukshetra War== Dhristadyumna was appointed as the Senapati (commander-in-chief) of the Pandava Army in the Kurukshetra War against the Kauravas. He maintained his position till the end of the war. On the 15th day of the war, Drona killed Drupada. The Pandavas deceived a plot to capitalize on Drona's only weakness, his son Ashwatthama. The Pandava Bhima killed an elephant named Ashwatthama. The Pandavas spread the rumour of Ashwatthama's death. When Drona approached the eldest Pandava Yudhishthira, he confirmed that Ashwatthama was killed, but murmured that he does not know the elephant or the man; the latter part of his reply was overshadowed by conches of Pandava warriors. Thinking his son had died, Drona was heartbroken and surrendered his weapons. Drona sat down, started to meditate and his soul left his body in quest of Ashwatthama's soul. Dhristadyumna took his sword and decapitated Drona, killing him. ==Death== On the 18th night of the war, Ashwathama attacked the Pandava camp during the night, and killed Dhristadyumna. As Dhristadyumna begs for an honorable death, asking to die with a sword in his hand, Ashwathama ignores him, proceeding to beat and smother him to death by beheading him.K M Ganguly (1883-1896). The Mahabharatha Book 10: Sauptika Parva section 8 Ashwatthama killing Dhrishtadyumna, October 2003 ==Analysis== In one of the many side-stories of the Mahabharatha, there is drama centered around the fact that Dhrishtadyumna, despite not being Drupada's eldest, is his heir. While Drupada and others give many reasons for this, it is implied that the real reason is because Dhristadyumna has a godly parent, and thus more coveted as a ruler since his rule would seem more blessed. Dhristadyumna somewhat internalizes this, looking down upon Satyajit's pacifism and Shikhandi's single-minded hatred of Bhisma. He makes a point out of never bowing to or respecting his siblings, never wanting to legitimize any claim to Panchal they might have. ==References== ==See also== *Draupadi *Drupada Category:Characters in the Mahabharata ","title":"Dhrishtadyumna"},{"id":"3233553","text":"Mabel Grace Burkholder (1881-1973) was a Canadian writer and historian. ==Biography== Burkholder was born in 1881 to a family of German settlers.

However, a recipe for \\"Hopping John\\" in The Carolina Housewife by Sarah Rutledge, which was published in 1847, is also cited as the earliest reference. An even earlier source is Recollections of a Southern Matron, which mentions \\"Hopping John\\" (defined, in a note, as \\"bacon and rice\\") as early as 1838. The origins of the name are uncertain; one possibility is that the name is a corruption of the Haitian Creole term for black-eyed peas: pois pigeons (), or \\"pigeon peas\\" in English. ==History== Hoppin' John was originally a Lowcountry food before spreading to the entire population of the South. Hoppin' John may have evolved from rice and bean mixtures that were the subsistence of enslaved West Africans en route to the Americas. Hoppin' John has been further traced to similar foods in West Africa, in particular the Senegalese dish thiebou niebe. One tradition common in the United States is that each person at the meal should leave three peas on their plate to ensure that the New Year will be filled with luck, fortune and romance. Another tradition holds that counting the number of peas in a serving predicts the amount of luck (or wealth) that the diner will have in the coming year. On Sapelo Island in the community of Hog Hammock, Geechee red peas are used instead of black-eyed peas. Sea Island red peas are similar.The pea that could; Geechee red peas from Sapelo Island offer new hope for a community by John T.

Even though he was a career scholar and government official, he is best known for his military victories during the Third Goryeo- Khitan War. ==Early life== Gang was born on 22 December 948 into a prominent aristocratic family in the hyeon of Geumju (now Gwanak-gu in Seoul). His father also worked for the King Taejo of Goryeo, and had been awarded for helping establish a new dynasty and unifying the Korean Peninsula. A legend tells that on the day he was born a meteor fell toward his house, and an advisor to the king visited to find that a baby had just been born there, whom he predicted would become great and be long remembered. Gang Gam-chan's birth site is called Nakseongdae (site of the falling star, ÎÇôÏÑ±ÎåÄ,ËêΩÊòüÂûà ), near Seoul's Nakseongdae Station on the Line two subway. As a child, Gang was small for his age, but he showed signs of leadership and loyalty at an early age. At seven he began to learn Confucian philosophy, military tactics and martial arts from his father. After his father's death in 964, he left his household and traveled around the country. In 983, he received the top score in the civil service examination, and qualified as a government official at age thirty-six. In 992, he joined the royal court as a deputy under the Minister of Education. ==Goryeo-Khitan Wars== In 993, the Liao Dynasty ordered General Xiao Sunning to invade Goryeo. The opinions among the court officials were divided, either to fight against the Khitans or to negotiate with them. Gang supported the use of negotiations, which was also supported by the king as the official decision. Seo Hui was sent to General Xiao as Korean representative, and the successful truce negotiation led to the withdrawal of Khitan forces and establishment of friendly relationship between Liao and Goryeo. In 1004, the Khitans defeated the Chinese Song Dynasty and forced its emperor to pay tribute to the Khitan. With Song defeated, the only threat remaining against the Khitans was Goryeo. Also in 1009, General Gang Jo of Goryeo led a coup against the government; he deposed and murdered King Mokjong and began a military rule, and broke the peaceful relationship with the Khitans. The Khitans saw this as their reason to attack Goryeo, and in 1010, Emperor Shengzong of Liao led a massive invasion with a contingent of 400,000 soldiers, commanding the troops himself. Suffering heavy casualties in five major engagements, the Khitans finally defeated the Goryeo army and executed their commander General Gang Jo. However, Gang urged King Hyeonjong to escape from the palace, not to surrender to the invading Liao troops. The King followed Gang's advice, and managed to escape from the burning capital. A Korean insurgency began to harass Khitan forces, which finally compelled Shengzong to withdraw his army. The Khitans won the war, but gained no benefit from it; rather spending precious resources in vain and reducing the national treasury. Thus another bloody war between the two nations was foreshadowed, and tensions would further lead to the Third Goryeo-Khitan War. Gang was later promoted to Prime Minister. In 1018, General Xiao Baiya, under orders of the Liao administration, led an expedition to Goryeo with a 100,000 man contingent. This time, many officials urged the king to commence peace negotiations, since the damage from the Second Goryeo-Khitan War had been so great, leaving Goryeo difficult to recover. However, Gang advised the king to declare war against the Liao, since the enemy contingent was much smaller than in previous invasions. He volunteered to be the acting deputy War minister for the duration of the war, at the age of seventy-one. He led about 208,000:ko:Í∞ïÍ∞êÏ∞¨ men toward the Goryeo-Liao border. The first battle of the war was the Battle of Heunghwajin, which was a significant victory of Goryeo by blocking the stream and destroying the dam when Khitans were crossing the water. However, General Xiao did not give up the hope of capturing the capital Kaesung, and continued to march south. Later, Xiao realized that the mission was impossible to accomplish, and decided to retreat. General Gang knew that the Khitan army would withdraw from the war, and awaited them at the fortress of Gwiju, where he encountered the retreating Khitans in 1019. Discouraged and starving, the Khitans were defeated by the Goryeo army. Only General Xiao and few remaining survivors managed to escape from the devastating defeat. This battle is known as the Battle of Gwiju. General Gang returned to the capital and was welcomed as the military hero who saved the kingdom. After the war, Gang retired from both the military and the government to rest, since he was too old, already having become a national hero. He was appointed as Prime Minister in 1030, one year before his death. He died in 1031 on the 20th day of the 8th lunar month (9 September 1031). ==Legacy== Statue of Gang Gam-chan in Nakseongdae Park, Seoul, South Korea General Gang's overwhelming victories in the battles of Kwiju and Heunghwajin are often compared with the victories of General Eulji Mundeok at the Battle of Salsu or Admiral Yi Sun-sin at the battles of Hansan and Myeongnyang, which, like Gang's battles, overcame disadvantages and successfully defended the country. Of course, Gang is regarded as one of the greatest military commanders in Korean history, along with General Eulji and Admiral Yi, even though Gang was never trained as a soldier like Eulji or Yi. Following his victories in the Third Goryeo-Khitan War, the peace among the three powerful East-Asian empires settled; Goryeo established a peaceful but tense relationship with Liao Dynasty, which gave up the hope of taking over either Song or Goryeo. As a result, Goryeo broke off relationships with Song Dynasty, but continued commercial trading with the Chinese; Song continued to pay tribute to Liao, and Song would also pay tribute to Western Xia, which would pay tribute to the Khitans. The peace lasted for about a century. The Jurchens took advantage of this time to expand their power without any interruption until their establishment of Jin Dynasty. Song Dynasty got the least benefit from the peace, and secretly encouraged the Jurchens to attack Liao, but after the fall of the Khitans, the Jurchens turned on Song and took over its capital, forcing the Chinese to flee southward. The victories of General Gang thus marked the ending point of the chain of wars between countries and was the beginning of a triangle diplomacy (Goryeo, Liao, Song), setting the scene for the ascendance of the Jurchens. Gang's shrine, called Anguksa, stands today in Sadang-dong, Gwanak-gu, Seoul. ==Popular culture== * Portrayed by Lee Deok-hwa in the 2009 KBS2 TV series Empress Cheonchu. ==See also== *List of Goryeo people *Military history of Korea *Battle of Kwiju *Goryeo *Goryeo-Khitan Wars *List of Korea-related topics ==References== ==External links== *Tomb of General Gang Gam-Chan Category:948 births Category:1031 deaths Category:People from Seoul Category:Goryeo people Category:Korean generals Category:Goryeo‚ÄìKhitan War ","title":"Gang Gam-chan"},{"id":"3233592","text":"Little Red Riding Hood () is a fairy-tale opera for children in two acts (three tableaux) by C√©sar Cui, composed in 1911.

Act I, Tableau 1. The chorus introduces the story. The setting is the edge of a forest; the porch of Little Red Riding Hood's house is off to the side. As little Red Riding Hood goes off to take a basket of fresh cakes to her ill grandmother, her Mother warns her not to dawdle in the woods or to talk to strangers.

When he challenges her to see who will get there first, she agrees, and both of them run off in different directions as the woodcutters resume their work. Act II. The chorus appears again to explain that the Wolf has not eaten for three days and was able to get to Grandmother's house first. We see inside Grandmother's cottage and outside, a glade. The Wolf, pretending to be Riding Hood, manages to get into the house and swallow Grandmother. He takes her place in the bed before Riding Hood arrives. In several questions she expresses her surprise at how differently Grandmother looks now, and the Wolf swallows her. Some hunters and woodcutters, who have been tracking the Wolf, come by and enter the house. They find the Wolf in his sleep and open his belly to let Grandmother and Riding-Hood out. After they sew up the Wolf again, he repents and is permitted to live in the forest as long as he lives up to his promise to be good. ==Bibliography== *Cui, C√©sar. –ö—Ä–∞—Å–Ω–∞—è —à–∞–ø–æ—á–∫–∞: –¥–µ—Ç—Å–∫–∞—è –æ–ø–µ—Ä–∞-—Å–∫–∞–∑–∫–∞ [Little Red Riding-Hood: opera-fairytale for children]. –ú–æ—Å–∫–≤–∞: –ü–µ—á–∞—Ç–Ω–∏–∫, 1912.

The series comprises five 50-minute programmes, each one followed by Under the Skin, a 10-minute section that features Attenborough interviewing the scientists whose work has led to the sequences included in the main programme. It also examines the challenges faced by the crew and reveals some of the techniques used to film the series.BBC Press Office: Life in Cold Blood The series is a co- production between the BBC and Animal Planet. The executive producer is Sara Ford and the series producer is Miles Barton. The Under the Skin segments were produced by James Brickell in collaboration with the Open University. The score for the main films was composed by David Poore and Ben Salisbury, whilst the music for Under the Skin was written and performed by Tony Briscoe. The series won the 2009 BAFTA Television Award in the Specialist Factual category. Within David Attenborough's 'Life' series, it is preceded by Life in the Undergrowth (2005). == Background == Filming began in the early part of 2006 and, as with Attenborough's previous series, the production team travelled the world to photograph the required sequences. In May 2006, Attenborough celebrated his 80th birthday in the Gal√°pagos Islands while filming giant tortoises, one of which, called Lonesome George, was thought to be the same age.BBC David Attenborough biography Lonesome George died on 24 June 2012; he was believed to have been more than 100 years old. Several innovative techniques were used to capture footage. Thermal imaging cameras were used to demonstrate the creatures' variable body temperatures, probe cameras allowed access to underground habitats and even a matchbox-sized one was attached to the shell of a tortoise.BBC Science and Nature: Life in Cold Blood filming techniques Expert scientists helped the producers to film animal behaviour that is rarely seen. The team 'staked out' radiotagged timber rattlesnakes in order to witness one of them despatching its prey. However, for Attenborough's close encounter with a spitting cobra, a captive snake that was used to being handled was placed in a natural setting and the presenter wore a face visor. Other examples of 'pets' being used were for sequences depicting the lassoing tongue of a chameleon (which had to be filmed at ultra-high speed) and the digestive system of a python (which was enhanced by computer-generated imagery). Life in Cold Blood is Attenborough's last major series and also represents the final study in his 'Life' series, which comprises 79 programmes. In a 2008 interview, he stated: > The evolutionary history is finished. The endeavour is complete. If you'd > asked me 20 years ago whether we'd be attempting such a mammoth task, I'd > have said 'Don't be ridiculous'.

Operate and maintain (organizational and Intermediate level) marine boilers, pumps, forced draft blowers, and heat exchangers; perform tests, transfers, and inventory of lubricating oils, fuels, and water. Maintain records and reports, and may perform duties in the generation and stowage of industrial gases.\\" Enlistees are taught the fundamentals of this rating through on-the-job training or formal Navy schooling. Advanced technical and operational training is available in this rating during later stages of career development.NAVPERS 18068F Machinist's Mates (submarine) and Machinist's Mate (surface) generally fall into one of three roles: Machinist's Mates repairing a simulated cracked pipe with soft patch during a general quarters drill aboard === Propulsion mechanics === The core job of a Machinist's Mate is the engine room. A mechanic's job in the engine room is to operate the steam plant that provides propulsion, electric power (along with Electrician's Mates), potable water, and service steam to the ship. Machinist's Mates operate the boilers that generate the steam and use it to operate main engine (propulsion turbines), turbo generators, distilling units, and various auxiliary turbines. This job was previously performed by Boiler Technicians, however, the BT rating merged with Machinist's Mate in 1997. Machinist's Mates working in the propulsion plants are often referred to as \\"pit snipes,\\" \\"hole snipes,\\" or just \\"snipes\\" for short. Machinist's Mates responsible for the propulsion plant are found in machinery division (or main engine division, main propulsion division, etc. in some ships), commonly referred to simply as M-Division or MP-Division. On surface nuclear ships, propulsion mechanics are found in Reactor Propulsion Division (commonly still referred to as M-Div), Reactor Mechanical (RM) Division, or Reactor Laboratories (RL) Division. was the exception, in that M-Division was still part of Engineering Department, as opposed to Reactor Department. Navy Times of 7 January 2013 reports the Navy will be realigning Machinist's Mate, and Engineman ratings. EN whose primary skills are in maintaining auxiliary engineering will become MMs. EN aboard ship will now concentrate strictly on diesel propulsion which powers many amphibious ships, while all surface shipboard auxiliary machinery work will be under the MM rating. This will affect almost 2000 ENs. === Auxiliary mechanics === The other major place to find Machinist's Mates is in the auxiliaries division of engineering department, often referred to as \\"A-gang\\". Mechanics in this role establish training & work on mechanical equipment within and outside of the engine rooms. To include the operation and preventive maintenance of: air conditioning and refrigeration units, liquid oxygen and nitrogen units, hydraulic lifting and hoisting gear, hydraulic power plant components and mechanisms, chilled and fresh water, atmosphere control, ventilation, emergency diesel and corresponding sub-systems, ballast control, auxiliary drain, compressed air and gases, plumbing, trash disposal & other equipment as designated by the Engineering Officer (Chief Engineer, or CHENG). Members of \\"A-gang\\" may also help Damage Controlman, Gunner's Mates, or other ratings. Some listed attributes apply to Submarine Warfare to include SUBSAFE requirements for work authorization. All systems listed apply to a minimum of valve, pump maintenance repair. \\"A-gang\\" rates can be submarine qualified and will go through BESS (Basic Enlisted Submarine School) and then proceed forward to their A-school training specific to Machinist Mate rate where they will learn the above mentioned skills. This schooling takes place in Groton, Connecticut. A Machinist's Mate takes readings in the engine room of the multi-purpose amphibious assault ship . === Nuclear mechanics === Some MMs are qualified to work on nuclear propulsion plants. They are designated as Machinist's Mate nuclear (MMN). These mechanics go through a rigorous training program consisting of three months at the Nuclear Field \\"A\\" School or in previous years Machinist's Mate \\"A\\" School, six months of Naval Nuclear Power Training Command also known as Nuclear Power School, and six months at one of several Nuclear Power Training Units (NPTU). Two NPTUs are moored training ships (MTS) using S5W reactors located at the Naval Weapons Station in Charleston, South Carolina, and two additional NPTUs are land-based prototype units using a modified S5W reactor (MARF DMC) and an S8G reactor located in Ballston Spa, New York. NPTU Idaho (now decommissioned) at the Naval Reactors Facility operated the first prototype from 1953 to the mid-1990s which was for the USS Nautilus (SSN-571), named S1W, the prototype for the USS Enterprise (CVN-65), named A1W, and S5G, which are all shutdown and defueled. This course of instruction is commonly referred to as \\"the nuclear-power pipeline.\\" MMNs earn a 3385 NEC (surface) or 3355 (submarines) upon completion of prototype. Along with the normal duties of a propulsion mechanic, they are responsible for the operation, maintenance, and repair of the auxiliary equipment in support of the Naval reactor(s) under their care. Later in his/her career before the 18th month after reporting to the CVN/SSN/SSBN/SSGN, the MMN must qualify his/her senior in-rate watchstation. The following are for NIMITIZ CVN-68 Class (A4W) of Surface MMN's (Chief Reactor Watch for surface MMNs in Reactor Mechanical (RM) Division or Chief Machinery Operator for those in Machinery Division, and Engine Room Supervisor for submariners and FORD CVN-78 Class (A1B) Surface MMN's). The MMN must wait 5 years and be an E-5/E-6 to earn a 3395 (surface both CVN Class) or 3365 (submarines) NEC. Additionally, some MMNs are designated as Engineering Laboratory Technicians (NEC 3386 for surface, 3356 for submariners) in Reactor Laboratories (RL) Division following successful completion of an additional 13 weeks of training. ELTs are water chemistry and radiological controls experts for their commands in addition to maintaining other MMN watchstation qualifications. After completion of required watchstation qualification, submarine ELTs may complete an additional senior in-rate watchstation in order to be assigned a supervisory NEC of 3366. For surface ELTs to achieve the supervisory NEC of 3396, they must complete a list of additional requirements. This designation is important as it garners additional pay and consideration during advancement. Also, on submarines, some MMNs are designated as submarine nuclear propulsion plant emergency welders (NEC 3351). They go through a two-month school learning welding, brazing, and soldering from Hull Maintenance Technician senior enlisted welders. Each submarine is required to have at least one of them to go underway. They are on board to provide emergency repairs to the plant if necessary to get the ship back to port where shipyard welders can complete a certified repair. === Various machinist's mate ratings === The range of machinist's mate ratings include: * MM - Machinist's Mate * MM/SS - Machinist's Mate - Submarine Qualified * MM/SW - Machinist's Mate - Surface Qualified * MM(A) - Machinist's Mate (auxiliary) * MM(A)(GE) - Machinist's Mate (A) (bombing) * MM(A)(H) - Machinist's Mate (A) (hydrogen) * MM(A)(P) - Machinist's Mate (A) (Photographic) * MM(CBE) - Machinist's Mate (construction battalion) (equipment operator) * MM(MB) - Machinist's Mate (motor boat) * MM(N) - Machinist's Mate (nuclear) * MM(O) - Machinist's Mate (optician) * MM(SRE) - Machinist's Mate (ship repair) (engine operator) * MM(SRI) - Machinist's Mate (ship repair) (instrument maker) * MM(SRO) - Machinist's Mate (ship repair) (outside machinist) * MM(SRS) - Machinist's Mate (ship repair) (inside machinist) * MME - Machinist's Mate (engineman) * MMG - Machinist's Mate (industrial gas generating) * MML - Machinist's Mate (general) * MMR - Machinist's Mate (refrigeration mechanic) * MMS - Machinist's Mate (shop mechanic) * MMARS - Machinist's Mate (arm regulation squad) ==References== OPNAV INSTRUCTION 1220.1D CHANGING OR REMOVING PRIMARY NAVY ENLISTED CLASSIFICATION CODES FOR NUCLEAR PROPULSION PLANT OPERATORS. dated 3 Jun 09 Category:Machinists Category:United States Navy ratings ","title":"Machinist's mate"},{"id":"3233607","text":"The peso was the currency of Guatemala between 1859 and 1925. ==History== The peso replaced the real, with 1 peso = 8 reales.

Between 1915 and 1923, provisional coins were issued, in denominations of 12¬Ω and 25 centavos in 1915, and 50 centavos in 1922, and 1 and 5 pesos in 1923. ==References== * ==Templates== Category:History of Guatemala Category:Modern obsolete currencies Category:1859 establishments in Guatemala Category:1925 disestablishments Category:Currencies of Guatemala ","title":"Guatemalan peso"},{"id":"3233610","text":"Hemopneumothorax, or haemopneumothorax is the condition of having air in the chest cavity (pneumothorax) and blood in the chest cavity (hemothorax). A hemothorax, pneumothorax, or the combination of both can occur due to an injury to the lung or chest. ==Cause== The pleural space is located anatomically between the visceral membrane, which is firmly attached to the lungs, and the parietal membrane which is firmly attached to the chest wall (a.k.a. ribcage and intercostal muscles, muscles between the ribs). The pleural space contains pleural fluid. This fluid holds the two membranes together by surface tension, as much as a drop of water between two sheets of glass prevents them from separating. Because of this, when the intercostal muscles move the ribcage outward, the lungs are pulled out as well, dropping the pressure in the lungs and pulling air into the bronchi, when we 'breathe in'. The pleural space is maintained in a constant state of negative pressure (in comparison to atmospheric pressure). If the chest wall, and thus the pleural space, is punctured, blood, air or both can enter the pleural space. Air and/or blood rushes into the space in order to equalise the pressure with that of the atmosphere. As a result, the fluid is disrupted and the two membranes no longer adhere to each other. When the rib cage moves out, it no longer pulls the lungs with it. Thus the lungs cannot expand, the pressure in the lungs never drops and no air is pulled into the bronchi. Respiration is not possible. The affected lung, which has a great deal of elastic tissue, shrivels in what is referred to as a collapsed lung. ==Treatment== Treatment for this condition is the same as for hemothorax and pneumothorax independently: by tube thoracostomy, the insertion of a chest drain through an incision made between the ribs, into the intercostal space. A chest tube must be inserted to drain blood and air from the pleural space so it can return to a state of negative pressure and function normally. Commonly, surgery is needed to close off whatever injuries caused the blood and air to enter the cavity (e.g. stabbing, broken ribs). ==See also== * Catamenial pneumothorax * Tension pneumothorax * Pulmonary contusion ==References== == External links == Category:Chest trauma Category:Disorders of fascia Category:Medical emergencies Category:Diseases of pleura ","title":"Hemopneumothorax"},{"id":"3233617","text":"Ivan ≈†uba≈°iƒá (; 7 May 1892 - 22 March 1955) was a Yugoslav politician, best known as the last Ban of Croatia and prime minister of the royalist Yugoslav Government in exile during the Second World War.Journal of Croatian Studies, XXVIII-XXIX, 1987‚Äì88 - Annual Review of the Croatian Academy of America, Inc.

He moved to Iowa in 1923 to become associate editor of literary magazine The Midland (\\"the most important magazine America had produced,\\" according to H.L. Mencken) in Iowa City for a year. During the same time he took courses in creative writing at Iowa State University.

Web, Apr. 1, 2011. In 1931, Knister moved to Montreal, Quebec. There he became acquainted with the poets of the Montreal Group - with poet Leo Kennedy he began planning an anthology, similar to his Canadian Short Stories,Leo Kennedy of Canadian modernist poetry (an idea that eventually resulted in the landmark New Provinces in 1936). He also got to know poet Dorothy Livesay and novelist Frederick Philip Grove. Grove read My Star Predominant, and encouraged Knister to enter the manuscript in the Graphic Publishers' Canadian Novel contest. (Knister's daughter later said that her mother had encouraged him to enter the novel.) Knister cut the book to 120,000 words, mailed it off, and forgot about it. My Star Predominant won the $2,500.00 first prize in the 1931 cross-Canada contest. However, \\"owing to the failure of the firm of publishers which offered the prize,\\" the novel was not published.\\"Knister, Raymond,\\" Encyclopedia of Canada (Toronto: University Associates, 1948), III, 346. In 1932, Ryerson Press, which had picked up the rights to My Star Predominant, offered Knister a job as an editor. Before he was to begin working there, Knister drowned in a swimming accident on Lake St. Clair while on a picnic with his family. (In a memoir published in the 1949 Collected Poems of Raymond Knister, Livesay maintained that Knister had committed suicide. His wife and daughter strongly disputed that allegation.) My Star Predominant was published in 1934 in Canada by Ryerson and also in England. Knister's daughter, Imogen Givens, wrote a 5,000-word memoir of him, \\"Raymond Knister: Man or Myth?\\". The memoir, which made extensive use of her mother's diary, was published in the journal Essays on Canadian Writing (No. 16, Fall-Winter 1979‚Äì80). In 2007, Alberta poet Micheline Mayler published Full Depth: The Raymond Knister Poems, an account of Knister's life and death written as a series of poems.\\"Full Depth: The Raymond Knister Poems,'\\" Wolzak and Wynn, Web, Apr. 3, 2011 Knister is buried in Port Dover, Ontario. His poem \\"Change\\" is inscribed on his tombstone. Dorothy Livesay has claimed that \\"Knister seemed to epitomize the struggle of a generation\\" (\\"Memoir\\" xxxvii). The struggle of his generation of writers was to bring Canadian poetry into the Twentieth Century. Like E.J. Pratt, W.W.E. Ross, Arthur Stringer (whose Open WaterArthur Stringer, Open Water (Toronto: Bell and Cockburn, 1914). was the first book of modernist free verse by a Canadian), and others, Knister was a \\"Transitional modern\\"Sandra Djwa, \\"The 1920s: E.J.

Pratt Symposium (Ottawa: University of Ottawa Press, 1977), 55‚Äì68. whose poetry, fiction, and criticism showed the effects of the many forces which were changing Canadian poetry and Canadian society. ==Writing== Besides his four novels, Knister wrote roughly one hundred poems, almost as many short stories and sketches, and dozens of critical works, including essays, editorials, and book reviews. \\"To his own writing and criticism, Knister brought a mind attuned to new literary developments.\\" ===Fiction=== After 1925 Knister devoted less time to poetry and more to fiction. Two of his novels, White NarcissusRaymond Knister, White Narcissus (1929: rpt. Toronto: McClelland and Stewart, 1962). and My Star Predominant,Raymond Knister, My Star Predominant (Toronto: Ryerson, n.d.) were published in his lifetime. Although he was known and respected by writers such as Morley Callaghan, Mazo de la Roche, Sir Charles G.D. Roberts, and A.J.M. Smith, Knister was never a popular success. \\"Farm work provided him with realistic details for his stories and his first novel, White Narcissus (1929).\\" Set in rural Ontario, \\"The novel concerns a writer, Richard Milne, who returns home in order to make a final attempt to convince his childhood sweetheart, Ada Lethen, to marry him. Ada feels it is her duty to stay at home because for years, as a consequence of a quarrel, her parents have communicated only through her.... While the novel is usually and justly considered a work of realism, it has also been suggested that it contains elements of romanticism, and that the lyricism of some passages approaches prose-poetry.\\" Knister's fiction provides us with some important clues for a clearer understanding of his verse. In My Star Predominant Knister has Keats give voice to ideas about poetry which are really his own. The novel shows Keats going through a process of growth as an artist. He progresses from sentimentality to a desire for direct contact with life and from ignorance to self-knowledge. He says that \\"a man's knowledge of his faults, so they do not paralyse his endeavors, is a good thing\\" (p. 160) and he recalls that as a boy he would have granted artists exemption \\"from the common tribulations of mankind\\" (p. 267). Although Knister did not write poetry in the manner of Keats, it is plausible to assume that he went through a similar series of changes. In 2006 Black Moss Press published There Was a Mr. Cristi, a previously unknown novel discovered by Knister's daughter Imogen. In it, Knister tells the tale of a woman who leaves her husband in 1930s Ontario, and moves to Toronto to open a boarding house. \\"What follows is a fascinating tale of life in the 1930s in a house that is inhabited by all these bizarre characters.

In both his poetry and his fiction Knister presented sharply realistic portrayals of everyday images and events in order to illustrate their exceptional qualities, and communicated these impressions in a conversational language style.\\" Also read the hokku-like \\"Reverie: The Orchard on the Slope,\\" the metaphysical \\"Change\\", and the whimsical \\"The Quiet Snow.\\" Though the nationalist in him sometimes warned against Americanization, King was also a prime example of the increasing importance of American literature as an influence on Canadian writers in the Twenties. Knister served his literary apprenticeship in the American midwest and his poetry, like Carl Sandburg's, was regional and realistic. The American poet for whom Knister showed the highest regard was Edwin Arlington Robinson. In \\"A Great Poet for Today\\"Raymond Knister, \\"A Great Poet of To-day,\\" The First Day of Spring (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1976), pp. 412‚Äì19. Knister praised Robinson for his ability to create characters as well as any novelist and for his skill in adapting his form to suit the character he is describing. Robinson's style he said, \\"is clear and apparently casual, fitting the matter as well-made garments fit a form. It is a sinuous idiom which allows the freest expression to the foibles and intricacies of characters\\" (p. 413). Although the forms of Knister's poetry were derived from the Imagists, he also owed a good deal to A.E. Housman and to the English Georgians. Aside from Robinson, \\"Housman was the poet for whom Knister had the highest praise.\\"See Raymond Knister, \\"A Shropshire Lad,\\" The First. Day of Spring, pp. 419‚Äì27. The qualities which Knister lauded in the work of the British poet are also central to his own verse. Knister commented upon the characters Housman had chosen. He said that \\"doubtless for centuries there had subsisted this soul- loving, life-loving, inarticulate but artlessly downright yeoman, the backbone of English armies and, in later stages, for all his rootedness in England, particularly rural England, the basis of such large things as colonization and world exploration,\\" (p. 419). Of course, Knister's characters were also simple farmers, \\"soil-loving, life-loving, inarticulate.\\" Knister also commented upon Housman's portrayal of a youth's discovery of life's complexities and \\"of the inevitability of love and death\\" (p. 421). In his own poetry Knister explored the differences between the world of the child and that of the adult. The moment when the boy crosses from innocence to knowledge is central to a number of his stories as well. Another side of A Shropshire Lad which received his approval was its realism. Knister claimed that it is this realism which accounted for the book's continued popularity. He contrasted Housman's realism with the artificiality of contemporaries: :there was the contrast with the reigning artificial Yellow Book school of the nineties, then in the ascendancy with Wilde, Yeats, Symons, Le Gallienne as high- priests ... Housman arrived on this flower plot scene with his lad made of the stuff of eternal human clay, with the high spirits, the wistfulness, the flesh and blood, dreams and passions known to the English scene for centuries and crying out for portrayal ... Here, in fine, was life, and the public which loved poetry was not long in discovering it. :(p. 425) Despite these general similarities it is difficult to find specific echoes of Housman in Knister because their styles are so different. One can also trace the effects of the Georgians upon Knister. Like Housman, many of them wrote about the country life and the people who lived close to the land. Once again it is easy to see how Knister shared general characteristics, but difficult to perceive specific similarities because of his imagist style. Two Georgians who seem to have especially influenced Knister are Edward Thomas and Edwin Muir, both of whom often describe farm life. Poet Anne Burke says of Knister: \\"Like Edwin Arlington Robinson whom he reviewed as 'A Great Poet of Today' his work is exemplified by simple straightforward stanzas about modern life and aims at the starkness of absolute truth. Note 'Wind's Way,' 'Reply to August,' 'Night Whistling,' 'Moments When I'm Feeling Poems,' 'Autumn Clouds,' and others. The complexity of Knister's work, like that of Robert Frost, has been overlooked because of its surface simplicity, bucolic tone, and emphasis on exactly what the poet felt. Knister on his Ontario farm resembles the adolescent Frost especially A Boy's Will, 1913 and North of Boston, 1914.\\"Anne Burke, Introduction to \\"Some Annotated Letters of A.J.M. Smith and Raymond Knister,\\" Canadian Poetry: Studies/Documents/Reviews No. 11 (Fall/Winter 1982), Canadian Poetry, UWO, Web, Apr. 3, 2011. In 2003 After Exile, the first reprint of Knister's verse in over 20 years, was released by Toronto's Exile Editions. The book presents dozens of poems never before in book form, plus 30 new poems, and selected prose pieces and letters.Raymond Knister, After Exile, (, Toronto: Exile, 2003), Web, Apr. 2, 2011 ==Critical Writing== Like his contemporaries in the McGill movement Knister was a rebel, and his criticism showed his dissatisfaction with the state of Canadian poetry and the Canadian literary milieu. The most important point raised in Knister's critical writings, one which is applicable to his own verse, was his rejection of the sublime in the language and thought of poetry. In general Canadian taste favoured a style of writing which was \\"a refreshing haven of genuine romanticism to which the reader may retreat when he seeks an antidote to the intellectual tension imposed by the future progeny of 'The Wasteland' and 'Spoon River' \\"Lionel Stevenson, Appraisals of Canadian Literature (Toronto: Macmillan, 1926), p. 62. Knister, however, valued plough horses above winged ones, and in the foreword to the Collected Poems he set out his objectives as a poet. His primary aim was to make his poems 'real' and to escape the false tone which made most Canadian poetry of his day an inaccurate portrayal of life. In order to do this he intended to drop all attempts at idealistic sublimity and instead simply present the images of things as accurately as possible. \\"We would feel differently about many other common things if we saw them clearly enough\\" (vii‚Äìviii). One more complaint which Knister had against Canadians was that they were 'colonials'. He ably described their cultural colonialism when he wrote of the \\"ideal Canadian litterateur\\" as > a man who has been educated as an English gentleman, though certain New > England Universities will pass; in addition he should know about Canada as > accurately and sympathetically as possible from the point of view of an > omniscient tourist who, after all, knows better things. We want not so much > to be different as to have had different experiences about which we can talk > at tea as suavely as anybody. It amounts in fact to our wanting to be > American or English with an added background which will lend chic.Raymond > Knister, \\"Canadian Literati,\\" Journal of Canadian Fiction, No. 14 (1975), > 160. Verse written by someone with such an outlook could not help but be unrealistic in its treatment of Canadian subjects. One need only look in issues of The Canadian Magazine from the period to find such poetry in abundance. Knister also attacked the conservatism of Canadian taste, especially as it was reflected in the magazines. Arthur Stringer, in his opinion, was forced to become a writer of murder mysteries because the Canadian reading public refused to accept the innovative poetry in Open Water. Another example he cited was Pratt, whose poem \\"The Witches Brew\\" could not find a Canadian publisher until after it had appeared in The London Mercury. Knister himself was unable to find a Canadian magazine which would print his work: > My poems and stories were so Canadian and came so directly from the soil > that Canadian editors would have nothing to do with them. The injustice was > perhaps, trifling; the quite modest merits of my efforts were adequately > rewarded by the audience, fit though few, of the \\"little\\" magazines [sic]. > But they weren't morally subversive, nor eccentric mannered, these attempts. > It seems gruesomely significant that not a Canadian editor would have > anything to do with them. (\\"Canadian Literati,\\" 162) Implicit in his comments was the conviction that this conservatism was a direct result of colonialism and the dulled appetite for sublimity. His bitter feeling that he was one of a generation of writers who were being ignored is obvious. Although many of Knister's contemporaries were equally unhappy with the state of Canadian poetry, only he dared to attack established writers by name. In \\"Canadian Letter\\" Knister dismissed Carman, Maclnnis, Leacock, Roberts, and D.C. Scott with the comment that \\"their contributions were made at a time when any impulse in a backwater would have been valued\\" (p. 381). Elsewhere he compared Lampman's style to \\"one of those rambling, barrack-like houses once common to New England and our own eastern landscapes,\\"Raymond Knister, \\"The Poetry of Archibald Lampman.\\" The First Day of Spring, pp. 457‚Äì8. formerly stylish but now outdated. Just as the smaller bungalow had replaced the large family home, so too would the more compact verse replace nineteenth- century styles. The tone of these attacks is disturbing. Leacock, Lampman, Roberts, and the others he mentioned do not deserve to be relegated to some literary trash heap. We must remember that at this time Roberts and the others had the status of literary giants and that one dramatic way for a newcomer to get attention has always been to play the part of the iconoclast. This, probably, was what Knister was doing in his excessively fierce criticism. Knister was not, however, a mere fault-finder. He was prepared to offer a solution to the problems he perceived. In his opinion, Canada needed a little magazine \\"devoted to creative work ... perhaps only a few pages every month, yet chosen for vital quality ... which should give a voice to what is actually being lived among us\\" (\\"Canadian Letter,\\" p. 379). Through this medium, he hoped, a distinctively Canadian voice would be heard. ==Publications== ===Poetry=== * Collected Poems of Raymond Knister. Dorothy Livesay ed.

The use of traction splints to treat complete long bone fractures of the femur is common in prehospital care. Evidence to support their usage, however, is poor.A dynamic traction splint has also been developed for intra-articular fractures of the phalanges of the hand. ==Medical uses== Traction splints are most commonly used for fractures of the femur (or upper leg bone). For these fractures they may reduce pain and decrease the amount of bleeding which occurs into the soft tissues of the leg. Some state that they are appropriate for middle tibia fractures which are displaced or bent. Others state they should not be used for lower leg fractures. Often a pillow splint or rigid splint is best in this situation. All agree that traction splints should only be applied when there are no fractures of the pelvis or knee and the fracture has not broken through the skin with bone visible. Use of a traction splint while other fractures in the leg exist will cause the weaker fracture site to pull apart and not the targeted femur fracture. ==Models== There are two groups of traction splints: * The Thomas half-ring group, which includes the Thomas splint, the modified Thomas splint, the QD-4 Hare traction splint and the Donway traction splint * Non-half-ring group, which includes the Sager splint, and the most advanced; CT-EMS, Carbon Fiber traction system. The basic principle is that one end of the traction splint is positioned against the hip, and pushes upward against the pelvic bone. A strap around the foot and ankle is connected to the other end of the splint, and tightened to counteract the muscle tension and produce traction. Only then are additional straps added to aid immobilization of the limb. The Thomas half-ring splints consist of a padded half-circle of steel which is strapped to the hip, hinged to a U-shaped rod that extends along both sides of the leg. An ankle strap may be fashioned from cloth, and tied or twisted to apply traction force. It was devised by H.O. Thomas, initially for immobilization for tuberculosis of the knee. It is now commonly used for the immobilization of hip and thigh injuries. The modified Thomas splint adapted the original Thomas splint to include a traction screw and foot plate and limb support built into the splint body. The Hare traction splint is a further adaptation of the Thomas splint. Its length is adjustable via telescoping rods, and it has built-in straps to support the hip and leg at several points along its length. It also provides a more comfortable ankle strap and a small winch that makes it much easier to apply and adjust traction force. The Sager splint consists of a metallic splint that is placed between the person's legs. Some models may be placed on the side closest to the injury for bilateral femur fractures without pelvic trauma. Straps are then applied, first at the thigh and then at the ankle, to strap the injured leg to the pole and provide support. The pole is extended to supply the needed traction, and then both legs are wrapped with cravat-like straps. The Kendrick traction device (KTD) eliminates the need for leg-raising and unnecessary rolling of the patient, and can be easily applied to both pediatric and adult applications. It consists of a round pole that can be located on the lateral aspect of the leg, with straps at the upper thigh and ankle for immediate placement, and three wider straps for immobilization. It is very light at 20 ounces. The KTD does not afford the rotational stability normally seen in long bone traction splints. The CT-6 was introduced in the 21st century and utilizes a 4:1 pulley system to achieve precise and powerful, when necessary, traction. This splint is built with carbon fiber tubing and weighs 500 grams. In 2003 the CT-6 was chosen as the splint of choice by the US military and currently has over 30,000 in the field. Its compact and light design, along with its greatly improved traction method, had greatly enhanced its popularity. The Donway traction splint is a pneumatic splint that can be applied to a patient in situ. Acting on the ankle and groin pressure is then applied via an integrated pump. The devices itself consists of a metal frame that surrounds the leg that is then strapped into place. The STS (Slishman Traction Splint) is another lateral monopole traction splint. It is lightweight and compact, however, it differs from the KTD and CT-6 in that it does not stick out past the foot. It offers a proximal point of traction, rather than distal, making it better suited for tight transports in ambulances, helicopters or baskets. The STS can also be used despite lower extremity trauma, because the distal strap can be applied proximal to the calf or patella. Rotational stability is provided by one mid leg strap which can be wrapped around both legs. === Dynamic traction splint === Dynamic traction splint In 1986, Robert R. Schenck used the same principles applied to treating femur fractures to develop a device for treating intra-articular fractures of the finger. The apparatus consists of a 6-inch-diameter circular splint that provides a rigid arc, with a 3-inch radius equidistant from the involved joint. A wire is placed horizontally through the distal head of the middle phalanx. The wire is attached by rubber band to a movable component attached to the hoop of the splint. The amount of traction can be controlled by using different types of rubber bands or tying knots in them. ==History== The first widely used model of traction splint was introduced by Hugh Owen Thomas, a Welsh surgeon, considered by many to be the father of modern orthopaedic surgery. == References == Category:Medical treatments Category:Medical equipment ","title":"Traction splint"},{"id":"3233639","text":"Commons Daemon, formerly known as JSVC, is a Java software library belonging to the Apache Commons Project. Daemon provides a portable means of starting and stopping a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) that is running server-side applications. Such applications often have additional requirements compared to client-side applications. For example, the servlet container Tomcat 4 would need to serialize sessions and shutdown web applications before the JVM process terminates. Daemon comprises 2 parts: a native library written in C that interfaces with the operating system, and the library that provides the Daemon API, written in Java. There are two ways to use Commons Daemon: by implementing the daemon interface or by calling a class that provides the required methods for daemon. For example, Tomcat-4.1.x uses the daemon interface and Tomcat-5.0.x provides a class whose methods are called by JSVC directly.

His father had four children from his first marriage to Anna Janzen (1828-1863). Johann was married first to Katharina Wieler (26 February 1870, in Nikolaifeld Yazykovo, South Russia ‚Äì 31 August 1909, in Neu Sch√∂nwiese, Chortitza Settlement, South Russia) on 27 September 1891 in Franzfeld, Yazykovo, South Russia. She was the daughter of Abraham Wieler (23 January 1841 ‚Äì 31 January 1907) and Helena (Lepp) Wieler (14 January 1848 ‚Äì 29 May 1911). Johann and Katharina had eight children: Peter, Helena, Aganeta, Abram, Johann, K√§the, Heinrich, and Kornelius. After Katharina's death, Johann married for the second time on 8 May 1911 in Chortitza Chortitza Settlement to Katharina Dyck (d. 21 December 1953, in Winnipeg, Manitoba). Johann and his second wife Katharina had two sons, Victor and Eduard. Johann died in Vancouver, British Columbia on 25 May 1947 and is buried in Winnipeg, Manitoba. After completing the Chortitza Zentralschule, he served as village schoolteacher for five years. He served the Kronsweide Mennonite congregation as preacher from 1904 and as elder from 1907 until his immigration to Canada in 1923, though he lived in Schonwiese. In 1928 he founded the Schonwiese (First Mennonite) church in Winnipeg, serving as its elder until his retirement in 1939. Klassen was a rather prolific writer, chiefly of poems. J. H.

The Musical\\" is the thirteenth episode of the fourth season of the animated television series South Park and the 61st episode of the series overall. \\"Helen Keller! The Musical\\" originally aired in the United States on November 22, 2000 on Comedy Central. In the episode, the boys have to put on a \\"Thanksgiving Extravaganza\\" that is better than the kindergarteners'. ==Plot== The fourth graders are rehearsing for the \\"Thanksgiving Extravaganza\\", where they have to perform The Miracle Worker, which is the story of Helen Keller, starring Timmy as Helen. Butters provides them reports that the kindergarteners' play is the greatest show he has ever seen, and the other kids agree to put extra effort into making their play better. Cartman agrees to adapt the play into a musical, and eventually Jeffrey Maynard, who played the lead in Les Mis√©rables for the Denver Community Playhouse (which is why he is singing his lines), is brought in to help. The kids also decide to replace Helen's pet dog with a turkey, which is also to perform tricks for the audience. Timmy helps to pick out the turkey, and chooses a disabled turkey which he names \\"Gobbles\\". At rehearsal, Maynard brings in a professional performing turkey named Alinicia, and her trainer Lamond declares that she will not perform with Gobbles, and suggests Cartman kill it. Cartman attempts to kill Gobbles with a falling stage-light, but it hits and kills Kenny by mistake. Eventually, Lamond tells Timmy that animal control is going to take Gobbles from him because he is disabled, and Timmy reluctantly lets Gobbles go. When Timmy realizes he has been tricked, he leaves to rescue Gobbles, who has been found by a slaughterhouse and is now being pursued by Jimbo and his hunter friends. In Timmy's absence, Maynard goes on as Helen Keller and surprises everyone by singing ad-libbed songs to express Helen's thoughts, much to Cartman's annoyance. Also after hearing the kindergarteners' play even has pyrotechnics, Cartman rigs laser shows, choreography and water effects into the fourth graders' show, culminating with Alinicia leaping through a ring of fire. Gobbles survives the slaughterhouse due to his limp neck meaning that he is not decapitated along with the healthy turkeys, but is subsequently found by Jimbo and Ned, who shoot him before Timmy arrives just in time to jump in the way of the bullet. Timmy survives, but a guilty Jimbo asks if there is any way he can make it up to Timmy. Timmy, Gobbles, Jimbo, Ned and the rest of their hunter friends, go to the Thanksgiving Extravaganza and shoot Alinicia, killing her to Lamond's horror. While Timmy cheers, Cartman and Kyle arrive, with Cartman announcing that they are ready for Alinicia but then sees the bloody body of her. Cartman curses at the hunters for ruining the finale but Kyle directs everyone's attention to Gobbles. Gobbles goes onstage and jumps through the ring of fire during the grand finale, and the audience, following a stoned Principal Victoria's lead, gives a standing ovation. In the end, the kindergartners' play is finally shown to be just a song to the tune of \\"Old MacDonald Had a Farm\\" about the first Thanksgiving, ending with them setting off a small confetti cannon (Butters viewed this as special effects) which scares one kindergartner into fleeing the stage, and bringing a prop horse on stage. The performance is less than a minute long. The Fourth Graders become disappointed that by listening to Butters, they had \\"worked their asses off for that\\" ('that' being the kindergarteners' play,) and promptly get mad at Butters, because it turns out that, in reality, Butters just liked the play and declared it amazing. ==Cultural references== In the DVD commentary Parker and Stone express how they desired an emotional Timmy story, similar to A Charlie Brown Christmas, although Gobbles was originally a puppy. The scenes of Butters running down the hall is an homage to The Right Stuff. The fake beards and the difficulty in talking in them is based on Parker and Stone's experience making Cannibal! The Musical. Jeffrey Maynard is a parody of Colm Wilkinson, who originated the role of Jean Valjean in the Broadway musical Les Mis√©rables. ==Reception== The episode was selected for inclusion on the DVD release South Park: Timmy!, along with \\"Timmy 2000,\\" \\"4th Grade\\" and \\"The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000.\\" Walt Belcher of The Tampa Tribune highlighted the episode as part of \\"holiday TV shows that'll leave you shouting out with glee.\\" ==References== ==Further reading== * * ==External links== * \\"Helen Keller!

It is a Category A listed building and remains in use as a Church of Scotland parish church. The chancel and half-round apse date from the 12th century with the exterior featuring blind arcades with typical Norman arches. The church was granted by Ness son of William, Lord of Leuchars, to the canons of St Andrews in 1185. Around 1700 a belfry was added, and in 1858 restoration was carried out to the nave. The church is open to the public in summer, at other times by arrangement. Relics preserved inside include part of a 9th- century cross-slab found near the village (closely comparable to the large collection at St Andrews Cathedral), and three elaborate 16th century memorial stones of the Bruces of Earlshall, the local lairds. One of the latter shows a full length figure of a woman, na√Øve in execution, but valuable in documenting contemporary dress. The oft-mentioned dedication of the medieval church of Leuchars to St Athernase is actually an error. It arises from a nineteenth- century misreading of a list of church dedications in the Register of St Andrews Priory, a medieval manuscript now in the National Archives of Scotland. Folio 155v. has a list of churches dedicated, or re-dedicated, by bishop David de Bernham of St Andrews in the 1240s. The eighth church in this list is 'ecclesia sancti Johannis euangeliste et sancti Athernisci confessoris de Losceresch (the church of St John the evangelist and St Athernase the confessor). However the church of Losceresch is not the church of Leuchars, which in medieval sources is spelt Lochris, Locres etc., but the parish church of Lathrisk (now Kettle parish in Fife), whose early spellings are Losresc (1170s), Loseresch, Losseresc (1227) and such like. Athernase is the patron saint not of Leuchars but of Lathrisk. The patron of Leuchars is not known for certain, but some medieval sources indicate a local cult of St Bonoc, a name unknown outside the parish of Leuchars, and a chapel of St Bonoc, complete with chaplain, is known to have existed. \\"Athernase\\" may be an anglicised form of the name Itharn√°n, found also in Fife at Kilrenny, and on the Isle of May, an Irish missionary who \\"died among the Picts\\" in 669 according to the Annals of Ulster. ==See also== *List of Church of Scotland parishes ==References== Category:Religious buildings and structures completed in 1185 Athernase Athernase Category:Romanesque architecture in Scotland Category:Category A listed buildings in Fife Category:Listed churches in Scotland Category:1185 establishments in Scotland Category:Leuchars ","title":"St Athernase Church"},{"id":"3233680","text":"Gastrotheca is a genus of frogs in the family Hemiphractidae. They are found in Central America south of Costa Rica and in South America. Most species occur in the American Cordillera from southern Costa Rica to north-western Argentina. This genus makes up the bulk of marsupial frog diversity; formerly it was placed in the \\"Leptodactylidae\\" assemblage. Marsupial frogs are so- called because they possess a dorsal brood pouch. In some species the eggs are fertilized on the female's lower back, and are inserted in her pouch with the aid of the male's toes. The eggs remain in contact with the female's vascular tissue, which provides them oxygen. Gastrotheca guentheri (Guenther's marsupial frog) is the only known frog with true teeth in its lower jaw. Gastrotheca riobambae (Andean marsupial tree frog) is kept as pet and is used in scientific experiments. ==Species== Gastrotheca cornuta Gastrotheca litonedis There are 74 species recognized in the genus Gastrotheca : * Gastrotheca abdita Duellman, 1987 * Gastrotheca aguaruna Duellman, Barley, and Venegas, 2014 * Gastrotheca albolineata (Lutz and Lutz, 1939) * Gastrotheca andaquiensis Ruiz-Carranza and Hern√°ndez-Camacho, 1976 * Gastrotheca angustifrons (Boulenger, 1898) * Gastrotheca antomia Ruiz-Carranza, Ardila- Robayo, Lynch, and Restrepo-Toro, 1997 * Gastrotheca antoniiochoai (De la Riva and Chaparro, 2005) * Gastrotheca aratia Duellman, Barley, and Venegas, 2014 * Gastrotheca argenteovirens (Boettger, 1892) * Gastrotheca atympana Duellman, Lehr, Rodr√≠guez, and von May, 2004 * Gastrotheca aureomaculata Cochran and Goin, 1970 * Gastrotheca bufona Cochran and Goin, 1970 * Gastrotheca carinaceps Duellman, Trueb, and Lehr, 2006 * Gastrotheca christiani Laurent, 1967 * Gastrotheca chrysosticta Laurent, 1976 * Gastrotheca coeruleomaculatus (Werner, 1899) * Gastrotheca cornuta (Boulenger, 1898) * Gastrotheca cuencana Carvajal-Endara, Coloma, Morales-Mite, Guayasamin, Sz√©kely, and Duellman, 2019 * Gastrotheca dendronastes Duellman, 1983 * Gastrotheca dunni Lutz, 1977 * Gastrotheca dysprosita Duellman, 2013 * Gastrotheca elicioi Carvajal-Endara, Coloma, Morales-Mite, Guayasamin, Sz√©kely, and Duellman, 2019 * Gastrotheca ernestoi Miranda-Ribeiro, 1920 * Gastrotheca espeletia Duellman and Hillis, 1987 * Gastrotheca excubitor Duellman and Fritts, 1972 * Gastrotheca fissipes (Boulenger, 1888) * Gastrotheca flamma Junc√° and Nunes, 2008 * Gastrotheca fulvorufa (Andersson, 1911) * Gastrotheca galeata Trueb and Duellman, 1978 * Gastrotheca gracilis Laurent, 1969 * Gastrotheca griswoldi Shreve, 1941 * Gastrotheca guentheri (Boulenger, 1882) * Gastrotheca helenae Dunn, 1944 * Gastrotheca lateonota Duellman and Trueb, 1988 * Gastrotheca litonedis Duellman and Hillis, 1987 * Gastrotheca lojana Parker, 1932 * Gastrotheca longipes (Boulenger, 1882) * Gastrotheca marsupiata (Dum√©ril and Bibron, 1841) * Gastrotheca megacephala Izecksohn, Carvalho-e-Silva, and Peixoto, 2009 * Gastrotheca microdiscus (Andersson, 1910) * Gastrotheca monticola Barbour and Noble, 1920 * Gastrotheca nebulanastes Duellman, Catenazzi, and Blackburn, 2011 * Gastrotheca nicefori Gaige, 1933 * Gastrotheca ochoai Duellman and Fritts, 1972 * Gastrotheca oresbios Duellman and Venegas, 2016 * Gastrotheca orophylax Duellman and Pyles, 1980 * Gastrotheca ossilaginis Duellman and Venegas, 2005 * Gastrotheca ovifera (Lichtenstein and Weinland, 1854) * Gastrotheca pacchamama Duellman, 1987 * Gastrotheca pachachacae Catenazzi and von May, 2011 * Gastrotheca peruana (Boulenger, 1900) * Gastrotheca phalarosa Duellman and Venegas, 2005 * Gastrotheca phelloderma Lehr and Catenazzi, 2011 * Gastrotheca piperata Duellman and K√∂hler, 2005 * Gastrotheca plumbea (Boulenger, 1882) * Gastrotheca prasina Teixeira, Vechio, Recoder, Carnaval, Strangas, Damasceno, Sena, and Rodrigues, 2012 * Gastrotheca pseustes Duellman and Hillis, 1987 * Gastrotheca psychrophila Duellman, 1974 * Gastrotheca pulchra Caramaschi and Rodrigues, 2007 * Gastrotheca rebeccae Duellman and Trueb, 1988 * Gastrotheca recava Teixeira, Vechio, Recoder, Carnaval, Strangas, Damasceno, Sena, and Rodrigues, 2012 * Gastrotheca riobambae (Fowler, 1913) * Gastrotheca ruizi Duellman and Burrowes, 1986 * Gastrotheca spectabilis Duellman and Venegas, 2016 * Gastrotheca splendens (Schmidt, 1857) * Gastrotheca stictopleura Duellman, Lehr, and Aguilar, 2001 * Gastrotheca testudinea (Jim√©nez de la Espada, 1870) * Gastrotheca trachyceps Duellman, 1987 * Gastrotheca turnerorum Carvajal-Endara, Coloma, Morales-Mite, Guayasamin, Sz√©kely, and Duellman, 2019 * Gastrotheca walkeri Duellman, 1980 * Gastrotheca weinlandii (Steindachner, 1892) * Gastrotheca williamsoni Gaige, 1922 * Gastrotheca yacuri Carvajal-Endara, Coloma, Morales-Mite, Guayasamin, Sz√©kely, and Duellman, 2019 * Gastrotheca zeugocystis Duellman, Lehr, Rodr√≠guez, and von May, 2004 The AmphibiaWeb is listing 69 species as Gastrotheca lojana is not included. ==Footnotes== ==References== * Duellman, W.E., Catenazzi, A. & Blackburn, D.C.

During the years following the conviction, the surviving victim, the co-defendant, the District Attorney, and the jury forewoman have all made public statements that cast doubt on Cantu's guilty verdict. ==Background== Ruben Cantu grew up with his mother and father, until the age of 14, when the couple split up, with Ruben's mother moving 20 miles (32 km) away, and Ruben and his father continuing to live in a trailer in a crime-ridden south San Antonio barrio. The neighborhood was home to a loose band of tough kids called the Grey Eagles, of which Cantu became a leader despite his being rather small and in special-ed classes at school. By age 15, he was stealing cars for an organized auto theft ring, often spending days at a time driving stolen cars to Mexico for cash. At a time when the San Antonio Police Department was embroiled in scandal, with vigilantes and drug-dealing officers well known to the community, Cantu was stealing cars and dodging the police. His older brothers had been arrested on drug and theft charges, but despite several run-ins with the police, Ruben was never convicted of anything before the November 1984 crime that led to his execution. == Convicted of armed robbery and murder == The prosecution's case at the trial that convicted Ruben Cantu is summarized as follows: On the night of November 8, 1984, at approximately 11:30 p.m., Ruben Cantu (age 17 at the time) and his friend David Garza (15), broke into a vacant San Antonio house under construction at 605 Briggs Street, and robbed two Hispanic males at gunpoint. The two victims, Pedro Gomez (25 or 35) and Juan Moreno (19), had been workmen sleeping on floor mattresses at a construction site, guarding against burglary, as a water heater had been recently stolen from the work site. The two victims were sleeping in their work clothes, with their pockets full of their cash earnings at the time of the robbery. Cantu and Garza were carrying a rifle, which they used to rob the two men of their wristwatches. As they tried to take their cash, they were interrupted by Gomez's attempt to retrieve a pistol hidden under his mattress. Gomez was shot at least nine times by the boys' rifle, dying instantly, and Moreno was also shot as many as nine times by the same rifle. Thinking they had killed both men, the two teens then fled the scene. Juan Moreno survived the attack, and was able to leave the house and call for help shortly after the event, though he lost one lung, one kidney, and part of his stomach. Short on leads other than Moreno's description of two Latinos aged roughly 14 and 19, a neighborhood beat officer passed along a rumor from the halls of South San Antonio High School, where Cantu was in ninth grade. A shop teacher reported that three kids had been involved in the robbery and murder and that students were saying Cantu had done the killing. Questioned just before his arrest, Garza identified Cantu, saying he \\"saw Ruben come running out of the house\\" according to a detective's notes. The key trial witness, however, was Juan Moreno, the shooting survivor, who repeatedly identified Ruben Cantu in court. ‚Äì with image of original record available. A decade after Cantu was executed, Moreno recanted his story, as did Garza. == Police revive investigation after Cantu shoots off- duty officer== According to Juan Moreno, and consistent with police records, he was visited by police in the hospital the day after the shooting. But, due to the severity of his wounds, he was unable to speak and could barely move. Five days later, in a second interview, Moreno was shown a number of photos. Cantu's photo was not included and Moreno did not identify any of the people shown in the photos. On December 16, detectives visited Moreno a third time and showed him another array of five photos, including one of Ruben Cantu, who lived across the street from Moreno's job site where the crime occurred. He did not identify Ruben or anyone else from the photos shown to him during that police interview. The case went cold, and no suspect was arrested. About four months after the robbery-murder, Cantu shot Joe De La Luz, an off-duty, plainclothes police officer, at the Scabaroo Lounge, a bar near Cantu's home. According to Cantu, the officer threatened him, revealing his concealed weapon, provoking Cantu (who was also armed) to fire at De La Luz whom he did not know was a police officer. According to De La Luz, he was shot four times by Cantu despite no provocation. ‚Äì Audio interview of Houston Chronicle reporter Lise Olsen. The case against Cantu for the barroom shooting had to be dropped, as police had illegally searched Cantu's home, rendering the case unprosecutable. Officer De La Luz survived the shooting and a friend of his who worked homicide, Sgt. Bill Ewell, decided to immediately reopen the murder investigation against Ruben Cantu. On the following day, Sgt. Ewell sent an investigator to Juan Moreno a fourth time, this time showing Cantu's photo along with four others. Again, Juan Moreno did not identify Cantu as one of his attackers. But he did provide Cantu's name. One day later, a third homicide detective picked up Moreno (an illegal immigrant from Mexico at the time), drove him to the police station, sat him down and showed him the same group of photos that included Cantu. On that third attempt, Moreno positively identified the photo of Cantu as being one of his attackers. Years later Moreno said that the person who shot him had very curly hair and that he was never shown a photo of the real shooter. David Garza, Cantu's codefendant, has since admitted involvement in the burglary, assault and murder. He says he did go inside the house with another boy, did participate in the robbery, and saw the murder take place, but that his accomplice was not Ruben Cantu. According to Garza, the real murderer was an elementary school friend of Cantu. This person, whose only criminal record is a single misdemeanor domestic assault conviction, denied that he had anything to do with the robbery and murder when he was interviewed by the Houston Chronicle in 2005. == Execution == Shortly after being convicted by a jury of first degree murder and sentenced, Cantu wrote a note to the people of San Antonio saying: \\"I have been framed in a capital murder case. I was framed because I shot an off-duty police officer named Joe De La Luz.\\" On August 24, 1993, at 22 minutes after midnight, at the age of 26, Cantu died by lethal injection, becoming the fifth juvenile offender to be executed by Texas. His final request was for a piece of bubble gum, which was denied. Asked if he had a last statement, he said, \\"No, sir.\\" == Recent developments == Sam Millsap, who was the District Attorney presiding over the Cantu case, proclaimed himself a \\"lifelong supporter of the death penalty\\" in his commentary published in the San Antonio Express-News in 2000. In a December 2005 interview with the Express-News, Millsap expressed a newfound opposition to capital punishment. In that 2005 story, Millsap, an attorney in private practice at the time of the interview, says his decision to oppose the death penalty was affirmed, as evidence surfaced that Ruben Cantu was very likely innocent, when prosecuted by Millsap's office, and ultimately executed by the state of Texas. According to the 2005 Express-News story, \\"'It is troubling to me personally. No decision is more frightening than seeking the death penalty. We owe ourselves certainty on it.' He had that degree of certainty in the 1980s when he was the district attorney, 'when I was in my 30s and knew everything.' Now, he says, 'There is no way to have that kind of certainty.'\\" He went on to say that if Cantu was innocent, that means the person who committed the murder remains free and that \\"the misconduct by police officers could be addressed today.\\" Bexar County (San Antonio) District Attorney, Susan Reed, indicated to Rick Casey of the Houston Chronicle that she may bring a \\"murder by perjury\\" charge against Moreno, the surviving victim of the robbery-shooting and key prosecution witness. Juan Moreno is currently a building contractor living in east San Antonio with a teenage child of his own. In 2006 Reed said that she was \\"deeply skeptical\\" of someone who recants testimony they gave twenty years previously but agreed that Cantu should not have been prosecuted as a death penalty case. In 2007 Reed issued a report finding that Ruben Cantu was guilty of the crime for which Texas executed him in 1993. However, critics say the report is compromised by the fact Reed was the judge who rejected Cantu's appeal in 1988 and set his execution date in 1993. with the full report downloadable. Reed assigned to the Cantu case two investigators, Mike Beers and James Moore, who were allegedly recorded ridiculing the case in a phone conversation and openly mocking the notion that Cantu might have been innocent. == See also == * Thompson v.

Between Holmfirth and Greenfield The section between Greenfield and Holmfirth, which passes across Saddleworth Moor, is known locally as the Isle of Skye Road after a public house that was at Wessenden Head until it was demolished in the 1950s after a fire. It passes over treeless high moor top for about 4 miles: Saddleworth Moor west of the county boundary and Wessenden Head Moor to the east. This section of the road is at high altitude and in winter months local snowfall usually results in closures of the road. In January 2010, as a result of the extreme winter, the road was closed for over a month, and other closures also occurred in the same winter. Between Cawthorne and Barugh Green Unlike the other Pennine passes in the area such as the A57 Snake Pass (Manchester to Sheffield), the A62 (Manchester to Huddersfield and Leeds) and the A58 (Rochdale to Halifax and Leeds), the section of the A635 over the Pennines enjoys much quieter traffic since the A628 Woodhead pass is much more direct when travelling between Manchester and Barnsley, connecting directly to the M1 junction 37 and passing through the centre of Barnsley. In 2012, after a recent increase of car incident rates over the moors, a 50mph speed limit was put in place between Greenfield and Holmfirth. In Barugh Green there's a small junction where the B6428 terminates. The road continues through Barnsley to Doncaster where it merges with the A638. The road became infamous because of its connection with the 1960s Moors murders. The grave sites of victims are located, adjacent to the road between Greenfield and Holmfirth, close to an area called Hollin Brown Knoll, which overlooks the 3 reservoirs: Dovestone, Yeoman and Greenfield. A section of the road at the Manchester end had to be closed in August 2015 after it collapsed following unusually torrential rain. ==References== ==External links== *Pathetic Motorways - A635(M) Category:Roads in England Category:Roads in Yorkshire Category:Roads in Greater Manchester Category:Transport in South Yorkshire Category:Transport in West Yorkshire Category:Holme Valley ","title":"A635 road"},{"id":"3233707","text":"A person taking a photo of a located benchmark Benchmarking, also known as benchmark hunting, is a hobby activity in which participants find benchmarks (also known as survey markers or geodetic control points). Technically, the term \\"bench mark\\" is used only to refer to survey markers that designate a certain elevation, but hobbyists often use the term benchmarks to include triangulation stations or reference marks. They typically then log their finds online. Like geocaching, the activity has become popular since about 1995, propelled by the availability of on-line data on the location of survey marks (with directions for finding them) and by the rise of hobbyist-oriented websites. Many survey markers in the U.S. were set over 100 years ago. There was also a surge in creating these marks in the U.S. from about 1930 to 1955, in conjunction with the expansion of map-making activities across the country. In the U.S. some of these marks (triangulation stations and GPS points, loosely also referred to as \\"benchmarks\\") have precise \\"adjusted\\" coordinates (latitude and longitude). The \\"ADJUSTED\\" coordinates are precise to sub- centimeter accuracy, while others, typically true elevation Bench Marks, have only coordinates scaled from a map. \\"SCALED\\" coordinates were read from a topographic map, rather than being surveyed. Many are accurate to 100 feet but some few are as much as 3,000 or 4,000 feet distant from the mark to which they refer, rendering a handheld GPS unit of little use in locating them. Most marks have clear \\"to-reach\\" descriptions, but some lack complete descriptions, or changes in the surrounding buildings, roads, or terrain over decades make the descriptions obsolete. Marks may have been removed by construction or buried. ==Sources of data on U.S. marks== In the U.S., about 740,000 \\"benchmarks\\" with the most precise elevations or coordinates (but only a small fraction of the existing survey marks) are listed in a database maintained by the National Geodetic Survey (NGS) and accessible on-line. The majority of marks set by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the Forest Service, the Corps of Engineers, or cities, and states, and local authorities. Cadastral (land survey) marks are usually not measured for the geodetic data base. The database used by Geocaching.com, the hobbyist website for U.S. benchmark hunters, is only a \\"snapshot\\" of the marks that the NGS had documented by the year 2000, and has not been updated since then. Each NGS-listed mark has a permanent identifier (PID), a six-character code that can be used to call up data about that mark. Using a form for an internet query like this, the PID for the mark can be entered and a data sheet for the mark viewed. A data sheet obtained through such a query looks like this. There is also a website which uses Google Maps to show the locations (and PIDs) of marks in each individual state of the U.S. Specialized hobbyist websites (like Geocaching.com) FAQ and its Benchmark Hunting forum can provide more information. ==Useful tools== In addition to the survey data sheet for a mark being hunted, many hunters bring along a digital camera to take close-up and area pictures of the survey mark (a disk, a cross cut in a rock, an old copper bolt, etc.). These photographs, as well as a current description of the mark by the person who finds (\\"recovers\\") the location of the mark, can then be uploaded to a website as proof of a find. Surveyors use the term \\"recovering\\" as a synonym for \\"finding\\" a mark. This does not mean that the found mark should be disturbed in any way. On the contrary‚Äîdisturbing a survey mark in even a small way often destroys its usefulness to surveyors and others. In the U.S., benchmark hunters often file two different reports on marks they find. One, less formal, is made to the website at Geocaching.com. The other more formal type is made by more experienced and careful hunters to the NGS database itself, and describes the mark's found/not found status, current condition, and updated directions to reach it so that others (particularly surveyors) can more easily re-find the mark. Benchmark hunters also frequently carry a compass (to follow directions gleaned from the data sheet), a probe (like a long-bladed screwdriver) to search for buried marks, a trowel (or a small shovel) to uncover buried marks, a whisk broom (to clear away debris), and one or more tape measures of various lengths, used in taping out referenced distances found on the data sheets. Handheld GPS receivers are often used to get within a few yards probable error of a mark that has adjusted coordinates. Metal detectors are useful for finding marks which have become deeply buried over time. Use of several of the tools in combination is sometimes required, but many marks are set on the surface of sidewalks, buildings, walls, boulders, or monuments and can often be found without special tools. ==Description of markers== USCGS Benchmark Typical Metal Rod or Stake Benchmark Benchmark at Saint Goussaud, Limousin, France, by Institut G√©ographique National Vial Moll de Bosch i Alsina, near Port de Barcelona building, & pedestrian crossing Barcelona Survey markers vary considerably from one country to another. In the U.S they are usually bronze discs about 3.5 inches in diameter. A typical disk is slightly inset into the top of a concrete pillar set vertically with its surface flush with the ground or projecting slightly. Others are metal rods driven into the ground and possibly surrounded by a capped metal or plastic pipe that can be engraved and stamped like disks. Disks can also be set in rock ledges or boulders, and in the concrete of a large structure such as a building, bridge abutment, the base of a tower. In the UK, the mark is usually carved into a wall, or on a metal plate set into a wall. In the U.S., a survey disk is usually engraved with the name of the agency that placed it. The name of the mark (or the \\"station\\" it locates) is usually stamped into its surface, along with the date on which it was set (or re-set, since markers that have been destroyed can be replaced). Disks marked with a triangle are known as \\"triangulation station disks\\", since they mark the position of the primary point used for triangulation (or map-making). Disks marked with an arrow are called reference marks (RMs), since they point (or \\"refer\\") to the principal station that may be located many feet away. A triangulation station often had two or three reference marks. Reference marks were set to enable the primary station to be re-established (or re-set) if needed. Sometimes a survey mark is made much easier to find by the presence nearby of a witness post, a stake (or a small sign) driven into the ground and used to draw attention to (and to warn against disturbing) the mark. Care must be taken to assure that a found disk is the one described on the data sheet, so as to avoid false reports. A reference mark may be mistakenly reported as the station mark. A disk set in 1945 may be confused with a similarly named disk that was set in 1946 by a different agency, and so on. A RESET elevation benchmark should not be reported as the original. Sorting out these differences and reporting them correctly is an important part of the hobby. ==Typical locations== In the U.S., markers are often found at the summits of mountains, along ridge lines, or on bare rock ledges with commanding views, because such sites provided good vantage points for triangulation lines to distant points. U.S. elevation bench marks were often placed along rail lines or roads that provided good sight lines for leveling. All active and some abandoned railroad rights of way are private property, actively patrolled by railroad police. A common location is the top level of the abutment a highway bridge or its wingwalls. As part of triangulation networks, intersection stations were sighted. They are a tall, prominent and well-defined points like a smokestack, the peak of a water tower, or a church spire. However, many of these objects have been altered or replaced by similar nearby structures and no longer mark the original location, so careful identification is required. U.S. bench marks were commonly placed on public buildings, such as court houses, post offices, city halls, and older schools. Benchmarks are often located on private property, or access to them can only be achieved by crossing privately owned land, so permission is needed for access. ===In the UK=== An Ordnance Survey flush bracket in the UK UK benchmarks tend to be on the corners of pubs, churches, and other public buildings, as well as farm buildings, railway bridges, and private houses especially those near a road junction. However, any building may be used, as well as natural features such as a rock outcrop. In the United Kingdom, trigpointing is a recreational activity similar to benchmarking. Searching for trig points is more popular than hunting benchmarks in the UK, but there is a considerable overlap in participation. \\"Trig points\\" is the common name for \\"triangulation pillars\\". These are concrete pillars, about 4 feet tall, which were used by the Ordnance Survey in order to determine the exact shape of the country in a project known as the retriangulation of Great Britain, which was carried out from 1936 to 1962. They are generally located on the highest bit of ground in the area, so that there is a direct line of sight from one to the next. By setting a theodolite on the top of the pillar, accurate bearings to nearby trig points could be taken. This process is called triangulation. There are 6550 such pillars listed in the T:UK database. While most of them have fallen into disuse, about 184 of them are currently used in the Passive Station network. These are maintained so they can be used as accurately located anchor points for differential GPS comparisons, and are re- surveyed every five years to calibrate for any geological movements of the ground. ==See also== * Benchmark (surveying) ==References== ==External links== *Yahoo!

His political mentor was Iuliu Maniu (1873‚Äì1953), the founder of the National Peasant Party, the most important political organization from the interwar period. He studied law and worked as a journalist. ==Biography== ===Early life=== Corneliu Coposu was born in Bobota, SƒÉlaj County, at that time in Austria-Hungary (now in Romania), to the Romanian Greek-Catholic archpriest Valentin Coposu (17 November 1886 ‚Äì 28 July 1941) and his wife Aurelia Coposu (n√©e Anceanu, herself the daughter of Romanian Greek-Catholic archpriest Iuliu Anceanu). Corneliu had four sisters: Cornelia (1911‚Äì1988), Doina (1922‚Äì1990), Flavia BƒÉlescu (b. 1924), and Rodica (b. 1932). He too was a devout member of the church and joined the Romanian National Party (PNR), a group dominated by Greek-Catholic politicians ‚Äì Gheorghe Pop de BƒÉse»ôti was an acquaintance of the Coposu family, and Alexandru Vaida-Voevod was a relative on Corneliu Coposu's mother's side. After studying Law and Economy at the University of Cluj (1930‚Äì1934), he engaged in local politics with the PNR's direct successor, the National Peasants' Party (PN≈¢), and worked as a journalist; he wrote for Rom√¢nia NouƒÉ, edited by Zaharia BoilƒÉ, Mesajul (ZalƒÉu), Unirea (Blaj).Tudor CƒÉlin Zarojanu, Via»õa lui Corneliu Coposu (1996: Editura Ma»ôina de Scris, Bucure»ôti); edi»õia a III-a, revƒÉzutƒÉ »ôi completatƒÉ publicatƒÉ √Æn Cristian Fulger, Tudor CƒÉlin Zarojanu (editori), Seniorul Corneliu Coposu (Bucure»ôti: Humanitas, 2014), Partea a III-a, p. 181; He became the private secretary of Iuliu Maniu, the leader of the PNR and PN≈¢, who had been a leading actor factor in Transylvania's union with Romania (1918), and as head of the Transylvania Directory Council. Coposu wrote in detail about this experience in his ‚Äùsecret diary‚Äù, discovered after the collapse of communism and published in 2014.Corneliu Coposu, File dintr-un jurnal interzis. 1936-1947, 1953, 1967-1983, edi»õie √ÆngrijitƒÉ de Doina Alexandru (Bucure»ôti: Editura Vremea, 2014). ===World War II=== Accused of propaganda against the National Rebirth Front (Frontul Rena»ôterii Na»õionale), Coposu was sent into forced domicile in Bobota. After the Second Vienna Diktat, known also as the Second Vienna Award (‚ÄùDictatul de la Viena‚Äù) of August 1940, when Romania was forced to cede North-Western Transylvania to Hungary, Coposu moved to Bucharest. He became the political secretary of Maniu, the leader of the clandestine opposition to Marshal Ion Antonescu, and the leader of the anti- Nazi resistance in Romania.Zarojanu, 184. Maniu was contacted by representatives of the British authorities, and Coposu was one of his trusted assistants; the group maintained contacts between the Romanian politicians who were negotiating the country's exit from the alliance with the Axis Powers, in order to join the anti-Nazi Alliance (USA, UK, USSR) (an alternative kept by the Antonescu government). In his ‚Äùsecret diary‚Äù, Coposu explained the role of Iuliu Maniu as the main organizer of the coup d'√©tat against Antonescu.Coposu, File dintr-un jurnal interzis, 163-424. In 1945, after the royal coup against the Antonescu regime, Coposu became deputy secretary of the PN≈¢ and, after the reintegration of Northern Transylvania, the party's delegate to the leadership of provisional administrative bodies. He was also active in organizing the party as the main opposition to the Communist Party and the Petru Groza cabinet before the 1946 general election.Roman jr. ===Communist persecution=== The communist regime established and controlled by the Soviets, arrested him on 14 July 1947, together with all the leadership of the National Peasants' Party, after some of the party leadership had allegedly tried to flee the country in a plane landed at TƒÉmƒÉdƒÉu (see TƒÉmƒÉdƒÉu Affair). His mentor, Iuliu Maniu, the leader NPP, the most important political organization in Romania, received a life sentence in a show trial. Maniu died in 1953, in the infamous Sighet Prison, but his death certificate was released only eight years later. Coposu was imprisoned without trial for nine years, as all charges brought against him were dismissed due to lack of evidence. Coposu later attested that his imprisonment, imposed by Soviet officials overseeing the Securitate, was among those causing a stir in the higher echelons of the Communist Party. Belu Zilber, a Communist who was purged together with Lucre≈£iu PƒÉtrƒÉ≈ücanu, later told him that prominent party politician Ana Pauker had unsuccessfully opposed the move in front of Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej.Levy, p.284 In 1956, Coposu was sentenced to life imprisonment for \\"betrayal of the working class\\" and \\"crime against social reforms\\". In April 1964, he was freed after 15 years of detention and 2 years of forced residence in Rubla (BrƒÉila County), having spent, in all, 17 years of incarceration in 17 notorious detention and hard labor facilities associated with the communist regime,\\"Distrugerea ≈£ƒÉrƒÉnimii\\" including Sighet Prison, Gherla Prison, Jilava, R√¢mnicu SƒÉrat Prison, Pite»ôti Prison, and the Danube‚ÄìBlack Sea Canal (where he was imprisoned with his friend and collaborator »òerban Ghica).\\"Distrugerea »õƒÉrƒÉnimii\\"; Roman jr. Coposu later testified having been impressed by the deep scars collectivization had left in the country,\\"Distrugerea »õƒÉrƒÉnimii\\" as well as by the resilience of the Rubla deportees (see BƒÉrƒÉgan deportations) ‚Äî \\"They traded in vegetables they had grown themselves while locals could not be convinced that these could actually grow on the BƒÉrƒÉgan\\".Coposu, in \\"Distrugerea »õƒÉrƒÉnimii\\" In the 1990s, during debates over the overall number of victims of the Communist regime between 1947 and 1964, Coposu spoke of 282,000 arrests and 190,000 deaths in custody.Cioroianu, p.313 After his release, Coposu started work as an unskilled worker on various construction sites (given his status as a former prisoner, he was denied employment in any other field), and was subject to Securitate surveillance and regular interrogation.Deletant, Preface, p.xxvii-xxix After the collapse of communism, Tudor CƒÉlin Zarojanu published large excerpts from the huge Securitate file on Corneliu Coposu, kept for decades by the secret communist political police Zarojanu, Via»õa. His wife Arlette was also prosecuted in 1950 during a rigged espionage trial, and died in 1965, soon after her release, from an illness contracted in prison. Coposu managed to keep contact with PN≈¢ sympathisers, and re-established the party as a clandestine group during the 1980s, while imposing its affiliation to Christian Democracy and the Christian Democrat International.Prelipceanu, p.31-32 ===Post-communism=== On 22 December 1989, (during the Romanian Revolution), he and prominent members of the party issued a manifesto that confirmed the PN≈¢'s entry into legality, under the name Christian Democratic National Peasants' Party. For the rest of his life, Coposu was the main voice of the opposition to the National Salvation Front (from 1992, the Democratic National Salvation Front).TismƒÉneanu, p.270, 279, 281 Present at his party's headquarters, he was targeted by the first Mineriad on 28 January, 1990. The Prime Minister Petre Roman addressed the angry mob who wanted to lynch Coposu and the other leaders of the democratic opposition, pretending to mediate the conflict. In an attempt to create a resemblance between how the dictator Ceau»ôescu exited the armored vehicle before his trial and Coposu's flight, under the pretext of protecting Coposu from the angry crowd, Roman commissioned an armored vehicle to drive him to the headquarters of the Romanian National Television where Roman promised Coposu that he could make a statement which would be aired later that day.Gheorghe & Huminic The statement was recorded but it did not air. No copy of the recording was ever found in the archives. Coposu successfully grouped various organizations into the Romanian Democratic Convention (CDR), of which he was the leader between 1991 and 1993.TismƒÉneanu, p.270 He was elected to the Senate of Romania in the 1992 general election. In 1995, the government of France granted him the Grand Officier de la L√©gion d'Honneur during a ceremony in Bucharest. Regarding Emil Constantinescu's election as the CDR's candidate for the presidential office in 1992, Coposu stated: \\"The candidate was elected in an absolutely democratic manner. The appointment of the candidate of the Democratic Convention for the position of president of the country was made according to the most authentic democratic rules. All five candidates had the moral stature and prestige to honor the highest magistracy of the country. We, the Democratic Convention, wish the only candidate, elected by the vote of the 67 major presidential electors, to succeed in the elections and to achieve his first goal, which is the eradication of communism in Romania.\\"TismƒÉneanu, p.270 == Death == Bellu Catholic Cemetery He died in Bucharest while undergoing treatment for lung cancer. Some 100,000 people attended his funeral three days later.OMRI Daily Digest , No. 223, 15 November 1995 He was buried in the Catholic section of Bellu cemetery. One of the main thoroughfares in the capital now bears his name. A bust of Coposu now stands next to Kretzulescu Church, in Revolution Square. In a 2006 poll conducted by Romanian Television to identify the \\"greatest Romanians of all time\\", Coposu came in 39th. ==Notes== ==References== * \\"Distrugerea ≈£ƒÉrƒÉnimii\\" (\\"The Destruction of the Peasant Class\\"), in Jurnalul Na≈£ional *Adrian Cioroianu, Pe umerii lui Marx.

Gilot was already launched as an accomplished artist, notably in watercolours and ceramics, but her professional career was eclipsed by her social celebrity, and when she split from Picasso, he discouraged galleries from buying her work, as well as unsuccessfully trying to block her memoirs, Life with Picasso. == Early life == Gilot was born in Neuilly-sur-Seine, France, to √âmile Gilot and Madeleine Gilot (n√©e Renoult). Her father was a businessman and agronomist, and her mother was a watercolor artist. Her father was a strict, well-educated man. Gilot began writing with her left hand as a young child, but at the age of four, her father forced her to write with her right hand. As a result, Gilot became ambidextrous. She decided at the age of five to become a painter. The following year her mother tutored her in art, beginning with watercolors and India ink. Gilot was then taught by her mother's art teacher, a Mademoiselle Meuge, for six years. She studied English literature at Cambridge University and the British Institute in Paris (now University of London Institute in Paris). While training to be a lawyer, Gilot was known to skip morning law classes to pursue her true passion: art. She graduated from the Sorbonne with a B.A. in Philosophy in 1938 and from Cambridge University with a degree in English in 1939. Gilot had her first exhibition of paintings in Paris in 1943. ==School== Gilot's father Emile wanted his daughter to be just as educated as he, and as a result, oversaw his daughter's education very closely. Gilot was tutored at home, beginning at a young age, and by the time she was six years old, she had a good knowledge of Greek mythology. By the age of fourteen, she was reading books by Edgar Allan Poe, Charles Baudelaire, and Alfred Jarry.Gilot, Fran√ßoise, Monograph 1940-2000. Lausanne: Sylvio Acatos, 2000. While her father had hoped she would go to school to become a scientist or lawyer, Gilot was frequenting museums in Europe to understand and gain an appreciation for the masters. When Gilot was seventeen, she attended the Sorbonne and the British Institute in Paris and had a baccalaureate degree in Philosophy.\\"Fran√ßoise Gilot: Artist of the World.\\" WIC Biography. . She received her English Literature degree from Cambridge University. During 1939, Gilot's father still wanted her to complete a degree in international law, and out of fear that Paris would be bombed during the war, Gilot was sent to Rennes, France, to begin law school. At the age of 19, she abandoned her studies in law to devote her life to art. She was mentored by the artist Endre Rozsda.Gilot, Francoise and Kunstsammlungen Chemnitz. Francoise Gilot: Painting ‚Äì Malerei. Germany: Kerber Verlag, 2003. In 1942, after abandoning law several times, and returning on the insistence of her father, Gilot studied law for a second year and passed her written exams, but failed her oral exams.Gilot, Fran√ßoise. \\"The F. Gilot Archives.\\" Fran√ßoise Gilot. . ==Picasso== At 21, Gilot met Pablo Picasso, then 61. Picasso first saw Gilot in a restaurant in the spring of 1943. His mistress, Dora Maar, was devastated to learn that Picasso was replacing her with the much younger artist. After Picasso's and Gilot's meeting, she moved in with him in 1946. They spent almost ten years together, and those years revolved around art. He painted La femme-fleur, then his old friend Matisse, who liked Gilot, announced that he would create a portrait of her, in which her body would be pale blue and her hair leaf green.Hawley, Janet, 2011. \\"Pablo was the greatest love of my life ... I left before I was destroyed\\", Good Weekend, Sydney Morning Herald, 23 July, pp. 14. It was believed by some art historians that Gilot's relationship with Picasso is what cut short her artistic career. When Gilot left Picasso, he told all art dealers he knew not to purchase her art, whereas Gilot herself has noted that continuing to identify her in relation to Picasso \\"does her a great disservice as an artist.\\" Picasso and Gilot never married, but they did have two children together because he promised to love and care for them.Hawley, Janet, 2011. \\"Pablo was the greatest love of my life ... I left before I was destroyed\\", Good Weekend, Sydney Morning Herald, 23 July, pp. 15. Their son, Claude, was born in 1947, and their daughter, Paloma, was born in 1949. During their ten years together, Gilot was often harassed on the streets of Paris by Picasso's legal wife, Olga Khokhlova, a former Russian ballet dancer, and Picasso himself physically abused her as well.Museu Picasso BarcelonaSurviving Picasso. DVD. Directed by James Ivory. Culver City, CA: Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc., 1996. In 1964, eleven years after their separation, Gilot wrote Life with Picasso (with the art critic Carlton Lake),Michael Kimmelman (April 28, 1996), Picasso's Family Album New York Times. a book that sold over one million copies in dozens of languages, despite an unsuccessful legal challenge from Picasso attempting to stop its publication. From then on, Picasso refused to see Claude or Paloma ever again. All the profits from the book were used to help Claude and Paloma mount a case to become Picasso's legal heirs.Hawley, Janet, 2011. \\"Pablo was the greatest love of my life ... I left before I was destroyed\\", Good Weekend, Sydney Morning Herald, 23 July, pp. 19. ==Gilot's work== Fran√ßoise Gilot was introduced to art at a young age by her mother and grandmother. Her grandmother had held a party when Fran√ßoise was about five years old. A certain man caught Gilot's eye as being interesting, and she asked her grandmother who the man was. He turned out to be a painter, Emile Mairet.Gilot, Fran√ßoise. \\"The F. Gilot Archives.\\" Fran√ßoise Gilot. Gilot's father became close friends with the painter, and Fran√ßoise would often tag along to visit his studio. At age six, Fran√ßoise's mother began teaching her art, with the exception of drawing. Her mother believed artists become too dependent on erasers, and instead taught Fran√ßoise in watercolor and India ink. If she made a mistake, she would have to make it intentional to her work. By the age of thirteen, she began to study with Mlle. Meuge, which continued for six years. At the age of fourteen, she was introduced to ceramics, and a year later, she studied with the Post-Impressionist painter Jacques Beurdeley. At the age of 21, she met Picasso. Although Picasso had influenced Fran√ßoise Gilot's work as a cubist painter, she developed her own style. She avoided the sharp edges and angular forms that Picasso sometimes used. Instead, she used organic figures. During the war, Gilot's father attempted to save the most valuable household belongings by moving them, but the truck was bombed by the Germans, leading to the loss of Gilot's drawings and watercolors. ==Personal life== From 1943 to 1953, Gilot was the lover and artistic muse of Pablo Picasso, with whom she had two children, Claude and Paloma. Gilot married artist Luc Simon in 1955. Their daughter Aur√©lia was born the following year. The couple divorced in 1962. In 1969, Gilot was introduced to American polio vaccine pioneer Jonas Salk at the home of mutual friends in La Jolla, California. Their shared appreciation of architecture led to a brief courtship and a 1970 wedding in Paris. During their marriage, which lasted until Salk's death in 1995, the couple lived apart for half of every year as Gilot continued to paint in New York City, La Jolla, and Paris. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, she designed costumes, stage sets, and masks for productions at the Guggenheim in New York City. She was awarded a Chevalier de la L√©gion d‚ÄôHonneur in 1990.

She was a Norwegian American novelist\\"So THIS is the novel!\\". The Globe and Mail, Aritha van Herk October 2, 2009 and screenwriter. ==Early life and education== Martha Ostenso was born in Haukeland (now part of Bergen), in Hordaland County, Norway. Her parents were Sigurd and Olina (n√©e Tungeland) Ostenso. She emigrated with her family. She first settled in the province of Manitoba, Canada, before moving to South Dakota and Minnesota.Janet Galligani Casey. A New Heartland: Women, Modernity, and the Agrarian Ideal in America. Oxford University Press; 23 March 2009. . p. 105‚Äì. Ostenso taught in a rural school and attended the University of Manitoba for approximately one year; she never graduated.Encyclopedia of Literature in Canada. Edited by W. H. New . Toronto: University of Toronto Press. p.854-55. While studying at the University of Manitoba, she was a student of Douglas Durkin, a professor in the English Department. Shortly thereafter Durkin left his wife and children and moved to New York City; Ostenso joined him there. They lived together in New York, where she studied at Columbia University. ==Career== Martha Ostenso worked as a social worker in New York; she and Durkin were active in the literary circles of the time. Ostenso's best-known novel, Wild Geese, was published in 1925. A book, about a young schoolteacher sent to teach in rural Manitoba, was hailed by critics as a landmark in Canadian realism; it won the 1925 Dodd, Mead and Company Best Novel of the Year Award.\\"The Sensations of the 1920s: Martha Ostenso's Wild Geese and Mazo de la Roche's Jalna\\". SCL, Volume 28, Number 2 (2003) Faye Hammill It made her a well-known and best- selling author.Buckley, Joan N. \\"Martha Ostenso: Norwegian-American Immigrant Novelist\\" (NAHA. Volume 28: Page 69)Social Progress. Vol. 10-11. Howard- Severance Company; 1926. p. 335. A film version of Wild Geese was made in 1927. Ostenso and Durking later moved to Minnesota. Many of her novels were based on Minnesota farm life; most incorporate elements of romance and melodrama. Ostenso portrays the lives of rural immigrants with dignity. Although none of her later novels ever reached the acclaim Wild Geese attracted, most continued to explore a similar theme: the relationship between men and women and the land they work. A number of her other works were translated and have been reprinted several times. In 1931, Ostenso acquired American citizenship.\\"Martha Ostenso, Literary History, and the Scandinavian Diaspora\\", Canadian literature, by Faye Hammill, Spring 2008, p. 19 She continued to publish short stories, novels and wrote a number of screenplays. Although it is now known that Ostenso collaborated with Durkin, all their writing appeared under her name alone. She produced fifteen more novels, the most successful of which was O River, Remember, a novel about a family in the Red River Valley of Minnesota which won a Literary Guild selection in 1943. Asked how to pronounce her name, she told The Literary Digest, \\"Of the three syllables in Ostenso, the first receives the major accent, the second is without accent, the third receives a minor accent. The final result is as if you spoke the name Austin and added so as an afterthought.\\"Charles Earle Funk, What's the Name, Please?, Funk & Wagnalls, 1936 After Durkin's wife died, he and Ostenso married in 1945. Martha Ostenso and Durkin lived for a time in Hollywood, California, where they had friends among the movie stars of the 1930s and 40s. Ostenso's novel Wild Geese was filmed as The Cry of the Wild Geese in 1961 as a West-German and Austrian co-production and later as After the Harvest in 2001 as a made-for-television movie for Canadian TV starring Sam Shepard. ==Death== The film industry lifestyle impacted Ostenso's and Durkin's health, as well as their productivity and the quality of their work. In 1963, the couple moved to Seattle, Washington, to be near Durkin's sons. Shortly after the move, Ostenso died from cirrhosis of the liver, the result of years of heavy drinking. ==Selected bibliography== *A Far Land, Ostenso's only book of poetry.

The greatest threat to a given focus of attention is competition from other stimuli that can cause a shift in focus. This is because one maintains focus on a particular thought by inhibiting all potential distractions and not by strengthening that central mental activity. Directed attention fatigue occurs when a particular part of the brain's global inhibitory system is overworked due to the suppression of increasing numbers of stimuli. This temporary condition is not a clinical illness or a personality disorder. It is rather a temporary fatigue of the inhibitory mechanisms in the brain. According to inhibition theory, it is natural for one to alternate between periods of attention and distraction. Although one's efforts may involve very different tasks, each incoming stimulus calls upon the same directed attention mechanism. ==Symptoms== Extreme levels of mental fatigue lead to an inability to perform regular tasks and irritability. Studies that require participants to carry out attention-demanding tasks under conditions of high distraction reveal how unpleasant a mentally fatigued person can be. After exposure to such an experience, individuals are less likely to help someone in need. They are also more aggressive, less tolerant, and less sensitive to socially important cues. Fatigue that is experienced by participants of these kinds of studies is induced by attention-intensive tasks, and the observed effects of such fatigue are correlated with decline in inhibitory control. Signs of Directed Attention Fatigue include temporarily feeling unusually distractible, impatient, forgetful, or cranky when there is no associated illness. In more severe forms, it can lead to bad judgment, apathy, or accidents, and can contribute to increased stress levels. There are 6 major areas of mental processing that are affected during onset of DAF, which are as follows: # Input ‚Äî One may experience misperception and miss social cues. # Thinking ‚Äî One may experience feelings of restlessness, confusion, forgetfulness and/or decreased metacognition. # Behavior ‚Äî One may experience feelings of impulsiveness and recklessness, and may find that they have a diminished level of threshold between thoughts and actions. One may also act out-of-character. # Executive Functioning ‚Äî One may experience an inability to plan and make appropriate decisions and may experience impaired judgment ability. # Emotions ‚Äî One may experience being short-tempered and feelings of unpleasantness. # Social Interactions ‚Äî One may experience heightened irritability and increased frequency of antisocial feelings. Overlap of symptoms from the six above categories is highly indicative of Directed Attention Fatigue. ===Link to ADHD=== The symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder closely mirror the symptoms of Directed Attention Fatigue. Like Directed Attention Fatigue, ADHD involves the prefrontal cortex. Specifically, the right prefrontal cortex is less active among children with ADHD. Experimentation has shown that the severity of ADHD symptoms can be correlated to the degree of asymmetry between blood flow in the left and right prefrontal cortex. It is possible that DAF and ADHD involve disruption of the same underlying mechanism, and recent clinical evidence has found that the same treatments used for Directed Attention Fatigue may reduce the symptoms of ADHD in children. However, it is important to note that unlike ADHD, DAF is a temporary condition rather than a clinical disorder. ==Cause== The onset of directed attention fatigue can be triggered by a number of activities, all of which involve use of the brain's inhibitory system. Activities that engage this system include multitasking, working in an environment with disruptive background noise or after a lack of sleep, and rapidly changing focus during a prolonged period of attention. DAF can also be brought about by performing concentration-intensive tasks such as puzzle-solving or learning unfamiliar ideas. External factors such as stress resulting from emergencies, exams or work deadlines can also induce DAF. Any illness or injury to the brain that interrupts the brain circuits involved in maintaining attention and inhibiting external stimuli may also contribute to the development of directed attention fatigue. ==Anatomy== Directed attention, or voluntary attention, requires a great deal of concentration and focus, and is employed in tasks such as problem solving. This type of attention employs the inhibitory mechanisms of the brain, which help block incoming stimuli that are unrelated to the task at hand. Several parts of the brain are involved in maintaining directed attention, primarily those located in the frontal lobe and the parietal lobe of the brain. Specifically, the mechanism of directed attention employs the prefrontal cortex (PFC), the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the brain stem's basal ganglia. Some fMRI studies have shown that directed attention involves changes in the anterior cingulate cortex and the lateral prefrontal cortex, perhaps as a consequence of increased connectivity between these two areas. Evidence also suggests that the right inferior frontal cortex (IFC) plays a specialized role in response inhibition. It seems that this region plays a key role in the integration of bottom-up response-related information and facilitates goal-directed behavior. While these areas of the brain are known to be involved in DAF, their specific molecular mechanisms in the perpetuation of DAF symptoms are not yet known. ==Diagnosis== ===Differential diagnosis=== The concept of stress is used in many situations that would be described as mental fatigue, but the two concepts are distinctly different. Stress involves preparation for an anticipated event that has been evaluated as being threatening or harmful. Though mental fatigue may well result from stressful circumstances, it also arises out of hard work on a project one enjoys. In such cases, there is no anticipation of threat or harm present but still the result is fatigue. Characteristic of mental fatigue is difficulty focusing. For a mentally fatigued person, paying attention to something uninteresting is burdensome, even though focusing on something of great interest poses no particular challenge. Hence, there are two types of attention, distinguished in terms of the effort involved in their use and their changes in attentional shift: :# Involuntary attention refers to attention that requires no effort at all, as when something exciting or interesting happens. :# Voluntary attention, or directed attention, refers to attention that requires a great deal of effort, as when something is monotonous or boring. ==Treatment== There are measures that can be taken in order to reduce the impact of DAF. These include reducing the number of distractions present in one's external environment, trying to clear one's mind of any internal distractions and taking short breaks during prolonged periods of focus. Directed attention fatigue can be reduced by getting a sufficient amount of sleep each night because during sleep, inhibitory attention chemicals are replenished. An aesthetic environment may also serve a restorative function in fostering recovery from mental fatigue. Research has shown that restorative experiences, such as clearing one's head and reflecting on one's life and priorities, may help combat Directed Attention Fatigue. As investigated by attention restoration theory, natural environments, such as forests, mountain landscapes or beaches, appear to be particularly effective for restoring attention, perhaps because they contain a vast amount of diverse, relatively weak stimuli, thus inciting the mind to wander freely while relaxing its strict focus. ==Research== Ongoing research is examining ways in which the incidence of DAF can be decreased, and suggests that exposure to the natural environment may aid in the reduction of DAF symptoms. A number of researchers have investigated Directed Attention Fatigue recently. Leading contributors include Rachel and Stephen Kaplan, environmental psychologists at the University of Michigan. Rachel and Stephen Kaplan are credited with much of the research relating to Directed Attention Fatigue and were the first to discover that extended periods of focused attention can lead to DAF. Their research suggests that Directed Attention Fatigue can be alleviated with exposure to nature. Together, the Kaplans devised the Attention restoration theory (ART), which states that a person is better able to maintain focused directed attention after spending time in the natural environment. A number of studies have been performed that specifically focus on Directed Attention Fatigue experienced by cancer patients. Such studies suggests that the DAF experienced by cancer patients following surgery improves significantly through outdoor restorative activities for 20 minutes per day. Similarly, it has been discovered that even brief amounts of time spent on a busy metropolitan street can affect one's ability to maintain focus on a given task. Experimental findings suggest that spending time in a natural environment or even looking at pictures of nature can improve maintenance of directed attention. The Landscape and Human Health Laboratory (LHHL) has completed studies examining the complex relationship between people and their environment. Researchers here discovered the correlation between Directed Attention Fatigue, irritability and aggression. Their findings suggest that people deprived of the restorative effects of nature display more aggressive qualities. Results also demonstrate that communities with several trees and other natural areas tend to be stronger, safer and house residents with a higher attention level. More recent experimentation done at the LHHL suggests that children possessing attention deficits increase their attention level after walking outdoors. According to this and much other research that has been performed regarding directed attention fatigue, the brain's ability to maintain directed attention is heightened after exposure to nature. ==See also== *Attention *Attention span *Environmental psychology *Ego depletion *Human multitasking ==References== Category:Neuropsychology Category:Neurological disorders Category:Symptoms and signs: Cognition, perception, emotional state and behaviour ","title":"Directed attention fatigue"},{"id":"3233766","text":"Lu√≠s Carlos Nunes da Silva, nicknamed Carlinhos (19 November 1937 ‚Äì 22 June 2015), played for Flamengo between 1958 and 1969. Because of his elegant football and his thin voice, he was known as \\"The Violin\\". In Flamengo, he won the 1961 Torneio Rio-S√£o Paulo and twice the Rio State Championship (1963 and 1965). Carlinhos was capped for the Brazilian national team several times in the 1960s. He was one of the few players to receive the Belfort Duarte Trophy (\\"fair play award\\") from the Brazilian Football Confederation (CBF). The award is given to the players who have never received a red card. His career as a manager started in 1983, when he coached Flamengo for five matches. Four years later, he was back at Flamengo when former coach Ant√¥nio Lopes was fired for the bad results in the 1987 Rio State Championship finals. At that time, Flamengo's squad had Brazilian star Renato Ga√∫cho, veteran players (such as Zico, Leandro, Andrade, Nunes and Edinho), and young ones, that had just came from the youth squad. Zico, the main star of the club, still recovering from several knee surgeries, wasn't at his top form. Carlinhos, with a little luck and much knowledge of the ways of the football, mixed veterans and newcomers to create a very competitive team, that won the 1987 Copa Uni√£o. Five World Champions in the 1994 World Cup played for that team: Bebeto, Zinho, Aldair, Jorginho and Leonardo. Carlinhos returned in 1991, in similar conditions. His squad had J√∫nior, near retirement, Zinho and many newbies (among them Djalminha and Marcelinho). After winning 1991 Rio State Championship, he won the fifth Brazilian National Championship for Flamengo in the 1992 finals against Botafogo (3-0, 2-2). He won another important title for Flamengo in 1999, the Mercosur Cup. As professional he disputed 880 matches: 517 as player and 313 as coach. On 12 February 2011, he was honored for Flamengo, with the unveiling of a bust and a square at the headquarters of the Club.

Kreisel was born in Vienna, Austria to a Polish-born mother and a Romanian-born father.source The family, which was Jewish, managed to reach Britain just before the Second World War, but, like many other German- speaking refugees, they were declared enemy aliens after the war began. In 1940 Kreisel was relocated to Canada. He lived on a farm in New Brunswick until 1941. It was there that he began his career as a writer, deciding to write in English and modelling himself on the bilingual author Joseph Conrad. After Canada decided to release the refugees from the camps they had been assigned to, Kreisel decided to pursue his dream of writing and was educated at the University of Toronto. He than denied any connection with or use of the German language, being the language of his persecutors.Annette Puckhaber: Ein Privileg f√ºr wenige. Die deutschsprachige Migration nach Kanada im Schatten des Nationalsozialismus. Lit, M√ºnster 2002 , p. 253, ref. 1042. In German Kreisel became one of the first Jewish writers to write about Jewish-Canadian issues. Later he spent time in Western Canada, and his essay \\"The Prairie: A State of Mind\\" is a frequently anthologized discussion of Western Canadian regionalism. He was made an Officer of the Order of Canada in 1987. In order to honour him, the \\"Canadian Literature Centre\\" in Edmonton organizes an annual \\"Henry Kreisel Memorial Lecture\\".

The coalition formed in 1992 and each year it organizes a yearly conference at which representatives from graduate employee unions come together to teach and learn from each other about organizing, negotiating contracts, tactics, and mobilization of members. In past conferences, the delegates spent part of one of the days on the picket line in solidarity with a group of striking workers in the city hosting the conference, but this has not occurred in recent years. In the period between conferences CGEU provides a forum for graduate employee unions to share information with each other, and maintains a website with information about graduate employee organizing. The coalition is made up of locals from many different international unions, such as: the American Federation of Teachers, the United Auto Workers, the Communication Workers of America, UNITE HERE, United Electrical Workers, National Education Association, American Association of University Professors, the Service Employees International Union and the Canadian Union of Public Employees, as well as some number of independent unions. ==Conferences== The 16th annual CGEU conference took place in the summer of 2007 in Amherst, Massachusetts and was hosted by GEO/UAW. The 21st annual CGEU conference took place in the summer of 2012 in Vancouver, BC and was hosted by CUPE 2278 and the Teaching Support Staff Union. The 22nd annual CGEU conference took place in the summer of 2013 in Iowa City, IA and was hosted by COGS.

Her first appearance at global level came at the 1991 IAAF World Indoor Championships, where she finished fifth in the long jump. She demonstrated further skills when she scored a double gold in the long jump and triple jump events at both the 1993 Central American and Caribbean Championships in Athletics and the 1993 Central American and Caribbean Games. That year she went on to become the Summer Universiade champion in the triple jump and just missed out on the medals with a fourth- place finish at the 1993 World Championships in Athletics.

Phelan (born January 20, 1963) is a former college football player who played wide receiver for Boston College. ==Career== ===Early years=== Phelan played high school football for Archbishop John Carroll High School in Radnor, Pennsylvania and graduated in 1981. ===College football=== Phelan continued his football career at Boston College, where he played from 1981 to 1984 as a wide receiver. Phelan is best remembered for his game-winning catch in the coined Hail Flutie game on November 23, 1984, in which the Boston College Eagles faced off against the University of Miami Hurricanes in the Orange Bowl in Miami. The game is often ranked among the greatest college football games of all time, where Phelan caught eleven of quarterback Doug Flutie's forty-six pass attempts for a total of 226 receiving yards and two touchdowns. Most notably, Phelan caught the 48-yard game-winning Hail Mary touchdown that cemented him in Boston College lore. With possession on Miami's 48-yard line, the Eagles trailed the Hurricanes 45-41 with just six seconds left. A desperation play known as \\"55 Flood Tip\\" was signaled, which called for the receivers to run toward the end zone and attempt to tip a jump ball to an open receiver. Miami's defensive backs stopped before the goal line, most likely because they did not believe Flutie could throw the ball farther than that, which allowed Phelan to get behind them. As the game clock expired, Flutie eluded a Miami pass rusher, scrambled to his right to his own 37-yard line, and launched the ball. It traveled an impressive 63 yards, over the Miami defenders, and into the arms of an untouched Phelan in the end zone. The catch gave Boston College a 47-45 victory. To this day, it is considered one of the greatest offensive plays in college football history. ===Professional career=== Phelan was drafted by the New England Patriots in the fourth round (108th overall pick) in the 1985 NFL Draft. A knee injury prematurely cut short his professional career. ==Personal life== A graduate of the Boston College class of 1985, Phelan currently works in Boston for RR Donnelley as Senior Vice President.http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/person.asp?personId=79224764&privcapId;=4165134&previousCapId;=4165134&previousTitle;=High%20Street%20Partners,%20Inc.

The band's current line-up consists of vocalist Matt Caughthran, guitarists Joby J. Ford and Ken Horne, bass guitarist Brad Magers, and drummer Joey Castillo. The band have released five studio albums, as well as three additional albums of mariachi music under the moniker of Mariachi El Bronx. ==History== The initial lineup of The Bronx consisted of Caughthran, Ford, bassist James Tweedy, and drummer Jorma Vik. At their first performance they impressed Jonathan Daniel, manager of American Hi-Fi, who became their manager; and as early as their second show had attracted the attention of A&R; representatives from major record labels. After only twelve live performances the band signed a contract with the Island Def Jam Music Group. However, feeling as though they were not yet ready to record for a major label, the band opted to form their own label, White Drugs, to put out their first few releases. They recorded a demo entitled Sure Death in 2002, followed by their first single \\"Bats!\\" in 2003. Their debut album The Bronx was released in August 2003. It was produced by Gilby Clarke (Guns N' Roses) and recorded in his kitchen. This was followed by an EP, La Muerte Viva, that November. To support the album, singles and music videos were released for the songs \\"They Will Kill Us All (Without Mercy)\\" and \\"False Alarm\\". The band toured the United States and Australia in support of the album. In Australia, the band's performance at the Annandale Hotel in Sydney was filmed, later released as the DVD Live at the Annandale. The Bronx's major-label debut was The Bronx (2006), a second eponymous album that was supported by singles and music videos for \\"History's Stranglers\\", \\"White Guilt\\" and \\"Shitty Future\\". Ken Horne of The Dragons played some guitar parts on the album, and soon joined the band as second guitarist. In April 2007, the band announced that they would record two new albums. The Bronx was planned as a punk rock album, while Mariachi El Bronx would be a mariachi album. They entered a recording studio in March 2008 to begin work on both albums, with Brad Magers (formerly of Christiansen and Your Highness Electric) replacing Tweedy on bass guitar, and Vincent Hidalgo (formerly of The Drips) also joining Mariachi El Bronx. That June they posted the new song \\"Knifeman\\", from The Bronx, on their Myspace profile, followed by the premiere of \\"PR Rules\\" from El Bronx. During summer 2008, The Bronx played the entirety of the Warped Tour. They also appeared in the film What We Do Is Secret as Black Flag, performing the Black Flag song \\"Police Story\\". Beginning with preparations for the release of El Bronx, the band has performed as \\"Mariachi El Bronx\\" when playing their mariachi set and as \\"The Bronx\\" for rock sets. The Bronx was released on November 11, 2008, with El Bronx following on August 17, 2009. The band toured North America, followed by a festival performance in the United Kingdom. A second album of mariachi music, Mariachi El Bronx, was released in August 2011. Several members of the band also appear on the debut EP by Armistice, a Canadian indie pop band consisting of Coeur de pirate and Jay Malinowski.\\"Bedouin Soundclash's Jay Malinowski + Coeur De Pirate + El Bronx = Armistice\\". chartattack.com, January 12, 2011.

Despite scoring the late winner which consummated Dublin City's memorable reversal of a 0‚Äì2 deficit into a 3‚Äì2 victory away to Derry City late in the 2004 season. In contrast to his uninspired form with Dublin City, Hynes proved markedly more productive in the colours of Dundalk, whom he joined in 2005, scoring six goals from midfield in 2005. He formed, alongside Philip Hughes (with whom he played at Dublin City) one half of a prolific forward pairing which manoeuvred Dundalk into a strong position in the League of Ireland First Division. However, he was released by Dundalk following a breach of club discipline on 14 November 2006. In January 2007 he joined Newry City,Newry include new signings but just over a month later on 28 February (the transfer deadline day for League of Ireland clubs), he signed for Derry City.\\"City add striker to squad: Peter Hynes signs from Newry\\", CityWeb, 28 February 2007. The clubs agreed that Hynes would move for free but the agreement also contained a clause which would allow his former club to claim 30% of any future transfer fee if the player was to be sold on. However, Hynes was not initially eligible to play for Derry City as FIFA's rules stated that no player could play for more than two different clubs between 1 July of one season and 30 June of the following year. In Hynes' case, he had already played for both Dundalk and Newry City between 1 July 2006 and his signing for Derry City in February 2007.\\"Clubs hit with two-club ruling\\", Eleven-a-side.ie, 9 March 2007.

Hynes was a regular figure in the Sporting Fingal squad where he formed a successful partnership with Robbie Doyle. In all competitions Hynes contributed 11 goals in 38 games alongside numerous assists for the new league outfit as they finished 3rd in the First Division.

Mielck was born in Vyborg. He started piano lessons at the age of ten; in 1891 he was sent to Berlin, where he studied under Max Bruch, one of the leading composers of the period.

His catalogue includes a large number of works in the field of chamber music, including a string quintet and a string quartet. He also composed a symphony (1897), two overtures, a concert piece for piano and orchestra as well as one for violin and orchestra, the Finnish Suite, and two major vocal works in the German language. Mielck faced disappointment in his home country for the lack‚Äîwith the exception of the Finnish Suite‚Äîof nationalistic (political) tendencies; his interest in the culture of his ancestral Germany made him rather a foreigner in the Finnish music scene.

The group was formed in October 2005 following Stern's announced move from regular radio to Sirius Satellite Radio in 2006. From January 2006 until February 2015, Howard 100 News would broadcast an hourly summary of stories related to Stern, his radio show, and those associated with it, on Howard 100 and Howard 101. The team was downsized in 2006 and again in February 2015, with only a few staffers remaining to follow the lives of the unusual Stern fans and callers known as \\"The Wack Pack.\\" ==Background== On October 6, 2004, Stern announced the signing of a five-year contract with Sirius Satellite Radio starting from January 2006. The move followed a crackdown on perceived indecency in broadcasting that occurred following the controversy surrounding the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show in February. The incident prompted tighter control over content by station owners and managers, leading to Stern feeling \\"dead inside\\" creatively. The five-year deal allowed Stern to produce up to three channels on Sirius with a $100 million per year budget for all production, staff and programming costs including the construction of a dedicated studio. ==Launch and original team== Howard 100 and Howard 101 went live for the first time on September 29, 2005, initially broadcasting silence. As Stern was still under contract with Infinity Broadcasting until January 1, 2006, he could not broadcast any material from the two channels, or talk on its airwaves. Howard 100 News was created by Talk Radio Consultant Walter Sabo, then in-house at Sirius, who worked with Stern on the concept, and CBS News Anchor Jessica Ettinger Gottesman, then an anchor at CBS-owned 1010 WINS-AM all-news radio. Howard 100 News was crafted to sound like 1010 WINS, and aired its first newscast on October 19, 2005, after off-air trial runs. Original content included radio personality Bubba the Love Sponge interviewing Stern's former writer Jackie Martling. The team eventually grew to 17 staffers, many of whom were professional journalists, including Jessica Ettinger, who, while still employed at CBS, used the on-air name Erica Phillips, as well as Lisa Glasberg (known as Lisa G.), and Steve Langford. Just days after being fired from WNYW- TV, the Fox TV station in New York, reporter Penny Crone was hired to work for Howard 100 News. Crone has since left broadcasting and now works as a licensed real estate agent.Penny Crone profile on DouglasElliman Real Estate website ==The team now== In June 2006, most of the Howard 100 News staffers were let go. Stern said that this was because it needed downsizing. News director Liz Aiello departed to become the vice president and general manager of Martha Stewart Living Radio on Sirius XM. Erica Phillips, who also worked at CBS News under her real name, became news director before assuming program director duties at other Sirius channels. Reporters Penny Crone and George Flowers left the team in January 2007 due to budget cuts. Most of the other staffers were released in February 2015, leaving Shuli Egar and Jon Leiberman, who had developed expertise covering Stern's unusual fans and callers, known as \\"The Wack Pack.\\" In January 2017, Lieberman left the Sirius organization and, to date, Egar is the only remaining original member of Howard 100 News.

The poem begins with a description of a young woman weeping at the edge of a river, into which she throws torn-up letters, rings, and other tokens of love. An old man nearby approaches the woman and asks the reason for her sorrow. She responds by telling him of a former lover who pursued, seduced, and finally abandoned her. She recounts in detail the speech her lover gave to her which seduced her. She concludes her story by conceding that she would fall for the young man's false charms again: > O, that infected moisture of his eye, O, that false fire which in his cheek > so glowed, O, that forc'd thunder from his heart did fly, O, that sad breath > his spungy lungs bestowed, O, all that borrowed motion seeming owed, Would > yet again betray the fore-betray'd, And new pervert a reconciled maid!Evans, > G. Blakemore ed., Riverside Shakespeare, 2nd edition, Houghton Mifflin, > 1997, p. 1880. == Authorship == John Bell's 1774 edition of Shakespeare's works Few have questioned the authorship of this poem. Shakespeare's authorship was not questioned until the early 19th century, when Hazlitt expressed doubts. In 1917 Robertson suggested that the poem, and several plays, were written by Chapman. This idea was not widely accepted, and attributions based on general aesthetic impressions of a poem have since become less common among literary scholars.Sharon-Zisser, Shirley & Whitworth, Stephen. \\"Generating Dialogue on Shakespeare‚Äôs Lover‚Äôs Complaint\\". Sharon-Zisser, Shirley, editor. Critical Essays on Shakespeare‚Äôs A Lover‚Äôs Complaint: Suffering Ecstasy. Sharon-Zisser, Whitworth, Stephen. \\"Generating Dialogue on Shakespeare‚Äôs Lover‚Äôs Complaint\\". Routledge (2017) . pp. 1‚Äì4. \\"A Lover's Complaint\\" contains words and forms not found elsewhere in Shakespeare, including archaisms and Latinisms. Edmond Malone called the poem \\"beautiful\\", and suggested that Shakespeare may have been trying to compete with Edmund Spenser. Critics have seen thematic parallels to situations in Shakespeare's All's Well That Ends Well and Measure for Measure. According to John Kerrigan in Motives of Woe, the poem may be regarded as an appropriate coda to the sonnets, with its narrative triangle of young woman, elderly man, and seductive suitor paralleling a similar triangle in the sonnets themselves.John Kerrigan, Motives of Woe: Shakespeare and Female Complaint (1991) Stanley Wells and Paul Edmondson note that: Shakespeare is widely accepted as the poems' author. This is supported by studies written by Kenneth Muir, Eliot Slater and MacDonald P. Jackson.Shirley Sharon-Zisser & Whitworth, Stephen. \\"Generating Dialogue in Shakespeare's A Lover's Complaint\\", Critical Essays on Shakespeare's 'A Lover's Complaint': Suffering Ecstasy, Ashgate Publishing, 2006, pp. 1‚Äì55. === Alternative views === One writer suggests that the author was an anonymous early Elizabethan poet.Marina Tarlinskajam \\"Who Did NOT Write A Lover's Complaint\\", Shakespeare Yearbook 15, 2005. In 2007 Brian Vickers, suggested the poem was written by John Davies of Hereford, an author of theological pamphlets.Vickers, John, Shakespeare, 'A Lover's Complaint', and John Davies of Hereford, Cambridge University Press, 2007. He details arguments for the non-Shakespearean nature of the poem and lists numerous verbal parallels between the \\"Complaint\\" and the known works of Davies: ‚Äì such as 'What brest so cold that is not warmed heare' and 'What heart's so cold that is not set on fire'. On this evidence it was omitted from the 2007 RSC Complete Works. MacDonald P. Jackson, in his review of Vickers' book in the Review of English Studies, calls this omission a \\"mistake\\" and states that Vickers' evidence is \\"very meagre.\\" Jackson adds: Harold Love, in his The Times Literary Supplement review, has similar questions regarding Vickers' suggestion: == References == == External links == * A Lover's Complaint (1609) Full text. * Annotated text.

He spent the 2003-04 season on loan at Clyde, signing initially for six months, then extending the deal until the end of the season in January 2004. During his time at Clyde he won the SFL Young Player of the Month award for February 2004. Looking to play first team football, he moved to St Johnstone in June 2004. After only two months at the club, his contract was terminated by mutual consent on 31 August 2004. One month later, Marshall signed for Falkirk on a short term contract, which was later extended for the rest of the 2004‚Äì05 season. He was released by Falkirk at the end of the season. In March 2011, Marshall signed for Icelandic club B√ç/Bolungarv√≠k and in August 2011, moved to fellow Icelandic side Knattspyrnuf√©lagi√∞ V√≠kingur. In March 2012, Marshall signed a contract with J2 League side FC Machida Zelvia.

A. Kulkarni (Gurunath Abaji Kulkarni) or simply \\"GA\\" ( 10 July 1923 - 11 December 1987 ) (Marathi: ‡§ú‡•Ä. ‡§è. ‡§ï‡•Å‡§≤‡§ï‡§∞‡•ç‡§£‡•Ä, \\"‡§ú‡•Ä‡§è\\"), was a legendary Sahitya Akademi Award winner Marathi writer of short stories. Kulkarni grew up in Belgaum. After earning his master's degree, he taught English at JSS College in Dharwad for about 30 years. He had very strong liking for Dharwad and Belgaum. For medical treatment of his eyes, he reluctantly moved to Pune in 1985. A major road in the Kothrud area of Pune, where Kulkarni lived for couple of years before his death, has been named after him. Kulkarni, who bought new strength and vitality to the Marathi short story, is admittedly the most distinguished exponent of that genre. A contemporary of Gangadhar Gadgil, Arvind Gokhale and Vyankatesh Madgulkar, he did not subscribe to the cause of modernism in literature. He charted his own separate course and cultivated new acuity and taste for a class of faithful readers. Kulkarni created a world of his own in his short stories where his characters are in pursuit of the unknowable destiny. A dark mode reflects the inscrutable ways in which destiny shadows his characters. His use of symbolism, allegory and irony provides his stories a unique texture and ethos. His world encompasses a wide diversity of locales, situations, characters and experiences; yet, in his earlier stories, it is demarcated by the region bordering Maharashtra and Karnataka. The mythic, allegorical experiences make it difficult to sort out the realities from the dreams, themes, and meditations. Yet, it is possible for the reader to identify with his characters, places, and experiences because of his keen observation of human, animal, and social worlds in their beauty and deformity. Critics observe that characters in Kulkarni's world are multifaceted, but they are not independent. They lead their lives as if they are puppets guided by an unseen hand and are unable to change the direction. Why they follow that path to their demise or why they cannot change it by their volition is not known. In that sense, his work is a reversal of direction fostered by the modernist short story in Marathi. GA's earlier short stories depicted the tragic and cruel aspects of the human situation. His later works were almost Kafkaesque, without Kafka-like black humour. Some of his later works were allegorical and reminiscent of Borges. Some of Kulkarni's short stories have been translated into English, Hindi, and Kannada. He was honoured in 1973 with a Sahitya Akademi Award for his collection of short stories Kajalmaya. Critically acclaimed Marathi movie Kairee,Kairee on IMDB which was directed by Amol Palekar, was based on one of his short stories. Based on GA's short story, Director Kranti Kanade made short film Chaitra that went on to win five National Film Awards in 2002. Kulkarni was a prolific correspondent. Though he had an obsession to keep his life private, he also longed to reach out through letters to his friends who shared his tastes. Four volumes of his letters were published after his death. He had written many of those letters to \\"Shri Pu\\" Bhagwat, Sunita Deshpande, Madhav Achawal, Jaywant Dalvi, Anantrao Kulkarni, and \\"Ma Da\\" Hatkanangalekar. Kulkarni translated five novels by Conrad Richter into Marathi in the 1960s for a project which USIS in India had initiated for getting some prominent American writings translated into Indian languages. He also wrote the book Manase Arbhat Ani Chillar, which contains seemingly autobiographical musings. == Works == * Nilasavala (‡§®‡§ø‡§≥‡§æ‡§∏‡§æ‡§µ‡§≥‡§æ) (1959) * Hirave Rave (‡§π‡§ø‡§∞‡§µ‡•á ‡§∞‡§æ‡§µ‡•á) (1960) * Parava (‡§™‡§æ‡§∞‡§µ‡§æ) (1960) * RaktaChandan (‡§∞‡§ï‡•ç‡§§‡§ö‡§Ç‡§¶‡§®) (1966) * Kajalmaya (‡§ï‡§æ‡§ú‡§≥‡§Æ‡§æ‡§Ø‡§æ) (1972) * Pingalavel (‡§™‡§ø‡§Ç‡§ó‡§≥‡§æ‡§µ‡•á‡§≥) * Sanjshakun (‡§∏‡§æ‡§Ç‡§ú‡§∂‡§ï‡•Å‡§® ) (1975) * Ramalkhuna (‡§∞‡§Æ‡§≤‡§ñ‡•Å‡§£‡§æ) (1975) * Ek Arabi Kahani (‡§è‡§ï ‡§Ö‡§∞‡§¨‡•Ä ‡§ï‡§π‡§æ‡§£‡•Ä) (1983) (Translated) * Onjaldhara (‡§ì‡§Ç‡§ú‡§≥‡§ß‡§æ‡§∞‡§æ) (1984) (Translated) * Bakhar Bimmachi (‡§¨‡§ñ‡§∞ ‡§¨‡§ø‡§Æ‡•ç‡§Æ‡§ö‡•Ä) (1986) (for children) * Mugdhachi Rangit Goshta (‡§Æ‡•Å‡§ó‡•ç‡§ß‡§æ‡§ö‡•Ä ‡§∞‡§Ç‡§ó‡•Ä‡§§ ‡§ó‡•ã‡§∑‡•ç‡§ü) (1986) (for children) * Pailpakhare (‡§™‡•à‡§≤‡§™‡§æ‡§ñ‡§∞‡•á ) (1986) (Translated) * Akashphule (‡§Ü‡§ï‡§æ‡§∂‡§´‡•Å‡§≤‡•á) (Translated) * Manase Arbhat Ani Chillar (‡§Æ‡§æ‡§£‡§∏‡•á -‡§Ö‡§∞‡§≠‡§æ‡§ü ‡§Ü‡§£‡§ø ‡§ö‡§ø‡§≤‡•ç‡§≤‡§∞) (1988) * Kusumgunja (‡§ï‡•Å‡§∏‡•Å‡§Æ‡§ó‡•Å‡§Ç‡§ú‡§æ) (1989; posthumous) * Sonpawale (‡§∏‡•ã‡§®‡§™‡§æ‡§µ‡§≤‡•á) (1991; posthumous) * Dohakalima (‡§°‡•ã‡§π‡§ï‡§æ‡§≥‡§ø‡§Æ‡§æ) (1987) (Collection of stories from GA's first four books) * Niyatidaan (‡§®‡§ø‡§Ø‡§§‡§ø‡§¶‡§æ‡§® ) (1992; posthumous) (Collection of Hindi translation of GA's selected short stories) * Raan (‡§∞‡§æ‡§®) (1967) (Translated; Original ‚Äì The Trees by Conrad Richter) * Gaav (‡§ó‡§æ‡§µ) (1967) (Translated; Original ‚Äì The Town by Conrad Richter) * Swatantrya Ale Ghara (‡§∏‡•ç‡§µ‡§æ‡§§‡§Ç‡§§‡•ç‡§∞‡•ç‡§Ø ‡§Ü‡§≤‡•á ‡§ò‡§∞‡§æ) (1968) (Translated; Original ‚Äì The Free Man by Conrad Richter)) * Ranatil Prakash (‡§∞‡§æ‡§®‡§æ‡§§‡•Ä‡§≤ ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§ï‡§æ‡§∂) (1968) (Translated; Original ‚Äì The Light in the Forest by Conrad Richter) * Shiwaar (‡§∂‡§ø‡§µ‡§æ‡§∞) (1968) (Translated; Original ‚Äì The Fields by Conrad Richter) * Sonyache Madake (‡§∏‡•ã‡§®‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§ö‡•á ‡§Æ‡§°‡§ï‡•á) (1991; posthumous) (Translated, Original ‚Äì Crock of Gold by James Stephens) * Lord of the Flies (‡§≤‡•â‡§∞‡•ç‡§° ‡§ë‡§´ ‡§¶‡•Ä ‡§´‡•ç‡§≤‡§æ‡§à‡§ú) (1987) (Translated, Original ‚Äì Lord of the Flies, By William Golding) * Vairyachi Ek Ratra (‡§µ‡•à‡§±‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§ö‡•Ä ‡§è‡§ï ‡§∞‡§æ‡§§‡•ç‡§∞) (1982) (Translated, Original ‚Äì I Survived Hitler's Ovens by Olga Lengyel) * Amrutphale (‡§Ö‡§Æ‡•É‡§§‡§´‡§≥‡•á) (1983) (Translated, Original ‚Äì Apples of immortality by Leon Surmelian) * G.A. -nchi Nivadak Patre ‚Äì Khand I,II, III, IV (‡§ú‡•Ä.‡§è‡§Ç. ‡§ö‡•Ä ‡§®‡§ø‡§µ‡§°‡§ï ‡§™‡§§‡•ç‡§∞‡•á; ‡§ñ‡§Ç‡§° ‡•ß,‡•®.‡•©.‡•™) (1995,1998, 2006; posthumous) * G.A. -nchi PatraVela (‡§ú‡•Ä.‡§è‡§Ç.‡§ö‡•Ä ‡§™‡§§‡•ç‡§∞‡§µ‡•á‡§≥‡§æ; Letters to Kavi Grace and his daughter Mithila) (2010; posthumous) * Diwas Tudawat Andharakade (‡§¶‡§ø‡§µ‡§∏ ‡§§‡•Å‡§°‡§µ‡§§ ‡§Ö‡§Ç‡§ß‡§æ‡§∞‡§æ‡§ï‡§°‡•á ) (2015; posthumous) (Translated:1953, Original ‚Äì Long Day's Journey into Night by Eugene O'Neill) * A Journey Forever: Iskilaar and Other Stories (2015; posthumous) (Collection of English translation of GA's selected short stories like Iskilaar.

The castle lies on the top of a steep hill called the Tor, and has been fortified since the late Anglo-Saxon period. After the Norman conquest of England in the 11th century, William de Mohun constructed a timber castle on the site as part of the pacification of Somerset. A stone shell keep was built on the motte by the start of the 12th century, and the castle survived a siege during the early years of the Anarchy. At the end of the 14th century the de Mohuns sold the castle to the Luttrell family, who continued to occupy the property until the late 20th century. The castle was expanded several times by the Luttrell family during the 17th and 18th centuries; they built a large manor house within the Lower Ward of the castle in 1617, and this was extensively modernised, first during the 1680s and then during the 1760s. The medieval castle walls were mostly destroyed following the siege of Dunster Castle at the end of the English Civil War, when Parliament ordered the defences to be slighted to prevent their further use. In the 1860s and 1870s, the architect Anthony Salvin was employed to remodel the castle to fit Victorian tastes; this work extensively changed the appearance of Dunster to make it appear more Gothic and Picturesque. Following the death of Alexander Luttrell in 1944, the family was unable to afford the death duties on his estate. The castle and surrounding lands were sold off to a property firm, the family continuing to live in the castle as tenants. The Luttrells bought back the castle in 1954, but in 1976 Colonel Walter Luttrell gave Dunster Castle and most of its contents to the National Trust, which operates it as a tourist attraction. It is a Grade I listed building and scheduled monument. ==History== ===11th to 12th centuries=== Dunster Castle was positioned on a steep, high hill, sometimes called the Tor, overlooking the village of Dunster in Somerset.Mackenzie, p.54. During the early medieval period the sea reached the base of the hill, close to the mouth of the River Avill, offering a natural defence and making the village an inland port.Dunning, pp.37‚Äì39; Creighton, pp.41‚Äì42. Several Iron Age hillforts were built close to Dunster, including Bat's Castle, Black Ball Camp and Grabbist Hill, but the earliest evidence of a fortification at Dunster was an Anglo-Saxon burgh.Black Ball Camp, Arts and Humanities Data Service, accessed 28 September 2007; univallate Hillfort, Arts and Humanities Data Service, accessed 28 September 2007; Gathercole, ClareAn archaeological assessment of Dunster (PDF) Somerset County Council accessed 1 October 2011 This was built on the summit of the hill and was possibly intended to protect the region against sea-borne raiders; by the mid-11th century it was controlled by a local nobleman called Aelfric.Mackenzie, p.54; Garnett, p.38. Watermill; C ‚Äî Castle; D ‚Äî Great Gatehouse; E River Avill In 1066 the Normans invaded south-east England, defeating the English forces at the battle of Hastings: in the aftermath of the victory, William the Conqueror entrusted the conquest of the south-west of England to his half-brother Robert of Mortain.Prior, pp.74‚Äì75. Expecting stiff resistance, Robert marched west into Somerset, supported by forces under Walter of Douai, who entered from the north; a third force, under the command of William de Mohun, landed by sea along the Somerset coast.Prior, p.75. William had been granted 68 manors in the region and by 1086 had established a castle at Dunster; this would form both the caput, or principal castle, for his new lands, and help guard the coast against the threat of any fresh sea-borne attack, as well as controlling the coastal road running from Somerset to Gloucestershire.Prior, p.76; Garnett, p.38. This first castle was a motte and bailey design, built upon the former Anglo-Saxon burgh; the top of the Tor was scarped to form the motte, or Upper Ward, and an area below shaped to form the bailey, or Lower Ward.Prior, p.108. Somerset became more stable in the aftermath of the post-invasion period and the unsuccessful 1068 rebellion against Norman rule. It was common in the period for the Normans to build religious houses to accompany major castles, and accordingly William de Mohun endowed a Benedictine priory at Dunster in 1090, along with its parent abbey at Bath.Creighton, p.187; Lyte (1880), p.60. The River Avill was important for trade; the region around Dunster was rich with fisheries and vineyards, and Dunster Castle prospered. Stone fortifications were built on the site during the early 12th century, probably forming a shell keep around the top of the motte.Prior, pp.108‚Äì109; Mackenzie, p.58; Lyte (1880), p.60; Garnett, p.5. In the late 1130s England began to descend into a period of civil war known as the Anarchy, during which the supporters of King Stephen fought with those of the Empress Matilda for control of the kingdom. William de Mohun's eldest son, also called William, was a noted supporter of Matilda, and Dunster was considered one of her faction's strongest castles in the south-west.Lyte (1880), p.61. In 1138 forces loyal to Stephen besieged the castle; a siege castle was built nearby, but all trace of it has been lost.Creighton, p.56; Mackenzie, p.58. William successfully held the castle and was made the Earl of Somerset by the grateful Empress. Chroniclers complained of the way in which he subsequently raided and controlled the region by force during the war, causing much destruction.Lyte (1880), p.61; Garnett, p.38. In the aftermath of the conflict, William's son, another William, inherited the castle after a short period of royal ownership under Henry II.Lyte (1880), p.62. William appears to have insisted that his tenants agree to help repair and maintain the castle walls as part of their feudal service.Lyte (1909), p.350. ===13th to 17th centuries=== Great Gatehouse; when first built, the Lower Ward on the right would have been at the same height as the gateway In the 13th century the Lower Ward was rebuilt in stone by Reynold Mohun; this was paid for in part by Reynold commuting his tenants' ongoing duty to repair the castle walls into a single, one-off financial payment to their lord, and partially through his marriage to a rich local heiress.Lyte (1909), pp.349‚Äì352. A survey of the castle in 1266 described the Upper Ward on the top of the motte as containing a hall with a buttery, a pantry, a kitchen, a bakehouse, the chapel of Saint Stephen and a knight's hall, guarded by three towers.Garnett, p.30; Lyte (1909), p.353. The Lower Ward included a granary, two towers and a gatehouse; one of the towers, called the Fleming Tower, was used as a prison.Lyte (1909), p.353. The castle stables lay outside the defences, further down the slope. By the end of the 13th century some of the castle's roofing had been covered in lead, while other parts still used wooden shingles.Dunning, pp.37‚Äì39. In 1330 Sir John de Mohun inherited the castle; John, although a notable knight, was childless and fell into considerable debt.Garnett, pp.38‚Äì39. His wife Joan took over the running of their estates, and when John died in 1376 she agreed to sell the castle to Lady Elizabeth Luttrell, the leading member of another major Norman family, for 5,000 marks, with the castle to transfer to Elizabeth on Joan's death.Garnett, p.39. At some point during this period additional stone buildings were constructed along the Lower Ward, on the side of the current mansion, and records suggest that a ditch, or moat, may have existed around the base of the Tor in the 14th century.Lyte (1909), pp.354, 362. Joan outlived Elizabeth, and in the event Sir Hugh Luttrell, who was Henry V's seneschal in Normandy, finally took over the castle on Joan's death in 1404. The castle had suffered from a lack of investment during the final years of the Mohan's ownership, and Luttrell repaired and extended the castle at a cost of ¬£252, constructing the Great Gatehouse and a barbican between 1419 and 1424.Dunning, pp.37‚Äì39; Emery, p.677; Garnet p.39. The new entrance lay at right-angles to the old and was three storeys high, built of imported Bristol red sandstone, and contained extensive apartments; it formed a grand, if ill- defended, ceremonial route into the castle.Emery, pp.677‚Äì678; Garnett, p.30. The castle was reroofed with Cornish stone tiles.Garnett, p.30. By the 15th century the sea had receded, and the Luttrells created a deer park for the castle at Marshwood.Dunster New Park, Dunster, Somerset Historic Environment Record, Somerset County Council, accessed 9 July 2011; Garnett, p.29. Such a park would have been highly prestigious and allowed the Luttrells to engage in hunting, providing the castle with a supply of venison as well as generating income.Creighton, pp.190‚Äì191; Creighton and Higham, p.57.

In 1461, Sir James Luttrell died following the Lancastrian defeat at the Second Battle of St Albans, and his family were deprived of their estates by the Yorkist Edward IV. The castle was given to the Herberts, but the Luttrells regained it on the accession of the Lancastarian Henry VII in 1485, when Dunster was restored to James' son, Sir Hugh Luttrell. Hugh repaired the castle chapel and in the early 16th century his son, Sir Andrew Luttrell, built a new wall on the east side of the castle.Lyte (1909), p.364. Andrew's son Sir John Luttrell, who inherited the castle, was a famous soldier, diplomat, and courtier under Henry VIII and Edward VI, serving in France and in Scotland during the conflicts of the Rough Wooing.Phillips, pp.197, 207; Garnett, p.39. In 1542, the antiquarian John Leland reported the castle keep and buildings to be considerable disrepair, with the exception of the chapel, and after Sir John's death the castle was leased out for several years, first by his daughter, Mary, and then under his brother, Thomas.Garnett, pp.30, 39; LUTTRELL, Thomas (d.1571), of Marshwood and Dunster Castle, Som, The History of Parliament Trust, accessed 28 May 2013. By the time George Luttrell inherited the castle in 1571, it was dilapidated, with the family preferring to live in their house, now known as Court House, at East Quantoxhead.Garnett, pp.30, 39. In 1617 George employed the architect William Arnold, to create a new house in the Lower Ward of the castle. Arnold was an important architect in the south-west of England, and had managed the building of nearby Montacute, Cranborne House and also Wadham College, Oxford.Garnett, p.31. The redesign expanded on some of the existing buildings and walls to create a 16th-century Jacobean mansion with a symmetrical front and square towers, set within the older castle walls and overlooked by the keep above.Garnett, pp.5, 31; Lyte (1909), p.365. The building was decorated in the latest styles, including ornamental plaster ceilings.Lyte (1909), p.365. The project ran almost three times over budget, costing Luttrell more than ¬£1,200. ====English Civil War and the Restoration==== Original 13th- century gate, bound in iron In the 1640s the English Civil War broke out between the supporters of King Charles I and Parliament. Thomas Luttrell, George's eldest son, initially supported Parliament and after the outbreak of war William Russell, the Duke of Bedford and Parliamentary commander in Devon and Somerset, ordered him to increase the garrison at Dunster to resist a potential Royalist attack.Carter, p.2. The Royalist commander William Seymour, the Duke of Somerset, attacked the castle in 1642 but was driven back by the garrison, led by Thomas' wife, Jane.Garnett, p.40. The war in the south-west turned in favour of the King, and on 7 June 1643 the Royalists mustered forces to attack the castle again: this time Luttrell surrendered, switching sides to support the Royalists until his death the following February. Colonel Wyndham was appointed the Royalist governor of the castle. The young Prince Charles, the later Charles II, stayed at the castle in May 1645.Garnett, p.45. During 1645 the Royalist military cause largely collapsed, and Colonel Robert Blake led a Parliamentary force against Dunster in October. In November Blake began his siege of the castle, setting up his artillery in Dunster village and starting to dig tunnels to plant mines beneath the walls. The castle was briefly relieved by reinforcements in February 1646, but the siege was resumed and by April the Royalists situation was untenable ‚Äì an honourable surrender was negotiated and a Parliamentary garrison installed.Garnett, p.40; Carter, p.3. After the end of the Second English Civil War in 1649, however, Parliament decided to deliberately destroy, or slight, the defences of castles in key Royalist areas, including the south-west.Thompson, p.154. In the case of Dunster, Thomas's son George Luttrell was able to convince the authorities to destroy only the medieval defensive walls, rather than the entire castle, leaving Dunster damaged from the recent siege but still habitable; the walls were demolished over 12 days in August 1650 by a team of 300 workmen.Garnett, pp.40‚Äì41; Thompson, p.156; Lyte (1909), p.367. The only parts of the medieval walls to survive were the Great Gatehouse and the bases of the two towers in the Lower Ward.Carter, p.3; Garnett, p.31. George Luttrell died without children, and Dunster Castle passed to his brother Francis, who survived the political turmoil of both the Commonwealth years and the Restoration of Charles II to power in 1660. Francis' heir, another Francis, married a wealthy heiress worth ¬£2,500 a year (¬£331,000 in 2009 values) and with this income set about modernising the castle during the 1680s, in particular building a grand staircase in the latest style.Garnett, p.41; Lyte (1909), p.368; price ref. Francis was a colonel in the local militia and in 1688 backed William of Orange's attempt to oust James II; when William landed in Devon, Francis mustered a number of companies of infantry at Dunster on 19 November to support him, which formed the basis for the later Green Howards regiment.Garnett, p.41. During this period the castle still kept an armoury of 43 muskets.National Trust Arts, Buildings, Collections Bulletin, February 2011, p.3, (PDF) Felicity Baber and Brian Godwin, the National Trust, accessed 24 September 2011. Francis died heavily in debt in 1690, and his widow Mary moved the contents of the castle to London, where they were destroyed in a fire in 1696. ===18th century=== The castle in 1733, showing the then recently planted New Way, the mansion (l), Great Gatehouse (c) and stables (r). The motte, with the summer house, is visible in the background At the start of the 18th century the Luttrells and Dunster Castle faced many financial challenges.Garnett, p.42. Francis's son Alexander, inherited the castle when he came of age in 1704, but it was still mostly empty and carried large debts with it. Alexander died young in 1711 and his widow, Dorothy, spent almost twenty years paying off the debts. Dorothy built a new chapel, designed by Sir James Thornhill in white Portland stone, on the rear of the mansion at a cost of ¬£1,300 (¬£178,000 at 2009 prices); few records of this remain, but the interior probably resembled that of the chapel at Wimpole Hall.Garnett, pp.31, 41, Lyte (1909), p.373; Five Ways to Compute the Relative Value of a UK Pound Amount, 1830 to Present, Lawrence H. Officer, MeasuringWorth, accessed 24 September 2011. A safer, if less grand, approach road to the castle was created, called the New Way, and the remains of the Upper Ward on top of the motte were flattened to be used as a bowling green, complete with an octagonal summer house.Garnett, p.31; Lyte (1909), pp.372‚Äì373. Dorothy's son, Alexander Luttrell, took over the castle in 1726 but ran up new debts, and the castle was handed over into the control of a receiver. Henry Fownes Luttrell, who married Margaret, Alexander's daughter, and took the Luttrell name, moved to Dunster in 1747.Garnett, p.42; Dunster Castle's portraits of noteworthy Luttrells: Margaret and Henry Fownes Luttrell (m.1747), the National Trust, accessed 12 March 2015. The couple redesigned and redecorated the castle in a Rococo style, including the extensive use of the recently invented and highly fashionable wallpaper.Garnett, p.42; Lyte (1909), p.376. Henry Luttrell raised the ground height of the Lower Ward between 1764 and 1765 to extend the New Way all around to the front of his mansion, adding additional ornamental towers onto the inside of the Great Gatehouse in the process.Emery, p.677; Lyte (1909), pp.378‚Äì379. A folly, Conygar Tower, was constructed by architect Richard Phelps to improve the view from the castle, and a larger park of 141 hectares (348 acres) was built just to the south of the castle, requiring the eviction of a number of tenant farmers.Garnett, pp.27, 29. ===19th and 20th centuries=== The Justice's Desk in the Justice Room Henry's son, John, inherited the castle in 1780, but when his son, also called John, inherited in 1816 he chose to live in London instead, opening up Dunster Castle to the public.Garnett, pp.44, 48. By 1845 the castle appeared to visitors to be past its prime: with only two of John's sisters living there and no horses or hunting dogs left in the castle grounds, the remaining servants had little to do.Garnett, p.44. John's brother Henry inherited in 1857, but he too lived in London rather than at Dunster. George Luttrell inherited the castle in 1867 and began an extensive modernisation, backed by the considerable income from the Dunster estates ‚Äì in a period of agricultural boom in England, the estates were producing ¬£22,000 in revenue a year (¬£1.49 million at 2010 prices).Garnett, p.44; Five Ways to Compute the Relative Value of a UK Pound Amount, 1830 to Present, Lawrence H. Officer, MeasuringWorth, accessed 24 September 2011. It was fashionable during the mid-Victorian period to remodel existing castles to produce what was felt to be a more consistent Gothic or sometimes Picturesque appearance and George, a keen historian, decided to follow this trend at Dunster; in the process, he also hoped to accommodate the larger household and facilities required for a 19th-century landowner: by 1881, the castle required 15 \\"living-in\\" servants alone.Garnett, pp.32, 35. He employed Anthony Salvin, a noted architect then most famous for his work at Alnwick Castle, to carry out the work between 1868 and 1872 at a total cost of ¬£25,350 (equivalent to ¬£1.76 million in 2010).Garnett, p.32; Five Ways to Compute the Relative Value of a UK Pound Amount, 1830 to Present, Lawrence H. Officer, MeasuringWorth, accessed 24 September 2011. The work included the construction of an underground reservoir, holding of water to provide running water for the castle and village.Dunster Castle to open underground Victorian reservoir, BBC News, accessed 1 January 2016; MSO10036 - Reservoir, Dunster Castle, Exmoor National Park, accessed 1 January 2016. Salvin aimed to create a castle that would appear to have grown up organically over time, but still appeal to Victorian aesthetic taste. Accordingly, a large, square tower was built on the west side of the castle and another smaller tower on the east, both creating additional space but also making the castle deliberately asymmetrical.Garnett, pp.32‚Äì33. The 18th-century chapel at the rear was demolished and replaced with another tower, alongside a modern conservatory.Garnett, p.33. A variety of windows in the styles of different historical periods were inserted in the walls, while modern Victorian technology, including gas lighting-supported by a gas plant in the basement- central heating and new kitchens were installed within the castle. The roof of the Great Gatehouse was raised to create a more uniform sequence of battlements, and a large hall for gatherings of the local farmers installed.Emery, p.677; Garnett, p.27. A new wing of servants' quarters and offices were sunk into the hill, spread over two floors leading away from the main part of the mansion.Garnett, p.36. Plan of the castle, after 1872: A - Dining Room; B ‚Äì Service rooms and stairway to servants' wing; C ‚Äì Inner Hall; D ‚Äì Entrance Lobby; E ‚Äì Outer Hall; F ‚Äì Drawing Room; G ‚Äì Billiard Room; H ‚Äì Conservatory; I ‚Äì Justice Room; J ‚Äì Library Internally, Salvin knocked through existing rooms to create the Outer Hall, a new gallery on the first floor, a billiard room, a new library and a drawing room.Garnett, p.6, 16, 21‚Äì24. Much of the wooden 17th-century panelling in the parlour and the hall had to be stripped out as part of the renovations.Lyte (1909), p.382. As part of his work, Salvin appears to have used a number of rolled wrought-iron beams to span the resulting structural gaps in the building, an advanced use of that technology for the time.Dunster Castle Roof Repairs 2006‚Äì2008, p.17, (PDF) Michael Heaton Heritage Consultants, accessed 24 September 2011. The house was refurnished with newly bought 16th and 17th-century artwork, two brass Italian cannons and a stuffed polar bear.Lyte (1909), p.382; Garnett, p.6. Alexander Luttrell, who inherited Dunster Castle in 1910, chose to live at East Quantoxhead instead, and it was left empty until his son Geoffrey reoccupied the castle in 1920, redecorating some of the rooms in a contemporary style and building a polo ground alongside the castle.Garnett, pp.29, 33, 46. The castle and the surrounding countryside at this time was very popular with the Luttrells for fox hunting and shooting. During the Second World War the castle was used as a convalescent home for injured naval and American officers between 1943 and 1944.Garnett, p.47. Alexander died in 1944, and the death duties proved crippling to Geoffrey. In 1949 he sold the castle and 3,480 hectares (8,600 acres) of the lands to the Ashdale Property Company, retaining a tenancy of the castle for himself. The Crown Estate bought the estate from Ashdale and sold the castle back to Geoffrey in 1954. His son Colonel Walter Luttrell lived away from Dunster, and following the death of his mother ‚Äì the last Luttrell to live in the property ‚Äì gave the castle and most of its contents to the National Trust in 1976. ==Today== The castle in 2011, showing the Great Gatehouse (l) and the main body of the castle (r) Dunster Castle is operated by the National Trust as a tourist attraction. Little remains of the medieval castle except for the Great Gatehouse and the remains of several towers in the Lower Ward; the heart of the modern castle today is the much altered 17th-century manor house.Emery, p.677. The key features of the castle include the original 13th-century gates and several pieces of art, including a Tudor copy of Hans Eworth's famous allegorical portrait of Sir John Luttrell, and a sequence of leather tapestries showing scenes from the story of Antony and Cleopatra.Garnett, pp.9, 16‚Äì17, 30. The castle also holds a piano that once belonged to the composer Vivian Ellis.Garnett, p.13. The gardens surrounding the castle cover approximately and include the National Plant Collection of Strawberry Trees; the wider parkland beyond totals .Explore the Garden, the National Trust, accessed 24 September 2011; Dunster Castle, Parks and Gardens UK, Parks and Gardens Data Services Ltd., accessed 9 July 2011. Just to the south of the castle is the restored 18th-century castle watermill.Garnett, p.28. In 2017 the castle received 209,245 visitors.Latest Visitor Figures, Association of Leading Visitor Attractions, accessed 18 May 2018. Dunster Castle has been designated by English Heritage as a Grade I listed building and Scheduled Ancient Monument.Dunster Castle and gatehouse, English Heritage, accessed 7 February 2008; Dunster Castle, English Heritage, accessed 9 July 2011. The castle has required continuing maintenance work, in particular to its roof, itself an important historical feature. Efforts have been made to gradually redecorate the castle in a period style, using reproductions of original wallpapers and materials.Dunster Castle Roof Repairs 2006‚Äì2008, (PDF) pp.4, 15, Michael Heaton Heritage Consultants, accessed 24 September 2011; Garnett, pp.21, 15. The National Trust installed solar panels behind the battlements on the roof in 2008 to provide electricity and make the premises more environmentally friendly. This was the first time the National Trust have taken this approach to a Grade I listed building, and it is expected to save 1,714 kg (3,778 lb) of carbon a year.The 1,000-year-old Castle Fighting Climate Change, Steven Morris, 7 February 2008, The Guardian, accessed 24 September 2011; Sustainable Technology Case Study, (PDF) the National Trust, accessed 24 September 2011. In 2015, the National Trust announced plans to make the 19th-century reservoir open to the public, and the reservoir was formally opened for viewing in April 2016. ==See also== * List of Grade I listed buildings in West Somerset * List of National Trust properties in Somerset * Castles in Great Britain and Ireland * List of castles in England ==Notes== ==References== ==Bibliography== * Alexander, Magnus and Susan Westlake.

Formerly the seat of the Diocese, later Archdiocese, of Modena, it has been since 1986 the archiepiscopal seat of the Archdiocese of Modena-Nonantola. Consecrated in 1184, it is an important Romanesque building in Europe, and along with its bell tower, the Torre della Ghirlandina, is designated as a World Heritage Site. ==History== Since the 5th century, two churches had existed on the site of the present cathedral: the discovery of the burial site of Saint Geminianus, Modena's patron saint, led to the destruction of those churches and building of this cathedral by 1099. The initial design and direction was provided by an architect known as Lanfranco, little else is known about this architect. The Saint's remains are still exhibited in the cathedral's crypt. The present cathedral was consecrated by Pope Lucius III on July 12, 1184.San Geminiano di Modena This is also the place where Modena kept Bologna's Bucket from the War of the Bucket. ==Embellishment== Inscription on the apse. After Lanfranco's work, the Cathedral was embellished by Anselmo da Campione and his heirs, the so-called \\"Campionese-masters\\". The current fa√ßade therefore exhibits different styles. The majestic rose-window was added by Anselmo in the 13th century, while the two lions supporting the entrance's columns date to Roman times, probably discovered while digging the foundations. ==Fa√ßade== The fa√ßade also has notable reliefs by Wiligelmus, a contemporary of Lanfranco; these include portraits of prophets and patriarchs, and most of all the Biblical Stories, a masterpiece of Romanesque sculpture. The scholars have pointed out the splendid achievements in the creation of Adam and Eve, the original sin and the story of Noah. The side portals are also noteworthy. On the Piazza Grande, the porta regia di piazza (piazza portal), also by the campionesi, and the porta dei principi (princes' portal), decorated with a relief depicting episodes of the life of Saint Geminianus, by a pupil of Wiligelmus. On the northern side is the porta della pescheria (fish market portal), with reliefs inspired by the cycle of the twelve months on the doorposts, and tales from the Breton Cycle of King Arthur on the archivolt. ==Interiors== upright The interior is divided into three naves. Between the central nave and the crypt is a marble parapet by Anselmo da Campione portraying the Passion of Christ, including the Last Supper. The pulpit is by Arrigo da Campione, decorated with small terracotta statues. Notable also the wood crucifix from the 14th century. The Duomo houses also the nativity scenes by two great Modenese artistis: Antonio Begarelli's one (1527) and, in the crypt, Guido Mazzoni's one (1480), also known as the Madonna della Pappa (\\"Madonna of the Pap\\"). The Torre della Ghirlandina is annexed to the church. The funeral of the late famed tenor Luciano Pavarotti, a native of Modena, was held in the cathedral. ==Porta della Pescheria== The cathedral's north portal, known as the Porta della Pescheria, features high relief carvings of secular scenes on the marble archivolt and lintel. The carvings on the archivolt are notable for depicting a very early Arthurian scene. Upper part of the Porta della Pescheria. The lintel carvings include a cross, birds, animals, and a man riding a hippocamp. The archivolt carving, dubbed the \\"Modena Archivolt\\" in Arthurian circles, includes inscriptions identifying the figures as Arthurian characters and sets them in a scene which has various correspondences in Arthurian literature. It is possibly the earliest monumental sculpture to feature the Arthurian legend. The sculptor has been dubbed the \\"Arthur Master\\", and critics note that while his inspiration outshines his skill he faithfully captures realistic details in architecture and dress. The date of the piece and the artist's source have been debated vigorously. Roger Sherman Loomis argued for a date at the beginning of the 12th century, which would place the carving decades earlier than the earliest written Arthurian romances on the continent. However, other evidence points to a date no earlier than 1120, and the later work of Jacques Stiennon and Rita Lejeune suggests a date between 1120 and 1140. At the center of the Modena Archivolt image is a castle defended by two towers, inside of which are two figures identified as \\"Mardoc\\" and \\"Winlogee\\". The left tower is defended by a pickaxe-wielding man named \\"Burmaltus\\", who faces off against Artus de Bretania (King Arthur), Isdernus (most likely Yder), and another unnamed knight, who all bear their lances against him. On the other side, the knight \\"Carrado\\" spars with \\"Galvagin\\" (probably Gawain), while \\"Che\\" (Kay) and \\"Galvariun\\" (perhaps Galeshin) approach with their lances at their shoulders. \\"Winlogee\\" most likely corresponds to Arthur's wife, Guinevere. Loomis suggested the names derived from Breton; \\"Winlogee\\" is similar to the Breton name Wenlowen, and Guinevere's name is rendered as the related Gwendoloena in the Latin romance De Ortu Waluuanii. The Abduction of Guinevere is a very popular and ancient element of the Arthurian legend, first appearing in written form in Caradoc of Llancarfan's mid-12th-century Life of Gildas. This version describes Arthur's queen as being kidnapped by King Melwas of the Summer Country and taken to Glastonbury; Arthur only recovers her with the help of Saint Gildas. Later versions call the kidnapper Meleagant and name the queen's lover Lancelot, rather than Arthur himself, as her rescuer. Interesting in the context of the Modena Archivolt is the shadowy early tradition in which the character known as Yder, Ider, or some variant was the queen's lover and rescuer. This tradition is mostly lost but is mentioned in Thomas of Britain's Tristan and survives, in greatly manipulated form, in other romances, the most important of which is Yder. One such romance, Durmart le Galois, includes a scene in which Ydier participates in a rescue of Guinevere, and rides unarmed, as Isdernus does on the Modena Archivolt. The knight Galvagin, the only one with a decorated shield, likely corresponds to Gawain, the hero of many romances. Gawain fights with a knight named Carados of the Dolorous Tower in the Vulgate Cycle (Lancelot-Grail) and Thomas Malory's Le Morte d'Arthur, based on the Vulgate. Further correspondences with material in the Vulgate also occur: notably, the Vulgate includes a scene in which Arthur, his nephew Galeshin, and his seneshal Kay attack Carados of the Dolorous Tower; the names of Arthur's companions are similar to the \\"Che\\" and \\"Galvariun\\" who approach Gawain on the Modena Archivolt. Loomis argued that the Archivolt scene corresponds to the Vulgate version of Guinevere's abduction, and that in an early version Gawain may have been the rescuer rather than Lancelot. Others have argued that the Modena image depicts the lost romance of Yder, or else the early stock version in which Arthur himself was the rescuer. Some others have argued that the image is not of Arthurian origin at all, though this is minority opinion.

Informatics and Information Technology (IIT) are playing the key role. They boost the development of all scientific branches, with the creation of new methodological base to make research and development. The development time decreases, the traditional theoretical and experimental abilities are extended broadly, and so on. Informatics has developed to be an autonomous scientific area, which supports the success not only in the branch of information technologies, but has wide consequences to the lives of individuals and society. It is not a coincidence only that the research in IIT area has become the one research topic among the priority research topics of European Union. This is indicated by the 5th and 6th European Framework Programme and their priorities including IIT. The importance and consequences of IIT research can be demonstrated by their clear support in USA and Japan. This contributes too to the support of IIT in European Union. The example from European Union (which is the most important example for us) shows the emphasis that the support of IIT research is continual for a long time with perspective to the future (compare the priorities of 4th, 5th and 6th Framework Programme); that the IIT research is extending to various research areas. == References == * Official accreditation statement == External links == * Category:Educational institutions established in 2003 Category:Universities in Slovakia Category:Education in Bratislava Category:Buildings and structures in Bratislava Category:Computer science departments ","title":"Faculty of Informatics and Information Technologies"},{"id":"3234029","text":"This article is a list of Chinese philosophers. =The Three Ancient philosophers= == Confucianism == * Confucius, arguably the most influential Chinese philosopher ever. * Dong Zhongshu, integrated Yin Yang cosmology into a Confucian ethical framework. * Gaozi * Mencius, idealist who proposed mankind is innately benevolent. * Wang Fu, endorsed the Confucian model of government. * Wang Mang, emperor who sought to create a harmonious society, yet chaos resulted. * Xunzi, broke from Mencius' view, instead arguing that morality is extrinsic. * Yan Hui,the favorite disciple of Confucius and one of the most revered figures of Confucianism. * Zengzi * Zheng Xuan * Zisi * Zhu Xi * List of Confucianists == Taoism == * Ge Hong * Laozi (Lao Tz≈≠), illusive founder of Taoism and author of the Tao te Ching (Book of the Way). * Lie Yukou, said to be the author of the Daoist book Liezi * Yang Xiong * Zhang Daoling * Zhang Jue * Zhuangzi (Chuang Tz≈≠), mystical and relativistic skeptic. * List of Taoists == Chinese School of Naturalists and Naturalism == * Zou Yan, combined the theories of Yin-Yang and The Five Elements. == Mohism == * Mozi (Mo Tz≈≠), utilitarian and founder of the Mohist school. * Lu Ban == Legalism == * Guan Zhong, whose reforms made him disparagingly identified as Legalist, but actual philosophy did not develop until hundred years later. * Chao Cuo * Han Feizi, synthesizer of Legalist theories. * Li Kui * Li Si * Shang Yang * Shen Buhai * Shen Dao * Zi Chan == Yangism == * Yang Zhu == The Logicians == * Deng Xi * Hui Shi, relativistic Logician who influenced Zhuangzi. * Gongsun Long, logician who was known for his paradoxes. == The Agrarians == * Xu Xing == School of Diplomacy == * Guiguzi * Su Qin * Zhang Yi * Yue Yi * Li Yiji == School of Military == * Sun Tzu * Sun Bin ==Imperial era philosophers== ===Xuanxue=== * Guo Xiang * Wang Bi, Three Kingdoms philosopher * Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove **Ruan Ji **Ji Kang **Shan Tao **Liu Ling **Ruan Xian **Xiang Xiu **Wang Rong ===Zen=== * Huineng, 6th Buddhist patriarch of the Chan (Zen) School in China, he established the concept of \\"no mind\\". * Linji Yixuan (Lin-chi), founder of the Linji school of Chan (Zen) Buddhism in China, a branch of which is the Rinzai school in Japan. * Zhaozhou, famous chan (Zen) master during the 8th century, noted for his wisdom.

There is a small shopping area located at Euclid and Hearst Avenues, at the northern entrance to the university. The Graduate Theological Union is located one block west of Euclid Avenue, in an area nicknamed Holy Hill. The north fork of Strawberry Creek runs southwestward across Northside, mostly culverted under buildings and pavement, to the campus. ==History== Northside is the oldest residential neighborhood in the Berkeley Hills. It was subdivided in 1889 by George Phelps, who named it Daley‚Äôs Scenic Park, after the land‚Äôs previous owner, Thomas Daley. Two years later, the entire tract was purchased for $4,000 in gold by banker Frank M. Wilson, who began to sell lots for houses. Initial development of the neighborhood was begun in the 1890s with the erection of Victorian homes. In 1895, Bernard Maybeck began designing brown-shingle houses whose steep roofs echoed the contour of the hills. Maybeck's notions on hillside building stimulated Daley's Scenic Park residents in 1898 to establish the Hillside Club, formed to protect the hills from unsightly grading and unsuitable buildings, and taking its cue from the Arts and Crafts movement. Prominent club members included Maybeck, Charles Keeler, Benjamin Ide Wheeler, and John Galen Howard. The cradle of the architectural style known as the First Bay Region Tradition, Daley's Scenic Park lost hundreds of buildings in the September 17, 1923, Berkeley Fire. The fire survivors are concentrated in a triangle along the southeastern slopes of the tract, where one can find houses designed by Maybeck, Julia Morgan, Ernest Coxhead, and A.C. Schweinfurth ‚Äî influential architects of this movement. The houses that burned in 1923, most of them clad in brown shingles, were typically replaced with stucco apartment buildings in the southern part of the fire area while many single-family homes were rebuilt in the northern parts. Hilgard Avenue is the rough boundary between these two regions on the eastern side of Euclid Avenue while the single-family home zone extends further south on the western side of Euclid Avenue. Hoyt Hall, one of the student cooperatives in NorthsideFollowing the 1923 fire, seminaries purchased cheap land on Holy Hill. In the 1960s, they formed the Graduate Theological Union. The GTU library, which opened in the 1980s, is sited on land that had been occupied for over 80 years by Frank M. Wilson's home. Across the street, at 1820 Scenic Avenue, is the former home of Benjamin Ide Wheeler, president of the University from 1899 to 1919. Nearby stand the University's former reception hall, built by University Regent Phoebe Apperson Hearst at 1816 Scenic Avenue, and Mrs. Hearst's own house at 2368 Le Conte Avenue. Northside was home to dozens of fraternities and sororities until the 1960s, when University policy forced them to move to the Southside. Some of the chapter houses were taken over by seminaries, several were acquired by the University Students' Cooperative Association, and many others were razed to make way for University facilities such as the two Hearst parking structures, Etcheverry Hall (1966), Foothill Student Housing (1990), and Soda Hall (1994). ==Notable landmarks== Mechanical Engineering department The campus of the Pacific School of Religion, one of several seminaries in the neighborhood * The Graduate Theological Union and its various member schools, clustered around the intersection of Le Conte Avenue, Scenic Avenue, and Ridge Road. * Nine student housing cooperatives, the largest of which are Cloyne Court Hotel and Casa Zimbabwe. ===Designated city landmarks=== * George Jensen House, 1675 La Loma Ave. * Beta Theta Pi Chapter House (now Goldman School of Public Policy), 2607 Hearst Ave. at Le Roy Ave. * Charles Keeler House & Studio, 1770 & 1736 Highland Place * Weltevreden (now Tellefsen Hall), 1755 Le Roy Ave. * Rev.

It was made by The Ren & Stimpy Show creator John Kricfalusi and his company Sp√ºmc√∏. Boo Boo Runs Wild originally aired on Cartoon Network on September 24, 1999, along with A Day in the Life of Ranger Smith, a similar Yogi Bear-themed stand-alone special. Despite Boo Boo being the arguable star of this short, it is title carded as \\"A Ranger Smith Cartoon\\". The short is dedicated to Ed Benedict, the original character designer for The Yogi Bear Show and other Hanna-Barbera properties of the 1950s-1960s. Since its original debut in 1999, Boo Boo Runs Wild has aired multiple times on Cartoon Network's late-night programming block, Adult Swim. Strangely, whenever aired on Adult Swim, it retains its original TV-Y7 rating and was never rerated to TV-PG. From January 2006 until April 2006 Boo Boo Runs Wild aired every Sunday on Adult Swim. On April 1, 2006, following the normal Neon Genesis Evangelion bump, Adult Swim aired Boo Boo Runs Wild as an April Fool's Day joke, despite all TV listings showing Evangelion in its normal time slot. Adult Swim re-aired Boo Boo Runs Wild on Halloween night, October 31, 2008, as part of an advertised \\"Halloween Stunt\\" night, where obscure or randomly seen shows preempted the usual programming for that Friday night. In 2011 Adult Swim re-aired Boo Boo Runs Wild every night from January 10 until January 14, as part of their \\"DVR Theatre\\". It aired again on the nights of August 12, 2016, September 5, 2017 and January 6, 2019. ==Plot== Just when Ranger Smith is making sure everything in Jellystone Park is in order, Boo Boo enters a feral state due to his impatience with all the rules, much to the displeasure of Ranger Smith, who expected Yogi Bear to do this. Boo Boo's actions go from clawing the backsides off trees to savagely devouring honey from a hive, which even convinces Cindy Bear to go feral as well. After Ranger Smith is alerted to this, he is ordered to put Boo Boo down by his chief. Yogi and the Ranger get into a physical altercation over this, finally Yogi ends up beating Ranger. When Boo Boo witnesses this, he tries to stop the fight, but is knocked out by Yogi. This, along with Ranger Smith throwing water on him returns him to normal, much to everyone's' delight and the cartoon ends. ==Voice cast== * John Kricfalusi as Boo Boo Bear, Tree * Stephen Worth as Yogi Bear * Corey Burton as Ranger John Smith, Moose * Mary Ellen Thomas as Cindy Bear * Michael Pataki as The Chief ==See also== * A Day in the Life of Ranger Smith * Boo-Boo Bear * Sp√ºmc√∏ ==ReferencesCategory:1999 television specials Category:Animated television specials Category:American parody films Category:Yogi Bear Category:Sp√ºmc√∏ Category:1990s American animated films Category:American films ","title":"Boo Boo Runs Wild"},{"id":"3234132","text":"Heiko Meyer (born 2 December 1976 in Dresden, Sachsen) is a German diver who competed in the 2000 Summer Olympics.

The game was re-released on June 21, 2018, on GOG.com and Steam (service) by Nightdive Studios, who have acquired the rights to the game. ==Plot== During the 23rd century, man has discovered faster-than-light travel and has finally reached the stars. Galactic exploration had confirmed man's worst two fears. First, a warlike, alien race with vastly superior technology does exist. The exploration fleet reported sentient structures which appear to have been annihilated eons ago, scattered all over the galaxy. Incidentally, the exploration consisted of vessels from three large Earth corporations or, as they are called in the game, CorpoNations (Rimtech, Mil-Agro, and Neuropa). It began as an industrial alliance, and the opportunity to plunder alien technology spurred them onward towards the Hedoth homeworld. As survey ships finally reached the Hedoth sector, the three CorpoNations massed their war fleets nearby. They were prepared for the ultimate conflict, only to discover that man's second worst fear was realized‚Äîthat humanity is all alone in the universe; the Hedoth homeworlds were vacant. The Hedoth initially left no clue of where they went, but their departure was remarkably tidy. Scattered installations and miscellaneous war machines were all they left behind. The discovery set off a frenzied \\"gold rush\\" among the three CorpoNations for the Hedoth technology and its potential power. At the end of the game, the Hedoth revealed that the humans were merely being tested, to see if they were worthy of being soldiers in the Hedoth's armies. The Hedoth concluded that humans would make excellent soldiers in the Hedoth armies, and that \\"Humanity is ready to learn obedience.\\" ==Gameplay== The game is fully 3D, mapped by an invisible grid; vehicles tilt to meet hilly terrain, and projectiles can be realistically blocked by obstructions. The camera is free-moving and can zoom in and out, rotate, and pan up or down while navigating the battlefield. In the game, the usual real-time strategy elements such as base building and resource gathering are followed, but Metal Fatigue differs from the other titles by offering players to do battle with giant high-tech mech-style juggernauts called Combots. Combots can be customized by four main combot parts: a torso, a single pair of legs, and two separate pieces of arm (excluding the combot pilots). The game also allows players to salvage destroyed enemy Combots and their various parts. Salvaged parts can be grafted onto the player's own combots (either by a combot in the field, or brought back and built into a new one,) and, more importantly, they can be researched and reverse-engineered, adding the component into the player's technology base. In-game, units are unable to increase in rank through experience. However, after a completion of a single-player mission, the player is given points that could be used to upgrade combot pilots, vehicles or structures. The game also places an emphasis on multi-level warfare. The battlefield is divided into three layers of combat: an orbital level, a surface level and an underground level. Combots with flight capabilities are able to traverse at will between the orbital level and the surface level. Only vehicles are able to traverse the underground level, which must be entered from the surface, although a vehicle production facility can be built after an elevator has been built by a drill unit and builder units have been sent down. ==Reception== Gordon Barrick of PC Gaming World wrote, \\"Although it falls between two stools and can be repetitive at times, Metal Fatigue still provides moments of adrenaline-surged fun which outweigh its general faults.\\" ==References== ==External links== * *Metal Fatigue on Metacritic Category:2000 video games Category:Video games about mecha Category:Psygnosis games Category:Real-time strategy video games Category:Science fiction video games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Video games set in the 23rd century Category:Windows games Category:Windows-only games Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games ","title":"Metal Fatigue (video game)"},{"id":"3234143","text":"Vadim Yakovlev was a Russian Cossack cavalry commander, in the rank of yesaul.

The pill was supposed to be a two-staged pill whereby firstly one pill was taken which would enable another pill to be taken a number of days after the first pill which would then be lethal, but would otherwise be non-lethal.

He was also a magazine editor and contributed to a number of radio shows but he is best known for creating a build-it-yourself home computer Galaksija and originating a related \\"Build your own computer Galaksija\\" initiative with Dejan Ristanoviƒá. This initiative encouraged and enlightened thousands of computer enthusiasts during the 1980s in the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Mr. Antoniƒá donated many of his personally creations to the public domain, whenever they related to the common people or a fellow engineer. == Biography == While in school, Voja Antoniƒá found a passion for HAM radios. He obtained a licence and a callsign to broadcast his own waves. One day, the state police seized all CB Band units known to operate in the country, creating a new trend for HAM radio units which bored Voja Antoniƒá who decided to move on towards new digital technologies. His first creation with a microprocessor was Conway's Game of Life machine that shows its state using 16x16 matrix of red LEDs. Without a computer, Voja Antoniƒá wrote the code on paper and operated the input in the system byte by byte using rotary switches. LEDs being expensive back then, it took him months to buy and install the last LEDs. A replica of his machine reportedly worked flawlessly almost continuously for 40 years. When personal computers arrived on the market, they were not accessible in Yugoslavia. Voja Antoniƒá asked a friend in the USA to disassemble a TRS-80 Model I and send it to him and received it labelled as \\"technical junk\\". He received it, reassembled it, and started his new computer passion. While studying at the Faculty of Dramatic Arts in the late 1970s, he started to build computer systems capable of rendering animations. Prior to the Winter of 1981/1982 Skiing Federation of Serbia timed the competitors using regular stopwatches and hand signaling. The upcoming Balkan competition required this to be improved and more precise. In 1981, Antoniƒá created a small, battery powered computer packed together with liquid crystal display, printer and keyboard in Samsonite suitcases. Over the years five different models were built, named from \\"Arbitar\\" to \\"Arbitar 5\\", and were used for many years. In 1982, he designed an alarm system for Elektronika in≈æenjering. In 1983, Antoniƒá learned of the interesting way to have the CPU generate video signal, without the use of specialized video circuitry. He thought of this as a good idea for an inexpensive, build-it-yourself computer. Galaksija (pronounced Galaxiya, meaning Galaxy) was featured in the special edition Raƒçunari u va≈°oj kuƒái (Computers in your home) of a popular science magazine of the same name, published late December 1983 in Belgrade, Yugoslavia. Voja Antoniƒá essentially released Galaksija to public domain and never required any compensation for it. He wanted it to be a project anyone can undertake and received only the compensation for writing the magazine article itself, not the computer. At least 8,000 were built by do-it-yourself computer hackers. In 1983, his friend Zoran Modli launched a new section on his national radio show focused on microcomputers. Since data coding was performed in audio range (to fit the format of compact cassettes), Voja Antoniƒá and his radio host friend started using the radio waves to transfer computer-generated data, their own online wireless technology of the predigital age. In 1991, when the war broke in Yugoslavia, Voja Antoniƒá was taken to a remote quarter to be checked by the military. Confessing he was a computer engineer, he was asked to repair an old Apple II, which he did in a day. This earned him the favors of the military forces. During this period, he joined several anti-war and anti-Milo≈°eviƒá campaigns, writing articles against terror. In 1995, while going through a difficult time in his life, he threw away almost all of his projects, including the documentation and five prototypes of the Galaksija microcomputer. In 1999, Voja Antoniƒá created a logic analyzer, probe, serial interface receiver and frequency counter device based on Microchip Technology PIC16F84 microcontroller. It eventually became Microchip's Application Note 689 (AN689) but was subsequently removed. Microchip explained that Yugoslavia was facing an embargo from the USA, making it impossible to promote his technology worldwide. Although the work was published, the only compensation asked by Voja Antoniƒá, a Microchip in-circuit emulator MPLAB-ICE 1000, was never sent to Antoniƒá. In 2006, Microchip restored the Application Note 689 and delivered a In-Circuit Debuggers to Voja Antoniƒá. He donated a copy of the Galaksija to the Muzej Nauke i Tehnike (Museum of Science and Technology) in Belgrade. ==Publications== ;Print books * Do Nonexistent Things Exist: A Guide to Critical Thinking (\\"Da li postoje stvari koje ne postoje ‚Äì vodiƒç za kritiƒçko razmi≈°ljanje\\") * Non-Prophecy from Kremna: A Study of Deception (\\"Kremansko neproroƒçanstvo: studija jedne obmane\\") ;Online books * Patents that Won't Change the World (only available in Serbian, free online) ;Short stories Voja Antoniƒá wrote a number of short stories for his appearances in \\"Modulacije\\" (eng.

A pantsuit or pant suit, also known as a trouser suit outside the United States, is a woman's suit of clothing consisting of pants and a matching or coordinating coat or jacket. Formerly, the prevailing fashion for women included some form of a coat, paired with a skirt or dress‚Äîhence the name pantsuit. ==History== Young woman modelling a short pantsuit, Brisbane, 1952 The model wears a short-sleeved, collared blouse with front patch pockets, teamed with a pair of high-waisted, tailored shorts with slit pockets. She also wears a cloth hat and a pair of high-ankled sandals. This style is typical of the post-war period in women's clothing, when menswear style shirts, shorts and pants became popular in women's fashion. The pantsuit was introduced in the 1920s, when a small number of women adopted a masculine style, including pantsuits, hats, canes and monocles. However, the term, \\"trouser suit\\" had been used in Britain during the First World War, with reference to women working in heavy industry.Henrietta Heald, 'For England's Sake', History Today, October 2014, page 33 During the 1960s pant suits for women became increasingly widespread. Designers such as Foale and Tuffin in London and Luba Marks in the United States were early promoters of trouser suits. In 1966 Yves Saint-Laurent introduced his Le Smoking, an evening pantsuit for women that mimicked a man's tuxedo.Alexander, Hilary. \\"Smoke Without Fire.\\" The Telegraph (Dec. 12, 2005). Whilst Saint-Laurent is often credited with introducing trouser suits, it was noted in 1968 that some of his pantsuits were very similar to designs that had already been offered by Luba Marks, and the London designer Ossie Clark had offered a trouser suit for women in 1964 that predated Saint Laurent's 'Le Smoking' design by two years. In Britain a social watershed was crossed in 1967 when Lady Chichester, wife of the navigator Sir Francis Chichester, wore a trouser suit when her husband was publicly knighted by Queen Elizabeth II. Pantsuits were often deprecated as inappropriately masculine clothing for women. For example, until 1993, women were not permitted to wear pantsuits (or pants of any kind) on the United States Senate floor.Robin Givhan (20 July 2007) \\"Hillary Clinton's Tentative Dip Into New Neckline Territory\\" Washington Post In 1993, Senators Barbara Mikulski and Carol Moseley Braun wore pants onto the floor in defiance of the rule, and female support staff followed soon after, with the rule being amended later that year by Senate Sergeant-at-Arms Martha Pope to allow women to wear pants on the floor so long as they also wore a jacket, thus allowing pantsuits, among other types of clothing. Hillary Clinton, who is well known for wearing pantsuits, once referred to her presidential campaign staff as \\"The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pantsuits\\" (in her August 26, 2008 speech at the Democratic National Convention), a play on The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants. During the 2016 Presidential election, the pantsuit became a symbolic rallying cry among supporters of Hillary Clinton, many of whom donned pantsuits when they went to the polls to cast their ballots. This was in part due to the influence of a Facebook group of 2.9 million Hillary Clinton supporters called Pantsuit Nation. ==See also== * Business wear * Women and trousers ==References== ==External links== Category:Suits (clothing) Category:History of clothing (Western fashion) Category:Hillary Clinton Category:1920s introductions ","title":"Pantsuit"},{"id":"3234207","text":"La Muerte Viva! is The Bronx's second EP and the first recording on Wichita Records, released on November 15, 2003.

As of 2017, New Orleans had an estimated population of 393,292, a decrease in population from the 445,000 residents of the city prior to Hurricane Katrina. ==Pre-Katrina decrease in population== Prior to Hurricane Katrina, New Orleans had experienced a decrease in population of 18% (109,000 residents) between 1970 and 2000, and which fell by a further 6% (30,000 residents) from 2000 to 2005. ==Diaspora destinations== In the initial period following Hurricane Katrina, there were several useful sources of data about where displaced residents from New Orleans were living. In particular, information on the location of refugees was available from change-of-address forms filed with the U.S. Postal Service and from registrations with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) for aid. Analyses of these data showed that nearly 15% of evacuees from New Orleans relocated to distant cities in the East Coast, Midwest, and West Coast. The main destinations for displaced residents were suburban New Orleans, Houston, Dallas, Atlanta, and Baton Rouge. ==Demographics== As of 2008, just over half of the city‚Äôs adult residents (56 percent) were African American, roughly one in three (35 percent) were white, and 5 percent were Hispanic. This is roughly equivalent to the shape of the population in a 2006 survey, fielded one year after Katrina. It is also fairly similar to the city‚Äôs pre-storm distribution as measured by the Census Bureau‚Äôs 2005 American Community Survey (ACS), which found that the adult population was 60 percent African American and 32 percent Caucasian. ==Human rights== In the aftermath of the devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina, the issue of human rights was studied closely. The UN Human Rights Committee issued a 2006 report recommending that the United States endeavor to make certain the rights of poor and black Americans \\"are fully taken into consideration in the reconstruction plans with regard to access to housing, education and health care\\".26\\\\. The Committee, while taking note of the various rules and regulations prohibiting discrimination in the provision of disaster relief and emergency assistance, remains concerned about information that poor people and in particular African-Americans, were disadvantaged by the rescue and evacuation plans implemented when Hurricane Katrina hit the United States of America, and continue to be disadvantaged under the reconstruction plans. (articles 6 and 26) The State party should review its practices and policies to ensure the full implementation of its obligation to protect life and of the prohibition of discrimination, whether direct or indirect, as well as of the United Nations Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement, in the areas of disaster prevention and preparedness, emergency assistance and relief measures. In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, it should increase its efforts to ensure that the rights of poor people and in particular African- Americans, are fully taken into consideration in the reconstruction plans with regard to access to housing, education and healthcare. The Committee wishes to be informed about the results of the inquiries into the alleged failure to evacuate prisoners at the Parish prison, as well as the allegations that New Orleans residents were not permitted by law enforcement officials to cross the Greater New Orleans Bridge to Gretna, Louisiana. See: The American Civil Liberties Union and the National Prison Project also documented mistreatment of the prison population during the flooding. See also: In 2008, the Institute for Southern Studies, a nonpartisan research center, published a report on \\"Hurricane Katrina and the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement\\". The study was one of five published by the ISS on the consequences of Hurricane Katrina, and was a collaborative work produced along with the Brookings-Bern Project on Internal Displacement, co-directed by Walter K√§lin, the Representative of the UN Secretary-General on the Human Rights of Internally Displaced Persons. The report found that the U.S. government neglected to adhere to \\"internationally recognized human rights principles the Bush administration has promoted in other countries.\\" See also: From May to June 2008, United Nations Special Rapporteur Doudou Di√®ne was invited by the U.S. government to visit and study racial discrimination in the U.S. Di√®ne's 2008 report was delivered to the United Nations Human Rights Council and was published in 2009. ==Housing== Housing, particularly for the poor, has been a contentious issue. In 2002, the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) took over the Housing Authority of New Orleans (HANO), and planned shortly thereafter to redevelop half of the city's public housing complexes, which plan was instituted with urgency after Katrina struck the city. The plan has been met with controversy, with protests after the government decided to replace 4,500 units of housing with a mixed-use development that has 744 public housing units in C.J. Peete, B.W.

It was widely used from the 16th until the mid-18th century (Scotland) or the mid-20th century (Ireland) but is now rarely used. Sometimes, all Gaelic typefaces are called Celtic or uncial although most Gaelic types are not uncials. The \\"Anglo-Saxon\\" types of the 17th century are included in this category because both the Anglo-Saxon types and the Gaelic/Irish types derive from the insular manuscript hand. The terms Gaelic type, Gaelic script and Irish character translate the Irish phrase (). In Ireland, the term is used in opposition to the term , Roman type. The Scottish Gaelic term is (). (‚Äì1770) was one of the last Scottish writers with the ability to write in this script, but his main work, , was published in the Roman script. ==Characteristics== Overview of some Gaelic typefaces Besides the 26 letters of the Latin alphabet, Gaelic typefaces must include all vowels with acute accents as well as a set of consonants with dot above , and the Tironian sign et , used for 'and' in Irish. Gaelic typefaces also often include insular forms: of the letters and , and some of the typefaces contain a number of ligatures used in earlier Gaelic typography and deriving from the manuscript tradition. Lower- case is drawn without a dot (though it is not the Turkish dotless ), and the letters have insular shapes . Many modern Gaelic typefaces include Gaelic letterforms for the letters , and typically provide support for at least the vowels of the other Celtic languages. They also distinguish between and (as did traditional typography), though some modern fonts replace the ampersand with the Tironian note ostensibly because both mean 'and'. ==Origin== The word in the Gaelic-script font of the same name. The Irish uncial alphabet originated in medieval manuscripts as an \\"insular\\" variant of the Latin alphabet. The first Gaelic typeface was designed in 1571 for a catechism commissioned by Elizabeth I to help attempt to convert the Irish Catholic population to Anglicanism. ==Use== Typesetting in Gaelic script remained common in Ireland until the mid-20th century. Gaelic script is today used merely for decorative typesetting; for example, a number of traditional Irish newspapers still print their name in Gaelic script on the first page, and it is also popular for pub signs, greeting cards, and display advertising. Edward Lhuyd's grammar of the Cornish language used Gaelic-script consonants to indicate sounds like and . In 1996 created a new corporate logo. The logo consists of a modern take on the Gaelic type face. The R's counter is large with a short tail, the T is roman script while the E is curved but does not have a counter like a lower case E, and the letters also have slight serifs to them. TG4's original logo, under the brand , also used a modernization of the font, the use of the curved T and a sans-serif A in the word . Other Irish companies that have used Gaelic script in their logos including the GAA, and . The uses Gaelic Script on its official seal. The GAA logo uses the script to incorporate both the English language GAA acronym and the Irish language acronym (). The logo more strongly shows the more widely used acronym GAA but taking a closer look a C joins with an L and then to a G lying down. ==In Unicode== Unicode treats the Gaelic script as a font variant of the Latin alphabet. A lowercase insular g (·µπ) was added in version 4.1 as part of the Phonetic Extensions block because of its use in Irish linguistics as a phonetic character for . Unicode 5.1 (2008) added a capital G (ÍùΩ) and both capital and lowercase letters D, F, R, S, T, besides \\"turned insular G\\", on the basis that Edward Lhuyd used these letters in his 1707 work as a scientific orthography for Cornish. * Íùπ Íù∫ Insular D (U+A779, U+A77A) * ‚óå·∑ò Combining Small Insular D (U+1DD8) (Used for Old Norse) * Íùª Íùº Insular F (U+A77B, U+A77C) * ÍùΩ ·µπ Insular G (U+A77D, U+1D79) * Íùæ Íùø Turned insular G (U+A77E, U+A77F) * ÍûÇ ÍûÉ Insular R (U+A782, U+A783) * ÍûÑ ÍûÖ Insular S (U+A784, U+A785) * ÍûÜ Íûá Insular T (U+A786, U+A787) ==Samples== (digital font 1993, based on Monotype Series 24 A, 1906) (digital font 1993, based on drawings of Book of Kells lettering by Arthur Baker.)

J. MacHale. ==Plot introduction== This story takes place mainly on a territory called Zadaa. There will be two main tribes here: The Rokador and the Batu. The Rokador live in tunnels and are fair-skinned, while the Batu are dark- skinned and live in a sunbathed city called Xhaxhu in the desert. For years, the Rokador have relied on the Batu to protect them from other savage tribes on Zadaa, and the Batu have relied on the Rokador to provide them with water. But the Rokador seem to be holding back the water, causing all the Batu to starve. ==Plot summary== As in the other Pendragon books, this book covers Bobby's adventures and those of Mark and Courtney, his friends on Second Earth. Bobby's adventures are chronicled as an epistolary novel and those of his friends in the third-person narrative. ===Zadaa=== The story starts after Bobby Pendragon has spoken with Loor, who explains to him, the lead Traveler and main character, the situation on Zadaa, introduces Bobby to her sister and her acolyte Saangi and her friends, Bokka and Teek. Soon afterwards, Saint Dane, who is disguised as a Batu warrior, beats Bobby up with a wooden staff. Bobby is almost killed but is rescued by Pelle a Zinj, the kind prince, and recovers quickly in a Batu hospital. After Bobby has recovered, he decides to start training to be a warrior. Alder, the Traveler from Denduron, joins Loor and Saangi to help train him. For 3 weeks, Bobby works hard in a deserted training camp. Finally, at the end of the 3 weeks, they all celebrate his successful training but are interrupted by an attack by a group of Rokador, who shoots Bokka with several arrows and flees. As Bokka dies, he gives Bobby and Loor a map to the underground city Kidik, and tell them that Saint Dane is there. Loor and Bobby decide to attend the Batu Festival of Azhra first, because Pelle a Zinj has invited them personally. At the festival, Pelle a Zinj is killed by a Rokador. After this, it rains, but still there is no ready supply water for the Batu. This convinces the Batu that the Rokador are indeed holding back the water and they start making preparations for war. Meanwhile, Bobby and Loor begin their journey to the city of Kidik. There, they find an underground ocean of fresh water. They take a boat across this, arriving on an island where Saint Dane finds them and puts them in a prison-like room. Bobby and Loor later escape and learn that after an epidemic virus had killed most of the Rokador, Saint Dane was able to convince the survivors to attack the Batu. The plan was to hold back the water, making the Batu starve; when the Batu attacked, the Rokador would flood the entire village, drowning all. Saangi and Alder join Bobby and Loor. As the Rokador prepare to flood the underground, the protagonists foil their plans by flooding it prematurely, presumably to the ruin of both tribes. Rather than abandon one another, warriors of both tribes co-operate to escape the flood. The heroes escape from the floods by riding a \\"dygo\\", the machine that the Rokador use for making tunnels. All the water shoots out from the underground and creates a river which flows by the city of Xhaxhu, providing water for both people. Bobby then returns to Loor's house, where he attempts to share a kiss with her. She refuses him, arguing that to become lovebirds would distract them from their purpose of preventing the destruction of Halla. Bobby accepts this without complaint. Bobby goes back to the flume to try to return to Second Earth (Earth in modern-times), whereupon Saint Dane comes out of the flume in a fury and kills Loor with a sword. He then tries to kill Bobby, but Bobby uses his training to disarm him. Bobby then raises the same sword that killed Loor as Saint Dane jumped on top of him, impaling him in a way that should have killed him. However, Saint Dane disappears and reappears at the entrance to the flume, proving the suggestion given in earlier books that he cannot be killed. Saint Dane then travels to a territory called Quillan. Bobby goes back to Loor. His own desire that she lives rather than dies appears to resurrect or revive her, in that her wound closes of its own accord while she resumes full faculty, memory, and mobility. Moments later, Bobby gets a message from Quillan from people named Veego and LaBerge; to investigate this, he embarks for Quillan. The final journal ends with him writing his record in what is revealed to be the residence of those who sent him the message. ===Second Earth=== The story begins when Mark and Courtney have realized that they have accidentally destroyed the flume to Eelong trying to help Bobby. Courtney therefore becomes severely depressed and stops coming to school. Eventually she decides to go to summer school for six weeks in order to recover, so that Mark is left to read Bobby's journals alone. Throughout the summer, Mark collects Bobby's journals and reads them, and begins to have conversations with Andy Mitchell, the former school bully. Mark soon realizes that Mitchell is an adept in mathematics and became a bully for having been a misfit. Gradually Mark and Mitchell become friends. At her summer school, Courtney meets a boy named Whitney Wilcox, whom she befriends and of whom she begins to entertain romantic thoughts. Before long, he invites her out for pizza. En route, she is struck down by a black car which seems to have been following her. From the car emerges Whitney, who is here revealed to be Saint Dane. Looking upon Courtney, he remarks cryptically \\"I give, and I take away\\" and departs in the form of a raven. As Courtney loses consciousness as a result of her injuries, she sends a cellphone message to Mark, who upon inferring that she is in danger convinces Andy Mitchell to drive him to Courtney's summer school. There they find Courtney, badly injured and unconscious. They call the local ambulance and hurry Courtney to the hospital. Courtney slowly begins to recover. In the last scene of the book, Courtney's heart rate suddenly begins to slow, whereupon Andy Mitchell, unseen, brings it to normal by a means, implied, to be the same kind of \\"thing\\" used by Bobby to revive Loor. This suggests that Andy Mitchell is another alter-ego assumed by Saint Dane. ==Characters in \\"The Rivers of Zadaa\\"== *Bobby Pendragon: A teenage boy who used to live a normal life until his uncle took him through time and space to a \\"territory\\" called Denduron, where he stopped an evil man named Saint Dane from causing chaos and destruction. Since then, he has been to many other worlds, battling Saint Dane. In this book, he goes to Zadaa. *Saint Dane: An evil human-like \\"demon\\" who wants to send Halla (everything/everybody that ever existed and everything/everybody that will ever exist) into chaos, then he will rebuild it in his image. He is able to change shape, making his discovery difficult. *Loor: The Traveler from Zadaa, Bobby's friend. Loor is a Batu warrior, living according to a strict discipline. Bobby has admitted to desiring her love, and she has admitted to reciprocating his feelings. Bobby has also admitted that Loor was hot after seeing her in Zadaa festival clothing. They have agreed to set their love aside to fulfill their mission. *Saangi: Loor's acolyte; also her sister. Not related by blood. She took her job very seriously. *Pelle a Zinj: A Batu prince from Zadaa who is very kind but who is assassinated by a Rokador during an important Batu ceremony. Pelle wanted peace between the Rokador and the Batu tribes. He is killed by a Rokador that Saint Dane probably sent. *Bokka: A Rokador, who has known Loor since she was born and is one of her closest friends. He is described as handsome. Had it not been for Loor's being a Traveler, she and Bokka would have most likely ended up together. He is killed by Rokador assassins with a shot of an arrow straight through the chest. *Teek: Bokka's best friend, also a Rokador. *Alder: The Traveler from Denduron. Alder comes to Zadaa to help Bobby train to be a warrior. *Mark Dimond: Bobby's best friend from Second Earth and also one of Bobby's acolytes. *Courtney Chetwynde: Bobby's girlfriend from Second Earth and also one of Bobby's acolytes.

Its plot involves a magical war between a group of white magicians, led by Simon Iff, and a group of black magicians, over an unborn child. It was first published by Mandrake Press in 1929 and its recent edition is published by Weiser. In this work, numerous acquaintances of Crowley appear as thinly disguised fictional characters. Crowley portrays MacGregor Mathers as the primary villain, including him as a character named SRMD, using the abbreviation of Mathers' magical name. Arthur Edward Waite appears as a villain named Arthwaite, and the unseen head of the Inner Circle of which SRMD was a member. \\"A.B.\\" is theosophist Annie Besant. Among Crowley's friends and allies Allen Bennett appears as Mahatera Phang, Leila Waddell as Sister Cybele, the dancer Isadora Duncan appears as Lavinia King, and her companion Mary D'Este (mother of Preston Sturges, and who helped Crowley write his magnum opus Magick: Book 4 under her magical name 'Soror Virakam') appears as Lisa la Giuffria. Cyril Grey is Crowley himself, while Simon Iff is either an idealized version of an older and wiser Crowley or his friend Allen Bennett.From notes in author's hand from his library copy ‚Äî Swann Auction Galleries, sale 2140, April 3, 2008, lot 45. ==Plot summary== A year or so before the beginning of World War I, a young woman named Lisa la Giuffria is seduced by a white magician, Cyril Grey, and persuaded into helping him in a magical battle with a black magician and his black lodge. Grey is attempting to save and improve the human race and condition by impregnating the girl with the soul of an ethereal being ‚Äî the moonchild. To achieve this, she will have to be kept in a secluded environment, and many preparatory magical rituals will be carried out. The black magician Douglas is bent on destroying Grey's plan. However, Grey's ultimate motives may not be what they appear. The moonchild rituals are carried out in southern Italy, but the occult organizations are based in Paris and England. At the end of the book, the war breaks out, and the white magicians support the Allies, while the black magicians support the Central Powers. ==Critical reception== On October 25, 1929, the Aberdeen Press commented on Moonchild: ==Related writings== Crowley also wrote a number of short stories where the character Simon Iff investigates various crimes and mysteries.Collected in The Simon Iff Stories and Other Works (Wordsworth Editions, 2012), . ==See also== *Works of Aleister Crowley ==Notes== ==External links== *Moonchild (Liber 81-The Butterfly Net) the complete text of the book.

It was reported in 1991. ==Polymer== Advantages of this polymer are optical transparency in its conducting state, high stability and moderate band gap and low redox potential. A large disadvantage is poor solubility, which is partly circumvented in the PEDOT:PSS composite, and the PEDOT-TMA material. Applications of PEDOT include electrochromic displays, antistatics, photovoltaics, electroluminescent displays, printed wiring, sensors, and potentially interfacing electronic hardware with human tissue. The polymer is generated by oxidation. This process begins with production of the radical cation of EDOT monomer, [C2H4O2C4H2S]+. This cation attacks a neutral EDOT followed by deprotonation.

In a clearing in a forest, Ivan has set his horse free. His wagon contains things that are supposed to be driven home for his family, but he empties the wagon so as to place the pots around the freezing tree stumps and to throw out the grain for the birds to eat. When his parents and brothers find him and reprimand him for his foolish slackness, they tell him that he cannot eat dinner with them. Tableau II. Within the forest, Ivan has gathered many mushrooms. His brothers enter and inform him that the Tsar is going to give a feast. His daughter, the Tsarevna, is Elena. The man who manages to get her kerchief and bring it to the feast will win her hand in marriage. When his brothers leave, Ivan is intent on going to the feast, but realizes that his clothes are not suitable, so he calls his horse, who magically provides him with proper new clothes. Tableau III. Inside the Tsar's palace, the skomorkhi and the courtiers amuse themselves. Elena's kerchief having been taken, she wishes to know where her mysterious bridegroom can be. She notices that Ivan is hiding behind a stove, and that he has the kerchief, whereupon the Tsar welcomes his new son-in-law. Realizing who the bridegroom is, Ivan's brothers at first consider escaping, but instead approach him and reconcile, as the courtiers praise Ivan, the Tsar, and his daughter. ==Bibliography== *Cui, C√©sar. –ò–≤–∞–Ω—É—à–∫–∞-–¥—É—Ä–∞—á–µ–∫: –æ–ø–µ—Ä–∞ —Å–∫–∞–∑–∫–∞ –¥–ª—è –¥–µ—Ç–µ–π –≤ —Ç—Ä–µ—Ö –∫–∞—Ä—Ç–∏–Ω–∞—Ö [Ivan the Fool: an opera-fairytale for children in three tableaux].

He then walks outside and wakes the sun by kicking on a mountain in the foreground. Then he proceeds to walk through the forest, changing appearances every time he passes a tree. His mood improves as he walks through the forest. He then finds a squirrel holding acorns and demands to see a license for them. When the squirrel doesn't produce one, Ranger Smith confiscates the nuts. The squirrel's children then poke their heads from the door. Ranger Smith notices this and demands to see a marriage license. When the squirrel can't produce one Ranger Smith decides to write a ticket but to \\"let him off easy\\" this time. He demands that the squirrel store pickles for the winter and may only keep one child. The scene then changes to Yogi Bear and Boo Boo Bear's cave. The two bears are showering while Ranger Smith watches them, taking notes. The scene suddenly changes to night with Ranger Smith on his hands and knees holding a flash light to his face. He then says that it is \\"Owl Feeding Time\\" and that what he has to do is not for civilian eyes. The screen cuts to black and strange sound effects are played. When the scene cuts back Ranger Smith is now standing; he looks as if he were beaten. He then proceeds to go back to his cabin.

They went to a second round, and were won by Val√©ry Giscard d'Estaing by a margin of 1.6%. It is to date the closest presidential election in French history. ==Campaign== In 1969, Georges Pompidou, formerly Prime Minister under the presidency of Charles de Gaulle, was elected President of France for a seven-year term. However, he died in office on 2 April 1974, and the French voters were called to elect his successor. The political classes were caught unawares by Pompidou's death. On the Left, the Socialist Party (PS), the French Communist Party (PCF), and the Movement of Left Radicals (MRG) campaigned for the Programme commun that they agreed in 1972. Whilst the PCF was the main force of this coalition (at least in terms of popular support), they united behind the candidacy of the PS leader Fran√ßois Mitterrand. Indeed, they thought the \\"Union of Left\\" could not win if it was led by a Communist in the presidential race. The fear of communism was often an argument used by the French Right to win elections. Furthermore, Mitterrand had succeeded in forcing an unexpected second ballot when he was candidate in 1965 against General De Gaulle. Only two smaller Trotskyist parties refused to support Mitterrand and the Common Program, as well as the Social Democratic Party founded by a split of Socialist elects who disapproved the alliance with the PCF. For the first time since the beginning of the Fifth Republic in 1958, the Left had a serious chance of victory. The situation in the \\"Presidential Majority\\" was very confused: no \\"natural candidate\\" had appeared. Prime Minister Pierre Messmer had announced he would run if he was the only candidate of the majority. This condition being not satisfied, he withdrew. Four men declared their will to run: former Gaullist Prime Minister Jacques Chaban-Delmas, the Chairman of the National Assembly Edgar Faure, the former Craftsmen and Shopkeepers Minister representing the ultra-conservative wing of the Gaullist Party Jean Royer, and finally the Economy Minister and leader of the Independent Republicans Val√©ry Giscard d'Estaing. Quickly, Faure withdrew and the real competition on the Right was between Chaban-Delmas and Giscard d'Estaing. Chaban-Delmas conveyed an image of being a reformist Gaullist and invoked his proposals for a \\"New Society\\", which he had tried to apply when he led the cabinet (from 1969 to 1972), but he was supported by the \\"Barons of Gaullism\\" who held the bulk of ministerial offices for 16 years. His challengers denounced the continuation of the UDR- state, that is to say the appropriation of the state by the Gaullist Party. Giscard d'Estaing portrayed himself as \\"the change in the continuity\\", a \\"modern turn\\" for the French politics, in the incumbent majority and more reassuring for moderate voters than the Common Program which was characterised as a collectivist project. He benefited from the divisions in the UDR. Indeed, 43 Gaullist personalities close to Pompidou and led by the young Interior Minister Jacques Chirac published an appeal insinuating that Giscard d'Estaing was more likely than Chaban-Delmas to defeat Mitterrand. As a result, the left-wing candidate faced the leader of the Independent Republicans in a very competitive run-off. For the first time in the history of the French presidential elections, a Radio-TV-debate between the two finalists was organized. Mitterrand presented his competitor as the representing of the elites who pursued unfair policies, while Giscard d'Estaing criticized his opponent to be \\"a man of the past\\". The turnout reached a record and Giscard d'Estaing was elected with a margin of only 424 599 votes. He nominated Chirac as Prime Minister. ==Result== thumbright250pxResults of the first round by department ==See also== * President of France * Politics of France == Further reading== * Bell, David.

Examples include National Weather Service (NWS) co-op observers and Skywarn storm spotters. == Storm spotters == A storm spotter is a specific type of weather spotter. In the U.S., these volunteers are usually trained by the National Weather Service or local Skywarn group, and are given a phone number, internet outlet, or amateur radio frequency to report to if a severe weather event, such as a tornado, severe thunderstorm, or flash flood occurs where the spotter is located. They add ground truth information to remote sensing technology such as weather radar. Canwarn is the national storm spotting program of Canada, Skywarn Europe covers about a dozen countries (including the U.K., which is also covered by TORRO), and Australia also has a program organized by the Bureau of Meteorology. == National Weather Service Coop Observers == The National Weather Service Cooperative Observer Program (COOP) is a network of 11,000 volunteers that record official weather observations across the United States. Data is taken from a multitude of geographic regions and topography, and sent to the National Weather Service and National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) for official records.NWS Cooperative Observer Program In making these reports, observers use a specialized set of jargon and slang to describe their observations.NOAA Technical Memorandum NWS SR-145 A COMPREHENSIVE GLOSSARY OF WEATHER TERMS FOR STORM SPOTTERS NOAA/NWS/WFO Norman Cooperative weather observers often double as storm spotters. Some are also river and coastal watchers, typically reporting gauge readings. == Media weather spotters == Since New England experiences harsh winters, several regional television stations use weather spotters for up-to- date snowfall amounts and reports. WHDH-TV's network, launched by former meteorologist Todd Gross, is the largest in New England with close to 300 spotters. The former name of the group was \\"WHDHwx - The 7NEWS Weather Spotter Group.\\" In December 2005, the group's name was switched to \\"NEWeather - Todd Gross' Weather Spotter Network\\", in light of Todd Gross' departure with Channel 7. Al Kaprielian, former meteorologist for WNDS/WZMY-TV/WBIN-TV (now WWJE-DT), started his weather watcher group in 1986, when WNDS-TV first went on the air. Kaprielian featured one weather watcher per night on \\"my TV Prime,\\" with their name, town, and current temperature on the map. Other Boston-area stations with weather spotter networks include WBZ-TV, WCVB-TV, and WMUR-TV in Manchester, New Hampshire. Media weather spotters are also extensive in the Midwest; though they also report severe warm weather, such as large hail and heavy rain. WFIE in Evansville, IN, for example, has a massive network of over 100 spotters. In the Great Plains and Southern US, many stations hire or contract storm chasers to send severe thunderstorm and tornado imagery to their viewers and listeners. Some TV stations fly helicopters to record such weather. == Aviation == Accurate and timely weather information is crucial to safe flying operations. Large airports retain a staff of trained weather observers. Previously, many airports had such observers but automated systems replaced humans at most airports and airfields. The military, especially air forces and navies, also maintains such observers. ==See also== * Citizen Weather Observer Program (CWOP) * Climatological observers link * NOAA Hurricane Hunters * 53d Weather Reconnaissance Squadron == References == == External links == * National Weather Service Coop program Category:Meteorological data and networks ","title":"Weather spotting"},{"id":"3234362","text":"Ivan‚Äôs Hundred () was the first Ruthenian guild, which existed in the 12th-15th centuries in Novgorod.

Meketaten (\\"Behold the Aten\\" or \\"Protected by Aten\\") was the second daughter of six born to the Egyptian Pharaoh Akhenaten and his Great Royal Wife Nefertiti. She was probably born in year 4 of Akhenaten's reign. Although little is known about her, she is frequently depicted with her sisters accompanying her royal parents in the first two thirds of Akhenaten's reign. ==Family== Meketaten was the second daughter born to Akhenaten and Nefertiti. She had an older sister named Meritaten and four younger sisters named Ankhesenpaaten, Neferneferuaten Tasherit, Neferneferure and Setepenre. Tutankhaten was a half-brother.Dodson, Aidan and Hilton, Dyan. The Complete Royal Families of Ancient Egypt.

Meketaten appears behind her older sister Meritaten in some of the later inscriptions, thought to date to Year 4 or later.Redford, Donald B. Akhenaten: The Heretic King. Princeton University Press. 1987. Further arguments to suggest Meketaten was born in or before Year 4 come from the fact that her figure was added to one of the Boundary Stela recording events in Year 4 and carved in Year 5.Dodson, Aidan, Amarna Sunset: Nefertiti, Tutankhamun, Ay, Horemheb, and the Egyptian Counter- Reformation. The American University in Cairo Press. 2009, Meketaten moved to the new capital city Akhetaten (modern Amarna) with her family when she was still a small child. She is depicted in several of the tombs of the nobles in Amarna. Meketaten is depicted in the tomb of Ay holding a tray of gifts while wrapping one arm around her mother‚Äôs neck. Other monuments mentioning Meketaten include a stela from Heliopolis, a statue base from the Fayoum, and the tombs of Panehesy and Parennefer. Meketaten was depicted with her parents and sisters at the reception of foreign tributes ‚Äì a ceremony dating to year 12 - that can be seen on several scenes in the private tombs in Amarna of high-ranking officials named Huya and High Priest Meryre II. ==Death and burial== Meketaten died in approximately Year 14 of Akhenaten's reign. It is very likely that a plague swept across Egypt between Akhenaten's 12th and 15th regnal years, for many members of the royal family cease to be mentioned again; among them Queen Mother Tiye, Akhenaten's secondary wife Kiya, Meketaten and the two youngest princesses, Neferneferure and Setepenre. Meketaten's death could have resulted either from a plague, or from childbirth. The presence of a royal baby causes many to believe the young princess died in childbirth (in which case the father of the child would most likely be Akhenaten himself), but this cannot be proven. An alternative interpretation suggested by van Dijk is that the child depicted in the scenes is the soul (the ka) of Meketaten. Meketaten under the canopy, on the wall paintings of the Chamber \\\\gamma. In front of her: Akhenaten, Nefertiti, Meritaten, Ankhesenpaaten and Neferneferuaten Tasherit. Three chambers, denoted as Chambers \\\\alpha, \\\\ \\\\beta and \\\\gamma of the Royal Tomb are believed to be used for the burials. Chambers \\\\alpha and \\\\gamma depict very similar scenes: Akhenaten and Nefertiti bend over the inert body of a woman, weeping and gripping each other's arms for support. Nearby a nurse stands with a baby in her arms, accompanied by a fan-bearer, which indicates the baby's royal status. The names in the scene in chamber \\\\alpha have been hacked out. In the chamber \\\\gamma however the hieroglyphs identify the dead young woman as Meketaten. In the same chamber another scene shows Meketaten standing under a canopy which is usually associated with childbirth but can also interpreted as representing the rebirth of the princess. In front of her, amongst courtiers, stand Akhenaten, Nefertiti and their three remaining daughters, Meritaten, Ankhesenpaaten and Neferneferuaten Tasherit. It is possible that chamber \\\\alpha was the burial place of someone other than Meketaten. There may even have been two burials which may have been those of Neferneferure and Setepenre, but this is not certain. Another theory is that one of the scenes depicts Kiya and that the baby is Tutankhamun. However, Jacobus Van Dijk, in a 2009 book in memory of the late William Murnane has demonstrated that this person was actually a symbolic depiction of the death and rebirth of Meketaten now with the god Aten in the afterlife.J. Van Dijk, The Death of Meketaten, in Causing His Name to Live: Studies in Egyptian Epigraphy and History in Memory of William J. Murnane, ed.P. Brand and L.

It involves teaching a new mathematical concept every day and constantly reviewing old concepts. Early editions were deprecated for providing very few opportunities to practice the new material before plunging into a review of all previous material. Newer editions typically split the day's work evenly between practicing the new material and reviewing old material. Its primary strength is in a steady review of all previous material, which is especially important to students who struggle with retaining the math they previously learned. However, it has sometimes been criticized for its heavy emphasis on rote rather than conceptual learning. The Saxon Math 1 to Algebra 1/2 (the equivalent of a Pre-Algebra book) curriculum is designed so that students complete assorted mental math problems, learn a new mathematical concept, practice problems relating to that lesson, and solve a variety of problems. Daily practice problems include relevant questions from the current day's lesson as well as cumulative problems. This daily cycle is interrupted for tests and additional topics. From Algebra 1/2 on, the higher level books remove the mental math problems and incorporate testing more frequently. Saxon Publishers has also published a phonics and spelling curriculum. This curriculum, authored by Lorna Simmons and first published in 2005, follows the same incremental principles as the Saxon Math curriculum. The Saxon math program has a specific set of products to support homeschoolers, including solution keys and ready-made tests, which makes it popular among some homeschool families. It has also been adopted as an alternative to reform mathematics programs in public and private schools. Saxon teaches memorization of algorithms, unlike many reform texts. == Relation to Common Core == In some reviews, such as ones performed by the prominent nonprofit curriculum rating site EdReports.org, Saxon Math is ranked poorly because it is not aligned with the Common Core State Standards Initiative. That initiative, which has been adopted by most U.S. states, is an important factor in determining which curricula are used in public schools in those states. However, Saxon Math continues to be popular among private schools and homeschoolers, many of whom favor its more traditional approach to teaching math. == In popular culture == Saxon math textbooks are visible on a table in the film Last Action Hero. == References == == External links == * Saxon teaching materials, distributed by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Category:Education reform Category:Mathematics education Category:Homeschooling Category:Mathematics education reform Category:Traditional mathematics Category:Alternative education ","title":"Saxon math"},{"id":"3234416","text":"The 3 arrondissements of the Gard department are: # Arrondissement of Al√®s, (subprefecture: Al√®s) with 97 communes.

It was released on 12 July 1991 as the lead single from their debut studio album, Take That & Party (1992). ==Background== The song was written by Gary Barlow and Ray Hedges, and it was produced by Hedges with additional production by Graham Stack. \\"Do What U Like\\" was released on 15 July 1991 as the lead single from Take That's debut album Take That & Party (1992). The single was released on then-manager Nigel Martin-Smith's record label Dance U.K. and distributed by BMG (to which, through RCA Records division, later signed). The song went down in history as the first song of the band that failed to enter any list and also the only single not to be included on the band's second greatest hits compilation, Never Forget ‚Äì The Ultimate Collection (2005). Originally released only on 7\\" and 12\\" vinyl records and as cassette single, it received a CD single reissue in 1992, from their at-time home label RCA Records, only in AustraliaTake That - Do What U Like (1992, Card Sleeve, CD)  Discogs. ==In concert== During the band's early television appearances and outdoor shows, the song was a recurring number to play.

For the \\"Nobody Else\\", and the subsequent \\"Ultimate Tour 2006\\" and \\"Beautiful World Tour 2007\\", the song was never played, because the band members felt that the high energy dance choreography was not possible for them to do.

In the documentary Take That: For the Record, Barlow admits that neither the song nor video were brilliant, but they were important in helping the band getting noticed.

It occurred due to the resignation of President Charles de Gaulle on 28 April 1969. De Gaulle had decided to consult the voters by referendum about regionalisation and the reform of the Senate, and he had announced he would resign if it resulted in a \\"no\\" vote. On 27 April, 53.5% of the voters had voted \\"no\\". In the presidential election, the Gaullist Party (Union of Democrats for the Republic, UDR) was represented by former Prime Minister Georges Pompidou. He was very popular in the conservative electorate due to economic growth when he led the cabinet (from 1962 to 1968) and his role in the settlement of the May 68 crisis and winning the June 1968 legislative campaign. In his presidential campaign, he obtained the support of the Independent Republicans and their leader Val√©ry Giscard d'Estaing, who had voted \\"no\\" in the referendum. The left-wing French Communist Party (PCF) proposed to the French Section of the Workers' International (SFIO, later formed the Socialist Party) to present a candidate with a common programme, but the SFIO refused. The Left was severely divided in this election. The PCF candidate was Jacques Duclos, one of the historical leaders of the party. The mayor of Marseille, Gaston Defferre, was the SFIO candidate and campaigned with Pierre Mend√®s France, who would have become Prime Minister had Defferre been elected to the Presidency. This candidacy was the first ‚Äì and so far, only ‚Äì dual \\"ticket\\" in a French presidential election. But Defferre's campaign was weakened by the decision of centrist interim President Alain Poher to run. As Chairman of the Senate, Poher had led the \\"no\\" campaign in the referendum. The success of the \\"no\\" campaign gave him the legitimacy to run for the Presidency and he rallied a large swathe of centre-right and centre-left voters. Michel Rocard and Alain Krivine stood as candidates expressing the ideas of the May 1968 movements, though the Trotskyist Krivine took a far more radical stance. ==First round== The first round of voting was held on 1 June 1969. Out of a total of 28,774,041 eligible voters, participation in the first round hovered around 78% of the electorate. Pompidou and Poher won the right to compete in the second round by claiming 43.9% and 23.4% of the vote respectively. ==Second round== The second round saw Pompidou facing Poher. None of the left-wing candidates reached the second round, despite a good campaign and the result for Duclos, who scored the best ever result for a Communist in a presidential election. The Socialists supported reluctantly the centrist Chairman of the Senate. The Communists refused to choose and used a slogan which was equivalent to the phrase \\"It's six of one and half a dozen of the other\\" (c'est bonnet blanc et blanc bonnet). The second round was held on 15 June 1969. About 69% of eligible voters participated. Pompidou was elected President of France with a comfortable majority of more than 58%. ==Results== ==References== == Further reading == * * Penniman, Howard. \\"French Elections, 1969.\\" World Affairs 132.2 (1969): 101‚Äì117. online Category:1969 elections in France 1969 ","title":"1969 French presidential election"},{"id":"3234450","text":"Claudia Carawan (born April 19, 1959, Alexandria, Virginia, United States) is an American singer-songwriter and pianist.

He served as a spokesman and advisor to President Adama Barrow from during the 2016 presidential election campaign until March 2017. Sallah co-founded PDOIS in 1986, and was elected as its secretary-general in 1987. He has been a major contributor to Foroyaa, the party's newspaper. He contested elections for the House of Representatives in 1987 and 1992, and was an opposer of the Yahya Jammeh regime. He stood unsuccessfully for the National Assembly in 1997, but was elected in 2002, serving until 2007. During that time, he also served as Minority Leader. Sallah has also served in the Pan-African Parliament, and was the National Alliance for Democracy and Development (NADD)'s candidate for president in the 2006 presidential election, coming third with 6% of the vote. == Early life == Sallah is a wolof, he was born and raised in Serekunda, the Gambia, and was educated in the United States, graduating with a degree in sociology. He returned to the Gambia in 1977 and worked as a social worker in the Social Welfare Department. == Political career == === Jawara era and post- coup === After returning from the United States in the late 1970s, Sallah became involved with the People's Movement for Independence against Neo- Colonialism and Capitalism (PMINCC). It is also believed that he was one of the editors of The Voice of the Future newspaper. Along with other PMINCC members, he was arrested in October 1983 and went on trial in 1984 for his involvement in distributing The Voice. He was acquitted but lost his job as a result of the trial. In 1986, Sallah was one of the founders of the People's Democratic Organisation for Independence and Socialism (PDOIS). He was elected as its secretary-general in August 1987. He also became a major contributor to its newspaper, Foroyaa, which he co-edited with Sidia Jatta. Sallah contested the Serekunda East constituency in the 1987 and 1992 elections for the House of Representatives, but only won around 10% of the vote. Following Yahya Jammeh's coup in 1994, Sallah and other PDOIS leaders adopted a principled stance in response, with Sallah and Jatta both turning down offers to join the Armed Forces Provisional Ruling Council. Both men were detained in August 1994 for publishing an edition of foroyya despite the ban on political activities. They were put on trial, found guilty, and fined, but resumed publication in November 1994 as a non-partisan newspaper. === Parliamentary career, arrest and presidential campaign === Sallah again unsuccessfully contested the Serekunda East constituency in the 1997 election but was elected to the new constituency of Serekunda Central in the 2002 parliamentary election. As the United Democratic Party (UDP) had boycotted the election, the PDOIS, with two seats, emerged as the largest opposition party, and Sallah became the Minority Leader in the National Assembly. He also served as a member of the Pan-African Parliament in this period. In June 2005, he was expelled from the National Assembly along with three other opposition MPs on the grounds of dual party membership. NADD, an opposition alliance that the PDOIS had joined earlier that year, had been registered as a political party, and the Supreme Court of the Gambia ruled that holding dual membership was against the Gambian Constitution. Some criticised the ruling, claiming that it was a move to silence parliamentary opposition as there was nothing in the Constitution that regulated political parties. On 29 September, a by-election was held in Serrekunda Central, in which Sallah was re-elected by a \\"huge\\" margin. On 15 November 2005, he was arrested along with two other opposition leaders on the grounds of subversion, accused of having collaborated with the President of Senegal. The charges, however, were dropped following the intervention of Olusegun Obasanjo, then-President of Nigeria. Sallah was NADD's candidate in the 2006 presidential election, where he came third and won 5.98% of the vote. During the election, the US Embassy described Sallah as \\"known and respected throughout the country and abroad for his constant admonishment of President Jammeh's government for its failure to adhere to the country's constitution and the principles of democracy.\\" They also wrote: \\"A win by Halifa Sallah would almost certainly usher in a new era in Gambian government and politics. Sallah's ideas are consistent with democratic principles and we would expect a Sallah administration to be a reliable friend of the US.\\" === Further arrests, 2016 campaign and Barrow presidency === He lost his seat in the National Assembly in the 2007 parliamentary election to Sainey Jaiteh, a member of the ruling APRC. While not mentioning Sallah by name, Yahya Jammeh made a coded reference to him and Hamat Bah when he expressed his satisfaction at the defeat of \\"the two empty barrels in the National Assembly\\". Sallah blamed the opposition's poor performance in the election on a split in its ranks and said that he intended to retire from politics and concentrate on writing. On 8 March 2009, Sallah was arrested and taken to the central prison, Mile II. The Jammeh regime accused him of spying. However, the charges were dropped against him on 25 March \\"in the interest of peace and justice\\". Sallah was also reportedly detained in June 2009, when he went to visit a group of imprisoned journalists at the National Intelligence Agency. He was held overnight before being released on bail. Before the 2011 Gambian presidential election, Sallah released a statement saying he would not be a candidate because \\"the office of President or Vice President is not of value to [him]\\". In February 2016, it was announced that Sallah would be PDOIS's candidate in the 2016 Gambian presidential election. He later became the spokesperson for Coalition 2016, and following Jammeh's defeat by Adama Barrow in the election, declared that Jammeh would be treated like a \\"rebel leader\\" if he did not relinquish control by 19 January 2017, when his term ended. Sallah remained the coalition spokesperson following Barrow's election. It was rumored that Sallah was being considered for Vice-President by Barrow, but Barrow changed his mind following a meeting with Ousainou Darboe and other UDP members. Sallah subsequently declined the offer of a cabinet position. On 17 February 2017, Sallah was appointed as Special Advisor to the President on Governance (but he never take the role). SMBC News commented that his \\"appointment will bring absolute, total, complete confidence of the Barrow administration.\\" On 24 February 2017, Sallah announced that he would be contesting the 2017 parliamentary election to the National Assembly. Upon submitting his nomination to the Independent Electoral Commission, he said that it would be the duty of the incoming NAMs to build up the National Assembly as an oversight institution. Sallah also resigned from his executive role as an advisor. He stood in the constituency of Serekunda and was duly elected. In August, Sallah called for a debate with Ousainou Darboe, the leader of the United Democratic Party (UDP), over the credibility of Coalition 2016's memorandum of understanding stating that Barrow would only serve for three years, instead of a full five years. In October 2017, Sallah said that the Barrow government was \\"reminiscent of the APRC government days\\" as \\"nothing seems to have improved the living standard of ordinary Gambians.\\" The Office of the President issued a statement in response stating that \\"Comparing this government to the former dictatorial regime is a distortion of facts.\\" Sallah visited Ohio University for three days in February 2018. On 8 March, Sallah met with the Cuban Ambassador to The Gambia, L√°zaro Herrera, in his home. On 16 March, during a heated exchange over a proposed loan from China, Sallah was removed from the National Assembly on the orders of Speaker Mariam Jack-Denton. == Personal life == Sallah was involved in a car accident while touring the country in March 2016 and \\"suffered cuts to his face\\", but his injuries were not life-threatening. Gambia's political scientist, Amat Jeng, writes this about him: \\"Born in Serrekunda and educated in the US, Halifa Sallah returned home in the 1970s during the turbulent days of pan-Africanism and the Cold War, totally appalled at capitalism, neo-colonialism and the racism he saw in the US. Part of the founding fathers of the ‚ÄòRed Star‚Äô, commonly known as the People's Movement for Independence against Neo-Colonialism and Capitalism (PMINCC), Sallah began to espouse social democracy, believing that for a nation to realize its political and social freedoms, the masses have to, first, be free from external and internal oppression and domination, and second, be educated to become masters of state and society. For thirty years, Halifa was popular with the educated few, but failed massively to win the support of the masses, because they never understood his politics.\\"http://thepoint.gm/africa/gambia/article/opinion-sallahism-and-de- jammehnisation-of-gambian-politics ==References== Category:Gambian democracy activists Category:Living people Category:Members of the Pan-African Parliament from the Gambia Category:People from Serekunda Category:People's Democratic Organisation for Independence and Socialism politicians Category:Gambian socialists Category:Leaders of political parties in the Gambia Category:1953 births ","title":"Halifa Sallah"},{"id":"3234494","text":"The 3 arrondissements of the Gers department are: # Arrondissement of Auch, (prefecture of the Gers department: Auch) with 134 communes.

The Entercom-owned station broadcasts a sports radio format. The studios and offices are located on Squibb Road in Mission, Kansas. KCSP is one of the oldest radio stations in the Kansas City metropolitan area, going on the air in 1922, just after KMBZ, and several months before WHB.Broadcasting Yearbook 1977 page C-122 KCSP is a Class B regional station, with a power of 5,000 watts, both the daytime and nighttime, using a non- directional antenna on one tower. The transmitter is off Mission Road in Prairie Village, Kansas. Programming is also heard on the HD2 channel of FM 106.5 WDAF-FM. Local sports shows are heard from mornings to early evenings on weekdays, with programming from Fox Sports Radio airing nights and weekends. Although the station had the slogan \\"The Football Channel\\" when it began in June 2003, it is currently the flagship station of MLB's Kansas City Royals, whose rights were reacquired by Entercom in 2008. The parent company held the rights to the Royals on co-owned KMBZ until 2003. The Kansas State Wildcats radio network is also heard on KCSP. ==History== ===Early Years (1922-1967)=== On February 19, 1922, the Kansas City Star signed on experimental station 9XAB, licensed at 833 kHz, at a time when other newspapers in town were also putting radio stations on the air. Popular Science magazine noted the station in its March 1922 issue for airing weather and market reports at 11:30 a.m. and 2:00 p.m., and concerts in the evening. The station took the call sign WDAF on May 16, 1922. In the early days of radio, the dividing line between stations holding call letters beginning with a \\"W\\" and those with a \\"K\\" was the western border of Kansas, which is why its original call sign began with a \\"W.\\" WDAF bounced around various frequencies, including 750, 730, 680, 820 and 810 kHz. It moved to 610 kHz in 1928, splitting time with station WOQ, before becoming the sole occupant of 610 AM in Kansas City. WDAF became an NBC Radio affiliate just before moving to 610 kHz. It carried programs from both the NBC Red Network and the Blue Network up until 1930, when WDAF became a primary NBC Red affiliate.KCSP (AM) History WDAF increased power to 5,000 watts daytime in 1935, and 5,000 watts nighttime in 1940. In 1949, WDAF signed on a TV station, the second in Missouri and the first in Kansas City. It took the call sign WDAF-TV Channel 4.Broadcasting Yearbook page B-114 Like AM 610, it primarily was an NBC affiliate, although it carried shows from other networks as well; it became a Fox station in 1994. In 1958, the Kansas City Star sold WDAF-AM-TV to National Missouri TV. In 1960, National Missouri TV merged with Transcontinent Television. On March 5, 1961, Transcontinent signed on an FM station at 102.1 MHz, which today is KCKC. Taft Broadcasting merged with Transcontinent in 1965, bringing WDAF-AM-FM-TV under its control. The 610 Sports Radio Mobile Studio at Kauffman Stadium. ===Middle of the Road Music (1967-1977)=== Taft changed WDAF to a full service middle of the road music format on April 30, 1967. WDAF carried news from the ABC American Information Radio Network, mainly owing to the company's very good relationship with its television counterpart. It became a secondary CBS affiliate in 1974, airing programming such as the CBS Radio Mystery Theater. ===61 Country (1977-2003)=== WDAF flipped to country music in February 1977, calling itself \\"61 Country.\\" Although Kansas City had several country stations, WDAF programmed its country music in an uptempo way, as if it were Top 40. Taft Broadcasting owned it until 1987 when a hostile takeover put it under Great American Communications ownership. After a financial restructuring, Great American sold WDAF-TV and became known as Citicasters, owning AM 610 and FM 102.1 until 1997. Entercom took control in October 1997.Broadcasting & Cable Yearbook 1998 page D-256 Despite having as many as three full power FM competitors at various times, WDAF remained the top-rated country station in Kansas City. From 1992 to 1995, WDAF also held the Royals broadcast rights. In 2002, the station picked up the rights to University of Missouri football and basketball. David Lawrence, Phil Young, and Ted Cramer were among the longtime personalities on 61 Country, along with newscasters Charles Gray, Frank Haynes, and Caroline Rooney. ===610 Sports (2003-present)=== In 2003, Entercom announced it would move WDAF to 106.5 on the FM dial. Beginning August 10, 2003, the country programming was simulcast on both frequencies until a new AM sports station was ready. That day came on September 10, 2003, when round-the- clock sports programming debuted and the station became KCSP, standing for Kansas City SPorts. Leading to the premiere, Entercom had swiped Jason Whitlock, Bill Maas and Tim Grunhard from rival sports station WHB, though all three have since moved on. The nationally syndicated Jim Rome show moved to KCSP in December. Kansas Jayhawk sports moved to KCSP in September 2006. Kansas City Royals baseball began airing on KCSP in the 2008 season. In 2011, KCSP beat WHB in the ratings for the first time. In 2012, KCSP dropped the Jim Rome show in favor of expanding its local programming. ==See also== * WDAF-FM * Entercom ==References== ==External links== * Official website * FCC History Cards for KCSP CSP Category:Radio stations established in 1922 Category:Sports radio stations in the United States Category:Taft Broadcasting Category:1922 establishments in Missouri Category:Entercom radio stations Category:Kansas City Royals broadcasters ","title":"KCSP (AM)"},{"id":"3234518","text":"Map of the arrondissements of Guadeloupe.

It had been widely expected that incumbent president Charles de Gaulle would be re-elected, but the election was notable for the unexpectedly strong performance of his left-wing challenger Fran√ßois Mitterrand. ==Background== This was the second presidential election since the beginning of the Fifth Republic. Under the first draft of the 1958 constitution, the president was elected by an electoral college, in order to appease concerns about de Gaulle's allegedly authoritarian or bonapartist tendencies. There had been a historical reluctance in France to have a directly elected president because Louis-Napol√©on Bonaparte (the winner of the 1848 presidential election) had seized power in a coup d'√©tat before the end of his term. However, a direct presidential election had always been essential to de Gaulle's political vision and he had it adopted by referendum in 1962. ==Candidates== % of vote for Charles de Gaulle, first roundWhen the electoral campaign started, the majority of political commentators believed that de Gaulle would succeed in winning reelection in a single round. Many of the leaders of the opposition parties were therefore reluctant to challenge de Gaulle. Furthermore, some potential candidates such as former Prime Minister Pierre Mend√®s-France declined to run due to their opposition to direct presidential elections. Because he was not expecting a significant challenger, de Gaulle announced his candidacy only one month before the first round of voting and did not lead a very active campaign. The centre-left paper L'Express campaigned for the nomination of a candidate of the non-Communist opposition. One potential challenger identified was Gaston Defferre, Mayor of Marseille and an internal opponent of the French Section of the Workers' International (SFIO, socialist party) leader Guy Mollet. In his municipality, Defferre led a coalition composed of the SFIO, the Radical Party, and the centre-right Popular Republican Movement (MRP). Nevertheless, the leaders of these parties refused to support his candidacy. The failure of Defferre's candidacy led to other politicians entering the race. The MRP leader Jean Lecanuet was nominated by his party and the National Centre of Independents and Peasants (CNIP) to represent the centre. He ran a liberal and pro-European campaign, influenced by John F. Kennedy, and criticizing the \\"archaism\\" and the \\"nationalism\\" of de Gaulle in a bid to rally younger and more moderate conservatives. Fran√ßois Mitterrand, a former Fourth Republic minister who did not belong to any party, offered to run as the sole candidate of the left. Mitterrand had been an opponent to de Gaulle since 1958 (like the Communists but contrary to the SFIO leadership) and had written the book The Permanent Coup d'√âtat, strongly criticising de Gaulle's policies. He obtained the support from several left-wing parties, including the French Communist Party (PCF), which wished to get out of its isolation. ==Results== Despite running a somewhat lacklustre campaign, de Gaulle won the first round by over three million votes. However, he came up short of a majority, forcing a runoff being held two weeks later, pitting him against Mitterrand. Tixier-Vignancour supported Mitterrand in the second round, Lecanuet called on his voters not to vote for de Gaulle. De Gaulle defeated Mitterrand by a decisive margin in the runoff. However, Mitterrand performed better than expected, one of the first warnings that de Gaulle's popularity was in decline. De Gaulle retained his Prime Minister Georges Pompidou but decided to carry out a cabinet reshuffle. He dismissed his Economy Minister Val√©ry Giscard d'Estaing, damaging the relations in the majority coalition with Giscard's party, the Independent Republicans, the last allies of the Gaullists. ==Further reading== * Williams, Philip M., David Goldey, and Martin Harrison.

McDermott of CMU in 1978 to assist in the ordering of DEC's VAX computer systems by automatically selecting the computer system components based on the customer's requirements. ==Overview== In developing the system, McDermott made use of experts from both DEC's PDP/11 and VAX computer systems groups. These experts sometimes even disagreed amongst themselves as to an optimal configuration. The resultant \\"sorting it out\\" had an additional benefit in terms of the quality of VAX systems delivered. XCON first went into use in 1980 in DEC's plant in Salem, New Hampshire. It eventually had about 2500 rules. By 1986, it had processed 80,000 orders, and achieved 95‚Äì98% accuracy. It was estimated to be saving DEC $25M a year by reducing the need to give customers free components when technicians made errors, by speeding the assembly process, and by increasing customer satisfaction. Before XCON, when ordering a VAX from DEC, every cable, connection, and bit of software had to be ordered separately. (Computers and peripherals were not sold complete in boxes as they are today.) The sales people were not always very technically expert, so customers would find that they had hardware without the correct cables, printers without the correct drivers, a processor without the correct language chip, and so on. This meant delays and caused a lot of customer dissatisfaction and resultant legal action. XCON interacted with the sales person, asking critical questions before printing out a coherent and workable system specification/order slip. XCON's success led DEC to rewrite XCON as XSEL‚Äîa version of XCON intended for use by DEC's salesforce to aid a customer in properly configuring their VAX (so they would not, say, choose a computer too large to fit through their doorway or choose too few cabinets for the components to fit in). Location problems and configuration were handled by yet another expert system, XSITE. McDermott's 1980 paper on R1 won the AAAI Classic Paper Award in 1999. Legendarily, the name of R1 comes from McDermott, who supposedly said as he was writing it, \\"Three years ago I couldn't spell knowledge engineer, now I are one.\\" ==See also== * MYCIN ==References== *The AI Business: The commercial uses of artificial intelligence, ed.
