Geta was a praetor some time before 42. In the latter year, commanding a legion, probably the Legio IX Hispana in the Africa Province, he was a part of Gaius Suetonius Paulinus' campaigns into Mauretania. Geta defeated Sabalus, a chief of the Mauri, twice, and after gathering as much water as could be carried, pursued him into the desert. Sabalus' forces were more used to the conditions and the legion's water began to run out. A native friendly to the Romans persuaded Geta to perform a rain ritual used by his people and rain began to fall. The Romans' thirst was relieved and the Mauri, seeing the heavens come to their enemies' aid, surrendered. Geta and his legion were part of the Roman conquest of Britain, led by Aulus Plautius, the following year. Geta was almost captured in the Battle of the Medway in the early part of the campaign, but recovered and turned the battle so decisively that he received the ornamenta triumphalia, which was unusual as he had not yet been a Consul. He was a Legatus in Britannia about 45. An inscription found in Rome reveals that he became Suffect Consul in 49. Geta married, but the name of his wife is unknown. He had a daughter called Hosidia, born about the year 65. Hosidia married Marcus Vitorius Marcellus, a man of consular rank and a friend of the poet Statius. Hosidia and Marcellus had a son called Gaius Vitorius Hosidius Geta. ==Sources== * Cassius Dio, Roman History 60.9, 20, 60.20 * William Smith (1870), Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology Vol 2 p. 529-530 ==External links== * Hosidius Geta at Encyclopaedia Romana Category:Ancient Romans in Britain Category:Ancient Roman generals Category:Senators of the Roman Empire Category:Suffect consuls of Imperial Rome Category:1st-century Romans Category:20s births Category:Year of birth uncertain Category:Year of death unknown ","title":"Gnaeus Hosidius Geta"},{"id":"1997296","text":"Hans Niessl (in official documents, his surname is spelt Nießl, born 12 June 1951 in Zurndorf) is an Austrian politician, member of the Social Democratic Party of Austria and former Governor of Burgenland.

Inspired by the Prussian techniques that he had been able to observe at the time of his studies in Berlin, he tried to impress the Swiss Army with a spirit based on instruction, discipline and technical control. ==Nomination as general== General Ulrich Wille, Commander-in-Chief of the Swiss Army during World War I At the dawn of the First World War, Switzerland confirmed its will to remain neutral and to avoid the conflicts which were going to set Europe ablaze. However, Switzerland was divided between the German-speaking Swiss who favored the Central Powers, and the French and Italian-speaking Swiss whose opinions tended to support the Allied Powers. As a Germanophile, close to Kaiser Wilhelm II, Wille benefitted from the pro-German current and the disparity within the Swiss Federal Council, which counted only one member from the French areas. In 1914, at the outbreak of warfare, a general mobilization of all military forces was issued. Wille, then a Colonel, was named General of Switzerland by the Federal Parliament on 8 August 1914 with 122 votes, against 63 votes for the other candidate, Theophil Sprecher von Bernegg. Von Bernegg would soon assume the rank of Chief of the General Staff and become a reliable partner of Wille's. The opponents of the general described him as \\"militarist\\" whereas his partisans saw in him a chief ready to manage an army in mobilization thanks to his pedagogical talents. Wille decided to concentrate the bulk of his forces (238,000 men and 50,000 horses) close to the borders, particularly in Ajoie and Engadine. ==Political issues== Wille, Ulrich (1848–1925) The mandate of Wille was rife with political problems. Wille caused a scandal in French-speaking Switzerland by proposing to the Federal Council on 20 July 1915, to enter the war on the side of the Central Powers. Thereafter, the \\"Colonels' Affair\\" in 1916 also had a great repercussion. Two Swiss colonels had given German and Austro-Hungarian diplomats specimens of the \\"Staff Gazette\\", a confidential journal, and Russian messages deciphered by Swiss cryptanalysts. The affair risked Swiss neutrality since it implied collusion with one of the belligerents. Wille decided to condemn the two colonels to 20 days' detention, an unsatisfactory sentence in the eyes of the pro-Allied party. The confrontation between French-speaking Switzerland and German-speaking Switzerland widened. The Germanic newspapers supported the German actions in Belgium, whereas the French ones highlighted the resistance of the Allied troops. The economic situation was poor and many strikes occurred, reaching their apogee with the Swiss general strike from 11 November to 14 November 1918. In a note dated 10 November 1918, Wille announced his concern for the rise of Bolshevism and the internal disorders to come in the country: But he added that it was necessary to avoid violence: Meanwhile, Wille had to manage the pandemic of the Spanish influenza, which affected the troops and the recruit schools. In order to combat the spread of the epidemic, enlistment of new recruits was delayed. ==Personal life== Ulrich Wille's family was from La Sagne in the Canton of Neuchâtel. One of his ancestors settled in Hamburg and renamed the family name, \\"Vuille\\", to the more German \\"Wille\\". Ulrich's parents were journalist and politician François Wille (1811–1896) and novelist Eliza Wille-Sloman (1809–1893). They were liberals and, due to their disillusion by the failed German revolutions of 1848–49, they left Hamburg for Switzerland with their newborn son Ulrich. They settled in Meilen in the Canton of Zürich, where Ulrich grew up in Mariafeld, the family estate. Wille was married to Countess Constanza Maria Amalia Clara von Bismarck (1851–1946), the daughter of Count Friedrich Wilhelm von Bismarck, a distant relative of Chancellor Otto von Bismarck, with whom he had two daughters and three sons. His eldest son, also named Ulrich Wille, followed his father's footsteps in the military, ultimately becoming a Corps Commander. Wille Jr. also managed to keep his father's pro-German tendencies throughout his career, including during the Second World War. This would contribute to his tensions with the next Swiss General, Henri Guisan. His daughter Renée Schwarzenbach-Wille, who was married to silk tycoon Alfred Schwarzenbach, was an Olympic horsewoman and prolific photographer. His granddaughter was the renowned author, traveler, and photographer Annemarie Schwarzenbach. ==External links== * ==References== Category:1848 births Category:1925 deaths Category:People from Meilen District Category:Swiss generals Category:Military leaders of World War I Category:Military history of Switzerland Category:Swiss people of World War I Category:ETH Zurich faculty ","title":"Ulrich Wille"},{"id":"1997312","text":"Battle of Gabiene was the second great battle (the third battle in total; see: the battles of Orkynia and Paraitakene) between Antigonus Monophthalmus and Eumenes, two of Alexander the Great's successors (the so-called Diadochi). The battle was fought near Gabiene in Persia in 315 BC and ended the Second War of the Diadochi. It established Antigonus as the most powerful of the successors. Since the sole reference of this battle is ultimately from Eumenes' personal aide Hieronymus of Cardia (later transmitted through the historian Diodorus), who later switched his allegiance to Antigonus, he provides a unique perspective from both sides' point of view. ==Background== After the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC, his generals immediately began squabbling over his empire. Soon it degenerated into open warfare, with each general attempting to claim a portion of Alexander's vast kingdom. One of the most talented generals among the Diadochi was Antigonus Monophthalmus (\\"Antigonus the One-eyed\\"), so called because of an eye he lost in a siege. During the early years of warfare between the Successors, he faced Eumenes, a capable general who had already crushed Craterus. The two Diadochi fought a series of actions across Asia Minor, and Persia and Media before finally meeting in what was to be the last clash at Gabiene (). Antigonus had been a general for Philip II, king of Macedon, and later for Alexander. Skilled and experienced in war, he had proved himself in many battles. Eumenes was not of Macedonian origin, unlike the rest of Diadochi. He had first been Philip's then Alexander's secretary, but Alexander seemed to have recognized a military talent in Eumenes, and gave him several senior commands in the campaign in India. After Alexander's death, Eumenes quickly showed his skill, allying himself with Perdiccas and winning over much of Anatolia. In 319 BC, Antigonus marched his army into Cappadocia (Eumenes's satrapy) and in a lightning campaign (see: battle of Orkynia) drove Eumenes to Nora, a strong fortress on the border between Cappadocia and Lycaonia. Here Eumenes held out for more than a year until the death of Antipater threw his opponents into disarray. He escaped from Nora through trickery, allied himself with Polyperchon (the new Regent of the Empire) and, after gathering a small army, he marched into Cilicia where he made an alliance with Antigenes and Teutamos, the commanders of the Macedonian Silver Shields and the Hypaspists.Diodorus Sicilus, Bibliotheca Historica, XVIII 59,1-3. Eventually Eumenes secured control over these men by playing on their loyalty to, and superstitious awe of, Alexander.Diodorus Sicilus, ’’Bibliotheca Historica’’, XVIII 60,1-60,3. He used the royal treasury at Kyinda to recruit an army of mercenaries to add to his own troops and the Macedonians of Antigenes and Teutamos.Diodorus Sicilus, ’’Bibliotheca Historica’’, XVIII 61,4-5 In 317 BC, Eumenes left Cilicia and marched into Syria and Phoenicia, and began to raise a naval force on behave of Polyperchon.Diodorus Sicilus, ’’Bibliotheca Historica’’, XVIII 63,6. When it was ready he sent the fleet west to reinforce Polyperchon, but of the coast of Cilicia it was met by Antigonus's fleet and changed sides.Polyainos,’’Strategemata’’ IV 6,9. Meanwhile, Antigonus had settled his affairs in Asia Minor and marched east to take out Eumenes before he could do further damage. Eumenes somehow had advance knowledge of this and marched out of Phoenica, through Syria into Mesopotamia, with the idea of gathering support in the upper satrapies.Diodorus Sicilus, ’’Bibliotheca Historica’’, XVIII 73,1-2. When Antigonus arrived in Syria, he found out Eumenes had left his base in Phoenica and had marched into the east. They marched and counter- marched through Mesopotamia, Babylonia, Susiana and Media until the two armies finally met in southern Media and fought the indecisive battle of Paraitakene.Diodorus Sicilus, Bibliotheca Historica, XIX 26-32,2; Richard A. Billows, Antigonos the One-Eyed and the Creation of the Hellenistic State pp.95-98. Antigonus, whose casualties were more numerous, force marched his army to safety the next night.Diodorus Sicilus, Bibliotheca Historica, XIX 32,1-2 ==Prelude== During the winter of 316-315 BC, Antigonus tried to surprise Eumenes in Persia by marching his army across a desert to try and catch his enemy off guard. Unfortunately he was observed by some locals who reported it to his opponents. Eumenes then tricked Antigonus in believing he had his entire army with him. He gathered together a body of troops and, marking out on the hills a large camp, he had each soldier tend a campfire during the night giving the impression that a large army encamped there. Antigonus gave up his plan and awaited the rest of his army.Diodorus Sicilus, Bibliotheca Historica, XIX 37,2-6; Plutarch, Life of Eumenes, 15,3-4; Polyainos, Strategemata IV 6,11 and 8,4. A few days later, the armies drew together and encamped opposite of each other about five miles apart. They were on a broad plain, entirely uncultivated because of the loose and salty soil.Diodorus Sicilus, Bibliotheca Historica, XIX 39,6 and 42,1; Polyainos, Strategemata IV 6,13. ==Battle== Antigonus, having a superiority in cavalry, resolved to mass his heavy cavalry and most of his elephants and light infantry on his right and strike against Eumenes's left flank, while refusing his center (infantry) and left (light horse). Antigonus and his son Demetrius commanded the heavy cavalry themselves. Eumenes, having seen Antigonus' deployment, placed himself and his best cavalry opposite Antigonus' heavy cavalry along with his own elephants and light infantry. He intended to hold Antigonus's charge while using his elite Argyraspides (the Silver Shields) phalanx to win in the center.Diodorus Sicilus, Bibliotheca Historica, XIX 40,1-4; Plutarch, Life of Eumenes, 16,3-4. The Argyraspides were a unit of veterans who had fought under Philip and then Alexander. Despite the fact that these battle-hardened veterans were old enough to be their opponents' grandfathers, they were still highly respected and thought to be invincible in combat. Disposition of troops at the Battle of Gabiene. Before the battle opened, Antigenes, the leader of the Argyraspides, sent a horseman over to Antigonus' phalanx heckling them, \\"Wicked men, are you sinning against your fathers, who conquered the whole world under Philip and Alexander?\\". The morale of Antigonus' phalangites sank and the phalanx of Eumenes raised a great cheer in response. Eumenes saw an opportunity and began advancing. The skirmishers and elephants were the first to engage. At once a great cloud of dust was raised from the loose soil, obscuring most of the action. Antigonus observed this and decided to take advantage of it. He selected a body of Median and Tarentine light cavalry and ordered them to ride around Eumenes's left flank and attack his camp; they were to seize his baggage train and carry it back to Antigonus's camp. Because of the dust, this action went entirely unnoticed by Eumenes's army. Finding the enemy camp inadequately guarded, Antigonus's men captured and carried off most of their opponents baggage train, containing the wives, children, servants, and accumulated savings of the army.Diodorus Siculus, Bibliotheca Historica, XIX 42,1-3; Plutarch, Life of Eumenes, 16,5-6; Polyainos, Strategemata IV 6,13. Battle of Gabiene. Battle of Gabiene, last mouvement. On the right flank, using the thick dust to cover his movements, Antigonus and Demetrius rode with their heavy cavalry around the engaged skirmishers and elephants to unexpectedly hit Eumenes's horse on their flank. Taken by surprise a great part of Eumenes's heavy cavalry under Peucestas routed. Despite Eumenes's heroic efforts to drive off the Antigonids, he was seriously outnumbered and was driven back. Antigonus and Demetrius used their cavalry to form a screen between Eumenes and the rest of his army. The battle of the elephants and skirmishers was decided when Eumenes' lead elephant was killed and the rest became so unnerved they fled. Antigonus had clearly won the battle on the right flank.Diodorus Siculus, Bibliotheca Historica, XIX 42,4-43,8; Plutarch, Life of Eumenes, 16,4-17,1; Polyainos, Strategemata IV 6,13. Meanwhile, in the center the two phalanxes had engaged. Spearheaded by the nigh invincible Silver Shields, Eumenes's phalanx had won a clear victory. Eumenes now ordered Peucestas to go back into combat with his cavalry and exploit the advantage, but the latter refused, retreating even further instead. Antigonus ordered Pheiton (in command of the right flank) to attack Eumenes's phalanx in the rear. This forced Eumenes's heavy infantry to break off their victorious pursuit, but being battle- hardened veterans, they kept their head, formed a square and marched safely off the battlefield. ==Aftermath== Although Antigonus was victorious, winning on both flanks and getting the enemy center to retreat off the battlefield, the battle's result was, like Paraitacene, inconclusive, with Eumenes still possessing a strong force. That evening, Eumenes attempted to convince the army to fight Antigonus again the next day. His army was reluctant, as they had just found out their camp had been plundered, the satraps wanted to retire to protect their satrapies. It was the Silver Shields who took matters into their own hands. Learning that Antigonus had their wives, children, servants and booty, they secretly opened negotiations with Antigonus. A deal was struck whereby Antigonus would return their baggage and families in return for Eumenes and a promise of future allegiance. The Silver Shields promptly arrested Eumenes and his senior officers and handed them over to Antigonus.Diodorus Siculus, Bibliotheca Historica XIX 43,8-44,3; Plutarch, Parallel Lives, the Life of Eumenes 17,1-19,1; Cornelius Nepos, Parallel Lives, Life of Eumenes, 10,3-13,1. Eumenes was put under heavy guard while Antigonus held a council to decide his fate. Demetrius and Nearchos urged Antigonus to spare Eumenes's life, but most of the council members insisted he execute Eumenes. So it was decided, then, and Eumenes met his end, his body being turned over to his friends for burial. Eudemus, who had come from India as an ally of Eumenes and was responsible for the recruitment of Eumenes' elephants and light infantry was also executed, as was the leader of the Argyraspides, Antigenes. The Macedonians of Eumenes's army were drawn into the ranks of Antigonus's army. Given the fickle loyalty of the Silver Shields (betraying Eumenes and Antigenes), Antigonus decided to send the 1,000 unruliest of them to the far off satrapy of Arachosia to fight in the frontier war with the Indians, the local satrap Sibyrtius was given special orders to regard them as expendable.Diodorus Siculus, Bibliotheca Historica XIX 48,3-4; Polyainos, Strategemata IV 6,15; Plutarch, Parallel Lives, the Life of Eumenes 19,2. == Popular culture == Alfred Duggan's novel on the life of Demetrius, Elephants and Castles, also covers the battle.

It lies on the south bank of the River Ribble, opposite the city of Preston, adjacent to Bamber Bridge. The population of the South Ribble Ward at the 2011 census was 3,792. To the west of Walton-le-Dale is the residential area of Walton Park. == History Toponymy=== Walton is derived from walh and tun and means the farmstead or settlement of the Britons. It was recorded in the Domesday Book as Waletune. In the 13th century it was recorded as Waleton and since about 1300 Waleton in le (la) Dale, or Walton in the valley. ===Early history=== The remains of a Roman fort at the junction of the River Darwen and River Ribble at Walton-le-Dale were discovered by accident in the mid 19th century. Roman remains found here include pottery and coins. The fort may have been the Rigodunum of Ptolemy, although most people locate it at Castleshaw. ===Manor=== Two oxgangs of land in Walton belonged to King Edward the Confessor in 1066, and after the Norman conquest, was the demesne of Roger de Busli and Albert Grelley. The manor passed in about 1130 to Henry de Lacy of Pontefract and was later granted to the Banastres and their successors the Langtons. John de Langton obtained the right to hold a weekly market and an annual fair in October in 1301. The manor passed from the Langtons to the Hoghtons of Hoghton who held the manor as mesne lord. ===Battles=== The bridge at Walton-le-Dale During the English Civil War the bridges over the river were the scene of skimishes between the Royalists and Roundheads. In 1644 Royalists were captured by Parliamentarians and Walton was the principal scene of the first Battle of Preston, fought on 17 August 1648 between Cromwell and the Duke of Hamilton. In 1715, during the second Battle of Preston, the bridge over the River Ribble was successfully defended against the Jacobites by Parson Wood and his parishioners of Chowbent. ===Industrial Revolution=== During the Industrial Revolution there were four cotton mills, including Flats Mills belonging to William Calvert which employed 400 workers and James Livesey and Son's Moon Mill employing 130 workers. There was a cotton printing business and in 1800 Robert Whittaker established an iron foundry. == Governance == Anciently Walton-le-Dale was a township and chapelry in the parish of Blackburn and a part of the hundred of Blackburnshire. In 1701 the Duke of Norfolk, the Earl of Derwentwater and other Jacobites incorporated the town by the style of the \\"mayor and corporation of the ancient borough of Walton.\\" It became part of the Preston Poor Law Union, formed in 1837, which took responsibility for the administration and funding of the Poor Law and built a workhouse in that area. A local board was formed in 1877, and in 1894 an urban district council of twelve members representing four wards was formed. Walton-le-Dale was in the Darwen parliamentary division of Lancashire. Since 1974 the local council is South Ribble based in Leyland and the area is part of the Ribble Valley parliamentary constituency. == Transport == Walton-le-Dale is served regularly by Stagecoach Merseyside & South Lancashire and Blackburn Bus Company buses. The Park & Ride service into Preston City Centre is located in Walton-le-Dale, at the Capitol Centre retail park. The Capitol Centre is a large retail and leisure facility, which was built on the site of the former Flats Mills. ==Religion== The church of St Leonard, situated on high ground to the east of the village, was originally erected in the 11th century. The earliest portions of the present building are the Perpendicular chancel and tower, the nave having been rebuilt in 1798, while the transepts were erected in 1816. There are a number of interesting old brasses and monuments. The church of Our Lady and St Patrick is located on Higher Walton Road in the village. Originally formed in 1855 by the Benedictine order, the Parish of Our Lady and St Patrick (originally the Mission of St Patrick) includes both The Pugin Church of Our Lady and St Patrick and St Patrick's RC Primary School, and has served Walton- le-Dale and surrounding area for over 150 years. ==Culture== In 1701 some of the local gentry including the Duke of Norfolk, the Earl of Derwentwater and other Jacobites formed the Mock Borough of Walton, a social club, which lasted for about 50 years, and met in the Unicorn Inn, near Darwen Bridge. The mock corporation had officers which included a mayor, his deputy, recorder, bailiff, chaplain, serjeant, physician and mace-bearer but which also appointed a house-groper, jester, poet laureate, master of the hounds, sword- bearer, in 1708 a slut-kisser and in 1711 a custard-eater. ==Legends== At midnight on 12 August 1560, under the moonlight in St Leonard's Churchyard, occultist and scholar Dr John Dee summoned the spirit of a man who had died before giving the whereabouts of a considerable amount of money. It is said that he was successful and the spirit did indeed tell the occultist the whereabouts of the wealth, but not before also predicting to Dee the fate of many of the locals, which is said to have later come true.

Although not Vermont's longest river, it is one of the state's most significant, forming a major valley way from Lake Champlain through the Green Mountains towards (although not connecting in drainage to) the Connecticut River valley. The river drains an area of the northern Green Mountains between Vermont's capital of Montpelier and its largest city, Burlington. It rises in the town of Cabot in Washington County, and then flows southwest to Montpelier, passing through the city along the south side of downtown and the Vermont State House. From Montpelier it flows northwest into Chittenden County through Richmond, passing north of the city of Burlington. It enters the eastern side of Lake Champlain approximately northwest of downtown Burlington. The city of Winooski sits along the river approximately upstream from its mouth, on the northeastern edge of Burlington. The river was historically used for the transportation of timber in the logging heyday of Vermont during the 19th century. The valley of the river downstream from Montpelier is where both U.S. Highway 2 and Interstate 89 run between Montpelier and Burlington. The river is one of several antecedent rivers in Vermont which predate the rise of the ancient Green Mountains, and have cut through these mountains as they rose and eroded. ==Tributaries== The Winooski is fed by several tributary rivers: the Little River, the North Branch and the Kingsbury Branch are right-bank tributaries, entering from the north, while the Huntington River, Mad River, Dog River and Stevens Branch are left-bank tributaries which enter from the south. The Lower Tributaries, smaller tributary streams nearer the mouth of the Winooski, include Allen Brook, Alder Brook, Gleason Brook, Mill Brook, and Muddy Brook. ==History== The name \\"Winooski\\" comes from the Abenaki word winoskik meaning \\"at wild onion land\\", a reference to the leeks or wild onions that were once common along the river banks. The byname \\"Onion River\\" came into general usage in the late 18th and early 19th century, after Ira and Ethan Allen established the Onion River Land Company. In the late winter of 1992, ice blockage in the Winooski caused a major flood in Montpelier, causing extensive damage to much of the downtown, the worst flood in Montpelier's history since the larger Great Flood of 1927. ==Uses== Falls on the Winooski River between the cities of Winooski (foreground) and Burlington (far shore) The river is used for a variety of purposes. It is popular for recreational uses such as canoeing, kayaking, fishing and swimming. In addition to providing habitats for the native brook trout, the Winooski and its tributaries also support naturalized populations of wild rainbow trout and brown trout. Smallmouth bass and walleye are found in the lower reaches of the river, and migratory populations of largemouth bass and northern pike often enter the Winooski from Lake Champlain in the spring. Additionally, a number of hydroelectric dams are used for generating electricity. The Winooski One Dam, located on the river in the city of Winooski, was the first high- performance civil structure in the world imbedded with fiber optic sensors when it was built in 1992. For this reason, the dam was listed in the Guinness Book of World Records as the \\"world's most intelligent dam\\". ==See also== *List of rivers of Vermont == References External links== *Local River Protection Group, Friends of the Winooski River *Hydrologic data on Vermont rivers from the National Weather Service, including the Winooski River Category:Rivers of Vermont Category:Bodies of water of Washington County, Vermont Category:Bodies of water of Chittenden County, Vermont Category:Tributaries of Lake Champlain ","title":"Winooski River"},{"id":"1997346","text":"David Kushner is a writer who has contributed to publications including Wired, The New York Times, Rolling Stone, SPIN, IEEE Spectrum and Salon.

The ABA has teams based in the United States and previously had international teams based in Canada and Mexico. In the past, there were traveling teams from countries such as Australia and Japan who played in the ABA. Additionally, there were players from other countries that were on a U.S. team to showcase other talented athletes in the country. The current ABA bears no relation to the original American Basketball Association (1967-1976) that was considered a major league, and merged with the National Basketball Association (NBA) in 1976. ==History== The current ABA was started by Joe Newman and Richard Tinkham. Tinkham was an executive with the Indiana Pacers when they were in the original ABA. They licensed the ABA name from the NBA. ===2000–2003=== The league started in 2000 with eight teams. During its initial years of operation, the league focused mainly on teams in larger cities. To attract fans, the ABA encouraged its members to fill rosters with former NBA players and past college basketball stars with local ties. In 2002–03, the league suspended operations for reorganization. The league continued to play for the 2003–2004 season, but the focus had shifted from a few teams in large cities to numerous teams in both large and medium-sized cities. Franchise fees were lowered from $50,000 to $10,000 and the bond requirement was removed in order to attract new teams. The subsequent reduction in initial operating costs allowed the formation of several teams that might otherwise not be possible. However, it resulted in some under-financed ownership groups. Since 2004, several new teams have failed to complete their inaugural season due to financial insolvency. Also, teams were organized into regional groups to facilitate interest and reduce travel costs starting with the 2003–2004 season. ===2004–2006=== The 2004–05 season was the first under this new format, with 37 teams playing that season. Subsequent seasons brought drastic expansion. Some teams had proved to be successful in their early years, but others did not complete their initial seasons. At times, the ABA had 50+ teams playing each season. Some of the more successful expansion franchises during this era included the Arkansas RimRockers in 2004 and the Rochester Razorsharks in 2005. Both teams won the ABA title during their first seasons in the league. ===2006–2007=== The 2006–07 season saw the nominal cost for a new expansion franchise raised to $20,000, but many still sold for $10,000 – $5,000 or less. In some cases, teams were sold for as little as $1. One notable 2006–07 expansion franchise was the Vermont Frost Heaves, owned by Sports Illustrated writer Alexander Wolff. Also in 2006–07, former NBA player John Salley was named league commissioner, and Maryland Nighthawks owner Tom Doyle was named chief operating officer. Following the league's first public offering in 2006, it was reported that Joe Newman was voted out of his position as league CEO.Board of Directors of American Basketball Association, Inc. Votes to Remove CEO – OurSports Central – Independent and Minor League Sports News. OurSports Central (2007-02-05). Retrieved on 2014-04-12. The league's required Securities and Exchange Commission filings in February 2007 indicated that the ABA Board of Directors removed Newman as CEO on January 31, 2007. The filings further stated that Newman's actions as CEO would be reviewed to ensure that they were performed with the board's permission. The same filing also claimed that Newman and other shareholders plotted to remove Tom Doyle, John Salley, and David Howitt from the board and to elect Paul Riley as its director. Newman denied his removal ever occurred, and continued as acting CEO.ABAlive.com – Home of the American Basketball Association The lawsuits were settled in March 2007 with Doyle's and Salley's resignations from the league's Board of Directors. The 2006–07 season saw many franchises fail to travel to road games or to play a full schedule. When weather-related issues did not allow defending champion Rochester Razorsharks to travel for a playoff game against the Wilmington Sea Dawgs, the league attempted to force Rochester to forfeit rather than reschedule. Instead, Rochester chose to withdraw from the league. These several incidents caused some league owners to perceive instability within the league. These frustrated owners separated from the ABA to form the Premier Basketball League (PBL) in late 2007. ===2007–2009=== Nearly twenty teams folded within the first five weeks of the 2007–08 season, and several remaining teams left the ABA to join other existing leagues. According to Our Sports Central, approximately 35% of the games scheduled for the season were played. The teams that played the highest percentage of games were Vermont, the Manchester (NH) Millrats, and the Quebec Kebs. At the conclusion of the season, all three of these teams left to join the PBL. Another unique franchise for the 2008–09 season was the Beijing Aoshen Olympians, which had previously been kicked out of the Chinese Basketball League and played only home games in the ABA. All Olympians' games were played in Singapore. The Beijing franchise paid $3000 and all team flight accommodations to Singapore for each 2-game home-stand. Following the 2007–2008 season, the league's most successful franchise by attendance, the Halifax Rainmen, left the ABA. Halifax ownership cited growing frustration with teams that did not show for scheduled games, as well as a biased ranking system. Sports media began to openly criticize the league and question its ability to be taken seriously. The 2008–09 season saw the league conduct interleague play with the Continental Basketball Association. ===2009–2010=== The 2009–10 season was scheduled to have over 50 teams. The season ended with several teams folding in early December, including the entire Northwest Division. The league canceled several playoff games due to the inability of teams to afford travel. The playoffs ended with Southeast Texas Mustangs defeating the Kentucky Bisons in a three-game series. On April 25, 2010, as part of their ABA Global Initiative, the league hosted the 2010 ABA Friendship Games, in which the Philippine National Basketball Team competed against several ABA teams. ===2010–2011=== The 2010–11 season was expected to field over 60 teams, including a new Canadian Division. In the summer of 2010, the league announced its first Haitian professional basketball team, the Haitian Relief.ABA Announced Haitian expansion team In total, the ABA planned to host over 800 games throughout the season.ABA season schedule However, the 2010–2011 campaign ended similar to previous seasons, with several teams folding either before or during the season. Instead of the promised 60 teams, the league fielded fewer than 50 full-time franchises that actually played games. The 2011 ABA All-Star Game resulted in a 123–122 Eastern Conference win over the Western Conference in front of a crowd of 4,488 at the Jacksonville Veterans Memorial Arena in Jacksonville, Florida. The playoffs started the following weekend, with the last four teams playing a double-elimination tournament at the home of the Southeast Texas Mavericks. The Mavericks won their second ABA title two games to none over the Gulf Coast Flash. Despite continued instability, the league announced plans to form a new Women's American Basketball Association (WABA), unrelated to the original Women's American Basketball Association, which existed for one season in 2002. The new league's first squad was to be located in Greenville, North Carolina. ===2012–2013=== The league failed to launch the WABA in the 2011–12 season and announced new plans to launch for the 2012–2013 season. The second attempted launch was pushed back to the 2013–2014 season with nine initial teams set to play: the Philly Love, New Jersey Express, New England Stormers, Hampton Roads Lightning, Lake City Kingdom Riderettes, Fayetteville Lady Cadets, Columbus Lady Road Runners, McAllen Queens, and Chicago Lady Steam. As of February 2019, the WABA has yet to report any game results. ===2013–2014=2015–2016=== March 23, 2015 the ABA announced the launch of a new Media & Entertainment Division to be headed by hip hop mogul & ABA team owner Antjuan \\"Tjuan Benafactor\\" Washington.http://www.americanbasketballassociation.org/#!ABA-ANNOUNCES-NEW- MEDIA-ENTERTAINMENT-DIVISION/clfr/5512181d0cf220353053fa82 On June 22, 2015, the ABA announced a multi-year partnership with Sports Radio America.^ \\"Basketball History: ABA awards Sports Radio America Broadcast Rights\\".

It is one of the longest parish churches in the country and is larger than 21 English Anglican Cathedrals. ==Early history== The story of Christchurch Priory goes back to at least the middle of the 11th century, as the Domesday Book of 1086 says there was a priory of 24 secular canons here in the reign of Edward the Confessor. The Priory is on the site of an earlier church dating from 800AD.The Priory Church | Parish of Christchurch, Dorset, England In 1094 a chief minister of William II, Ranulf Flambard, then Dean of Twynham, began the building of a church. Local legend has it that Flambard originally intended the church to be built on top of nearby St. Catherine's Hill but during the night all the building materials were mysteriously transported to the site of the present priory.The Makers of Christchurch - Michael Stannard p25 Although in 1099 Flambard was appointed Bishop of Durham, work continued under his successors. A mid-12th century account recording the legend of the Christchurch Dragon indicates that by 1113 the new church was nearing completion under Dean Peter de Oglander. By about 1150 there was a basic Norman church consisting of a nave, a central tower and a quire extending eastwards from the crossing. It was during this period that another legend originated, that of the miraculous beam, which is thought to have brought about the change in the name of the town from Twynham to the present day Christchurch, but in fact the two names both featured in a grant dated AD954 ('juxta opidum Twinam, id est, Cristescirce'). ==Twelfth to fourteenth centuries== The entrance porch to the Priory In 1150 Baldwin de Redvers, Lord of the Manor of Christchurch and Earl of Devon replaced the secular minster with an Augustinian priory. The de Redvers continued in their patronage of the priory for 150 years, until in 1293, Isabella de Fortibus, Countess of Devon (the last of the de Redvers line) sold her eastern estates to Edward I for about £4000. By this action, Christchurch became a Royal Manor which meant that in 1303 it was required to provide and man a ship to aid the King's campaign against Scotland. In 1330 Baron William de Montacute was granted the manor by Edward III and thus became the 1st Earl of Salisbury (Second Creation). In the 13th century there was a frenzy of building: the nave aisles were vaulted, the clerestory was built, the Montacute Chapels replaced the Norman apse in the north transept and work began on the North Porch, notable for its unusually large size. One of the chapels became the Church of St. Thomas the Apostle, although the current building mostly dates from the 18th century. Although there is no documentary evidence relating to a central tower, the massive piers and arches at the corners of the transepts seem to indicate provision was made for one. A central tower would have been consistent with a Norman conventual church. ==Fourteenth to sixteenth centuries== The Lady Chapel, added to the eastern end of the building in the 15th century Work continued in the 14th century. The nave roof reached its present height no later than 1350 and towards the end of the 14th century work on the Lady Chapel was started. It was completed in the early 15th century and its pendant vaulting is thought to be the first of its kind in England. Also in the 15th century, the original quire was replaced and extended so that it joined onto the new Lady Chapel. This may have been as a result of the Norman tower collapsing, but this is not certain. What is certain is that the tower was rebuilt between 1470 and 1480. The Draper and Salisbury chantry chapels were completed by 1529. By this time, the church looked much as it does today. ==Christchurch Priory Cartulary== Much of what is known about Christchurch between the Norman Conquest and the mid-14th century comes from the Christchurch Priory Cartulary, which contains copies over 1,300 of the monastery’s most important documents. Most of it was written by just two clerks, one completing more than half before a second concluded the task in 1372. Further amendments and updates were added in the following decades. The existence of the cartulary in the Priory library was recorded by John Leland shortly before the Dissolution, but its whereabouts in the decades after 1539 are uncertain. Almost a century later it was in the library of Sir Robert Cotton, a notable collector of medieval manuscripts. In 1753 the Cotton library collection was acquired by the newly founded British Museum, but the Christchurch Priory Cartulary was thought lost until it was discovered in an old cupboard in a garret of the Museum in 1837. It is today held in the British Library, where it is still catalogued by Sir Robert Cotton's filing system: Cotton MS Tiberius D.vi. Efforts to translate the whole Cartulary began in the late 20th century, but not until 2007 was this task completed by Katharine Hanna and published by Hampshire County Council. ==Miraculous beam== The Miraculous Beam, still exposed in the church The legend of the miraculous beam dates to the early 12thcentury. The story is that a beam was found to have been cut too short when it was hoisted into place. This would have been embarrassing for the carpenters since the wood was expensive and would be difficult to replace. There was however a mysterious carpenter who had worked and eaten alone. The following day the carpenters returned and found the beam was now fitted in place. The unknown carpenter was never seen again, and the story came to be that it was Jesus Christ who had intervened. The church became Christ's Church of Twynham in commemoration of the event.Brief History | Fabric and History | Christchurch Priory In time the town became Twynham- Christchurch and eventually shortened to Christchurch. The miraculous beam can be seen today and is located in the Priory’s ambulatory. ==Misericords== The Priory has 39 misericords, dating from three periods: 1250, 1350 and 1515. They show a mixture of mythological and folklore scenes, some of which appear to have been derived from Aesops fables. There are also some showing religious iconography, such as the emblems of St Mark and St Matthew. ==Dissolution== On 28 November 1539, John Draper, the last prior of Christchurch, surrendered the priory, and it was dissolved. Prior Draper was granted a pension of £133-6s-8d and the use of Somerford Grange for life. The conventual buildings of the priory were pulled down soon after the dissolution. The King had intended to demolish the church as well as the conventual buildings, but in response to a plea from the townspeople, supported by Prior Draper, he granted it, together with the churchyard, to the churchwardens and inhabitants of Christchurch to be used as the parish church in perpetuity on 23 October 1540, a grant that was confirmed on 12 February 1612 by James I. ==Post-Dissolution== The southern aisle, facing east After the Dissolution a corporation known as 'The Sixteen' was formed which became responsible for the temporal and ecclesiastical affairs of the parish, with the vicar and churchwardens being the principal officers. In 1788 Gustavus Brander gave the priory a pipe organ, which was installed on the quire screen. It was removed in 1848. In 1819 lath and plaster vaulting was installed in the nave, but a year later the vaulting of the south transept was found to be unsafe and had to be dismantled. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries extensive repairs were carried out, which included the insertion of tie-rods in the tower and the underpinning of the nave and south choir aisle walls in 1906. In 1912 a new floor was laid in the nave consisting of 6\\" of concrete, an inch of fine cement and wooden blocks on top. A monument to the poet Percy Bysshe Shelley and his wife Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley, created by the sculptor Henry Weekes, was erected in the Priory church by the poet's son in 1854, thirty-two years after his father's death. This monument was first offered to St Peter's Church, six miles away in Bournemouth, where Mary Shelley and other family members are buried. However, it was declined because of its size and possibly due to the unspoken disapproval of Shelley's reputation by the incumbent and churchwardens. The War Memorial Chapel was dedicated in 1922. Electric lighting was installed in June 1934. ==Modern history== In 1976 Highcliffe Castle donated the glazing of the window in the south nave aisle, which had come originally from Jumièges Abbey in Normandy. The window depicts the lives of Saint Francis of Assisi and Saint Anne. In 1999 a window celebrating the 900th anniversary of the priory was installed, which shows a starry night in which the Cross of Christ dominates, surrounded by a pattern of circles, the symbols of Eternity and Perfection, and the Chi-Rho monogram of Christ. Christchurch Priory, as its website puts it, is 'a living church' with daily services of matins and evensong, as well as being open every day except Christmas for visitors. In the 21st century The Times described it as 'the least appreciated of the Great Churches of England'. ==Bells== The Tower in which the 12 bells hang. The Priory has a ring of 12 bells plus a 6th flat. The Bells are rung twice on Sundays and Monday nights and for extra services. They are in the Key of D and the Tenor (largest) weighs 30cwt (1½ Tons). The two oldest bells in the ring were cast in 1376 by John Rufford. ===Brief History=== Seven bells were recorded at the time of the dissolution of the Monasteries, and two of these were removed when the priory church became parochial in 1540. In 1633 this heavy five was converted into a lighter six by removing the tenor, recasting the 4th and adding two trebles. In 1755 Abel Rudhall augmented the ring to eight, and John Taylor & Co rehung the bells in a ten bell frame in 1885, replacing the 3rd at the same time. The bell they cast for Christchurch came out flat, and so a bell originally intended to be the 4th of a new ring of eight for The Saviour, Bolton, was supplied instead. The 1885 Taylor bells from The Saviour have now been transferred to St Peter's, Bolton, where they are the back eight of the present ring of twelve there. Despite a ten bell frame being installed at Christchurch in 1885, it was not until 1904 that the ring was augmented, the trebles being cast by Llewellins & James of Bristol. In 1931 the 6th was replaced, with the old bell (cast in 1663 by William Purdue III of Salisbury) being retained in the bellchamber. In 1932 the ring was augmented to twelve, with the 1904 trebles of ten being removed from the ring and placed, with their fittings, on a stand in the bell chamber and two new bells being cast to replace them. The old 6th of ten was scrapped in 1976, and in the same year the metal from the 1904 trebles of ten was used towards the casting of a flat 6th, with the inscriptions from the two bells being copied onto this. The new bell was cast and hung by Taylor's. More recently, in 1991, Whitechapel Bell Foundry overhauled the fittings and replaced the gudgeons and bearings. ===Framework and Fittings=== The front four bells, the flat 6th and the 8th were cast with flat tops. The 5th and 6th have cable patterned canons, the 7th angular canons, and the remaining bells have had their canons removed. The frame is of timber, and is basically that installed by Taylor's in 1885. A new foundation of RSJs was inserted beneath the frame in 1932, and two timber pits, which now contain the treble and 3rd, were added to the East side. A single cast iron lowsided pit for the flat 6th was added on the south side in 1976. The additions of 1932 and 1976 were both carried out by Taylor's. The fittings are rather a mixture. The four trebles and the flat 6th have Taylor fittings contemporary with them and consisting of cast iron headstocks, ball bearings, traditional wheels, stays and sliders.. The back eight have timber stocks, presumably dating from either 1885 or 1904, traditional wheels by Llewellins & James and dating from 1904, and traditional stays and sliders. The bells were rehung on ball bearings by Taylor's in 1932, and the gudgeons and bearings were replaced by Whitechapel in 1991. There is also an Ellacombe chiming apparatus, which was installed by Llewellins & James in 1904. {| class=\\"wikitable\\" |- ! Bell !! Date !! Founder !! Diameter !!

The children of the choir can earn medals as they gain experience and skill, the rank of chorister is: probationer - full choir member (given surplice) - light blue medal - dark blue medal - red medal - purple medal (Yellow for girls) - deputy (green medal) - head (green medal). The choir sing three services during term time on Sundays: Eucharist: 9:30- 10:30 Matins: 11:30- 12:15 Evensong: 6:30- 7:30 The men sing all three services while the two children's choirs alternate weekly between morning services and evening service (one week a choir will do eucharist and matins, the next week it will do evensong). On occasion, such as Christmas and Easter services Both children's choirs will sing alongside the men. ===Organ=== On 17 July 1999 a new pipe organ was dedicated and installed in the south transept. It is an extensive rebuild by Nicholson of Worcester of the previous organ, weighing around 20 tonnes, with nearly 4,000 pipes, some of which are from the original 1788 organ. The new organ cost in excess of £500,000, of which £373,000 was provided by the Arts Council from the National Lottery Fund. A specification of the organ can be found on the National Pipe Organ Register ===Organists=== *Henry Holloway 1933–1936 *Geoffrey Tristram 1949-1979 *Clive Harries 1980–1983 *Roger Overend 1983–1986 *Martin Schellenberg 1986-1995 *Geoffrey Morgan 2002–present ===Directors of Music=== *Geoffrey Tristram 1949-1979 *Martin Schellenberg 1986-1995 *Andrew Post 2001–2009 *Hugh Morris 2009–2015 *Simon Earl 2015– ===Girls Choir Music Directors=== *Cathy Lamb 2005-2007 *Mary Goodman 2007–present ===Assistant Organists=== *Michael Andrews *Mark Hammond *Sean Tucker 1992–1994 ==Burials== *Sir Thomas West (1312–3 September 1386) and wife Alice FitzHerbert (died 1395) *Thomas West, 1st Baron West *William de Redvers, 5th Earl of Devon *John Draper, the last prior of Christchurch ==See also== *List of English abbeys, priories and friaries serving as parish churches *Loretto Chapel ==Gallery== File:The Priory Church, Christchurch, England-LCCN2002696553.tif|Photocrom print, 1890-1900 Image:Christchurch Dorset 01.jpg|Christchurch Priory from Wick, across the River Stour Image:Christchurch Dorset 05.jpg|Christchurch from Wick Fields, showing the full length of the Priory building.

His parents are John and Jill Bean. He attended Friends Boarding School in Providence, Rhode Island. He moved to Iowa in 1853, where he taught school in West Branch. Bean met Hannah Elliot Shipley from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, during a trip she took to Iowa. In 1859 they got married at the Orange Street Meeting House in Philadelphia and settled back in West Branch. They visited the Sandwich Islands (Hawaii) from 1861-1862 as Quaker ministers. Joel was appointed clerk of the Iowa Yearly Meeting (Iowa Yearly Meeting) in 1867, and the couple went on a ministry tour of Europe from 1872-1873. When they returned from the trip to Europe the Beans discovered that the revival that had been springing up among Friends in Iowa had progressed to a point that they could not approve. The revivalists insisted that people need to be “saved” and “sanctified,” which the Beans and others did not think was in accord with traditional Friends beliefs. The revivalists were also bringing into their meetings such things as programmed (planned) worship, more emotional worship, and paid pastors. ==Religion== The Beans at first had welcomed the revival movement, believing that it was bringing life into the Society of Friends. But they saw that as it progressed it was departing from such Quaker ideas as the universality of the Inner light, the need for spiritual discipline and gradual growth rather than instant perfection, silent meetings for worship to wait on direct and personal guidance from God, and volunteer lay ministers and elders. Even though the Beans opposed the holiness movement, they would not join a group of Conservative Friends who left the Iowa Yearly Meeting in opposition to that movement. They disliked division and did not want to be part of it. After moving to San Jose, California, for the sake of Joel’s health and meeting with other Friends there who had been a part of the Iowa Yearly Meeting, they helped to establish the College Park Association of Friends. Then in 1893 the Iowa Yearly Meeting deposed them as ministers and in 1898 disowned (expelled) them from membership altogether. Many Quakers in England and New England were shocked and unhappy about the Beans’ disownment, as the Beans had proven themselves devout Friends and apt ministers. The New England Yearly Meeting accepted them as members and as ministers. Joel and Hannah Bean’s granddaughter Anna Cox Brinton was influential in the development of the Pacific Yearly Meeting from the earlier College Park Association. ==ReferencesExternal links== *Biographical notes *The Beans’ story by Chuck Fager Category:American Quakers Category:People from Alton, New Hampshire Category:People from San Jose, California Category:1825 births Category:1914 deaths Category:Quaker ministers Category:19th-century Quakers Category:20th-century Quakers Category:People from West Branch, Iowa ","title":"Joel Bean"},{"id":"1997385","text":"In humans, the tectospinal tract (or colliculospinal tract) is a nerve tract that coordinates head and eye movements. This tract is part of the extrapyramidal system and connects the midbrain tectum, and cervical regions of the spinal cord. It is responsible for motor impulses that arise from one side of the midbrain to muscles on the opposite side of the body (contralateral). The function of the tectospinal tract is to mediate reflex postural movements of the head in response to visual and auditory stimuli. The portion of the midbrain from where this tract originates is the superior colliculus, which receives afferents from the visual nuclei (primarily the oculomotor nuclei complex), then projects to the contralateral (decussating dorsal to the mesencephalic duct) and ipsilateral portion of the first cervical neuromeres of the spinal cord, the oculomotor and trochlear nuclei in the midbrain and the abducens nucleus in the caudal portion of the pons. The tract descends to the cervical spinal cord to terminate in Rexed laminae VI, VII, and VIII to coordinate head, neck, and eye movements, primarily in response to visual stimuli. ==See also== * Spinotectal tract * Upper motor neuron ==ReferencesExternal links== * Diagram at etsu.edu * Overview and diagram at uchicago.edu * Category:Spinal cord tracts Category:Motor system ","title":"Tectospinal tract"},{"id":"1997390","text":"Maria \\"Masha\\" Efrosinina (), (born 25 May 1979 in Kerch), is a Ukrainian television host.

He escaped from custody numerous times, but ultimately died in prison. ==Biography== Wagner left home at the age of fourteen and joined a circus. He became known as a trickshot artist. At the onset of Prohibition he made and sold moonshine. He was an imposing man, six feet three inches tall, weighing 260 pounds. His troubles with the law began in 1925 when he was arrested in Lucedale, Mississippi, for stealing a watch. Awaiting trial, he overpowered the jailer and stole a horse. A posse tracked him to a shack in the woods, but he shot his way out, killing a deputy. He fled to his native mountains. Meeting his sister and friends on the banks of Holston River, near Kingsport, Tennessee, he engaged in a shootout with five local lawmen, killing two and wounding a third. Wagner fled first on horseback, then on foot. He surrendered to a storekeeper in Waycross, Virginia. Following a trial in Sullivan County ending with a death sentence verdict (including a temporary escape from the county jail), Wagner staged a successful escape from state prison. He fled to Mexico and became notorious for bank and train robbery but returned to the United States. He killed two men in barroom brawls and subsequently surrendered to a female sheriff in Arkansas. The two men whom he killed were Will Carper, and his brother, Sam Carper, and they were at Sam's home, not in a bar, and they were unarmed. The sheriff was Lillie Barber, widow of a slain sheriff. She refused to try Wagner, because in Arkansas, murder in cold blood was a capital offense, and she fell in love with him. Mississippi, Tennessee, and Arkansas wanted him for murder. Since his first killing was in Mississippi, he was tried there and in 1926 was sentenced to life to be served at Parchman Farm. His first escape attempt was foiled by an informant. However, he was allowed to become an armed trustee and head trainer of the prison's bloodhounds. He tracked escapees alone, armed on horseback. In 1940, he escaped but was located three years later near his old Virginia home. Returned to Parchman, he was again a model prisoner until 1948 when he walked off.David M. Oshinsky, Worse than Slavery: Parchman Farm and the Ordeal of Jim Crow Justice, Free Press, 1997, , Chapter 7: \\"The Other Parchman: White Men, Black Women\\", pages 166-168. His most notable escape was his last attempt and involved a clever trick that was not discovered until Wagner was outside the prison walls. He had been made a trustee whose job it was to tend the dogs at the prison. He quickly realized the dogs were the means by which the prison guards would track him if he were to escape again. He therefore trained the dogs not to track him by whipping them if they followed his scent. Wagner remained at large in Wahalak, Mississippi for several years afterward under the alias \\"Big Jim,\\" and was subsequently placed on the FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list. In 1956, he was recaptured after a jealous rival informed law enforcement officials of his residence at the house of a female friend. Seriously ill, he stated \\"I am very happy to be going back to Parchman.\\" He died there in 1958. ==Folklore and legacy == There are several folksongs and ballads about Wagner's escapades. There are several books written about the Mississippi outlaw. And he has also been covered in comics and pulp magazines. The East Tennessee and Southwest Virginia stories about Kinnie Wagner propose a far different picture of the gunslinger. Even the local newspaper The Kingsport Times News in Kingsport, Tennessee maps out the events that led to Wagner's initial crime, intended arrest, and eventual capture very differently from their Mississippi counterparts. Folklorists have explained that Wagner had been cast into the stereotype of the Southern or Western outlaw: chivalrous to women, generous to the poor, a free desperado. ==ReferencesFurther reading== * Gentry, Claude.

He played 15 seasons in Major League Baseball for the Boston Braves (1915–1919), New York Giants (1919–1926), Cincinnati Reds (1926–1927), and the Chicago Cubs (1927–1929). He was left-handed, and 176 pounds when he made his debut in 1915. ==Early life== Nehf was born in Terre Haute, Indiana, and attended the Rose Polytechnic Institute in Terre Haute. His parents were Charles T. Nehf and Wilhelmina Neukom. Art married Elizabeth B. May on November 1, 1916. ==Career overview== Besides finishing with a 184–120 record and a 3.20 ERA in 451 games, Nehf had 182 complete games and 28 shutouts (30 including postseason) in 319 starts. He had 13 career saves and also picked up a total of 844 strike outs in 2707 2/3 innings pitched. Some years, he pitched as a starter only, and some as a relief pitcher and a starter, but he was always solid in both roles, earning a reputation around the majors as an always-consistent pitcher. ===Batting=== Nehf had a .210 career batting average with 8 home runs and 76 RBIs. Of his 8 home runs, 2 came in one game in 1924. It was his only multiple home run season. Art Nehf was the last pitcher to have 3 hits in a World Series game (Game 1~October 4, 1924) until Orel Hershiser tied that record in 1988 (Game 2~October 16). ==Major league careerBraves=== Nehf as a member of the Boston Braves in 1918. Nehf came up with the Braves in 1915, and frequented the leaderboards throughout his time with them; he led the league in complete games with 28 in 1918, and showed up in the top 10 in wins, three times, including the year that he was traded to the Giants mid-season. In 1917, Nehf had what is generally thought of as his best season with the Braves, when he went 17-8 with a 2.16 ERA, pitching very consistently, and completing 17 of his 23 starts, with five shutouts, while also finishing seven games on the year. He also had his career-high in strike outs that year with 101, the only time he had more than 100 strike outs. ===Giants=== Nehf was traded to the Giants for four players and cash on August 15, 1919. He won a career-high 21 games in 1920, his first full year with the Giants. Nehf pitched in four consecutive World Series with the Giants: 1921, 1922, 1923 and 1924. He was the last man to win back to back clinching games in the World Series in 1921 and 1922. In 1924, he defeated Walter Johnson in 12 innings in the WS opener, but the Giants lost to the Washington Senators that year. The Giants won in 1921 and 1922 with the help of Nehf, who had an all-time World Series record of 4–4 with an ERA of 2.16 in twelve games, and nine starts, with six complete games. He had 28 strikeouts all-time in the World Series. Nehf also participated in the 1929 World Series with the Cubs in his last year, as the Cubs lost to the Philadelphia Athletics. ===Reds and Cubs=== Nehf won 107 games with the Giants, while he lost only 60. After many solid, and sometimes great, seasons with the Giants and then being traded to Cincinnati, and then to Chicago, most thought Nehf's career was virtually over. But he managed to put up one more very good year in 1928 with the Cubs. He went 13-7 with a still very low, 2.65 ERA. That year, he was also involved in a very strange and controversial play against his former team, the Giants. With the Giants in a tight pennant race against the St. Louis Cardinals, their loss in the 1st game of a doubleheader on September 27, 1928, was made all the more controversial. New York's Shanty Hogan hit a ball back to Nehf who threw to third base to get the runner, but the runner Andy Reese was off with the crack of the bat and was already at home plate, knocking over catcher Gabby Hartnett. Hartnett grabbed the runner to keep from falling, and as Hartnett held him, Reese was tagged out by the Cubs third baseman. The Giants bench erupted, but umpire Bill Klem ruled Reese out. The subsequent protest was turned down despite clear pictures showing Reese being held back. The Giants went on to lose the pennant to the Cards by two games. Coincidentally, the Cubs were two games behind that. Nehf also was involved in one of the strangest innings in World Series history. Charlie Root was the Cubs' starting pitcher for Game 4 of the 1929 World Series at Shibe Park and was cruising along with an 8-0 lead against the Philadelphia Athletics. In the seventh inning, Nehf was brought in from the bullpen after the Athletics cut the lead to 8-4. The first batter he faced, Mule Haas, hit a fly ball that Hack Wilson lost in the sun. It ended up a three-run inside-the-park homer for Haas, and the A's went on to a 10-run inning. The Cubs lost the game 10-8 and lost the World Series two days later. ==Post-playing life== Nehf died of cancer in his home in Phoenix, Arizona in 1960.Art Nehf, Ex-NY Giant star hurler, dies at 68 ==Highlights== *Top 5 in the National League in ERA, twice (1922, 28), and in the top 10 one more time (1917) *Top 10 in wins, six times (1917, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22) *Top 10 in winning percentage, six times (1917, 19, 20, 21, 24, 28) *Led the league in complete games in 1918 (28), and made the top 10, four more times (1919, 20, 21, 22) *Top 10 in strike outs, twice (1918, 24), and top 10 in strikeouts per nine innings, twice (1924, 25) *As a Giant, held the record for postseason consecutive road scoreless innings pitched at 22 2/3rds for 90 years – broken by Giant Madison Bumgarner in the 2014 NLCS *Winning pitcher in final game of both the 1921 & 1922 World Series ==Honors== The varsity baseball field at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology (formerly Rose Polytechnic Institute) is named in Nehf's honor.

Sheng Long is a character hoax related to the Street Fighter series, created by Electronic Gaming Monthly (EGM) as an April Fools' prank in 1992 (in an issue published mid-February). The joke, based upon a mistranslation that suggested the existence of a character named Sheng Long in the Capcom fighting game Street Fighter II, described a method to fight the character in the game. After other publications reprinted the details as fact without verifying the authenticity, the Sheng Long hoax spread worldwide. As a result of discussion revolving around the possibility of the character's appearance in Street Fighter III during the game's development, EGM revisited the joke in 1997, printing an updated version of the hoax for the title while establishing a backstory and appearance for the character in the process. As a character and a hoax, Sheng Long has been described as one of the most famous and well-known legends related to video gaming by publications such as GameDaily and GameSpot. The hoax influenced the creation of both Akuma and Gouken as characters in the Street Fighter series, with the former appearing in Super Street Fighter II Turbo as a secret boss. Fan appeal for the character affected later Capcom titles, with public requests for the inclusion of Sheng Long in an actual video game leading to the consideration of his inclusion in the Street Fighter: The Movie video game and years later resulting in the appearance of Gouken as both a secret boss and playable character in Street Fighter IV. ==Origin== The name Sheng Long comes from a mistranslated portion of the name of a special move performed by the series' main character, Ryu; the characters shō ryū (昇龍 rising dragon) from Shōryūken (昇龍拳), Ryu's flying uppercut, are shēng lóng in Chinese pinyin. This was carried into one of Ryu's quotes to defeated opponents in the English localization of the 1991 arcade game Street Fighter II, changing the Japanese quote to \\"You must defeat Sheng Long to stand a chance.\\" As a result, players were given the impression that Ryu was referring to a person instead of the attack. The Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) port of Street Fighter II, released shortly after the April Fools' prank, changed the translation to \\"You must defeat my Dragon Punch to stand a chance.\\" However, the English instruction manual for the SNES Street Fighter II referred to \\"Master Sheng Long\\" as Ryu and Ken's teacher. Instruction manuals for later ports to the SNES and Sega Mega Drive consoles replaced all references to Sheng Long by referring to Ryu and Ken as disciples of the \\"Shotokan school of karate\\". Sheng Long would later make an appearance in the 1993 Malibu Comics as Ryu and Ken's master, Shenlong was poisoned by Ryu's clone created by M. Bison, the fighting Nida accuses Ryu of having poisoned the master. A character named Gouken was later introduced in Masaomi Kanzaki's 1993 Street Fighter II manga as Ryu and Ken's sensei, and was adapted into the series' backstory in Super Street Fighter II Turbo. ===Original EGM April Fools 1992=== Coupled with edited screenshots, the hoax inspired many to try to fight Sheng Long in Street Fighter II. The mistranslation spawned rumors about the existence of a Sheng Long character in the game, and players sent letters to video game publications attempting to confirm the character's existence. In the April 1992 issue of the video game magazine Electronic Gaming Monthly, a method was \\"revealed\\" to reach Sheng Long in the arcade game. The reporter gave an \\"Honorable Mention\\" to \\"W.A. Stokins\\" (\\"waste tokens\\") of \\"Fuldigen, HA\\" (\\"fooled again, ha\\") and claimed that the character could be found if a player using Ryu did not let the character suffer any damage during the entire game, and upon reaching the final match against M. Bison could neither hit Bison nor let him inflict any damage until the time limit expired, thus ending the round in a draw. After repeating this for ten consecutive rounds Sheng Long would then appear out of nowhere and throw Bison off of the edge screen and out of the way. The game's on-screen timer would then stop at 99 seconds, resulting in a \\"fight to the death\\" between Ryu and Sheng Long. Sheng Long was stated to feature the special moves of all the fighters, such as Chun-Li's \\"Spinning Bird Kick\\" and Sagat's \\"Tiger Shot\\", but inflict more damage. In addition, the character was supposedly faster than any other fighter in the game, negating the pause between projectile attacks. Other attacks mentioned included an air-based throw attack and a \\"Dragon Punch\\" shown to consume his fist in flames to represent his greater power. The joke became an international sensation when publications from Europe, Hong Kong and other countries reprinted the trick without verifying it or asking EGMs permission. A Hong Kong comic based on Street Fighter II by Jademan Comics altered their story to include the character. Players tried unsuccessfully for weeks to unlock Sheng Long, until it was revealed in the December issue of EGM that it was a hoax, with the staff stating they were surprised at the worldwide coverage the joke had received. ===EGM April Fools 1997=== During the development of Street Fighter III, fans discussed the prospect of the character's inclusion in the new title. EGM perpetuated the hoax again in 1997 by claiming that Sheng Long was in the game, providing character artwork depicting his appearance and new screenshots. Unlike the first article, they did not finish their explanation of how to reach him, ending the article with \\"To reach him, you will need at least six perfects and...\\" Additionally, the words \\"April Fools\\" were spelled out in the first letter of the first ten sentences of the article. The character's design was expanded on greatly in the article; Sheng Long was now stated to be the American name for the character Gouken, much like Akuma is the American name for Gouki (which would appear in the 2nd Impact revision of the game). His profile listed in the article paralleled Gouken's, but instead of Akuma killing him he was knocked into a raging river. The result gave him a scar over his eye, and a desire to get revenge on his brother. To this end, he revived several \\"killing techniques\\" of his fighting style, which included an air version of Akuma's red fireball that knocked his opponent down, a double ground high-low Hadouken, an unblockable Denjin-Shinryuu-Ken super attack that would shock the opponent, an air rapid Hadouken super attack akin to a move used by Ibuki, and a third super attack intended to be a stronger version of the Shun Goku Satsu. EGM reported that despite this being the second Sheng Long joke, it was convincing enough that Capcom of America staff called Capcom of Japan asking why they had not been told that the character was in the game. ==Legacy== Sheng Long is cited as an influential factor for the Street Fighter series, earning mention in articles such as GameDaily's \\"Top 20 Street Fighter Characters of All Time\\" list, in which the character placed nineteenth despite not being an actual character. IGN placed it second on their list of the \\"Top Ten Gaming April Fools' Pranks\\", noting it as having the biggest impact of all of Electronic Gaming Monthlys April Fools jokes. UGO.com named it one of video gaming's greatest urban legends, noting its impact upon the series' success. Capcom's community manager Seth Killian described the hoax as \\"a part of gaming history\\", comparing him to the Konami Code. However, GamesRadar listed it as one of the video game legends that they never want to hear again, stating that while it was a good prank at first, Sheng Long has gone from \\"sly wink to the fans\\" to \\"Borat t-shirt.\\" The rumor is often credited with inspiring the creation of Akuma, a character who debuted as a hidden final boss in Super Street Fighter II Turbo, due to their similarities, although Capcom has never confirmed nor denied this. As in the hoax, the process of fighting Akuma would require certain achievements met during the game, with Akuma interrupting the final match of the game between the player and M. Bison. The similarity was nodded at in the high-definition remake of Super Street Fighter II Turbo, in which an Xbox 360 Achievement titled \\"Sheng Long is in Another Castle\\" (which is a pun of a well-known phrase in the early Super Mario Bros. games: \\"Thank You Mario! But our princess is in another castle!\\") could be earned for defeating Akuma in the game's arcade mode. In the 2012 Disney movie Wreck-It Ralph, a piece of background graffiti reads, \\"Sheng Long was here!\\" ===Street Fighter: The Movie=== Sheng Long is mentioned four times in the 1995 arcade game Street Fighter: The Movie in the endings for Ryu, Ken, and Akuma. In each, he is stated as the master of Ryu and Ken and Akuma's brother, but never stated as dead. Despite the repeated mention, Sheng Long does not appear in the game. On January 30, 2007 the game's designer, Alan Noon, appeared on Shoryuken.com's forum and discussed aspects of the game cut during development, among them a playable Sheng Long character. According to Noon, talk had circulated about adding extra characters that were not in the film. As the Sheng Long hoax and Akuma's debut in Super Street Fighter II Turbo were fairly recent at the time, the designers asked for Capcom's permission to add both characters into the game. Capcom approved the addition of Akuma, but denied the inclusion of Sheng Long. However, Capcom later unexpectedly approved the addition of Sheng Long. Noon designed Sheng Long's appearance for the title, giving him black gi pants and a long, green, padded/quilted, sleeveless Gi style top which was tied off with a black beltmandarin style, long white braided hair, Fu Manchu moustache, a thick black ribbon over his eyes due to being blinded by Akuma and one hand taking the form of a dragon's claw, described as a result of his power being so advanced, that he began to physically manifest dragon like attributes. Capcom approved the design, and Luis Mangubat, an artist from the development team (who would later work at Midway Games), posed as Sheng Long. However, the character was left unfinished because of time constraints. ===Street Fighter IV=== Fan requests for a playable Sheng Long directly resulted in the inclusion of Gouken in Street Fighter IV. In an interview in the January 2008 Issue of Electronic Gaming Monthly, Street Fighter IV producer Yoshinori Ono stated \\"Let's just say that [jokes] that your magazine have reported in the past might find their way into the game as fan service.\\" Executive editor Shane Bettenhausen took this to mean the appearance of Sheng Long in Street Fighter IV, though added that if the character did appear in the game, it would be Gouken. When asked in a later interview by 1UP.com regarding the possibility of Sheng Long's appearance in the title, Ono replied \\"Are you coming to the Tokyo Game Show? How about you ask me that question again then.\\" Capcom later revealed Gouken as a character in Street Fighter IV, with Ono stating in an interview with Play magazine that his inclusion in the title was in response to fans requesting Sheng Long's presence in the game. On the first of April 2008, Capcom announced Sheng Long as a \\"secret, unlock-able character\\" in their Japanese development blog for Street Fighter IV and later posted in their official US blog accompanied with a silhouette of the character. The post took the tone of a Capcom PR representative trying to announce a character without giving away too many details, hinting that \\"Sheng Long is Ryu's...\\" then holding back and saying to wait for an official character announcement. Similar to the original EGM joke, the post lists the method to unlock him as requiring the player to win every round as Ryu without taking any damage whatsoever and then perform his \\"Shoryuken\\" move during the final boss fight. Reception to the joke the third time was negative, and included criticism from 1UP.com. The following day, the Japanese website confirmed that it was indeed a joke, and explained the origin of Sheng Long while adding \\"Sheng-Long is still now and always will be, truly a character of legend.\\" In March 2017, 25 years after the EGM article was published, Capcom gave Sheng Long a joke profile in the Shadaloo Combat Research Institute part of their Capcom Fighters Network website. Satirizing the Sheng Long rumor, it states that he became a living legend, appears after consecutive draw games, his moves are impossible to counterattack and always register as counter hits, and that anyone that sees him will die after 24 hours. The artwork resembles his appearance in Electronic Gaming Monthlys Street Fighter III' April fools article, except instead of long hair and a beard this version sports a long mohawk and a mustache forked upwards. Shortly after the page was removed. ==See also== *Ermac ==ReferencesExternal links== * FightingStreet.com article on Sheng Long Category:April Fools' Day jokes Category:Fictional karateka Category:Fictional Chinese people Category:Male characters in video games Category:Street Fighter Category:Video game characters introduced in 1992 ","title":"Sheng Long"},{"id":"1997407","text":"Criminalization or criminalisation, in criminology, is \\"the process by which behaviors and individuals are transformed into crime and criminals\\".Michalowski p. 6. Previously legal acts may be transformed into crimes by legislation or judicial decision. However, there is usually a formal presumption in the rules of statutory interpretation against the retrospective application of laws and only the use of express words by the legislature may rebut this presumption. The power of judges to make new law and retrospectively criminalise behaviour is also discouraged. In a less overt way, where laws have not been strictly enforced, the acts prohibited by those laws may also undergo de facto criminalization through more effective or committed legal enforcement. The process of criminalization takes place through societal institutions including schools, the family, and the criminal justice system. ==The problems== There has been some uncertainty as to the nature and extent of the contribution to be made by the victims of crime. But, as Garkawe (2001) indicates, the relationship between victimology and criminology has become problematic. The concern is that, within the dialectic of Right Realism and Left Realism,Walklate (2003). a focus on the victim promotes rights selectively for certain victims, and advocates the assumption that some victim rights are more important than competing rights or values in society.Elias (1993). For example, an Islamic feminist might seek consistency of treatment for women as victims and, therefore, demand the decriminalization of abortion, adultery, and seduction (Zina is a Hudud offense in sharia law), and the criminalization of domestic violence and sexual harassment. In formal academically published theory, the real ruling class of a society reaches a temporary view on whether certain acts or behavior are harmful or criminal. Historically this one theory will be modified by scientific, medical evidence, by political change, and the criminal justice system may or may not treat those matters as crimes. Conversely, when local politics determines that it is no longer a crime, they may be decriminalized. For example, Recommendation No. R (95) 12 adopted by the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe on the management of criminal justice, advocates that crime policies such as decriminalization, depenalisation or diversion, and mediation should be adopted wherever possible. But the law and order debate between right and left politicians is often superficial and unscientific, formulating policies based on their appeal to an uninformed electorate rather than properly conducted research.Currie (1991). ==Principles== Several principles may underpin decisions about criminalization. These include the de minimis principle, that of the minimum criminalization.Ashworth (1999). p. 67. Under this principle, the general harm principle fails to consider the possibility of other sanctions and the effectiveness of criminalization as a chosen option. Those other sanctions include civil courts, laws of tort and regulation. Having criminal remedies in place is seen as a \\"last resort\\" since such actions often infringe personal liberties - incarceration, for example, prevents the freedom of movement. In this sense, law making that places a greater emphasis on human rights. Most crimes of direct actions (murder, rape, assault, for example) are generally not affected by such a stance, but it does require greater justification in less clear cases. The policy of \\"social defense\\" can be seen as an opposing view. It argues that criminalization is used against \\"any form of activity which threatens good order or is thought reprehensible\\". The minimization principle may unwittingly prevent the adaptation of the law to new situations. In general, worldwide policy makers have created a myriad of smaller offences, in contradiction to the minimization principle and more in keeping with the social defence.Ashworth (1999). p. 68. ===Harm=== Leading criminal law philosophers, such as Dennis Baker and Joel Feinberg have argued that conduct should only be criminalized when it is fair to do so.Dennis J. Baker, The Right Not to be Criminalized: Demarcating Criminal Law's Authority (Ashgate 2011) at chapter 3; Dennis J. Baker Dennis, \\"The Moral Limits of Criminalizing Remote Harms\\", (2007) 11(3) New Criminal Law Review 371, Joel Feinberg, Harm to Others: The Moral Limits of the Criminal Law, OUP, 1984: New York. In particular, such theorists assert that objective reasons are needed to demonstrate that it is fair to criminalize conduct in any given case. The commonly cited objective justification for invoking the criminal law is harmful to others, but it cannot deal with all situations. For example, people are not necessarily harmed by public nudity. Feinberg suggests that offence to others also provides an objective reason for invoking the criminal law, but it clearly does not as offence is determined according to conventional morality. Prostitution is another grey area, as some countries allow it in different forms, and it is hard to say whether or not it specifically harms the public in general. One argument may be that prostitution perpetuates the spread of sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV/AIDS, and therefore harms the public which partakes in the act of prostitution. However, the legalization of prostitution would change the way it is regulated, and law enforcement could find a way to prevent the spread of sexually transmitted disease, thus eliminating the health issue and the question of the morality of the profession would be weakened. People experience a range of physical and social injuries in different contexts which will vary according to the level of economic and political development of their country. Some will be injured out of poverty and malnutrition, others by violence which might stem from a major conflict such as war or from the personal violence in a robbery. The environment may be damaged by pollution, there may be hazards at work. Many of these sources of injury will be ignored while the state may delegate powers of control to a number of different agencies within an international framework where supranational agencies and human rights organisations may offer assistance in responding to the causes of those injuries. ===Moral approaches and autonomy=== The extent to which behaviours considered morally wrong in a given jurisdiction should be criminalized is controversial.Ashworth (1999). pp. 42-43. Lying or breaking promises are not in general criminalised, for example. Patrick Devlin believed that moral behaviour was essential in maintaining the cohesion of a state, and so lawmakers should be entitled to criminalise immoral behaviour.Ashworth (1999). p. 43. However, opponents of this approach typically suggest use of a harm principle only and that immorality is not a reason in itself since outcomes of such activity can be used to come to a conclusion alone. Devlin's argument uses the disgust of the general public as a definition of morality; however, issues involving prejudice have shown this to be flawed and opponents push for a much stricter definition if this approach is to be used. Devlin suggested a jury to give an indication of immoral behaviour. As well as prejudice, views were likely to vary widely on issues such as homosexuality, contraception and other matters, particularly those influenced by religion. Agreement would be hard to find. Other opposition has been from liberal groups which favour approaches which maximise individual rights.Ashworth (1999). p. 44. A moral basis for criminalization would be paternalistic, thereby contrasting with personal autonomy. The European Convention of Human Rights, in the most part supporting individual rights from government interferences, still includes a provision for interference \\"for the protection of health and morals\\" such as legally requiring seat belts to be worn (in some jurisdictions) are hard to justify if an individualistic approach is taken, since, if public health provision is ignored, little harm is caused to others.Ashworth (1999). pp. 44-45. Joseph Raz argues that the state cannot and should not enforce morality; rather, any attempt to limit individual autonomy should be done only to limit harm. Certain moral ideals may be justifiable if they extend autonomy. If the immoral conduct of others impinges on someone else's autonomy, then that can be legislated against.Ashworth (1999). p. 45. There are some groups for whom the principle of autonomy is weakened: those under an age of majority and those people who are impaired by, for example, a mental disorder. In general, these people are protected from activities with significant consequences, if they are not in a position to make reasoned decisions themselves.Ashworth (1999). pp. 45-46. This may involve the criminalization of under-age drinking, smoking, gambling and sexual activities. Such criminalization is rarely challenged. In British law, a distinction between public and private acts was made in the Wolfenden report, which examined sexual activities (particularly homosexuality and prostitution). Some acts would effectively become legal within private settings, but illegal in public settings.Ashworth (1999). p. 46. The justification for this was the concept of shock or offensive to the public. Such a line was favoured by Joel Feinberg, who argued that it was a good reason in support of legislation if it effectively prevented \\"serious offence\\" to persons other than the actor. Philosophers such as Feinberg struggle to quantify the ideology behind the illegality of acts which in another setting would be acceptable (that acts themselves not causing harm, for example), for example nudity. Since such acts publicly are made illegal on the basis of shock, then whether to criminalise depends on a shifting body of public opinion, which varies from place to place and from time to time. The concept of \\"insult\\" rather than \\"offensive\\" may be more specific.Ashworth (1999). pp. 46-47. ===Omission=== Common law does not often find an actor liable for omission - failing to do something required by the law. Where this has applied it has typically been in industrial regulation, in matters of social security or some personal regulated activity such as driving (for example, in the case of a hit and run).Ashworth (1999). pp. 47-48. These form conditions placed upon operating in a particular manner and are thus understood in that context. There are few general duties in common law jurisdictions, although these do include the responsibility of a parent to safeguard their children, to a landowner to prevent offences being carried out there, and to someone creating a dangerous situation to attempt to limit that danger.Ashworth (1999). p. 48. Proponents of limited liability for omissions suggest that the wording for such a law would be vague, possibly involving \\"reasonable\\" care or action, and so would be hard to enforce. This would give prosecutors wide discretion, which may be opposed to justice. Morally, omission is viewed by many as a far lesser problem than act; compared to murder, allowing someone to die is seen as much smaller.Ashworth (1999). pp. 48-49. A requirement to spend one's time and energy helping others would seem to contradict the autonomy many other laws aim to provide the individual with.Ashworth (1999). p. 49. Opponents point out these arguments fail to consider the harm that such omissions may cause, in contradiction to the harm principle many legal systems start out with. Life and physical integrity are often the highest priorities of a legal system. Difficulties in definition are in common with many other areas, theorists such as Feinburg point out. A non- burdensome rescue is likely to be less valuable than freedom of action. Limited liability is considered as article 223 of the French Penal Code, which criminalises: \\"(1) a person who voluntarily neglects to prevent a serious crime of offense against that person, if that crime could be prevented without personal risk or risk to others; and (2) a person who voluntarily neglects to give, to a person in peril, assistance which could be rendered without personal risk or risk to others.\\"Ashworth (1999). pp. 49-50. This is common with several other European jurisdictions. Whilst open to the criticisms of vagueness and prosecutor discretion, it has not been seen as overly oppressive.Ashworth (1999). p. 50. ===Procedure=== When a state debates whether to respond to a source of injury by criminalising the behaviour that produces it, there are no pre-set criteria to apply in formulating social policy. There is no ontological reality to crime. The criminal justice system responds to a substantial number of events that do not produce significant hardship to individual citizens. Moreover, events which do cause serious injuries and perhaps should be dealt with as crimes, e.g. situations of corporate manslaughter, are either ignored or dealt with as civil matters. The criminalization process defines and classifies behaviour. It broadcasts the laws so that no-one may have the excuse of ignorance, and disposes of those who will not obey. There are now more criminal laws and they are penetrating deeper into the social structures of modern societies. Crime control has become an industry, yet it remains ineffective in providing protection to all its citizens from harm. Such as it is, the process is made up of three components: #Creation of a social order. This is both a socio-economic process, a \\"...fundamental ordering of social relations so that those things necessary for social survival can be produced and distributed in some predictable fashion\\" and an ideological process so that there can be a \\"...development of values, beliefs, and ideas related to the concrete tasks of production and distribution.\\"(p. 6). Thus, society must develop the apparatus of law creation, law enforcement and punishment and the system must be acceptable to the majority of those who live in the community. If the laws do not match the general mores, their enforcement will be a source of friction and disharmony. Conformity to the social order must, for the most part, be self-enforced. #For the times when self-enforcement fails, society must create a legal order. This part of the process sees the centralisation of power within the institutions of the political state. Some states justified the criminalization process as demonstrating their concerns about safety and security, the policy of control, policing, criminal justice, and penal practice. The modern state is decentralising and privatising its functions. This is changing the character and content of the remaining institutions of the state which must now work co-operatively with other for-profit agencies. #The political order must realign so that the remaining political entities such as legislatures and judges set agreed targets for state control and then produce actual outputs of the legal order, i.e. of people defined as criminal and processed through that system. ==Ontological basis of crime== Put in the most simple terms, ontology deals with or establishes the clear grounds for being. (Heidegger, Martin, Being and Time, introduction, referencing Plato's Parmenides.) In some of the traditional schools, such as those of the post-1688 English or Americans (many of the writings of the American Founding Fathers, but especially The Federalist) and their Dutch predecessors (see Kossmann, E. H. Political Thought in the Dutch Republic, 2004) ontology proper is deemed beyond the scope of legal thought, in accord with the modern distinction between society and state (which some consider based in the distinction the Romans made between themselves and their Italian allies, the socii, but not given the theoretical articulation we recognize today until emphasized by Thomas Hobbes' Leviathan. See state.) However, some classical theorists, such as Aristotle, in his Politics and Metaphysics, and to a lesser degree in his Topics, suggest that the distinction is at least problematic. One need consider no further than the claim that man is a political animal to see this is so. As a political animal, man has come to see himself as possessed of rights,UN Human Rights Council, http://www.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/ whether these are the Rights of Englishmen of old, or the universal human rights advocated vigorously toward establishment today through the matrix of commercialism.International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/a_cescr.htm. At least in the today dominant American model, deprivation of right amounts to injury (consider especially Justice Stevens dissenting opinion in Castle Rock v. Gonzales), and injury—so goes the prevailing theory—amounts, when coupled with requisite intent, in most cases, to crime, when it does not admit of civil redress. Thus, again in simple terms, and to the extent that human beings are indeed political beings, crime does seem to have an ontological basis. (For one approach to the question of criminal ontology, see \\"Understanding Crime and Social Control in Market Economies: Looking Back and Moving Forward\\" by Robert Bohm in Jeffrey Ian Ross, ed. Cutting the Edge: Current Perspectives in Radical/Critical Criminology and Criminal Justice. Westport, Conn: Praeger, 1998.) This, further, seems to hold if ontology itself is divided into political and trans- or supra- or meta- political ontology—i.e., what once was the realm of Christian theology. Of course, it does not matter whether that theology is Christian or belonging to some other apolitical belief. The point is that one may, with some justice, argue persuasively that being is divided. This need not, however, force the question of meta-political crimes. Our purposes here, in this article, are limited to the political. For the question in general see Ontology. Baker argues that only objective harms and other objective bad consequences (or actions in the case of inchoate and endangerment offenses) are prima facie criminalizable. By other bad consequences Baker means privacy violations and conduct that does not necessarily result in tangible harm, but does result in unwanted consequences. Baker argues that the privacy violations that result from being forced to receive unwanted obscene information in public places (exhibitionism) would amount to a sufficient bad consequence for the purposes of invoking the criminal law, but argues that proportionate punishment means that such conduct should only be punished with fines rather than jail terms. ==See also== * Decriminalization, the reversal of criminalization * Overcriminalization * Crime in the United States#Number and growth of criminal laws * Criminalization of homelessness * Zero tolerance ==ReferencesFurther reading== * *Baker, Dennis J.

Inspired by Italian fresco painting and the Post-Impressionists, the artists decorated the walls, doors and furniture at Charleston. The walled garden was redesigned in a style reminiscent of southern Europe, with mosaics, box hedges, gravel pathways and ponds, but with a touch of Bloomsbury humour in the placing of the statuary. > \\"It's most lovely, very solid and simple, with ... perfectly flat windows > and wonderful tiled roofs. The pond is most beautiful, with a willow at one > side and a stone or flint wall edging it all round the garden part, and a > little lawn sloping down to it, with formal bushes on it.\\" — Vanessa Bell The rooms on show form a complete example of the decorative art of the Bloomsbury artists: murals, painted furniture, ceramics, objects from the Omega Workshops, paintings and textiles. The collection includes work by Auguste Renoir, Picasso, Derain, Matthew Smith, Sickert, Stephen Tomlin (1901–1937) and Eugène Delacroix. ==Garden== Charleston's walled garden was created by Vanessa Bell and Duncan Grant to designs by Roger Fry. Together they transformed vegetable plots and hen runs, essential to the household during the First World War, into a quintessential planted garden mixing Mediterranean influences with cottage garden planting. In the 1920s a grid of gravel paths gave structure to beds of plants chosen by Grant and Bell for their intense colour and silver foliage. These became the subject of many still lifes over their long residence at Charleston. Dora Carrington wrote of the garden, \\"Never, never have I seen quite such a wonderful place! ... What excellent things there will be to paint in that garden with the pond and buildings.\\" Part of the garden’s sense of luxuriance and surprise comes from the variety of sculpture it contains. Classical forms sit side by side with life-size works by Quentin Bell, mosaic pavements and tile edged pools. The orchard offers shade from the sun and the pond a focus for tranquil contemplation. Above all this was a summer garden for playing and painting, an enchanted retreat from London life. As Vanessa Bell wrote in 1936: \\"The house seems full of young people in very high spirits, laughing a great deal at their own jokes ... lying about in the garden which is simply a dithering blaze of flowers and butterflies and apples.\\" ==Charleston Trust== Seen from the south-east The Charleston Trust is a charity set up in 1980 to restore and maintain the home of the Bloomsbury Group artists for the benefit of the public. The unique collection at Charleston is illustrative of the art and lifestyle of the influential Bloomsbury Group and has been on show to the public since 1986. Charleston attracts visitors from the local community as well as the rest of the UK and abroad. ==Covid-19 Emergency Appeal== Seen from the south-east The Covid-19 pandemic has had a devastating financial impact on Charleston which ordinarily receives no public funding, and relies on income through ticket sales and spend in its shop and café. Charleston remains closed to the public and the charity has launched an Emergency Appeal to secure its future and raise funds to support the ongoing costs of preserving the house, collections and gardens. ==Further reading== *Bell, Quentin, Virginia Nicholson and Alen MacWeeney (2004).

It drains a rural area of the northern Green Mountains along the Canada–US border northeast of Lake Champlain, and an area of Quebec's Eastern Townships. The South Branch rises in Vermont and runs generally from southeast to northwest; the North Branch rises in Lake d'Argent in Eastman, Quebec, and runs from north to south. The North Branch and the South Branch join at Highwater, Quebec, just downriver from North Troy, Vermont. The river then runs in Quebec for approximately , re-entering Vermont at Richford and thence to Lake Champlain's Missisquoi Bay. Fairfield Swamp (Vermont), Black Creek tributary of the Missisquoi ==Etymology== According to US Natural Resources Conservation Service, Missisquoi Soil – Missisquoi is derived from the Abenaki word masipskoik, which means \\"where there is flint\\" or \\"where flint is\\". The name originates from an Abenaki chert quarry located near Missisquoi Bay on Lake Champlain.Natural Resources Conservation Service, US Department of Agriculture According to the \\"Commission de toponymie du Québec\\" (Quebec board of place names), the term \\"missisquoi\\" in Abenaki means \\"multitudes of water birds\\", which takes on this river all its meaning. The traditional indigenous variant of this toponym is \\"Wazowategok\\", meaning \\"to the river that turns around\\". The toponym \\"Rivière Missisquoi\\" was formalized on December 5, 1968 at the Commission de toponymie du Québec.Commission de toponymie du Québec - Bank of Place Names - Missisquoi River. ==Course== The Missisquoi River rises in western Orleans County, Vermont, northwest of Lowell, Vermont, at an altitude of . This source is located next to route 58 and next to Belvidere Mountain. This source proves the be the continuity of the Burgess Branch (coming from the southwest). From its source, the Missisquoi River flows over , with a drop of , according to the following segments: Upper course (in Vermont) (segment of , with a drop of ) * towards the north-east, by collecting the East Branch Missisquoi River (coming from the south-east), then by forming a hook towards the north-west and branches off towards the west at the end of the segment, up to the McAllister Pond outlet (coming from the northwest); * first towards the north, then towards the north-east by forming a loop towards the north, followed by a mouth towards the south, then curve towards the east, collecting the discharge (coming from the south) from two lakes, to Le Clair Brook (coming from the east); * to the north by collecting the Snider Brook (coming from the northwest) where the course of the river enters the \\"Missisquoi & Trout Wild and Scenic River\\", crossing the route 100, to Mineral Spring Brook (coming from the southeast). Note: This natural park formed by numerous marsh areas continues each side of the Missisquoi River, up to the Canada-US border; * first towards the east, then branching north after having made a loop towards the east, collecting the Lilly Branch (coming from the east) and the Taft Brook ( coming from the southwest), forming a loop towards the northwest, then moving towards the northeast to collect the Beetle Brook (coming from the southeast), up to route 100; * towards the north by collecting a stream (coming from the east), by forming some serpentines and by collecting the Buybee Brook (coming from the west), up to the discharge of Jay Branch (from the west); * towards the north by forming some serpentines, then curving towards the west and finally towards the north, until route 105; * towards the north by cutting the railway, bending towards the east, then branching out towards the west by forming a few streamers along the border, up to the Canada-US border.River segments measured using the US National Map In upper course, Missisquoi River flows north past Troy and North Troy, crosses Big Falls State Park and the village of Lowell. Intermediate course (in Quebec) (segment of , with a drop of ) * towards the north-west, forming a large detour to collect the Mud stream (coming from the north) and some areas of streamers, passing in front of the village of Highwater where it passes under the road bridge, to the confluence of the Missisquoi River North (coming from the north); * to the west by forming six curves to the north and a loop to the south, collecting the Ruiter stream (coming from the north), up to the Brock River (from the northwest); * to the southwest by collecting the Dufour stream (coming from the south-east), the Courser stream (coming from the northwest) and the Davis stream (coming from the northwest), up to the Canada-US border.

It flows west through northern Franklin County approximately south of the Canada–US border, past the small communities of Richford, East Berkshire, Enosburg Falls, and Sheldon Springs. On the west side of Interstate 89 in northwestern Franklin County, it turns to the north, passing through Missisquoi National Wildlife Refuge in its lower before entering the south end of Missisquoi Bay, an arm of Lake Champlain that straddles the Canada-Vermont border. In the last segment of (ie from Dead Creek) in Swanton, the Missisquoi River crosses a large area of marsh located on a peninsula (stretching over ) westwards and having a width of ). ==Tributaries== Named tributaries in Vermont are: Taft Brook in Westfield, Beetle Brook in Troy, Jay Brook in Jay, Stanhope Brook in Richford, the Trout River in Montgomery, Tyler Branch in Enosburg, Black Creek in Sheldon and Fairfield, and Hungerford Brook in Swanton and Highgate. ==History== The Abenaki people used the river as a canoe route between the Lake Champlain drainage and the Saint-François River drainage. The river supports canoe traffic from Lake Champlain to Mansonville, Quebec, where there is a falls. From there, an ancient portage (carrying place) runs to Perkins Landing on Lake Memphremagog. Abenaki groups met seasonally on the bluffs at Eagle Point in Newport, Vermont, to catch and dry whitefish. The Missisquoi Valley was among the first areas of Southern Quebec's Eastern Townships to be settled by Loyalist refugees, who came upriver from camps on Missisquoi Bay. In September 2008 the government of the United States approved a bill to study the Missisquoi and Trout rivers for potential designation as Wild and Scenic Rivers. It passed the House with bi-partisan support, and the rivers could potentially receive permanent protection in the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System. River sections being considered for Wild and Scenic designation are as follows: * of the upper Missisquoi, Franklin County, including Enosburg, Berkshire and Richford * of the upper Missisquoi, Orleans County, including Troy, Westfield, Jay and Lowell * of the Trout River, Franklin County, including Berkshire and Montgomery A Study Committee composed of local appointees and partner organizations has been evaluating the Wild and Scenic Designation of the upper Missisquoi and Trout rivers. The group's mission is to facilitate the transfer of information among the ten communities through which the rivers flow - Berkshire, Town of Enosburgh, Village of Enosburg Falls, Jay, Lowell, Montgomery, Village of North Troy, Richford, Westfield, and the Town of Troy, and evaluate the potential benefits of the Wild & Scenic designation. At the end of the study in 2012, the committee is scheduled to provide an assessment as to whether the rivers fit designation criteria and whether designation is supported, and make recommendations of voluntary strategies for protection of the rivers' resources. As a result of the National Park Service and Study Committee recommendation, of the Missisquoi River and Trout River were added to the National Wild and Scenic River System on December 19, 2014. == Cross-border valley bridge == The Valley Bridge spans the Missisquoi River on a north-west/south-east axis. This bridge is located on the Canada-US border, between the two customs posts. The northwest part of this bridge is located in the town of Sutton, near the hamlet of Glen Sutton, in Quebec. The other end of the bridge is located in the municipality of Richford, in the state of Vermont in the United States, near the hamlet of East Richford. This bridge serves sector residents and vacationers transiting between Canada and the United States. This triangular metal beam bridge has two spans: one of 16 m and the other of 46.5 meters. According to a souvenir plaque affixed at each end of the bridge, the manufacturer of the metal superstructure of the Vallée bridge is the American company Pittsburg Des Moines Steel Co. The substructure was built by Cenedella & Compagny, from Milford to Massachusetts. Construction contracts had been awarded in 1929. This bridge has been listed since 1990 in the National Register of Historic Places in the United States. This metal bridge replaces the old concrete bridge destroyed by the November 1927 flood.Document \\"Le pont de la Vallée (P-01522) à Sutton\\", Transports Québec, Direction de l'Est-de-la-Montérégie, March 2011, heritage assessment report. ==Natural history== In 2016, about 60% of male smallmouth bass bore eggs (androgyny).

The term dates to February 1949. ==History== Panty raids were the first college craze after World War II, following the 1930s crazes of goldfish swallowing or seeing how many students could fit in a phone booth. The mock battles that ensued between male and female students echoed the riotous battles between freshmen and upperclassmen, which were an annual ritual at many colleges in the 20th century. The first documented incident occurred on February 25, 1949, at Augustana College, Rock Island, Illinois. Around 125 men entered the Woman's Building; the first party entered through heating tunnels beneath the building. Once inside, they unlocked the door for the remaining raiders to enter, locked the house mother in her apartment, and cut the light and phone lines. Although a few women reported missing undergarments, the goal was to cause commotion. The police arrived, and although no pranksters were charged, the news traveled, making headlines in the Chicago Tribune, Stars and Stripes, Time magazine, and the New York Times. The next incident was on March 21, 1952, when University of Michigan students raided a dormitory, which sparked panty raids across the nation.Winling, LaDale. Student Housing, City Politics, and the University of Michigan, 2007. Penn State's first raid involved 2,000 males marching on the women's dorms on April 8, 1952, cheered on by the women, who opened doors and windows and tossed out lingerie. By the end of the 1952 spring term the \\"epidemic\\" had spread to 52 campuses. At a number of colleges, panty raids functioned as a humorous, ad hoc protest against curfews and entry restrictions that barred male visitors from women's dormitories. This was particularly the case at colleges that had recently started admitting women in large numbers for the first time after World War II, where the role of female students on campus had not yet been worked out. At some colleges the large, leaderless crowds that gathered around panty raids were co-opted by student politicians into protest and activism against dorm curfews and parietals. These stirrings of student protest against restrictive campus rules fed the sudden emergence in the late 1950s of liberal activist parties in student government, such as SLATE at Berkeley. Generally, the women welcomed the raiders and in some cases raided men's colleges such as Georgetown University in Washington, D.C. At the University of Washington, though, raiders broke windows, and female students at Columbia College and Stephens College fought raiders from the University of Missouri. Raiding continued, such as the raid by Princeton University men on Westminster Choir College in spring 1953. The University of Nebraska was credited with the first panty raid of 1955, when hundreds raided the women's dorms, resulting in injuries and seven suspensions. The University of California, Berkeley had a 3,000-man panty raid in May 1956, which resulted in $10,000 damage (about $92,000 in 2018).Sann, Paul, Fads, Follies, and Delusions of the American People. Crown Publishers, 1967. p. 294. At the University of Michigan, panty raids were associated with fall football pep rallies in addition to being a spring ritual in the 1950s and early 1960s. In his 2005 autobiography, Dinner with Mobutu: A Chronicle of My Life and Times, Jasper \\"Jake\\" Smith, III (born 1935), a son of State Representative Jasper K. Smith of Vivian in Caddo Parish, describes a humorous attempt in 1957 by Ralph L. Ropp, the president of Louisiana Tech University in Ruston, to halt a panty raid on his campus: > It had been arranged on a late spring night that some of the women in the > female dormitory would leave a door unlocked so that the \\"raiders\\" could get > inside. ... As we approached the dormitory, the college president, Ralph > Ropp, the Dean of Men, and a large group of policemen confronted us. Someone > had tipped them off. The crowd started dispersing, re-forming in smaller > groups, hesitant about giving up the adventure. President Ropp was > apoplectic, running from group to group threatening to expel students and > send their names to the draft board—a threat that made all-draft age males > more than a little nervous. Old Ralph got a little too close to one of the > male dormitories, and someone dumped a bucket of water from the third floor > on his head. So the night was not a total loss. ... The spring ritual continued into the 1960s. In 1961, three students were expelled from the University of Mississippi at Oxford, Mississippi for panty raids. By the 1970s, mixed dorms and less inhibited attitudes to sexual intercourse on campus led to fading of panty raids. However, in the 1984 film Revenge of the Nerds, the Tri-Lambs stage a panty raid on the Pi Delta Pis sorority. A panty raid was also depicted in the television show SpongeBob SquarePants. ==See also== * Panty tree * Phonebooth stuffing * Gnomes (South Park) ==References== Category:1950s fads and trends Category:Practical jokes Category:Student culture in the United States Category:Undergarments Category:Theft ","title":"Panty raid"},{"id":"1997431","text":"The Upper Hudson River Railroad was a heritage railroad that operated from 1999 to 2010 in the upper Hudson River in New York State's Adirondack Mountains. Primary motive power consisted of Southwind Rail Travel Limited ex- Delaware & Hudson locomotive No. 5019. ==History== The Upper Hudson River Railroad uses the Adirondack Railway line built by Thomas C. Durant in 1871 to North Creek. North Creek station is where Theodore Roosevelt learned he was to become president of the United States of America after President William McKinley was assassinated in 1901. During World War II, magnetite, ilmenite, and titanium were shipped by rail from Tahawus by the Delaware and Hudson Railway (D&H;). The D&H;, which acquired the Adirondack Line from William West Durant in 1889, ran through this region until 1989 when the mine at Tahawus closed. The D&H; last operated Monday through Saturday scheduled passenger service in the 1950s; reduced to summer service by the mid-1950s.'Official Guide of the Railways,' January 1950, Delaware & Hudson section, Table 5'Official Guide of the Railways,' December 1954, Delaware & Hudson section, Table 3, \\"NOTE. Train service on Branch Line Saratoga Springs to North Creek discontinued until June 18, 1955\\" Regular service having entirely ended by 1957, with only freight service remaining.'Official Guide of the Railways,' December 1957, Delaware & Hudson section, Table 3'Official Guide of the Railways,' August 1958, Delaware & Hudson section, Table 3 In 1998 the right of way was purchased by Warren County with plans to operate an excursion train to improve tourism and economic development in the area. In 1999, the Upper Hudson River Railroad was formed and introduced an excursion train that ran south from North Creek to Riverside Station in Riparius. The track from Riverside Station south to Hadley was rebuilt by 2007. The Upper Hudson River Railroad celebrated its tenth year with a run, dubbed \\"40 Miler\\", that started at the high trestle in Hadley and ended at the restored turntable in North Creek. The 2007 season included excursions to Ranch, the 40 miler to Hadley, and a Payroll Robbery. Various actors playing the roles of clowns, hobos, and a musician/storyteller join the excursions. ===End of operations=== The Upper Hudson River Railroad lost their contract with Warren County on December 31, 2010. On April 8, 2011, it was announced that Iowa Pacific Holdings would take over operation of the route effective July 1, 2011. As part of the agreement, the Iowa Pacific agreed to operate a minimum of 182 tourist-oriented passenger trains over the line. Iowa Pacific began operating trains on July 12, 2011 as the Saratoga and North Creek Railroad. Unlike the Upper Hudson River Railroad, the Saratoga and North Creek operates over the entire distance between the Upper Hudson River Railroad's former terminal in North Creek and the station in Saratoga Springs, which allows connections with Amtrak's Adirondack and Ethan Allen Express services. An article dated May 14, 2012 in the Post Star titled Federal board OKs rail freight line between North Creek and Newcomb stated, \\"The operator of the Saratoga & North Creek Railway can move forward with plans to reopen the Tahawus rail line between North Creek and Newcomb and offer freight service, U.S. Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., announced Monday. The federal Surface Transportation Board on Monday approved a request for 'common carrier' status on the line, which allows Iowa Pacific Holdings, the rail line operator, to reopen the line.\\" This action will result in freight traffic running over the former UHRR line.http://poststar.com/news/local/federal-board-oks-rail-freight-line- between-north-creek-and/article_b26d8222-9e0f-11e1-982c-0019bb2963f4.html ==Stations== *North Creek - North Creek, New York *Riverside Station - Riparius, New York (NRHP) ==ReferencesExternal links== * Upper Hudson River Railroad Category:Heritage railroads in New York (state) Category:Hudson River Category:Tourist attractions in Warren County, New York Category:Defunct New York (state) railroads Category:Railway companies established in 1999 Category:Railway companies disestablished in 2010 Category:1999 establishments in New York (state) ","title":"Upper Hudson River Railroad"},{"id":"1997439","text":"Marvel Games is the publishing brand for video games based on Marvel properties, and is the video games division of Marvel Entertainment.

He is coauthor with Charles Alan Wright of Federal Practice and Procedure, the legendary treatise in the field. This multi-volume series is an essential reference for judges and lawyers. Miller is also one of the nation's most distinguished legal scholars in the areas of civil litigation, copyright and unfair competition, and privacy, having written more than 40 books and many articles, including The Assault on Privacy: Computers, Data Banks, and Dossiers (University of Michigan Press, 1971), one of the first books warning of the threat to privacy posed by modern information technology; Civil Procedure: Cases and Materials (with J.H. Friedenthal, J. Sexton, and H. Hershkoff; 1967–2008 (ten editions)); Federal Practice and Procedure (with C.A. Wright, some with E.H. Cooper, M.K. Kane, and R. Marcus; 1968-2008, West Publishing Co. (more than thirty-five volumes)); Intellectual Property: Patents, Trademarks and Copyright in a Nutshell (with M.H. Davis, 1998–2011, West Publishing Co. (four editions)), among many others. In 1999 Professor Miller made videotapes lectures for Concord Law School, an online law school, privately owned by the Washington Post Co.'s Kaplan Educational Centers, and videotaped 11 lectures for a course on civil procedure. To him, Mr. Miller says, the Web represents what television represented when he started doing his public-affairs television show on legal issues, titled \\"Miller's Court,\\" in 1979—the next frontier for teaching law to the general public. In October 2008, Professor Miller became Special Counsel to Milberg LLP and heads the firm’s appellate practice group. Since then, he has argued before the U.S. Supreme Court on behalf of Milberg clients in Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues & Rights,T. Mauro, Corporate Defendants Prevail at Court Legal Times, June 22, 2007. and was involved in the briefing in opposition to the writ of certiorari in Pfizer, Inc. v. Abdullahi.Brief in Opposition, Pfizer, Inc. v. Abdullahi, No. 09-34 (August 10, 2009). Retrieved April 24, 2019. In addition, Milberg’s Supreme Court practice group was a key player in the Merck & Co., Inc. v. Reynolds matter, a case in which it serves as co-lead counsel. In August 2013, Professor Miller joined the Lanier Law Firm as Of Counsel.Arthur R. Miller becomes of counsel at the Lanier Law Firm August 20, 2013. Retrieved August 27, 2013. Miller is the recipient of many awards, including eight honorary doctorates, three American Bar Association Gavel Awards, and a Special Recognition Gavel Award for promoting public understanding of the law. Queen Elizabeth II with the advice of her government bestowed on him the prestigious honor of Commander of the Order of the British Empire (2011). This honor recognizes Miller’s service to the United Kingdom by his gift of more than 1,800 Japanese woodblock prints by nineteenth-century artist Utagawa Kuniyoshi to the American Friends of the British Museum; these were exhibited at the Royal Academy in the spring of 2009. It also recognizes his more than fifteen years spent moderating public policy issues and dialogues, called Hypotheticals on BBC TV and Granada Television.Queen Elizabeth II Names Prof. Arthur R. Miller Commander of the Order of the British Empire at New York University Law School (undated) These dialogues were modeled on the well-known Fred Friendly dialogues, broadcast on PBS, for one of which Miller won an Emmy (\\"The Constitution: That Delicate Balance\\"). He served for two decades as the on-air legal editor for ABC's Good Morning America. His weekly television program titled Miller's Court was aired on Boston's WCVB-TV from 1979–1988 and was the first American TV show dedicated to the exploration of legal issues.

He also sits on the advisory board of H5, a firm specializing in electronic discovery for legal cases. Miller has argued cases in all of the United States courts of appeals and several before the U.S. Supreme Court. He has worked in the public interest in the areas of privacy, computers, copyright, and the courts and has served as a member and Reporter of the Advisory Committee of Civil Rules of the Judicial Conference of the U.S. by appointment of two Chief Justices of the United States, as Reporter and Advisor to the American Law Institute, as a member of a special advisory group to the Chief Justice of the United States, and as a member of various American Bar Association committees. Miller was also appointed as commissioner on the United States Commission on New Technological Uses of Copyrighted Work by President Ford. Miller has for fifty years enlisted the help of some of his students as research assistants, a notoriously demanding position for first and second year law students. Similar to the relationship between a judge and his or her clerks, Miller has stayed in touch with many of his former research assistants and many have gone on to important positions as federal and state judges, law professors, Supreme Court clerks, and as partners at prestigious law firms. New York University President John Sexton was one of Miller's research assistants at Harvard, as was Richard B. Bernstein, now a distinguished adjunct professor of law at New York Law School. Other former students include Chief Justice John Roberts, former New York Governor Eliot Spitzer, and Senator Russ Feingold of Wisconsin. ==Miller in pop culture== Miller was one of the real figures on whom Scott Turow based the pseudonymous Harvard Law Professor Rudolph Perini in Scott Turow's bestselling memoir of his first year in law school, One L. Although Turow has never acknowledged or denied the connection, Miller has long thought himself the real Perini, and conventional wisdom in the legal community has largely concurred. In the book, Perini is depicted as brilliant but imperious, with a caustic wit and a flair for the dramatic. Readers of the book familiar with Harvard Law School and the history of Turow's three years at HLS have deduced that Turow took Miller, whose civil procedure course he took, and assigned his fictional counterpart Perini to teach contracts, and he also took Duncan Kennedy, his contracts professor, and transformed him into the civil procedure professor Nicky \\"Beat Nick\\" Morris. In one of Miller's television specials from the early 1980s covering censorship, he posed the hypothetical case of a heavy metal band, which he named \\"The Sick Puppies\\". Sick Puppies is now the name of a real band from Australia, playing grunge and alternative rock. In the late 1980s, Miller's caustic classroom comments at Harvard frequently topped the \\"Back Bench Quotation Poll,\\" a feature in the Back Bench Reporter, one of the premier law school section newsletters of its day. Several years ago, NYU Law Revue created a spoof of Miller in a South Park style, entitled “What Would Arthur Miller Do”. In 2011, students from NYU's Law Revue created a hip hop tribute to Miller called \\"A. Milley\\" based on Lil' Wayne's \\"A Milli.\\" The video can be found here. ==Miller as art collector== Miller is also known for his collection of wood block prints by the nineteenth century Japanese artist Utagawa Kuniyoshi, shown in 2009 at the Royal Academy in London, as well as at the Japan Society (2010) in New York City. In both venues, the exhibition received rave reviews. ==ReferencesExternal links== *NYU Faculty Biography * Category:1934 births Category:American legal scholars Category:University of Rochester alumni Category:Harvard Law School alumni Category:Harvard Law School faculty Category:New York University faculty Category:University of Minnesota Law School faculty Category:Living people Category:New York University School of Law faculty Category:Scholars of civil procedure law ","title":"Arthur R.

At the time there were many pop groups in Mexico with four members, so Federica and André decided to add longtime friends René and Daniela, bringing the total to six. Shortly after the addition of these final two members, they did a cover for the group The Party. The song was called Encontré El Amor (I Found Love). Shortly after the release of Encontré El Amor, the group recorded this and another song, Somos Tan Differentes (We are so different) at Gil Brothers studios, forming a two song demo tape Eager to show their talent, they were given the chance to sing their two songs at a popular club. However, they were ill received by the audience and ultimately booed off the stage. Their second show came at the end of 1993 at a kindergarten where Federica worked as a teacher's assistant. For this show, they remade their two songs, giving them a more child friendly feel. This event marked their careers, as they realized they could find greater favor among younger audiences. Despite their hopes however, they were initially turned down by several producers, such as Cha, Claudio Yarto and Aleks Syntek. It was not until Federica accidentally came across the phone number for Televisa that they found success. After calling Luis de Llano, the only music producer of the network, they were asked to come in for a meeting. Luis told them about a singing talent show called Valores Juveniles, and suggested they spend a few months practicing for it. They then signed a contract for one album with Polygram Music, and soon after their first album, Kabah, was finished. They then went on to win the talent show with their first song, \\"Encontré El Amor.\\" The album, which was officially released in 1994, contained four songs written by the group and was a success among the younger population. ===1996 - 2000: Signing with Polygram Music, Second album \\"La Calle De Las Sirenas\\", Third album \\"XNE\\"=== The first album was such a success that Polygram Music decided to sign them and gave them a contract to make two more albums. They started recording a second album which would be titled La Calle De Las Sirenas (The Street Of The Mermaids). It was released in 1996 and was recorded in Los Angeles. La calle de Las Sirenas opened many doors for the group, and carried them to international fame. 1998's Esperanto followed, selling a record of 100,000 copies in the first week. It featured the singles \\"Mai, Mai\\", \\"Una Ilusión\\", and \\"Esperanto\\". In 2000, the next follow-up, XNE, led the group to a more conceptualized image and somewhat darker sound. It also contained \\"Amigas y Rivales\\", the theme song for the Mexican soap opera of the same name. === 2002 - 2005: Signed with Warner Music, Fourth album \\"La Vida Que Va\\", Fifth album \\"El Pop\\", and disbandment === In 2002, they returned to a lighter sound with La Vida Que Va, which was recorded in Norway under the Warner Music label and produced by Ole Evenrude. La Vuelta al Mundo, was released in 2003, and the band's final album, El Pop, was released in 2005. El Pop featured acoustic versions of a few of their greatest-hits, as well as two new songs. A farewell tour took them all across North America, concluding with a final show on December 31, 2005 on the bay of Acapulco, Mexico. ===2014 - 2015: Reunion Tour with OV7=== Late in 2014 Kabah announced, along with OV7, a reunion tour scheduled for 2015. The Ov7 Kabah Tour, has been a major success in Mexico and Latin America with over 60 shows played all over more than 20 cities around Mexico. In 2015, they issued OV7 Kabah en Vivo. It was released on August 21, 2015. === 2018 - Present: 90's Pop Tour, Signed with Bobo Production, Rainbow Tour subunit === Kabah embarked on a world concert tour called \\"90s Pop Tour\\" in 2018 and 2019, along with OV7, JNS, Magneto, Calo Mercurio and The Sacados. During early 2020, Kabah had signed a contract with BOBO Production to begin promotions. By March, it was revealed that a Sub-unit was introduced which consisted all the members of Kabah and JNS who would go by Rainbow Tour. They opened up there Instagram page and began promotions for concert events taking place in Mexico. == Members == Most of Kabah's members are still active. * María José, better known as \\"Josa\\", released her solo album on March 30, 2007 for the record label Warner Music.

Born in Omaha, Nebraska, he spent his early years in San Francisco, California, and Cincinnati, Ohio, graduating from Woodward High School in 1960. Today, Stoltzman is part of the faculty list at the New England Conservatory and Boston University. Stoltzman is perhaps the best-known clarinetist who primarily plays classical music. He has played with over 100 orchestras, as well as with many chamber groups and in many solo recitals. Stoltzman has received numerous awards and has produced an extensive discography. His virtuosity and musicianship have made him a highly sought-after concert artist. In addition to classical repertoire, Stoltzman also plays jazz. Some of his recordings, such as his album New York Counterpoint, feature both jazz and modern music. In 1983, Stoltzman commissioned composer/arranger Clare Fischer to write a symphonic work using Duke Ellington and Billy Strayhorn themes. The result was The Duke, Swee'pea and Me, an eleven-minute orchestral work which Stoltzman performed worldwide. ==Early years and education== Stoltzman's father worked for the Western Pacific Railroad and moved his family to San Francisco, California, soon after Richard was born. Stoltzman's first exposure to music came through his father, an avid fan of big band music. Stoltzman's father played the big band music of the 1940s at home on the radio and performed in a dance band during his spare time. Stoltzman began studying the clarinet at the age of eight with a teacher at a local school, and he began playing with his father in the Stewart Memorial United Presbyterian Sunday School Orchestra and at community functions within a few years. When Stoltzman was in junior high school, he began developing the jazz techniques of improvisation and enjoyed jamming with his father at home. Benny Goodman was his earliest musical mentor, and remained a strong influence throughout his career. Stoltzman told Allan Kozinn of the New York Times, \\"(When) I was seven years old ... I found these wonderful cylindrical objects in a nice leather case. I enjoyed playing with them ... and I vaguely remember dangling them from the second-story window of our house. That caused quite a stir, because they turned out to be my father's clarinets. But instead of punishing me, he decided that I had an interest in the instrument and rented an indestructible metal clarinet for me to start on.\\" Stoltzman earned a bachelor's degree from Ohio State University with a double major in music and mathematics. He then studied with Professor Keith Wilson at the Yale School of Music, where he received the Master of Music degree. He worked toward a doctoral degree at Columbia University. He has been a longtime student of master clarinet pedagogue Kalmen Opperman of New York. Together, they founded the Clarinet Summit, a semi-regular international gathering of clarinetists which has taken place since the 1990s. He has also recorded with the Kalmen Opperman Clarinet Choir. ==Performance and recording== Stoltzman has appeared as a soloist with numerous major symphonies, at international jazz festivals, and with stars such as Mel Tormé, George Shearing, Judy Collins, Woody Herman, Wayne Shorter, Chick Corea, Claude Bolling and others. He was a founding member of the chamber music group TASHI in 1973. In 1993, he was featured in the BBC series \\"Concerto!\\" He was the Guest artist with The Children's Orchestra Society at Alice Tully Hall of Lincoln Center in 2004. He has also given important recitals at Carnegie Hall and the Hollywood Bowl. His discography includes nearly 40 releases, several of them with TASHI. Stoltzman is noted for his double lip embouchure, wide vibrato, and ability to mimic the sound of a human voice on the clarinet. He combines traditional and contemporary classical and jazz material with his own unorthodox style. In August 1993, Stoltzman was featured in \\"Concerto!\\", a six-part television series featuring host Dudley Moore, conductor Michael Tilson Thomas and the London Symphony Orchestra. \\"Concerto!\\", created by the producers of the widely acclaimed \\"Orchestra\\" series featuring Moore and Sir Georg Solti, was aired on The Learning Channel and on England's Channel Four, and continues to be broadcast worldwide. The program featuring Stoltzman has been praised by critics and audiences alike and was the recipient of an Emmy Award in the International Performing Arts category. Stoltzman has played with many widely recognized musicians, including Yo-Yo Ma, Richard Goode and Emanuel Ax. He has made an effort to play new music for the clarinet, and has had several works composed for him. Composers include: Toru Takemitsu (\\"Waves\\" and a concerto for clarinet and orchestra), Steve Reich (\\"New York Counterpoint\\"), Lukas Foss, Roberto Carnevale, and Einar Englund (clarinet concertos). Stoltzman is known for his longtime collaboration with composer William Thomas McKinley, and his work has been featured frequently in recent years on Navona Records and MMC Recording. A review in the New York Times said: \\"His mastery of the clarinet and his impeccable musicianship are no secret by now, but one who has not heard him play for a time can easily forget how rich and fluid the instrument can sound from top to bottom of its range. If Mr. Stoltzman is not one of a kind, who might the others be?\\" ==Awards and recognitions== Grammy Award for Best Chamber Music Performance: *Emanuel Ax, Yo-Yo Ma & Richard Stoltzman for Brahms/Beethoven/Mozart: Clarinet Trios (1996) *Richard Goode & Richard Stoltzman for Brahms: The Sonatas for Clarinet & Piano, Op. 120 (1983) ;Other awards *On 1 September 2005, Stoltzman was presented with the Yale School of Music's Sanford Medal.Playbill Arts *In 1986 he was the first wind player to be awarded the Avery Fisher Prize. *He was inducted into the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2013. ==See also== * Clare Fischer ==ReferencesExternal links== *Hear Richard Stoltzman in concert from WGBH Boston *Richard Stoltzman interview by Bruce Duffie, 1994 * BACH & friends Documentary Category:1942 births Category:Living people Category:American classical clarinetists Category:American jazz clarinetists Category:Jazz musicians from Massachusetts Category:Grammy Award winners Category:Ohio State University alumni Category:Yale University alumni Category:Columbia University School of the Arts alumni Category:Musicians from Omaha, Nebraska Category:American people of German descent Category:Contemporary classical music performers Category:New England Conservatory faculty Category:Third stream clarinetists Category:People from Winchester, Massachusetts Category:Jazz musicians from Nebraska Category:Classical musicians from Massachusetts Category:20th-century clarinetists Category:21st-century clarinetists Category:Woodward High School (Cincinnati, Ohio) alumni ","title":"Richard Stoltzman"},{"id":"1997476","text":"The rubrospinal tract is a part of the nervous system. It is a part of the lateral indirect extra-pyramidal tract. ==Structure== In the midbrain, it originates in the magnocellular red nucleus, crosses to the other side of the midbrain, and descends in the lateral part of the brainstem tegmentum. In the spinal cord, it travels through the lateral funiculus of the spinal cord, coursing adjacent to the lateral corticospinal tract. ==Function== In humans, the rubrospinal tract is one of several major motor control pathways. It is smaller and has fewer axons than the corticospinal tract, suggesting that it is less important in motor control. It is one of the pathways for the mediation of involuntary movement, along with other extra- pyramidal tracts including the vestibulospinal, tectospinal, and reticulospinal tracts. The tract is responsible for large muscle movement regulation flexor and inhibiting extensor tone as well as fine motor control. It terminates primarily in the cervical and thoracic portions of the spinal cord, suggesting that it functions in upper limb but not in lower limb control. It is small and rudimentary in humans.

She was the wife of Chuza, who managed the household of Herod Antipas, the ruler of Galilee. Her name means \\"Yahweh has been gracious\\",Douglas, J. D. and Tenney, Merrill C., Zondervan Illustrated Bible Dictionary (2011), p. 742. a variation of the name \\"Anna\\" which means \\"grace\\" or \\"favour”. She is recognised as a saint in the Anglican, Eastern Orthodox, and Roman Catholic traditions. ==Joanna as one of Luke's witnesses== Joanna is shown as the wife of Chuza, steward to Herod Antipas while being listed as one of the women who \\"had been cured of evil spirits and infirmities\\" who accompanied Jesus and the Apostles, and \\"provided for Him from their substance\\" in . Theologian Adrian Hastings suggested that she could have been one of Luke's sources for information regarding the Herodian court.Hastings, Adrian. Prophet and witness in Jerusalem: a study of the teaching of St. Luke, (London; New York: Longmans, Green, 1958), p.38 As the wife of an important court official, she would have had sufficient means needed to travel and contribute to the support of Jesus and the disciples. Joanna is named among the women mentioned in Luke 24:10, who, along with Mary Magdalene and Mary, the mother of James, took spices to Jesus' tomb and found the stone rolled away and the tomb empty. The accounts in the other synoptic gospels do not mention Joanna as one of the group of women who observe Jesus' burial and testify to his Resurrection. ==Myrrhbearer== In Orthodox tradition, she is honored as Saint Joanna the Myrrhbearer (Greek Αγία Ιωάννα η Μυροφόρος) and is commemorated among the eight women who carried myrrh on the \\"Sunday of the Myrrhbearers\\", two Sundays after Pascha (Orthodox Easter). From this commemoration, in the revised Calendar of Saints of the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod she is commemorated as one of Myrrhbearers on August 3 together with Mary, the Mother of James the less and Jude and Salome.Philip H. Pfatteicher New Book of Festivals and Commemorations. Page 376. 2008. Although not mentioned by name, Joanna is most likely counted as one of the women who joined the disciples and Mary, the mother of the Lord, in the upper room in prayer. She was among the group of 120 who chose Matthias to fill the vacancy that was left by Judas, as well as being present on the Day of Pentecost.\\"Joanna\\", Coptic Orthodox Diocese of the Southern United States ===Identification with Junia === Both Richard J. Bauckham and Ben Witherington III conclude that the disciple Joanna is the same woman as the Christian Junia mentioned by Paul in his Epistle to the Romans (). Most early Greek manuscripts list the name Junia as feminine, with the consensus of New Testament scholarship agreeing that Junia was a woman.Al Wolters, \\"IOUNIAN (Romans 16:7) and the Hebrew name Yĕḥunnī,\\" JBL 127 (2008), 397. While this is possible, in Junia is mentioned along with Andronicus so they may be a husband and wife team like Priscilla and Aquila.Moo, Douglas, J. The Epistle to the Romans, (Grand Rapids, Michigan; Cambridge, UK: William B. Eerdmans, 1996), p. 923 If that is the case, it would be unlikely that \\"Junia\\" is another name for Joanna since Joanna's husband, according to , was Chuza. Though given her freedom to follow Jesus, she may well have been widowed and this was a subsequent marriage. ===Joanna granddaughter of Theophilus=== An ossuary has been discovered bearing the inscription, \\"Johanna, granddaughter of Theophilus, the High Priest.\\"D.

It is known for its dynamic chorus, aggressive vocals, and prominent drum beat. The song is predominately in triple meter, alternating between , and time. The guitar during the verse plays in using a 2+2+2 phrasing while the heavy part (\\"somewhere between the sacred silence and sleep\\") makes use of a hemiola with the guitar switching to a 3+3+3+3 pattern while the drums remain in compound duple meter until the bridge.

It is the main urban area of the Tangail District. The city is situated on the bank of the Louhajang River. It is the 23rd largest city in Bangladesh. ==Etymology== During the early 19th century, horse carts were the main transportation medium for carrying goods and passengers in the present-day city area. This would lead to traffic made up of long lines of horse carts. Thus, many believe the name Tangail originated from the Bengali word tanga, meaning horse carts. ==History== Tangail has been a popular local business center since the early 19th century. In 1860, the central area of the Greater Mymensingh District was shifted from Atia due to the fertile land and high elevation near the Louhajong River. This caused the district's name to change to Tangail.

In that election, eight ward commissioners from four wards were elected by the direct vote of the citizens of the city. The Subdivision Commissioner of Tangail during that time, Shashi Shekhar Dutt, was appointed as the first administrator of Tangail city. The city was poorly developed, with a lack of paved roads and roadside lamps. Thus, the regional Zamindars and subdivision board provided financial support to dig ponds, lakes, and canals. Those sources served the local people with a safe water supply. In the early 1900s, the Pourashava authority installed kerosene roadside lamps. The Pourashava gradually became populated in the first half of the 20th century. At that time, many tube wells were set up in the town. The main modes of transportation were horsecars and cattle in the town. Electricity was established in the town in the early 1930s. In the 1960s, paved roads were constructed in the town, connecting the city to Dhaka. Bridges, culverts, and water supply were installed at this time. In 1985, Tangail City was promoted from a C Class city to a B Class city. In 1989, the Pourashava was promoted to A-Class. In the 1990s, the city was financed by the Asian Development Bank and the Government of Bangladesh to develop water supply, sanitation, wastewater drainage, bus terminals, supermarkets, and other infrastructure. ==Sports== All important sports events in the city are held in Tangail Stadium, which is beside Bhashani Hall and Tangail Eidgah. The stadium has hosted national events. It is the home venue of Bangladesh Football Premier League club Team BJMC. It was converted into a cricket stadium in 2015. First Division Cricket is regularly hosted in this venue. ==Organization and Size== The total area of Tangail is 35.22 km2. The government of Bangladesh has planned to expand the city. After expansion, it will have a proposed area of 81.75 km2.http://tangailpourashava.gov.bd/page/article/90 The city consists of 18 wards and 64 mahallas until 2016. {| class=\\"wikitable\\" |- !

He was born in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. His father, Ernest Hamilton, was a lacrosse player who won a gold medal at the 1908 Summer Olympics. He was a student at the Montreal High School and he took a B.Sc from Sir George Williams University in business administration. He sat on Montreal City Council and the Executive Council of Montreal. He was elected to parliament in the 1953 election as a Progressive Conservative for the riding of Notre-Dame-de-Grâce. In his maiden speech to Parliament in November he accused the very conservative Liberal government led by Louis St. Laurent of being socialists. His criticisms were based on the government being corporatistic and taking an interest in private business activities. Following the 1957 election, he was appointed Postmaster General of Canada by John Diefenbaker. In that office he annoyed many of his colleagues by not permitting the post office to be used a reward for party supporters. He also drew ire by attempting to close many small and inefficient post offices. Despite his staunch fiscal conservatism and anti-communism, he was a supporter of the Quebec Liberal Party over the Union Nationale. Hamilton disliked the corruption of the Union Nationale and their infusion of strict Catholicism into Quebec politics. Hamilton was an Anglican. He resigned as Postmaster General on July 12, 1962 after he was defeated in the 1962 election by Edmund Tobin Asselin. Hamilton could not speak French, and it was a more important issue in 1962 than it had been previously. After his defeat Hamilton left Montreal for Vancouver where he ran a business. In 1978 he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada. There is a William Hamilton fonds at Library and Archives Canada. == References External links== * * Order of Canada Citation Category:1919 births Category:1989 deaths Category:Canadian Anglicans Category:Members of the House of Commons of Canada from Quebec Category:Members of the Queen's Privy Council for Canada Category:Montreal city councillors Category:Officers of the Order of Canada Category:Postmasters General of Canada Category:Progressive Conservative Party of Canada MPs Category:Sir George Williams University alumni ","title":"William McLean Hamilton"},{"id":"1997525","text":"James Houston Davenport (August 17, 1933 – February 18, 2016) was an American Major League Baseball infielder, primarily a third baseman, who played his entire career—over 1,500 games—with the San Francisco Giants (1958–1970). He also managed the Giants (), served as a coach for them for nine years over three different terms, and spent 51 years in all with the San Francisco organization. The right-handed batter and thrower, nicknamed \\"Peanut\\"Baseball Almanac or Peanuts\\"Baseball Reference as a child by his grandfather,Marcin, Joe., ed. (1970), The Baseball Register. St. Louis: The Sporting News, page 91 was listed as tall and . ==Early life== Davenport was born and grew up in Siluria, Alabama, also the birthplace of future teammate Willie Kirkland, and not far from Willie Mays' hometown. Growing up, Davenport had wanted to play football for the University of Alabama. However, Davenport married after high school and Alabama had a policy of not recruiting married players. Instead, he earned a football scholarship to the University of Southern Mississippi (then called Mississippi Southern College), where he played quarterback and also joined the baseball team. In 1952 and 1953, he beat an Alabama football team who were quarterbacked both times by Bart Starr. In 1954, Davenport hit .439 for the Southern Miss baseball team, and signed a professional contract with the Giants after the season. ==Playing career== Davenport made his major league debut with the San Francisco Giants on April 15, 1958, taking the team's first at bat on the West Coast, striking out against Don Drysdale of the Los Angeles Dodgers at Seals Stadium. His best season was , when he batted .297 with 14 home runs and 58 RBIs and made the All-Star team for the only time in his career. In the first of 1962's two MLB All-Star games, played July 10 at DC Stadium, Davenport took over for Ken Boyer as the National League's third baseman in the sixth inning with the Senior Circuit ahead, 2–1. In the eighth frame, his single off Dick Donovan set up Maury Wills' insurance run, as the Nationals ultimately won 3–1. Davenport played errorless ball in the field over the game's last four innings. That same season, Davenport was critical to the Giants' winning their first pennant since moving to San Francisco five years before. After going four for nine (.444) in the first two games of the 1962 National League tie-breaker series against the Dodgers, including a home run off Sandy Koufax in Game 1, Davenport drew a bases-loaded walk off Stan Williams in the ninth inning of the decisive Game 3 to get credit for the game-winning RBI in the Giants' eventual 6–4 victory, which gained them their first NL title since 1954, when they played in New York City. In the 1962 World Series that followed, he started all seven games against the New York Yankees, but could muster only three hits in 22 at bats (.136), although he drew four more bases on balls. Defensively, he made three errors in 21 total chances at third base. The Giants lost the Series in seven games. However, Davenport was known for his fielding, leading National League third basemen in fielding percentage each season from 1959–1961 and winning a Gold Glove at third base in 1962. Davenport played 97 consecutive errorless games at third base from July 26, 1966 to April 28, 1968, a record that stood until it was broken by John Wehner in the 1990s. He had a career batting average of .258 with 77 home runs and 456 RBIs, with 1,142 career hits, also including 177 doubles and 37 triples, in 4,427 at bats. He played in 1,501 regular-season games in 13 years, the fourth-most in San Francisco Giants history after Willie McCovey (2,256), Willie Mays (2,095) and Barry Bonds (1,976). His 1,130 games played at third base are the most in Giants' history. ==Post-playing career== After retiring as a player, Davenport finished the season as a coach on the staff of manager Charlie Fox. He managed the Triple-A Phoenix Giants for three years (1971–1973), then came back to MLB with the San Diego Padres for two years (1974–1975), working as third-base coach for skipper John McNamara. He returned to the Giants as their third base coach from 1976–1982, then as a scout. Davenport was promoted to manager of the Giants in 1985, but was replaced September 17 by Roger Craig after compiling a 56–88 record; the club was in last place in the National League West Division, 29 games behind the Dodgers at the time. The 1985 team went on to lose 100 games in the worst season in franchise history (to date, it is also the only time the team has ever hit the triple-digit mark in losses). He moved on to work as a coach for the Philadelphia Phillies (1986–1987), Cleveland Indians (1989) and Detroit Tigers (1991), and was the Tigers' advance scout in 1992. He returned to the Giants for good in 1993, and served as the club's first base coach in 1996. Overall, Davenport worked in the Giants' organization for 51 years in various roles, including player, coach, scout, manager, and a minor-league instructor. Davenport was inducted into the Southern Miss Athletic Hall of Fame as a quarterback in 1968. He was inducted into the Mississippi Sports Hall of Fame in 1983. In 2006, Davenport was inducted into the Alabama Sports Hall of Fame. ==Personal life== He married his high school sweetheart, Betty, and had five children, a daughter and four sons. His son Gary Davenport played minor league baseball in the Giants organization and has coached in the Giants' minor league system since 2004. Davenport lived in San Carlos, California and worked in the Giants' front office until his death on February 18, 2016. He is buried in Skylawn Memorial Park near San Francisco. The Giants wore a patch in his memory for the 2016 season, a black circle with an orange outline and his nickname \\"Davvy\\" and his number 12, to be worn on the left sleeve, below Monte Irvin's memorial patch. ==See also== *List of Major League Baseball players who spent their entire career with one franchise ==ReferencesExternal links== Category:1933 births Category:2016 deaths Category:Baseball players from Alabama Category:Cleveland Indians coaches Category:Dallas Eagles players Category:Detroit Tigers scouts Category:El Dorado Oilers players Category:Gold Glove Award winners Category:Major League Baseball first base coaches Category:Major League Baseball shortstops Category:Major League Baseball third base coaches Category:Major League Baseball third basemen Category:Minneapolis Millers (baseball) players Category:Minor league baseball managers Category:National League All-Stars Category:People from Shelby County, Alabama Category:Philadelphia Phillies coaches Category:San Francisco Giants coaches Category:San Francisco Giants managers Category:San Francisco Giants players Category:San Francisco Giants scouts Category:Southern Miss Golden Eagles baseball players ","title":"Jim Davenport"},{"id":"1997535","text":"Patricia Charbonneau (born April 19, 1959) is an American actress, perhaps best known for playing the part of Cay Rivvers in Desert Hearts, her first film role. ==Early life== Patricia Charbonneau was born in Valley Stream, New York on Long Island, the youngest of 10 children. Her father, a retired businessman, is French; her mother is Austrian. She graduated in 1977 from Valley Stream Central High School, which she attended with fellow actors Steve Buscemi and Steve Hytner, as well as writer Ed Renehan. She later attended Boston University as a theater major, and left after a month to take a position with the Lexington Conservatory Theatre company in the Catskills. The story of the Conservatory Theater is chronicled in the documentary The Loss of Nameless Things. ==Early work== In addition to work with the Lexington Conservatory Theatre, Charbonneau worked on the New York stage in a production of Revengers...A Tragedea, at Playwrights Horizons. She then became a member of the Actors Theatre of Louisville, where she originated the role of Lea in My Sister in this House, a part that she also played Off-Broadway. ==Desert Hearts== In 1985, Charbonneau made her film debut in Donna Deitch's film Desert Hearts at a time when it was still considered a risk to portray a lesbian in a romantic drama - complete with a lengthy love scene. Charbonneau told The Globe and Mail, \\"Kissing Helen wasn't the hard part, really. The hard part was walking out on the set naked and just standing there.\\" Two days before shooting began, Charbonneau found out that she was pregnant (by her rock musician husband Vincent Caggiano) with her first child, whom she once called her \\"Desert Hearts baby.\\" For her performance in Desert Hearts, Charbonneau was nominated for a 1987 Independent Spirit Award for Best Female Lead.Desert Hearts at NY Times ==Other notable work== In the following year she appeared in Michael Mann's Manhunter (based on the novel Red Dragon) and then played Anna, the lead, in Call Me (1988), which also featured fellow Valley Streamer Buscemi.

Squad and continued with dozens of appearances, including HBO's Tales from the Crypt, Crime Story, The Equalizer, Wiseguy, Murder She Wrote, Matlock, New York Undercover, and Law & Order: Criminal Intent. In the 1990 film RoboCop 2, she played the role of Linda Garcia. Despite the character's prominence in the movie's plot, her name is never spoken, and the role was not listed in the credits; observant fans were able to determine the character's name by noticing that she wore a name tag. In 1995, she starred in Mission Critical, a Legend Entertainment sci-fi adventure game. She played one of James Garner's daughters in the 1999 CBS made-for-TV film One Special Night, which featured Julie Andrews. In March 2007, Charbonneau joined the faculty of the Hudson Valley Academy of Performing Arts in West Taghkanic, New York where she teaches an acting workshop for children and teens. ==Personal life== Charbonneau met musician Vincent Caggiano in 1978, and four years later they wed. Later they had a daughter. ==FilmographyMovies=== {| class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" |- ! Year ! Title !

The name is an acronym for \\"Scouts Canada Ordinary-member Unity Taskforce Association\\". SCOUT eh! was founded in August, 2004. As of September, 2006 it had over 700 members from every Scouts Canada council and Canadian province. ==Background== SCOUT eh! was formed in response to a restructuring within Scouts Canada leading to what its members considered to be a non democratic management structure. In the late 1990s, Scouts Canada embarked on a restructuring process aimed at addressing the ongoing problem of membership decline. A team wrote what was officially known as the Millennium Report. The report described a dramatically more centralized and staff- directed structure for the association. The report was extremely unpopular with some portions of Scouts Canada's membership, especially those at the District level. Scouts Canada formally set aside the report, but continued work on restructuring. In 2000, Scouts Canada replaced its General By-Law with By-Law No. 1. The amendments replaced the 52-member National Council with a 23-member Board of Governors and divided the membership into Ordinary Members, who have no voting rights; and Voting Members, a group of 100 or fewer people who elect the Board and vote on matters presented to the national Annual General Meeting. 2002 saw the implementation of restructuring. Scouts Canada passed By-Law No. 2 which replaced the Provincial, Regional, and District Councils with 20 new councils, comprising an entire province or a large part of a province. Councils are led by a Council Commissioner, appointed by Scouts Canada's volunteer Chief Commissioner. The Districts were transformed into Areas overseen by an Area Commissioner appointed by and accountable to the Council Commissioner. Scouts Canada's Ontario Incorporated Body, which is the trustee for most of the Scout camps in Ontario, began a property review process. By 2004, dissatisfaction existed among some of Scouts Canada's membership. While some of the national leadership and staff considered the restructuring to be a success, some others at the local level objected to the changes and found the new system to be ineffective at helping Scouters deliver the program. ==Activities== The first SCOUT eh! gathering, referred to as CAMP eh! was held September 24–26, 2004 at Camp Timken near Iona in Ontario. Two-dozen Scouters including Scouters from Ontario, Quebec, and Newfoundland gathered to learn about the issues, discuss strategy, and draft a constitution for the association. === Camp sales campaign === The property review had become public knowledge and Scouters were worried about losing local camps. An information session at an April, 2004 Scouts Canada conference near Toronto did not reassure all the membership. In the middle of that summer, Scouts Canada produced a list of Scout camps they wanted to close. During this time some volunteers spearheaded the creation of a committee aimed at giving the disenfranchised membership direct management of the management and direction of Scouts Canada. === Financial concerns === SCOUT eh! has been a watchdog for Scouts Canada's finances. In 2006 it published that due to a claimed fall in members, financial issues and \\"top-heavy management\\", Scouts Canada may not have been able to last much past the summer 2007 centennial celebrations. In 2007 it expressed concerns that Scouts Canada faced potential bankruptcy due to a $6-million unfunded pension liability. Scouts Canada denied the claims. === Bill S-1001, The Scouts Canada Act campaign === In September 2006, SCOUT eh! announced it had surpassed 700 members nationally.SCOUT eh! Rallies; Membership Passes 700 During 2006 SCOUT eh! campaigned against Bill S-1001, The Scouts Canada Act. On Monday, December 4, 2006 SCOUT eh! made their case to the Standing Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. In 2007 SCOUT eh! petitioned the government, arguing that; * The membership of Scouts Canada had not been consulted on the Bill, * Information about the Bill had not made available to the membership, * That \\"the Bill will make fundamental that are changes contrary to the underlying principles governing Scouting and will adversely affect the rights heretofore enjoyed by members of the Boy Scouts of Canada and will be to the detriment of the membership\\". === Scouts Canada Policy 1014 campaign === In 2007, Scouts Canada announced Policy 1014 which requires that each council's Voting Members be elected by representatives of the council, and its areas and groups. While it acknowledged that the system is an improvement, SCOUT eh! criticized the policy because: * Most members of voting age are still not allowed to vote * Votes are distributed in an unequal manner which favors councils, areas, and small groups * Ordinary Members remain many levels removed from the decision- making process of the Board of Governors, resulting in mis-communication === Haliburton campaign === In 2009 a campaign was launched against the sale of part of the Haliburton Scout Reserve, a 20 square kilometre (5000 acre) Scout camp located east of Haliburton, Ontario described as Canada's largest Scout Camp. The organisation formed an online campaign against the sale of a 100-acre parcel of land for $1.3 million. ==See alsoReferencesExternal links== * Official website Category:Scouting and Guiding in Canada ","title":"SCOUT eh!"},{"id":"1997571","text":"A registrar of companies is a public authority which is responsible for managing a companies register. ==United Kingdom== The Registrar of Companies for England, Wales & Scotland is the official responsible for Companies House, which deals with all filings relating to the Companies Act 1985 to 2006.

There are many variations, but the traditional loco moco consists of white rice, topped with a hamburger, a fried egg, and brown gravy. Variations may include bacon, ham, Spam, tofu, kalua pork, Portuguese sausage, teriyaki beef, teriyaki chicken, mahi-mahi, shrimp, oysters, and other meats. ==History and origin== The dish was reportedly created at the Lincoln Grill restaurants in Hilo, Hawaii, in 1949 by its proprietors, Richard Inouye and his wife Nancy, at the request of teenagers from the Lincoln Wreckers Sports club seeking something that differed from a sandwich, was inexpensive, and yet could be quickly prepared and served. They asked Nancy to put some rice in a bowl, a hamburger patty over the rice, and then top it with brown gravy. The egg came later. The teenagers named the dish Loco Moco after one of their members, George Okimoto, whose nickname was \\"Crazy\\". George Takahashi, who was studying Spanish at Hilo High School, suggested using Loco, which is Spanish for crazy. They tacked on \\"moco\\" which \\"rhymed with loco and sounded good\\". To Spanish-speakers, however, the name can sound very odd, given that they hear it as \\"crazy snot\\" (moco is Spanish for \\"mucus\\"). ==Popularity== This dish was featured on the \\"Taste of Hawai'i\\" episode of Girl Meets Hawai'i, a Travel Channel show hosted by Samantha Brown. The episode features the dish being served at the popular restaurant, Hawaiian Style Cafe, in Waimea together with the plate lunch, another Hawaiian specialty dish. The loco moco was also featured on a Honolulu-based episode of the Travel Channel show Man v. Food (this episode aired in the show's second season). The host, Adam Richman, tried the dish at the Hukilau Café, located in nearby Laie. Richman also tried an off-the-menu loco moco at a San Francisco eatery called Namu Gaji on his 2014 show, Man Finds Food. In 2018, on a different episode of the revived Man v.

Judas, 2002. Peter Howson OBE (born 27 March 1958) is a Scottish painter. He was a British official war artist in 1993 during the Bosnian War. ==Early life== Peter Howson was born in London of Scottish parents and moved with his family to Prestwick, Ayrshire, when he was four. He was raised in a religious family and the first ever painting he did was a Crucifixion, when he was 6 years old. ==Career== His work has encompassed a number of themes. His early works are typified by very masculine working class men, most famously in The Heroic Dosser (1987). Later, in 1993, he was commissioned by the Imperial War Museum of London, to be the official war artist for the Bosnian War. Here he produced some of his most shocking and controversial work detailing the atrocities which were taking place at the time, like Plum Grove (1994). One painting in particular, Croatian and Muslim, detailing a rape created controversy partly because of its explicit subject matter but also because Howson had painted it from the victims' accounts. He was the official war painter at the Kosovo War for the London Times.War artists: Witness in paint, The Economist, 20 May 1999. In more recent years his work has exhibited strong religious themes which some say is linked to the treatment of his alcoholism and drug addiction at the Castle Craig Hospital in Peebles in 2000, after which he converted to Christianity. An example of this is Judas (2002) which His work has appeared in other media, with his widest exposure arguably for a British postage stamp he did in 1999 to celebrate engineering achievements for the millennium. In addition his work has been used on album covers by Live (Throwing Copper), The Beautiful South (Quench) and Jackie Leven (Fairytales for Hardmen). His work is exhibited in many major collections. Howson was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2009 Birthday Honours. In November 2010, BBC Scotland aired a documentary named \\"The Madness of Peter Howson\\" which followed the final stages of the completion of a grand commission for show in the renovated St Andrew's Cathedral and also dealt with Howson's struggle with mental illness and Asperger's syndrome.\\"The Madness\\", The Scotsman, 24 November 2010. In September 2014, Howson suggested he would hand back his OBE, predominantly because of his dislike of British foreign policy but it is not clear if he ever did so. ==Bibliography== Monographs * Berkoff, Stephen, Peter Howson, Flowers (2005) * Heller, Robert, Peter Howson, Momentum (2003) * Jackson, Allan, A Different Man, Mainstream Publishing (1997) * Heller, Robert, Peter Howson, Mainstream Publishing (1993) Exhibition Catalogues * Harrowing of Hell, 24 October - 22 November 2008, Flowers East * Christos Aneste, 18 March - 7 May 2005, Flowers East * Inspired by the Bible, 6–20 August 2004, New College, Edinburgh * The Stations of the Cross, 11 April - 18 May 2003, Flowers East * The Third Step, 13 April - 4 June 2002, Flowers East * The Rake’s Progress, 12 January - 11 February 1996, Flowers East * Blind Leading the Blind, 9 November- 8 December 1991, Flowers East ==References External links == * Peter Howson profile, FlowersGallery.com * Peter Howson.net * Peter Howson website * Glasgow Print Studio (view Howson works on-line) * Peter Howson profile, Asperger-Syndrome.me.uk * Donald Kuspit, Bipolar Paintings: PETER HOWSON, THE SCOTTISH BOSCH, artnet.com * * Peter Howson at National Portrait Gallery, London (npg.org.uk) * Category:1958 births Category:20th-century Scottish painters Category:Scottish male painters Category:21st-century Scottish painters Category:Alumni of the Glasgow School of Art Category:Artists commissioned by the Imperial War Museum Category:British war artists Category:Living people Category:Officers of the Order of the British Empire Category:Painters from London Category:People educated at Prestwick Academy Category:People from South Ayrshire Category:People with Asperger syndrome Category:Royal Highland Fusiliers soldiers Category:Scottish contemporary artists Category:Converts to Christianity Category:Scottish Christians ","title":"Peter Howson"},{"id":"1997601","text":"Lithograph of the crown The Crown of Queen Adelaide was the consort crown of the British queen Adelaide of Saxe-Meiningen, wife of King William IV. It was used at Adelaide's coronation in 1831. It was emptied of its jewels soon afterwards, and has never been worn since. ==Reasons for creation== Since the 1690s English and British queens consort had been crowned with the Crown of Mary of Modena, first made for the wife of King James II. However criticism of the continued use of this crown had mounted, for reasons of age, size, state of repair and because it was seen to be too theatrical and undignified. In the preparations for the coronation in 1831 it was ruled that the Modena crown was \\"unfit for Her Majesty's use\\". Plans were made for the creation of a new consort crown. ==Design== The new crown followed British crown tradition in having four half arches, meeting a globe, on top of which sat a cross. The Queen had objected to the standard practice of hiring diamonds and jewels for a crown prior to its use. Instead diamonds from her own private jewellery were installed in her new crown. Following the coronation, the diamonds were all removed, and the crown stored as a shell. ==Subsequent history== Since Queen Adelaide, all British queens consort have had their own special consort crown made for them, rather than wearing the crowns of any of their predecessors. Later consort crowns were made for Alexandra of Denmark (1902), Mary of Teck (1911) and Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon (1937). Queen Adelaide's crown, emptied of its jewels and discarded by the Royal Family, was loaned to the Museum of London by the Amherst family from 1933 until 1985. It was purchased by Asprey in 1987 and later acquired by Jefri Bolkiah, Prince of Brunei, who presented it to the United Kingdom. It had been valued at £425,000 in 1995 for the purposes of an application to export the crown to the United States. The application was withdrawn during a review by the Reviewing Committee on the Export of Works of Art. It is part of the Royal Collection and has been on public display in the Martin Tower at the Tower of London since 1996. ==Footnotes== # Anne Keay, The Crown Jewels (Historic Royal Palaces, 2002) p. 58\\\\.

The mansion is located at 391 West Paces Ferry Road NW, in the Tuxedo Park neighborhood of the affluent Buckhead district of Atlanta. ==Construction== The current Governor's Mansion is on property that belonged to former Atlanta mayor Robert Maddox (no relation to Lester Maddox), who owned a large English Tudor-style home on the site. A fire destroyed a large part of the house and Mr. Maddox sold the property to the state. The remainder of the home was demolished to construct the current mansion. The Governor's Mansion is a three-level, 30-room, Greek Revival style home built in 1967. It stands on approximately 18 acres (73,000 m²) on historic West Paces Ferry Road in north-northwest Atlanta. It was designed by Georgia architect Thomas Bradbury and officially opened on January 1, 1968. In 1975, the mansion was heavily damaged in a tornado that struck west and then north Atlanta on the morning of March 24, occurring just a week after Governor Busbee moved in after his inauguration, and necessitating a renovation. It also led to the tornado being called the \\"governor's tornado\\", the worst to hit the city until the 2008 storm that hit downtown. Later in 2008, the front door was damaged by fire during another renovation on the afternoon of September 11. The Atlanta Fire Department quickly extinguished the fire, and determined through thermal imaging that the fire had not spread inside the wall. Few people were present and nobody was injured, as it was after work hours, and the governor and his wife were away. ===Exterior=== The house covers 24,000 square feet (2,200 m²) and has a total of 30 Doric columns around the porches. These columns are made from California redwoods and are each 24 feet (7 m) high. They are hollowed out and specially treated on the inside to handle water drainage from the roof. The setting is park-like with numerous trees. On the grounds is the swimming pool, tennis courts, children's play area, and the greenhouse. The centerpiece of the entrance is a Georgia marble fountain with three large flagpoles. ===Interior=== The mansion has three levels: a lower level, the main level, and the upper level. The lower level has various rooms supporting the mansion. The ballroom is located on this level. The ballroom has a capacity of 175 for formal dinner and has uses for smaller functions as well. The pool and outside patio are also off this level. The main floor can be considered the State Floor. The majority of the rooms on this floor are used for official entertaining. The rooms also can be used for day-to-day activities. The Entrance Hall is the main entrance. Flanking the right side is the Georgia Library containing books written by Georgia authors. Flanking the left of the entrance is the guest bedroom, which is the only bedroom on the main floor. Toward the back of the mansion is the Circular Hall with its grand staircase. Located on the right is the State Dining Room and on the left the State sitting room. They are both used for formal state functions. The back center of the entrance hall contains the powder room on the right, Family Dining Room in front, and the Family Sitting Room to the left. The kitchen is in the back corner of the dining room. These are the three rooms used regularly by the family since this is the kitchen of the mansion. The upper floor contains the Governor's private living quarters. This level contains among other features the Governor's Mansion office, first lady's office, and family living room. There are several special bedrooms on this floor. The Presidential Suite with its own sitting room, bedroom, and bath has a commanding view of the front lawn. The Carter Bedroom, named after the former president, Lincoln Bedroom, and a couple of other bedrooms are also on this level. ===Furnishings=== All of the furnishings in the house are considered to be museum quality and make up one of the finest Federal period collections in the United States. These furnishings were acquired by a 70-member fine arts committee while the Mansion was being constructed. It is a permanent collection and belongs to the state of Georgia. It does not change from one administration to the next. ==Governors residing in the mansion== Lester Maddox was the first governor to live there, followed by Jimmy Carter, George Busbee, Joe Frank Harris, Zell Miller, Roy Barnes, Sonny Perdue, Nathan Deal, and Brian Kemp, who is the mansion's current resident. ==Public tours== Lester and Virginia Maddox, the first residents of the mansion, set a precedent of opening the mansion to the public for regularly scheduled tours, and that tradition has continued through today.Deal, p. 39. Tours are conducted throughout the year on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays between 10:00 a.m. and 11:30 a.m. Reservations are needed for groups of 10 or more. There is no charge. ==Previous mansions== Georgia has had three official mansions and one unofficial mansion in two different cities: * The first Executive Mansion (1838–1868) was located in Milledgeville and is still open today for public tours. * The state capital was moved from Milledgeville to Atlanta in 1868 and the first residence was unofficial, a three-story building on the east side of Peachtree Street, between Ellis and Baker streets, owned by Charles Larenden. * In 1870 the first official mansion in Atlanta was purchased from John H. James at Cain (now Andrew Young Intl. Blvd.) and Peachtree and its first occupant was Rufus Bullock. Seventeen governors occupied this large Victorian home until Governor Dorsey vacated the increasingly rundown building for his summer home near the Atlanta Water Works in 1921. The old James home was demolished in 1923 and the Henry Grady Hotel was later built on that site, which is now occupied by the Westin Peachtree Plaza.Garrett, Vol.I, p.835. * In 1925, the state acquired the granite mansion and estate of Edwin Ansley, located at The Prado in Ansley Park. That estate housed 11 governors before it was vacated and demolished in 1968, despite its historic importance. == NotesReferences== * Office of the Governor, Georgia State Capitol, Atlanta, GA 30334 * * == External links == *Official website of the Georgia Governor's Mansion *pictures of first Governor's mansion in Atlanta Category:Governors' mansions in the United States Category:Museums in Atlanta Category:Historic house museums in Georgia (U.S. state) Category:Government buildings in Georgia (U.S. state) Category:Demolished buildings and structures in Atlanta Category:Burned houses in the United States ","title":"Georgia Governor's Mansion"},{"id":"1997617","text":"An information security audit is an audit on the level of information security in an organization. Within the broad scope of auditing information security there are multiple types of audits, multiple objectives for different audits, etc. Most commonly the controls being audited can be categorized to technical, physical and administrative. Auditing information security covers topics from auditing the physical security of data centers to auditing the logical security of databases and highlights key components to look for and different methods for auditing these areas. When centered on the IT aspects of information security, it can be seen as a part of an information technology audit. It is often then referred to as an information technology security audit or a computer security audit. However, information security encompasses much more than IT. ==The audit processAudit planning & preparation=== An auditor should be adequately educated about the company and its critical business activities before conducting a data center review. The objective of the data center is to align data center activities with the goals of the business while maintaining the security and integrity of critical information and processes. To adequately determine whether or not the client's goal is being achieved, the auditor should perform the following before conducting the review: *Meet with IT management to determine possible areas of concern *Review the current IT organization chart *Review job descriptions of data center employees *Research all operating systems, software applications and data center equipment operating within the data center *Review the company's IT policies and procedures *Evaluate the company's IT budget and systems planning documentation *Review the data center's disaster recovery plan ===Establishing audit objectives=== The next step in conducting a review of a corporate data center takes place when the auditor outlines the data center audit objectives. Auditors consider multiple factors that relate to data center procedures and activities that potentially identify audit risks in the operating environment and assess the controls in place that mitigate those risks. After thorough testing and analysis, the auditor is able to adequately determine if the data center maintains proper controls and is operating efficiently and effectively. Following is a list of objectives the auditor should review: *Personnel procedures and responsibilities including systems and cross-functional training *Change management processes are in place and followed by IT and management personnel *Appropriate back up procedures are in place to minimize downtime and prevent loss of important data *The data center has adequate physical security controls to prevent unauthorized access to the data center *Adequate environmental controls are in place to ensure equipment is protected from fire and flooding ===Performing the review=== The next step is collecting evidence to satisfy data center audit objectives. This involves traveling to the data center location and observing processes and within the data center. The following review procedures should be conducted to satisfy the pre-determined audit objectives: *Data center personnel – All data center personnel should be authorized to access the data center (key cards, login ID's, secure passwords, etc.). Data center employees are adequately educated about data center equipment and properly perform their jobs. Vendor service personnel are supervised when doing work on data center equipment. The auditor should observe and interview data center employees to satisfy their objectives. *Equipment – The auditor should verify that all data center equipment is working properly and effectively. Equipment utilization reports, equipment inspection for damage and functionality, system downtime records and equipment performance measurements all help the auditor determine the state of data center equipment. Additionally, the auditor should interview employees to determine if preventative maintenance policies are in place and performed. *Policies and Procedures – All data center policies and procedures should be documented and located at the data center. Important documented procedures include: data center personnel job responsibilities, back up policies, security policies, employee termination policies, system operating procedures and an overview of operating systems. *Physical security / environmental controls – The auditor should assess the security of the client's data center. Physical security includes bodyguards, locked cages, man traps, single entrances, bolted down equipment, and computer monitoring systems. Additionally, environmental controls should be in place to ensure the security of data center equipment. These include: Air conditioning units, raised floors, humidifiers and uninterruptible power supply. *Backup procedures – The auditor should verify that the client has backup procedures in place in the case of system failure. Clients may maintain a backup data center at a separate location that allows them to instantaneously continue operations in the instance of system failure. ===Issuing the review report=== The data center review report should summarize the auditor's findings and be similar in format to a standard review report. The review report should be dated as of the completion of the auditor's inquiry and procedures. It should state what the review entailed and explain that a review provides only \\"limited assurance\\" to third parties. == Who performs audits == Generally, computer security audits are performed by: #Federal or State Regulators - Certified accountants, CISA. Federal OTS, OCC, DOJ, etc. #Corporate Internal Auditors - Certificated accountants, CISA, Certified Internet Audit Professional (CIAP).Certified Internet Audit Professional (CIAP), International Computer Auditing Education Association (ICAEA), http://www.iacae.org/English/Certification/CIAP.php #External Auditors - Specialized in the areas related to technology auditing. #Consultants - Outsourcing the technology auditing where the organization lacks the specialized skill set. ==The audited systemsNetwork vulnerabilities=== *Interception: Data that is being transmitted over the network is vulnerable to being intercepted by an unintended third party who could put the data to harmful use. * Availability: Networks have become wide-spanning, crossing hundreds or thousands of miles which many rely on to access company information, and lost connectivity could cause business interruption. * Access/entry point: Networks are vulnerable to unwanted access. A weak point in the network can make that information available to intruders. It can also provide an entry point for viruses and Trojan horses. ===Controls=== *Interception controls: Interception can be partially deterred by physical access controls at data centers and offices, including where communication links terminate and where the network wiring and distributions are located. Encryption also helps to secure wireless networks. *Availability controls: The best control for this is to have excellent network architecture and monitoring. The network should have redundant paths between every resource and an access point and automatic routing to switch the traffic to the available path without loss of data or time. *Access/entry point controls: Most network controls are put at the point where the network connects with external network. These controls limit the traffic that pass through the network. These can include firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and antivirus software. The auditor should ask certain questions to better understand the network and its vulnerabilities. The auditor should first assess what the extent of the network is and how it is structured. A network diagram can assist the auditor in this process. The next question an auditor should ask is what critical information this network must protect. Things such as enterprise systems, mail servers, web servers, and host applications accessed by customers are typically areas of focus. It is also important to know who has access and to what parts. Do customers and vendors have access to systems on the network? Can employees access information from home? Lastly the auditor should assess how the network is connected to external networks and how it is protected. Most networks are at least connected to the internet, which could be a point of vulnerability. These are critical questions in protecting networks. ===Encryption and IT audit=== In assessing the need for a client to implement encryption policies for their organization, the Auditor should conduct an analysis of the client's risk and data value. Companies with multiple external users, e-commerce applications, and sensitive customer/employee information should maintain rigid encryption policies aimed at encrypting the correct data at the appropriate stage in the data collection process. Auditors should continually evaluate their client's encryption policies and procedures. Companies that are heavily reliant on e-commerce systems and wireless networks are extremely vulnerable to the theft and loss of critical information in transmission. Policies and procedures should be documented and carried out to ensure that all transmitted data is protected. The auditor should verify that management has controls in place over the data encryption management process. Access to keys should require dual control, keys should be composed of two separate components and should be maintained on a computer that is not accessible to programmers or outside users. Furthermore, management should attest that encryption policies ensure data protection at the desired level and verify that the cost of encrypting the data does not exceed the value of the information itself. All data that is required to be maintained for an extensive amount of time should be encrypted and transported to a remote location. Procedures should be in place to guarantee that all encrypted sensitive information arrives at its location and is stored properly. Finally the auditor should attain verification from management that the encryption system is strong, not attackable and compliant with all local and international laws and regulations. ===Logical security audit=== The first step in an audit of any system is to seek to understand its components and its structure. When auditing logical security the auditor should investigate what security controls are in place, and how they work. In particular, the following areas are key points in auditing logical security: *Passwords: Every company should have written policies regarding passwords, and employee's use of them. Passwords should not be shared and employees should have mandatory scheduled changes. Employees should have user rights that are in line with their job functions. They should also be aware of proper log on/ log off procedures. Also helpful are security tokens, small devices that authorized users of computer programs or networks carry to assist in identity confirmation. They can also store cryptographic keys and biometric data. The most popular type of security token (RSA's SecurID) displays a number which changes every minute. Users are authenticated by entering a personal identification number and the number on the token. *Termination Procedures: Proper termination procedures so that old employees can no longer access the network. This can be done by changing passwords and codes. Also, all id cards and badges that are in circulation should be documented and accounted for. *Special User Accounts: Special User Accounts and other privileged accounts should be monitored and have proper controls in place. *Remote Access: Remote access is often a point where intruders can enter a system. The logical security tools used for remote access should be very strict. Remote access should be logged. ===Specific tools used in network security=== Network security is achieved by various tools including firewalls and proxy servers, encryption, logical security and access controls, anti-virus software, and auditing systems such as log management. Firewalls are a very basic part of network security. They are often placed between the private local network and the internet. Firewalls provide a flow through for traffic in which it can be authenticated, monitored, logged, and reported. Some different types of firewalls include: network layer firewalls, screened subnet firewalls, packet filter firewalls, dynamic packet filtering firewalls, hybrid firewalls, transparent firewalls, and application-level firewalls. The process of encryption involves converting plain text into a series of unreadable characters known as the ciphertext. If the encrypted text is stolen or attained while in transit, the content is unreadable to the viewer. This guarantees secure transmission and is extremely useful to companies sending/receiving critical information. Once encrypted information arrives at its intended recipient, the decryption process is deployed to restore the ciphertext back to plaintext. Proxy servers hide the true address of the client workstation and can also act as a firewall. Proxy server firewalls have special software to enforce authentication. Proxy server firewalls act as a middle man for user requests. Antivirus software programs such as McAfee and Symantec software locate and dispose of malicious content. These virus protection programs run live updates to ensure they have the latest information about known computer viruses. Logical security includes software safeguards for an organization's systems, including user ID and password access, authentication, access rights and authority levels. These measures are to ensure that only authorized users are able to perform actions or access information in a network or a workstation. Auditing systems, track and record what happens over an organization's network. Log Management solutions are often used to centrally collect audit trails from heterogeneous systems for analysis and forensics. Log management is excellent for tracking and identifying unauthorized users that might be trying to access the network, and what authorized users have been accessing in the network and changes to user authorities. Software that record and index user activities within window sessions such as ObserveIT provide comprehensive audit trail of user activities when connected remotely through terminal services, Citrix and other remote access software. According to a 2006 survey of 3243 Nmap users by Insecure.Org, Nessus, Wireshark, and Snort were some top-rated network security tools. According to the same survey, the BackTrack Live CD is the top rated information security auditing and penetration testing distribution. Nessus is a remote security scanner that performs over 1200 security checks for Linux, BSD, and Solaris. Wireshark analyzes network protocol for Unix and Windows, and Snort is an intrusion detection system that also supports Microsoft Windows. Nessus, Wireshark, and Snort are free. Some other popular products for network security include OmniGuard, Guardian, and LANGuard. Omniguard is a firewall, as is Guardian which also provides virus protection. LANGuard provides network auditing, intrusion detection, and network management. For log management, solutions from vendors such as SenSage and others are the choice for government agencies and highly regulated industries. ===Behavioural audit=== Vulnerabilities are often not related to a technical weakness in an organization's IT systems, but rather related to individual behavior within the organization. A simple example of this is users leaving their computers unlocked or being vulnerable to phishing attacks. As a result, a thorough InfoSec audit will frequently include a penetration test in which auditors attempt to gain access to as much of the system as possible, from both the perspective of a typical employee as well as an outsider. System and process assurance audits combine elements from IT infrastructure and application/information security audits and use diverse controls in categories such as Completeness, Accuracy, Validity (V) and Restricted access (CAVR).K. Julisch et al., Compliance by design - Bridging the chasm between auditors and IT architects Computers & Security 30(6-7): 410-426 (2011) ==Auditing application securityApplication security=== Application Security centers on three main functions: *Programming *Processing *Access When it comes to programming it is important to ensure proper physical and password protection exists around servers and mainframes for the development and update of key systems. Having physical access security at your data center or office such as electronic badges and badge readers, security guards, choke points, and security cameras is vitally important to ensuring the security of your applications and data. Then you need to have security around changes to the system. Those usually have to do with proper security access to make the changes and having proper authorization procedures in place for pulling through programming changes from development through test and finally into production. With processing it is important that procedures and monitoring of a few different aspects such as the input of falsified or erroneous data, incomplete processing, duplicate transactions and untimely processing are in place. Making sure that input is randomly reviewed or that all processing has proper approval is a way to ensure this. It is important to be able to identify incomplete processing and ensure that proper procedures are in place for either completing it, or deleting it from the system if it was in error. There should also be procedures to identify and correct duplicate entries. Finally when it comes to processing that is not being done on a timely basis you should back-track the associated data to see where the delay is coming from and identify whether or not this delay creates any control concerns. Finally, access, it is important to realize that maintaining network security against unauthorized access is one of the major focuses for companies as threats can come from a few sources. First you have internal unauthorized access. It is very important to have system access passwords that must be changed regularly and that there is a way to track access and changes so you are able to identify who made what changes. All activity should be logged. The second arena to be concerned with is remote access, people accessing your system from the outside through the internet. Setting up firewalls and password protection to on-line data changes are key to protecting against unauthorized remote access. One way to identify weaknesses in access controls is to bring in a hacker to try and crack your system by either gaining entry to the building and using an internal terminal or hacking in from the outside through remote access. ===Segregation of duties=== When you have a function that deals with money either incoming or outgoing it is very important to make sure that duties are segregated to minimize and hopefully prevent fraud. One of the key ways to ensure proper segregation of duties (SoD) from a systems perspective is to review individuals’ access authorizations. Certain systems such as SAP claim to come with the capability to perform SoD tests, but the functionality provided is elementary, requiring very time-consuming queries to be built and is limited to the transaction level only with little or no use of the object or field values assigned to the user through the transaction, which often produces misleading results. For complex systems such as SAP, it is often preferred to use tools developed specifically to assess and analyze SoD conflicts and other types of system activity. For other systems or for multiple system formats you should monitor which users may have super user access to the system giving them unlimited access to all aspects of the system. Also, developing a matrix for all functions highlighting the points where proper segregation of duties has been breached will help identify potential material weaknesses by cross checking each employee's available accesses. This is as important if not more so in the development function as it is in production. Ensuring that people who develop the programs are not the ones who are authorized to pull it into production is key to preventing unauthorized programs into the production environment where they can be used to perpetrate fraud. ===Summary=== By and large the two concepts of application security and segregation of duties are both in many ways connected and they both have the same goal, to protect the integrity of the companies’ data and to prevent fraud. For application security it has to do with preventing unauthorized access to hardware and software through having proper security measures both physical and electronic in place. With segregation of duties it is primarily a physical review of individuals’ access to the systems and processing and ensuring that there are no overlaps that could lead to fraud. ==See also== * Computer insecurity * Computer security * Defensive computing * Directive 95/46/EC on the protection of personal data (European Union) * Ethical hack * Information security * Penetration test * Security breach ==ReferencesBibliography== * ==External links== * Examining Data Centers * Network Auditing * The OpenXDAS project *Information Systems and Audit Control Association (ISACA) *The Institute of Internal Auditors Category:Information technology audit Audit Category:Information technology management Category:Types of auditing ","title":"Information security audit"},{"id":"1997622","text":"John Kitzmiller (December 4, 1913 – February 23, 1965) was an American actor who worked in his native land, as well as Italy and the United Kingdom.

He co-founded with his wife, Dorothy, the Dartington Hall project in progressive education and rural reconstruction. ==Biography== Leonard Elmhirst was born into a landed gentry family in Worsbrough (now part of Barnsley, Yorkshire), where the family seat is Houndhill. He was the second of nine siblings (eight boys and one girl). His elder brother, Captain William Elmhirst, was killed on 13 November 1916, aged 24, while serving with the 8th Bn. East Yorkshire Regiment during the Battle of the Somme, and the third son, Second Lieutenant Ernest Christopher Elmhirst, was killed on 7 August 1915, aged 20, while serving with the 8th Bn. Duke of Wellington's (West Riding Regiment) during the Gallipoli Campaign; both during World War I. The fourth son, Thomas became Air Marshal Sir Thomas Elmhirst (KBE, CB, AFC, DL, RAF). In 1912 Leonard Elmhirst went up to Trinity College, Cambridge to study history and theology, intending to follow his father into the Church. In 1914, he was deemed unfit for military service and volunteered for overseas service in the YMCA. His experience of the problems of rural India was to fundamentally change the direction of his career. After one year's service in the army he was demobilised in 1919 and entered Cornell University in Ithaca, New York to study agriculture. Arriving almost penniless, he successfully completed a four-year degree course in two years.Leonard Knight Elmhirst, The Straight and Its Origin, 1975, OCLC 2046429 originally serialized in Cornell Alumni News, 1974–75 In 1920 he was elected president of Cornell's Cosmopolitan Club, which was mostly for foreign students, and found that it had large debts and depended on the philanthropy of its alumni and others. Money-raising activities brought him in contact with Dorothy Straight, who was to become his wife. In America he also met the 1913 Nobel Laureate for Literature, Rabindranath Tagore, and in November 1921 returned to India as Tagore's secretary. In 1922, in the village of Surul (of which Sriniketan is a part) adjacent to Santiniketan, West Bengal, he set up for Tagore an Institute of Rural Reconstruction. Between 1923 and 1925, Leonard travelled twice around the globe, lecturing and supporting Rabindranath Tagore's missions to Europe, Asia and South America. The influence of Tagore, and the interests and money of his wife to be, led Elmhirst to undertake an experiment in rural reconstruction at Dartington Hall in Devon. It is said that Tagore had become familiar with Dartington during his travels in England and influenced Elmhirst in his selection of the estate, which was purchased in a series of transactions in 1925. Elmhirst also assisted in the re-acquisition of his ancient family seat, Houndhill, a couple of miles from his birthplace. In 1946 he refused the offer of a barony from Prime Minister Clement Attlee. In a letter to Attlee he replied that \\"My own work, however, as you know, has lain in the main among country people...in India, the USA and in Devonshire...acceptance would neither be easy for me to explain nor easy for my friends to comprehend\\".The Elmhirsts of Dartington, The Creation of a Utopian Community, 344. Routledge & Kegan Paul, 1982 ==Personal life== Leonard married Dorothy Payne Whitney in September 1925. They had two children. He was the stepfather of racing driver and aviator Whitney Straight (1912-1979), actress Beatrice Straight (1914–2001) and writer and KGB spy Michael Whitney Straight (1916–2004). After Dorothy died, Leonard married Susanna Isaacs-Elmhirst in 1973 in Worsborough, Yorkshire. ==Works== In 1931, when the Dartington Hall experiment was established they set up a trust to manage its affairs so they could undertake other work worldwide. Leonard's work included: * Work for Exeter University, Devon County Council and local organisations * 1929: launched the International Conference of Agricultural Economists * 1932: brought artificial insemination of cattle from Russia to Devon * President of the Royal Forestry Society * War-time public service during World War II including agricultural missions to the Middle East and India * Irrigation and hydroelectricity in the Damodar Valley, India * 1954: Member, Indian Rural Education Committee ==ReferencesFurther reading== *Michael Young, The Elmhirsts Of Dartington, The Creation Of A Utopian Community, Routledge & Kegan Paul, 1982 Category:English philanthropists Category:English educational theorists Category:Alumni of Trinity College, Cambridge Category:Cornell University College of Agriculture and Life Sciences alumni Category:Whitney family Category:1893 births Category:1974 deaths Category:People associated with Santiniketan Category:People from Barnsley Category:20th-century philanthropists ","title":"Leonard Knight Elmhirst"},{"id":"1997656","text":"Faraid Head () is a small peninsula on the northern coast of Sutherland, Highland, Scotland, located around north of the hamlet of Balnakeil and north of Durness.

A person who has the right of abode in a country does not need permission from the government to enter the country and can live and work there without restriction, and is immune from removal and deportation (unless the right of abode has been revoked). Generally, in order to have the right of abode in a certain country, a person must be a citizen of that country. However, some countries grant the right of abode for qualified non-citizens. This is distinct with the commonly-called right to land, right to live or right of residence, e.g. with permanent residency of the country generally have a de facto right of residence, but it can be revoked in certain circumstances (unlike a citizenship which can only be revoked in very limited circumstances such as fraud or national security concern), for example for being convicted of crimes, or in some countries, prolonged absence from it, and in many cases, such persons are not free from the immigration control. ==EU, EEA, and the Schengen Agreement== Citizens of the European Economic Area (the European Union plus Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway) and Switzerland enjoy the freedom to travel to, live in, and work in any participating country without needing a work permit or visa, although transitory dispositions may restrict the rights of citizens of new member states to work in other countries. This is defined by the Directive 2004/38/EC on the right to move and reside freely. However, rights to live in another EU/EEA state are not absolute. To reside in another EU/EEA state, one must either be working, job- hunting, a student, or otherwise have sufficient financial resources and health insurance to ensure they do not become a burden on the social services of the host country. States may also require nationals of other EU/EEA states to register their presence with the authorities after a certain period of time. EU/EEA states may deport nationals of other EU/EEA states and issue exclusion orders against them on grounds of public policy, public security, or public health. For example, those who commit serious crimes or come to rely on welfare may be deported. However, those subjected to such exclusion orders must be able to appeal them after a maximum period of three years, as per EU regulations. Under no circumstances can an EU/EEA state exclude a national of another EU/EEA state for life. Any EU/EEA national who completes a five-year period of uninterrupted legal residence in another EU/EEA state becomes eligible for permanent residence, after which their presence is no longer subjected to any conditions, and they may apply for benefits that would previously have been grounds for removal, such as welfare. Permanent residency can only be revoked after a two-year absence. ===Schengen Agreement=== Nearly all EU/EEA countries are part of the Schengen Area; a group of countries that have signed the Schengen Agreement, which abolishes border controls between participating states, although it allows border controls to be temporarily set up in exceptional circumstances. The EEA countries and Switzerland have signed the Schengen treaty. Several of the new member states have not yet fully implemented it. As a consequence of this, for instance, a French citizen may travel to the United Kingdom, another EEA member state, and then freely live and work in that country. But since the UK has not adopted the Schengen Agreement, they can be required to present a passport or ID card when entering the UK. This requirement applies similarly to British citizens migrating to France. On the other hand, Switzerland applies the Schengen Agreement, so a French citizen is able to travel to Switzerland without being stopped at the border. However, a few European countries require all persons to carry an identity card or passport and proof of nationality is normally required to take up residence in any member state. Thus, while the Schengen Agreement facilitates the movement of persons across frontiers, it makes no substantive difference to residence rights. ==Nordic Passport Union== The Nordic Passport Union gives the citizens of Nordic countries the right to freely travel to and reside in other Nordic countries without a passport or residence permit. ==Gulf Cooperation Council== Citizens of member states of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) have freedom of movement throughout the GCC, including the right to reside and work in other GCC states with almost no restrictions. ==Hong KongTaiwanCommon Travel Area== The Common Travel Area (CTA) consists of the United Kingdom, Republic of Ireland, and the UK's surrounding island territories. British and Irish citizens can move freely throughout the CTA without a passport and only minimal identity documents, and are subject to virtually no immigration controls. Citizens of both countries enjoy the right to live and work throughout the CTA with minimal restriction. ===Deportation of British or Irish citizens=== Unlike other EU/EEA nationals, Irish citizens who move to the UK are granted a \\"settled status\\", a status that goes beyond indefinite leave to remain. Irish nationals eligible for deportation are treated more leniently than other EU/EEA nationals, and are not automatically subjected to deportation procedures when convicted of crimes, as Parliament has considered \\"the close historical, community and political ties between the United Kingdom and Ireland, along with the existence of the Common Travel Area.\\" Irish citizens are therefore legally subject to deportation from the UK only where recommended by a court in sentencing or in exceptional circumstances where that deportation is in the public interest. https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/870578/HCB104-explanatory- notes-immigration-Bill-2020.pdf Irish law provides similar protections for British citizens. British citizens are virtually exempt from deportation from Ireland, and are almost never treated as foreigners by law, although there are exceptions to this rule. ===Commonwealth citizens in the UK=== In addition, some nationals of member states of the Commonwealth of Nations are considered Commonwealth citizens, and have various rights in other Commonwealth countries, including the UK, such as the right-of-abode and the right to vote. In addition, British subjects born before 1984 have the right-of-abode. If a person has a British mother and was born before 1984 then under section 2(1)(b) of the Immigration Act 1971 they are considered to have the same rights as a British citizen. The right-of-abode is conferred automatically on such persons and they are issued a certificate on their passport. Under exceptions in section 7 of the Immigration Act 1971, a long-term resident Irish or Commonwealth citizen in the UK is granted immunity from deportation, similar to British or other Commonwealth citizens who hold right-of-abode by virtue of a residency term of at least five years in the United Kingdom. These exceptions do not apply to other nationalities with leave to remain in the United Kingdom.section 7 of the Immigration Act 1971 ==British Overseas Territories== All British Overseas Territories operate their own immigration controls which apply to British citizens as well as to those from other countries. These territories generally have local immigration laws regulating who has belonger status in that territory. == United Kingdom Canada== Under the constitution, all Canadian citizens have the right to enter and remain in the country. Permanent residents are also conferred the right to reside and pursue a livelihood in any province or territory without restriction. https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/const/page-15.html#h-39 This makes permanent residents the only foreign citizens with right of abode. However, permanent residents can also face revocation of this status under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. ==De facto right of abode== The nationality laws of many countries allow foreign citizens to reside permanently in the country without seeking citizenship. This status is usually accorded following application and selection based on a variety of criteria. In Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United States among others, foreign residents who have the right to reside permanently in the country are given the legal definition of designation of \\"permanent resident\\". Although not conferring all the rights and privileges of citizenship, it allows such individuals to enter freely as well as to take advantage of social programs and other services offered to citizens. Nonetheless, this still remains a \\"de facto\\" form of right of abode because it can be revoked in accordance with the law. ===Full permanent resident=== This includes cases where there is access to citizenship: * New Zealand grants Australian citizens/permanent residents full permanent resident rights in New Zealand. * The United Kingdom and Ireland grant automatic permanent residency to each other's citizens. * Full permanent residency rights exist between the countries of the Nordic Council (Norway, Sweden, Finland, Denmark and Iceland). ===As long-term temporary residents=== In these cases there is a right of residence but without access to full citizenship rights: * New Zealand citizens in Australia, but since 2001, Australia grants only limited rights. * Citizens of EEA member states and Switzerland living in each other's country (except the cases above). * Most citizens of the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM), the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI) and the Republic of Palau may live and work in the United States, and most U.S. citizens and their spouses may live and work in those states under a Compact of Free Association with the United States. ==See also== *Belonger status *Common Travel Area *Free movement of workers *Permanent residency *Schengen Treaty *Right of return *Nationality law ==References== *Leonard, Thomas M.: Encyclopedia of the Developing World ==External links== *UK Home Office guide to right of abode *Right of Union citizens and their family members to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States *http://untreaty.un.org/unts/1_60000/5/32/00009566.pdf Category:Human migration ","title":"Right of abode"},{"id":"1997666","text":"In Hinduism, and in particular Jnana Yoga and Advaita Vedanta, neti neti (Sanskrit : नेति नेति) is a Sanskrit expression which means \\"not this, not that\\", or \\"neither this, nor that\\" (' is sandhi from ' \\"not so\\"). It is found in the Upanishads and the Avadhuta Gita and constitutes an analytical meditation helping a person to understand the nature of Brahman by first understanding what is not Brahman. One of the key elements of Jnana Yoga practice is often a \\"neti neti search.\\" The purpose of the exercise is to negate rationalizations and other distractions from the non-conceptual meditative awareness of reality. ==Significance of neti neti== Neti neti, meaning, \\"Not this, not this\\", is the method of Vedic analysis of negation. It is a keynote of Vedic inquiry. With its aid the Jnani negates identification with all things of this world which is not the Atman, in this way he negates the Anatman. Through this gradual process he negates the mind and transcends all worldly experiences that are negated till nothing remains but the Self. He attains union with the Absolute by denying the body, name, form, intellect, senses and all limiting adjuncts and discovers what remains, the true \\"I\\" alone. L.C.Beckett in his book, Neti Neti, explains that this expression is an expression of something inexpressible, it expresses the ‘suchness’ (the essence) of that which it refers to when ‘no other definition applies to it’. Neti neti negates all descriptions about the Ultimate Reality but not the Reality itself. Intuitive interpretation of uncertainty principle can be expressed by \\"Neti neti\\" that annihilates ego and the world as non-self (Anatman), it annihilates our sense of self altogether. Adi Shankara was one of the foremost Advaita philosophers who advocated the neti-neti approach. In his commentary on Gaudapada’s Karika, he explains that Brahman is free from adjuncts and the function of neti neti is to remove the obstructions produced by ignorance. His disciple, Sureshvara, further explains that the negation, neti neti, does not have negation as its purpose, it purports identity. The sage of the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad II iii 1-6, beginning with there are two forms of Brahman, the material and the immaterial, the solid and the fluid, the Sat ‘being’ and tya, ‘that’ of Satya – which means true, denies the existence of everything other than Brahman. And therefore, there exists no separate entity like Jiva which Shankara states is the reflection of Brahman in Avidya (ignorance). ==Avadhuta Gita== The following was extracted from Avadhuta Gita 1.25 on Wikisource: Sanskrit in Devanagari: तत्त्वमस्यादिवाक्येन स्वात्मा हि प्रतिपादितः । नेति नेति श्रुतिर्ब्रूयाद अनृतं पाञ्चभौतिकम् ।। २५।। IAST: tattvamasyādivākyena svātmā hi pratipāditaḥ / neti neti śrutirbrūyād anṛtaṁ pāñcabhautikam //25// By such sentences as \\"That thou art,\\" our own Self is affirmed.

It won the 1988 World Fantasy Award for Best Novel. The novel tells of a 43-year-old man who dies and wakes up back in 1963 in his 18-year-old body. He relives his life with all his memories of the previous 25 years intact. This happens repeatedly, with the man playing out his life differently in each cycle. The novel was a bestseller in Japan. Its time-loop concept has been referenced as a precursor of Harold Ramis' comedy-drama Groundhog Day (1993). Richard A. Lupoff explored a similar premise in his 1973 short story \\"12:01\\". Groundhog Day ==Characters and story== Replay is the account of 43-year-old radio journalist Jeff Winston, who dies of a heart attack in 1988 and awakens back in 1963 in his 18-year-old body as a student at Atlanta's Emory University. He then begins to relive his life with intact memories of the next 25 years, until, despite his best efforts at cardiac health, he dies of a heart attack, again, in 1988. He immediately returns to 1963, but several hours later than the last \\"replay\\". This happens repeatedly with different events in each cycle, each time beginning from increasingly later dates (first days, then weeks, then years, then ultimately decades). Jeff soon realizes that he cannot prevent his death in 1988, but he can change the events that occur before it, both for him, and for others. During one subsequent replay, Jeff takes notice of a highly acclaimed film, Starsea, that has become a huge success at the box office in 1974. The film is written and produced by an unknown filmmaker, Pamela Phillips, who has recruited Steven Spielberg to direct and George Lucas, as a special effects supervisor, before the two shot to stardom with their own projects. Because the film did not exist in previous replays, Jeff suspects that Pamela is also experiencing the same phenomenon. He locates her and asks her questions about future films which only a fellow replayer would know, confirming his suspicions. Pamela and Jeff eventually fall in love and become convinced that they are soulmates. Complications arise when they notice that their replays are getting shorter and shorter, with Pamela not beginning her next replay until well after Jeff. Eventually, the two decide to try to find other replayers by placing cryptic messages in newspapers. The messages, which seem very vague to anyone who is not a replayer, generate a fair amount of dead-end responses until the pair receives a letter from a man who is clearly knowledgeable about future events. Jeff and Pamela decide to visit the stranger, only to discover that he is confined to a psychiatric hospital. Surprisingly, the staff does not pay attention to his discussion on the future, but it soon becomes clear why the man is institutionalized when he calmly states that he thinks aliens are forcing him to murder people for their own entertainment. In a later replay, the two decide to take their experiences public, giving press conferences announcing future events in explicit detail. The government eventually takes notice and forces Pamela and Jeff to provide continued updates on foreign activities. Although the government denies responsibility, major political events begin to transpire differently, and Jeff attempts to break off the relationship. The government refuses, and the pair are imprisoned and forced to continue providing information. As future replays become shorter and shorter, the two are left to wonder how things will eventually unfold--whether or not the replays will ultimately end, and the pair will pass into the afterlife--or if the current replay is, in fact, the last. Eventually, the replays become so short, Jeff and Pamela relive their original deaths repeatedly in succession--until Jeff finally has a heart attack which he manages to survive. While he calls Pamela soon afterward, she lets him know that she has also survived, and that their replaying was not a dream. While it seems ambiguous whether or not they will meet again, Jeff eagerly awaits entering an unpredictable future with endless possibilities. In the subsequent epilogue, a Norwegian man finds himself waking up in a youthful body in 1988, twenty five years before his apparent death in 2017. He marvels at the possibilities that await him at retaining the memories of his life and world and national events for the next quarter century. It becomes apparent to the reader that the replay phenomenon is not limited to the three individuals experiencing it in the novel, nor is it limited to the 1963-1988 timeframe. ==Awards and nominations== Replay won the 1988 World Fantasy Award and was on the shortlist for the 1988 Arthur C. Clarke Award. The novel has been included in several lists of recommended reading: Modern Fantasy: The Hundred Best Novels (1988), Locus Reader's Poll: Best Science Fiction Novel (1988), Aurel Guillemette's The Best in Science Fiction (1993) and David Pringle's Ultimate Guide to Science Fiction (1995). ==Sequel and possible film adaptations== Ken Grimwood was working on a sequel to Replay when he died from a heart attack in 2003 at the age of 59.Obituary in The Independent In 2010 Warner Bros. reported that it was planning on a film version starring Ben Affleck.

In 1981, the Socialist Party leader, François Mitterrand, was elected President of France and the Left won the legislative election. However, in 1986, the right regained a parliamentary majority. President Mitterrand was forced to \\"cohabit\\" with a conservative cabinet led by the RPR leader Jacques Chirac. Chirac took responsibility for domestic policy while the President focused on his \\"reserved domain\\" – foreign affairs and defense policy. Moreover, several other prominent candidates opposed the two heads of the executive. Chirac's cabinet advocated liberal-conservative policies, in abolishing the solidarity tax on wealth and selling some public companies. It was faced with opposition from social movements, supported by President Mitterrand. Meanwhile, the leadership of Chirac over the right was challenged by the former UDF Prime Minister Raymond Barre. Barre gained some popularity by condemning the principle of the \\"cohabitation\\", claiming that it is incompatible with the \\"spirit of the Fifth Republic\\". He appeared as an alternative to the executive duo. In January 1988, when he announced his candidacy, Chirac was credited with 19.5% in the first round by SOFRES polls institute, against 23% for Barre. But, from the start of February, Chirac benefited from the internal divisions in the UDF, and took the lead among the right-wing candidates. On the left, the identity of the Socialist candidate was uncertain. Mitterrand said he was not sure he would run, and meanwhile, his internal rival Michel Rocard campaigned for the nomination. The favourite to win the election according to the polls, the incumbent president announced his candidacy at the end of March. He wrote an open letter to the French, where he proposed a moderate programme (\\"neither nationalisations, nor privatizations\\") and advocated a \\"united France\\" against \\"the appropriation of the state by a clan\\", targeting Chirac and the RPR. He benefited from the decline of the French Communist Party, represented by André Lajoinie. Lajoinie was faced with competition for the far-left vote by a \\"reforming Communist\\", Pierre Juquin and a Trotskyist, Arlette Laguiller. Meanwhile, the Ecologist Antoine Waechter refused to ally the Greens with either the left or the right. On the far- right, the National Front leader, Jean-Marie Le Pen, tried to confirm the FN's good result in the previous legislative election. The French economy shrugging off the early 1980s recession with 4% growth that year put the economy off the minds of voters as well as popular social programs being implemented, both of which gave Mitterrand the economic argument to achieve a second term despite the fallback in the last legislative election that caused cohabitation. ==Results== The second round consisted of a competition between the two heads of the executive power, but the first was marked by the unexpectedly high vote for the National Front, and a poor result for the Communist Party. Barre endorsed Chirac. The TV debate between the two finalists, and protagonists of the \\"cohabitation\\", was very tense. Mitterrand wanted to show his ascendancy in naming his challenger \\"Mr Prime Minister\\". Chirac answered: \\"Here, you are not President, and I am not Prime Minister. We are two equal candidates. You will allow that I call you Mr Mitterrand\\". Mitterrand replied: \\"You are absolutely right, Mr Prime Minister\\". Besides, the two candidates clashed about their attitude to the September 1986 terrorist attacks. François Mitterrand was re-elected President of France. Jacques Chirac resigned from the head of the cabinet. Michel Rocard succeeded him, then the Socialist Party obtained a relative parliamentary majority, President Mitterrand having dissolved the National Assembly. Chirac became president after winning the 1995 elections. ==See also== * President of France * Politics of France ==References Further reading== & Bell, David.

According to the Climate Accountability Institute, British Coal Cooperation was responsible for 1.13% of global industrial greenhouse gas emissions up to 2017. == History National Coal Board=== British Coal was formed on 12 July 1946 as the National Coal Board (NCB), which was responsible for the organisation and running of coal extraction. It was under the responsibility of the Minister of Fuel & Power, who presented the board's reports to Parliament.

The principal of Nauru Secondary School inspecting school lunches (2012) A school meal or school lunch (also known as hot lunch, a school dinner, or school breakfast) is a meal provided to students and sometimes teachers at a school, typically in the middle or beginning of the school day. Countries around the world offer various kinds of school meal programs. Each week day, millions of children from all standards and grades receive meals at their respective schools. School meals in twelve or more countries provide high-energy food with high nutritional values either free or at economical rates. The benefits of school meals vary from country to country. While in developed countries the school meal is a source of nutritious meals, in developing countries it is an incentive to send children to school and continue their education. In developing countries, school meals provide food security at times of crisis and help children to become healthy and productive adults, thus helping to break the cycle of poverty and hunger. ==History== The first school lunches were served in 1790 in Munich, Germany by an American born physicist, Benjamin Thompson, also known as Count Rumford. Thompson had spent his early days in New England but as a royalist during the American Revolutionary War he had become distrusted and left for England in 1784. In Munich, Thompson founded the Poor People's Institute which employed both adults and children to make uniforms for the German Army. They were fed and clothed for their work and the children taught reading, writing and arithmetic. Years later Thompson would feed 60,000 people a day from his soup kitchen in London. Benjamin Thompson pioneered institutional feeding of the poor and is credited with introducing the potato to the diet of the European poor, inventing the double boiler, the kitchen range, baking oven, pressure cooker, drip coffee maker which are the forerunners to the steam jacketed kettle, compartment steamer, and commercial ovens used for school food programs today. In the United Kingdom, significant changes have been made from when school meals were introduced in the nineteenth century. The first National School Meals Policy was published across the United Kingdom in 1941. The Policy set the first nutritional guidelines for school lunches, requiring balanced meals which include the appropriate levels of protein, fat, and calories. In the United States, there was a social inequality gap during the industrial era and there was room for improvement in all realms of education. Poor children were experiencing malnutrition and hunger due to a low income of families. Philadelphia and Boston were the first 2 cities to institute school lunches in the U.S. Organizations such as Women's Education and the Starr Center Association began serving hot meals to students for a cost that was affordable for most. Soon after, teachers started to notice the benefits of students both mentally and physically. The federal government wasn't involved until the Great Depression (1920s), farmers and labors weren't doing well financially and the school lunch program was a solution that benefited everyone. In recent years, school districts have faced government or community pressure to change the foods served in schools. The addition of vegan school lunch and Meatless Mondays are examples of these changes. ==TypesFree school meal=== Sweden, Finland, Estonia and India are among the few countries which provide free school meals to all pupils in compulsory education, regardless of their ability to pay. Many countries provide meals to improve attendance rates. In India, where all the Government School students are provided with free lunch meals through the Midday Meal Scheme, staple food that varies between different states and regions is provided along with free education. In high-income countries, free meals are usually available only to children who meet income-based criteria. A study of a free school meal program in the United States found that providing free meals to elementary and middle school children in areas characterized by high food insecurity led to better school discipline among the students. ===Reduced price meals=== Reduced price meals are also available in some countries to those who need a degree of assistance with costs. Lower-cost meals are available to students in such countries as France, Italy, Hong Kong, Japan, and the United States. ==EuropeEstonia=== In Estonia, free school dinners are served in elementary and secondary schools. ====Nutritional guidelines==== Nutritional guidelines for Estonian school meals are based on the Estonian food pyramid. At the pyramid's base are water and exercise. The next tier up includes starches, fruits, and vegetables. According to Estonia's Food-Based Dietary Guidelines, these foods should comprise the majority of each meal. The middle section of the pyramid includes dairy products and meat. The Guidelines suggest eating these foods in small portions on a daily basis. Just below the top tier are oils, butter and nuts. At the peak of the pyramid are foods like ice cream, soft drinks, honey, and biscuits: high-sugar foods which should be eaten sparingly, as special treats. ===Finland=== A typical Finnish school lunch served free of charge to all pupils. ====History==== Finland provides free, catered hot school meals to all pupils from pre-primary to upper secondary education every school day, as guaranteed by the 1948 Basic Education Act. Section 31 of the Basic Education Act states: \\"A pupil attending basic education shall be provided with a balanced and appropriately organized and supervised meal on every school day.\\" Some Finnish cities had offered poor students free school dinners since the beginning of the 20th century. For example, Kuopio did so starting in 1902, and extended school dinners to all students in 1945. ====Current status==== According to Finnish National Board of Education statistics from the year 2014, the average school meal was valued at 2.80 euros per student-school day, totaling 532 euros per student for the school year. This sum included ingredients, labor costs, kitchen equipment, and other fixed expenses, but neither property costs nor taxes. Children taking part in before- and after-school activities are also served a free healthy snack. ====Higher education==== Lunches for higher education students (like those attending universities and polytechnics) are also subsidized in Finland. Kela, the Social Insurance Institution of Finland, compensates student meals that fulfill the nutritional and pricing criteria for government meal subsidies. This program's purpose is to promote positive health and nutritional trends among students. The program accommodates special dietary needs – whether in connection with religion, ethical beliefs, or health issues – without extra costs. ====Objectives and role in learning==== Free school meals in Finland are viewed as an investment for the future; the aim is to maintain and improve children's health, well-being, and learning. The school meal is used as a pedagogical tool for teaching table manners, food culture, nutrition, and healthy eating habits, as well as for increasing the consumption of vegetables, fruits and berries, wholemeal bread, and skimmed or low-fat milk. One of the basic lessons is cooperation between students, head teachers, teachers, parents, and catering staff. In many schools, students participate in the work of the school canteen during their working life practice period. Most schools have a school meal committee where students, teachers, and catering staff develop school catering together. Most schools also welcome parents to come and taste school meals. There are always adults present in the school restaurant. The pedagogical role of the school catering staff is seen as important, as is teachers' knowledge of nutrition. In 2009, Finland began developing school meal and nutrition education for teachers, and pedagogical education for school catering personnel. National and local regulations form the basis for Finnish school meal practices. Education acts and decrees and local curricula are central documents governing school meals. Local and school-level curricula define the central principles of arranging school catering. The curricula also describe the objectives for education in health, nutrition, and manners. The health-related and social role of school meals, the objectives of teaching nutrition and manners, and the recreational aspect of lunch breaks are taken into account when arranging school meals and snacks. Students are allowed at least 30 minutes for eating, after which they have a short recess outdoors. School lunches can also be a channel for empowering local food producers. Introducing locally produced fish to the offerings of institutional kitchens, such as school canteens, is an ethical and ecological alternative to mass-produced meat or imported fish. ====Contents and nutritional guidelines==== School meals generally consist of typical Finnish foods. A basic school meal consists of a warm main course, vegetables, bread, a table spread, and a drink. The school lunch is calculated to equate to about one-third of a child’s daily nutritional needs. School catering is designed to follow the National Nutrition Council's dietary guidelines for schools. The recommendations for school meals are being updated during the year 2016. Normally, Finnish schools provide lunch at school canteens in the form of a buffet, where pupils serve themselves as much as they want. Schools often use a model plate to guide eating habits towards the following recommendations: * Fresh and cooked vegetables covering half of the plate * Potatoes, rice, or pasta covering one quarter of the plate * Fish at least once a week (preferably twice a week); meat; or beans and sprouts as part of a vegetarian diet covering the remaining quarter of the plate * Skimmed or semi-skimmed milk, or fermented milk products * Water * Bread with vegetable margarine or a butter-margarine blend * Berries or fruit for dessert Children with special dietary needs – whether in connection with religion, ethical beliefs or health issues – are entitled to a special diet without costs. School menus are designed to be suitable for most students, with minor adjustments if needed. If a child has special dietary needs, their school requires specific information about those needs to ensure food safety and the elimination of possible cross contamination. In the case of health-related special diets, schools require the assessment of a doctor, nurse, or dietitian. As with school lunches, before- and after-school snacks are used as a pedagogical tool in teaching children about proper nutrition, table manners, and food culture. Snacks are designed to offer variety and take into consideration Finnish Nutrition Recommendations as well as children’s individual needs. ====The School Lunch Diploma==== Finland has no national accreditation system to evaluate the quality of school lunches. However, by the end of 2015, over 200 schools had been awarded the School Lunch Diploma. The diploma certifies a school's commitment to the national standards and recommendations for nutritionally, educationally, and ecologically sustainable school lunches. It is also an indication of excellent collaboration among interest groups within the school. The School Lunch Diploma is coordinated by the Finnish Kitchen Professionals Association. ===France==History==== In the 1970s, the French government began to work on improving school lunches. In 1971, the government established nutritional guidelines for French school meals. The 1971 food recommendation guidelines stated that each meal should contain raw vegetables, such as salads and fruits; protein in the form of milk or other dairy products; cooked vegetables twice per week; and carbohydrates on the remaining days. ====Current status==== In France, lunch is considered the most important meal of the day. Students can get lunch at school or go home for it. The lunch break is one to two hours long. French students are taught to take time to savor and enjoy their meals. Students have to pay for cafeteria lunches; the cost of the meal varies by region. A student's family pays for half of the meal, while the school pays for the remainder. For example, a typical meal may cost $6, with the family paying $3 instead of the full price. ====Contents and nutritional guidelines==== The 2001 food recommendation guidelines, signed by the Minister for National Education, state that school lunches must be healthy and balanced. Menus vary daily, and are posted for parents. Specifically, the guidelines state that: * There should be very little fat in school foods * School meals must contain vitamins and minerals * The main course of each school meal must contain meat, fish, or eggs School cafeterias serve five-course meals, even for preschoolers. Schoolchildren eat the same things as adults. A school lunch in France contains an appetizer, salad, main course, cheese plate, and dessert. Bread may accompany each meal. A menu might include potato leek soup, carrot and bean salad, lamb with saffron, an assortment of cheeses, and grapefruit. Each meal is accompanied with water. French schools do not have vending machines. ===Italy=== School meals in Italy provide regular Italian cuisine, although they may vary among regions and towns. The Italian government is very \\"down to people\\" and is doing a large-scale study to measure and involve students in food habits, diets, and food choices. However, many parents struggle for the right to pack home meals for their children since school food is rather expensive. ===Norway=== Norwegian school lunches were supplied from Sweden during World War II, partly privately financed. Later, all public school lunches were discontinued, so most Norwegian students bring a packed lunch from home. In 2007, schools began providing one free piece of fruit each day for all pupils in grades 8–10. Norwegian schools also sell subsidized milk. ===Sweden=== School lunches have been free in Swedish elementary schools since 1973. The government or municipality covers all charges. Normally, school lunches are buffet-style. Buffets chiefly include potatoes, pasta or rice; meat or fish; and vegetables. Milk and water are usually offered as drinks. There are also vegetarian options, as well as foods that meet religious requirements; these foods are also free of charge. Upper secondary schools do not have to provide meals for their students, but many, both public and charter schools do. Usually, each municipality signs a private contract with a catering company which provides school food. Many of the food products are imported, but still have a good standard. In many schools, teachers or the school principal eat with the pupils, with the goal of creating a stronger connection between students and school authorities. In Swedish schools there are also international food weeks, or vegetarian weeks. ===United Kingdom==History==== School meal programs in the United Kingdom can be traced back to the Education (Provision of Meals) Act 1906. In 1944, the United Kingdom required local authorities to provide school dinners that were consistent with legal nutritional requirements. The government paid the full cost of school meals in 1947. Free school meals were available to children with families on very low incomes. As a result, from the 1950s onward, staple traditional \\"school dinner\\" foods became embedded in the national psyche. \\"School puddings\\" in particular refers to desserts historically served with school dinners in state and private schools. Examples include tarts such as gypsy tart and Manchester tart, and hot puddings such as spotted dick and treacle sponge pudding. In the 1980s, Margaret Thatcher's Conservative government ended entitlement to free meals for thousands of children, and obliged local authorities to open up provision of school meals to competitive tender. This was intended to reduce the cost of school meals provided by local authorities. However, it caused a substantial decrease in the standard of school food. A 1999 survey by the Medical Research Council suggested that despite rationing, children in 1950 had healthier diets than their counterparts in the 1990s, with more nutrients and less fat and sugar. This became a major topic of debate in 2004, when chef Jamie Oliver spearheaded a campaign to improve the quality of school meals. At this time, school dinners at state schools were normally made by outside caterers. The schools sold a lot of deep-fried fast food, like chips, fried turkey nuggets, pizza, and pies. After the \\"Jamie's School Dinners\\" programme was shown on Channel 4, sections of the public showed support for increased school meal funding, causing the government to create the School Food Trust. This topic became a factor in the 2005 UK general election. Martha Payne's blog NeverSeconds, which discussed the quality of school meals at her primary school in Lochgilphead, made national headlines after gaining support from Jamie Oliver. ====Current status==== Since September 2014, all infant pupils in England's schools have been entitled to a free hot meal at lunchtime every day. This was an initiative of Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, who launched the plan at the Liberal Democrats conference in 2013. At the initiative's inception, the government was paying £2.30 for each meal taken by newly eligible pupils. The British government uses entitlement to free school meals as a measure of deprivation. For the financial year 2014-2015, the government paid schools a premium of £1,300 for primary-aged pupils, or £935 for secondary-aged pupils, for each eligible child. 11% of families entitled to free meals do not claim them, which means that their schools do not receive the extra funding. It was unclear in 2014 how this would be affected by the introduction of universal free meals for the youngest British schoolchildren. Since January 2015, the Scottish government has provided free school meals for all children in Primary One to Three. In August 2019 it was revealed that local government planning for a No-deal Brexit encompassed the possibility of needing to change legal requirements underpinning the provision of school meals, for example by making them more expensive or less healthy; possibly even discarding the requirements entirely. One council also said that \\"special dietary requirements may be difficult to meet\\" and that fresh food might have to be replaced with frozen and tinned goods, while another mentioned the possibility of a return to rationing. ====Advocacy==== The National Union of Teachers supports free school meals for all children. Fiona Twycross campaigned to persuade the Labour Party to commit to providing universal free school meals. She argues that according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies and the National Centre for Social Research, free school meals for all students significantly increases attainment in schools. ==AsiaChina=== A typical school lunch in the People's Republic of China includes staple food, meat diet, vegetable dish, and each school has different kind of dishes. Students can choose between two and three dishes according to their preferences, with a staple food, usually rice. In impoverished rural areas, students' access to nutritious food is limited. The government has funded \\"nutritious lunch\\" schemes in rural public schools to combat malnutrition. Government data from June 2017 indicated that 48% of schools were unable to fully meet recommended nutrition standards. ===India=== School meals are provided for free at public schools in India. ====History==== The roots of India's school meal program can be traced back to the pre-independence era, when a mid day meal programme was introduced in 1925 in Madras Corporation by the British administration. This was one of the oldest free food programmes for schoolchildren. In 1975, the Indian government created the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) programme. Under the Midday Meal Scheme, government high schools and partially aided schools, along with Anganwadis, provide midday meals to students. As of 2019, the total cost of providing free meals to students in India is Rs 18000 crore ($ 2.45 billion) of which 60% is paid by the federal government and 40% is paid by the states. By 1998, India had deployed the National Programme of Nutritional Support to Primary Education (NP-NSPE) scheme. During the 2013-2014 school year, the scheme covered 104 million children in 1.16 million schools. ====Contents==== A single afternoon lunch usually contains a cereal which is locally available, made in a way that conforms to prevailing local customs. Each child receives milk, and either soup or vegetables cooked as curry. Under the scheme of the Indian government, each primary level student must be provided with 100 grams of food grains each day, along with 20 grams of pulses, 50 grams of leafy vegetables and 5 grams of oil and fat. For upper- primary and senior students, they must be provided with 150 grams of food food grains, 30 grams of pulses, 75 grams of leafy vegetables and 7.5 grams of oil and fat. In accordance with nutritional guidelines, primary level students are given 450 grams of calories and 12 grams of proteins each day and senior and upper-primary level students are given 700 grams of calories and 20 grams of proteins each day. For micro-nutrients like vitamins, iron and folic acid tablets, students can get them from the National Health Mission. Children in private schools usually carry their own lunch boxes. Many schools also have canteens, and street food vendors can often be found in front of school campuses. === Iran === In the 1960s, Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi had intended a non-violent regeneration of Iranian society through economic and social reforms called the White Revolution. The reforms' long-term goal was to transform Iran into a global economic and industrial power. The White Revolution consisted of 19 elements that were introduced over a period of 15 years. In 1975, the Shah started a program for 'Free and Compulsory Education and a daily free meal' for all children from kindergarten to 14 years of age. It provided one-third of a pint of free milk to all children in Iran, as well as pistachios, fresh fruit, and biscuits. ===Japan=== Reproduced Japanese school lunch 1970s ====History==== In Japan, students set and clean the tables In Japan, the tradition of providing school lunches started in the early 20th century. After World War II, which brought near-famine conditions to the country, the Japanese government re-introduced school lunches in urban areas. School lunch was extended to all elementary schools in Japan in 1952. With the enactment of the School Lunch Law in 1954, school meals were extended to junior high schools as well. These early lunches initially included items such as bread, bread rolls, and skimmed milk powder (replaced in 1958 by milk bottles and cartons). Later, lunches were expanded to include flour donated by an American charity; a dessert; and a dish (such as daikon) that changed daily. Other dishes included inexpensive protein such as stewed bean dishes, fried white fish, and, until the 1970s, whale meat. Provisions of rice were introduced in 1976, following a surplus of government-distributed Japanese rice, and became increasingly frequent during the 1980s. Hamburg steak, stew and Japanese curry became staples as well. ====Current status==== As of 2004, 99% of elementary school students and 82% of junior high school students in Japan ate kyūshoku (school lunch). The food is grown locally, is almost never frozen, and (barring dietary restrictions) is the same for every student. Children in most districts cannot bring their own meals to school until they reach high school, nor do schools have vending machines; instead, children are taught to eat what they are served. In both elementary school and middle school, students put on white coats and caps and serve their classmates, who then all eat together in their classrooms instead of in a cafeteria. To make lunches affordable for students, municipalities pay for the labor costs, while parents, who are billed monthly, pay for the ingredients. These typically cost about 250 to 300 yen (about USD $3) per meal per student. There are reduced- price and free options for poorer families. ====Contents and nutritional guidelines==== The daily bento boxes are designed by nutritionists to provide a balanced yet tasty meal for schoolchildren, working especially to appeal to picky or unhealthy eaters. According to Chico Harlan: Common dishes range from Asian myeon, tom yam, and ma po tofu, to Western foods such as spaghetti, stew, and clam chowder. ===Malaysia=== \\"One Malaysia\\" School Milk, provided as part of a Government Program to enhance health of school children In most Malaysian schools, regardless of whether they are public or private schools, students eat in a canteen where they purchase food and drinks from vendors. School canteens usually offer Malay, Chinese, and Indian foods, with varieties of rice, noodles, and breads. The average Malaysian school canteen offers varieties of Nasi Lemak, Nasi Goreng, Chicken Rice, Popiah, and Laksa. School canteens sell food and drinks at reduced prices. Underprivileged students can apply for the free-food program which, depending on the school, is either sponsored by the school's parent-teacher association or by the Ministry of Education. Low-income students may also be eligible for the School Milk Program, which is funded by milk companies and non-governmental organizations. ===Philippines=== School meals in the Philippines appear to be relatively simplistic, consisting mainly of rice, meat, and gravy. ===Singapore=== School meals in most Singaporean primary and secondary schools, as well as junior colleges, are provided in each school's canteen (or tuckshop). The canteens consist of stalls which sell a variety of foods as well as beverages. To cater to the many races, religions, and cultures in Singapore, canteens often offer a range of cuisines, like Chinese, Indian, Malay, and Western foods. To encourage healthier eating habits among children, the Health Promotion Board of Singapore launched the Healthy Eating in Schools Programme, which gives an award to schools which serve healthy meals. To receive the award, schools must reduce the sugar content in drinks and desserts, serve fewer deep-fried and fatty foods, and include two servings of greens in their meals. ===South Korea=== A South Korean school lunch School lunches in South Korea include traditional foods like rice and kimchi (fermented cabbage). Other dishes may include sesame leaves stuffed with rice and covered with honey sauce; pumpkin potato soup; pancakes made of egg batter and green onions, with optional peppers and octopus; and cucumber-and-carrot salads. In most schools, the students set and hand out the various dishes, and then clean them up. === United Arab Emirates === Due to the economic boom, obesity has developed into a known health concern amongst adolescents in the United Arab Emirates. The past three decades have seen the largest increases in child obesity. Studies have shown that rates of obesity among the UAE's schoolchildren have surpassed the child obesity rates in both the United States and Europe. Traditional cuisine in the Persian Gulf region, once high-fibre and low-fat, has become Westernized, and now consists of many more high-fat, high-sodium, and high- cholesterol foods. Exercise levels among children have also decreased rapidly, causing the surge of obesity in adolescents. ==North AmericaCanada=== Children eating their lunch in a Montreal school, 1943 Canada has no national school meal program, and elementary schools are usually not equipped with kitchen facilities. Parents are generally expected to provide a packed lunch for their children to take to school, or have their children return home to eat during the lunch period. However, some non-profit organizations dedicated to student nutrition programs do exist. Most Canadian middle schools (grades 6-8) and high schools (grades 9-12) have cafeterias that serve hot meals. ===United States=== Recipient of the U.S. School Lunch Program in 1936 ====History==== School lunches at the national level began as a temporary New Deal project in 1933. By 1935 it was run by the WPA in 1935-42, as a way to employ the unemployed, feed hungry children, and reduce crop surpluses. It was ended in World War II when the WPA closed. In 1937 the WPA reported, \\"In the past year and a half 80,000,000 hot well-balanced meals have been served at the rate of 500,000 daily in 10,000 schools throughout the country.\\"Ellen S. Woodward, \\"Hot Lunches for a Million School Children\\" online The permanent National School Lunch Program was created in 1946, with the National School Lunch Act. This legislation won rural support because it removed surplus food from the market and thus raised prices paid to farmers. Congress intended these meals to promote and protect child nutrition, while also supporting the consumption of American farm products. ====Current status==== Chicken, sweet and spicy baked beans, and glazed carrots were part of the new recipe served to students in Chicago schools, 2011 Today, the National School Lunch Program is a federal nutrition assistance program operating in over 101,000 public schools, non-profit private schools, and residential care institutions. It is regulated and administered at the federal level by the Food and Nutrition Service of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). The program provides \\"nutritionally balanced meals\\" at low or no cost to more than 31 million children each school day. Since its inception, the Program has expanded substantially. It now includes the School Breakfast Program, the Snack Program, a Child and Adult Care Food Program, and the Summer Food Service Program. At the State level, the National School Lunch Program is usually administered by state education agencies, which operate the program through agreements with school food authorities. School meal programs in the United States provide meals free of charge, or at a reduced (government- subsidized) price, to the children of low-income families. Those who do not qualify for free or reduced price are charged a nominal fee. Some issues stem students individual needs and the increase in food allergies ====Contents and nutritional guidelines==== School lunches must meet the applicable recommendations of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. These guidelines state that no more than 30 percent of an individual's calories should come from fat, and less than 10 percent from saturated fat. Regulations also state that school lunches must provide one-third of the Recommended Dietary Allowances of protein, Vitamin A, Vitamin C, iron, calcium, and calories. School lunches must meet federal nutrition requirements over the course of one week's worth of lunches. However, local school food authorities may make decisions about which specific foods to serve and how they are prepared. Former First Lady Michelle Obama with students in Virginia sampling healthy meals being introduced by the United States Department of Agriculture A recent advocate of nutritional lunches was Michelle Obama. Since the Healthy, Hunger- Free Act of 2010 Michelle Obama has worked diligently to defend the importance of healthy school lunches but, has not been successful in her efforts. Schools, specifically in the United states, are having difficulty enforcing nutrition values in fear of being wasteful because children are no longer eating their lunches. Information gathered from students, schools, and food service experts prompted that they cannot met the regulations required for the Healthy, Hunger-Free Act of 2010. Providing schools with whole grains, whole milk, and reduced sodium levels was a part of the act, but the Senate would not fully comply. To compromise, they agreed to serve more fruits and vegetables, more whole grains and reduce the sodium levels. The levels of sodium were to be reduced but these efforts have been postponed for at least 3 years due to inappropriate planning. To avoid further conflict between the senate and the administration, the USAD has tolerated exemptions pertaining to the whole grain standard and allowed schools to do what they find necessary to finding a more fitting solution. Vending machines in schools are also a major source of competitive food for students. Under pressure from parents and anti- obesity advocates, many school districts moved to ban sodas, junk foods, and candy from vending machines and cafeterias. Various laws have also been passed to limit foods sold in school vending machines. With increasing concern over traditional vending machines in schools, healthier vending options have gained popularity and are steadily being adopted by schools around the nation. Marketing for such \\"healthy vending machines\\" states that they allow students to perform better in school while also attaining better health. ==AfricaNigeria=== In April 2012, the State of Osun in Nigeria pioneered a statewide school meals programme for all public elementary school pupils. It is called the O'Meals programme (an acronym for the Osun Elementary School Feeding and Health Programme). As of July 2014, it was providing lunch to over 252,000 children in 100% of Osun's elementary schools. In addition to staples such as rice, beans, and yams served with stews, soups, and vegetables, the programme provides daily fruits. Its estimated cost is N50 (USD $0.31) per child per day. According to a report on O'Meals' benefits: All food items are sourced locally from farmers and others on the supply chain, enhancing employment within the state. Addressing child malnutrition has raised students' academic performance, and has increased school enrollment by 24% compared to figures from before April 2012. In 2015, the manifesto of the All Progressives Congress (APC) advocated for the adoption of a nationwide free meal plan. Since he became President, Muhammadu Buhari has made the implementation of this policy one of his foremost priorities. A national School Meals programme is the subject of a budgetary proposal before the National Assembly. Also, the government of Kaduna State has implemented a school feeding programme. ==Oceania Australia === The Healthy Kids Association (previously The Healthy Kids School Canteen Association) is a not- for-profit, non-governmental, health promotion organization based in Sydney, Australia. It is a peak organisation for school canteens in New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory (ACT). In Australia, many school canteens have returned to offering junk food, or pupils have started buying fast food outside their schools. The association has developed policies intended to counter these trends; in some schools, they have taken over providing school food. In response to the 2002 Childhood Obesity Summit, former Premier of New South Wales Bob Carr launched the \\"Fresh Tastes NSW Healthy School Canteen Strategy.\\" Healthy Kids has become a key partner of the Ministry of Health in developing this plan. The strategy is to develop a taste for healthier foods among schoolchildren by promoting and featuring healthier menu options, while limiting the availability of less nutritious foods. The program's menu guide was partially created by Rosemary Stanton. ===New Zealand=== Until 2020, New Zealand did not have any school meal programme, aside from board-run school breakfasts that were not provided by central government. After assuming office, New Zealand's Labour-led government announced 20,000 children would benefit from school lunches by 2021. Jacinda Ardern has said this programme will be dramatically expanded to 200,000 students by the end of 2021 (25% of national school rolls) should she retain office. ==See also== * Personal, Social and Health Education * School breakfast club * School feeding in low- income countries * School Food Trust * School Health Education Study * School health services * School Meals Initiative for Healthy Children * Vegan school meal General: * Food choice * Nutrition * Childhood obesity * Welfare ==NotesReferencesFurther reading== * Australia ** ** ** * Japan ** Sanborn, Alexis Agliano (March 2013). \\"Flavoring the Nation: School Lunch in Japan\\" (Harvard University Master's thesis) ** JapaneseSchoolLunch.com * The United States ** Levine, Susan (2010).

It is the oldest and arguably the largest pro-democracy group operating inside Iran despite having never been able to recover the prominence it had in the early 1950s. Initially, the front was an umbrella organization for a broad spectrum of forces with nationalist, liberal-democratic, socialist, bazaari, secular and Islamic tendencies, that mobilized to successfully campaign for the nationalization of the Iranian oil industry. In 1951, the Front formed a government which was deposed by the 1953 Iranian coup d'état and subsequently repressed. Members attempted to revive the Front in 1960, 1965 and 1977. Before 1953 and throughout the 1960s, the Front was torn by strife between secular and religious elements; over time its coalition split into various squabbling factions, with the Front gradually emerging as the leading organization of secular liberalsAbrahamian, Ervand (1989). Radical Islam: the Iranian Mojahedin. I.B.Tauris. p.47. with nationalist members adhering to liberal democracy and social democracy. During the Iranian Revolution, the Front supported the replacement of the old monarchy by an Islamic Republic and was the main symbol of the \\"nationalist\\" tendency in the early years of post-revolutionary government. It was banned in July 1981, and although it remains under constant surveillance and officially it is still illegal, it is still active inside Iran. ==Mossadegh era (1949–1953)== Mohammed Mosaddegh, Founder of National Front The National Front had its roots in a protest against ballot-rigging, where Mohammad Mosaddegh led a peaceful procession from his house to the Marble Palace on 15 October 1949, threatened to take sanctuary in a major mosque or shrine, and was eventually allowed into the palace with 19 other people, where they stayed for four days. The Shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, eventually gave in and promised fair and honest elections. After the sit-in, the leaders of the protest formed the National Front and elected Mossadegh to be its chairman. The Front was conceived to be a broad alliance of like-minded associations (rather than individuals, as in a normal political party) with the aim of strengthening democracy, press freedom, and constitutional government. The most important groups in the Front were the Iran Party, the Toilers Party, the National Party, and the Tehran Association of Bazaar Trade and Craft Guilds.Âbrâhâmiân, Ervand, A History of Modern Iran, Cambridge University Press, 2008, p. 115 Soon after its founding, the National Front opposed the existing Western domination and control of Iran's natural resources, and related revenues, which began with colonialist concessions given during the Qajar Dynasty. By the mid-1950s, Iran's oil assets were owned by the Anglo- Iranian Oil Company, whose predecessor company bought the concession from William Knox D'Arcy.All the Shah's Men: An American Coup and the Roots of Middle East Terror, by Stephen Kinzer, (John Wiley and Sons, 2003), p. 33 D'Arcy had negotiated the concession in 1901 with Mozzafar al-Din Shah Qajar, the Shah of Persia, who granted a 60-year petroleum search concession in a transaction in which no money changed hands.Elwell-Sutton, L. P. Persian Oil: A Study in Power Politics (Lawrence and Wishart Ltd.: London) 1955. p. 15 For most of the first half of the twentieth century, Iran's oil was the British government's single largest overseas investment; 51 percent of the company was owned by the British government.\\"The Company File—From Anglo-Persian Oil to BP Amoco\\" The AIOC, which later became BP, consistently violated the terms of the agreement that had been updated in 1933, and was reluctant to change the terms of the agreement even as Iran's movement for nationalization grew in the late 1940s.U.S. Foreign Policy and the Shah: Building a Client State in Iran by Mark J. Gasiorowski (Cornell University Press: 1991) p. 59 Although AIOC was highly profitable, \\"its Iranian workers were poorly paid and lived in squalid conditions.\\" The goal of the National Front was to nationalize Iran's oil resources and to counteract British dominance of Iran's internal affairs by initiating direct relations with the United States. The Front became the governing coalition when it took office in April 1951, with Mosaddegh elected Prime Minister. Mosaddegh's minister of foreign affairs Hosseyn Fâtemi enforced the \\"Oil Nationalization Act\\", passed by the Majlis in March and ratified by the Senate. The Act, reluctantly signed by the Shah, called for nationalization of the assets held by AIOC, from which the government of Iran had hitherto only received minimal compensation. This led to British counter- moves and the loss of nearly all income during the Abadan Crisis. Following Britain's request, U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower authorized the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to overthrow the Mossadegh government, in an event known as the 1953 Iranian coup d'état. Prior to the coup, the National Front was made up of four main parties; the Iran Party, which was founded in 1946 as a platform for Iranian liberals, including figures such as Karim Sanjâbi, Gholam Hossein Sadighi, Ahmad Zirakzadeh and Allah-Yar Saleh; the Toilers Party of the Iranian Nation (a left-wing party that advocated a non-communist socialist Iran, led by Mozzafar Baghai and Khalil Maleki); and the Mojâhedine Eslâm (an Islamic party led by Âyatollâh Âbol-Ghâsem Kâšâni). The Essential Middle East: A Comprehensive Guide by Dilip Hiro ==Second and Third National Front== In the aftermath of the 1953 coup, the National Front was outlawed and its highest-ranking leaders arrested and brought before a military court. The military coup established Mohammad Reza Shah as the supreme ruler of Iran, although nominal power was held by Prime Minister Fazlollah Zahedi (who was paid by the CIA to help overthrow Mossadegh and strengthen the power of the monarchy). In an atmosphere of police repression, several former members of the National Front (mostly low-ranking leaders) established an underground network called the National Resistance Movement. This group included future prime ministers Mehdi Bazargan and Shapour Bakhtiar, and its aim was to reestablish democracy by campaigning for free and fair elections. Its activities were largely restricted to peacefully distributing flyers and attempting to regulate the 1954 Majlis elections (which in the end were rigged in favor of pro-Shah candidates). It disintegrated under pressure from the state; however, the Second National Front was formed in 1960, which consisted of prominent people such as Karim Sanjabi, Mehdi Bazargan, Allahyar Saleh, Shapour Bakhtiar, Adib Boroumand, Asqar Pârsâ, Dâryuš Foruhar, Qolâm Hosseyn Sadiqi, Mohamad Ali Xonji and others. Its aim was to return Mohammad Mossadegh to the premiership and to reestablish the constitutional monarchy. Initially, it seemed as if this organization was gaining in strength. However, the group's leaders fell into disagreements over questions such as the organization of the Front, tactics against the Shah's regime, and the form of government to which the National Front ought to commit itself. These disputes led to tension between the high-ranking leaders and the student activists; in 1961, Bazargan, Mahmoud Taleghani (a prominent Islamic cleric) and others formed the Freedom Movement of Iran (FMI) which was committed to a democratic state in which the Islamic religion would play a substantial role in state and society (as opposed to the more secular orientation of the National Front). Another issue arose over the appointment in April 1961 of Dr. Ali Amini to the premiership. It was widely believed that the Shah had chosen Amini under pressure from the Kennedy Administration in the United States; partly for this reason, the National Front's leaders persistently refused to collaborate with or lend support to Amini's government. However, political turmoil grew worse; Amini stepped down from the premiership in 1962, owing to his dispute with the Shah over the former's plans to reduce the military budget. In June the following year, a huge religious uprising occurred in the cities of Tehran, Qom, Mashad, Shiraz and Varamin, which was put down with ruthless force by the Iranian army. The unrest had been sparked by the arrest of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, a vocal critic of the Shah and his program of land reforms and granting women the right to vote. Around this time, the Third National Front was formed, which consisted of the FMI (religious-nationalists; Melli- Mazhabis), the Iran Nation Party (the party of Dâryuš Foruhar; Hezb-e Mellat-e Iran), the Society of Iranian Socialists (led by Khalil Maleki, a prominent personality of the Mossadegh era who had been prohibited from joining the Second National Front due to his past history in the Tudeh Party) and the student activists. The Second and Third National Fronts differed largely in their tactical approach to facing the Shah's regime. The former believed in patiently negotiating with the Shah and the higher officials in the hope of peacefully bringing about a democracy. In contrast to this passive approach, the Third National Front advocated a strategy of civil disobedience and protests in the hope of either forcing the regime to come to terms with the opposition or face collapse. By 1964, however, Mohammad Reza Shah had consolidated his control of both his regime and the country, and he quickly moved to further guarantee his position by increasing the powers of SAVAK (the state's intelligence agency), which was infamous for the torture and killings it inflicted on the opposition and even on ordinary Iranians who merely uttered any wrong words against the regime. In this new atmosphere of police terror, the National Front virtually ceased to exist (though exile branches continued to operate in the United States and Europe). ==Iranian Revolution== The National Front was revived in late 1977 by Karim Sanjabi (former minister of education under Mossadegh and now the leader of the Front), Shapour Bakhtiar (former deputy minister of labor under Mossadegh and now the leader of the Iran Party) and Dâryuš Foruhar (head of the Iran Nation Party). The three signed an open letter which politely criticized the Shah and called on him to re-establish the constitutional monarchy, free political prisoners, respect freedom of speech, and hold free and fair elections. For some months (under pressure from the Carter Administration), many educated and liberal- minded Iranians were now able to voice their grievances against the regime of the Shah. In January 1978, violence erupted in the holy city of Qom over the publication of an article in a pro-government newspaper which attacked Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini as a British agent and a reactionary. Despite the threatening existence of SAVAK and the harsh crackdown unleashed by the regime on the protesters, the unrest grew and spread to other cities such as Tabriz, which was rocked by riots and briefly seized by rebels. By late 1978, almost the whole country (not just the organized opposition) was inflamed with hatred towards the Shah and rioting, protests and street clashes with the police and army grew in intensity and bloodshed. By this time, Ayatollah Khomeini was now recognized as the undisputed spiritual leader of the uprising. Sanjabi, as representative of the Front, came to Paris, and emerged from his meeting with Khomeini \\"with a short declaration that spoke of both Islam and democracy as basic principles,\\"Modern Iran Nikki R. Keddie, Yann Richard p. 233 and committed the National Front to the twin goals of abolishing the monarchy and establishing a democratic and Islamic government in its place. This was a diversion from the National Front's long-held aim of reforming the monarchy, and it caused some friction in the high council (although most of the rank and file and leaders supported the new orientation). The friction blew into open division when Shapour Bakhtiar, one of the three top leaders, accepted the Shah's invitation to become the prime minister of Iran, but only on the condition that the Shah committed himself to reign and not rule. Bakhtiar's decision to collaborate with the Shah caused the National Front to denounce him as a traitor to their cause and to expel him from the organization. Only a few moderate and secular individuals among the leadership chose to ally with Bakhtiar and with the monarchy. On 16 January, the Shah left the country, amid rejoicing among the populace, and on 11 February, the regime collapsed and Ayatollah Khomeini became the political leader of Iran. At first the National Front supported the new Provisional Revolutionary Government and the establishment of the Islamic Republic. But the joint statement with Sanjabi notwithstanding, Khomeini \\"explicitly refused to put the same word, democracy, into either the title of the Republic or its constitution.\\" Within a short time, it became clear that Ayatollah Khomeini's model of an Islamic society was modeled not on democracy, but on theocratic rule of Islamic jurists (or velayat-e faqih), and traditional Islamic sharia law. ===1981 suppression=== Perhaps the revolution's climactic confrontation between Khomeini's theocrats and the National Front occurred in June 1981 after parliament approved the law of retribution (qisas, aka blood revenge or \\"an eye for an eye\\"). The National Front called upon the people of Tehran to participate in a demonstration for 15 June 1981. > The Front intended the meeting to serve as the focus for the middle classes, > the bazaar, and the left wing.

Khomeini declared that 'The National Front is condemned as of today,'Brumberg, Daniel, Reinventing Khomeini : The Struggle for Reform in Iran, University of Chicago Press, 2001, p. 116, 15 June 1981 and that all opponents of the law of retribution were apostatessource: Jombari-ye Eslami, 15.6.81-16.6.81, quoted in Brumberg, Daniel, Reinventing Khomeini : The Struggle for Reform in Iran, University of Chicago Press, 2001, p. 147 and threatened the leaders of the Front with the death penalty if they did not repent.

F-WTSS on display at the French air museum in Le Bourget Airport. The two prototype aircraft were used to expand the flight envelope of the aircraft as quickly as possible and prove that the design calculations for supersonic flight were correct. * F-WTSS (production designation 001) was the first Concorde to fly, on 2 March 1969, and was retired on arrival at the French air museum at Le Bourget Airport on 19 October 1973, having made 397 flights covering 812 hours, of which 255 hours were at supersonic speeds. It remains in its Solar Eclipse mission livery complete with rooftop portholes. ** Concorde 001 was modified for the 1973 solar eclipse mission with rooftop portholes and observation equipment. Its flight over Africa became the longest observation of a solar eclipse, lasting some 74 minutes. * G-BSST (002) first flew on 9 April 1969 from Filton to RAF Fairford. Its last flight was on 4 March 1976 when it flew to the Fleet Air Arm Museum at the Royal Naval Air Station Yeovilton, England. It had made 438 flights (836 hours), of which 196 flights were supersonic. ==Pre-production aircraft== Both pre-production aircraft were used to further develop the design of the aircraft. Changes to design include different wing plan form, more fuel, different engine standard and different air intake systems. Concorde G-AXDN (101) in the AirSpace exhibition hall at Imperial War Museum Duxford. *Concorde G-AXDN (101) first flew on 17 December 1971 from Filton and was retired to the Imperial War Museum Duxford, England, where it landed on 20 August 1977, having made 269 flights (632 hours), of which 168 flights were supersonic. *Concorde F-WTSA (102) first flew on 10 January 1973 from Toulouse. It was the fourth aircraft and the first to have the features and the shape of the future production aircraft. It was the first to fly to the United States (on 20 September 1973 to Dallas, Texas). For several years the aircraft was painted in British Airways colours on one side and Air France colours on the other. It made 314 flights (656 hours), of which 189 were supersonic, and was then retired to Orly Airport in Paris on 20 May 1976, where it is on display to the public. ==Development aircraft== The production aircraft were different in many ways from the original aircraft, necessitating re-examining certain areas to obtain certification. In all there were six \\"development\\" aircraft: the two prototypes (001/002), two pre-production (101/102) and two production aircraft (201/202). *F-WTSB (201) first flew on 6 December 1973 from Toulouse. Its last flight was on 19 April 1985 from Chateauroux to Toulouse; a total of 909 flying hours. It is currently inside the Aeroscopia museum near the Airbus factory at Toulouse. *G-BBDG (202) first flew on 13 December 1974 from Filton to RAF Fairford. It last flew on 24 December 1981 after a total of 1282 hours. Subsequently, it was stored in a hangar on the Filton Airfield and was used as a spare parts source by BA for their Concorde fleet. It was sectioned and moved by road in May/June 2004 to the Brooklands Museum in Weybridge, Surrey, where after restoration it was opened to the public in the summer of 2006. ==British production aircraft== British Airways had seven production aircraft in commercial service: *G-BOAC (204) The flagship of the fleet (because of its BOAC registration) first flew on 27 February 1975 from Filton. It made its final flight to Manchester Airport – where a \\"glass hangar\\" was later built at the viewing park for its display – on 31 October 2003 after flying 22,260 hours. *G-BOAA (206) first flew on 5 November 1975 from Filton. This aircraft flew with the Red Arrows on 2 June 1996 to celebrate 50 years of Heathrow Airport. It last flew on 12 August 2000 as BA002 from New York JFK to London Heathrow after flying 22,768 hours, and did not receive modifications after the Paris crash. For its final journey it was transported to the National Museum of Flight (run by National Museums Scotland), East Fortune, near Edinburgh, over land to the Thames, then by sea to Torness, then over land again to the museum from 8 to 19 April 2004. Concorde G-BOAB in storage at London (Heathrow) Airport, following the end of all Concorde flights *G-BOAB (208) first flew on 18 May 1976 from Filton. Its last flight was a positioning flight on 15 August 2000 as BA002P from New York JFK to London Heathrow after flying 22,296 hours. It remains at Heathrow Airport. It was never modified, and so never flew again after returning home following the Paris crash. G-BOAB was used by British Airways to carry out a test installation of the 'Project Rocket' interior that was later installed on the rest of the fleet, before remaining stationary for several years with its interior stripped, with boxes of magazines being used as ballast, and being periodically towed to various locations around the airport. Following minor restoration works in 2015 and 2017, the aircraft is used for apprentice training by BA. Concorde G-BOAD on 15 May 2003. *G-BOAD (210) first flew on 25 August 1976 from Filton. It was repainted with Singapore Airlines livery on the left side and British Airways livery on the rightAircraft 210: G-BOAD for a joint service by the two airlines between Bahrain and Singapore International Airport at Paya Lebar for three months in 1977, and from 1979 to 1981. This aircraft made the fastest Atlantic crossing by any Concorde on 7 February 1996, taking off from New York JFK and landing in London Heathrow 2 hours, 52 minutes, and 59 seconds later.Intrepid Museum Exhibits It departed from Heathrow for the final time on 10 November 2003 and flew to JFK, from where it was then transferred (on a barge originally used to move Space shuttle external fuel tanks), to the Intrepid Sea-Air-Space Museum, New York, past the Statue of Liberty and up the Hudson River. Its engines were removed to reduce weight. Its temporary home was on a barge alongside the aircraft carrier Intrepid, pending the proposed creation of a quayside display hall; however, in December 2006, this Concorde was moved to Floyd Bennett Field in Brooklyn, where it was kept in poor conditions.Concorde Sst : Latest News G-BOAD's nose cone was knocked off by a truck at the end in June 2008. The damage was repaired and subsequently the aircraft was moved back to Pier 86 in Manhattan (and placed on the pier, rather than on a barge) on 20 October 2008 as part of the Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum. G-BOAD spent more time in the air than any other Concorde, at 23,397 hours. *G-BOAE (212) first flew on 17 March 1977 from Filton. On 1 July 1999 it flew in formation with the Red Arrows to mark the opening of the Scottish Parliament. Its last flight was to Grantley Adams International Airport in Bridgetown (Barbados) on 17 November 2003, with 70 members of BA staff on board. The flight, lasting less than 4 hours, reached the maximum certified height of 60,000 ft (18,300 m). It flew a total of 23,376 hours. A new exhibition was constructed to house the aircraft, east of the airport at the old Spencers Plantation. Concorde G-BOAG at the Museum of Flight. *G-BOAG (214) first flew on 21 April 1978 from Filton. The aircraft flew the final Speedbird 2 service from New York on 24 October 2003, and left Heathrow for the final time on 3 November. It spent a day \\"resting\\" and refuelling in New York before making its final flight on 5 November from New York JFK to Boeing Field, Seattle in an unusual supersonic flight (which required special permission) over the sparsely populated part of northern Canada. It is currently displayed at Seattle's Museum of Flight, alongside the first 707 that served as Air Force One and the prototype Boeing 747. This Concorde was once used as a source of spares, before being restored using parts from Air France's F-BVFD, and has flown 16,239 hours. *G-BOAF (216) first flew on 20 April 1979 from Filton and was the last Concorde to be built. It made Concorde's final flight on Wednesday 26 November 2003. Departing from Heathrow at 11:30 GMT, it made a last, brief, supersonic flight, carrying 100 BA staff, over the Bay of Biscay. It then flew a \\"lap of honour\\" above Bristol, passing over Portishead, Clevedon, Weston-super-Mare, Bristol Airport and Clifton Suspension Bridge, before landing at Filton, soon after 13:00 GMT. It was met by Prince Andrew, who formally accepted its handover. It had flown a total of 18,257 hours. Until 2010, the aircraft was open for public viewing at the Airbus facility; since 2017 it has been the main exhibit at Filton's Aerospace Bristol museum. As part of tenth-anniversary celebrations on 24 December 1985, British Airways photographed G-BOAA, G-BOAC, G-BOAF and G-BOAG formation flying for their publicity material. ==French production aircraft== Air France also had seven production aircraft in commercial service: *F-BTSC (203) was the Concorde lost in the crash of Air France Flight 4590 on 25 July 2000 in the small town of Gonesse, France near Le Bourget, located just outside Paris, killing 113 people. The remains of this aircraft are stored at a hangar at Le Bourget Airport. It is the only Concorde in the history of the design to be destroyed in a crash. It was also featured in the Airport film series The Concorde ... Airport '79. It first flew on 31 January 1975 from Toulouse and flew for 11,989 hours. Concorde F-BVFA on display at Smithsonian Institution National Air and Space Museum's Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center in Chantilly, Virginia, USA. *F-BVFA (205) First flew on 27 October 1975 from Toulouse. In 1988 it flew around the world in a record-breaking 41 hours 27 minutes. It made its final flight to the Smithsonian Institution National Air and Space Museum's new Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center at Washington Dulles International Airport (USA) on 12 June 2003 after flying 17,824 hours. *F-BVFB (207) first flew on 6 March 1976 from Toulouse. It was sold for €1 to the Sinsheim Auto & Technik Museum in Germany. It flew to Karlsruhe-Baden–Baden Airpark, in south west Germany on 24 June 2003. After removal of its wings and tail fin, it traveled by barge and road, to join a Tupolev Tu-144 already on exhibit at Sinsheim. It had flown 14,771 hours. *F-BVFC (209) first flew on 9 July 1976 from Toulouse. It was retired to the Airbus plant at Toulouse, where the French aircraft were constructed, on 27 June 2003, joining 201 and ending Air France's relationship with Concorde. The final flight was supersonic, and included a go around at Toulouse. It had flown 14,332 hours. Since January 2015, it is on display outside the Aeroscopia museum near the Toulouse factory. *F-BVFD (211) first flew on 10 February 1977 from Toulouse. It was retired early, in 1982, having flown only 5,814 hours (final flight on 27 May 1982). Badly corroded after being stored outdoors, and damaged through use as a source of spare parts, it was broken up in 1994. It was the only Concorde scrapped. A small section of the fuselage remains at Le Bourget, France and the nose cone was sold to an American collector. *F-BTSD (213) first flew on 26 June 1978 from Toulouse. It was retired to the Air and Space museum at Le Bourget (France) on 14 June 2003, joining 001 after flying 12,974 hours. In 1996, this aircraft carried a promotional paint scheme (blue with logo) for Pepsi. The wings were kept white, and while in the Pepsi livery, it was restricted to flying at most 20 minutes at Mach 2.02 and otherwise Mach 1.7 (the plane normally requires a white livery to fly supersonic, because of the heat); the branding estimated to have cost Pepsi $20 million. It flew 16 flights around the Middle East in this livery. The plane also holds the world record for flying around the world in both directions: westbound in 32 hours 49 minutes and 3 seconds on 12/13 October 1992, and eastbound in 31 hours 27 minutes and 49 seconds on 15/16 August 1995. It also was the only Concorde to land in Central America and then it set a new time record between Juan Santamaria International Airport and John F. Kennedy International Airport. *F-BVFF (215) first flew on 26 December 1978 from Toulouse. It was undergoing D-check maintenance at the Air France maintenance hangar at Charles de Gaulle at the time of the 25 July 2000 crash which temporarily grounded all Concordes. After the withdrawal of the type was announced midway through refurbishment, it was cosmetically reassembled on the outside (outer shell only, no interior) and used as a display piece following the retirement of all Concordes. It last flew on a charter flight to Paris Charles de Gaulle on 11 June 2000 after flying 12,421 hours. ==List of aircraft== {| class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" |+ Aircraft ! Number ! Registration !

His father, Hussayn, was the mayor of Barsgan, a town in the southeastern part of the lake of Issyk-Kul (nowadays village of Barskoon in Northern Kyrgyzstan's Issyk-Kul Region) and related to the ruling dynasty of Kara- Khanid Khanate. ==Work== Map from Mahmud al-Kashgari's Diwan (11th century) Dīwān Lughāt al-Turk was compiled by Kashgari in the 1070s. The authorship of the works is not known. It contains linguistic data about multiple Turkic dialects that may have been gathered from merchants and others involved in trade along routes that travelled through the Oguz steppe. Scholars believe it is likely that Kashgari would have gathered most of the content about Oguz- Turkmen from Oguz tribes in Khorasan, since he himself was a student in Seljuk Baghdad, but its possible that some of this material could have come from early Turkmen. Scholars have not yet come to a settled conclusion, however. Al-Kashgari studied the Turkic languages of his time and in Baghdad he compiled the first comprehensive dictionary of Turkic languages, the ' (English: \\"Compendium of the languages of the Turks\\") in 1072-74.Kemal H. Karpat, Studies on Turkish Politics and Society:Selected Articles and Essays, (Brill, 2004), 441. It was intended for use by the Abbasid Caliphate, the new Arab allies of the Turks. Mahmud Kashgari's comprehensive dictionary, later edited by the Turkish historian, Ali Amiri,Ali Amiri, R. Mantran, The Encyclopaedia of Islam, Vol. I, ed. H.A.R. Gibb, J.H. Kramers, E. Levi- Provencal and J. Schacht, (E.J. Brill, 1986), 391. contains specimens of old Turkic poetry in the typical form of quatrains (Persio-Arabic , rubā'iyāt; ), representing all the principal genres: epic, pastoral, didactic, lyric and elegiac. His book also included the first known map of the areas inhabited by Turkic peoples. This map is housed at the National Library in Istanbul.Roudik, Peter, The History of the Central Asian Republics, (Greenwood Press, 2007), 175. He advocated monolingualism and the linguistic purism of the Turkic languages and held a belief in the superiority of nomadic people (the Turkic tribes had traditionally been nomads) over urban populations. Most of his Turkic-speaking contemporaries were bilingual in Tajik (a Persian language), which was then the urban and literary language of Central Asia. Even so, Kashgari praised the dialect spoken by the bilingual Uyghurs as \\"pure\\" and \\"most correct\\" on par with those of Turkic monolinguals.Maħmūd al-Kašğari. \\"Dīwān Luğāt al-Turk\\". Edited & translated by Robert Dankoff in collaboration with James Kelly. In Sources of Oriental Languages and Literature. (1982). Part I. p. 82-84 The non-Muslim Turks worship of Tengri was mocked and insulted by the Muslim Turk Mahmud al-Kashgari, who wrote a verse referring to them - The Infidels - May God destroy them! Kashgari claimed that the Prophet assisted in a miraculous event where 700,000 Yabāqu \\"infidels\\" were defeated by 40,000 Muslims led by Arslān Tegīn claiming that fires shot sparks from gates located on a green mountain towards the Yabāqu. The Yabaqu were a Turkic people., p. 147 Muslims used to call the Uyghur Buddhists as \\"Tats\\", which referred to the \\"Uighur infidels\\" according to the Tuxsi and Taghma, while other Turks called Persians \\"tat\\". Uyghur Buddhists used to call the muslims as \\"Chomak\\"https://web.archive.org/web/20151118063834/http://projects.iq.harvard.edu/huri/files/viii- iv_1979-1980_part1.pdf p. 160. While Kashgari displayed a different attitude towards the Turks diviners beliefs and \\"national customs\\", he expressed towards Buddhism a hatred in his Diwan where he wrote the verse cycle on the war against Uighur Buddhists. Buddhist origin words like toyin (a cleric or priest) and Burxān or Furxan (meaning Buddha, acquiring the generic meaning of \\"idol\\" in the Turkic language of Kashgari) had negative connotations to Muslim Turks. Muslim writers Mahmud Kashghārī had more some information about China in their writings, Kashgari viewed Kashgar as part of China as Tang China had controlled Kashgar as one of the Anxi protectorate's \\"Four Garrisons\\" seats. Tabgach, originally denoting the Northern Wei's dynastic clan Tuoba, referred metonymously to China in Kashgari's time, Khitay to the Khitans (Liao dynasty). Persian chīn and māchīn (چين ماچين) and Arabic ṣīn and māṣīn (صين ماصين) were names for China: after the Tang dynasty, Southern China was referred to as Machin-Masin and Northern China as Chin-Sin; although before that the names' referrents were reversed. ==Death== Some researchers think that Mahmud al-Kashgari died in 1102 at the age of 97 in Upal, a small city southwest of Kashgar, and was buried there. There is now a mausoleum erected on his gravesite. But some modern authors reject this assertion, saying that the date of his death is just unknown. Some claim Mahmad Kashghari was Hazrat Mullam. ==Legacy== He is claimed by Uyghur, Kyrgyz, and Uzbek nationalists as part of their respective ethnic groups.But some Uyghur authors consider him a member of their own ethnic group. Makhmud Kashghari himself considered the Uyghurs of his own time as the eastern neighbours of his country (the Qarakhanid khanate). See, for example, : \\"the Uzbeks, Uyghurs, and Kyrgyz all claim Mahmud al-Kashgari, the well-known 11th century scholar, as their own.\\" An oriental study university, situated in the capital city of Bishkek in post- Soviet Kyrgyzstan, was named after Makhmud Kashghari, in the 1990s.

The names are used by professors of law in common law jurisdictions, particularly in the area of real property and occasionally in contracts, to discuss the rights of various parties to a piece of land. A typical law school or bar exam question on real property might say: Where more than one estate is needed to demonstrate a pointperhaps relating to a dispute over boundaries, easements or riparian rightsa second estate will usually be called Whiteacre,Black’s Law Dictionary, “blackacre” a third, Greenacre, and a fourth, Brownacre. ==Origin== Jesse Dukeminier, author of one of the leading series of textbooks on property, traces the use of Blackacre and Whiteacre for this purpose to a 1628 treatise by Sir Edward Coke. Dukeminier suggests that the term might originate with references to colors associated with certain crops (\\"peas and beans are black, corn and potatoes are white, hay is green\\"), or with the means by which rents were to be paid, with black rents payable in produce and white rents in silver.Jesse Dukeminier and James E. Krier. Property, 5th Ed. Aspen Law and Business, 2002, p. 160n. A 1790 treatise by Francis Buller similarly uses these placeholder names, stating: \\"If A. have Black Acre and C. have White Acre, and A. has a way over White Acre to Black Acre, and then purchases White Acre, the way will be extinct; and if A. afterwards enfeoff C. of White Acre without excepting the road, it is gone\\".Francis Buller, An Introduction to the Law Relative to Trials at Nisi Prius (1790), page 74. An alternate theory is that the term arises from Civil War policy in which plots of plantation land given to recently emancipated African-American freedmen (freed slaves) during the Reconstruction period under Sherman's \\"forty acres and a mule\\" policy. Such plots were colloquially called \\"Blackacres\\". Since most of the freed slaves were illiterate, many were cheated out of their land through shady loan contracts with former plantation owners.James M. McPherson The Struggle for Equality: Abolitionists and the Negro in the Civil War and Reconstruction. Vol. 72. Princeton University Press, 1967. These disputes, along with questions of the proper contractual entitlement of the slaves to the land in the first place, provided the basis for the development of modern American contract and property law and has come to refer to situations where there exists some contention or ambiguity surrounding the rightful owner or respective rights of the parties.Paul Collier. On the economic consequences of civil war Oxf. Econ. Pap. 1999. [168–183]. In various law journals and treatises in Louisiana, which uses a unique form of the civil law influenced by but not identical to the Napoleonic Code, authors have used the term \\"arpent noir\\" as a placeholder name for the purpose of discussing rights concerning immovables. One of the more basic theories is that Blackacre and Whiteacre are related to what professors could draw on dark chalkboards in early law-school settings. A simple outline of the of property on the \\"blackboard\\" being \\"blackacre\\" and a chalk-colored-in property being \\"whiteacre\\". ==In popular culture== Because of its association with legal education, a number of legal publications and events utilize the name. For example, Blackacre was adopted as the name of the literary journal at the University of Texas School of Law. Blackacre is also the name of a journal at the University of Sydney Law School, published annually by the Sydney University Law Society, the name of the open-air courtyard and weekly student social at Vanderbilt Law School, and the name of a William Mitchell College of Law formal. The Blackacre Nature Preserve and Historic Homestead in Kentucky was so named by the donor of the land, Macauley Smith, who had been a judge on the Kentucky Court of Appeals.Blackacre Foundation website In July 2010, a legal humor website wrote an article chronicling the foreclosure sale of Blackacre.Blackacre sold in courthouse foreclosure auction at LawsForAttorneys (via archive.org); published July 22, 2010; archived March 10 2012 A group of law students in Indianapolis founded a brewery named Black Acre Brewing Co. in late 2010 as a homage to their legal schooling.BlackAcreBrewing.com Monica Youn's 2016 book of poetry from Graywolf Press is titled Blackacre, in reference to the legal concept (Youn has a law degree from Yale). ==See also== * Dewey, Cheatem & Howe, another legal placeholder name * Loamshire, a placeholder county name, used in Britain. ==References== Category:Real property law Category:Placeholder names ","title":"Blackacre"},{"id":"1997779","text":"Many foreign films have been shot in Morocco.

There are different historical accounts of the Satuq's life with some variations. Sources include Mulhaqāt al-Surāh (Supplement to the \\"Surah\\") by Jamal Qarshi (b. 1230/31) who quoted an earlier 11th-century text Tarikh-i Kashghar (History of Kashgar) by Abū-al-Futūh 'Abd al-Ghāfir ibn al-Husayn al- Alma'i, an account by Ottoman historian known as the Munajjimbashi, as well as a fragment of a manuscript in Chagatai, Tazkirah Bughra Khan (Memory of Bughra Khan). ==Origin== Satuq was said to have come from Artux, identified in the 10th century book Hudud al-'alam (The Limits of the World) as a \\"populous village of the Yaghma\\", the Yaghma being one of the Turkish tribes that formed the Karakhanids. He lost his father Bazir Arslan Khan when he was 6. His uncle married his mother in levirate marriage, thus Satuq became a step-son to Oghulchak Khan. ==Conversion to Islam== Tomb of Sultan Satuk Bughra Khan, the first Muslim khan, in 259x259px According to an account by Munajjimbashi, based on a tradition ultimately stemming from a Karakhanid emissary in 1105 to the Abbasid court, he was the first of the khans to convert to Islam under the influence of a faqīh from Bukhara. According to Tazkirah Bughra Khan, Satuq converted to Islam when he was twelve. He was taught about Islam by Samanid merchant Abu an-Nasr from Bukhara. Nasr befriended the Khan of Kashgar, Satuq's step-father and uncle Oghulchak Khan and was granted special dispensation to build a mosque in the town of Artux just outside Kashgar. Here Satuq would often come to watch the caravans arrive. When Satuq saw Nasr and other Muslims observing their daily prayers he became curious and was instructed by them in the Islamic religion. Satuq kept his faith secret from the king, but convinced his friends to convert. However, when the king heard that Satuq had become a Muslim, he demanded that (under advise of Satuq's mother) Satuq build a temple to show that he hadn't converted. Nasr advised Satuq that he should pretend to build a temple but with the intention of building a mosque in his heart. The king, after seeing Satuq starting to build the temple, then stopped him, believing that he had not converted. Afterwards, Satuq obtained a fatwa which permitted him in effect to commit patricide, and killed his father, after which he conquered Kashgar. ==Religious wars== Satuq was variously stated as twelve and a half or twenty-five when he became khan, and he began to wage religious war against non-Muslims. According to Tazkirah Bughra Khan, \\"as far as the River Amu that is before Balkh on this side towards sun-rising as far as the place called \\"Karak\\" on the north as far as the place called \\"Qarà-qurdum\\" (the said) Sultan, having converted the infidels to Islam by his sword, established the laws and religion of the Holy Muhammad, the Messenger of God, and gave them currency.\\" ==Death== Satuq Boghra Khan died in 955 according to Jamal Qarshi, and was buried in a mazar that can still be visited in Artux today. It was restored in 1995 by Uyghur architect Abuduryim Ashan. == Family == He had at least 4 sons and 3 daughters: * Musa Baytash Khan * Suleyman Khan * Hasan Bughra * Husayn Bughra * Nasab Tarkan * Hadya Tarkan * Ala Nur ==See also== * List of converts to Islam ==References== Category:955 deaths Category:Uyghurs Category:Converts to Islam Category:Turkic rulers Category:10th-century Turkic people Category:Year of birth unknown ","title":"Sultan Satuq Bughra Khan"},{"id":"1997785","text":"Kate Walsh O'Beirne (September 23, 1949 – April 23, 2017) was the President of National Review Institute.

Highest Alemannic (Hegschtalemannisch) is a branch of Alemannic German and is often considered to be part of the German language, even though mutual intelligibility with Standard German and other non-Alemannic German dialects is very limited. Highest Alemannic dialects are spoken in alpine regions of Switzerland: In the Bernese Oberland, in the German-speaking parts of the Canton of Fribourg, in the Valais (see Walliser German) and in the Walser settlements (mostly in Switzerland, but also in Italy and in Austria; see Walser German). In the West, the South and the South-East, they are surrounded by Romance languages; in the North, by High Alemannic dialects. In the Swiss canton of Graubünden (Grisons) only the Walser exclaves in the Romansh part and the Prättigau, Schanfigg and Davos are Highest Alemannic; the Rhine Valley with Chur and Engadin are High Alemannic. ==Features== The distinctive feature of the Highest Alemannic dialects is the lack of hiatus diphthongization, for instance 'to snow', 'to build' vs. High Alemannic , . Many High Alemannic dialects have different verbal plural endings for all three persons, for instance wir singe(n) 'we sing', ir singet 'you (plural) sing', si singent 'they sing'. Almost all other German dialects use the same ending for the first and third persons in the plural. There are High Alemannic dialects that have preserved the ending -n which has been dropped in most Upper German dialects. The Highest Alemannic dialects are considered to be the most conservative dialects of German. The dialect of the Lötschental, for instance, preserved the three distinct classes of weak verbs (as in Old High German) until the beginning of the 20th century. ==References External links == * innenüüsa (Haslital Swiss German poetry) Category:Swiss German language Category:German dialects Category:Articles with citation needed in ref field ","title":"Highest Alemannic German"},{"id":"1997798","text":"Acámbaro is a city and municipality in the southeastern corner of the Mexican state of Guanajuato, on the banks of the Lerma River, and the oldest of the 46 municipalities of Guanajuato. Acámbaro was originally a Purépecha settlement which was invaded by the Spanish, and their Otomi allies, in 1526. Acámbaro is noted as a major railway junction, a local transport hub, and the origin of the nationally famous Acámbaro bread. The current (2005 census) population of the municipality is 101,762 persons, that of the city proper 55,082. The municipality covers an area of 867.67 km² (335.01 sq mi) and includes many small outlying communities, the largest of which are Iramuco and Parácuaro. The municipality of Acámbaro is bordered to the north by Tarimoro and Jerécuaro, to the southeast by Tarandacuao, to the south by the state of Michoacán, and to the west by Salvatierra. == Climate History== Two Chupicuaro culture ceramic figurines, 500 - 0 B.C. The name Acámbaro is derived from a Native American term meaning place of magueyes. The first inhabitants of this area belonged to the Chupicuaro culture, one of the oldest in Mesoamerica. Their origin is estimated to be from 1200 B.C. In this region there have been valuable archaeological finds of ceramic that are now exhibited at the local museum. The city was founded on September 19, 1526, by the cacique Don Nicolás de San Luis Montañés, with the name San Francisco de Acámbaro. It was the first Spanish town in what is now the state of Guanajuato. The evangelization process was undertaken by Franciscan friars, who also constructed splendid structures that remain standing today, such as the Templo del Hospital (Hospital Temple), an aqueduct in the Mudéjar style (1527), and a stone bridge over the River Lerma (1750). The first bullfights on the soil of New Spain were held in Acámbaro, and the Fuente Taurina fountain in the city's plaza commemorates the introduction of the sport to Mexico. Acámbaro is the only city in Mexico that has a fully intact colonial- era aqueduct. The 18th century brought prosperity to Acámbaro. In that time important religious and public buildings were constructed. Several temples, bridges, and houses were left as remnants of the city's colonial architecture. http://www.interamericaninstitute.org/Acambaro_General_View.JPG An important event in the history of Mexican independence took place in Acámbaro. Don Miguel Hidalgo stayed there on October 22, 1810, and brought a ceremony that declared Acámbaro military quarters for the Ejército Grande de América (Grand Army of America). Hidalgo was given the title of Generalísimo de las Américas (Grand General of the Americas). That same day, a parade of eighty thousand insurgents took place, that demonstrated the speed of growth of the movement: one month prior on September 16 just 800 men responded to the Grito de Dolores and raised arms against the Spanish in Dolores Hidalgo. Because of its strategic location, Acámbaro was the key to the development of the railway in Mexico, and had a major junction, yard and shop facility for the National Railways of Mexico (The rail lines are now owned by Kansas City Southern de Mexico). Acámbaro was the home of the only full scale locomotive repair facility in Latin America that was capable of constructing steam locomotives. During 1944 Acámbaro's mechanical workshop built La Fidelita 296, a steam engine that is a symbol of a time in history of the Acambarense society. La Fidelita is now on display as the cornerstone exhibit of Acámbaro's railway museum. Another souvenir of Acámbaro's age of steam is a large model locomotive that sits on an elevated platform in the center of a major highway intersection east of the city. The model engine was originally intended to be placed in a church as a thanks by railway workers to the Virgen del Refugio (patron saint of the city) for bringing prosperity and jobs to Acámbaro, however, the model would not fit through the doorway of the church. Consequently, it was decided to mount the model outdoors.https://web.archive.org/web/20060209052433/http://www.acambaro.gob.mx/ Acámbaro has been notable as a point of controversy in the field of archeology as the source of the Acámbaro figures, a collection of about 32,000 clay figurines discovered by German archaeologist Waldemar Julsrud in 1944 near the city's most prominent landmark, the Cerro del Toro (Bull Hill). The figures are claimed to be hoaxes, as some of the figurines resembled dinosaurs (thus implying that man and dinosaurs co-existed) and their discovery is used by some as evidence to support creationism. Many of the Julsrud finds are now on display at the Museo Waldemar Julsrud. Less controversial archeological artifacts are on display at the Museo de Chupícuaro (also known as Museo Fray Bernardo Padilla), documenting the history of the Chupícuaro people, and the Museo Local de Acámbaro, which has over 4000 relics relating to local Mesoamerican cultures. The Museo Local also contains paintings related to colonial Mexico and the war of independence. Pan de Acámbaro (Acambaro bread), Acámbaro's most famous culinary export, is a bakery product similar to Jewish Challah (It is supposed that the similarity is not coincidental). The largest of the six city bakeries devoted to the production of Pan de Acámbaro is Tio Sams (Uncle Sam's), which claims credit for its invention.

He was helped early in his naval career by the patronage of his uncle, Sir Alan Gardner, who arranged for him to take part in the Vancouver Expedition. When the Pacific Coast was explored, he had served as a midshipman with Captain Vancouver in 1791. ==Career== Barrie served in European waters from 1801 to 1811. He was mentioned in dispatches for his gallant conduct in a fight with a French squadron when, as First Lieutenant of Bourdelais, \\"though dangerously wounded, he had disdained to quit the deck\\". Barrie then commanded a number of ships during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars. In 1804 he had been promoted Captain commanded Brilliant at 24-guns and in 1806 he went to Pomone at 38-guns. On 5 June 1807, he attacked a convoy of seventeen ships, sank three men-of-war, and captured fourteen other warships and store ships. He captured a privateer commanded by De Boissi, the Adjutant-General of France. In 1809, he captured a French warship and five transports. In 1811 he captured a Corsican fort and three French men-of-war.Broad Pennants On Point Frederick By Professor Richard A. Preston, Department of History. Royal Military College 1958 p 198-211 In 1811, he captured several important French prisoners, including Napoleon's brother Lucien Bonaparte on a French ship. He was particularly active during the War of 1812, carrying out several successful attacks on American towns and shipping in the Penobscot River region, and helping to destroy the Chesapeake Bay Flotilla. From 1813 to 1815 he served in the Dragon in American waters, and here again he made many captures. In 1813 Barrie collected runaway slaves from the Maryland and Virginia shores. After a brief period spent living in France Barrie took up the post of Acting Commissioner of the Quebec Dockyard 1817-1818. By 1819, he served as Commissioner of the dockyard at Kingston. He was active in a number of areas, building and expanding the dockyard and promoting important hydrographic surveys and the construction of canals. Between 1819 and 1820 Captain Barrie, as Flag Officer of the Great Lakes, built the Stone Frigate in Kingston Royal Navy Dockyard to house the gear of the warships of 1812 laid up in Navy Bay. His instructions were to expedite the repair of the vessels at the bases in case of any emergency. From December 1820, the command of Flag Officer of the Great Lakes disappeared from the Navy List. In March 1824 Barrie was listed as \\"Acting Resident Commissioner, Kingston, Upper Canada\\" and his headquarters was shown to have been transferred to Kingston. He cultivated friendships with several important political figures, and on his return to England in 1834 received a number of honours. ==Family and early life== Barrie was born at St. Augustine, Florida on 5 May 1774, the son of Scottish surgeon Dr Robert Barrie of Sanquhar and his wife, Dorothea (Dolly) Gardner, the sister of Sir Alan Gardner. His mother returned to England on the death of her husband in 1775, and settled in Preston, Lancashire. In 1784 she remarried George Clayton, a textile manufacturer, while her son was schooled at Neston, Cheshire, and later at Dedham. Between 1784 and 1788, he was carried on the books of HMS Europa as a servant to the captain (his uncle, Alan Gardner) but most likely his first shipboard service was as a junior midshipman on HMS Goliath. ==Vancouver expedition== Gardner arranged for Barrie to serve as a midshipman aboard from December 1790 until 1795, during George Vancouver's voyage of diplomacy and exploration along the Pacific coast of North America. Many of his letters home survive, describing his experiences of adventure, punctuated by periods of boredom after he exhausted the books on the ships. Barrie gained an acting promotion to Lieutenant on the expedition, and commanded a survey party on the northern coast of what is now British Columbia. He was formally promoted to Lieutenant upon the return to England in October 1795. In 1800 Barrie served in the West Indies under Thomas Manby, who had also taken part in the Vancouver expedition. On 23 October 1801 Barrie received a promotion to commander, and seven months later was advanced to post-captain while commanding the 16-gun sloop Calypso. ==Later commands== Barrie took command of the frigate in June 1806, serving initially off the French coast and then in the Mediterranean. He captured two significant Frenchmen during this period, the adjutant general of France, Chevalier Charles de Boissi, in June 1809, and Napoleon's brother Lucien Bonaparte, in October 1810, while Lucien was attempting to escape to America from Italy. On 1 May 1811 with two other ships, he entered the Gulf of Sagone, Corsica, sank three ships and destroyed its fortifications. He was then ordered to bring the British ambassador to Persia back to England, but Pomone was sunk while approaching Portsmouth. The subsequent court-martialled for the loss of the ship acquitted Barrie of misconduct but did censure the pilot. ==War of 1812== Barrie took command of the 74-gun third-rate in October 1812, and sailed to America during the War of 1812. He participated in the blockade of Chesapeake Bay. He served as the commodore of the squadron for several months, and captured over 85 vessels. His squadron blockaded the Patuxent River between June and August. In September 1814 he joined Sir John Coape Sherbrooke's forces for the attack on the Penobscot River region in the American state of Maine (then part of Massachusetts). Barrie commanded a joint expedition that defeated American militia in the Battle of Hampden, capturing and looting the towns of Hampden and Bangor and destroying the frigate . Barrie's rough treatment of the captured towns in central Maine earned the British lasting resentment in that region.William D. Williamson. History of the State of Maine (1832) Forces under Barrie went on to destroy the Chesapeake Bay Flotilla. In November 1813, ten of Whittington's slaves escaped to the British frigate Dragon under Commodore John Barrie.3 The ship had dropped anchor off St. George's Island near the Maryland shore of the Potomac River, but it was also visible from the Virginia shore. The ten slaves were George, age twenty-five; Jane, age thirty- three; Leviticus, age sixteen; Willouby, age thirteen; Levincy, age ten; John, age ten; Eliza, age seven; Louisa, age five; and Ezekiel and Isaiah, both six months old.4 A large number of Maryland slaves had already escaped from the farms of St. Mary's County residents, including Mathias Clarke, George Loker, and Dr. Hezekiah Dent (see Peter U. Thomson), all of whom lived near St. George's Island.3\\\\. Claim of Thomas Whittington, Case 818.

National Archives, College Park. ==Post-war== Barrie went onto half pay after the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815. He married Julia Wharton Ingilby on 24 October 1816 and went to live in France. He returned to service in January 1819, with the post of commissioner of the dockyard at Kingston, Upper Canada. The post made him senior naval officer in the Canadas, with control over the inland waterways and the port at Quebec. His instructions were to expedite the repair of the vessels at the bases in case of any emergency. He settled at Point Frederick, Kingston and among his achievements was the construction of a three-storey stone warehouse between 1819 and 1820. The building held the equipment of the ships reduced to the reserve under the Rush–Bagot Agreement of 1817. It was used briefly as a barracks, and then refitted to become part of the Royal Military College of Canada by 1876. It still survives, and is known as the HMCS Stone Frigate. From December 1820, the command of Flag Officer of the Great Lakes disappeared from the Navy List. In March 1824 Barrie was listed as \\"Acting Resident Commissioner, Kingston, Upper Canada\\" and his headquarters was shown to have been transferred to Kingston. Barrie exerted himself in a number of maritime-related matters, including the International Boundary Commission. He promoted a hydrographic survey of the Saint Lawrence River and the Great Lakes, the building of the Rideau and Welland canals, and relations with the United States. He became particular friends with a number of politicians, including Governors Lord Dalhousie and his successor Lord Aylmer, and Sir Peregrine Maitland and his wife Lady Sarah. During his later in Canada Barrie considered the possibility of a seat on the executive councils of the Canadas, but received an unpromising response from Sir George Cockburn. ==Later life== Barrie returned to England in 1825 and was consulted by the Admiralty on the naval establishments and defences of the Canadas. He was subsequently promoted to commodore first class and returned to Kingston in 1827. In August 1827, the Cockburn, was commissioned as the first of the Rush-Bagot treaty gun-boats. In 1831, he was ordered by the Admiralty to sell off the old warships of 1812 and to prepare to close down the dockyard fit. He remained there until June 1834, when the inland naval establishment was abolished. In 1834, he was ordered to strike his broad pennant and pay off the Cockburn. After the St. Lawrence was sold, for $9925, the other old warships remained as hulks in the Navy Bay or \\"in frame\\" on the stocks on Point Frederick. The naval stores were sold, or sent down to Quebec for carriage to England. Barrie, a popular figure in Kingston, left for England. He was appointed a Knight Commander of the Royal Guelphic Order and was knighted by King William IV. Barrie was promoted to rear-admiral in 1837, and in 1840 was further honoured by being created a Knight Commander of the Bath. Rear-Admiral Sir Robert Barrie died on 7 June 1841 at his seat in Swarthdale. ==Legacy== Barrie's time as commissioner in Canada was commemorated in a number of place-names, foremost of these being the city of Barrie, Ontario. Others include Barrie Creek in British Columbia, Barrie Point in British Columbia, Barrie Reach in British Columbia, the village of Barriefield in Ontario, and Barrie Island in Lake Huron. == References  External links == * Painting of Rear-Admiral Sir Robert Barrie at the RMC Museum * Letters of Rear-Admiral Sir Robert Barrie at William L.

After the band's breakup in 1988, he released his first solo album Intolerance before forming the alternative rock trio Nova Mob, where he moved to vocals and guitar. His solo career became his main focus after the dissolution of Nova Mob in 1997. As the co-songwriter of Hüsker Dü, Hart's songs (such as \\"The Girl Who Lives on Heaven Hill\\" and \\"Turn on the News\\") received praise from critics and contemporaries. His vocal style, in contrast to that of Hüsker Dü bandmate Bob Mould, had a more measured and melodic delivery. His choice of lyrical themes, which ranged from teenage alienation in \\"Standing by the Sea\\" and the depiction of a murder in \\"Diane,\\" to playful story-telling in \\"Books About UFOs,\\" helped to expand the subject matter of hardcore punk. Hart died on September 13, 2017, of complications from liver cancer and hepatitis C. ==BiographyYouth=== Grant Hart was born in South St. Paul, Minnesota, the youngest child of a credit union employee and a shop teacher. Hart described his family as a \\"typical American dysfunctional family [...] Not very abusive, though. Nothing really to complain about.\\"Azerrad, Michael. Our Band Could Be Your Life: Scenes from the American Indie Underground, 1981–1991. Little Brown and Company, 2001. , pg. 160 When Hart was 10, his older brother was killed by a drunk driver. Hart inherited his brother's drum set and records; he soon began playing in a number of makeshift bands as a teenager. Hart met Bob Mould while working at a record store. Mould, then a college freshman, would buy marijuana from Hart. At first Hart dismissed Mould as \\"an upstater pretending to be a Manhattanite,\\"but the two soon became friends.Azerrad, pg. 161 ===Hüsker Dü=== Hart formed Hüsker Dü in 1979 with Bob Mould and his friend Greg Norton. The band's early material had them lumped in with the hardcore movement of the early 1980s. The band members received help from their parents in their early days. In Hart's case, his mother let him use the copier machine at the credit union where she worked to make show flyers,Azerrad, pg. 163 and the band added $2,000 to an existing loan at the credit union to release the band's first single, \\"Statues,\\" on their own label Reflex Records in 1981.Azerrad, pg. 164 Success existed on a small scale for the band; by 1982 Hart was unemployed and relied on support from friends and family.Azerrad, pg. 167 Hüsker Dü's music became more accomplished and melodic over time. By late 1982, Hart's drumming \\"rushed the music along more precisely than ever\\" and he and Mould, who traded vocal duties, were singing more tunefully.Azerrad, pg. 171 While Mould was the band's primary songwriter, Hart began writing more songs. Hart wrote two songs for 1983's Metal Circus EP, the \\"perversely sing-along\\" \\"Diane\\" and the \\"impassioned speed-pop gem\\" \\"It's Not Funny Anymore.\\" Hüsker Dü's more melodic take on hardcore struck a chord with college students, and various tracks from Metal Circus, particularly Hart's \\"Diane,\\" were put into rotation by dozens of campus radio stations across the US.Azerrad, pg. 173 Hart was tagged by observers as the \\"hippie\\" of the group due to his long hair and his propensity to drum with bare feet; biographer Michael Azerrad additionally noted that \\"the wide-eyed sincerity of his songs was far more San Francisco '67 than New York City '77,\\" which contrasted with Mould's \\"incisively bitter\\" songs.Azerrad, pg. 176 As Hart and Mould developed as musicians and songwriters, an unspoken tension and competition arose in the band between them.Azerrad, pg. 177 Tensions were heightened when Mould demanded that starting with 1984's Zen Arcade that the band's records contain individual songwriter credits.Azerrad, pg. 181 In spite of the creative tensions, Hüsker Dü garnered critical acclaim with the release of Zen Arcade and subsequent albums. Michael Azerrad stated that by 1985's Flip Your Wig \\"the two songwriters were trying their level best to outdo each other, and with spectacular results\\"Azerrad, pg. 189 Hüsker Dü had left the hardcore genre behind, which caused some discomfort with their label at the time, SST Records. In one interview, Hart hinted that SST thought Hüsker Dü were \\"soft\\" because they stayed in motels while touring and occasionally wrote happy songs. Hart elaborated, \\"We don't have to convince the world that we're suffering to convince them that we're artists... There's nothing wrong with being happy.\\"Azerrad, pg. 187 Hart designed most of Hüsker Dü's album covers. In 1986, Hüsker Dü became one of the first key bands from the American indie scene to sign with a major label, inking a deal with Warner Bros. Records.Azerrad, pg. 190 However, tensions within the band worsened after signing with Warner Bros. Hart became addicted to heroin following the band's tour behind their major label debut Candy Apple Grey in 1986; he was also (incorrectly) diagnosed as HIV-positive in the middle of that year. Mould and Hart were feuding openly about Hart's drug use and creative conflicts, with Hart accusing Mould of ensuring he could not have more than 45 percent of the songs on each of the band's albums.Azerrad, pg. 192 The band dissolved after a show in Columbia, Missouri, in 1987. Hart was trying to quit heroin using a supply of methadone, but the bottle had leaked. Hart played the show, but Mould and Norton were concerned that Hart would soon be suffering from withdrawal and thus would be unable to play the next few shows. While Hart insisted he could perform, Mould had already canceled the dates. Hart quit the band four days later. Hart has said his drug use was not the reason for the band's demise; rather, it was the tensions between the band members. Hart said, \\"It just became that it was easier to be around Bob if you were playing a part of Bob's game,\\"and also said he felt Mould's songs had become increasingly \\"square.\\"Azerrad, pg. 194 Though it was often rumored during his Hüsker Dü days that he and bandmate Mould were in a relationship (Hart was openly bisexual, Mould is openly gay, and both acknowledge taking partners on tour), both have flatly denied ever having been romantically involved. ===Solo career and Nova Mob=== Six months after Hüsker Dü's breakup, Hart discovered that his diagnosis as being HIV-positive was incorrect.Azerrad, pg. 195 In 1988 he released the solo EP, 2541, on Hüsker Dü's former label SST. The title is taken from the address of his former band's office and rehearsal house, where the members had at one time lived. Marshall Crenshaw would later cover the title song, as would the Go-Betweens' Robert Forster. After the release of the EP, Hart went further into sobriety, recording and releasing the album Intolerance and the associated EP All of My Senses in 1989 and 1990, respectively. In late 1989, he formed a new band, Nova Mob, with Michael Crego on drums, Tom Merkl on bass, and Hart himself taking guitar duties. The band took their name from the novel Nova Express by William Burroughs; it had previously been used by an unrecorded group featuring the young Julian Cope and Pete Wylie. The band released their first EP Admiral of the Sea and album The Last Days of Pompeii in 1991. The lineup later changed with Marc Retish and then Steve Sutherland on drums, and Chris Hesler on lead guitar. The band routinely toured Europe to warm reception. Nova Mob released their second album Nova Mob in 1994, and disbanded after a supporting tour. ===Later years=== Grant Hart's star on the outside mural of the Minneapolis nightclub First Avenue Hart returned to recording as a solo artist with the release of the live album Ecce Homo in 1995, and later released Good News for Modern Man in late 1999. On 21 October 2004, he and Mould reunited at the benefit concert for Karl Mueller (bassist for fellow Minneapolis stalwarts Soul Asylum), who was then fighting what would turn out to be a losing battle with cancer. Hart recorded his next solo album (and first in a decade), Hot Wax, in Montreal and Minneapolis. Hart told Britain's Q in September 2006, \\"I'm working on some stuff with the Godspeed You! Black Emperor people. They've given more of themselves in a few weeks than Bob did in nine years with Hüsker Dü.\\"Q, October 2006 In 2008, Hart was one of the guest singers on Lotuk, the third album of Arsenal, a Belgian band combining roots and dance music. In the summer of 2008, Hart debuted a new track, \\"Schoolbuses Are For Children,\\" on his Myspace site. He released Hot Wax on October 6, 2009. Intolerance was reissued on February 9, 2010, on 180-gram vinyl, and The Last Days of Pompeii was reissued with extra tracks and new mastering on December 7, 2010. In December 2012, Hart embarked on a short tour of Ireland with a new lineup, Colm O' Herlihy on guitar, Dan Walsh on drums and Simon Dargan on bass In a Facebook Q&A;, Hart commented: \\"I love playing with these guys. They let me make music rather than getting bogged down administrating a band's business. They make it a joy with their self-starting ways\\" He confirmed this lineup for his upcoming European and USA dates. Most recently, Hart released the double album The Argument (based on John Milton's Paradise Lost) in the summer of 2013. In October 2013, documentary filmmaker Gorman Bechard released Every Everything: The Music, Life & Times of Grant Hart, a film about Hart which chronicles the musician's life from birth to the recording of The Argument. Told in the style of the Errol Morris film The Fog of War, Hart is the only interview subject in the film. Hart has been honored with two stars on the outside mural of the Minneapolis nightclub First Avenue, one for his solo work and one for Hüsker Dü. The stars recognize performers that have played sold- out shows or have otherwise demonstrated a major contribution to the culture at the iconic venue. Receiving a star \\"might be the most prestigious public honor an artist can receive in Minneapolis,\\" according to journalist Steve Marsh. In tribute to Grant Hart and his work with Hüsker Dü, The Posies recorded a song entitled \\"Grant Hart\\" which was released on their 1996 album Amazing Disgrace. ===Marriage=== Grant Hart married Brigid McGough Hart on July 5, 2017, at Church of the Assumption in St. Paul, Minnesota. ===Death=== Hart died on September 13, 2017, at 9:02 p.m., at Fairview University of Minnesota Hospital, of complications from liver cancer and hepatitis C.Cause of death in: He was 56 years old. He is survived by his wife Brigid McGough Hart and son Karl Turbenson. ==Discography== ;Studio albums * Intolerance (1989, SST) * Good News for Modern Man (1999, Pachyderm) * Hot Wax (2009, Con d'Or) * The Argument (2013, Domino) ;Live albums * Ecce Homo (1995, World Service) ;Compilation albums * Oeuvrevue (2010, Hazelwood) ; EPs * 2541 (1988, SST) * All of My Senses (1990, SST) ; Singles * \\"Nobody Rides For Free\\" (2000, Pachyderm) * \\"You're The Reflection\\" (2010, Amphetamine Reptile) * \\"So Far From Heaven\\" (2011, Con D'Or) * \\"Is The Sky The Limit?\\" (2013, Domino) ;Nova Mob albums * The Last Days of Pompeii (1991, Rough Trade) * Nova Mob (1994, Restless, World Service) ;Nova Mob EPs * Admiral of the Sea (1991, Rough Trade) * Shoot (1992, Big Store) ;Nova Mob singles * \\"Evergreen Memorial Drive\\" (1992, Blackbox Records) * \\"Shoot Your Way to Freedom\\" (1992, Big Store, Tontine Records) * \\"Old Empire\\" (1994, World Service) ==ReferencesExternal links== * *[ Allmusic: Grant Hart] Category:1961 births Category:2017 deaths Category:Songwriters from Minnesota Category:American punk rock drummers Category:Alternative rock drummers Category:Alternative rock guitarists Category:Alternative rock pianists Category:American male drummers Category:American drummers Category:Hüsker Dü members Category:Hardcore punk musicians Category:SST Records artists Category:Singers from Minnesota Category:LGBT musicians from the United States Category:LGBT people from Minnesota Category:LGBT singers from the United States Category:LGBT songwriters Category:People from South St. Paul, Minnesota Category:Bisexual men Category:Bisexual musicians Category:Deaths from liver cancer Category:Guitarists from Minnesota Category:American male guitarists Category:20th-century American guitarists Category:Male pianists Category:20th-century American male musicians Category:Restless Records artists ","title":"Grant Hart"},{"id":"1997847","text":"Ehmetjan Qasim (; April 15, 1914 – August 27, 1949) was the leader of the Second East Turkestan Republic.

Qasimi was a leader of the pro-Soviet East Turkistan Turkic People's National Liberation Committee (ETTPNLC). In June 1946, Qasimi tried to reach a political agreement with the Nationalist Chinese leader Zhang Zhizhong to form a coalition provincial government in Dihua (present day Urumqi).Benson 1990:63, 70 The Second ETR was to be disbanded in name but the three districts retained autonomy. As a leader of the three districts, Qasimi called for unity and support for his government and rejected the coalition provincial government.Benson 1990:84, 101 He explained that the people of East Turkistan had risen in rebellion only to secure their rights under the Chinese constitution.Benson 1990:86 He led a delegation to the Chinese National Assembly Nanjing to negotiate bi-lateral relations between ETR and the Republic of China. In the summer of 1949, as Chinese Nationalists were losing the civil war to the Chinese Communists, the Soviet Union planned for ETR leaders to switch sides. On August 22, 1949, Vasiliy Borisov, the Soviet Vice-Consul at Yining, accompanied ETR leadership in auto trip to USSR for urgent talks with Soviet officials about future of ETR, where they were told to cooperate with Communist Party of China. They were invited by Chinese Communist leader, Mao Zedong to attend the First Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in Beijing to prepare for the founding of the People's Republic of China. On August 24, 1949 Ehmetjan, Abdulkerim Abbas, Ishaq Beg Munonov, Dalelkhan Sugirbayev, Luo Zhi and other top ETR representatives (11 men in all) boarded a plane in Almaty, the capital of the Kazakh SSR, for Beijing. On September 3, the Soviet Union informed Saifuddin Azizi, another leader of the ETR, who was not on the flight that the plane had crashed near Lake Baikal en route to Beijing, killing all on board.Donald H. McMillen, Chinese Communist Power and Policy in Xinjiang, 1949–1977 (Boulder, Colorado: Westview Press, 1979), p. 30. The plane Ehmetjan was killed in. Saifuddin later secured the role of regional Chairman of Xinjiang, a job he kept from 1955 to 1978, with a brief respite during the Cultural Revolution. News of plane crash and death of Ehmetjan was not publicly announced in Xinjiang until early December, after the People's Liberation Army had secured the region. The ETR was officially dissolved on December 20, 1949. ==Family== Ehmetjan Qasimi was married in January 1945 to Mahinur Qasim (Maynor Kasim; 玛依努尔•哈斯木), a native of Korgas County in Ili.(Chinese) 回忆阿合买提江（上下） The couple had a son and a daughter.

In later life, Sunlight enjoyed to \\"dine out\\" on tales of his family's adventures and brushes with the Tsarist authorities but it is suspected that these were largely fanciful. The family emigrated to England in 1890 to avoid conscription and settled in Manchester, probably choosing their new name from Port Sunlight. Sunlight was apprenticed to an architect in Manchester in 1904 and by 1907 had his own practice in St Ann's Square. Reputedly, by 1910, he had designed and built more than 1000 houses in Prestwich and claimed that by 1921 he had created more than one million pounds' worth of property. He also designed and built factories and warehouses, but his greatest memorial is Sunlight House (1932). In 1949, he proposed a 40-storey extension, but it was rejected by the city council. His sole religious building was the technically innovative South Manchester Synagogue (1913). Sunlight was elected Liberal Member of Parliament for Shrewsbury in the 1923 general election and introduced a Private Member's Bill on the standardisation of bricks. Though the bill survived by a single vote, it was lost when Sunlight was defeated in the 1924 United Kingdom general election. Sunlight, though always professing his affection for the faith of his parents, seems to have been more interested in his favourite pastime of horse racing. ==Family== He married Edith Forshaw in 1940, and they had one son, artist Ben Sunlight. ==Bibliography== *Kadish, S. \\"Sunlight, Joseph (1889-1978)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 (subscription required) *Obituary, Manchester Evening News, 18 April 1978 == External links == * Category:1889 births Category:1978 deaths Category:Belarusian emigrants to the United Kingdom Category:Architects from Manchester Category:Art Deco architects Category:Liberal Party (UK) MPs for English constituencies Category:UK MPs 1923–1924 Category:Belarusian Jews Category:Jewish British politicians ","title":"Joseph Sunlight"},{"id":"1997858","text":"High Alemannic is a dialect of Alemannic German spoken in the westernmost Austrian state of Vorarlberg, on the border with Switzerland and Liechtenstein. ==Language area== The High Alemannic dialects are spoken in Liechtenstein and in most of German-speaking Switzerland (Swiss Plateau), except for the Highest Alemannic dialects in the Swiss Alps and for the Low Alemannic (Basel German) dialect in the North West.

He became Britain's most popular composer of Edwardian musical comedy in the early years of the 20th century. ==Life and careerEarly life=== Monckton was born in London, the eldest son of the Town Clerk of London, Sir John Braddick Monckton, and Lady Monckton, the former Maria Louisa Long (1837–1920), an \\"enthusiastic amateur actress\\".Gänzl, Kurt. \\"Monckton, (John) Lionel Alexander (1861–1924)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press (2004), accessed 16 April 2008\\"Monckton, Lady (Maria Louisa)\\", Who's Who (1907), Vol. 59, p. 1240, A. & C. Black His sister was Mrs Augusta Moore, who wrote popular novels as Martin J. Pritchard. 1st anniversary souvenir He was educated at Charterhouse School and Oriel College at Oxford University, graduating in 1885. There he acted in college theatrical productions and composed music for productions of the Oxford University Dramatic Society, of which he was a founder, and the Phil-Thespian Club.The Times obituary, 16 February 1924, p. 15 He initially joined the legal profession at Lincoln's Inn and began to practise law, but gained part-time work as a songwriter and a theatre and music critic, first for the Pall Mall Gazette and later for the Daily Telegraph. His first theatre work was Mummies and Marriage, an operetta produced by amateurs in 1888. At the age of 29, in 1891, he finally managed to place the song \\"What will you have to Drink?\\", with lyrics by Basil Hood, in a professional musical burlesque called Cinder Ellen up too Late. After this, his songs were included in several other London shows. ===Contributor to musicals=== Monckton soon became a regular composer (and sometimes lyricist) of songs for the very successful series of frothy musical comedies performed at London's Gaiety Theatre, under the management of George Edwardes, which premiered throughout the 1890s and into the first decade of the 20th Century. Among others, he wrote half of the music for Arthur Roberts's burlesque Claude Du-Val (1894) and supplemented Ivan Caryll's score for the hit musical The Shop Girl in the same year, with such successful pieces as George Grossmith, Jr.'s \\"Beautiful Bountiful Bertie\\" and \\"Brown of Colorado\\" (with Adrian Ross). He then added popular tunes to Caryll's scores for The Circus Girl in 1896 (\\"A Simple Little String\\" and \\"The Way to Treat a Lady\\") and A Runaway Girl in 1898 (\\"Soldiers in the Park\\", \\"Society\\", \\"The Sly Cigarette\\", \\"The Boy Guessed Right\\" and \\"Not the Sort of Girl I Care About\\").\\"Lionel Monckton\\", British Musical Theatre, The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, 31 August 2004, retrieved 5 June 2014 Millar The \\"Girl\\" musicals were followed by a number of \\"Boy\\" musicals, again with hit songs by Monckton, including The Messenger Boy in 1900 (\\"Maisie\\", \\"In the Wash\\", and \\"When the Boys Come Home Once More\\") and The Toreador in 1901 (\\"Captivating Cora\\", \\"I'm Romantic\\", \\"When I Marry Amelia\\", \\"Keep Off the Grass\\", and \\"Archie\\"). Monckton's songs continued to be performed long after the shows closed – some of them remaining popular into the 1960s. In 1902, he married Gertie Millar, one of the most successful actresses of the period, whom he had discovered and brought to Edwardes. She starred in many of Monckton's shows, and he wrote some of his most popular songs for her, although their marriage was not a happy one for many years. She later sought a divorce from Monckton, which he refused.Gillan, Don. \\"Gertie Millar (1879–1952)\\", Stage Beauty, accessed 9 August 2020 At the same time, Monckton also contributed songs for the musicals playing at Edwardes's Daly's Theatre, which tended more towards romantic comedies, than the light musicals presented at the Gaiety. For Daly's Theatre, he usually collaborated with Sidney Jones, supplying numbers for hits such as The Geisha in 1896 (\\"Jack's the Boy\\" and \\"The Toy Monkey\\"); A Greek Slave in 1898 (\\"I Want to Be Popular\\", \\"I Should Rather Like to Try\\", and \\"What Will Be the End of It?\\"); and San Toy in 1899 (\\"Rhoda and Her Pagoda\\", and \\"Sons of the Motherland\\"). Monckton's music was generally arranged and orchestrated by theatre conductor Carl Kiefert. ===Peak years=== Dare in The Arcadians Finally, in 1902, when Jones left Daly's, Edwardes gave Monckton the opportunity to compose his first complete score, A Country Girl, with a few numbers by Paul Rubens (Monckton's key songs were \\"Molly the Marchioness\\", \\"Try Again, Johnny\\", and \\"Under the Deodar\\"). He also continued to contribute successful songs to other musicals, including The Orchid in 1903 at the Gaiety (\\"Liza Ann\\", \\"Little Mary\\", \\"Pushful\\", and \\"Fancy Dress\\"). The success of A Country Girl led to another musical with Monckton as principal composer and Rubens as contributor, The Cingalee in 1904. Monckton's most successful songs in this score included \\"The Island of Gay Ceylon\\" and \\"Pearl of Sweet Ceylon\\". Although the piece was successful, French operettas then became the fashion at Daly's Theatre, and Monckton went back to composing music for others' shows. Further collaborations with Caryll at the Gaiety included The Spring Chicken in 1905 (\\"I Don't Know, But I Guess\\", \\"Alice Sat By the Fire\\", and \\"Under and Over Forty\\"), The New Aladdin, in 1906 and The Girls of Gottenberg in 1907 (\\"Two Little Sausages\\", \\"Rheingold\\", and \\"Berlin on the Spree\\"). These songs were among the most widely played and sung numbers of the contemporary light musical theatre. A last success at the Gaiety was Monckton and Caryll's Our Miss Gibbs in 1909 (\\"Moonstruck\\", \\"Mary\\", \\"In Yorkshire\\", \\"Soldiers in the Park\\", \\"Maisie\\", \\"Keep off the Grass\\" and \\"Our Farm\\"), which became an international hit. After that, Monckton had his greatest success, in collaboration with Howard Talbot and the lyricist Arthur Wimperis, with The Arcadians, in 1909. The Arcadians, produced by Robert Courtneidge, was possibly Monckton's best score and is considered the classic musical of the Edwardian period.Charlton, Fraser. \\"What are EdMusComs?\\", FraserWeb, accessed 9 August 2020 Like The Geisha, A Country Girl and Our Miss Gibbs, it became popular in America and elsewhere and included songs such as \\"The Pipes of Pan\\", \\"The Girl with the Brogue\\", and \\"All Down Piccadilly\\", which \\"held their own with the melodies of the now fashionable Viennese operetta as the song hits of the period.\\" The Boy Edwardes purchased the lease of the Adelphi Theatre and began his productions there with another Monckton and Millar hit, The Quaker Girl, in 1910 (\\"The Quaker Girl\\", \\"Come to the Ball\\", and \\"Tony from America\\"). For Courtneidge, he wrote The Mousmé in 1911 (\\"I Know Nothing of Life\\", \\"The Little Japanese Mamma\\", \\"The Temple Bell\\", and \\"The Corner of My Eye\\") and for Edwardes and the Adelphi, he wrote The Dancing Mistress in 1912. The latter two pieces had merely respectable runs. Monckton's last big hit was The Boy in 1917 (produced after Edwardes's death), in collaboration with Howard Talbot. This was a musical comedy version of Arthur Wing Pinero's 1885 play, The Magistrate, and served as a vehicle for the comedian W. H. Berry, who had been the star of High Jinks. Monckton's successful songs included \\"I Want to Go to Bye-Bye\\", \\"The Game That Ends with a Kiss\\", and \\"Powder on Your Nose\\". ===After World War I=== Monckton was discouraged by Edwardes's death and unwilling to adapt his style of writing to the newly popular syncopated American dance rhythms, ragtime, and other \\"noisy numbers\\" that were heard in theatres. Although he contributed to some revues, including Bric à Brac (1915, including another song for Millar: \\"Chalk Farm to Camberwell Green\\"), We're All in it, and Airs and Graces, he had little enthusiasm for this, or for other new forms of musical entertainment, and he soon retired from composing.

Also known as the natives law, pass laws severely limited the movements of not only black African citizens, but other people as well by requiring them to carry pass books when outside their homelands or designated areas. Before the 1950s, this legislation largely applied to African men, and attempts to apply it to women in the 1910s and 1950s were met with significant protests. Pass laws were one of the dominant features of the country's apartheid system, until it was effectively ended in 1986. ==Early history== The first internal passports in South Africa were introduced on 27 June 1797 by the Earl McCartney in an attempt to prevent natives from entering the Cape Colony. The Cape Colony was merged with other states in the region to form the Union of South Africa in 1910, under the UK. By this time, versions of pass laws existed elsewhere. A major boost for their utilization was the rise of the mining sector from the 1880s: pass laws provided a convenient means of controlling workers' mobility and enforcing contracts. In 1896 the South African Republic brought in two pass laws which required Africans to carry a metal badge. Only those employed by a master were permitted to remain on the Rand. Those entering a \\"labour district\\" needed a special pass which entitled them to remain for three days. ==Summary== Pass laws date “back to 1760 in the Cape when slaves moving between urban and rural areas were required to carry passes authorizing their travel”. The pass laws, “had entitled police at any time to demand that Africans show them a properly endorsed document or face arrest”, hindering their freedom of movement. This meant that it restricted where they could live, which in turn then “tied them to their white employers, underpinning a system of cheap labor and humiliating subjection”. Their implementation over time arose from two contradictory needs. Pass Laws have been due to two specific white needs. The white population in South Africa utilized these laws as “an ‘exclusionary’ need to obtain political security by controlling and policing the number of Africans in “white” areas, and an “inclusionary’ need to ensure a supply of cheap labor within these areas”. The legislation and practices associated with the pass Laws have changed over time. As these demands and beliefs changed, so did the rights of the black population in South Africa. When the pass laws were implemented at the turn of the century, they “encouraged the flow of labor into ‘white’ agriculture and industry and to redistribute labor into geographical areas where it was needed”. This process would last until the 1950s, when the government opted to change the paradigm. This meant, “from 1950 onward the emphasis of the pass laws has been overtly exclusionary and directed to ‘relocating’ Africans from ‘white’ areas and containing them within the Bantustans”. Therefore, there has always been a tension between the white and black community in South Africa. This stemmed from the “efforts to use the pass system to balance white needs for security and labor”, while also creating laws that would allow for the control of the “African employment, housing, access to land, and citizenship”. Due to these laws, “over 17,745,000 Africans have been arrested or prosecuted” between 1916 and 1984. The policing of Africans has allowed for the whites to maintain dominance over the black population for the greater part of the 20th century. Not only did the focus on how to control change over time, but also whom to control. Initially and “historically the use of passes in South Africa as a form of labour control applied only to men”. This happened because “whenever attempts were made to extend the system to black women, mass protests quickly resulted”. There vociferous opposition to the pass laws are of no surprise, considering the “fact that black women in South Africa have traditionally taken a more active role in mass popular protest”, in comparison to men. The biggest manifestation was a phenomenon that occurred “during the 1950s when black women throughout the nation fiercely resisted official efforts to make them carry passes for the first time”. The history of the application of pass laws towards women was intertwined with the belief that it would benefit the black female population. The “municipal authorities argued that passes for women were necessary to combat illegal brewing and prostitution”. They hypothesized that if a woman could prove that they made an honest living with legal employment then they would not be allowed to resort to illegal activities since they would be evicted. This proved to be a futile system since it was easier for the women in illegal practices to get around the laws than the home-based workers. Regardless of the reasons and the people that these laws affected, they could never be truly justified, and could only be seen as a scheme to control the black population in South Africa. As the years passed by, pass laws would be used less and less to prosecute people. There was a “decline in pass law prosecutions over the period 1968-1981”, which is not surprising considering “the new forms of tight influx controls”. There had been a radical change when the Riekert Commission recommended “that ‘unlawful occupation of accommodation by persons’, together with ‘unlawful employment’, be grounds for ‘repatriation’ of persons from the white area”, which meant that they changed their enforcement to “being taken off the streets and into housing and factories”. Pass laws were repealed in 1986. ==Later legislation== The Natives (Urban Areas) Act of 1923 deemed urban areas in South Africa as \\"white\\" and required all black African men in cities and towns to carry around permits called \\"passes\\" at all times. Anyone found without a pass would be arrested immediately and sent to a rural area. It was replaced in 1945 by the Natives (Urban Areas) Consolidation Act, which imposed \\"influx control\\" on black men and also set up guidelines for removing people deemed to be living idle lives from urban areas. This act outlined requirements for African peoples' \\"qualification\\" to reside legally in white metropolitan areas. To do so, they had to have Section 10 rights, based on whether * the person had been born there and resided there always since birth; * the person had laboured continuously for ten years in any agreed area for any employer, or lived continuously in any such area for fifteen years; Demonstrators discarding their passbooks to protest apartheid, 1960 The Black (Natives) Laws Amendment Act of 1952 amended the 1945 Native Urban Areas Consolidation Act, stipulating that all black people over the age of 16 were required to carry passes, and that no black person could stay in an urban area more than 72 hours unless allowed to by Section 10. The Natives (Abolition of Passes and Co-ordination of Documents) Act of 1952, commonly known as the Pass Laws Act, repealed the many regional pass laws and instituted one nationwide pass law, which made it compulsory for all black South Africans over the age of 16 to carry the \\"passbook\\" at all times within white areas. The law stipulated where, when, and for how long a person could remain. The document was similar to an internal passport, containing details on the bearer such as their fingerprints, photograph, the name of his/her employer, his/her address, how long the bearer had been employed, as well as other identification information. Employers often entered a behavioural evaluation, on the conduct of the pass holder. An employer was defined under the law and could only be a white person. The pass also documented permission requested and denied or granted to be in a certain region and the reason for seeking such permission. Under the terms of the law, any government employee could strike out such entries, basically cancelling the permission to remain in the area. A passbook without a valid entry then allowed officials to arrest and imprison the bearer of the pass. These passes often became the most despised symbols of apartheid. The resistance to the Pass Law led to many thousands of arrests and was the spark that ignited the Sharpeville Massacre on March 21, 1960, and led to the arrest of Robert Sobukwe that day. Colloquially, passes were often called the dompas, literally meaning the \\"dumb pass\\" or domestic passport. Apart from discrimination against black people, there was also discrimination against the so-called \\"coloured people.\\" The \\"coloured\\" included all Indians, Chinese and Arabs, as well as those of \\"mixed\\" black/white ethnicity. Indian people, for example, were barred from the Orange Free State. ==Resistance by syndicalists and nationalists== These discriminatory regulations fueled growing discontent from the black population. The 1910s saw significant opposition to pass laws being applied to black women. In 1919, the revolutionary syndicalist International Socialist League (South Africa), in conjunction with the syndicalist Industrial Workers of Africa and the early African National Congress, organised a major anti-pass campaign. The 1950s saw the ANC begin the Defiance Campaign to oppose the pass laws. This conflict climaxed at the Sharpeville Massacre, where the anti-pass protestors led by the rival breakaway Pan Africanist Congress of Azania (PAC) surrounded the Sharpeville police station, prompting the police to open fire, killing 69 people and injuring over 180. Subsequent protests and strikes were met with major repression and the ANC and PAC were both banned. ==Repeal in 1986== On July 23, 1986, as part of a process of removing some apartheid laws, the South African government lifted the requirement to carry passbooks, although the pass law system itself was not yet repealed. The system of pass laws was formally repealed retroactive on April 23, 1986, with the Abolition of Influx Control Act. Helen Suzman (MP) mentioned the act as the most eminent reform of a government had ever introduced. ==See also== * Bantustan * Racial segregation * Ghetto * Hukou system * Identity document * Jim Crow laws * Judenhut * Second-class citizen * Yellow badge * Passing (racial identity) * Pass system (Canadian history) ==References== Notes Bibliography * ==External links== *Apartheid Pass Laws and the Anti-pass campaigns Category:Identity documents Category:Apartheid laws in South Africa ","title":"Pass laws"},{"id":"1997871","text":"Matt Goias (born October 12, 1977) is a New York City-based entrepreneur, music producer and writer. ==Early years== Matt Goias was born in Edison, New Jersey and spent his childhood and teenage years living in New Jersey and New York. He began collecting records and djing at the age of 11, and spun in a Manhattan nightclub for the first time at age 14. As a teenager he went on to co-found the weekly hip-hop party Indie 5000 (along with DJ Max Glazer, artist Stephen “ESPO” Powers, and Ari Forman of On The Go Magazine). With Goias at the helm, Indie 5000 hosted weekly, celebrity, guest DJs including Cipha Sounds, Peanut Butter Wolf, PF Cuttin, Lord Finesse, DJ Premier, Kid Capri, DJ Soul, Lord Sear, and Prince Paul. At 22 years old, Goias was profiled by Vogue Magazine and named the “Jack of Clubs” for his work on the cultural scene. ==Marketing career== Goias is currently a partner of The Class Trip Corporation, a marketing entity based in New York City. ==Musical production== In 2003, Goias founded the hit musical group FannyPack. The band's hit single Cameltoe described the female apparel phenomenon and was number one on Carson Daly’s Total Request Live radio show for five consecutive weeks. Signed to Tommy Boy Records, the group released two critically praised albums. The first was 2003’s So Stylistic, which was followed in 2005 by See You Next Tuesday. By 2005, the band had performed in 15 countries and received hundreds of articles in publications around the globe. Goias reunited with Fannypack alum DJ Fancy as well as DJ Max Glazer to form 'Business Class', a music development entity. ==Other concepts== Recently, Goias and artist Steve Powers collaborated on an art show in Paris’ Colette boutique entitle L’Attraction de la Boue to commemorate World Aids Day 2009. ===The Bench=== Goias, along with Max Glazer, Ari Saal Forman, and Fancy, garnered media attention with the creation of \\"The Bench\\" on the corner of Houston and Orchard Streets in New York City. The conceptual piece was an exercise in \\"creating something out of nothing meant to raise questions about what exactly it is that makes an event or place \\"cool\\" or \\"relevant.\\" The goal was to prove that with the right combination of attendees, artwork, location, and viral propaganda, the artists involved would be able to make nothing at all, four friends sitting on a bench, the \\"coolest\\" party in New York City. The “event” was covered extensively by Gawker, Time Out New York, Gothamist, AdBusters, and The New York Observer. Goias and The Bench were featured on the cover of the Arts and Culture section of The New York Observer on August 7, 2007. ==Published work== As a writer, Goias has written a monthly column called \\"Sexytime Explosion\\" in Mass Appeal Magazine and one called \\"The Gospel According to Matthew\\" in Missbehave Magazine.

He spent first ten years of his life in Virginia, United States, and then he was sent to his uncle, General Donald Graham, to finish school and prepare for West Point. Instead of West Point, McIver joined the private army of the East India Company when he was only 16 years old. ==Career== He was sent to India in 1858. At that time, the Sepoy Mutiny (Sepoy - native soldiers in the East Indian Company army) raged in India. In his first battle, McIver was seriously wounded. In 1860, McIver fought under Giuseppe Garibaldi in Italy, and after that joined the pretender for the Spanish crown, Don Carlos. When the American Civil War broke out, Henry McIver joined the Confederate side. Although he was only 20 years old at the time he was already an experienced soldier. While fighting for the Confederates, he was under the command of three famous Confederate generals: Jackson, Stewart and Smith. At the end of the war, he challenged a Union officer, Major Tomlin, to a duel, which he won, running Tomlin through the body. When the Confederacy capitulated, McIver fled to Mexico, where he joined Emperor Maximilian in fighting Juárez’s rebels. In Mexico he was captured by Indians, and escaped three months later by swimming across the Rio Grande. He fought at Monterrey, and for his deeds received the title of count. When the Juárez rebellion was successful, Maximilian was executed, and McIver fled to Tampico, where he boarded a ship and left for South America. In the War of 1877-1878, McIver offered his services to the Serbians, initially being commissioned a colonel of volunteers and later rising to the rank of general and overall cavalry commander of the Serbian contingents. In 1883, McIver organized a company for British colonization of New Guinea; the project had to be abandoned in 1884 after failing to gain the approval of the Earl of Derby. ==Death== McIver died in 1907. ==References== * General of Serbian cavalry Henry MacIver, Генерал српске коњице Хенри Мекајвер - Serbum magazine *er *Under Fourteen Flags McIver's Biography by Capt.

That is, the accused must be substantially certain that his action would result in the contact.

He played college football at Notre Dame. Carney was also a member of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, San Diego Chargers, New Orleans Saints, Los Angeles Rams, Jacksonville Jaguars, Kansas City Chiefs, and New York Giants. He was a Pro Bowl selection with the Chargers in 1994 and with the Giants in 2008. When he was released from the Saints' active roster in December 2009, Carney was third on the NFL career scoring list with a career total of 2,044 points. He was the last remaining player from the 1980s still active in professional football. He has also worked as a kicking consultant for the Saints. ==Early years== Carney attended Cardinal Newman High School in West Palm Beach, Florida, and lettered in football. In football, he won All- State honors as a punter. ==College years== Carney attended Notre Dame and played football there from 1984 to 1986. He was named to the Notre Dame's all time team by Sports Illustrated. ==Professional careerCincinnati Bengals=== After going undrafted in the 1987 NFL Draft, Carney was signed by the Cincinnati Bengals as an undrafted free agent. He was released prior to the regular season and spent the year out of football. ===Tampa Bay Buccaneers=== Carney played five games for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers between 1988 and 1989. He converted two of five field goal attempts and all six extra point attempts. ===First stint with Chargers=== Carney attended training camp with the San Diego Chargers in 1990, but did not make the final roster. ===Los Angeles Rams=== Carney played one game for the Los Angeles Rams in 1990, but did not attempt a field goal or extra point. He was the last remaining active Los Angeles Ram, until the team moved back to Los Angeles from St. Louis in 2016. ===Second stint with Chargers=== Carney was re-signed by the Chargers during the 1990 season, appearing in 12 games for the team and converting 19 of 21 field goal attempts. He played 11 seasons with the Chargers through the 2000 season, earning his first Pro Bowl selection in 1994 after going 34-for-38 (89.5 percent) on field goal attempts as the Chargers made it to the Super Bowl. To this day, he remains the Chargers' all-time leading scorer. ===New Orleans Saints=== Carney signed with the New Orleans Saints as a free agent prior to the 2001 season. On December 21, 2003, the Saints were trailing the Jaguars 20-13 with 7 seconds left in regulation. Quarterback Aaron Brooks threw the ball in a hurry to Donte Stallworth. As time expired, the Saints continued to lateral the ball around until eventually wide receiver Jerome Pathon scored a touchdown in what became known as the River City Relay. Carney was sent out to kick the extra point to tie the game up and force overtime. Instead, Carney pushed the ball wide right and the Saints lost 19-20. Carney kicked a game-winning field goal against the Carolina Panthers following Hurricane Katrina. He then appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated with quarterback Aaron Brooks on September 19, 2005 as the city celebrated this victory. On April 5, 2007, Carney asked and was given permission to leave the Saints after their acquisition of kicker Olindo Mare. ===Jacksonville Jaguars=== Following Week 1 of the 2007 NFL Season, Carney signed with the Jacksonville Jaguars replacing injured placekicker Josh Scobee. Carney appeared in eight games for the Jaguars in Scobee's absence, converting nine of 11 field goal attempts and 20 of 21 extra point attempts. He was released on November 19 upon Scobee's return. ===Kansas City Chiefs=== On November 26, 2007, the Kansas City Star reported that the Kansas City Chiefs would sign Carney after holding tryouts to replace Dave Rayner – making Carney the fourth placekicker to play for the Chiefs within a one-year period, following Lawrence Tynes, Justin Medlock and Rayner. Carney appeared in five games for the Chiefs, going 3-for-3 on field goal attempts and 7-for-7 on extra point attempts. ===New York Giants=== Carney with Jeff Feagles in 2008; in their 40s both were kickers for the New York Giants. On August 30, 2008, Carney signed with the New York Giants to fill in while Tynes recovered from a knee injury sustained in training camp. Although Tynes would eventually recover from his injury Carney continued to hold on to the starting position and Tynes was relegated to kickoff duties. At age 44, Carney was the oldest active NFL player during the 2008 season.Giants Sign Carney, 44, At Kicker After a near perfect season (35-for-38 on field goal attempts with two blocked), Carney was chosen as the starting kicker for the NFC for the 2009 Pro Bowl. Carney was not re-signed after his contract expired, leaving him a free agent entering the 2009 season. ===Second and third stints with Saints=== Following the announcement that New Orleans Saints placekicker Garrett Hartley would be suspended the first four games of the 2009 season, Carney returned to New Orleans on August 15 on a one-year contract. With his start on November 30, he became the sixth player in NFL history to reach 300 career games. Carney was waived on December 22, two weeks after Hartley regained the starting job. On December 24, 2009, the Saints announced that Carney had been hired as a \\"kicking consultant\\", with responsibility for the snap and hold as well as working on kicking with his successor, Hartley. The appointment meant that Carney was ineligible to kick for any team for the rest of the 2009 season. Carney remained with the Saints in this capacity through the playoffs, and received credit for his role in preparing the comparatively inexperienced Hartley to make a number of critical kicks that helped the Saints win their first Super Bowl. Carney started the 2010 season without a team. However, after Hartley missed 3 out of 7 field goal attempts during the Saints' first 3 games, including a short kick in overtime that would have won a game against the Atlanta Falcons, the Saints re-signed Carney (while also retaining Hartley) on September 28, 2010. The signing made him the oldest active player in the NFL at the age of 46. On October 3, 2010, he kicked three field goals in a Saints win against the Carolina Panthers, and became the third oldest player to play in an NFL game (behind only George Blanda and Morten Andersen). On October 12, the Saints released Carney for the third time. Carney would not sign with another NFL team. He is one of only two players (George Blanda) to play across 4 different decades. ===Career regular season statistics=== {| class=\\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\\" style=\\"margin: auto;

They can be either synthetic or natural chemical compounds. Synthetic xenoestrogens include some widely used industrial compounds, such as PCBs, BPA, and phthalates, which have estrogenic effects on a living organism even though they differ chemically from the estrogenic substances produced internally by the endocrine system of any organism. Natural xenoestrogens include phytoestrogens which are plant-derived xenoestrogens. Because the primary route of exposure to these compounds is by consumption of phytoestrogenic plants, they are sometimes called \\"dietary estrogens\\". Mycoestrogens, estrogenic substances from fungi, are another type of xenoestrogen that are also considered mycotoxins. Xenoestrogens are clinically significant because they can mimic the effects of endogenous estrogen and thus have been implicated in precocious puberty and other disorders of the reproductive system. Xenoestrogens include pharmacological estrogens (estrogenic action is an intended effect, as in the drug ethinylestradiol used in contraceptive pill), but other chemicals may also have estrogenic effects. Xenoestrogens have been introduced into the environment by industrial, agricultural and chemical companies and consumers only in the last 70 years or so, but archiestrogens have been a ubiquitous part of the environment even before the existence of the human race given that some plants (like the cereals and the legumes) are using estrogenic substances possibly as part of their natural defence against herbivore animals by controlling their fertility.Infertility in the modern world: present and future prospects, Gillian R. Bentley, C. G. N. Mascie-Taylor, Cambridge University Press, p.99-100 The potential ecological and human health impact of xenoestrogens is of growing concern. The word xenoestrogen is derived from the Greek words ξένο (xeno, meaning foreign), οἶστρος (estrus, meaning sexual desire) and γόνο (gene, meaning \\"to generate\\") and literally means \\"foreign estrogen\\". Xenoestrogens are also called \\"environmental hormones\\" or \\"EDC\\" (Endocrine Disrupting Compounds). Most scientists that study xenoestrogens, including The Endocrine Society, regard them as serious environmental hazards that have hormone disruptive effects on both wildlife and humans. == Mechanism of action == The onset of puberty is characterized by increased levels of hypothalamic gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH). GnRH triggers the secretion of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) from the anterior pituitary gland, which in turn causes the ovaries to respond and secrete estradiol. Increases in gonadal estrogen promote breast development, female fat distribution and skeletal growth. Adrenal androgen and gonadal androgen result in pubic and axillary hair. Peripheral precocious puberty caused by exogenous estrogens is evaluated by assessing decreased levels of gonadotrophins. Xenoestrogens in plastics, packaged food, drink trays and containers, (more so, when they've been heated in the Sun, or an oven), may interfere with pubertal development by actions at different levels – hypothalamic-pituitary axis, gonads, peripheral target organs such as the breast, hair follicles and genitals. Exogenous chemicals that mimic estrogen can alter the functions of the endocrine system and cause various health defects by interfering with synthesis, metabolism, binding or cellular responses of natural estrogens. Although the physiology of the reproductive system is complex, the action of environmental exogenous estrogens is hypothesized to occur by two possible mechanisms. Xenoestrogens may temporarily or permanently alter the feedback loops in the brain, pituitary, gonads, and thyroid by mimicking the effects of estrogen and triggering their specific receptors or they may bind to hormone receptors and block the action of natural hormones. Thus it is plausible that environmental estrogens can accelerate sexual development if present in a sufficient concentration or with chronic exposure. The similarity in the structure of exogenous estrogens and the estrogens has changed the hormone balance within the body and resulted in various reproductive problems in females. The overall mechanism of action is binding of the exogenous compounds that mimic estrogen to the estrogen binding receptors and cause the determined action in the target organs. == Effects == Xenoestrogens have been implicated in a variety of medical problems, and during the last 10 years many scientific studies have found hard evidence of adverse effects on human and animal health. There is a concern that xenoestrogens may act as false messengers and disrupt the process of reproduction. Xenoestrogens, like all estrogens, can increase growth of the endometrium, so treatments for endometriosis include avoidance of products which contain them. Likewise, they are avoided in order to prevent the onset or aggravation of adenomyosis. Studies have implicated observations of disturbances in wildlife with estrogenic exposure. For example, discharge from human settlement including runoff and water flowing out of wastewater treatment plants release a large amount of xenoestrogens into streams, which lead to immense alterations in aquatic life. With a bioaccumulation factor of 105 –106, fish are extremely susceptible to pollutants. Streams in more arid conditions are thought to have more effects due to higher concentrations of the chemicals arising from lack of dilution. Xenoestrogen is not good for the health of the uterus. It reduces the flexibility of the uterine walls. Xenoestrogen makes the uterine walls thinner and fragile. When comparing fish from above a wastewater treatment plant and below a wastewater treatment plant, studies found disrupted ovarian and testicular histopathology, gonadal intersex, reduced gonad size, vitellogenin induction, and altered sex ratios. The sex ratios are female biased because xenoestrogens interrupt gonadal configuration causing complete or partial sex reversal. When comparing adjacent populations of white sucker fish, the exposed female fish can have up to five oocyte stages and asynchronously developing ovaries versus the unexposed female fish who usually have two oocyte stages and group-synchronously developing ovaries. Previously, this type of difference has only been found between tropical and temperate species. Sperm concentrations and motility perimeters are reduced in male fish exposed to xenoestrogens in addition to disrupt stages of spermatogenesis. Moreover, xenoestrogens have been leading to vast amounts of intersex in fish. For example, one study indicates the numbers of intersex in white sucker fish to be equal to the number of males in the population downstream of a waste water treatment plant. No intersex members were found upstream from the plant. Also, they found differences in the proportion of testicular and ovarian tissue and its degree of organization between the intersex fish. Furthermore, xenoestrogens expose fish to CYP1A inducers through inhibiting a putative labile protein and enhancing the Ah receptor, which has been linked to epizootics of cancer and the initiation of tumors. The induction of CYP1A has been established to be a good bioindicator for xenoestrogen exposure. In addition, xenoestrogens stimulate vitellogenin (Vtg), which acts as a nutrient reserve, and Zona readiata proteins (Zrp), which forms eggshells. Therefore, Vtg and Zrp are biomarkers to exposure for fish. Another potential effect of xenoestrogens is on oncogenes, specifically in relation to breast cancer. Some scientists doubt that xenoestrogens have any significant biological effect, in the concentrations found in the environment. However, there is substantial evidence in a variety of recent studies to indicate that xenoestrogens can increase breast cancer growth in tissue culture. It has been suggested that very low levels of a xenoestrogen, Bisphenol A, could affect fetal neural signalling more than higher levels, indicating that classical models where dose equals response may not be applicable in susceptible tissue. As this study involved intra-cerebellar injections, its relevance to environmental exposures is unclear, as is the role of an estrogenic effect compared to some other toxic effect of bisphenol A. Other scientists argue that the observed effects are spurious and inconsistent, or that the quantities of the agents are too low to have any effect. A 1997 survey of scientists in fields pertinent to evaluating estrogens found that 13 percent regarded the health threats from xenoestrogens as \\"major,\\" 62 percent as \\"minor\\" or \\"none,\\" and 25 percent were unsure. There has been speculation that falling sperm counts in males may be due to increased estrogen exposure in utero. Sharpe in a 2005 review indicated that external estrogenic substances are too weak in their cumulative effects to alter male reproductive functioning, but indicates that the situation appears to be more complex as external chemicals may affect the internal testosterone-estrogen balance. === Impact === The ubiquitous presence of such estrogenic substances is a significant health concern, both individually and for a population. Life relies on the transmission of biochemical information to the next generation, and the presence of xenoestrogens may interfere with this transgenerational information process through \\"chemical confusion\\" (Vidaeff and Sever), who state: \\"The results do not support with certainty the view that environmental estrogens contribute to an increase in male reproductive disorders, neither do they provide sufficient grounds to reject such a hypothesis.\\" A 2008 report demonstrates further evidence of widespread effects of feminizing chemicals on male development in each class of vertebrate species as a worldwide phenomenon. 99% percent of over 100,000 recently introduced chemicals are underregulated, according to the European Commission.It's official: Men are the weaker sex 7 December 2008. The Independent. Agencies such as the United States Environmental Protection Agency and the World Health Organization International Programme on Chemical Safety are charged to address these issues. === Precocious puberty === Puberty is a complex developmental process defined as the transition from childhood to adolescence and adult reproductive function. The first sign of female puberty is an acceleration of growth followed by the development of a palpable breast bud (thelarche). The median age of thelarche is 9.8 years. Although the sequence may be reversed, androgen dependent changes such as growth of axillary and pubic hair, body odor and acne (adrenarche) usually appears 2 years later. Onset of menstruation (menarche) is a late event (median 12.8 years), occurring after the peak of growth has passed. Puberty is considered precocious (precocious puberty) if secondary sex characteristics occur before the age of 8 in girls and 9 years in boys. Increased growth is often the first change in precocious puberty, followed by breast development and growth of pubic hair. However, thelarche, adrenarche, and linear growth can occur simultaneously and although uncommon, menarche can be the first sign. Precocious puberty can be classified into central (gonadotropin-dependent) precocious puberty or peripheral (gonadotropin-independent) puberty. Peripheral precocious puberty has been linked to exposure to exogenous estrogenic compounds. Age of onset of puberty is influenced by many factors such as genetics, nutritional status, ethnicity and environmental factors including socio-economic conditions and geographical location. A decline of age at onset of puberty from 17 years of age to 13 years of age has occurred over a period of 200 years until the middle of the 20th century. Trends toward earlier puberty have been attributed to improved public health and living conditions. A leading hypothesis for this change toward early puberty is improved nutrition resulting in rapid body growth, increased weight and fat deposition. However, many opponents believe that chemical exposure may play a role. Two recent epidemiologic studies in the United States (PROS and NMANES III)The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III (NHANES III) and the Pediatric Research in Office Settings (PROS) highlighted a recent unexpected advance in sexual maturation in girls. American, European and Asian studies suggest breast development in girls occurs at a much younger age than a few decades ago, irrespective of race and socioeconomic conditions. Environmental chemical exposure is one of the factors implicated in the recent downward trend of earlier sexual maturation. ==== Thelarche in Puerto Rico ==== Since 1979, pediatric endocrinologists in Puerto Rico recognized an increase in number of patients with premature thelarche. The presence of phthalates were measured in the blood of 41 girls experiencing early onset breast development and matched set of controls. The average age of girls with premature thelarche was 31 months. They found high phthalate levels in the girls suffering from premature thelarche compared to the controls. Not all cases of premature thelarche in the study sample contained elevated levels of phthalate esters and there was concern whether artificial contamination from vinyl lab equipment and tubing invalidated the results, hence weakening the link between exposure and causation. ==== Tuscany precocious puberty cases ==== Dr. Massart and colleagues from the University of Pisa studied the increased prevalence of precocious puberty in a region of northwest Tuscany. This region of Italy is represented by a high density of navy yards and greenhouses where exposures to pesticides and mycoestrogens (estrogens produced by fungi) are common. Although unable to identify a definitive cause of the high rates of precocious puberty, the authors concluded environmental pesticides and herbicides may be implicated. ==== Dairy contamination ==== Animal feed was contaminated with several thousand pounds of polybrominated biphenyl in Michigan in 1973 resulting in high exposures of PBB in the population via milk and other products from contaminated cows. Perinatal exposure of children was estimated by measuring PBB in serum of mothers some years after exposure. Girls that had been exposed to high PBB levels through lactation had an earlier age of menarche and pubic hair development than girls who had less perinatal exposure. The study noted there no differences found in the timing of breast development among the cases and controls. ==== Fish contamination ==== The Great Lakes have been polluted with industrial wastes (mainly PCBs and DDT) since the beginning of the 20th century. These compounds have accumulated in birds and sports fish. A study was designed to assess the impact of consumption of contaminated fish on pregnant women and their children. Concentrations of maternal serum PCB and DDE and their daughters' age at menarche were reviewed. In multivariate analysis, DDE but not PCB was linked with a lowered age of menarche. Limitations of the study included indirect measurement of the exposure and self reporting of menarche. ==== Implications ==== Precocious puberty has numerous significant physical, psychological and social implications for a young girl. Unfortunately, premature pubertal growth spurt and accelerated bone maturation will result in premature closure of distal epiphysis which causes reduced adult height and short stature. In 1999, US Food and Drug Administration has recommended to not take estrogen in food of more than 3.24 ng per day for females. Precocious puberty has also been implicated in pediatric and adult obesity. Some studies have suggested precocious puberty places girls at a higher risk of breast cancer later in life. Precocious puberty is linked with other gynecologic disorders such as endometriosis, adenomyosis, polycystic ovarian syndrome and infertility. Precocious puberty can lead to psychosocial distress, a poor self-image, and poor self-esteem. Girls with secondary sex characteristics at such a young age are more likely to be bullied and suffer from sexual abuse. Studies indicate that girls who become sexually mature at earlier ages are also more likely to engage in risk-taking behaviors such as smoking, alcohol or drug use, and engage in unprotected sex. The current literature is inadequate to provide the information we need to assess the extent to which environmental chemicals contribute to precocious puberty. Gaps in our knowledge are the result of limitations in the designs of studies, small sample sizes, challenges to conducting exposure assessment and the few number of chemicals studied. Unfortunately exposure is inferred and not actually measured in available studies. The ability to detect the possible role of chemicals in altering pubertal development is confounded by many nutritional, genetic and lifestyle factors capable of affecting puberty and the complex nature of the reproductive endocrine system. Other research challenges include shifts in exposure levels among populations over time and simultaneous exposures to multiple compounds. Overall the literature does not with certainty support the contention that environmental chemicals or dietary factors are having widespread effects on human sexual development. However data does not refute such a hypothesis either. Accelerated sexual development is plausible in individuals exposed to high concentration of estrogenic substances. There is a concerning steady increase in exposure to a wide variety of xenoestrogens in the industrial world. Further research is needed to assess the impact of these compounds on pubertal development. === In other animals === Non-human animal studies have shown that exposure to environmental contaminants with estrogenic activity can accelerate the onset of puberty. A potential mechanism has been described in rats exposed to DDT or beta- estradiol in which GnRH pulsatile secretion was found to be increased. Oral exposure of female rats to xenoestrogens has been shown to cause pseudo precocious puberty (early vaginal opening and early first estrus). A study of dioxin in immature female rats induced early follicular development and phthalates are known to decrease the anogenital distance in newborn rats. Although this article focuses on the effects of xenoestrogens and reproductive function in females, numerous animal studies also implicate environmental estrogens' and androgens' adverse effects on the male reproduction system. Administration of estrogens to developing male animals reduces testicular weight and decreases sperm production. The small phallus size of male alligators has been linked to contamination of their natural Florida habitat with DDT. Data from animal research is abundant demonstrating the adverse effects on reproduction of hormonally active compounds found in the environment. == Common environmental estrogens  Atrazine === Atrazine is widely used as an herbicide to control broad-leaf weed species that grow in crops such as corn, sugarcane, hay and winter wheat. Atrazine is also applied to Christmas trees, residential lawns, golf courses, and other recreational areas. Atrazine is the second largest selling pesticide in the world and estimated to be the most heavily used herbicide in the United States. === BPA === BPA (Bisphenol A) is the monomer used to manufacture polycarbonate plastic and epoxy resins used as a lining in most food and beverage cans. BPA global capacity is in excess of per year and thus is one of the highest-volume chemicals produced worldwide. The ester bonds in the BPA-based polycarbonates could be subject to hydrolysis and leaching of BPA. But in the case of epoxypolymers formed from bisphenol A, it is not possible to release bisphenol A by such a reaction. It is also noteworthy that, of the bisphenols, bisphenol A is a weak xenoestrogen. Other compounds, such as bisphenol Z, have been shown to have stronger estrogenic effects in rats. It has been suggested that biphenol A and other xenoestrogens might cause disease to humans and animals. One review suggests that bisphenol A exposure as a result of feasible scenarios could cause disease in humans. Bisphenol S (BPS), an analog of BPA, has also been shown to alter estrogenic activity. One study demonstrated that when cultured rat pituitary cells were exposed to low levels of BPS, it altered the estrogen-estradiol signaling pathway and led to the inappropriate release of prolactin. === DDT === DDT (Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane) was widely used in pesticides for agriculture until it was banned in 1972 in the United States due to its hazardous effects on the environment. DDT continues to be used in many parts of the world for agricultural use, insect control and to fight the spread of malaria. DDT and its metabolites DDE and DDD are persistent in the environment and accumulate in fatty tissues. === Dioxin === Dioxin, a group of highly toxic chemicals are released during combustion processes, pesticide manufacturing and chlorine bleaching of wood pulp. Dioxin is discharged into waterways from pulp and paper mills. Consumption of animals fats is thought to be the primary pathway for human exposure. === Endosulfan === Endosulfan is an insecticide used on numerous vegetables, fruits, cereal grains and trees. Endosulfan can be produced as a liquid concentrate, wettable powder or smoke tablet. Human exposure occurs through food consumption or ground and surface water contamination. === PBB === PBB (Polybrominated biphenyls) are chemicals added to plastics used in computer monitors, televisions, textiles and plastics foams to make them more difficult to burn. Manufacturing of PBBs in the United States stopped in 1976, however because they do not degrade easily PBBs continue to be found in soil, water and air. ===PCBs=== PCBs (Polychlorinated biphenyls) are man made organic chemicals known as chlorinated hydrocarbons. PCBs were manufactured primarily for use as insulating fluids and coolants given their chemical stability, low flammability and electrical insulating properties. PCBs were banned in 1979 but like DDT continue to persist in the environment. ===Phthalates=== Phthalates are plasticizers providing durability and flexibility to plastics such as polyvinyl chloride. High molecular weight phthalates are used in flooring, wall coverings and medical device such as intravenous bags and tubing. Low molecular weight phthalates are found in perfumes, lotions, cosmetics, varnishes, lacquers and coatings including timed releases in pharmaceuticals. ===Zeranol=== Zeranol is currently used as an anabolic growth promoter for livestock in the US and Canada. It has been banned in the EU since 1985, but is still present as a contaminant in food through meat products that were exposed to it. === Miscellaneous =See alsoReferencesExternal links== *\\"Our Stolen Future\\" book about endocrine disruption *How to avoid xenoestrogens *S.

It spanned an ancient road from the center of Athens, Greece, to the complex of structures on the eastern side of the city that included the Temple of Olympian Zeus. It has been proposed that the arch was built to celebrate the adventus (arrival) of the Roman emperor Hadrian and to honour him for his many benefactions to the city, on the occasion of the dedication of the nearby temple complex in 131 or 132 AD.It was a major honor for the emperor to visit any city, and such an honor demanded that appropriate respect be shown. It is not certain who commissioned the arch, although it is probable that the citizens of Athens. There were two inscriptions on the arch, facing in opposite directions, naming both Theseus and Hadrian as founders of Athens. While it is clear that the inscriptions honour Hadrian, it is uncertain whether they refer to the city as a whole or to the city in two parts: one old and one new. The early idea, however, that the arch marked the line of the ancient city wall, and thus the division between the old and the new regions of the city, has been shown to be false by further excavation. The arch is located 325m Southeast of the Acropolis. == Construction and design  Material and design === Restoration drawing of the SE side of the Arch (Stuart and Revett). Hadrian's Arch in Athens, with the Acropolis seen in the background. 3/4 view Details of the lower level. The central projecting pediment of the upper level. The entire monument is made of Pentelic marble, from Mt. Pentelikon, 18.2 km northeast of the arch. Pentelic marble was used for the Parthenon and many other notable structures in Athens, although its quality can vary significantly. The marble used for the arch is of a lower grade that had more inclusions than that used in the best Athenian buildings. The arch was constructed without cement or mortar from solid marble, using clamps to connect the cut stones. It is 18m high, 13.5m wide, and 2.3m in depth. Its design is fully symmetrical from front to back and side to side. The single arched passageway of the lower level is 6.5m wide and was supported by pilasters crowned with Corinthian capitals. Similar, but taller, pilasters flank the outer corners of the lower level. The space between the outer pilasters and the arched opening was filled in with squared stones with drafted edges to emphasize the design.The technique of drafted edges refers to the cutting in of a decorative band around the visible edges of a stone. On either side of the central passageway was a Corinthian column on a rectangular, raised base projecting from the center of the wall. The lower level was crowned with an Ionic architrave capped with dentils and a projecting geison. The upper level of the arch (the attic) was composed of a series of Corinthian columns and pilasters dividing the space into three rectangular openings. Each of the outer openings was crowned with an Ionic architrave capped with dentils and a projecting geison, in the manner of the lower level. The central opening, however, was flanked by antae with engaged Corinthian half-columns that supported a projecting triangular pediment, which rested above the dentils, geison, and sima that joined to those of the two wings. At the peak of the pediment, there was a small vegetal acroterion. The central opening of the upper level was originally closed off by a thin screen of stone, c. 7 cm thick.Graindor states that the screen of the central opening of the attic was removed for aesthetic reason on the instructions of Queen Amalia, for whom the avenue running past the arch. Hill states that all three openings were closed, but this view has not prevailed. Only the slots for its mounting are now preserved. The design of this central aediculum-like, niche of the upper level is similar to the architecture of the scaenae frons (façade of ancient stage buildings) and highly evocative of the representations of aedicula in wall painting of the 2nd Pompeian style. Even a casual examination of this arch, with a few of the many preserved Roman triumphal arches e.g. the Arch of Trajan at Benevento or the Arch of Constantine in Rome. in mind, reveals the significant design variation between the two structures. The number of arched passageways of the lower level of Roman triumphal arches was variable as was the presence of a secondary passageway along the long axis of the structure; as a dipylon arch with a single passageway, the lower level of the Arch of Hadrian falls within the gamut of the architectural genre. Roman triumphal arches, however, typically have a massive, solid attic (upper level), often filled with a dedicatory inscription and sculptural decoration. In addition, Roman arches typically supported major stone or bronze statuary, often including a quadriga (four-horse chariot) or similar at top center. As Willers notes, the design of the Arch of Hadrian has a very refined upper level that does not allow the mounting of major decoration on top of the attic. === Sculptural decoration === It has been proposed that there were statues positioned on top of the lower level, on either side of the central, aediculum-like, niche of the upper level, as was common for this architectural form; Theseus and Hadrian are the most commonly advanced candidates for these two statues, based on the inscriptions.Graindor; Travlos. Ward-Perkins has proposed that the attic held additional multiple statues, located over the projecting Corinthian columns of the lower level. In stark opposition to these proposals, Willers states that there is no evidence of the type of doweling needed to mount statuary on the top of the lower level and that the stone is far too roughly worked on the upper surface for statues to rest on it.Willers hypothesizes that the screen in the center opening of the upper level may have been intended for painted decoration, or that the decorative program of the arch may simply not have been completed. Although Willers has done an excellent study of the lower level of the arch, permission was not granted for close study of the upper level, so his statements concerning the upper level are based on previously published measurements and images. A complete investigation of the monument, perhaps with limited excavation of the foundations as Willers suggests, remains to be done. === Inscriptions and location === Two inscriptions are carved on the architrave of the arch’s lower level, one centered over the arched opening on either side. On the northwest side (towards the Acropolis), the inscription was: *ΑΙΔ' ΕΙΣΙΝ ΑΘΗΝΑΙ ΘΗΣΕΩΣ Η ΠΡΙΝ ΠΟΛΙΣ (this is Athens, the ancient city of Theseus). The inscription on the southeast side (facing the Olympeion) reads: *ΑΙΔ' ΕΙΣ' ΑΔΡΙΑΝΟΥ ΚΟΥΧΙ ΘΗΣΕΩΣ ΠΟΛΙΣ (this is the city of Hadrian, and not of Theseus).IG II² 5185. An ancient scholium (marginal note) on a manuscript of Aristides states that the emperor Hadrian, when he was expanding the city wall (of Athens), wrote (inscribed) at the boundary of the old and the new areas of Athens a double inscription matching the sense, but not the exact wording, of the inscriptions on the arch.Cited in the entry for IG II² 5185: a scholium to a text of the Panathenaicos by Aristides that reads: Ο Αδριανος ελθων και μειζονα ποιησας τον περιβολον ενθα μεν ην προ του τειχος το ταλαιον εγραψε - τουτο ο Θησευς εκτισε και ουκ Αδριανος – ενθα δε αυτον εκτισεν, - τουτο Αδριανος και ου Θησευς ωικοδομησεν. Based on a combined reading of the arch inscriptions and the scholium, it was at first accepted that the arch stood on the line of the Themistocleian wall and that it marked the division between the old city of Theseus and the new city of Hadrian.Graindor says that the arch marks the perimeter of the city of Theseus. Travlos agrees. In this view, the second inscription referred to a new urban section on the eastern side of Athens created by Hadrian, and - for convenience - this area is termed Hadrianopolis in subsequent scholarly discussion.It was a known practice for Greek inscriptions to be on the side of a boundary marker that they referred to, as Vanderpool discusses. The biographer Plutarch, in his Life of Theseus (25.3), discusses such a monument between the Peloponnesus and Attica. This newer, Roman section of the city was thought to have been added to the ancient Greek city during the period of the Pax Romana (Roman peace).The proposition that this area was an entirely new creation of Hadrian has been contested. The SE inscription Adams has proposed that the inscriptions, rather than dividing Athens into an old city of Theseus and a new city of Hadrian (Hadrianopolis), claim the entire city as a refoundation by the emperor.Adams takes issue with the interpretation of the preposition ΠΡΙΝ until recently accepted, and he offers the alternate sense of once (but no longer). In this view, the inscriptions should be read: this is Athens, once the city of Theseus; this is the city of Hadrian, and not of Theseus. One option claims a part and the other the whole of Athens for the emperor. Adams has also challenged the idea that the arch was on the line of the Themistocleian wall, and this position has now been generally accepted. A gate of the Themistocleian wall has been excavated c. 140m east of the arch, which has settled the question. Stuart and Revett, who did the earliest and only complete architectural study of the arch in 1751-53 CE, were perplexed by the fact that the arch is not aligned with the Temple of Olympian Zeus, despite the fact that it is only c. 20m from the peribolos wall (boundary wall) of that complex.Stuart and Revett. Excavations in the intervening time have shown that the arch is aligned with an ancient road that was roughly on the same course as modern Lysikrates street. The arch faces the Choragic Monument of Lysicrates 207m to the northwest along this street. === Preservation === The arch during the 1950s The Arch of Hadrian looking southeast on Lysicrates street At the time that it was recorded architecturally by Stuart and Revett in the mid-18th century, the base of the arch was buried in earth only to the level of around three feet. Given that it was thus never protected by being buried during its nearly nineteen centuries of existence, the arch entered the modern era in extraordinary condition. Although the columns of the lower level are missing, the arch is preserved to its full height and towers over modern Amalias Avenue. In recent decades, atmospheric pollution has damaged the monument. There is extensive discoloration of the stone and degradation of the inscriptions.The center of the SE inscription is effectively illegible; the NW inscription is in much better condition, although the stone (white marble) has become nearly black. == Patronage == Patronage of the arch has been attributed to either the Athenian state or to the Panhellenes, a newly formed association of all the Greek cities, based in Athens. Early scholarship held that the Athenians were responsible for its creation, on the argument that the quality of material and execution did not equal the other known buildings of Hadrian in Athens, and on the assumption that an emperor who loved Athens so much could not have been so arrogant as to put such an inscription on a structure of his own making.Graindor. Travlos agrees that it was the Athenians. The simple Philhellenism of the emperor Hadrian has been a commonplace in scholarly discussions. Willers, however, has discussed the pragmatic politics of Hadrian's interest in Greek cities and culture. Two arches of the same scale and design were constructed at the sanctuary of Demeter and Kore at Eleusis later in the 2nd century CE and dedicated to an emperor (perhaps Marcus Aurelius) by the Panhellenes. These arches flanked the propylon into the sanctuary and stood at the ends of roads to Megara and to a harbor respectively.Willers. The southeastern arch had an inscription that read: :ΤΟΙΝ ΘΕΟΙΝ ΚΑΙ ΤΩΙ ΑΥΤΟΚ[Ρ]ΑΤΟΡΙ ΟΙ ΠΑΝΕ[ΛΛΗ]ΝΕΣ (to the two goddesses and to the emperor, the Panhellenes). The use of the same design to honor two emperors within the space of a few decades and a few kilometers has prompted the idea that the Panhellenes were responsible for the arches in both locations. ==ReferencesNotes== *Adams, A. 1989. \\"The Arch of Hadrian at Athens,\\" in The Greek Renaissance in the Roman Empire, eds.

The name Sweet Auburn was coined by John Wesley Dobbs, referring to the \\"richest Negro street in the world,\\" one of the largest concentrations of African-American businesses in the United States. A National Historic Landmark District was designated in 1976, covering of the neighborhood, significant for its history and development as a segregated area under the state's Jim Crow laws. ==Geography== Sweet Auburn is one of 242 officially recognized neighborhoods of Atlanta. It is bounded by: * Freedom Parkway and the Old Fourth Ward (formerly the separate Bedford Pine neighborhood) on the north * Boulevard and the Old Fourth Ward on the east * the MARTA east–west line and the Oakland and Grant Park neighborhoods on the south, and * the Downtown Connector and downtown Atlanta on the west ==History== King Memorial MARTA station Auburn Avenue, toward downtown Atlanta The first settlement here was on land formerly occupied by Union troops and was called Shermantown for many years. It developed quickly being near the Georgia Railroad and in 1879 was at the endpoint of a newly graded road called simply Boulevard, which led from the railroad to North Avenue near Ponce de Leon Avenue and Angier Springs. The rise of Auburn Avenue as \\"the\\" black business district in Atlanta was to a great extent an outcome of the 1906 Atlanta Race Riot. Prior to this time black businesses operated largely in downtown Atlanta — a business district integrated as far as business ownership was concerned. But competition between working-class whites and blacks for jobs and housing gave rise to fears and tensions. In 1906, print media fueled these tensions with hearsay about alleged sexual assaults on white women by black men, triggering the riot, which left at least 27 people dead (25 of them black) and over 70 injured., Black businesses started to move from previously integrated business district downtown to the relative safety of the area around the Atlanta University Center west of downtown, and to Auburn Avenue in the Fourth Ward east of downtown. \\"Sweet\\" Auburn Avenue became home to Alonzo Herndon's Atlanta Mutual, the city's first black-owned life insurance company, and to a celebrated concentration of black businesses, newspapers, churches, and nightclubs. In 1956, Fortune magazine called Sweet Auburn \\"the richest Negro street in the world\\", a phrase originally coined by civil rights leader John Wesley Dobbs from the poem The Deserted Village by Oliver Goldsmith.\\"Auburn Avenue (Sweet Auburn)\\", New Georgia Encyclopedia Sweet Auburn and Atlanta's black colleges formed the nexus of a prosperous black middle class and upper class which arose despite enormous social and legal obstacles. Sweet Auburn was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1976. and However, like so many other inner-city neighborhoods, Sweet Auburn fell victim to lack of investment, heavy, widespread crime, homelessness, and abandonment, compounded by construction of the Downtown Connector freeway that split it in two. In 1992 the National Trust for Historic Preservation recognized that it was one of America's 11 Most Endangered Historic Places and, in 2005, the Georgia Trust for Historic Preservation included the area in its 2006 list of Places in Peril. The Historic District Development Corporation (HDDC) was formed to turn the trend around, starting with houses surrounding the birth home of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., and working outward. In 2014, the city of Atlanta completed the installation of the Atlanta Streetcar, a line that creates a loop connecting the Martin Luther King Jr. National Historical Park to downtown and the tourist attractions of Centennial Olympic Park. The streetcar travels east along Edgewood Avenue and west along Auburn Avenue. ==Historic structures and businesses== Visitors at the Martin Luther King Jr. National Historical Park Big Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church Several churches located along the avenue, such as Big Bethel AME and First Congregational, helped build and maintain the heritage of the street. The Royal Peacock Club provided an elegant setting where many African Americans could perform and bring the changing styles of black popular music to Atlanta. Originally called the Top Hat Club when it opened in 1938, the club hosted local talent and national acts such as B.B. King, the Four Tops, the Tams and Atlanta's own Gladys Knight. One of the many significant commercial buildings within the district is the Atlanta Life Insurance Company. The second-largest black insurance company in the United States, Atlanta Life Insurance was founded in 1905 by Alonzo Herndon, a former slave from Walton County, Georgia. The central building of the Atlanta Life Insurance Company complex is a Beaux Arts building facing Auburn Avenue. The district also includes the Rucker Building, Atlanta's first black-owned office building, constructed in 1904 by Henry A. Rucker, a former slave turned businessman and politician. Also located on Auburn Avenue was The Atlanta Daily World, the first black-owned daily newspaper, which was founded here in 1928. (The Atlanta Daily World is still the nation's longest running African American newspaper.) In 1948, the Atlanta Police Department was integrated, hiring eight black police officers, all of whom were assigned to Auburn Avenue. ===List of historical churches and businesses=== * APEX Museum – founded in 1985 * Atlanta Daily World – founded in 1928 * Atlanta Life Insurance – founded in 1905 * Big Bethel AME Church – founded in 1847 * Ebenezer Baptist Church – founded in 1886 *Herndon Building – opened in 1924, demolished following damage from 2008 Atlanta tornado * Martin Luther King Jr. National Historical Park, including: ** Dr. King's birth (January 15, 1929) home – built in 1895 ** Visitors Center – founded in 1980 *Odd Fellows Building and Auditorium – 1912–13 * Rucker Building – constructed 1904 * Sweet Auburn Curb Market – opened in 1924 ==Culture== Mural in Sweet Auburn Sweet Auburn celebrates the annual Auburn SpringFest, and in the Fall, the Sweet Auburn Heritage Festival. The Sweet Auburn Heritage Festival is an annual festival held the first weekend in October on Auburn Avenue. Civil rights leader Hosea Williams founded the first festival in 1984. Charles Johnson founded the festival in 1994 as a way to celebrate the African American achievements as established on Auburn Avenue. The festival offers food, art, and entertainment throughout the day while celebrating Auburn Avenue's past and growth, and is operated by the Sweet Auburn Committee. The festival's entertainment varies from comedians to up and coming artists from diverse genres of music. The Sweet Auburn Heritage Festival searches for entertainment from cities such as Atlanta, Macon, Savannah, Augusta, Huntsville and Chattanooga in hopes to help non- established artist's path to stardom. Artist such as Usher Raymond, Outkast, India.Arie, and Raven-Symoné have started out performing on stage at the festival. Ultimately, the Sweet Auburn Heritage Festival entertainment has grown much farther than originally anticipated from its beginning stages in 1984. Edgewood Avenue which runs through the heart of Sweet Auburn has become a hotspot for viewing for street art in Atlanta. Works by international artists such as Sten Lex and local artists such as Dr. Dax and Chris Veal can be found on Edgewood Avenue and the surrounding streets.

She eventually made her way to New York City, where she worked as secretary to journalist Walter Lippmann of the New York Herald. ==Espionage career== Sometime prior to March 1941, Mary Price allegedly agreed to furnish Jacob Golos, controller of the secret apparatus of the Communist Party of the USA (CPUSA) on behalf of the Soviet Union, with all the information she could concerning the material Lippmann was writing and his contacts. Elizabeth Bentley was made the courier between Washington D.C., where Price worked, and New York City, where she and Golos lived together. Price allegedly became a \\"cut out\\", or go-between, for government employees who were also members of the CPUSA secret apparatus. Among them were Maurice Halperin, Duncan Lee, Helen Tenney of the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), Robert Miller of the U.S. State Department, and Michael Greenberg, an associate of presidential aide Lauchlin Currie. Lee was the personal assistant to OSS head General William J. Donovan, the first intelligence chief in America's newly created wartime intelligence agency. The material from Halperin was considered extremely valuable especially how it related to the Polish government in exile. Mary Price's apartment in Washington eventually became the rendezvous point for meetings between Golos' courier and the Perlo group. Various members of the Perlo group would meet with Bentley every two or three weeks in the apartment. Those members delivering stolen intelligence materials included Victor Perlo, chief of the Aviation Section, War Production Board (WPB); Edward Fitzgerald of the WPB; Charles Kramer who worked for Senate Subcommittee on War Mobilization, the Office of Price Administration, and Senate Subcommittee on Wartime Health and Education throughout World War II; Allen Rosenberg, who was on the Board of Economic Warfare and became Chief of the Economic Institution Staff of the Foreign Economic Administration; and Donald Wheeler of the OSS Analysis division. Soviet intelligence considered the Perlo group to be an extremely valuable asset, and upon the death of Golos in late 1942, sought to control Mary Price directly. Iskhak Akhmerov, chief of the NKGB illegal station in the U.S., wanted to establish her in an apartment in the Georgetown section of Washington for the sexual entrapment of blackmail victims. In November 1944, Anatoly Gorsky reported to Moscow that according to Elizabeth Bentley, Price had begun a sexual relationship with one of her sources, Duncan Chaplin Lee. \\"(Price) established an intimate relationship with (Lee), and she did not tell us about it until recently.\\" Gorsky was concerned that this affair might result in Lee's exposure as a spy because his wife, who was also a member of the Communist Party of the United States (CPUSA), knew about his spying. \\"(Lee) and (Price) met in two places, at her flat and at his. The meetings were held in the presence of (Lee's) wife, who was aware of her husband's secret work.\\" Anatoly Gorsky, report to Moscow (2 November 1944) Lee's wife discovered her husband's love affair and complained in a series of jealous scenes. The NKVD became worried about these developments and ordered her to stop serving as his courier.http://spartacus- educational.com/Mary_Price.htm Elizabeth Bentley claimed Price was psychologically unfit for further clandestine work. The head of the CPUSA, Earl Browder, later released her from the NKGB. Her code name used by Soviet intelligence was \\"Dir\\". ==Political activities and later years== Price, by now retired from spying, returned to North Carolina around 1945 and organized the state chapter of a liberal group, the Southern Conference for Human Welfare. In 1948, Price became the head of the state's Progressive Party. As the Progressive Party nominee, she was the first woman to appear on the ballot as a candidate for Governor of North Carolina. After Bentley accused Price of being a spy in July of that year, she came in a distant third in the election, and moved back to Washington, D.C., where she worked at the embassy of Czechoslovakia. In later years, she married Charles Adamson and worked for the National Council of Churches. She died in California in 1980.Christensen, Rob.

Its construction began in September 1937, and was slated for completion in 1943. Like most other Nazi monumental structures, however, its construction was interrupted by the outbreak of World War II and was never finished. == Design == Adolf Hitler (Albert Speer, behind him) visiting a test construction site near Nuremberg The party rally grounds in the year 1940, the Deutsches Stadion in the centre, left. According to Speer himself, it was inspired not by the Circus Maximus in Rome but by the Panathenaic Stadium of Athens, which had impressed him greatly when he had visited it in 1935.Albert Speer, Erinnerungen (Berlin: Ullstein-Verlag, 1996), 75. Speer's stadium was a gigantic inflation of its Greco-Roman model, from which he borrowed the horseshoe configuration and the propylaeum, now transformed into a raised, pillared, temple-like structure (Säulenvorhof) attached to the open end of the stadium by an internally pillared courtyard.Leon Krier, Albert Speer Architecture (New York: Princeton Architectural Press, 1989), 176-85. Since the stadium was not set like the Panathenaic Stadium structure at the bottom of a gully, but on a flat area of land (24 hectares), its five tiers of seats for 405,000 spectators had to be supported in the usual Roman manner by massive barrel vaults. The external façade of pink granite blocks, which would have risen to a height of about 90 metres, consisted of a series of arches 65 metres high resting on a podium of dark red granite. The arcade and podium again suggests a Roman, not a Greek, circus or stadium, which did not traditionally rest on a substructure. In order to deliver such a vast number of spectators to their seats quickly, express lifts were to be installed to take spectators 100 at a time to seats on the top three tiers.Albert Speer, Architektur: Arbeiten 1933-1942 (Berlin: Propyläen, 1995), 18. The short transverse axis of the stadium culminated at each of its ends in a raised Ehrentribüne (Tribune of Honour) for the Führer, special guests and the press. Once more, Roman practice provided the architectural precedent.Alexander Scobie, Hitler's State Architecture: The Impact of Classical Antiquity (University Park: Pennsylvania State University Press, 1990), 78. Speer apparently adopted a horseshoe shape for his building only after rejecting the oval shape of an amphitheatre. The latter plan, he claimed, would have intensified the heat and produced psychological discomfort, a comment he does not elucidate. When Speer remarked on the staggering cost of the building, Hitler, who laid its cornerstone on September 9, 1937, merely retorted that it would cost less than two battleships of the .Speer, Erinnerungen, 8. == Projected use == Wolfgang Lotz, writing about the stadium in 1937, commented that it would contain twice the number of spectators originally accommodated by the Circus Maximus. Inevitably for the period, he also emphasized the community feeling that such a building would engender between competitors and spectators: > As in ancient Greece, the elite and most experienced men chosen from the > mass of the nation will compete against each other here. An entire nation in > sympathetic wonder is seated on the tiers. Spectators and competitors merge > in one unity.Wolfgang Lotz, Das Deutsche Stadion für Nürnberg \\"Moderne > Bauformen\\" (Berlin: 1937), 491-92. The idea of staging Pan-Germanic athletic games here was perhaps suggested by the Panathenaic Games, but Speer's stadium was, despite his own statement, stylistically more Roman than Greek in inspiration and with its huge barrel- vaulted substructures and arcaded exterior facade, more like the Circus Maximus than the Panathenaic Stadium. Nazi building exhibits a mixture of Greek and Roman elements, with Roman predominating.Scobie, Hitler's State Architecture, 80. But Hitler did not want such a stadium to serve merely as a centre for German athletic sport. The restored Panathenaic Stadium had been used for the 1896 Summer Olympics and the 1906 Intercalated Games, held out of series.Franz-Joachim Verspohl, Stadionbauten von der Antike bis zur Gegenwart: Regie und Selbsterfahrung der Massen, 1st edition (Berlin: Anabas-Verlag, 1976), 163. In 1936 these games were held in the Reichssportfeld in Berlin, but Hitler insisted that after 1940, when the games were to have been held in Tokyo, all future games were to be held in the Deutsches Stadion.Speer, Errinnerungen, 84.Jochen Thies, Architekt der Weltherrschaft: Die \\"Endziele Hitlers\\" (Berlin: Droste, 1976), 91. This stadium was in all its dimensions far larger than the 1936 Olympic Stadium in Berlin, which held only 115,000 spectators.Lotz, Das Deutsche Stadion für Nürnberg \\"Moderne Bauformen\\", 493. Hitler anticipated that after winning the war, the world would have no choice but to send its athletes to Germany every time the Olympic Games were held at which, no doubt, victors would have received their prizes from the Führer, surrounded by the party faithful on the pulvinar on the short axis of the cavernous stadium . == The site after the war == Warning sign at the Silbersee lake After the war, the horseshoe shaped foundation of the building quickly filled with groundwater and was named \\"Silbersee\\" (Silver lake) by locals. The site became a dump for debris of Nuremberg's destroyed buildings and any kind of other waste, including what today is considered hazardous waste. The southern part of the horseshoe was filled up to ground level with waste in 1951. After that a mountain of waste continued to grow until the dump was closed in 1962. The landfill, which contains 5,53 million m³ waste, was covered with a layer of earth and trees were planted on it. The new mountain was named \\"Silberbuck\\". Since the dump has no containment and is permeated by ground water, dangerous material is constantly leaking into the Silbersee. The lower layers of water in the lake contain extremely high amounts of hydrogen sulfide, which makes humans unconscious when breathed in. Approximately 50 people have already died in the lake. == Prototype construction work == Remainders of the test construction site. The small village of Achtel in Hirschbach, Bavaria is the site of a sports grandstand constructed as a prototype for part of the Deutsches Stadion. It was constructed mostly of wood, which was removed after the war and was used to reconstruct local buildings. Today only the concrete supports remain. ==See also== * Fascist architecture * List of Nazi construction * Nazi architecture * Welthauptstadt Germania ==ReferencesFurther reading== * Krier, Leon.

Having studied at the Juilliard School under the supervision of John Houseman, Gallagher began her career on stage, and has appeared in several Broadway theatre productions, winning a Theatre World Award for her role in A Few Good Men. From there, Gallagher moved to Los Angeles to pursue acting in film and television; after making a screen debut in George Washington, she graduated to recurring roles in Hill Street Blues and China Beach, and starring roles in The Slap Maxwell Story, The Larry Sanders Show and Millennium. The role of Catherine Black in that series had been written with Gallagher in mind. ==Early life== Gallagher was born in Reading, Pennsylvania on February 6, 1960, to Aileen and Donald Gallagher. She was the fifth of six children. Her mother had also been an actor in her youth, retiring when she began a family. Gallagher credits her own career to her mother, who would take her to Broadway theatre productions as a child. She has also cited Mary Tyler Moore and Katharine Hepburn as influences on her career. She attended Wyomissing Area Junior/Senior High School, where she elected not to attend her high school prom in order to continue her rehearsals at a local community theatre, Genesius Theatre. Gallagher moved to New York to study acting at the Juilliard School under the tutelage of John Houseman. Included in her class were Penny Johnson Jerald, Lorraine Toussaint, Jack Kenny and Jack Stehlin. She then relocated to Los Angeles, California to further pursue her career; during this time she also took on a job taking care of stray cats. ==Career== Gallagher began her career on stage, appearing in a production of Paul Osborn Oliver Oliver before being cast in the 1989 Broadway production of Aaron Sorkin's A Few Good Men. Her portrayal of LCDR JoAnne Galloway in the latter production earned her a Theatre World Award, and an Outer Critics Circle Award. In 1993, she took part in Broadway productions of both parts of Angels in America: A Gay Fantasia on National Themes—Millennium Approaches and Perestroika. Gallagher's television debut was in the miniseries George Washington. She gained the lead role in the pilot At Your Service, and a guest spot in the first episode of L.A. Law. She then went on to appear as a series regular towards the end of Hill Street Blues run, before going on to play a recurring role in China Beach; she still maintains a friendship with China Beach co-star Robert Picardo. Gallagher's role of Catherine Black in Millennium had been written by creator Chris Carter with her in mind specifically, as he had been impressed with her work as Jeannie Sanders on The Larry Sanders Show. Gallagher was also keen to work with Carter, having admired his creation of the character Dana Scully for The X-Files, whom she saw as a positive example of an intriguing female character on television. Gallagher also appeared in the legal drama Suits, acting alongside her Juilliard classmate Wendell Pierce. ==Personal life== Gallagher is married to actor Jeff Yagher, and has two children—a pair of twins. She is related by marriage to actress Catherine Hicks and make-up artist Kevin Yagher. ==FilmographyFilm=== {| class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" |- ! scope=\\"col\\" | Year ! scope=\\"col\\" | Film ! scope=\\"col\\" | Role |- ! scope=\\"row\\" | 1990 | The Ambulance | Sandra Malloy |- ! scope=\\"row\\" | 1991 | In a Strangers Hand | Laura McKillin |- ! scope=\\"row\\" | 1995 | Breaking Free | Annie Sobel |- ! scope=\\"row\\" | 1996 | Crosscut | Annie Hennessey |- ! scope=\\"row\\" | 2002 | Contagion | Dr. Diane Landis |- ! scope=\\"row\\" | 2002 | Van Wilder | Holyoake Hottie |- ! scope=\\"row\\" | 2002 | Blind Obsession | Rebecca Rose |- ! scope=\\"row\\" | 2003 | Inhabited | Meg Russel |- ! scope=\\"row\\" | 2005 | Mr. & Mrs. Smith | 40s Woman |- ! scope=\\"row\\" | 2011 | Alyce Kills | Ginny |- ! scope=\\"row\\" | 2015 | Get a Job | Abbey |- |} ===Television=== {| class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" |- ! scope=\\"col\\" | Year ! scope=\\"col\\" | Title ! scope=\\"col\\" | Role |- ! scope=\\"row\\" | 1984 | Sins of the Past | Ellen Easton |- ! scope=\\"row\\" | 1984 | George Washington | Peggy Shippen |- ! scope=\\"row\\" | 1986 | L.A.

Dougherty was born in Bootle, Merseyside, and attended Queen Elizabeth's Grammar School in Blackburn, Lancashire. He is a protégé of former professional golfer, Nick Faldo, and had an exceptional amateur career. He won numerous tournaments including the 1999 World Boys Championship and three Faldo Junior Series events. In 2001 he was a member of the victorious Great Britain and Ireland Walker Cup team. ==Professional playing career== Dougherty turned professional in 2001 and gained membership to the European Tour for 2002 via the final qualifying school. In his début season he finished 36th on the Order of Merit, and was named the Sir Henry Cotton Rookie of the Year. He was hindered by glandular fever in 2003, and his 2004 season was also disappointing when he slipped to 97th on the Order of Merit. In early 2005 he earned his first victory on the European Tour at the Caltex Masters in Singapore, going on to reach the top 100 of the Official World Golf Rankings in the middle of the year, and ended it in 15th place on the final European Tour Order of Merit. He also made a strong start to the 2006 season before struggling later in the year. Dougherty would bounce back in 2007, and was the leader after the first round of the 107th US Open at Oakmont Country Club with a two under par round of 68. He eventually finished the tournament in a tie for seventh place. This is, to date, his best finish in a major championship, and was also enough to gain automatic entry into the following years championship and the US Masters. Later that year he secured his second European Tour victory at the Alfred Dunhill Links Championship, and finished the season placed 11th on the Order of Merit. After a disappointing 2008 season which was marred by the sudden death of his mother, Dougherty recorded his third European Tour victory at the 2009 BMW International Open in Munich, Germany. He was three shots behind 54-hole leader Retief Goosen going into the final round. He shot a final round of 64 and ended with a one stroke victory over Rafael Echenique, who made an albatross 2 on the par-5 18th, and by four over Goosen. The win secured Dougherty a spot in his first major of 2009, The Open Championship at Turnberry in July. Dougherty ended up losing his European Tour card in 2011 after making only one cut during 32 events. Although he finished 45th at the Omega European Masters with a first day 63 helping him to prize money of 10,600 euros, it was not enough to retain his 2012 tour card. He attended the European Qualifying School in late 2011, but was unsuccessful and consequently settled for membership on the Challenge Tour. At the end of 2013 he found himself at Q school on the Challenge Tour where he stated he was much happier with his game than he had been for a while, but success continued to elude him.

It was established on September 8, 1904 and developed as a result of the 1920 discovery of oil in the Huntington Beach Oil Field. The census- designated place of Sunset Beach and its population of 971 as of the 2010 census was annexed by Huntington Beach in 2011. The elevation is 5.3 feet above sea level and the community is stretched out along Pacific Coast Highway bracketed by the ocean and Huntington Harbour. ==History== Sunset Beach was established in 1905 and developed as a result of the 1920 discovery of oil in the Huntington Beach Oil Field. On August 2, 2010 the Huntington Beach city council, in a 5-2 vote, voted to annex Sunset Beach making the community a part of the much larger Huntington Beach. The annexation was to have officially begun in January 2011 but a group of residents filed suit on December 9, 2010 to stop the annexation due to new taxes that would be imposed on them once they become part of Huntington Beach. A hearing for a preliminary injunction was scheduled for January 19, 2011 in Orange County Superior Court. Huntington Beach officially annexed Sunset Beach in August 2011. ==Geography== According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP covered an area of 0.2 square miles (0.5 km2), 97.51% of it land, and 2.49% of it water. ==Demographics== The 2010 United States Census reported that Sunset Beach had a population of 971. The population density was 4,919.3 people per square mile (1,899.4/km2). The racial makeup of Sunset Beach was 863 (88.9%) White, 4 (0.4%) African American, 6 (0.6%) Native American, 42 (4.3%) Asian, 2 (0.2%) Pacific Islander, 18 (1.9%) from other races, and 36 (3.7%) from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 79 persons (8.1%). The Census reported that 971 people (100% of the population) lived in households, 0 (0%) lived in non-institutionalized group quarters, and 0 (0%) were institutionalized. There were 515 households, out of which 69 (13.4%) had children under the age of 18 living in them, 179 (34.8%) were opposite-sex married couples living together, 19 (3.7%) had a female householder with no husband present, 23 (4.5%) had a male householder with no wife present. There were 29 (5.6%) unmarried opposite-sex partnerships, and 5 (1.0%) same-sex married couples or partnerships. 224 households (43.5%) were made up of individuals, and 48 (9.3%) had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 1.89. There were 221 families (42.9% of all households); the average family size was 2.64. The population was spread out, with 106 people (10.9%) under the age of 18, 72 people (7.4%) aged 18 to 24, 280 people (28.8%) aged 25 to 44, 365 people (37.6%) aged 45 to 64, and 148 people (15.2%) who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 46.9 years. For every 100 females, there were 120.2 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 117.3 males. There were 641 housing units at an average density of 3,247.5 per square mile (1,253.8/km2), of which 211 (41.0%) were owner-occupied, and 304 (59.0%) were occupied by renters. The homeowner vacancy rate was 4.4%; the rental vacancy rate was 8.9%. 455 people (46.9% of the population) lived in owner-occupied housing units and 516 people (53.1%) lived in rental housing units. ==Economy== A surfer rides the break at Sunset Beach Sunset Beach has a number of restaurants and bars, including Captain Jack's, founded by noted surfer Jack Haley Sr., the father of basketball player Jack Haley. ==Arts and culture== The Sunset Beach Art Festival is held annually during Mothers Day weekend. It was created in 1948 by the local women's group as a way to promote education and social activities and was initially called the Beachcomber's Carnival. The festival generates $30,000 to $40,000, with all the proceeds going to charity. ==Parks and recreation== Sunset Beach features one of the widest beaches in southern California. Running parallel to the beach, from the north of town to the southern edge is the Green Belt, a bucolic 14 acre park on which residents walk their dogs and celebrate Mother's Day with the historic Sunset Beach Art Festival, sponsored by Las Damas. Southeast of Sunset Beach is Bolsa Chica State Beach. To the east is the bayfront community of Huntington Harbour (part of Huntington Beach), and roughly north is the Naval Weapons Station Seal Beach, and the Seal Beach National Wildlife Refuge. The small gated community of Surfside located between Sunset Beach and the Weapons Station is part of Seal Beach, with the rest of Seal Beach on the other side of the Weapons Station. ==Infrastructure== Sunset Beach does not have residential mail delivery. Instead, residents pick up their mail at post office boxes in the centrally- located post office or at private post office boxes located on 22nd Street. The main Post Office features an award-winning wall mural designed and painted by local artist Katy Brack. Sunset Beach is served by the Sunset Beach Sanitary District and emergencys services are provided by the Huntington Beach Police Department and the Huntington Beach Fire Department. Sunset Beach residents are civic minded and the town boasts three long term associations - The Sunset Beach Community Association SBCA, The Sunset Beach Woman's Club and Las Damas, a woman's philanthropic organization. ==See also== *Bolsa Chica State Beach *Bolsa Chica Ecological Reserve *Rancho La Bolsa Chica *List of beaches in California ==ReferencesExternal links== *Community profile in Northwest Fisheries Science Center Category:Former census-designated places in California Category:Geography of Huntington Beach, California Category:History of Orange County, California ","title":"Sunset Beach, California"},{"id":"1997950","text":"Elephant Rocks State Park is a state-owned geologic reserve and public recreation area encompassing an outcropping of Precambrian granite in the Saint Francois Mountains in the U.S. state of Missouri. The state park is named for a string of large granite boulders which resemble a train of pink circus elephants. The park was created following the donation of the land to the state in 1967 by geologist Dr. John Stafford Brown. The park is used for picnicking, rock climbing, and trail exploration. It is managed by the Missouri Department of Natural Resources. ==Geology== The Elephant Rocks, for which Elephant Rocks State Park is named, is a pile of residual boulders of weathered Graniteville Granite. It is a medium- to coarse-grained, muscovite- biotite alkali granite that, on the average, consists of 55 percent alkali feldspar, 40 percent quartz, and less than 5 percent mafic minerals. The Graniteville Granite is a pluton formed 1.4 billion years ago in the Proterozoic by the cooling of magma that intruded into the volcanic strata and country rock associated with a collapsed caldera. Nearly vertical fractures formed in the stone as it cooled, and uplift of the granite enhanced the fracturing. Eventually the overlying strata were removed through erosion, exposing the granite pluton. Before it was exposed, groundwater weathered the granite along fracture joints creating corestones of relatively solid altered granite embedded within friable saprolite. Surface runoff later eroded the saprolite that once surrounded the corestones and left, what are now locally called elephant rocks as boulders perched on the ground surface. The reddish or pink granite has been quarried in this area since 1869, and two abandoned granite quarries are within the park. These and others nearby have provided red architectural granite for buildings in states from Massachusetts to California, but most particularly in St. Louis, including stone for St. Louis City Hall and the piers of the Eads Bridge. Stones unsuitable for architectural use were made into shoebox-sized paving stones that were used on the streets of St. Louis as well as on its wharf on the Mississippi River. Stone quarried in the area currently is used for mortuary monuments and is known commercially as Missouri Red monument stone. ==Activities and amenities== A one-mile (2 km) circular interpretive trail in the Elephant Rocks Natural Area, called the Braille Trail, is the first in Missouri state parks designed specifically for visitors with visual and physical challenges. Spur trails off the main trail include one passing through \\"Fat Man's Squeeze,\\" a narrow gap between two boulders that leads hikers to an abandoned quarry, and another that goes through \\"The Maze,\\" a 100-foot (30.48 meter) section of scattered boulders. The park's picnicking area includes ADA- compliant facilities. ==ReferencesExternal links== *Elephant Rocks State Park Missouri Department of Natural Resources *Elephant Rocks State Park Map Missouri Department of Natural Resources Category:State parks of Missouri Category:Rock formations of Missouri Category:Protected areas of Iron County, Missouri Category:Protected areas established in 1967 Category:Landforms of Iron County, Missouri Category:Braille trail sites ","title":"Elephant Rocks State Park"},{"id":"1997957","text":"A Song dynasty Celadon vase with crazing glaze A close view of ceramic glaze crazing Crazing is the phenomenon that produces a network of fine cracks on the surface of a material, for example in a glaze layer. Crazing frequently precedes fracture in some glassy thermoplastic polymers. As it only takes place under tensile stress, the plane of the crazing corresponds to the stress direction. The effect is visibly distinguishable from other types of fine cracking because the crazing region has different refractive indices from surrounding material. Crazing occurs in regions of high hydrostatic tension, or in regions of very localized yielding, which leads to the formation of interpenetrating microvoids and small fibrils. If an applied tensile load is sufficient, these bridges elongate and break, causing the microvoids to grow and coalesce; as microvoids coalesce, cracks begin to form. ==Polymers== Crazing occurs in polymers, because the material is held together by a combination of weaker Van der Waals forces and stronger covalent bonds. Sufficient local stress overcomes the Van der Waals force, allowing a narrow gap. Once the slack is taken out of the backbone chain, covalent bonds holding the chain together hinder further widening of the gap. The gaps in a craze are microscopic in size. Crazes can be seen because light reflects off the surfaces of the gaps. The gaps are bridged by fine filament called fibrils, which are molecules of the stretched backbone chain. The fibrils are only a few nanometers in diameter, and cannot be seen with a light microscope, but are visible with an electron microscope. The thickness profile of a crazing is like a sewing needle: the very tip of the crazing may be as thin as several atoms. As the distance from the tip increase, it tends to thicken gradually with the rate of the increase diminishing with distance. Therefore, the growth of crazing has a critical distance from the tip. The opening angle of the crazing lies between 2° to 10°. The boundary between crazing and surrounding bulk polymer is very sharp, the microstructure of which can be scaled down to 20Å or less, which means it can only be observed by electron microscopy. A craze is different from a crack in that it cannot be felt on the surface and it can continue to support a load. Furthermore, the process of craze growth prior to cracking absorbs fracture energy and effectively increases the fracture toughness of a polymer. The initial energy absorption per square meter in a craze region has been found to be up to several hundred times that of the uncrazed region, but quickly decreases and levels off. Crazes form at highly stressed regions associated with scratches, flaws, stress concentrations and molecular inhomogeneities. Crazes generally propagate perpendicular to the applied tension. Crazing occurs mostly in amorphous, brittle polymers like polystyrene (PS), acrylic (PMMA), and polycarbonate; it is typified by a whitening of the crazed region. The white colour is caused by light-scattering from the crazes. The production of crazing is a reversible process, after applied compressive stress or elevated temperature (higher than glass transformation temperature), it may disappear and the materials will return to optically homogeneous state. Shear banding is the narrow region with high level of shearing strain from local strain softening; it is also very common during the deformation of thermoplastic materials. One of the main differences between crazing and shear banding is that crazing occurs with an increase in volume, which shear banding does not. This means that under compression, many of these brittle, amorphous polymers will shear band rather than craze, as there is a contraction of volume instead of an increase. In addition, when crazing occurs, one will typically not observe \\"necking,\\" or concentration of force upon one spot in a material. Rather, crazing will occur homogeneously throughout the material. ===Rubber toughening=== Rubber particles are often used to toughen thermoplastic materials. After modification, the ability of absorbing energy will be increased significantly. For some brittle plastic materials, they can even go through brittle-ductile transformation. Previously, the rubber particles were considered as the main contributor to the increased energy absorption. It was proposed that rubber particles might gather around crack tips under tension and impede the growth of crack, or the contraction of rubber particles induced the decline of glass transformation temperature of the matrix. Nevertheless, experiments showed that the energy absorbed by rubber particles made up only 10% of the total energy, and the decrease of glass transformation temperature caused by rubber was only around 10 K, which was not enough for the matrix to yield at room temperature. Schmitt and Bucknall developed the mechanism of rubber toughening according to the existence of stress whitening and shear yielding when the stress is lower than fracture strength. They proposed that the rubber particles served as the center for stress concentration, hence initiated the brittle-ductile transformation and yielding of the matrix material. To specify, yielding happens in the form of crazing or shear band, which can consume a large portion of deformation energy. === Environment effect === Crazing can take place in glassy polymers under environmental effects. It is problematic because it requires a much lower stress state and sometimes happens after a long delay, which means it is hard to detect and avoid. For example, PMMA containers in daily use are quite resistive to humidity and temperature without any visible defects. After machine-washing and left in air for one or two days, they will shutter abruptly when wet with gin. During the process, the stress applied is negligible, but crazing is still found on the containers. There are many theories that tried to explain the environmental effects upon formation of crazing, among which surface energy reduction and plasticization are widely accepted and well developed. To eliminate the environmental crazing and cracking, many methods like surface coating, stress reduction are adopted. However, due to the complicity of the environmental effects, especially the effects in organic environment, it's hard to find a general solution and remove the effect completely. ==Construction== Crazing is also seen on single ply roofing membranes, joint sealant, and on concrete when good concrete practices are not followed. ==Ceramics== Crazing is a glaze defect of glazed pottery. Characterised as a spider web pattern of cracks penetrating the glaze, it is caused by tensile stresses greater than the glaze is able to withstand.”Ceramics Glaze Technology.” J.R.Taylor, A.C.Bull. Institute Of Ceramics / Pergamon Press. 1986.Ceramic Glazes. 3rd edition. Parmelee C. W. The Maple Press Company. 1973 In pottery a distinction is often made between crazing, as an accidental defect, and \\"crackle\\", when the same phenomenon, often strongly accentuated, is produced deliberately. The Chinese in particular enjoyed the random effects of crackle and whereas in Ru ware it seems to have been a tolerated feature of most pieces, but not sought, in Guan ware a strong crackle was a desired effect. ==Odontology== Crazing is also used as a term in odontology to describe fine cracks in the enamel of teeth. ==Metaphor== The root sense of “crazy” in English, meaning “to shatter, crush, or break,” dates to the 1300s. The metaphorical senses familiar today derive from crazing in pottery: “crazy” meaning “diseased or sickly” dates to about 1570; “of unsound mind,” to about 1610. ==ReferencesExternal links== *Understanding Crazing *Crazing in Single Ply Roofing: Causes, Restoration *Crazing Concrete Surfaces *Images of crazing via Google Images (look for the images of fine 'cracks') Category:Glass engineering and science Category:Roofs Category:Polymers Category:Pottery Category:Ceramic engineering Category:Ceramic glazes ","title":"Crazing"},{"id":"1997976","text":"Sir Kenneth Robinson (19 March 1911 – 16 February 1996) was a British Labour politician who served as Minister of Health in Harold Wilson's first government, from 1964 to 1968, when the position was merged into the new title of Secretary of State for Social Services. ==Early life== The son of Dr Clarence Robinson and a nurse, Ethel Marion Linell, Kenneth Robinson was born on 19 March 1911 in Warrington, north west England and was educated at Malsis School in North Yorkshire, before attending Oundle School up to the point of his father dying when he was just 15 years old. After his mother pulled him from the school on cost grounds he later worked as a writer, insurance broker and company secretary. He joined the Royal Navy during World War II as an ordinary seaman, was commissioned in 1942 and promoted to lieutenant-commander in 1944. He served on . Robinson's education was remarkable in that he received no further education after the age of 15 and was entirely self- taught. ==Political career== Robinson was a St Pancras borough councillor 1945–1949. He was elected to the House of Commons as Member of Parliament (MP) for St. Pancras North in a by-election in 1949. He was a government assistant whip from 1950 until 1951. He joined the cabinet and was made a Privy Counsellor in 1964. Reforms he oversaw include the banning on cigarette television advertising and the reintroduction of prescription charges. When his position of Minister of Health was abolished in 1968, Robinson was appointed Minister for Planning and Land, only for this position to be abolished a year later. Robinson left Parliament in 1970. Robinson was probably one of the UK's most respected Health Ministers. He was always willing to listen, and indeed took informal advice from his local GPs during difficult negotiations over the GP Charter in 1965. John Horder stated of Robinson's role as Minister of Health: \\"Kenneth brought to this crisis a mind that was well prepared and the calmness, consideration and personality which we all have known.\\" Robinson noticed problems with Britain's approach to General Practice Medicine, and quickly sought to reach agreement with practitioners and change the organization, funding, and nature of practice in the system. Robinson published the first consultative document on reorganisation and the need for administrative reform of the National Health System. One compromise he instituted was to reduce the number of hospital beds, under an argument of current under-utilization, and in agreement with the medical profession. In return, the government lifted the limits on fees that medical consultants could charge to patients. These actions helped to form the basis for the 1966 General Practitioner's Charter, which Robinson negotiated with Dr. James Cameron, the General Medical Services Committee chairman. Robinson also placed emphasis on nursing, appointing Sir Brian Salmon to a special committee of management experts and nurses, which looked into ways to advise and prepare senior staff at hospitals for their posts. ===Opposition to Scientology in 1960s=== Robinson had served as the first chairman of the National Association of Mental Health (now known as Mind). His interest in mental health issues brought him into conflict with the Church of Scientology, considered to hold controversial views on mental health: as Minister, he told the House of Commons that he was satisfied that \\"Scientology is socially harmful\\". Robinson stated that there was a \\"grave concern\\" among local government at the time about Scientology, and its potential effects on the town of East Grinstead. Robinson stated in 1968 in the House of Commons that Scientology was: \\"a pseudo-philosophical cult\\". Time Magazine also quoted Robinson as stating: that the Church of Scientology was: \\"socially harmful ... a potential menace to the personality\\" and \\"a serious danger to health.\\" In this speech, Robinson referred to the Anderson Report, cited additional evidence of why the group should be considered a cult, and stated that there was evidence children were being indoctrinated. Robinson announced that a series of measures would be undertaken against Scientology in Britain. In 1968, the Church of Scientology started publishing articles that were of defamatory nature toward Robinson. Eventually Robinson sued the Church of Scientology of California and L. Ron Hubbard for libel. The case appeared before Justice Ackner, and was entitled: Robinson v Church of Scientology of California and Others. This resulted in a settlement between the parties on June 1973, where the Church of Scientology acknowledged that there was no truth to the published allegations, and offered its apologies to Robinson along with a \\"substantial sum to mark the gravity of the libels\\". ===Support of reforms of laws=== Robinson supported reform of the laws governing suicide in England and Wales (which was a criminal offence at the time) and in 1958 tabled a motion in the House of Commons. Despite opposition from the Conservative Home Secretary of the day, Rab Butler, Robinson's motion attracted the support of over 150 fellow MP's within days. However, Robinson's views on the subject were much more in tune with the changing times and he was supported in his campaign by such diverse bodies as the Church of England, the Magistrates' Association and the British Medical Association. Even the respected Times newspaper ran an editorial in 1958 which proclaimed \\"Attempted suicide seems to have become punishable in England almost by accident,\\" when it noted suicide was not a criminal offence in Scotland. The law regarding suicide as a criminal offence in England and Wales was repealed in 1961 and Robinson's contribution to remove the stigma of suicide from the statute books cannot be overestimated.When Suicide Was Illegal, BBC News, 4 August 2011 He was also campaigner for homosexual law reform and a member of the Homosexual Law Reform Society's executive committee. In June 1960, he introduced the first full-scale Commons debate on the Wolfenden Report's proposals to end the law which criminalised consenting sex between men in private. He had also put forward a bill in 1961 to legalise abortion. His bill failed but Robinson was Minister of Health in 1967 when the Abortion Act 1967 came into force. In 1967, Robinson announced the British government's intentions to limit forms of promotional advertising for cigarettes, and cigarette-coupon schemes. Hilton described him as \\"a persistent Labour critic of the tobacco industry\\". Robinson helped to put forth the 1968 Health Services and Public Health Act, which made home help service for the elderly a mandate to the government, rather than a permissive duty. Robinson was supportive of voluntary hospitals and health services, and voiced his encouragement to these institutions in a speech to the National Association of Leagues of Hospital Friends. He later joined the SDP. ==Other roles== Robinson served as Chairman of English National Opera from 1972 to 1977, of the Greater London Council's London Transport Executive from 1975 to 1978, and of the Arts Council of Great Britain from 1977 to 1982. He was knighted in April 1983 for services to the Arts. Robinson died in London on 16 February 1996. ==Bibliography== Robinson wrote a biography of Wilkie Collins (1951), and a young person's guide to Parliament, Look At Parliament (1962). ==See also== *Mind (charity) * Scientology and psychiatry *Enquiry into the Practice and Effects of Scientology *Believe What You Like: What happened between the Scientologists and the National Association for Mental Health ==References== ;Further reading Category:1911 births Category:1996 deaths Category:Royal Navy officers Category:Labour Party (UK) MPs for English constituencies Category:People educated at Oundle School Category:British Secretaries of State Category:Members of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom Category:Knights Bachelor Category:Councillors in Greater London Category:UK MPs 1945–1950 Category:UK MPs 1950–1951 Category:UK MPs 1951–1955 Category:UK MPs 1955–1959 Category:UK MPs 1959–1964 Category:UK MPs 1964–1966 Category:UK MPs 1966–1970 Category:Critics of Scientology Category:People associated with transport in London Category:Place of birth missing Category:Place of death missing Category:Social Democratic Party (UK) politicians Category:People educated at Malsis School Category:Ministers in the Wilson governments, 1964–1970 ","title":"Kenneth Robinson"},{"id":"1997986","text":"Shari Thurer is a psychoanalytically trained psychologist practicing in Boston and an adjunct associate professor at Boston University. ==Select publications== She is the author of The Myths of Motherhood: How Culture Reinvents the Good Mother and The End of Gender: A Psychological Autopsy ==ReferencesExternal links== *Official site Category:American women psychologists Category:American non-fiction writers Category:Boston University faculty Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people ","title":"Shari Thurer"},{"id":"1997988","text":"Frank Gilchrist Rankin (April 1, 1891 – July 23, 1932) was a Canadian ice hockey player and coach.

Rankin coached the Toronto Granites to the gold medal for Canada at the 1924 Winter Olympics. ==Personal== Rankin was one of six children born to Mr. and Mrs. Joseph Rankin of Stratford, Ontario. He had four brothers: Gordon, Jimmy, Reginald and Sid and one sister. ==Hockey career== Rankin played junior hockey in his hometown of Stratford with the Stratford team in the Ontario Hockey Association from 1904 until 1910. His brother Jimmy also played with the team. He then moved to Toronto and played senior hockey with the Toronto Eatons. He played two seasons with the Eatons, scoring 21 goals in ten games. He then joined the senior Toronto St. Michael's Majors where he played in three seasons. In 1912, Rankin scored an incredible 20 goals in five games. In the 1914–15 season, while playing for St. Michael's, Rankin was seriously cut in the face and suffered blood poisoning, which required hospitalization. Rankin became coach of the Toronto Granites, leading them to the Allan Cup championship in 1922 and 1923. For winning the Cup in 1923, the Granites were selected to represent Canada at the 1924 Winter Olympics. The team won six consecutive games to take the gold medal.

On the more perfect cleavage, which is parallel to the basal plane (P), is a system of fine striations, parallel to the second cleavage (M). Crystal twinning occurs when two separate crystals share some of the same crystal lattice points in a symmetrical manner. The result is an intergrowth of two separate crystals in a variety of specific configurations. The surface along which the lattice points are shared in twinned crystals is called a composition surface or twin plane. Crystallographers classify twinned crystals by a number of twin laws. These twin laws are specific to the crystal system. The type of twinning can be a diagnostic tool in mineral identification. Twinning is an important mechanism for permanent shape changes in a crystal.Courtney, Thomas H. (2000) Mechanical Behavior of Materials, 2nd ed. McGraw Hill. Twinning can often be a problem in X-ray crystallography, as a twinned crystal does not produce a simple diffraction pattern. ==Twin laws== Twin laws are either defined by their twin planes (i.e. {hkl}) or the direction of the twin axes (i.e. [hkl]). If the twin law can be defined by a simple planar composition surface, the twin plane is always parallel to a possible crystal face and never parallel to an existing plane of symmetry (remember that twinning adds symmetry). If the twin law is a rotation axis, the composition surface will be irregular, the twin axis will be perpendicular to a lattice plane, but will never be an even-fold rotation axis of the existing symmetry. For example, twinning cannot occur on a new 2 fold axis that is parallel to an existing 4-fold axis.Nelson, Stephen A. (2013) Twinning, Polymorphism, Polytypism, Pseudomorphism. Tulane University ===Common twin laws=== In the isometric system, the most common types of twins are the Spinel Law (twin plane, parallel to an octahedron), [111] where the twin axis is perpendicular to an octahedral face, and the Iron Cross [001] which is the interpenetration of two pyritohedrons a subtype of dodecahedron. In the hexagonal system, calcite shows the contact twin laws {0001} and {0112}. Quartz shows the Brazil Law {1120}, and Dauphiné Law [0001] which are penetration twins caused by transformation and Japan Law {1122} which is often caused by accidents during growth. In the tetragonal system, cyclical contact twins are the most commonly observed type of twin, such as in rutile titanium dioxide and cassiterite tin oxide. In the orthorhombic system, crystals usually twin on planes parallel to the prism face, where the most common is a {110} twin which produces cyclical twins, such as in aragonite, chrysoberyl, and cerussite. In the monoclinic system, twin occur most often on the planes {100} and {001} by the Manebach Law {001}, Carlsbad Law [001], Braveno Law {021} in orthoclase, and the Swallow Tail Twins {001} in gypsum. In the triclinic system, the most commonly twinned crystals are the feldspar minerals plagioclase and microcline. These minerals show the Albite and Pericline Laws. ==Types of twinning== Quartz – Japan twin Pyrite iron cross twin Simple twinned crystals may be contact twins or penetration twins. Contact twins share a single composition surface often appearing as mirror images across the boundary. Plagioclase, quartz, gypsum, and spinel often exhibit contact twinning. Merohedral twinning occurs when the lattices of the contact twins superimpose in three dimensions, such as by relative rotation of one twin from the other. An example is metazeunerite. In penetration twins the individual crystals have the appearance of passing through each other in a symmetrical manner. Orthoclase, staurolite, pyrite, and fluorite often show penetration twinning. Galvanized surface with macroscopic crystalline features. Twin boundaries are visible as striations within each crystallite, most prominently in the bottom-left and top-right. If several twin crystal parts are aligned by the same twin law they are referred to as multiple or repeated twins. If these multiple twins are aligned in parallel they are called polysynthetic twins. When the multiple twins are not parallel they are cyclic twins. Albite, calcite, and pyrite often show polysynthetic twinning. Closely spaced polysynthetic twinning is often observed as striations or fine parallel lines on the crystal face. Rutile, aragonite, cerussite, and chrysoberyl often exhibit cyclic twinning, typically in a radiating pattern. But in general, based on the relationship between the twin axis and twin plane, there are 3 types of twinning: :1-parallel twinning, when the twin axis and compositional plane lie parallel to each other, :2-normal twinning, when the twin plane and compositional plane lie normally, and :3-complex twinning, a combination of parallel twinning and normal twinning on one compositional plane. ==Modes of formation== There are three modes of formation of twinned crystals. Growth twins are the result of an interruption or change in the lattice during formation or growth due to a possible deformation from a larger substituting ion. Annealing or transformation twins are the result of a change in crystal system during cooling as one form becomes unstable and the crystal structure must re-organize or transform into another more stable form. Deformation or gliding twins are the result of stress on the crystal after the crystal has formed. If a metal with face-centered cubic (fcc) structure, like Al, Cu, Ag, Au, etc., is subjected to stress, it will experience twinning. The formation and migration of twin boundaries is partly responsible for ductility and malleability of fcc metals. Deformation twinning is a common result of regional metamorphism. Crystal twinning is also used as an indicator of force direction in mountain building processes in orogeny research. Crystals that grow adjacent to each other may be aligned to resemble twinning. This parallel growth simply reduces system energy and is not twinning. ===Mechanisms of formation=== Twinning can occur by cooperative displacement of atoms along the face of the twin boundary. This displacement of a large quantity of atoms simultaneously requires significant energy to perform. Therefore, the theoretical stress required to form a twin is quite high. It is believed that twinning is associated with dislocation motion on a coordinated scale, in contrast to slip, which is caused by independent glide at several locations in the crystal. Twinning and slip are competitive mechanisms for crystal deformation. Each mechanism is dominant in certain crystal systems and under certain conditions. In fcc metals, slip is almost always dominant because the stress required is far less than twinning stress. Compared to slip, twinning produces a deformation pattern that is more heterogeneous in nature. This deformation produces a local gradient across the material and near intersections between twins and grain boundaries. The deformation gradient can lead to fracture along the boundaries, particularly in bcc transition metals at low temperatures. ===Deposition of twins=== The conditions of crystal formation in solution have an effect on the type and density of dislocations in the crystal. It frequently happens that the crystal is oriented so that there will a more rapid deposition of material on one part than on another; for instance, if the crystal be attached to some other solid it cannot grow in that direction. If the crystal is freely suspended in the solution and material for growth is supplied at the same rate on all sides does an equably developed form result. ==Twin boundaries== Fivefold twinning in a gold nanoparticle (electron micrograph). Twin boundaries occur when two crystals of the same type intergrow so that only a slight misorientation exists between them. It is a highly symmetrical interface, often with one crystal the mirror image of the other; also, atoms are shared by the two crystals at regular intervals. This is also a much lower-energy interface than the grain boundaries that form when crystals of arbitrary orientation grow together. Twin boundaries may also display a higher degree of symmetry than the single crystal. These twins are called mimetic or pseudo-symmetric twins. Twin boundaries are partly responsible for shock hardening and for many of the changes that occur in cold work of metals with limited slip systems or at very low temperatures. They also occur due to martensitic transformations: the motion of twin boundaries is responsible for the pseudoelastic and shape- memory behavior of nitinol, and their presence is partly responsible for the hardness due to quenching of steel. In certain types of high strength steels, very fine deformation twins act as primary obstacles against dislocation motion. These steels are referred to as 'TWIP' steels, where TWIP stands for twinning-induced plasticity.. ===Appearance in different structures=== Of the three common crystalline structures bcc, fcc, and hcp, the hcp structure is the most likely to form deformation twins when strained, because they rarely have a sufficient number of slip systems for an arbitrary shape change. High strain rates, low stacking-fault energy and low temperatures facilitate deformation twinning. ==See also== * Macle * Tin cry * Icosahedral twins ==ReferencesFurther reading== * Hurlbut, Cornelius S.; Klein, Cornelis, 1985, Manual of Mineralogy, 20th ed., ==External links== *Slip and twinning mechanism in detail *Mineral galleries – twins *Mathematical and Theoretical Crystallography *Quartz Crystals – Twinning *Grain Boundary Twinning Category:Crystallography Category:Materials science ","title":"Crystal twinning"},{"id":"1997991","text":"Surfside (or Surfside Colony) is a small gated community with three rows of houses, lettered A, B, and C. Surfside is part of the city of Seal Beach, California and is located on the west side of Pacific Coast Highway, southwest of the Naval Weapons Station Seal Beach between the station and the Huntington Beach community of Sunset Beach. It is also near the Huntington Beach community of Huntington Harbour. The southern entrance to the Surfside Colony is easy to spot by the water tower (which was built into a house) that can be seen from Pacific Coast Highway. The Surfside Colony is served by the Surfside Colony Community Services Tax District and the Surfside Colony Storm Water Protection Tax District. Lifeguard services are provided by the city of Seal Beach.City of Seal Beach Lifeguard Web Site ==History== Surfside Colony was begun in 1929 as an oceanside resort community. It was incorporated with the state of California in 1930. There were originally plans to develop both sides of Pacific Coast Highway (with D and E rows of houses on the east side), but these plans never materialized. A tunnel, which still exists though it is inaccessible, was built under Pacific Coast Highway to facilitate easy transit back and forth.Blake, Virginia Abel, Darla Austin Funk, and Donna Metzger Kettler, Surfside Colony, History - Legend - Lore, Surfside, CA: 2006. During World War II, the U.S. Navy developed the area to the north of Surfside as an ammunition depot. A large jetty and channel were built to allow ships to dock. This development altered Surfside and its beachfront significantly. Changes in wave patterns and resulting erosion have continued to plague the community since then. Every few years, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers must work to replenish and rebuild the beach, dredging and refilling with millions of cubic yards of sand. On July 4, 2008, a small plane pulling an advertising banner lost power and was forced to land in the water just off the shore of Surfside. The pilot suffered only minor injuries, and no one in the water was injured. Looking NW toward Long Beach ==Geography and climate== The colony of Surfside is located adjacent to the Pacific Ocean beach. It is said that no home in the colony is more than from the sand. Also visible from Surfside is a portion of Anaheim Bay, which is across Pacific Coast Highway and connects to Huntington Harbour. The climate of Surfside is moderate with temperatures often hovering around . The record high for this area has been reported at , with the record low at .The Weather Channel, May 16, 2007. It is not unusual to have cool evenings with temperatures in the 50s during the summer and the low 40s in winter. There is often a brisk wind at Surfside, making it a favorite spot for kite surfers. Over the years, the winter surf has sometimes been severe, destroying homes in the colony. Especially severe storms and high tides wreaked havoc in 1952 and 1953, and again in 1963. Into the 1970s and 1980s, erosion posed problems for the community. Rock barriers, sand bags, and temporary berms have all been used to safeguard homes. In 1983, high tides flooded many of the residences in Surfside. ==Demographics & Housing== According to 2010 census data, there were 456 residents of Surfside living in 187 housing units. The area of the colony is 0.1 square miles. The median age was listed as 45.3, and 89.5 percent of the population was white. Surfside has approximately 256 houses. 25% are occupied seasonally or less than full-time. Some homes have been in families for as many as four generations. The colony has a wide variety of housing styles, which contributes to its charming and laid-back ambiance. Current housing styles include everything from small beach cottages to large three-story mansions. Many of the homes are rented out by their owners. The first homes in Surfside were small beach cottages. In 1929, these homes sold for as little as $700. In general, \\"A\\" Row houses are the most highly priced as they have unobstructed views of the Pacific Ocean extending all the way to Santa Catalina Island and sit directly on the beach. ==Education== The Los Alamitos Unified School District serves Surfside.\\"District Attendance Boundaries .\\" Los Alamitos Unified School District. Retrieved on September 28, 2012. ==Miscellanea== The U.S. Postal Service does not deliver mail to the houses in Surfside. However, there is a full-service post office inside of the colony. Each house has a post office box there. Surfside consists of three rows of houses, called the A, B, and C rows. The A row is on the sand; the C row is adjacent Pacific Coast Highway. There is a short road entering the colony from Pacific Coast Highway called Phillips Street. House addresses are designated by a letter and a number. For example, \\"1 A\\" is the first house on the sand at the southern end of the colony. This sometimes creates a confusion when a physical street address is required. The U.S. Postal Service lists their address within the colony as 89 B Surfside Avenue. A and B row homes have a Surfside Avenue address. C row homes have a Pacific Avenue address. Pacific is the street that runs from the southeast exit of the colony through neighboring Sunset Beach. ==Notable natives and residents== Bradley Nowell lived in this gated community while being a successful lead singer for the reggae rock and punk band Sublime.

It is a continuation of his autobiography describing his childhood, Boy and detailed his travel to Africa and exploits as a World War II pilot. == Plot == The book started with Dahl's voyage to Africa in 1938, which was prompted by his desire to find adventure after finishing school. He was on a boat heading towards Dar es Salaam for his new job working for Shell Oil. During this journey, he met various peoplehttps://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2011/dec/01/going-solo- roald-dahl-review and described extraordinary events such as a lion carrying a woman in its mouth. He eventually joined the war as a squadron pilot in the Royal Air Force, flying the Tiger Moth, Gloster Gladiator, and Hawker Hurricane. He was among the last Allied pilots to withdraw from Greece during the German invasion, taking part in the air for the Battle of Athens on 20 April 1941. In one of his accounts, he described a crash in the Western Desert, which fractured his skull and brought him several other problems such as temporarily being blinded during his days in Greece. After the country fell to the Nazis, he went to the Middle East to fight Vichy French pilots after staying for a brief time in Alexandria, Egypt. In Storyteller: The Authorized Biography of Roald Dahl (2010), Donald Sturrock claimed that there are disparities to the author's claims in the book, describing them as flights of pure fancy or compelling recreations of stories heard from others such as the accounts about exotic African animal adventures. There was also the case of his encounter with a group of Germans, which he had orders to round up. Dahl wrote in Going Solo that its leader was killed by an African guard after thrusting a Luger pistol in his chest. In Lucky Break (1977), a story published 10 years prior, the version of this story was less dramatic with the Germans quickly giving themselves up, allowing Dahl's group to march themselves to a camp in Dar es Salaam without much difficulty. ==References== Category:1986 non-fiction books Category:Military memoirs Category:Books by Roald Dahl Category:Jonathan Cape books Category:British autobiographies ","title":"Going Solo"},{"id":"1997997","text":"{| |} SSV Robert C.

He is an honoured member of the Hockey Hall of Fame. ==Early life== Rayner was born August 11, 1920, in Sutherland, Saskatchewan. ==Playing career== Playing his junior career for the Kenora Thistles of the Manitoba junior league, Rayner showed his skill early, backstopping the team to the Abbott Cup to advance to the Memorial Cup championship in 1940. The next season, he turned professional for the Americans, spending most of the year with the Amerks' minor league affiliate, the Springfield Indians of the AHL. With the Indians, Rayner led the league in shutouts and goals against average and was named to the Second All-Star Team. The following season Rayner was the leading goalie for the Americans' final season before the team folded. World War II interrupted Rayner's career, however, and he spent the next three years in the Royal Canadian Navy, where he played two seasons for naval teams based out of Victoria. After the war, he signed as a free agent in 1945 with the Rangers. Rayner was the starting goaltender for New York six of the next seven seasons, earning accolades for his play even though the Rangers' teams of the era were weak, and Rayner never had a winning record. He was noted as a puckhandling goalie, attempting several times throughout his career to score a goal. Even though he played on poor teams throughout his career, \\"Bonnie Prince Charlie\\" was one of the best goalies of his era. The three years between 1948 and 1951 were his best, and he won the Hart Trophy as the NHL's most valuable player in 1950, after leading the Rangers to overtime in the seventh game of the Stanley Cup finals. ==Post-NHL career== In 1953, Rayner suffered a knee injury and lost his job as Rangers' starter to Gump Worsley. He played one more season in the minors for the Saskatoon Quakers of the Western Hockey League and a couple of brief stints in the senior leagues the two seasons thereafter before hanging up his skates for good. He was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1973, the second goaltender in history to be inducted with a losing record.

First published in 1944 by Farrar & Rinehart, it deals with the social and political upheavals that took place in England during the rise of the market economy. Polanyi contends that the modern market economy and the modern nation-state should be understood not as discrete elements but as the single human invention he calls the \\"Market Society\\". A distinguishing characteristic of the \\"Market Society\\" is that humanity's economic mentalities have been changed. Prior to the great transformation, people based their economies on reciprocity and redistribution across personal and communal relationships.Polanyi, The Great Transformation, ch. 4 As a consequence of industrialization and increasing state influence, competitive markets were created that undermined these previous social tendencies, replacing them with formal institutions that aimed to promote a self-regulating market economy.Polanyi, The Great Transformation, ch. 4 The expansion of capitalist institutions with an economically liberal mindset not only changed laws but also fundamentally altered humankind's economic relations; prior to the great transformation, markets played a very minor role in human affairs and were not even capable of setting prices because of their diminutive size.Polanyi, The Great Transformation, ch. 2,3 It was only after industrialization and the onset of greater state control over newly created market institutions that the myth of human nature's propensity toward rational free trade became widespread.Polanyi, The Great Transformation, ch. 3,4 & 15 However, Polanyi asserts instead that \\"man's economy, as a rule, is submerged in his social relationships,\\" Polanyi, The Great Transformation, p. 48 and he therefore proposes an alternative ethnographic economic approach called \\"substantivism\\", in opposition to \\"formalism\\", both terms coined by Polanyi. == General argument == Polanyi argued that the development of the modern state went hand in hand with the development of modern market economies and that these two changes were inextricably linked in history. Essential to the change from a premodern economy to a market economy was the altering of human economic mentalities away from their grounding in local social relationships and institutions, and into transactions idealized as \\"rational\\" and set apart from their previous social context.Polanyi, The Great Transformation, ch. 4 Prior to the great transformation, markets had a very limited role in society and were confined almost entirely to long distance trade.Polanyi, The Great Transformation, p. 56 As Polanyi wrote, \\"the same bias which made Adam Smith's generation view primeval man as bent on barter and truck induced their successors to disavow all interest in early man, as he was now known not to have indulged in those laudable passions.\\"Polanyi, The Great Transformation, p. 45 The great transformation was begun by the powerful modern state, which was needed to push changes in social structure, and in what aspects of human nature were amplified and encouraged, which allowed for a competitive capitalist economy to emerge. For Polanyi, these changes implied the destruction of the basic social order that had reigned throughout pre-modern history. Central to the change was that factors of production, such as land and labor, would now be sold on the market at market-determined prices instead of allocated according to tradition, redistribution, or reciprocity.Polanyi, The Great Transformation, p. 41 He emphasized the greatness of the transformation because it was both a change of human institutions and human nature. His empirical case in large part relied upon analysis of the Speenhamland laws, which he saw not only as the last attempt of the squirearchy to preserve the traditional system of production and social order but also a self-defensive measure on the part of society that mitigated the disruption of the most violent period of economic change. Polanyi also remarks that the pre-modern economies of China, the Incan Empire, the Indian Empires, Babylon, Greece, and the various kingdoms of Africa operated on principles of reciprocity and redistribution with a very limited role for markets, especially in settling prices or allocating the factors of production.Polanyi, The Great Transformation, pp. 52-53 The book also presented his belief that market society is unsustainable because it is fatally destructive to human nature and the natural contexts it inhabits. Polanyi attempted to turn the tables on the orthodox liberal account of the rise of capitalism by arguing that “laissez-faire was planned”, whereas social protectionism was a spontaneous reaction to the social dislocation imposed by an unrestrained free market. He argues that the construction of a \\"self-regulating\\" market necessitates the separation of society into economic and political realms. Polanyi does not deny that the self-regulating market has brought \\"unheard of material wealth\\", but he suggests that this is too narrow a focus. The market, once it considers land, labor and money as fictitious commodities, and including them \\"means to subordinate the substance of society itself to the laws of the market.\\"Polanyi, The Great Transformation, p. 71 (see also the entirety of Chapter 6). This, he argues, results in massive social dislocation, and spontaneous moves by society to protect itself. In effect, Polanyi argues that once the free market attempts to separate itself from the fabric of society, social protectionism is society's natural response, which he calls the \\"double movement.\\" Polanyi did not see economics as a subject closed off from other fields of enquiry, indeed he saw economic and social problems as inherently linked. He ended his work with a prediction of a socialist society, noting, \\"after a century of blind 'improvement', man is restoring his 'habitation.'\\"Polanyi, The Great Transformation, p. 257 == Before the market society == Based on Bronislaw Malinowski's ethnological work on the Kula ring exchange in the Trobriand Islands, Polanyi makes the distinction between markets as an auxiliary tool for ease of exchange of goods and market societies. Market societies are those where markets are the paramount institution for the exchange of goods through price mechanisms. Polanyi argues that there are three general types of economic systems that existed before the rise of a society based on a free market economy: redistributive, reciprocity and householding. # Redistributive: trade and production is focused to a central entity such as a tribal leader or feudal lord and then redistributed to members of their society. # Reciprocity: exchange of goods is based on reciprocal exchanges between social entities. On a macro level, this would include the production of goods to gift to other groups. # Householding: economies where production is centered on individual households. Family units produce food, textile goods, and tools for their own use and consumption. These three forms were not mutually exclusive, nor were they mutually exclusive of markets for the exchange of goods. The main distinction is that these three forms of economic organization were based around the social aspects of the society they operated in and were explicitly tied to do those social relationships. Polanyi argued that these economic forms depended on the social principles of centricity, symmetry, and autarky (self-sufficiency). Markets existed as an auxiliary avenue for the exchange of goods that were otherwise not obtainable. == Support == The sociologists Fred L. Block and Margaret Somers argue that Polanyi's analysis could help explain why the resurgence of free market ideas has resulted in \\"such manifest failures as persistent unemployment, widening inequality, and the severe financial crises that have stressed Western economies over the past forty years.\\" They suggest that \\"the ideology that free markets can replace government is just as utopian and dangerous\\" as the idea that Communism will result in the withering away of the state.Fred Block and Margaret R. Somers. The Power of Market Fundamentalism: Karl Polanyi's Critique. Harvard University Press, 2014. In Towards an Anthropological Theory of Value: The False Coin of Our Own Dreams, anthropologist David Graeber offers compliments to Polanyi's text and theories. Graeber attacks formalists and substantivists alike, \\"those who start by looking at society as a whole are left, like the Substantivists, trying to explain how people are motivated to reproduce society; those who start by looking at individual desires, like the formalists, unable to explain why people chose to maximize some things and not others (or otherwise to account for questions of meaning).\\"Graeber, Towards an Anthropological Theory of Value, pg.12 While appreciative of Polanyi's attack on formalism, Graeber attempts to move beyond ethnography and towards understanding how individuals find meaning in their actions, synthesizing insights of Marcel Mauss, Karl Marx, and others. In parallel with Polanyi's account of markets being made internal to society as a result of state intervention, Graeber argues the transition to credit-based markets from societies with separated \\"spheres of exchange\\" in gift giving was likely the accidental byproduct of state or temple bureaucracy (temple in the case of Sumer).Graeber, Debt: The First 5000 Years, pg 248 Graeber also notes that the criminalization of debt supplemented the enclosure movements in the destruction of English communities, since credit between community members had originally reinforced communal ties prior to state intervention: > The criminalization of debt, then, was the criminalization of the very basis > of human society. It cannot be overemphasized that in a small community, > everyone normally was both lender and borrower. One can only imagine the > tensions and temptations that must have existed in a community—and > communities, much though they are based on love, in fact, because they are > based on love, will always also be full of hatred, rivalry and passion—when > it became clear that with sufficiently clever scheming, manipulation, and > perhaps a bit of strategic bribery, they could arrange to have almost anyone > they hated imprisoned or even hanged.Graeber Debt: The First 5000 Years, pg > 335 Economist Joseph Stiglitz favors Polanyi's account of market liberalization, arguing that the failures of \\"Shock Therapy\\" in Russia and the failures of IMF reform packages echo Polanyi's arguments. Stiglitz also summarizes the difficulties of \\"market liberalization\\" in that it requires unrealistic \\"flexibility\\" amongst the poor.Polanyi, K. (2001). The Great Transformation: The Political and Economic Origins of Our Time, 2nd ed. Foreword by Joseph E. Stiglitz; pg.vii-xvii ==Criticism== Rutger Bregman, writing for Jacobin, criticized Polanyi's account of the Speenhamland system as reliant on several myths (increased poverty, increased population growth and increased unrest, as well as \\"'the pauperization of the masses,' who 'almost lost their human shape';\\" \\"basic income did not introduce a floor, he contended, but a ceiling\\") and the flawed Royal Commission into the Operation of the Poor Laws 1832. Both Bregman and Corey Robin credited Polanyi's view with Richard Nixon moving away from a proposed basic income system because Polanyi was heavily quoted in a report by Nixon's aide, Martin Anderson and then ultimately provided arguments for various reductions in the welfare state introduced by Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush.. Economic historians (e.g. Nobel prize Douglass North) have criticized Polanyi's account of the origins of capitalism. Polanyi's account of reciprocity and redistributive systems is inherently changeless and thus cannot explain the emergence of the more specific form of modern capitalism in the 19th century. ==Contents== * Part One The International System ** Chapter 1.

The interests, structure, and influence of NSAs vary widely. For example, among NSAs are corporations, media organizations, business magnates, people's liberation movements, lobby groups, religious groups, aid agencies, and violent non-state actors such as paramilitary forces. ==Types == Some common and influential classes of NSAs are listed here in alphabetical order: * Business magnates are individuals who command large wealth, and who often seek to influence national and international affairs. Examples are Warren Buffett and Bill Gates. * Corporations, which include multinational corporations (MNCs), are companies authorized to act as single entities (legally as persons) and are recognized as such in law. They include very large businesses operating transnationally, such as The Coca-Cola Company, McDonald's, General Motors, Adidas, Huawei, Renault, Samsung, Nestlé and Toyota. * Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO)s, sometimes known as decentralized autonomous corporations (DACs), operate according to rules encoded as computer programs called smart contracts.The Decentralized Autonomous Organization and Governance Issues. Regulation of Financial Institutions Journal: Social Science Research Network (SSRN). 5 December 2017. The crypto-currency Bitcoin is an example of a DAO which, as of 2018, has grown to become economically influential. * International media agencies, which are also usually corporations, report on the social and political situation in countries worldwide, and may therefore be highly influential as NSAs. Examples of such agencies are AFP, EFE, Reuters, AP, RIA Novosti and Xinhua. * Non-governmental organizations (NGOs), which include international non-governmental organizations (INGOs), are usually nonprofit organizations seeking to effect change in humanitarian, educational, ecological, healthcare, public policy, social, human rights, environmental, and other areas. Examples of NGOs are Greenpeace, Red Cross/Red Crescent, Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and WWF. Goodwill ambassadors or humanitarian aid workers involved with INGO missions abroad may also be considered as non-state actors. * People's movements are mass movements which become influential with size and longevity. Examples include the movements arising during the Arab Spring of 2011. * Religious groups commonly engage in political affairs at an international level. For example, the Quakers, as a historic peace church, operate offices at the United Nations.Rochester, Martin J. Between Two Epochs: What’s Ahead for America, the World, and Global Politics in the Twenty-First Century. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall, 2002. Another example is the Taliban, which is a religious group as well as a violent non-state actor. * Transnational diaspora communities are ethnic or national communities that commonly seek to bring social and political change to their originating countries and their adoptive countries. The Israeli diaspora is an example. * Unincorporated associations, secret societies and civic organizations unknown to or unrecognized by the state or government may be considered non-state actors. * Unrepresented nations and peoples include many indigenous peoples and Fourth World societies. * Violent non-state actors (VNSA)s are armed groups, including groups such as ISIS or criminal organizations, for example drug cartels. * World citizens may be considered non-state actors if they are active in movements or social causes active outside their own country. ==Effects on the Westphalian state model== The proliferation of non-state actors in the post–Cold War era has been one of the factors leading to the Cobweb Paradigm in international politics. Under this paradigm, the traditional Westphalian nation-state experiences an erosion of power and sovereignty, and non-state actors are part of the cause. Facilitated by globalization, NSAs challenge nation-state borders and sovereignty claims. MNCs are not always sympathetic to national interests, but instead are loyal to the corporation's interests. NSAs challenge the nation-state's sovereignty over internal matters through advocacy for societal issues, e.g. human rights and the environment. Armed non-state actors operate without state control and are involved in internal and trans-border conflicts. The activity of such groups in armed conflicts adds layers of complexity to traditional conflict management and resolution. These conflicts are often fought not only between non-state actors and states, but also between multiple NSA groups. Interventions in such conflicts is particularly challenging given the fact that international law and norms governing the use of force for intervention or peacekeeping purposes was primarily written in the context of the nation- state. ==Example: Cotonou Agreement== The term Non State Actors is widely used in development cooperation, particularly under the Cotonou Agreement between the European Union (EU) and African, Caribbean and Pacific ACP countries. The agreement uses the term to refer to a wide range of nongovernmental development actors whose participation in ACP-EU development cooperation is now formally recognized. According to Article 6, non-state actors include: * civil society in all its diversity, according to national characteristics; * economic and social partners, including trade union organisations and; * the private sector. In practice, it means that participation is open to all kind of actors, such as community-based organisations, women's groups, human rights associations, non-governmental organisations (NGOs), religious organizations, farmers' cooperatives, trade unions, universities and research institutes, the media and the private sector. Also included in this definition are informal groups such as grassroots organizations, informal private sector associations, etc. The private sector, however, is considered only insofar as it is involved in non-profit activities (e.g. private sector associations, chambers of commerce, etc.) ==Roles== Non-state actors can aid in opinion building in international affairs, such as the Human Rights Council. Formal international organizations may also rely on non-state actors, particularly NGOs in the form of implementing partners in the national context. An example is the contribution of COHRE (Centre on Housing Rights and Evictions), to the protection of land and property (HLP) rights in Kosovo by conceptualizing the Housing and Property Directorate (now Kosovo Property Agency) within the framework of the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo.K. Hassine, Regularizing Property Rights in Kosovo and Elsewhere, 2010, Non- state actors are fundamental agents in helping to achieve both national and international development goals, such as those around climate change. Actions by non-state actors contribute significantly towards filling the greenhouse gas emissions gap left by unambitious or poorly executed national climate policies, Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs). Another example that shows the importance of non-state actors in peace-building is the contribution of ICBL (International Campaign to Ban Landmines) to the international prohibition on the use of landmines. ICBL is a global network of NGOs that has operated in over 90 countries since 1992. Its primary goal is to make a world free of anti-personnel landmines. Their passionate advertising appealing for global cooperation drew Diana, Princess of Wales to become an ardent advocate. Together, they brought the issue to the United Nations General Assembly. ICBL's efforts led the international community to urge states to ratify the Ottawa Treaty (Mine Ban Treaty) in 1997, and its contribution was recognized and praised as it was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in the same year. ==See also== * Civil society * Transnationalism * Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization * Violent non-state actor ==ReferencesFurther reading== * Chickering, Lawrence A., et al.

If the correspondence is actually a function, it is referred to as the Hicksian demand function, or compensated demand function. The function is named after John Hicks. Mathematically, :h(p, \\\\bar{u}) = \\\\arg \\\\min_x \\\\sum_i p_i x_i :{\\\\rm subject~to} \\\\ \\\\ u(x) \\\\geq \\\\bar{u} . where h(p,u) is the Hicksian demand function, or commodity bundle demanded, at price vector p and utility level \\\\bar{u}. Here p is a vector of prices, and x is a vector of quantities demanded so that the sum of all pixi, is the total expense on goods x. ==Relationship to other functions== Hicksian demand functions are often convenient for mathematical manipulation because they do not require income or wealth to be represented. Additionally, the function to be minimized is linear in the x_i, which gives a simpler optimization problem. However, Marshallian demand functions of the form x(p, w) that describe demand given prices p and income w are easier to observe directly. The two are trivially related by :h(p, u) = x(p, e(p, u)), \\\\ where e(p, u) is the expenditure function (the function that gives the minimum wealth required to get to a given utility level), and by :h(p, v(p, w)) = x(p, w), \\\\ where v(p, w) is the indirect utility function (which gives the utility level of having a given wealth under a fixed price regime). Their derivatives are more fundamentally related by the Slutsky equation. Whereas Marshallian demand comes from the Utility Maximization Problem, Hicksian Demand comes from the Expenditure Minimization Problem. The two problems are mathematical duals, and hence the Duality Theorem provides a method of proving the relationships described above. The Hicksian demand function is intimately related to the expenditure function. If the consumer's utility function u(x) is locally nonsatiated and strictly convex, then h(p, u) = abla_p e(p, u). ==Hicksian demand and compensated price changes== Downward sloping Marshallian demand curves show the effect of price changes on quantity demanded. As the price of a good rises, presumably the quantity of that good demanded will fall, holding wealth and other prices constant. However, this effect of price changes on quantities demanded is due to both the income effect and the substitution effect. The substitution effect is a change in quantity demanded due to a price change that alters the slope of the budget constraint but leaves the consumer on the same indifference curve (i.e., at the same level of utility.) By this effect, the consumer is posited to substitute toward the good that becomes comparatively less expensive. If the good in question is a normal good, then the income effect from the rise in purchasing power from a price fall reinforces the substitution effect. If the good is an inferior good, then the income effect will offset in some degree the substitution effect. The Hicksian demand function is also downward sloping, but isolates the substitution effect by supposing the consumer is compensated exactly enough to purchase some bundle on the same indifference curve. Hicksian demand illustrates the consumer's new consumption basket after the price change while being compensated as to allow the consumer to be as happy as previously (to stay at the same level of utility). If the Hicksian demand function is \\"steeper\\" than Marshallian demand, the good is a normal good; otherwise, the good is inferior. ==Mathematical properties== If the consumer's utility function u(x) is continuous and represents a locally nonsatiated preference relation, then the Hicksian demand correspondence h(p,u) satisfies the following properties: i. Homogeneity of degree zero in p: For all a>0 , h(ap,u)=h(p,u). This is because the same x that minimizes \\\\sum_i p_i x_i also minimizes \\\\sum_i ap_i x_i subject to the same constraint. ii. No excess demand: The constraint u(hx) \\\\geq \\\\bar{u} holds with strict equality, u(x) = \\\\bar{u} . This follows from continuity of the utility function. Informally, they could simply spend less until utility was exactly \\\\bar{u} . ==See also== * Marshallian demand function * Convex preferences * Expenditure minimization problem * Slutsky equation ==References== * Category:Demand ","title":"Hicksian demand function"},{"id":"1998027","text":"An environmental hazard is a substance, state or event which has the potential to threaten the surrounding natural environment / or adversely affect people's health, including pollution and natural disasters such as storms and earthquakes. Any single or combination of toxic chemical, biological, or physical agents in the environment, resulting from human activities or natural processes, that may impact the health of exposed subjects, including pollutants such as heavy metals, pesticides, biological contaminants, toxic waste, industrial and home chemicals. quoted from Code of Maryland, January 1, 2014 Human-made hazards while not immediately health-threatening may turn out detrimental to man's well-being eventually, because deterioration in the environment can produce secondary, unwanted negative effects on the human ecosphere. The effects of water pollution may not be immediately visible because of a sewage system that helps drain off toxic substances. If those substances turn out to be persistent (e.g. persistent organic pollutant), however, they will literally be fed back to their producers via the food chain: plankton -> edible fish -> humans. In that respect, a considerable number of environmental hazards listed below are man-made (anthropogenic) hazards. Hazards can be categorized in four types: # Chemical # Physical (mechanical, etc.) # Biologicalinternational pictogram for environmental hazard. # Psychosocial. ==Chemical== Chemical hazards are defined in the Globally Harmonized System and in the European Union chemical regulations. They are caused by chemical substances causing significant damage to the environment. The label is particularly applicable towards substances with aquatic toxicity. An example is zinc oxide, a common paint pigment, which is extremely toxic to aquatic life. Toxicity or other hazards do not imply an environmental hazard, because elimination by sunlight (photolysis), water (hydrolysis) or organisms (biological elimination) neutralizes many reactive or poisonous substances. Persistence towards these elimination mechanisms combined with toxicity gives the substance the ability to do damage in the long term. Also, the lack of immediate human toxicity does not mean the substance is environmentally nonhazardous. For example, tanker truck-sized spills of substances such as milk can cause a lot of damage in the local aquatic ecosystems: the added biological oxygen demand causes rapid eutrophication, leading to anoxic conditions in the water body. All hazards in this category are mainly anthropogenic although there exist a number of natural carcinogens and chemical elements like radon and lead may turn up in health-critical concentrations in the natural environment: *Anthrax *Antibiotic agents in animals destined for human consumption *Arsenic - a contaminant of fresh water sources (water wells) *Asbestos - carcinogenic *DDT *Carcinogens *dioxins *Endocrine disruptors *Explosive material *Fungicides *Furans *Haloalkanes *Heavy metals *Herbicides *Hormones in animals destined for human consumption *Lead in paint *Marine debris *mercury *Mutagens *Pesticides *Polychlorinated biphenyls *Radon and other natural sources of radioactivity *Soil pollution *Tobacco smoking *Toxic waste *Radon ==Physical== A physical hazard is a type of occupational hazard that involves environmental hazards that can cause harm with or without contact. *Cosmic rays *Drought *Earthquake *Electromagnetic fields *E-waste *Floods *Fog *Light pollution *Lighting *Lightning *Noise pollution *Quicksand *Ultraviolet light *vibration *X-rays ==Biological== Biological hazards, also known as biohazards, refer to biological substances that pose a threat to the health of living organisms, primarily that of humans. This can include medical waste or samples of a microorganism, virus or toxin (from a biological source) that can affect human health. *Allergies *Arbovirus *Avian influenza *Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) *Cholera *Ebola *Epidemics *Food poisoning *Malaria *Molds *Onchocerciasis (river blindness) *Pandemics *Pathogens *Pollen for allergic people *Rabies *Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) *Sick building syndrome == Psychosocial Hazards == Psychosocial hazards include but aren't limited to stress, violence and other workplace stressors.

As a young man he worked with products like Jell-O, which was sold in his father's general store in Hendley. When Perkins came to Hastings at age thirty-one in 1920, his principal interests were patent medicines and household products. With that background, he began producing a line of over 125 \\"Onor-Maid\\" items which were sold door-to-door and by mail. One of the most popular was \\"Fruit-Smack\\", a fruit-flavored liquid concentrate. By 1927 he had developed a powdered soft drink mix called Kool-Ade, which he packaged in envelopes and sold in grocery stores, promising 10 glasses of beverage for 10 cents. Demand for this product was so great that it soon had international sales. Before long, the Perkins Products Company was focusing entirely on Kool-Ade, and in 1931 Mr. Perkins relocated to Chicago. By 1934 the name was changed to Kool-Aid. The company was sold to General Foods in 1953. Kool-Aid went on to become a household name and made Edwin Perkins a wealthy man. But the Perkins family remembered its Nebraska roots, donating generously to philanthropies in Adams County and elsewhere in the state. Among local gifts were Perkins Recital Hall and Perkins Library at Hastings College and Perkins Pavilion at Good Samaritan Village.

Richardson played hockey for Queen's University and the 14th Regiment of Kingston, and was considered one of the finest amateurs of his time. He is enshrined in the Hockey Hall of Fame, and is the namesake of the George Richardson Memorial Trophy. Richardson was part of a prominent business family that owned and operated a grain processing business in Kingston, Ontario. He joined the Canadian Expeditionary Forces in World War I, and died in action in Belgium. ==Personal life== Richardson was born and raised in Kingston, and graduated from Queen's with a bachelor of science degree in 1906. He was part of the prominent local Richardson family. His grandfather, James Richardson was the founder of James Richardson & Sons. His uncle, Henry Westman Richardson, was a businessman and a Canadian senator. His sister, Agnes was the benefactor of the Agnes Etherington Art Centre. His brother, James Armstrong Richardson Sr. was a businessman, aviator, and chancellor of Queen's University. His niece, Agnes Benidickson was the first female chancellor of Queen's University. His nephews, James Armstrong Richardson was Manitoba businessman, and Canadian federal cabinet minister; and George Taylor Richardson was a Manitoba businessman, and Order of Manitoba recipient. ==Playing career== George Richardson and the Queen's University Golden Gaels with the 1906 Intercollegiate championship trophy. Richardson played for the Queen's University Golden Gaels from 1903 to 1906, when the team won the Intercollegiate Hockey Union in 1903, and the Canadian Intercollegiate championship in 1904, and 1906. He was known as a gentlemanly player, and an adept goal scorer. He scored five times against Princeton and Yale when Queen's won the 1903 title. The 1906 Queen's team challenged the Ottawa Hockey Club for the Stanley Cup. Richardson played left wing for the 14th Regiment of Kingston team from 1907 to 1909. The 1908 team won the Ontario Hockey Association title, and the J. Ross Robertson Trophy, as Richardson scored seven goals in one game against Stratford. Richardson won the 1909 Allan Cup a year later. He then joined the Kingston Frontenacs as team president, when the juniors won the OHA title in 1911 and 1912. Richardson never pursued a professional hockey career, since he was wealthy enough from working in the family business. ==Military service== Richardson began his military career as a Lieutenant with The Princess of Wales' Own Regiment, and when World War I was declared, he joined the Canadian Expeditionary Force on September 22, 1914 at CFB Valcartier. Richardson was promoted to Captain as a result of being the sole survivor in the 2nd Battalion during the a battle near Saint-Julien in Langemark Captain Richardson bought boots and gas masks for men under his command. He was killed in action February 9, 1916, resulting from being shot three times in the hips and abdomen, in a battle near Wulverghem. He is buried in the Bailleul Communal Cemetery Extension in Bailleul, Nord in plot 2, row B, grave 74. or grave 2027. ==Posthumous honours== George Richardson Memorial Trophy at the Hockey Hall of Fame Richardson became a Chevalier of the Legion of Honour of the French Third Republic on March 19, 1916. Captain Richardson is listed on page 154, of the Book of Remembrance for World War I. He bequeathed $15,000 to Queen's University for art and athletics, $5,000 for bathing facilities in Kingston, $30,000 to city charities, and $30,000 form a trust fund for the education of the children of the married men in his company, that were disabled or killed in battle. The George Taylor Richardson Memorial Fund was established to provide grants for the stimulation of the arts at Queen's University. Richardson Memorial Stadium at Queen's is named in his honour. From 1932 to 1971, The Eastern Canada junior hockey champion won the George Richardson Memorial Trophy, and advanced to the Memorial Cup.

The model is one of the most significant modern theories of melodic expectation, going into great detail about how certain melodic structures arouse particular expectations. ==History== Meyer (1956) applied Gestalt psychology principles to musical expectation, resulting in his ideas about completion, closure, and his Law of Good Continuation. In 1977, Narmour's book explicated problems he had with Schenkerian analysis and sketched ideas for a new model of analysis based on musical expectation as informed by the work of Meyer. Narmour mentioned a forthcoming book, The Melodic Structure of Tonal Music, but it did not appear. Much time passed without the alternative theory, but finally in 1989 Narmour published his I-R model, detailed in the 1990 and 1992 books. As of 2007, Narmour is working on a new book, which will extend the I-R theory to the parameters of harmony and rhythm and explore potential applications to the analysis of performance. ==Theory== Narmour's I-R model was published in two separate books, dealing with \\"basic melodic structures\\" and \\"melodic complexity\\". Each book is quite complex; only a few key points are mentioned here. The Music Perception review by Ian Cross and the article by Schellenberg provide introductions to the theory. ===Basic melodic structures==General claims==== The Analysis and Cognition of Basic Melodic Structures: The Implication-Realization Model begins with two general claims. The first is given by \\"two universal formal hypotheses\\" describing what listeners expect. The process of melody perception is based on \\"the realization or denial\\" of these hypotheses (1990, 3): # A + A → A # A + B → C Here, A, B, and C are melodic items of either form, interval patterns, or pitches. A + A → A indicates that hearing two similar items yields an expectation of repetition of the item. A + B → C, on the other hand, indicates that hearing two different items yields an expected change in the implied item. The second claim is that the \\"forms\\" above function to provide either closure or nonclosure. Narmour goes on to describe the five melodic archetypes of his theory: # process [P] or iteration (duplication) [D] (A + A without closure) # reversal [R] (A + B with closure) # registral return [aba] (exact or nearly exact return to same pitch) # dyad (two implicative items, as in 1 and 2, without a realization) # monad (one element which does not yield an implication) Central to the discussion is the notion of registral direction (direction of motion) and size of intervals between pairs of pitches. [P] (process) refers to motion in the same registral direction combined with similar intervallic motion (two small intervals or two large intervals). [D] refers to identical intervallic motion with lateral registral direction. [R] refers to changing intervallic motion (large to smaller) with different registral directions. P, D, and R only account for cases where registral direction and intervalic motion are working in unison to satisfy the implications. When one of these two factors is denied, there are more possibilities, the five archetypal derivatives: # intervallic process [IP]: small interval to similar small interval, different registral directions # registral process [VP]: small to large interval, same registral direction # intervallic reversal [IR]: large interval to small interval, same registral direction # registral reversal [VR]: large interval to larger interval, different registral direction # intervallic duplication [ID]: small interval to identical small interval, different registral directions Each of these 8 fundamental symbols can refer to a \\"prospective or retrospective dimension\\". The symbols are enclosed in parentheses like so: (VR) to indicate a \\"retrospective realization\\". Narmour (1990, 6) considers these symbols to be representative of cognitive structures: \\"As symbological tokens, all sixteen prospective and retrospective letters purport to represent the listener's encoding of many of the basic structures of melody.\\" From these foundations, the theory gets more detailed, and problems of style, pitch, harmony, rhythm, etc. are all discussed. ====Syntactic parametric scale===Top-down and bottom-up processing===Five principles==== Schellenberg's work has involved testing and simplifying specific implementations of the I-R model. His 1997 article gives an overview of the I-R theory that describes it in terms of five governing principles: # Registral direction # Intervallic difference # Registral return # Proximity # Closure =====1. Registral direction===== * Small intervals imply continuation of pitch direction * Large intervals imply a change of direction =====2. Intervallic difference===== * Small intervals imply similar-sized realized intervals ** When the registral direction changes, a \\"small\\" realized interval is defined as the original interval size +/- 2 semitones ** In the absence of direction change, a \\"small\\" interval is the original interval +/- 3 semitones * Large implicative intervals imply smaller realized intervals =====3. Registral return===== This is the melodic archetype aba or aba\\\\' where the second tone of a realized interval is very similar to the original pitch (within 2 semitones). This archetype describes symmetric or near-symmetric patterns such as C-G-C#. Patterns are less archetypical as they deviate more from this symmetry. =====4. Proximity===== * Small realized intervals are more implied than large intervals. Also, implications are stronger for smaller-sized intervals. =====5. Closure===== Closure describes how listeners segment melodies based on pitch direction and interval size. Closure occurs in two cases: * Melody changes direction. That is, implicative and realized intervals are in different directions. * A larger implicative interval is followed by a smaller realized interval. ===Melodic complexity=== ... ==CriticismReferences== * Cross, I.

They first won the contest in with \\"Wild Dances\\" by Ruslana, and won again in with the song \\"1944\\" by Jamala, to become the first Eastern European country to win the contest twice. Ukraine hosted the and contests in Kyiv. As of 2019, only Ukraine and Australia have a 100% semifinal qualification rate in Eurovision Since the introduction of the semifinal round in 2004, Ukraine and Australia are the only countries outside the Big 5 to have qualified for the final of every Eurovision they have competed in (Ukraine were absent in 2015 and 2019 and Australia did not participate until 2015; also 2020 contest was cancelled). Ukraine has a total of six top five placements, with Verka Serduchka () and Ani Lorak () both finishing second, Zlata Ognevich third (), and Mika Newton fourth (). The only countries with more top five results in the 21st century are Sweden (12) and Russia (11). ==History== Ukraine made its debut in 2003, when Oleksandr Ponomariov finished 14th. Ukraine won the contest at the second attempt in , when Ruslana won with the song \\"Wild Dances\\", defeating second-placed Serbia and Montenegro by 17 points, 280 to 263. On 19 September 2014, state broadcaster NTU announced that it would sit out the 2015 Contest because of financial difficulties in relation to the ongoing Ukrainian crisis. However, Ukraine broadcast the contest despite not taking part.«Євробачення–2015» українці дивилися найгірше за останні вісім років On 23 May 2015, Ukrainian Broadcaster NTU pledged to bring Ukraine back to the contest for 2016. On 16 September 2015, it was announced that Ukraine would return to the contest in 2016. On its return to the contest in , Ukraine became the first Eastern European country to win the contest twice, when Jamala won with her song \\"1944\\". The televote was won by Russia and the jury vote by Australia; Ukraine was second in both, but won with an overall total of 534 points, with Australia second with 511 points and Russia third with 491 points. In 2017, as host country, Ukraine was already pre-qualified for the final, however they achieved the worst result for the country – 24th with 36 Points. In 2019, similarly to previous years, UA:PBC delegated national selection of its Eurovision entry to a private broadcaster STB. Juries and public vote determined Maruv's Siren Song as a winner. In the following days, UA:PBC failed to reach a deal with Maruv due to disagreements on conditions of her taking part in the Ukrainian delegation. UA:PBC then offered the Eurovision ticket to runner-ups in the national selection, Freedom Jazz, Kazka and Brunettes Shoot Blondes who all refused. As result, UA:PBC withdrew from the Eurovision Song Contest 2019 on 27 February 2019. Since the introduction of the semi-final round in 2004, Ukraine is one of only two countries to have qualified for the final of every Eurovision they have competed in (they were absent from the 2015 and 2019 contests). The other country is Australia, who first entered in 2015.No country has always participated in the final since the introduction of semifinals in 2004. Australia who qualified every year, made their debut in 2015, while Ukraine, despite having always reached the final, skipped the contest in 2015 and 2019. Also, 2020 contest was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The \\"Big Five\\" (France, Germany, Italy, Spain and United Kingdom) are also not counted in this list since they receive automatic qualification to the final. Ukraine has a total of nine top ten placements (six top five).

The Theory of Flight is a 1998 film directed by Paul Greengrass from a screenplay written by Richard Hawkins. It stars Helena Bonham Carter and Kenneth Branagh. It premiered at the 23rd Toronto International Film Festival on 11 September 1998. Bonham Carter plays a woman with motor neurone disease, and the film deals with the sexuality of people with disabilities. == Plot == Richard (Branagh), an unsuccessful artist who builds primitive flying machines, attempts to fly from the roof of a London office building wearing homemade wings but fails, instead crash-landing and only being saved by a rescue squad. As a result of his actions Richard is sentenced to community service, in the form of caring for Jane (Bonham Carter), an ill-tempered, wheelchair-bound woman who suffers from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and has run off her previous carers. Over time, Richard and Jane become friends, and eventually Jane asks Richard to help her find someone to lose her virginity to, explaining that she doesn't wish to die a virgin. Reluctantly Richard helps her search for an appropriate partner, while spending his free time building yet another experimental flying machine. Eventually the two settle on a high-priced male gigolo (Ray Stevenson) for Jane, who agrees to sleep with her for two thousand pounds. As neither of them has that amount of money, they conclude that Richard must rob a bank to secure the needed cash. Richard books a hotel suite for Jane and pays the gigolo five hundred pounds, promising the rest later. As Richard leaves for the bank job, the gigolo lays a very nervous Jane on the bed, but she begins panicking and decides she no longer wants to go through with it. Meanwhile, Richard likewise changes his mind, drawing his gun in the bank but then fleeing immediately, calling Jane's name. He returns to the room and drives off the unhappy gigolo. Richard and Jane are seen successfully taking a flight in Richard's flying machine, although it breaks apart on landing. The pair are then seen in bed, implying that Richard has taken Jane's virginity. Jane dies soon after, and the film ends with Richard placing a commemorative sign honoring Jane's memory on the wreckage of his flying machine. == Cast == *Helena Bonham Carter as Jane Hatchard *Kenneth Branagh as Richard *Gemma Jones as Anne *Holly Aird as Julie *Ray Stevenson as Gigolo == Reception == The Theory of Flight received mixed reception from critics and currently holds a 50% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. It was the last film reviewed on-air by film critic Gene Siskel on Siskel and Ebert at the Movies before his death on 20 February 1999. Siskel gave the film a thumbs up, while his critic partner Roger Ebert gave the film a thumbs down.\\"Gene's last show 23 January 1999\\".

The gold coronet, with diamonds set in platinum, was made for and used by Prince Charles at his investiture as Prince of Wales in 1969. Designed by the artist Louis Osman, the coronet was a gift from the Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths to the Prince's mother, Queen Elizabeth II. It has been described as modern but its form is traditional. The coronet is in storage along with the other Welsh regalia at St James's Palace, London. ==Background== When the former King Edward VIII went into exile as the Duke of Windsor in 1936 following his abdication, he took with him the Coronet of George, Prince of Wales – a highly controversial act. This coronet had been specially created for King George V, when Prince of Wales, and he wore it at his father's coronation in 1902. George's son, Edward, when Prince of Wales, wore it at the coronation of his father in 1911. In 1969, it was judged impractical to charge the ex-king with effectively stealing the coronet, which would be returned to the United Kingdom after his death in 1972. Since the 1902 coronet was unavailable, and the Coronet of Frederick, Prince of Wales was judged unusable due to its age, a new coronet had to be made for the investiture of Charles, Prince of Wales. He had been created Prince of Wales in 1958 but the formal investiture ceremony was held a few months before his 21st birthday. Today, the coronets of Frederick and George are part of the Crown Jewels of the United Kingdom on display at the Tower of London. ==Design== The coronet follows the form laid down by King Charles II in 1677 by having just one arch rather than the traditional two arches or four half- arches of British monarchs' crowns to show that the Prince of Wales is inferior to the monarch but outranks the other royal princes and dukes. Though based on this traditional design, the coronet has a futurist look that was popular in the 1960s, and it was created by the eccentric designer Louis Osman. In the centre of the arch is a monde (which is actually a gold-plated ping-pong ball) engraved with the Prince of Wales's insignia by Malcolm Appleby, surmounted by a plain cross. Orbiting the monde are thirteen square diamonds set in platinum arranged as the constellation of Scorpio – the Prince of Wales's star sign. Within the 24-carat textured gold base is a purple velvet cap lined with ermine. Around the base are four crosses and four abstract fleurs-de-lis in 22-carat gold (mined in the Mawddach Valley in Merionethshire, it was the last Welsh gold held in stock by Johnson Matthey) sparsely decorated with diamonds and emeralds. The diamonds on the base are intended to represent the seven deadly sins and the seven gifts of the Holy Spirit. In total, the coronet has 75 diamonds and 12 emeralds – white and green being the national colours of Wales – and weighs . It measures tall and in diameter at the widest point. When Osman unveiled the coronet in London, he described it as \\"something that is modern\\". ==Manufacture== The frame was made by electroplating gold onto the inside of an epoxy resin cast. B. J. S. Electroplating Co., a precious-metal electroformers, was commissioned by the Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths to make a fibreglass-reinforced polyester mould of a wax model of the coronet that Louis Osman had made using a wooden template. From this mould a negative epoxy resin cast was produced. B. J. S. involved Engelhard Industries to assist in the electroforming of the cast. David Mason was Head of Research at Engelhard and was assigned the task of doing the electroforming at the company's headquarters in the Forest of Dean. Until then, electroforming an object of that size had never been attempted anywhere in the world, and it was the first crown to be made in this way. ==Usage== The Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths presented the coronet to Queen Elizabeth II for the investiture, which was held at Caernarfon Castle on 1 July 1969. Coronets of Princes of Wales have been rarely used. The Coronet of Frederick, Prince of Wales was never actually worn by Frederick; and the Coronet of George, Prince of Wales was only worn rarely by George, later King George V, and by Edward, later King Edward VIII. The current Prince of Wales has not worn his coronet since his investiture; the coronet was carried before him when he took his seat in the House of Lords in 1970. The coronet was loaned to the National Museum and Gallery of Wales in Cardiff by Queen Elizabeth II in 1974. It was placed into storage at St James's Palace, London in 2011. ==See also== * ==ReferencesExternal links== * Category:Charles, Prince of Wales Charles, Prince of Wales Category:National symbols of Wales Category:Royal Collection of the United Kingdom ","title":"Coronet of Charles, Prince of Wales"},{"id":"1998042","text":"Gordon William \\"Doc\\" Roberts (September 5, 1891 – September 2, 1966) was a Canadian professional ice hockey forward who played for the Ottawa Hockey Club and Montreal Wanderers of the National Hockey Association (NHA) and the Vancouver Millionaires and Seattle Metropolitans of the Pacific Coast Hockey Association (PCHA). He was a member of the Ottawa team that defended the Stanley Cup in a 1910 challenge; Roberts scored seven goals in two games in his team's victory over the Edmonton Hockey Club. He moved to Montreal in 1910 where he was consistently among the NHA's leading scorers with the Wanderers while also studying medicine at McGill University. While in Montreal, Roberts attended McGill University, where he studied to become a physician. Following his graduation, he settled in British Columbia to begin his medical career. Continuing his hockey career, Roberts joined the Vancouver Millionaires where he was named a PCHA all-star at left wing and led the league in scoring with 43 goals in 1916–17. He retired from hockey in 1918 following a season in Seattle before Vancouver lured him back to the game one year later. Roberts left the sport again in 1920 and his medical career ultimately took him to Oakland, California where he practiced for over 40 years. He was posthumously inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1971. ==Playing career== Roberts participated in several sports in his youth. In addition to hockey, he played lacrosse and football. Roberts focused on hockey, however, and played for several teams in his hometown of Ottawa. He was the leading scorer of the Ottawa City Hockey League in 1908–09 as a member of the Emmitts Hockey Club with 19 goals in six games. When he turned professional in 1909 by joining the Ottawa Hockey Club, Roberts was one of the youngest players in his league at the age of 18 years. He scored three goals with the team in a single game in the short-lived Canadian Hockey Association before Ottawa jumped to the National Hockey Association (NHA) for the remainder of the season. In nine NHA games, Roberts recorded 13 goals. Ottawa was the defending Stanley Cup champions and, during the season, were challenged for the trophy by the Alberta champion Edmonton Hockey Club in January 1910. The Ottawa Citizen described Roberts as being the star of the first game. The paper praised his defensive checking in addition to his four goals scored in an 8–4 victory. He added three goals in the second game as Ottawa retained control of the Stanley Cup by a 21–11 aggregate score. Having enrolled at McGill University to study medicine, Roberts moved to Montreal. He continued to play hockey and lacrosse but could not play football as McGill was unable to have him certified as an amateur. Also ineligible to play collegiate hockey, he joined the Montreal Wanderers for the 1910–11 NHA season. Roberts played only four NHA games that year, but thereafter was consistently one of the league's leading scorers. Following a pair of 16-goal seasons, Roberts finished second in league scoring with 31 goals in 1913–14 and with 29 in 1914–15. He was also named a league all-star in 1914. Roberts found it difficult to both study and play hockey, but praised the support of his classmates and the faculty in helping him earn his degree. He had to complete an extra year of schooling after failing his second year, but graduated from McGill in 1916. Following an 18-goal season in 1915–16, he left Montreal to take up practice in British Columbia. Roberts continued his hockey career and joined the Vancouver Millionaires of the Pacific Coast Hockey Association (PCHA). He led the PCHA in scoring with 43 goals – in 23 games – and was named a league all-star on left wing. His medical career took him to Seattle and as a result, he joined the Seattle Metropolitans for the 1917–18 PCHA season. He retired in 1918 to focus on his medical career in the Howe Sound region of British Columbia, but was lured back to the PCHA by the Millionaires for the 1919–20 season. He scored 16 goals in 22 games for Vancouver before permanently retiring from hockey. ==Playing style== Roberts was considered by his contemporaries to be one of the greatest left wings in the sport's history. His wrist shot, one of the most fearsome of the pre-1927 era, became the stuff of legend across the country, in both the PCHA and NHA. Amongst the sporting press, he was often said to have had \\"the hardest and most deceptive shot in hockey\\" during the 1910s. Roberts was sometimes described as being the inventor of the \\"curved shot\\", preceding and outmatching players such as Harry Cameron, Babe Dye and Didier Pitre. Bernie Morris, and Hall of Famers Frank Foyston and Lester Patrick all attested to the unrivalled effectiveness and dramatic trajectory of Roberts’ shot. Clint Benedict, often considered the greatest goalie of the 1893-1926 eraColeman, Charles L. (1966). The Trail of the Stanley Cup, vol. 1, 1893-1926, p. 791 also gave praise to Roberts’ accuracy coupled with his ability to curve the puck. Roberts was noted for being able to get his shot off at very bad angles from close in, as well as drive it in from far outside the reach and typical positional range of defenceman.Ottawa Citizen - Jan 19, 1910 Notwithstanding his shooting prowess, Roberts was also well regarded for his stamina and skating ability, as well as being an above-average defensive checker. Despite being a physical player, Roberts (like his contemporary Frank Nighbor) was noted for his gentlemanly conduct on the ice – which he may have used to protect himself from retaliation. Montreal Canadiens bench boss George Kennedy told a story of a game against the Montreal Wanderers in which Didier Pitre was being tripped and butt-ended by the rugged Wanderers winger: > ......Kennedy screamed at Pitre, ‘Are you afraid of Roberts?’ 'No, sure > not,’ was Pitre's surprised response. ‘Well, why don't you hit him back?’ > Kennedy snapped. ‘How can I hit back?’ Pitre asked. ‘Roberts, he is very > polite, very nice. Each time I fall, he helps me get up and apologizes and > says it is an accident ... can I hit a man who is apologizing to me? No, > never, it is not > done......’'http://hfboards.hockeysfuture.com/showpost.php?p=80664281&postcount;=84 ==Personal life== Born September 5, 1891, and raised in Ottawa, Roberts was the youngest of ten children; he had eight brothers and a sister. His brother Laurie was also a doctor and athlete, while another brother, Eddie, fought and died in the First World War. Roberts returned east in 1922 where he did post- graduate studies in New York. The Ottawa Senators, then of the National Hockey League, attempted to bring him out of retirement again and Cornell University sought his services as a lacrosse coach. Roberts turned down both offers and chose to retain focus on his medical career; He moved to California where he taught for a time at Stanford University Hospital. By 1925, he settled in Oakland where he practiced as an obstetrician for over 40 years. Roberts also acted as a referee at California Hockey League games. Roberts died September 2, 1966, and in 1971 was posthumously inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame. ==Career statistics== {| border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"1\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"text-align:center; width:50em\\" |-bgcolor=\\"#e0e0e0\\" ! colspan=\\"3\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\" | ! rowspan=\\"99\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\" | ! colspan=\\"5\\" | Regular season ! rowspan=\\"99\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\" | ! colspan=\\"5\\" | Playoffs |- bgcolor=\\"#e0e0e0\\" !

There were two series. The episode list identified 17 episodes, but in the final episode the presenter referred to 10 episodes in the first series and 8 in the second. As its slogan stated, it combined trivia and the laws of cricket. It was hosted by longtime BBC cricket commentator Brian Johnston, who served as the \\"umpire.\\" In each episode, the team captains Tim Rice and Willie Rushton were joined by another celebrity from showbiz or cricket. The teams are offered a choice of question for 1 or 4 runs - the single being an easier question than the boundary. The batting team receives up to six questions (or an over) before questioning turns to the other team. The questions usually revolve around trivia and unusual facts. However, there are ways in which a team can win back the questioning more quickly. If a team doesn't give the correct answer, the opposing team can shout 'Howzat!' and offer the correct answer to score a wicket and win the questioning. (\\"Howzat\\" in cricket is usually said by the bowler to the umpire to ask if the batsman's wicket was taken by the bowl.) If they challenge the answer unsuccessfully, the batting team receives 2 runs in overthrows as compensation and keeps the batting. Each team also has three bouncers, prepared earlier. They can say 'Bouncer' before the next question is asked. All the bouncers are very difficult (often estimation questions) and score six runs if successfully answered. (Six being the number of runs awarded for a boundary which doesn't hit the ground)http://www.cricket-rules.com/ However, a wicket is lost and the batting goes to the other team if the answer is wrong. The winning team is the one which scores the most runs by the end of the programme (the fewer number of wickets splitting any ties). Panellists on the programme have included Stephen Fry, William Franklyn, Rachael Heyhoe-Flint, Jeremy Beadle, Paul Merton and Leslie Thomas. The programme was written and devised by Peter Hickey and Malcolm Williamson. ==References== * Category:BBC Radio 4 Extra programmes Category:British radio game shows Category:1980s British game shows Category:1990s British game shows Category:Cricket on the radio Category:1986 radio programme debuts ","title":"Trivia Test Match"},{"id":"1998057","text":"Lithuania has participated in the Eurovision Song Contest (known in Lithuania as Eurovizijos dainų konkursas) 20 times since its debut in 1994, where Ovidijus Vyšniauskas finished last, receiving \\"nul points\\". Lithuania withdrew from the contest, not returning until 1999. LT United's sixth place in with the song \\"We Are the Winners\\" is Lithuania's best result in the contest. The country reached the top ten for a second time in , when Donny Montell finished ninth with \\"I've Been Waiting for This Night\\". ==History2000s=== Having been relegated from the 2000 contest the country returned in 2001 with Skamp and \\"You Got Style\\", the first Lithuanian song to include English. They received 35 points, placing 13th. However the following year, Aivaras could only manage to come second last with 12 points. Since the semi-finals were introduced Lithuania again came last with Laura and the Lovers and \\"Little by Little\\". The following year the Lithuanian broadcaster Lietuvos Nacionalinis Radijas ir Televizija (LRT) sent LT United to the 2006 contest with the football chant-like song \\"We Are the Winners\\". They took Lithuania to the final for the first time since 2002, coming sixth in the final with 162 points, Lithuania's best placing as of 2019. The following year Lithuania automatically qualified for the final, however 4Fun could not replicate LT United's success, coming 21st with only 28 points, 12 of which came from Ireland. In 2008 Jeronimas Milius failed to reach the final, coming 16th of 19 competing nations in the second semi-final. Lithuania threatened to boycott the 2009 contest \\"if Russia continues to showcase power and ignores international law\\". The statement was made in reaction to the Russia's actions in the 2008 South Ossetia war. Culture Minister Jonas Jucas stated that it was too early to discuss the boycott since \\"spontaneous decisions might aggravate the efforts of diplomats\\" and thus make the situation worse. At the Eurovision Song Contest 2009, Lithuania qualified from the semi finals and at the end of the voting in the final had received 23 points, placing them 23rd. ===2010s=== LRT announced in December 2009 that, due to a lack of necessary funds, Lithuania would formally withdraw from the 2010 Contest. However, in the event that the necessary funds of 300,000 litas (€90,000) would be found the broadcaster announced that they would attempt to continue the country's participation. Ultimately, private company TEO LT provided the necessary funding and Lithuania participated in Bærum. In 2011, Lithuania participated in the first semi-final on the 10 May 2011 and after coming fifth, qualified for the Final. In the final, Lithuania received 63 points, to finish 19th. In 2012, Lithuania qualified for the final placing 3rd with 104 points Donny Montell finished 14th in the Grand Final with the song \\"Love Is Blind\\". In 2013, Lithuania quafiled to the final,he placed 9th in the first semi-final, with 53 points, qualifying Lithuania to the finals for the 3rd time in row.In the final,he ended on 22nd place with 17 points. In 2014, Vilija didn't qualify to final finishing 11th of 15 entrants in the second semi-final, scoring 36 points.

It developed about 12,000 years ago, during the Wisconsin glaciation in North America. A complex ridge of sedimentary material, the moraine is known to have partially developed under water. The Niagara Escarpment played a key role in forming the moraine in that it acted as a dam for glacial meltwater trapped between it and two ice lobes. In order to understand the process by which the moraine formed, it is necessary to understand the physical geography in which it currently exists (that is, its physiography), and the layers of sediments found within it (the stratigraphy of the moraine). ==Regional physiography== The Oak Ridges Moraine consists of four elevated, wedge-shaped structures; from west to east, they are: * The Albion Hills wedge, * the Uxbridge wedge, * the Pontypool wedge, and * the Rice Lake wedge. These wedges are separated by narrow east to west ridges, and formed via sedimentation. The hummocky terrain, small elevated plains and narrow ridges suggest that its formation is of glacial origin. The moraine is nearly bisected in the east; the Rice Lake wedge is isolated from the three western wedges since the moraine is absent directly south of Rice Lake. Four primary geophysical structures are intimately tied to the formative processes of the Oak Ridges Moraine: * the Niagara Escarpment to the west * drumlinized uplands in the north, with extensions south of the Oak Ridges Moraine * wide, flat-floored valleys, primarily in the north * low-relief plains in the south. ===Niagara Escarpment=== The western margin of the moraine is delineated by the Niagara Escarpment, a prominent cuesta that was fundamental to the development of the moraine. The escarpment's channels provided a route for drainage of ice-marginal meltwater; the channel system was eroded into the cuesta, and along its exposed eastern facing. Meltwater drained southwest and northeast along these corridors during the formation of the Oak Ridges Moraine. The Niagara Escarpment probably controlled regional water levels throughout the formation of the moraine. ===Peterborough drumlin field=== The Peterborough drumlin field is a large physiographic feature to the north of the Oak Ridges Moraine. It has a northeast to southwest orientation, and is cut by a network of deep valleys with wide, flat floors. The valleys are steep-sided, and have a branching pattern. The valley floors also exhibit inset eskers. The feature also extends south of the moraine. ==Stratigraphy== The Oak Ridges Moraine consists of numerous layers of sedimentary material, for some of which the origin is unknown. The base of the moraine touches bedrock; \\"it is not clear if the bedrock valley itself was sculpted by a subglacial meltwater event, or was of a preglacial fluvial origin, or was possibly a combination of both.\\" (Davies and Holysh, 2004, pg 27-5) Above the bedrock are the Lower Sediments (as styled by the Geological Survey of Canada), consisting of diamict and fine-grained glaciolacustrine sediments at its base, and an upper sandy aquifer layer. (Davies and Holysh, 2004, pg 27-5). Overlaying this is a thick sequence of Newmarket Till, a sandy loam sedimentary layer common in the area. Each wedge exhibits different characteristics and sedimentary patterns, thus displaying many incongruities and depositional unconformities. The Rice Lake wedge, for instance, achieves a peak of 180 m above sea level, with a 20 m layer of shallow surface Oak Ridges Moraine sediments, underlain by the Newmarket Till. The other wedges, which peak at up to 335 m, have thicker and more varied surficial deposits, and the Newmarket Till lies deeper below the surface. Moreover, the sedimentary deposits are underlain by Halton Till on these wedges, which is not present in the Rice Lake wedge. Thus, from top to bottom, the stratigraphy of the moraine is: * Oak Ridges Moraine sediments * Halton Till (not present at Rice Lake) * Channel sediments * Newmarket Till * Lower sediments (sandy aquifer above, diamict and glaciolacustrine units below) * Bedrock ==Formation of the moraine== The most accepted theory of the development of the Oak Ridges Moraine is that proposed by Barnett et al. (1998). \\"Moraine development is highlighted in four stages and evolved rapidly from a glaciofluvial-dominated core to flanking glaciolacustrine-dominated wedge sediments.\\" (Barnett et al., 1998, pg 1160) The four distinct stages of the model are: # subglacial sedimentation, # subaqueous fan sedimentation, # fan to delta sedimentation, and # ice-marginal sedimentation. However, the process by which each of these stages occurred has not been fully investigated, and is not completely understood. ===Pre-formative history=== During the Late Wisconsinan period, the central part of Ontario was under thick ice. An east-west fissure split the ice sheet at the western periphery of the Oak Ridges Moraine, creating the Simcoe ice lobe to the north, and the Ontario lobe to the south. Moreover, the ice sheet's constant retreat created fractures where it met and scoured the bedrock. These fractures allowed the development of sub-glacial rivers (adj. glaciofluvial) and lakes (adj. glaciolacustrine). With constant exposure to the sun, the surface of the ice sheet continued to melt; the meltwater flowed from high points to the north- and south-east, and from the Niagara Escarpment to the west, into the cavity created by the fissure. The fast-flowing meltwater rapidly eroded the surface of the cavity, and created channels beneath the surface of the ice. ===Subglacial sedimentation=== The meltwater eventually created a network of subglacial channels; many subglacial cavities also formed throughout the ice in the region. The sediment-laden meltwater travelled along these channels, increasingly depositing material in the cavities, and in the channels as the flow waned. The channel fills along the core of the Oak Ridges Moraine are primarily coarse to fine, though the channel bases exhibit a thick sequence of coarse sediments. Moreover, analysis of eskers within the deep valleys to the north of the moraine show that they tend to broaden to form gravel sheets. Accordingly, the \\"sedimentological data support the interpretation that the underfit valleys are tunnel channels eroded and filled with high-velocity. perhaps subglacial, meltwater.\\" (Barnett et al., 1998, pg 1161) ===Fan to delta sedimentation=== The sedimentary deposits characteristic of this stage were lateral to, and overlying the deposits from the previous stage. Moreover, \\"[fan] sedimentation in this stage is distal to primary sediment input sources and occurs in a large ice- controlled lake.\\" (Barnett et al., 1998, pg 1162) The most prominent process throughout this stage is the transition from fan to fan delta, and hence to deltaic sedimentation patterns, with extensive deposition of fine sand and silt rhythmites. Because of the continued erosional effects of the rapidly flowing meltwater, a passage opened on the Niagara Escarpment, creating a channel to the Campbellville outlet. The opening of the outlet allowed significant water discharge from the area, causing the transition from a glaciolacustrine fan sedimentation (from the glacial lake filling the original cavity) to deltaic sedimentation. Additionally, observations demonstrate that the Uxbridge wedge, which sits at an elevation of 335 m, was produced by an ice-confined sedimentation pattern in a lake which water level was controlled by the Campbellville outlet. ===Ice-marginal sedimentation=== In the Humber River basin, \\"interbedded glaciolacustrine stratified sediments and massive to bedded diamicton\\" occurs in the upper deposition layers (Barnett et al., 1998, pg 1162). Some of these were deposited ice-marginally. In the east, deposition predominantly focused along the glacial margin, for example at the Palgrave Moraine. ==References== Category:Oak Ridges Moraine ","title":"Origin of the Oak Ridges Moraine"},{"id":"1998069","text":"Gustave Joseph Frerotte (; born July 31, 1971) is a former American football quarterback. He was drafted by the Washington Redskins in the seventh round of the 1994 NFL Draft. He played college football at Tulsa. Frerotte, who was selected to the 1997 Pro Bowl while with the Redskins, also played for the Detroit Lions, Denver Broncos, Cincinnati Bengals, Miami Dolphins, Minnesota Vikings, and St. Louis Rams. ==Early years== Frerotte attended Ford City High School in Ford City, Pennsylvania, a suburb of Pittsburgh. In high school, he was a letterman in football, basketball, and baseball. Frerotte graduated in 1989. Frerotte is the cousin of Mitch Frerotte, an offensive lineman who played for the Buffalo Bills during the 1990s. ==College career== At the University of Tulsa, he started eight games as a redshirt freshman in 1990 after quarterback T.J. Rubley was injured, starting his first career game at Oklahoma. He finished his college career as the school's second-ranked all- time passer, behind Rubley. During his collegiate career, he threw for 5,480 yards and 32 touchdowns on 432-of-860 passing. His 2,871 passing yards as a senior were the most by a Tulsa quarterback in 28 years. As a sophomore, Frerotte also handled punting duties for the team and averaged 35.5 yards per punt. As an undergraduate, he joined the Pi Kappa Alpha Fraternity. ==Career as athleteWashington Redskins=== Frerotte was picked in the seventh round of the draft with the 197th overall pick by the Washington Redskins; earlier in the same draft, the Redskins had selected Heath Shuler with their first-round pick (third overall). However, by the next season Frerotte was the starting quarterback due to Shuler's injuries and struggles adjusting to the professional game. Frerotte would retain the starting job until 1998. Frerotte was selected to the 1997 Pro Bowl, but sprained his neck by ramming his head into a padded cement wall during a touchdown celebration in a 7-7 tie against the New York Giants on ESPN Sunday Night Football. During his Pro Bowl season in 1996 (actual Pro Bowl Game played in February 1997), Frerotte passed for 3,453 yards (6th best in NFL and his career high), also ranking 9th in pass completions, finishing the year completing 270 of 470 passes. Frerotte also ranked 3rd in the league in average yards per pass completion (12.3). Frerotte had led the league in that category the season before (13.8 yards per completion), his first as a steady starter (16 games, 11 starts), finishing that year with 199 completions in 396 attempts for 2,751 yards with 13 touchdowns and 13 interceptions. ===Detroit Lions=== In 1999, he played for the Detroit Lions, where he backed up Charlie Batch. Frerotte wound up starting for the Lions in the playoffs while Batch was out with injuries; the Lions lost in the Wild Card round to the Redskins, Frerotte's former team, 27-13. The 1999 season statistically was one of Frerotte's best, posting a career-high 60.2% completion percentage (4th best in NFL) and an 83.6 passer rating (9th best in NFL and best of Frerotte's career when starting 6 or more games). He also finished in the NFL Top 10 for Highest Average yards Per Pass Attempt at 6.88 (9th in NFL) & Passing Yards Per Game at 235.2 (8th in NFL). Frerotte's best game of the season came vs Chicago (11/25/99) completing a career best (up to this point) 29 completions for 309 yards with 2 Touchdowns and no interceptions, a key player in a narrow 21-17 win. The following week Frerotte again played well, this time facing his former team, helping Detroit beat Washington 33-17 completing 21 of 32 passes for 280 yards with 1 Touchdown and no interceptions. Frerotte established a then career high 375 yards, completing 24 of 39 passes again with 2 touchdowns and no interceptions in a losing effort vs Arizona on 11/14/99 (Full Season Statistics courtesy of Pro Football Reference.com and individual game statistics courtesy of NFL.com). ===Denver Broncos=== In 2000, Gus was a backup for the Denver Broncos. After Brian Griese was injured, he led the Broncos to the playoffs. The team lost in the opening round to the eventual Super Bowl champion Baltimore Ravens. He remained the Broncos' backup until the 2001 NFL season was over. Playing in 10 games (6 starts) subbing for the injured Griese, Frerotte lead Denver to four wins in his six starts, finishing the season with a 59.8% completion percentage (2nd best of career in a season with 6 or more starts), passing for 1,776 yards with nine touchdowns and eight interceptions.

His most notable play with the Bengals came against the Cleveland Browns on September 15: Frerotte, attempting to avoid a sack by Orpheus Roye, threw the ball with his left hand (Frerrotte is right-handed) and was intercepted by Browns defensive lineman and former teammate with the Washington Redskins, Kenard Lang, who returned the ball 71 yards to the Bengals 8-yard line. ===2003–2007: Vikings, Dolphins, and Rams=== In 2003 and 2004, Frerotte backed up Daunte Culpepper for the Minnesota Vikings, and served as the team's holder on field goals.

He was Tarvaris Jackson's backup for the first two games of the year. On September 17, 2008, he was named the starter for the rest of the 2008 season by head coach Brad Childress. Frerotte led the Vikings to an 8–3 record before suffering a back injury, which reinstated Jackson as the starter. On November 30, 2008, Frerotte tied the NFL record for the longest pass from scrimmage by throwing a 99-yard touchdown pass to Bernard Berrian against the Chicago Bears. Frerotte had expressed interest in being the starting quarterback for the Vikings for the 2009 NFL season, but was released on February 27, 2009, after the team traded for quarterback Sage Rosenfels. The Vikings, however, would end up signing Brett Favre to be their eventual starter. ==After retirement== By December 2010, Frerotte was working for GAIMPlan Consulting which helps high school athletes select a college.{{cite web | url= http://www.getgaim.com/GaimPlan_Consulting/Gus_Frerotte.html Gus Frerotte | website= retrain.com| date=| accessdate= } } On January 19, 2011, Frerotte announced he would be taking over as head coach at John Burroughs School in the St. Louis, Missouri, area.

Boccherini, a talented cellist, composed twelve concertos for his instrument. In 1895 German cellist Friedrich Grützmacher chose this concerto to be arranged to fit the style of a Romantic virtuoso concerto, and in this form, widely heard, it bears only a tenuous resemblance to the original manuscript. The Boccherini Ninth Cello Concerto has long been an integral part of standard cello instruction, because of creeping use of the full 4+ octave range of the cello, rather than large jumps between different finger positions. Grützmacher merged Boccherini's Ninth Cello Concerto with other Boccherini Cello Concertos. Besides the extensive cuts in the outer movements, Grützmacher decided to rid the Concerto of its original second movement, replacing it with that of the Seventh Cello Concerto (in G Major, G.480). The Fourth Cello Concerto (In C Major, G.477) makes an appearance in bars 40-46 of the first movement, and in bars 85-96 and 151-163 of the Rondo, borrowing from the respective movements. The arpeggios of the Fifth Cello Concerto's (in D Major, G478) first movement are featured in their minor form in bars 47-53 of the first movement. Grützmacher also took the liberty of writing his own cadenzas. Despite all the changes, this Concerto holds up as one of Boccherini's best-known works. Pablo Casals, Pierre Fournier, Janos Starker, and Jacqueline du Pré all made recordings of this edition of the Concerto. Nevertheless, Boccherini's original work is slowly beginning to resurface. Well-known cellists such as Maurice Gendron, Yo-Yo Ma, and Raphael Wallfisch have all made recordings of this long overshadowed work. Nowadays, the two works are distinguished by their origin: Original vs. arr. Grützmacher. ==Movements== *I. Allegro moderato *II. Andante grazioso (Original) *II.

It is located on top of Little Mountain (elevation approximately 125 metres or 410 feet above sea level) and is the location of former basalt quarries that were dug in the beginning of the twentieth century to provide material for roads in the city. ==History== Before European settlement, the park was an old-growth forest and a spawning ground for salmon. Grey wolves, elk and bears would frequent the area. The settler population which began in earnest in the 1870s exterminated the grey wolves, elk and bears, chopped down all the old growth forest and paved over the salmon creeks. The salmon creeks that extend from Queen Elizabeth to False Creek do still exist today, but they have been paved over and are so polluted that salmon no longer use them. In 1936, the BC Tulip Association suggested the creation of sunken gardens within the old quarries to the city's park board. By the end of that decade, the site had been turned over to the Vancouver Park Board for park and recreation purposes. The park was dedicated by King George VI and his consort, Queen Elizabeth (the mother of Queen Elizabeth II) during their visit to Vancouver in 1939, as King and Queen of Canada. From that time, Park staff incrementally transformed the overgrown hillsides into Canada's first civic arboretum, with a generous donation from the Canadian Pulp and Paper Association. The popular quarry gardens were designed by Park Board Deputy Superintendent Bill Livingstone and were unveiled in the early 1960s. Prentice Bloedel's gift of $1.25 million funded the open reservoirs and built the country's first geodesic conservatory, which is surrounded by covered walkways, lighted fountains and a sculpture, Henry Moore's Knife Edge Two Piece 1962–65. The Bloedel Floral Conservatory opened on December 6, 1969 amidst much jubilation. Its enclosed tropical garden houses 500 exotic plants and flowers and more than a hundred free-flying tropical birds. ==Attractions== There are several other attractions in the park including: * Arboretum * Celebration Pavilion * Bloedel Floral Conservatory * Fountains/Plaza * Quarry Gardens * Painters' Corner * Sculpture Several episodes of the long running TV show Stargate SG-1 were filmed there. ==Activities== Activities at Queen Elizabeth Park include: * Pitch and putt golf course * Little Mountain disc golf course * Tennis courts * Lawn bowling club * Tai Chi * Jogging ==ReferencesExternal links== * City of Vancouver - Queen Elizabeth Park * 1939 film footage of the park Category:Arboreta in Canada Category:Gardens in Canada Category:Parks in Vancouver ","title":"Queen Elizabeth Park, British Columbia"},{"id":"1998097","text":"Tessie is an EP by Dropkick Murphys released in 2004.

Glo Worm is a stuffed toy for young children, designed by Hasbro's Playskool division, and made in Pawtucket, Rhode Island. Introduced in 1982, the plush, pajamaed worm body contained a battery-powered device that when squeezed would light up the toy's vinyl head from within, creating a soft glow. The original toy, upon release, was such a success that Hasbro released a new Musical Glo Worm toy, a series of story books, night lights, videos and other merchandise that continued until the early 1990s. However, in late 2005, the product was criticized for harming children; its plastic head was softened with phthalates, which can be dangerous if swallowed by children. ==Glo Friends== In 1986, Playskool released a number of \\"Glo\\"-based toys that glowed but were made of soft vinyl. These toys, collectively known as \\"Glo Friends\\", were so successful that American fast food chain Wendy's in 1989 also released a series of 13 soft vinyl toys to advertise their chain.

Their debut appearance was a success, with the song \\"Lane moje\\" performed by Željko Joksimović finishing second. The following year, they placed seventh, courtesy of the band No Name with the song \\"Zauvijek moja\\". Following the 2006 Montenegrin independence referendum, and have participated in the contest as separate entities, making their independent debuts in 2007. ==History== Yugoslavia, which included the territories of modern-day Serbia and Montenegro, had been participating in the Eurovision Song Contest since the fifth annual contest in 1961. It had debuted that year along with Spain and Finland becoming, the 14th participating country. Its best result occurred in 1989 when Yugoslavia won with \\"Rock Me\\" by Riva. Yugoslavia participated regularly until 1992, missing only the editions between 1977 and 1980 and the one in 1985. At the 1992 contest, following the breakup of Yugoslavia, Serbia and Montenegro competed representing FR Yugoslavia. FR Yugoslavia was banned from participating in the 1993 edition due to UN sanctions and Yugoslav wars. This marked the start of a decade-long absence from the contest for the territories. In 2002, Serbia and Montenegro sent an application to take part in the 2003 contest, however, they were unable to take part after the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) decided that too many countries would be relegated if the country took part. Radio Television of Serbia (RTS) held a contest – Beovizija 2003 – to be used as a \\"rehearsal\\" for the next year's Eurovision selection, held between 12–14 April. The winner was Toše Proeski with \\"Čija si\\". Proeski would go on to represent his home country Macedonia the following year. Željko Joksimović performing \\"Lane moje\\" in Istanbul () Serbia and Montenegro debuted at the 2004 contest with the song \\"Lane moje\\" performed by Željko Joksimović, finishing first in its semi-final and second overall. The song has become popular amongst many Eurovision fans and it is often rated as one of the best non-winning songs. The following year, they placed seventh, courtesy of the band No Name with the song \\"Zauvijek moja\\". Both entries were selected through the televised national final, Evropesma. No Name were close to becoming the national entry once more, for the 2006 contest in Athens, however since their 2005 win of Evropesma had been disputed due to allegations of tactical voting by the Radio-Television of Montenegro jury, and since the 2006 vote saw a repeat of this, UJRT, the national union of broadcasters, did not reach an agreement on sending them to the contest again. On 20 March 2006, Serbia and Montenegro officially withdrew from the Eurovision Song Contest 2006. The country did however participate in the final voting for the winner. The Eurovision semi-final was not broadcast in Montenegro in 2006, and so the votes from Serbia and Montenegro, were from Serbia alone. After the Montenegrin referendum on independence and dissolution of the state union in June 2006, both countries sent separate entries to the Eurovision Song Contest 2007. Montenegro made their debut as an independent state and sent Stevan Faddy, while Serbia sent Marija Šerifović as their debut entrant. Her song \\"Molitva\\" ended up winning the contest for Serbia, bringing the 2008 contest to Belgrade the following year. == Contestants == {| class=\\"wikitable\\" style=\\"font-size:90%;\\" |+Table key |- |style=\\"background-color:#FC3\\"|1 |Winner |- |style=\\"background-color:#CCC\\"|2 |Second place |} {|class=\\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"width:100%\\" !width=30px|Year !Artist !Language !Title !width=50px|Final !width=50px|Points !width=50px|Semi !width=50px|Points |-bgcolor=\\"silver\\" !scope=\\"row\\"| |Željko Joksimović |Serbian |\\"Lane moje\\" |align=center|2 |align=center|263 |bgcolor=\\"Gold\\" align=center|1 |bgcolor=\\"Gold\\" align=center|263 |- !scope=\\"row\\"| |No Name |Montenegrin |\\"Zauvijek moja\\" |align=center|7 |align=center|137 |colspan=\\"2\\" data-sort-value=\\"-9999\\" |-bgcolor=\\"#A4EAA9\\" !scope=\\"row\\"| | colspan=\\"7\\" data- sort-value=\\"-9999\\" |} ==AwardsMarcel Bezençon Awards=== {| class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"font-size: 95%\\" |- !Year !Category !Song !Composer(s) !Performer !style=\\"width:45px;\\"|Final !style=\\"width:45px;\\"|Points !Host city ! |- !scope=\\"row\\"| |Press Award | \\"Lane moje\\" |Željko Joksimović (m), Leontina Vukomanović (l) |Željko Joksimović |style=\\"text-align:center;\\"| 2 |style=\\"text-align:center;\\"| 263 | Istanbul | |- !scope=\\"row\\"| |Composer Award | \\"Zauvijek moja\\" | Slaven Knezović (m), Milan Perić (l) | No Name |style=\\"text-align:center;\\"| 7 |style=\\"text-align:center;\\"| 137 | Kyiv | |} ==Commentators and spokespersons== {|class=\\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"font-size:90%;\\" |- !Year !Serbian commentator !Montenegrin commentator !Spokesperson !class=\\"unsortable\\"| |- !scope=\\"row\\"| |Mladen Popović || || || | |- !scope=\\"row\\"| |rowspan=\\"3\\"|Duška Vučinić-Lučić ||Dražen Bauković, Tamara Ivanković ||Nataša Miljković || |- !scope=\\"row\\"| |Dražen Bauković, Tamara Ivanković, Danijel Popović ||Nina Radulović|| |- !scope=\\"row\\"| |Dražen Bauković, Tamara Ivanković ||Jovana Janković || |- |} * From until , Serbia and Montenegro competed as part of . == See also == * Evropesma * Yugoslavia in the Eurovision Song Contest * Serbia in the Eurovision Song Contest * Montenegro in the Eurovision Song Contest * Serbia and Montenegro in the Junior Eurovision Song Contest ==Notes and referencesNotes=References=== Category:Former countries in the Eurovision Song Contest ","title":"Serbia and Montenegro in the Eurovision Song Contest"},{"id":"1998125","text":"Polytypic means of more than one type.

Festivali i Këngës, a long-standing song contest that takes place every year in Albania since 1962, is used to select the country's entrant for that year's Eurovision Song Contest. In 2004, Albania's first entry at Eurovision, Anjeza Shahini, finished seventh in the final. This remained the country's best result in the contest until , when Rona Nishliu placed fifth. == History  2000s === The national broadcaster of Albania, Radio Televizioni Shqiptar (RTSH), made the country's debut at the 2004 contest in Istanbul with the song \\"The Image of You\\" performed by Anjeza Shahini. The country received 106 points in the grand final and finished in the seventh place remaining the country's highest placement until 2012. In 2005, due to the country's top 11 placement the previous year, the succeeding entry \\"Tomorrow I Go\\" by Ledina Çelo automatically qualified for the grand final and reached the sixteenth place in Kyiv. The following year, Luiz Ejlli and his entry \\"Zjarr e ftohtë\\" failed to qualify for the grand final in Athens simultaneously marking the first time in their participation history. The 2007 entry was Frederik Ndoci with \\"Hear My Plea\\", performed at Festivali I Këngës 45 as \\"Balada e gurit\\" (The stone ballad). The song was performed at Eurovision in both English and Albanian. In the semi-final of the 2007 contest he received 49 points, placing 17th of 28 in his semi-final and failing to qualify for the final. The winner of Festivali I Këngës 46 was \\"Zemrën e lamë peng\\" (Hearts trapped in time) by Olta Boka. However the result of the juries that selected the winner was controversial and rumours arose that the final two judges intentionally awarded high marks to Boka in order to avoid sending the runners-up, Flaka Krelani and Doruntina Disha, to the contest. Press reactions in Albania were not happy with the decision, and RTSH announced that they would investigate into alleged cheating by the final two judges to award their points. Despite this, Olta Boka's victory remained, and she sang for Albania at the Eurovision Song Contest 2008 in Belgrade, Serbia. She qualified for the final, coming 9th in a field of 19 in the second semi-final, and in the final she received 55 points, coming equal 17th in a field of 25. Albania was the first country to select both their artist and publicly present their song for Eurovision 2009. The winner was again selected by Festivali I Këngës. The winner of Festivali I Këngës 47 was Kejsi Tola with the song \\"Më merr në ëndërr\\" (Take me in your dreams), which was composed by the composers of Albania's first entry Edmond Zhulali and Agim Doçi. The song was performed in English as \\"Carry Me in Your Dreams\\". Albania finished 7th out of 19 in the 2nd semifinal with 73 points, thus qualifying for the final. In the final, where both jury and televoting were used, Albania scored 48 points, finishing 17th in a field of 25. However, had only televoting been used Albania would have placed 11th in the contest. Conversely if only jury voting had been used Albania would have placed 23rd. === 2010s === The winner of Festivali I Këngës 48 was decided on 27 December, with Juliana Pasha winning over former winner Anjeza Shahini. She represented Albania at Eurovision 2010 in Oslo with the song \\"It's All about You\\". The song was a typical up-tempo composition, and has been compared to Christina Aguilera's \\"Keeps Gettin' Better\\" and Britney Spears' \\"Womanizer\\". Albania came 6th in the first semi-final with 76 points, thus qualifying for the final. In the final, Juliana finished 16th with 62 points which included 12 points from Macedonia. The Albanian participant for the 2011 Eurovision Song Contest was chosen in Festivali i Këngës 49 in December 2010. The winner of 2011's Festival of Song was Aurela Gaçe, winning for the third time after 10 years. Her song was named \\"Kënga ime\\" (\\"My Song\\") and it was translated into English with the name \\"Feel the Passion\\", published on 12 March 2011, during a show called \\"Historia nis këtu\\" (\\"The story begins here\\") in RTSH. Albania participated in Semi-Final 1 against 18 other countries, fighting for a place in the grand final in 14 May. However they missed out on qualification for the final for the first time in 4 years, coming 14th. Albania competed in the 2012 competition with the song \\"Suus\\", which was performed by Rona Nishliu. The song got through to the final, coming in 5th place overall with 146 points. Rona Nishliu from Kosovo achieved a record result for Albania. Albania competed in the 2013 Eurovision Song Contest with the song \\"Identitet\\" which was performed by Adrian Lulgjuraj and Bledar Sejko. This song was chosen as the winner through the Festivali i Këngës. The results depended on the jury voting only. Among the experts in the jury was the Italian Head of Delegation at the Eurovision Song Contest, Nicola Caligiore, who greeted and gave the points in English for all the viewers from the Eurovision.tv webcast.http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=adrian_lulgjuraj_and_bledar_sejko_win_festivali_i_kenges Albania came 14th in the second semi-final of the 2013 Eurovision Song Contest in Malmö and did not make it into the grand final. On 28 December 2013, Herciana Matmuja won Festivali i Këngës 52 (the 52nd national final of Albania) and was therefore chosen to represent Albania in Eurovision 2014 with her song 'Zemërimi i një nate'. In the time before Eurovision 2014 she recorded both English and Albanian versions of this song. On 16 March she released the final version of 'One Night's anger' for Eurovision 2014. Albania failed to qualify for the second year in a row. On 28 December 2014, Elhaida Dani won Festivali i Këngës 53 with the song \\"Diell\\", and this represented Albania at the Eurovision Song Contest 2015. On 23 February 2015 it was announced that the songwriters had decided to withdraw the song and Dani would perform something else at Eurovision. The following day it was revealed that Dani would perform \\"I'm Alive\\". On 27 December 2015 Eneda Tarifa won Festivali i Këngës 54 with her song \\"Përrallë\\" which meant she would represent Albania in the Eurovision Song Contest 2016. Albania was the first country to reveal both the artist and song together. It was later translated into English and called \\"Fairytale\\", and the music video premiered on the evening news on TVSH. Albania failed to qualify, coming only 16th out of 18 in the second semi- final. After failing to qualify once again in 2017 with Lindita and the song \\"World\\", Albania returned to the grand final in 2018 with the song \\"Mall\\" by Eugent Bushpepa. It finished 11th of 26 in the final receiving 184 points, giving Albania its third best result in the contest since their debut. The song fared better with the juries, coming 7th in the final respectively. In 2019, Albania selected Jonida Maliqi to represent them with the song \\"Ktheju tokës\\".

Macedonia), has participated in the Eurovision Song Contest 19 times since its official debut in 1998. The country had attempted to participate in 1996, but failed to qualify from the audio-only qualifying round. The current Head of Delegation is Meri Popova. Prior to 2019, North Macedonia's best result was a 12th-place finish with Elena Risteska in . Having qualified from the semi-final round only once in ten of the previous eleven contests (2008–18), North Macedonia achieved its best result to date in , when Tamara Todevska qualified and finished in seventh place in the final after winning the jury vote. ==History== Prior declaring independence in 1991, as a constituent country of SFR Yugoslavia, the Socialist Republic of Macedonia participated in the Yugoslav pre-selection called among the other Yugoslav federal units.Opatijo, oh Fabulous - Yugoslavian selection for the Eurovision Song Contest - statistics by year , Eurodalmatia official ESC fan club, Dalmatia, Croatia Also, Macedonian composers wrote songs for candidates from other parts of Yugoslavia.Official Site of OGAE Macedonia, see section: Jugovizija. However, the Macedonian entries never managed to win, and the SR Macedonia was the only federal state never to send a Yugoslav entry to the Eurovision Song Contest. An exception occurred when Maja Odžaklievska won the Yugoslav competition in 1979, but she did not perform in the Eurovision Song Contest 1979 due to the Yugoslavian decision not to participate that year. As the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYR Macedonia), the country submitted its first entry, \\"Samo ti\\" (Само ти) sung by Kaliopi, for the 1996 edition. However, the country failed to qualify through the non-broadcast pre-selection round. Its efforts to enter the contest were again hindered in 1997, when another new system was introduced where countries with the lowest average scores over the previous four years were excluded from participating. The country made its debut in 1998, with Vlado Janevski's \\"Ne zori, zoro\\". The country's best result before 2019 (and the best result with its old name) was in 2006, when Elena Risteska sang \\"Ninanajna\\" (Нинанајна) in Athens, Greece and came 12th. It is the only country to have qualified from every semi-final from 2004 to 2007 (other countries have qualified for every final but due to them finishing in the top 10 the previous year, they did not have to compete in the semi-final). Despite never finishing in the top 10, their record of qualifying for every final was only broken in 2008, when the jury vote used in the semi-final chose Sweden as a finalist, despite Tamara, Vrčak and Adrian having come 10th in the televote. Since then, only in 2012 did they make the final. Macedonian Radio Television, which broadcasts the event, has used the Skopje Fest festival to select the national entry since the country's debut, although it made several changes in the national final format, so the 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, and 2012 national finals were organised outside the Skopje Festival. For 2019, the country competed for the first time under its new name, North Macedonia. MRT selected Tamara Todevska as their act of choice, performing the song \\"Proud\\". The song managed to qualify through the second semifinal, and reached seventh place in the final, winning the international jury vote. This is the first top ten placement for the country, and also broke the record as the highest place ever for North Macedonia in the history of the contest. == Contestants == {| class=\\"wikitable\\" style=\\"font-size:90%;\\" |+Table key |- |width=15px bgcolor=silver| |Second place |- |style=\\"background:#A4EAA9\\"| |Entry selected but did not compete |} {|class=\\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"width:100%\\" !width=30px|Year !Artist !Language !Title !width=50px|Final !width=50px|Points !width=50px|Semi !width=50px|Points |- !scope=\\"row\\"| |Kaliopi |Macedonian |\\"Samo ti\\" |colspan=\\"2\\" |align=center|26 |align=center|14 |- !scope=\\"row\\"| |Vlado Janevski |Macedonian |\\"Ne zori, zoro\\" |align=center|19 |align=center|16 |rowspan=\\"3\\" colspan=\\"2\\" |- !scope=\\"row\\"| |XXL |Macedonian, English |\\"100% te ljubam\\" |align=center|15 |align=center|29 |- !scope=\\"row\\"| |Karolina |Macedonian |\\"Od nas zavisi\\" |align=center|19 |align=center|25 |- !scope=\\"row\\"| |Toše Proeski |English |\\"Life\\" |align=center|14 |align=center|47 |align=center|10 |align=center|71 |- !scope=\\"row\\"| |Martin Vučić |English |\\"Make My Day\\" |align=center|17 |align=center|52 |align=center|9 |align=center|97 |- !scope=\\"row\\"| |Elena Risteska |English, Macedonian |\\"Ninanajna\\" |align=center|12 |align=center|56 |align=center|10 |align=center|76 |- !scope=\\"row\\"| |Karolina |Macedonian, English |\\"Mojot svet\\" |align=center|14 |align=center|73 |align=center|9 |align=center|97 |- !scope=\\"row\\"| |Tamara, Vrčak and Adrian |English |\\"Let Me Love You\\" |colspan=\\"2\\" rowspan=\\"4\\" |align=center|10 |align=center|64 |- !scope=\\"row\\"| |Next Time |Macedonian |\\"Nešto što kje ostane\\" |align=center|10 |align=center|45 |- !scope=\\"row\\"| |Gjoko Taneski, Billy Zver & Pejčin |Macedonian |\\"Jas ja imam silata\\" |align=center|15 |align=center|37 |- !scope=\\"row\\"| |Vlatko Ilievski |Macedonian, English |\\"Rusinka\\" |align=center|16 |align=center|36 |- !scope=\\"row\\"| |Kaliopi |Macedonian |\\"Crno i belo\\" |align=center|13 |align=center|71 |align=center|9 |align=center|53 |- !scope=\\"row\\"| |Esma & Lozano |Macedonian, Romani |\\"Pred da se razdeni\\" |colspan=\\"2\\" rowspan=\\"6\\" |align=center|16 |align=center|28 |- !scope=\\"row\\"| |Tijana |English |\\"To the Sky\\" |align=center|13 |align=center|33 |- !scope=\\"row\\"| |Daniel Kajmakoski |English |\\"Autumn Leaves\\" |align=center|15 |align=center|28 |- !scope=\\"row\\"| |Kaliopi |Macedonian |\\"Dona\\" |align=center|11 |align=center|88 |- !scope=\\"row\\"| |Jana Burčeska |English |\\"Dance Alone\\" |align=center|15 |align=center|69 |- !scope=\\"row\\"| |Eye Cue |English |\\"Lost and Found\\" |align=center|18 |align=center|24 |- !scope=\\"row\\"| |Tamara Todevska |English |\\"Proud\\" |align=center|7 |align=center|305 |bgcolor=\\"silver\\" align=center|2 |bgcolor=\\"silver\\" align=center|239 |-bgcolor=\\"#A4EAA9\\" !scope=\\"row\\"| |Vasil |English |\\"You\\" |colspan=\\"4\\" X |} ==AwardsBarbara Dex Award=== {|class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"font-size:95%;\\" !Year !Performer !Host city ! |- !scope=\\"row\\"| |Martin Vučić | Kyiv | |- !scope=\\"row\\"| |Eye Cue | Lisbon | |} ==Related involvementCommentators and spokespersons=== {|class=\\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"font-size:90%;\\" |- !Year !Commentator !Spokesperson !class=\\"unsortable\\"| |- !scope=\\"row\\"| |John Ilija Apelgren ||rowspan=\\"6\\" || |- !scope=\\"row\\"| |Antonio Dimitrievski and Ivan Mircevski || |- !scope=\\"row\\"| |Milanka Rašik || |- !scope=\\"row\\"| |rowspan=\\"2\\"|Vlado Janevski || |- !scope=\\"row\\"| | |- !scope=\\"row\\"| |Dragan B.

The projects ranged from special one-time events to local improvement projects. In Vancouver, Stuart Lefeaux, superintendent of the Vancouver Park Board and his deputy Bill Livingstone wanted to create an exciting icon that would enhance the image of the city. Their vision was to build a conservatory for exotic plants that would be both educational and a good place for families to go. Building a conservatory on top of Queen Elizabeth Park's Little Mountain was a complicated project. The city had already leased the top of the mountain to the Greater Vancouver Water Board and they had built a -acre open water reservoir for the city's potable water supply. A concrete lid was constructed in 1965 to cover the reservoir, but approval was needed to build the conservatory's surrounding plaza on top of the cover. The project was not to detract from the natural beauty of the site, nor to jeopardize the quality of the potable water supply in the reservoir. Climates had to be simulated for temperate, tropical and arid areas in the botanical displays inside the conservatory, and the project was not to exceed the budget. Giving the immense concrete plaza over the reservoir an attractive garden atmosphere meant working within rigid and expensive water board restrictions. These challenges were overcome, and the conservatory was constructed next to this reservoir, which remains a major source of water for the city today. Philanthropy from extraction companies was at an all-time high during the 1960s, so Lefeux and Livingstone looked for a way to get the project funded. They approached Prentice Bloedel of the Macmillan Bloedel Lumber Company. The Bloedel Foundation put forward $1.25 million in conjunction with contributions by the City of Vancouver and the Vancouver Board of Parks and Recreation to build the Bloedel Conservatory, the Dancing Fountains and the surrounding plaza. This gift was the largest the city of Vancouver had received to that date. The triodetic dome frame was manufactured entirely in Ottawa and shipped 3,000 miles across the country to Queen Elizabeth Park. Once it arrived, the structural framework was erected in just 10 days. The entire dome and plaza took 18 months to complete. The grand opening of the conservatory took place to much fanfare on December 6, 1969 and hosted over 500,000 people in its first year of operation. Prentice and his wife Virginia, both avid art collectors, also donated the monumental bronze sculpture 'Knife Edge - Two Piece' by famed artist Henry Moore. In November 2009, facing a large budget shortfall, the Vancouver Park Board voted in favour of closing the conservatory. The approximately $240,000 CDN annual operating budget, the need for a roof replacement and other major capital costs were cited by members of the board as reasons for the decision. The closure was to take effect on March 1, 2010, just after Vancouver had finished hosting the 2010 Winter Olympic and Paralympic Games. In response to the decision several groups formed in order to lobby both the board and city council. In early January 2010, a commissioner reported that attendance numbers were up sharply in December 2009 over December 2008 now that construction projects at the adjacent reservoir on Little Mountain and along Cambie Street, which started in 2003, had been completed. By the end of January, the Friends of the Bloedel Association had helped raise $80,000, and was projecting $250,000 by the proposed March closure. In late February, the park board voted to keep the facility open and asked for proposals on running it. On April 29, 2010, the Friends of the Bloedel Association and VanDusen Botanical Garden Association submitted a proposal to the Vancouver Park Board to run the Bloedel Conservatory as part of the VanDusen Botanical Gardens, and the conservatory remained open. At least one other proposal was received, but the joint proposal of the Friends of the Bloedel and the Association was approved by the Services and Budgets Committee of the Vancouver Park Board on July 20, 2010, and unanimously approved by the full Park Board on September 20, 2010. On May 29, 2013, the Friends of the Bloedel won the City of Vancouver Heritage Commission Award of Honour, which \\"denotes an outstanding contribution to heritage conservation in the City of Vancouver and recognizes the advocacy and successful efforts to save and revitalize landmark sites\\". The VanDusen Botanical Garden Association later changed their name to the Vancouver Botanical Gardens Association to reflect the additional management of Bloedel Conservatory. ==Plants and animals== The conservatory contains three habitats: tropical rainforest, subtropical rainforest, and desert. Over 200 birds of various species reside within the dome and are allowed to fly free. Also on display are an array of tropical fish. The Bloedel Floral Conservatory houses about 500 species and varieties of plants from deep jungle to desert clime, all within the dome. The conservatory is home to Bougainvilleas and Browallias, citrus and coffee trees, Eucalypti and epiphytes, Euphorbia and various figs, Gardenia and Hibiscus. Magnolia trees share space with delicate lilies, yucca with pteris (ferns). ==Architecture== Located above sea level, the conservatory itself is in diameter, high, and is made up of 1,490 plexiglass bubbles and 2,324 pieces of extruded aluminum tubing. There are 32 different shapes and sizes, but each bubble measures 9 inches in height. It contains 8 air circulating units and 24 mist sprayers to control temperature and humidity for 3 separate climatic zones inside the dome. The Triodetic System was developed and patented in Canada in 1955 by F. Fentiman and Sons of Ottawa. This system was originally made from aluminum components. It uses extruded cylindrical solid aluminum hubs (nodes) with slots, and tubular aluminum or steel members with matching crimped ends. Triodetic joints resist tension, compression and combined cross loading. Triodetic domes are designed as double curved shells which allow increased structural advantages for the span:rise ratio. The use of triangles makes the structure rigid and very strong, and similar to the geodesic design, stresses are transmitted throughout the structure. Even with light structural components, triodetic domes are able to withstand extremes of wind and even earth quakes. This enables a large interior volume to be enclosed without the need for internal supporting columns. In the plaza adjacent to the conservatory dome is a bronze sculpture by Henry Moore, Knife Edge Two Piece 1962–65. It was donated to the Park Board by avid modern art collector Prentice Bloedel and his wife Virginia along with the funding to build the conservatory, the surrounding plaza and fountains. Moore created this piece in 1962, and authorized three castings of the work. The first stands on Nelson Rockefeller's New York estate, the second is outside the House of Lords, in London, England, and the third is situated to the south of the conservatory next to the Dancing Fountains. Knife Edge was the first non-commemorative sculpture accepted by the Vancouver Park Board. It was donated by Prentice Bloedel and his wife Virginia to tie the conservatory dome and the design of the adjacent fountain plaza to the inspiration and power of nature. ==Photo gallery== File:Bloedel with fountains.jpg|Bloedel Floral Conservatory dome seen from the grounds File:Bloedel exotic plants.jpg|Jungle environment within the dome File:Bloedel exotic plants2.jpg File:Bloedel exotic birds.jpg ==Filming location== The conservatory has been used as a filming location for several movies and science fiction series including G-Saviour, Battlestar Galactica, Stargate SG-1, Gene Roddenberry's Andromeda and Beyond the Black Rainbow. Filming of a scene from episode 21, Season 3 of Supergirl also took place here. ==See also== * List of botanical gardens in Canada ==ReferencesExternal links== * * Friends of the Bloedel * Vancouver Botanical Gardens Association Category:Gardens in Canada Category:Culture of Vancouver Category:Aviaries in Canada Category:Tourist attractions in Vancouver Category:Botanical gardens in Canada Category:Greenhouses in Canada Category:Buildings and structures in Vancouver ","title":"Bloedel Floral Conservatory"},{"id":"1998170","text":"Paleogenetics is the study of the past through the examination of preserved genetic material from the remains of ancient organisms. Emile Zuckerkandl and the physical chemist Linus Carl Pauling introduced the term \\"paleogenetics\\" in 1963, in reference to the examination of possible applications in the reconstruction of past polypeptide sequences. The first sequence of an ancient DNA, isolated from a museum specimen of the extinct quagga, was published in 1984 by a team led by Allan Wilson. Paleogeneticists do not recreate actual organisms, but piece together ancient DNA sequences using various analytical methods. Fossils are \\"the only direct witnesses of extinct species and of evolutionary events\\" and finding DNA within those fossils allows for a deeper examination of these events. ==ApplicationsEvolution=== Similar sequences are often found along protein polypeptide chains in different species. This similarity is directly linked to the sequence of the DNA (the genetic material of the organism). Due to the improbability of this being random chance, and its consistency too long to be attributed to convergence by natural selection, these similarities can be plausibly linked to the existence of a common ancestor with common genes. This allows polypeptide sequences to be compared between species, and the difference between two genetic sequences can be used to determine – within error – the time at which a common ancestor existed. ====Human evolution==== Using the thigh bone of a Neanderthal female, 63% of the Neanderthal genome was uncovered and 3.7 billion bases of DNA were decoded. It showed that Homo neanderthalensis was the closest living relative of Homo sapiens, until the former lineage died out 30,000 years ago. The Neanderthal genome was shown to be within the range of variation of those of anatomically modern humans, although at the far periphery of that range of variation. Paleogenetic analysis also suggests that Neanderthals shared more DNA with chimpanzees than homo sapiens. It was also found that Neanderthals were less genetically diverse than modern humans are, which indicates that Homo neanderthalensis grew from a group composed of relatively few individuals. DNA sequences suggest that Homo sapiens first appeared between about 130,000 and 250,000 years ago in Africa. Paleogenetics opens up many new possibilities for the study of hominid evolution and dispersion. By analyzing the genomes of hominid remains, their lineage can be traced back to from where they came, or from where they share a common ancestor. The Denisova hominid, a species of hominid found in Siberia from which DNA was able to be extracted, may show signs of having genes that are not found in any Neanderthal nor Homo sapiens genome, possibly representing a new lineage or species of hominid. ===Evolution of culture=== Looking at DNA can give insight into lifestyles of people of the past. Neandertal DNA shows that they lived in small temporary communities. DNA analysis can also show dietary restrictions and mutations, such as the fact that Homo neanderthalensis was lactose-intolerant. ==ArchaeologyAncient disease=== Studying DNA of the deceased also allows us to look at the medical history of the human species. By looking back we can discover when certain diseases first appeared and began to afflict humans. ====Ötzi==== The oldest case of Lyme disease was discovered in the genome on a man called Ötzi the Iceman. Ötzi died around 3,300 B.C., and his remains were discovered in the Eastern Alps in the early 1990s. An analysis of his genes was not run until 20 years later. Genetic remains of the bacterium that cause Lyme disease, Borrelia burgdorferi, were discovered in genetic material from Ötzi. ===Domestication of animals=== Not only can past humans be investigated through paleogenetics, but the organisms they had an effect on can also be examined. Through examination of the divergence found in domesticated species such as cattle and the archaeological record from their wild counterparts; the effect of domestication can be studied, which could tell us a lot about the behaviors of the cultures that domesticated them. The genetics of these animals also reveals traits not shown in the paleontological remains, such as certain clues as to the behavior, development, and maturation of these animals. The diversity in genes can also tell where the species were domesticated, and how these domesticates migrated from these locations elsewhere. ==Challenges== Ancient remains usually contain only a small fraction of the original DNA present in an organism.Kaplan, Matt. DNA has a 521-year half-life. Nature News, 10 October 2012. This is due to the degradation of DNA in dead tissue by biotic and abiotic factors once repair enzymes present in living tissue cease to be functional. DNA preservation is dependent on a number of environmental characteristics, including temperature, humidity, oxygen and sunlight. Remains from regions with high heat and humidity typically contain less intact DNA than those from permafrost or caves, where remains may persist in cold, low oxygen conditions for several hundred thousand years.Wickman, Forrest. What’s the Shelf-Life of DNA? Slate, 5 February 2013. In addition, DNA degrades much more quickly following excavation of materials, and freshly excavated bone has a much higher chance of containing viable genetic material. After excavation, bone may also become contaminated with modern DNA (i.e. from contact with skin or unsterilized tools), which can create false-positive results. ==See also== * Ancient DNA * Ancient pathogen genomics * Archaeogenetics * Molecular clock * Paleobiochemistry * Paleovirology ==References== Genetics ","title":"Paleogenetics"},{"id":"1998177","text":"Gertrude Melville (1884-1959) NSW Labor politician, c1952 Gertrude Mary Melville (née Day; 7 October 1884 - 21 August 1959) was an Australian politician of the Labor Party.

In the periods of 1922–26 and 1950–52, she was a member of the party's central executive committee. She stood as an ALP candidate for the Eastern Suburbs district in the 1925 NSW election, but was unsuccessful. She was again unsuccessful in 1932 election for Hurstville. Throughout the 1940s, she worked as a justice of the peace, a member of the New South Wales Board of Health, an alderman of the Cabramatta and Canley Vale municipal council, vice-president of the Country Women's Association's Cabramatta branch, and director of Fairfield Hospital. She was Mayor of Cabramatta–Canley Vale from 1945 to 1948. In 1952 Melville was nominated by Labor to fill a vacancy in the New South Wales Legislative Council caused by the death of Liberal member Ernest Farrar. At the time seats in the Council were elected at a joint sitting of both houses of parliament. Melville was re-elected a twelve year term in 1957. In her five years in the Council, she earned a reputation as the \\"grand old lady of the Labor Party\\". She dedicated her time in parliament to being a \\"spokesman for the women\\" and \\"the little people\\", supporting equal pay for women, child welfare, housing and hospitals. She died on 21 August 1959 in Little Bay, Sydney, and was buried in Randwick. ==References== Category:1884 births Category:1959 deaths Category:Members of the New South Wales Legislative Council Category:Politicians from Sydney Category:Australian Labor Party members of the Parliament of New South Wales Category:20th-century Australian politicians Category:20th-century women politicians Category:Women members of the New South Wales Legislative Council Category:19th-century Australian women Category:20th-century Australian women ","title":"Gertrude Melville"},{"id":"1998179","text":"Tanker Oliva offloading at LOOP. LOOP Pumping Platform Complex. The Louisiana Offshore Oil Port (LOOP) is a deepwater port in the Gulf of Mexico 29 kilometers (18 nautical miles) off the coast of Louisiana near the town of Port Fourchon. LOOP provides tanker offloading and temporary storage services for crude oil transported on some of the largest tankers in the world. Most tankers offloading at LOOP are too large for U.S. inland ports. LOOP handles 13 percent of the nation's foreign oil, about a day, and connects by pipeline to 50 percent of the U.S. refining capability. ==Description== Tankers offload at LOOP by pumping crude oil through hoses connected to a Single Buoy Mooring (SBM) base. Three SPMs are located 8,000 feet (2.4 km) from the Marine Terminal. The SPMs are designed to handle ships up to 700,000 deadweight tons (635,000 metric tonnes). The crude oil then moves to the Marine Terminal via a 56-inch (1.4 m) diameter submarine pipeline. The Marine Terminal consists of a control platform and a pumping platform. The control platform is equipped with a helicopter pad, living quarters, control room, vessel traffic control station, offices and life support equipment. The pumping platform contains four 7,000-hp (5 MW) pumps, power generators, metering and laboratory facilities. Crude oil is only handled on the pumping platform where it is measured, sampled, and boosted to shore via a 48-inch (1.2 m) diameter pipeline. The distance to shore puts LOOP outside U.S. territorial waters, and special agreements in international sea law are made to allow ships from other countries to come under U.S. jurisdiction to visit LOOP. ===Onshore=== LOOP's onshore facilities, Fourchon Booster Station and Clovelly Dome Storage Terminal, are located just on-shore in Fourchon and 25 miles (40.2 km) inland near Galliano, Louisiana. The Fourchon Booster Station has four 6,000-hp (4.5 MW) pumps which increase the pressure and crude oil flow en route to the Clovelly Dome Storage Terminal. ===Storage=== The Clovelly Dome Storage Terminal is used to store crude oil in underground salt domes before it is shipped to the various refineries. The terminal consists of eight caverns with a total capacity of , a pump station with four 6,000-hp pumps, meters to measure the crude oil receipts and deliveries, and a Brine Storage Reservoir. The brine reservoir is supersaturated with salts so as to prevent further degradation of the massive salt dome in which the eight caverns store the crude. This is because the supersaturated brine is much more dense than the crude oil, and as it is pumped into the caverns to push the crude to the surface and into the surface distribution systems. This results in virtually no loss of quality to the crude oil offload. ==References== * ==Further reading== * Read, William B.

Deitch Projects had a gallery and project space at 76 Grand Street and 18 Wooster Street in SoHo, and previously an additional in Long Island City.Geraldine Baum (January 19, 2010), Jeffrey Deitch on to another art adventure at MOCA, Los Angeles Times. ==History== From 1988 to 1996, Jeffrey Deitch had been a private dealer and art adviser to a number of collectors.Calvin Tomkins (November 12, 2007), A Fool for Art – Jeffrey Deitch and the exuberance of the art market, The New Yorker. Since opening with a performance by Vanessa Beecroft in February 1996, Deitch Projects presented nearly one hundred and eighteen solo exhibitions and projects, ten thematic exhibitions, and a number of public events. It is known as the gallery where many of the most well-known artists of the 90s and early 2000s—Cecily Brown, Inka Essenhigh, Barry McGee, Swoon and Kristin Baker to name a few—began their careers. In 2009, artists Justin Lowe and Jonah Freeman transformed the gallery into a Gothic warren of rooms populated with gurgling beakers and melting toilets for a piece called Black Acid Co-op.Candace Jackson (January 12, 2010), Deitch to Head L.A. Museum of Contemporary Art, The Wall Street Journal. That same year, Deitch Projects and Goldman Properties organized the ambitious public project The Wynwood Walls, for which 15 artists created 11 permanent murals throughout Miami's Wynwood district. In addition to its projects with emerging artists, the gallery actively produced exhibitions and books with more established artists who have been part of Jeffrey Deitch's circle since the mid-1970s and early 1980s. In 2007, the gallery produced a book and exhibition on Jean-Michel Basquiat's work in the transitional year of 1981, when he went from working on street to working in the studio.About Deitch Projects Deitch Projects, New York. The gallery also represented the estate of late artist Keith Haring, with whom Deitch worked closely in the 1980s. In 1997 Sotheby's purchased a 50% interest in Deitch Projects.Kate Taylor (April 16, 2007), Auction Houses Vs. Dealers, The New York Sun. Under the two companies' agreement, besides running his galleries, Jeffrey Deitch worked at the auction house managing its 20th-century Art Gallery Program for a few years.Carol Vogel (January 10, 2010), New Chief to Be Named for Los Angeles Museum, The New York Times. Sotheby's later announced that it would close the previously acquired André Emmerich Gallery, and that the gallery's artists would be handled out of Deitch Projects.Carol Vogel (October 16, 1998), Emmerich Loses Estate, The New York Times. As a response, the Josef and Anni Albers Foundation, the main beneficiary of the artists' estates, as well as the estates of Morris Louis and Milton Avery announced that they would not renew their Emmerich contracts.Carol Vogel (October 3, 1997), Sotheby's Loses Albers Estate, The New York Times. Sotheby's subsequently sold its share in Deitch Projects back to Jeffrey Deitch. The gallery closed in Summer 2010 as Jeffrey Deitch went on to lead the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles (MOCA). After his three-year tenure at the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art from 2010 to 2013, Deitch moved back to his New York spaces, reopening them as part of Jeffrey Deitch Gallery.\\"Jeffrey Deitch on His Grand Return to His Storied SoHo Space\\" by Nate Freeman, ARTnews, September 14, 2015 In 2014, Jeffrey Deitch published Live the Art on the 15-year history of Deitch Projects. ==Exhibitions 1996 === * Vanessa Beecroft, VB16 Piano Americano-Beige, January 6–27, 76 Grand Street. * Jocelyn Taylor, Alien at Rest, February 1–24, 76 Grand Street. * Nari Ward, Happy Smilers, March 7–April 6, 76 Grand Street. * Mariko Mori, Made in Japan, April 11–27, 76 Grand Street. * Chen Zhen, Daily Incantations, May 4–June 8, 76 Grand Street. * Shopping, curated with Jérôme Sans, September 5–21, 76 Grand Street and 26 shops around SoHo. * Jessica Diamond, Tributes to Kusama, October 5–26, 76 Grand Street. * Teresita Fernández, November 2-30, 76 Grand Street. * Cody Choi, The Thinker, December 7 1996–January 4 1997, 76 Grand Street. === 1997 === * Emiko Kasahara, Immaculate Fabrication, January 11–February 1, 76 Grand Street. * Beth B, Portraits & Playthings, February 6–March 8, 76 Grand Street. * Cecily Brown, Spectacle, February 6–March 8, 76 Grand Street. * Cerith Wyn Evans, March 15–April 5, 76 Grand Street. * Oleg Kulik, I Bite America and America Bites Me, April 12–26, 76 Grand Street. * Valie Export, Images of Contact, April 12–May 7, 76 Grand Street. * Nedko Solakov, Somewhere (under the tree), May 3–June 7, 76 Grand Street. * Bernadette Corporation, Hell on Earth: Collection Fall/Winter 1997, May 9, 18 Wooster Street. * Noritoshi Hirakawa, Garden of Nirvana, May 10–June 7, 76 Grand Street. * Johan Grimonprez, Dial H-I-S-T-O-R-Y, September 6–27, 76 Grand Street. * Stefan Hablutzel, 1962/1929, October 4–25, 76 Grand Street. * Montien Boonma, House of Hope, October 4–25, 76 Grand Street. * Shahzia Sikander, Murals and Miniatures, November 1–29, 76 Grand Street. * Barbara Kruger, Power Pleasure Desire Disgust, November 1–December 20, 18 Wooster Street. === 1998 === * Alexandros Psychoulis, There is no place far enough for you to escape from images and the pain they caused you, January 15–February 7, 76 Grand Street. *Daisuke Nakayama, February 11–March 14, 76 Grand Street. *Y.

It closed in 2014. The theater, which seats 4,600, regularly hosted touring productions of Broadway musicals, concerts, seminars, comedy acts, and high school graduations and commencement ceremonies for Atlanta's John Marshall Law School. In addition to performances, the civic center could host conferences and exhibits as well, with 5,800 square feet (540 m²) of meeting space. The civic center was owned and operated by the Atlanta city government’s Department of Parks, Recreation and Cultural Affairs, but brought in enough revenue to be self-supporting. ==History== The Atlanta Civic Center was built in 1967 on the site of Ripley Street and part of Currier Street in the Buttermilk Bottom community. It was partly built as the city's convention center, a role now largely filled by the state-run Georgia World Congress Center . It once hosted the annual Spring Tour of the Metropolitan Opera and served as the home of \\"Theatre of the Stars\\", a summer series of Broadway musicals featuring well-known stars of the entertainment industry. The Balanchine production of \\"The Nutcracker\\" was performed there annually for several years. The Civic Center also served as the site for the 1996 Summer Olympics cultural program. In 2000, it hosted the Jeopardy! Tournament of Champions with Georgian Robin Carroll winning. The Atlanta Civic Center underwent a $2 million renovation in 2001 and added \\"Boisfeuillet Jones\\" to its name in honor of Atlanta businessman and philanthropist Boisfeuillet Jones, Sr.. In 2003, the Civic Center became the host for the Atlanta Opera, which moved to the Cobb Energy Center in suburban Cobb County in 2007. The back parking lot was where the 99x stage was located during the Music Midtown Festival. During the 2002 festival, Turner South hosted an indoor televised concert. On July 22, 2005 it hosted President George W. Bush when he spoke to an invitation-only crowd about changes in Medicare. He was introduced by Governor Sonny Perdue and also accompanied by his mother Barbara Bush and U.S. Senators Saxby Chambliss and Johnny Isakson. In May 2007 it was revealed that the city was considering demolition of the facility, in addition to the neighboring SciTrek, replacing them with a new performing arts center. SciTrek did close but the Civic Center is still in operation. In 2008, the Peachtree Road Race stage and finish festival were moved here when Piedmont Park was deemed off-limits because of drought conditions, as were other large events normally held in Piedmont Park such as Atlanta Pride. On October 18, 2008 the Center hosted the 2008 BET Hip Hop Awards. Soon the museum will be temporarily showing Egyptian treasures especially King Tutankhamun. In April 2011, in honor of the Atlanta Georgia Temple rededication, over 2,000 youth of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) performed in a youth cultural celebration entitled \\"Southern Lights\\". Church president Thomas S. Monson enjoyed the performance along with other Church leaders, including Elder M. Russell Ballard, Walter F. González and William R. Walker.

Control of the region of Commagene was apparently held by the Orontid dynasty since the 3rd century BCE, who also ruled over Armenia and Sophene. These seem to have held Commagene continuously from the time of Sames I, as the later kings of Commagene of the 2nd century BCE traced their lineage back to them. King Antichos III was the last effective ruler,Chahin, Mark (2001). The Kingdom of Armenia. Routledge. pp. 190–191. . and his death cause a political crisis of succession into which Rome intervened in 72 AD.Tacitus, The Annals 2.42. Depiction of the Byzantine attack on Samosata in 859, from the Madrid Skylitzes It was at Samosata that Julian II had ships made in his expedition against Shapur II, and it was a natural crossing-place in the struggle between Heraclius and Chosroes in the 7th century. Samosata was the birthplace of several renowned people from antiquities such as Lucian (c. 120-192) and Paul of Samosata (fl. 260). ===Medieval history=== The Arabs took the city from the Byzantines. Safwan bin Muattal died and is buried in Samsat. The 13th century was very hard for the town. Rüknettin Süleyman II of the Anatolian Seljuks captured Samsat in 1203, and it was looted in 1237 by the Harzemşah. Then it was invaded by the Mongol Emperor Hülagü Khan in 1240 and later also by the Dulkadiroğulları. It was absorbed into the Ottoman Empire by Yıldırım Beyazıt in 1392 and in 1401 it was destroyed by Timur. In 1516, the ottoman Sultan Selim I recaptured it for the Ottomans. It lost its old importance in the Ottoman administration and became the center of a sanjak. ===Modern times=== During the republican period, it the towns population decreased. In 1960, Samsat was transformed into a district center and connected to the province of Adıyaman. The city of Samsat was evacuated from the old settlement on 5 March 1988 due to the construction of the Atatürk Dam. A new location for the settlement was announced through the law No. 3433 dated 21 April 1988. The historical Samsat submerged in 1989 as the Atatürk Dam was filled with the water of the Euphrates river. The new town was built beside the new waterline by the Turkish government to house the displaced residents. === In Christianity === In the Christian martyrology, seven Christian martyrs were crucified in 297 in Samosata for refusing to perform a pagan rite in celebration of the victory of Maximian over the Sassanids: Abibus, Hipparchus, James, Lollian, Paragnus, Philotheus, and Romanus. Saint Daniel the Stylite was born in a village near Samosata; Saint Rabbulas, venerated on 19 February, who lived in the 6th century at Constantinople, was also a native of Samosata. A Notitia Episcopatuum of Antioch in the 6th century mentions Samosata as an autocephalous metropolis (Échos d'Orient, X, 144); at the synod that reinstated Patriarch Photius I of Constantinople (the Photian Council) of 879, the See of Samosata had already been united to that of Amida (Diyarbakır).Mansi, Conciliorum collectio, XVII-XVIII, 445. As in 586 the titular of Amida bears only this title (Le Quien, Oriens christianus, II, 994.), it must be concluded that the union took place between the 7th and the 9th centuries. Earlier bishops included Peperius, who attended the Council of Nicaea (325); Saint Eusebius of Samosata, a great opponent of the Arians, killed by an Arian woman (c. 380), honoured on 22 June; Andrew, a vigorous opponent of Cyril of Alexandria and of the Council of Ephesus.Le Quien, Oriens christianus, II, 933-6. Chabot gives a list of twenty-eight Syrian Miaphysite bishops.Revue de l'Orient chrétien, VI, 203. The Syrian bishopric probably lapsed in the 12th century.Fiey, J. M. (1993), Pour un Oriens Christianus novus; répertoire des diocèses Syriaques orientaux et occidentaux, Beirut, p. 263, Samosata is included in the Catholic Church's list of titular sees, but no further titular bishops have been appointed for that eastern see since the Second Vatican Council. ==Archaeology== Samsat Höyük is a tell located just north of the Samsat district of Adıyaman. Archaeological research on the hill of Şehremuz in Samsat has uncovered relics from the 7000 BC Paleolithic era; the 5000 BC Neolithic, 3000 BC Chalcolithic and 3000 to 1200 BC Bronze Ages. The ancient city of Ḫaḫḫum (Hittite: Ḫaḫḫa) was located nearby; it is recorded as a source of gold for ancient Sumeria. The first excavations were conducted in 1964 and 1967 under the direction of T. Goell. In fact, the settlement was known and famous before these excavations. Then, in 1977, under the Lower Euphrates Project, which was aimed at identifying and saving the archaeological settlements that will remain within the water collection area of Karakaya and Atatürk Dams. Surface surveys were conducted under the direction of Mehmet Özdoğan. In these studies, it was concluded that the settlement was permanently inhabited from the Halaf Period to the Ottoman Period. The following year, the excavations started in 1978, except for 1980, until 1987, Ankara University, Faculty of Language and History-Geography Professor. Dr. It was conducted by the team led by Nimet Özgüç. These excavations were carried out on a very wide area, including the lower city and surrounding walls.

SciTrek was incorporated in 1982, with an initial grant from the Metropolitan Foundation. The Metropolitan Foundation is a nonprofit corporation guided by a 31-member board of directors headed by Robert W. Scherer, the Georgia Power Co. chairman and chief executive officer. With help from the city of Atlanta, the city committed 96,000 square feet of the Atlanta Civic Center exhibition space to the Science and Technology Museum of Atlanta. The Robert W. Woodruff Foundation donated $1 million. After years of planning and fundraising SciTrek-The Science & Technology Museum of Atlanta finally opened its doors to the public on October 29, 1988.Gaus, Sharon. \\"SciTrek History.\\" The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, , sec. A15, Aug. 20, 2004. ===The early years=== SciTrek opened with 34 staffers, 150 volunteers, and a $2.5 million annual budget. During the three- day grand opening, 11,000 visitors toured the museum. By the end of its first full fiscal year, Scitrek reported 350,000 visitors to the museum. Museum organizers projected attendance would eventually reach 1 million. In 1991, SciTrek reported more than 750,000 visitors, most of whom were schoolchildren. In April 1997, Gwen Crider, former deputy director of the Smithsonian Institution's National Air and Space Museum, replaced Gene Brandt as president and executive director of SciTrek. In the October 2001 issue of Good Housekeeping magazine, SciTrek was named one of the country's 10 best science museums. Even after suffering a 24 percent drop-off in visitors between 1993 through 1999, SciTrek decided during the 1999 fiscal year to retire its long- standing debt of $3 million. On December 1, 2000, Lewis A. Massey, former Georgia secretary of state, took over as SciTrek president and chief executive officer. ===Troubled years=== By January 2001, SciTrek's finances were in dire condition, having lost $80,000 to $100,000 a month over the previous six months. The museum had a deficit for the previous three years, reaching $700,000 for fiscal 2000. The board extended a 90-day reprieve for SciTrek instead of closing it down immediately. By June 2001, the State of Georgia, which had provided an annual $175,000 grant to SciTrek, threw in an additional $300,000 to help keep the museum afloat. During August 2002 the following year the Georgia Assembly allocated $425,000 to SciTrek and began a capital campaign to help raise $5 million. In January 2003, the Challenger Learning Center, a $1.7 million simulated space shuttle mission, opened to the public. In December 2003, SciTrek named technology industry executive, Scott Coleman, as president and CEO, replacing Massey, who left to join a lobbying firm. In June 2003, the Georgia Department of Education budget for the 2004 fiscal year cut funding for SciTrek by 10 percent. ==Exhibits== SciTrek housed more than 140 exhibits appealing to all age ranges. The interactive displays offered visitors the opportunity to explore and discover the marvels of the scientific world, with a special Kidscape section specially designed for the two to seven years age group. The \\"Mathematica: A World of Numbers... and Beyond\\" exhibit detailed the major achievements in the history of mathematics from the twelfth century as well as explaining mathematical formulae including Kepler's laws of planetary motion and probability theory. Other exhibits focused on electricity generation in unusual ways, creating energy from magnetism, 'freezing shadows' or stepping inside a kaleidoscope. ==Programs and facilitiesChallenger Learning Center=== SciTrek's Challenger Learning Center is a $1.7 million, simulated NASA space shuttle mission which opened to the public in January 2003. Upon SciTrek's initial closure the Challenger Learning Center was put up for auction. Several museums and science centers expressed interest in acquiring the Challenger Learning Center for their facility. None of the entrusted facilities or museums were able to come up with the purchasing cost of $1.7 million. As a result, Challenger Learning Center, with its advanced computers and flight technology, was almost sent to the scrap yard. Turner Broadcasting System stepped in and raised the money needed to purchase SciTrek's Challenger Learning Center, which was relocated and donated to Atlanta's Fernbank Science Center. SciTrek's name, intellectual property, computers, materials from the Edison exhibit, science education curriculum and programs were transferred to Valdosta State University in 2005.

He followed up his sophomore year with a successful junior campaign, averaging 23.5 points and 10.5 rebounds and All-State honors. His senior year would be his most successful season as he led Delbarton to a 20–6 record and the state quarterfinals. For the season he averaged 33.0 points per game (on 56.8 percent shooting), to lead the state in scoring along with 14.8 rebounds and 3.2 blocks per game. At the end of the season he was named Morris County Player of the Year by the Newark Star-Ledger and the most valuable player for his team at the prestigious Capital Classic in Washington, D.C. ==College career== Murphy played college basketball at the University of Notre Dame. He led the Irish in scoring and rebounding in each of his three seasons, averaging 21.8 points and 9.2 rebounds during the 2000–01 campaign. A consensus first-team All-American as a junior and sophomore, he is one of 10 Irish players to earn consensus All-American honors (which includes six players named on more than one occasion). Murphy shared Big East Conference Player of the Year honors with Troy Bell of Boston College in 2001 and joined an elite group of four players—Chris Mullin (St. John's), Patrick Ewing (Georgetown) and Richard Hamilton (Connecticut)—as the only two-time winners of the award. He was named to the John R. Wooden Award All-America Team for the second consecutive year, finished fifth in the balloting for the Wooden Award and was among the top three finalists for the Naismith player-of-the- year honor. A first-team all-Big East selection for two seasons, Murphy also was named the Big East Rookie of the Year in 1999. He became just the fifth player in Notre Dame history to score more than 2,000 career points and finished his career fifth on the all-time scoring list with 2,011 points. Murphy is the only player to score more than 2,000 points and grab more than 900 rebounds (924) in 94 career games. He left Notre Dame with career averages of 21.4 points and 9.8 rebounds. Murphy was a starter in 93 games during his career and scored in double figures in 92 of those 94 contests. In addition to finishing fifth on the all-time career scoring list, upon his departure from the University, he ranked second in blocked shots (126), free throws made (587) and free throws attempted (755), sixth in rebounding and field goals made (680) and ninth in field goals attempted (1,370). On January 23, 2016, Murphy was inducted into Notre Dame's Ring of Honor. ==Professional careerGolden State Warriors=== Murphy was selected 14th overall in the 2001 NBA Draft by the Golden State Warriors. After starting slowly, he showed promise toward the end of the season. He realized this promise in his second pro season, averaging a double-double – 11.7 pts and 10.2 boards – and finishing second in Most Improved Player voting. He also started the Rookie Challenge as the Sophomores' power forward. However, his three-point shooting that was a huge part of his college success was nearly absent, as he only attempted 14 three-pointers during the year, making five. He spent the next offseason working extensively on his outside shooting; however, he never got much of a chance to test out his new jumper in 2003–04 after a series of injuries limited him to 28 games, with no starts. However, he did attempt 17 threes in those games. With that part of his arsenal seemingly ready to go, Murphy spent the following offseason working on strength and conditioning as he looked to be a more well-rounded and complete player.

Although Poland did not become a member of the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) until 1993, earlier contests had often been broadcast on Telewizja Polska (TVP), the Polish broadcaster. Poland's debut in the contest in remains its most successful entry, with Edyta Górniak finishing second. This remains Poland's only top five result in the contest. The country reached the top ten for the second time with Ich Troje finishing seventh in . Poland then failed to qualify from the semi-finals in six out of seven years between 2005 and 2011, before withdrawing from the contest in 2012 and 2013. Since returning in 2014, Poland had qualified for the final for four consecutive years (2014–2017), achieving a third top ten finish in , with Michał Szpak finishing eighth. Since 2018 the country failed to qualify two times in row (2018–2019) ==History== The first ever performance by Poland was at the 1994 contest: Edyta Górniak's song was also by far the most successful for Poland to date, receiving 166 points and placing second. Poland was almost disqualified that year though; there was no free-language rule in operation at the time, and a furor erupted at the dress rehearsal when Górniak sung the second half of \\"To nie ja!\\" in English. Six national delegations formally petitioned for Poland to be disqualified; however Eurovision rules required a majority of delegations (13 in this case) to complain before the European Broadcasting Union could examine the case for disqualification, so Poland was allowed to remain. The Polish entry for the 1995 contest was again selected through internally was Justyna Steczkowska with \\"Sama\\". Steczkowska could not replicate Górniak's 2nd place, receiving only 15 points and placing 18th. The 1996 entry was Kasia Kowalska with \\"Chcę znać swój grzech...\\". It placed 15th with 31 points. Poland competed in the 1997 competition with the song \\"Ale jestem\\" , was the first uptempo Polish entry, which was performed by Anna Maria Jopek .At the close of voting, it had received 54 points, placing 11th in a field of 25. In 1998 Poland was represented by band Sixteen they performed the song \\"To Takie Proste\\" in the final of the competition, finishing 17th of 25 entrants. in 1999 represented Poland with the song \\"Przytul mnie mocno\\",he also was the first man who represented his country. He placed 18th with 17 points. Poland returned to Eurovision following an enforced one-year absence 2002. For the 2003 contest Poland organized its first public selection for Eurovision entry; It was no surprise when the group Ich Troje won the public vote ahead of Blue Café, placing 7th of 26 countries in the final. This placing allowed Poland to skip the semi-final of the 2004 contest, automatically qualifying for the final. The Polish entry for the 2004 contest was again selected through National Final, the winner of Krajowe Eliminacje was Blue Café with \\"Love Song\\". Group could not replicate Ich Troje's 7th place, receiving only 27 points and placing 17th. In 2005 TVP went back to an internal selection, picking \\"Czarna dziewczyna\\", a multilingual song performed in Polish and Russian.Poland competed first time at the semi- final. The song just missed out on a place in the final, coming 11th in the semi-final with 81 points only 4-point behind Latvia. Poland's 2006 entry with the comeback of the public vote on TVP, Ich Troje were chosen again in 2006 with song \\"Follow My Heart\\", but could not repeat their 7th place from 2003 failed to qualify for the final, coming 11th with 70 points in the semi-final only 5-point behind Macedonia. Poland's 2007 entry, \\"Time To Party\\", sung by The Jet Set, only finished 14th in the semi-final. Poland's only appearance in the final between 2005 and 2011, was in 2008. Even then, its song (\\"For Life\\", sung by Isis Gee) only qualified as a jury wildcard and placed a lowly 24th in the final. In the 2009, Poland selected Lidia Kopania and her song \\"I Don't Wanna Leave\\" performed in the second semi-final on 14 May 2009, however she failed to qualify finished 12th with 43 points. The 2010 entry for Poland was Marcin Mroziński with song \\"Legenda\\", country performed in the first semi- final on 25 May 2010 but he didn't qualify for the final, finishing 13th with 44 points. In 2011, Poland was represented by Magdalena Tul, and the country's entry was sung in Polish. Her song was called \\"Jestem\\", translated as \\"I am\\", although initially a favorite with bookmakers, \\"Jestem\\" failed to qualify finished last 19th with 18 points in the first semi-final. This is the worst Polish result to date. Members of the Polish OGAE have said at their annual convention that they would like Edyta Górniak to represent Poland for a second time. For years it was unknown if Górniak would enter Eurovision again, until when in 2016 she made a second attempt at representing her country in the contest, placing third in the national final. ===2012–2013 absence=== In December 2011, it was announced that Poland would not compete at the Eurovision Song Contest 2012 in Baku. The Polish broadcaster stated that having to organize the European Football Championship 2012 (hosted by Poland and Ukraine) was a major factor in their non-participation. TVP informed esctoday.com that their decision to abstain would not hamper their chances of returning in . However, Poland confirmed on 22 November 2012 that it would not be participating in . ===Return=== TVP, the Polish national broadcaster has confirmed on 5 December 2013 that Poland will return to the Eurovision Song Contest in 2014.http://www.esctoday.com/69854/tvp- poland/http://www.tvp.pl/o-tvp/centrum-prasowe/komunikaty-prasowe/tvp-znow-w- konkursie-eurowizji/13230106 On 25 February, it was announced that Donatan and Cleo would represent Poland with their song \\"My Słowianie\\". They qualified for the final placing 8th with 70 points, making it only the second time Poland has qualified for the final since 2008. Donatan and Cleo performed 9th in the final and ended up placing 14th out of 26 with 62 points. The duo fared clearly better with the televoters, finishing third in the semi-final and 5th in the final respectively. In 2015 TVP has selected their entry internally again by choosing Monika Kuszyńska and her song \\"In The Name of Love\\". She was the first ever Eurovision participant to sit in a wheelchair during her performance, due to the fact that she was paralyzed after being involved in a serious car accident in 2006. Monika performed last in the second semi-final on 21 May 2015 and qualified for the final placing 8th with 57 points. In the final, she came 23rd out of 27 acts, receiving ten points. Alike Donatan and Cleo, she fared clearly better with the televoters, coming fourth in the semi- final and 15th in the final respectively. In 2016, TVP went back to conducting a national final, called Krajowe Eliminacje, with Michał Szpak winning. Szpak performed second in the second semi-final on 12 May 2016, and qualified for the final by finishing in sixth place, with 151 points. In the final, held on 14 May 2016, he performed 12th and placed 8th out of 26 acts, with 229 points, which gave Poland their third best result ever. In 2017, TVP decided to host the second edition of the national final, with Kasia Moś and her song \\"Flashlight\\" winning. Moś performed 11th in the first semi-final on 9 May 2017. She qualified for the final placing 9th with 119 points. In the final, held on 13 May 2017, she performed 2nd and came 22nd out of 26 acts with 64 points total. Poland's run of qualifications came to an end in 2018, when the song \\"Light Me Up\\" by Polish DJ Gromee and Swedish vocalist Lukas Meijer, again chosen during the national final, failed to qualify to the final by placing 14th with 81 points in the second semi-final. It is the first Polish entry since its return to the contest in 2014, to not qualify for the final. In 2019, TVP returned to internal selection, after a successful internal choice of Roksana Węgiel for Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2018. On 15 February 2019 it was announced that TVP has chosen Tulia for the Polish representative to Tel Aviv. However Poland failed to qualify for the grand final by placing 11th with 120 points in the first semi-final only 2-point behind Belarus. In 2020, TVP used the talent show Szansa na sukces to select the Polish artist and song, having used the show to select the song \\"Superhero\\" performed by Viki Gabor for the Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2019, winning the contest. Alicja won the national final with the song \\"Empires\\", winning both the public and the jury vote, the contest was cancelled due to the pandemic of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). == Contestants == {|class=\\"wikitable\\" |+Table key |- |bgcolor=silver| |Second place |- |bgcolor=#FE8080| |Last place |- |bgcolor=#A4EAA9| |Entry selected but did not compete |} {|class=\\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"width:100%\\" !width=30px|Year !Artist !Language !Title !width=50px|Final !width=50px|Points !width=50px|Semi !width=50px|Points |-style=\\"background:silver;\\" !scope=\\"row\\"| |Edyta Górniak |Polish |\\"To nie ja!\\" |align=center|2 |align=center|166 |rowspan=\\"2\\" colspan=\\"2\\" data-sort- value=\\"99999\\" |- !scope=\\"row\\"| |Justyna Steczkowska |Polish |\\"Sama\\" |align=center|18 |align=center|15 |- !scope=\\"row\\"| |Kasia Kowalska |Polish |\\"Chcę znać swój grzech...\\" |align=center|15 |align=center|31 |align=center|15 |align=center|42 |- !scope=\\"row\\"| |Anna Maria Jopek |Polish |\\"Ale jestem\\" |align=center|11 |align=center|54 |rowspan=\\"5\\" colspan=\\"2\\" data-sort- value=\\"99999\\" |- !scope=\\"row\\"| |Sixteen |Polish |\\"To takie proste\\" |align=center|17 |align=center|19 |- !scope=\\"row\\"| |Mietek Szcześniak |Polish |\\"Przytul mnie mocno\\" |align=center|18 |align=center|17 |- !scope=\\"row\\"| |Andrzej Piaseczny |English |\\"2 Long\\" |align=center|20 |align=center|11 |- !scope=\\"row\\"| |Ich Troje |German, Polish, Russian |\\"Keine Grenzen – Żadnych granic\\" |align=center|7 |align=center|90 |- !scope=\\"row\\"| |Blue Café |English, Spanish |\\"Love Song\\" |align=center|17 |align=center|27 |colspan=\\"2\\" data-sort- value=\\"-9999\\" |- !scope=\\"row\\"| |Ivan & Delfin |Polish, Russian |\\"Czarna dziewczyna\\" |colspan=\\"2\\" rowspan=\\"3\\" |align=center|11 |align=center|81 |- !scope=\\"row\\"| |Ich Troje feat.

On display in the Ancient Agora Museum in Athens, housed in the Stoa of Attalos. Sundanese traditional granary, in West Java, Indonesia. A granary is a storehouse or room in a barn for threshed grain or animal feed. Ancient or primitive granaries are most often made out of pottery. Granaries are often built above the ground to keep the stored food away from mice and other animals. ==Early origins== From ancient times grain has been stored in bulk. The oldest granaries yet found date back to 9500 BC and are located in the Pre-Pottery Neolithic A settlements in the Jordan Valley. The first were located in places between other buildings. However beginning around 8500 BC, they were moved inside houses, and by 7500 BC storage occurred in special rooms. The first granaries measured 3 x 3 m on the outside and had suspended floors that protected the grain from rodents and insects and provided air circulation. These granaries are followed by those in Mehrgarh in the Indus Valley from 6000 BC. The ancient Egyptians made a practice of preserving grain in years of plenty against years of scarcity. The climate of Egypt being very dry, grain could be stored in pits for a long time without discernible loss of quality. Historically, a silo was a pit for storing grain. It is distinct from a granary, which is an above-ground structure. ==East Asia== Han dynasty granary on Silk Road west of Dunhuang Meiji period granary, Setagaya, Tokyo Simple storage granaries raised up on four or more posts appeared in the Yangshao culture in China and after the onset of intensive agriculture in the Korean peninsula during the Mumun pottery period (c. 1000 B.C.) as well as in the Japanese archipelago during the Final Jōmon/Early Yayoi periods (c. 800 B.C.). In the archaeological vernacular of Northeast Asia, these features are lumped with those that may have also functioned as residences and together are called 'raised floor buildings'. ==Southeast Asia== Minangkabau architectural style in Batipuh in the Padang Plateau, Sumatra In vernacular architecture of Indonesian archipelago granaries are made of wood and bamboo materials and most of them are built raised up on four or more posts to avoid rodents and insects. Examples of Indonesian granary styles are the Sundanese leuit and Minang rangkiang. ==Great Britain== A granary sitting on staddle stones, at the Somerset Rural Life Museum In Great Britain small granaries were built on mushroom-shaped stumps called staddle stones. They were built of timber frame construction and often had slate roofs. Larger ones were similar to linhays, but with the upper floor enclosed. Access to the first floor was usually via stone staircase on the outside wall. The Barn Guide by South Hams District Council Towards the close of the 19th century, warehouses specially intended for holding grain began to multiply in Great Britain. There are climatic difficulties in the way of storing grain in Great Britain on a large scale, but these difficulties have been largely overcome. ==Modern== Modern grain farming operations often use manufactured steel granaries to store grain on- site until it can be trucked to major storage facilities in anticipation of shipping. The large mechanized facilities, particularly seen in Russia and North America are known as grain elevators. == Moisture control == Grain must be kept away from moisture for as long as possible to preserve it in good condition and prevent mold growth. Newly harvested grain brought into a granary tends to contain excess moisture, which encourages mold growth leading to fermentation and heating, both of which are undesirable and affect quality. Fermentation generally spoils grain and may cause chemical changes that create poisonous mycotoxins. One traditional remedy is to spread the grain in thin layers on a floor, where it is turned to aerate it thoroughly. Once the grain is sufficiently dry it can be transferred to a granary for storage. Today, this can be done by means of a mechanical grain auger to move grain from one granary to another. In modern silos, grain is typically force-aerated in situ or circulated through external grain drying equipment. ==See also== *Hórreo *Raccard *Storage silo *Corn crib *Groote Schuur, the stately South African home was originally a granary. *Rice barn *Treppenspeicher *Ghorfa *Parish granary == References == Category:Containers Category:Grain production Category:Rooms Category:Vernacular architecture ","title":"Granary"},{"id":"1998283","text":"Margaret Edgeworth David McIntyre, (28 November 1886 – 2 September 1948) was the first woman elected to the Parliament of Tasmania, representing the seat of Cornwall in the Legislative Council. ==Life and career== McIntyre was born in Maitland, New South Wales.

In 1948 she was elected as an independent candidate for the seat of Cornwall, becoming the first woman in the Tasmanian Legislative Council. Six months after her election, while returning from a National Council of Women of Australia Conference in Brisbane, she was killed in the crash of the Lutana near Quirindi on 2 September 1948.

He graduated from the National Military College with a degree in civil engineering, was promoted as army major by 1921, and became a close associate of the War Minister, General Agustín Justo. Justo was elected president in 1932, and appointed Pistarini Minister of Public Works in 1935. Pistarini's his first important initiative as minister was the proposed construction of a new international airport outside Buenos Aires. He was promoted to the rank of general in 1937 and, between then and 1940, was stationed in Germany and Italy. Appointed Director of Army Engineers upon his return, Pistarini recommended German contractors for public works in Argentina and was open regarding his Nazi and Fascist sympathies.Newton, Ronald. The Nazi Menace in Argentina, 1931-47 Pistarini during remarks made for the opening of the Salta-Antofagasta railway between Argentina and Chile in 1948. His role in the 1943 coup d'état resulted in his appointment as director of the Campo de Mayo army training base. He was returned to the post of Minister of Public Works in March 1944 and served a brief, concurrent term as Vice President following the populist Juan Perón's dismissal. Pistarini was retained as Public Works Minister by Perón when the latter was elected president in 1946, in which capacity he administered Perón's ambitious public works agenda. He oversaw and helped plan the construction or development of modern barracks, Argentina's first expressways, numerous public vacation resorts, 11,000 schools, water treatment plants, a modern merchant marine, 650,000 housing units and the planting of two million trees, the nation's first international airport, among other works. He also marshaled the dormant National Mortgage Bank to extend subsidized loans to new homeowners, often at interest rates well below inflation. Ill health led to his retirement in June 1952 and following Perón's September 1955 overthrow, he had his property seized, was stripped of rank and imprisoned in Ushuaia. The sub-Antarctic climate in Ushuaia led to a worsening in Pistarini's health, and he was returned to Buenos Aires, where he died at a military hospital in 1956.Historical Dictionary of Argentina. London: Scarecrow Press, 1978. The Ministro Pistarini International Airport, opened in 1949 in Ezeiza, was named in his honor in 1985. ==ReferencesExternal links== Category:1882 births Category:1956 deaths Category:People from La Pampa Province Category:Argentine people of Italian descent Category:Vice Presidents of Argentina Category:Ministers of agriculture of Argentina Category:Government ministers of Argentina Category:Argentine generals Category:Argentine anti-communists Category:Argentine engineers Category:Colegio Militar de la Nación alumni Category:Burials at La Recoleta Cemetery Category:20th-century engineers ","title":"Juan Pistarini"},{"id":"1998292","text":"Antiseptic lavage is a means of washing, especially of a hollow organ, such as the stomach or lower bowel, with repeated injections of warm water mixed with an antiseptic or antifungal solution.

It is located in the parklands just north of the city centre of Adelaide, South Australia. It is administered by the Royal Zoological Society of South Australia Incorporated (trading as Zoos South Australia or Zoos SA), which is a full institutional member of the Zoo and Aquarium Association (ZAA) and the World Association of Zoos and Aquariums (WAZA), and which also administers the Monarto Safari Park near Murray Bridge. The zoo houses about 300 native and exotic species, with over 3,000 animals on site. The zoo's most recent enclosures are in the second phase of the South-East Asia exhibit, known as Immersion, providing visitors with the experience of walking through the jungle, with Sumatran tigers and orangutans seemingly within reach. Five buildings within the zoo have been listed as state heritage places on the South Australian Heritage Register, including the front entrance on Frome Road and the former Elephant House. The zoo is also a botanical garden and the grounds contain significant exotic and native flora, including a Moreton Bay fig planted in 1877. The giant panda exhibit, which opened in December 2009, is home to two giant pandas, Wang Wang and Funi, which will remain at the zoo until at least 2024.Pandas Wang Wang and Fu Ni remain at Adelaide Zoo, with China's blessing ABC News, 7 April 2019.

It was founded by the South Australian Acclimatization and Zoological Society.NLA Trove > Annual report of the South Australian Acclimatization and Zoological Society. Retrieved 20 September 2013.Adelaide Zoo >...> History Accessed 20 September 2013. The society later became the Royal Zoological Society of South Australia after a royal charter was granted by King George VI in 1937. The first director of the zoo (from 1882 to 1893) was R. E. Minchin. He was succeeded by his son A. C. Minchin (from 1893 to 1934), and grandson R. R. L. Minchin (from 1935 to 1940). Another grandson, Alfred Keith Minchin ran the private Koala Farm in the North Parklands from 1936 to 1960; the surplus koalas were set free on Kangaroo Island.Joyce Gibberd, \\"Minchin, Alfred Keith (1899–1963)\\", Australian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/minchin-alfred- keith-7796/text13273, published first in hardcopy 1986, accessed online 26 February 2015. In the mid-twentieth century the zoo was involved in the export of live birds, with 99% of Australia's exports of live native birds, mainly finches and parrots for aviculture, passing through either Adelaide or Taronga zoos. At a time when the need for conservation of Australia's native birds, and control of their trade was becoming increasingly apparent, South Australia lagged behind other states in passing appropriate legislation. In 1962 a new director of the zoo, William Gasking, was quickly dismissed through the power exerted by the Zoo Council president, Fred Basse, on the grounds that Gasking would not cooperate with the bird trade. However, when Basse retired the trade in birds dropped to a tenth of what it had been two years before. Since then the zoo's administration has been restructured and the zoo has regained public credibility and scientific status. The modern zoo has moved away from the traditional housing of species separately in pairs. Now species are grouped together as they would be in the wild, in exhibits that are carefully planned according to region. Enclosures have been designed with the needs of the animals in mind, providing a more natural habitat, which also serves an educational purpose for visitors. Although some of the zoo's heritage listed enclosures such as the Elephant House have been retained, they are no longer used to house animals; (the Elephant House now has educational signs). The last elephant housed at the Adelaide Zoo, Samorn, was moved to Monarto in 1991, where she died three years later.Adelaide, remember when Samorn the elephant and George the orangutan lived at the zoo? Adelaide, remember when Samorn the elephant and George the orangutan lived at the zoo? The Advertiser, 6 February 2014. Retrieved 23 September 2016. The flamingo exhibit was opened in 1885, and is one of the few to have remained in the same position to date. Originally it was stocked with 10 flamingos, however most died during a drought in 1915. In 2014, one of two surviving flamingos in the exhibit, thought to be the oldest in the world at 83 years of age, died. The remaining Chilean flamingo at Adelaide zoo, the last flamingo in Australia, was euthanized on 6 April 2018.Australia's only flamingo euthanased at Adelaide Zoo for health reasons ABC News, 7 April 2018.

The botanic similarities between the regions are featured in the zoo's main exhibits, which include a South East Asian Rainforest, and Australian Rainforest Wetlands walk-through aviary. The South East Asian exhibit combines Sumatran orangutan and siamang together. It also combines Malayan tapir and dusky leaf monkey together. In the past, in fact almost to the present day, Adelaide Zoo was famous for having the best bird collection and display of all the Australian zoos. The zoo also has a focus on educational programs. There is a selection of \\"get to know the zoo\\" type of tours, a large \\"children's zoo\\" area, and from April 2009, an educational area for secondary school students and their teachers. Schools can hire the facility and groups can sleep there, with a member from the zoo supervising. Also, a new educational area called the Envirodome opened in April 2009. Night walks, tours and animal research can be done. More information on the educational programs can be found on the zoo's web site. ==Exhibits== ;Asian Region :The South East Asia Exhibit called Immersion was built in two parts. The first part was finished in 1995 which gave exhibits to animals such as siamangs and sun bears. In late 2006 most of part two was finished which gave exhibits to Sumatran orangutans, siamangs and Sumatran tigers. There is also a large walk-through aviary which takes visitors past the two gibbon islands to the sun bear enclosure. ;Australian Region ;Jewels of Asia Aviary ;Children's Zoo ;African Region ;South American Region ;Tamarin House ;Australian Habitat Aviaries ;Australian Bush Aviaries ;Envirodome :The Envirodome is an interactive visitor experience housed in the old Ape Block along with the Education Centre. The non-animal exhibits are hands-on and are aimed at the conservation of our environment, hoping to educate the public on simple changes they can make to help the environment. The building itself has been largely recycled and has a green roof, rain-water fed toilets, hay-bale walls and solar panels. ==Incidents== In September 1909, the Strand Magazine reported that a snake had swallowed a rug weighing almost 12 pounds, and which survived undamaged in the snake's stomach until disgorged almost a month later. The short article featured a photograph of the disgorged rug which was 5 feet 3 inches long. A bear also killed a man, a few years earlier. In 1985, two men broke in and killed 64 animals. In 2005, a boy was impaled when he tried to jump the spiked fence with his friends at night. He did not survive. On 30 October 2008, a 78-year-old blind greater flamingo named \\"Greater\\" was beaten, allegedly by a group of teenagers. Four teenagers were charged after visitors reported an incident to zoo staff.

Brown won the British Under-21 championship in 1980 and the national senior singles championship three years later in 1983. After playing on the ATP tour in the early 1980s, but tiring of his financial situation, he left the tour in 1984 to devote his time to coaching in Belgium and France and then young British players at David Lloyd's club in London, including Tim Henman. Five years later, Brown came out of retirement to play in the Davis Cup. Brown caused a sensation at Wimbledon in 1991 when he was granted a wild card. Ranked No. 591 in the world at the time, he faced the 10th seed and previous year's semi-finalist Goran Ivanišević in the second round and beat him in four sets, to the delight of the British crowd. Brown became the first Briton to beat a seeded player at Wimbledon since John Lloyd beat Eliot Teltscher in 1985. Brown was one of only five British players to beat a player inside the top 15 in a slam since 1990 until Daniel Evans at the 2013 US Open. The other four were Jeremy Bates, Tim Henman, Greg Rusedski and Andy Murray. Brown eventually lost in the third round to France's Thierry Champion. Brown's career-high rankings were world No. 145 in singles and No. 42 in doubles. Since permanently retiring from competitive tennis, Brown has served as coach of Britain's Fed Cup team. In 2010, Brown was the Polish Davis Cup and Olympic tennis coach. ==Career finalsSingles (1)=== {| class=\\"sortable wikitable\\" !style=\\"width:40px\\"|Result !style=\\"width:30px\\" class=\\"unsortable\\"|W/L !style=\\"width:65px\\"|Date !style=\\"width:160px\\"|Tournament !style=\\"width:55px\\"|Surface !style=\\"width:160px\\"|Opponent !style=\\"width:120px\\" class=\\"unsortable\\"|Score |- | style=\\"background:#ffa07a;\\"|Loss | 1. | Jun 1989 | Bristol, UK | Grass | Eric Jelen | 4–6, 6–3, 5–7 |} ===Doubles (3)=== {| class=\\"sortable wikitable\\" !style=\\"width:40px\\"|Result !style=\\"width:30px\\" class=\\"unsortable\\"|W/L !style=\\"width:65px\\"|Date !style=\\"width:160px\\"|Tournament !style=\\"width:55px\\"|Surface !style=\\"width:160px\\"|Partner !style=\\"width:160px\\"|Opponents !style=\\"width:120px\\" class=\\"unsortable\\"|Score |- | style=\\"background:#ffa07a;\\"|Loss | 1. | Jun 1990 | Manchester, UK | Grass | Kelly Jones | Mark Kratzmann Jason Stoltenberg |3–6, 6–2, 4–6 |- | style=\\"background:#ffa07a;\\"|Loss | 2. | Feb 1991 | Stuttgart, Germany | Carpet (i) | Jeremy Bates | Sergio Casal Emilio Sánchez | 3–6, 5–7 |- | style=\\"background:#ffa07a;\\"|Loss | 3. | Jun 1991 | Manchester, UK | Grass | Andrew Castle | Omar Camporese Goran Ivanišević | 4–6, 3–6 |- |} ==ReferencesExternal links== * * * Category:English tennis coaches Category:English male tennis players Category:Sportspeople from Warrington Category:Tennis people from Greater London Category:British male tennis players Category:1961 births Category:Living people ","title":"Nick Brown (tennis)"},{"id":"1998311","text":"The Minneapolis Sculpture Garden is an park in Minneapolis, Minnesota, in the United States. It is located near the Walker Art Center, which operates it in coordination with the Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board. It reopened June 10, 2017 after a reconstruction that resulted with the Walker and Sculpture Garden being unified as one 19-acre campus. It is one of the largest urban sculpture gardens in the country, with 40 permanent art installations and several other temporary pieces that are moved in and out periodically. The park is located to the west of Loring Park and the Basilica of Saint Mary. The land was first purchased by the park board around the start of the 20th century, when it was known as \\"The Parade\\" because it had been used for military drills. It became known as the Armory Gardens after park superintendent Theodore Wirth created a formal design that included a U.S. National Guard armory (Kenwood Armory) for Spanish War volunteers. Working as a civic and cultural center, in 1913 a floral convention transformed the land into floral gardens, which it remained for the next 50 years. In 1934, six years after the Walker Art Gallery opened across the street, the Armory was demolished for its instability, and a new Armory built in downtown Minneapolis, turning the Armory Gardens over to the Minneapolis Park Board. Since 1908 the area of today's Sculpture Garden and land to the west had been used for sport recreation via mildly-improved playing fields and the 1950 construction of the original Parade Stadium. In 1988, the Minneapolis Sculpture Garden opened, designed by Edward Larrabee Barnes and landscape architects Quinnel and Rothschild. Parade Stadium was demolished in 1990, two years later the Garden was expanded, adding . Michael Van Valkenburgh and Associates, Inc. designed the northward extension to complement the original space with a more open area that features a walkway and the Alene Grossman Memorial Arbor. The centerpiece of the garden is the Spoonbridge and Cherry (1985–1988) fountain designed by husband and wife Claes Oldenburg and Coosje van Bruggen. A pedestrian bridge, the Irene Hixon Whitney Bridge (1987), designed by Siah Armajani, now crosses Hennepin Avenue, connecting the sculpture garden to Loring Park. ==ReferencesExternal links== *Parade Stadium, Minneapolis in MNopedia, the Minnesota Encyclopedia *Minneapolis Sculpture Garden *Minneapolis Park & Recreation Board: Minneapolis Sculpture Garden *Walker Art Center Category:Sculpture gardens, trails and parks in the United States Category:Art museums in Minnesota Category:Museums in Minneapolis Category:Outdoor sculptures in Minnesota Category:Parks in Minneapolis Category:Art museums established in 1988 Category:1988 establishments in Minnesota Category:Edward Larrabee Barnes buildings ","title":"Minneapolis Sculpture Garden"},{"id":"1998313","text":"Terry Benton Bollinger (born February 6, 1955, Fredericktown, Missouri) is an American computer scientist who works at the MITRE Corporation.

It was funded by a $500,000 donation from art collector Frederick R. Weisman and is permanently located in the Minneapolis Sculpture Garden. The piece was completed and installed in 1988 for the Sculpture Garden's opening and consists of a large cherry resting atop a large spoon partially straddling a small pond. ==History== In the mid-1980s, the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis, Minnesota, commissioned a piece of work from married couple Claes Oldenburg and Coosje van Bruggen, whose first artistic collaboration came in 1976. The work, which had its $500,000 budget donated by art collector Frederick R. Weisman, was to be placed in the new outdoor Minneapolis Sculpture Garden across Vineland Place from the Walker on land owned by the Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board. An early concept for the sculpture was a Viking ship with a dragon figurehead set in a circular reflecting pool; a 1986 article in the Star Tribune describes this vision as having been \\"quickly abandoned\\". The iconography of the spoon had been present in Oldenburg's work for a number of years since he acquired a piece of kitsch depicting a spoon atop a mass of chocolate in 1962. The cherry was contributed by van Bruggen who found inspiration in the formality of the sculpture garden's design, in the Palace of Versailles, and in the dining etiquette of Louis XIV of France's court. Walker curator Siri Engberg said in 2013 that the bowl of the spoon was associated with \\"the prow of a Viking ship, a duck rising out of the water, various flora and fauna, [and] ice skating\\" for Oldenburg and van Bruggen. Martin Friedman, director of the Walker, said of the work that the artists did not intend to craft a \\"sculptural symbol of Minneapolis\\" but that he believed Spoonbridge and Cherry would \\"be a landmark and [would] give a lot of people pleasure\\". The piece was fabricated between 1987 and 1988 at two shipyards, one in Boothbay, Maine, and the other in Bristol, Rhode Island, and finished in New Haven, Connecticut, at sculpture fabricator Lippincott, Inc. It was placed in the northern portion of the Sculpture Garden by two cranes on May 9, 1988. The Sculpture Garden held opening ceremonies September 9–11 of that year, with an official dedication on September 10 featuring a band of spoon players. Spoonbridge and Cherry was entirely repainted in 1995. In 2012, the word \\"Kony\\" was spraypainted onto the sculpture's spoon, possibly as part of Invisible Children's Cover the Night campaign, requiring the sculpture to be scrubbed and repaired which Walker staff were able to complete within 48 hours. ==Design== Spoonbridge and Cherry measures and straddles a small pond built in the shape of a linden tree seed, evoking the lindens in the surrounding park. The pond's shores were lined with irises and reeds. The sculpture is built from stainless steel and aluminum and coated with polyurethane enamel. The cherry portion of the piece weighs while the spoon portion weighs . The sculpture emits filtered water from both the tip and the base of the cherry's stem, the latter intended to keep the cherry gleaming in the light. ==Reception== The editors of Phaidon Press wrote favorably of the sculpture's placement in a park frequented by families, writing that the \\"surprise of finding a oversized fruit spooned up in a park, together with its curved forms and the bright colour, creates a sensuous joy that makes the work immediately accessible to a wide audience, including children.\\" Writing in the Star Tribune a year after the Sculpture Garden's opening, Chris Waddington found the linden seed pond critical to enjoying Spoonbridge, writing that in winter months when the pond was frozen and snowed over, the sculpture \\"can seem like a soulless mock-up, a quirky idea that lost its charm somewhere between the artist's hand and the factory where it was built; but with spring comes the fountain's spray, the pool's play of liquid reflections on steel and an animate charge that recalls the poetry of the artists' original sketches.\\" Within a decade of the Sculpture Garden's opening, the Star Tribune reported that Spoonbridge was \\"something of an icon for the Walker\\". In 2001, Eric Dregni wrote that the sculpture had \\"become the unofficial symbol of Minneapolis\\" and in 2008, City Pages described it as \\"one of the Twin Cities' most iconic images.\\" The Walker reported receiving more requests for images of Spoonbridge and Cherry than any other work in its collections. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Spoonbridge and Cherry at the Walker Art Center Category:1988 establishments in Minnesota Category:1988 sculptures Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1988 Category:Outdoor sculptures in Minnesota Category:Sculptures by Claes Oldenburg Category:Sculptures by Coosje van Bruggen Category:Stainless steel sculptures in the United States Category:Fountains in the United States Category:Steel sculptures in Minnesota Category:Culture of Minneapolis Category:Aluminum sculptures in the United States Category:Public art in Minnesota Category:Vandalized works of art in the United States Category:Spoons Category:Cherries ","title":"Spoonbridge and Cherry"},{"id":"1998332","text":"Hastings Park is located in the northeast sector of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, in a neighbourhood called Hastings-Sunrise. Its name references the Hastings Townsite, part of which was also known as New Brighton, which lay at the end of the Douglas Road from New Westminster, founded as a resort and watering-hole and as a port to connect the other settlements of the inlet—Gastown, Moodyville and Barnet—to the city. The land was originally granted in trust to the City by the Province in 1888 as part of the will of its late owner, with the site to be kept in perpetuity as wilderness park for public use. However, throughout most of the twentieth century, Hastings Park has been home to two institutions: the Pacific National Exhibition (PNE) and the Hastings Racecourse, and the PNE's amusement park, Playland. Over the years, the site lost its park character because of the construction of many buildings and parking lots. These included the long- vanished Exhibition Building, a Mission-style affair with ornate cupolas and decor, torn down by the 1920s due to structural inefficiencies. In its place three large art deco concrete buildings and one smaller one - the Showmart, Food Building and Forum and the Gardens, respectively. Over time PNE facilities grew in the post-war period by the addition of the BC Building, housing the once-famous Challenger Relief Map of British Columbia and the Agrodome, plus the regular expansion of buildings and structures in Playland, most visibly its roller coaster, prominent on the eastern approach into the city via Hastings Street and via Highway 1, but also a vintage games arcade and electric bumper-car \\"rink\\". Next to it, in time for the British Empire Games hosted by Vancouver in 1954, was Empire Stadium, its concrete stands now a community track and sport facility. Added still later was the Pacific Coliseum, the park's largest single structure and for many years the city's largest indoor sports and entertainment venue (with Empire Stadium being the largest outdoor). Operations at the racecourse also expanded over times, with an extensive collection of horse barns and horse-trailer parking lots. A Restoration Plan was prepared with the neighbourhood residents and approved by the City in 1997. == The Sanctuary== The Sanctuary boardwalk The sanctuary at Hastings Park was one of the many developments made between 1997 and 2001 in order to improve the facilities associated with the park.http://vancouver.ca/files/cov/HastingsParkPNE-doco-MasterPlan.pdf Within the sanctuary is a large pond surrounded by native plants and walkways. The sanctuary also supports many species of birds and small animals. Furthermore, the pond is stocked with rainbow trout that can be fished for off of a small dock at the northwest corner of the pond. A recent development to this area is the Creekway Park, which is a daylighting stream that will connect the sanctuary to New Brighton Park. This project, which completed its first stage in September 2013, also includes new pedestrian and bicycle pathways between the two parks as well as providing an ecological corridor to the Burrard Inlet. The sanctuary area of the park continues to be developed.Hastings Park Master Plan ==Venues== *Livestock barns (used in the Japanese Canadian internment in the 1940s) *Pacific Coliseum *Playland (Vancouver) *PNE Agrodome *PNE Garden Auditorium *Rollerland *Vancouver Forum ==Former venues== *BC Pavilion (now the site of the Sanctuary Pond) *Empire Field (demolished after renovations of BC Place) *Empire Stadium *see full list in the entry \\"Lost Buildings of the PNE\\" == References == Category:Parks in Vancouver Category:1888 establishments in British Columbia Category:Fairgrounds in Canada ","title":"Hastings Park"},{"id":"1998335","text":"Marianne Wilkinson () is a Canadian local politician and ex-Councillor for Kanata North (Ward 4) in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. ==Career== Marianne Wilkinson is a graduate in Geography from Trinity College, University of Toronto.

Hiram is presented as the chief architect of King Solomon's Temple, who is murdered in the Temple he designed by three ruffians as they unsuccessfully attempt to force him to divulge the Master Masons' secret passwords. The themes of the allegory are the importance of fidelity, and the certainty of death. == The Masonic legend of Hiram Abiff == St. John's Church, Chester (1900) Bronze statue by Nickolaus-Otto Kruch, Berlin, Germany (2013) The tale of Hiram Abiff as passed down in Masonic Lodges underpins the third degree. It starts with his arrival in Jerusalem, and his appointment by Solomon as chief architect and master of works at the construction of his temple. As the temple is nearing completion, three fellowcraft masons from the workforce ambush him as he leaves the building, demanding the secrets of a master mason. Hiram is challenged by each in turn, and at each refusal to divulge the information his assailant strikes him with a mason's tool (differing between jurisdictions). He is injured by the first two assailants, and struck dead by the last.Pietre Stones Kent Henderson, The Legend of Hiram Abif, retrieved 14 September 2012 His murderers hide his body under a pile of rubble, returning at night to move the body outside the city, where they bury it in a shallow grave marked with a sprig of acacia. As the Master is missed the next day, Solomon sends out a group of fellowcraft masons to search for him. The loose acacia is accidentally discovered, and the body exhumed to be given a decent burial. The hiding place of the \\"three ruffians\\" is also discovered, and they are brought to justice. Solomon informs his workforce that the secret word of a master mason is now lost. He replaces it with a substitute word. This word is considered a secret by Masons, but for hundreds of years various \\"revelations\\" of the word have been made, usually all differing from each other. One such \\"revelation\\" is \\"Mach-benak\\" or \\"decay- apparently\\" based on gestures given and words spoken upon the discovery of Hiram's body.William Morgan, Illustrations of Freemasonry, 1827 Second section of Master Mason lecture, retrieved 14 September 2012 Such is the general legend as related in the Anglo-American jurisdictions. In Continental Freemasonry the tale is slightly different: a large number of master masons (not just Hiram) are working on the Temple, and the three ruffians are seeking the passwords and signs that will give them a higher wage. The result is the same, but this time it is master masons who find the body. The secrets are not lost, but Solomon orders them buried under the Temple, inscribed on Hiram's grave, and the same substitution is made as a mark of respect. The secrets \\"lost\\" in the other tradition are here given to new master masons as part of their ritual. In this version, Hiram is often renamed Adoniram.Rituels French language collection of ritual, 18th-early 19th century, retrieved 14 September 2012 Anderson's revised 1738 Constitutions describe the place of the Deputy Grand Master, to the left of the newly installed Grand Master John Montagu, 2nd Duke of Montagu, as the \\"Chair of Hiram Abiff\\".James Anderson, The New Book of Constitutions, 1738, p.113 in Quatuor Coronatorum Antigrapha, vol VII, 1890 == Hirams in the Bible == In the Hebrew Bible or Old Testament, there are three separate instances of people named Hiram that were involved in the construction of the temple of Solomon: * Hiram, King of the realm of Tyre (today, in the modern nation of Lebanon), is credited in 2 Samuel 5:11 and 1 Kings 5:1-10 for having sent building materials and men for the original construction of the Temple in Jerusalem. In the Masonic drama, \\"Hiram, King of Tyre\\" is clearly distinguished from \\"Hiram Abiff\\". The former is clearly a king and the latter clearly a master craftsman. They can be confused in other contexts.1 Kings 5 & 7:13-46 http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Kings%205,7:13-46&version;=NIV and 2 Chronicles 2:1-14 & 4:11-16 http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Chronicles%202:1-14,4:11-16&version;=NIV *In 1 Kings 7:13–14, Hiram is described as the son of a widow from the tribe of Naphtali who was the son of a Tyrian bronze worker, sent for by Solomon to cast the bronze furnishings and ornate decorations for the new temple. From this reference, Freemasons often refer to Hiram (with the added Abiff) as \\"the widow's son.\\" Hiram cast these bronzes in clay ground in the plain of the Jordan between Succoth and Zarethan/Zeredathah (1 Kings 7:46-47). * 2 Chronicles 2:13-14 relates a formal request from King Solomon of Jerusalem to King Hiram I of Tyre, for workers and for materials to build a new temple. King Hiram (Huram in Chronicles) responds \\"And now I have sent a skillful man, endowed with understanding, Ḥuram 'abi. (the son of a woman of the daughters of Dan, and his father was a man of Tyre), skilled to work in gold and silver, bronze and iron, stone and wood, purple and blue, fine linen and crimson, and to make any engraving and to accomplish any plan which may be given to him, with your skillful men and with the skillful men of my lord David your father.\\"2 Chronicles 2:13-14, New King James Version - From BibleGateway.com The phrase italicised above is translated in the New King James Version as \\"Huram my master craftsman\\". Most translations of this passage take the \\"'ab-\\" in \\"'abi\\" as the construct state of 'abba, here translated as master. Older translations preferred to translate \\"'ab-\\" as father. The common translation of the -i suffix is \\"my\\", giving the problematic reading that Hiram was sending his own father, also called Hiram. This is found in the Vulgate, the Douay–Rheims Bible and in Wycliffe's Bible. The other reading is as the old Hebrew genitive, and some variant of \\"of my father\\" is found in the Septuagint, the Bishop's Bible and the Geneva Bible. In his 1723 \\"Constitutions\\", James Anderson announced that many problems with this text would be solved by reading \\"'abi\\" as the second part of a proper name, which he rendered as \\"Hiram Abif\\",Anderson's 1723 Constitutions, in Franklin's 1734 reprint retrieved 14 September 2012 agreeing with the translations of Martin Luther and Miles Coverdale's reading of 2 Chronicles 4:16.Coverdale Bible 2 Chronicles 4:16, retrieved 20 September 2012 == Other accounts of a biblical Hiram == Flavius Josephus in his Antiquities of the Jews (Chapter 8:76) refers to Hiram as τεχνίτης, artificer, craftsman. \\"Now Solomon sent for an artificer out of Tyre, whose name was Hiram: he was by birth of the tribe of Naphtali, on his mother's side (for she was of that tribe); but his father was Ur, of the stock of the Israelites.\\"Sacred Texts Flavius Josephus, Antiquities of the Jews, Book VIII (in this version chapter 3 para 4 contains v76) retrieved 20 September 2012 The Targum Sheni, an Aramaic commentary on the Book of Esther written sometime between the fall of Rome and the Crusades, credits Hiram with the construction of a miraculous throne for Solomon, which in Esther's time is being used by the descendants of Cyrus the Great.Paulus Cassel (tr. A. Bernstein), An Explanatory Commentary on Esther, Edinburgh, 1888, pp267-275 The most elaborate version of the legend occurs in Gérard de Nerval's 1851 account, Voyage en Orient, where he relates the tale, inserting all the masonic passwords, as part of the story of Balkis, the \\"Queen of the Morning\\" and \\"Soliman\\", Prince of the Genii. This is an elaboration of the second version above, where the Master Craftsman is named Adoniram. Before his death, he undergoes mystical adventures as his tale is interwoven with that of Solomon and Balkis, the Queen of Sheba. The ruffians who kill him are under the instruction of Solomon himself. De Nerval relates the story as having been told in an Eastern coffee house over a two-week period.The Women Of Cairo, Scenes Of Life In The Orient, Volume Two English translation of Gerard de Nerval, Voyage en Orient (1851), Harcourt, Brace & Co, New York, 1930, pp244-380 A similar account is given in Charles William Heckethorn's The Secret Societies of all Ages and Countries, where Solomon plots to destroy Hiram because of the mutual love between Hiram and the Queen of Sheba.Charles William Heckethorn, The Secret Societies of all Ages and Countries, London, 1897, Vol ii, pp3-7 Meanwhile, in 1862, the whole adventure of Adoniram's love for Balkis and his murder by three workmen in the pay of Solomon had been set to music in Charles Gounod's opera, La reine de Saba.Charles Gounod.com La Reine de Saba, accessed 26 July 2014 == Other theories == There have been many proposals for the origin of the masonic Hiram Abiff story, which are dismissed by most Masonic scholars. Veneration of the Sun According to AllFreemasonry.com, the legend of Hiram Abiff has roots in ancient veneration of the sun. ===Seqenenre Tao II=== Lomas and Knight claim the wounds of Sequenre Tao II make him a match for Hiram Abiff According to authors Robert Lomas and Christopher Knight, the prototype for Hiram Abiff was the Egyptian king Seqenenre Tao II, who (they claim) died in an almost identical manner. This idea is dismissed by most Masonic scholars. ===Dhul-Nun al-Misri=== In his book The Sufis, the Afghan scholar Idries Shah suggested that Dhul-Nun al- Misri might have been the origin of the character Hiram Abiff in the masonic Master Mason ritual. The link, he believes, was through the Sufi sect Al-Banna (\\"The Builders\\") who built the Al-Aqsa Mosque and the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem. This fraternity could have influenced some early masonic guilds which borrowed heavily from the Oriental architecture in the creation of the Gothic style. ===Renaud de Montauban=== The French masonic historian Paul Naudon has highlighted the similarity between the death of Hiram and the murder of Renaud de Montauban in the late 12th Century chanson de geste, The Four Sons of Aymon. Renaud, like his prototype Saint Reinold, was killed by a hammer-blow to the head while working as a mason at Cologne Cathedral, and his body hidden by his murderers before being miraculously re-discovered. == Notes  References == * * * Domenico V.

He was in the Powergen Cup winning side of 2003 and the Gloucester Rugby side that finished top of the 2003 Zurich Premiership. He was a try scorer in the 2006 European Challenge Cup Final Victory over London Irish at The Stoop. On 2 April 2013, it was announced that he had signed a one-year contract extension to keep him at Gloucester until the end of the 2013-2014 season. On 4 February 2014, Andy Hazell officially announces retirement from all forms of rugby due to persistent concussion injuries. Hazell was the longest-serving player to any professional rugby union club since the professional era began in 1995, spending 17 years with Gloucester Rugby and making a total of 266 appearances for the Cherry and Whites. ==International career== He pulled on an England shirt for the first time playing for England U21s and was a member of the SANZAR squad that played in the Argentina competition back in 1999. In 2001 he played for the England XV that took on the Barbarians and also went on the England tour to North America, playing in both midweek games and scoring a try against British Columbia. His England A debut came in 2002 when he played Scotland A at Headingley and impressed throughout the 2003 England A Six Nations tournament. Hazell was chosen for England's highly successful senior tour of New Zealand and Australia in June 2003 and played in the 23–9 victory over New Zealand Māori in New Plymouth, before flying to Vancouver to become a member of England’s Churchill Cup winning side in 2003 and returned again the following year. He was part of the wider 43 man England squad for the 2003 World Cup. Hazell won his first cap starting as openside flanker in England’s victory over Canada at Twickenham in November 2004 and another as a replacement in the match against South Africa a week later. The Investec series represented his first serious breakthrough into the senior England team. Hazell played in four games of the 2005 Six Nations, scoring a try against Italy. ==References External links == * England profile * Gloucester Rugby Profile *Smart Home Sounds Category:1978 births Category:Living people Category:English rugby union players Category:Gloucester Rugby players Category:Rugby union players from Gloucester Category:Rugby union flankers Category:England international rugby union players ","title":"Andy Hazell"},{"id":"1998361","text":"Paul Greengrass (born 13 August 1955) is an English film director, film producer, screenwriter, and former journalist. He specialises in dramatisations of historic events and is known for his signature use of hand- held cameras. His early film Bloody Sunday (2002), about the 1972 shootings in Derry, Northern Ireland, won the Golden Bear at 52nd Berlin International Film Festival. Other films he has directed include three in the Bourne action/thriller series: The Bourne Supremacy (2004), The Bourne Ultimatum (2007), and Jason Bourne (2016); United 93 (2006), for which he won the BAFTA Award for Best Director and received an Academy Award for Best Director nomination; Green Zone (2010); and Captain Phillips (2013). In 2004, he co- wrote and produced the film Omagh, which won British Academy Television Award. In 2007, Greengrass co-founded Directors UK, a professional organization of British filmmakers, and was its first president until 2014. In 2008, The Telegraph named him among the most influential people in British culture. In 2017, Greengrass was honoured with a British Film Institute Fellowship. ==Early life== Greengrass was born 13 August 1955 in Cheam, Surrey, England. His mother was a teacher and his father a river pilot and merchant seaman. His brother, Mark Greengrass, has become a noted English historian. Greengrass was educated at Westcourt Primary School, Gravesend Grammar School and Sevenoaks School, and attended Queens' College, Cambridge. He studied English literature at the same time as Roger Michell. ==CareerJournalism=== Greengrass first worked as a director in the 1980s, for the ITV current affairs programme World in Action; his investigation of timber-framed house construction has been cited as preventing its widespread adoption in Britain. At the same time he co-authored the book Spycatcher (1987) with Peter Wright, former assistant director of MI5. It contained enough sensitive information that the British Government made an unsuccessful attempt to ban it. ===Film=== Greengrass (left) with Tom Hanks, and Japanense Prime Minister Shinzō Abe at the Tokyo International Film Festival Greengrass moved into drama, directing non- fiction, made-for-television films such as The One That Got Away, based on Chris Ryan's book about SAS actions in the Gulf War and The Fix, based on the 1964 betting scandal that shook British football. His 1998 film The Theory of Flight starred Kenneth Branagh and Helena Bonham Carter, who played a woman with motor neurone disease. The film dealt with the difficult issue of the sexuality of people with disabilities. Greengrass directed The Murder of Stephen Lawrence (1999), an account of Stephen Lawrence, a black youth whose murder was not properly investigated by the Metropolitan Police. His mother's investigations resulted in accusations about institutional racism in the police. Bloody Sunday (2002), depicted the 1972 Bloody Sunday shootings of Irish anti-internment activists by British soldiers in an almost documentary style; it shared First Prize at the 2002 Berlin Film Festival with Hayao Miyazaki's Spirited Away. Bloody Sunday was inspired by Don Mullan's politically influential book Eyewitness Bloody Sunday (Wolfhound Press, 1997). A schoolboy witness of the events of Bloody Sunday, Mullan was co-producer and appeared as a figure in Bloody Sunday.. In 2004, Greengrass co-wrote the television film Omagh with Guy Hibbert. Based on the bombing of 1998, the film was a critical success, winning British Academy Television Award for Best Single Drama. This was the first professional film that Greengrass had not directed; he was credited as a writer and producer. He had been working on The Bourne Supremacy. The film was directed by Pete Travis. It was the second film Greengrass had written about terrorism and mass killing in Ireland after Bloody Sunday. Based on that film, Greengrass was hired to direct 2004's The Bourne Supremacy, a sequel to the 2002 film The Bourne Identity. The first film's director, Doug Liman, had left the project. The film starred Matt Damon as Jason Bourne, an amnesiac who realises he was once a top CIA assassin and is being pursued by his former employers. An unexpectedly major financial and critical success, it secured Greengrass's reputation and ability to get his smaller, more personal films made. In 2006, Greengrass directed United 93, a film based on the 11 September 2001 hijacking of United Airlines Flight 93. The film received critical acclaim, particularly for Greengrass' quasi- documentary-style. After receiving many Best Director awards and nominations from critics' circles (including the Broadcast Film Critics Association), Greengrass won the BAFTA award for Best Director at the 60th British Academy Film Awards and received an Oscar nomination for Achievement in Directing at the 79th Academy Awards. For his role in writing the film, he earned the Writers Guild of America Award and BAFTA nominations for Best Original Screenplay. He returned to the money-making Bourne franchise. The Bourne Ultimatum, released in 2007, was an even bigger success than the previous two films. He was nominated for BAFTA Best Director at the 61st British Academy Film Awards. In 2007, he co-founded Directors UK, a professional association for British directors. He served as founding president until July 2014. Greengrass's Green Zone stars Matt Damon as the head of a U.S. military team on an unsuccessful hunt for weapons of mass destruction in post-war Iraq. It was filmed in Spain and Morocco and released in 2010. The film was first announced as based on the bestselling, award-winning non-fiction book Imperial Life in the Emerald City, by Rajiv Chandrasekaran, the Washington Posts Baghdad bureau chief. But the final film is a largely fictionalised action thriller only loosely inspired by events in the book. Captain Phillips, Greengrass's film about the Maersk Alabama hijacking in 2009, was based on the book A Captain's Duty. It starred Tom Hanks, Barkhad Abdi, and Faysal Ahmed. It was shot in 2012 in Massachusetts and Virginia in the United States, and Malta. It was released in 2013. Greengrass returned to direct the fifth Jason Bourne film, Jason Bourne, with Damon starring again. The film was released on 29 July 2016. In 2017, Greengrass began filming 22 July, a docudrama film following the 2011 Norway attacks perpetrated by Anders Behring Breivik and their aftermath, on location in Norway. The film was released on Netflix and in select theaters on October 10, 2018. ==Personal life== Greengrass has said that he professes irreligion but has \\"great respect for the spiritual way\\". He is a supporter of Crystal Palace FC. He has had many banter-filled football chats on the Mayo & Kermode Film Programme when publicising his films. ==Filmography Films === {| class=\\"wikitable\\" |- ! rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:33px;\\" |Year ! rowspan=\\"2\\" |Film ! colspan=\\"3\\" |Credited as ! rowspan=\\"2\\" |Notes |- ! width=\\"65\\" |Director ! width=\\"65\\" |Writer ! width=\\"65\\" |Producer |- style=\\"text-align:center;\\" || 1989 | style=\\"text-align:left;\\" |Resurrected | | | | |- style=\\"text-align:center;\\" || 1998 | style=\\"text- align:left;\\" |The Theory of Flight | | | | |- style=\\"text-align:center;\\" || 2002 | style=\\"text-align:left;\\" |Bloody Sunday | | | | |- style=\\"text- align:center;\\" |2004 | style=\\"text-align:left;\\" |The Bourne Supremacy | | | | |- style=\\"text-align:center;\\" || 2006 | style=\\"text-align:left;\\" |United 93 | | | | style=\\"text-align:left;\\" |BAFTA Award for Best Direction Nominated — Academy Award for Best Director Nominated — BAFTA Award for Outstanding British Film Nominated — Broadcast Film Critics Association Award for Best Director |- style=\\"text-align:center;\\" || 2007 | style=\\"text-align:left;\\" |The Bourne Ultimatum | | | | style=\\"text-align:left;\\" | Nominated — BAFTA Award for Best Direction Nominated — BAFTA Award for Outstanding British Film |- style=\\"text- align:center;\\" || 2010 | style=\\"text-align:left;\\" |Green Zone | | | | |- style=\\"text-align:center;\\" || 2013 | style=\\"text-align:left;\\" |Captain Phillips | | | | style=\\"text-align:left;\\" |Empire Inspiration Award Nominated — BAFTA Award for Best Direction Nominated — Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directing – Feature Film Nominated — AACTA International Award for Best Direction Nominated — Broadcast Film Critics Association Award for Best Director Nominated — Golden Globe Award for Best Director |- style=\\"text-align:center;\\" || 2016 | style=\\"text-align:left;\\" |Jason Bourne | | | | |- style=\\"text- align:center;\\" || 2018 | style=\\"text-align:left;\\" |22 July | | | | |- style=\\"text-align:center;\\" || 2020 | style=\\"text-align:left;\\" |News of the World | | | || |- style=\\"text-align:center;\\" || 2022 | style=\\"text- align:left;\\" |1984 | | | | |} === Television === {| class=\\"wikitable\\" |- ! rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:33px;\\" |Year ! rowspan=\\"2\\" |Film ! colspan=\\"3\\" |Credited as ! rowspan=\\"2\\" |Notes |- ! width=\\"65\\" |Director ! width=\\"65\\" |Writer ! width=\\"65\\" |Producer |- |1984-1987 |World in Action | | | |Documentary television series (Director in 2 episodes / Producer in 10 episodes) |- |1992 |Cutting Edge | | | |Documentary television series (Episode: \\"Coppers\\") |- |1993 |Crime Story | | | |Television series (Episode: \\"When the Lies Run Out: The Ian Spiro Story\\") |- |1994 |Open Fire | | | |Television film |- | rowspan=\\"2\\" |1995 |Kavanagh QC | | | |Television series (Episode: \\"The Sweetest Thing\\") |- |The Late Show | | | |Documentary television series (Episode: \\"Sophie's World\\") |- |1996 |The One That Got Away | | | |Television film |- |1997 |The Fix | | | |Television film |- |1999 |The Murder of Stephen Lawrence | | | |Television film |- |2004 |Omagh | | | |Television film; British Academy Television Award Best Single Drama |- |2017 |Five Came Back | | | |Documentary series; Starring role as himself |} == References External links== * *BAFTA Interview with Paul Greengras, Latitude Festival, 2010 Category:1955 births Category:Alumni of Queens' College, Cambridge Category:Best Director BAFTA Award winners Category:Directors of Golden Bear winners Category:British film directors Category:British republicans Category:British male screenwriters Category:English film directors Category:English non-fiction writers Category:English screenwriters Category:English male screenwriters Category:Living people Category:People educated at Sevenoaks School Category:People from Cheam Category:People educated at Gravesend Grammar School Category:English-language film directors Category:English male non- fiction writers Category:Action film directors ","title":"Paul Greengrass"},{"id":"1998366","text":"{| |} The first USS Saginaw was a sidewheel sloop-of-war in the United States Navy during the American Civil War. ==History== The first vessel built by the Mare Island Navy Yard, Saginaw was laid down on 16 September 1858; launched as Toucey on 3 March 1859; sponsored by Miss Cunningham, daughter of the commandant of the Navy Yard; renamed Saginaw; and commissioned on 5 January 1860, Commander James F. Schenck in command. The new side-wheel ship sailed from San Francisco Bay on 8 March 1860, headed for the western Pacific, and reached Shanghai, China on 12 May. She then served in the East India Squadron, for the most part cruising along the Chinese coast to protect American citizens and to suppress pirates. She visited Japan in November but soon returned to Chinese waters. On 30 June 1861, she silenced a battery at the entrance to Qui Nhon Bay, Cochin China, which had fired upon her while she was searching for the missing boat and crew of American bark Myrtle. On 3 January 1862, Saginaw was decommissioned at Hong Kong and returned to Mare Island on 3 July for repairs. Relaunched on 3 December 1862 and recommissioned on 23 March 1863, Saginaw was attached to the Pacific Squadron and operated along the United States West Coast to prevent Confederate activity. She visited Puget Sound in the spring of 1863 to investigate reports that Confederate privateers were being outfitted in British Columbia, but returned after learning that the scheme had no chance of success. Her cruises in 1864 took Saginaw to ports in Mexico and Central America to protect the interests of the United States endangered by Confederate activity and by European interference in Mexico. During the closing months of the year, she escorted steamers of the Pacific Mail Steamship Company carrying rich cargoes of bullion from the California gold fields. In the spring of 1865, the ship was assigned to the United States Revenue Cutter Service but was returned to the Navy on 2 June 1865. She spent the remainder of 1865 protecting American citizens at Guaymas and other Mexican ports during the unrest and disorder which beset Mexico during the struggle between Emperor Maximilian I and Benito Juárez. In March 1866, Saginaw returned to Mare Island. She sailed in August 1866 for Puget Sound to support settlers in the Pacific Northwest. While there, she aided the Western Union Company in laying a cable which brought the first telegraphic service to the region. After returning to Mare Island in December 1866, the ship remained at the navy yard through 1867. In April 1868, a year after the United States purchased Alaska from Russia, Saginaw got underway for the Alaska Territory and, with the exception of a run home late in the year for replenishment, spent the next year exploring and charting the Alaskan coast. In the February 1869 Kake War the USS Saginaw destroyed three deserted villages and two forts near present-day Kake, Alaska. Prior to the conflict, two white trappers were killed by the Kake in retribution for the death of two Kake departing Sitka village in canoe. Sitka was the site of a standoff between the Army and Tlingit due to the army demanding the surrender of chief Colchika who was involved in an altercation in Fort Sitka. While no Kake, or possibly a single old woman, died in the destruction of the villages, the loss of winter stores, canoes, and shelter led to the death during the winter of some of the Kake.Harring, Sidney L. \\"The Incorporation of Alaskan Natives Under American Law: United States and Tlingit Sovereignty, 1867-1900.\\" Ariz. L. Rev. 31 (1989): 279.“Search for and destroy”: US Army Relations with Alaska’s Tlingit Indians and the Kake War of 1869,” Jones, Zachary R. After steaming back to San Francisco Bay in April 1869, Saginaw departed her home port on 28 July 1869 and operated along the coast of Mexico until arriving back at Mare Island on 11 November 1869. ==Fate== thumb Saginaws next assignment took her to Midway Atoll to support dredging operations to deepen the entrance to the harbor. She reached Midway on 24 March 1870 and completed her task on 21 October 1870. A week later, she sailed for San Francisco, intending to touch at Kure Atoll (at that time known as Ocean Island) en route home to rescue any shipwrecked sailors who might be stranded there. The next day, 29 October 1870, as she neared this rarely visited atoll, Saginaw struck an outlying reef and grounded. Before the surf battered the ship to pieces, her 93 crew managed to transfer much of her gear and provisions to the atoll. On 18 November, a party of five men, headed by Lieutenant John G. Talbot, the executive officer, set out for Honolulu in a small boat to get relief for their stranded shipmates. As they neared Kauai, 31 days and some later, their boat was upset by breakers. Only Coxswain William Halford survived to obtain help. He landed on Kauai, where Captain Dudoit of the schooner Wainona offered to take him straight to Honolulu leaving his return freight for a later trip. They sailed on Tuesday Dec 20th and arrived at Honolulu on Saturday 24 December and was taken to the United States Consulate there. The US Consul authorised the despatch of a fast sailing coaster, the Kona Packet, which departed on Sunday 25 December, and the King of Hawaii, Kamehameha V, sent the inter-island steamer, Kilauea under Captain Thomas Long, to rescue the shipwrecked sailors. After loading with coal for 2 days and food and copious fresh water they departed on Monday 26 December.Loss of the USS Saginaw, The Pacific Commercial Advertiser, 28 Dec 1871 The Kilauea arrived at Kure on 4 January 1871, and the Kona Packet a day later. Due to uncertainty over the coal required for the return journey they steamed to Midway Island loading 40 tons of coal and left on 7 January, arriving back in Honolulu on 14 January, a round trip of 2350 miles. Captain Long was presented with a heavy gold-cased chronometer watch by the U.S. Government as thanks for successfully undertaking the rescue mission. The Saginaw's gig survived being capsized in the breakers, and was sold at auction in January 1871. The purchaser presented it to the rescued crew of the Saginaw, whereupon it was transported back to San Francisco on the A.P. Jordan.The Pacific Commercial Advertiser, 28 Jan 1871 It survives as part of the Curator Collection at the Castle Museum of Saginaw County History in Saginaw, Michigan. The crew of the Saginaw may have been aware of the loss of the whaler Gledstanes on the same reef on 9 July 1837, as they faced the same predicament and constructed a schooner Deliverance from the wreckage over many months. Captain Brown with 8 men sailed for Hawaii on 15th Dec to secure a rescue ship which took the remaining men off the atoll in February.The Midway Island Speculation and what came of it (referencing The Hawaian Spectator, July 1838), The Pacific Commercial Advertiser, 28 Jan 1871 The wreck of Saginaw was discovered in 2003 and remains under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Naval History and Heritage Command. The book A Civil War Gunboat in Pacific Waters: Life on Board USS Saginaw (by Hans Van Tilburg, University Press of Florida, 2010) covers the ship's construction, her ten years of service in the Pacific, and her loss at Kure Atoll. Van Tilburg led the team which discovered the wreck site in 2003. The young readers’ book The Wreck of the Saginaw (by Keith Robertson, The Viking Press, 1954, 144 pp) tells the story of the voyage of the five sailors who sailed a small boat to Hawaii seeking rescue for the survivors remaining on Kure Atoll. It includes charming illustrations and a map (by Jack Weaver). ==See also== *List of sloops of war of the United States Navy *Confederate States Navy *Union Navy *List of United States Navy ships ==ReferencesExternal links== * * *Letterbook of the U.S.S.

He was one of the discoverers of the Yukon River.\\"Dear Sir / I have great pleasure in informing you that I have at length after much trouble and difficulties, succeed[ed] in reaching the ‘Youcon’, or white water River, so named by the natives from the pale colour of its water. … /// I have the honour to Remain Your obᵗ Servᵗ / John Bell\\" Hudson’s Bay Company candence to George Simpson from John Bell (August 1, 1845), HBC Archives, D.5/14, fos. 212-215d, also quoted in, , at page 21. Bell was appreciated by the company for his \\"professionalism, flexibility and dedication to the interests of the fur trade\\" as well as his abilities as a \\"manager of men\\". In 1839, he was sent to explore the land west of the Mackenzie River. With the assistance of Alexander Kennedy Isbister, he established Fort McPherson, Northwest Territories on the Peel River not far from the Mackenzie, and explored the Peel into what is now the Yukon Territory. In 1845, Bell crossed the mountains into the Yukon River watershed, and went down the Rat River to its confluence with the Porcupine River. The Rat River has been renamed the Bell River in his honour. After managing the fur trade at Fort McPherson until 1845, he returned to the Bell River, and Followed the Porcupine to its juncture with the Yukon River, the eventual site of Fort Yukon. He set the stage for the Yukon trade which proved extremely lucrative for the Hudson's Bay Company and for Canada's claim over what is now the Yukon Territory. He had some involvement in organizing John Rae's 1848-1849 expedition to search for Sir John Franklin, and continued working in the Mackenzie District for the Hudson's Bay Company until 1860. Although his exploits as an explorer are most often publicized, Bell preferred to work as a manager and organizer. He accepted the exploring jobs as required but did so \\"without the enthusiasm and sense of destiny that inspired other HBC explorers. He was, in fact, a fur trader rather than an explorer, both in talent and temperament.\\" Bell completed his career in Quebec, retiring from the company in 1860. He then moved to Saugeen, Ontario and farmed in the area until his death. ==References External links == *Biography at the Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online Category:History of Yukon Category:Scottish explorers of North America Category:Explorers of Canada Category:Canadian fur traders Category:1790s births Category:1868 deaths Category:Year of birth uncertain ","title":"John Bell (explorer)"},{"id":"1998370","text":"CNBC Arabiya (Arabic: CNBC عربية) is an Arab free-to-air television channel.

Fabri-Kal specializes in materials including PP, PET, PCR-PET, HDPE, PLA, renewable agricultural pulp and HIPS. Fabri-Kal employs more than 900 people in five manufacturing, printing and warehousing facilities throughout the United States. ==Company history== Fabri-Kal Corporation was founded in Kalamazoo, Michigan in 1950 when seven investors purchased the plastic segment of the Kalamazoo Paper Box Company. The owners decided to call the new business Fabri-Kal, a portmanteau of \\"fabricated in Kalamazoo\\". Located in downtown Kalamazoo, their initial 5,000 square foot operation began in a former A&P; grocery store. The company built a 25,000 square foot manufacturing facility on East Cork Street in Kalamazoo, which was followed in 1961 by a second manufacturing facility in Hazleton, Pennsylvania. As the company continued to grow, the Fabri-Kal Foundation was established in 1969 to provide higher-education tuition assistance to young-adult children of all employees. In 1981 a new headquarters building was constructed in Kalamazoo and a third manufacturing facility opened in Piedmont, South Carolina. In 1991 the Kalamazoo manufacturing facility closed its doors, leaving all manufacturing capacity outside of Michigan. The company was able to overcome its hardships and purchased a 400,000 square foot building in 2008 and after a two year renovation once again opened their doors. In 2010 the Kalamazoo manufacturing facility was awarded the LEED® Silver certification. On October 15, 2015, Fabri-Kal held the grand opening for their new 100,000 square foot manufacturing facility in Burley, Idaho employing approximately 50 people with an additional 100 people planned in the next five years. ==Product lines== * Greenware cold drink cups and portion cups * Kal-Clear PET drink cups * Nexclear polypropylene drink cups * RK translucent drink cups * Kids cups * Juice cups * Portion cups * Alur round containers * Indulge dessert containers * Pro-Kal deli containers * Microwavable bowls * Mushroom tills * Produce clamshells * Lids ==Greenware== Fabri-Kal produces sustainable Greenware cold drink cups, lids and portion cups made entirely from plants, not petroleum.

There is also a new (opened in 2014) third campus, it is where VCC's Heavy Mechanical Trades are located. It is shared with VCC/BCIT campus. VCC also has nearly three dozen community outreach and learning centres. January 2009 marked the opening of VCC's $55 million Broadway campus expansion project. $44 million was funded by the Government of British Columbia and the balance by VCC and community donors. The new building is and seven storeys tall, home to VCC's health sciences training programs. ==Governance== Vancouver Community College is a public institution of post- secondary education administered by a Board of Governors, on behalf of the Government of British Columbia and the Ministry of Advanced Education and Labour Market Development. The board determines policy and reviews the college's performance as detailed in the College and Institutes Act. It also has primary responsibility for fostering the college's short- and long-term success. The VCC Board of Directors consists of eight members appointed by government along with the VCC president, the Chair of Education Council and four elected Board members, including one faculty representative, one support staff representative, and two student representatives. VCC was the only institution to hold the distinction of having the support staff representative act as board chair. ==Staff and faculty== CUPE Local 4627 Vancouver Community College Employees' Union (VCCEU), a trade union, not an association, represents approximately 600 support staff at Vancouver Community College and is covered by the CUPE Support Staff Collective Agreement (CUPE Local 4627). CUPE local 4627 workers provide services in: instruction, program assistance, finance, Aboriginal, administrative, bookstore, library, communication, food services, laboratory demonstration, research, IT, print, and media technology. VCCEU was formed in 2003 and represents the technical employees, warehousemen, program assistants and cafeteria workers in the Food Trades division of the VCC. CUPE 4627 held their first strike in November 2012 with 96% support for a strike and successfully ratified a new agreement in March 2013 with no concessions and did not agree to the formulary. On February 27, 1951, the Labour Board certified a bargaining unit of instructors, counselors, and librarians in programs conducted by and at Vancouver Vocational Institute. That bargaining unit was called the Vocational Instructors' Association. This unit continues at VCC. The Vancouver Community College Faculty Association (VCCFA) represents approximately 750 instructors, counselors, librarians, and health nurses working in Metro Vancouver. VCCFA is a member of the Federation of Post Secondary Educators of B.C. (FPSE Local 15). Employment for instructors, librarians, counselors, and department heads is covered by the Faculty Association Collective Agreement. ==Academics== VCC offers career programs leading to one-year certificates, two-year diplomas, and four-year bachelor's degrees in fields such as the arts, business,trades, and health sciences. The college offers both full-time and part-time programs in spring, summer, and fall terms. Individual courses are also available to supplement high school education or offer continuing education. ==Student life== Many of Vancouver Community College's programs require students to train in local businesses and facilities to gain practical skills. A number of these are located on campus, open to students and the general public. JJ's Dining Room at the downtown campus, is run by culinary arts students. The Four Corners restaurant and the Seiffert Market are run by VCC hospitality management students. The Broadway and Downtown campuses have several coffee and snack kiosks as well as full-service cafeterias. The VCC salon at the Downtown campus offers hairstyling and esthetics services from students learning in the Hair Design and esthetics programs. ===Student government=== The Students' Union of Vancouver Community College (SUVCC) was formed in 1974. Based at the Downtown campus, its goal is to provide and encourage access to recreation, events, and opportunities for VCC students. SUVCC also offers students a health and dental plan and low cost access to student services. It is a member of the Canadian Federation of Students and participates in the British Columbia U-Pass programme. ===Student services=== VCC is accessible to students with disabilities who study in either specialized programs or in mainstream programs. Access to equipment and braille or taped class material is available. VCC also provides sign language interpreting or TypeWell services for Deaf, hard-of-hearing and DeafBlind students for all educational needs.

The song began a string of pop hits and large-scale mainstream success for the band that would continue for the remainder of the 1970s. The song was written by lead singer Steven Tyler and bassist Tom Hamilton, produced by Jack Douglas and recorded at the Record Plant. ==Success== \\"Sweet Emotion\\" was released as a single on May 19, 1975, and peaked at No. 36 on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming the band's breakthrough single and their first Top 40 hit. The day it hit No. 36 on the U.S. chart, July 19, 1975, Aerosmith was booked at a gig in New York City's Central Park, called the Schaefer Music Festival. The song and consequently the album that went into the Top 10 were so successful that the band decided to ride the heels of success and re-release one of their first singles, the power ballad \\"Dream On\\", which had originally charted at No. 59 in 1973. The re-released version went on to hit No. 6, the highest chart performance in the 1970s for the band. \\"Sweet Emotion\\" remains successful in the modern day, having sold over three million digital downloads. ==Lyrical interpretation== Many Aerosmith fans believe that Steven Tyler wrote all of the lyrics to the song about the tension and hatred between the band members and Joe Perry's first wife. Tyler himself has said that only some of the lyrics were inspired by Perry's wife. It was stated in Aerosmith's tell-all autobiography Walk This Way and in an episode of Behind the Music that growing feuds between the band members' wives (including an incident involving \\"spilt milk\\" where Elyssa Perry threw milk over Tom Hamilton's wife, Terry) may have helped lead to the band's original lineup dissolving in the early 1980s.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYLOrT5vRso&index;=6&list;=PLbqqclCB64XFU643uyCjWpBLBT88a8JlG The line \\"Can't catch me / Cause the rabbit done died\\" is a reference to the rabbit test.https://genius.com/1955059 ==Song structure== \\"Tom Hamilton wrote the music for 'Sweet Emotion,'\\" recalled producer Jack Douglas. \\"He had that bassline. And when Joey Kramer came in, he played on the twos and fours instead of the ones and threes, so he was playing on the backside of it. When we heard that, we went, 'Oh, boy! Magic.'\\"https://www.musicradar.com/news/guitars/production-legend-jack- douglas-on-18-career-defining-records-568681 \\"Sweet Emotion\\" is a hard rock song with a repeated electric bass riff tracked alongside the bass marimba, played by Jay Messina in the beginning. Steven Tyler shakes a packet of sugar in place of maracas, as none were available. The introduction builds with the use of a talk box by Joe Perry, which has become one of the most famous uses of the guitar talk box in popular music (Perry's guitar \\"sings\\" the line \\"sweet emotion\\" over Hamilton's bass riff). Eventually Tyler joins in, singing in unison with Perry's talk box. The talk box device used was called The Bag, made by Kustom Electronics. The now discontinued device had been used by guitarists including Jeff Beck and Mike Pinera. The song kicks into a more rocking rhythm with dueling guitars, and rapid-fire angry-sounding lyrics sung by Tyler. The chorus consists of a repeating guitar riff followed by a mirror of the \\"sweet emotion\\" intro. On the 1980 compilation Aerosmith's Greatest Hits, \\"Sweet Emotion\\" appears in edited form. The bass and talk box introduction is removed, and the track begins with the chorus that precedes the first verse. The guitar solo at the end of the song is also removed, and the track concludes with the chorus, which repeats as the song fades. This edit was used for the original single release of the song, which was replaced in subsequent pressings with the album version from Toys in the Attic. ==Personnel== *Steven Tyler – lead vocals, sugar packet, vibraslap *Joe Perry – lead guitar, talk box, backing vocals *Brad Whitford – rhythm guitar *Tom Hamilton – bass *Joey Kramer – drums, percussion *Jay Messina – marimba ==Legacy== The song has been included on almost every Aerosmith compilation and live album, including Aerosmith's Greatest Hits, Pandora's Box, Pandora's Toys, O, Yeah! Ultimate Aerosmith Hits, Devil's Got a New Disguise, Live! Bootleg, Classics Live I, A Little South of Sanity, Greatest Hits 1973–1988 and Rockin' the Joint. The song is frequently cited as Aerosmith's signature song, including in the World Almanac and Book of Facts, and regularly competes with \\"Dream On\\" and \\"Walk This Way\\" for the title of Aerosmith's \\"signature song\\" elsewhere. It is often included on \\"greatest song\\" lists or \\"greatest rock song\\" lists, including a ranking of No. 408 on Rolling Stone magazine's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. Jennifer Aniston's character Rose O'Reilly did a strip tease to the heavily edited version of the song in the 2013 film We're the Millers. The song is featured in the teaser trailer for Disney/Pixar's 2015 film Inside Out and in the 2020 commercial for Dick's Sporting Goods. ==Re-release== The original recording was remixed by David Thoener and released as a single in 1991 in coordination with the release of the band's box set Pandora's Box, although the remixed version was not in the box set. The difference from the original is that the drums are mixed louder with more reverb, the instrumental segue between verses is twice as long and the same as the segue between the 2nd and 4th verses and their subsequent choruses, and a guitar harmony has been added at the fade-out. A new music video was filmed and released in support of the single. The re-released version reached No. 36 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart and No. 74 in the United Kingdom. The remixed version was later issued on the soundtrack to the 1998 film Armageddon. ===Music video=== The video for the re-released version is based on a phone sex conversation. The video, directed by Marty Callner, shows a young man under his covers with a magazine which is advertising a phone sex line. The young man, who says he is a 26-year-old attorney, and the phone sex operator talk about each other for a while, until it goes into a shot of the band performing in a basement (this portion of the video was actually recorded in an old warehouse in the Charlestown Navy Yard, which substituted as the band's old apartment on 1325 Commonwealth Avenue in Boston). It switches back- and-forth between Aerosmith performing \\"Sweet Emotion\\" and the phone conversation. At the very end, both the phone sex operator and the young man are shown to be very different from each other's perceptions; she is an overweight older woman with a baby living in a run down house, and he is a teenage boy. Throughout most of the video, Perry is playing a Gibson Les Paul but plays the solo on a Fender Stratocaster. The video is also a homage to the 1983 film Risky Business, in that the opening scenes of the young man talking to the woman are almost identical to the scenes in the film of Tom Cruise's character talking on the phone to the call girl. == Release history == {| class=\\"wikitable\\" !Region !Date !Format !A-Side/Tracks !Time !B-Side/AA-Side !Time !Label !Catalog # !Barcode !Edition !Series !Notes |- |US |May 1975 |7-inch 45 RPM |Sweet Emotion (Edit/Mono) |3:09 |Sweet Emotion (Edit/Stereo) |3:09 |Columbia/CBS |3-10155 |align=\\"center\\"|— |Demonstration |align=\\"center\\"|— |Co.

The novel includes some characters who cross over from Rice's Lives of the Mayfair Witches trilogy (1990–1994). ==Plot summary== Louis de Pointe du Lac is being haunted by the spirit of Claudia, a child who, like Louis, had been turned into a vampire by Lestat de Lioncourt but was destroyed long ago. With the help of former Talamasca leader-turned-vampire David Talbot, Louis asks the beautiful witch Merrick Mayfair to use her spiritual powers to contact Claudia's ghost. Merrick is also a former agent of the Talamasca, and shared many adventures with David in the past. Flashbacks introduce Merrick's malevolent sister, Honey Isabella or Honey in the Sunshine; Merrick's mother, Cold Sandra; and the Great Nananne, a powerful witch whose very presence is enough to frighten and instill respect in David. Merrick and David recall their journey to a cave in Central America which contained malevolent spirits protecting an ancient jade mask, which allows people to see spirits as if they were corporeal. Merrick retrieves Claudia's diary from the Talamasca vaults, and makes it possible for Louis to speak with Claudia. The spirit's harsh words confirm the negative feelings for Louis that Claudia expressed in her diary, and a despairing Louis attempts suicide by exposing himself to the sun. Made a vampire by Lestat, Louis is too powerful to be destroyed in this manner, and his burned body is restored with vampiric blood bestowed by Lestat, David, and new vampire Merrick. She reveals that from the beginning, she used her magic to lure David and Louis to her in hopes of receiving the Dark Gift of vampirism. The turning of Merrick into a vampire infuriates the Talamasca, but in a letter David advises that they not wage war against the vampires because Lestat is too formidable a foe. ==Crossovers== Some characters from Rice's Lives of the Mayfair Witches trilogy (1990–1994) appear in Merrick, and later Blackwood Farm (2002) and Blood Canticle (2003). ==Audiobooks== In 2000, Penguin Random House Audio released an abridged audiobook adaptation of Merrick, narrated by Derek Jacobi, as well as an unabridged version, narrated by Graeme Malcolm. ==Critical reception== Merrick debuted at No. 2 on The New York Times Best Seller list, and remained in that position for two weeks, spending a total of 10 weeks on the list. Publishers Weekly wrote, \\"This volume merges several long-running plots; the first chapters sag with the weight of their exposition, and the prose seems overheated even for Rice ... Displaying her imaginative talents for atmosphere and suspense, Rice creates a riveting scene that shows Merrick's awesome magic at work.\\" ==References== Category:The Vampire Chronicles novels Category:2000 American novels Category:Alfred A.

Narragansett was built at the Boston Navy Yard, launched on 15 February 1859, and commissioned on 6 November 1859, Commander T. A. Hunt in command. ==Service historyCivil War, 1860–1865=== Narragansett operated along the East Coast into the spring of 1860. On 31 March of that year she departed Norfolk, Virginia, for the Pacific, arriving at Valparaíso, Chile, 4 August. Throughout the Civil War she cruised in the Pacific with the primary mission of protecting American mail steamers from Confederate raiders. On 15 December 1864 she departed the Eastern Pacific for the East Coast, arriving at New York City on 18 March 1865. There she remained in ordinary for several years. ===Gulf of Mexico, 1869=== Back in full service in 1869, she was ordered south, to cruise off the Cuban and Floridian coasts. With the outbreak of yellow fever in the ship in the late spring, Narragansett was ordered to Portsmouth, New Hampshire, where she decommissioned 2 July 1869. ===Pacific, 1871–1875=== Inactive for over two years, she again set sail for the Pacific on 26 March 1871, arriving at San Francisco on 17 September. In December she sailed for the Southwest Pacific and an extended cruise through the Marshalls, Gilberts and Samoan Islands to Australia, arriving at Sydney on 2 April 1873. On her return from this cruise, the sloop was assigned special duty in connection with the survey and examination of the steamer routes along the coasts of California and Mexico. While she was at Mare Island Naval Shipyard, California, in November 1874, Seaman Thomas Lakin jumped overboard and rescued two shipmates from drowning, for which he was later awarded the Medal of Honor. Detached from that duty in 1875, Narragansett entered the Mare Island Naval Shipyard, where she decommissioned and was laid up until 3 November 1883, when she was sold to Win. E.

The University is named after Chief Joe Capilano Sa7plek (Sahp-luk) who was the leader of the Squamish people (Sḵwx̱wú7mesh) from 1895–1910. In 2018, the University marked its 50th anniversary since opening in 1968 with a birthday message from the Prime Minister of Canada who remarked “CapU has empowered thousands of Canadians and people from around the world. Your alumni are artists of all kinds and educators and executives in every field. Above all, they’re leaders.” Capilano University's degree programs are approved by the Government of British Columbia’s Ministry of Advanced Education, Skills and Training. The degree-granting powers of the University are legislated by British Columbia's University Act. In 2012, CapU became Canada's first university to receive accreditation from the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities (or NWCCU) in Washington (state), one of six major regional agencies in the U.S. that are recognized by the United States Department of Education. Capilano University's sports teams, \\"The Blues\\", have won 14 national titles in the Canadian Collegiate Athletic Association, and 59 provincial titles in the Pacific Western Athletic Association. The University was originally founded as Capilano College by school boards and residents of the North Shore (Greater Vancouver) and Howe Sound in 1968 based on the need for a public institution serving the local communities immediately northwest of Vancouver. Initial enrollment was 784 students. In 2008, the province changed Capilano College's designation to a university and, as of 2019, it has grown to enroll approximately 12,700 students per year. Capilano University's academic offerings include nationally and internationally recognized liberal arts, professional, and career programs which lead to degrees, diplomas, and certificates. The University's reputation rests on its smaller class sizes of 25-35 students which provide for more personalized teaching and learning. In 2018, conjointly with BC Stats (the provincial government's leader in statistical and economic research, information and analysis), the BC Student Outcomes Research Forum (which represents the interests of British Columbia's Ministry of Advanced Education, Skills and Training, and all of the participating post-secondary institutions) found that 97 per cent of bachelor's degree students at Capilano University were satisfied with their education, one of the top two ratings in the Province of British Columbia. In having aligned its program offerings with the BC Skills for Jobs Blueprint to ensure that students are career-ready for the most in-demand jobs when they graduate, CapU has a 96 per cent job placement rating amongst its graduates of bachelor's degree programs. == History  Founding === The school boards of North and West Vancouver, Howe Sound and Sechelt formed a committee to determine the need for a community college to serve the region. The proposal to build a college on the North Shore passed by a plebiscite in North and West Vancouver and the Howe Sound in 1968. The provincial government granted approval, and Capilano College had its name selected from submissions made by North Shore residents, in honour of Chief Joe Capilano of the Sḵwx̱wú7mesh Coast Salish nation. Capilano College opened on September 10, 1968 with 784 students attending classes after hours at West Vancouver Secondary. The Capilano College Foundation was created in 1970 to provide scholarships and bursaries for students. In 1970, construction began on the North Vancouver campus in the Lynnmour area. Three years later, the permanent North Vancouver campus opened with 1,965 students in attendance. The first vocational programs were offered in portable buildings brought from West Vancouver Secondary. The first permanent structure at the North Vancouver campus, the original library building, also opened. In 1975 Capilano College opened the Squamish Learning Centre and Community Information Services at 38038 Cleveland Avenue in Squamish. In 1976, the Arbutus building opened at the North Vancouver campus and the Fir building opened in 1982. In 1991, the Cedar building, the Sportsplex, and Horticulture building were completed. Two years later, a new library replaced the former at the North Vancouver campus, tripling the size of existing library space. In 1996, the Birch building at the North Vancouver campus was completed, housing a performance theatre, classrooms, student services, and teaching space. The Child Care Centre also opened the same year. With regards to its satellite locations, the University opened the Capilano kálax-ay Sunshine Coast campus in Sechelt in 1977, and the CapU Lonsdale location in 2019. === Expansion === Capilano College offered its first bachelor degree, a collaborative degree in music therapy, with the British Columbia Open University in 1990 and added a second music degree in jazz studies in 1992. Business administration degrees were first offered in 1993. That year, Capilano College also conferred its first associate degrees, which are now available to students in a variety of subject areas from Interdisciplinary Arts, Creative Writing, English, Global Stewardship, Psychology, Interdisciplinary Sciences and Biology. The College was authorized by the provincial government in 2003 to become the first college in British Columbia to independently grant applied degrees after the dissolution of the B.C. Open University. In 2004, Capilano College was also named by the provincial government as host of the British Columbia Centre for Tourism Leadership and Innovation, in preparations for the 2010 Winter Olympics. The Centre addressed tourism issues, helped provide tourism education, and was part of the larger British Columbia Tourism and Hospitality Education and Training Consortium. In 2008, the centre was merged into Link BC, an education network for tourism and hospitality with industry organizations which resulted in partnerships with organizations and opportunities for students. In 2008, the provincial government changed Capilano College's designation to Capilano University. CapU also joined the OpenCourseWare consortium, and began the process for accreditation from the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities (which it received in 2012). == Campuses == Capilano University's main campus is located at 2055 Purcell Way in North Vancouver (district municipality), on Metro Vancouver's North Shore. It is approximately a 30-minute drive from Downtown Vancouver. The majority of the programs are offered at this campus. There is also a smaller regional campus, referred to as the kálax-ay Sunshine Coast Campus in Sechelt, British Columbia that serves the communities of the Sunshine Coast.

The CSU is the resident student society of Capilano University and benefits the university and the community by advancing the interests of students. Like other student societies in British Columbia, the CSU's mandate is to advocate for students and provide services and events that improve the student experience. While the day-to-day management and operations are entrusted to a board of directors composed of elected students, governed by the constitution and bylaws of the society, students are ultimately in control of the activities of the CSU. The board of directors consists of five vice-presidents, seven liaisons representing special interest groups, two representatives for each faculty, four senate representatives, and two representatives to the university's board of governors. The CSU is registered under the Society Act of B.C. and receives funding from membership fees, collected from students by the university in accordance with the University Act. The CSU provides services to its members, including a low-cost transit pass, free day planner, a used book sale, and health and dental benefits. Student interests are represented by the CSU, and the views of students are presented and advocated for in meetings with university administrators and representatives of local, provincial and federal governments. The student society also promotes the development of the campus community and improves the student experience by hosting events and supporting the development of student clubs and associations. == Notable alumni == In 2019, internationally acclaimed singer and songwriter Sarah McLachlan received the degree of Doctor of Fine Arts, honoris causa from Capilano University, and expressed her strong appreciation for CapU's values in \\"striving to become a diverse and progressive student-centred place of learning.\\" In 2018, a short film made by Malibu Taetz, a Motion Picture Arts graduate, was included in the Short Film Corner at the Cannes Film Festival which was the second time a CapU graduate received this honour.

One of his most popular early singles, \\"Uptight (Everything's Alright)\\" was the first Stevie Wonder hit single to be co-written by the artist. A notable success, \\"Uptight (Everything's Alright)\\" peaked at number 3 on the Billboard Pop Singles chart in early 1966, at the same time reaching the top of the Billboard R&B; Singles chart for five weeks. Billboard ranked it as the 59th biggest American hit of 1966. An accompanying album, Up-Tight (1966), was rushed into production to capitalize on the single's success. It also garnered Wonder his first two career Grammy Award nominations for Best R&B; Song and Best R&B; Performance. ==Background== The single was a watershed in Wonder's career for several reasons. Aside from the US number-one \\"Fingertips\\" (1963), only two of Wonder's singles, \\"Workout, Stevie, Workout\\" (1963) and \\"Hey Harmonica Man\\" (1964) had both peaked inside of the top forty of the US Billboard Hot 100 chart, peaking at #33 and #29 on that chart respectively. And despite receiving a modicum of chart success, the then 15-year-old Wonder was in danger of being let go. In addition, Wonder's voice had begun to change, and Motown CEO Berry Gordy was worried that he would no longer be a commercially viable artist. As it turned out, however, producer Clarence Paul found it easier to work with Wonder's now-mature tenor voice, and Sylvia Moy and Henry Cosby set about writing a new song for the artist, based upon an instrumental riff Wonder had devised. Nelson George, in Where Did Our Love Go? The Rise and Fall of the Motown Sound,George, Nelson. Where Did Our Love Go?: the rise & fall of the Motown sound By Nelson George. Omnibus Press, 2003. recorded that Wonder had also sought something based on the driving beat of the Rolling Stones' \\"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\\", after playing several dates with the Stones on tour and being impressed with the British band. As Wonder presented his ideas, finished or not, \\"he went through everything,\\" remembered Moy. \\"I asked, 'Are you sure you don't have anything else?' He started singing and playing 'Everything is alright, uptight.' That was as much as he had. I said, 'That's it. Let's work with that.'\\"Mojo Magazine, January 1996, pg. 32 The resulting song, \\"Uptight (Everything's Alright)\\", features lyrics which depict a poor young man's appreciation for a rich girl's seeing beyond his poverty to his true worth. On the day of the recording, Moy had completed the lyrics, but didn't have them in Braille for Wonder to read, and so sang the song to him as he was recording it. She sang a line ahead of him, and he simply repeated the lines as he heard them. In 2008, Moy commented that \\"he never missed a beat\\" during the recording.Martin Freeman Goes to Motown, BBC television, January 6, 2009 ==Personnel== *Stevie Wonder – vocals, keyboards *James Jamerson – bass *Benny Benjamin – drums *The Funk Brothers – additional instrumentation *The Andantes – background vocals ==ChartsWeekly charts=== {| class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" |- !

In the franchise, its jurisdiction exists under the Ministry of Internal Affairs. In some translations, the name is given as Public Safety Section 9. In the original film, it is known as the Shell Squad or Security Police Section 9. In the original publication of the manga, it was known as Mobile Armored Riot Police Section 9.https://www.cbr.com/ghost-in-the-shell- section-9-never-knew/ Regardless of translation, when spoken of by the characters, it is simply referred to as Section 9. The Section-9 is composed of former military officers, forensics scientists, and police detectives; these agents answer only to the Chief Director and the Prime Minister of Japan. Most information about Section 9 remains highly classified; the Ministry of Home Affairs does not comment on the details of its activities. The public at large is unaware that Section 9 even exists, though the National Diet and other security forces sections are generally aware of them as a black operation unit. This allows Section-9 to operate independently from governmental oversight, cutting through red tape and bureaucracy. Many of Section-9's functions are unique, its activities in support of national security are comparable to those of the American FBI, the British MI5 and the Russian FSB. Their structure was based on the German GSG-9. Due to cross- training exercises in the past with the British SAS's 22nd Regiment, which also included personnel exchanges,Stand Alone Complex Visual Book 1, page 14. Section 9's structure has been partially influenced by the British SAS. ==History== Public Security Section 9 was established as a search and rescue organization; its mission statement has evolved to meet the demands of an uncertain and changing world characterized by invisible enemies who can destabilize entire countries from a simple reach of their keyboard, and by a blurring of the lines—between war and politics, combatants and civilians, crime and terrorism—have become increasingly irrelevant. Officially billed as an international organization, it is actually a counter-terrorist network and anti-crime unit operating in the Japanese National Public Safety Commission.https://time.com/3654108/scarlett-johansson-ghost-in-the-shell- anime-manga/ The organization is modeled on the idea that counter-terrorism traditionally consists of two interlocking areas: \\"pre-\\" and a \\"post- incident\\". With its unique organizational structure, Section 9 is empowered and expected to handle both areas, removing bureaucracy and logistics that might otherwise slowdown the process. Its operatives are allowed to act with or without government consent as they are almost unknown to the public eye. In particular, Section 9 and its members are among the best counter-fourth generation cyberwarfare operatives in the country, and as a result usually end up involved in cybercrime cases relating to cybernetic lifeforms and the Internet, such as hacking and cyberterrorism. Even though Section 9 team is the \\"crème de la crème\\" of military prowess, there is a competitiveness with the other Section teams as well. ===Ghost in the Shell (1995)=== Major Motoko Kusanagi is dispatched by Section 9 to spy on a building in New Port City. A foreign power conspires to recruit a domestic programmer to fix the Project 2501 \\"bug.\\" The team moves in while Major activates her thermoptic camouflage. The foreign official refuses to return the programmer, while Kusanagi moves in and kills him. ===Stand Alone Complex==Season 1==== During the investigation of the Laughing Man case, Major Kusanagi poses as the Laughing Man in order to uncover a conspiracy against Serano Genomics, a nanotechnology (micro machine) company by the Japanese government. After higher-ranking government officials uncover information about the Section 9 investigation, the government disbands the agency and declares war on them. In preparation for an attack on their headquarters by the Umibozu's shock troopers and their Type 303 Armed Suit robots, all remaining Section 9 members barricade themselves into the building and fight the invaders with heavy weaponry. Failing that, they assemble a diversion and escape through a passage in the sewers of New Port City. They are all eventually captured, with the Major apparently killed. Togusa spends the next three months wondering what happened to the rest of Section 9 before encountering Batou. The whole thing turns out to have been Aramaki's plan, sacrificing Section 9 in order to leave the prime suspect wide-open to arrest, investigation, and prosecution. Everyone, including the Major is fine, and Aramaki is in the process of rebuilding and securing funding for the newly-reborn Section 9, which happens in 2nd GIG. ====Season 2==== The second season starts with Section 9 non-existent in an official capacity due to an amendment to the Special Forces Bill. The first episode involves a hostage situation in which nine terrorists, who call themselves the Individual Eleven, are holed up in the Chinese Embassy, demanding a swift change in the Refugee Action Policy. They demand the freedom of the refugees from the stand point that refugees drain the country. The previous PM of Japan issued a temporary bill that allowed for the entrance of refugees into certain zones, but the bill was never repealed. Because the new PM, Kayabuki, plans to repeal the policy soon, she has to act quickly on the terrorists before their demands become known in order to ensure it doesn't appear that she was caving in to terrorist pressure. Section 9 is promised full reestablishment, and the approval of their new budget proposal that includes the reinstatement of think tanks (Tachikomas), on the condition that there are no hostage casualties in the process of stopping the terrorists before the press blackout runs out. From this point on the 2nd season goes on to focus on the refugee issue from multiple perspectives, along with providing additional background information on almost all of the characters. A new group emerges in this season, The Individual Eleven. This group first appears in the premiere episode as a group of Individual Eleven \\"copycats\\" take hostages in the Chinese Embassy. Later in the series it is revealed that the Individual Eleven's true intentions were to harm the wellbeing of refugees that had taken shelter in Japan at the end of World War IV. This group destroys itself in a public display of mutually assisted suicide among the members. Only one survives, Hideo Kuze, who then sides with the refugees and confounds Section 9 as to his motives. ====Solid State Society==== Section 9 is radically reformed after the Major leaves in order to pursue investigations of her own. The section has increased in size, and is now run by Togusa because Batou declined the position. Solid State Society initially focuses on the cyberbrain suicides of members of a terrorist organization that gained asylum in Japan. This case leads to the discovery that around twenty thousand children may have been abducted. The mastermind behind the crimes is known as \\"The Puppeteer,\\" and is classified as a Super Wizard Class Hacker. ===Arise=== Arise is an alternate universe telling of the formation of Section 9. Major Kusanagi, an ex-army hacker, is recruited by Aramaki and charged with putting together a team to deal with high level hacking threats. Over the course of the series, while pursuing her own personal investigation, she encounters and works with (sometimes double crossed by) all of the original team members. At the end of the series she offers them positions on her team. A notable change is that Togusa is involved from the beginning rather than being recruited some time after the team's formation. ===Ghost in the Shell (2017)=== According to Tawanda Manyimo, part of what makes the Section 9 group so interesting is they aren't controlled by the government. \\"We are able to cut through red tape and bureaucracy it seems,\\" he said \\"Who doesn’t want that? We can actually just do what we want, in essence. And we answer to essentially to Aramaki and the Major, so we’re almost a rogue renegade, but not quite. And I think that’s a unique position because in the world, there is a lot of political intrigue.\\"http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/01/ghost-in-the-shell-meet-the- section-9-team ==Location== Public Security Section 9 is located in the fictional Japanese city of Niihama-shi (also known as New Port City). The exact location of Section 9's headquarters is held as top-secret and is only known by the Japanese government and Section 9 employees. Their building is known to the public as a false security company. Section 9 Headquarters facilities include a rooftop helipad, underground car park, Operator-managed control room, cyber-warfare and information gathering room, holding cells, meeting rooms and Tachikoma/Fuchikoma/Uchikoma workshop. ==Members== Section 9 operatives as seen as of GITS: SAC_2045. Section 9's operatives are versatile, quiet professionals: trained in various methods ranging from criminal investigation, cybercrime-criminology, and digital forensics to unconventional warfare, special reconnaissance, information operations, cyberwarfare, counter-terrorism, hostage rescue, direct action and special operations. ===Agents=== {| class=\\"wikitable\\" |- !Name!!Rank / MOS code!!Description |- ||Daisuke Aramaki||Lieutenant Colonel/Section Chief||Head of Section 9 and advisor to Prime Minister Yoko Kayabuki.

They have four legs and two simple hands with three fingers on extensible arms which double as machine guns. Additional armament consists of either a grenade launcher or heavy machine gun mounted in the tanks \\"mouth\\" under its large optical sensor. They possess a simple artificial intelligence and can act independently to support their user in combat. When not in use, they exhibit a childlike personality and provide much of the humor in the series, while also being used to elaborate on Shirow's philosophy and ideas. Fuchikomas were replaced with Tachikomas in the Stand Alone Complex anime due to copyright problems. |- ||Tachikoma||Think Tanks||These experimental tanks are used during combat missions and are equipped with a 7.62×51mm light machine gun built into the right arm and an optional 50mm grenade launcher or 12.7mm rotary cannon mounted on a central hardpoint. They can be ridden in like a vehicle and controlled from inside, or remotely through the net. Their systems are universally linked through a central satellite where they develop AI traits similar to young children. |- ||Uchikoma||Think Tanks||These tanks are covered with ultra-heavy armor (unlike the Tachikoma units) in the Stand Alone Complex anime, in which they appear at the end of the second season and during the Solid State Society film. Uchikomas never reach a state similar to Tachikomas, because the surroundings that they exist in do not provide the requirements for an advancement from AI to individual. |- ||Operators||Operators||Are an advanced line of gynoids designed to handle the day-to-day matters within Section 9. Although they look human, their AI operating systems are not sophisticated enough to process complex logical problems. The Tachikomas demonstrated their own superiority by causing an Operator to experience a crash using the Liar paradox. Operators confirm commands by repeating them back to humans. Operators can act together as a parallel processor network. |- ||Proto||Tachikoma's Maintenance Technician /Field Agent in Solid State Society||Proto can also be used as an Operator. It is later discovered that he is in fact an experimental bioroid, and Proto stands for prototype. He holds a higher position than operators and provides a position similar to assistant to the Chief late into 2nd Gig, and also during Solid State Society. |} ==ReferencesFurther reading== * Category:Fictional law enforcement agencies Category:Ghost in the Shell fr:Section 9 ","title":"Public Security Section 9"},{"id":"1998499","text":"USS Narragansett may refer to: * , a Union sloop, launched in 1859 and decommissioned in 1875.

Approximately 50 km northwest of Vancouver, it is accessible from mainland British Columbia by a 40-minute ferry trip between Horseshoe Bay and Langdale, and a 25-minute drive from Langdale along Highway 101, also known as the Sunshine Coast Highway. The name Sechelt is derived from the Sechelt language word, shishalh, the name of the First Nations people who first settled the area thousands of years ago. The original Village of Sechelt was incorporated on February 15, 1956. Sechelt later expanded its boundaries in 1986 with the inclusion of a number of adjacent unincorporated areas. The District of Sechelt, as it is known today, encompasses some 39.71 km² (15.33 sq mi) at the isthmus of the Sechelt Peninsula, between the southern tip of Sechelt Inlet (Porpoise Bay) and the Strait of Georgia that separates the provincial mainland from Vancouver Island. Sechelt is a seaside community with approx. 35 kilometers of Pacific Ocean shoreline that extends primarily along the coastline of the Sunshine Coast, and is bounded to the west and east by the unincorporated communities of Halfmoon Bay and Roberts Creek, respectively. The 2016 Canadian census placed its population at 10,200. Sechelt is the seat of the Sunshine Coast Regional District of British Columbia. Although its population is relatively small for its geographical area, Sechelt has several distinct neighbourhoods. From east to west, they are Wilson Creek, Davis Bay, Selma Park, the original Village of Sechelt, and West Sechelt. Several neighbourhoods around Sechelt Inlet were also included in Sechelt's 1986 incorporation as a district; these include West Porpoise Bay, East Porpoise Bay, Sandy Hook, Tillicum Bay and Tuwanek. The municipal government of the Shishalh First Nation, which contains a substantial commercial district, is immediately east of Sechelt's \\"downtown\\" village. ==History== The original inhabitants of Sechelt are the Sechelt Nation, a British Columbian First Nations band who call themselves shishalh (or shishalh Nation). Before English was spoken, the town of Sechelt was called ch'atlich in she shashishalhem (the Sechelt language). For thousands of years, the Sechelt people practiced a hunting and gathering subsistence strategy, making extensive use of the natural food resources located around Sechelt, and its strategic location for access into the Sechelt Inlet. Europeans began settling in Sechelt in the 1860s and by the 1880s, it had become an active centre of the logging and fishing industries with the construction of sawmills and wharves. With sustained contact with European settlers, the Sechelt people's semi-nomadic way of life began to be substituted for a more sedentary life in Sechelt, a change heavily influenced by the establishment of a Roman Catholic church by the Oblates of Mary Immaculate. Our Lady of the Rosary was completed in 1890 and cost the Sechelt people a sum of $8,000 to construct. In 1906, this church was destroyed in a fire, and a year later another church was erected in its place called Our Lady of Lourdes but this too was also destroyed by fire in October, 1970. The natural beauty of the Sunshine Coast soon attracted tourists, who arrived at the wharves at Trail Bay via steamship. The construction of the original provincial highway in 1952, Highway 101, now also known as Sunshine Coast Highway, and the accompanying commencement of ferry service to Horseshoe Bay (near Vancouver) and Powell River (hence to Vancouver Island) accelerated tourism and residential growth, which continues today. . ==Geography== Sechelt is a municipality on the Sunshine Coast, west northwest of Vancouver BC. Sechelt is located on an isthmus, a narrow strip of land that bridges between the Sechelt Peninsula and the BC mainland. This isthmus is bounded on the north by the Sechelt Inlet, and on the south by the Strait of Georgia. === Climate === Sechelt's climate is Cfb (Temperate Oceanic) according to the Köppen climate classification, and is designated as Plant Hardiness Zone 8a by Environment Canada. It has the warmest nights in Canada. ==Demographics and character== According to Statistics Canada, most residents of the municipality are over 45; and, indeed, Sechelt has become increasingly attractive to retirees from across Canada. Perhaps as a result, new upscale subdivisions and smaller residential developments have grown significantly in recent years. Statistics Canada recorded the population of Sechelt as 10,200 in 2016 which is a 10% growth from the previous 2011 census. The village itself, the original locus of Sechelt, includes Clayton's Heritage Market (a grocery store named after its pioneering family owners) in Trail Bay Mall. A new public library with municipal hall opened in 1997, and a combined provincial courthouse and Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) building, and a public recreation aquatic centre serving Sechelt and the surrounding area, have also been completed since that time. Immediately to the east of the downtown village are the Sechelt or shishalh First Nation Band Lands, containing a shopping centre, movie theatre, museum, gift shop and one of the largest open-pit gravel quarries in North America. Other Sechelt area landmarks include: * Sechelt Hospital (originally St. Mary's, the Sunshine Coast's first hospital, renamed in 2015) * A satellite campus of Capilano University * The local regional government offices of the Sunshine Coast Regional District * Sechelt airport, presently a small regional aerodrome, a few kilometres east of the downtown village in the Wilson Creek neighbourhood * Davis Bay, with a public seawall walk, wharf, and lands for a public waterfront park, presently known as Mission Point Park ==Recreation and tourism== Like other parts of the Sunshine Coast, Sechelt is known for its natural beauty, and is a popular destination for outdoor activities that include kayaking, diving, snowshoeing and skiing, hiking and backpacking, camping and mountain biking. There is an 18-hole public golf course, and a number of small marinas are available around Sechelt Inlet. Sechelt has several municipal parks, and larger provincial parks are nearby. Auto enthusiasts come from around the Pacific Northwest for Sechelt's annual Sleepy Hollow Rod Run, and the \\"Show and Shine\\" held in conjunction with the August drag races at Sechelt Airport. == Notable parks and conservation areas  Hidden Groves === The Hidden Groves areaHidden Groves of old growth forest adjoins the Sandy Hook neighbourhood, 6 km from downtown Sechelt and 2 km from Porpoise Bay Provincial Park. It has trails for walkers and hikers of various abilities, from easy walks of around 15 minutes to more strenuous treks of 3 or 4 kilometres. A wheelchair-accessible trail of 480 metres into the Ancient Grove area is also suitable for people with walkers, mothers with strollers, and those not so fit. A second 400-metre accessibility trail loops from the entrance kiosk through pristine forest and back. The entrance kiosk features a large map of the trails. All trails are well-marked and maintained. There are signs at all intersections with directions, maps and guides. The Groves includes giant ancient trees, maple wetland, and rocky promontories with views of Vancouver Island and Sechelt Inlet. There is parking at the entrance to the trails. It is a legal off-leash area for dogs. The Sechelt Heritage Forest portion of the Groves is a protected interpretive forest as designated by the Province. Hidden Grove is currently part of the BC Forest and under a special tenure to the Sechelt Community Forest, which has declared the Grove a special high-priority recreational area and mandated it shall not be logged. Volunteers provide daily maintenance. === Porpoise Bay Provincial Park === Porpoise Bay Provincial Park is some 4 km north of downtown Sechelt, on the east side of Sechelt Inlet. It is characterized by second-growth forest, open grassy areas and sandy beaches. ==Education== The School District 46 Sunshine Coast operates public schools in the region. The Conseil scolaire francophone de la Colombie-Britannique operates two Francophone schools in that city: the école du Pacifique primary school and école secondaire Chatelech.\\"Carte des écoles.\\" Conseil scolaire francophone de la Colombie-Britannique.

It has students from nursery till 12th grade. Its greenery forms the lungs and the beauty of the city. The school is named after a leader of the Indian independence movement, and independent India's first Home Minister and Deputy Prime Minister, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel ==AcademicsLanguage policy=== It is perhaps the only private school in India that employs Hindi as a medium of instruction in the primary school. Though primarily subjects such as Math, science and social studies are taught in Hindi, students are taught 'technical terms' which are the English counterparts of whatever they learnt. This equips them to proficiently use the same in both languages. Students are provided instruction in four languages. English is the medium of education from the 6th grade onwards. Hindi and Sanskrit are mandatory until the 8th grade. In the 9th grade, students are asked to choose between Hindi and Sanskrit. The objective of this policy is to produce young citizens who are not just bilingual but equilingual in Hindi and English--international link language. The students have to choose a fourth language from Tamil, Gujarati, Urdu or Bengali. This helps the student acknowledge the richness of the Indian culture. It shares an equal status with music where songs in these languages are often taught. ==Sports== The school has football, basketball, volleyball and cricket teams, and has produced many top class cricketers and athletes who have played for the nation or Ranji teams, including Ajay Jadeja, Rahul Sanghvi, Gagan Khoda, Deep Dasgupta, Vivek Razdan and National Record holder high jumper Tejaswin Shankar. Every year Activity Week is held in the school in which the school's four houses i.e. Shakti, Neeti, Jyoti and Pragati compete. During the sports week events like 100 m, 200 m, 400 m, 800 m and 1500 m race, shot put, javelin throw, discus throw, high jump, long jump and triple jump are held. Inter house basketball, football, volleyball and chess matches are also held. An inter-house sports quiz is held.

It was usually held by a relative of the king and was the rough equivalent of the 19th-century European office of Prime Minister or sometimes Regent. == Origin of the office == Prior to the establishment of the office of Kuhina Nui by Kamehameha, there was a position called Kālaimoku (\\"kālai\\" meaning \\"to carve\\" and \\"moku\\" being an island). This was an ancient office from the very dawn of Hawaiian civilization. During this time before the Kuhina Nui Kalanimoku, a trusted chief of Kamehameha, was the Kālaimoku until Kamehameha established the office of the Kuhina Nui. When King Kamehameha II assumed the throne in 1819, his father's favorite wife, Queen Kaʻahumanu, told him Kamehameha I had wished for her to rule the kingdom alongside him. Whether this was really the will of Kamehameha I is a matter of debate. In either case, Kamehameha II did not object and the office of Kuhina Nui was created for Kaʻahumanu. According to other sources, Kamehameha I had wanted Kaʻahumanu to succeed her father Keʻeaumoku Pāpaʻiahiahi as chief counselor. Kaʻahumanu became the driving force behind the kingdom’s policy during the reign of Kamehameha II. She and another one of Kamehameha I's wives, Keōpūolani, pressured Kamehameha II into abolishing the old kapu system of laws and religion. == Conflict between the Kuhina Nui and the king == At the death of Kamehameha II in 1824, his younger brother and heir Kauikeaouli was still only a child. Because of this, Kaʻahumanu ruled in his place as regent. After her death in 1832, a queen named Kīnaʻu, a daughter of Kamehameha I and the Dowager Queen of Kamehameha II, assumed the office of Kuhina Nui as Kaʻahumanu II and the regency until her half-brother Kauikeaouli declared himself to be of age in 1833. Kauikeaouli was crowned King Kamehameha III thereafter and the office of Kuhina Nui became the second-most powerful office in the kingdom. During Kīnaʻu's time in office, the offices of the king and Kuhina Nui often battled for power. This was mainly due to conflict between the views of the two people holding the office. While Kamehameha III desired a revival of the old Hawaiian culture, his elder sister Kīnaʻu wanted Hawaiʻi to be a Protestant state which tolerated no other religion. For the first few years of Kamehameha III’s reign, the kingdom suffered from the frequent quarrels between Kīnaʻu and the king. ==Constitution of 1840== The 1840 Constitution of the Kingdom of Hawaii codified the office of Kuhina Nui into law. The constitution specified the following duties and powers: *The Kuhina Nui was to be appointed by the king. *All business connected with the special interests of the kingdom which the King wished to transact was to be done by Kuhina Nui under the authority of the king. *All documents and business of the kingdom executed by the Kuhina Nui were to be considered as executed by the king's authority. *All government property was to be reported to the Kuhina Nui. *The king was not allowed to act without the knowledge of the Kuhina Nui, nor was the Kuhina Nui allowed to act without the knowledge of the king. *All important business of the kingdom which the King chose to transact in person, he could do only with the approbation of the Kuhina Nui. The 1840 Constitution created a degree of power sharing between the King and Kuhina Nui. Both were given seats in the House of Nobles in the legislature and both also held seats in the kingdom's judiciary. The position was written into a constitution devised by American attorneys and missionaries. In the United States, women held no political offices, were denied suffrage, and in some states could not even control their inherited property. Yet the Americans William Richards, John Ricord, and William Little Lee all believed it was appropriate to reinforce the power and authority of the Kuhina Nui as an equivalent to the King despite the fact it had become a traditional female office.Dismembering Lahui: A History of the Hawaiian Nation to 1887 By Jonathan Kamakawiwo'ole Osorio. Page 114-115 ==Constitution of 1852== The 1852 Constitution of the Kingdom of Hawaii dedicated a full section (Section 2) to the office of Kuhina Nui. Articles 43 through 48 described the office: *The Kuhina Nui was given the title, \\"Kuhina Nui of the Hawaiian Islands\\", and the style of \\"Highness.\\" *All business connected with the special interests of the kingdom, which the King wished to transact, was to be done by Kuhina Nui under the authority of the king *All documents and business of the kingdom executed by the Kuhina Nui, were to be considered as executed by the king's authority. *All important business of the kingdom which the king chose to transact in person, he could do only with the approbation of the Kuhina Nui. *The Kuhina Nui was to act as regent in the absence of the king, or if the king was too young to rule on his own. In addition, should the crown become vacant, the Kuhina Nui would act as monarch until a new king was chosen. ==End of the office== The power sharing scheme set in place by Kamehameha III in 1852 seemed to work and it remained in place throughout the remainder of Kamehameha III's reign and throughout the reign of Kamehameha IV. Kamehameha IV and his brother despised the position but Kamehameha IV did place the role upon his sister, Victoria Kamamalu. Mostly she just signed and approved papers to the wishes of her brothers. When Kamehameha V assumed the throne in 1863, however, the new king made it clear that he favored a more autocratic monarchy over the constitutional one set in place in 1852. In 1864, the King issued a new constitution that was much less liberal than the Constitution of 1852. The 1864 Constitution of the Kingdom of Hawaii abolished the office of Kuhina Nui and effectively merged the powers into his own office as King. The office was never revived after that, with the Hawaiian monarchy lasting only about three more decades before being overthrown. The termination of the office did not destroy opportunity for feminine leadership in the kingdom. An office of Prime Minister was created during the reign of King Kalākaua for Walter M. Gibson. == List of Kuhina Nui == The female Kuhina Nui took the title \\"Kaʻahumanu\\" followed by a number, in honor of Queen Kaʻahumanu, the first holder of the office, in much the same way that all members of the Kamehameha dynasty took the title \\"Kamehameha\\" after King Kamehameha I. :{| class=\\"wikitable\\" |-- !

It features Eric Clapton performing in various bands between 1964 and 1970, including The Yardbirds, Cream, Blind Faith and Derek and the Dominos. The compilation is notable for helping Clapton's career when he was battling heroin addiction and making the song \\"Layla\\" famous. It is also notable for being perhaps the first compilation in rock music to collect music of a single rock musician that spans time, bands, music styles and record labels. The album cover picture was taken at George Harrison's Concert for Bangladesh while Clapton was playing \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" on a Gibson Byrdland hollow-body guitar. ==Content== The album has two versions of \\"Tell the Truth\\", both different from and recorded before \\"Tell the Truth\\" on Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs (1970). \\"Tell the Truth\\" on this compilation is a fast up-beat version originally released as a single in July 1970, while \\"Tell the Truth – Jam\\" is a long and slow instrumental jam from the Layla sessions which had never been released before. The \\"Tell the Truth\\" single also appeared later on Crossroads (1988) and on Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs 40th Anniversary Deluxe and Super Deluxe Edition (2011). \\"Tell the Truth – Jam\\" featured on The Layla Sessions: 20th Anniversary Edition (1990) as \\"Tell the Truth (Jam #1)\\"; a second \\"Tell the Truth\\" jam also featured on The Layla Sessions, which was unreleased at the time. The U.S. release of this compilation replaced \\"Tales of Brave Ulysses\\" with \\"Tribute to Elmore\\", a Clapton and Jimmy Page homage to American blues musician Elmore James. \\"Tribute to Elmore\\" was one of several jams performed by Clapton, Page and Jeff Beck which were recorded by Page and released later without consulting Clapton or Beck. ==Reception== In a review at AllMusic, Bruce Eder wrote that the tracks on The History of Eric Clapton \\"seemed boundless at the time\\", from the \\"primitive and straightforward\\" \\"I Ain't Got You\\" to \\"Layla\\" at, what was then, the end of his career. What Eder found extraordinary about this 11-song collection is that it, at the time, only covered two years of Clapton's solo career, but \\"still doesn't make a bad summation of his best work.\\" He added that the \\"Tell the Truth\\" jam alone makes The History of Eric Clapton a \\"priority acquisition,\\" even for Clapton diehards. Robert Christgau was a little more critical of the album, saying that while it has several \\"worthwhile oddities\\" (the \\"Tell the Truth\\" single and its studio jam, plus King Curtis' \\"Teasin), he felt that there should have been more from the Yardbirds and the Bluesbreakers. Reviewing the album in Journal-News in 1972, Michael O'Connor wrote that while many critics belittled the collection, calling it a \\"rehash\\" and a \\"ripoff\\", he felt that, despite its weaknesses and bad song selection, it is a good introduction to Eric Clapton, and \\"really isn't that bad a trip\\". O'Connor praised Clapton's work with Derek and the Dominos on side four, particularly the \\"Tell the Truth\\" jam, and concluded that the compilation \\"wets my appetite for a future album\\". ==Track listingUK tracks=US tracks=== On the U.S. Atco LP SD2-803, track 3, \\"Tales of Brave Ulysses\\" is replaced with: ==Track notes== *A1 – from The Yardbirds Featuring Performances by Jeff Beck, Eric Clapton, Jimmy Page (1970); recorded September 1964 *A2 – from Blues Breakers with Eric Clapton (1966); recorded April 1966 *A3 (UK release) – from Disraeli Gears (1967); recorded May 1967 *A3 (US release) – from Blues Anytime Vol. 1 (1968); recorded June 1965 *A4 – from What's Shakin' (1966); recorded March 1966 *A5 – from Disraeli Gears (1967); recorded May 1967 *A6 – from Wheels of Fire (1968); recorded March 1968 *B1 – from Wheels of Fire (1968); recorded March 1968 *B2 – from Goodbye (1969); recorded October 1968 *C1 – from Blind Faith (1969); recorded June 1969 *C2 – from Delaney & Bonnie & Friends on Tour with Eric Clapton (1970); recorded December 1969 *C3 – from Delaney & Bonnie & Friends on Tour with Eric Clapton (1970); recorded December 1969 *C4 – from Get Ready (1970); recorded January 1970 *C5 – from Eric Clapton (1970); recorded January 1970 *D1 – \\"Tell the Truth\\" single (1970); recorded June 1970 *D2 – previously unreleased; recorded August 1970 *D3 – from Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs (1970); recorded August–September 1970 ==ReferencesWorks cited== * == External links == *LP sleeve artwork at FreeCovers.net (Internet Archive copy) Category:Eric Clapton compilation albums Category:1972 compilation albums Category:Polydor Records compilation albums Category:Atco Records compilation albums ","title":"The History of Eric Clapton"},{"id":"1998544","text":"Graziano Rossi (born 14 March 1954 in Pesaro) is an Italian former Grand Prix motorcycle road racer.

Scorpius X-1 was the first extrasolar X-ray source discovered, and, aside from the Sun, it is the strongest apparent source of X-rays in the sky. The X-ray flux varies day-to-day, and is associated with an optically visible star, V818 Scorpii, that has an apparent magnitude which fluctuates between 12-13. ==Discovery and early study== The possible existence of cosmic soft X-rays was first proposed by Bruno Rossi, MIT Professor and Board Chairman of American Science and Engineering in Cambridge, Massachusetts to Martin Annis, President of AS&E.; Following his urging, the company obtained a contract from the United States Air Force to explore the lunar surface prior to the launch of astronauts to the moon, and incidentally to perhaps see galactic sources of X-rays. Subsequently, Scorpius X-1 was discovered in 1962 by a team, under Riccardo Giacconi, who launched an Aerobee 150 sounding rocket carrying a highly sensitive soft X-ray detector designed by Frank Paolini. The rocket trajectory was slightly off course but still detected a significant emission of soft X-rays that were not coming from the moon. Thus fortuitously, and as first pointed out by Frank Paolini, Scorpius X-1 became the first X-ray source discovered outside the Solar System. The angular resolution of the detector did not initially allow the position of Scorpius X-1 to be accurately determined. This led to suggestions that the source might be located near the Galactic center, but it was eventually realized that it lies in the constellation Scorpius. As the first discovered X-ray source in Scorpius, it received the designation Scorpius X-1. The Aerobee 150 rocket launched on June 12, 1962, detected the first X-rays from another celestial source (Scorpius X-1) at J1950 RA Dec . Sco X-1 is a LMXB in which the visual counterpart is V818 Scorpii. Although the above reference indicates the rocket launch was on June 12, 1962, other sources indicate the actual launch was at 06:59:00 UTC on June 19, 1962. Historical footnote: \\"The instrumentation had been designed for an attempt to observe X-rays from the moon and was not equipped with collimation to restrict the field of view narrowly. As a result, the signal was very broad, and accurate definition of the size and position of the source was not possible. A similar experiment was repeated in October 1962 when the galactic center was below the horizon and the strong source was not present. A third attempt, in June 1963, verified the results of the June 1962 flight.\\" The Galactic Center is < 20° RA and < 20° Dec from Sco X-1, the two X-ray sources are separated by ~20° of arc and may not have been resolvable in the June 1962 flight. Scorpius XR-1 has been observed at J1950 RA Dec . In 1967 (before the discovery of pulsars), Iosif Shklovsky examined X-ray and optical observations of Scorpius X-1 and correctly concluded that the radiation comes from a neutron star accreting matter from a companion. ==Characteristics== Its X-ray output is 2.3×1031 W, about 60,000 times the total luminosity of the Sun. Scorpius X-1 shows regular variations of up to 1 magnitude in its intensity, with a period of around 18.9 hours. The source varies irregularly in optical wavelengths as well, but these changes are not correlated with the X-ray variations. Scorpius X-1 itself is a neutron star whose intense gravity draws material off this companion into an accretion disk, where it ultimately falls onto the surface, releasing a tremendous amount of energy. As this stellar material accelerates in Scorpius X-1's gravitational field, X-rays are emitted. The measured luminosity for Scorpius X-1 is consistent with a neutron star which is accreting matter at its Eddington limit. This system is classified as a low-mass X-ray binary; the neutron star is roughly 1.4 solar masses, while the donor star is only 0.42 solar masses. The two stars were probably not born together; recent research suggests that the binary may have been formed by a close encounter inside a globular cluster. ==See also== * List of X-ray pulsars == References == Category:Neutron stars Category:X-ray binaries Category:Variable stars Category:Scorpius (constellation) Category:Astronomical X-ray sources Scorpii, V818 ","title":"Scorpius X-1"},{"id":"1998563","text":"Upton is a village in south-west Warwickshire, England.

Jamukha () was a Mongol military and political leader and the chief rival to Temüjin (later Genghis Khan) in the unification of the Mongol tribes. ==Biography== Jamukha was born in the Jadaran, a sub- tribe of the Khamag Mongol confederation, and was an anda (\\"childhood friend\\") and a blood brother to Temüjin. According to The Secret History of the Mongols, when Börte, wife of Temüjin, was abducted by the Three Merkits; Wang Khan, Jamukha and Temüjin combined forces against the Merkits to recover her. In 1201, the leaders of the thirteen remaining tribes hostile to Temüjin (among them the Merkits, Tatar, and Naimans) and the Mongol tribes not allied with him (Jadaran, Taichuud, and others) assembled a kurultai and elected Jamukha as Gur Khan, universal ruler, a title used by the rulers of the Kara- Khitan Khanate. Jamukha's assumption of this title was the final breach between Temüjin and Jamukha, leading Temüjin to form a coalition of tribes to oppose him. In the fall of that year, a great battle broke out between Jamukha's alliance and the Keraite-Khamag Mongol alliance at the Ergune valley. This decisive battle, known as the Battle of the Thirteen sides, ended with Temüjin's victory and eventual ascension as Khan of all united Mongol tribes. Jamukha was less successful in building a coalition. For example, he did not recruit shepherds who lacked tribal status in the Mongol tradition, which allowed Temüjin to recover from a series of military defeats inflicted by Jamukha and to emerge victorious. ==Death== Jamukha was eventually betrayed to Temüjin by his followers in 1206. Temüjin executed Jamukha's betrayers on the principle that betrayal merits the harshest punishment. The Secret History of the Mongols states that Temüjin offered renewal of their brotherhood, but Jamukha insisted that just as there was room for only one sun in the sky, there was room only for one Mongol lord. He asked to be executed by dying a noble death without the spilling of blood. His request was granted by having his back broken by Temüjin's soldiers. It is said that Temüjin buried Jamukha with the golden belt that he had given to Jamukha when they formed their bond of brotherhood. == In popular culture == Jamukha is a major character in the 1965 film Genghis Khan, portrayed by Stephen Boyd, and the 2005 film Mongol, portrayed by Honglei Sun.

Coming only four months after the controversial Self Portrait, the more concise and immediate New Morning received a much warmer reception from fans and critics. Most welcome was the return of Dylan's familiar, nasal singing voice. While he has a slightly nasal tone to his voice on \\"Alberta #1\\" from Self Portrait, this was the first full album with his familiar voice since John Wesley Harding in 1967, when he began singing with a country croon. In retrospect, the album has come to be viewed as one of the artist's lesser successes, especially following the release of Blood on the Tracks in 1975, often seen as a fuller return-to-form. It reached No. 7 in the US, quickly going gold, and gave Dylan his sixth and last UK number 1 album until Together Through Life in 2009. The album's most successful song from a commercial perspective is \\"If Not for You\\", which also was recorded by George Harrison, who had played guitar on a version of the song not released until 1991's The Bootleg Series Volumes 1–3, and was also an international hit for Olivia Newton-John in 1971. Bryan Ferry also included the song on Dylanesque. ==Details== Dylan discusses the recording of New Morning at length in one chapter of his autobiography, Chronicles, Vol. 1. Several alternate, preliminary forms of the album have been documented, including tracks which later appeared on the 1973 Dylan. He has played only four of the album's twelve songs in concert; one, \\"If Dogs Run Free\\", made its live debut on October 1, 2000, within weeks of the 30th anniversary of the album's original release. ==Recording sessions== New Morning was released just four months after Self Portrait and there was some speculation that it was recorded hastily and rushed out as an immediate response to the scathing criticism that surrounded Self Portrait. In fact, much of New Morning was already complete when Self Portrait was officially released. \\"I didn't say, 'Oh my God, they don't like this, let me do another one,'\\" Dylan said in 1975. \\"It wasn't like that. It just happened coincidentally that one came out and then the other one did as soon as it did. The Self Portrait LP laid around for I think a year. We were working on New Morning when the Self Portrait album got put together.\\" During the March sessions that yielded most of Self Portrait, Dylan attempted three songs that he later rerecorded for New Morning: \\"Went to See the Gypsy\\", \\"Time Passes Slowly\\", and \\"If Not For You.\\" A number of performances were recorded, but none to his satisfaction. After work on Self Portrait was virtually completed, Dylan held more sessions at Columbia's recording studios in the Columbia Studio Building at 49 East 52nd Street in New York, beginning May 1, 1970. Held in Studio B, the first session was accompanied by George Harrison, bassist Charlie Daniels, and drummer Russ Kunkel. A large number of covers and old compositions were recorded in addition to several new compositions. The results were rejected, although \\"Working on a Guru\\" and alternate versions of \\"Time Passes Slowly\\" and \\"If Not For You\\" have since been released. Sometime in the spring of 1970, Dylan became involved with a new play by poet Archibald MacLeish. A musical version of The Devil and Daniel Webster was titled Scratch. \\"New Morning\\", \\"Father of Night\\" and others were all written for the production. Though Dylan enjoyed talking with MacLeish, he was never confident about writing songs for the play. \\"Archie's play was so heavy, so full of midnight murder, there was no way I could make its purpose mine,\\" he would later write. Eventually, a conflict with the producer over \\"Father of Night\\" prompted Dylan to leave the production, withdrawing his songs in the process. Al Kooper, who is credited as co-producer of New Morning, would later say that these three songs were \\"pretty much the fulcrum for [New Morning]... That got him writing a little more.\\" The next session for New Morning would not be held until June 1. By this time, Dylan had written several new songs, including \\"Three Angels\\", \\"If Dogs Run Free\\", \\"Winterlude\\", and \\"The Man in Me\\". Dylan vacated Studio B and moved into Studio E, both of which were in the Columbia Studio Building, where he stayed for the remaining sessions. For five straight days, ending on June 5, Dylan recorded most of New Morning; he even recorded a number of covers with the intention of including a few on New Morning. The June 1 session was devoted entirely to covers, but Peter La Farge's \\"Ballad of Ira Hayes\\" was the only one given any serious consideration for inclusion. The June 2 session produced a solo piano rendition of \\"Spanish Is the Loving Tongue\\"; Al Kooper felt it was a strong candidate for New Morning, but it was ultimately set aside. Jerry Jeff Walker's \\"Mr. Bojangles\\" and the traditional \\"Mary Ann\\" were also recorded on June 2, with \\"Mr. Bojangles\\" receiving serious consideration for inclusion. On June 9, several days after those initial June sessions, Dylan accepted an honorary doctorate in music from Princeton University. Dylan did not enjoy the experience, and it inspired him to write a new song, \\"Day of the Locusts\\". Weeks later, a session held on June 30 was dedicated to recording new versions of \\"Blowin' in the Wind,\\" but those recordings were left on the shelf. Bob Johnston was still credited with production, but by July he was absent and would not return. Instead, Dylan and Kooper created the preliminary sequence for New Morning. The process was wrought with frustration, possibly the result of the negative criticism over Self Portrait. The first sequence of New Morning included a few covers as well as a new version of \\"Tomorrow is a Long Time,\\" an original composition dating back to 1962. Meanwhile, Kooper convinced Dylan to record orchestral overdubs for \\"Sign on the Window\\" and \\"New Morning\\". An overdub session was held on July 13, but Dylan left those overdubs out of the final mix. These alternate mixes would later appear on Volume 10 of the Bootleg Series. Kooper then convinced Dylan to record overdubs for versions of \\"Spanish Is the Loving Tongue\\", \\"If Not For You\\" and \\"Went to See the Gypsy\\". That overdub session was held on July 23, but Dylan would ultimately reject these recordings. \\"When I finished that album I never wanted to speak to him again,\\" Kooper said. \\"I was cheesed off at how difficult [the whole thing was]...He just changed his mind every three seconds so I just ended up doing the work of three albums...We'd get a side order and we'd go in and master it and he'd say, 'No, no, no. I want to do this.' And then, 'No, let's go in and cut this.'... There was another version of 'Went to See the Gypsy' that was really good... It was the first time I went in and had an arrangement idea for it and I said, 'Let me go in and cut this track and then you can sing over it.' So I cut this track and it was really good... and he came in and pretended like he didn't understand where to sing on it.\\" Dylan ultimately decided to re-record \\"If Not for You\\" and \\"Time Passes Slowly\\", holding one final session on August 12. During that session, he also recorded \\"Day of the Locusts,\\" which by now had been finished. For the album's final sequence, the three August 12 recordings were placed at the beginning of New Morning, while covers of \\"Ballad of Ira Hayes\\" and \\"Mr. Bojangles\\" were dropped. ==Songs\\"If Not for You\\"=== The album opens with \\"If Not for You,\\" which was also recorded for George Harrison's album All Things Must Pass released a few months after this album. A sincere, sentimental love song with modest ambitions, it was Dylan's only single from New Morning. The song was later covered by Olivia Newton-John and was also the title song of her first album in 1971. ===\\"Day of the Locusts\\"=== \\"Day of the Locusts\\" is a cynical piece of work inspired by his June experience at Princeton University. David Crosby was present, and later commented: \\"Sara was trying to get Bob to go to Princeton University, where he was being presented with an honorary doctorate. Bob did not want to go. I said, 'C'mon, Bob it's an honor!' Sara and I both worked on him for a long time. Finally, he agreed. I had a car outside, a big limousine. That was the first thing he didn't like. We smoked another joint on the way and I noticed Dylan getting really quite paranoid about it. When we arrived at Princeton, they took us to a little room and Bob was asked to wear a cap and gown. He refused outright. They said, 'We won't give you the degree if you don't wear this.' Dylan said, 'Fine. I didn't ask for it in the first place.'...Finally we convinced him to wear the cap and gown.\\" The lyrics refer to the 17-year cicada infestation covering Princeton at the time: \\"Sure was glad to get out of there alive. And the locusts sang such a sweet melody. and the locusts sang with a high whinin' trill, Yeah, the locusts sang and they was singing for me...\\" In a 2008 interview with the Aspen Institute, Crosby revealed the line \\"The man next to me, his head was exploding\\" was in reference to his presence during the events. ===\\"Went to See the Gypsy\\"=== It is often assumed that Dylan wrote \\"Went to See the Gypsy\\" after meeting Elvis Presley, as the song mentions visiting with a mysterious and important man in a hotel. The song also contains the line, \\"A pretty dancing girl was there, and she began to shout... He did it in Las Vegas, and he can do it here. This lyric was seen by some as a reference to Elvis' record-breaking run of performances in Las Vegas (his series of concerts at the International Hotel commenced on July 31, 1969). The meeting described in the song may have been purely imaginary, however, as Dylan clarified in a 2009 interview with Rolling Stones Douglas Brinkley: \\"I never met Elvis, because I didn't want to meet Elvis... I know The Beatles went to see him, and he just played with their heads.\\"Brinkley, Douglas (5-14-2009) Rolling Stone issue #1078, pp. 48 In the same interview, Dylan expanded upon his imagined mythical image of the singer: \\"Elvis was truly some sort of American king. Two or three times we were up in Hollywood, and he had sent some of the Memphis Mafia down to where we were to bring us up to see Elvis. But none of us went... I don't know if I would have wanted to see Elvis like that. I wanted to see the powerful mystical Elvis that had crash-landed from a burning star onto American soil.\\" In the final lines of the song, Dylan makes mention of a \\"little Minnesota town,\\" a rare reference to his own childhood in Hibbing. ===\\"Winterlude\\"=== \\"Winterlude\\" verges on satirical, a humorous love song directed at a girl named Winterlude, and includes the chorus, \\"Winterlude, this dude thinks you're fine\\". The song was featured in The Comic Strip's 1998 special \\"Four Men in a Car\\". ===\\"If Dogs Run Free\\"=== \\"Winterlude\\" is followed by \\"If Dogs Run Free\\", a beat jazz paean, featuring scat-singing Maeretha Stewart as a guest vocalist and Al Kooper on piano. ===\\"New Morning\\"=== The title track of New Morning is another one of the lighter tracks, a wry take on country life. ===\\"Sign on the Window\\"=== \\"Sign on the Window\\" expands on the joyous sentiments found in \\"New Morning\\", applying it to domestic bliss. \\"Beginning hesitantly, the last verse of 'Sign on the Window' builds towards its repeated last line not as a forced projection of false hope but as simple, matter-of-fact acceptance of middle- age sentiment,\\" writes music critic Tim Riley. \\"[These words] offer a way of redefining one's values that doesn't mean copping out or giving up. The antithesis of the family man, at thirty a father of four, begins broaching homeliness without irony—and still convinces you not to hear it as strict autobiography.\\" Guitarist Ron Cornelius recalls, \\"Dylan had a pretty bad cold that week. You can hear it on ['Sign on the Window'], y'know, that bit about 'Brighton girls are like the moon,' where his voice really cracks up. But it sure suits the song. His piano playing's weird...because his hands start at opposite ends of the keyboard and then sorta collide in the middle—he does that all the time—but the way he plays just knocks me out.\\" ===\\"The Man in Me\\"=== In \\"The Man in Me\\", \\"Dylan surrenders to the person he sees when his lover looks through him,\\" writes Riley. \\"He's not trying to impress this lover, so the title hook resonates enough to carry things... 'Take a woman like you to get through/To the man in me' is so direct in its expression of the unflinching cues of intimacy, you forgive him the occasional forced rhyme.\\" The song was later featured during several scenes in the 1998 Coen Brothers film The Big Lebowski. ===\\"Three Angels\\"=== \\"Three Angels\\" is gospel- tinged track limning sights on an urban street, including \\"a man with a badge\\", a \\"U-Haul trailer\\", and \\"three fellas crawling their way back to work\\". The atmosphere of the song is reminiscent of the recitations recorded by Hank Williams as Luke the Drifter. ===\\"Father of Night\\"=== The final song, \\"Father of Night\\", is Dylan's interpretation of the Jewish prayer Amidah.https://bob-dylan.org.uk/archives/1241 In 1973, the song was covered by Manfred Mann's Earth Band for the album \\"Solar Fire\\". At 1 minute 32 seconds, \\"Father of Night\\" is Dylan's shortest song from a studio-released album. ==Reception== Critics were quick to praise New Morning upon its release. Ed Ward's Rolling Stone review reflected most sentiments, proclaiming \\"WE'VE GOT DYLAN BACK AGAIN.\\" Few placed it alongside his masterworks from the 1960s, but it was considered a substantial improvement over its predecessor. It was only four months since Self Portrait, and many reviewers did not resist comparing the two. Village Voice critic Robert Christgau named it the seventh best album of 1970. In comparing the record to Self Portrait, he later wrote \\"this time he's writing the pop (and folk) genre experiments himself, and thus saying more about true romance than is the pop (or folk) norm.\\" Christgau highlighted \\"Winterlude\\" and \\"If Dogs Run Free\\", but panned \\"Three Angels\\" and \\"Father of Night\\", which he said \\"make religion seem dumber than it already is\\". While New Morning neared completion, Dylan and his manager, Albert Grossman, formally dissolved their business relationship on July 17, 1970. Grossman retained certain rights from previous agreements, including royalties on work produced under his management, but their publishing company, Big Sky Music, would be replaced by Ram's Horn Music before the end of 1971, putting an end to any joint ownership in publishing. Dylan would gain complete control over his personal management and his own music publishing. Another tense contract negotiation awaited in 1972, this time with CBS. Until then, there would be little musical activity as Dylan entered the quietest period of his career. ==Track listing== All songs are written by Bob Dylan. ==Personnel== *Bob Dylan – vocals, harmonica, acoustic guitar, electric guitar, organ, piano on \\"Day of the Locusts\\", \\"Time Passes Slowly\\", \\"Went to See the Gypsy\\", \\"Winterlude\\", \\"Sign on the Window\\", \\"The Man in Me\\" and \\"Father of Night\\" *David Bromberg – electric guitar, Dobro *Harvey Brooks, Charlie Daniels – bass guitar *Ron Cornelius, Buzz Feiten – electric guitar *Al Kooper – organ, piano, electric guitar, French horn *Russ Kunkel, Billy Mundi – drums *Hilda Harris – backing vocals *Albertin Robinson – backing vocals *Maeretha Stewart – backing vocals on \\"If Dogs Run Free\\" Technical *Bob Johnston – production *Len Siegler – photographer ==Charts== {| class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" |- !Chart (1970) !Peak position |- |align=\\"left\\"|UK Albums Chart |1 |- |US Billboard 200 | 7 |} ==Certifications== {| class=\\"wikitable\\" !align=\\"left\\"|Country !align=\\"left\\"|Certification !align=\\"left\\"|$ Sales |- |United States |Platinum |1,000,000 |- |} ==References== Category:1970 albums Category:Albums produced by Bob Johnston Category:Bob Dylan albums Category:Columbia Records albums ","title":"New Morning"},{"id":"1998587","text":"Putyvl′Frank Sysyn. Between Poland and the Ukraine: The Dilemma of Adam Kysil, 1600-1653. - P. 25. (, ) or Putivl′ () is a city in north-east Ukraine, in Sumy Oblast. It serves as the administrative center of Putyvl Raion. Population: ==History== One of the original Siverian towns, Putyvl was first mentioned as early as 1146 as an important fortress contested between Chernigov and Novgorod-Seversky principalities of Kievan Rus. The song of Yaroslavna on the walls of Putyvl is the emotional culmination of the medieval Lay of Igor's Campaign and Alexander Borodin's opera Prince Igor. After the Battle of Vedrosha in 1500, Putyvl was ceded to Muscovite Russia. During the Time of Troubles, the town became the center of Ivan Bolotnikov's uprising and briefly a base for the False Dmitry I forces. It was occupied by Polish- Lithuanian Commonwealth between 1607 and 1619. Putyvl was part of Kursk guberniya of the Russian Empire prior to the Bolshevik Revolution. It was part of Ukrainian SSR in 16 October 1925. During the Second World War Soviet partisans led by Sydir Kovpak started their guerrilla war against the Germans in the forests all over the Northern Ukraine. It was under German occupation between 10 September 1941 and 3 September 1943. ==Architecture== The Movchansky monastery The main architectural monument of Putivl is the Molchansky Monastery, which dates largely to the 17th century. The foundations of its three-domed cathedral, dedicated to the Nativity of the Theotokos, belong to the 1590s, but the main part of the church is one of the earliest Baroque structures in the region, described in its entirety by Paul of Aleppo in 1654. The cathedral displays strong influence of Muscovite architecture, especially in detailing and sculptural decor. Apart from the monastery, Putivl also possesses the Cossack Baroque church of St. Nicholas (1735–37) and the Saviour Cathedral, a singular hybrid of Ukrainian and Russian church architecture, started in 1617 and incorporating such typically Muscovite features as onion domes. Remaining parts of 17th-century fortifications are visible close at hand; these include the gates and several towers, one of which was built up into a belltower in 1700. ==Gallery== File:Putyvl' Magazyn Kuptsya Bryantseva 01 Kirova 65 (DSC 3096).JPG|Historic shops in the old town File:Putyvl' Remisnyche Uchylysche M.Maklakova 01 Lunachars'kogo 80 (YDS 8052).JPG|Former crafts school in Putyvl File:Путивль.

What became known as the \\"vermouth of Turin\\" proved popular with the bourgeoisie of Turin and, later, Casanova. Cinzano Bianco followed, based on a different combination of herbs that included artemisia (wormwood), cinnamon, cloves, citrus and gentian; it was followed by an Extra Dry version. Exports began in the 1890s, to Argentina, Brazil and the USA, among others. In Paris in 1913, Cinzano was the first product to be advertised with a neon sign on its roof. Cinzano remained a family-run business until 1985. Beginning that year, the Marone family, Turin industrialists, began to sell shares in the business, culminating in 1992 with an agreement to turn Cinzano International S.A. entirely over to International Distillers & Vintners, a wholly owned subsidiary of Grand Metropolitan.Case No IV/M.184 - Grand Metropolitan / Cinzano from the website of the European Commission At the time of its sale, Cinzano's share of the vermouth market in Europe was measured in the low single digits, sales that placed it a distant second to Martini.

It was designed by Richard Berg and published by Simulations Publications, Inc. (SPI) in 1978. ==Complexity== The Campaign for North Africa offered more detail than any board wargame before or since, leading to mixed reactions. The game includes 1,800 counters, maps large enough to cover several tables, and a three-volume rulebook. The rules cover logistics in extreme detail, far more so than the combat simulation. A commonly cited example of the game's level of detail (noted in SPI's advertising) is that Italian troops required additional water supplies to prepare pasta. It is recommended that each side be played by a five-person team, including a Commander-In-Chief and four subordinate commanders, making a total of ten players needed for a game, although it can be played with two. According to SPI, a complete game can run over 1,500 hours. Completed full games of The Campaign for North Africa were rare. However, although The Campaign for North Africa is only barely playable, it is prized by collectors. ==Possible re-release== As of 2020 the game is being revamped by Decision Games, and is available for pre-order on their website. A variety of minor rules fixes have been made, and a series of deeper changes to the oft- criticized air game rules. A spreadsheet system, backed by custom programming, has also been developed. == In popular culture == The Campaign for North Africa was featured in the 2018 The Big Bang Theory episode \\"The Neonatal Nomenclature\\", where Sheldon Cooper is seen trying to lead a game to pass the time while waiting for Bernadette to go into labor with her child. Despite Sheldon's enthusiasm towards the game, his friends are shown to be uninterested, befuddled by its complicated rules. ==ReferencesExternal links== * *CNA Play Group at ProBoards Category:Board games introduced in 1978 Campaign for North Africa, The Category:Simulations Publications games Category:Richard Berg games ","title":"The Campaign for North Africa"},{"id":"1998618","text":"Traditional Tønder lace motif Jordbær (Strawberries) Tønder lace is a point- ground type of handmade bobbin lace identified with the Tønder region of Denmark since about 1850, although lace of many types has been made there since as early as 1650. The term is also used more broadly, to refer to any bobbin lace made in Denmark. Tønder lace was traditionally made in fine linen thread, imported from the Netherlands. Since the disappearance of the very fine linen threads, it has commonly been made in cotton. It is characterized by honeycomb fillings in motifs, square tallies in the ground, and the use of a gimp, a heavy thread outlining the cloth-stitch motifs. It often had large holes in the motif, called \\"Copenhagen holes\\", which were an attempt on the part of the lacemakers to speed up production of the lace, as they strove to compete with the cheaper machine-made lace. The designs used were similar to Mechlin lace, with many flowers. ==History== Tønder lace was mainly made during the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Production started in 1647 when a merchant brought lacemakers from Westphalia to Tønder to teach lacemaking to the general population. Christian IV protected the manufacture of local lace, and didn't wear any foreign lace. In 1712 several lacemakers from Brabant accompanied the troops of King Frederick IV on their return from the Netherlands, bringing new techniques. Tønder lace was a major industry, and most of the region's girls were employed in making it. Little boys, before they were strong enough to work in the fields, were also taught to make lace. In 1801 20,000 people in Tønder and the immediately surrounding area were employed making lace. When machine-made lace was introduced in the late 1800s, the handmade lace industry gradually ceased to be economically important to the region. It never died out entirely though, and is still made today, mostly by hobbyists. ==References== Category:Bobbin lace Category:Danish culture Category:Textile arts of Denmark ","title":"Tønder lace"},{"id":"1998625","text":"Howard Benson is an American music producer and multi-instrumentalist.

It is served by Sydney Trains T4 line services. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999. ==History== Arncliffe station opened on 15 October 1884 on the same date as the Illawarra line from Redfern to Hurstville with two side platforms.Arncliffe Station NSWrail.net Arncliffe Station was designed as the first major station on the Illawarra Line southwards from Sydney and was one of the most substantial stations of the eight built in 1884, reflecting the importance of the locality. The station, originally known as the Illawarra Road Station, was built by Alfred McNeill and William Clark and designed by the office of the New South Wales Government Railways. Like Sydenham railway station completed in the same year, Arncliffe was constructed with two wayside platforms: the eastern platform contained a 3rd class brick station building, while the western platform contained an impressive 2nd class brick station building having a street frontage. In 1906, the northbound platform was converted to an island with a new northbound track. The former northbound track (current Platform 2) became the southbound track, with the former southbound platform (current Platform 3) disused until converted to an island platform in 1923 as part of the quadruplication of the Illawarra line from Wolli Creek to Rockdale. A footbridge and small overhead booking office were also constructed as part of the works. In 1909 the Arncliffe-Bexley steam tram began operation, and a tramway siding was added. The Station was originally a wayside station with a matching platform but was converted to its present configuration with the addition of new tracks. In 1923 the line was quadruplicated, and as part of the works an arched brick overbridge was built over Forest Road, which is now the largest single span arched overbridge of the entire railway system. In preparation for quadruplication, the original footbridge and overhead booking office were demolished and replaced by a new footbridge in 1919. With construction of the new footbridge, the southern wing of the Platform 1/2 building was demolished. In 1923, the existing Platform 3/4 building was converted to an island platform. As such, the Platform 3/4 building underwent major alterations including new platform awnings constructed on both sides; floor levels raised; and new door and window openings and joinery. A 60-metre tunnel length existed to the south of the station, but was opened out and a bridge to carry Forest Road built in 1923.Forsyth JH \\"Station Information A to F'\\" State Rail Authority 1997Arncliffe Railway Station Group NSW Environment & Heritage A new larger timber overhead booking office was constructed in 1925, and the line through the station to Hurstville was electrified in 1926.

Arncliffe Railway Station is accessed via a footbridge and stairs, entered from Firth St on the west and via a footpath across a public park from Butterworth Lane on the east side. ;Platform 1/2 Building (1884) The Platform 1/2 building is similar in form to the Tempe Station buildings, with two gable ends facing the rail lines at each end and on each side of the building. The main (southern) section of the building has a hipped roof with transverse gables clad in corrugated steel roofing with timber louvred gablet vents to the roof. There are two painted brick chimneys. The main gable ends have timber louvred vents with stucco sills and heads. The building has painted brick walls with stucco sills and heads to arched windows. Windows are timber framed double hung. Some doorways retain timber framed fanlights, slightly arched. The main entrance to the building (formerly road entrance) is marked by a gable end projecting in the centre bay. This centre bay is shaped to form a gothic arch. There is one original timber 4 panel door on the west (Platform 1)>side of the building, complete with fanlights and sidelights. On the east (Platform 2) side the building has timber panelled double doors: three pairs with timber framed fanlights with vertical glazing bars. The northern end pavilion (former toilets) is attached to the main part of the building via a brick walled courtyard. The painted brick courtyard walls have a projecting stucco moulding at the top. On the western side, there is a covered over doorway into the courtyard. The small square painted brick former toilet pavilion has brick stop chamfered corners and a hipped corrugated steel roof. There are 3 small timber-framed windows to east and west elevations, and a brick screen to the doorway at the northern end. The west (Platform 1) awning is supported on groups of 2 or 3 cast iron columns with very elaborate decorative cast iron capitals, brackets and frieze to the underside of the awning beam. There is a central gable to the awning facing the rail lines which also features decorative timber brackets to the gable end. The awning is set back from the platform edge. The east (Platform 2) awning has single cast iron columns with 4 radiating decorative cast iron brackets, with similar cast iron brackets attached to the building facade and unusual iron ties and decorative metal valance, mounted on elaborate stucco wall brackets. This was the original platform face of the building. There are steel security doors. The waiting room has a chimney breast and modern floor tiles, plaster timber- battened ceiling with a plaster ceiling rose and plaster moulded cornices. ;Platform 3/4 Building (1884, 1923) Similar to platform buildings at Sydenham Railway Station, the Platform 3/4 building is a single storey painted brick building. There are separate painted brick toilets with three small timber framed double hung windows each side, entered from the north end and with a brick screen to the entry doorway. The toilets are connected to the main platform building by a linking structure with a gabled corrugated steel roof and walls of corrugated steel with timber louvres. The main (northern) section of the platform building is painted brick with a corrugated steel gabled roof, with one chimney to the north end. Windows are timber framed double hung with slightly arched heads. There are arched openings, and stucco sills and mouldings to window heads and around fanlights. The awning to Platform 4 is cantilevered on steel brackets mounted on stucco wall brackets. Internally, the first room at the southern end of the main section of the building has a ripple iron ceiling with a metal ceiling rose. The main waiting area, to the north of the 1st room, also has a ripple iron ceiling with a metal ceiling rose. There are slate door thresholds and modern tiled floors. The toilets at the southern end have timber tongue & grooved partitions. There is one timber 4-panelled entry door to the toilets with two glazed upper panels. The ripple iron ceiling with metal ceiling rose to the first room and main waiting area. ;Footbridge and Stairs (1919) Dorman Long & Co. steel footbridge and stairs with original star pattern newel posts and railings except stairs to Platforms 3/4, which has modern railings and posts to entry steps. There are timber posts to the Platform 1/2 entry from the pedestrian overbridge. The footbridge has a concrete floor and steps. The footbridge consists of two steel beam structures over the Illawarra line, one for street access the other for platform interchange. There is a metal screen to the north side of the footbridge. ;Overhead Booking Office (1925) The overhead booking office was formerly a weatherboard building, which has been reclad with panels of fibre- cement sheeting. The booking office has a hipped and gabled corrugated steel roof, and original timber framed double hung windows with 9-paned top sashes with multicoloured glazing. The top sashes of the windows are slightly arched at the top of the glazing. ;Platforms (1884, 1923) Two island platforms, asphalt surfaces with some areas of modern brick paving on Platform 1/2. Platform faces are brick. Platform 1/2 has a distinctive curve on its western side. Platform 3/4 is slightly curved on its eastern side. Both platforms are entered from the footbridge and stairs located towards the southern ends of the platforms. There is an extension to the southern end of Platform 1/2. ;Landscape/Natural Features Topiary shrub plantings on both island platforms. ;Moveable items Cast iron late Victorian period bubbler, located near the Platform 1/2 building. ;Condition The entire station complex was reported as being in good condition as at 25 June 2009. The platform buildings are remarkably intact. The footbridge and stairs are intact. The 1925 overhead booking office, while externally reclad, retains its original form and many features such as original windows. == Heritage listing == Arncliffe Railway Station is of State historical significance as an important station on the Illawarra Line demonstrating its development from 1884 to 1925, including the adaptation of two wayside buildings for island use. The Arncliffe Railway Station is of historical significance as one of three remaining stations with 1880s \\"second class\\" brick platform buildings on the Illawarra line, and is one of the best examples of suburban station architecture from the first period of construction on the Illawarra line. The platform buildings are of aesthetic significance, the Platform 1/2 building being an elaborate Victorian Italianate style building with decorative cast iron columns and brackets to awnings, and elaborate detail, the Platform 3/4 building being an 1884 wayside platform building altered in 1923 to an island platform building. The Arncliffe Railway Station 1919 steel footbridge and stairs, the 1923 overhead booking office, and the concrete and brick road overbridge are considered to be good representative examples of their types.

The place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The place has the potential to contribute to the local community's sense of place, and can provide a connection to the local community's past. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Arncliffe Railway Station is considered rare for its remarkably externally intact 2nd class Platform 1/2 building dating from 1884, as only three stations on the Illawarra line retain platform buildings of this type and period (other examples at Sydenham station and Tempe station). The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The Arncliffe Railway Station 1919 steel footbridge and stairs, and the 1923 overhead booking office are considered to be good representative examples of their types. ==References Attribution =External links== *Arncliffe station details Transport for New South Wales Category:Easy Access railway stations in Sydney Category:Railway stations in Sydney Category:Railway stations in Australia opened in 1884 Category:New South Wales State Heritage Register Category:Articles incorporating text from the New South Wales State Heritage Register Category:Arncliffe, New South Wales Category:Illawarra railway line ","title":"Arncliffe railway station"},{"id":"1998633","text":"The Nova Scotia Lifeguard Service (also NSLS) is a Canadian lifeguard service operating in Nova Scotia. Nova Scotia Lifeguard Service NSLS has been supervising many Nova Scotian beaches since 1973 and is a joint project between the Nova Scotia Department of Health Promotion and Protection, and the Nova Scotia Branch of the Royal Life Saving Society of Canada (RLSSC) . The NSLS employed 54 full-time lifeguards for the 2006 season, as well as several other part-time staff. Supervision seasons typically run from July 1 through to the last weekend in August, with a few beaches continuing weekend supervision into September. The NSLS developed the Nova Scotia Surf League, Canada's first surf lifesaving competition series, and has seen several Nova Scotians selected to the Core Team of the Canadian National Lifesaving Team since its inception. The service was born out of a 1972 study into a high number of drownings at public beaches in Nova Scotia. Originally called the Nova Scotia Beach Supervision Project, the beaches were organized by region, so that each region is required to recruit and hire lifeguards for the beaches, thereby supplying lifeguard supervision. The program was centralized and began employing a full-time director in 1975, when it also changed its name to the Nova Scotia Lifeguard Service. In 2019, the NSLS supervised 23 beaches around the province and was responsible for training and administration services for several others. == Supervised beaches == * Aylesford Lake Beach (Municipality of Kings County) * Bayfield Beach (Municipality of the County of Antigonish) * Bayswater Beach (Lunenburg County, Nova Scotia) * Dollar Lake Beach (Dollar Lake Provincial Park) * Dominion Beach (Cape Breton Regional Municipality) * Heather Beach (Heather Beach Provincial Park) * Ingonish Beach (Cape Breton Regional Municipality) * Inverness Beach (Municipality of the County of Inverness) * Lake Ellenwood Beach (Lake Ellenwood Provincial Park) * Lake Milo Beach (Municipality of the District of Yarmouth) * Lawrencetown Beach (Lawrencetown Beach Provincial Park) * Martinique Beach (Halifax County, Nova Scotia * Mavilette Beach (Municipality of the District of Clare) * Melmerby Beach (Melmerby Beach Provincial Park) * Mira Gut Beach (Cape Breton Regional Municipality) * Point Michaud Beach (Cape Breton Regional Municipality) * Pomquet Beach (Pomquet Beach Provincial Park) * Port Hood Beach (Municipality of the County of Inverness) * Port Maitland Beach (Port Maitland Provincial Park) * Queensland Beach (Queensland Beach Provincial Park) * Rainbow Haven Beach (Rainbow Haven Provincial Park) * Rissers Beach (Rissers Beach Provincial Park) == Training == Lifeguards employed with the NSLS must complete a physically rigorous selection process. All lifeguard applicants to NSLS must be certified with the RLSSC's National Lifeguard Service Award and also maintain certification in Standard First Aid as well as cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) level C. Applicants are then tested with a timed 500-meter swim in surf conditions, followed by a timed 3.2 km run, and a timed 50-meter carry with a suitably weighted mannequin. The physical test is followed by a written test. Should an applicant be hired, s/he must successfully complete a four-day NSLS training camp with all new and returning lifeguards immediately prior to the start of the supervision season, during which there are further evaluations of skills based on performance during mock emergency scenarios. Should an applicant not meet the standard during the training camp, alternates who are successful will be selected in their place. This rigorous selection program to ensure the highest level of skill and competency has proven to be a successful formula. No person has drowned within the supervised area of any NSLS beach during hours of supervision since the program's inception in 1973. == Nova Scotia Surf League == Nova Scotia Surf League is a lifeguard competition operated by NSLS. Started in 2000, it is Canada's first lifesaving competition series. The format of the series was modeled after an Australian professional lifesaving circuit called the Nutri-Grain Surf League. It has aimed to focus on increasing the level of participation among in the sport of lifesaving among Nova Scotia lifeguards, mainly through providing regular access to competition. The league founder, Craig Durling, remains active today as the league's Commissioner. Prior to the existence of Surf League, Nova Scotians would often travel to competitions in Ontario, Quebec and the United States. At the conclusion of each summer, league awards are presented to the top teams and individuals who competed on the series. Career statistics are also maintained by the league for wins for men and women. ==ReferencesExternal links== *Official Website of the Nova Scotia Lifeguard Service *Website of the Nova Scotia branch of the Lifesaving Society Category:Surf lifesaving Category:Organizations based in Nova Scotia ","title":"Nova Scotia Lifeguard Service"},{"id":"1998636","text":", is the protagonist of Trigun, a manga series created by Yasuhiro Nightow in 1995. Set on the planet No Man's Land/Gunsmoke, Vash is the most feared outlaw who has earned a bounty of $$60 billion (\\"double dollar\\") on his head and the nickname after accidentally destroying a city with his supernatural powers. He is a skilled gunman who battles bounty hunters and assassins working for his twin brother, Millions Knives. Despite his reputation, Vash displays a kindhearted personality by befriending citizens and refusing to murder his enemies. Nightow created Vash as a strong gunner who would stand out because of his pacifist ways, traits that are different from those of the stereotypical protagonist of action films. The manga was adapted for television as an anime series in which Vash was voiced by Masaya Onosaka as an adult and Kōki Miyata as a child. For the English dub, Johnny Yong Bosch voices him as an adult and Bryce Papenbrook as a child. The character also appears in the 2010 film Trigun: Badlands Rumble, among other one-shots. Nightow was surprised at Vash's popularity with Western audiences. Critics praised the mixture of seriousness and goofiness of Vash's character. However, his pacifism received a more mixed response. While some reviewers praised it as a part of Vash's heroic traits, others disliked the negative consequences when his pacifist choices failed. He remains popular in the anime adaptation and has appeared in multiple \\"best character\\" lists and articles. Onosaka and Bosch were praised for their performances, though critics favored Onosaka. == Concept and creation == alt=A black haired Japanese man wearing glasses. Trigun manga author Yasuhiro Nightow has stated that Vash's name was his own creation rather than references to bands he gave to other members from the cast. He developed Vash as having a serious personality with a childish side, and found him to be the most relatable of all his creations. To contrast Vash from the typical heroes in action films, Nightow portrayed him as a pacifist since he did not want his lead character to be a murderer. Throughout the story, Vash avoids killing enemies by disarming them and avoids inflicting mortal wounds during combat. His cheerful personality was used to highlight this trait with his catchphrase being: \\"Hey, sorry. Love and peace?\\" To emphasize that Vash is an experienced gunman, Nightow depicted him as having a strong eyesight that gives him a more precise aim. While making the series, he was surprised by Vash's popularity with Western readers. Comparing Vash's manga characterization with his anime persona, Nightow said his version does not have as many crushes on the women he meets. To make Vash's appearance distinctive, Nightow often changed the character's hair color throughout the serialization. Although fans questioned if this was relevant to the story, Nightow chose not to reveal his reason for it. In the series' climax, it is revealed that Vash's blond hair turning black is a secondary effect of overusing his supernatural powers. Despite his efforts in his design, Nightow regrets giving Vash and antagonist Legato Bluesummers detailed eyes because he drew them inconsistently in the manga. Nightow had trouble designing Vash's gun as he aimed it to look visually attractive and effective to use. Although he originally wanted to create a gun with unlimited bullets, he replaced it with a traditional one after consulting a picture of an upside-down barrel for inspiration. Besides Vash's guns, Nightow portrayed him as having a supernatural power known as the \\"Angel Arms,\\" in which his arms mutate to form a weapon. The Angel Arms adopt a feminine form and can create or give birth to matter. While Vash is the manga's protagonist, anime director Satoshi Nishimura used Meryl Stryfe as the main character. In the anime, she searches for the Humanoid Typhoon and initially does not believe it is Vash due to his childish behavior. To create suspense, writer Yōsuke Kuroda suggested that Vash would not shoot a bullet until the fifth episode, which causes Meryl to realize he is the famous gunman. ===Voice actors=== Masaya Onosaka started voicing Vash in the anime, which premiered in Japan in 1998. Onosaka said he was unaware when the 2010 film, Trigun: Badlands Rumble, would be made and that most of the cast and crew felt left in the dark for a long time before production began. After the film's announcement, Onosaka was happy to see his character featured in theaters for the first time and to work with the Trigun cast for the first time since the anime ended twelve years earlier. New voice actor Maaya Sakamoto said she liked being involved in the film because she interpreted Vash through her character, a bounty hunter named Amelia Ann McFly, who starred in the movie as a lead. Kōki Miyata voiced the young Vash. Johnny Yong Bosch started his voice acting career by providing Vash's voice in Trigun's English-dubbed version. He had never heard of the series until he was hired for the role. According to Bosch, most of the fan responses to his performance were positive, and Nightow found his performance to be appealing. Bosch attributed his positive reception to the story and casting director. He enjoyed Vash's traits, specifically his pacifist philosophies alongside the catchphrase: \\"This world is made of love and peace!\\" Vash's younger self from the flashbacks is voiced by Bryce Papenbrook. ==AppearancesTrigun and Trigun Maximum=== The origins of Vash and his twin brother Millions Knives are explored in flashbacks from the Trigun manga when the children live in a spaceship containing the last few surviving humans who have fled Earth due to its lack of resources. The two are identified as \\"Plants\\" since they age at a slower rate. They are raised by a researcher named Rem Saverem in a space ship colony. Through Rem's education, Vash gains a newfound respect for life, but his brother seeks the mayhem in mankind. Knives disrupts the navigation system, triggering an alarm and waking the dormant passengers. When Knives sabotages the fleet, putting it on a crash course with the planet No-man's Land, Rem puts him and Vash in an escape pod to save them. Rem chooses to stay behind and attempts to prevent the crash rather than escaping. As the two children become young adults, they separate, with Knives amputating Vash's left arm in a fight. Vash is found by a group of humans who construct his cybernetic arm. Knives also attempts to activate Vash's dormant supernatural powers, the Angel Arm, but the plan backfires and a blast obliterates the city of July, leaving 200,000 people without food or shelter. The incident earns Vash's reputation as \\"The Humanoid Typhoon\\". When the Trigun manga begins, Vash travels around the planet searching for Knives. He befriends Meryl Stryfe and Milly Thompson, two agents of the Bernardelli Insurance Society, sent to evaluate claims regarding the dangers he has caused and whether or not his bounty should be canceled. He also meets a priest named Nicholas D. Wolfwood, who fights alongside him. Vash is targeted by Legato Bluesummers from the Gung-ho Guns assassins who are followers of Knives. After Legato confronts Vash, Knives reappears. A shocked Vash requests evacuation for Meryl and Milly because of the danger his brother presents. Knives then tries to use Vash's Angel Arm to destroy another city, but Vash resists and redirects the blast upward, where it hits one of No-man's moons. In the Trigun Maximum manga, which occurs two years after the moon's destruction, Wolfwood discovers Vash relating Knives' exploits in regards to mankind's extinction. In facing Legato's group, Vash fears that they have discovered the location of his home, resulting in the deaths of his friends. Vash learns a ship has made contact with Earth and will be arriving to save them from No-man's Land. Knives uses his powers as a Plant to shut down the satellites used to communicate with Earth. Vash learns of the severed connection and guesses its cause. Gung-ho Guns Hoppered the Gauntlet, a survivor of July, seeks revenge on Vash, but is killed by his partners as Knives ordered them not to kill their target but tormenting him. Vash and Wolfwood continue traveling to Knives' base. However, Vash is defeated and restrained by Legato. Wolfwood, revealed as a member of the Gung-ho Guns, rescues Vash. Vash rejoins Wolfwood, who fights with Gung-ho Gun Livio to the death. When Wolfwood dies, Livio, Wolfwood's childhood friend, joins Vash' cause while grieving for his friend's death. As Knives approaches the city with the \\"Ark\\", a floating ship designed to leave humans without any resources and end life on the planet. Knives begins dueling with Vash. Throughout his past battles that required him to use the Angel's Arm, Vash has transfromed into a regular human signified by his blond hair now turned black. Vash breaks his pacifist vow by killing Legato to protect Livio from the last Gung-ho Guns. Knives also starts losing the powers he stored with the Ark through Vash's actions. Vash then saves his brother from the vengeful ships from Earth. Following his defeat, Knives uses his last powers to help his weakened brother by creating a small fruit tree to feed him. After his brother's death, Vash continues his travels on the planet with Meryl and Milly. ===Adaptations=== In the anime, No-Man's Land is called Gunsmoke. While wandering Gunsmoke with Knives, Vash shoots his brother for trying to kill more people. Vash is rescued by a group of humans from the only remaining functioning ships on the planet and leaves after a few months. He goes to July in the hopes of meeting Rem's friends but finds Knives has killed them. In the ensuing firefight, Knives shoots off Vash's left arm which activates his White Angel Arm, resulting in July's destruction. Throughout the series, Vash feels pressure to avoid killing his enemies. As the two interact, Wolfwood decides to be a pacifist like Vash, but is killed by one of Knives' men. Bringing Vash further grief is Legato who controls the civilians targeting Meryl and Milly. This forces Vash to kill Legato in order to save his friends. Despite being initially shocked by the idea of committing a sin, Vash find peace when Meryl says any person can find redemption regardless of action. Vash faces and defeats Knives whose fate is ambiguous. Vash then decides to adopt a new way of life, discarding the red coat that marked Rem's influences over him. The anime ends as Vash returns with his brother's body to Meryl and Mully. Besides the anime, Vash appears in the 2010 Trigun film, Badlands Rumble, in which he travels to Macca City where he meets a bounty hunter named Amelia Ann McFly. Seeking revenge against a thief named Gasback, Amelia joins Vash and Wolfwood in a quest to capture him. Amelia decides to follow Vash's example and does not kill Gasback, but allows him to be taken into custody. Vash also appears in a manga anthology of alternative stories; Vash being the protagonist who, along with Wolfwood, protects a village from thieves. In the sequel to the manga by Boichi, Vash meets another Plant who seeks her own death. ==ReceptionPopularity=== Vash was ranked second in the 1998 Annual Anime Grand Prix in the Male Character Category behind Spike Spiegel from Cowboy Bebop. In 2000, the Society for the Promotion of Japanese Animation awarded Vash the Best Male Character, U.S. Release award. Anime News Network listed him and Wolfwood as one of the biggest \\"fiercest frenemies\\" because of their constant struggles and consistent friendship. AnimeNation considered Vash one of the most popular 1990s characters along with Spike Spiegel and Sakura Kinomoto from Cardcaptor Sakura manga. In 2009, Vash the Stampede was ranked 17th in IGNs Top Anime Characters of All Time, and Nightow was praised for how well Triguns lead is designed. IGN ranked him as the 20th greatest anime character of all time in 2014 because of the balance displayed between his goofiness and grief in the narrative. HobbyConsolas listed Vash as one of the coolest characters in anime based on his skills and personality. In another poll, Vash was voted the second-best Masaya Onosaka character after France from Hetalia: Axis Powers. Vash has been the used in merchandise, including action figures, plush dolls, keychains, clothes, and cosplay sunglasses. The lead singer of Mushroomhead wore a Vash the Stampede coat in many concerts before it was stolen from his dressing room. Vash also made a cameo appearance in Boichi's gangster manga Sun-Ken Rock, when the cast goes to watch the Trigun film. ===Critical response=== alt=A black haired man wearing a black shirt. Critical reception to the character has been positive. Anime News Network stated Vash seems to have been influenced by Western films and compared him with Himura Kenshin from the Rurouni Kenshin manga because of their pacifism. Manga Life compared Vash's way of life with that of the American Midwest in the 1800s. They called his characterization \\"fantastic\\" based on the personality he displays when facing enemies as he refuses to murder anybody. When more of the character's past is revealed because of his conflict with his enemies, Manga Life said Vash's true self makes him more engaging, something which is expanded by the artwork. Vash's reintroduction in Maximum drew positive comments with a reviewer from Mania Entertainment saying both new and existing readers would be attracted by the restart of Vash's journey after moments of peace. In a later review, however, Mania Entertainment said some events that happened to Vash might come across as repetitive because his pacifism keeps backfiring and no proper solution has yet been given. As Vash's philosophy was tested in the finale, Fandom Post praised the consequences of his actions. BlerdsOnline noted Vash got so much grief the reader would also feel it when reading the manga. Journalists have also commented on Vash's role in Madhouse's adaptation of the manga. Escapist Magazine regarded Vash's characterization as one of the most intriguing aspects of Trigun because while being a pacifist, he fights to protect others and despite his victories, he is never seen as overpowered. AnimeOnDVD enjoyed him for \\"running a gamut of emotions and attitudes\\" while displaying multiple skills that made him the most powerful fighter on the planet. The reviewer also said the change in Vash's character makes him more interesting to watch in the darker scenarios. Vash's backstory and its effect on him were described as \\"really interesting\\" because it would prompt questions from the audience. T.H.E.M. Anime Reviews called Vash \\"the poster-child for the misunderstood hero\\". Similarly, Anime News Network praised Vash's characterization for avoiding cliches often seen in Western stories. AnimeNation compared Vash with Abel Nightroad from the Trinity Blood anime based on their similar traits, saying they might be interpreted as identical characters. In the book Anime Impact: The Movies and Shows that Changed the World of Japanese Animation, Chris Stuckmann compares Vash with John McClane from the Die Hard action films because of the similar misunderstandings the two go through while facing enemies. Some critics commented on Vash's relationship with Knives. His final fight against Knives was seen as another well-developed scenario by ANN. Escapist compared Vash and Knives to yin and yang because of their contrasting natures, which made their antagonism more appealing. Comic Book Bin also made this comparison, suggesting they subtly parallel Cain and Abel from the Book of Genesis because of how much Knives wants to torment his brother. By the manga's climax, Mania claimed the fight between these two characters was \\"the stuff of legend.\\" Critics also commented on the Badlands Rumble portrayal of Vash. DVD Talk enjoyed it, stating his characterization would appeal to the audience. UK Anime Network said the character delivers the series' original pacifist message despite the attention given to comedy. Otaku USA said that Vash's portrayal in the movie is true to his character in the television series. ANN had mixed thoughts about Vash's movie persona. While finding this portrayal faithful to the original one, ANN said Vash's act as a lazy character takes too much time until his true self is revealed. Bosch's performance was praised nevertheless. BlerdsOnline noted it was one of Nightow's strongest points when writing Trigun Maximum, along with the antagonism Vash has with Knives. Reviewers also commented on Vash's voice actors with Escapist praising Bosch's work. On the other hand, DVDTalk found Onosaka's work better than Bosch's. Similarly, despite being praised for his childish take on Vash, Bosch's acting was criticized as unfitting when Vash sounds serious by Japanator. As a result, the reviewer recommended Onosaka instead. UK Anime Network enjoyed Vash's role in Nightow's first one-shot from Multiple Bullets, but criticized Boichi's portrayal of him as childish and almost like a Mary Sue. ==References== Category:Anime and manga characters who can move at superhuman speeds Category:Comics characters introduced in 1995 Category:Fictional amputees Category:Fictional marksmen and snipers Category:Fictional mass murderers Category:Fictional outlaws Category:Fictional pacifists Category:Fictional twins Category:Male characters in anime and manga Category:Orphan characters in anime and manga Category:Plant characters Category:Trigun characters ","title":"Vash the Stampede"},{"id":"1998642","text":"A presumption of death occurs when a person is legally declared dead despite the absence of direct proof of the person's death, such as the finding of remains (e.g., a corpse or skeleton) attributable to that person. Such a declaration is typically made when a person has been missing for an extended period and in the absence of any evidence that the person is still alive - or after a much shorter period but where the circumstances surrounding a person's disappearance overwhelmingly support the belief that the person has died (e.g., an airplane crash). A declaration that a person is dead resembles other forms of \\"preventive adjudication\\", such as the declaratory judgment. Different jurisdictions have different legal standards for obtaining such a declaration and in some jurisdictions a legal presumption of death may arise after a person has been missing under certain circumstances and a certain amount of time. ==Facts, circumstances, and the \\"balance of probabilities\\"== In most jurisdictions, it is usually necessary to obtain a court order directing the registrar to issue a death certificate in the absence of a physician's certification that an identified individual has died. However, if there is circumstantial evidence that would lead a reasonable person to believe that the individual is deceased on the balance of probabilities, jurisdictions may agree to issue death certificates without any such order. For example, passengers and crew of the RMS Titanic who were not rescued by the RMS Carpathia were declared legally dead soon after Carpathia arrived at New York City. More recently, death certificates for those who perished in the September 11 attacks were issued by the State of New York within days of the tragedy. The same is usually true of soldiers missing after a major battle, especially if the enemy keeps an accurate record of its prisoners of war. If there is not sufficient evidence that death has taken place, it may take somewhat longer, as simple absence does not necessarily prove death. The requirements for declaring an individual legally dead may vary depending on numerous details including the following: * The jurisdiction the individual lived in before death * The jurisdiction where they are presumed to have died * How the individual is thought to have died (murder, suicide, accident, etc.) * The balance of probabilities that make it more likely than not that the individual is dead Most countries have a set period of time (seven years in many common law jurisdictions) after which an individual is presumed dead if there is no evidence to the contrary. However, if the missing individual is the owner of a significant estate, the court may delay ordering the issuing of a death certificate if there has been no real effort to locate the missing person. If the death is thought to have taken place in international waters or in a location without a centralized and reliable police force or vital statistics registration system, other laws may apply. ==Legal aspectsChina=== The Chinese law treats declaratory judgment of death and disappearance differently. Relevant provisions can be found in Section 3 (\\"Declaration of Disappearance and Declaration of Death\\"), Chapter 2 (\\"Natural Persons\\") of the General Provisions of the Civil Law of the People's Republic of Chinapkulaw.cn enacted in 2017. In terms of the declaration of disappearance, where a natural person has disappeared for two years, an interested party may apply to a people's court for a declaration of absence of the natural person. The period of disappearance of a natural person shall be counted from the day when he or she is not heard from. If a person disappears during a war, the period of disappearance shall be counted from the day when the war ends or from the date of absence as confirmed by the relevant authority. As for the declaration of death, where a natural person falls under any of the following circumstances, an interested party may apply to a people's court for a declaration of death of the natural person: # The natural person has disappeared for four years; # The natural person has disappeared for two years from an accident. Where a person has disappeared from an accident, and it is impossible for the person to survive the accident as certified by the relevant authority, an application for a declaration of death of the person is not subject to the two-year period. In the event of contradictory applications for declaration, meaning that both an application for a declaration of death and an application for a declaration of absence of the same natural person are filed by the interested parties with a people's court, the people's court shall declare the death of the person if the conditions for a declaration of death as set out in this Law are met. The Chinese law specifically talks about the return of the absentee. The validity of the previous declaratory judgment of death is not imperiled by the sheer fact of return. The absentee or interested party (or parties) must apply for the revocation of the said declaratory judgment, then it can be annulled. The legal consequence of revoking declaratory judgment is essentially about restoration, i.e. the return of property and restoration of marriage. Chinese law restores marriage between the returned absentee and his or her spouse, providing that the spouse has not remarried or declared unwillingness of restoring marriage. This is quite unusual among the legal regimes around the world. === Germany === Conditions for declaration of death according to the disappearance law (Verschollenheitsgesetz): * General disappearance: 10 years from the last sign of life (5 years for persons older than 80 years) * Soldiers in the war: 1 year from the end of the year in which the war ended (war disappearance) * Seafaring, ship's sinking: 6 months after sinking or other event causing the disappearance, for example: gone overboard (maritime disappearance) * Plane crash: 3 months after crash (disappearance of air) * Other disappearance under life-threatening circumstances: 1 year from the end of the mortal danger ===India=== Presumption of death is governed by sections 107 and 108 of the Evidence Act, which allows for presumption of death for a person missing for 7 years to be raised in appropriate proceedings before the court. ===Ireland=== If there is strong evidence a missing person is dead the coroner may request an inquest under Section 23 of the Coroners Act 1962. If the Minister for Justice grants the inquest then the person may be declared legally dead if that is the outcome of the inquest. As an alternative an application may be made to the high court, normally this is after at least 7 years of going missing, but exceptionally may be earlier if there is strong implication from the circumstances the person is dead. ===Italy=== It takes twenty years to declare a missing person dead. After ten years from someone's disappearance, a motion to declare the person legally dead can be filed in court. After that, another ten years must pass before the person can be declared legally dead. ===Poland=== Declaration of presumed death is stipulated in articles 29–32 of the Polish Civil Code and pronounced as a court judgment. In general, a period of 10 years is required to pass for a legal declaration to be made, with the following exceptions: * no one can be declared dead prior to the end of the year in which they turn, or would turn, 23 years of age; * the minimum time period is reduced to 5 years if the person would have turned at least 70 years old at the time of the declaration; * if it is overwhelmingly likely that the person would have been a victim of an air or sea disaster or any other \\"exceptional circumstances\\", the period of time of the disappearance is reduced to 6 months, however if the vessel is presumably lost, the time is counted from one year after what would have been the scheduled day of arrival, or from two years after its last known whereabouts; * if a person is reported missing under other life-threatening circumstances than the above, the time period becomes one year since the conclusion of the life-threatening incident. A court's declaration of death comes into effect retroactively and is subject to legal consequences from before the date of the declaration, going back to the assumed date of death, as declared by the court. ===Russia=== According to article 45 of Civil Code of Russia, a person may be declared dead only by a court decision, on the following grounds: * They have been missing for 5 years * If the person disappeared under life-threatening circumstances, which made it likely that he or she died from an accident, that person can be assumed dead after 6 months * A military or civil person, who disappeared during a military conflict, can be declared dead no earlier than 2 years after the conflict is over A legal date of death is considered to be the date when the court decision declaring person dead was made. If a person disappeared under life-threatening circumstances, the day of his or her actual disappearance may also be considered the legal date of death. The declaration of death by the court has the same legal consequences as if the fact of death was proven: * Dependants of the person become eligible for the state pension * Assets can be inherited * If the person was married, the marriage legally ends * Personal obligations are terminated If such decision was a mistake and the person later returns, the decision is nullified and the person becomes eligible to request most of his assets back. However, if the husband or wife of such person married again, the marriage will not be restored. His funds and securities, taken under bona fide circumstances, also cannot be requested back.consultant.ru ГК РФ Статья 45. Объявление гражданина умершим ===United Kingdom==England and Wales=== Before 2013 ==== Prior to 2013, English law generally assumed a person was dead if, after seven years: * There was no evidence that they were still alive. * The people most likely to have heard from them had no contact. * Inquiries made of that person had no success.House of Commons Justice Committee, Presumption of Death, Twelfth Report of Session 2010–12 Report, February 7, 2012 This was a rebuttable presumption at common law – if the person subsequently appeared, the law no longer considered them dead. Otherwise, courts could have granted leave to applicants to swear that a person was dead (within or after the seven-year period). For example, an executor may have made such an application so they could have been granted probate for the will. This kind of application would only have been made sooner than seven years where death was probable, but not definitive (such as an unrecovered plane crash at sea), following an inquest (see below). Such an application was specific to the court where it was made – thus separate applications had to be made at a coroner's inquest, for proceedings under the Matrimonial Causes and Civil Partnership Acts (for remarriage), for probate, and under the Social Security Act. ==== Presumption of Death Act 2013 ==== These processes were not considered satisfactory, and so in February–March 2013, the Presumption of Death Act 2013 was passed to simplify this process. The new act, which is based on the Presumption of Death (Scotland) Act 1977, allows applying to the High Court to declare a person presumed dead. This declaration is conclusive and cannot be appealed. It is recorded on a new Register of Presumed Deaths, and has the same effect as a registration of death. Death is taken to occur on (a) the last day that they could have been alive (if the court is satisfied that they are dead), or (b) the day seven years after the date they were last seen (if death is presumed by the elapse of time). In England and Wales, if the authorities believe there should be an inquest, the local coroner files a report. This may be done to help a family receive a death certificate that may bring some closure. An inquest strives to bring any suspicious circumstances to light. The coroner then applies to the Secretary of State for Justice, under the Coroners Act 1988 section 15, for an inquest with no body. The seven years rule only applies in the High Court of Justice on the settlement of an estate. According to a spokesman for the Ministry of Justice, the number of requests received each year is fewer than ten, but few of these are refused. Without a body, an inquest relies mostly on evidence provided by the police, and whether senior officers believe the missing person is dead.\\"When is a missing person declared dead?\\" BBC News, December 5, 2007 One notable person presumed dead under the Act is the 7th Earl of Lucan (Lord Lucan), who was last seen alive in 1974 (although there have been numerous alleged sightings since that time), and whose death certificate was issued in February 2016.\\"Lord Lucan death certificate granted\\". BBC News, February 3, 2016 The incidence of presumed death in England and Wales is considered low – in September 2011, it was estimated that only 1% of the 200,000 missing persons each year remained unaccounted for after 12 months, with a cumulative total of 5,500 missing persons by September 2011. ====Scotland==== In Scotland, legal aspects of the presumption of death are outlined in the Presumption of Death (Scotland) Act 1977. If a person lived in Scotland on the date they were last known to be alive, authorities can use this act to declare the person legally dead after the standard period of seven years. ===United States=== The declaration of a missing person as legally dead falls under the jurisdiction of the individual states unless there is a reason for the federal government to have jurisdiction (e.g. military personnel missing in combat). People who disappear are typically called missing, or sometimes absent. Several criteria are evaluated to determine whether a person may be declared legally dead: * The party normally must have been missing from their home or usual residence for an extended period, most commonly seven years * Their absence must have been continuous and inexplicable (e.g. the person did not say they had found a new job and were moving far away) * There must have been no communication from the party with those people most likely to hear from them during the period the person has been missing * There must have been a diligent but unsuccessful search for the person and/or diligent but unsuccessful inquiry into their whereabouts. Professor Jeanne Carriere, in \\"The Rights of the Living Dead: Absent Persons in Civil Law\\" (published in the Louisiana Law Review), stated that as of 1990, the number of such cases in the United States was estimated at between 60,000 and 100,000.\\"The rights of the living dead: absent persons in the civil law\\". Jeanne Carriere, 50 La. L. Rev. 901, 1990 According to Edgar Sentell, a retired senior vice-president and general counsel of Southern Farm Bureau Life Insurance Company, almost all states recognize the presumption of death, by statute or judicial recognition of the common law rule. Some states have amended their statutes to reduce the seven-year period to five consecutive years missing, and some, such as Minnesota and Georgia, have reduced the period to four years.\\"The missing insured and the life insurance death claim\\" . C. Edgar Sentell, FDCC Quarterly, Winter 2004] If someone disappears, those interested can file a petition to have them declared legally dead. They must prove by the criteria above that the person is in fact dead. There are constitutional limitations to these procedures: The presumption must arise only after a reasonable amount of time has elapsed. The absent person must be notified. Courts permit notifying claimants by publication. Adequate safeguards concerning property provisions must be made in the case that an absent person shows up. Some states require those who receive the missing person's assets to return them if the person turned out to be alive. If a person is declared dead when only missing, their estate is distributed as if they were dead. In some cases, the presumption of death can be rebutted. According to Sentell, courts will consider evidence that the absent person was a fugitive from justice, had money troubles, had a bad relationship, or had no family ties or connection to a community as reasons not to presume death. A person can be declared legally dead after they are exposed to \\"imminent peril\\" and fail to return—as in a plane crash, as portrayed in the movie Cast Away. In these cases courts generally assume the person was killed, even though the usual waiting time to declare someone dead has not elapsed. Sentell also says, \\"The element of peril accelerates the presumption of death.\\" This rule was enacted after the attack on the World Trade Center, so that authorities could release death certificates. Although people presumed dead sometimes turn up alive, it is not as common as it used to be. In one case where this occurred, a man named John Burney disappeared in 1976 while having financial problems, and later reappeared in December 1982. His company and wife had already received the death benefits—so, on returning, the life insurance company sued him, his wife, and his company. In the end, the court ruled Burney's actions fraudulent.\\"What happens when someone 'legally dead' shows up alive?\\" The Straight Dope, June 13, 2006 ==Reappearance== Missing persons have on rare occasions been found alive after being declared legally dead (see below). Prisoners of war, people with mental illnesses who become homeless, and in extremely rare circumstances kidnapping victims may be located years after their disappearance. Some people have even faked their deaths to avoid paying taxes, debts, etc. ==Notable cases== *Henry Hudson, English explorer, left adrift after a mutiny in 1611. *Ambrose Bierce, publisher, author, disappeared during the Mexican Revolution in 1913. *Arthur Irwin, former Major League Baseball player, presumably fell (or jumped) from boat sailing from New York City to Boston in 1921. *Joseph Force Crater, New York City judge, disappeared on the way to a play in 1930, declared dead in 1939. *Amelia Earhart, pioneer, aviator, disappeared during a transoceanic flight in 1937. *Ettore Majorana, Italian physicist, disappeared at sea in 1938. *Richard Halliburton, author and voyager, Pacific Ocean, lost at sea in 1939. *Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, French aviator and author, disappeared July 31, 1944.

Approximately 500 inmates are incarcerated at Millhaven. Opened in 1971, Millhaven was originally built to replace Ontario's other aging maximum security prison, Kingston Penitentiary in Kingston Ontario. A riot at Kingston Penitentiary forced Millhaven to open prematurely.1971 Kingston Pen Riot During the period of 1977–1984, a Special Handling Unit (SHU) operated at Millhaven, alongside its general maximum-security population. A new Canada- wide Special Handling Unit was subsequently opened in Sainte-Anne-des-Plaines Quebec, and the Millhaven SHU was closed. Millhaven also housed the federal inmate intake and assessment unit for the Ontario region (Millhaven Assessment Unit or MAU until 2013 when the assessment unit was moved to Joyceville High Medium Institute (JAU) in order to facilitate the closing of Kingston Pen).Senstar Case Study – Millhaven Federal parole violators were returned to MAU (from whatever Ontario region they were arrested) to appear in front of the National Parole Board for disposition. Millhaven is one of two identically designed maximum security institutions in Canada. The other is located at Archambault Institution, Sainte-Anne-des-Plaines, Quebec. ==Bath Institution== Also located on same property is Bath Institution, a medium security facility located along the shores of Lake Ontario. Opened in 1972, it houses 340 inmates.http://www.csc-scc.gc.ca/institutions/001002-3001-eng.shtml ==Living units== Millhaven consists of three main living units, a segregation unit and a hospital wing. There are approximately 120 men per unit. Units have two levels. Ranges are double-sided and have hydraulically locking metal doors (See video in \\"External Links\\" section), housing two inmates per cell. The ranges/cells are designated by alphanumeric code (i.e. B1, H2 etc.). Main living units are designated by Alpha codes: A Unit = Federal Intake and Assessment Unit – Ontario region (MAU) (ranges B, C, & D) E Unit = Federal Intake and Assessment Unit – Ontario region (MAU) (and institutional workers) (ranges F, G, & H) I Unit = Administrative Segregation/Special Needs J Unit = Maximum Security Unit (MSU) (ranges K, L, & M) N Area = Main intersection and security control hub. MAU (Millhaven Assessment Unit) houses inmates recently sentenced to federal time, in the Ontario region. They are assessed and placed in other prisons according to security needs. MAU is classified as integrated (housing convicts serving time on all types of charges). MSU (J unit) houses habitually violent offenders, and is non-integrated (no sex offenders, informants or incompatibles). Many inmates with life sentences are also housed in MSU. It is considered a \\"gladiator school\\", and convicts who serve time there are revered in the criminal subculture. On September 30, 2013 Kingston Penitentiary was closed. Many maximum security inmates housed there were transferred to Millhaven. A new 96 bed facility was constructed within the Millhaven compound, to house inmates from the Kingston Pen closure. == Security == The perimeter is surrounded by a double 30-foot razor fence, and has observation towers at the corners. A 4-foot \\"warning fence\\" inside the perimeter of the exercise yard acts as a boundary that inmates cannot cross without deadly force being used. Armed patrol vehicles with Colt Canada C7 rifles and parabolic microphones are on guard at all times. There are motion sensors in the outlying property, and multiple CCTV units throughout. Visitors are subject to personal and vehicle search once on CSC property, and an ION scanner is used upon entry to detect drugs or other compounds on clothing or personal objects. The visiting area is equipped with CCTV, and listening devices are embedded in each table. Inmates in the MAU (intake - A and E units) are allowed only screened visits, behind glass. == Notable events == Over the years, the institution has seen its share of violence. J unit is considered one of the most dangerous places in Canada's prison system. The most unruly inmates are often housed there. On July 10, 1972, fourteen inmates escaped a recreation yard by clipping the chain link fence. A subsequent manhunt was undertaken by police and Canadian Forces personnel. Three hundred police officers and soldiers from CFB Trenton created a cordon that eventually yielded the capture of most of the escapees. The event was immortalized in song by the Kingston Ontario rock band The Tragically Hip in \\"38 Years Old\\" from the Up to Here album. The lyrics in fact have the date and number of escapees wrong (\\"twelve men broke loose in '73); this was done for rhyming purposes to match the next line (...\\"from Millhaven maximum security). On the first anniversary of the August 10, 1975 suicide of prisoner Edward Nalon in the infamous \\"back hole\\" at Millhaven, prisoners at Millhaven refused to work and began a hunger strike for improvements to the prison system.Hunger Strike at Millhaven They asserted that their strike was in solidarity with a strike at the British Columbia Penitentiary, and their strike inspired sympathy hunger strikes at Collins Bay Institution and Joyceville Institution.\\"Security Tight at Millhaven,\\" The Globe and Mail, August 12, 1975, p2 1977 escapees shot whilst climbing fences at Millhaven institution Glenn Thomas landers was killed while fellow inmate Florant Tanguay was injured by buckshot. Prior to the escape attempt a riot had been staged as well as the inmates had fashioned “zip” guns and had also smuggled a number of .22 rounds into the prison to aid in their escape which ultimately failed. On July 5, 1985, the warden of Millhaven (Al Stevenson) was placed under police protection due to credible threats to his life. The threats came from unknown Millhaven inmates. He was transferring in to Millhaven from Stony Mountain Institution in Manitoba, where he had a reputation of strictness. Warden Stevenson and his family were placed under guard by the OPP (Ontario Provincial Police). This caution was taken due to the 1978 murder of Archambault Institution (Quebec) warden Michel Roy. In 2004, correctional officers employed at Millhaven Maximum Security were concerned about their safety after a rash of inmate uprisings. The Court of Queen's Bench of Alberta had ruled that an inmate can conceal a weapon (when in prison) if he/she is defending themselves. This ruling sparked a rash of weapon related attacks in the living units. In May 2009, Millhaven was the site of a riot which lasted less than 24 hours.Prison riot quelled at Millhaven pen On October 12, 2010, a correctional officer with a rifle shot a convict who refused orders to stop assaulting another prisoner in an outdoor recreation yard. On December 7, 2010, 120 inmates in the assessment unit refused to return to their cells at the end of a recreation period. They began to barricade themselves in the area and guards fired shotguns and used chemical agents to gain control of the situation. On March 21, 2011, inmate Jordan Trudeau, 29, was killed in an altercation. The event took place in the gymnasium area during exercise for maximum security inmates. Trudeau and another inmate, David Bagshaw, 21, attacked a third inmate and were fired upon by correctional officers in an attempt to gain control of the situation. Trudeau was killed by a shot from a 9mm carbine. Bagshaw was wounded, and was charged with attempted murder in regards to the incident. The OPP Prison Squad investigated the incident, and found CSC staff acted properly. August 11, 2014, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation reported that Millhaven Institution was on lockdown to facilitate a major search. Containers that store cereal had gone missing, and was of concern enough to lock down the prison.Millhaven Major Lockdown During the lockdown a serious inmate-on-inmate assault took place. == Controversy == David Martin, a manager at Millhaven, was arrested in August 2010 and convicted of smuggling various narcotics into the prison, apparently in connection with the Hells Angels. He was found dead in his home on August 21, 2011. In late April 2013, the Canadian Press acquired freedom of information documents indicating that Federal Public Safety Minister, Vic Toews overruled the Millhaven warden, who had approved a radio interview with Omar Khadr. In February 2014, an investigation was launched by the Office of the Correctional Investigator of Canada, due to complaints regarding the treatment of mentally ill inmates. These inmates had been transferred to Millhaven after the closure of RTC (Regional Treatment Centre) at Kingston Penitentiary. Photos released to the public show questionable facilities and cleanliness in that unit. Some mentally ill inmates had symptoms worsen upon arriving at Millhaven. There was also concern by the John Howard Society of Canada that the underground \\"bunker-like\\" location was a very negative atmosphere for these inmates. == CORCAN == Millhaven MSU inmates can gain employment in the CORCAN industries shop. Furniture for federal government offices is fabricated there. Inmates receive a small daily wage for this work, approximately $5 a day. Room and board fees are charged to these workers. == National security == In April 2006, a new division was created to house inmates being held on security certificates. It has been dubbed \\"Guantanamo North\\". Omar Khadr was transferred to Millhaven from Guantanamo Bay on September 28, 2012, and subsequently transferred to Edmonton Maximum Security Penitentiary on May 28, 2013, due to threats made on his life in Millhaven. Members of a 2006 terrorist plot to attack Canadian targets are incarcerated at Millhaven. == Popular culture == The song \\"38 Years Old\\" by The Tragically Hip refers to an escape from the prison. The opening lines of the song say \\"12 men broke loose in '73, from Millhaven Maximum Security.\\" There was such an escape in 1972. The lyrics of the song were changed to '73 to rhyme with \\"maximum security\\", and there were 14 escapees not 12. The remainder of the song alludes to fiction.The Escape That Time Forgot The track \\"Caller Go Ahead\\" on Canadian performer Bruce McCulloch's 2002 comedy album Drunk Baby Project features a caller on a sports radio show who is not able to watch televised games while at Millhaven. Stephen Reid (bank robber of The Stopwatch Gang fame) stated that he was told by an aboriginal inmate whilst incarcerated at Millhaven in 1971 that it was built on a native burial ground. This meant the prison would be forever cursed, and a place of turmoil. ==Notable inmates== * Bruce McArthur - serial killer * Paul Bernado - serial rapist and murderer ==ReferencesExternal links== * Millhaven Institution *Millhaven Maximum Security Cell Video Category:Buildings and structures in Lennox and Addington County Category:Correctional Service of Canada institutions Category:Prisons in Ontario ","title":"Millhaven Institution"},{"id":"1998655","text":"Ronald Fraser (June 25, 1933 – January 20, 2013) was the college baseball coach at the University of Miami from 1963 to 1992. Nicknamed the \\"Wizard of College Baseball,\\" he was one of the most successful coaches in NCAA baseball history, and was also responsible for bringing college baseball to a new level of public awareness. The Miami Hurricanes baseball team went from being on the brink of being \\"contracted\\" to being the toast of college baseball under Fraser's tenure. ==Early years as player and coach== Born and reared in Nutley, New Jersey, Fraser was a three-sport letterman at Nutley High School where he graduated in 1953. After graduation, he played baseball for Florida State University from 1954 to 1956 as a relief pitcher. At Florida State he joined Theta Chi. After that he was in the Army for some years, stationed in Germany and the Netherlands. He became manager of the national team of Germany and after the 1958 European championship, he managed the Netherlands until 1963. In 1963, Fraser took a head coaching job with the University of Miami, a school which did not offer its baseball players a scholarship. Even though the school did not begin to offer scholarships until 1973, Fraser built a respectable program through hard work and endless promotions. Some of the people Fraser brought in to bring publicity to the program were Major League Baseball Hall of Famers Ted Williams and Stan Musial, as well as announcer Joe Garagiola. In 1974, Miami was runner-up to the University of Southern California, a perennial college baseball powerhouse. The previous year, Miami started a record streak of consecutive postseason appearances in college baseball, a record which as of the 2016 season is still being added to. Also in 1973, Mark Light Stadium was built in large part to efforts by Fraser to build a privately funded stadium. ==The 1980s== The 1980s were a time of great change in Miami athletics. The Miami Hurricanes football team, considered the team of the decade by many pundits, won championships in 1983, 1987 and 1989. While the success of Miami football seemed to eclipse much of the success of the baseball program, '80s Miami baseball was in many ways, the golden era of Fraser's Miami Hurricanes. Miami won its first two college world series in 1982 and 1985. While opponents' fans often criticized Hurricane football fans for not selling out the Orange Bowl. Mark Light Stadium was almost always a full house for Hurricane baseball games and Fraser's Hurricanes drew 1.27 million fans in the '80s, the best in college baseball. In 1992, Fraser retired as coach of Miami baseball, and for a short time was head of the U.S. Amateur National Baseball Team. The building that houses the baseball offices is named after him, the Ron Fraser Building. ==Fraser's impact on college sports== Fraser's impact on college baseball, University of Miami athletics, and college athletics in general is hard to overestimate. In the mid 1970s when Hurricane football was on the verge of being eliminated, Fraser's resurrection of Miami baseball was a useful model. The University knew that with the right football coach in place, Miami could do the same thing in football that it did in baseball. Without that model, Miami might have just dropped football unceremoniously. Fraser was also instrumental in lobbying ESPN to broadcast college baseball games, something which is now part of their rotation of spring sports. Fraser also helped get the momentum going to reinstate Miami's dormant basketball program which has seen sporadic success. Ron Fraser's special gift for promotion has served as a model for many college Olympic sports programs around the country which have traditionally had difficulty attracting spectators. ==Death== Fraser died on January 20, 2013 at his home in Weston, Florida of complications from Alzheimer's disease.http://www.miamiherald.com/2013/01/20/3191820/miami-hurricanes- legendary-coach.htmlhttp://www.sun-sentinel.com/sports/um-hurricanes/sfl- miami-baseball-coach-ron-fraser-dies-20130120,0,4960788.story ==Head coaching recordSee also== *List of college baseball coaches with 1,100 wins *Miami Maniac ==References== Category:1933 births Category:2013 deaths Category:Florida State Seminoles baseball players Category:Miami Hurricanes baseball coaches Category:National College Baseball Hall of Fame inductees Category:Nutley High School alumni Category:People from Nutley, New Jersey Category:Baseball players from New Jersey Category:Sportspeople from Essex County, New Jersey Category:Deaths from Alzheimer's disease ","title":"Ron Fraser"},{"id":"1998665","text":"Jean Beaufret (; 22 May 1907, in Auzances7 August 1982, in Paris) was a French philosopher and Germanist tremendously influential in the reception of Martin Heidegger's work in France. ==Life== After graduating from the École Normale Supérieure and completing military service Beaufret passed his agrégation de philosophie in 1933 and undertook a career teaching as a lycée philosophy instructor. His early philosophical interests were in 19th century German philosophy, particularly GWF Hegel, Johann Gottlieb Fichte, and Karl Marx. In the period before the Second World War, he came to know Paul Éluard, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, André Breton, and Paul Valéry. During the war, he was a prisoner and escaped. Then he became a member of the Resistance near the city of Lyon in the \\"Service Périclès\\". ==Beaufret and Heidegger== In 1946, as Heidegger's continued teaching privileges came into question by the denazification committees, he made Beaufret's acquaintance. Beaufret engaged Heidegger on the development of French existentialism, and Heidegger wrote the Letter on Humanism (Brief über den Humanismus) to Beaufret in response. Beaufret took his students to visit Heidegger at Todtnauberg in 1947 following a month-long Franco-German academic exchange at Freiburg im Breisgau, while Baden-Württemberg was still under French occupation. Jean-François Lyotard, one of the group of students on the trip selected to visit Heidegger, wrote about the experience thus: :I remember a sly peasant in his Hütte, dressed in traditional costume, of sententious speech and shifty eye, apparently lacking in shame and anxiety, protected by his knowledge and flattered by his discipline. This picture was enough to prevent me from becoming a \\"Heideggerian.\\" I take no pride in this. These were fugitive impressions, due no doubt to the prejudices of a young Parisian. I continued to read his work. (\\"Heidegger and 'the Jews': a Conference in Vienna and Freiburg\\", p. 137, in Political Writings) Beaufret remained a close associate of Heidegger's, and it was through Beaufret that Heidegger became aware of Jacques Derrida's work. He was \\"a legendary professor of philosophy, having trained generations of students and future professors\\" (D. Pettigrew and F. Raffoul, French Interpretations of Heidegger, p. 6). Beaufret is considered the wellspring of \\"orthodox French Heideggerianism,\\" which was the element of French philosophy that was most dismissive of Heidegger's involvement with National Socialism after the French publication in 1987 of Víctor Farías's Heidegger and Nazism. One reason for Beaufret's dismissal of Farías may have been the latter's revealing that Beaufret, according to Farías, had written in agreement with the holocaust denial of Robert Faurisson (however such interpersonal relations are exaggerated given that Beaufret's interest in Heidegger's thought was central to his own philosophical growth as a thinker, and his focus was mainly on the conceptual merits of Heideggerianism). In a letter sent to Faurisson, Beaufret is quoted as saying: \\"I believe that for my part I have traveled approximately the same path as you and have been considered suspect for having expressed the same doubts [concerning the existence of the gas chambers]. Fortunately for me, this was done orally.\\" Also Jacques Derrida was shocked by Beaufret's anti-Semitic tirade against Emmanuel Levinas.Richard Wolin, \\"French Heidegger Wars.\\" in The Heidgegger Controversy, ed. Richard Wolin, p. 282; Víctor Farías, Heidegger and Nazism, Temple University Press, 1989, p. 287 François Fédier replied that Beaufret actually wrote this letter in 1978, long before Faurisson declared himself as a true negationist, so that he is absolutely not denying the Holocaust (this is demonstrably untrue; Faurisson had published 2 Holocaust-denying articles in 1978 already, and had denounced The Diary of Anne Frank as forgery the same year). Beaufret wrote the letter only because Faurisson, who was a former student of his, had been violently attacked in the street.François Fédier, « Lettre au Pr. H.Ott » in Regarder voir, Belles Lettres/Archimbaud, 1995, p.244 Concerning the so-called anti- Semitic tirade, Jacques Derrida actually didn't hear it : this was reported to him by a friend, Roger Laporte, and Beaufret denied it completely. ==ReferencesSources== * Jean Beaufret, Dialogue with Heidegger : Greek Philosophy, translated by M.

Lohan and his wife lost custody of both their children in November 2015. In December 2015, Kate filed for legal separation from Lohan. ==Legal issues== In 1990, Lohan was investigated for insider trading and convicted of criminal contempt of court. He was sentenced to three years in jail in Nassau County, and was released in 1993 on five years' probation. During this time, his daughter Lindsay had started modeling for the Ford Models agency and was starring in commercials, and by the time of his release in 1993, she was at the pinnacle of her career. In 1997, Lohan was arrested when he violated his probation after flying to Napa, California to visit his daughter Lindsay, who had been hospitalized for an asthma attack that occurred during the filming of a movie. He subsequently served a year in prison. After Lindsay became a movie star, tensions arose in the family. This conflict came to a head when Dina's youngest brother, Matt Sullivan, got into a fistfight outside Lohan's Long Island home, during a May 23, 2004 first communion party for their son Dakota. Lohan was charged with attempted assault and, while awaiting sentencing, was involved in a car accident that led to his being charged with driving under the influence of alcohol and aggravated unlicensed operation of a motor vehicle. While in prison, he took up singing and songwriting, as well as correspondence courses for Teen Challenge, a faith-based sobriety program. Michael and Dina Lohan separated again later that year. Lohan was later arrested on June 29 after allegedly leaving a Long Island hotel where he had rented several suites without paying his $3,800 bill, and faced assault charges in Manhattan for allegedly swearing at a sanitation worker and punching the worker in the face after the worker's truck blocked his car.

He has also been involved in various television proposals, including the Michael Lohan Reality Project, a 2007 series produced by Frozen Pictures, which followed his life, work and efforts to reconnect with his daughter and family. On October 25, 2011, Lohan was arrested in a suspected domestic violence incident in Tampa, Florida, involving his on-again, off-again girlfriend, Kate Major. Lohan was released from custody on $5,000 bail and ordered to have no further contact with Major. On October 27, 2011, he was again in police custody after contacting Major by phone.

At 9 pm that evening, she called the New Zealand Police using the 1-1-1 emergency telephone number, expressing fears for her safety. Although a patrol car could have been made available to attend this incident, police decided to call a taxi for Asher to pick her up. Police said later that people sometimes obtained a free ride home in a police car after making a false emergency call. A taxi was dispatched, but it went to the wrong street in Onehunga, on the other side of the city from Piha. Asher was later found wandering the streets by a Piha couple, Julia Woodhouse and Bobbie Carroll, who took her into their home for several hours. At 1:10 am, she left their home and was subsequently seen by others, semi-clad, walking towards the beach. She ran off before she could be approached. This was the last known sighting of her. Asher's family told police that she suffered from bipolar disorder. In May 2005, Asher's family held a memorial service for her, telling mourners that if police had responded properly to her emergency call, she might be alive today. Her parents, Betty and Mike Asher, were said to be considering bringing a lawsuit against the New Zealand Police, on unspecified grounds. No legal proceedings were ever commenced by her parents. ==Inquest== An inquest into her disappearance began on 17 July 2012. The police investigation into her disappearance found that she most likely drowned. During the inquest, the coroner criticised Woodhouse and Carroll for not calling the police themselves. The High Court subsequently found that the suggestion that their failure to call the police had contributed to Asher's death was based on speculation. ==See also== *List of people who disappeared ==References== Category:2000s missing person cases Category:2004 in New Zealand Category:Missing person cases in New Zealand Category:New Zealand female models ","title":"Disappearance of Iraena Asher"},{"id":"1998674","text":"A navy is a maritime fleet.

He is a priest who wields a large cross-shaped gun named the Punisher, which he and his former colleagues use either in saving people or for complete destruction. Wolfwood ranked number 10 in the 1998 Annual Anime Grand Prix for Male Character. ==Concept and creation== Though Vash the Stampede, the protagonist of Trigun, was Nightow's original creation, Wolfwood on the other hand came from an outside inspiration. There's a band named \\"Wolfwood,\\" and he took the lead singer as his image for the priest. He's also modeled on Tortoise Matsumoto from the band Ulfuls. Nightow really liked the shape of his sharp, curved down nose. Nightow jokes that as some of us might have noticed, he spent a lot of time sculpting Wolfwood's nose.Puff Magazine Interview from Make a little lightbulb in your soul Character Profiles Nightow noted that the project he's really proud of is actually Wolfwood's life and death, and the storyline around it. His outfit was made simple and Nightow prevented himself from adding a lot of stuff, commenting that if he did, he'll be hard to draw. ==HistoryManga=== Wolfwood's middle name is never stated, but Nightow has given varying answers in interviews when asked the question by fans, such as \\"Dangerous\\" and \\"Dokonokuminomonjawaresumakinishiteshizumetarokakora\\", Yakuza slang which translates to \\"What the hell family do you think you're from!? I'm gonna tie you up in a reed mat and dunk ya!\\" After Wolfwood showed potential in the orphanage in which he is raised, Chapel (also known as Master C) took him into the Eye of Michael, an organization of assassins founded by a plant worshipper, and trained and modified Wolfwood to be a killer. The modifications gave him enhanced abilities and the ability to regenerate from heavy injuries using special vials, but as a result caused him to age at an accelerated rate, giving him the appearance of being middle-aged though he is only in his late teens by the start of the series. His potential was recognized as exceptional, and so he was given the tenth incarnation of the organization's most powerful, a special large cross-shaped gun called the Punisher, which becomes his official title within the Eye of Michael. Wolfwood later betrayed and shot Chapel, impersonating Chapel to gain entry into the Gung-Ho-Guns in an attempt to kill Millions Knives. He failed, and was instead sent by Knives to guide and protect Vash on the latter's travels to Knives's base, thus killing fellow Guns Rai-Dei the Blade and Gray the Ninelives. After Vash is taken prisoner in the Ark, Wolfwood rescues him and later departs to December to protect the orphanage from the retaliation. He battles his childhood friend, Livio, and his crippled master in a two volume face off. He manages to mortally wound Chapel and defeat Livio The Double Fang and Razlo the Tri-Punisher of Death, but having overdosed on the regenerative vials, he soon dies while having a last drink with Vash. ===Anime=== In the anime, Wolfwood is raised by an abusive guardian, whom he later shoots and kills. He is taken in by Chapel the Evergreen, who trains him to become his eventual successor in the Gung-Ho Guns. He meets Vash while he is stranded in the desert, and the two join forces. During the course of the series, Wolfwood develops a relationship with Milly Thompson that crosses from close friendship into romance. Wolfwood's purpose is to raise money for the children in the orphanage he runs, trying to keep other children from suffering as he did in his own childhood. He initially holds the ideals that he must kill, though he eventually comes to accept Vash's ideals. He eventually fights his master, but spares him after defeating him. Legato Bluesummers controls Chapel and forces him to shoot Wolfwood, who stumbles into a church. He spends his last moments reflecting on his life and making a final confession before dying. He shouted out his last words in a confused manner: \\"I did not want to die this way!\\" But after saying this, there is a long silence as he comes to a final realization, and dies with a smile on his face. He died leaning against his weapon, showing irony in that his weapon which took so many lives is shaped like a Cross and ends up being the only object holding him up after he dies. It has been theorized that Wolfwood may possess 2 versions of the Punisher, as the number of pistols the Punisher can carry is inconsistent (holding 4 per arm in the first appearance and then 6 in the next). However, this is likely simply a continuity error. Vash takes Wolfwood's gun as an act of honor, and ends up using it against Knives after he hears Wolfwood's voice. ==Personality== He is a priest; however, he spent the greater part of his life training to be an assassin under a priest he looked up to. He hardly ever feels any remorse for killing, especially when it's to protect the innocent. He and Vash have some minor disagreements on this matter, which is somewhat ironic due to their occupations as gunfighters. He frequently shows his frustration at an inability to live up to Vash's non-killing lifestyle, demonstrating the guilt he has for taking others’ lives, even while doing it for good purposes. He particularly looks out for kids, making sure that none ever suffer like he did, and his primary objective has always been to make money for his orphanage. ==Punisher== The Punisher is a large cross-shaped gun wielded by the best members of the Eye of Michael, most commonly seen is Nicholas D. Wolfwood. There are supposedly only ten in existence and Wolfwood's Punisher is the tenth one in creation. His Punisher has two machine guns in front and a rocket launcher in the back. In the anime, the side arms of the cross open up to reveal a storage bin for pistols. After Wolfwood dies, Vash inherits the weapon, and uses it in his battle with Knives. Nightow commented on the Punisher being around a \\"hundred-and-so\\" kilograms and Wolfwood having an \\"incredible sense of balance\\". It has been noted by many characters that the Punisher is a very heavy weapon. Wolfwood commented on this with \\"That's because it's full of mercy\\". Many other Punishers appeared in the series and other of Nightow's work. The Chapel Gun, used by Mr. C against his fight with Wolfwood in the manga, is a large cross-shaped machine gun with four spiked ends at the base of the cross. Wolfwood's friend Livio wields the Double Fangs, two cross-shaped submachine guns with dual barrels that make them capable of firing forward and backward at once; these guns are typically strapped to his wrists and, later, carried in low-slung shoulder holsters when not in use. Livio's alternate personality, Razlo the Tri-Punisher of Death, wielded, as his name suggests, three punishers. When he was in his Livio state, they were carried by his three henchmen, Agile, Zain, and a third, unnamed henchman. The Punisher's cross design bears a resemblance to the Centerhead weapon from Gungrave: Overdose, another Nightow work. The Centerhead was wielded by Fangoram (a henchman working for the game's antagonist) and was used in the same way as Wolfwood's. ==Connections to Christianity == While Western Christianity does not typically perform confessional box confessions, traditional of Catholicism, confession of ones sin is spoken directly to a pastor/minister (source?). Wolfwood continually insinuates confession is part of his purpose, Wolfwood's primary occupation is being a Christian priest, and his clothes and main weapon is of Christian themes. Nightow is generally known as one of the few successful Christian manga artists. Most of the Japanese population is not Christian, but Trigun itself is full of themes and ideas that have connections to Christianity. Nightow grew up as a Buddhist, but studied Catholicism and converted to it, while retaining Buddhist principles. These elements of Western Christianity and Catholicism are found through out the manga and anime. Wolfwood takes his faith greatly in mind, despite being a gunman, but unlike Vash who is much of pacifist, Wolfwood believes himself to be a realist and that violence and killing is a part of life. When questioned about these conflicting ideals by Vash, Wolfwood laments and confesses at the church alter before his death stating, \\"I've always chosen the right path, haven't I?\\" Wolfwood actions can be seen with other of his Biblical predecessors. There is John the Baptist, a non-conforming ambassador for Christ, who walked around in the wilderness, much like Wolfwood hiked through the desert. St. Peter used gratuitous violence to save Jesus, rather like Wolfwood perhaps unnecessarily shooting down Zazie the Beast to save Vash. Jesus rebuked Peter by saying, \\"He who lives by the sword dies by the sword\\". In the manga and anime that is also how Wolfwood was killed, dying beside his weapon. Samson from the Old Testament lived life wildly and violently, killing because of grudges, and carrying on outside of marriage with the two-faced Delilah. Yet God used him as a Judge for His people. Wolfwood also lives wildly and violently, yet is able to be used for good. The Book of Judges remarks about Samson's time that \\"in those days there was no king in Israel, but every man did that which was right in his own eyes.\\" Sometimes seen as Wolfwood is taking that verse to heart in a lawless land. He can also be referenced to St. Paul, who traveled through unknown land to spread Christianity, just like Wolfwood travelling through a harsh planet to save his orphanage and people he came across. ==Reception== Anime Source ranked Wolfwood #75th in their Top 100 Anime Characters Survey based on 19 votes. Saying that \\"Wolfwood is the father of all badass, gun- toting priests. He is completely unorthodox in his methods, but still dedicated to his ministry in his own absurd way. Totally respecting this guy because not everyone can mesh coolness and priesthood with such finesse.\\" Mania.com listed him in 9th place in their 10 Biggest Bad Ass Anime Gunslingers, commenting that \\"Wearing the clothes of a priest and carrying a cross on his back Wolfwood roams the desert planet of Gunsmoke. His cross truly represents death not only in its symbolic meaning but also in the fact that it is one giant arsenal itself. It contains a machine gun function and rocket launcher as well as containing a rack of handguns in the anime.

Population: 507 366 (2020) 92,400 (1970). ==Etymology== In Finno-Ugric languages Bala-shika means land of celebrations, land of laughter and fun.Топонимия Балашихи. Finno-Ugric peoples lived in this area before Slavs. ==Geography== The city is known for its unique river and waterway system. The Pekhorka River system covers an area of from north to south and from east to west, and many small lakes and ponds were created by damming to provide water power for the cotton mills in the 19th century. ==History== Balashikha was established in 1830. It was granted town status in 1939.Balashikha. Official page. History. Several rural hamlets had existed long before on the site of the modern city. The city stands on the famous Vladimir Highway, which led out of Moscow to the east. This was the route along which convicted criminals were marched to forced labor camps in Siberia. The road was renamed Gorky Highway in the Soviet era. The failure of the Decembrist Revolt against Tsar Nicholas I led to the execution of its ringleaders and the exile of many nobles to Siberia. Soviet-era schoolchildren were told that the prisoners were marched in chains along this road followed by their wives. In truth, the Decembrist prisoners were sent from St. Petersburg, then the capital of Russia, through Yaroslavl, and not through Moscow and Balashikha, and the story was invented as part of celebrations of the 100th anniversary of the event in 1925. Between 1830 and 1870, a cotton factory was in operation in the area, with its fabric called Balashikha. A railway station was built at the end of the 19th century, again called Balashikha Station. As it grew, Balashikha absorbed other villages, including Gorenki, a suburban estate of Count Andreas Razumovsky, and Pekhra- Yakovlevskoye, an estate of Prince Galitzine, the latter being in use for 250 years from 1591 to 1828. This is the site of a stone church, built from 1777 to 1782. Saltykovka, a part of Balashikha, has long been known for its attractions to the artistic community. Isaak Levitan, the famous landscape painter, lived there in 1879. Lev Tolstoy was another frequent visitor. ===Soviet period=== Several institutions were founded in Balashikha after the October Revolution, including one dedicated to the production of fur. During the Soviet era, Balashikha became a major industrial center with industries in metallurgy, aviation industry, cryogenic technology, machinery, and other fields. Balashikha sent many of its sons to the front to fight the Germans during World War II. Among those who fought and died was Ivan Flerov who commanded a Katyusha rocket division and is remembered by several monuments and museums in the area. Along with many other Russian Orthodox Churches, the Cathedral of Saint Alexander Nevsky was demolished by the government. The Cathedral was blown up in the 1960s but was rebuilt, on its original site, in 2002. ===Modernity=== The Balashikha Maternity House was designated on July 1, 2003, to be the Moscow Oblast Perinatal Center. This facility will now function as a regional perinatal care facility for high-risk mothers and infants and a perinatal health education center for Moscow Oblast.

Throughout the series he serves as the right-hand man of the main antagonist Millions Knives and an enemy to Vash the Stampede. ==HistoryManga=== Prior to the beginning of the manga, Legato was a nameless slave. While imprisoned, he slowly developed his power by weaving metal threads into his brain, allowing him to take control of other bodies. Before he could fully develop his power, he was discovered, wounded, and raped. However, Knives happened to pass by and destroy the city, with Legato being the only survivor thanks to the power of his threads. Legato immediately becomes infatuated with Knives and swears eternal loyalty, showing his willingness to allow Knives to kill him. Knives takes the boy in as a tool, and presumably names him. Later, Legato and Dr. Conrad, a friend of Knives, found July City in ruins and Knives heavily wounded. Legato sees Vash in the distance, and realizes Vash is the cause of Knives's serious injury, but Conrad convinces Legato to help tend to the wounded Knives instead of chasing after Vash. Seeing Knives in such a state traumatizes Legato, who swears revenge on Vash, eventually leading Legato to plan a killing game to torment and eventually kill Vash. Legato first appears in the manga claiming to be a messenger, introducing Vash to his proposed killing game. He warns that Vash will be pursued by \\"demons\\" who are intent on killing him. Legato leaves Vash a Coin Case, telling Vash that each of these assassins will be carrying a coin. He tells Vash that once he has collected all of the coins something will happen. When Vash asks his name and how he knows these things, Legato formally introduces himself and then hints that Knives sent him. Legato later watches the battle between Vash and the first two members of the mercenary group Gung-ho Guns, Monev the Gale and E. G. Mine. Upon defeating Mine, Vash challenges Legato, stating that he intends to reverse their roles of hunter and hunted in Legato's twisted coin game. Legato first demonstrates his ability to control the bodies of others in a restaurant. When assaulted by a group of slave traders, Legato uses his powers to kill the man by forcing him to tear out his own heart. He then kills the other men that had been with him by making them shoot each other. Legato tells the women that they are free now and warns them to be careful as \\"humanity will soon come to an end\\". Leaving the restaurant, Legato realizes that his previous action was an unusual display of emotion on his part, and that Vash's challenge has greatly bothered him. Following the battle between Vash and the third member of the Guns, Dominique the Cyclops, Legato gathers with The Gung- Ho Guns for Knives's reawakening at the place called Jenora Rock, which Vash senses and rushes to. Upon being reawakened, Knives twists Legato's neck in a 180 degree angle and then breaks his limbs when Legato instinctively moves to attack Vash. Elendira later comments that this was also influenced by the fact that Legato had used The Gung-Ho Guns to settle his personal vendetta against Vash, and that it is amazing that Knives should decide Legato's life worth sparing at all. Legato's wounded body is then placed in a coffin that is chained shut except for the head area. He uses his controlling powers on a large ogre creature to serve as his transportation. The creature is killed and Legato forcibly taken back by Elendira following the battle between Vash and Hoppered, and Legato is placed in a new coffin with primitive metal limbs. When Vash and Wolfwood finally reach Knives, Legato uses his abilities to restrain Vash as a prisoner for eight months straight, which greatly weakens him. Wolfwood later betrays the Guns and rescues Vash, shooting the weakened Legato in the back of the head. The wounded Legato is left in a catatonic state, with his body slowing breaking down. However, Legato reveals a full recovery in time to save Knives from Zazie the Beast, where it is revealed his power functions through the use of microscopic strings that connects his mind to the muscles of his victims. While in confinement in his coffin, Legato developed his power further to restore his broken body to functional form. In the final stage of Knives's plan, Legato faces off against Vash in order to prevent Vash from getting to Knives, revealing that the now completed Coin Case functions as a device that blocks Legato's abilities to make their battle more interesting. As Legato and Vash do battle, Legato reveals his past as a sex slave, and how he came to love and swear loyalty to Knives for destroying the city he was trapped in. Legato beats Vash so severely that it activates an automatic defense power in Vash, which severely wounds Legato. Vash destroys the coin case in an attempt to even the battle once again, and the two clash one final time, both of them pushed to the absolute limits of their strength. Once defeated by Vash, Legato demands that Vash finish him, threatening the life of Livio and everyone else Vash holds dear. Feeling he has no choice, Vash shoots Legato in the head. Legato dies smiling. ===Anime=== The anime shows Legato in a less sympathetic light. In the anime, Legato is far less emotional than his manga counterpart and it is never explained why he joined Knives. Legato is simply a sadistic nihilist who is determined to torment Vash and aid Knives in his quest to eradicate humanity. He also attached Vash's arm to himself because Vash \\"refused to be by his (Knives) side\\". Legato has a similar introduction to the one he is given in the manga, the key difference being that in the anime Legato does not play the game with coins with Vash. Legato uses The Gung-Ho Guns to place Vash in situations where he must either kill or be killed. Vash never ends up killing though, always figuring out a way to survive without finishing anyone off. Vash still gets scarred by Legato's actions, as most of The Gung-ho Guns either get killed for failing to put an end to Vash or commit suicide because they were afraid of being punished by Knives. When Vash finally has Legato cornered, Legato reveals that he is going to allow Vash to kill him. Vash refuses. Legato insists that it is okay and that he has no reason to continue living. Seeing that his words are not working on Vash, he threatens to kill Milly and Meryl if Vash doesn't finish him off. Feeling like he has no other option, Vash shoots Legato in the head. Legato dies smiling, knowing that his death will scar Vash for life. ==Powers and abilities== In both the manga and the anime, Legato has the ability to use psychic powers to manipulate people. He obtained these powers from Knives who gave Legato Vash's left arm, which was endowed with some of the god-like powers the brothers possess. When he does this, it is usually to make a person or a group of people do something against their will. Examples of this include when he made a group of men from the Roderick Gang kill one another, making an entire population of a town disappear, controlling Chapel the Evergreen to kill Nicholas D. Wolfwood, and cramming a group of soldiers into a tight truck by manipulating their bodies. In the manga, Legato is also said to have the power to control threads, which are invisible barriers that can control things as well. The biggest example of when he used this was with his first encounter with Knives as a child. He used this power to survive Knives' attack and impressed the killer to allow him to be his right-hand man. ==Reception== Legato has been listed in Top Ten Emo Anime Characters by My Little Emo, together with Sasuke Uchiha from Naruto and L from Death Note. Listed in #5, he even has surpassed other anime villains like Light Yagami and Zero Kiryu. Twisted Jenius describes him as \\"An Example of a Classic Anime Villain\\", saying that > Aesthetically speaking, Legato dresses the part of a proper anime villain, > and has the evil smile to go along with it. In some ways, I would argue that > Legato is more evil than Knives. Knives, after all, is not human; Legato is > (mostly). It's a little bit understandable that Knives would wish to destroy > the human race; but Legato has chosen to write off his own kind as being > worthless and inferior. He also seems to be more genuinely sadistic than > Knives. He takes a great deal of pleasure in using his power to dispatch > other humans. Legato's purpose in life is to help his master wipe out all of > humanity and to cause eternal suffering for Vash; even at the cost of his > own life. This guy actually manages to psychologically torture the hero of > the series from beyond the grave! ==References== Category:Anime and manga telepaths Category:Anime and manga characters who can move at superhuman speeds Category:Fictional cannibals Category:Fictional mass murderers Category:Fictional orphans Category:Fictional sexual assault victims Category:Fictional slaves Category:Male characters in anime and manga Category:Orphan characters in anime and manga Category:Trigun characters Category:Comics characters introduced in 1996 ","title":"Legato Bluesummers"},{"id":"1998690","text":"Capitol police in the United States are agencies charged with the provision of security police services for various state agencies, but especially State Legislatures.

Since August 4, 2020, the commissioner has been Dave A. Chokshi. ==History== The department was initially set up as the Health Committee (later Commission), a quasi-governmental public health group in response to a yellow fever outbreak in Philadelphia in 1793. Governor John Jay made a proclamation on 13 September 1793 to establish this to regulate the ports of the city and ensure proper quarantines. Three days later, the city, under the leadership of Mayor Richard Varick, created a tandem committee that ensured both private and commercial needs would be addressed. New York would see additional epidemics in 1795, 1796, 1798, 1799, and 1800, which lead to the creation of the 'New York City Board of Health', which held its first meeting in 1805. In 1866, the New York State legislature enacted a bill establishing the 'Metropolitan Board of Health', consisting of the four Police Commissioners, four Health Commissioners appointed by the Governor, and the Health Officer for the Port of New York.Chapter 74 of the Laws of 1866, volume 1, pages 114–144, enacted 26 February 1866, at § 5.

The activists allege that Commissioner Bassett is turning a blind eye to the health code violations because the ultra-Orthodox Jews who practice the ritual represent a powerful voting bloc. During Kaporos, an estimated 60,000 six-week old chickens are intensively confined in crates without food or water for up to several days before being ritually slaughtered. Activists claim that many die of starvation, thirst and exposure before the ritual takes place, but there is no evidence of this. While activists claim the birds are discarded after slaughter, they are typically used for food and often donated to the poor. nytimes.com 7 October 2016. A toxicology reported submitted to the court as part of an ongoing lawsuit against the DOH states that the ritual poses a risk to public health in the neighborhoods where it takes place. While Commissioner Bassett did not publicly acknowledge the toxicology report or the activists’ claims about the health code violations, she issued a public statement asserting that “there remains no evidence that the use of chickens for Kaporos poses a significant risk to human health.” On February 14, 2020 during an interview with MSNBC regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, Dr. Oxiris Barbot stated \\"The coronavirus is part of a family of known viruses.

Bryant was born in Gatesville, Texas, the son of a Baptist pastor. He attended New Mexico State University, where he was a two-time All-American as a member of the golf team. Bryant turned professional in 1986. Bryant did not win on the PGA Tour until his 187th start, the 2004 Valero Texas Open. His entire career has been plagued by injuries and he graduated from PGA Tour Q School six times before his win. At 41 he was the oldest first time winner on the tour in nine years. In 2005 he won the Memorial Tournament and the season ending Tour Championship to finish ninth on the money list with earnings of $3,249,136, which was more than he had earned in total in his first eighteen seasons on the PGA and Nationwide tours from 1986 to 2003, during which his best money list finish on the main tour was 80th. His good run of form also propelled him into the top-50 of the Official World Golf Ranking. The win at Memorial was particularly memorable. Bryant's tee shot on the 72nd hole found a hazard. He was able to get it up and down for par and secure his one-shot victory over Fred Couples. Bryant's elder brother Brad has won on both the PGA Tour and the Champions Tour. Bart played at the 2012 FedEx St. Jude Classic, his first PGA Tour event since July 2009. Bryant won his first Champions Tour event at the 2013 Dick's Sporting Goods Open, making him the 1,000th winner in Champions Tour history. Bryant was married to the former Cathy Cox for 34 years until she died of brain cancer in April 2017.Strength in numbers ==Professional wins (8)PGA Tour wins (3)=== {| class=\\"wikitable\\" style=\\"font-size:95%;\\" |- style=\\"background:#eee;\\" |Legend |- style=\\"background:thistle;\\" | Tour Championships (1) |- |Other PGA Tour (2) |} {| class=\\"wikitable\\" style=\\"font- size:95%;\\" !No. !Date !Tournament !Winning score !Margin of victory !Runner-up |- |align=center|1 |align=right|Sep 19, 2004 |Valero Texas Open |–19 (67-67-60-67=261) |3 strokes | Patrick Sheehan |- |align=center|2 |align=right|Jun 5, 2005 |Memorial Tournament |–16 (69-69-66-68=272) |1 stroke | Fred Couples |- style=\\"background:thistle;\\" |align=center|3 |align=right|Nov 6, 2005 |The Tour Championship |–17 (62-68-66-67=263) |6 strokes | Tiger Woods |} ===Other wins (2)=== *1988 Florida Open *1994 Florida Open ===PGA Tour Champions wins (2)=== {| class=\\"wikitable\\" style=\\"font-size:95%;\\" !No. !Date !Tournament !Winning score !Margin of victory !Runner(s)-up |- |align=center|1 |align=right|Aug 18, 2013 |Dick's Sporting Goods Open |–16 (66-62-72=200) |1 stroke | Russ Cochran, Corey Pavin |- |align=center|2 |align=right|Aug 19, 2018 |Dick's Sporting Goods Open (2) |–16 (68-67-65=200) |1 stroke | Michael Bradley |} PGA Tour Champions playoff record (0–2) {| class=\\"wikitable\\" style=\\"font-size:95%;\\" !No.!!Year!!Tournament!!Opponent!!Result |-style=\\"background:#F08080;\\" |align=center|1 |2015 |ACE Group Classic | Lee Janzen |Lost to par on first extra hole |-style=\\"background:#F08080;\\" |align=center|2 |2016 |Toshiba Classic | Jay Haas |Lost to birdie on first extra hole |} ===Senior wins (1)=== *2013 Liberty Mutual Insurance Legends of Golf - Raphael Division (with Ian Baker-Finch) ==Results in major championships== {| cellpadding=\\"3\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" border=\\"1\\" style=\\"font-size: 95%;

Hans-Jürgen Syberberg (born 8 December 1935) is a German film director, whose best known film is his lengthy feature Hitler: A Film from Germany. == Early life == Born in Nossendorf, Pomerania, the son of an estate owner, Syberberg lived until 1945 in Rostock and Berlin. In 1952 and 1953 he created his first 8 mm takes of rehearsals by the Berliner Ensemble. In 1953 he moved to West Germany, where he in 1956 began studies in literature and art history, completing them the following year. He earned his doctorate in Munich with his thesis on \\"The Absurd in Dürrenmatt.\\" In 1963 Syberberg began producing documentary films about Fritz Kortner and Romy Schneider for Bavarian Radio and others. == Cinema == For Syberberg, cinema is a form of Gesamtkunstwerk. Many commentators, including Syberberg himself, have characterized his work as a cinematic combination of Bertolt Brecht's doctrine of epic theatre and Richard Wagner's operatic aesthetics. Well known philosophers and intellectuals have written about his work, including Susan Sontag,Susan Sontag, \\"Syberberg's Hitler\\" Gilles Deleuze and Philippe Lacoue- Labarthe. In 1975 Syberberg released Winifried Wagner und die Geschichte des Hauses Wahnfried von 1914-1975 (English title: The Confessions of Winifred Wagner), a documentary about Winifred Wagner, an Englishwoman who had married Richard Wagner's son Siegfried. The documentary attracted attention because it exposed Mrs Wagner's unrepentant admiration for Adolf Hitler. The film thus proved an embarrassment to the Wagner family and the Bayreuth Festival (which she had run from 1930 until the end of the Second World War). Winifred Wagner objected to the inclusion in the film of conversations she did not know were being recorded. Syberberg is also noted for an acclaimed visual interpretation of the Wagner opera Parsifal in 1982. == Controversy == Syberberg's work has attracted criticism at least since the publication of the film script of Hitler: A Film from Germany, particularly from the Left, who were amongst many targets of his criticism in that book. In later essays, although he never presented himself as a conservative or sympathizer with German nationalism, his comments began to scandalize a broad spectrum of writers and critics in Germany and elsewhere. In one notorious example Syberberg wrote in Vom Unglück und Glück der Kunst in Deutschland nach dem letzten Kriege (On the Misfortune and Fortune of Art in Germany after the Last War, 1990): > \\"Whoever joined the Jews and the leftists was successful, and it did not > necessarily have anything to do with love, or understanding, or even > inclination. How could Jews tolerate that, being that these others only > wanted power.\\"Syberberg, \\"Vom Ungluck und Gluck\\", p. 14. Ian Buruma, in the New York Review of Books, quotes several of Syberberg's controversial statements. Syberberg described modern German art as \\"filthy and sick... in praise of cowardice and treason, of criminals, whores, of hate, ugliness, of lies and crimes and all that is unnatural.\\" He also wrote that: > \\"The Jewish interpretation of the world followed upon the Christian, just as > the Christian one followed Roman and Greek culture. So now Jewish analyses, > images, definitions of art, science, sociology, literature, politics, the > information media, dominate. Marx and Freud are the pillars that mark the > road from East to West. Neither are imaginable without Jewishness. Their > systems are defined by it. The axis USA-Israel guarantees the parameters. > That is the way people think now, the way they feel, act and disseminate > information. We live in the Jewish epoch of European cultural history. And > we can only wait, at the pinnacle of our technological power, for our last > judgment at the edge of the apocalypse…. So that's the way it looks, for all > of us, suffocating in unprecedented technological prosperity, without > spirit, without meaning... Those who want to have good careers go along with > Jews and leftists [and] the race of superior men [Rasse der Herrenmenschen] > has been seduced, the land of poets and thinkers has become the fat booty of > corruption, of business, of lazy comfort.\\" Buruma writes: > \\"It is not for his aesthetics, however, that Syberberg has been attacked, > but for his politics. The strongest criticism of his book was published in > Der Spiegel, the liberal weekly magazine. Syberberg's views, wrote the > critic, were precisely those that led to the book burning in 1933, and > prepared the way for the Final Solution of 1942. In fact, he went on, they > are worse, for \\"now we know that they are caked with blood…. They are not > just abstruse nonsense, they are criminal.\\" The Spiegel critic compared > Syberberg to the young Hitler, the failed art student in Vienna, who > rationalized his failure by blaming it on a conspiracy of left-wing Jews. > Syberberg feels he is an unappreciated genius, and he too blames it on the > same forces. > \\"Frank Schirrmacher, the young literary editor of the Frankfurter Allgemeine > Zeitung, and the scourge of woolly thinkers of all political persuasions, is > equally opposed to Syberberg and draws similar parallels with the Twenties > and Thirties. And like the critic in Der Spiegel, he singles out for special > censure an interview with Die Zeit in which Syberberg claimed that he 'could > understand' the feeling of the SS man on the railway ramp of Auschwitz, who, > in Himmler's words, 'made himself hard' for the sake of fulfilling his > mission to the end. He did not admire this feeling, but he could understand > it. Just as he could understand its opposite, the rejection of principles to > act humanely.\\"Ian Buruma, \\"There's No Place Like Heimat,\\" New York Review of > Books, Vol. 37, no. 20 (Dec. 20, 1990). ==Personal life== Syberberg currently resides mainly on his family estate in Nossendorf which he has bought back and restored, but has a secondary residence in Munich. ==Awards== *1979 Bavarian Film Award, Best Production Design ==Filmography== *1965 - Fünfter Akt, Siebte Szene.

R. Arulpragasam) was a Tamil activist and former revolutionary from Jaffna who had a part in forming the group Eelam Revolutionary Organisation of Students (EROS) in January 1975 in Wandsworth, England during the Tamil independence movements to secure an independent Tamil Eelam.http://search.intelius.com/Arul-PragasamRichard Harrington (16 September 2005). M.I.A., No Loss For Words The Washington Post. Retrieved 21 October 2008. He later left the conflict, after work as an independent peace negotiator between the two sides of the civil war. At the time of his death, he headed the Global Sustainability Initiative in the United Kingdom. He was also the father of the musician M.I.A. and the jewellery designer Kali Arulpragasam. ==LifeEducation=== Arulpragasam graduated from the Peoples' Friendship University of Russia in Moscow with a degree in Engineering. ===Politics=== Having created EROS in 1975 in Wandsworth, England the group staged demonstrations at the inaugural Cricket World Cup that year, prompting clashes between Tamil and Sinhalese cricket supporters, and bringing the conflict in Sri Lanka to international attention for the first time. In March 1976, he moved to Vavuniya and was one of three EROS members selected to train for six months in Lebanon with Palestinian militants associated with the Fatah wing of the PLO. He left after three months of training, returning to Jaffna, Northern Sri Lanka with his family. Arulpragasam moved back to Vavuniya in late 1976 and from 1978 – 1986, he lived and worked in Tamil Nadu where India, through its intelligence agency supported and trained EROS, one of six Tamil revolutionary groups against the Sri Lankan state. He made sporadic visits to Jaffna where his family lived, introducing himself to his children as their uncle. Although never himself a member of the LTTE, Arulpragasam was an old friend of the group's military leader Vellupillai Prabhakaran during the early years of the Tamil rebellion. His wife and three children left Jaffna in the late 80s and were granted political asylum in the United Kingdom, while he remained behind. Arul Pragasam left his group EROS and the conflict in 1987, becoming an independent peace mediator between the two sides of the civil war, and he was instrumental in bringing in more direct Indian intervention to the conflict in 1987, ultimately ending in failure. M.I.A. has stated in interviews her father shared revolutionary ideals, and that he was a politician, although she had no contact with him since the early 1990s. Rarely speaking about her father publicly, in an interview with The Guardian in 2005, M.I.A. stated \\"He never had a practical, physical influence\\" in her family's life. On his involvement in the war and some writers referring to him as a former Tiger rebel, she has said \\"People write it because it's easy. The Tigers were big in numbers but my dad was too selective. The Tigers had machetes and said, 'They killed my mum so I'm going to fucking fight them.' And my dad was like, 'No no no no, read this amazing book about revolution. Let's sit down and draw up a manifesto.\\" ===Later years=== In 1997, he set up an Institute of Sustainability Development at Trincomalee on the Eastern Province's coast. The same year, he wrote a seminal book on Tamil history, and was based in the island's north east and Tamil Nadu until the mid-2000s. He contacted his daughter following the release of her debut album, named Arular after him, in 2005, telling her to change its name, however she refused. His house was flooded after the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami. Arulpragasam moved to Britain and, at the time of his death, headed the Britain-based Global Sustainability Initiative, which has overseen inventions such as a redesigned bullock cart, a motorised wheelbarrow and a car that consumes less petrol. Arulpragasam explained \\"GSI's mission is to develop a program with a global perspective.\\" Pragasam died on December 3, 2019, aged 71.https://www.instagram.com/p/B5mtUQSFEj6/ ===Family=== Arul Pragasam was the father of jewellery designer Kali Arulpragasam, musician/filmmaker/visual artist Mathangi \\"Maya\\" Arulpragasam (better known by her stage name, M.I.A.), and Sugu Arulpragasam. His family moved back to Sri Lanka when Maya was six months old. M.I.A. named her 2005 debut album Arular after her father, partly for him to get in contact with her. \\"Arular\\" was his nom de guerre during the civil war. M.I.A. said of her upbringing: \\"I only had my mum. I never grew up with my dad so I don’t know what he’s like. I think I’m a mixture of both. My mum’s really passive, quiet and she’s not feisty. She cared about bringing in food and getting us to school and stuff but that’s as far as it went. Growing up without a dad, I was going to school and turning up at parents' meetings on my own. At the time everyone was like, \\"Oh if you had a dad he’d pay for your school and you’d have a better future\\". At the time, my mom was bringing us up and she was like, \\"The only thing your father gave you was a name\\". So that's why I used [his name \\"Arular\\"] on my album to turn it into a statement that my mom always made.

Following the end of the armed conflict in 2009, M.I.A. condemned the Government of Sri Lanka for engaging in systematic genocide against Tamils. In a 2010 feature for The Fader, she stated of the US and Sri Lankan government's behaviour towards her following her rise in prominence: \\"He negotiated peace processes, brought in the new army, and when he goes to Sri Lanka, it’s the government who gives him security against the Tigers\\", she explains. \\"They used it the other way and told the world my dad’s a Tiger which got me to this point. It’s like, 'Wow I didn’t know this guy, and this guy has been working for you for 20 fucking years, and when you feel like it you want to use my own dad against me to discredit what I do.'\\" ==ReferencesFurther reading== Arulpragasam, Maya (2002).

She was the only daughter of Hilton Hotel founder Conrad Hilton with his second wife, actress and socialite Zsa Zsa Gabor. ==Early life and family== Francesca Hilton was born in 1947 in New York City, after her parents were granted a divorce in September, 1946.Kurtis Lee, Francesca Hilton, daughter of Zsa Zsa Gabor and Conrad Hilton, dies at 67, The Los Angeles Times, January 6, 2015.Mike Barnes, Francesca Hilton, Daughter of Zsa Zsa Gabor, Dies at 67, The Hollywood Reporter, January 6, 2015 Her father, Conrad Nicholson Hilton, was the founder of the Hilton Hotel chain.Danielle and Andy Mayoras, The Tragedy of Francesca Hilton, Daughter of Zsa Zsa Gabor and Hilton Founder, Forbes, January 13, 2015.Ann Oldenburg, \\"Francesa Hilton, Zsa Zsa Gabor's daughter, dies\\", USA Today, January 6, 2015. Her mother, Zsa Zsa Gabor, was a Hungarian actress and socialite. Gabor's 1991 autobiography One Lifetime Is Not Enough, alleged that her pregnancy was a result of rape by then-husband Conrad Hilton.https://www.forbes.com/sites/trialandheirs/2015/01/13/the-tragedy-of- francesca-hilton-daughter-of-zsa-zsa-gabor-and-hilton-founder/#3fe252b618b8 She was the only child of Zsa Zsa Gabor and therefore the only descendant of the Gabor sisters as well as the only daughter of Conrad Hilton. Her three half-brothers were Conrad Nicholson Hilton Jr. (1926–1969); William Barron Hilton (1927–2019); and Eric Michael Hilton (1933–2016). She attended movie premieres with her mother and competed in equestrian competitions as a child. In 1947, while Hilton was an infant, a burglar entered their home and tied up Zsa Zsa Gabor and their housekeeper, and threatened to kill Francesca. The burglar stole jewelry worth over $750,000. She worked in reservations at the Beverly Hilton Hotel in Beverly Hills, California during summers as a teenager. When her father died in 1979, he left most of his wealth to the Conrad N. Hilton Foundation. She contested the will, which left her only $100,000, but lost the suit. In October 1993, she married Joseph Piche. The couple divorced in 2010 and had no children. At the time of her death, she was engaged to Michael Natsis. She resided in Los Angeles most of her life. On June 1, 2005, her stepfather, Frédéric Prinz von Anhalt, filed suit against her in a California court and accused her of fraud. The court threw out the case for lack of evidence. Hilton denied the allegations. Hilton lived in West Hollywood apartments for the last nine years of her life. After her mother Zsa Zsa Gabor became incapacitated (including loss of voice, hearing, and eyesight, as well as total dementia) and left to the care of her stepfather, Francesca was totally cut off financially by him. ==Career== She appeared in A Safe Place in 1971 and The Gravy Train in 1974. She worked as a photographer in the 1980s. She also worked for the Conrad N. Hilton Foundation. In 2008, she started performing as a comedian on a regular basis at The Comedy Store in West Hollywood. Her show centered on her family.Francesca Hilton, The Times, January 22, 2015. She joked that her great-nieces, Paris Hilton and Nicky Hilton, were \\"pole dancers and porn stars.\\" According to her publicist, Edward Lozzi, she was writing an autobiography shortly before she died in 2015. ==Death== At the time of her death, Hilton had been homeless and living out of her car for some time. Francesca Hilton died at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles on January 5, 2015, after suffering a major stroke. She was just over two months short of her 68th birthday. Her stepfather's fight to take possession of her body was rejected by the Los Angeles coroner, and so her body remained in a morgue until her half-brother Barron Hilton was given her body. Her family and Francesca's close friends arranged her funeral. Her then close-to-98-years-old mother, Zsa Zsa Gabor, suffering from dementia, was unaware of her daughter's death and was never informed before her own death in December 2016. Francesca Hilton's funeral was held at St Ambrose Catholic Church, West Hollywood.Francesca Hilton burial, radaronline.com; accessed May 27, 2015. She was cremated.

It served as basis for the design of the KC-135 tanker and the 707 airliner. The Dash 80 first flew in 1954, less than two years from project launch. Its US$16 million cost (equivalent to $ million today) was an enormous risk for Boeing, which at the time had no committed customers. Only one example was built, which has been preserved and is currently on public display at the Udvar-Hazy Center in Virginia. ==Design and development== By the late 1940s two developments encouraged Boeing to begin considering building a passenger jet. The first was the maiden flight in 1947 of the B-47 Stratojet. The second was the maiden flight in 1949 of the world's first jet airliner, the de Havilland Comet. Boeing President Bill Allen led a company delegation to the UK in summer 1950, where they saw the Comet fly at the Farnborough Airshow, and also visited the de Havilland factory at Hatfield, Hertfordshire where the Comets were being built. Boeing felt it had mastered the swept wing and podded engines which it saw as key technologies that would enable it to improve on the Comet. The Boeing 367-80 during its roll-out in May 1954 In 1950 Boeing tentatively produced a specification for a jet airliner dubbed the Model 473-60C.Irving 1994, p. 166. The airlines were unconvinced\\"Boeing 367-80.\\" National Air and Space Museum, Smithsonian Institution, 2004. Retrieved: February 22, 2007. because they had no experience with jet transports and were enjoying success with piston engined aircraft such as the Douglas DC-4, DC-6, Boeing Stratocruiser and Lockheed Constellation. Boeing was experienced at selling to the military but had not enjoyed the same success with civil airliners. This market was dominated by Douglas which was adept at meeting the needs of airlines by refining and developing its range of propeller-driven aircraft, and in 1950 was marketing the forthcoming DC-7. Boeing decided the only way to overcome the airlines' suspicion of the jet – and of itself – was to show them a completed aircraft.Irving 1994, pp. 167–169. The Boeing at Boeing Field in Washington (2000) As the first of a new generation of passenger jets, Boeing wanted the aircraft's model number to emphasize the difference from its previous propeller-driven aircraft which bore 300-series numbers. The 400-, 500- and 600-series were already used by missiles and other products, so Boeing decided that the jets would bear 700-series numbers, and the first would be the 707.Irving 1994, p. 171. Boeing had studied developments of its existing Model 367 (the KC-97 Stratofreighter) incorporating swept wings and podded engines; and chose to build the , which retained little of the KC-97 except the upper fuselage diameter (and the possibility of building some of the fuselage with existing tooling). Although the design was announced publicly as the Model 707, the prototype was referred to within Boeing simply as the Dash 80 or \\"-80\\". The Dash 80 fuselage was wide enough at for five-abreast seating; two on one side of the aisle and three on the other. The fuselage diameter for the production KC-135 was widened to and Boeing originally hoped to build the 707 fuselage with that width. By the time the Boeing company committed to production, the decision had been made to design the production model 707 as a six-abreast design, with a larger fuselage, after C. R. Smith, CEO of American Airlines, told Boeing he wouldn't buy the 707 unless it was an inch wider than the then-proposed Douglas DC-8 passenger jet. This decision did not unduly delay the introduction of the production model since the -80 had been largely hand-built, using little production tooling.\\"707 Family.\\" Boeing. Retrieved: April 3, 2010. ==Operational history== By early 1952 the designs were complete and in April the Boeing board approved the program. Construction of the Dash 80 started in November in a walled-off section of Boeing's Renton plant.Thompson, R.G. \\"Dash 80 The story of the prototype 707.\\" Air & Space Magazine, May 1, 1987. Retrieved: April 3, 2010. As a proof of concept prototype there was no certification and no production line and most of the parts were custom built. The aircraft was not fitted with an airline cabin; a plywood lining housed the instrumentation for the flight test program. Boeing 367-80 (N70700) prototype in a NASA archive photo The Dash 80 rolled out of the factory on May 15, 1954, two years after the project was approved and 18 months after construction had started.Irving 1994, p. 173. During a series of taxi trials the port landing gear collapsed on May 22; the damage was quickly repaired and the first flight was on July 15, 1954. Following flights revealed a propensity to \\"Dutch roll\\" - an alternating yawing and rolling motion. Boeing already had experience with this on the B-47 Stratojet and B-52 Stratofortress and had developed a yaw damper system on the B-47 that could be adapted to the Dash 80. Other problems were found with the engines and brakes, the latter once failing completely on landing causing the aircraft to overshoot the runway.Irving 1994, p. 179. Boeing used the Dash 80 on demonstration flights for airline executives and other industry figures. These focused attention on the question of what the cabin of a passenger jet should look like. In a departure from its usual practice Boeing hired industrial design firm Walter Dorwin Teague to create a cabin as radical as the aircraft itself. Prior to demonstration for passenger airlines, the Dash 80 was fitted with Boeing's Flying Boom for aerial refueling which served as a prototype for the KC-135 Stratotanker and its later derivatives. ===The barrel roll=== As part of the Dash 80's demonstration program, Bill Allen invited representatives of the Aircraft Industries Association (AIA) and International Air Transport Association (IATA) to the Seattle's 1955 Seafair and Gold Cup Hydroplane Races held on Lake Washington on August 6, 1955. The Dash 80 was scheduled to perform a simple flyover, but Boeing test pilot Alvin \\"Tex\\" Johnston instead performed two barrel rolls to show off the jet airliner.\\"Video interview with Tex Johnston about barrel roll.\\" aviationexplorer.com.

Retrieved: April 4, 2009. ===Use as an experimental aircraft=== After the arrival of the first production 707 in 1957 the Dash 80 was adapted into a general experimental aircraft and used by Boeing to test a variety of new technologies and systems. One of its most important tasks during the late 1950s was to test systems for the new Boeing 727, including the fitting of a fifth engine in the rear fuselage. Other tests included experiments with different airfoil shapes and a number of high lift devices such as blown flaps, in which compressed air bled from the engines is directed over the flaps to increase lift during takeoff and landing.

It was founded by Harry J. Batt Sr. (grandfather of American actor Bryan Batt) and later managed and owned by his sons, Harry J. Batt Jr. and John A. Batt. It opened on Saturday, June 30, 1928, across Bayou St. John from an existing amusement resort at Old Spanish Fort. Pontchartrain Beach's original location is the present-day lakefront neighborhood of Lake Terrace. In the early 1930s, subsequent to the construction of a seawall extending from West End to the Industrial Canal which created a new shoreline for Lake Pontchartrain, Pontchartrain Beach was moved to a new location at the lake end of Elysian Fields Avenue, a location formerly offshore of Milneburg. Pontchartrain Beach included a beach with a large art deco style bathhouse and swimming pools, amusement rides (including a wooden roller coaster called the Zephyr), and concession stands. The park featured live music concerts, including many local musicians and touring national acts such as Elvis Presley. Other rides and amusements included the Zephyr Junior, Smoky Mary, the Wild Maus, Musik Express, Log Ride, the Ragin' Cajun (a modern, looping steel coaster), the Bug, Paratrooper, Scrambler, Calypso, the \\"airplanes\\", Haunted House, Ghost Train, bumper cars, carousel, Ferris wheel, the Monster, Trabant, Sky Ride, Hard Rock, Galaxy, Laff in the Dark, Magic Rainbow, Red Baron, and Kiddieland. As with other amusement or theme parks, over time certain older rides were changed out for new ones. In addition to rides, there were also the summertime shows which changed every few years (Skipper & Dolly dolphin show, Great American High Dive Show, Merlin's Magic Rainbow Show). For a few years there was also a fairly large petting zoo with many farm animals and a huge red barn house. A miniature golf course was added, when this pastime became popular. Just outside the entrance gates was the Bali Hai Tiki-style restaurant. Another popular restaurant was the Ship Ahoy, which featured hamburgers and seafood. Pontchartrain Beach was sold on September 23, 1983. The main reason it closed down was due to declining attendance. In 1943, Corporal Douglas O'Brien, a World War II serviceman from Springfield, Massachusetts, fell to his death from the top of the Zephyr roller coaster. He was 28 years old. ==Pontchartrain Beach today== Several of the rides - including the Airplanes and many Kiddieland rides - ended up in Gulf Shores, Alabama, at a small amusement park, which was subsequently wiped out by Hurricane Ivan in 2004. The Ragin' Cajun moved to the Great Escape & Splashwater Kingdom in 1984 and opened as Steamin' Demon. One of the four antique carousels is located on the boardwalk in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. Also, the crest of the Zephyr currently resides at Kenner Memorial Park, among with remnants of Bali Hai restaurant. The hand-painted carousel horses were donated by Harry J. Batt Jr. and John A. Batt to New Orleans' City Park. The Park did not acknowledge the gifts or recognize the Batts for their donation. The land formerly housing the park is now occupied by the University of New Orleans Research & Technology Park, home to the Navy's Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center (SPAWAR) and the UNO Advanced Technology Center office building. A mile-long sand beach is still at the same area where Pontchartrain Beach once was. It is inaccessible and off limits to the general public, having been deemed hazardous due to underwater drop offs and riprap which pose dangers for swimmers. Water quality had increased dramatically in recent decades and the sand beach was reopened at one point, until a pair of drownings occurred and the beach was re-closed. The Lake Pontchartrain Basin Foundation has undertaken the task of restoring Pontchartrain Beach for use as a public recreation area. While no opening date has been given officially, a phased approach was expected to begin in the summer of 2016. ==See also== *Lincoln Beach amusement park ==ReferencesExternal links== * The Times-Picayune in 175 years -- 1983: The ride is over at Pontchartrain Beach (2011) * More Pontchartrain Beach photos and information * Category:Amusement parks in New Orleans Category:Defunct amusement parks in the United States Category:History of New Orleans Category:1928 establishments in Louisiana Category:1983 disestablishments in Louisiana Category:Amusement parks opened in 1928 Category:Amusement parks closed in 1983 ","title":"Pontchartrain Beach"},{"id":"1998891","text":"1903 4d Express mail cover from Kendall-Bedford with red official Royal Mail express label affixed.

These EMS award winners are recorded in the EMS Cooperative's Hall of Fame. ==EMS Cooperative members== EMS SpeedPost from India Since its creation, 182 postal administrations have joined the EMS Cooperative, representing over 85% of EMS operators worldwide. ==Other providers== Many transportation logistics firms offer similar accelerated services. DHL Express (\\"DHL\\"), Federal Express (\\"FedEx\\"), and United Parcel Service (\\"UPS\\") are the most popular alternatives. However, in many countries such alternative carriers' shipments have different status for several legal purposes. For example, in Russia, shipments from abroad to individuals for private needs are exempt from customs duties if valued less than €1000 and sent via post or EMS, while when sent by other means the exemption applies to values below €250 only. In some countries legal notification sent by post and EMS are deemed made on the date of dispatch, while for other couriers on the date of delivery only. ==See also== *Express mail in the United States *Gallows letter *Mail *Pony Express *Postal administration *S10 (UPU standard) *Surface Air Lifted (SAL) ==ReferencesExternal links== * * * (previously called \\"Express Mail\\") * * Category:Postal system Category:Philatelic terminology ","title":"Express mail"},{"id":"1998892","text":"Vindicator (Heather MacNeil Hudson) is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics.

Acquired by Johnson & Johnson in 1998, its companies form part of the Johnson & Johnson Medical Devices group.

DePuy Orthopaedics designs, manufactures, markets and distributes products for reconstructing damaged or diseased joints and for repairing and reconstructing traumatic skeletal injuries. DePuy Spine products facilitate fusion of the spine and correction of spinal deformities, preserving motion of the spine and repairing bone fractures. DePuy is currently the subject of more than 11,000 lawsuits related to its recall of faulty hip replacement systems, which lawyers and industry analysts estimate will cost parent company Johnson & Johnson billions of dollars to resolve. ==History== Founded 1895 in Warsaw, Indiana, by Revra DePuy, DePuy Manufacturing began designing and building fiber splints to replace wooden barrel staves that were used to set fractures. DePuy is now operating from several countries, including the United Kingdom, Japan, France, Germany, Ireland and Australia. In many other countries, DePuy operates as a brand under the Johnson & Johnson Medical organization.Hermann Simon mentioned this company in his correspondent Book as an example of a \\"Hidden Champion\\" (Simon, Hermann: Hidden Champions of the 21st Century : Success Strategies of unknown World Market Leaders. London: Springer, 2009.- .) On April 22, 2008, the DePuy franchise and Johnson & Johnson Medical marked the official opening of Johnson & Johnson Medical (Suzhou), Ltd., establishing production facilities in China for DePuy and the J&J; Family of Companies. At , this facility occupies a fraction of the J&J; campus, which encompasses in total. Manufacturing at JJM began in February 2008. On August 24, 2010, DePuy recalled all ASR hip implant systems sold since 2003. The 2010 DePuy Hip Recall was issued after research released by the National Joint Registry (NJR) found high rates of hip replacement failure for the ASR XL Acetabular and ASR Hip Resurfacing systems. Another study noted the high rate of failure in patients who received ASR XL hip arthroplasty. In August 2013, attorneys for thousands of patients who received the implants sent a letter to the Food and Drug Administration accusing the company of breaking federal law by hiding experts’ misgivings about the device, and called on the agency to investigate. “We believe almost all of these injuries would have been avoided had DePuy complied with the reporting requirements and informed your agency about the adverse events and concerns about the safety of the ASR which came to the company’s attention,” the attorneys said. DePuy faces more than 11,000 plaintiffs nationwide over the ASR XL, which generally allege that the product is prone to degrading prematurely and shedding toxic metal debris, causing pain and necessitating revision surgeries that can be more invasive than the initial total hip replacements. In the first trial related to the product, a California jury awarded $8.3 million in compensatory damages to a retired prison guard, finding the implant's design to be faulty and DePuy to have acted negligently. A judge later upheld the jury verdict on post-trial motions. In the second trial, an Illinois jury returned a verdict in favor of DePuy in a lawsuit brought by a nurse who had sought $5 million in damages. On June 14, 2012, Johnson and Johnson completed the acquisition of Synthes, which was integrated with the DePuy franchise to establish the DePuy Synthes Companies of Johnson & Johnson.

The second Nemesis was introduced as a member of Canada's new government sanctioned team, Gamma Flight, and remained a member until the team was disbanded, at which point she fled to keep her teammate Wild Child from being placed in government custody. After Alpha Flight was reinstated, Wild Child, now a full member of Alpha Flight, rescued her from Rok, the new leader of the Children of the Night. She accompanied him to the Alpha Flight headquarters and became a member of Alpha Flight. ==Amelia WeatherlyFictional character biography=== The third Nemesis to be introduced was born in the early 19th Century under the name Amelia Weatherly. She became the mistress of Centennial. She was killed under unknown circumstances involving a building burning down and was buried in a shallow grave. Although Centennial never found her body, he had a proper funeral for \\"the one thing he ever loved\\". Somehow, after having \\"been to Hell – twice\\" she was revived as \\"the living embodiment of retribution\\", her dead body animated by the connection to her Promethium soulsword, Scell. When the sword is not held by her or sheathed close to her body, she can barely move. Later, she was arrested by the Canadian Government as an anarchist terrorist and held until Sasquatch made a bargain for her release to join his new Alpha Flight lineup to save the originals – initially under coercion, with Sasquatch injecting her with nanotechnology capable of severing her connection to her sword, effectively killing her, if she attempted to kill any Alpha Flight member.Alpha Flight Vol. 3 #1 (2004) While only Nemesis herself was aware of their connection, Centennial was also independently recruited by Sasquatch to the team. After they helped to rescue the original team, Nemesis herself was the member keenest for the new team to remain assembled, since, while long-lived, she was not immortal and her life was coming to an end – although, visibly, she had not aged since her original death – and there was a matter she needed to attend to, which she couldn't do from prison. She eventually convinced Sasquatch to allow her freedom in return for remaining a member. When Flashback then came to ask for help in preventing himself from being drawn back to his death in the past, Nemesis revealed she and her sword could time- travel – however, she didn't mention until after she'd done it that she would need to kill Flashback to do so. She justified it on the grounds that if they prevented the original problem – which Sasquatch identified as Guardian's original death – then she would never have needed to kill Flashback in the first place. She then proceeded to kill the members of Alpha Flight one-by- one, as their attempts to solve the problem made the present increasingly worse and required someone else to go back to alter the past further. When she stabbed them, they went to a \\"weigh station\\" inside herself where they would exit in the past with no memory of the time spent there.Alpha Flight Vol. 3 #8 (2004) When it was Centennial's turn to be stabbed and enter the station, she revealed herself to him at last as the mistress he'd truly loved, but said she couldn't tell him after she exited to reality, and after she sent everyone else (bar Sasquatch) back, she spent time cradling his dead body. When the time finally came to kill herself, she met herself in the final moments of her original life, suffering a \\"slow and painful death\\" in a shallow grave at the foot of a hill, topped with a flaming building, and briefly comforted herself.Alpha Flight Vol. 3 #11 (2004) When she arrived in the past, she killed Heather Hudson to prevent Guardian's death, which meant that the future Sasquatch became one where Guardian had spent ten years becoming the ruler of the world – and torturing Nemesis. Sasquatch, however, managed to persuade Shaman to reset the timeline so that the attempts at altering the past had never happened. The result was that Flashback came, not to prevent his own death, but to give Sasquatch Shaman's pouch, which yielded copies of the original Alpha Flight taken from shortly before Guardian's \\"death,\\" with only Shaman and Nemesis herself remembering the erased timeline, whereupon Shaman convinced Nemesis to reveal herself to Centennial, so that when they died shortly after they were buried together.Alpha Flight Vol. 3 #12 (2004) When stunned, she starts talking about \\"fuzzy bunnies\\". ==ReferencesExternal links== *AlphaFlight.Net Alphanex Entry On – Nemesis Category:Characters created by John Byrne Category:Characters created by Scott Lobdell Category:Comics characters introduced in 1984 Category:Comics characters introduced in 1989 Category:Comics characters introduced in 2004 Category:Female characters in comics Category:Fictional Canadian people Category:Marvel Comics characters who use magic Category:Marvel Comics characters who can teleport Category:Marvel Comics superheroes Category:Marvel Comics female superheroes pt:Nemesis (Marvel Comics) ","title":"Nemesis (Alpha Flight)"},{"id":"1998945","text":"PEI or Pei may refer to: == Places == *Matecaña International Airport, Pereira, Colombia, IATA code PEI *Pei County (沛县), Jiangsu, China *Pei Commandery (沛郡), a commandery in Chinese history *Prince Edward Island, a province of Canada *Pei, Tibet, a town in Tibet == People == *Bei (surname) (貝), romanized Pei in Wade–Giles *Pei (surname), a Chinese surname (裴) or an Italian surname *I.

The group is depicted as a collective of assassins who work for Ra's al Ghul, an enemy of the superhero Batman and the Green Arrow. The group first appeared in Strange Adventures #215 (Dec 1968). The League of Assassins has been adapted into other media several times, predominantly in animated Batman productions, the live-action Batman film series The Dark Knight Trilogy, as well as the CW TV show Arrow, and the Fox TV show Gotham. ==OriginsLeague of Assassins=== yasser split from the ancient Order of the Assassins in a successor movement. Their followers claim to have annulled and deposed centers of civilizations such as Baghdad, Moscow, and Rome, throughout past generations in their lineage. ====Practices==== The recruits of the League of Assassins follow a strict regimen, carrying distinct black emblems and supplies up to their mountain lairs. These new recruits are called Ghuls, because they emerge after proclaiming their final prayers in their own prefabricated graves before initiating in various, assigned operations. ====Operations==== Unlike the ancient Order of the Assassins, whose main objective was to halt sectarian conflicts and wars within the world; the League of Assassins acts as an organization that is a catalyst to the reformation of decadent civilizations around the globe. ==Fictional team historyUnder Ebeneezer Darhk's leadership=== The League of Assassins was founded by Ra's al Ghul (at 1013 A.D.) to be \\"the fang that protects the head\\" (Batgirl #67, 2005). Members of the League demonstrated willingness to die at a word from Ra's. They have included some of the most dangerous assassins in the world including Lady Shiva, David Cain, and Merlyn. For much of its current history, any member who failed in an assassination was in turn targeted by the League. Indeed, one of its best-known members, the master- archer Merlyn, was eventually forced to flee from the League, fearing for his life, having failed to assassinate Batman. In more recent years, this policy has apparently relaxed somewhat. Ebeneezer Darcel, aka Doctor Darhk, was the first known individual assigned to head the League of Assassins by Ra's al Ghul. Darhk himself was seconded by the Sensei, a martial arts master from Hong Kong. Although many of the League's leaders over the years have been accomplished martial artists, Darhk himself did not depend on physical prowess, and as an assassin he instead relied upon careful planning and manipulation, ambushes and death traps, as well as a variety of cleverly concealed weapons and poisons. Although the League apparently had an inner circle of elite fighters as well as a large number of warriors trained in the martial arts, the League during Darhk's tenure as leader reflected his personal methodology. Following a \\"falling out\\" with Ra's (the exact details of which were never made clear) Darhk kidnapped Ra's daughter, Talia al Ghul. Batman became involved in this matter while attempting to bring the League to justice for a number of recent killings. Although he had connected the League to several assassinations over the years, all previous attempts to investigate had met dead-ends. Batman rescued Talia (the first time the two would meet, laying the foundation for all their future interaction) and Darhk died while trying to kill them. ===Under Sensei's leadership=== Under the direction of the organization's second known leader, the villainous Sensei, the League became more brutal, and it rebelled against Ra's' rule. Although the Sensei's methods closely resembled Darhk's, and the majority of the League's operatives showed little to no real skill in personal combat, the Sensei did show slightly more reliance on skilled martial artists. This version of the League is best known for two assassinations. As part of an initiation process, the operative known as the Hook was assigned to murder Boston Brand (who became Deadman after his death). Additionally, Professor Ojo successfully brainwashed Ben Turner (best friend and partner of Richard Dragon), creating an alternate personality dubbed the Bronze Tiger, and turning the master martial artist into a League operative. As the Bronze Tiger, Turner defeated Batman in personal combat while another League operative murdered Kathy Kane (the secret identity of Batwoman in pre-Crisis continuity, and a close personal friend of Batman's post-crisis). Eventually Turner's earlier training at the hands of O-Sensei (not to be confused with the leader of the League) proved too strong for the League to fully break, and when he refused to kill Batman he was forced to flee the League. Not long afterwards, the insane Sensei—no longer motivated by anything but a desire to raise assassination to an art—attempted to cause an artificial earthquake in order to kill a number of diplomats gathered for peace talks. Batman traced Ben Turner to a hospital, foiling a League attempt to assassinate the man. Turner could not fully remember the actions of his alternate personality (although years later, as a member of the Suicide Squad, he would reveal that the League had used him to kill a number of people), but he was able to aid Batman in uncovering the Sensei's latest plot. Although Batman was unable to prevent the earthquake, ultimately it was only the Sensei himself that died in the disaster, and control of the League returned to Ra's. ===Role in the creation of Lady Shiva=== It was more recently revealed that, prior to the betrayals of Doctor Daark and the Sensei, Ra's had grown tired of the fickle loyalties of his warriors. Ra's assigned David Cain to create a perfect bodyguard (\\"The One Who Is All\\"). After early attempts to raise such a person resulted in hopelessly psychotic children, Cain decided that he needed a genetically suited child and began searching for a possible mother. To this end he assassinated Carolyn Woosan/Wu-San, one of two astonishingly talented martial artist sisters he had seen fighting in an exhibition. Carolyn's sister, Sandra, swore revenge and tracked Cain down, only to be subdued by the combined might of the League. Both intoxicated and frightened by the levels of skill she was attaining now that she was no longer holding back for her sister's sake, Sandra agreed to be the mother of Cain's child. In return, the League spared Sandra's life, and assisted her in further training. By the time Sandra gave birth she had surpassed the entire League in skill. She left immediately following the birth of her daughter, Cassandra Cain, rechristening herself Lady Shiva. Other stories would suggest that at some points afterwards Shiva worked as a member of the League, and eyewitness testimony from former League member Onyx indicates that she kept in contact with the League, although she apparently did not see her daughter. Although most of her appearances over the years show her working independently, she apparently had some degree of League membership, and was called upon by Ra's to \\"rescue\\" Talia during the Hush storyline. In keeping with Ra's and Cain's plans, the League attempted to train Cassandra Cain from birth to be the ultimate assassin, unknowingly giving her the skills she would use as the hero Batgirl. ===Under Nyssa al Ghul's leadership=== After the death of Ra's al Ghul, his first-born daughter Nyssa Raatko formed a new League. Lady Shiva was recruited to serve as the sensei to this incarnation of the League, with the intent that Batgirl (Cassandra Cain) would lead the warriors themselves. Reflecting Shiva's emphasis for martial arts, the known members of Nyssa's League were all skilled in this area, and included the warriors Shrike, Kitty Kumbata, Wam-Wam, Joey N'Bobo, Tigris, Momotado, Krunk, White Willow, the twin warriors Los Gemelos, Ox, Mad Dog, Alpha, and Cristos. The new League was present when Mr. Freeze's wife Nora Fries was brought back to life as the monstrous Lazara, and several members died in the resulting chaos. Due to the conflict between their loyalty to Shiva and Nyssa and their near-worship of Batgirl as \\"The One Who is All\\", the League split at that point, with Ox, White Willow, and Tigris pledging themselves to Cassandra. Several more members of the League (including all the defectors except Tigris) died when the insane \\"Mad Dog\\" went on a killing spree. \\"The Mad Dog\\", it was revealed, had been one of David Cain's early attempts to create Ra's' perfect warrior. The Mad Dog had been considered useless as a child, since Cain's methods had driven him murderously insane, and Ra's had ordered the child be killed. Nyssa, however, knew that the servant ordered to carry out this execution had instead released him into the wild, explaining how it was possible to recruit him. The Mad Dog was successful in killing Batgirl (who gave her life to protect the burqa-clad assassin Tigris). She was quickly restored to life in a Lazarus Pit by Shiva, in order that the two could face each other in a final battle. Batgirl won leaving Shiva on a meat hook suspended over the Lazarus Pit. ===Infinite Crisis=== Although most of its members had died or defected, the League survived the Infinite Crisis, and was seen to play an important role in the Society's worldwide prison break. Throughout the period of aftermath it remained under the control of Nyssa, until she was apparently killed in a car explosion. Cassandra Cain has apparently taken over the League as its new leader, although she abandoned the League at some point prior to the Teen Titans storyline Titans East, where it is revealed that she was being drugged by Deathstroke. Furthermore, it appears that Cassandra was battling for complete control of the League of Assassins with Ra's al Ghul's youngest daughter Talia, as well as the Sensei. Talia, who would naturally assume control of her father's empire by default following Nyssa's death, has recently been seen in the Batman and Son storyline, leading ninja members of the League of Assassins, against Batman. At the same time, several members felt neither Talia nor Cassandra were up to the role, and, after failing to recruit Black Canary's adopted daughter Sin, gave the leadership to the Sensei, who recently reappeared in the \\"Resurrection of Ra's al Ghul\\" storyline. In One Year Later, Talia al Ghul forced Kirk Langstrom to give her the Man-Bat formula which she used to turn some of its members into Man-Bats. Currently, the League of Assassins and its Man-Bat Commandos are used by Talia as her personal army and bodyguards, carrying her orders and taking retribution over her enemies.Batman #655 In the series Green Arrow/Black Canary #11, a metahuman faction of the League of Assassins was introduced. They were involved in the abduction of an injured Connor Hawke. This group's members included Bear, Tolliver, Ruck, Spike, Mazone, and their leader Targa. However, although they thought they were being commanded by Ra's al Ghul, they were apparently duped by an imposter Shado.Green Arrow/Black Canary #11 ===The New 52=== In The New 52 (a 2011 reboot of the DC Comics universe), the League of Assassins reside in the sacred city of 'Eth Alth'eban. Lady Shiva, Rictus, Cheshire, December Graystone, and Bronze Tiger target Red Hood. They end up capturing Jason Todd and bring him to 'Eth Alth'eban so that he can help lead the League of Assassins.Red Hood and the Outlaws #21 Red Hood has been led to 'Eth Alth'eban, where the League of Assassins resides. Bronze Tiger explains that costumed heroes have been fighting to maintain a broken system—a system that can only be fixed by taking the next step, and culling the weak and wicked from the world. He and the others have chosen Jason to be their leader in taking the action that the world's super-heroes have been too afraid to take. Red Hood admits that he abandoned his friends because he didn't want to be a killer. In response, Bronze Tiger begs the opportunity to show Red Hood how to do real lasting good. The assassins give Jason a tour of the Death Market, where tools of death and murder can be bought, to fill any need provided that the need in question is killing a lot of people. After reuniting with December Graystone, Cheshire, Lady Shiva, and Rictus, Bronze Tiger calls a meeting of the council to which Red Hood is invited. Meanwhile, they are concerned about the security of the city, given the coming war. Rictus assures them that it would take approximately four hundred terawatts of power to break through the city's walls. At their meeting, Red Hood wonders what it is about him that makes them think he can lead them to victory against the Untitled. Bronze Tiger admits amid jeers from his companions that he was told by Talia al Ghul that Red Hood would be the only one who could stop the Untitled if they ever attacked. This comes as a surprise to Red Hood, given that he can't even remember what the Untitled look like. Bronze Tiger reminds that if Jason wants to do good with his life, he can't do much better than to fight against the most powerful force for evil on the planet. Just then, sensors reveal that something is on the perimeter of the city. It is Arsenal and he is heavily armed.Red Hood and the Outlaws #22 Arsenal is using all of his unique inventions to hold back the defensive attacks of the Man-Bat Commandos of the League of Assassins. The first assassin Arsenal encounters is December Graystone and he soon entraps the magician within a block of ice, thanks to some grenades made with technology he stole from Mr. Freeze. Next, Cheshire appears next to him thanks to her teleportation abilities and steals the hat off of his head. However, he spots the teleportation device implanted in her wrist and uses an electrical shock to short it out. That causes the device to malfunction and she disappears completely. During the fight, Red Hood states that he would lead the League of Assassins in exchange that Arsenal and Starfire are unharmed. Starfire reminds Jason that she would rather die than be put in chains again. She warns him that with the last Lazarus Pit uncovered, it can strip away the Untitled's powers, which is why they have come to destroy it. They must not succeed. As she and Arsenal are escorted away, she warns Jason not to die today. As he prepares himself, Red Hood begins to hear a voice from within that explains that his destiny is coming to fruition, and shows him how to make the mystical All-Blades manifest in his hands. Though he doesn't remember what all this means, he hopes it will help, as the Untitled arrive in the sacred city.Red Hood and the Outlaws #23 Outside the sacred city of 'Eth Alth'eban, December Graystone discovers someone he was not expecting to see waiting outside and curses himself for not realizing that this person had something to do with the battle currently underway in the subterranean city. Red Hood is currently leading the League of Assassins in a charge against the evil Untitled, who had the gall to use Jason's friend Arsenal against him to get into the city. Jason is confused when his swords tell him that by taking bronze shards from the great fountain at the centre of the city, they will be able to drive off the Untitled, but he hopefully passes on the information to his companions. Red Hood finds himself locked in combat with Drakar and the man discovers that what was done to Red Hood's mind was more than a simple mind-wipe. He senses Ducra somewhere within his mind. Red Hood uses Drakar's confusion to steer him toward the fountain, which hides the Well of Sins (the pool that filled the Untitled with evil). Drakar struggles, but collapses into the murky fluid. Having fallen into the Well of Sins, Drakar begs to be removed from it as he can feel the arcane power reaching back inside him, and taking the evil energy within him away. The pool strips Drakar of his power and life-force, spitting him back out as a withered old man. Turning to the remaining Untitled, Red Hood warns that they will all suffer the same fate if they do not surrender. The Untitled respond that he cannot hope to defeat them alone, but Lady Shiva responds by unleashing a swarm of Man-Bats warning that the League of Assassins is death incarnate. When the Untitled have been cast back into the Well of Sins by the League of Assassins, Drakar plans to take Red Hood with him only for Bronze Tiger to snap Drakar's neck. Following Drakar's death, Red Hood admits that killing Drakar was necessary—a key realization for a member of the League of Assassins. Lady Shiva comments that tonight, they will see all the remaining Untitled dead as well, but Jason responds that they cannot simply kill without his say-so if he is to be the League's leader. Suddenly, a cloaked figure appears, noting that he expected more after coming all this way, just to find a leader of assassins who orders his warriors to sheathe their blades. The man warns that the game is over, and Jason's part in it is done, as he makes his way toward the Well of Sins. Jason stands in his way, demanding to know who this man is. The man responds that he is the one who gave the Untitled the location of the Acres of All knowing that they would kill Ducra and return to this place. He knew they would fall here, and imbue the Well of Sins with a greater power than he had ever tasted—a power that he would now take for himself, having planned this moment for three centuries. Emerging from the pit, the man introduces himself as Ra's al Ghul.Red Hood and the Outlaws #24 Jason is under attack by Ra's al Ghul who demands to know just what his daughter Talia al Ghul saw in the boy. Having just emerged from the Well of Sins, Ra's al Ghul is consumed by the evil that once corrupted the Untitled centuries ago. Now he feels compelled to rid himself of the machinations of his daughter and Ducra by killing Jason. At Ra's al Ghul's command, the prisoners are brought to him, and he promises to use his new found power to see them dead. Red Hood, however, determines that he cannot allow it to happen. As Ra's al Ghul gathers his power, Red Hood tells himself again and again that he wants to remember what he chose to forget. At last, the images rush through his mind, and begin to reform as memories. Unfortunately, the revelation occurs earlier than Ducra had planned. Having regained all of his training with Batman as well, Jason is free of his chains almost instantly. His training with Lady Shiva sees him making short work of the League's Man- Bats. He uses that same training to best Lady Shiva herself, only to be attacked by Bronze Tiger next. In the meantime though, Cheshire (whose loyalty to the League of Assassin's returned master is waning) attempts to rescue Roy and Kori. Before long, the pair are free to aid Red Hood in his fight. Smirking, he welcomes them back, apologizing for his having deceived them. They are confused, unaware that his decision to erase his memory was part of a grander plan.Red Hood and the Outlaws #26 Red Hood engages Ra's al Ghul as Essence joins the battle. She insists that he will allow Jason and his friends to leave his realm, or he will be forced to die a mortal death just as he always feared he would. Despite having destroyed the All-Caste, Ra's' actions have led to their eventual rebirth. Defeated, he swears that he will visit great agony upon Red Hood if he sees him ever again.Red Hood and the Outlaws #27 Talia al Ghul's own organization, Leviathan, is a schism of the League of Assassins created to counter Batman's \\"Batman Incorporated\\".Batman Incorporated Vol. 2 #3 Batman and Aquaman head to an island where the League of Assassins are, after Ra's al Ghul had the bodies of Damian Wayne and Talia al Ghul exhumed. Batman and Aquaman storm the beach, breaking through the island's defences of Man-Bats, only to find that the source of the whales' screaming was on the island. Ra's al Ghul had ordered the hunt of whales, creating genetically altered super-humans in the wombs of sperm whales. This being just one of a probable many plans to rebuild the League of Assassins. Aquaman swears vengeance on the whales' behalves. Inside the compound, they find that Ra's is wiping the hard drives clean, preventing data recovery, even as a message from Ra's plays over the intercom, chastising Batman for failing to prevent the deaths of Damian or Talia within the city he swore to protect. As his parting gift, he has left Batman the Heretics to keep him entertained. Batman reels as he sees all of the grotesque and mutated failed clones of failed Damians. As they fight for their lives, Batman warns Aquaman not to kill any of these monstrosities. They are too developmentally malformed to comprehend what they had done to those whales in being born. Suddenly, Bruce realizes that if the Heretics were born of a whale's womb, Arthur might be able to telepathically link up with them. He leads them out into the ocean, where an unharmed whale breaches, and swallows them whole. Batman, meanwhile, fights his way to Ra's escape aircraft. He sees Talia and Damian's bodies stored within it, and clings to the fuselage from outside as the plane takes off. Though Ra's al Ghul plans to go to Paradise Island, he is nearly surprised to see Batman pounding on the cockpit's windshield. From outside, Batman screams for Ra's al Ghul to give back his son, but Ra's al Ghul responds that he is blood of Damian's blood and the boy is in good hands. He orders the plane to tilt its angle, causing the wind shear to rip Batman from his purchase and drop down into the sea. Luckily, Aquaman is there to catch him. Arthur explains that all of the Heretics are alive, having been taken down to Atlantis for safe keeping, by a whale.Batman and Robin Vol. 2 #29 ===DC Rebirth=== In the DC Rebirth relaunch universe, the League of Assassins and League of Shadows are two separate organizations. The League of Assassins consists of Ra's Al Ghul's standard followers. The League of Shadows is the more mysterious of the two and is often considered a myth, but are said to have people everywhere and to have a plan to \\"bring the entire nation to the ground\\".Detective Comics #937 ==Members== * Ra's al Ghul – First appearing in Batman #232 (June 1971), Ra's al Ghul (\\"Demon's Head\\" in Arabic), is a centuries-old worldwide eco-terrorist. He knows Batman's secret identity. He utilizes special pits known as Lazarus Pits which enable him to evade death, and live for centuries. He is the founder of The League of Assassins, though exactly when is unknown. * Batman – Batman's secret identity is Bruce Wayne, an American billionaire, playboy, philanthropist, and owner of Wayne Enterprises. After witnessing the murder of his parents as a child, he swore revenge on criminals, an oath tempered by a sense of justice. Wayne trains himself both physically and intellectually and crafts a bat-inspired persona to fight crime. * Talia al Ghul – First appearing in Detective Comics #411 (May 1971), she's the daughter of Ra's al Ghul and the half-sister of Nyssa Raatko. Her father encouraged a relationship between Talia and Batman, desiring for Batman to marry his daughter in hopes of recruiting him as his successor. Talia admires Batman in his drive, determination, and nobility, but was always torn between him and the love for her terrorist father. Unlike Catwoman, Talia is more than willing to play second-fiddle to Bruce's mission. He is the father of her son Damian. * Nyssa Raatko – First appearing in Detective Comics #783 (August 2003), she's the daughter of Ra's al Ghul, born in Saint Petersburg in 1775, and a Holocaust survivor. She eventually broke off from her father and his crusade, which resulted in a rift between them. She had in her possession a Lazarus Pit that could be reused over and over again. She was responsible for brainwashing her half-sister Talia into despising not only Batman, but their father as well, whom she ended up killing with a sword. It appears, however, that Nyssa was killed in a car bombing in Northern Africa, presumably by the League of Assassins. * Ebeneezer Darrk (Also known as Doctor or Professor Darrk) – He is the first known individual assigned to head the League of Assassins by Ra's al Ghul. Although many of the League's leaders over the years have been accomplished martial artists, Daark himself did not depend on physical prowess, and as an assassin he instead relied upon careful planning and manipulation, ambushes and death traps, as well as a variety of cleverly concealed weapons and poisons. After earning Ra's enmity (for reasons unknown), Darrk died during a plot to kidnap Talia which was foiled by Batman. * The Sensei – First appearing in Strange Adventures #215 (October/November 1968) as an aged martial arts master from Hong Kong, he was Darrk's second in command. He was put in charge of the League after Darrk's death. However, he would prove just as disloyal as his predecessor, and the Sensei would eventually struggle with Ra's al Ghul for the control of the organization. One of his personal goals is to raise assassination to an art form. He is revealed to be Ra's al Ghul's father in Batman #671 (January 2008). * Doctor Moon – First appearing in Batman #240 (March 1972), he is a brain surgeon with skills that make him the person to contact to recover dead brains, erase or modify minds, or mental torture. * Lady Shiva (Sandra Wu-San) – First appearing in Richard Dragon, Kung Fu Fighter #5 (December 1975), she's a mercenary assassin who once trained with Bruce Wayne and is possibly the greatest martial artist alive in the DC Universe; one of Batman's true physical rivals.

Wilson and Grayson have a long- standing animosity due to years of fighting and Grayson's redemption of Wilson's children. * Maseo Yamashiro - Former handler/A.R.G.U.S. partner of Oliver Queen stationed in Hong Kong, and husband of Tatsu Yamashiro. He was brought in into the League as \\"Sarab\\" or \\"Mirage\\" after the death of his son Akio thanks to an viral outbreak by General Matthew Shrive. Sarab was killed by Tatsu in her identity as Katana. ( _Arrowverse Only_ ) * Sara Lance – She was found by Nyssa al Ghul (Katrina Law) who took her to Nanda Parbat. She and Nyssa became lovers, and Sara became a deadly fighter with the League of Assassins under the name Ta-er al-Sahfer, which means \\"Yellow Bird\\" or \\"Canary\\". ( _Arrowverse Only_ ) * The Seven Men of Death – The seven deadliest assassins of the League and Ra's al Ghul's personal hit squad. They answer only to the Demon himself and the Sensei.

With Ra's al Ghul gone, Batman uses Ra's' criminal empire to set up an anti-crime and humanitarian network by subtly changing the organization's goals. ==In other mediaTelevision=== * In Batman: The Animated Series, the group is named Society of Shadows and first appears under the control of Count Vertigo. It subsequently appears under Ra's al Ghul's control in \\"The Demon's Quest\\" Pt. 1 and Pt. 2, \\"Showdown\\", and \\"Avatar\\". The Society of Shadows was founded by Ra's al Ghul, dating back to the 1800s and quite possibly even further than that. The purpose of the organization was to accomplish Ra's life goal of restoring the earth to a pure and untainted world and undo all the pollution and damage done to it by humanity, even if that meant destroying most, if not all of humanity to reach that goal. The organization was vast and powerful, having branches and influence all over the world. It consisted of various types of people who were fiercely loyal to Ra's, including highly trained assassins, spies, scientists, and soldiers. It also had vast resources and seemingly a large system of intelligence. This is due to the fact that Ra's was able to determine Batman's true identity partly because his organization easily determined which wealthy Americans regularly amassed the kind of technology and equipment that someone like Batman would require. * The Society of Shadows re-appears in the Superman: The Animated Series episode \\"The Demon Reborn\\". Talia al Ghul and her henchmen orchestrate the capture of Superman so that they can use an artifact to drain Superman's energy in order to replenish Ra's al Ghul's aged body. * In the future of Batman Beyond, Terry McGinnis (the future Batman) confronts Curaré, the deadliest member of the Society of Assassins (a guild of ninja assassins-for-hire in the future). The Society was led by a man known as Devon, the \\"Master Assassin\\", with other members including Mutho Botha. Terry and an elderly Bruce Wayne later battle against the Society when Ra's al Ghul (who had taken over Talia's body) attempted to take Bruce's body. The Society appears again in season 2 after Curare through a turn of events destroys most of the assassins from within. She is defeated by Batman once more and is arrested. The Society is left in tatters with no one taking over as leader after the mind wipe of the Master Assassin/Devon and Botha. * The League of Assassins appears in the Batman: The Brave and the Bold episode \\"Sidekicks Assemble\\". This marks the first media appearance of the League of Assassins that has not had its name altered. Known members of the group are Ra's al Ghul, Talia al Ghul, and Ubu. * The League of Assassins (under its League of Shadows name) appears in Young Justice. Known members of the group are Ra's al Ghul, Ubu, Sensei, Cheshire, Professor Ojo, Black Spider, and Hook. The League of Shadows make their headquarters on Infinity Island which is located somewhere in the Caribbean Sea. In \\"Infiltrator\\", the League of Shadows had abducted a nano-technology expert named Dr. Serling Roquette in order to make the \\"Fog\\" as part of a plot to steal schematic technologies. Red Arrow managed to save her from a League of Shadows base on Infinity Island, but the \\"Fog\\" has been complete. When Dr. Serling Roquette was working on an \\"Anti-Fog\\", the Sensei finds out her project and sends Cheshire to dispose of Dr. Roquette only for her to run afoul of The Team while Professor Ojo operates the \\"Fog\\". When Dr. Roquette is relocated, the Sensei sends Black Spider and Hook to help Cheshire kill Dr. Roquette only to discover that Dr. Roquette was actually Miss Martian in disguise. The upload of the \\"Anti-Fog\\" was a success destroying the \\"Fog\\". Cheshire gets away due to Artemis recognizing her while Black Spider and Hook were apprehended. It is later revealed that the Sensei is in league with \\"The Light\\" (Project Cadmus' Board of Directors). He tells \\"The Light\\" about The Team's interference and discussion between Sensei and L-2 reveal that they have \\"someone on the inside\\". In \\"Targets\\", the League of Shadows works on a plot to assassinate politicians. During that time, Sportsmaster is seen as a member of the League of Shadows when it comes to helping Cheshire. It turned out that Lex Luthor and Ra's al Ghul had orchestrated the events in order to further the goals of \\"The Light\\". In the episode \\"Bloodlines\\", Cheshire and Red Arrow raid a League of Assassins facility in Tibet in order to find the real Roy Harper (who had been kidnapped and replaced with a clone). In \\"Rescue Op\\", the League of Shadows returns again as a suspect in a metahuman traffic ring but it is not under the control of Ra's or Talia, but now under someone else in the shadows. * The League of Assassins is featured in Beware the Batman. Known members of the group include Ra's al Ghul, Lady Shiva, Cypher, and Silver Monkey. As revealed in \\"Broken\\", Katana infiltrated the League of Assassins to find Ra's al Ghul. Finding the Soultaker Sword (a weapon which can drain souls from its victims) and seeing its power first hand when Silver Monkey used it on an unknown victim, she faked her death while taking the sword to keep it from being used. In \\"Safe\\", Silver Monkey was sent to capture Dr. Jason Burr so that they can get their hand on the Ion Cortex. Silver Monkey ends up learning that Katana survived and reports it while concealing his knowledge of the Soultaker's location. Lady Shiva states to Silver Monkey that the League of Assassins will obtain control of the Ion Cortex another time and that the Soultaker Sword is now the target. In \\"Family\\", Batman and Katana fight the League of Assassins' ninjas as Silver Monkey is sent to target the Soultaker Sword. Six hours earlier, Katana is confronted by Silver Monkey in Bruce Wayne's limousine and attacks her for the location of the Soultaker so that the League of Assassins can reclaim the Soultaker. When Bethanie Ravencroft and Silver Mask lead the League of Assassins' ninjas into capturing Bruce Wayne at the A.R.G.U.S. Club, Katana is sent a message to bring the Soultaker to the A.R.G.U.S. Club in one hour. Katana confronts Bethanie Ravencroft and Silver Monkey where she wants them to release Bruce Wayne in exchange for the Soultaker. After Bruce Wayne is hit out the window by Bethanie Ravencroft's arrow (though he had a special padding underneath), the League of Assassin ninjas are unleashed upon Katana while Alfred helps Bruce Wayne to become Batman. When Katana is being overwhelmed by the ninjas, Batman arrives in the nick of time. Batman then uses a smoke pellet to cause a smokescreen where Batman and Katana fight the ninjas. A League of Assassin ninja manages to seize the Soultaker by the time the smokescreen cleared and begins to present it to Silver Monkey. Lady Shiva then arrives stating that Silver Monkey's plans to succeed her won't work. Lady Shiva then has the ninjas attack Silver Monkey who end up defeating him (it was commented by Lady Shiva that the ninjas in the League of Assassins are more afraid of Lady Shiva then they are of Silver Monkey). A ninja then gives the Soultaker Sword to Lady Shiva who then uses it to drain Bethanie Ravencroft's soul (who pleaded that she wasn't going against Lady Shiva) as she states that she has plans for Silver Monkey. Upon getting free and with the help of Alfred, Batman and Katana fight Lady Shiva and the League of Assassins' ninjas. Lady Shiva manages to get away as Batman and Katana escape from the ninjas. Batman claimed that he used Katana to turn the League of Assassins against each other as he plans to reclaim the Soultaker Sword from the League of Assassins. In \\"Control\\", the League of Assassins sends their half-human, half-computer agent Cypher to control Jason Burr in another attempt to get control over the Ion Cortex. This plot is thwarted by Batman. In \\"Sacrifice\\", the League of Assassins have a shipment that ends up stolen by Anarky. When Lady Shiva orders her ninjas to reclaim the package, Anarky shows up and makes a deal with her where he will return their package in exchange for a small favor. Lady Shiva leads some of her ninjas into obtaining the Calibosix (a cell mutation virus) from the Gotham Contagion Research Center where two of her ninjas got infected. By the time Batman had gotten the serum that cured Katana and the infected ninjas, Lady Shiva had gotten away while the two ninjas were sent to Blackgate Penitentiary. When Lady Shiva returns to her lair, she finds the package and a letter from Anarky as the package contained the body of Ra's al Ghul. In \\"Fall\\", the League of Assassins gain control of the Ion Cortex and plunge Gotham City into darkness. In \\"Darkness\\", Ra's al Ghul tried to blackmail Mayor Grange, Governor Quardu and Commissioner Correa into allowing the League of Assassins to take control of Gotham City otherwise the City would remain in darkness while doing a transmission to them. Correa was outraged by Ra's al Ghul's suggestion and was subsequently dragged away by two League of Assassins ninjas and killed. The League of Assassins in the television series Arrow * The League of Assassins appears in the TV shows set in the Arrowverse: ** The League of Assassins appears in Arrow. Though first named in season two, they are represented in season one by Malcolm Merlyn (John Barrowman). In season two, the League takes an interest in Starling City in order to retrieve its assassin, Sara Lance (Caity Lotz), an ex-lover of the Arrow (Stephen Amell), and assists the Arrow in defeating Deathstroke (Manu Bennett). In season three, Malcolm's murder of Sara forces the Arrow to challenge Ra's al Ghul (Matt Nable). By surviving Ra's' blade, Arrow becomes favoured as his successor. Appearing to defect to the League to save his sister, he secretly schemes with Ra's' daughter Nyssa (Katrina Law) to kill Ra's. In season four, Malcolm has taken over the League as the new Ra's al Ghul, until Nyssa seizes control and disbands it, although some assassins were still loyal to Merlyn as seen in the episode \\"Eleven-Fifty-Nine\\". In the episode \\"Life Sentence\\", it is revealed that the League of Assassins have feared the Longbow Hunters due to their reputation. ** The League of Assassins also appears in spin-off show Legends of Tomorrow in episode \\"Left Behind\\", where a resurrected Sara Lance is a main character. When Sara is lost in the year 1960, she rejoins the League, impressing Ra's al Ghul with her pre-trained League fighting. When rescued by her teammates, she initiates a bootstrap paradox by telling Ra's to send Nyssa to rescue her in 2008, leading to her original induction to the League. * The League of Shadows first appear in the Gotham episode \\"Heroes Rise: Destiny Calling.\\" Known members are Ra's al Ghul, Sensei, Anubis, The Hunter, Leila, and Palden. They are revealed to have manipulated the Court of Owls into doing their bidding. Some of its ninjas attacked Fish Mooney, Oswald Cobblepot/Penguin, Hugo Strange, Victor Fries, and Bridgit Pike at a slaughterhouse where Hugo Strange's earlier cures for Alice Tetch's poisonous blood was being held. Most of the ninjas there were killed by Jim Gordon which also ended with Fish Mooney accidentally getting killed. Other ninjas from the League of Assassins were present at the Yuyaun Building when Bruce Wayne first meets Ra's al Ghul. In the episode \\"A Dark Knight: \\"One of My Three Soups\\", the energy that Ra's al Ghul placed in Barbara Kean served as a beacon that called the League of Shadows to her. After the unnamed captain of the League of Shadows (portrayed by Ethan Herschenfeld) doubted Barbara Kean leading them as a female has never led them before, Barbara Kean killed him when he tried to take the title from her. After a brief blackout, the female members (named Sisters of the League) of the League of Shadows led by Leila massacred the weaker members as Barbara plans to make use of the League of Shadows. In the episode \\"A Dark Knight: To Our Deaths and Beyond\\", Ra's' loyal followers led by Palden manage to resurrect him. In the episode \\"A Dark Knight: No Man's Land\\", the League of Assassins and Jeremiah destroy the bridges out of town, isolating Gotham from the rest of the world. After Gotham City has been evacuated and following Ra's al Ghul's second death, Palden and those with him want to swear their allegiance to Barbara. After Barbara hears from Tabitha about Penguin shooting Butch Gilzean, she states that man is the problem that the world has and has Leila and her female League of Assassins teammates kill Palden and his teammates while using their bodies to establish an all-female territory. In season 5, the Sisters continue to support Barbara following Gotham becoming a No Man's Land. In the episode \\"Legend of the Dark Knight: I Am Bane\\", Ra's al Ghul's daughter Nyssa al Ghul arrives to exact revenge on Barbara and Bruce for her father's death while also being the benefactor of Delta Force. She goes to the Sirens Club, killing all of the Sisters for betraying their original leader's goals and kidnapping Barbara. This leaves the status of the remaining League's members unknown. ===Film=== The League of Shadows in the film Batman Begins * In the first film of Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy, Batman Begins (2005), they are called the League of Shadows. The foot soldiers are martial artists who utilized a number of martial arts including ninjutsu, jujitsu and various forms of kung fu. A mysterious man calling himself Henri Ducard (Liam Neeson) recruited and trained Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) for a man that he called their leader Ra's al Ghul (Ken Watanabe) for an unspecified period of time. He told Wayne the story about how the injustice of his wife being taken from him led him onto the path of the League of Shadows. Bruce rejected the League when he was ordered to kill a criminal to prove his commitment to justice and he learned that the League wanted him to lead a mission to destroy Gotham City. The League's base was destroyed in the subsequent battle as Wayne fought the man that he had believed to be Ra's al Ghul and left him for dead. The League later enacted their plan to destroy Gotham and Ducard revealed to Wayne that he was Ra's al Ghul at Bruce Wayne's birthday party. They attacked Gotham because they felt that the city had become decadent. Ra's al Ghul said that the League had worked to restore the world to balance throughout history as human civilization achieved decadence around the world. Ra's stated \\"We sacked Rome, loaded trade ships with plague rats, burned London to the ground\\". The plan was to use the stolen Wayne Enterprises microwave emitter to vaporize Scarecrow's (Cillian Murphy) toxin and have the city's inhabitants tear each other apart in a state of fear. Despite their best efforts, Bruce Wayne, now Batman, was able to fight off four members of the League single-handedly, before defeating Ra's al Ghul himself aboard a train where Ra's al Ghul was left to die as it crashed. * The League of Shadows again makes an appearance in the third and final film of Nolan's Batman trilogy, The Dark Knight Rises (2012). The League, now under the leadership of Bane (Tom Hardy) and a secret accomplice, returns to finish Ra's al Ghul's plan to destroy Gotham City. Its membership now includes a large number of Bane's fellow mercenaries who were former employees of corrupt Wayne Enterprise board member John Daggett. The newly resurrected League of Shadows plots to hold Gotham under siege by converting a fusion reactor that was developed by Wayne Enterprises in a project sponsored by Miranda Tate (Marion Cotillard) into a nuclear bomb. During their first confrontation, Bane defeated Batman and placed him in Bane's former home, a foreign penitentiary known only as \\"the Pit\\". After trapping most of the members of the GCPD in the sewers, Bane then proceeded to hold Gotham hostage while giving the citizens false hope of survival by means of a faux revolution while stating that he has given the trigger of the bomb to a random Gothamite. The next day, Bane exposed the truth about Harvey Dent and had all of the inmates of Blackgate Penitentiary released by his men. While in his cell, Bruce was told the story of an exiled mercenary and his wife and child that were once imprisoned there. The child was said to be the only one who successfully escaped the prison. Ra's al Ghul appeared to Bruce in the form of a hallucination, who implied that he was \\"immortal\\" through the birth of his child within the Pit, the heir to the League of Shadows. Bruce assumed that the mercenary's child was Bane and that Ra's al Ghul was his father. After Batman had defeated Bane, Miranda stabbed Batman and revealed herself as Talia al Ghul, Ra's al Ghul's child, who climbed out of the Pit with the aid of her childhood friend and protector Bane. Bane was secretly working with her while she operated under the name of Miranda Tate to complete her father's mission, showing Batman that she was always the one who held the trigger to the nuclear bomb. Talia recounted that the League trained her and Bane, that Ra's banished Bane because he reminded him of the prior loss of his wife, and that Bane's only crime was loving her. Talia resented her father for this, but she was never able to forgive him until he died fighting Batman. Selina Kyle/Catwoman (Anne Hathaway) kills Bane with the Bat-Pod's cannon at short range, and she and Batman confront Talia, eventually forcing her truck carrying the bomb off the road where she died believing that her father's work was finished. Following a battle within Gotham City's streets and the deaths of Bane and Talia, the rest of the surviving League members in the city along with Gotham's criminals are either jailed, incapacitated, or killed in battle against the GCPD. * The League of Assassins appears in Son of Batman. They are initially led by Ra's al Ghul until his former right-hand and heir Deathstroke kills him and a sect of League ninjas join him. It was mentioned that Ra's al Ghul had used Kirk Langstrom in his Man-Bat Commandos project. Following Ra's al Ghul's death, Deathstroke resumed the project by coercing Dr. Langstrom to help him by kidnapping his wife and daughter. * The League of Assassins appears in Batman: Bad Blood. They are led by Talia al Ghul who has reclaimed the League after Deathstroke's defeat. * In Teen Titans: The Judas Contract, Deathstroke states that he plans to form his own League of Assassins with the money that Brother Blood is paying him. * The League of Assassins is mentioned in Suicide Squad: Hell to Pay. Deathstroke makes a cameo in a flashback where he murders Bronze Tiger's fiancée whilst still a member of the League. Deadshot is also stated to have worked for the League once while Bronze Tiger reveals he went undercover during a mission by the CIA. * The League of Assassins appear in the crossover cartoon movie Batman vs. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Ra's al Ghul and Ubu appear as the featured members. The League of Assassins collaborate with the Foot Clan in a plot to steal a Wayne Enterprises cloud seeder in a plot to affect Gotham City's population with a hybrid compound of the mutagen and Joker venom. One League of Assassins ninja (voiced by Tom Kenny who was not credited for the role) was used as a test subject to demonstrate the Ooze's abilities where it turns him into a mutant wolf. During the course of the film, a select number of other League of Assassins ninjas were mutated by the mutagen that Shredder used on them turning them into mutant animals like mutant wolves, a mutant African elephant, a mutant hippopotamus, and a mutant lion. * The League of Assassins (now going by the name of League of Shadows) appears in Justice League Dark: Apokolips War. The group is now led by Damian Wayne, with Lady Shiva as his right hand. ===Video games=== * The League of Shadows appear in Batman Begins. * One of the achievements (Xbox 360)/trophies (PlayStation 3) of the game Lego Batman: The Videogame is called League of Assassins. This achievement is unlocked if the player manages all the villains of the game. * The League of Assassins appears in DC Universe Online. * The League of Assassins appear in the Batman: Arkham games: ** They first appear in Batman: Arkham City. The League are first hinted at in the game when several grunt inmates exclaim they may have just seen a ninja, though they are not actually seen until Batman tries to rescue Mr. Freeze from the Penguin. The League is made up of Talia's elite guard, and is notably the only incarnation of the League of Assassins in both comics and media to be composed of mostly female ninjas with Ra's being the only male member shown in Arkham City. A member of the League is first seen on display meditating in the Penguin's museum, Penguin explaining he had no idea who she actually was, but that she had broken into his museum (why she was in the museum at all is never explained) and managed to kill eight of his men before she was beaten into unconsciousness. After Penguin is defeated and Batman mentions Ra's al Ghul to Mr. Freeze, the assassin opens her eyes and desperately tries to break the glass to her display, eventually succeeding at the cost of a bloody shoulder wound. She exclaims that Batman and Freeze are unworthy to speak of the great Ra's al Ghul before fleeing the museum, the bloodstains leaving a trail for Batman to follow out of the museum and onto the Bowery rooftops. Batman finds a bloody rag used to clean the wound and tries to scan it before the ninja attacks him. Batman follows the ninja and manages to put a tracer on her before she has him in a death stroke and two other assassins at her side. Robin saves Batman from the trio before Batman follows them down into the sewers and eventually into Wonder City. Batman is surrounded by multiple ninjas and about to be killed before he is saved by Talia al Ghul. After Batman takes the Demon Trial they are not seen again, but it is revealed that Ra's, Talia and the League of Assassins were funding Quincy Sharp's mayoral campaign and rigged it to win in his favor. They were also the power behind Hugo Strange and Protocol 10, which, if successful, would have meant Strange was Ra's al Ghul's successor. As Strange, Ra's al Ghul and Talia al Ghul are all dead by the end of the game, it appears the League has lost both its leader and possible successors. Though as both Ra's al Ghul and Talia al Ghul's bodies are missing, it is possible that the League of Assassins may have taken their bodies to a Lazarus Pit. ** The League of Assassins return in Batman: Arkham Knight in The Season of Infamy downloadable content (DLC) in a side mission titled \\"Shadow War\\". Following the Arkham City incident, Ra's had been moved to a Lazarus Pit beneath Elliot Memorial Hospital, with tubes pumping Lazarus into him barely keeping him alive. The League subsequently split between the loyalist faction loyal to Ra's and the rebels led by Nyssa Raatko and engaged in their own civil war in Gotham. When Batman finds Ra's, his loyalists demand that he retrieve a sample of pure Lazarus in the possession of the rebels to restore Ra's, playing on his morality by informing the Dark Knight that a civil war amongst the League would endanger Gotham citizens. When Batman later obtains a sample of pure Lazarus, he is confronted by Nyssa, who gave him an ultimatum: deny Ra's the pure Lazarus and she would pull the League out of Gotham, never to shed innocent blood. *Eleven months before its announcement at DC FanDome on August 22, 2020 , Gotham Knights was officially teased by WB Games Montréal with symbols related to the Batman universe and the \\"Capture the Knight\\" tagline. The first teaser released on September 23, 2019 showed the Demon's Head, hinting that the League of Assassins will appear in the gamehttps://twitter.com/WBGamesMTL/status/1176182754712727554 ===Miscellaneous=== The Leagues of Assassins (top) and Shadows (bottom) as they appear in the Animated Continuity. Art by Rick Burchett. * Batman: The Gotham Adventures (based on Batman: The Animated Series) revealed that the League of Assassins existed as a separate entity from the Society of Shadows (although both groups served Ra's al Ghul). Much like their counterpart in the mainstream DC Universe, this version of the League of Assassins was responsible for the murder of Boston Brand, creating the ghostly hero Deadman. The Sensei was loyal to Ra's in this continuity and, faced with either living out the last of his years in prison or defying Ra's wishes, chose a third option where he walks out of his mountain home and off the cliff. * The League of Shadows appears in the comic book tie-in to Young Justice. In issue #3, Sensei sends Hook and Black Spider to assassinate Selena Gonzales (who was one of the former associates of Project Cadmus). In issue #4, Hook and Black Spider were defeated by Young Justice. However, Selena Gonzales was nowhere to be found causing the team to speculate that another operative was waiting for her to escape. In issue #11, Ubu was with Ra's al Ghul when the League of Shadows planned to hijack a rocket at Cape Canaveral. In issue #12, it was revealed that Matt Hagen was a member of the League of Shadows where his attempt to cure his cancer in the Lazarus Pit led to his transformation into Clayface upon Talia al Ghul locking him in the Lazarus Pit. Ra's al Ghul and Sensei managed to trick Clayface into sleeping and shipped his canister to the Wayne Foundation. * In Arrow tie-in comic, The Dark Archer, the League of Assassins once encountered a similar organization called \\"The Hidden\\" in 1985. They encountered Malcolm Merlyn (who will join to them 8 years later) and Darius when searching for Ashkiri marker (in fact, the entire mountain) in Hindu Kush mountains, but their vehicle flipped in sandstorm and knocked out some members. One assassin was punished from Ra's for losing The Hidden. The member of The Hidden, Darius, is revealed as member of the League, acting as a double agent. Ra's and Darius went to enter Ashkiri temple for searching Lazarus Pit and the hearts of snow leopard gods, while The Hidden wanted to protect the temple from them. In the same time, Lourdes (implied to be Nyssa's mother Amina Raatko) and Malcolm also entered the temple whose aim was to seal a temple.

It was founded in 1984. Dumb type is a group of creative art forms that express the new and daily life of the twentieth century modern and technological world of Japan. During the 1980s Dumb Type created their first show representing the idea of how technology is arising a dark matter through people's daily lives. Present day they have created 4 more shows since. The productions are performed among many members who are skilled in music, architecture, visual artists, choreography, and computer programming. The variety of forms helps create an entertaining show like no other. Members are trained in varied disciplines, including visual arts, theatre, dance, architecture, music composition and computer programming. Their work ranges across such diverse media as art exhibitions, performances, audiovisuals and publications. Dumb Type is known for portraying a dark, cynical, and humorous world in which technology is a way of life—if not necessarily a welcome one. In a 1990 interview in High Performance, the late Teiji Furuhashi, one of Dumb Type's founding members, described their work as political in nature. \\"Something Japanese theater never does. Japanese audiences don't want to see that. They want to avoid it. They just want entertainment. Yes, I think we should always have a political view. We should represent that this is Japan.\\" Notable in a country plagued by political apathy, the group has played the unpopular role of AIDS activist, organizing symposia and other events, motivated in part by the fact that Furuhashi died of AIDS in 1995. Dumb Type’s name was influenced by the English words’ “mute” or “stupid.” The founded leader of the group Furuhashi, suggested that the name “Dumb Type” expressed an idea of the reality that Japan has become because it's technology and the attraction to the media. The society around Japan became very superficial and everyone was aware of the media around them but felt overwhelmed with all the information given to them. This inspired the artistic performances expressing their feelings about it. While based in Kyoto, Japan's ancient capital, Dumb Type is oriented more to the global than the local, the contemporary over the traditional. Dumb Type members claim that Japanese art movements have had little influence on their work. Furuhashi explained that the core group—Furuhashi, Toru Koyamada, Yukihiro Hozumi, Shiro Takatani, Takayuki Fujimoto and Hiromasa Tomari—began working together in 1982, while still students at Kyoto City University of Arts. \\"We were frustrated artists, and wanted to start creating something new with our skills. Most of the time we spent discussing society or whatever, not specific art things. When someone had an idea it would be presented on a piece of paper. If the group was interested, we made it come true. At first the idea would be really open, then gradually it became something very specific. In that way, we're really democratic. Dumb Type is a collaborative group; we don't want a king.\\" Their work has been exhibited and performed at notable venues internationally. == References External links== * Official website * Category:Japanese artist groups and collectives Category:Arts organizations established in 1984 Category:1984 establishments in Japan ","title":"Dumb Type"},{"id":"1998989","text":"Ken Michael and his wife Julie Ken Michael and his wife Julie receiving Quentin Bryce, the Governor-General of Australia, and her husband Michael, at Government House, Perth.

On her way to Ashby Wake Cassie is hit by a car. The driver of the car, Mrs Marion Kirkman (Kerry Fox), immediately calls an ambulance. During an examination at the local hospital the doctor concludes Cassie only has some scratches and not even a concussion, but Cassie has lost her memory due to the accident. She only knows her name and mother country, but she does not know which town she comes from, who her family is and why she is in England. The doctor explains to her that the loss of memory is caused by a shock and that she will regain it after some recuperation. As a result of the examination Cassie is checked out. Marion Kirkman invites Cassie to stay at her house until she has overcome her loss of memory, because Mrs Kirkman feels guilty and responsible for the lonely girl who nobody knows. While recovering, Cassie is drawn into a deeper mystery, which seems to involve her hosts and other people she sees about the town. Her lack of memory compounds the air of suspense as she encounters a man named Dan Blakely (Ioan Gruffudd), whom she believes she knows, but with no idea from where. Cassie becomes very attached to Marion Kirkman's son, Michael (Harry Forrester) and becomes acquainted with her husband Simon (Stephen Dillane), an art historian, who is in the process of examining a church from Early Christianity (built in Glastonbury during the first century AD) after the arrival of Joseph of Arimathea. This church was recently discovered by two visitors to the Glastonbury Festival who died after falling down a hole through the open roof of the buried church. In the Church there is an unusual relief made of stone, which illustrates the crucifixion of Christ. Also depicted are many curious onlookers who appear to be observing the gruesome scene. During the next few days, Cassie has visions of the future of the people around her. She also recognises certain people who seem to watch her and often appear in a certain place in Glastonbury which she visits. She observes the strange auto mechanic Frederick Michael Argyle (Peter McNamara) and examines his belongings, which include a scrapbook containing news clippings that detail accusations of child abuse at a local orphanage, that were ignored by the townspeople. The orphanage turns out to be the house the Kirkmans now live in. Cassie finds that Argyle was one of the children who was abused and that he identifies himself with the young Michael. She discovers that Argyle is planning to take revenge on the people of the town for their cruelty to him. Cassie suspects that a catastrophe is imminent, but she is unable to persuade anyone else of the impending danger she senses. She eventually finds out that the relief in the church illustrates a group of people known as \\"The Gathering\\". They are immortal and damned to watch catastrophes and murders for eternity as they stopped to watch the crucifixion of Christ out of morbid curiosity, a concept similar to the legend of the Wandering Jew. The priest and Bishop also discover this, and the priest rushes to inform Mr Kirkman. However, on the way he sees the \\"Gathering\\" on a bridge over the highway, and dies in a car accident as a result. The Gathering merely watch. Later that same day, Cassie experiences visions where she watches a young Argyle dragged into the house by the orphanage priest while three of the town's leading figures watch and laugh. The priest then drags the child into a nearby room where he further abuses the child and is joined by the other three men. Cassie follows the men into the room, only to wake from the vision to see Michael standing over pictures of the archaeological site. Cassie then finds one of the photographs, which seems to horrify her. However, after the priest's accident, the Bishop is able to pass on this strange news to Mr Kirkman, who realises that his family is in great danger. He hastens to drive home to try to prevent whatever is fated to occur. Cassie is then seen attending the local festival with the Kirkman children only to then see the strange people gathering around the fairgrounds. She attempts to warn the police once more of Argyle's intent, but instead discovers Dan, who has killed the officer on duty. He then reveals that he is one of the Gathering, who have since stopped simply watching the world's tragedies but have also begun to set up the potential tragedies to be more likely to happen. Cassie manages to prevent Argyle from killing festival goers with a bomb, but is unable to stop him taking revenge upon the men who had abused him. After a harrowing chase, Cassie sacrifices her life to save the lives of the children of the Kirkman family. Mr Kirkman arrives just in time to stop Argyle from killing his family. At the end it is revealed that Cassie also belongs to The Gathering, because just after she \\"dies\\", she appears standing among them as they stare at Argyle being electrocuted. Cassie is shown to be weeping while the others just stand there and watch impassively. Because Cassie has shown compassion and tried to prevent evil deeds, her life of wandering will end and she will find peace, which she tells the son of Mr Kirkman at night on the same day. Similarities with the Ray Bradbury story \\"The Crowd\\" have been noted. == Cast == * Christina Ricci as Cassie Grant * Ioan Gruffudd as Dan Blakeley * Kerry Fox as Marion Kirkman * Stephen Dillane as Simon Kirkman * Simon Russell Beale as Luke Fraser * Robert Hardy as Bishop * Harry Forrester as Michael Kirkman * Jessica Mann as Emma Kirkman * Peter McNamara as Frederick Michael Argyle ==Filming locations== The production team visited Penshurst Place in Kent to film at the Barons Hall, which doubled up as part of the Church where the Bishop held meetings with the Clergy.

In 1952, when the Portuguese Laws of Banishment were repealed, the Duke moved his family to Portugal, thus returning the Miguelist Braganzas to their homeland and becoming the first of the former Portuguese royal dynasty to live in Portugal since the deposition of the monarchy, in 1910.Though they were not the first Portuguese royalty to visit Portugal since 1910, as various of the Duke's relatives had visited the country, albeit illegally, during the monarchist insurrections of the North, in the 1910s, and Duarte Nuno's sister, Infanta Filipa, officially visited in 1940, and Dowager- Queen Amélie of Orleans officially visited in 1945. Once established in Portugal, the Duke was granted a pension and residence by the Fundação da Casa de Bragança, the organization has owned and managed all the private assets of the House of Braganza, since the death of King Manuel II, in 1932. Duarte Nuno spent the rest of his life attempting, without success, the restoration of all Brigantine assets to his family and recreating the image of the Miguelist Braganzas in Portuguese society, all under the goal of the restoration of the Portuguese monarchy, under the Braganzas. In 1942, the Duarte Nuno married Princess Maria Francisca of Orléans-Braganza, daughter of Pedro de Alcântara, Prince of Grão-Pará. Their marriage reconciled two branches of the House of Braganza, in two different ways, reuniting the Portuguese and Brazilian Brigantine houses and specifically reuniting the Miguelist and Liberal Braganzas, which had been estranged since 1828, when the War of Two Brothers was waged between King-Emperor Pedro IV & I, founder of the Liberal Braganzas, and King Miguel I, founder of the Miguelist Braganzas. The couple had three sons, the eldest of whom is Duarte Pio, Duke of Braganza, the current pretender to the defunct Portuguese throne. ==Birth== Duarte Nuno Fernando Maria Miguel Gabriel Rafael Francisco Xavier Raimundo António was born at Seebenstein Castle in Austria-Hungary, the son of Miguel, Duke of Braganza and of his second wife, Princess Maria Theresa of Löwenstein-Wertheim-Rosenberg. Duarte Nuno had two older half-brothers, one older half-sister and eight sisters. His paternal grandparents were Miguel I of Portugal and Princess Adelaide of Löwenstein-Wertheim-Rosenberg. His maternal grandparents were Charles, 6th Prince of Löwenstein-Wertheim-Rosenberg, and Princess Sophie of Liechtenstein. Duarte Nuno's father was the Miguelist claimant to the throne of Portugal who opposed his cousins, the reigning line of the House of Braganza-Saxe-Coburg and Gotha descended from Queen Maria II. Duarte Nuno's family had been disinherited and banished by Maria II for rebellion. In spite of this, with the permission of Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria, Portuguese soil had been placed under the bed where he was born, so that Duarte Nuno and his siblings could claim to have been born on Portuguese soil in order to comply with the Portuguese law of succession. The day after his birth, Duarte Nuno was baptised at Seebenstein. His godparents were his aunt the Infanta Adelgundes, Duchess of Guimarães and the husband of another aunt, the Infante Alfonso Carlos, Duke of San Jaime (both of whom were represented by proxies). ==Succession as Miguelist claimant== Duarte Nuno's second brother, Prince Francis Joseph of Braganza, died in 1919, and on 21 July 1920 his eldest brother, Prince Miguel, Duke of Viseu, renounced his succession rights. Ten days later on 31 July 1920 Duarte Nuno's father, Miguel, abdicated his claim to the Portuguese throne in favour of Duarte Nuno.Abdicação de Dom Miguel II de Bragança em Dom Duarte Nuno Henceforth the Miguelists recognised Duarte Nuno as King Duarte II of Portugal, even though Portugal had become a republic in 1910 when Maria II's great-grandson, King Manuel II (who was still living in 1920), was sent into exile. Duarte Nuno used Duke of Braganza as a title of pretense. Since Duarte Nuno was only twelve years old when he succeeded as Miguelist claimant to the Portuguese throne, his aunt, the Duchess of Guimarães, acted as regent for him until he attained his majority. In 1921, she issued a manifesto outlining the family's goals for the restoration of the monarchy. The renouncement of Duarte Nuno's father was intended to improve the relationship between the two monarchist groups in Portugal: the supporters of the Braganza-Saxe-Coburg line of Manuel II and the supporters of the Miguelist line of Duarte Nuno. The Braganza-Saxe-Coburg line was called \\"constitutional\\" because it had accepted a liberal constitution for Portugal. ==Succession as Constitutional claimant== Portrait of the Duke in the Pact of Paris, which he signed with King Manuel II. After the death of his uncle Afonso in 1920, ex- King Manuel II had no close relatives who could claim the throne according to the Constitutional Charter of 1826 (the constitution in force from 1842 until the overthrow of the monarchy in 1910).There was an 1838 constitution which specifically removed succession rights from Duarte Nuno's grandfather Miguel and his family, but it had been repealed in 1842, when the Constitutional Charter of 1826 was re-instated. See The Parliament in the History of the Constitution The conflict between the Miguelist line and the Braganza-Saxe- Coburg and Gotha's was not just about which person should be sovereign; it was also about how much power the sovereign should have. The Miguelists upheld Portugal's tradition of autocratic absolutism, while the Braganza-Saxe-Coburg and Gotha's adhered to constitutional monarchy. In 1912, Duarte Nuno's father, Miguel, met with Manuel to try to come to some agreement so that there would not be two claimants to the Portuguese throne, both living in exile. Their representatives allegedly signed the Pact of Dover by which Miguel recognised Manuel as king, while Manuel recognised the succession rights of Duarte Nuno should Manuel and his uncle Afonso die without children. The pact was unpopular with the supporters of both sides, some claiming that it was never actually signed. On 17 April 1922 a second agreement called the Pact of Paris was signed by the representatives of Duarte Nuno and Manuel in which Manuel agreed that the Cortes should select his heir if he died without descendants, while Duarte Nuno agreed to ask and recommend that his followers accept Manuel as king-in-exile.D. Duarte Nuno de Bragança, um rei que não reinou : testemunhos sobre a vida e a obra de D. Duarte II, chefe da Casa Real Portuguesa (Lisbon, 1992). Strictly speaking the Pact of Dover and the Pact of Paris were private agreements, legally unenforceable. Nor did King Manuel agree to any provision in the latter pact which contravened Portugal's last monarchist constitution. But the agreements were important steps in reconciling the Miguelist and the Braganza-Saxe-Coburg branches of Portugal's royal family, and helped move the supporters of each toward a united monarchist movement. In 1927, Duarte Nuno's father died. On 2 July 1932 Manuel II died. Henceforth, the majority of monarchists, both Miguelist and constitutional, supported Duarte Nuno as claimant to the Portuguese throne. João António de Azevedo Coutinho, the head of Causa Monárquica and Manuel II's lieutenant while he was in exile, published a declaration in support of Duarte Nuno. Later Duarte Nuno was received in audience in Paris by Manuel's mother, Queen Amelie. While Duarte Nuno was accepted by most monarchists, there were some constitutionalists who continued to contest his claim. Duarte Nuno was undisputed as the legal heir of his grandfather, Miguel I, but there were doubts about whether he was the legal heir of the last reigning king of Portugal, Manuel II. Articles 87 and 88 of the Constitutional Charter of 1826, in force when the monarchy was overthrown, stated that the throne passed first to the descendants of Queen Maria II (from whom Duarte Nuno was not descended), and only when they were extinct to collateral heirs.Carta Constitucional de 1826 Maria II had living descendants in 1932, but none of these had Portuguese nationality. Article 89 of the 1826 Charter stipulated that \\"no foreigner may succeed to the crown of the kingdom of Portugal\\".Carta Constitucional de 1826 There was also some doubt about Duarte Nuno's nationality. Duarte Nuno's grandfather had been sent into exile by the law of 19 December 1834. Neither Duarte Nuno nor his father were born in Portugal, but Emperor Franz Josef I of Austria had granted extraterritoriality to Duarte Nuno's birthplace. Article 8 of the 1826 Charter stated that Portuguese citizenship is lost \\"by those who are banished by sentence\\".Carta Constitucional de 1826 The fact that Duarte Nuno and his father had not been born in Portugal, and the fact that their family had been banished from Portugal left it unclear whether their branch's Portuguese citizenship had been preserved uninterruptedly. However, Dom Duarte's line was banished by law rather than by judicial sentence, and the 1834 constitution in force at the time of D. Miguel I's banishment did not protect the citizenship of those exiled by law. On the other hand, when the Constitutional Charter of 1826 was re-instated in 1842, it cancelled the 1834 charter's clause depriving Miguel I and his heirs of succession rights as dynasts. Their banishment had not, however, been stipulated in that charter, but in a separate law that was not repealed until 1950. A minority of monarchists considered a candidate other than Duarte Nuno. Manuel's genealogical heir at his death in 1932 was ex-Crown Prince George of Saxony (a great-grandson of Maria II), but he was not Portuguese; he was also a Catholic priest. George's siblings have descendants living, but none is known to have had Portuguese citizenship. The genealogical heir of Maria II's younger brother Emperor Pedro II of Brazil was his great- grandson Prince Pedro Gastão of Orléans-Braganza; he too was not Portuguese, but the fact that he was Brazilian and therefore imbued with Portuguese culture made him a somewhat attractive candidate. The closest heir who was undoubtedly Portuguese was Constança Berquó de Mendonça, 4th Duchess of Loulé (a great-great-granddaughter of King John VI), but her branch of the family put forth no claim at that time, nor did King Manuel II ever consider it. Many scholars claim the Loulé lost their rights to the throne since the secret marriage of the Infanta Ana de Jesus with the Marquis of Loulé had not been authorised by either the competent authority, the Cortes, nor by the Regency Committee, although it had been authorised by the Infanta-Regent. Nevertheless, the Portuguese constitution demanded more, a marriage \\"at King's appraisal\\", whereas the Infanta-Regent said expressly that she only authorised her sister's marriage \\"because her mother assumed all the responsibility\\". Moreover, both Kings Miguel and her father, previously, expressly forbade the marriage. A woman calling herself Maria Pia de Saxe-Coburgo e Bragança claimed to be the bastard daughter of King Carlos I. She also claimed to have been recognised by the King as possessing succession rights. Her supporters played upon the traditional rivalry between the Miguelist line and the Braganza-Saxe- Coburg and Gotha line to advance her cause. ==Education== Duarte Nuno's first tutors were two Portuguese ladies, Maria Luisa Castelo and Maria das Dores de Sousa Prego. Later he was taught by the Benedictine monk Frei Estevao from the monastery of Cucujães. Duarte Nuno attended school at the Abbey of Ettal in Bavaria and the Abbey of Clairvaux in France and then completed his secondary education in Regensburg. He received a degree in agricultural sciences from the University of Toulouse. Although forbidden entry to Portugal by the law of exile against the descendants of Miguel I, he visited the country in secret in 1929. ==Marriage== Duarte Nuno's wife, Princess Maria Francisca of Orléans- Braganza. On 15 October 1942, in the cathedral of Petrópolis in Brazil, Duarte Nuno married Princess Maria Francisca of Orléans-Braganza (8 September 1914 – 15 January 1968), daughter of Pedro de Alcântara, Prince of Grão-Pará. The marriage was particularly popular since Maria Francisca was the great- granddaughter of Pedro II of Brazil, the younger brother of Queen Maria II. The marriage thus united the two rival lines of the Portuguese royal family. Maria Francisca and her family were also viewed as representatives of a liberal monarchy as opposed to the traditional conservatism of Duarte Nuno's family. ==Return to Portugal== On 27 May 1950 the National Assembly repealed the laws of exile of 19 December 1834 and 15 October 1910.Law no. 2040 of 1950 (published in the Diário do Governo no. 99/1950, Series I of 1950-05-27, page 323) Duarte Nuno, however, did not return to Portugal until 1952 on account of a car accident in Thionville in which he was seriously injured. He was presented with a residence in Portugal by the Fundação Casa de Bragança. Portuguese dictator António de Oliveira Salazar thought about restoring the monarchy in 1951, after the death of President Óscar Carmona, but he chose instead to hold the 1951 Portuguese presidential election and maintain the post of republican Head of State as it had appeared in the Constitution of 1933. In 1974, Duarte Nuno handed over his residence, the Palácio de São Marcos, to the University of Coimbra. From then until his death two years later, he lived in southern Portugal with his unmarried sister, the Infanta Filippa. American author Walter J. P. Curley interviewed Duarte Nuno near the end of his life, and his book Monarchs in Waiting describes Duarte Nuno as suffering from \\"nervous depression\\" since the death of his wife. Duarte Nuno was Grand Master of the Order of the Immaculate Conception of Vila Viçosa and Sovereign of the Order of Saint Isabel. He was a Bailiff Grand Cross of Honour and Devotion of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta and a Knight of the (Austrian) Order of the Golden Fleece. Duarte Nuno is buried in the Augustinian monastery in Vila Viçosa, the traditional burial place of the Dukes of Braganza. == Distinctions  Titles and styles === * 23 September 1907 – 31 July 1920 His Royal Highness Prince Duarte Nuno of Braganza, Infante of Portugal * 31 July 1920 – 24 December 1976 His Royal Highness The Duke of Braganza === Orders == Portuguese dynastic orders ==== As the head of the House of Braganza, Duarte Nuno held the following positions: * 60x60px Grand Master of the Order of the Immaculate Conception of Vila Viçosa * 60x60px Grand Master of the Order of Saint Michael of the Wing * 60x60px Sovereign of the Order of Saint Isabel ==== Foreign dynastic orders ==== * 60x60px Knight Grand Cross of Justice of the Calabrian Two Sicilian Order of Saint George (Royal Family of the Two Sicilies) ==GenealogyAncestry= Issue === {| style=\\"text-align: center; width: 100%;\\" class=\\"wikitable\\" ! style=\\"width: 20%;\\" | Name !! style=\\"width: 100px;\\" | Portrait !! style=\\"width: 10em;\\" | Birth !!

Connor is the son of Oliver Queen, the original Green Arrow, and his former girlfriend Sandra \\"Moonday\\" Hawke. Connor Hawke first appeared in Green Arrow (volume 2) #0 (1994). Following the \\"Flashpoint\\" storyline and 2011's New 52 reboot, Connor has yet to be reintroduced into DC's primary storytelling continuity. An alternative universe version of Connor does however appear in the series Earth 2, as a World Army member named Red Arrow who assists the Wonders in the war with Darkseid. Outside of comics, multiple versions of Connor appear in The CW's Arrowverse, where he has been both a biological and an adopted son of John Diggle, rather than Oliver's, played by Joseph David-Jones. Another loose adaptation of the story, which involves Oliver discovering he has an illegitimate son named William Clayton, is also depicted on Arrow with the present day version played by Jack Moore and the future adult version played by Ben Lewis. ==Fictional character biographyMeeting Oliver Queen=== Connor Hawke met Oliver Queen after Oliver came to stay at the ashram where Connor had been studying for some years. Oliver who had previously retreated to the ashram decades before, looking for peace after accidentally killing a criminal (in The Flash (Vol 1) #217), returned to the ashram under similar circumstances, haunted by the thought that he had killed his former best friend Hal Jordan, who, at the time, was involuntarily serving as the host of the supervillain Parallax. Thanks to Connor, who was a big fan of Green Arrow, Oliver was able to regain a semblance of inner peace and venture out into the world again, especially after numerous attempts on his life had been made. Connor decided to journey with Oliver, and created a costume similar to his. Connor served as Oliver's sidekick, also meeting with Eddie Fyers, the former federal agent that acted as a form of counsel for Oliver. It was during this time that Oliver learned about his connection to Connor from the ghost of Hal Jordan: Connor was Oliver's son, conceived during Oliver's college years. Eddie Fyers had already deduced this, but Oliver did not take the revelation well. He subsequently agreed to go undercover in an eco-terrorist group called the Eden Corps for the government. The mission turned out to be fatal for Oliver, as his arm was connected to a bomb in a plane that was headed for Metropolis. Rather than endanger Metropolis, and refusing to allow his arm to be amputated, he sacrificed himself to let the bomb explode away from the city. With his father dead, Connor decided to take up the mantle of Green Arrow and continue his hero's work. ===The new Green Arrow=== Connor Hawke's debut as Green Arrow in Green Arrow vol. 2, #0 (1994). Art by Jim Aparo. Connor continued to travel with Eddie, accompanied at times by Connor's martial arts mentor Master Jansen. Connor tried to find his place not only in the hero world, but also in the legacy of Green Arrow. Akin to the friendship between his father and Hal Jordan, Connor became quick friends with the new Green Lantern (Kyle Rayner), who himself was struggling to live up to a legacy. Connor also met Black Canary (Dinah Laurel Lance), Oliver's former and longtime romantic interest, who gave him one of Oliver's old bows, which Connor would use from then on (though the news that Oliver was dead had sent Black Canary, who was already suffering from a string of misfortunes - loss of income from the destruction of her florist shop and the loss of her superhuman ability - into a despair, it was finally ended by her association with Oracle and she was Oracle's agent by the time she finally met Connor). Besides making other friends such as Robin (Tim Drake), he also made significant enemies in the fighting world, including the Silver Monkey, an assassin and member of the Monkey Fist martial arts cult. Their first encounter resulted in a decisive loss for Connor, which was also filmed and sold underground. Connor's close win in a rematch resulted in a loss of face for the Monkey Fist cult and set Connor on a path that would bring him face to face with Lady Shiva, said to be the deadliest assassin in the world. During the Brotherhood of the Fist storyline, the Monkey Fist schools attacked various world-class martial artists attempting to prove their worthiness and skill after having been dishonored by the Silver Monkey's loss. Under the alias \\"Paper Monkey,\\" Shiva arrived in Gotham City where Connor had allied with Batman, Nightwing, and Robin. Shiva's final opponent was Connor, who was the prime target of the Monkey Fist. Though a close and taxing contest, Shiva was the victor, with Connor unconscious and defenseless. Thankfully, Shiva's old pupil, Tim Drake who had saved her life during a previous encounter, asked her not to kill Connor, trading a life for a life. After warning Robin that using the favor now meant she would challenge and kill the boy wonder when he was older, she refrained from killing Connor and departed. Batman warned Connor that he would be perceived as surviving a battle with Shiva through his own skill and would therefore be a possible target for any fighters building their way up to a battle against her. Connor also applied for membership in the JLA, replacing his father. On the date of his second interview, he singlehandedly saved the League from the hands of the Key, defeating the Key's robots by using his father's old trick arrows after the Key had destroyed his own. In the end, he knocked out the Key using his father's trademark boxing glove arrow, and was accepted as a member of the JLA. He would later be used by Batman as a \\"traitor\\" in the League in a ploy to defeat Lex Luthor's Injustice Gang. Connor left the League afterward, feeling he was better suited for the street- level work and out of his element in the epic adventures of the Justice League, although he did remain on reserve status. During this time, he also developed a friendship with Kyle Rayner, the latest Green Lantern, occasionally contacting Kyle for help if he felt that he was dealing with a problem that went beyond his skillset. One unique mission against the Eden Corps- the organisation responsible for Oliver Queen's death- saw Connor team up with a temporally-displaced Hal Jordan, pulled from early in his career as a hero, with the two musing on how they had each never had a chance to know Oliver (As Hal was from a point before he had developed his close ties to the archer). He and Eddie returned for a time to the ashram where Connor was raised, although they both often returned to the outside world, aiding Robin at one point when his Brentwood Academy roommate had been attacked by a demon, and again when Robin, the Spoiler, and Batgirl were attempting to protect Robin's father from an ancient cult. ===Return to action=== When Oliver returned from the dead, Connor left the ashram and tracked him down. After Connor manages to save his father from warlock Stanley Dover, Connor and Oliver move in together in Star City. The two live with Mia Dearden, a runaway that Oliver has taken in and trained as his new sidekick Speedy. Since returning to the superhero life, Connor has been wounded seriously twice, once by the villain called Onomatopoeia and once by Constantine Drakon, but he continues in his hero role. He is the voice of reason for Oliver, and the two have since formed a real father-son relationship. During his recovery from Onomatopoeia's attack, Oliver Queen and his former sidekick Roy Harper went on a trip across the country recovering old possessions. One of them was an old photograph which revealed that Oliver had been present at Connor's birth, but later ran from the responsibility of being a father. Oliver kept this fact from his son. However, Connor already learned the truth years ago from his mother, and has already forgiven him without Oliver's knowledge. ===\\"One Year Later\\"=== During the 2006 \\"One Year Later\\" storyline, Connor is revealed, to be on an island with Mia Dearden and Oliver Queen as Oliver trains for his return to Star City.Teen Titans vol. 3, #34 (2006). DC Comics. In November 2006, Connor starred in his own six issue miniseries, entitled Connor Hawke: Dragon's Blood. It was written by Chuck Dixon with art by Derec Donovan. Dixon stated, \\"A big surprise leads to major changes in Connor's life, particularly as it relates to his father.\\"Wizard #177 At the end of Tony Bedard's Black Canary miniseries, Connor takes Dinah's adoptive daughter Sin to a safe location at Oliver's request. After the wedding of Oliver and Black Canary, Connor resumes the mantle of Green Arrow after it is believed that his father has once more been killed. Along with Dinah and Batman, Connor is one of the few people who believes that Oliver is still alive. His suspicions are confirmed when it is revealed that Oliver is being held captive by the Amazons, and Connor and Dinah decide to stage a rescue attempt.Green Arrow/Black Canary #2 (January 2008). DC Comics. Following the rescue of Oliver, as the family is reunited, Connor is shot through the chest by League of Assassins members manipulated by Shado.Green Arrow/Black Canary #3 (February 2008). DC Comics.Green Arrow/Black Canary #11 (October 2008). DC Comics. After taking Connor to the hospital, Oliver learns from Mia that Connor already knew of his father's abandonment. The doctors and Hal Jordan are able to save his life, but the bullet was coated with a devastating toxin, leaving Connor in a persistent vegetative state from which he may never emerge. Oliver is devastated by the knowledge that his son may never wake up and that Connor had forgiven him years ago. He vows never to leave his son again.Green Arrow/Black Canary #4 (March 2008). DC Comics. However, after Oliver and Dinah return home from getting married (the first marriage being void, with an imposter posing as Oliver), the nurses tending to Connor are found dead, with Connor himself missing. Oliver begins a quest to find his missing son.Green Arrow/Black Canary #5 (April 2008). DC Comics. This quest leads him to Doctor Sivana, who has utilized a neural patch to turn Connor into a mindless drone. Connor is rescued by Oliver and returned to his hospital bed, where he finally awakens from his comatose state.Green Arrow/Black Canary #12 (November 2008). DC Comics. After his coma, however, Connor starts exhibiting several unusual traits. Physically healthy, he's now amnesiac and oblivious to everything happened to him before waking up (even his life as a superhero) and he feels no pain at all and exhibits a strong healing factor, forcing Dinah to ask for outside help.Green Arrow/Black Canary #13 (December 2008). DC Comics. A brief examination of his physical make-up, made by Batman and Doctor Mid-Nite, reveals how his DNA is now spliced with Plastic Man's, along with several other alterations fully accounting for his new healing factor and his currently very high pain threshold. His memories however come back only in a fragmentary, confused way, with none of the emotional attachments previously experienced, and his archery prowess was absent. To make up for his inability to use ranged weaponry Connor retains his mastery of the martial arts, enhanced by his advanced healing factor, able to close up bullet wounds in mere seconds.Green Arrow/Black Canary #14 (January 2009). DC Comics. ===\\"Blackest Night\\" and return=== During the 2009–2010 \\"Blackest Night\\" storyline, Connor travels to Coast City and faces Oliver after he has been transformed into a Black Lantern by Nekron. Connor once again takes the mantle of Green Arrow. During their battle, Oliver mocks Connor by telling him that he always hated him because he reminded him of how old he was getting. Connor is hesitant to fight his father, but eventually stops him by spraying him with liquid nitrogen, freezing him solid. After Oliver's defeat, Connor, Mia, and Dinah join in the fight against the other Black Lanterns.Green Arrow/Black Canary #30 (April 2010). DC Comics. After this, Connor returns to the ruins of Star City (which had been destroyed just prior to Blackest Night) and tries to help maintain order. Connor is approached by Oliver, now a fugitive after having murdered Prometheus, the villain that destroyed the city in the first place. Oliver tries to talk to his son, but Connor angrily states that his battle with his Black Lantern father somehow jogged his memory, and that he now remembers all the terrible things Oliver had done to him. When Oliver tells Connor that he had thought he had forgiven him, Connor states that he no longer has the strength to forgive him for his transgressions. Though he refuses to turn Oliver over to the Justice League, he also refuses to help him, instead telling him to do the right thing for once in his life.Green Arrow/Black Canary #31 (May 2010). DC Comics. ===The New 52=== Following DC Comics' 2011 reboot of its continuity, The New 52, Green Arrow stories reverted to depicting a young Oliver Queen, with no known son. ==Ethnicity== Connor is of mixed Asian, African, and European heritage (his mother was half black and half Korean, and his father Oliver is white), and was originally depicted with Asiatic features, dark skin, and fair hair and eyes. However, this has not been consistently maintained across different artists and colorists, and when the Green Arrow series was rebooted the character was depicted with European features and light skin (even though a childhood picture in the later Archer's Quest storyline depicted him with dark skin). Connor's original features were later restored with Dixon's Dragon Blood miniseries. He now appears to have a mix of Asian and African facial features. The Earth 2 version of Connor Hawke in the New 52 resembles Roy Harper more than his pre-\\"Flashpoint\\" counterpart, with light skin and red hair. ==Parentage confusion== There's been confusion as to the identity of Connor's mother. Throughout the later issues of the first Green Arrow series written by Chuck Dixon, Connor's mother was identified as Sandra \\"Moonday\\" Hawke; a flighty ex-hippie, who had reportedly been one of many conquests for a young Oliver Queen. Moonday played a frequent supporting role in the series, often requiring rescue due to the machinations of her husband - an arms dealer named Milo Armitage, who would be a frequent foe of the new Green Arrow. Shado, a murderer who also mothered a child with Oliver Queen, is often identified as Connor Hawke's mother. One reason for this is because of a Wizard Magazine issue, which identified Connor's first appearance in comics being in Green Arrow vol. 2 #24. While this was the first appearance of Shado's infant son (who was later revealed to be named Robert), Connor appeared as a man in his early-twenties in Green Arrow vol. 2 #0. Both Robert and Connor were seen together, many years apart in age, in Chuck Dixon's 2007 Dragon's Blood miniseries. Furthermore, in Birds of Prey #109, in which Barbara Gordon identifies Shado as Connor Hawke's mother when running down a list of women with whom Oliver Queen cheated on long-time girlfriend Dinah Lance. Writer Tony Bedard acknowledged this as an error on his part. ==Powers and abilities== Connor possesses no powers, he is merely an expert archer (although not the natural his father is). Due to his influence most of the \\"arrow team\\" has begun to use regular pointed arrows consistently. However, they will still engage in use of trick arrows when needed. Due to Connor's training in the ashram, he can mimic fighting styles that he witnesses, though this is a learned skill and not a metahuman power. Writer Chuck Dixon used the Brotherhood of the Fist storyline to establish Connor as being among the best hand-to-hand combatants in the world, even going so far as to fight Richard Dragon to a standstill, in a battle for the title of the World's Deadliest Martial Artist, only losing to Lady Shiva. One Year After Infinite Crisis, Connor furthered his training, and like his father and Mia, is able to wield a sword proficiently. According to the 2007 miniseries, Connor Hawke: Dragon's Blood, Connor has possibly received some measure of immortality, enhanced strength, and speed by bathing in the blood of a dragon. However, no mention of this has been made since the miniseries. After the events told in the Green Arrow and Black Canary 2008 series, Connor is infected with a brain-damaging neurotoxin and spliced with DNA coming from Plastic Man and other still unnamed sources; as a result, he's left largely amnesiac and unable to wield a bow with the necessary ability and coordination, but he's granted a highly effective healing factor and an even higher pain threshold. His martial arts mastery however is not influenced by his brain damage: in fact, coupled with his newly discovered metahuman powers, this makes him a feared warrior, almost unable to be deterred by pain and wounds. During the battle with Oliver during the Blackest Night, Connor is shown to be very proficient in the use of Japanese shuriken. After the Blackest Night, Connor regained his memories. ==Other versionsDC Animated Universe Comics=== Connor Hawke appears in Adventures in the DC Universe #13 and #16. ===Earth-16=== The Earth-16 version of the character appears in The Multiversity: The Just #1 (December, 2014). He is son of Oliver Queen and the father of Arrowette. He is a member of Justice League. ===Injustice=== In the tie-in comic for Injustice: Gods Among Us, Black Canary names her and Oliver's son Connor. Doctor Fate brought both Black Canary and her son to a parallel universe following Green Arrow's death, where the former's counterpart has long died and its Oliver Queen has retired his role as Green Arrow and becomes a recluse. After meeting the Black Canary, the alternate Oliver decides to raise Connor as his son with the baby's mother. In Injustice 2, Black Canary, Prime Earth Green Arrow, and Connor are revealed to have returned to Connor and Dinah's original universe after the fall of Superman's Regime after the Prime Earth Superman defeated his corrupted counterpart. Black Canary and Prime Earth Green Arrow assist Batman in fighting crime and rebuilding the world; the young Connor displays an excellent marksmanship like his late-father under Prime Earth Green Arrow's tutelage and having his mother's metahuman power. ===Earth 2=== In 2011, \\"The New 52\\" rebooted the DC universe. A revised interpretation of Connor Hawke appears in the series Earth 2, which is set in an alternative universe within the DC Comics Multiverse. In Earth 2 Annual #1, an archer named Red Arrow debuts and is recruited to join the World Army; he is believed to be identified by the name Roy McQueen.Earth 2 Annual #1. DC Comics. It is revealed that his name is Connor Hawke.Earth 2 #20. DC Comics. This version of Connor is seemingly killed by monsters unleashed by the invading forces of the planet Apokolips.Earth 2 #24. DC Comics. The series The New 52: Futures End shows a successor Earth 2 Red Arrow to be Oliver Queen. ==In other mediaTelevision==Arrowverse==== Joseph David-Jones as Earth-16 John Diggle, Jr./ Green Arrow in Legends of Tomorrow * A character known as \\"Connor Hawke\\" appeared in the Legends of Tomorrow season one episodes \\"Fail-Safe\\" and \\"Star City 2046\\", portrayed by Joseph David-Jones. He is the Earth-16 version of John Diggle, Jr and the son of John Diggle's Earth-16 counterpart. He appears as Green Arrow in Star City. Blaming himself for his father's death, he feels undeserving of his name and instead takes on the alias Connor Hawke. He becomes the new Green Arrow after he believes Earth-16 Oliver had died, and tries to defend the city from the new Deathstroke, Earth-16 Grant Wilson. After defeating Deathstroke together, he and Oliver partner to rebuild Star City. In the crossover \\"Crisis on Infinite Earths\\", it is retroactively established that this reality is not the future of Earth-1 but Earth-16's. * Arrow's season seven introduces flashforwards that take place in 2040 and feature Connor Hawke, once again played by Joseph David-Jones. However, this version is not John Diggle, Jr., but the son of Ben Turner, later adopted by John Diggle and Lyla Michaels. He is an agent of Knightwatch, who are described as a \\"good version of A.R.G.U.S.\\", and works alongside Mia Smoak, the daughter of Oliver and Felicity. The eighth season reveals that Connor Hawke has an estranged brother named John Diggle Jr. (portrayed by Charlie Barnett) who is the leader of the Deathstroke Gang. * In Arrow, Oliver fathered his illegitimate son, William Clayton, with his college classmate Samantha Clayton. The character is later introduced in its spin-off The Flash, as a preadolescent portrayed by Jack Moore. After Samantha's death, Oliver takes his son in, providing William a family after he marries Felicity Smoak. The season seven flashforwards feature an adult William (played by Ben Lewis) teaming up with a group of vigilantes, including his half-sister Mia, to save Star City from the Galaxy One company. The adult William is shown to be openly gay, the fact that his father and stepmother have known for years since he was a teenager. ===Video games=== * A character named Connor Lance-Queen appeared in Injustice 2. He is the son of Green Arrow and Black Canary. He and his parents go back to their original world so Black Canary and Green Arrow can assist Batman with Connor being taken care of by a babysitter while his parents are off fighting the Society and Brainiac's forces. In Black Canary's single player ending, she discovers that Connor has inherited her sonic scream, allowing him to fight off the Brainiac forces attacking him indicating he is a Metahuman like his mother. Connor also makes a cameo appearance in Harley Quinn's Ending, where he is shown in the background with his parents as Harley is spending time with her daughter Lucy (under the guise as Lucy's aunt as Lucy is unaware that Harley is her biological mother). ==References== Category:Characters created by Jim Aparo Category:Characters created by Kelley Puckett Category:Comics characters introduced in 1994 Category:DC Comics characters with accelerated healing Category:DC Comics martial artists Category:DC Comics metahumans Category:African-American superheroes Category:Asian-American superheroes Category:Fictional archers Category:Fictional characters from California Category:Buddhism in comics ","title":"Green Arrow (Connor Hawke)"},{"id":"1999013","text":"resident of Banyumas c. 1905 Train at Banjoemas (Banyumas) Banyumas (, formerly spelt \\"Banjoemas\\", Sundanese: ᮘᮑᮥᮙᮞ᮪) Regency is a regency () in the southwestern part of Central Java province in Indonesia.

A damper is a valve or plate that stops or regulates the flow of air inside a duct, chimney, VAV box, air handler, or other air-handling equipment. A damper may be used to cut off central air conditioning (heating or cooling) to an unused room, or to regulate it for room-by-room temperature and climate control. Its operation can be manual or automatic. Manual dampers are turned by a handle on the outside of a duct. Automatic dampers are used to regulate airflow constantly and are operated by electric or pneumatic motors, in turn controlled by a thermostat or building automation system. Automatic or motorized dampers may also be controlled by a solenoid, and the degree of air-flow calibrated, perhaps according to signals from the thermostat going to the actuator of the damper in order to modulate the flow of air-conditioned air in order to effect climate control.What are Dampers? In a chimney flue, a damper closes off the flue to keep the weather (and birds and other animals) out and warm or cool air in. This is usually done in the summer, but also sometimes in the winter between uses. In some cases, the damper may also be partly closed to help control the rate of combustion. The damper may be accessible only by reaching up into the fireplace by hand or with a woodpoker, or sometimes by a lever or knob that sticks down or out. On a wood-burning stove or similar device, it is usually a handle on the vent duct as in an air conditioning system. Forgetting to open a damper before beginning a fire can cause serious smoke damage to the interior of a home, if not a house fire. == Automated zone dampers == An opposed-blade, motor-closed, motor-opened zone damper. The damper is shown in the \\"open\\" position. Close-up of the motor connections. This damper can switch the electrical power to control additional \\"slave\\" dampers, minimizing the electrical load on the damper's control circuitry and power transformer A zone damper (also known as a Volume Control Damper or VCD) is a specific type of damper used to control the flow of air in an HVAC heating or cooling system. In order to improve efficiency and occupant comfort, HVAC systems are commonly divided up into multiple zones. For example, in a house, the main floor may be served by one heating zone while the upstairs bedrooms are served by another. In this way, the heat can be directed principally to the main floor during the day and principally to the bedrooms at night, allowing the unoccupied areas to cool down. Zone dampers as used in home HVAC systems are usually electrically powered. In large commercial installations, vacuum or compressed air may be used instead. In either case, the motor is usually connected to the damper via a mechanical coupling. For electrical zone dampers, there are two principal designs. In one design, the motor is often a small shaded-pole synchronous motor combined with a rotary switch that can disconnect the motor at either of the two stopping points (\\"damper open\\" or \\"damper closed\\"). In this way, applying power to the \\"open damper\\" terminal causes the motor to run until the damper is open while applying power at the \\"close damper\\" terminal causes the motor to run until the damper is closed. The motor is commonly powered from the same 24 volt AC power source that is used for the rest of the control system. This allows the zone dampers to be directly controlled by low-voltage thermostats and wired with low-voltage wiring. Because simultaneous closure of all dampers might harm the furnace or air handler, this style of damper is often designed to only obstruct a portion of the air duct, for example, 75%. Another style of electrically powered damper uses a spring-return mechanism and a shaded-pole synchronous motor. In this case, the damper is normally opened by the force of the spring but can be closed by the force of the motor. Removal of electrical power re-opens the damper. This style of damper is advantageous because it is \\"fail safe\\"; if the control to the damper fails, the damper opens and allows air to flow. However, in most applications \\"fail safe\\" indicates the damper will close upon loss of power thus preventing the spread of smoke and fire to other areas. These dampers also may allow adjustment of the \\"closed\\" position so that they only obstruct, for example, 75% of the air flow when closed. For vacuum-operated or pneumatically operated zone dampers, the thermostat usually switches the pressure or vacuum on or off, causing a spring-loaded rubber diaphragm to move and actuate the damper. As with the second style of electrical zone dampers, these dampers automatically return to the default position without the application of any power, and the default position is usually \\"open\\", allowing air to flow. Like the second style of electrical zone damper, these dampers may allow adjustment of the \\"closed\\" position. Highly sophisticated systems may use some form of building automation such as BACnet or LonWorks to control the zone dampers. The dampers may also support positions other than fully open or fully closed and are usually capable of reporting their current position and, often, the temperature and volume of the air flowing past the smart damper. Regardless of the style of damper employed, the systems are often designed so that when no thermostat is calling for air, all dampers in the system are opened. This allows air to continue to flow while the heat exchanger in a furnace cools down after a heating period completes. === Comparison to multiple furnaces/air handlers === Multiple zones can be implemented using either multiple, individually controlled furnaces/air handlers or a single furnace/air handler and multiple zone dampers. Each approach has advantages and disadvantages. === Multiple furnaces/air handlers === Advantages: * Simple mechanical and control design (\\"SPST thermostats\\") * Redundancy: If one zone furnace fails, the others can remain working Disadvantages: * Cost. Furnaces cost much more than zone dampers * Power consumption. Operating furnaces draw power whereas a zone damper only draws power while in motion from one state to the other (or, in some cases, a very small amount of power while holding closed) === Zone dampers === Advantages: * Cost. * Power consumption. Disadvantages: * New US residential building codes require permanent access to dampers through ceiling access panels. * Zone dampers are not 100% reliable. Most styles of motor-to- open/motor-to-closed electrically operated zone dampers aren't \\"fail safe\\" (that is, they do not fail to the open condition). However, zone dampers that are of the \\"Normally Open\\" type are fail-safe, in that they will fail to the open condition. * No inherent redundancy for the furnace. A system with zone dampers is dependent upon a single furnace. If it fails, the system becomes completely inoperable. * Low total flow when only some dampers are open can cause inefficient operation. * Supply and return ducts need dampers to avoid pressurization of portions of the building. * The system can be harder to a design, requiring both \\"SPDT\\" thermostats (or relays) and the ability of the system to withstand the fault condition whereby all zone dampers are closed simultaneously. Pneumatic actuation is preferred for these dampers. It is easier to provide zone-classified solenoid valves for pneumatic actuation, as compared to electrical actuation. The physical size of such solenoid valves have come down very considerably over the years. ==Fire dampers== Fire dampers are fitted where ductwork passes through fire compartment walls and fire curtains as part of a fire control strategy. In normal circumstances, these dampers are held open by means of fusible links. When subjected to heat, these links fracture and allow the damper to close under the influence of the integral closing spring. The links are attached to the damper such that the dampers can be released manually for testing purposes. The damper is provided with an access door in the adjacent ductworks for the purpose of inspection and resetting in the event of closure. == See also == * Zone valve * Variable air volume (VAV) * Testing, adjusting, balancing * Air-mixing plenum ==ReferencesExternal links== Category:Heating, ventilating, and air conditioning Category:Mechanical engineering ","title":"Damper (flow)"},{"id":"1999038","text":"The intermediate disturbance hypothesis (IDH) suggests that local species diversity is maximized when ecological disturbance is neither too rare nor too frequent. At low levels of disturbance, more competitive organisms will push subordinate species to extinction and dominate the ecosystem. At high levels of disturbance, due to frequent forest fires or human impacts like deforestation, all species are at risk of going extinct. According to IDH theory, at intermediate levels of disturbance, diversity is thus maximized because species that thrive at both early and late successional stages can coexist. IDH is a nonequilibrium model used to describe the relationship between disturbance and species diversity. IDH is based on the following premises: First, ecological disturbances have major effects on species richness within the area of disturbance. Second, interspecific competition results from one species driving a competitor to extinction and becoming dominant in the ecosystem. Third, moderate ecological scale disturbances prevent interspecific competition. Graph shows principles of intermediate disturbance hypothesis: I. at low levels of ecological disturbance species richness decreases as competitive exclusion increases, II. at intermediate levels of disturbance, diversity is maximized because species that thrive at both early and late successional stages can coexist, III. at high levels of disturbance species richness is decreased due an increase in species movement. Disturbances act to disrupt stable ecosystems and clear species' habitat. As a result, disturbances lead to species movement into the newly cleared area. Once an area is cleared there is a progressive increase in species richness and competition takes place again. Once disturbance is removed, species richness decreases as competitive exclusion increases. \\"Gause's Law\\", also known as competitive exclusion, explains how species that compete for the same resources cannot coexist in the same niche. Each species handles change from a disturbance differently; therefore, IDH can be described as both \\"broad in description and rich in detail\\". The broad IDH model can be broken down into smaller divisions which include spatial within-patch scales, spatial between- patch scales, and purely temporal models. Each subdivision within this theory generates similar explanations for the coexistence of species with habitat disturbance. Joseph H. Connell proposed that relatively low disturbance leads to decreased diversity and high disturbance causes an increase in species movement. These proposed relationships lead to the hypothesis that intermediate disturbance levels would be the optimal amount of disorder within an ecosystem. Once K-selected and r-selected species can live in the same region, species richness can reach its maximum. The main difference between both types of species is their growth and reproduction rate. These characteristics attribute to the species that thrive in habitats with higher and lower amounts of disturbance. K-selected species generally demonstrate more competitive traits. Their primary investment of resources is directed towards growth, causing them to dominate stable ecosystems over a long period of time; an example of K-selected species the African elephant, which is prone to extinction because of their long generation times and low reproductive rates. In contrast, r-selected species colonize open areas quickly and can dominate landscapes that have been recently cleared by disturbance. An ideal examples of r-selected groups are algae. Based on the contradictory characteristics of both of these examples, areas of occasional disturbance allow both r and K species to benefit by residing in the same area. The ecological effect on species relationships is therefore supported by the intermediate disturbance hypothesis. Disturbed vegetation due to milpa farming. Cayo District, Belize. [Macrae 2008]. ==History== David Wilkinson gives a thorough history of the hypothesis in his paper titled, \\"The disturbing history of the intermediate disturbance\\". In this paper, he explains that the idea of disturbance relating to species richness can be traced back to the 1940s in Eggeling 1947, Watt 1947, and Tansley 1949. Though studies supporting the hypothesis began in the 1960s, the first concrete statements of the intermediate disturbance hypothesis didn't occur until the 1970s. The hypothesis was initially illustrated using what has been referred to as a \\"hump-backed model\\", which graphed the proposed relationship between diversity and disturbance. This graph appeared first in Grime's 'Competitive exclusion in herbaceous vegetation' where it was used to show the relationship between species density and both environmental stress and intensity of management. The graph appears again in Horn's 'Markovian properties of forest succession' and Connell's 'The influence of interspecific competition and other factors on the distribution of the barnacle'. Though Grime was the first to provide a model for the relationship and Horn was the first to explicitly state the hypothesis, Connell is generally cited in text books and journals as the founder of the hypothesis. The hypothesis caused concern among the marine science community because of the discrepancy with the 1976 Competition/Predation/Disturbance model proposed by Menge and Sutherland In this model, low disturbance influences high predation and high disturbance creates low predation, causing competitive exclusion to take place. Menge & Sutherland formulated a new model, one that incorporated Connell's ideas in a two part graph published in The American Naturalist (1987). This model proposes that predation, competition, and disturbance are all responsible for shaping the diversity of a community under certain circumstances. Research regarding the effects of intermediate disturbance is ongoing. More recently, the intermediate disturbance hypothesis has been examined in marine and freshwater ecosystems and protist microcosms. ==Support and critiques== Debates over the validity of the IDH are ongoing within the discipline of tropical ecology as the theory is tested in various ecological communities. Other evidence exists for and against the hypothesis. The intermediate disturbance hypothesis has been supported by several studies involving marine habitats such as coral reefs and macroalgal communities. In shallow coastal waters off of south-west Western Australia, a study was conducted to determine whether or not the extremely high diversity observed in macroalgal communities was due to disturbance from waves. Using a numerical wave model to estimate the forces caused by waves, researchers were able to determine that there was a significant relationship between species diversity and disturbance index; this is consistent with the intermediate disturbance hypothesis. Furthermore, diversity was lower at exposed offshore sites where disturbance from waves was highest, and at extremely sheltered site where disturbance from waves was minimized. The study provided evidence that biodiversity in microalgal reef communities possess some relationship with their proximity to the outer edge of lagoon systems typical of the Western Australian coast. While this study may have been localized to the Western Australian coast, it still provides some evidence to support the validity of the IDH. Additionally, a study done in the Virgin Islands National Park found that species diversity, in some locations, of shallow coral reefs increased after infrequent hurricane disturbance. In 1982, reefs in Kona, Hawaii were reported to have an increase in diversity after a moderate storm, although the effects of the storm varied with the reef zones. In 1980, Hurricane Allen increased species diversity in shallow zones of the Discovery Bay Reef in Jamaica because the more dominant corals were reduced; giving the other types a chance to propagate following the disturbance. Similar findings have been reported in shallow reefs in which dominant species of coral have suffered more damage than the less common species. While more long-term studies are required to completely support the Intermediate Disturbance Hypothesis, the studies that have been conducted thus far have proven that IDH does have some validity while attempting to describe the relationship between diversity and the rate of occurrences of disturbance in an area. Even though the IDH was designed for species-rich environments, like tropical rainforests, \\"most studies that evaluate the IDH are based on limited data with: few species, a limited range of disturbance and/or only a small geographic area, compared with the scale of interest\\". In this experiment, Bongers, Poorter, Hawthorne, and Sheil evaluate the IDH on a larger scale and compare different tropical forest types in Ghana. Their dataset consisted of 2504 one-hectare plots with a total of 331,567 trees. These plots were divided classified into three forest types: wet (446 plots), moist (1322 plots), and dry forest (736 plots). They found that diversity does peak at intermediate level of disturbance but little variation is explained outside dry forests. Therefore, disturbance is less important for species diversity patterns in wet tropical rain forests than previously thought. The number of species was about the same for each forest type, and wet forests had only slightly fewer pioneer species, slightly more shade-tolerant and an equal number of pioneer light-demanders compared with the moist and dry forests. Their results generally supported the IDH as an explanation of why diversity varies across sites, but concluded that disturbance is less important for species richness patterns in wet tropical rain forests than previously thought. IDH has been subject to criticism since its inception but not to the degree that other species density hypotheses have been. Recently there has been a call for a critical reassessment of IDH. Criticisms have focused on the increasing amount of empirical data that disagrees with IDH. This can be found within approximately 80% of over 100 reviewed studies that are examining the predicted peak of diversity in intermediate disturbance levels. The rationales behind these discrepancies have been leveled at the simplicity of IDH and its inability to grasp the complexity found within the spatial and intensity aspects of disturbance relationships. In addition, many IDH proven circumstances have been suggested to be a reflection of skewed research methods based on researchers looking for humped diversity-disturbance relations only in systems where they believed it has occurred. Other criticisms are suggesting several subtle theoretical issues with IDH. First, while disturbances weaken competition by reducing species densities and per- capita growth rates, it also reduces the strength of competition needed to push per capita growth into a negative territory and reduce density to zero. Second, intermediate disturbances slow competitive exclusion by increasing the long-term average mortality rate, and thereby reducing the differences in the average growth rates of competing species. The difference in the growth rates between competitively superior and inferior species determines the rates of competitive exclusion; therefore intermediate disturbances are affecting species' abundance but not coexistence. Third, intermediate disturbances temporarily affect relative species fitness. However, no matter what the rate of disturbance is, the species with favored fitness will out-compete the rest of the species. Several alternative hypotheses have been proposed. One example is by Denslow, who states that the species diversity in a disturbance-mediated coexistence between species is maximized by the presence of a disturbance regime resembling the historic processes. This is because species generally adapt to the level of disturbance in their ecosystem through evolution (whether disturbance is of high, intermediate or low level). Many species (e.g. ruderal plants and fire-adapted species) even depend on disturbance in ecosystems where it often occurs.

It is also used on turf on golf courses. Two common fungi that vinclozolin is used to protect crops against are Botrytis cinerea and Sclerotinia sclerotiorum. First registered in 1981, vinclozolin is widely used but its overall application has declined. As a pesticide, vinclozolin is regulated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA). In addition to these restrictions within the United States, as of 2006 the use of this pesticide was banned in several countries, including Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden. It has gone through a series of tests and regulations in order to evaluate the risks and hazards to the environment and animals. Among the research, a main finding is that vinclozolin has been shown to be an endocrine disruptor with antiandrogenic effects. ==Use in the United States== Vinclozolin is manufactured by the chemical company BASF and has been registered for use in the United States since 1981. The following is a compilation of data indicating the national use of vinclozolin per crop (lbs AI/yr) in 1987: apricots, 124; cherries, 3,301; green beans, 13,437; lettuce, 24,779; nectarines, 1,449; onions, 829; peaches, 15,203; plums, 163; raspberries, 3,247; and strawberries, 41,006. In 1997, two applications totaling 285 pounds each, were applied to kiwifruit in California to prevent the gray mold and soft rot caused by Botrytis cinerea. In general, the United States has seen an overall decline in the national use of vinclozolin. In 1992, a total of approximately 135,000 pounds were used. However, in 1997 this number dropped to 122,000 and in 2002 it was down to 55,000 pounds. == Preparation and application== The following chemical reactions are used to make vinclozolin:Franz Müller, Peter Ackermann and Paul Margot \\"Fungicides, Agricultural, 2. Individual Fungicides\\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. One method combines methyl vinyl ketone, sodium cyanide, 3,5-dichloroaniline, and phosgene. This process involves formation of the cyanohydrin, followed by hydrolysis of the nitrile. Vinclozolin is also prepared by the reaction of 3,5-dichlorophenyl isocyanate with an alkyl ester of 2-hydroxy-2-vinylpropionic acid. Ring closure is achieved at elevated temperature. Vinclozolin is then formulated into a dry flowable or extruded granular. It can be applied by through the air (aerial), through irrigation systems (chemigation), or by ground equipment. Vinclozolin is also applied to some plants, such as decorative flowers, as a dip treatment where the plant is dipped into the fungicide solution and then dried. It is also common to spray a vinclozolin solution using thermal foggers in greenhouses. == History of regulations in the US == All pesticides sold or distributed in the United States must be registered by U.S. EPA. Pesticides that were first registered before November 1, 1984, were reregistered so that they can be retested using the now more advanced methods. Because vinclozolin was released in 1981, it has gone through both preliminary and a subsequent reregistration. Below is a list of the history of regulations for vinclozolin: *A Data Call-In (DCI), requiring data on product and residue chemistry, toxicity, environmental fate, and ecological effects, have been requested in 1991, 1995 and 1996. *Agricultural Data Call-In (AGDCI), to estimate what happens to workers after they apply the fungicide, was issued in 1995. *In April 1997, BASF proposed a new use for vinclozolin and thus all risks were reevaluated under the Food Quality Protection Act (FQPA). *In June 1998 the EPA put a new safety factor on vinclozolin. BASF voluntarily cancelled vinclozolin use on some fruits and turf. *On July 18, 2000 the EPA established that certain meat, bean and dairy products have a 3-year time-limited tolerances for vinclozolin and its metabolites. This led to a phase-out of most domestic food uses for vinclozolin. In September 2000, the EPA received objections to the issued tolerance for beans. *Other measures that BASF has taken to reduce risks: cancel use on decorative plants and set up new restrictions on turf which state that the application to turf restricted to golf courses and industrial sites. *BASF has proposed to immediately eliminate or phase-out uses such that only use on canola and turf will remain after 2004. == Means of exposure == The U.S. EPA has examined dietary (food and water), non-dietary, and occupational exposure to vinclozolin or its metabolites. In general, fungicides have been shown to circulate through the water and air, and it possible for them to end up on untreated foods after application. Consumers alone cannot easily reduce their exposure because fungicides are not removed from produce that is washed with tap water. A key example of exposure to vinclozolin is through wine grapes which is considered to account for about 2% of total vinclozolin exposure. It has been determined that people may be exposed to residues of vinclozolin and its metabolites containing the 3,5-dichloroaniline moiety (3,5-DCA) through diet, and thus tolerance limits have been established for each crop. Although vinclozolin is not registered for use by homeowners, it is still possible for people to come into contact with the fungicide and its residues. For example, golfers playing on treated golf courses, and families playing on sod which has been previously treated may be at risk for exposure. Occupationally, workers can be exposed to vinclozolin while doing activities such as loading and mixing. == Environmental and health impacts  Antiandrogen === As part of the reregistration process, the U.S. EPA reviewed all toxicity studies on vinclozolin. The main effect induced by vinclozolin is related to its antiandrogenic activity and its ability to act as a competitive antagonist of the androgen receptor. Vinclozolin can mimic male hormones, like testosterone, and bind to androgen receptors, while not necessarily activating those receptors properly. There is evidence that vinclozolin itself binds weakly to the androgen receptor but that at least two of its metabolites are responsible for much of the antiandrogenic activity. When male rats were given low dose levels (>3 mg/kg/day) of vinclozolin, effects such as decreased prostate weight, weight reduction in sex organs, nipple development, and decreased ano- genital distance were noted. At higher dose levels, male sex organ weight decreased further, and sex organ malformations were seen, such as reduced penis size, the appearance of vaginal pouches and hypospadias. In the rat model, it has been shown that the antiandorgenic effects of vinclozolin are most prominent during the developmental stages. In utero, this sensitive period of fetal development occurs between gestation days 16-17. Embryonic exposure to vinclozolin can influence sexual differentiation, gonadal formation, and reproductive functions. In bird models, vinclozolin and its metabolites were shown in vitro and in vivo to inhibit androgen receptor binding and gene expression. Vinclozolin caused reduced egg laying, reduced fertility rate, and a reduction in successful hatches. Androgens also play a role in puberty, and it has been shown an antiandrogen like vinclozolin can delay pubertal maturation. Antiandrogenic toxins are also known to alter sexual differentiation and reproduction in the rabbit model. Male rabbits exposed to vinclozolin in utero or during infancy did not show a sexual interest in females or did not ejaculate. Since the androgen receptor is widely conserved across species lines, antiandrogenic effects would be expected in humans. In vertebrates, vinclozolin also acts as a neuroendocrine disruptor, affecting behaviors tied to locomotion, cognition, and anxiety. ===Progesterone and estrogen effects in rats=== In rats, vinclozolin has been shown to affect other steroid hormone receptors, such as those of progesterone and estrogen. Just as with androgens, the timing of the exposure to vinclozolin determines the magnitude of the effects related to these hormones. In a study with rats, in vitro research showed the ability of two vinclozolin metabolites to bind to the progesterone receptor. However, the same study in vivo using adult male rats showed no effects. When mice experienced vinclozolin exposure in utero, male offspring exhibited up-regulated estrogen receptor and up-regulated progesterone receptor. In females, vinclozolin down- regulated expression of estrogen receptors and up-regulated progesterone receptor expression. This result causes virilization and the feminization of males and masculinization of females. ===Transgenerational effects=== In rats, vinclozolin has been demonstrated to have trangenerational effects, meaning that not only is the initial animal affected, but effects are also seen in subsequent generations. One study demonstrated that vinclozolin impaired male fertility not only in the first generation that was exposed in utero, but in males born for three generations and beyond. Furthermore, when affected males with were mated with normal females, some of the offspring were sterile and some had reduced fertility. After three generations, male offspring continued to show low sperm count, prostate disease and high rates of testicular cell apoptosis., Other studies conducted experiments where rat embryos were exposed to vinclozolin during sex determination. F1 (first generation) vinclozolin treated males were bred with F1 vinclozolin treated females. This pattern continued for three generations. The initial F0 mother was the only subject that was directly exposed to doses of vinclozolin. F1-F4 generation males all showed an increase in the prevalence of tumors, prostate disease, kidney disease, test abnormalities and immune failures when compared to the control group. F1-F4 females also showed an increased incidence of tumors and kidney disease. Furthermore, transgenerationally transmitted changes in mate preference and anxiety behavior have also been observed in rats following exposure to vinclozolin. It has been reported that these transgenerational reports correlate with epigenetic changes, specifically, an alteration in DNA methylation in the male germ line. However, these transgenerational changes have not been successfully reproduced by BASF scientists, the manufacturer of vinclozolin === Links to cancer === The U.S. EPA has classified vinclozolin as a possible human carcinogen. Vinclozolin induces an increase in leydig cell tumors in rats. The 3,5-DCA metabolite is thought to possess a mode of tumor induction based on its similarity to p-choroaniline. === Environment === Laboratory test indicate that vinclozolin easily breaks down and dissipates in the environment with the help of microbes. Of its several metabolites 3,5-dichloroaniline resists further degradation. In terrestrial field dissipation studies conducted in various states, vinclozolin dissipated with a half-life between 34 and 94 days. Half-lives including residues can reach up to 1,000 days. Residues may accumulate and be available for future crop uptake. == Alternative fungicides == Since the phase-out of vinclozolin, farmers are faced with fewer options to control gray and white mold. The New York State Agricultural Experiment Station has carried out efficacy trials for gray and white mold. Research has showed potential alternatives to vinclozolin. Trifloxystrobin (Flint), iprodione (Rovral), and cyprodinil plus fludioxonil (Switch) control gray mold. Thiophanate-methyl (Topsin M) was as effective as vinclozolin in controlling white molds. Switch was the most promising alternative to vinclozolin for controlling both gray and white mold on pods and for increasing marketable yield. ==ReferencesExternal links== *BBC article on Vinclozolin in rats * Category:Chloroarenes Category:Endocrine disruptors Category:Fungicides Category:Nonsteroidal antiandrogens Category:Oxazolidinediones Category:Suspected testicular toxicants Category:Vinyl compounds ","title":"Vinclozolin"},{"id":"1999048","text":"\\"Contagious\\" is a song by The Isley Brothers.

Airspace is managed by Transport Canada and detailed information regarding exact dimensions and classification is available in the Designated Airspace Handbook which is published every fifty-six days by Nav Canada. == Canadian Domestic Airspace == The \\"Canadian Domestic Airspace\\" includes all of Canada and extends out over the Pacific, Arctic, and Atlantic oceans. It is broadly divided into the \\"Northern Domestic Airspace\\" (NDA) and the \\"Southern Domestic Airspace\\" (SDA). There are three main differences between the two areas, the most important of them being that the NDA is designated as a \\"standard pressure\\" region while the SDA is an \\"altimeter setting\\" region. This means that pilots operating in the SDA will calibrate their altimeters to atmospheric pressure according to information available at airports and through weather services. Conversely, in the NDA, pilots calibrate their altimeters to regardless of the actual atmospheric pressure. This is done because weather information is not available for all areas of the far north, so it is better that all pilots use a standard setting in order to avoid collisions. Another major difference between the NDA and SDA is that magnetic declination is not used in the NDA. Because the magnetic north pole is in the NDA, magnetic declinations are very large; sometimes even 180°. This is further complicated by the fact that magnetic north moves approximately in an elliptical path every day. For these reasons, \\"true\\" tracks are always used in the NDA while magnetic tracks are frequently used in the SDA for convenience. The final difference between the NDA and the SDA has to do with the location of Class A airspace in each region. This is explained in more detail below.

Only aircraft flying in terms with Instrument Flight Rules may fly in Class A airspace. It includes, therefore, the Southern Control Area, the Northern Control Area FL230 and above and the Arctic Control Area FL270 and above. It may also include any other airspace so designated by the Minister on either a permanent or temporary basis. ** For entry into Class A airspace, an aircraft needs a functional Mode C transponder and an IFR clearance. * Class B airspace is any controlled airspace between and Occasionally, Class B airspace exists in other locations, though this is unusual. ** For entry into Class B airspace, an aircraft needs a functional Mode C transponder and either an IFR or a CVFR (Controlled VFR) clearance. * Class C airspace is usually a control zone (CZ) for a large airport. These areas usually have a radius and a height of up to 12,500 ft above aerodrome elevation (AAE). ** For entry into a Class C control zone, an aircraft needs a functional Mode C transponder and an ATC clearance. * Class D airspace is usually a control zone for smaller airports or aerodromes that has a radius and a height of AAE. Airports in extremely busy airspace may have only a radius control zone. ** For entry into a Class D control zone, an aircraft needs to contact ATC. Some Class D control zones require transponders, and NORDO flight is not permitted at night in a Class D zone. * Class E airspace is used for low-level flight routes and for aerodromes with very little traffic. ATC is available, but is not required. Some Class D control zones change to Class E at night if the control tower shuts down. It is also high level controlled airspace above FL600. See Other Important Features Below ** Any aircraft may fly in Class E airspace. * Class F airspace is special use airspace. Any Class F zone will be designated either CYR, CYD, or CYA. CYR stands for restricted, CYD means danger (usually used for CYR areas over international waters), and CYA stands for advisory. CYA zones will also have a letter identifying the type of activity in the zone: A – aerobatics, F – aircraft testing, H – hang gliding, M – military, P – parachuting, S – soaring, T – training. ** For entry into a CYR or CYD zone, an aircraft needs the permission of the operating authority. Pilots may enter CYA zones at their discretion, but are encouraged to avoid them unless taking part in the activity. * Any airspace that is not designated is Class G airspace. This airspace is uncontrolled, and ATC is not usually available (though exceptions are made). ** Any aircraft may fly in Class G airspace. Airspace classes A through E are controlled. Class F can be controlled or uncontrolled. Class G is always uncontrolled. Airspace is managed by Transport Canada and detailed information regarding exact dimensions and classification is available in the Designated Airspace Handbook which is published every fifty-six days by NAV CANADA. == Other important features of control zones and controlled airspace == Some control zones have unique procedures because of terrain or air traffic demands. These procedures are published in the Canada Flight Supplement. From the supplement \\"Class E* All high level controlled airspace above FL600 within the SCA, NCA and ACA. Also, low level airways, low level fixed RNAV routes, CAEs, transition areas or CZs established without an operating control tower may be classified Class E airspace.\\" So uncontrolled airports like Sarnia (CYZR) and others may appear to be miss-characterized as control zones since the Canadian Air Regulations (CARs) define a CZ as \\"controlled airspace that is so specified in the Designated Airspace Handbook (DAH) and that extends upwards vertically from the surface of the earth up to and including 3,000 feet AGL, unless otherwise specified\\" in that handbook. However, this apparent conflict is resolved since the DAH is specifically authorized to define airspace classification. The CARs definition of controlled airspace is \\"...within which air traffic control service is provided;\\". So when air traffic control is not provided it appears it should not be a control zone. The DAH defines Class G airspace as \\"Airspace shall be classified G if it has not been designated A, B, C, D, E or F.\\" There is actually no definition of \\"uncontrolled airspace\\" other than that, so by inferred definition CYZR is controlled airspace below 700 ft to 5 nmi beneath a Class G, transition airspace out to 15 nmi). The 700 ft is the base of this overlaying Class E transition airspace which is controlled up to FL125. DAH also defines \\"Class B, C, D or E equivalent\\" airspace but that specifically refers MTCAs which are military terminal control areas. Bottom line is the CARs definition of CZ and controlled airspace specifically allows the DAH to further define certain \\"Class E uncontrolled airports\\" as a control zone as long as they have at least one navigation aid and an instrument approach procedure that originates in Class E transition controlled airspace. Another important feature of Canadian airspace is the air defence identification zone (ADIZ) that surrounds North America. ===Saint Pierre and Miquelon=== The terminal control areas of the French islands of Saint Pierre and Miquelon are located within Canadian airspace. They are as follows: *The class E airspace ranges from 6000 feet AGL to 12,500 feet within the area demarcated by a line beginning at and ending at , then running clockwise along a circle with a radius of 10 miles centred on . *The Control Area for Saint Pierre is the airspace to 2000 feet (2000 feet AAE) within a circle with a radius of 6 miles centred on . *The area above 12,000 feet is controlled by Nav Canada.https://web.archive.org/web/20071009233653/http://www.navcanada.ca/ContentDefinitionFiles/Publications/AeronauticalInfoProducts/DAH/DAH_current_EN.pdf == References == Category:Aviation in Canada Category:Air traffic control in North America Category:Air traffic control in Canada ","title":"Canadian airspace"},{"id":"1999087","text":"Anabell Gardoqui \\"Ana\\" de la Reguera (; born April 8, 1977) is a Mexican actress who has starred in telenovelas, films, the HBO television series Eastbound & Down and Capadocia, and the Amazon television series Goliath. ==Early life== Reguera was born in Veracruz, Mexico.

The Jackson Plan or Raffles Town Plan, an urban plan of 1822 titled \\"Plan of the Town of Singapore\\", is a proposed scheme for Singapore drawn up to maintain some order in the urban development of the fledgling but thriving colony founded just three years earlier. It was named after Lieutenant Philip Jackson, the colony's engineer and land surveyor tasked to oversee its physical development in accordance with the vision of Stamford Raffles for Singapore, hence it is also commonly called Raffles Town Plan. Raffles gave his instructions in November 1822, the plan was then drawn up in late 1822 or early 1823 and published in 1828. It is the earliest extant plan for the town of Singapore, but not an actual street map of Singapore as it existed in 1822 or 1827 since the plan is an idealised scheme of how Singapore may be organised that was not fully realised. Nevertheless, it served as a guide for the development of Singapore in its early days, and the effect of the general layout of the plan is still observable to this day. The plan is currently on display in the Singapore History Gallery at the National Museum of Singapore. ==Origin== The plan as first published by John Crawfurd in 1828 Sir Stamford Raffles founded the colony in 1819, and before he left Singapore, he wrote to William Farquhar giving instructions on how the colony may be organised. Farquhar governed Singapore from 1819 until 1823, and with limited funds, he chose a pragmatic approach to allow the colony to flourish. Under the sheer volume of trade that passed through her port, some instructions were disregarded and the town grew haphazardly. Upon his final return to colony in October 1822, Raffles was displeased by the disorderliness of the town and that Farquhar had not followed closely the instructions he gave. For example, Farquhar allowed merchants to encroach on designated government area – he permitted the erection of houses and godowns on the Padang and on the nearby banks of the Singapore River, within an area Raffles specified not to be permanently appropriated by individuals. In response, Raffles formed a Town Committee, consisting of a merchant, Alexander Laurie Johnston; a civil servant George Bonham; and Captain Charles Edward Davis of the Bengal Native Infantry, who acted as president of the committee. They were assisted by Lieutenant Philip Jackson who drew up the layout plan of the city according to Raffles' instructions. ===Raffles' instructions=== Raffles issued his set of instructions to the committee on 4 November 1822, some of which are as follows: # The area between the Old Lines (a ruined city wall of ancient Singapore still visible in Raffles' time, roughly where Stamford Road now lies) and the Singapore River including a space up to 200 yard east of the Old Lines (i.e. up to where Bras Basah Road is now located) would be reserved for government use. # The European area would be located to the east of the cantonment (the government area) as far as the ground that belonged to the Sultan. The area of the cantonment facing the sea and area southwest of the river between Circular Road and Telok Ayer Bay would be used for commerce by European and other merchants. # Raffles expected that the Chinese would form the largest community, a large area south west of the Singapore River was therefore reserved for the Chinese except for the area intended for commercial use. The Indians would be settled further up the river. # The Bugis (who had already settled in Kampong Glam to the mouth of the Rochor River) and the Arabs were to be allocated areas next to the Sultan's ground. Raffles did not believe that there would be large number of Malay settlers, but thought that they may settle at the upper banks of the river, small bays and inlets. # The sea front would be reserved for public purposes. # In addition to allocating land, Raffles also gave other suggestions, for example where the market should be moved to (this became the Telok Ayer Market), and that burial grounds should be placed some distance away from the town. Raffles also stipulated that the streets and buildings should be arranged in a uniform and regular manner, for example the streets should have a minimum width and intersect at right angle, and that there should be an exact number of houses on each street. His recommendations included the material as well as features of the buildings. Raffles' instructions were incorporated into the plan, although not all of these were implemented. The committee consulted representatives from the Malay, Chinese, Bugis, Javanese, and Arab communities on the proposed resettlement of the population into their respective areas. The plan was drawn up some time in December 1822 or January 1823, and it was first published in an article by John Crawfurd as an engraving made in June 1828. ==Layout and effect of the plan== 1825 map of Singapore, showing the layout of the colony at that time, with many roads shown in Jackson Plan as yet unbuilt ===Overall layout=== The plan is an idealised scheme of how Singapore may be arranged; the streets of the colony were laid out for the large part in a grid pattern, but taking into account the curves of the seashore and rivers as well as the topology of the hills. A map of 1825 shows that the actual layout of the town at that time was irregular to the south of the river, and the streets in grid pattern on the south side of the Singapore River (the Chinese kampong) shown in the Jackson Plan did not yet exist. The area west of South Bridge Road was still an undeveloped marshy land in a survey conducted by Coleman in 1829 and published in 1836, but had built up according to the maps of John Turnbull Thomson from 1846. The attempt to arrange the streets in a more regular pattern is also evident in the maps of 1836 and 1846. Map of Singapore in 1914, the layout is now more regular than the 1825 map although it does not correspond entirely to the Jackson Plan ===Administrative and commercial zones=== The area west of the European Town to the Singapore river between the Fort Canning Hill and the sea was reserved for government use, and the area on the southeast of the river designated the commercial district. Although some European merchants had constructed buildings in the area designated for government and public use before the Jackson Plan was implemented, further such privately owned buildings were not permitted. Nevertheless, the rule was still ignored for a while, for example, the Old Parliament House was originally built as a private home, but was then later acquired by the colonial government. The area now has a high concentration of public and government buildings, including Victoria Theatre and Concert Hall, National Gallery, Asian Civilisations Museum, St Andrew's Cathedral, The Arts House, as well as the Parliament House and the Supreme Court of Singapore. The south bank of the Singapore River however was marshy and would only have become suitable for commercial purposes after the marshy land was filled in and the river embanked. A small hill once existed between what is now Raffles Place and Battery Road; under the personal supervision of Raffles in 1823, the hill was levelled, and its soil used to fill and reclaim the marshy land just to the southwest of the River. The level of Battery Road was raised, and the river bank was embanked to become the Boat Quay and the Circular Road area. An open space with a garden in the middle was created, which became the Commercial Square, later renamed Raffles Place in Raffles' honour. This section remains the financial hub of Singapore today, and together with the administrative area and other areas in the plan, evolved into the present-day Downtown Core. ===Ethnic areas=== The plan of Singapore divided the town into ethnic functional subdivisions. These ethnic residential areas were to be segregated into four areas. The European Town had residents who consisted of European traders, Eurasians and rich Asians. An area south of the Singapore River was designated the Chinese Kampong; the Chinese area was originally further down the river, but was moved up the river to make way for the new commercial district, and this Chinese district evolved into the present-day Chinatown. The Indian area, called Chuliah Kampong, was located further up the river next to the Chinese zone (the Indians however would later also settle in another area north of the river now called Little India). Kampong Glam consisted of Muslims, ethnic Malays and Arabs who had migrated to Singapore, and was further divided into three parts, for the Bugis, the Arabs and an area for the Sultan. The division however appeared not to be strictly enforced, as may be indicated by the presence of Nagore Durgha, Al-Abrar and Jamae mosques in the Chinese Kampong with the Chinese temple Thian Hock Keng located next to Nagore Durgha. A area marked \\"Kling Chapel\\" nearer to the Indian area was reserved for an Indian place of worship, although the Indian mosques and Sri Mariamman Temple were built within the Chinese zone. The concept of different ethnic zones would be abandoned, but the distinction of each district is still noticeable to the present day. ===Architecture=== In addition to his proposal for the layout of the town of Singapore, Raffles also made recommendations on how the buildings may be constructed. Among many of Raffles' recommendations are that houses should be built with masonry and roof tiles to reduce fire risk. He also proposed that these buildings should have uniform and regular facades and that they should have a continuous sheltered public walkway at the front. This proposal produced the distinctive five foot ways of the local architecture of Singapore and Malaysia where by-laws were enacted requiring such walkways, and it also spread to other countries including parts of Thailand and the Philippines as well as Taiwan, Hong Kong and the port cities of southern China. ==See also== *Founding of modern Singapore *Urban planning in Singapore ==References== Category:British rule in Singapore Category:Urban planning in Singapore ","title":"Jackson Plan"},{"id":"1999107","text":"*Oregano, Origanum vulgare, is a herb commonly used in cooking.

It describes the ascent of the patriarch Enoch, ancestor of Noah, through ten heavens of an Earth-centered cosmos. The cosmology of 2 Enoch corresponds closely with early medieval beliefs about the metaphysical structure of the universe and may have been influential in shaping them. The text was lost for several centuries, then recovered and published at the end of the nineteenth century. The full text is extant only in Church Slavonic, but Coptic fragments have been known since 2009. The Church Slavonic itself represents a translation from an earlier Greek version.F.I. Andersen 2 (Old Bulgarian Apocalypse of) Enoch, a new Translation and Introduction in ed. James Charlesworth The Old Testament Pseudepigrapha, Vol 1 (1983), page 94 Some scholars attribute 2 Enoch to an unidentified Jewish sect, while others regard it as the work of first-century Christians.Harry Alan Hahne, Harry Hahne, Corruption and Redemption of Creation: Nature in Romans 8.19-22 and Jewish Apocalyptic Literature (2006). p 83 Some consider it a later Christian work.Maunder (1918), Milik (1976) It is not included in either the Jewish or the Christian canon. 2 Enoch is distinct from the Book of Enoch, known as 1 Enoch, and there is also an unrelated 3 Enoch. The numbering of these texts has been applied by scholars to distinguish each from the others. == Manuscript tradition == 2 Enoch has survived in more than twenty Old Bulgarian manuscripts and fragments dated from the 14th to 18th centuries CE. These Old Bulgarian materials did not circulate independently, but were included in collections that often rearranged, abbreviated, or expanded them. Typically, Jewish pseudepigraphical texts in Slavic milieux were transmitted as part of larger historiographical, moral, and liturgical codexes and compendiums, where ideologically marginal and mainstream materials were mixed with each other. 2 Enoch exists in longer and shorter recensions. The first editorsPopov, Kniga Enocha, Mosckow 1880, (based on m. P)M. I. Sokolov, Slavjanskaja kniga Enocha, Moskow 1899 and 1910Charles, Morfill The Book of the Secrets of Enoch, translated from Old Bulgarian, Oxford 1896 (based on m. P and N) considered the longer version to be the original. Since 1921, SchmidtN. Schmidt The two recension of Old Bulgarian Enoch, in Journal of the American Oriental Society, 41(1921) pp 307ss and many authorsPaolo Sacchi, William J. Short Jewish Apocalyptic and Its History, , 1996 challenged this theory, and considered the shorter recension to be more ancient. VaillantA. Vaillant Le livre des secrets d'Henoch, Texte slave et traduction francaise, Paris 1952 (based on m. U) showed in 1952 that the additional parts found only in the longer version use more recent terms. Other scholarsA. De Santos Otero Libro de los secretos de Henoc (Henoc eslavo) in ed. A. Diez Macho Apocrifos del Antiguo Testamento IV, Madrid 1984 (based on m. R) suggest that both of them preserve original material, and posit the existence of three or even four recensions. Two different ways of numbering verses and chapters are used for 2 Enoch: the more widely accepted is Popov's of 73 chapters, while De Santos Otero proposed division into 24 chapters. The best family of manuscriptsMPr, TSS 253, TSS 489, TSS 682. are copies of the compilation of rearranged materials from Chapters 40–65 found in a 14th-century judicial codex titled The Just Balance (Merilo Pravednoe). The main manuscripts of the longer version are designated R, J, and P.R (0:1–73:9) dated 16th century; J (0:1–71:4) dated 16th century supposed to be a modification of R; P (0:1–68:7) dated 1679 supposed to be late copy of J The main manuscripts of the shorter version are designated U, B, V, and N.U (0:1–72:10) dated 15th century, the longer text of the short recension; B (0:1–72:10) dated 17th century; V (1:1–67:3) dated 17th century; N (0:1–67:3) dated 16th-17th century Several other manuscripts exist.A. Orlov, The Enoch-Metatron Tradition (Tuebingen: Mohr-Siebeck, 2005) 148. Most scholars believe that the Old Bulgarian version was translated from one or more lost Greek versions, since the text attests to some traditions that make sense only in the Greek language, for example, a tradition found in 2 Enoch 30 that derives Adam’s name from the Greek designations of the four corners of the earth. The Semitisms, such as the words Ophanim, Raqia Arabot, and others, found in various parts of the text, point to the possibility of a Semitic original behind the Greek version. In 2009, four fragments in Coptic from Chapters 36–42 were identified. They follow the short recension and are related to Manuscript U. == Date == Dates ranging from the 1st century BCE to the 10th century CE have been proposed, with the late 1st century CE often preferred. The date of the text can be deduced solely on the basis of the internal evidence, since the book has survived only in the medieval manuscripts (even if a reference to 2 Enoch could be found in Origen's De Principis i, 3:3). 2 Enoch's composition must be later than that of the Book of the Watchers in 1 Enoch, around the 3rd century BCE. The crucial arguments for the early dating of the text have very largely been linked to the themes of the Temple in Jerusalem and its ongoing practices and customs. Scholarly efforts have been, in this respect, mostly directed toward finding hints that the Sanctuary was still standing when the original text was composed. Scholars note that the text gives no indication that the destruction of the Temple had already occurred at the time of the book's composition. Critical readers of the pseudepigraphic would have difficulty finding any explicit expression of feelings of sadness or mourning about the loss of the sanctuary. Affirmations of the value of animal sacrifice and Enoch's halakhic instructions, found in 2 Enoch 59, also appear to be fashioned not in the \\"preservationist\\", mishnaic- like style, but rather as if they reflected sacrificial practices that still existed when the author was writing his book. The author tries to legitimize the central place of worship, through reference to the place Ahuzan, which is a cryptic name for a Jewish temple. Scholars have also previously noted in the text some indications of the ongoing practice of pilgrimage to the central place of worship. These indications could be expected in a text written in the Alexandrian Diaspora. In his instructions to the children, Enoch repeatedly encourages them to bring the gifts before the face of God for the remission of sins, a practice which appears to recall well-known sacrificial customs widespread in the Second Temple period. Further, the Old Bulgarian apocalypse also contains a direct command to visit the Temple three times a day, an inconsistency if the sanctuary had been already destroyed. == Content == The Second Book of Enoch, also known as The Book of the Secrets of Enoch, is most noted for its description of multiple heavens and accounts of battles between angels and devils. This account is thought to have been known by and to have influenced the apostle Paul who described his experience of being taken up to the third heaven (2 Corinthians 12:2-4). Enoch describes the ten heavens this way: 1\\\\. The first heaven is just above the firmament (Genesis 1:6-7) where the angels control atmospheric phenomena such as the storehouses of snow and rain and the waters above. 2\\\\. In the second heaven, Enoch finds darkness: a prison where rebel angels are tortured. 3\\\\. In the third heaven, he sees both paradise represented as the garden of eden (also guarded by angels) (as in 2 Corinthians 12:2) and hell where bad men are tortured. 4\\\\. The fourth heaven is the place of the movements of the Sun and of the Moon, which are described in detail. There is also on this level a heavenly choir comprising soldier angels whose singing is wonderful and marvelous. 5\\\\. In the fifth heaven, Enoch finds some Grigori: soldiers of Satan that look like human beings but were giants. They were in a state of limbo, having not yet been condemned, and Enoch convinced them to repent. 6\\\\. In the sixth heaven, he sees the angels in charge of governing the cosmos and people. These are the archangels who are above angels, measure all life in heaven and on earth, and the angels who are (appointed) over seasons and years, the angels who are over rivers and sea, and who are over the fruits of the earth, and the angels who are over every grass, giving food to all, to every living thing, and the angels who write all the souls of men, and all their deeds, and their lives before the Lord’s face. 7\\\\. In the seventh heaven, Enoch, now guided by Gabriel, is allowed to enter and sees the Lord on his throne face to face but only from a distance. This is where the legions of God’s angels live in beautiful light. 8\\\\. The Eighth heaven is just below the upper firmament in which are stuck the constellations; here lives Muzaloth, changer of the seasons and mover of the constellations. 9\\\\. The ninth heaven is the upper firmament in which are fixed the constellations and the changer of the seasons. 10 The tenth and final heaven is where God’s throne resides and God's face may be seen up close. Here he holds court. The book can be divided into four sections: * In the first section (chapters 1–22), Enoch, at the age of 365, is taken by two angels through the ten heavens , one by one. * In the second section (chapters 23–37), Enoch, now guided by Gabriel, speaks with God in the tenth heaven face to face. Afterwards, he is anointed by Michael, and becomes similar in appearance to the angels. God tests the obedience of his angels by having them bow down before Enoch. A group of angels, identified as the angels of Satanail, refuses; they are imprisoned. Eventually, they bow before Enoch, addressing him as \\"a man of God.\\" (This story seems similar to that of the War in Heaven between God and Satan.) The Lord asks the angel Vereviel to dictate to Enoch 360 books containing all that is knowable. Later, the Lord himself tells Enoch the secrets, unknown even to the angels, of the Creation until the Flood. Enoch is then sent back to Earth for thirty days. * The third section (chapters 38–68) is a list of doctrinal and ethical instructions given by Enoch to his sons. The main moral principle is to have love for all living beings (similar to the ethics found in the Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs). Particularly noticeable is a lack of interest in the sin of fornication, and not once is the Law of Moses referred to. Enoch teaches the uselessness of intercessions. At the end of the thirty days, Enoch is taken into heaven forever. * The last section (sometimes referred to as the Exaltation of Melchizedek) outlines the priestly succession of Enoch. Enoch's son, Methuselah, is asked by the people to act as an interim priest. The priesthood of Nir, grandson of Methuselah, is also temporary. Then the miraculous birth of Melchizedek and his priesthood are narrated (see Melchizedek in the Second Book of Enoch for a short summary). In manuscript B and in the long versions, this section ends with a short narrative of the Deluge. == Exaltation of Melchizedek == Chapters 69-73 of 2 Enoch (sometimes referred as the Exaltation of Melchizedek or 2EM) outline the priestly succession of Enoch. There is not unanimous consensus whether this section belongs to the main body of the text or it is an early addition. Considering the not-fragmentary main manuscripts, 2EM is not included in P V N, it is included partially in J, while it is fully included in R U B, which anyway represent the best traditions of all versions. So we have both shorter and a longer versions of 2EM. Some early authors, as Charles, have not included this section mainly because they based their edition on manuscripts P and N. The lack of this section in recent manuscripts is explained by others because of the scandalous content (the virgin birth of Melchisedek) for Christian copyists. According to Vaillant, who edited the first critical edition of 2 Enoch, there is no evidence that 2EM ever existed separately. Modern editions usually include also these chapters. The recent discoveries of Melchisedek 11Q13 text at Qumran and of a related text at Nag Hammadi, have made possible to have an idea about the Melchisedek controversy, involving also 2EM and the Letter to the Hebrews, that developed in non-mainstream Jewish communities and in early Christians communities from the 1st century BCE to the 3rd century CE against the traditional Jewish identification of Melchisedek with Shem.A. Orlov Journal for the Study of Judaism 31 (2000) 23-38 A growing number of scholars recognize the antiquity of 2 Enoch, including also 2EM, and support a pre-70 CE dating for its original composition.C.A. Giescher The different functions of a similar Melchizedek Tradition in 2 Enoch and the Epistle to the Hebrews in ed. Craig A. Evans, James A. Sanders Early Christian Interpretation of the Scriptures of Israel: Investigations and Proposals (1997) p.366 Sacchi suggests that 2EM is actually an addition to the main body of the text (the style is slightly different), but a very early addition by someone of the same sect that wrote 2 Enoch (it uses the same language and same typical names as Ahuzan for Temple), dating 2EM after the 70 CE but before or about the Letter to the Hebrews. The differences between 2EM with the Letter to the Hebrews (in the Letter to the Hebrews, Melchisedek is primarily a heavenly figure, while 2EM depicts him as an earthly one) don't allow to prove the dependence of 2EM from Hebrews.Martha Himmelfarb Ascent to Heaven in Jewish and Christian Apocalypses (1993), p. 41 == Theology == The theological universe of 2 Enoch is deeply rooted in the Enochic mold of the Jewish Apocalyptic literature of the Second Temple period. Yet along with appropriations of ancient traditions about the seventh antediluvian hero, the text attempts to reshape them by adding a new mystical dimension to the familiar apocalyptic imagery. The figure of Enoch portrayed in the various sections of 2 Enoch appears more elaborate than in the early Second Temple Enochic treatise of 1 Enoch. The anointing of Enoch, after he saw face to face the Lord, makes him be similar in appearance to a glorious angel and that allows him to sit above other angels on the left of the Lord. According to Orlov, in this attempt, one may find the origins of another image of Enoch, very different from the early Enochic literature, that was developed much later in rabbinic Merkabah and Hekhalot mysticism: the image of the supreme angel Metatron, \\"the Prince of the Presence\\", found in the later 3 Enoch. The titles of the patriarch found in the Old Bulgarian apocalypse appear to be different from those attested in early Enochic writings and demonstrate a close resemblance to the titles of Metatron as they appear in some Hekhalot sources. These developments demonstrate that 2 Enoch represents a bridge between the early apocalyptic Enochic accounts and the later mystical rabbinic and Hekhalot traditions. == See also == * Book of Giants * 1 Enoch * 3 Enoch == Note  References  Further reading == * The Secrets of Enoch can be found in The Lost Books of the Bible and the Forgotten Books of Eden == External links  Online English translations === *The Book of the Secrets of Enoch, edited by R.

Tuttle Company in 1994, and reprinted by Alva Press in 1999. The work argues that what we recognize as traditional Chinese Ch’an/Japanese Zen Buddhism is in fact almost entirely grounded in Chinese Taoist philosophy, though this fact is well shrouded by the persistence of Mahayana Buddhist institutional trappings. Utilizing an array of scholarly commentary on the two traditions and historical deduction from what can be considered to be the best primary source material available, the author traces the development of Taoism and Buddhism in China and Japan for two millennia. The story unfolds in China as Buddhism appears on the scene and is accepted by the Chinese population as a “simplified version of Taoism” that the Western barbarians (subcontinent Indians and Central Asians, e.g. Tibetans, et al.) could understand. They shared many philosophical similarities that made Chinese acclimation to Buddhism much easier – but the more dogmatic ways in which Buddhism was practiced helped it to get the fast track on becoming the predominant religion in China. Its predisposition to monastic institutionalization throughout the empire allowed it to eventually assimilate and co-opt Taoist perspectives. The dominance of the Ch’an Buddhist tradition was most responsible for this trend. However, when it was eventually exported to Japan, the Taoist strands had the opportunity in a new cultural framework to once again assert themselves. Grigg is able to trace the submergence and eventual resurgence of Taoism in Japan and the modern West by identifying how its specific tendencies (paradox, nonduality, aversion to institutionalization, emphasis on informal and varied paths to “enlightenment”, focus on the practical matters of influencing the social world, etc.) clearly manifested themselves in very different times and places. What he seeks to do in this book is vindicate the importance of Taoist thought in the Chinese religious history and displace the notion of Zen Buddhism as a coherent whole. To him, these are very different spiritual systems that only coexist today because of the almost wholly unacknowledged lingering of the original Buddhist colonization of Taoist China. The popularity of Zen today owes much more to its persistent Taoist origins than to Buddhist doctrine. ==References== * Grigg, Ray (1994) The Tao of Zen, Tuttle Publishing.

Roosevelt, and later wife of U.S. Ambassador to the Court of St James's, John Hay Whitney. ==Early life== She was the middle daughter of prominent neurosurgeon Dr. Harvey Williams Cushing and his wife Katharine Stone Crowell, who hailed from a socially prominent Cleveland family. Dr. Cushing, who was descended from Matthew Cushing, an early settler of Hingham, Massachusetts, served as professor of surgery at Johns Hopkins, Harvard and Yale Universities, and established the family in Boston. Though she had two brothers, she and her two sisters became known in the social world as the \\"Cushing Sisters\\", heralded for their charm and beauty and schooled by their social-climbing mother to pursue husbands of wealth and prominence. All three Cushing sisters married into wealth and prominence: Her older sister, Mary \\"Minnie\\", married Vincent Astor, the heir of a $200 million fortune, in 1940, and her younger sister Barbara \\"Babe\\" was married to Standard Oil heir Stanley Mortimer, Jr., and later to CBS founder William S. Paley. Both of her sisters died of cancer within months of each other in 1978. ==Philanthropy== She established the Greentree Foundation in 1983 to assist local community groups. She was a benefactor of North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, built in the early 1950s on donated by Whitney. She was also involved with the Museum of Modern Art (MOMA), Yale University and New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center. Among her many public activities over the years were memberships on the boards of the Whitney Museum of American Art, the John Hay Whitney Foundation and the Association for Homemakers Service. After her husband's death in 1982, she donated $8 million to the Yale Medical School, then the largest gift in the school's history. The National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. acquired nine important American and French paintings, as well as $2 million for future acquisitions. She left $15 million to New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center in her own will. She also made art auction history in 1990 by putting up for sale, by Sotheby's, one of Renoir's most famous paintings, the sun-dappled cafe scene Bal au moulin de la Galette, Montmartre. It brought $78.1 million, then a record auction price for Impressionist art and the second-highest price for any artwork sold at auction. After her death, her art collection was sold at Sotheby's in 1999 for a then-record $128.3 million, \\"the second-highest single-owner auction in history.\\" ==Personal life== In June 1930, she married James Roosevelt II (1907–1991), the eldest son of then Governor of New York, and eventual President of the United States, Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Anna Eleanor Roosevelt. After her father-in-law became President, she was reportedly FDR's favorite daughter-in-law, though she and Eleanor did not care for one another. Her husband served his father as an aide at the White House, and she often stood-in as hostess at the White House when Eleanor was absent. When FDR entertained King George VI and Queen Elizabeth at a picnic at the Roosevelt estate in Hyde Park, New York in 1939, she was present and accompanied FDR as he drove the King and Queen along the Hudson River. She and James had two daughters: * Sara Delano Roosevelt (born 1932), who married Anthony di Bonaventura (1929–2012) in 1953. They divorced in 1972 and she married Ronald A. Wilford (1927–2015) in 1973. * Kate Roosevelt (born 1936), later known as Kate Whitney after her stepfather adopted her. She is the mother of Lulie Haddad. In 1938, James left for Hollywood to work as an aide to Samuel Goldwyn. she followed him, but they divorced in 1940. She was granted custody of their daughters, along with child support, though by biographers' accounts, James had little to no contact with his children, and eventually married three more times. On March 1, 1942, she married millionaire John Hay \\"Jock\\" Whitney (1904–1982), who had been previously married to socialite Elizabeth Altemus. Whitney adopted both of her daughters. They moved to London in 1957, when President Dwight D. Eisenhower named Whitney Ambassador to the Court of St. James's. During the 1970s, Whitney was listed as one of the ten wealthiest men in the world. Their residences over the years included the Greentree estate on Long Island; Greenwood Plantation in Georgia; a town house and an elegant apartment in Manhattan; a large summer house on Fishers Island, near New London, Connecticut; a 12-room house in Saratoga Springs, which the Whitneys used when they attended horse races there; a golfing cottage in Augusta, Georgia; and a spacious house, Cherry Hill, in Virginia Water, Surrey, England, near the Ascot racecourse. In addition, the Whitneys shared a Kentucky horse farm with Whitney's sister. ===Death=== She died on March 25, 1998, at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, New York. Her personal fortune was estimated at $700 million in 1990 according to Forbes magazine. Her estate bequeathed eight major paintings to the National Gallery of Art. ==Art owned== *Self-Portrait (1889) by Vincent van Gogh *Marcelle Lender Dancing the Bolero in Chilpéric (1895/1896) by Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec *Open Window, Collioure (1905) by Henri Matisse *The Harbor of La Ciotat (1907) by Georges Braque *The Beach at Sainte-Adresse (1906) by Raoul Dufy *Bal du moulin de la Galette (1876) by Pierre-Auguste Renoir, the fifth most expensive painting ever sold, when adjusted for inflation. ==ReferencesFurther reading== *The Sisters: Babe Mortimer Paley, Betsey Roosevelt Whitney, Minnie Astor Fosburgh: The Lives and Times of the Fabulous Cushing Sisters by David Grafton (Villard 1992). *Last Cushing sister dies: Betsey Whitney outlived husbands, by Enid Nemy, The New York Times, March 26, 1998 ==External links== * Category:1909 births Category:1998 deaths Category:American art collectors Category:American philanthropists Category:American socialites Category:People from Baltimore Category:People from Boston Category:People from Connecticut Category:People from Long Island Category:Roosevelt family Category:Whitney family Category:20th-century American politicians Category:20th-century American women ","title":"Betsey Cushing Roosevelt Whitney"},{"id":"1999121","text":"Chaos and Disorder is the eighteenth studio album by American recording artist Prince.

It is one of the three isomers of dimethylbenzene known collectively as xylenes. The p- stands for para-, indicating that the two methyl groups in p-xylene occupy the diametrically opposite substituent positions 1 and 4. It is in the positions of the two methyl groups, their arene substitution pattern, that it differs from the other isomers, o-xylene and m-xylene. All have the same chemical formula C6H4(CH3)2. All xylene isomers are colorless and highly flammable. The odor threshold of p-xylene is 0.62 parts per million (ppm). ==Production== The production of p-xylene is industrially significant, with annual demand estimated at 37 million tons in 2014, and still on the increase.Nature 532,435–437 (28 April 2016) doi:10.1038/532435a p-Xylene is produced by catalytic reforming of petroleum naphtha as part of the BTX aromatics (benzene, toluene and the xylene isomers) extracted from the catalytic reformate. The p-xylene is then separated out in a series of distillation, adsorption or crystallization and reaction processes from the m-xylene, o-xylene, and ethylbenzene. Its melting point is the highest among this series of isomers, but simple crystallization does not allow easy purification due to the formation of eutectic mixtures. Such separation procedures are major cost factors in the production of p-xylene, and the search for alternative methods continues. For example, a reverse-osmosis technique has been proposed to improve various aspects of the processes. ==Industrial applications== p-Xylene is an important chemical feedstock. Among other industrial applications, it is a raw material in the large scale synthesis of various polymers. In particular it is a component in the production of terephthalic acid for polyesters such as polyethylene terephthalate (generally known as PET). It also may be polymerised directly to produce parylene. :Terephthalic acid ==Toxicity and exposure== Xylenes are not acutely toxic, for example the LD50 (rat, oral) is 4300 mg/kg. Effects vary with animal and xylene isomer. Concerns with xylenes focus on narcotic effects. Overexposure of p-xylene in humans can cause headache, fatigue, dizziness, listlessness, confusion, irritability, gastrointestinal disturbances including nausea and loss of appetite, flushing of the face, and a feeling of increased body heat. p-Xylene vapor exposure over the recommended exposure limit of 100 parts per million (ppm) can cause irritation to eye, nose, and throat and possible chest tightening and an abnormal gait. p-Xylene occurs naturally in petroleum and coal tar. It is emitted by most combustion sources, including automobile exhaust and tobacco smoke.EPA-454/R-93-048 Locating and estimating air emissions from sources of xylene Emission Inventory Branch Technical Support Division Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards U.S. Environmental Protection Agency March 1994 ===Inhalation=== Inhaling p-xylene can cause dizziness, headache, drowsiness, and nausea. If exposure through inhalation occurs, first aid includes fresh air, rest and possible medical attention. Through the use of ventilation or breathing protection, exposure to p-xylene through inhalation can be prevented. ===Skin=== Exposure of p-xylene through the skin can cause dry skin and redness. If skin exposure occurs, first aid includes rinsing and then washing the affected area with soap and water as well as removing any contaminated clothing and thoroughly cleaning and drying before reuse. Exposure can be prevented through the use of protective gloves. ===Eyes=== Exposure of p-xylene to eyes can cause redness and pain. If eyes are exposed, first aid includes rinsing of the eyes with water for several minutes, removal of contact lenses if applicable, and medical attention. Eye exposure can be prevented through the use of safety glasses or safety goggles. ===Ingestion=== Ingestion of p-xylene can result in a burning sensation, abdominal pain, dizziness, drowsiness, headache, and nausea. If p-xylene is ingested one's mouth should be rinsed and vomiting should not be induced. Further medical attention should be sought. Ingestion can be prevented by not eating, drinking, or smoking when working with p-xylene. ===Short-term exposure=== p-Xylene can cause issues with the central nervous system and if swallowed could cause chemical pneumonitis when breathed into the lungs. ===Long-term exposure=== Liquid p-xylene exposure to the skin over long periods of time can remove the fat from the skin.

Coffea robusta), commonly known as robusta coffee, is a species of coffee that has its origins in central and western sub-Saharan Africa. It is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. Though widely known as Coffea robusta, the plant is scientifically identified as Coffea canephora, which has two main varieties, robusta and nganda. There are several differences between the composition of beans from Coffea arabica and Coffea robusta. This article seems to have a mistake, using the word \\"diptenes\\" instead of \\"diterpenes\\", and also seems to contradict the above reference. == Description == Robusta coffee flowers Robusta is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. Though widely known by the synonym Coffea robusta, the plant is currently scientifically identified as Coffea canephora, which has two main varieties, C. c. robusta and C. c. nganda. The plant has a shallow root system and grows as a robust tree or shrub to about 10 m tall. It flowers irregularly, taking about 10–11 months for cherries to ripen, producing oval-shaped beans. The robusta plant has a greater crop yield than that of arabica, contains more caffeine (2.7% compared to arabica's 1.5%), and contains less sugar (3–7% compared to arabica's 6–9%). As it is less susceptible to pests and disease, robusta needs much less herbicide and pesticide than arabica. == Native distribution == Originating in upland forests in Ethiopia, C. canephora grows indigenously in Western and Central Africa from Liberia to Tanzania and south to Angola. It was not recognized as a species of Coffea until 1897, over a hundred years after Coffea arabica. It is also reportedly naturalized in Borneo, French Polynesia, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Jamaica and the Lesser Antilles. In 1927 a hybrid between robusta and arabica was found in Timor. This strain was subsequently used to breed rust-resistant plants. == Cultivation and use == Unroasted (so-called 'green') robusta beans Traditional coffee beans drying in Kalibaru, Indonesia Robusta coffee is coffee made from beans of the plant Coffea canephora, a sturdy species with low acidity and high bitterness. C. canephora beans, widely known by the synonym Coffea robusta, are used primarily in instant coffee, espresso, and as a filler in ground coffee blends. Robusta has its origins in central and western sub-Saharan Africa. It is easy to care for, has a greater crop yield, has almost double the amount of caffeine and more antioxidants, and is less susceptible to disease than arabica coffea. It represents 43% of global coffee production, with arabica constituting the remainder except for the 1% constituted by coffea liberica It is mostly grown in Vietnam, where French colonists introduced it in the late 19th century, though it is also grown in India, Africa and Brazil, where it is often called conilon. In recent years, Vietnam, which produces mostly robusta, has become the world's largest exporter of robusta coffee, accounting for over 40% of the total production. It surpasses Brazil (25% of the world's production), Indonesia (13%), India (5%), and Uganda (5%). Brazil is still the biggest coffee producer in the world, producing one-third of the world's coffee, though 69% of that is C. arabica. Robusta is easier to care for and has a greater crop yield than C. arabica, so is cheaper to produce. Roasted robusta beans produce a strong, full-bodied coffee with a distinctive earthy flavour, but usually with more bitterness than arabica due to its pyrazine content. Since arabica beans are believed to have smoother taste with more acidity and a richer flavour, they are often considered superior, while the harsher robusta beans are mostly used as a filler in lower-grade coffee blends. However, the powerful flavour can be desirable in a blend to give it perceived \\"strength\\" and \\"finish\\", noticeably in Italian coffee culture. Good-quality robusta beans are used in traditional Italian espresso blends, at about 10–15%, to provide a full-bodied taste and a better foam head (known as crema). It is besides used as a stimulant, diuretic, antioxidant, antipyretic and relieves spasmodic asthma. ==See also== *Coffea arabica *Coffea charrieriana == References  External links == *Comparison Chart of Robusta to Arabica *Robusta Coffee in Vietnam *The Difference Between Arabica and Robusta? *Jan 2008 ICO break down of all Coffee exports *Jan 2008 ICO break down of Green Coffee exports *World Checklist of Rubiaceae canephora Category:Flora of West Tropical Africa Category:Flora of West-Central Tropical Africa Category:Flora of East Tropical Africa Category:Flora of Angola Category:Flora of Nigeria Category:Flora of Sudan Category:Crops originating from Africa Category:Coffee varieties Category:Plants described in 1897 ","title":"Coffea canephora"},{"id":"1999155","text":"Robert I (Italian: Roberto I Carlo Luigi Maria di Borbone, Duca di Parma e Piacenza; 9 July 1848 - 16 November 1907) was the last sovereign Duke of Parma and Piacenza from 1854 until 1859, when the duchy was annexed to Sardinia- Piedmont during the Risorgimento. He was a member of the House of Bourbon- Parma and descended from Philip, Duke of Parma, the third son of King Philip V of Spain and Elisabeth Farnese. ==Early life== Born in Florence, Robert was the elder son of Charles III, Duke of Parma and Louise Marie Thérèse d'Artois, daughter of Charles Ferdinand, duc de Berry and granddaughter of King Charles X of France. He succeeded his father to the ducal throne in 1854 upon the latter's assassination, when he was only six, while his mother stood as regent. When Robert was eleven years old, he was deposed, as Piedmontese troops annexed other Italian states, ultimately to form the Kingdom of Italy. Despite losing his throne, Robert and his family enjoyed considerable wealth, traveling in a private train of more than a dozen cars from his castles at Schwarzau am Steinfeld near Vienna, to Villa Pianore in northwest Italy, and the magnificent château de Chambord in France. ==Marriages and issue== On 5 April 1869, while in exile in Rome, he married Princess Maria Pia of Bourbon- Two Sicilies (1849–1882), daughter of King Ferdinand II of the Two Sicilies. She was his half first cousin once removed, as her father (Ferdinand II) and Robert's maternal grandmother (Princess Caroline Ferdinande of Bourbon-Two Sicilies) were half-siblings, both being children of Francis I of the Two Sicilies. Maria Pia belonged to the deposed Royal Family of the Two Sicilies and was thus a Bourbon, like her husband. She bore him 12 children, before dying in childbirth: {| class=\\"wikitable\\" !

Nonetheless, Robert's primary heir was his son Elias, the youngest son of his first marriage and the only one of his sons by that marriage to beget children of his own. Elias also became the legal guardian of his six elder siblings. Although the eldest half-brothers, Sixte and Xavier, eventually sued their half-brother Elias for trying to obtain a greater share of the ducal fortune, they lost in the French courts, leaving the issue of Robert's second marriage with modest prospects. Some of his younger sons served in the Austrian armed forces. ==Honours== * : Grand Prefect of the Sacred Military Constantinian Order of St. George * : Knight of the Order of the Golden Fleece, 19 January 1854 * Duchy of Modena and Reggio: Grand Cross of the Order of the Eagle of Este, 1856 * : Knight of the Order of St. Hubert, 1897Hof- und Staats-Handbuch des Königreich Bayern (1906), \\"Königliche Orden\\" p. 8 ==AncestryPatrilineal descent=== Robert's patriline is the line from which he is descended father to son. Patrilineal descent is the principle behind membership in royal houses, as it can be traced back through the generations - which means that if Duke Robert were to choose an historically accurate house name it would be Robert, as all his male-line ancestors have been of that house. Robert is a member of the House of Bourbon-Parma, a sub-branch of the House of Bourbon-Spain, itself originally a branch of the House of Bourbon, and thus of the Capetian dynasty and of the Robertians. Robert's patriline is the line from which he is descended father to son. It follows the Dukes of Parma as well as the Kings of Spain, France, and Navarre. The line can be traced back more than 1,200 years from Robert of Hesbaye to the present day, through Kings of France & Navarre, Spain and Two-Sicilies, Dukes of Parma and Grand-Dukes of Luxembourg, Princes of Orléans and Emperors of Brazil. It is one of the oldest in Europe. #Robert II of Worms and Rheingau (Robert of Hesbaye), 770 - 807 #Robert III of Worms and Rheingau, 808 - 834 #Robert IV the Strong, 820 - 866 #Robert I of France, 866 - 923 #Hugh the Great, 895 - 956 #Hugh Capet, 941 - 996 #Robert II of France, 972 - 1031 #Henry I of France, 1008–1060 #Philip I of France, 1053–1108 #Louis VI of France, 1081–1137 #Louis VII of France, 1120–1180 #Philip II of France, 1165–1223 #Louis VIII of France, 1187–1226 #Louis IX of France, 1215–1270 #Robert, Count of Clermont, 1256–1317 #Louis I, Duke of Bourbon, 1279–1342 #James I, Count of La Marche, 1319–1362 #John I, Count of La Marche, 1344–1393 #Louis, Count of Vendôme, 1376–1446 #Jean VIII, Count of Vendôme, 1428–1478 #François, Count of Vendôme, 1470–1495 #Charles de Bourbon, Duke of Vendôme, 1489–1537 #Antoine, King of Navarre, Duke of Vendôme, 1518–1562 #Henry IV, King of France and of Navarre, 1553–1610 #Louis XIII, King of France and Navarre, 1601–1643 #Louis XIV, King of France and Navarre, 1638–1715 #Louis, Grand Dauphin of France, 1661–1711 #Philip V of Spain, 1683–1746 #Philip, Duke of Parma, 1720–1765 #Ferdinand, Duke of Parma, 1751–1802 #Louis of Etruria, 1773–1803 #Charles II, Duke of Parma, 1799–1883 #Charles III, Duke of Parma, 1823–1854 #Robert I, Duke of Parma, 1848–1907 ==See also== *Duchy of Parma *List of Dukes of Parma ==References== Category:Dukes of Parma Category:Pretenders to the throne of Parma Category:Princes of Parma and Piacenza Category:Princes of Bourbon-Parma Category:House of Bourbon-Parma Category:1848 births Category:1907 deaths Category:People from Florence Category:Spanish infantes Category:Knights of the Golden Fleece of Spain Category:Knights of the Order of Saint Hubert ","title":"Robert I, Duke of Parma"},{"id":"1999162","text":"Warren Township is one of the twenty-four townships of Trumbull County, Ohio, United States.

He inherited a fortune and enlarged it through business dealings, then devoted much of his money and efforts to a wide variety of philanthropic purposes. His will included funds to expand the New York Hospital, now called NewYork–Presbyterian Hospital, where the Payne Whitney Psychiatric Clinic was established. ==Early life== William Payne Whitney was born on March 20, 1876 to William Collins Whitney (1841–1904) and Flora Payne (1842–1893). His siblings included: elder brother, Harry Payne Whitney (1872–1930), Pauline Payne Whitney (1874–1916), and younger sister, Dorothy Payne Whitney (1887–1968). Whitney was educated at the Groton School. He attended Yale University, where he was a member of Skull and Bones, Delta Kappa Epsilon, and captained the Yale rowing team. After graduating in 1898, Whitney then studied law at the Harvard Law School, receiving his Bachelor of Laws in 1901. ==Career== In addition to a substantial inheritance from his father, Payne Whitney inherited $63,000,000 from his uncle, Col. Oliver Hazard Payne. Amongst his many investments, Whitney had major holdings in banking, tobacco, railroads, mining and oil. He was a member of the board of directors and/or an executive officer of several large corporations, including the City Bank New York, and the Great Northern Paper Company, and the Northern Finance Corporation. ===Equestrianism=== A horse racing enthusiast in the tradition of his father and brother, Payne Whitney's Greentree Stable, named for their Long Island estate, was a very significant racing and breeding operation for thoroughbred horses. ===Philanthropy=== Throughout his life, Payne Whitney was involved in philanthropic work for a variety of causes. A trustee of the New York Public Library, in 1923 he gave the library $12,000,000. Whitney made charitable contributions to the rowing team at his alma mater, Yale University, including donating funds to build a dormitory for the crew. His will bequeathed more than $20 million to establish the Payne Whitney Psychiatric Clinic at Cornell University's medical school, now called Weill Cornell Medicine, and New York Hospital, now New York–Presbyterian Hospital in New York City. Smaller amounts to other educational and medical institutions. Although he had contributed $1,000,000 to the Yale Endowment Fund shortly before his death, sufficient estate funds were given to enable Yale's construction of the 9½ story Payne Whitney Gymnasium that too was completed in 1932. As a tribute to him, a road in Manhasset was named after him, Payne Whitney Lane. ==Personal life== On September 20, 1911, Whitney was aboard the RMS Olympic when it was rammed by the warship, HMS Hawke. Olympic was the sister ship of the RMS Titanic. In 1902, Whitney married Helen Julia Hay (1875–1944), the daughter of then-United States Secretary of State (and former U.S. Ambassador to the United Kingdom) John Hay. Their Stanford White-designed mansion, Payne Whitney House at 972 Fifth Avenue, was a wedding gift from his maternal uncle, Oliver Hazard Payne. The couple also had an estate, Greentree, in Manhasset, New York. Together, they had two children: * Joan Whitney (1903–1975), who was the first owner of the New York Mets Major League Baseball team. * John Hay Whitney (1904–1982), who served as the United States Ambassador to the United Kingdom Whitney died in 1927 at his Greentree estate. ==ReferencesExternal link== Official webpage for NewYork Presbyterian Department of Psychiatry Category:Lawyers from New York City Category:American businesspeople Category:American socialites Category:Philanthropists from New York (state) Category:American racehorse owners and breeders Category:Harvard Law School alumni Category:Benefactors of Yale University Category:Groton School alumni Category:Whitney family Category:Yale University alumni Category:1876 births Category:1927 deaths Category:American people of English descent Category:People from Manhasset, New York Category:American male tennis players ","title":"Payne Whitney"},{"id":"1999184","text":"Our Gang (1971) is Philip Roth's fifth novel. A marked departure from his previous book, the popular Portnoy's Complaint, Our Gang is a political satire written in the form of a closet drama. Centered on the character of \\"Trick E. Dixon\\", a caricature of then-President Richard Nixon, the book takes its cue from an actual quote from Nixon: As the book is written entirely as dialogue, Roth uses stage directions, such as \\"impish endearing smile\\", when Dixon is talking. ==Summary== The book is six chapters long. Chapter one is entitled \\"Tricky comforts a troubled citizen\\". In the chapter, the citizen in question is concerned with William Calley's killing of twenty-two Vietnamese villagers at My Lai, but he is \\"seriously troubled by the possibility that Lieutenant Calley may have committed an abortion\\". Throughout the chapter, Dixon defends the notion that Calley may have killed a pregnant woman, covering many factors; If the pregnant woman was \\"showing\\" or not, if Calley could have communicated with her, if he really did know she was pregnant, whether the woman asked Calley to give her an abortion or not, etc. Trick E. Dixon manages to defend Calley well until the citizen asks if Calley could have given her an abortion against her will, as \\"an outright form of murder\\", and Dixon gives the following answer, which is supposed to reflect his background as a lawyer and his hard-to-pin-down nature: > Well, of course, that is a very iffy question, isn't it? What we lawyers > call a hypothetical instance—isn't it? If you will remember, we are only > \\"supposing\\" there to have been a pregnant woman in the ditch at My Lai to > begin with. Suppose there \\"wasn't\\" a pregnant woman in that ditch—which, in > fact, seems from all evidence to have been the case. We are then involved in > a totally academic discussion. In chapter two, entitled \\"Tricky holds a press conference\\", Dixon takes questions from reporters with names to suit their respective personalities. The reporters are called Mr. Asslick (who, as his name suggests, \\"sucks up\\" to the President), Mr. Daring (who poses, as suggested, the more daring suggestions in the style of investigative journalism), Mr. Respectful (who acts rather meekly compared to some of his compatriots), Mr. Shrewd (who, being slightly more daring than Mr. Daring, suggests President Dixon may be giving voting rights to the unborn for purely political reasons), Miss Charming (the typical female reporter often stereotyped in media as 'charming' indeed), Mr. Practical (concerned not with the politics of the situation, but the when and the how much of the situation). From this starting point, Roth satirizes Nixon and his cabinet—particularly Henry Kissinger (\\"Highbrow coach\\") and Spiro Agnew (\\"Vice President-what's-his-name\\")—as Tricky tries to deny that he supports sexual intercourse, provoking a group of Boy Scouts to riot in Washington, D.C. in which three are shot. Tricky tries to pin the blame on baseball player Curt Flood and the nation of Denmark, managing to obliterate the city of Copenhagen in the process. After an operation to remove his upper lip sweat gland, he is eventually assassinated by being drowned in a giant baggie filled with water, his corpse in the fetal position. Tricky ends the novel in Hell, campaigning against Satan for the position of Devil. ==Reception== In The New York Times, Dwight Macdonald described the book as \\"far-fetched, unfair, tasteless, disturbing, logical, coarse and very funny\\" and \\"in short, a masterpiece\\". On the other hand, The New Republic compared the novel to Macbird while calling it \\"tasteless and dreadful\\". ==References== Category:1971 American novels Category:Novels by Philip Roth Category:Novels republished in the Library of America Category:American political novels Category:Random House books ","title":"Our Gang (novel)"},{"id":"1999186","text":"The XGameStation is a series of embedded systems, primarily designed as a dedicated home video game console, created by Andre LaMothe and sold by his company Nurve Networks LLC. Originally designed to teach electronics and video game development to programmers Slashdot article about the XGameStation, newer models concentrate more on logic design, multi-core programming, game programming, and embedded system design and programming with popular microcontrollers. ==Prototype Versions== The XGameStation was originally conceived of as a handheld system called the nanoGearGame Buzz article about the XGameStation based around the 68HC12 microprocessor, a modern derivative of the 6809. The system would also contain modern derivatives of the 6502 and Z-80 microprocessors, for retro coders and hackers, and to make emulation of classic computer and video game systems easier. After several iterations, the plan changed to use an ARM microprocessor and an FPGA on which a custom designed GPU was implemented. But after finishing this project it was decided that the resulting system was cost prohibitive and much too advanced for beginners. Instead, the plan was changed again finally resulting in the XGS Micro Edition, based on the SX52 microcontroller. The ARM and FPGA-based system was renamed the XGS Mega Edition after the release of the Micro Edition, and though planned to be sold, it was never released. ==XGS Micro Edition (ME)== The XGS Micro Edition is a pre-built video game console based around the SX52 microcontroller, which is a high-speed PIC microcontroller running at 80 MHz for a total of 80 MIPS. The color television video signal is generated in software on the microcontroller. Sound is generated by a ROHM BU8763 chip. For input, the system has a single PS/2 connector for keyboard or mouse input, as well as two DB-9 for connecting Atari-compatible joysticks. Programming is done in assembly language or in a custom written XGS Basic, either on a PC and then transferred to the console or on the system itself. It has add-on packs for creating your own expansion card and electronic experimenting kit. The Micro Edition contains the XGameStation unit, \\"Designing Your Own Video Game Console\\" - a detailed book in PDF format teaching the basics of electronics, a power supply, A/V cables, a joystick, a COM cable, and a few extras such as a PDF version of one of Andre LaMothe's previous books \\"Tricks of the Windows Game Programming Gurus\\".Article about teaching electronics with the XGameStation ===Video signal generated by software=== The most remarkable aspect of the SX52 Processor is its ability to create a color video signal using only software, and still have the power to simultaneously run the software that uses this video display in order to create an elementary video game or game demo. These latter programs may or may not evolve into a real (playable) game, as often the memory of the SX52 processor is too restricted to support them. Some people also write non-game video demos to show off the video display possibilities of the system. ===Obsolete status of the SX52=== The SX52 has been made obsolete by Parallax, the company that now packages the SX-series of micro controller dies, made by Ubicom, because they did not have a package with 52 pins. However, according to the people at XGameStation, there are enough SX52 chips available for all their future needs.End of life announcement for SX processors packaged by Ubicom On July 31, 2009, Parallax announced that the whole line of SX microcontrollers will be discontinued. ==XGS Pico Edition (PE)== The Pico Edition is a simplified version of the Micro Edition in a build-it-yourself kit.XGameStation Pico Edition The Pico Edition is based around the SX28 microcontroller, which, like the SX52, is a high-speed PIC microcontroller running at 80 MHz for a total of 80 MIPS, though it has less RAM and Flash capacity. Like the Micro Edition, the color television video signal is generated in software on the microcontroller. However, unlike the Micro Edition, the audio signal is also generated directly by the microcontroller and not by an external chip. For input, the system simply reads pushbuttons connected to its input pins. Programming is done in assembly language or in a custom written XGS Basic, on a PC and then transferred to the console. The Pico comes in several different kit forms: the 1.0 kit which comes with a breadboard, a CD with assembly instructions and selected chapters of the same ebook as the Micro Edition and the same extras, the SX28, and the discrete components of the system; and the 2.0 kit, which consists of the 1.0 kit and a PCB (which is also available as an add-on separately); and the Game Console Starter Kit, which includes the 2.0 kit, a hard copy of \\"The Black Art of Video Game Console Design\\", and a soldering iron and solder. ==XGS AVR 8-Bit and XGS PIC 16-Bit Development Systems== Released on December 26, 2008, the XGS AVR 8-Bit and XGS PIC 16-Bit development systems are embedded system development kits, meant to be very competitive entry/midrange development kits for their respective microcontrollers. The systems were designed together and so share much of the same design other than the main processor. The video signal is generated in software like the XGS Micro and Pico Editions; however, there is color helper hardware to generate the colorburst part of the video signal. The audio signal is also generated directly by the microcontroller. For input, like the XGS Micro, two DB-9 ports and a PS/2 port are supplied. However, instead of being compatible with Atari joysticks, the DB-9 ports are compatible with Nintendo gamepads (though directly connecting an NES or SNES controller would require a pin adapter). Unlike the prior XGS and Hydra systems, programming is primarily in C/C++, utilizing system-specific libraries, though assembly programming and a custom written XGS Basic are also available. The XGS Basic code runs on both systems without modification. Unlike the XGS Micro Edition, code cannot be edited on the system itself - a PC is required. The XGS AVR 8-Bit processor is an Atmel MEGA AVR 644P with 64K FLASH and 4K SRAM running at over 28 MIPS. The XGS PIC 16-Bit processor is a PIC24 with 256K FLASH and 16K SRAM running at over 40 MIPS. ==Hydra System== In 2006 Andre LaMothe launched his new HYDRA Game Development Kit, a much more powerful system than the XGS Micro Edition. Unlike the other systems by Nurve, the Hydra does not carry the XGS branding. The Hydra uses the multi-core Parallax Propeller microcontroller, which has an architecture resembling the Cell microprocessor used in the PlayStation 3. The Propeller runs at 80 MHz and uses eight processor cores, called COGs, to reach a performance of 160 MIPS. It also has much more memory than the Micro Edition's SX52: 32K RAM and a 32K ROM which contains a bitmap font for the video display generator, (the Propeller can generate a high quality VGA or PAL/NTSC color picture using software and some special support logic built into each CPU core), tables for mathematical function, and an interpreter for the multi threaded SPIN language. Each CPU core also has its own 2K RAM (512 32bit words) of dedicated memory. For input, the system has two PS/2 ports for a mouse and keyboard (which are sold with the system) and two NES compatible game controller ports (one game controller is included). The system also has a mini USB interface for programming the system, an RJ-11 Ethernet port, and a 128K serial Flash EEPROM for storage. There are also add-ons, such as a 512K external RAM card. ==ReferencesExternal links== *XGameStation official site *XGameStation official community board Category:Video game culture Category:Fangames ","title":"XGameStation series"},{"id":"1999197","text":"Jules Freund (June 24, 1890 - April 22, 1960) was a Hungarian born American immunologist, most famous for the Freund's adjuvant.

Part of the army's infantry corps, the speciality distinguished itself in combat during World War I and World War II. Currently the active Alpini units are organized in two operational brigades, which are subordinated to the Alpine Troops Headquarters. The Alpini's name comes from their inceptive association with the Alps, the mountain range that Italy shares with France, Switzerland, Austria, and Slovenia. An individual soldier of the Alpini is called Alpino. Established in 1872, the Alpini are the oldest active mountain infantry in the world. Their original mission was to protect Italy's border with France and Austria-Hungary. In 1888 the Alpini deployed on their first mission abroad, in Africa, a continent to which they returned on several occasions and during various wars of the Kingdom of Italy. During World War I they fought a three- year campaign on the Alps against Austro-Hungarian Kaiserjäger and the German Alpenkorps in what has since become known as the \\"War in snow and ice\\". During World War II, the Alpini fought alongside the Axis forces primarily in the Balkans Campaigns and on the Eastern Front. During the Cold War the Alpini formed five brigades, which during the 1990s were reduced to two. == History  1872 to 1887 === Cap insignia of Alpini. A Cappello Alpino of a Combat Engineer of the Alpini Corps: with raven feather, amaranth Nappina, (tuft) and the coat of the 2° Engineer Regiment. A pair of Fiamme Verdi collar patches Life size image of a Nappina In 1872, Captain Giuseppe Perrucchetti published a study in the May edition of the Military Review (Italian: Rivista Militare). In the study, he proposed to assign the defence of mountain borders of the recently established Kingdom of Italy to soldiers recruited locally. Indeed, thanks to their knowledge of the surroundings and personal attachment to the area, they would be highly capable and better motivated defenders. Perrucchetti drew heavily on the work of Lieutenant General Agostino Ricci, who in 1868 had organised exercises in the mountains to assess the feasibility of a specialised mountain infantry corps. Five months after Perrucchetti's article, the first 15 Alpini companies were formed by Royal decree no. 1056. The units became active on October 15, 1872, making the Alpini the oldest active Mountain Infantry in the world. At first the Alpini were organized as a militia, capable of defending Italy's northern mountainous borders. Austria's surrender in the Austro-Prussian War of 1866 resulted in Italy annexing the province of Venetia, the northern borders of which coincided in large part with the Alpine Arch. Prior to gaining the new northern borders, homeland defence was based on the so-called Quadrilatero strategy. That outdated strategy, however, ignored the geopolitics of the new Italian Kingdom. It called for primary defence of the Po Valley region (\\"Pianura Padana\\") farther to the southwest, but left the Alpine region undefended (as it was considered a territory mainly unsuitable for military operations). Recruiting Italy's mountain valleys locals and organising them into a special corps was indeed an innovative idea. They possessed superior knowledge of mountain territory and greatest adaptability to Alpine conditions. At the beginning, the mountain regions were divided into seven military districts, each commanded by an Officer and home to at least two Alpini companies, each consisting of 120 personnel. Soldiers were equipped with the Vetterli 1870 rifle. In 1873 nine more companies were added, thus totalling 24. In 1875, the companies doubled in size, having 250 soldiers and 5 officers, which were then organised into 7 Alpini battalions. Each battalion was named after one of the seats of the seven military districts: : 1° Cuneo, 2° Mondovi, 3° Torino (Susa), 4° Torino (Chivasso), 5° Como, 6° Treviso, 7° Udine In 1877, five Alpini mountain artillery batteries were formed and - in the following year - the Alpini had already grown to 36 mountain infantry companies organised into 10 battalions. On November 1, 1882, the Alpini organisation doubled in size to 72 companies and a total of 20 Alpini battalions. The latter plus 8 Alpini mountain artillery batteries were now organized into six numbered Alpini regiments and two Alpini mountain artillery brigades. Each battalion was named after the area it was required to defend in case of war: {| class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" |- class=\\"hintergrundfarbe6\\" ! class=\\"unsortable\\"| Regiment !! Garrison/HQ !! 1st Bn. !! 2nd Bn. !! 3rd Bn. !! 4th Bn. |- |1st Alpini |Mondovì |10px Alto Tanaro |10px Val Tanaro |10px Val Camonica | |- |2nd Alpini |Bra |10px Val Pesio |10px Col Tenda |10px Val Schio | |- |3rd Alpini |Fossano |10px Val Stura |10px Val Maira |10px Monti Lessini | |- |4th Alpini |Torino |10px Val Pellice |10px Val Chisone |10px Val Brenta | |- |5th Alpini |Milan |10px Val Dora |10px Moncenisio |10px Valtellina |10px Alta Valtellina |- |6th Alpini |Conegliano |10px Val d'Orco |10px Val d'Aosta |10px Cadore |10px Val Tagliamento |} The numbers used earlier to distinguish the battalions were dropped while - at the same time - the companies were now numbered from 1 to 72. In order to distinguish the battalions, soldiers and non-commissioned officers were issued thread tufts of various colors (the Nappina), which were added to the Cappello Alpino: white for the First Bn., red for the Second Bn., and Green for the Third Bn. of each regiment. Special Bn. and Fourth Bn. were issued blue tufts. Soldiers of the Mountain Artillery units were issued a green tuft with a black patch in the middle onto which the number of the battery was written in yellow numbers. On June 7, 1883, the green flames (Italian: \\"fiamme verdi\\") collar patch was introduced, thus making the Alpini officially a specialty within the Italian infantry corps. The Cappello Alpino, with its black raven feather, was also introduced at that time. The distinctive headdress quickly led the Alpini to be nicknamed \\"The Black feathers\\" (Italian: \\"Le Penne Nere\\"). Officers hats had the black feather replaced with a white eagle feather. At first, the hat was a black felt hat, but as soon as the new green-grey uniform was adopted in 1909 the hat was changed to the distinctive grey felt still in service today. The Alpini were also distinguished by the green cuffs on the dark blue tunics worn for full dress and barrack dress until 1915, and by green piping on their light blue/grey trousers. When grey-green service uniforms were trialled by the Alpini in 1906, before being adopted by the entire army in 1909, the distinctive green collar patches and typical headdress were retained. The materials, weapons, and equipment of each battalion were stored in the major village of a specific area they were required to defend in case of war. Soldiers of a battalion were only recruited from that area. In 1887, the names of the battalions were changed from those of the defended areas to those of local villages. Therefore, e.g., the Edolo Bn. soldiers were recruited in the vicinity of that village Edolo - where the battalion's arsenal, training ground, and officer's housing were also located. Local recruitment generated strong bonds with and self-identification between the locals and the Alpini units, as men assigned to a single company were all recruited from the same village, and the companies from one valley were all part of the same battalion. In 1887 the Mountain Troops Inspectorate (Italian: Ispettorato delle truppe alpine) was established in Rome, and took administrative command of all Mountain troops. This led to the reorganization of the Alpini Corps: on August 1, 1887, the 7th Alpini Regiment was formed in Conegliano Veneto and assigned two battalions from the 6th regiment. The number of battalions had grown by two, thus reaching 22. On November 1, 1887, the 1st Mountain Artillery Regiment was formed in Turin with nine batteries, each equipped with four 75 mm howitzers. The resulting new layout of the Alpini Corps was as follows: {| class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" |- class=\\"hintergrundfarbe6\\" ! class=\\"unsortable\\"| Regiment !! Garrison/HQ !! 1st Bn. !! 2nd Bn. !! 3rd Bn. !! 4th Bn. |- |1st Alpini |Mondovì |10px Ceva |10px Pieve di Teco |10px Mondovì | |- |2nd Alpini |Brà |10px Borgo San Dalmazzo |10px Vinadio |10px Dronero | |- |3rd Alpini |Torino |10px Fenestrelle |10px Susa I |10px Susa II * | |- |4th Alpini |Ivrea |10px Pinerolo |10px Aosta |10px Ivrea | |- |5th Alpini |Milan |10px Morbegno |10px Tirano |10px Edolo |10px Rocca d'Anfo ** |- |6th Alpini |Verona |10px Verona |10px Vicenza |10px Bassano | |- |7th Alpini |Conegliano |10px Feltre |10px Pieve di Cadore |10px Gemona | |} ::: * (renamed \\"Exilles\\" in 1889) ** (renamed \\"Vestone\\" in 1889) === 1888 to 1914 === Although established as a defensive mountain warfare force, the 1° Battaglione Alpini d’Africa (1st African Alpini Battalion) was established in 1887. The battalion's four companies were composed of volunteers taken from all other Alpini battalions. As part of the Corpo Speciale d'Africa (Special African Corps), the battalion deployed to Eritrea to take revenge for the lost battle of Dogali. The battalion returned on April 27, 1888, to Naples, having lost its commanding officer and 13 men due to tropical diseases. Back in Italy, eight mules were assigned to each Alpini company in the same year. The Vetterli 70 rifle was replaced by the newer Vetterli-Vitali mod. 70/87 rifle. Also, based on a general reorganization of the Italian militia system, 38 Alpini companies and 15 mountain batteries were assigned to active units of the Regio Esercito (Royal Italian Army). In 1892 the Alpini were the first troops to be issued with the new Mod. 91 rifle, which was replaced in 1897 by the Mod. 91TS version and remained in service until 1945. When the tensions between Italy and Abyssinia escalated into the First Italo–Abyssinian War the 1° Battaglione Alpini d’Africa was reformed and sent to Eritrea again. It would soon become the first Alpini unit to engage combat. Four batteries of the 1st Mountain Artillery Regiment were also sent to Eritrea to augment the four deployed brigades under command of Oreste Baratieri. The battalions' first engagement was on March 1, 1896, during the Battle of Adowa. The Alpini were outnumbered and heavily defeated by Abyssinian troops. Over 400 out of 530 men died, including the commanding officer, Lt.Col. Menini. After the battle, the first Gold Medal for Military Valor (Italian: Medaglia d'oro al valor militare) was awarded to a member of the Alpini Corps: Capitan Pietro Cella and his Alpini from the 4th company occupied and held the Amba Rajo (English: Rajo Mountain) until March 2, thus allowing the rest of defeated Italian Army forces to flee. Capitan Cella and all his men died in the effort. In memory of their ultimate sacrifice, he has been awarded the Gold Medal for Military Valor (). After such a defeat, an Alpini expeditionary regiment with 5 battalions was formed and sent to Eritrea on March 7, 1896, but it saw little combat and was repatriated in June of the same year. During the 1900 Boxer Rebellion, a Mountain Artillery Battery was sent to China as part of the international relief force that lifted the siege of the International Compound in Beijing, and remained on garrison duty in Tianjin until the end of 1901. On November 13, 1902, after a short period of experimentation with skis the Alpini began to form specially-equipped and trained Skiing Companies (Italian: Compagnie Sciatori). After a heavy earthquake on September 8, 1905, in the Calabria region (Southern Italy), the Alpini deployed to the area for three months to assist in the clearance of debris and reconstruction efforts. They experienced a similar situation in 1908, after the devastating Messina earthquake. A massive expansion of the Alpini begun in 1909. On July 15 the 2nd Mountain Artillery Regiment was formed in Vicenza with four artillery groups and a total of 12 batteries. In 1908, two new battalions - namely the Tolmezzo and Pallanza (later renamed as Intra in 1909) - had already been formed and assigned to the 7th and 4th regiments, respectively. On October 1, 1909, the “Tolmezzo” and \\"Gemona\\" battalions from the 7th Alpini regiment, along with the newly raised Cividale battalion, became the three battalions of new 8th Alpini Regiment, based in Udine. The first commander of the 8th Alpini regiment was Col. Antonio Cantore, who would become a living legend to the Alpini during World War I. As the 8th Alpini regiment was formed, the Alpini could now count on 25 battalions organised into 8 regiments, 2 mountain artillery regiments with 24 batteries organised into 8 groups, and 75 reserve companies organised into 22 battalions. Reserve battalions were named after the valleys from where their soldiers, former Alpini, were recruited (also known as the 'Valle' battalions). {| class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" |- class=\\"hintergrundfarbe6\\" ! class=\\"unsortable\\"| Regiment !!

When Italy declared war on Turkey in 1911 in an attempt to conquer Libya, the Alpini units were once again deployed on desert combat. From 1911 to 1914, the Saluzzo, Mondovì, Ivrea, Verona, Tolmezzo, Feltre, Susa, Vestone, Fenestrelle, and Edolo battalions, together with the Torino-Susa, Mondovì, and Vicenza artillery groups, were deployed to Libya on missions of different duration. The first units to be sent to Libya were the Saluzzo (25 October 1911), Mondovì (3 November 1911), Ivrea (3 November 1911) and Verona (16 December 1911) battalions. When the unexpected Turkish resistance caused an embarrassingly slow advance of the Italian forces, reinforcements were sent to Libya. On October 18, 1912 Turkey and Italy signed the Treaty of Lausanne, which ended the war between the two nations. Italy, however, had now to face a full-scale rebellion by the local population, and required more troops than those deployed in combat to suppress it. Therefore, in October 1912 the Tolmezzo, Feltre, Susa, and Vestone battalions were deployed in Zanzur, Libya, and formed the 8th Special Alpini Regiment (Italian: 8° Reggimento Alpini Speciale) under the command of Colonel Antonio Cantore. The last Alpini unit to leave Libya was the Feltre battalion. It reached Italy in August 1914, while the Bedouin rebellion in Libya continued unabated. ===World War I=== Alpini in the frontline trenches on the Monte Corno Italian positions on Cinque Torri summit today. Col di Lana after the detonation of the Italian mine. During World War I the 26 peacetime Alpini battalions were increased by 62 battalions and saw heavy combat all over the alpine arch. During the war years the Alpini regiments consisted of the following battalions (the pre-war raised battalions are in bold; their reserve battalions, named after valleys (in Italian: Val or Valle), and the newly raised battalions, named after mountains (in Italian: Monte) drawn from the same recruiting areas as the original battalions follow below the pre-war battalions): {| class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" |- class=\\"hintergrundfarbe6\\" ! class=\\"unsortable\\"| Regiment !! 15px !! 15px !! 15px !! 15px |- |1st Alpini |Ceva Val Tanaro Monte Mercantur |Pieve di Teco Val Arroscia Monte Saccarello |Mondovì Val d'Ellero Monte Clapier | |- |2nd Alpini |Borgo San Dalmazzo Val Stura Monte Argentera Cuneo |Dronero Val Maira Bicocca |Saluzzo Val Varaita Monviso | |- |3rd Alpini |Pinerolo Val Pellice Monte Granero |Fenestrelle Val Chisone Monte Albergian Courmayeur |Exilles Val Dora Monte Assietta |Susa Val Cenischia Moncenisio |- |4th Alpini |Ivrea Val d'Orco Monte Levanna Pallanza |Aosta Val Baltea Monte Cervino |Intra Val Toce Monte Rosa | |- |5th Alpini |Morbegno Val d'Intelvi Monte Spluga Monte Mandrone |Tirano Valtellina Monte Stelvio Monte Tonale |Edolo Val Camonica Monte Adamello Monte Ortler |Vestone Val Chiese Monte Suello Monte Cavento |- |6th Alpini |Verona Val d'Adige Monte Baldo |Vicenza Val Leogra Monte Berico Monte Pasubio |Bassano Val Brenta Sette Comuni | |- |7th Alpini |Feltre Val Cismon Monte Pavione |Pieve di Cadore Val Piave Monte Antelao |Belluno Val Cordevole Monte Pelmo Monte Marmolada | |- |8th Alpini |Tolmezzo Val Tagliamento Monte Arvenis |Gemona Val Fella Monte Canin |Cividale Val Natisone Monte Matajur Monte Nero | |} The Alpini battalions fielded 264 companies of one captain, four lieutenants and 250 men each. The Alpini regiments were never sent into battle, but remained at their seats to continue training recruits. The Alpini battalions were grouped together in regiment-sized Groups (Gruppo), and the groups were attached to brigade-sized Groupings (Raggruppamento), which deployed the Alpini battalions as needed. The war, today known as the \\"War in snow and ice\\", as most of the 600 km frontline ran through mountains and glaciers of the Alps. 12 meters (40 feet) of snow were a usual occurrence during the winter of 1915/16 and thousands of soldiers were lost in avalanches. The remains of these soldiers are still being uncovered today. The Alpini, as well as their Austrian counterparts: Kaiserschützen, Standschützen and Landeschützen occupied every hill and mountain top around the whole year. Huge underground bases were drilled and dug into the mountainsides and into the ice of glaciers such as the Marmolada. Guns were dragged by hundreds of troops on mountains up to 3,890 m (12,760 feet) high. Roads, cable cars, mountain railroads and walkways were built up, through and along the steepest of cliffs. Many of these walkways and roads are still visible today, and many are maintained as Via Ferrata for climbing enthusiasts. In addition, along the former frontline it is still possible to see what is left of hundreds of kilometers of barbed wire. In this kind of warfare, whoever occupied the higher ground first was almost impossible to dislodge, so both sides turned to drilling tunnels under mountain peaks, filling them up with explosives and then detonated the summits, including its defenders, to pieces: i.e. Col di Lana, Monte Pasubio, Lagazuoi, etc.Percival Gibbon: FOUGHT TILL DEATH TO DELAY AUSTRIANS; Bersaglieri and Alpini in the Mountains Made Futile von Hoetzendorf's Plans New York Times, December 14, 1917 Climbing and skiing became essential skills for the troops of both sides and soon ski battalions and special climbing units were formed. It was during these years that the Alpini, their spirit and their deeds became famous. Most of the Alpini songs originated during this time and reflect upon the hardships of the \\"War in Snow and Ice\\". At the war's end the Alpini counted 114,948 casualties: 14,175 KIA, 61,620 WIA, 39,153 MIA (most lost in avalanches or to mine warfare). ===World War II=== An Alpino Corporal, Louis Celotti. ca. 1925 (note the Cappello Alpino under his left arm) After World War I all battalions with the exception of the pre-war battalions were dissolved. In 1919 the Alpini gained the 9th Alpini Regiment. In 1935 the fascist government of Italy reorganized its Armed Forces, creating five Alpine divisions and forming a new Alpini regiment: the 11th Alpini Regiment. A 12th Alpini Regiment was also formed to oversee the battalions of the 9th Alpini Regiment, which were not sent with the regimental command and the 5 Alpine Division Pusteria to fight in the Italian attack on Abyssinia. After the return of the 7th Regiment, the 12 Alpini regiment was dissolved. In 1941 the 6th Alpine Division Alpi Graie was raised with reserve units of the other five Alpine divisions. Thus Italy fielded the following six alpine divisions during World War II: * 1st Alpine Division Taurinense * 2nd Alpine Division Tridentina * 3rd Alpine Division Julia * 4th Alpine Division Cuneense * 5th Alpine Division Pusteria * 6th Alpine Division Alpi Graie WWII Alpino Della Mora Gelindo in Full Dress Uniform WW II Alpino Sergente Giovannucci Verino in Battle Uniform Each division consisted of two Alpini regiments with three battalions each, one Alpine Artillery Regiment with three Artillery groups, one Mixed Engineer Battalion, one Logistic Battalion and some support units. The strength of each division was 573 officers and 16,887 NCOs and soldiers for a total strength of 17,460 men. Also each division had almost 5,000 mules and 500 vehicles of various types at its disposal. The divisions saw combat in France, Africa, Italy, Albania, The Soviet Union, Yugoslavia and Greece. One Alpini battalion was employed in East Africa. In 1942, Tridentina, Julia and Cuneense division were sent to fight in the Soviet Union. In Russia, instead of being deployed in the Caucasus mountains as expected, the Alpini were tasked with holding a front on the plains of the Don River. As a result of this disastrous strategic decision, troops armed, trained, and equipped for mountain warfare were pitted in the plains against tanks and mechanized infantry, to counter which they were neither equipped nor trained. Despite this, the Alpini held the front until January 1943, when, due to the collapse of the Axis front, they were encircled by the advancing Soviet Army. The Alpini were able to break the encirclement in Battle of Nikolayevka and fight their way towards the new line of the front established after the Axis retreat. Only about one third of the Tridentina division (4250 survivors of 15,000 troops deployed) and one tenth of the Julia (1,200/15,000) were able to survive this odyssey. The Cuneense division was annihilated. during the campaign in Yugoslavia. After the Armistice of Cassibile between the Kingdom of Italy and Western Allies became public on 8 September 1943, Italy split in half. The king went to the South of Italy and left the Royal Italian Army without any orders. Subsequently, most divisions of the Army surrendered without a fight to the invading German forces. The only Alpini division to resist the Germans was the 1st Alpine Division Taurinense, which along with the 19th Infantry Division Venezia and remnants of the 155th Infantry Division Emilia resisted German attempts to occupy Montenegro. After suffering heavy casualties the divisions troops were given the choice to either surrender or to retreat into the Durmitor mountains and continue the fight. The 16,000 men, who had chosen to fight, formed then the Italian Partisan Division Garibaldi, which entered the II Corps of the Yugoslav Partisans and fought on the Yugoslav Front until it returned to Italy in March 1945. On June 25, 1944, the 3rd Alpini Regiment was recreated in Southern Italy with the battalions Piemonte and Monte Granero. Along with the 4th Bersaglieri Regiment it formed the 1st Italian Brigade of the Italian Liberation Corps, which fought in the war on the Allied side. After the Bersaglieri regiment had suffered heavy casualties the two regiments were merged on 30 September 1944 to form the Special Infantry Regiment, which entered the Legnano Combat Group. The Combat Group was equipped with British weapons and materiel and fought as part of the Polish II Corps on the extreme left of the British 8th Army near the river Idice. In the north a fascist regime under dictator Benito Mussolini, known as the Republic of Salò continued the war alongside the Germans. Its Army, the fascist National Republican Army, raised the 4th Alpini Division \\"Monte Rosa\\", which was trained and equipped by Nazi Germany.Jowett, Philip S. \\"The Italian Army, 1940-1945 (3): Italy, 1943-45\\" Osprey Publishing, 2001. .

Page 90 === Cold War === Structure of the 4th Alpine Army Corps 1986 (click to enlarge) Recruiting areas of the five post-war Alpini brigades After World War II the Alpini units were once more tasked with defending Italy's northern borders. On 15 October 1949 the Alpine Brigade Alpine Brigade Julia was activated in Udine; on 1 May 1951 the Alpine Brigade Alpine Brigade Tridentina was activated in Brixen; on 15 April 1952 the Alpine Brigade Alpine Brigade Taurinense was activated in Turin; on 1 January 1953 the Alpine Brigade Alpine Brigade Orobica was activated in Meran and on 1 July 1953 the Alpine Brigade Alpine Brigade Cadore was activated in Belluno. Each brigade recruited its soldiers from specific parts of the mountainous areas of Italy thus creating a strong bond with the local populations. But only in 1972 when the Taurinense joined the IV Army Corps all Alpini, Alpine and Mountain units of the Italian Army were finally under one command. * IV Alpine Army Corps ** 25px Julia ** 25px Taurinense ** 25px Tridentina ** 25px Cadore ** 25px Orobica After the 1976 reform the IV Alpine Army Corps was responsible to defend the Italian border along the main chain of the alps from the Swiss-Austrian-Italian border tripoint in the west to the Italian-Yugoslavian border in the east. In case of war with Yugoslavia the IV Alpine Army Corps would remain static in its position guarding the left flank of the Italian V Corps, which would meet the enemy forces in the plains of Friuli-Venezia Giulia. The only brigade which would have seen combat in such a case would have been the Julia. In case of a war with the Warsaw Pact the IV Alpine Army Corps had two war plans: one in the case the Soviet Southern Group of Forces and Hungarian Army would march through Yugoslavia and the other in case the Warsaw Pact would violate the Austrian neutrality and march through Austria. In case the enemy forces would come through Yugoslavia, the Julia would cover the mountainous left flank of the 5th Corps, which with its four armoured and five mechanized brigades would try to wear down the enemy before it could break out into the North Italian Padan plain. The other Alpini brigades would remain static. In the more likely case the Soviet and Hungarian divisions would invade Austria and march through Southern Styria and through the Drava valley in Carinthia the Alpini brigades would have been the first front line units of the Italian Army: the Julia would have defended the Canal valley, the Cadore would have defended the Piave valley and the Tridentina the Puster valley, while the Orobica had a special mission and the Taurinense would remain in reserve. == Today  Structure === Spike anti-tank missile, \\"Saluzzo\\" Battalion, 2nd Alpini Regiment 8th Alpini Regiment Heavy Mortar Platoon on exercise After the end of the Cold War, all but the Julia and Taurinense Brigades were dissolved, thus leaving the following Alpini units, that still carry the \\"fiamme verdi\\" collar insignia: * 25px Tridentina Division: ** 25px 15px Command and Tactical Supports Unit \\"Tridentina\\" * 25px Alpine Brigade \\"Taurinense\\" ** 20px 15px Command and Tactical Supports Unit \\"Taurinense\\" ** 20px 2nd Alpini Regiment 15px \\"Saluzzo\\" Battalion ** 20px 3rd Alpini Regiment 15px \\"Susa\\" Battalion ** 20px 9th Alpini Regiment 15px \\"L'Aquila\\" Battalion and 15px \\"Vicenza\\" Battalion ** 20px 1st Field Artillery Regiment (Mountain) 15px \\"Aosta\\" Mountain Artillery Group ** 20px 32nd Engineer Regiment 15px 30th Sapper Battalion ** 20px Logistic Regiment \\"Taurinense\\" 15px Logistic Battalion * 25px Alpine Brigade Julia ** 20px 15px Command and Tactical Supports Unit \\"Julia\\" ** 20px 5th Alpini Regiment 15px \\"Morbegno\\" Battalion ** 20px 7th Alpini Regiment 15px \\"Feltre\\" Battalion ** 20px 8th Alpini Regiment 15px \\"Tolmezzo\\" Battalion ** 20px 3rd Field Artillery Regiment (Mountain) 15px \\"Conegliano\\" Mountain Artillery Group ** 20px 2nd Alpine Engineer Regiment 15px \\"Iseo\\" Sapper Battalion ** 20px Logistic Regiment \\"Julia\\" with 15px Logistic Battalion * as part of other Military Commands: ** 20px 4th Alpini Paratroopers Regiment 15px \\"Monte Cervino\\" Battalion ** 20px 2nd Alpine Signal Regiment 15px \\"Gardena\\" Battalion and 15px \\"Pordoi\\" Battalion ** 20px Alpine Training Center 15px \\"Aosta\\" Battalion, in Aosta *** 20px 6th Alpini Regiment 15px \\"Bassano\\" Battalion (high altitude training), in Bruneck (South Tyrol) Collar Patches worn by Alpinis today === Geographical distribution === 4th Alpini Regiment in Afghanistan Alpini Sappers of the 32nd Alpine Engineer Regiment in Afghanistan Alpini from the 7th Alpini Regiment on exercise ===Armament=== Currently an Alpino is equipped with a Beretta ARX 160 assault rifle, usually fitted with an Aimpoint M3 Reddot, a Beretta 92 FS pistol, OD/82SE hand grenades, a Type III AP/98 (they are now slowly being provided with the newest NC4/09 bulletproof vest, phasing out the AP/98) bullet-proof vest and a 3rd generation night vision device. The squad automatic weapon is the FN Minimi or, alternatively, the Rheinmetall MG3. Supporting fire can be provided also by M2 Browning (0.50\\") machine gun, the Hirtenberger M6C-210 Commando 60 mm, man-portable light mortar or by the MO-120-RT-61 120 mm heavy mortar. Mobility is provided by the use of Iveco VTLM Lince 4WD tactical vehicles, Puma 6x6 Armored Personal Carriers and Bv 206 / Bv 206S all terrain tracked vehicles. The anti-tank weapons are the Panzerfaust 3 rocket propelled grenade and the MILAN 2 and TOW II anti-tank guided missiles. The later two will be replaced by the Spike anti-tank guided missile over the next years. In 1999 the artillery regiments have been issued with the FH-70 howitzer. This has led to a great increase in firepower compared to the previously used OTO Melara Mod 56 pack howitzer, but also reduced their versatility. Indeed, they are not designated now as \\"mountain artillery\\", but as \\"Field Artillery (Mountain)\\" regiments. Currently the Alpini are being provided with a small number of ARX-160 rifles to field-test the designated standard rifle of the Italian Army in harsh and cold environments. == Ranks of the Alpini == The Alpini share the ranks of the Italian Army but have an additional rank insignia on their Cappello Alpino uniform. All enlisted personnel and junior non-commissioned officers wear no insignia, only officers and senior NCOs wear them and special rank insignia are used by them in the form of chevrons increasing by rank until the rank of Colonel and by silver collar ribbons by general officers. Enlisted and Junior NCOs – No Insignia * Alpino * Caporale – Private E1 (Corporal) * Caporal Maggiore – Private First Class (Corporal Major) * Primo caporal maggiore – Lance Corporal (Corporal Maj. 1st Class) * Caporale maggiore scelto – Corporal (Senior Corporal Major) * Caporal Maggiore capo – Master Corporal (Chief Corporal Major) * Caporal Maggiore capo scelto – Lance Sergeant (Senior Chief Corporal Major) * Sergente – Sergeant * Sergente maggiore – Staff Sergeant (Sergeant major) * Sergente maggiore capo – Sergeant First Class Senior NCOs * Maresciallo – Master Sergeant (Marshal): 1 small plain green chevron * Maresciallo ordinario – First Sergeant (Ordinary marshal): 1 small plain green chevron * Maresciallo capo – Sergeant Major (Chief Marshal): 1 small plain green chevron * Primo Maresciallo – Command Sergeant Major (First Marshal): 1 green chevron with red border * Luogotenente – 1st Command Sergeant Major/Warrant officer (Sublieutenant) : 1 small green chevron with red border and a gold star * Primo luogotenente – Chief warrant officer(Sublieutenant 1st class): 1 small green chevron with red border and a gold star Junior and Field Officers * Sottotenente – Sublieutenant/Second lieutenant : Plain gold small chevron * Tenente – Lieutenant : Two gold small chevrons with blue border * Capitano – Captain : Three gold chevrons with two blue borders * Maggiore – Major: Three gold chevrons with one blue border * Tenente Colonello – Lieutenant colonel : Four gold chevrons with two blue borders * Colonello – Colonel : Six gold chevrons with three blue borders General Officers * Generale di Brigata – Brigadier General (Brigade General) : One bright gold star on the silver collar marking * Generale di Divisione – Major General (Divisional General): Two gold stars on the silver collar marking * Generale di Corpo d'Armata – Lieutenant General (Corps General): Three gold stars on the silver collar marking ==National Alpini Association== The ANA (Associazione Nazionale Alpini or National Alpini Association) is a registered society representing the \\"Veci\\" or former members of the Alpini corps. As the \\"Veci\\" see themselves as merely \\"on leave\\" rather than veterans, the ANA is colloquially known to be the 10th Alpini Regiment. Since 1920 every year ANA organizes a national reunion the \\"Veci\\". Hundreds of thousands of Alpini congregate with family and friends to an Italian city for a weekend in the late spring to celebrate and have a good time while remembering old times.Official Site of the National Alpini Association The strong spirit of cooperation typical for mountain peoples in the Alps, drives ANA to be not only a recreational association but a strongly involved one in Protezione Civile, alerted during natural disasters. == Hymn of the Alpini Corps == The Alpini Hymn L'Inno degli Alpini or Trentatrè - valore Alpino is the official hymn of the Alpini Corps, adapted from an old French mountain song by D'Estel and Travel. As the official anthem of the corps it forms part of the various songs and marches played by the Corps' military bands on parades and concerts, in the latter, the second to the last song to be played before the Italian National Anthem. I Dai fidi tetti del villaggio i bravi alpini son partiti, mostran la forza ed il coraggio della lor salda gioventù. Son dell'Alpe i bei cadetti, nella robusta giovinezza dai loro baldi e forti petti spira un'indomita fierezza. Chorus (2x) Oh valore alpin! Difendi sempre la frontiera! E là sul confin tien sempre alta la bandiera. Sentinella all'erta per il suol nostro italiano dove amor sorride e più benigno irradia il sol. II Là tra le selve ed i burroni, là tra le nebbie fredde e il gelo, piantan con forza i lor picconi le vie rendon più brevi.

Australia's Special Operations Command is of equivalent status to Australia's Fleet, Forces and Air Commands. It is modelled on the equivalent commands in the United States and British military forces, and is led by a major general as Special Operations Commander Australia (SOCAUST). The origins of SOCOMD began in 1979 with the army creating a small Directorate Special Action Forces—Army. On 13 February 1990, Headquarters Special Forces was established, which was renamed in 1997 to Headquarters Special Operations and in 2003 to Special Operations Headquarters or SOCOMD. ==History== A Special Operations Task Group patrol in Afghanistan in October 2009 *East Timor (May 2006 – 2007) *Security for the 2006 Commonwealth Games in Melbourne (March 2006) *Afghanistan (2001–02) (2005–06) (2007–) *Iraq (2003–09) (2014–) *Security for the 2003 Rugby World Cup (October – November 2003) *Security for President George W.

Most commonly, they represent unions in a given geographical area, whether at the district, city, region, or provincial or state level. They may also be based on a particular industry rather than geographical area, as for example, in the Maritime Council of Australia which co-ordinated the waterfront and maritime unions involved in the 1890 Australian Maritime Dispute. Affiliates of labour councils are trade union branches or locals, and occasionally other labour movement organisations. Citywide or provincial councils may have district or regional labour council affiliates as well as trade unions. Some labour councils restrict their membership to organisations which are affiliated with a particular national trade union federation, such as many state-level labour councils in the United States, which are chartered from the AFL-CIO national confederation. Finances are usually obtained through an affiliation fee, often based on a per capita tax on the membership of affiliates. In Australia, Trades and Labour Councils often have their own hall and offices known as a Trades Hall, with the term Trades Hall often used as a colloquial expression for the Labour Council or Trades Hall Council. ==Note on usage== Labour councils are a widespread phenomenon, but are given different names in different English-speaking areas. Labour Council is most common in Canada and Australia, Labor Council is used in the (USA) and Trades Council, Trades Union Council or Trades and Labour Council in the United Kingdom (and until recently was widespread in Australia) and some other countries. Another term sometimes used is Industrial Council, as in for example, the Barrier Industrial Council of Broken Hill in Australia. National associations of trade unions, such as British Trade Union Congress may also be considered a labour council, though the term often implies a primarily local organisation. ==History== Labour Councils were formed to meet a need to co-ordinate trade union activity in a geographical region. The earliest examples of this form of organisation can be found in the medieval craft guilds and Craft halls that developed in European cities. An example of this is the historic Glasgow Trades Hall wherein the 14 Incorporated Trades of Hammermen, Tailors, Cordiners, Maltmen, Weavers, Bakers, Skinners, Wrights, Coopers, Fleshers, Masons, Gardeners, Barbers, Bonnetmakers & Dyers yearly elected members of the Trades House, headed by the Deacon Convener of the Trades: :The Trades House of Glasgow was created at the time of reform of Glasgow's local government in 1605. At that time the electorate was basically divided into two groups, the Merchants and the Craftsmen. The Craft Incorporations or Guilds comprised the trades Rank of Burgesses under the leadership of the deacon convener, who was given a council. This included the Craft leaders and is the body we now recognise as the Trades House. The trade union activity of the late nineteenth century in particular spurred the establishment of Labour Councils and Trades Councils acrossing North America, Australia and Britain. Some notable events in the history of labour councils include: * 1791 - 1794 - Glasgow Trades Hall built to serve as a public hall and meeting place for the city's Trades House and 14 Incorporated Crafts * 1834 - attempt to establish the Grand National Consolidated Trades Union in Britain * 1848 - first Liverpool Trades Council founded * 1856 - Melbourne Trades Hall Committee formed. Now known as Victorian Trades Hall Council * 1858 - Sheffield Trades Council and Glasgow Trades Council founded * 1859 - Melbourne Trades Hall opened in May. Edinburgh Trades Council and Bolton Trades Council founded * 1860 - London Trades Council and Leeds Trades Council founded * 1861 - Dundee Trades Union Council founded * 1864 - Manchester and Salford Trades Council formed. * 1868 - First Trades Union Congress called by Manchester and Salford Trades Council in Manchester, with invitations being sent to \\"trades councils and other similar federations of trade societies\\" only. * 1871 - Trades & Labor Council of Sydney formed. * 1893 - San Francisco Labor Council chartered. * 1895 - Trades Union Congress (Britain) restricted to unions, with trades councils excluded altogether to avoid dual representation. * 1926 - In Britain, Trades Councils play a prominent role in organising the General Strike ==See also== * Bourses du travail in France * Trades Hall * Trade union * National trade union centre (or labour federation) * Labour history ==External links== * Glasgow Trades Hall history * What is a trade union council?

It is located approximately five miles from Middleburg in the Loudoun Valley close to the Fauquier County border. ==History== Founded in about 1740 by Quakers who had migrated down from Pennsylvania, via Maryland and across the Potomac to the fertile farmlands of Northern Virginia, the village and its surrounds - later to become known as Union, and then Unison - was referred to as \\"Greenland\\" or \\"Butterland\\" in early 1800s deeds. The name \\"Butterland\\" was said to have come about as a nod to the Royal taxes at the time being collected in pounds of butter, rather than coin.Unison Preservation Society - History of Unison - website: unisonva.org/history.html In 1813 Virginia's General Assembly chartered the village as the Town of Union. That same year the federal government established the Union Post Office, discontinued twice in its early years, from 1820-1824, and in 1828. The post office was reestablished in 1829 under Union's new name of Unison which was forced on the town largely because Monroe Court House in Monroe County, Virginia had taken the name Union a few years prior, even though its own post office had been established 4 years after Loudoun's Union post office. Unfortunately for Loudoun's Union, Monroe County got preferred treatment because their courthouse was situated in their town of Union.Eugene Scheel, Loudoun Times Mirror, \\"Unison Name Change Confused\\", published 10/8/1989 By the 1830s Unison was the 4th largest town in Loudoun County. Yardley Taylor, writing for Joseph Martin's Gazetteer of Virginia in 1835, used the old name \\"Union\\" to identify Unison and counted 25 dwellings, 3 houses of worship, a school, 2 general stores, a blacksmith, and a tavern. Among the 135 inhabitants there were a number of professionals including a lawyer and 3 physicians. As the prospect of a civil war loomed on the horizon at the opening of the 1860s, the last vote of the Unison Precinct on May 23, 1861 - a count to affirm Virginia's secession from the Federal Union - was 150-0, the largest shutout vote for secession in the county. All the Quaker pacifists had remained home during the voting, so their voices against secession remained silent. Between October 31 and November 2, 1862, the village was the scene of several skirmishes between Confederate cavalry under J.E.B. Stuart and Union cavalry, infantry and artillery in what is now known as the Battle of Unison. Because Stuart's delaying tactics at Unison cost the Federals time, a major portion of Lee's force had crossed the Blue Ridge, reached Culpeper and now had time to regroup and prepare for the next major encounter between the two sides at Fredericksburg. Lee's army and his capital were saved. On November 5, 1862, the New York Times correspondent reported \\"Stuart . . . balked what might have been a splendid success\\". After the war Unison remained Loudoun County's 4th largest town for only a few more years. By the late 1870s towns along the railroad line running through western Loudoun County, which missed Unison by 8 miles, saw their populations boom, and soon outstripped Unison in both commercial and population importance. Unison's post office remained until 1919 when the mails were discontinued to the town, the post office was closed, and mail delivery moved to the post office in nearby town of Round Hill which was served by the Washington and Old Dominion Railroad. However, even into the middle of the 20th century, Unison maintained itself as a viable town with its own churches, general store, and a saddle shop, and even a baseball team that played in the Loudoun baseball leagues. By the 1980s the town had been in decline, too far away from the new highways that now carried the bulk of Loudoun's commerce and population. By the 1990s the town had become little more than a sleepy residential enclave with only 50 permanent residences and 14 or so houses. The last retail enterprise, the Unison Store, a general store that had been in continuous business since 1880, closed in August 1996.Linda Wheeler, Washington Post, \\"In Unison Lies Strength of History\\", published 12/8/2002 In 2001 the vacant Unison Store building was being considered by a buyer as a tear down. This news prompted a local gathering of residents to attempt to save the building. They formed a 501[c]3 non-profit group, incorporated as \\"The Unison Preservation Society\\", their stated goal to help protect and preserve the historic village and surrounding countryside of Unison. As a result of their efforts Unison was placed on the Virginia Landmarks Register in 2002 as the Unison Historic District, and on the National Register of Historic Places in 2003. The store was purchased at highest bid by a local business at a public auction in 2001, and the building subsequently renovated. It was used as an office business until April 2013 when the building was again sold. It was purchased this time by a local philanthropist, Dr. Betsee Parker, owner of Huntlands, who then gifted the building to the Unison Preservation Society. The old Unison Store is now a community center, serving the village and the surrounding area. On Sept. 22, 2011, due to the successful efforts of the Unison Preservation Society's research and documentation into the important historical significance of the battles and skirmishes that took place in and around the Unison area, Virginia added further buildings and acreage to the Virginia Landmarks register and nominated the 8,000-acre Unison Battlefield Historic District for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places.https://www.dhr.virginia.gov/registers/Counties/Loudoun/053-6087_Unison_Battlefield_HD_2011_NRHP_FINAL.pdf The population count of Unison is now about 30, greatly outnumbered by the horses in the surrounding farms. The village contains a single United Methodist Church, and a number of private home businesses. == References  External links == *Unison Preservation Society Category:Unincorporated communities in Loudoun County, Virginia Category:Washington metropolitan area Category:Unincorporated communities in Virginia ","title":"Unison, Virginia"},{"id":"1999244","text":"Wende may refer to: *Die Wende (1989-1990), the historical period around German reunification. *Wende Museum, a museum and educational institution in Culver City, California, United States *Wende, Alabama, an unincorporated community in Russell County, Alabama, United States *Wende, New York, a hamlet in the town of Alden in Erie County, New York, United States **Wende Correctional Facility, a maximum security prison *Wende Station, a station on the Taipei Metro in Taiwan *Wende–Bauckus syndrome or Pegum syndrome, a medical condition *Wende horn, a runic symbol *Wende (album), a 1976 Ran Blake recording ==People== *Wende (singer) or Wende Snijders (born 1978), Dutch singer *Empress Wende or Empress Zhangsun, (601–636), of the Tang dynasty China *Bruno Wende (1859–1929), American soldier who received the Medal of Honor *Daniel Wende (born 1984), German figure skater *František Wende (1904–1968), Czechoslovak skier *Gottfried H.

In the 2006–07 season he won the Stanley Cup as a member of the Anaheim Ducks. He currently works with the Vegas Golden Knights broadcast team and as an NHL analyst with AT&T; SportsNet Rocky Mountain. May was born in Toronto, Ontario, but grew up in Markham, Ontario. ==Playing career== May was drafted by the Buffalo Sabres, 14th overall, in the 1990 NHL Entry Draft. While not a prolific scorer, May contributed to Sabres history in his second full season with the team. In Game 4 of the opening round of the 1993 Stanley Cup playoffs against the Boston Bruins, the teams were tied at 5 and required overtime to decide a winner. May took a pass from a falling Pat LaFontaine at center ice, deked past Ray Bourque, then went on goal where he faked out Andy Moog, which caused him to fall and leave an open space for May to score on a wrist shot. The goal not only won the game but secured Buffalo's upset of the second-best team in the NHL. The goal is referred to informally as the \\"Mayday goal\\", thanks to the following call from Sabres voice Rick Jeanneret: He was later traded by the Sabres to the Vancouver Canucks for forward Geoff Sanderson on February 5, 1998. After sitting out during the 2004–05 NHL Lockout, May signed with the Colorado Avalanche as an unrestricted free agent for two years on August 20, 2005. May's signing caused much conjecture and debate in Colorado due to his role played in the previous season's Todd Bertuzzi and Steve Moore incident as a Vancouver Canuck. He was later traded on February 27, 2007 to the Anaheim Ducks for goaltender Michael Wall. The Ducks went on to win the Stanley Cup that year, and May had his name engraved on the Cup for the first time in his career. On July 4, 2007, May re-signed as a free agent with Anaheim for a further two years. In the 2007–08 season, May played his 900th career NHL game on November 16, 2007 and scoring his 125th career goal as the Ducks beat the Los Angeles Kings 6-3. May was selected during the year to ride on Anaheim city's float at the 2008 Tournament of Roses Parade to accompany and parade the Stanley Cup. During the 2008–09 season on January 7, 2009, May was traded from the Ducks to the Toronto Maple Leafs in exchange for a conditional 6th round draft pick in 2010. On April 8, 2009 May played in his 1,000th career NHL game against the Buffalo Sabres. It was no coincidence that the milestone came against the Buffalo Sabres, as he was purposely sat out for the previous game. On September 23, 2009, May was invited to try out for the Detroit Red Wings, reuniting temporarily with former Vancouver teammates Todd Bertuzzi and Dan Cloutier. May made his Red Wings debut in a pre-season game on September 25, 2009. At the start of the 2009–10 season on October 8, 2009, May then signed a one-year contract with the Red Wings. After posting 2 assists in 40 games with Red Wings May was put on waiver to clear roster room for Andreas Lilja on February 12, 2010. After clearing waivers and briefly contemplating possible retirement May decided to report to Wings AHL affiliate, the Grand Rapids Griffins, to play out the season. In an expanded role with the Griffins May scored 10 points in 17 games before he was returned to Detroit as a part of the extended squad for the playoffs. ==Post-playing career and broadcasting== On September 20, 2010, without an offer of a new contract, May effectively announced his retirement in accepting a position as a CBC American Hockey League analyst. Following the retirement of longtime Buffalo Sabres analyst Mike Robitaille after the 2013-14 season, May joined the Sabres broadcast crew on a limited basis before moving into Robitaille's slot in a full-time role for the NHL 2014-15 season. May was replaced on Sabres broadcasts by Martin Biron following the 2016-2017 season.http://www.buffalohockeybeat.com/martin-biron-joins-sabres-broadcast- team-analyst/ \\"He replaces former Sabres winger Brad May.\\" Beginning with the 2017-2018 season, May serves as an analyst for the Vegas Golden Knights with AT&T; SportsNet Rocky Mountain. ==IncidentsPhoenix Coyotes=== As a member of the Phoenix Coyotes on November 11, 2000, May was suspended for 20 games for slashing Columbus Blue Jackets forward Steve Heinze in the nose with his stick. Heinze would need nine stitches, but returned to ice quickly. After the game, May apologized to Heinze, who accepted the apology. At the time, the 20-game suspension was the fourth longest in NHL history. In 2002, May was arrested after assaulting a police officer and disorderly conduct at a nightclub in Scottsdale, Arizona. He was consequently sued by the police officer and in December 2005, was ordered to pay damages from a civil jury. ===Steve Moore=== May was also noted for allegedly putting the bounty on the head of the Colorado Avalanche's Steve Moore that ultimately resulted in the Todd Bertuzzi incident that essentially ended Moore's career. May was named in a lawsuit filed by Moore, but unable to prove conspiracy theories, charges were later dropped in Colorado as the case was moved to a Canadian court. ===Kim Johnsson=== May was suspended for three games in the 2007 Stanley Cup Playoffs for punching Minnesota Wild defenceman Kim Johnsson in the face during the final minutes of Game Four between the Ducks and Wild. Both teams were involved in a large scrum of fighting, pushing, and shoving. May turned around and without warning punched Johnsson, who was skating towards the scrum. Johnsson was knocked unconscious for a short amount of time. Johnsson was not seriously injured, but was hospitalized, and missed Game Five of the series. The Ducks would win that game and eliminate the Wild from the Playoffs. In an interview, May said that he intended to contact Johnsson to apologize and explain what happened. ==Career statisticsRegular season and playoffs=== {| border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"1\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"text- align:center; width:60em\\" |- bgcolor=\\"#e0e0e0\\" ! colspan=\\"3\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\" | ! rowspan=\\"99\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\" | ! colspan=\\"5\\" | Regular season ! rowspan=\\"99\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\" | ! colspan=\\"5\\" | Playoffs |- bgcolor=\\"#e0e0e0\\" !

Originally brought to market in 1988, the manufacturer, CP Kelco (a former NutraSweet subsidiary), sells Simplesse to food processors as a \\"microparticulated whey protein concentrate\\" in dry powder form, and recommends that it be labelled as dairy protein on food labels. Older versions of the product also contain egg whites. The protein is partially coagulated by heat, creating a micro dispersion, in a process known as microparticulation. It is due to the small particle size of the protein that the dispersion is perceivable as a fluid with similar creaminess and richness of fat. ==History== Simplesse began in 1979 as \\"a substance that gelled like egg white but crumbled like Styrofoam.\\" At that time, Shoji Yamamoto, an associate of Norman S. Singer at Canadian beer company John Labatt Ltd. in London, Ontario, brought Singer the whey protein substance. After sensing that it gave the taste texture of cream cheese, another scientist put a sample under a powerful microscope and saw \\"tiny spheres of protein rolling over each other\\" about a tenth the size of particles of powdered sugar. It was this particle rolling action that gave a smooth creaminess sensation. Another associate of Singer, scientist Nina Davis, worked for three years with Simplesse (then called microcurd) to adapt it to and incorporate it into many different food products. After Singer's boss observed that the product tasted like cheesecake, Singer filed for and received a United States patent for his efforts with the product. Labatt licensed the product to NutraSweet, a subsidiary of Creve Coeur, Missouri, United States chemical conglomerate Monsanto, in 1984. The product was given the trademark \\"Simplesse\\" in January 1988. An initial version of the product, approved for use in frozen desserts like low-fat ice cream substitutes by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), was introduced to the public about that same time as being \\"the first completely natural fat substitute.\\" The FDA approved a second version of the product in 1991 for use in salad dressings, butter, and baked goods. ==Product== Simplesse is a protein-based fat substitute derived from milk proteins that allows calorie reductions of up to 80 percent compared with foods that contain fat. Described in a United States patent abstract as \\"a proteinaceous, water-dispersible, macrocolloid comprising substantially non-aggregated particles of dairy whey protein,\\" Simplesse particles are so minute that a person's tongue perceives the texture of the substitute as being smooth and creamy. Its texture is due to its ability to form a colloid, similar to the way fat is dispersed in homogenized milk. It differs from other whey protein concentrate mainly by virtue of the principles of food rheology; it is produced by a mechanical, rather than a chemical process. However, when heated such as by frying, the ingredients in the faux fat begin to gel similar to egg whites so the product mostly is used in ice cream, butter, spread cheeses, sour cream and dips, oil-based products such as salad dressings and mayonnaise, and other products that do not involve cooking. ==Application== Simplesse is used in ice cream, yogurt, cheese spread, salad dressings, margarine, mayonnaise, coffee creamer, soups, and sauces. According to the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA), the common name of Simplesse for use in the list of ingredients of a food depends on the form of Simplesse used in the final product. If the Simplesse is made from egg white and milk protein, then the common name must appear in the list of ingredients as \\"egg and milk protein\\". The trade name \\"Simplesse\\" may appear in brackets following \\"egg and milk protein\\". An earlier suggested common name \\"microparticulated protein\\" is no longer required. If Simplesse is actually \\"whey protein concentrate\\", it may be described as either \\"whey protein concentrate\\" or \\"modified milk ingredient\\" (section B.01.010 (3) (b) item 7.1, of the Food and Drug Regulations) in the list of ingredients. In either case, the trade name \\"Simplesse\\" may appear in brackets following it. (09/MA/90; 20/MR/92; 06/NO/92; MA 25/94.) Date modified: 2012-09-21 ==Nutritional fact== Simplesse is digested as a protein, but due to the micro dispersion formed, it produces only 1.0 to 1.3 Cal/g as opposed to 9.0 Cal/g that produces regular fat. Consuming Simplesse gives the possibility of maintaining the rich texture of the product by avoiding the high calorie intake. Simplesse allows the consumer to feel satiety just as consuming a regular fat. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Official Product information * Category:Fat substitutes Category:Labatt Brewing Company ","title":"Simplesse"},{"id":"1999254","text":"Maria Chaput (born May 7, 1942) is a former member of the Senate of Canada representing the Senatorial Division of Manitoba.

An SZ class 363 is leading the train. July 2007. A bank engine (United Kingdom/Australia) (colloquially a banker), banking engine, helper engine or pusher engine (North America) is a railway locomotive that temporarily assists a train that requires additional power or traction to climb a gradient (or bank). Helpers/bankers are most commonly found in mountain divisions (called \\"helper districts\\" in the US), where the ruling grade may demand the use of substantially greater motive power than that required for other grades within the division. ==Historic practice== 1915 photo of a quadruple header (4 front locomotives) train with a rear helper, climbing the Denver & Rio Grande Western's grade up Soldier Summit Helpers/bankers were most widely used during the age of steam, especially in the American West, where significant grades are common and trains are long. The development of advanced braking systems and diesel-electric or electric locomotives has eliminated the everyday need for bankers/helpers in all but a few locations. With the advent of dynamic brakes on electric or diesel- electric locomotives, helpers/bankers can also be used to provide more braking force on long downhill gradients. Bankers or helpers were historically positioned at the rear of the train, in which case they also protected against wagons or coaches breaking away from the train and running back downhill. Also, in a pusher role, it was possible for the helper/banker to easily separate once the train had crested the grade. Once separated, the banker would return to a siding or stub so as to clear the mainline and get ready for the next train. A common practice with knuckle couplers was to remove the knuckle from the front coupler. The locomotive would be brought up behind the last car of the train while the train was moving slowly. The air brake hose would not be coupled. When the train no longer required assistance, the helper/pusher would slow, then reverse and coast back down the grade to its siding at the bottom of the grade. This practice was outlawed in North America after the end of the steam era. Special heavily constructed cabooses were sometimes used in helper areas. Ordinary cabooses were built as lightly as practical and might be crushed by the helper/pusher's force, which could be as much as 90 tons. The heavy cabooses allowed crews to avoid the time-consuming procedure of splitting the train just ahead of the caboose. photo of reinforced outside braced caboose. Pushers/helpers were commonly designed to provide extreme power for very short runs; as a result they could not push at full power for very far before steam pressure dropped. But if it could push enough to get the train to the top of the grade, then it could build up pressure while coasting back down and while waiting for the next train to come along. This practice was common in Europe. Since it was not possible to remotely control a steam locomotive, each helper had to have a full crew on board. Careful coordination was required between engine crews to assure that all locomotives were operated in a consistent manner. Standard whistle signals were employed to tell the helper crew when to apply power, drift or brake. A misunderstanding of signals by a pusher locomotive crew could result in a major wreck if the lead locomotive applied brakes while the bank engine was still applying power. The usual result was that the train would experience a violent run-in (an abrupt bunching of train slack), resulting in the derailment of part or all of the train. The town of Helper, Utah was named after these engines, as it was where helper engines were kept to assist on the climb to Soldier Summit. ==Modern practice== Nowadays helpers/bankers are often controlled by coded radio signals from the locomotive at the head end of the train, allowing one engineer (driver) to simultaneously control the helper(s) and the train being helped. If radio operation is not possible, electrical control might be used, by way of cables running the length of the train (especially in case of passenger trains). Alternatively, radio communication with the lead engine's driver facilitates manual operation, which is still the norm for bank engines at the end of freight trains in Europe. ===At the front=== In the UK, an engine that was temporarily attached to the front of a train to assist with the ascent of an incline was called a pilot locomotive. This differentiated it from the train engine(s) that powered the train to its destination. A train with one or more locomotives attached to the front may be described as a \\"double header\\", \\"triple header\\", etc., depending on the number of helpers/bankers even when this lash-up of power was used for the entire run. These terms gradually fell out of general usage as diesel locomotives replaced steam power, and are not used for the common assemblage of several power units. ===Mid-train=== In countries where buffers- and-chain couplers are used, bank engines often cannot be added to the front of the train due to the limited strength of the couplers; In the case of standard UIC couplers and a maximum grade of 28‰ (which is common e.g. for lines through the Alps), the limit is a train weight of 1400 tons; if a train is heavier, bank engines have to be added in the middle or to the end of the train in order not to exceed the maximum load for any coupler. Adding locomotives in the middle of the train has the distinct advantage of applying the helper power to only part of the train, thus limiting the maximum drawbar pull applied to the first car of the train to a safe level. The narrow gauge portions of the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad, in particular, used \\"swing helpers\\", which meant the helper locomotives were placed mid-train at a point where they were pushing and pulling an approximately equal amount of tonnage, said location being referred to as the train's \\"swing point\\". This was also done to balance out the \\"slack\\" in the train between the locomotives, the swing helpers, and the end train helpers just in front of the caboose. However, this arrangement requires splitting the train in order to add or remove the helper engine(s), which can be a time-consuming maneuver. However, on some American railroads it was necessary to an extent because operating rules required end of train helpers to be added at the end of the train, but in front of the caboose. This was done for the safety of the train crew riding inside the caboose. ===End of the train=== To be able to add and remove helper locomotives quickly, which is especially important in Europe due to the high traffic density, they are usually added to the end of the train. Normally they are coupled and the air hoses are connected, which is necessary for the air brake to work correctly e.g. in emergency situations, but in special cases trains are banked with uncoupled locomotives, which can be added or removed \\"in-flight.\\" In the UK it was a usual practice for banking locomotives to follow and buffer-up to a slow-moving assisted freight train without coupling (as demonstrated in archive films of banking on the Lickey Incline) before applying more power, thus precluing the need for a standing start. Following an accident in 1969 this practice was discontinued. This procedure is not performed in North America as it would violate Canadian and US safety regulations. ==Examples== The following are locations where bankers are, or were, frequently required. Note that different regions of the world express grades differently, commonly used are ‰ (per mill), % (per cent), or a fractional ratio. ===Austria=== * Arlberg railway (33‰) between Landeck and Bludenz * Brenner railway (25‰) between Innsbruck or Wörgl and Brenner Pass ===Australia==New South Wales==== * Willow Tree - Ardglen - 2.5% (1 in 40) * Murrurundi - Ardglen - 2.5% (1 in 40) * Cowan bank - 2.5% (1 in 40) (double track) (4 tunnels) * Georges Plains - Wimbledon - 2.5% (1 in 40) ** Tumulla - crossing loop on 2.5% (1 in 40) * Fassifern - 2.5% (1 in 40) - bank engine key interlocked with bank engine siding.

Formed during the late 1860s by Little Freddie, \\"Sheeny\\" Mike Kurtz, and Johnny Irving, former members of the Italian Dave Gang, the Dutch Mob soon became one of the largest pickpocket gangs in the United States numbering around 300 members. Operating in the Manhattan neighborhood east of the Bowery, the area between Houston and Fifth Streets was known as a \\"pickpockets paradise\\" to the local press. A common tactic of the gang was to stage a street fight and pickpocket the gathering crowd. A variation of this technique was to have several gang members pick a fight with a victim where he would be \\"rescued\\" by other gang members posing as innocent bystanders and have his pockets picked while being rushed through the crowd. However, when Anthony J. Allaire was appointed precinct captain in 1877, police \\"flying squads\\" were sent to clear the district attacking anyone who was suspected or resembled a pickpocket or other criminal and by the end of the year few members of the gang remained. The same area would become home to another gang of mostly teenaged pickpockets, the Crazy Butch Gang in the late-1890s. ==MembersMike Kurtz=== One of the founding members, \\"Sheeny\\" Mike Kurtz (or Mike Whelan) jointly ruled the gang along with Little Freddie and Johnny Irving during the 1870s. He was eventually imprisoned at Clinton Prison and sentenced to 18 years and 6 months on March 30, 1880 although he was possibly later released on appeal. He would later have a successful career as a bank robber and jewelry thief with Irving during the 1880s and 90s before his death in New York. In 1894, Kurtz was arrested with \\"Dutch\\" Fred Ryder and ex-policeman Michael Malone in connection with the robbery of the Albert J. Knoll's Jersey Street saloon in Elizabethtown, New Jersey on April 2, 1894. The three burglars agreed to turn state's evidence against David McAdams, sportsman and manager of the Red Jacket Hotel, who they claimed arranged the robbery and hired them to rob the hotel in exchange for a percentage of the expected $800 in cash. ===Johnny Irving=== Johnny Irving (b. 1844-1883) lead the gang along with Mike Kurtz and Little Freddie and had a successful burglary career with Billy Porter during the 1870s and 80s. In August 1878, he and Porter were arrested on suspicion of robbing a Williamsburg dry goods store of $4,000 the previous month, however police were forced to release the two due to lack of evidence. After being under police surveillance, police were able to gain sufficient evidence after finding stolen silk and jewelry as well as burglar's tools and a combination safelock. Shortly after his arrest, the recovered evidence was linked to a recent robbery of a local flour merchant who confirmed that torn up checks and a safe drawer found at Irving's home were those stolen from his store. The following year, Irving and Porter escaped from Raymondstreet Jail after their arrest for the robbery of National Bank of Northampton. While Porter was arrested shortly after their escape, Irving remained on the run for almost six years until his arrest in Lawrence, Massachusetts on March 3, 1884. Irving was eventually killed by rival Johnny Walsh during a gunfight at a Sixth Avenue saloon owned by Thomas \\"Shang\\" Draper on October 19, 1883. Walsh was also killed during the gunfight. Porter was charged in his death, but acquitted. ==References== *Sifakis, Carl. Encyclopedia of American Crime.

The square was named after the giant statue of a golden Bauhinia blakeana at the centre of the area, situated outside the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre, where the ceremonies for the handover of Hong Kong and the establishment of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region were held in July 1997. A flag-raising ceremony is held every day at 8:00 am. It is considered a tourist attraction. The sculpture, a gilded flower bauhinia, is six metres high.

Born in Mazatlán, Sinaloa, she moved to the United States at eight years old, eventually graduating with a fine arts degree from the Juilliard School. She began acting in Broadway productions, making her debut in Paul Simon's The Capeman, and later ventured into film and television roles. Ramirez's breakthrough came with her portrayal of the original Lady of the Lake in the 2005 Broadway musical Spamalot, winning the Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in a Musical. She built on this success with her role as Dr. Callie Torres in Grey's Anatomy. Ramirez made her debut as a voice artist with the 1999 video game entitled UmJammer Lammy, and has voiced Queen Miranda in the animated series Sofia the First (2012–2018). She released her first single \\"Silent Night\\" in 2009. Her self titled extended play debuted at no. 37 on the Billboard 200 in 2011. Ramirez' extensive campaigns for LGBT rights won her the Ally for Equality Award from the Human Rights Campaign Foundation in 2015. She has also been the recipient of a Tony Award, a Screen Actors Guild Award, and a Satellite Award, among other accolades. ==Early life== Ramirez was born on August 31, 1975, in Mazatlán, Sinaloa in northwestern Mexico. Her father is Mexican and her mother is of Mexican and Irish-American descent. Her parents divorced when she was eight years old, and Ramirez went to live with her mother, eventually settling in Tierrasanta, San Diego, California. Ramirez's interest in music encouraged her mother to send her to San Diego School of Creative and Performing Arts, where she discovered her singing talent during an audition. Ramirez started acting in stage productions in high school. After having played such roles as the Witch in Into the Woods, Dolly in Hello, Dolly! and Miss Hannigan in Annie, Ramirez was recommended for the Juilliard School, New York City, from which she graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts (dramatics). At Juilliard, Ramirez further worked on her acting skills and trained as a vocalist. Ramirez speaks both Spanish and English fluently. ==CareerBroadway breakthrough and other roles (1998–2005)=== While still at Juilliard, Ramirez was discovered by a casting director and was offered the role of Wahzinak in Paul Simon's 1998 Broadway musical The Capeman. Based on the life of the Puerto Rican gangster Salvador Agron, the production garnered negative reviews, but Ramirez was singled out for her \\"outstanding\\" performance. She made her screen debut in the same year, with a minor yet \\"memorable\\" role in the romantic comedy You've Got Mail. Starring Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan, the film had Ramirez play Rose, a Zabars cashier who was \\"very serious about her line's cash-only policy.\\" Ramirez voiced the titular character of Lammy in the video game UmJammer Lammy, a spin-off of PaRappa the Rapper, on Sony's PlayStation console. She later reprised her role in the latter's sequel for PlayStation 2, but had a smaller role. In 1999, Ramirez appeared in Mark Lamos' The Gershwins' Fascinating Rhythm (1999).She garnered praise for her performance and received an Outer Critics Circle Award nomination for her role. Charles Isherwood of Variety praised her \\"beautiful, smoky voice\\" but was critical of her \\"torchy\\" performance of \\"The Man I Love,\\" which ignored \\"the wry irony that infuses Ira's lyrics\\". Ramirez then appeared in the 2001 Broadway production of Edward Kleban's A Class Act. She replaced Julia Murney (from the off-Broadway) to play the role of Felecia, the protagonist Ed's boss. The same year, she starred in other productions including Fascinating Rhythm and Dreamgirls, and then performed in the 2002 production of The Vagina Monologues with Tovah Feldshuh and Suzanne Bertish. During this time, Ramirez also appeared in guest roles in several television series, including NYPD Blue, Law & Order: SVU, Third Watch, and Spin City among others. Ramirez's breakout role came when she was cast as the Lady of the Lake in Eric Idle and John Du Prez's musical Spamalot. Based on the 1975 film Monty Python and the Holy Grail, the musical opened on Broadway in 2005 to widespread acclaim. Ramirez was singled out for her performance, winning several awards including the 2005 Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in a Musical and the Drama League Award for Distinguished Performance. Ben Brantley of The New York Times described her as \\"a toothsome devourer of scenery\\", and another reviewer for The Playgoer emphasizing their stage presence remarked, \\"Her intensity is totally serious and totally ludicrous and totally on key\\". An Entertainment Weekly review gave her the highest praise by calling her a show-stealer. ===Grey's Anatomy and other projects (2006–2019)=== After their success on Broadway, Ramirez joined the cast of the ABC medical drama Grey's Anatomy in a recurring role as Dr. Calliope 'Callie' Torres, a love interest for Dr. George O'Malley, in the show's second season. On a special Grey's Anatomy-themed episode of The Oprah Winfrey Show, they revealed that top executives from ABC, who were greatly impressed by their performance in Spamalot, offered them a role in any ABC show they wanted. They picked Grey's, as they were already a fan of the show. Ramirez further explained that at their initial audition, the producers liked them and intended to add them to the show but did not know whom to cast them as. They also said they were in awe of how the executives said, \\"Pick a show, any show\\", explaining that it is rare. The series creator and executive producer, Shonda Rhimes explained, \\"I was looking for a girlfriend for George, but it was in the infancy stages, so I had no idea what I was looking for.\\" Rhimes built the character around Ramirez after they met them Ramirez, who was initially given a recurring status at the time of the character's inception, received a star billing in the show's third season, alongside fellow cast member Eric Dane, who portrayed Dr. Mark Sloan.

Ramirez served as the main vocalist for the musical episode of Grey's Anatomy, \\"Song Beneath the Song\\", which on aired March 31, 2011. Marcus James Dixon of Gold Derby calling them the \\"show-stopper\\", wrote that they \\"stole the show in a gut-wrenching performance worthy of an Emmy award.\\" In May 2016, Ramirez left the show at the conclusion of the twelfth season, after having played the character for a decade. They released a statement saying, \\"I'm deeply grateful to have spent the last 10 years with my family at Grey's Anatomy and ABC, but for now I'm taking some welcome time off\\". As the series progressed, the character's popularity soared and Ramirez garnered widespread recognition and critical acclaim for their portrayal of a complex character on television. Maggie Fremont, a TV critic for Vulture, reviewed Ramirez and Jessica Capshaw’s performances during an eleventh season episode, calling them \\"goddesses walking amongst mere mortals\\". Rhimes wrote of Ramirez's work on the show, \\"Dr. Callie Torres came into our lives dancing it out in their underwear almost a decade ago, and I could not be happier or more proud of their journey. Sara Ramirez's performance inspired me as well as millions of fans each week.\\" Ramirez was nominated for Outstanding Actress in a Drama Television Series at the Alma Awards in 2007 and 2008. Also in 2007, at the 13th Screen Actors Guild Awards, the cast of Grey's Anatomy received the Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series.

They were married on July 4, 2012, in a private beachside ceremony in New York. In September 2016, Ramirez donated her hair to Locks of Love, an organization that makes wigs for children who suffer from medical conditions that lead to hair loss. Afterward, she sported a buzz cut, styled as an undercut. In October 2016, Ramirez came out as \\"queer\\" and bisexual at the True Colors Fund's \\"40 To None Summit\\" (now known as the \\"Impact Summit\\") in Los Angeles, California. In an email to The Huffington Post, she wrote that her decision to come out publicly was a \\"very organic and natural\\" one. In August 2020, Ramirez, said she identified as non- binary. She listed her pronouns as she or they on Twitter and Instagram. ==Off-screen workSinging career=== Ramirez released their first single, a rendition of Silent Night, in 2009. Their debut, self-titled, extended play came out in March 2011, on the iTunes Store under the label of Atrevida Records. The EP included four songs, including a cover of \\"The Story\\", which was originally recorded by Brandi Carlile in their 2007 album.

It was completed in late 2013 and officially opened on 30 June 2014, on the site of the former National Stadium, which was closed in 2007 and demolished in 2010. A centrepiece of the larger Singapore Sports Hub complex, the stadium hosts major association football matches, including the home matches of the Singapore national team. The stadium features the world's largest retractable domed roof and the configurable seating on the lowest spectator tier to make it the only stadium in the world that is custom- designed to host different sporting events at any given time. Depending on its configurations, the stadium has a maximum seating capacity of 55,000 for football and rugby, 52,000 for cricket and 50,000 for athletics events/concerts and is the largest stadium in the country in terms of seating capacity. The roof is made out of insulated metal to reflect sunlight. In addition to Singapore's home games, the stadium also hosts other sporting and cultural events, including the International Champions Cup and the Singapore Sevens. It hosted the 2015 Southeast Asian Games, the 2014 World Club 10s, the 2014 and 2019 Brasil Global Tour, and the 2016 Singapore National Day Parade (NDP). It is also one of the alternating venues of the Basic Military Training graduation parade for the Singapore Armed Forces recruits since September 2015. Since 2016, the National Stadium no longer hosts future NDP events due to high costs of the venue. ==HistoryConstruction=== Construction work for the sports hub started in 2010 due to the delays caused by the 2008 financial crisis and soaring construction costs. By September 2011, the pilling and the foundation of the stadium was completed and construction on the steelworks of the stadium fixed roof started. In July 2013, the installation of the stadium final primary steel 'runway truss' for the roof was completed marking the completion of the steelworks on the National Stadium's fixed roof in preparation for installation of the retractable roof. The stadium was set to be completed in April 2014, however, In February 2014, Sports Hub CEO Philippe Collin Delavaud announced that the National Stadium's completion was pushed back to June 2014. ==Stadium specifics and featuresSpectator seating \\"modes\\"=== The stadium has mechanised and automated configurable spectator tiers depending on the event that will be hosted, namely \\"Football/Rugby mode\\", \\"Cricket mode\\" and \\"Athletics mode\\". To reconfigure from the athletics mode to the football/rugby mode, the lowest spectator tier can be moved 12.5 meters forward, obscuring the athletics running track underneath the seats and thus bringing spectators close to the pitch to provide optimum spectator viewing distances. It takes approximately 48 hours to reconfigure seating arrangements to suit an upcoming event. An energy-efficient cooling system is also designed to deliver cooled air to every seat in the stadium while using less than 15 percent of energy as compared to a conventional air-conditioned stadium, providing every spectator a cool and comfortable time to enjoy an event. ==== Football/Rugby mode ==== Spectators at the World Club 10s Rugby on 22 June 2014 in the first sporting event held at the National Stadium. ==== Athletics mode ==== An estimated 11,900 spectators at the National Stadium for Tampines Rovers FC vs Selangor FA during the 2016 AFC Cup group stages on 10 May 2016. ===Dome and retractable roof=== 320x320px The National Stadium currently holds the record of the largest dome structure in the world. The retractable roof itself will take an approximate 25 minutes to open or close. The roof is made out of a lightweight material called ETFE, which is weather-resistant and blocks the sun's heat, giving shade and protecting spectators from the hot and humid Singapore weather and potential torrential rain. At night, the retractable roof doubles as a giant projector screen on both sides, which can display images such as the Singapore Flag during the National Day Parade. ===Stadium pitch=== Desso GrassMaster was installed as the original grass pitch when the stadium opened. The sandy pitch was criticised by Juventus manager Massimiliano Allegri during a pre-season friendly there in August 2014 and resulted in his decision not to field Carlos Tevez due to injury concerns. Afterwards, S$1.5 million of special growth lights were installed to stimulate and speed up the growth of the grass, with one of the main concerns being getting the pitch ready for the 2014 Suzuki Cup at the end of the year. In October 2014, Brazil coach Dunga criticised the state of the pitch, which had not improved much since the Juventus match, when his side were in Singapore to play a friendly against Japan. Although Brazil won the match 4–0, he said after the match that the sandy pitch had prevented his side from playing their best football. Eventually, the grass still failed to grow well and was replaced by the Eclipse Stabilised Turf in May 2015. ==TransportMass Rapid Transit=== The stadium is located above the underground Stadium MRT station on the Circle Line. Trains arrive every five to six minutes during off-peak hours, and two to three minutes during peak hours and event days. Other MRT stations nearby are Kallang MRT station which can be accessed using a sheltered walkway, and Mountbatten MRT station. The upcoming Tanjong Rhu MRT station will complement the existing stations once completed in 2023. ===Buses and taxis=== Bus stops are located around the Sports Hub complex along Stadium Walk, Stadium Boulevard and Nicoll Highway, with buses serving nearby districts and the city. Taxi stands are also conveniently available near the National Stadium, Singapore Indoor Stadium and Leisure Park Kallang. ==Criticisms== Sports Hub was meant to replace the Old National Stadium as a premium location for high spectator capacity Singapore sports, large scale national events and top entertainment acts, but its operation was marked by several controversies. === Pitch quality === The quality of the field pitch was put under scrutiny after the football match between Juventus and Singapore in August 2014, and again in October 2014 during the Brazil vs Japan friendly. The initial Desso GrassMaster system made of synthetic fibres and natural grass was widely criticised for its sandy nature and was replaced by the lay- and-play natural pitch in 2015. ===High costs=== Plans to hold major sports events at the stadium were scrapped due to the high costs of rental. Talks to hold The Merlion Cup football quadrangular and the Asia Masters Athletics Championships did not go through and the discussion to hold the 2016 NDP were stalled for a month due to cost issues as well. ===National Day Parade=== The old National Stadium was demolished to make way for the Sports Hub, which was seen as a possible new location for future National Day Parades (NDP) in Singapore. The venue hosted the NDP in 2016, two years after opening. However, the new stadium is considered unsuitable as the Singapore Armed Forces Parachute Team is unable to parachute into the domed stadium due to safety concerns. The dome structure also obstructs the view from outside, making the traditional military flypast and outdoor fireworks hard to observe for the stadium spectators. Heavy armoured military vehicles also cannot drive past spectators as the stadium tracks are not designed to accommodate them. It is also three times more expensive for the government to hold national day parade at the new stadium compared to the temporary floating platform, Float@Marina Bay, despite being a public-private partnership. Under the contract between the Sports Hub and Singapore Government, NDP organisers were allowed 45 days of free annual usage of the venue. However, technicians and performers reported that the time frame needed to be extended to 80 days, to which the Sports Hub requested an additional $10 million. In the end the total cost of running the event (rental) in 2016 was S$39.4 million. In October 2017, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong announced that the Marina Bay Floating Platform will be used as the primary venue for future NDPs. ==Events== thumb|Japan versus Brazil in football during the first sell-out crowd. 14 October 2014 |320x320pxThe National Stadium hosted the opening ceremony and other events during the 2015 Southeast Asian Games. Other sports events included the World Club 10s Rugby in June 2014, a friendly match between Juventus and a Singapore Selection side in August 2014, which was the first-ever football match at the new stadium. The friendly match between Brazil and Japan in October 2014 is the first-ever sell-out crowd of 55,000 at the stadium. It also hosted the 2014 AFF Suzuki Cup in November 2014. It is the venue of all the matches of the 2015 Barclays Asia Trophy that is held in Singapore. The stadium was the venue for the 2016 National Day Parade. From June 2014 onwards, the stadium will also host cricket with day-night One-Day Internationals and Twenty20 Internationals matches. International Cricket Council's Vice President Mustafa Kama indicated that there is a possibility of moving its headquarters from Dubai to Singapore, increasing the probabilty of hosting international cricket fixtures at the stadium. ===Concerts=== Concerts from artists outside Asia are highlighted in light blue. {| class=\\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\\" |- ! colspan=4| Concerts held at the Singapore National Stadium |- !

It provides several benefits over using a flatbed scanner to scan in a print of any size: the photographer has direct control over cropping and aspect ratio from the original, unmolested image on film; and many film scanners have special software or hardware that removes scratches and film grain and improves color reproduction from film. Film scanners can accept either strips of 35 mm or 120 film, or individual slides. Low-end scanners typically only take 35mm film strips, while medium- and high-end film scanners often have interchangeable film loaders. This allows the one scanning platform to be used for different sizes and packaging. For example, some allow microscope slides to be loaded for scanning, while mechanised slide loaders allow many individual slides to be batch scanned unattended. ==Dust and scratches== Dust and scratches on the film can be a big problem for scanning. Because of their reduced size (compared to prints), the scanners are capable of resolutions much higher than a regular flatbed scanner; typically at least 2000 samples per inch (spi), up to 4000 spi or more. At these resolutions dust and scratches take on gigantic proportions. Even small specks of dust, invisible to the naked eye, can obscure a cluster of several pixels. For this reason, techniques have been developed to remove their appearance from a scan, see film restoration. The simplest is the median filter, often called despeckle in many graphic manipulation programs, e.g. in Adobe Photoshop and the GIMP. It works by examining a pixel in relation to the pixels surrounding it; if it is too different from the surrounding pixels then it is replaced with one set to their median value. This and other methods can be quite effective but have the disadvantage that the filter cannot know what actually is dust or noise. It will also degrade fine detail in the scan. ===Infrared cleaning=== Infrared cleaning works by collecting an infrared channel from the scan at the same time as the visible colour channels (red, green, and blue). This is done by using a light source that also produces infrared radiation, and having a fourth row of sensors on the linear CCD sensor. Photographic film is mostly transparent to infrared radiation (no matter what the visible image contains) but dust and scratches aren't, so they show up in the IR channel. This information can then be used to automatically remove the appearance of dust and scratches in the visible channels and replace them with something similar to their surroundings. A major limitation of this technique is that it can only be used on dye-based (color and chromogenic black-and-white) films; the image-forming silver particles in most black-and-white film stocks are opaque to infrared radiation. Scanner manufacturers usually have their own name attached to this technique. Kodak developed Digital ICE at their Austin development centre, and is licensed by Epson, Konica Minolta, Microtek, Minolta, Nikon, and some others. Canon developed its own FARE (Film Automatic Retouching and Enhancement) system. LaserSoft Imaging developed the iSRD dust and scratch removal, on which among others Plustek is relying. ==See also== * Image scanner * Motion picture film scanner ==External links== * * . * .

It is usually held at the Float @ Marina Bay, various decentralized venues all over Singapore, Padang and the National Stadium. ==History== A scene from the National Day Parade, 1968, with a contingent from the People's Association in front. The flag of Singapore set up alongside pavements across the country Singapore celebrated its first National Day as an independent nation in 1966, one year after Singapore's separation from Malaysia on 9 August 1965. The inaugural National Day Parade was started in the morning at 9:00 a.m. that day. However, people came as early as 7:00 a.m. in order to get good vantage points. Singapore's first President, Yusof bin Ishak and Singapore's first Prime Minister, Lee Kuan Yew, were seated with members of the government at the grandstand on the steps of City Hall. When the parade began, six military contingents (including the Singapore Infantry Regiment, Singapore Police Defense Force and the then Republic of Singapore Police), a mobile column from the SIR, and various schools and civil contingents marched past City Hall and then into the city streets. Three military bands accompanied the parade inspection and later the march past with military music. The Singapore Fire Brigade also took part in this first parade with its firetrucks included in the mobile column. Rounding it all was a massed lion and dragon dance performance from drum and dragon troupes nationwide. The following year in 1967, the contingents increased to 76, including those of the then established Singapore Armed Forces, the RSP and more cultural groups, with the addition of more civil marching groups. The reason is partly due to the introduction of the National Service program in the military and police forces, and later extended to the Fire Brigade, later called the Singapore Fire Services in the 1970s. Street performances by various groups also debuted in that year's parade. The 1968 edition, although held on a rainy morning that surprised even the marching contingents and the dignitaries, saw the first ground performances on the Padang as the weather improved - a prelude to today's show performances. 1969's parade, the one where the Mobile Column made its first drivepast, commemorated the 150th year of the city's founding and had Princess Alexandra of the UK as principal guest. The fifth NDP edition in 1970 introduced the Flypast of the State Flag and the Republic of Singapore Air Force Flypast, as well as the combat simulation performance by Singapore Army personnel was one of the new highlights for that year. The 1971 NDP included iconic mobile parade floats from various organizations and choirs; 1973 was the first parade to be held from late-afternoon to early-evening time in order to promote the parade with better attendance. 1974's parade marked the first time the parade was broadcast in full-colour, after such television was introduced for the first time a month prior on 7 July. In 1975, to commemorate the Decennial anniversary of independence, the Parade was, for the first time, decentralized into 13 parade venues for more public participation. Almost all of the venues lasted for an hour and all of them even had route marches on the streets to the participating venues. By the time the NDP was held at the National Stadium (for the first time) in 1976, the NDP Guard of Honour, composed of officers and personnel of the SAF and the Singapore Police Force made its first appearance, followed after the parade proper by the very first evening presentations by various groups, a prelude to future evening NDPs in 1980 and from 1984 onward. 1977's parade was a decentralized event like two years before (and like 1968's was affected by wet weather) while 1978 returned to Padang. 1979's parade saw another decentralized site, this time being held in many high schools and sports stadiums nationwide. The decentralized format would later be used until 1983, which was the final time NDP was held in multiple venues until 2020. The 15th installment in 1980 was the first parade to introduce the feu de joie of the Guard-of-Honour contingents. The following year, SPF Civil Defense Command, presently the Singapore Civil Defense Force, later combined with the SFS in 1989, made its inaugural appearance, followed by the SCDF in 1982. The 1981 parade was held in both Jurong and Queenstown Sports Stadiums for further increase public attendance and participation in the celebrations. In 1982, the parade returned at Padang, marking the first time the mobile column drove past after the marchpast had concluded, thus making it a predecessor to the parades at the Padang from 1995 onward, once every five years. The 1984 installment featured many firsts in commemoration with the Singapore's Silver Jubilee of self-governance, which for the first time, introduced a theme song \\"Stand Up for Singapore\\", and included a bigger Mobile Column, the first appearance of the popular Silent Precision Drill Squad from the Singapore Armed Forces Military Police Command and the first evening fireworks display. The 1986 edition was the first parade held in the late evening, and the first to use flashlights for audience use. Other introductions were featured over the years such as the first appearance of the massed military bands of the SAF (1987), the card stunt (1988), and the Red Lions parachute team and the daylight fireworks (1989). In 1989, the parade was held in the afternoon but was later returned to the evening format used since 1986. In 1993, interactive participation by the public debuted in that year's edition to increase public participation and awareness of the parade as an important part of Singaporean life and as a symbol of national unity and identity. In 1997, a National Education Show was also introduced where Primary Five students from a selected number of schools attended in one of the rehearsals. In 2003, due to overcrowding of tickets, the electronic voting ticketing system was introduced as a countermeasure, and a ballot was conducted where citizens stand a chance at winning the tickets by registering their e-mail addresses or mobile numbers such as the NDP websites or phone lines. The 2006 installment marked the final time the National Stadium in Kallang was held before the stadium went for retrofitting works and thus relocating the parade to the new venue to The Float @ Marina Bay and held its inaugural parade the following year. Starting in 2008, the NDP is also aired all over the Asia-Pacific region through CNA, and since 2012, it was simulcast to other internet web-streaming websites such as Toggle, xinmsn (defunct since 2015), and YouTube (along with the parade's official channel, NDPeeps). 2009 featured, for the first time, an integrated show including the parade segment, known as the Pre-parade show (usually not broadcast on television). 2009 was currently the last time to feature multiple theme songs (English and Chinese versions, or originals) The 2013 installment featured a spin-off reality competition aired on Channel 5, titled Sing a Nation, which featured ten different groups who performed various songs for a chance at a lead performance for the 2013's parade. The 2013's theme song, \\"One Singapore\\", was also sung by the cast of Sing a Nation, and the song featured its largest ensemble, with 68 members. The 2014 installment also featured its first female Red Lion parachutist to jump at the NDP, Third Warrant Officer Shirley Ng, after their initial performance in 2013 was cancelled due to weather conditions. The 2014 parade was notable as it was the last parade with the attendance for the first prime minister Lee Kuan Yew, who was the only member to have attended in every installment of NDP since 1966, as he died on 23 March the following year. 2015's parade was the first parade to be held at both the Padang and at the Float @ Marina Bay, breaking a parade tradition in the process as it became the first parade since 1983 to be held in multiple venues. In 2016, the parade returned to the new National Stadium, first opened in 2014. Due to criticisms relating to budget and logistics, the following parade in 2017 (and later in 2018) returned to The Float @ Marina Bay to celebrate the golden jubilee for National Service. 2017 also saw the first time YouTube live-streamed the parade in a 360-degree format and on Facebook Live. The 2019 installment, which was held at the Padang again and breaking a trend of holding every five years to commemorate the bicentennial anniversary of modern foundation of Singapore in 1819, also marked the first time the parade was screened in ultra 4K resolution. Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in Singapore, the 2020 parade marking 55 years of nationhood featured a \\"reduced\\" split version by limiting rehearsals and performances and foregone both National Education and preview shows, and in which the parade will be broadcast remotely which consists of a pre-recorded morning segment (such as flying of state flag and F-15SG fighter jet display flying across the heartlands) and an evening live show (focusing most of the traditional national day parade performance, to be held at The Star Performing Arts Centre) with elements of the show segments of 1997 and 2011. The ceremonial events, just like last year, were held in the Padang, which had the first ever midday celebrations for the first time in many years, while the Mobile Column was once more present also in the heartlands areas. With several venues set to host the celebrations, this was the very first decentralized parade ever done since 1983, which like previous years had been also livestreamed worldwide via YouTube and Facebook. In a departure from the usual, CNA aired only the morning ceremony to millions of viewers with the channel's special holiday documentary taking the place of the evening show broadcast. The 2021 parade will likely be the last to be held at The Float @ Marina Bay before the venue undergoes redevelopment to make way for the new NS Square. ==NDP editions== The venue of the parade was once held at Padang, the site where of Singapore's independence was declared. Between 1966 and 1974, the venue was located in the central area to bring the parade closer to the people. In 1976, the parade was held for the first time at the Former National Stadium, where the much larger capacity allowed for more to view the parade live. Although offering about 60,000 seats in the National Stadium, the demand for tickets remained high, resulting in several attempts to decentralise the venue to bring the celebration closer to more Singaporeans. From 1975 to 1983, celebrations were alternated between a decentralised event and one centred at the Padang or stadium. From 1984, the parade was held twice at the stadium before being brought back to the Padang. This three-year cycle was repeated up to 1994, before it changed to five-years on an announcement in 1995. The Padang, although historically important, posed a greater logistical challenge and also offered fewer seats for spectators. The event and rehearsals also required the closing of surrounding roads. There was a need to construct temporary spectator stands around the field. The site, however, was the only feasible venue for the mobile column, as the heavy vehicles could not be driven onto the stadium track. The Padang was used as the main performance venue for the 2005 parade, with fringe activities decentralised to Marina South, Jurong East, Yishun and Tampines. Several alternate locations were mooted, including the utilization of the Padang, which is physically bigger and less likely to disrupt daily functions in the city. On 16 October 2005, it was announced that the 2006 NDP would be held at the old stadium for the last time before moving to The Float @ Marina Bay. The 130 by 100 metre platform would be used for the next five years until the new stadium is completed. Despite offering a seating capacity of only 27,000, almost less than half the capacity for the National Stadium, there was a vast area for about another 150,000 spectators along the Marina Bay waterfront. After a ten-year hiatus, the 2016 edition of NDP officially returned to the new National Stadium, and 2017 saw the parade returning to Marina Bay, therefore returning to a modified form of the 1980s parades. Given the huge public reception of the Marina Bay parades, The Float, it will be redeveloped starting in 2022 for future parades as a permanent parade venue, alternating with the Padang every five years (2020 was the first year to break the pattern since 1985, as the site previously held in 2019 prior because of celebrating the nation's bicentennial anniversary). The 2020 parade, first announced to return to The Float, will not take place as a measure enacted for safety reasons as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, with decentralized celebrations taking its place. {|class=\\"wikitable\\" |- !Year||Venue||Theme||Slogan/Tagline||Organiser !Creative Director |- |1966–1974||Padang|| || || | |- |1975|||Decentralised sites||| || || | |- |1976||National Stadium|| || ||2nd Singapore Infantry Brigade | |- |1977||Decentralised sites|| || || | |- |1978||Padang|| || || | |- |1979||Decentralised sites|| || || | |- |1980||National Stadium||Courtesy – Our Way of Life|||| | |- |1981||Decentralised sites||||Energy is Precious – Save It|| | |- |1982||Padang|| ||||2nd Singapore Infantry Brigade | |- |1983||Decentralised sites|| || || | |- |1984||Padang||25 Years of Nation Building, 1959–1984||Reach Out Singapore||3rd Singapore Infantry Brigade | |- |1985||rowspan=2|National Stadium|| || ||7th Singapore Infantry Brigade | |- |1986|| ||rowspan=2|Together...Excellence for Singapore||2nd Singapore Infantry Brigade | |- |1987||Padang|| ||3rd Singapore Infantry Brigade | |- |1988||rowspan=2|National Stadium|| ||rowspan=2|Excellence Together, Singapore Forever|| Singapore Artillery | |- |1989|| ||2nd Singapore Infantry Brigade | |- |1990||Padang||One People, One Nation, One Singapore|| 25 Years of Nationhood and Another 25 Years of Achievements||HQ Armour | |- |1991||rowspan=2|National Stadium|| ||rowspan=2|My Singapore||HQ Singapore Combat Engineers | |- |1992|| ||Singapore Air Defense Artillery | |- |1993||Padang||Nation on Parade||rowspan=4|My Singapore, My Home||HQ Armour | |- |1994||National Stadium|| ||7th Singapore Infantry Brigade | |- |1995||Padang||30 Years of Nationhood / A Nation in Harmony||HQ Armour | |- |1996||rowspan=4|National Stadium|| ||HQ Singapore Combat Engineers | |- |1997||Our Singapore, Our Future||NDP 1997 Musical Extravanganza||Singapore Artillery | |- |1998|| ||Our Singapore, Our Future||7th Singapore Infantry Brigade | |- | 1999||Our People||rowspan=3|Together We Make The Difference||6th Division | |- | 2000||Padang|| ||3rd Division | |- | 2001||rowspan=4|National Stadium||Building Bridges, Forging Futures||9th Division/Infantry | |- | 2002||A Caring Nation||rowspan=3|Together, A New Singapore||HQ Armour |Dick Lee |- | 2003||A Cohesive Society||HQ Singapore Guards |Glenn Goei |- | 2004||A Progressive Society||6th Division |Glenn Goei |- | 2005||Padang||40 Years of Nation Building||The Future is Ours to Make||3rd Division |Glenn Goei |- | 2006||National Stadium||Our Global City, Our Home|| ||HQ Singapore Guards |Glenn Goei |- | 2007||rowspan=3|Marina Bay Floating Platform||City of Possibilities|| ||HQ Singapore Combat Engineers |Goh Boon Teck |- | 2008||Celebrating the Singapore Spirit|| ||HQ Singapore Guards |Goh Boon Teck |- | 2009||Come Together – Reaching Out • Reaching Up|| ||3rd Division |Ivan Heng |- | 2010||Padang||Live Our Dreams, Fly Our Flag|| ||HQ Armour |Dick Lee |- | 2011||rowspan=4|Marina Bay Floating Platform||Majulah!

Even though there had been logos for some previous years' parades, the logos were used exclusively for years of special commemoration, such as silver jubilee of Nation Building (1984) and Independence (1990). Slogans have also be used, such as \\"Our Singapore, Our Future\\", first used in the 1997 celebrations. With the introduction of NDP logos for 1998, every logo henceforth would be designed to suit the themes, in particular the foundation theme of the parade. A tagline, which was previously known as a slogan, was usually added to the logo design. An example was in 2005, where the tagline for NDP 2005 was \\"The Future is Ours to Make\\", was placed on the theme \\"40 Years of Nation Building\\". These taglines are usually taken from previous National Day Rallies for the purpose of rallying the nation together on 9 August to meet the challenges ahead. The tagline \\"Together We Make The Difference\\" was introduced in 1999 due to the launch of the Singapore 21 project, and was replaced by \\"Together, A New Singapore\\" in 2002 when then-Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong proposed the \\"Remaking Singapore\\" initiative in the National Day Rally 2001. Most of the logos uses a majority of red color, however in 2007, blue has taken over the traditional red to symbolise the water around the Marina Bay area. Regardless, the logos are important to note that the themes and taglines are largely different; and it is the theme that the parade or Show segment, on in some cases (2009 and 2015), both will be based on. ==Parade sequence== Although the programme and sequence of the parade do change over the years, several components and the overall flow of the parade have remained intact for the past four decades. With the shifting of venues for some editions of the parade, or in cases such as wet weather, programmes may have to cancel or introduce slight modifications in order to suit the changes, for instance the Mobile Column, which is only possible both at the Padang site and at Marina Bay. ===Stage and backdrop design=Pre-parade=== The pre-parade segment today may include mass-displays, choir performances, school band displays, sky-diving displays, and other light-hearted performances to entertain the crowd prior to the parade proper, with the added positive effect of encouraging parade-attendees to be seated earlier. Initially introduced on an ad hoc basis as an informal filler, it has since become an integral part of the parade particularly when live television coverage was extended to this segment in recent years. As audience participation has become a part of the parade, the pre-parade segment also becomes an opportunity for the hosts to lead and rehearse with the audience actions they may have to do when the parade proper begins. Motivators from TOUCH Community Services were introduced to the pre-parade in 2002 (then called Anchor Talents). TOUCH Community Services has since moved on to mentoring students from the various Institutes of Technical Education (ITEs) and various Polytechnics since 2003 until the present, under the Leadership & Mentoring programme. Colorful costumes and dance moves have been designed for the motivators. ===Parade and ceremonies=== The parade has been a traditional segment of the National Day Parade. Participants of the parade include members of the Singapore Armed Forces, Singapore Police Force, Singapore Civil Defence Force, representatives of the People's Action Party, different labour unions (including members of the National Trades Union Congress) and Ministries as well as students in uniformed groups (such as the National Cadet Corps, National Police Cadet Corps, National Civil Defence Cadet Corps, the Singapore Red Cross, the Boys' and Girls' Brigades, the Scouts Association, the Girl Guides and St. John Ambulance Brigade) and representatives of various Singapore business entities. Participants are split into two main sections: the Guard-of-Honour contingents and the Supporting Contingents. The four Guard-of-Honour contingents are made up of members from the three arms of the Singapore Armed Forces (the Singapore Army, represented by the Best Combat Unit, for many years the 1st Commando Battalion of the Singapore Armed Forces Commando Formation; the Republic of Singapore Navy; and the Republic of Singapore Air Force) as well as the Singapore Police Force. All members of these contingents are dressed in their respective ceremonial uniforms, known as the No. 1 uniform. Behind the Guard- of-Honour contingents stand the Regimental Colours Party, where the 32 SAF regimental colours are held by a group of officers, known as ensigns, from the Singapore Armed Forces, with their armed escorts (until 1997 Service Regimental Colors from the SAF's three services led the colours party). The 3 State Colours are in between the Navy and Air Force Guard-of-Honour contingents, and are formed by Escorts (Specialists) and Ensigns (Junior Officers). The parade's military bands are from both the SAF and SPF, and in recent years, the marching bands of both services' cadet organizations (the Singapore NCC Command Band and the NPCC Band) have joined them as well, with the Singapore NCC Command Band being part of the combined band since 2010. Before the 1994 creation of the SAF Bands the different service arms of the SAF fielded their own bands, and the massed bands for the parade were, since the early 1970s, from a select band of the SAF and the Singapore Police Force Band (inter-service massed bands would only happen in 1987). The parade traditionally starts with the Parade Regimental Sergeant Major (Parade RSM) forming up the parade on either the Padang, the field of the National Stadium or in front of the Marina Bay grandstand. The command of the parade is handed over to the Parade Commander once the parade has been formed up and properly dressed accordingly. Typically, both the Parade RSM and the Parade Commander come from the SAF, and usually hold a minimum rank of Master Warrant Officer, and Lieutenant Colonel respectively. Upon sizing and forming up the parade to full formation, the Parade Commander will wait for the arrival of the members of Parliament, members of the Cabinet and the Prime Minister of Singapore, in that order (the salutes were dropped partially in 2008, and the Prime Minister's salute was dropped the next year). Upon the arrival of each group, the parade will present its salute and present arms, except for the Parliament and Cabinet members, upon which they stand at attention and only the PC salutes them. Lastly once the President of Singapore has arrived (after the playing of the Presidential Fanfare by the Fanfare Trumpeters of the SAF), the Parade Commander will call for a full (Presidential) salute, during which the National Anthem, Majulah Singapura, will be played accompanied by a fly-past of the State Flag, and from 2011, would also require raising it as well on a separate flagpole. After that (and the following aerial salute by the RSAF), the Parade Commander will request that the President inspects the parade. During this inspection, the President will be accompanied by the Chief of Defence Force and the Parade Commander, and the Army GOH Contingent Commander would later join them once they approach the Guard-of-Honour (recent parades have seen a motorized inspection by the President while riding a Land Rover). A presidential 21-gun salute is also given to the President during this time by a select battery from the Singapore Artillery. It is customary that the President speaks to some members of the Guard-of-honor contingents as he/she passes by. After the inspection ends, the President will return to the podium before the Guard-of-honor contingents presents a Feu-de-Joie led by the Parade Commander. At the end of it (with the GOH contingents now at shoulder arms), the Parade Commander will ask the President for permission for the Parade Marchpast to start. 2012's edition formally included an Advance in Review order to the proceedings for the first time. ====Marchpast==== The Parade Commander will command the Parade contingents to prepare for the Marchpast, and will then march out of the Parade Grounds, with the bands bringing the rear. In the National Day Parade 2009, there was a City Marchpast where the contingents marched around the Central Business District, with the march ending at the F1 Pit Building. In the National Day Parade 2010, the City Marchpast made its second appearance and this time the Marina Bay area was the venue for this, with the Marina Padang as the final stop on the march past. 2011 saw the reinstatement of the march through the stands moment of the supporting contingents of the SAF, SPF and SCDF (previously done in the 2002 edition and now called the Onward March), and that year the participants of the youth uniformed groups and the civilian contingents marched out in a different way, only for all of them to reunite for the City Marchpast later on. The 2012 edition of the parade, the very first National Day Parade officiated by the President Tony Tan Keng Yam, had the Onward March which was now done for the second time by all of the youth uniformed groups present while the military and civilian supporting contingents marched out in a different way similar to the march pasts during the 2000 and 2010 editions with all of them rejoining for the City Marchpast to be done later with the GOH contingent battalion to Marina Bay Sands where the march ended. The Onward March made yet another appearance in the 2014 edition alongside the City Marchpast after the parade proper towards the MBS complex. The City Marchpast made its sixthth consecutive appearance in the 2015 edition and was carried on in 2016 together with the Onward March from the new National Stadium and again from Marina Bay in 2017 and 2018. In recent years the order of the march past of the supporting contingents out of the grounds has been altered, with the military and civil uniformed services first to march out, followed by the economic firms, social organizations and the youth uniformed organizations which march last out and then into the platform stands. ====Mobile column, flypast and defence exposition==== The first Mobile Column was organized in 1969 which displayed the then newly acquired armour vehicles of the SAF, the RSP's police vehicles and the SCDF's fire trucks. In 1990, after a six-year hiatus, the Mobile Column returned as part of the silver jubilee of Singapore's independence. It has been on show during the more important milestone anniversaries of the nation's birthday, on parades held in Padang every five years, including 2019, 2020 and 2025. In 2019 and 2020, the vehicles forming the column drove across various areas of the city-state, letting residents and visitors see the equipment upclose in their communities as the column would drive thru their homes and workplaces. Almost every NDP since 1971 (except 2016) has had a flypast segment featuring jet and training aircraft, transports and helicopters from the Republic of Singapore Air Force. Whenever the NDP is held at The Float in Marina Bay the Mobile Column and flypast both evolve into the multi-platform and multi-service Dynamic Defence Display (D3), with a display of the military defence and public security capabilities of the uniformed services. In lieu of the 2018 D3, as part of the parade and ceremony segment of the program, a special flypast of the RSAF was held in that year's edition to mark its golden jubilee. ===Show segment==Highlights==== The spectacular show segment follows the traditional parade and ceremony, and lasts normally for 45 minutes. Following the theme of the parade that year, the Show will feature (aside from a Prologue in recent editions) three to four main Acts that culminates in a Grand Finale, that will usually feature the theme song of that year's parade, followed by the much anticipated fireworks display. The entire parade will end in a chorus of voices singing familiar National Day Songs, mass pledge taking (from 2009 expanded into a national activity) and the singing of the National Anthem. In 2007, the parade broke tradition for having a fireworks display that synchronized with the Sing Singapore medley in the finale. In 2009, for the first time ever, all the segments of the NDP have been merged into one integrated program; this would later be repeated in 2015. It has its origins in early NDPs as various mass display items put up by community groups or schools to add colour to the otherwise military parade. These items revolved around the themes of racial harmony, ruggedness among youths etc., which are represented by ethnic dances and mass gymnastics displays. This section evolved over the years to become more theatrical, from the massive flashcard displays that complemented the parade in the 1980s to multimedia projections in recent Shows. Float displays also featured prominently in the Show segments of the 1970s and 1980s where floats were designed to promote government campaigns or highlight the works of various public and private companies. This returned in NDP 1998 and in NDP 2005 as a visual representation of Singapore's past 40 years of nation building, with further reappearances at NDP 2009 and at NDP 2010 to symbolize the mixture of peoples that make up Singapore today. Floats would return in the 2015, 2017 and 2019 editions. Boats and floats on the Marina Bay area in view of the crowds were one of the highlights of the 2018 show segment. Parades today, held from dusk to night, end in the climax of fireworks displays which have become a prominent feature in every parade, which followed by a medley of songs and then reciting the pledge and singing \\"Majulah Singapura\\". However, in the early parades that were held in the day (from 1965–72) and later afternoon to evening NDP editions from 1973 to 1980, 1982 and 1984, mass lion and dragon dance displays are actually the parade finale. Lion and dragon dance troupes from various community centres and clan associations would gather on the field to the resonating sound of drumbeats to put on a fiery display that end the parade on an auspicious note. These troupes later became integral parts of the 1985 and 1988 (evening) NDP editions. ====Participating organizations==== Though every show would see the participation of an assortment of public and private companies, there are three main anchors taking on each Act in the show segment. They are the Peoples' Association (which involvement started in 1984, and one of the founding participants), the Singapore Soka Association (SSA) (active since the 1970s) and the Ministry of Education, which would be represented by an individual institution or a cluster of schools, and also a founding participant of the parades. The latter also provides the Combined Schools Band and the Combined School Choirs, another regular part of the NDP itself, and since the 1970s has been part of the national celebrations. The Ministry also provides the School Display Band for the pre-parade segment of the programme, coming from one of the many schools in the island country pre-selected for performance in the event. Since 2016, volunteers from Team Nila are also involved as Precinct Ushers, Safety Management Aides and, most recently, as pre-show Active Health Ambassadors. ====Multimedia show==== Various types of high-tech multimedia equipment are used during the actual show segment since 2003. Various technologies notable include the Projecteur d’Images Géantes Informatisées in 2003, a water-curtain visualization in 2007, and LED Mash in 2008. ===Post-parade=== Post-parade parties was first televised in 1997 and featured celebrities and performers to celebrate the success of the parade while providing entertainment to the audience awaiting to leave the venue. The parade usually last for an hour and ends with the Chief of Defence Force, the Chairman of that year's NDP EXCO and the organizers to cutting a cake to commemorate the efforts with the participants with speeches of gratitude. The party is now normally anchored by the SAF Music and Drama Company. ==SongsNational Day songs=== Under the Sing Singapore Festival, which inaugurated in 1984, numerous community songs have been composed. Nonetheless, only few National Day songs which struck a chord among Singaporeans continue to be sung annually in the parade. They are collectively known as the Sing Singapore Medley which comes after the fireworks display during the Grand Finale segment, or since 2008, forming the final part of the display. Other National Day songs continue to be featured during the parade, either in the Pre-Parade segment, Parade and Ceremony segment or used as tunes to accompany the mass displays during the show part of the celebrations. In particular, for the Parade and Ceremony segment, in between the arrivals of Members of Parliament, Cabinet Ministers, the Prime Minister and the President, four songs each of one official language (English, Malay, Mandarin and Tamil) will be performed. In previous years, the final song in English (before the President's arrival) has always been the NDP theme song (in 2007 this was not the case) while in NDP 2008, all the songs performed in the P&C; segment (in between arrivals) were all previous NDP theme songs in recent years. (The song tradition would return in 2017, but only in the pre-parade portion and in a different language order, while past theme songs were played during the arrivals.) The music performed during the parades have evolved over the decades, reflecting not just the change of musical influences and styles, but also the country's multi-ethnic character. The 2010 P&C; songs were three in number, due to the fact that the arrival of the Parliament deputies happened before the parade, and were unique because all the songs sung were in English (one song even had lyrics in the three other major languages). In 2011, there was the \\"Fun Pack Song\\" which went along to the tune of Lady Gaga's 'Bad Romance'. The song was shortly scrapped. The 2013's medley saw a record number of NDP songs that featured in this medley, with ten and lasted about five-and-a-half minutes: \\"Stand Up For Singapore\\", \\"We Will Get There\\", \\"What Do You See\\", \\"One United People\\", \\"Turn Up The Love\\" (not including NDP songs), \\"Home\\", \\"One People, One Nation, One Singapore\\", \\"Count On Me Singapore\\", \\"We Are Singapore\\" and \\"One Singapore\\" (that year's theme song). In 2014, it was announced that there would be no new songs produced for National Day for the 2nd time in its long history, and in a historic move by the organizing committee, the classic NDP songs will be sung again. That year's edition saw past NDP theme songs being played during the arrival segments, and broke tradition by having the Sing Singapore Medley sung as the epilogue after the national anthem was played. The Sing Singapore Medley finale was repeated again in the 2015 event, after the Pledge Moment ends. Both cases have now included the 1998 theme song \\"Home\\" as part of the medley, just as it was the case in 2013. 2016 will see the medley also accompanied by special needs students provided by the seven Voluntary Welfare Organisations of the island country hand-signing for the deaf and hard of hearing who will take part, yet another first. The 1998 theme \\"Home\\" was sung as well. (Since 1989 a deaf Representative has been present to sign the Pledge for deaf viewers of the event.) ===Theme songs=== NDP Theme songs were first introduced in 1984, starting with \\"Stand Up for Singapore\\", and again in the 1985 Parade; \\"Count on Me Singapore\\" which was performed by Clement Chow at the 1986 Parade. Other notable songs include \\"We are Singapore\\" (1987–1988) and \\"One People, One Nation, One Singapore\\" (1990). Theme songs were not prominent in the parades of the 1990s until in 1997, when the song \\"Singapore Town\\", composed and sung by the SAF Music and Drama Company, was that year's theme song. Only in the 1998 edition did interest in the NDP theme songs rose again with the widely acclaimed song \\"Home\\", a song composed by Dick Lee and sung by Kit Chan. That year's parade feature \\"Home\\" and one more NDP song, \\"City For The World\\", sung by the children choir. Its popularity led to the production of the various renditions in 2004, including a rock piece composed by JJ Lin. This is partly to use the platform of the televised national event to increase awareness to new National Day pieces composed for the Sing Singapore Festival held then. In 2003, however, a significant split took place when the National Day theme song of that year was not part of Sing Singapore theme song. Stefanie Sun's \\"One United People\\" was used as the theme song to better suit the theme of \\"A Cohesive Society\\" while Sean Wang's \\"A Place In My Heart\\" was chosen to lead the Sing Singapore 2003 Festival. Before 2007, the theme songs come in two languages, the lingua franca in Singapore – English as well as Mandarin. To promote the songs, music videos that showcase local landmarks and lifestyle are made and shown on national television a month before National Day; the songs will also be played on local airwaves. Legal MP3 downloads are also available on the NDP website from 2010 onwards. Local songbirds that made it big in regional music scenes, such as Kaira Gong, Kit Chan, Corrine May, Stefanie Sun and Tanya Chua have been invited back home to perform various National Day theme songs. The winner of Singapore Idol 2004, Taufik Batisah, became a prominent choice to lead the nation in singing the NDP 2005's theme song \\"Reach Out for the Skies\\", alongside singer-actress Rui En. In 2007, there were two theme songs instead of the usual one. 2009 was the last time a Chinese rendition of the English song was featured. In 2013, the National Day Parade theme song will not be sung by renowned local artists but, for the first time, by fellow Singaporeans that join the \\"Sing A Nation\\" reality-competition organized by MediaCorp for that year's event. It would be in 2014 when the NDP will not have another official theme song in a break from tradition for the second time, due to decision made by the organizers. In place of the theme song was three songs were remade into two music videos: \\"We Will Get There\\" and \\"One People, One Nation, One Singapore\\" sung by Ann Hussein, Rahimah Rahim, Gayle Nerva, Farisha Ishak, Tay Kewei and Tabitha Nauser; and \\"What Do You See\\" sung by Fauzie Laily, Jack Ho, Kartik Kunasegaran, Sivadorai \\"Rai\\" Sellakannu and Shaun Jansen. Dick Lee's 1996 song, \\"Big Island\\", debuted during the show segment of the parade. The theme song tradition would return in the 2015 installment again until 2018. The 2015 theme song, \\"Our Singapore\\", was remade as the theme song for 2019, and the 2018's parade features a remake of \\"We Are Singapore\\", both of which being the theme titles for that year's parade. The most recent installment to feature an original theme song was 2020's Everything I Am, sung by Nathan Hartono.

These goodies include food, drinks, vouchers from various participating companies and sponsors, items and commodities intended for the use during the parade, such as a theme-designed torchlight and the Singapore flag. Most funpacks are designed by students from local polytechnics and community services, although an exception happened 2015, where people from all walks of life designed 50 designs for the funpack, which also include a Singa Lion Figurine, some snacks and games. Most of the years, the funpacks were also packed by selected members of the armed forces. In 2009, they were packed by prisoners through the Yellow Ribbon Project. In 2015, a similar funpack, the 'SG Funpack', was given out to every household. In 2019, the funpacks are environmentally-friendly unlike the NDP 2018 Funpack. ==Organisation and sponsorship== Singapore Armed Forces Military Police Command providing security coverage at the Padang during the National Day Parade in 2000. NDP are usually organised by the Singapore Armed Forces, with the involvement of a multitude of public and private organisations. The parade is overseen by the formation of an NDP EXCO (Executive Committee) which oversees various aspects of the parade, such as the Parade & Ceremony to the show, SICUS (Seating, Invitation, Car parking, Ushering and Security) to Website & Publicity. The EXCO is formed by military personnel and is usually headed by the Commander of the organising division. Civilians also sit on the EXCO as representatives of the various public agencies involved. Similarly, sponsorship comes from various public and private organisations to fund this multi-million dollar production. This includes local organisations such as the Singapore Pools, Singapore Telecom, as well as multi-national companies such as Volkswagen and Nokia. In recent years, sponsorship is divided into three categories depending on the amount of money pledged, including Principal, Major and Co-sponsors/partners. The unit that will be the organizer of the event starts preparatory activities in October, just two months after the previous parade, together with the formation of the EXCO and pre-parade planning, plus the official sponsorship launch. In recent years there has been public participation, which also involved with the choosing of the theme and the funpack design. ==See also== * Singapore National Day Rally ===Notes=ReferencesOther=External links== * Singapore NDP official website Category:Events in Singapore Singapore Category:Military parades in Singapore ","title":"Singapore National Day Parade"},{"id":"1999349","text":"Prunus salicina (syn. Prunus triflora or Prunus thibetica), commonly called the Japanese plum or Chinese plum, is a small deciduous tree native to China. It is now also grown in fruit orchards in Vietnam ,Korea, Japan, the United States, and Australia. Prunus salicina should not be confused with Prunus mume, a related species also grown in China, Japan, Korea and Vietnam. Another tree, Prunus japonica, is also a separate species despite having a Latin name similar to Prunus salicina's common name. Plant breeder Luther Burbank devoted a lot of work to hybridizing this species with the Japanese plum (Prunus salicina) and developed a number of cultivars from the hybrid. ==Description== Prunus salicina grows up to tall, and has reddish-brown shoots. The leaves are 6-12 cm long and 2.5-5 cm broad, with a serrated margin. The flowers are produced in early spring, 2 cm diameter with five white petals. The fruit is a drupe 4-7 cm in diameter with yellow-pink flesh; it can be harvested in the summer. When fully ripe it can be eaten raw.http://homeorchard.ucanr.edu/Fruits_&_Nuts/Plum_and_Prune ==UsesCulinary=== In China, candied fruits are also sold preserved, flavoured with sugar, salt, and liquorice. In Japan, it is also used half ripe as a flavouring in a liqueur called sumomo shu (すもも酒),photo and in China a liquor is made from the fruits. For other uses of this and similar species see plum. ===Medicinal=== The fruits are also used in Traditional Chinese medicine. Japanese plums cv. Crimson Globe may be taken as a source of antioxidants with a potential to counteract oxidation.González-Flores D, Velardo B, Garrido M, González-Gómez D, Lozano M, Ayuso M.C, Barriga C, Paredes S.D, Rodríguez A.B. (2011). \\"Ingestion of Japanese plums (Prunus salicina Lindl. cv. Crimson Globe) increases the urinary 6-sulfatoxymelatonin and total antioxidant capacity levels in young, middle-aged and elderly humans: Nutritional and functional characterization of their content\\". Journal of Food and Nutrition Research 50(4): 229-236. ==Etymology== The species name is derived from the Latin word for willow. ==Cultivation== Many different varieties of Prunus salicina, some being hybrid species, are cultivated in China. Prunus salicina is also widely cultivated in Japan and Korea. The most famous variety of this fruit in Vietnam is the Tam Hoa plum grown in Bắc Hà town, in Lào Cai Province. Cultivars of the species were greatly improved in Japan and thence introduced into the United States in the latter half of the 19th century, where subsequent breeding produced many more cultivars, generally with larger fruit. Many of these American cultivars have been exported to other countries, including back to Japan, their ancestral place of origin. Most of the fresh plums sold in North American supermarkets are Prunus salicina cultivars. They are grown on a large scale in a number of other countries, for example, they dominate the stone fruit industry in Western Australia. ==See also== *Prunus mume ==ReferencesExternal links== *ibiblio.org - Prunus salicina *U.Melb- AU: Sorting Prunus names salicina salicina Category:Fruits originating in Asia Category:Flora of China Category:Japanese cuisine Category:Japanese fruit Category:Trees of China Category:Garden plants of Asia ","title":"Prunus salicina"},{"id":"1999350","text":"The Ottawa Fury were a Canadian soccer team based in Ottawa, Ontario. The team played in the USL Premier Development League (PDL) from 2005 to 2013. The organization joined the North American Soccer League (NASL) as Ottawa Fury FC beginning in the 2014 season. The team's home stadium was the Algonquin College soccer complex; its colours were white, red and blue. The Fury operated a women's soccer team, Ottawa Fury Women, in the USL W-League, and a team in the USL's Super-20 League, a league for players 17 to 20 years of age run under the United Soccer Leagues umbrella. ==History== Ottawa Fury entered the PDL in 2005, joining fellow Canadian teams Thunder Bay Chill and Abbotsford Rangers in the American-based competition. Under the leadership of head coach Colin McCurdy – a Northern Irish legend from his time at Belfast club Linfield – the Fury began brightly, beating Westchester Flames 3–0 in their opening fixture, and winning two of their next four, including a 5–3 victory at home over the Albany Admirals which featured a hat trick from Kevin Omokhua. Unfortunately, Ottawa could never quite string a run of results together; throughout the season, win would follow loss would follow win, although their points tally did keep them high in the standings all year long. A staggering 10–2 annihilation of Brooklyn Knights (which saw Francis Mavula net four goals) and an impressive 6–3 victory on the road over the Westchester Flames were the highlights of the rest of the regular season. A 4–3 defeat to Cape Cod Crusaders on the final day of the season left the Fury third in the Northeast behind Cape Cod, just out of the playoffs. Kevin Omokhua and Francis Mavula were a threatening strike force, netting 21 times between them, while Desmond Tachie contributed 7 goals and 7 assists. Ottawa moved to the New England Division in 2006, and started the new season in decent form, with a win and two ties in their first three games. However, the Fury stuttered through June, losing 2–1 to Albany Admirals, and being beaten three times in thirteen days by the Cape Cod Crusaders. The 4–4 tie with Rhode Island Stingrays at the beginning of June, in which they threw away a 2-goal lead in the last 15 minutes, may have signalled a downturn in Fury's form, but to their credit they rallied towards the season's end. Ottawa won six of their last eight games, including a 3–0 revenge win over Rhode Island, but their late charge towards the playoffs was in vain; they finished the regular season second in the division, a full 20 points behind Cape Cod Crusaders, and failed to secure the post-season wild-card slot. Kevin Omokhua was again Ottawa's outstanding player in front of goal, with 11 for the season. Head coach McCurdy left at the end of 2006, and he was replaced by Chris Roth; unfortunately, his first season at the helm was a difficult one, as Fury suffered their worst run of results in the franchise's history. Despite an opening tie with Cape Cod Crusaders and a 3–2 win over PDL new boys Long Island Rough Riders in their first two games, Fury suffered an immediate down- turn in form. Fury won just one game in June – 4–0 over Vermont Voltage – and quickly fell out of contention for playoff consideration. Five straight games without a win in July, and eight in total, sent the Fury to the bottom of the Northeast Division table, and only a 4–0 final day win over bottom side Rhode Island Stingrays kept the Canadians from finishing last in the division. Will Beaugé was Fury's top scorer, with six goals, while English midfielder Yan Klukowski contributed 4 assists. Head coach Roth was replaced by Stephen O'Kane in the off-season, and seemed to have a positive effect on the squad. Ottawa bounded back spectacularly in 2008, enjoying what turned out to be the most successful – but ultimately frustrating – year in franchise history. Despite a rocky start in which they lost their opening two games, Fury responded with four wins in their next five games, including a 5–2 blowout over Vermont Voltage, a 4–1 rollover of Rhode Island Stingrays, and a comprehensive 3–0 win over Long Island Rough Riders. Ottawa's scintillating form continued throughout July, when they enjoyed a 9-game unbeaten run stretching back to the aforementioned Long Island game. Fury were powerhouses in front of goal – they crushed the Rhode Island Stingrays 5–0, and followed this up with a 7–0 annihilation of New Hampshire Phantoms, which saw seven different Fury players find the net. They entered their last game knowing that a win over Vermont would most likely give them the New England Division title over Cape Cod Crusaders; shockingly, they fell to a 3–0 defeat, and then were nudged out of the playoffs by Newark Ironbound Express, who finished second in the Northeast, and finished equal on points, but took the final playoff spot on head-to-head results. Will Beaugé and Florian Decamps were Fury's top scorers, with seven goals each, while Da Costa and Andrew Rigby both contributed four assists. Assistant Coach Klaus Linnenbruegger stepped up to take over the helm of the Ottawa Fury PDL. Linnenbruegger, who played professionally with Bielefeld in Germany, successfully coached Fury Youth teams over the previous seven seasons and is a past head coach of the Ottawa Wizards.

The disorder is caused by genetic mutations resulting in improper function of the thiazide-sensitive sodium-chloride symporter (also known as NCC, NCCT, or TSC) located in the distal convoluted tubule of the kidney. The distal convoluted tubule of the kidney serves a minimal role in salt absorption and a greater role in managing the excretion of electrolytes like magnesium and calcium to produce more concentrated urine. Genetic mutations along the sodium chloride symporter, lead to inadequate transport of multiple electrolytes along this channel such as sodium, chloride, calcium, magnesium, and potassium. The net effect is an electrolyte imbalance consistent with thiazide diuretic therapy Gitelman syndrome was formerly considered a subset of Bartter syndrome until the distinct genetic and molecular bases of these disorders were identified. Bartter syndrome is also an autosomal recessive hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis, but it derives from a mutation to the NKCC2 found in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle. ==Signs and symptoms== Affected individuals may not have symptoms in some cases. Symptomatic individuals present with symptoms identical to those of patients who are on thiazide diuretics, given that the affected transporter is the exact target of thiazides, (unlike in Bartter syndrome, in which patients present as though on loop diuretics). Clinical signs of Gitelman syndrome include a high blood pH in combination with low levels of chloride, potassium, and magnesium in the blood and decreased calcium excretion in the urine. In contrast to people with Gordon's syndrome, those affected by Gitelman syndrome generally have low or normal blood pressure. Individuals affected by Gitelman syndrome often complain of severe muscle cramps or weakness, numbness, thirst, waking up at night to urinate, salt cravings, abnormal sensations, chondrocalcinosis, or weakness expressed as extreme fatigue or irritability. Though cravings for salt are most common and severe, cravings for sour foods (e.g. vinegar, lemons, and sour figs) have been noted in some persons affected. More severe symptoms such as seizures, tetany, and paralysis have been reported. Abnormal heart rhythms and a prolonged QT interval can be detected on electrocardiogram and cases of sudden cardiac death have been reported due to low potassium levels. Quality of life is decreased in Gitelman syndrome Phenotypic variations observed among patients probably result from differences in their genetic background and may depend on which particular amino acid in the NCCT protein has been mutated. In a study by Riviera-Munoz et al. identified a subset of individuals with Gitelman syndrome with a severe phenotypic expression. The clinical manifestations observed in this group were neuromuscular manifestations, growth retardation, and ventricular arrhythmias. The patients were mostly male and were found to have at least one allele of a splice defect on the SLC12A3 gene. ==Cause== Gitelman syndrome has an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance. The sodium chloride symporter is a protein made up of 1021 amino acids and 12 transmembrane domains. Mutations that occur on the SLC12A3 gene range from missense, nonsense, frame-shift and splice-site mutations which occur throughout the gene. Most cases of Gitelman syndrome are linked to inactivating mutations in the SLC12A3 gene, resulting in a loss of function of the thiazide-sensitive sodium-chloride co-transporter (NCCT). This genetic mutation in SLC12A3 is present in 80% of adults with Gitelman syndrome. More than 180 mutations of this transporter protein have been described. This cell membrane protein participates in the control of ion homeostasis at the distal convoluted tubule portion of the nephron. Loss of this transporter also has the indirect effect of increasing calcium reabsorption in a transcellular fashion. This has been suggested to be the result of a putative basolateral Na+/Ca2+ exchanger and apical calcium channel. When the sodium-chloride cotransporter (NCCT) is inactivated, continued action of the basolateral Na+/K+-ATPase creates a favourable sodium gradient across the basolateral membrane. This increases the reabsorption of divalent cations by secondary active transport. It is currently unknown why calcium reabsorption is increased while magnesium absorption is decreased, often leading to a low level of magnesium in the blood . A secondary effect of the inactivated sodium-chloride cotransporter is the subsequent activation of the renin- angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS). RAAS activation is a byproduct of the failure of the distal convoluted tubule in reuptaking electrolytes specifically sodium and chloride leading to cellular dehydration. RAAS attempts to compensate for this dehydration resulting in low serum blood potassium. A small percentage of Gitleman syndrome cases can be attributed to mutations in the CLCNKB gene. This gene is related to the function of the renal chloride channel CLC-Kb located at the basolateral membrane of cells in the thick ascending limb of the Henle's loop. Genetic variations or mutations in the CLCNKB was initially linked to classic Bartter Syndrome. When mutations are not found within the SLC12A3 gene, screening can be done to rule out involvement of CLCNKB gene. Gitelman syndrome is inherited in an autosomal- recessive manner: one defective allele has to be inherited from each parent. ==Diagnosis== Diagnosis of Gitelman syndrome can be confirmed after eliminating of other common pathological sources of hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis. A complete metabolic panel (CMP) or basic metabolic panel (BMP) can be used to evaluate serum electrolyte levels. Renin and aldosterone can be tested in the blood. Electrolyte measurement and aldosterone levels can be done via urine. The pathognomonic clinical markers include low serum levels of potassium, sodium, chloride, and magnesium in the blood as a result of urinary excretion. Urinary fractional excretion potassium is high or inappropriately normal in the context of hypokalaemia, and high levels or urinary sodium and chloride are observed. Other clinical indicators include elevated serum renin and aldosterone in the blood stream, and metabolic alkalosis. The symptomatic features of this syndrome are highly variable ranging from asymptomatic to mild manifestations (weakness, cramps) to severe symptoms (tetany, paralysis, rhabdomyolysis). Symptom severity is multi-factorial, with phenotypic expression varying amongst individuals within the same family. Genetic testing is another measure of identifying the underlying mutations which cause the pathologic symptoms of the disease. This mode of testing is available at select laboratories. Work-up to exclude the differential diagnosis of the electrolyte abnormalities is key. * In Gitelman syndrome hypocalcuria is present, and a urine calcium:creatinine ratio may help distinguish it from Bartter syndrome as the two disorders can be clinically indistinguishable. Additionally in Bartter syndrome maximal urine concentrating ability is lost. * Laxative abuse can mimic the serum electrolyte abnormalities, but fractional excretion of potassium will be low * Diuretic abuse could be suspected if urinary chloride excretion varies by time of day, but may require a diuretic assay to detect * Surreptitious vomiting can cause metabolic alkalosis and hypokalaemia, but urinary chloride levels will be low * Medication history; Proton-pump inhibitors can cause an isolated hypomagnesaemia phenotype, and aminoglycosides such as gentamicin can cause a transient metabolic alkalosis with hypokalaemia and hypomagnesaemia that resolves 2–6 weeks after drug termination. * Primary aldosteronism will cause metabolic alkalosis and hypokalaemia, but hypertension will be present and serum renin will be low * EAST syndrome, though neurological features will predominate * Renal cysts and diabetes syndrome can cause hypomagnesaemia and hypocalcuria, but is distinguished by early onset chronic kidney disease and an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern of renal cysts and/or diabetes ==Treatment== Most asymptomatic individuals with Gitelman syndrome can be monitored without medical treatment. Dietary modification of a high salt diet incorporated with, potassium and magnesium supplementation to normalize blood levels is the mainstay of treatment. Large doses of potassium and magnesium are often necessary to adequately replace the electrolytes lost in the urine. Diarrhea is a common side effect of oral magnesium which can make replacement by mouth difficult but dividing the dose to 3-4 times a day is better tolerated. Severe deficits of potassium and magnesium require intravenous replacement. If low blood potassium levels are not sufficiently replaced with replacement by mouth, aldosterone antagonists (such as spironolactone or eplerenone) or epithelial sodium channel blockers such as amiloride can be used to decrease urinary wasting of potassium. In patients with early onset of the disease such as infants and children, indomethacin is the drug of choice utilized to treat growth disturbances. Indomethacin in a study by Blanchard et. al 2015 was shown to increase serum potassium levels, and decrease renin concentration. Adverse effects of indomethacin include a decrease in the glomerular filtration rate, and gastrointestinal distrubances. Cardiac evaluation is promoted in the prevention of dysrhythmias and monitoring of QT interval activity. Medications that extend or prolong the QT interval (macrolides, antihistamines,beta-2 agonists) should be avoided in these patients to prevent cardiac death. ==Epidemiology== Gitelman syndrome is estimated to have a prevalence of 1 in 40,000 homozygous people . The ratio of men to women affected is 1:1. This disease is encountered typically past the 1st decade of life, during adolescence or adulthood but can occur in the neonatal period. Heterozygous carriers of the SLC12A3 gene mutations are 1% of the population. Parents with Gitelman syndrome have a low probability of passing the disorder to their offspring roughly 1 in 400 unless they are both carriers of the disease. ==History== The condition is named for Hillel J. Gitelman (1932– January 12, 2015), an American nephrologist working at University of North Carolina School of Medicine. He first described the condition in 1966, after observing a pair of sisters with the disorder. Gitelman and his colleagues later identified and isolated the gene responsible (SLC12A3) by molecular cloning. ==References External links == Category:Autosomal recessive disorders Category:Membrane transport protein disorders Category:Kidney diseases Category:Rare syndromes Category:Syndromes affecting the kidneys ","title":"Gitelman syndrome"},{"id":"1999370","text":"Amelia Best Amelia Martha (Millie) Best MBE (29 April 1900 – 14 November 1979) was one of the first two women elected to the Tasmanian House of Assembly.

Sand sharks, also known as sand tiger sharks, grey nurse sharks or ragged tooth sharks, are mackerel sharks of the family Odontaspididae. They are found worldwide in temperate and tropical waters. The three species are in two genera. ==Description== The long, narrow and sharp teeth of Odontaspididae (here Odontaspis ferox). The body tends to be brown with dark markings in the upper half. These markings disappear as they mature. Their needle-like teeth are highly adapted for impaling fish, their main prey. Their teeth are long, narrow, and very sharp with smooth edges, with one and on occasion two smaller cusplets on either side. Sand sharks have a large second dorsal fin. The sand shark can grow up to long, and most adults can weigh around . The average lifespan of both sexes is only about 7 years, though they may live longer in captivity. ==Location and origins== The name sand shark comes from their tendency to migrate towards shoreline habitats, and they are often seen swimming around the ocean floor in the surf zone; at times, they come very close to shore. They are often found in warm or temperate waters throughout the world's oceans, except the eastern Pacific. They also frequent the Mediterranean and Adriatic Seas at depths from and sometimes more. ==Behavior== The sand shark has a unique hunting strategy. It is able to gulp air from above the surface and collect the air in its stomach. This enables it to become buoyant and approach its prey virtually motionless. During the day, the sand shark stays mostly inactive, but at night, it becomes active and resumes hunting activities. Its staple is small fish, but it eats crustaceans and squid, as well. It occasionally hunts in shivers (groups), and has even been known to attack full fishing nets. ==Reproduction== Sand sharks only develop two embryos, one in each uterus. The largest and strongest embryos consume their siblings in the womb (intrauterine cannibalism) before each surviving pup is born. It has one of the lowest reproduction rates of all sharks and is susceptible to even minimal population pressure, so it is listed as vulnerable and is protected in much of its range. ==Attacks on people== Sand sharks are not known to attack humans. If a person were to provoke a sand shark, it may retaliate defensively. Sand sharks are generally not aggressive, but harass divers who are spearfishing. In North America, wreck divers regularly visit the World War II shipwrecks to dive with the sharks that make the wrecks their home. ==Conservation== A recent report from the PEW Charitable Trusts suggests a new management approach used for large mammals that have suffered population declines could hold promise for sharks. Because of the life-history characteristics of sharks, conventional fisheries management approaches, such as reaching maximum sustainable yield, may not be sufficient to rebuild depleted shark populations. Some of the more stringent approaches used to reverse declines in large mammals may be appropriate for sharks, including prohibitions on the retention of the most vulnerable species and regulation of international trade. ==Species== Teeth of Synodontaspis gracilis The family contains three extant species, in two genera, as well as many extinct species in several genera. * Genus Carcharias Rafinesque, 1810 ** Carcharias taurus Rafinesque, 1810 (sand tiger shark) Carcharias taurus.

By expanding the historical study of women writers as a distinct literary tradition, gynocritics sought to develop new models based on the study of female experience to replace male models of literary creation, and so \\"map the territory\\"Quoted in J. Childers ed., The Columbia Dictionary of Modern Literary and Cultural Criticism (1995) p. 129 left unexplored in earlier literary criticisms. ==History== While previous figures like Virginia Woolf and Simone de Beauvoir had already begun to review and evaluate the female image in literature, and second-wave feminism had explored phallocentrism and sexism through a female reading of male authors, gynocriticism was designed as a \\"second phase\\" in feminist criticism – turning to a focus on, and interrogation of female authorship, images, the feminine experience and ideology, and the history and development of the female literary tradition.Xu, Y 2007, 'Contribution of gynocriticism to feminist criticism', US – China Foreign Language, vol. 5, no. 5, pp. 1 – 5.Barry, P 2009, Beginning theory; An introduction to literary and cultural theory, Manchester University Press, Manchester. == Development as a literary critique == Gynocriticism also examines the female struggle for identity and the social construct of gender. According to Elaine Showalter, gynocritics is the study of not only the female as a gender status but also the 'internalized consciousness' of the female. The uncovering of the female subculture and exposition of a female model is the intention of gynocriticism, comprising recognition of a distinct female canon where a female identity is sought free from the masculine definitions and oppositions. Gynocriticism accordingly challenged a Freudian psychoanalytic perspective whereby the female inherently suffers envy of men and feelings of inadequacy and injustice, combined with feelings of intellectual inferiority.Frager, R & Fadiman, J 2005, Personality and personal growth 6th ed, Pearson Prentice Hall, New Jersey. Arguing that male 'phallic prejudice' itself creates a female consciousness that demands a critique, and that prejudice against the female incites a specific noesis that gets attributed to the female, Gynocriticism stressed that this prejudice has concealed the female literary tradition to the point of imitating the masculine.Friedman, Susan Stanford. Mappings : Feminism and the Cultural Geographies of Encounter. Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1998 ==Achievements and limitations== Gynocriticism helped reclaim from obscurity a vast body of early female writings, often published in Virago,Patricia Waugh, Literary Theory and Criticism (2006) p. 328 as well as producing such feminist classics as The Madwoman in the Attic.J. Childers ed., The Columbia Dictionary of Modern Literary and Cultural Criticism (1995) p. 129 However its very successes left it open to new challenges from within feminism. Poststructuralists complained that it fetishized the role of the author, at the expense of the reader and the text, and that its grand narrative, setting up a female canon in opposition to the male, was essentialist, and omitted differences and divisions among women, leaving out lesbians and women of color, for example.Literary Terms.\\" Fall 2002. Montclair State University (students of ENGL 605: Literary Research). 05 Jun. 2005 . Race, class, social interest, political inclination, religion and sexuality all arguably come into play in the construction of identity. Separating out such properties would create a one-dimensional view of the female, yet if gender and identity are merely constructs then it becomes difficult to assign any inherent qualities of nature or language to found a critique. Despite such limitations, gynocriticism offers a valuable interrogation of 'female' literature, through the study of sameness and difference in gender. While the term is rarely used in third-wave feminism, the practices and canon establishment of gynocriticism continues to underpin feminist literary criticism.I.
