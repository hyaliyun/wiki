The PCA emerged in 1920 as an extension of the French Communist Party (PCF) and eventually became a separate entity in 1936. Despite this, it was recognized by the Comintern in 1935. Its first congress was in Algiers in July 1936, where it was the PCA's headquarter. In 1955 the party was banned by the French authorities. The party then oriented itself towards the national liberation movement. PCA obtained legal status in 1962 and in the same year it was banned and dissolved. The Algerian communists later regrouped as PAGS. The general secretaries of PCA were Benali Boukort from 1936 to 1939, Ouzegane during the underground central committee, Bouhali from 1947 to 1949 and Bachir Hadj Ali from 1949. == The PCA before the Algerian Independence war (1920–1954) == The PCA had at the beginning a lack of political sensibility with the colonized aspirations. This is attributed to the majority of its members (between 12,000 and 15,000) being Pieds-Noirs. The PCA supported the Blum–Viollette proposal and Setif´s repression of 1945. However, some Muslims were attracted to the PCA. Some of them were: Ben Ali Boukurt, Ahmed Akkache and the general secretary Bachir Hadj Ali. The PCA additionally had trouble gaining traction since it had lost most of its proletariat base. During the first world war, as France's men were mostly employed along the western front, tens of thousands of Algerians were displaced from the countryside and moved to France to take advantage of the labor shortage. A saying emerged that \\"l’Algerie est une societe dont le proletariat est en France.\\" Essentially, Algeria's proletariat was in France. The First World War increased union membership leading to a doubling of Algiers Trade Union membership. This only continued as the ranks of displaced workers flooded Algeria's cities from the countryside. However, ties remained with the rural communities in which they had lived for generations. As these people joined the communist party, their networks allowed the party to expand into areas not typically considered its territory. Yet the division that dominated Algerian Society also affected the supposedly egalitarian Communist Party, the division of ethnicity effected the Algerian communist party as well. Additionally, since the party was so tied to France, there were different ideas about how to pursue the Comintern's call for peoples to free themselves around the world. A major part of the Algerian communist party believed that a revolution must take place in France first and then Algeria could have hers. Leon Trotsky, as well as many other notable internationalists called this a continuation of the slave mentality. == The PCA during the Algerian Independence war (1954–1962) == At the beginning of the Independence War, the PCA was damaged. The Muslim members wanted to join the nationalists, but not the Europeans. That ambiguity was due to the PCF's equivocal positions. In 1956 the Central Committee of the PCA voted to join the Revolution maintaining its independent internal administration. During the War, some members of the PCA distinguished themselves. Henri Maillot was killed while providing arms to the Nationalists and serving the Maquis Rouges. Henri Alleg and many others were arrested and tortured. He was the editor of the Alger Republicain. The PCA collaborated with the Front de Libération Nationale (FLN), and the communists accused them of discrimination and purposefully placing them in more dangerous situations. == The PCA after the Algerian Independence war (1962–1966) == The PCA did not adopt a position in the postwar conflict between the Gouvernement provisional de la République algérienne (GPRA) and the Political Bureau. By 1962 the PCA and its newspaper al-Hurriya were suppressed and banned . At the beginning of Ben Bella´s government the Algerian communists still exercised influence through publications like the Révolution africaine. During the military coup of Boumediene in 1965 the remnants of the PCA were eliminated. Communists later reorganized during 1966 as the Parti de l´Avant-Garde Socialiste (PAGS). == Relation with the FLN == During the liberation war, in 1955 the PCA created combatant units called Combattants de la Libération. At 1956 the PCA and the FLN made an agreement in which it integrated the PCA combatant force to the National Liberation Army (ALN), separating from the leadership of the party that remained in Algiers. By 1962, after the independence war was over, Communist were attracting members to the party and publishing Alger Républicain. The FLN feared this and banned the PCA but tolerated the communists themselves. Ben Bella's constitution of 1963 put the FLN as the only legal party. A curious fact is that FLN took people from the PCA later to work on state, because they were prepared and educated. At 1965 some of the leaders of the PCA, with the left wing of the FLN created an Organization to combat the military coup of Boumediene, the Organization de la résistance populaire (OPR). == Relation with the PCF == PCA appeared at 1920 as an extension of the PCF. PCF was mainly French, European. PCA was against French domination, and it tried to be more Arab by his separation, at least in the wish. Comintern supported the anti-imperialist fights on that times. However, PCA followed the political leadership of the PCF, what it made turn back on the demands of independence. By 1939 both PCA and PCF were banned, damaging the space for communism. With the massacres of 1945 by the settlers, the PCA and PCF weren't quick to condemn the massacre. However, the fight against Fascism gave the PCF a good status. After the Second World War and the massacre, the PCA started a campaign against the state repression, because of nationalists in the party, sometimes radicalized. This made the PCA take politics more autonomous to the PCF. At the Cold War, the PCF put the focus on the North American imperialism while the PCA focused on the French imperialism. When the liberation war started, the PCA was banned again in 1955 and repressed. == Notable members of the PCA == *Henri Maillot *Baya Jurquet *Henri Alleg == References  Bibliography == * Chiviges Naylor, P., Andrew Heggoy, A.

He grew up and attended school in South Central Los Angeles, graduating from Mid City Alternative Magnet School. In the 8th grade, Marshall broke his leg during a football game he was playing with friends and spent the better part of the year being homeschooled while he recuperated, first at Children's Hospital of Los Angeles, and later at home where he spent several months in a full body cast. Marshall later credited this period in his life for preparing him for musical study, as the forced inactivity calmed down his naturally hyperactive personality thus giving him the focus and patience he would need in order to develop as a musician. Marshall began playing guitar in his teens, counting as musical influences P-Funk (Parliament Funkadelic), Jimi Hendrix, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Brian Setzer of the Stray Cats, Prince, Django Reinhardt, Steven Hufsteter, Matthew Ashman from Bow Wow Wow, the Clash, Michael Jackson, the Talking Heads, Björk, and the Isley Brothers, among many others. After high school, Marshall worked briefly as a messenger for downtown Los Angeles law firms. He has also taught guitar at Los Angeles City College and The Musician's Institute. ==Musical beginnings== After performing around Los Angeles with a variety of musicians, Marshall began getting work as a session musician, appearing on recordings for artists such as Tone Loc, Etta James, and Sting. In 1988, he and his brother Lonnie Marshall formed a band they called Marshall Law. They signed a development deal with Island records and recorded a demo for them. The band broke up having only released two tracks on a Ska Parade compilation. After the breakup, Lonnie formed Weapon of Choice. Marshall continued to perform locally in Los Angeles and briefly led his own band, Alpha Jerk, before disbanding it to join the Red Hot Chili Peppers in 1992. Marshall Law reunited in 2006 and released an album, another X-cuse. ==Red Hot Chili Peppers== Marshall joined the Red Hot Chili Peppers in 1992 to replace lead guitarist John Frusciante, who quit in the middle of the band's worldwide Blood Sugar Sex Magik Tour. He toured extensively with the band during his tenure as their guitarist and played the Lollapalooza festival of that year. Anthony Kiedis later praised Marshall for being \\"a quick study\\" and never letting them down onstage. Despite not playing on the recorded songs, Marshall appeared in both of the \\"Breaking the Girl\\" and \\"If You Have to Ask\\" music videos. Marshall's last concert performance with the Red Hot Chili Peppers was the February 9, 1993, but they appeared at the 1993 Grammy Awards ceremony on February 24 to perform \\"Give It Away.\\" Kiedis later revealed that the group were unable to find the right chemistry with Marshall in their songwriting, specifically Flea. Despite their efforts to collaborate, they found Marshall was not a suitable writing partner. For this reason, Marshall was released from the band and was replaced by Jesse Tobias, who was soon replaced by Dave Navarro. On April 14, 2012, the Chili Peppers were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Since he did not play on any albums, Marshall was not inducted as a member; however, drummer Chad Smith thanked Marshall along with other former members for their contributions to the band. ==Post-Red Hot Chili Peppers musical career== After his departure from the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Marshall joined Macy Gray's band, playing guitar on her releases: On How Life Is (1999), The Id (2001) and The Trouble With Being Myself (2003). As a member of Gray's band, Marshall toured extensively, internationally and in the United States. In 2010, he performed with her at a benefit concert for Haiti. Marshall contributed to three Weapon of Choice releases: Highperspice (1996), Illoominutty (2002) and Color Me Funky (2004), and appeared on the recordings of Moloko and Poe. He co-wrote a song which was recorded by Rod Stewart in 2003. Other artists he has recorded or performed with include: Chaka Khan, The Prodigy, George Clinton and Parliament Funkadelic, Ice Cube, Björk, Jodeci, Lisa Marie Presley, Soundgarden, Pearl Jam, the Circle Jerks and Carlos Santana. Marshall continued to perform on his own and to work on solo projects, independently producing and releasing four albums: Memories of Amnesia (2001), Fantaseality (2003), Pleasures of the Funky (2005) and Heaven's Ghetto (2009). He self-published a book of poetry in 2008, titled B.A.D. Words: the alphabet music of Ah'Reek Marshall. In 2011, he released a children's book, Bumble-Bee Yourself, a collaboration with illustrator Mimi Kang. In 2011 Arik released a music video for \\"True To The Almighty\\" a single from his Memories of Amnesia cd. He is currently working on a music video for \\"Heaven's Ghetto\\" single, When the Sound Starts Moving. ==Film and television appearances== Marshall appeared on Saturday Night Live and The Rosie O'Donnell Show with Macy Gray. He performed at the 1992 MTV Video Music Awards and the 1993 Grammy Awards shows with the Red Hot Chili Peppers. He appeared on the Simpsons episode \\"Krusty Gets Kancelled\\" as part of the Red Hot Chili Peppers' cameo appearance. He appeared in 2002's Spider- Man movie in a cameo appearance with Macy Gray. He acted in and wrote the soundtrack to an Academy Award-winning USC student film, Peace & Quiet. In an interview in 2007, Marshall said of the film, \\"I played a mulatto punk-rocker who destroys this old guys suburban home...right in front of him! I wore a Mohawk and a Funkadelic t-shirt...\\" Marshall appeared as the guitarist in the wedding scene of the 2009 movie The Hangover. ==References== Category:1967 births Category:African-American rock musicians Category:African-American rock singers Category:African-American Jews Category:Jewish American musicians Category:American rock guitarists Category:American male guitarists Category:Red Hot Chili Peppers members Category:Living people Category:20th- century American guitarists ","title":"Arik Marshall"},{"id":"2212101","text":"Coat of arms of Louis Chamniern Santisukniram.

It is a suffragan diocese of the Archdiocese of Onitsha. Its first bishop is John Ifeanyichukwu Okoye. The St. Michael Archangel Parish Church in Awgu is the largest church in the diocese and will therefore become its cathedral. The Diocese covers an area of 1,310 km² of the Enugu State, covering the local government areas: Awgu, Agbogugu, Inyi, Ndeabor, Nnenwe, Owelli and Oji Rivers (except the parish of Ukwuoba). Neighboring dioceses are Enugu to the north, Abakaliki to the east, Umuahia to the south and Awka to the west. The total population in the diocese is 600,000, of which 360,000 are Roman Catholic. The diocese is subdivided into 42 parishes. Further Information The people of Awgu geographical circumscription were a deeply religious people; who before the advent of Christianity in Igboland had a common religious heritage of a belief in One, Unseen, Omnipotent God. This Almighty God was referred to as Ali Awgu (the Awgu earth goddess). No wonder such popular expressions as \\"Ali Awgu Chewe Nwawu\\" (Ali Awgu protect your child) is common among Awgu people. This belief and sense of Sacred in this Ali Awgu is peculiar to Awgu people. This belief and sense of sacred in this Ali Awgu is peculiar to Awgu religious tradition permeated and prevailed over the social, moral, spiritual, mutual and stereological background of the people before the beginning of the Christian religion. The remotest beginning of the Catholic presence in the Awgu division dates back to the acts of the French catholic Missionaries that came to Eastern Nigeria under Fr. J. E. Lutz in 1885 pitching their first tent at Holy trinity in Onitsha. The evangelical activities of these French Holy Ghost missionaries spread to Enugu Section and consequently to Awgu sub- section by the early years of 20th century. The missionary development in Awgu came mainly from Eke town in Udi division, and partly from Uturu in Okigwe. What we call Awgu Diocese today is therefore a historical effect of synthetic, missionary roles and contributes from Eke and Uturu Catholic Missions. As early as 1912, Chief Onyeama (the warrant paramount Chief of Eke town) in his bid to attract Western Education for his children and people, had gathered a handful of people (Catechumen) amidst the already existing Anglican adherents that were found around Eke and Abor towns. Diocesan Directory 7. His invitation to the Catholic Missionaries brought Fr. Joseph Shanahan to Eke in 1914; who laid the first foundation of the old Eke Parish/School out of which sprang the spread of other Catholic Missions in the current Enugu part of Eastern Nigeria. As the incumbent and first Bishop of Awgu, Rt. Rev. Dr. J. I. Okoye wrote in his B.D. Thesis, Christianity in Mbanabo, its Advent growth, and Future, \\"It was indeed at Eke that the religious tree which spread its branches to other parts of Enugu Diocese was planted, watered and nurtured\\". Eke Parish was the cradle of the faith that has today become the Diocese of Nsukka, Abakaliki, Makurdi, Oturkpo, Ogoja, and Enugu. It was in 1921 that the Roman Catholic Mission set up a School/Church at Oke-Oli Ali-Awgu (St. Michael's Awgu) which attracted over 100 converts in less than one year. They were received and harbored by Late Chief Chukwunta Nwachumolie. The first teacher to St. Michael's School/Church, Awgu, one Mr. Ofodiamah from Ogwashi uku of the present Delta State of Nigeria. And the first Holy Mass at St. Michael's Awgu was at Oke-Ali-Ohaja Awgu by Rev. Fr. Grandin. On the other hand, the missionary movement into Awgu from Uturu, Okigwe was orchestrated by the existence/construction of railway line from Enugu to Port Harcourt in 1915. This made that Ndeabor Railway Stations a whirlpool of so many itineraries, mercantile and even evangelical interactions. This created and provided a pastoral relationship between St. Michael's Awgu and the Roman Catholic Mission at Uturu, Okigwe (which was nearer to Awgu than Eke) which was already established in 1912\\\\. In 1926, Rev. Fr. Treich, the first priest to minister to the faithful at St. Michael's Church, Awgu from Uturu prepared Catechumen who received their First Holy Diocesan Directory 8. Communion on 21 October 1926. However, given the foundation of another Church in Awgu region at Mmaku, which was raised to a parish status in 1922, St. Michael's Awgu was under Mmaku Parish until 1948 when she was made a parish too. Out of these two sources (Eke and Uturu), the church continued to spread in Awgu areas with joyful yet uneasy circumstances, on both sides of the missionaries and mission converts. There were days of thug-of-war between native ancestral religion and Christianity and of oscillation of people from old traditional civilization and the emerging one that is Christian and exotic. Given limited pastors and prevalent pressures from conflicting old and new faiths, it was really martyrdom like and heroic to be a Christian then. But it was out of these rocky roots that today we rejoice to the harvest of a young, buoyant and vibrant Awgu ecclesiastical circumscription. Awgu was created a diocese by Pope Benedict XVI on the 8th of July, 2005. On the 29th day of September, it was canonically erected and Most Rev. John Ifeanyichukwu Okoye ordained and enthroned as its first bishop.

In his rookie season, he was selected to the Pro Bowl after setting Chiefs records for most yards in a season (1,121), most yards in a game (193 vs. Houston), most consecutive 100-yard-plus games (three) and most 100-yard games in a season (five). After coming off the bench to record 101 rushing yards in his initial NFL action at New England, he ran for 106 yards and registered 104 receiving yards in his first professional start against Oakland. In the Chiefs' October 18, 1981 game against the Denver Broncos, Delaney broke loose for a 75-yard touchdown run, but an offside penalty caused the play to be restarted from five yards back. On the second play after the penalty, Delaney scored an 82-yard touchdown, the longest rushing play from scrimmage in the 1981 NFL season. Following Delaney's record-setting 196-yard rushing performance against the Houston Oilers on November 15, 1981, Oilers defensive end (and future Pro Football Hall of Famer) Elvin Bethea was quoted in saying: A strike by NFL players and an eye injury limited Delaney's playing time in the 1982 NFL season. He underwent surgery to repair a detached retina, and only registered 380 rushing yards in the eight-game shortened season, which the Chiefs finished with a 3–6 record. Delaney averaged 4.6 yards per carry, 9.1 yards per reception, and registered 1,811 all-purpose yards during his career with three touchdowns. === Professional statistics === {  style=\\"text-align: center;\\" !colspan=2 !colspan=6Rushing !colspan=5Receiving !colspan=5Kick returns - !Year !G !Att !Yds !Avg !TD !Lg !Fum !Rec !Yds !Avg !TD !Lg !Rt !Yds !TD !Lg !Avg - 1981 15 234 1,121 4.8 3 82 9 22 246 11.2 0 61 1 11 0 11 11 - 1982 8 95 380 4.0 0 36 0 11 53 4.8 0 13 0 0 0 0 0 - colspan=18Source: Pro Football Reference } == Death and legacy == Delaney had a lifelong history of helping others, and once paid for the funeral of a former teacher whose family could not afford a proper service. On June 29, 1983, Delaney, who was living in nearby Ruston, went with friends to Critter's Creek, an amusement center at Chennault Park in Monroe, Louisiana. While reportedly discouraging swimming children from venturing too far out in a pond, Delaney dove in to save three children who were screaming for help, floundering in a water hole left by recent construction work.Althaus, p. 139 The water hole, which covered two acres and was six feet deep, was not intended for swimming but to add to the park's aesthetics.Althaus, p. 140 Despite his inability to swim,Minden Press- Herald, July 1, 1983, p. 1 Delaney nevertheless tried to rescue the children. One child managed to get out of the water without harm and another was taken to an emergency room where he later died; police recovered the body of Delaney and the remaining child. The amusement park has since been closed to the public. Delaney's name is commemorated at Arrowhead Stadium in the Kansas City Chiefs ring of honor. Three thousand people attended Delaney's burial and memorial service on July 4 which was held in the sweltering heat of the Haughton High School gymnasium. Many fanned themselves with fans provided from the funeral home to combat the oppressive heat. President Ronald Reagan honored Delaney with the Presidential Citizens Medal on July 15, and it was presented to Delaney's family by Vice President George H. W. Bush. Reagan's words were: For the 1983 NFL season, the Chiefs honored Delaney by wearing a circular patch bearing a gold eagle and the number 37 on the upper-left chest of their uniforms. Haughton High School also made a park, Joe Delaney Park, in his memory. The NCAA posthumously awarded Delaney the NCAA Award of Valor in 1984. Louisiana Governor Dave Treen presented the Louisiana State Civilian Bravery Award to Delaney's family following his death. Delaney's heroism is honored through an award for one of the NFL's best running backs who also demonstrates admirable character and unselfishness, traits that were embodied by Delaney. The award is given annually by ProFootballTalk.com. Northwestern State's football permanent team captains award, the Joe Delaney Memorial Leadership award, is named in his honor, as is the annual spring football game (\\"Delaney Bowl\\") and a golf tournament that generates support for the athletic program. A permanent shrine honoring him sits under the home stands at Northwestern State's Turpin Stadium and his number 44 jersey hangs in the football offices. In Virginia, the Delaney Athletic Conference took its name to honor his memory in the fall of 1983, and today 13 Virginia private high schools comprise the DAC. A group of Chiefs fans in Kansas City formed the \\"37Forever Foundation\\", which works with the American Red Cross to provide swimming lessons for underprivileged children. The Kansas City Chiefs unofficially retired Delaney's jersey number 37 following his death, and he was elected to the team's Hall of Fame in 2004. His name is included in the Chiefs' ring of honor at Arrowhead Stadium. Delaney is also the uncle of LSU wide receiver Terrace Marshall Jr. == See also == * List of American football players who died during their careers * Delaney Athletic Conference == References == ;General * Althaus, Bill (2007).

Cover art was by Kevin Jenkins with Russ Nicholson and Arun Pottier providing maps and illustrations. Originally planned as a twelve-book series, only six were released between 1995 and 1996 before the series was cancelled. The first two books were also printed under the name Quest in the U.S. by publishers Price Stern Sloan. Beginning in July 2015, the makers of Fabled Lands launched a Kickstarter campaign to fund completion of Book Seven; the Kickstarter campaign hit its base target within the first 45 minutes it was online.https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/57119387/fabled-lands-the-serpent- kings-domain The books are now back in print and available on Amazon as of December 2010. Two iPad, iPhone and iPod Touch applications were developed by Megara Entertainment. The first app, based on The War-Torn Kingdom, included new colour art and original coloured in art from Russ Nicholson, and was released on January 20, 2011. The second app was released in June, 2011. Following Megara's decision to withdraw from app development in 2012, digital rights reverted to the authors and the apps were withdrawn from sale. A Fabled Lands Role Playing Game and 12 source books based on the original game books were planned to be written by Shane Garvey and Jamie Wallis of Greywood Publishing, however only the core book and the first source book (titled Sokara - The War-Torn Kingdom) were released. The RPG rules were based on the original rules of the game books but expanded to accommodate an adventuring party in a pen-and-paper roleplaying context, rather than as a gamebook experience for a solo player. The RPG and first of the source books were released in mid-2011.Fabled Lands Blog - Announcement of Iphone application ==Overview== The books deviated from other mainstream gamebooks (such as the Fighting Fantasy or Lone Wolf series) in a number of ways. The most notable of these was the open-ended, free roaming gameplay. Other gamebooks gave the character a linear quest, with some leniency in how they went about accomplishing it; when they completed the quest, the gamebook ended. The Fabled Lands series gave the player an entire fantasy world to roam around in, doing whatever they wished with no limits or linearity; there was no set quest and there is no way to \\"finish\\" the series (unless the player dies). There are hundreds of quests in the six books that were published, of varying lengths. The player is free to pursue these at their leisure, or spend their time doing entirely different things - wandering, trading, exploring or building up their abilities. Each book contained a different geographic area of the Fabled Lands, and the player could easily travel between regions by switching to another book. The books became increasingly difficult as they progressed, with tougher enemies and harder quests; this was to account for the player becoming more powerful as they went through each book. Other differences between previous gamebook series included: * A greater number of sections, 679 to 786 * Large (A4) format with fold-out character sheet and colour map * Open-ended trade via marketplace goods, investment or shipping * Acquisition of large assets such as houses and ships * Plot discovery through use of uncovered keywords Although the final six books in the series have never been published (or even written), Dave Morris has indicated in the past that he is interested in reviving the series: On September 13, 2010, Dave Morris indicated that the series had a possible chance of a revival on his blog, saying, in response to a fan query about the future of the fabled lands and particularly the book The Serpent King's Domain, \\"My lips are sealed, though I will say that Frank Johnson, the head of Fabled Lands LLP, was throwing those same words around last week. He might even have thrown in a labyrinth and some legions :)\\".Fabled Lands Blog In a later announcement, Morris indicated that the publisher was willing to greenlight the production of books 7-12 of the series, provided that the reprintings of books 1-6 each sold approximately ten thousand copies.Fabled Lands Blog: Return to Fabled Lands In 2015, Book 7 of the series, titled \\"The Serpent-King's Domain,\\" was funded successfully via a Kickstarter campaign. Series creators Morris and Thomson did not write Book 7, but were involved with the Kickstarter campaign, and Thomson appeared in- person in a promotional video for the Kickstarter campaign. Paul Gresty wrote Book 7, and Mikaël Louys and Richard S. Hetley co-produced. Russ Nicholson returned to provide illustrations and Kevin Jenkins returned to create the cover of Book 7. A playable demo of Book 7 was made available to the public for free download via the Kickstarter campaign page. In 2016, Morris revealed the map of Ankon-Konu, the setting for Book 7, on the Fabled Lands blog. Book 7 is currently available for purchase at Amazon.com. ==System== The Fabled Lands system was fairly simple, as with most other gamebooks. The player has six basic attributes: * Charisma - the knack of befriending and impressing people; also represents bardic skills * Combat - fighting skills * Magic - the art of casting spells * Sanctity - the gift of divine power and wisdom * Scouting - the techniques of tracking and wilderness lore * Thievery - the talent for stealth, agility and lock picking The player's initial score in each of these six attributes is determined by their chosen profession. There are six different professions to choose from: Warrior, Mage, Priest, Rogue, Troubadour and Wayfarer (a wandering traveller, most similar to Rangers in other fantasy systems). Each profession is proficient or weak in different abilities; for example, Priests have high SANCTITY but low COMBAT scores, and Wayfarers have high SCOUTING but low CHARISMA scores. The player has opportunities to increase these abilities throughout the books by completing quests. For example, after successfully tracking down a wild boar in a forest, the player can roll two dice, and if they score higher than their SCOUTING ability they can increase it by 1. No ability can be raised higher than 12, or drop below 1. When the player is given the opportunity to use an ability, the task is given a Difficulty rating. The player rolls two dice and adds their score in the ability; to succeed in the task, they must score higher than the difficulty. For example, a player wishes to calm down an angry innkeeper. This might have a CHARISMA score of 9, and the player's CHARISMA ability is 3. The player would have to roll 7 or higher to succeed. It is possible to obtain \\"blessings\\" in various abilities from different shrines and temples, which allow the player to reroll failed ability rolls. These work once only, however, and cost money. Combat in the Fabled Lands is an extension of ability rolls; the enemy's DEFENSE is the Difficulty, and the player uses their COMBAT skill to try to defeat their opponent. The amount the player rolls above the enemy's DEFENSE is how many Stamina points the enemy loses. The player's own DEFENSE score is equal to their Rank + their COMBAT score + the bonus for any armor they are wearing (if any). Their own Stamina score is given when they begin playing, and can be increased by going up in Rank (which gives them 1d6 Stamina). The player's starting Rank is equal to the number of the book they begin in (e.g. a player starting in The War-Torn Kingdom begins at 1st Rank, while a player starting in Lords of the Rising Sun begins at 6th Rank). The player can increase Rank by performing extremely difficult tasks, such as slaying a dragon or defeating three samurai in unarmed combat (the book will tell the player when they can increase in Rank). The player can carry up to 12 possessions, which are marked in bold text (e.g. \\"gold compass\\"). Some items give ability bonuses - for example, an \\"amber wand (MAGIC +1)\\" or a set of \\"splint armour (DEFENCE + 4)\\". The player can carry unlimited amounts of cash. The series feature a number of smaller quests, which can help the player increase their personal might, status and wealth. Many of these, however, are profession-specific: In the War-Torn Kingdom, for instance, only a Wayfarer will get the Chief Druid's mission on the Druid's Isle, while in The Plains of Howling Darkness only a Rogue may claim the title of 'Nightstalker'. ==Books1. The War-Torn Kingdom=== Sokara, a nation at war with itself Set in the land of Sokara, shortly after a civil war in which the king was overthrown in a military coup. This background provides the book's two major quests; the player can choose to either help the heir to the throne and his band of partisans regain power, or assist the new leader General Grieve Marlock in crushing the last few pockets of resistance. Other quests involve assassinating the king of the rat-men infesting the sewers in the city of Yellowport, looting treasure from the lair of Vayss the Sea Dragon, delivering packages between the druids of the City of Trees and the Forest of Larun, defeating the Black Dragon Knight in combat to the death and rescuing a trapped god from the summit of Devil's Peak. 679 sections, ===2. Cities of Gold and Glory=== Golnir, a wealthy land steeped in curious folklore Set in the prosperous kingdom of Golnir, wealthy from its rich agriculture. A common complaint readers had about the second book was that it was far more difficult to find quests than in the first book. There are still several major quests, however, including slaying a dragon for the Baroness Ravayne (the ruler of Golnir), searching for magical artefacts for the wizard Estragon, bringing to justice a murderer on behalf of his victim's ghost, finding the key of stars to gain access to a treasure filled tomb in the Forest of the Forsaken and making a map of the northern mountains. The quests in the second book have a more whimsical, fairy tale nature to them than those in the first book. This gives Golnir a very strong Merry England atmosphere. 786 sections, ===3. Over the Blood-Dark Sea=== Swashbuckling adventure on the high seas Set in the Violet Ocean, which separates the northern continent of Harkuna from the southern continent of Ankon-Konu. Travel is severely restricted without a ship, making it a difficult book to start off in, particularly for less experienced gamebook readers. Over the Blood-Dark Sea is also one of the first in the series to feature regular danger - the player is almost always at risk of pirates, storms and even sea monsters. Key quests include assassinating Amcha, king of the pirates, enrolling at a wizard's college in the city of Dweomer to learn magic, searching for buried treasure on hidden islands and climbing the enormous mountain on Starspike Island. 718 sections, ===4. The Plains of Howling Darkness=== The desolate wastes of the Great Steppes Set in the Great Steppes, an environment of grasslands, plains and tundra similar to Siberia and Mongolia. Key quests include liberating the Citadel of Veris Corin for the King of Sokara (closely linked with quests in The War-Torn Kingdom), releasing the King of Harkuna from his prison underneath the Rimewater (closely linked with quests in The Court of Hidden Faces) and killing the immortal tyrant Kaschuf (based on the legend of Koschei the Deathless) who rules over the village of Vodhya (which requires the player to find and release his soul, hidden on an island in Over The Blood-Dark Sea). This was the first book in the series to introduce the concept of a harsh environment - out on the Steppes, the player must make constant SCOUTING rolls in order to find enough food, and on the northern steppes the player loses one point of stamina a day from the cold, unless they have a wolf pelt to keep warm. 710 sections, ===5. The Court of Hidden Faces=== Exotic intrigue in Uttaku and Old Harkuna Set in the nation of Uttaku (similar to the Byzantine Empire), which is occupying the kingdom of Old Harkuna (similar to the lands of Arthurian legend). If the player frees the king of Old Harkuna from his prison in The Plains of Howling Darkness, the king can reclaim his land, end the Uttaku occupation and restore prosperity. There is also an abandoned castle in Harkuna which the player can rebuild and claim for himself. Most other major quests involve undertaking tasks for the Uttakin government (the titular Court). The book takes its title from Uttaku's court of ruling nobles, who wear elaborate masks as a status symbol and to hide their faces. The king himself is born without a face at all. 723 sections, ===6. Lords of the Rising Sun=== Imperial Akatsurai, land of samurai and ninja Set in a land which is an obvious parallel of classical Japan of the Heian period. Much like The War Torn Kingdom, a revolution is occurring. The self-proclaimed Shogun Yoritomo has declared himself in charge of the eastern seaboard, while the young Imperial Sovereign Takakura rules the country nominally, with real power being in the hands of the chancellor, Lord Kiyomori, who remains in control of the western seaboard. The country is on the brink of a civil war (like Japan during the Genpei War to which the names \\"Yoritomo\\" and \\"Kiyomori\\" allude). Although the player can undertake quests for both sides of the revolution, the two forces never actually begin war as they do in the first book. Other major quests involving retrieving a tatsu pearl from a great dragon, exploring Kwaidan Forest to learn the secrets of the tengu, and venturing into the Black Pagoda. 750 sections, ===7. The Serpent King's Domain=== The lost tribes of the Feathered Lands Set in the jungles of the southern continent of Ankon- Konu, a land similar to South America. This book was not published in the 1990s, but in 2018 after a successful Kickstarter campaign.https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/57119387/fabled-lands-the- serpent-kings-domain It was written by Paul Gresty. The spirit realm, Elaz Carnquen, hangs closely over this world, which allows you travel into the spirit realm and engage in spiritual combat using a new value called \\"Nahual.\\" Due to the excessive heat of Ankon-Konu, many types of armor (such as plate armor) handicap the player's COMBAT value if worn, and other types of armor (such as cotton armor) provide lower defense bonuses without handicaps to a player's COMBAT value. Quests include activating the titan at Borotek, restoring order at Ruined Tarshesh over who was to blame for its fall, defeating the Serpent King, Namagal (which requires some mini-quests on its own), and merging with the verdant spire, which allows dominance over the land itself. 1200 sections, ===8. The Lone and Level Sands=== The harsh deserts of western Ankon-konu This book was never published, but it would have been set in the Desert of Bones, in Ankon-Konu. This presumably would have been the Fabled Lands' equivalent of the Sahara. Notes from David Morris indicate the region is home to genii and inspired by the Thousand and One Arabian Nights. It also featured the Blue Grasslands, which according to information in the first six books is populated by blue-skinned nomads - descendants of the Uttakin featured in The Court Of Hidden Faces - and tribes like the Golden men and their flying arks. Other locations would have been the City of Stargazers, and the Country of the Hidden Ones - judging from information in the first six books, and the names on the map, it would have been similar to the Himalayan countries of Nepal, Tibet and Bhutan. The phrase 'the lone and level sands' appears in Shelley's poem Ozymandias. ===9. The Isle of a Thousand Spires=== Chrysoprais and the Sea of Stilts This book was never published, but it would have been set (as the subtitle implies) in the western locations of Chrysoprais and the Sea of Stilts. Chrysoprais presumably would have been very similar to India; the names on the maps have an Indian flavour (for example, the Crimson Fort rather than the Red Fort). Also, a few clues are left in the first six books regarding the culture of Chrysoprais - for example, in the Japanese-inspired land of Akatsurai featured in Lords of the Rising Sun, there is a religion following the \\"Sage of Peace\\" which is clearly based on Buddhism. If the player fails in a quest relating to the Sage of Peace, they can travel west to \\"the saint of Vulture Peak\\" (found in Chrysoprais) to seek redemption and enlightenment. This suggests that people in both Chrysoprais and Akatsurai worship the Sage of Peace; in real life, Buddhism originated in India and later spread to Japan. ===10. Legions of the Labyrinth=== Philosopher kings of the west This book was never published, but would have been set in the western lands of Atticala. Atticala was clearly inspired by Ancient Greece; the map of the Fabled Lands reveals this, as many of the towns have Greek-sounding names and are symbolised by Greek architecture. The name \\"Atticala\\" is also similar to \\"Attica\\", a region of Greece. ===11. The City in the Clouds=== Danger in the heart of a vast metropolis This book was never published, but was to have been set in the city of Dangor in the mysterious \\"Forbidden Realm.\\" It is not known how the book would have been structured to fit within a single city - all other Fabled Lands books were spread over an entire landscape, with many cities and towns in between. Very little is known about Dangor, except that it is situated at the top of cliffs hundreds of metres high called \\"The Golden Cliffs.\\" Dangor's harbour is apparently at the very top of these cliffs, with the rest of the city. In Over The Blood Dark Sea, the player can read the account of a Sokaran sailor in the library of Dweomer. He recounts of how his ship waited for three days at the bottom of the cliffs, while a mountain climber took their documents to the port authorities above. When all was found to be in order, \\"grapples were lowered and secured and the whole vessel was winched up to the docks a thousand feet above.\\" Dangor may have been inspired by the near East, as it is symbolized by what appears to be a near Eastern palace on the map. ===12. Into the Underworld=== The ultimate journey This book was never published, but it would have been set in the underworld of the Fabled Lands. Whether the authors intended for this to be a series of caves and caverns or a literal Hell (or both) is uncertain; there are many entrances to the twelfth book throughout the first six. Some of these are through caves and tunnels, while others are through magical gateways, by falling off the edge of the world (in both of these instances the player is told that they will arrive in \\"Hell\\"), or even board a ship in a celestial harbor. A series of magical gateways found throughout the books allows the player to travel instantaneously to the many cities of the Fabled Lands, including those in books that were never published. One of these was called \\"Erebus\\" and sent the player to the twelfth book. In Greek mythology, Erebus was a god associated with the underworld. ==Reception== Scott Malthouse of The Trollish Delver gave the Fabled Lands series a positive review based upon a playthrough of Book 1, remarking that \\"Fabled Lands is nothing short of astonishing. It presents a living world that you can do pretty much what you want in. With other books added to your repertoire there is seemingly no end to the adventures that you can have in this fantasy world.\\" Steve Faragher reviewed the Fabled Lands series for Arcane magazine, rating it a 5 out of 10 overall. Faragher comments that \\"All in all, these books represent a pleasant but ultimately unchallenging diversion for younger players. A better option would be to get someone older to run a simple AD&D; game.\\" Byron Alexander Campbell of Entropy magazine gave the Fabled Lands series a more positive review based upon a playthrough of Book 5, remarking \\"It’s not perfect, of course – there’s a bit too much ticking and erasing boxes, especially when death is always so close on your heels – but damn if it’s not satisfying. For reasons I can’t quite describe, being able to trace roads and geographic features on a map and read my way through those same locations, but full of people, weather and birdsong, just feels great... One of the most enticing things about Fabled Lands is the way that every book provides a way in. Each book is a microcosm of the same world, and while they get progressively more challenging with each successive release, there is nothing narratively that compels you to read them in order.\\" ==Planned MMO== In 1996, the authors decided to use their experience with gamebooks to enter the computer games industry – taking the Fabled Lands series with them. They started work at Eidos Interactive on an MMO. Eidos was sceptical as to whether an MMO could be successful, but was interested to see what might happen, and set the authors up with a team to research the relevant technology. The team's plans for the game were extremely ambitious for the late 1990s, as the Fabled Lands MMO was supposed to include an advanced AI that acted as a digital gamesmaster, tailoring the experience for each player. The game was never released; according to Morris and Thomson, this was caused by their own over-ambitious designs, colleagues who didn't understand their ideas and the general poor management of game design and development at the time.bit-tech.net ==See also== * Gamebook * Fighting Fantasy * Choose Your Own Adventure ==References * Details on the Fabled Lands series at Gamebooks.org * Webpage of Java Fabled Lands (formerly FLApp), a Java-based computer program which allows you to play the six published books * Extensive interview with the authors about their planned MMO Category:Gamebooks Category:Series of books Category:Fantasy gamebooks Category:British role-playing games ","title":"Fabled Lands"},{"id":"2212142","text":"Robert James \\"Sam\\" Berry (26 October 1934 – 29 March 2018Obituary – Professor Sam BerryBerry) was a British geneticist, naturalist and Christian theorist.

Chimel then began announcing duties for the company in 1989, working mostly televised B-Shows or non-televised house shows and filling in for Howard Finkel whenever necessary, including appearances on Raw. SmackDown (1999–2007) Chimel was the SmackDown! ring announcer from its inception in 1999. He was also the ring announcer at SmackDown brand pay-per-views from 2002-2007. He defeated Howard Finkel for the rights to be SmackDown! announcer in 1999 in a tuxedo match. On Kurt Angle's final episode as SmackDown General Manager in 2004, he demanded Chimel to come into the ring and give an apology to him; Chimel complied but then was fired by Angle. He was almost immediately re-hired by Vince McMahon. Mr. Kennedy during his feud with Tony Chimel From 2005 to 2007 Chimel was involved in a mini-feud with Mr. Kennedy, who claimed that Chimel was not announcing his name with the proper respect that it deserved. This feud included Chimel being punched, being \\"told to take a bow\\" (hit in the groin), and having a doughnut shoved in his mouth by Kennedy. On the December 22, 2006 episode of SmackDown, he announced The Boogeyman as victorious too enthusiastically and caught his attention. The Boogeyman forced worms into his mouth as a result. Chimel ran away from the ring afterwards. This was a storyline for Chimel to take some time off to rest his nagging back injury and spend more time with his family. ECW announcer Justin Roberts was the ring announcer of SmackDown until Chimel returned on April 13, 2007. Various brand switches (2007–2015) In 2007, Chimel swapped ring announcing duties with Justin Roberts, becoming the ring announcer for the ECW brand. Chimel began announcing on WWE Superstars, and made his first appearance on the April 30, 2009 episode. After Justin Roberts left SmackDown to become the new ring announcer for the Raw brand, Chimel left ECW and returned to SmackDown for his second stint as ring announcer. He then became the announcer of the ECW brand when the last ECW announcer, Lauren Mayhew, quickly left the WWE, before returning to SmackDown. During this time, Chimel began to gain a reputation for his announcements for Edge, who had recently dubbed himself \\"The Rated-R Superstar\\". During these announcements, Chimel's voice would frequently crack while saying the word \\"superstar\\". This would become something of a running joke on WWE TV, leading to Chimel making guest appearances solely to announce Edge. He was demoted from SmackDown when former Raw announcer Lilian Garcia returned to the WWE in December 2011. At the December 27 taping of SmackDown, NXT, & Superstars, it was revealed that Chimel would be announcing for NXT and the SmackDown portion of Superstars, replacing the departing Eden Stiles. Chimel announced for NXT until the end of the final season of its original run. He was the ring announcer for Main Event as well as for WWE live events until June 24, 2014, and he was the ring announcer for the short-lived Saturday Morning Slam. He briefly returned to Raw on September 9, 2013, and SmackDown on September 13, 2013, to announce the returning Edge to the ring. On November 16, 2013 at a WWE live event in the United Kingdom, Chimel delivered a stunner to Curtis Axel after Axel forced Chimel to announce that Axel was still the Intercontinental Champion following Axel's win over R-Truth. Afterward, Chimel was kissed by one of the Bella Twins. On the May 14, 2014 episode of Main Event, Tony was attacked by Alicia Fox during her meltdown after she lost to Emma. On the December 29 episode of Raw, Chimel returned to announce Edge and Christian. He would also announce their appearances on the December 30 episode of Main Event and the January 2, 2015 episode of SmackDown. Sporadic appearances (2015–present) Chimel later took a hiatus from announcing with WWE. During the hiatus, he announced at house shows only. Chimel returned to WWE television on the December 28, 2015 edition of Raw. He would return at Fastlane 2016 to introduce Edge and Christian. Chimel has since been reserved, only to introduce Edge whenever he appeared on television. Chimel once again returned to WWE television on November 15, 2016 during the 900th episode of SmackDown. At this appearance, he did his trademark introduction of Edge, before the Cutting Edge segment. Chimel returned during Beth Phoenix's induction in the 2017 WWE Hall of Fame to announce her husband Edge's name. Chimel now works primarily behind the scenes for WWE, working as a production manager and as part of the ring crew. ==Other media== Chimel appears in the video games WWE Day of Reckoning 2, WWE SmackDown! vs. Raw 2006, WWE Smackdown vs. Raw 2007, WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2008, WWE Smackdown vs. Raw 2009, WWE Smackdown vs. Raw 2010, WWE Smackdown vs. Raw 2011, WWE '12, WWE Wrestlefest, WWE '13, WWE 2K15 as part of the One More Match & The Hall of Pain DLC packs, and WWE 2K16 for SmackDown! in the 3:16 Showcase. ==Personal life== Chimel named his son Joey after Joey Marella, a referee and the adopted son of Gorilla Monsoon, who was killed in an automobile accident. He was once taken out by stretcher after being superkicked by Shawn Michaels ringside during his Iron Man match against Bret Hart at WrestleMania XII in 1996. ==References* Category:Living people Category:People from Cherry Hill, New Jersey Category:Professional wrestling announcers Category:Sportspeople from the Delaware Valley Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Tony Chimel"},{"id":"2212153","text":"The New York State Association of Independent Schools (NYSAIS) is an association of 198 independent schools and organizations, ranging from nurseries to high schools, in New York State.

It was established \\"to protect independent schools from obstructive legislation and regulation\\". NYSAIS accredits member schools, provides professional development, and works with community leaders to support the needs and interests of independent schools throughout the state. NYSAIS is a member of the National Association of Independent Schools (NAIS) as well the International Council Advancing Independent School Accreditation (ICAISA). ==Mission statement== \\"The New York State Association of Independent Schools promotes the independence, well-being, and public understanding of, and respect for, New York independent schools and serves as an accrediting body chartered by the New York State Board of Regents.\\" To accomplish its mission, the New York State Association of Independent Schools: * \\"Establishes the criteria which reflect the values and best educational practices for evaluating and accrediting member schools; * \\"Promotes professional growth of teachers, administrators, and trustees through workshops, conferences, and exchanges; * \\"Informs and counsels the leadership at member schools in matters of legislation and regulation; * \\"Facilitates the development of cooperative projects among member schools, and between member schools and public schools; * \\"Fosters mutually beneficial relations with the New York State Education Department, the National Association of Independent Schools, other educational associations and the general public; * \\"Informs member schools about significant practices and developments in independent education; and * \\"Provides such other services as will benefit the member schools and the communities they serve.\\" ==Governing body and administration== The New York State Association of Independent Schools is governed by a Board of Trustees which meets on a regular basis, including an annual meeting at Mohonk Mountain House on the first Wednesday of November.

Clement III (The Browning School), Rick Bryan (Nichols School), Drew Castertano (Millbrook School), Dorothy A. Hutcheson (The Nightingale-Bamford School), Charles Hertrick (Allendale Columbia School), and Archibald A. Smith III (Trinity- Pawling School).Peters 2014 p193-105 ==HistoryEarly years and incorporation=== On April 17, 1947, Paul D. Shafer, President of the Packer Collegiate Institute in Brooklyn sent out a letter to ten colleagues at other New York independent schools to discuss the founding of an association for New York independent schools. Those who received the letter were; * Dr. Joseph Allen (Poly Prep Country Day School in Brooklyn) * Mr. Harold C. Amos (Adelphi Academy in Brooklyn) * Mr. Philip M. B. Babcock (Nichols School in Buffalo) * Mr. Charles W. Bradlee (Pebble Hill School in DeWitt) * Dr. Howard I. Dillingham (The Manlius School in Manlius) * Dr. Frank Hackett (Riverdale Country School in Riverdale-on-Hudson) * Mrs. Harold S. Osborne (Spence School in NYC) * Mr. Wilson Parkhill (Collegiate School in NYC) * Mr. Morton Snyder (Rye Country Day School in Rye) * Miss Anne Wellington (Emma Willard School in Troy) The New York State Association of Independent Schools held its first official meeting on October 8, 1947, at the Albany Academies. At the meeting on October 8, 1947, it was moved by Mr. Bradlee and seconded by Mr. Amos that they \\"set up the nucleus of a State organization (and) that the name be the New York State Association of Independent Schools (whose) membership...shall be limited to those elementary and secondary schools organized under a State charter as non-profit institutions.\\"Peters 2014 p18-20 The first Annual Meeting of NYSAIS was held on January 18, 1949, at the Emma Willard School in Troy. The first officers were Paul Shafer (President), Anne Wellington (Vice- President), and Harry E. P. Meislahn (Secretary-Treasurer). The first guest at a NYSAIS meeting was Dr. Henry V. Gilson, New York's Associate Commissioner of Education.Peters 2014 p23 On October 25, 1968, NYSAIS was incorporated under a provisional charter granted by the New York State Board of Regents. The provisional charter required that NYSAIS draft a constitution and that a Board of Trustees be established. This was accomplished at the 20th Annual Meeting which was held on November 12, 1968, at Schrafft's Motor Inn in Albany. At this meeting, President Walter Clark announced the appointment of the first Executive Director, Appleton A. Mason Jr., who had previously served as the Headmaster of the Lake Forest Country Day School in Lake Forest, Illinois. The first official office for NYSAIS was at Appleton Mason's home in Loudonville, New York.Peters 2014 p60 === Executive directors === * Appleton A. Mason Jr. (1968–76) was the first Executive Director of the New York State Association of Independent Schools. Important issues to NYSAIS and its member schools during this era included accreditation, the relationship of NYSAIS with the New York State Athletic Council, the formation of the Independent Educational Services non-profit organization, financial sustainability, and the relationship between independent schools and government funding. There also was a recognition that NYSAIS and the Catholic Education Association had much in common. Of significance in 1969 was the requirement that elementary schools which apply for membership in NYSAIS must be accredited.Peters 2014 p59-62 * Stephen Hinrichs (1976–86) served as the second Executive Director. Previously Headmaster at The Harley School in Rochester, Hinrich's appointment was announced by the NYSAIS President Richard Barter at the 28th Annual Meeting which was held at the Hilton Inn in Tarrytown. It was during Stephen Hinrichs' tenure that the NYSAIS Annual Meeting was moved to Mohonk Mountain House with the 30th Annual Meeting on November 2–3, 1978. At this meeting, eighty member schools were in attendance. At the March 1, 1979 Board of Trustees meeting, it was recognized that there was considerable merit in holding a single evaluation for an entire school rather than a NYSAIS evaluation of the elementary school and a Middle States Association evaluation of the secondary level. Throughout Stephen Hinrichs' tenure accreditation and the NYSAIS relationship with the Middle States Association remained an important topic of discussion. During the summer of 1981 the NYSAIS offices were moved to Canandaigua.Peters 2014 p81-83 * Frederick Calder (1986-2007). Formerly Headmaster of Germantown Friends School, Calder was selected to serve as the NYSAIS Executive Director beginning on July 1, 1986, and served until June 2007. At the Board of Trustees meeting on April 16, 1987, Frederick Calder announced that the NYSAIS office would be moved to the campus of the Emma Willard School in Troy because \\"this proximity to the Capitol offices made it easier to keep an eye on legislation...(and) also made it easier for the Executive Director to visit more member schools.\\"Peters 2014 Under Frederick Calder, NYSAIS continued to monitor legislation, coordinate the annual conference and a variety of developing conferences and workshop, and improve the accreditation process. Additionally, during this era, the NYSAIS fiscal year was moved from August 31 to June 30. Additionally, it became increasingly important for NYSAIS to strengthen its ties with other nonpublic schools through the New York State Coalition for Nonpublic Education. By 1993, there were 112 schools in NYSAIS which were either already accredited or scheduled for accreditation. In 1993, NYSAIS invited the Heads of School from the Connecticut Association of Independent Schools (CAIS) to participate in the Heads of School Annual Meeting at Mohonk Mountain House. During the mid-1990s the use of volunteers to run committees was institutionalized and in 1996 NYSAIS established its first website which was funded by a matching grant from the E.E. Ford Foundation. In January 2006, Frederick Calder announced his retirement from NYSAIS to be effective on June 30, 2007. * Elizabeth \\"Penney\\" Riegelman (2007–09) was offered the position of Executive Director on June 28, 2006, to begin her tenure on July 1, 2007, and served until June 30, 2009. Penney Riegelman had been the Head of School at the Newark Academy in Livingston, New Jersey. It was under the Riegelman's leadership that the NYSAIS Charter was amended to include the accreditation of preschools and the initial work to develop a multi-year strategic plan was undertaken.Peters 2014 p151 * Mark W. Lauria (2009–present). Previously Head of School at Foothill Country Day School in Claremont, California and the President of the Board of Trustees for the California Association of Independent Schools, Lauria was appointed as the fifth NYSAIS Executive Director in 2009. During his tenure, one of the biggest changes has been the growing role of technology in NYSAIS member schools.Peters 2014 pg156 According to Peters, \\"truly, 2011 was an exceptional year; so much was accomplished\\" including a revision of the NYSAIS Manual for Evaluation and Accreditation. In addition, the NYSAIS Board of Trustees, on January 19, 2011, voted to form NYSAIS Operations Inc., which would become its own 501(c)(6) nonprofit organization. This new organization would oversee the NYSAIS Healthcare Consortium as well as the advocacy work done on behalf of the NYSAIS schools.Peters 2014 p163 During his tenure, the NYSAIS offices were moved from Schenectady to Albany and annual Regional Meetings were established. The Emerging Leaders Institute (ELI), Division Leaders Institute (DLI), the Justice, Equity and Diversity Institute, Experienced Leaders Advising Schools (ELAS), and NYSAIS-Now' were created under his leadership.Peters 2014 p173-174 ==Membership== NYSAIS has four membership categories: * Full. An independent nursery/kindergarten, elementary or secondary school incorporated as a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit corporation that has served as a provisional member prior to becoming a full member. Prior to becoming a full member, the school must have been operating as an independent nursery/kindergarten, elementary or secondary school for at least five years, must adhere to NYSAIS criteria of non-discrimination in hiring and admissions, and must be accredited by the NYSAIS Commission on Accreditation. * Provisional. An independent nursery/kindergarten, elementary or secondary school elected as such by the Board of Trustees and which is incorporated as a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit corporation, and is willing and able to meet the standards for full membership and accreditation within five years of its election as a provisional member. Provisional members must adhere to NYSAIS criteria of non-discrimination in hiring and admissions. * Associate. An independent educational organization that is not an incorporated not-for- profit (such as a proprietary school) whose standards are neither accredited nor endorsed by NYSAIS, but which is located in the State of New York and is accredited by an accrediting body acceptable to the NYSAIS Trustees. Associate member schools must adhere to the NYSAIS criteria of non-discrimination in hiring and admissions, and be operated for five consecutive years under the same ownership. * Association. A nonprofit association concerned with independent school education elected as such by the NYSAIS Board of Trustees. Association members are not entitled to vote and are not provided with legislative services. Association members of NYSAIS include The Parents League of New York, Prep for Prep, Early Steps, Oliver Scholars and Education Collaborative of WNY. ==Accreditation== left According to the NYSAIS Charter, issued on February 25, 1984, the association has \\"authority to evaluate and accredit schools in the State of New York (which) is conferred by charter from the Regents of the University of New York.\\" All good schools continually evaluate their performance by means of their own devising, but the view a school takes of itself needs periodically to be supplemented by an external view, one that brings a perspective the school cannot command. Formal evaluation combines self-scrutiny with external review by a committee of peers, both processes being guided by the NYSAIS Manual for Evaluation and Accreditation. \\"The Manual gives structure, direction, and scope to the undertaking that goes beyond that which a school might ordinarily elect. The external review brings observations, comments and suggestions possible only for those who are not immersed in the daily concerns of a school’s life.\\" The object in evaluation is to assist the school to better realize its objectives, to support rather than to inspect and to enhance the school's unique character rather than to impose a common design. Thus, a school is evaluated in terms of its own purposes and objectives, not those of some remote authority. The accreditation of the NYSAIS schools is overseen by the NYSAIS Commission on Accreditation, chaired by Bart Baldwin (St. Luke's School). The past chairs were Kate Turley (City and Country School) and William G. Morris, Jr. (Friends Academy). The NYSAIS Associate Directors who oversee NYSAIS Accreditation are Dr. Judith Sheridan and George Swain. NYSAIS is a member of the International Council Advancing Independent School Accreditation (ICAISA). == Professional Learning == Mohonk Mountain House in the fall NYSAIS organizes conferences, workshops, and residential institutes for teachers, school heads, trustees, assistant and division heads, business and financial managers, and administrators.http://www.nysais.org Calendar of NYSAIS Events, Most of the residential conferences are held at Mohonk Mountain House in New Paltz or the Carey Center for Global Good in Rensselaerville. NYSAIS professional learning includes approximately 95 multi-day residential conferences and day-long workshops including the Beginning Teachers Institutes (BTI), Experienced Teachers Institutes (ETI), Emerging Leaders Institutes (ELI), Division Leaders Institute (DLI), the Justice, Equity, and Diversity Institute, as well as topical workshops and conferences for teachers and administrators. Some are collaborative efforts with neighboring state associations of independent schools. NYSAIS professional development provides timely opportunities for education and networking. NYSAIS residential professional learning is directed by Associate Director, Barbara Swanson. The NYSAIS institutes and workshops are directed by Associate Director, Marcy Mann. == Experienced Leaders Advising Schools program == The NYSAIS Experienced Leaders Advising Schools (ELAS) program is a mission-driven initiative established in 2012 to meet a growing need from member schools. ELAS provides high-impact, low-cost advising and mentoring in areas such as governance, leadership, and long-term planning. ELAS advisors (referred to as ELAS Ed-visors) include retired heads of school and senior administrators. ELAS Ed-visors have extensive experience in independent school management and assist NYSAIS schools in finance and investment, fundraising, strategic planning, board structure, governance, succession planning, school leadership, and accreditation. Built upon a solid foundation of best practices combined with current research, each Ed-visement will be custom-designed to meet the specific needs of your educational community. The ELAS program is directed by the NYSAIS Associate Director for Evaluation and Accreditation, Judy Sheridan. == Emerging Leaders Institute == In 2010, participants at the NYSAIS Think Tank identified the need to create a professional development program for emerging leaders in NYSAIS schools. In 2011, NYSAIS launched the NYSAIS Emerging Leaders Institute (ELI) with 16 cohort members. The program is directed by George Swain, Director for Evaluation and Professional Learning, and Marcy Mann, Associate Director for Professional Learning. The current cohort includes participants from a diverse range of backgrounds and independent schools across New York State. Admission to the 2-year program is competitive and must include the strong endorsement of one's current Head of School. Successful completion of this hybrid learning program involves full participation in residential conferences, one-day workshops and online seminars in addition to independent work throughout the two-year cohort experience. Major program components include: * Three residential Summer Leadership Retreats * Attendance at the three-day Associate Heads/Division Heads Conference in Year One * A three-day residential conference of choice in Year Two. Options include: * Admissions * Advancement * Business Affairs * Education and Information Technology * Diversity Practitioners * Learning and the Brain In addition to residential conferences, ELI members participate in: * the NYSAIS Trustee Governance Workshop * monthly online seminars * service on a NYSAIS accreditation visiting committee * a mentor relationship * an independent leadership project in one's school right ==NYSAIS--Now== NYSAIS--Now is a resource for online professional development and school improvement resources. Designed specifically for independent school leaders, it provides information to professionals within the association and beyond. Content covers a broad range of themes and topics with leadership and governance of independent schools as a particular focus. NYSAIS--Now features seminars, interviews, live streaming, and podcasts. right == Athletic association == Under the NYSAIS umbrella, the New York State Association of Independent Schools Athletic Association (NYSAISAA) is a sports league for independent schools in New York State. It is overseen by the Athletic Executive Committee (AEC) as well as the NYSAIS Board of Trustees. ==ReferencesBibliography== * Independent by Design: A History of the New York State Association of Independent Schools, Dane L.

A new Las Virgenes union grade school was built to replace the old schools; this has since become A.E. Wright Middle School, named after Arthur E. Wright, a childless English immigrant with only an eight-grade education, who nonetheless took an interest in local education, was elected to the Liberty school board, and was instrumental in forming the union school district. ===High school district demise=== All the one-room school districts' territories had been annexed into Los Angeles City High School District on August 18, 1921,\\"L.A. City Schools Creation\\" (). Los Angeles Unified School District. February 7, 1998. Note: Source misspells \\"Los Virgenes\\" as \\"Los Vergenes\\". and until the 1960s, the teenagers of these grade school districts attended Canoga Park High School. However, the creation of Los Angeles Unified School District in 1961 took away the vast majority of the high school district, leaving only the territory of the Las Virgenes and Topanga grade school districts. The high school district renamed itself West County Union High School District, but had no high school left in its territory. Topanga School District voted to join L.A. Unified the next school year, leaving West County with the same border as Las Virgenes Union School District as of July 1, 1962, and California law made coterminous grade school and high school districts automatically become a unified school district, thus creating Las Virgenes Unified School District. ===Unified school district=== Though L.A. Unified was required to provide high school education to Las Virgenes for three years, California law mandated that, if a unified school district did not establish its own high school by September 1965, the district would be annexed to an adjacent district with a high school. In January 1963, LVUSD residents had already voted down construction financing by very narrow margins, and many residents were still advocating a merger into a bigger district. If financing had been voted down again, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors would have had to choose an adjacent district to annex LVUSD territory into: L.A. Unified, Oxnard, Santa Monica, or Simi. However, in the April 16, 1963 election, the voters approved the bond issue and state aid authorization -- the latter by only four votes -- which allowed LVUSD to build Agoura High School and three grade schools. When the district was created, its offices were located on the grounds of the Round Meadow Elementary School in Calabasas. They were then moved in 1974 to 30961 West Agoura Road in Westlake Village, and again in 1990 to a two-story building at 4111 North Las Virgenes Road, next to the A.E. Wright Middle School. LVUSD annexed the community of Bell Canyon in Ventura County, California in 1987. ==OperationsIndependent study=== On June 26, 2006, the Board of Education approved the formation of the district's alternative Independent Study School. The school offers two curricular options: K–12 independent Study where students report to the school site at least once a week to meet with an independent study teacher and K–12 Home Independent Study (Home schooling) which provides a home schooling independent study curriculum. ===School foundation=== Community members formed a school foundation, The Foundation for Las Virgenes Schools, in 2010 in response to the dramatic loss of State funding for public education. The mission of the foundation is to provide general financial support for the public schools in the Las Virgenes Unified School District.thefoundationlvs.org ==References * Official district web site * The Foundation for Las Virgenes Schools Category:School districts in Los Angeles County, California Category:Agoura Hills, California Category:Calabasas, California Category:Westlake Village, California Category:West Hills, Los Angeles Category:School districts established in 1962 Category:1962 establishments in California ","title":"Las Virgenes Unified School District"},{"id":"2212160","text":"Angelica Catalani, 1806 Louise Élisabeth Vigée Le Brun Angelica Catalani (10 May 178012 June 1849) was an Italian opera singer, the daughter of a tradesman. Her greatest gift was her voice, a soprano of nearly three octaves in range. Its unsurpassed power and flexibility made her one of the greatest bravura singers of all time. She also worked as a singing teacher. Her pupils included Laure Cinti-Damoreau and Fanny Corri-Paltoni. ==Biography== Catalani was born on 10 May 1780, at Sinigaglia, where her father was a tradesman. About the age of 12 she was sent to the convent of Santa Lucia at Gubbio, near Rome, where her beautiful voice soon became a great attraction. In its full freshness, according to Fétis and all other authorities, it must have been one of extraordinary purity, force, and compass, going as far as G in altissimo, with a sweet clear tone. This exquisite quality was allied to a marvellous truth and rapidity of execution. No singer has ever surpassed, or perhaps equalled, her in chromatic scales, whether in velocity or precision. On leaving the convent, into which she had been introduced by the Cardinal Onorati, and where the congregation could frequently not be prevented from openly applauding her splendid notes in the services, she found herself, owing to the sudden impoverishment of her parents, compelled to perform in public. Her musical education had been but ill cared for in the convent, where she passed three years; and she had contracted bad tricks of vocalisation, which she never entirely overcame, even after hearing such great models as Luigi Marchesi and Girolamo Crescentini. One of her faults was that she could never execute certain passages without a very perceptible oscillation of the lower jaw, which made them, instead of being even and smooth, sound like a succession of staccato passages on the violin. In spite of this fault, which was indeed more within the criticism of connoisseurs than of the public generally, her voice was so full, powerful, and clear, her intonation so pure and true, and her instinctive execution of difficult and brilliant music so easy and unfaltering, that her singing had a charm which has scarcely ever been equalled, and her very first steps in a theatrical career were marked by the most extraordinary success. When she began, the favourite style was that of expressive and pathetic song, and in this she never produced the effect which she subsequently made in bravura. Thus at Paris she failed comparatively in a tender song of Piccini's, 'Se'l ciel mi divide,' though shortly after, she created the greatest enthusiasm by her 'Son regina,' by an air of Rode's with variations, concerti for the voice, and other pieces of the most florid execution. In 1795, at the age of 16, she obtained her first engagement at La Fenice at Venice, and made her début as Lodoiska in the opera of that name by Mayer. Her face, figure, and voice, assured her success, a success which grew day by day, and lasted for nearly thirty years. In the season of 1798, she sang at Leghorn with Crivelli, Marchesi, and Mrs. Billington; the year after, at La Pergola in Florence, in Nasolini's 'Monima e Mitridate'; and, in 1801, at Milan, in the 'Clitemnestra' of Zingarelli, and Nasolini's 'Baccanali.' In these early efforts her effect was not due to method or skill; it was her superb voice that carried all before her. From Milan she went to Florence, Trieste, Rome, and Naples, exciting everywhere the same astonishment and admiration. Her reputation now reached the ears of the Prince Regent of Portugal, who engaged her, with Elisabetta Gafforini and Crescentini, to sing at the Italian Opera there, and she arrived about the end of the year 1804. Her salary was 24,000 cruzados (£3,000) - the equivalent of £292,458.41 in 2018. Some writers have said that she derived very great advantage from the instruction of Crescentini, which, indeed, seems more than likely; but Fétis, on the authority of Crescentini himself, contradicts this statement categorically, affirming that Crescentini told him that he had endeavoured to give her a little advice, which she had seemed incapable of understanding. During her stay in Portugal, Catalani made the acquaintance of Paul Valabrègue, the French attaché at Lisbon and former French captain, and they married in 1804. Her husband, appears to have had no ideas beyond helping his talented wife to gain the utmost possible amount of money on every occasion, and spending it for her afterwards. From their marriage dates one of the worst of the many speculations that have been based on the capital of a grand voice and great personal charm. They went first to Madrid, and then to Paris, where she sang only in concerts, but where she gained even more fame than before. On October 26, 1805, Mme. Catalani signed her first engagement (in the possession of the writer) with F. Goold and W. Taylor, manager and proprietors of the King's Theatre in the Haymarket, for the season from September 15, 1806, to August 1807, at a salary of £2,000 sterling, with 'a further sum of £100 sterling to defray the expenses of her journey to London,' and also 'one Benefit Night free of expense in the month of March, at which a new opera shall be performed.' Before crossing, however, she gave concerts at Madrid and Paris, by which she gained large sums of money, and created a deep impression; indeed, Napoleon offered her an engagement from which she had some difficulty in escaping, in order to fulfil that at the King's Theatre. At the moment of her arrival in London, Grassini and Mrs. Billington had just retired; and, as Lord Mount-Edgcumbe says, The opinions of all good judges were nearly the same with the above; but the public was led completely away by her marvellous powers. She made her début December 15, 1806, in the 'Semiramide' of Portogallo, composed for her expressly. She appeared also in 'Mitridate,' 'Elfrida,' and most unwillingly in 'La Clemenza di Tito,' for the strict time required in Mozart's music, and the importance of the accompaniments, were not suited to her style. She was, however, the singer who introduced to the English stage his 'Nozze di Figaro,' in which she played Susanna to admiration. In the 'Orazi' she performed the part of the first soprano, Curiazio, that of the first woman being filled by Ferlendis. In 'Didone' she caused the rôle of Enea to be sung by Madame Dussek, who was entirely unfitted for it; and, in another opera, she made Madame Dussek act the first woman's part, choosing for herself that of the primo uomo. Subsequently, she assumed also the place of prima buffa, and succeeded equally well in that line; singing with greater simplicity and ease, she was by some preferred in comic opera. Her face and figure suited both styles; for her handsome countenance was capable of great varieties of expression. Her gains soon became enormous. She was the great attraction of Goold's management, and her engagements entailed on the theatre an expense surpassing anything before experienced. Mr. Waters, in a pamphlet which he published, gives the total amount received by her from the theatre in 1807, including benefits, at £5,000, and her total profits that year, with concerts, provincial tour, etc., at £16,700,—an immense sum to be received in such a period for the services of a single artist. That she sometimes found a difficulty in getting payment is not surprising, especially from such a manager as Taylor. Ebers relates that, on one occasion, she refused to sing unless a debt of £1,000 due to her was paid; and that he gave security for this, of which he had ultimately to pay every farthing. She received as much as 200 guineas for singing 'God save the King' and 'Rule Britannia,' and at a single festival £2,000. Had she practised the least economy she must have amassed a very great fortune; but this she did not do. It is said, for example, that the consumption of beer by her servants during a single year amounted to £103. More serious causes, however, contributed to dissipate these riches as fast as she gained them; for her husband was passionately addicted to gambling, and lost vast sums at play. She remained seven years in England, where she finally succeeded in becoming the only singer of eminence, and led in both lines; but one singer does not constitute an opera, though Valabrègue used to say 'Ma femme et quatre ou cinq poupées,—voilà tout ce qu'il faut.' Neither would her disposition endure the possibility of rivalry, nor the extravagance of her increasing demands allow any manager to engage other singers. She quit the theatre at the end of the season of 1813, having first endeavoured (unsuccessfully) to purchase it, and so become sole proprietor, sole manager, and sole singer. After leaving this stage, she for many years never trod any other, except at Paris, where she obtained the management of the Italian opera, with a subvention of 160,000 francs; but the undertaking was not fortunate. On the return of Napoleon, in 1815, she left Paris, going first to Hamburg, and afterwards to Denmark and Sweden, and exciting everywhere the wildest admiration and enthusiasm. She returned to France, after the Restoration, by the Netherlands and Belgium. On her arrival at Paris, she resumed the direction of the Théâtre Italian, and established the same ruinous system which had destroyed, for a time, opera in London. Every expense of scenery, orchestra, and chorus, was curtailed, and every singer of worth excluded, in order that the entire receipts might go, with the subvention, into the purse of Valabrègue. This was not all. To suit this state of things the operas were arranged in such a manner that little of the original but the name remained. The rest consisted of variations by Rode, and similar things, with the famous 'Son regina,' interpolated in place of the concerted pieces and songs which had been cut out. In May 1816, Catalani left her opera in the hands of managers, and went to Munich to give some concerts and representations. Thence she proceeded to Italy, and only returned to Paris in August 1817. In the next April she left her opera entirely, and resumed her wanderings. Having engaged Mme. Gail to accompany her, as Pucitta had done in London and Paris, she started for Vienna. No sooner had they arrived than she quarrelled with her companion, who returned to Paris. Catalani continued her tour alone, and it lasted nearly ten years. In 1824, she returned to London, performing a certain number of nights with no regular engagement. She reappeared in 'Il Nuovo Fanatico per la Musica,' an opera by Mayer, arranged for her. 'Her powers were undiminished, her taste unimproved.' She next continued her wanderings on the continent. In 1826, an attempt was made by Ebers to engage her, but the terms proposed by her were so exorbitant that it was impossible to consider them seriously. Her voice was, however, no longer what it had been, especially in the highest part of her register. Though still beautiful, flexible, and strong, it was losing gradually a little of these qualities. In turn she visited Germany, Italy, and Paris once more, where she sang without success; then Poland, Russia, and the north of Germany again in 1827. About this time she sang for the last time at Berlin, and resolved to cease singing in public. But she revisited England once more in 1828, and sang at the York Festival. Lord Mount-Edgcumbe heard her the same year at Plymouth, and describes her as having lost, perhaps, a little in voice, but gained more in expression: as electrifying an audience with her 'Rule Britannia;' and as still handsome, though somewhat stout. After a time, she retired to a villa which she had bought in the neighbourhood of Florence. On the stage, she is described as having always produced an unnatural impression, owing to an invincible nervousness, which made her exaggerate the effects she wished to create. She said herself, that it was as painful to her to sing in the theatre as it was delightful to perform at a concert. She never lost her simplicity and purity of manners, nor her piety, modesty, and generosity. Her charitable deeds were innumerable, and the amount of money earned by her in concerts for such purposes alone has been estimated at 2,000,000 francs. At her residence she founded a school of singing for young girls. Catalani died of cholera at Paris, June 12, 1849. Catalani's sister-in-law, Adelina, was also a soprano, though of far less note. She was known variously as la cognate della famosa and la Catalani juniore to distinguish her from her far better-known relative.Liner notes to A Hundred Years of Italian Opera 1810–1820 , Opera Rara ==Publications== * Henry Sutherland Edwards, The Prima Donna: Her History and Surroundings from the Seventeenth to the Nineteenth Century, volume i (two volumes, London, 1888) * George T.

Unlike Oldfield's albums released prior to Earth Moving, the album contains no instrumental tracks. == Album analysis == Oldfield used several vocalists on the album, including his then girlfriend, Anita Hegerland. The album's music was performed mainly with synthesizers. It was the first time Oldfield recorded an album without an instrumental piece; each track being vocal-based pop and rock songs. Oldfield's only other album free of instrumentals to date is 2014's Man on the Rocks. The final track, despite appearing to be a lengthier piece, consists of two short, apparently unconnected songs, combined into one track, with a noticeable pause in between. According to Oldfield, the album was made in full compliance with his recording company, Virgin Records, which demanded he create more commercially oriented material than his previous albums. After recording Earth Moving Oldfield wanted to move away from 'computerised music' and return to real musicians and instruments; this is evident in his next album, Amarok. == Promotion == According to an interview Mike Oldfield and Anita Hegerland gave on the television programme Good Morning Britain, the song \\"Innocent\\" was inspired by their young daughter Greta, who appears in the song's music video. In the programme, Oldfield and Hegerland performed an acoustic version of the song, Hegerland singing and Oldfield playing the guitar. \\"Earth Moving\\", \\"Innocent\\" and \\"(One Glance Is) Holy\\" were released as singles. == Equipment == Earth Moving is the first album on which Oldfield used PRS guitars, having previously used Gibson guitars. Synthesizers on the album include a Fairlight Series III and various instruments made by Roland and Korg (including an M1). The album was recorded using an Atari 1040ST with C-Lab Notator software, a Harrison Series X console, a Studer A8800 tape deck with Dolby SR noise reduction, an Ampex Grand Master tape and ATC SCM200 monitors. == Track listing == All tracks written by Mike Oldfield. === Side one === # \\"Holy\\" – 4:37 # \\"Hostage\\" – 4:09 # \\"Far Country\\" – 4:25 # \\"Innocent\\" – 3:30 # \\"Runaway Son\\" – 4:05 === Side two === # \\"See the Light\\" – 3:59 # \\"Earth Moving\\" – 4:03 # \\"Blue Night\\" – 3:47 # \\"Nothing But\\" / \\"Bridge to Paradise\\" – 8:40 == Personnel == * Mike Oldfield – guitars and keyboards * Max Bacon – vocals (\\"Hostage\\", \\"Bridge to Paradise\\") * Adrian Belew – vocals (\\"Holy\\"), left channel guitar solo (\\"Far Country\\") * Nikki \\"B\\" Bentley – vocals (\\"Earth Moving\\") * Anita Hegerland – vocals (\\"Innocent\\") * Carol Kenyon – vocals (\\"Nothing But\\") * Raphael Ravenscroft – saxophone * Maggie Reilly – vocals (\\"Blue Night\\") * Phil Spalding – bass guitar, backing vocals (\\"Bridge to Paradise\\", \\"See the Light\\", \\"Holy\\") * Chris Thompson – vocals (\\"Runaway Son\\", \\"See the Light\\") * Carl Wayne – backing vocals (\\"Earth Moving\\") * Mark Williamson – vocals (\\"Far Country\\") ==Certifications References  External links == * Mike Oldfield Discography - Earth Moving at Tubular.net * Earth Moving lyrics at Tubular.net Category:Mike Oldfield albums Category:1989 albums Category:Virgin Records albums ","title":"Earth Moving"},{"id":"2212165","text":"The chalkhill blue (Lysandra coridon) is a butterfly in the family Lycaenidae. Aberrant male ==Subspecies== Subspecies include: * Lysandra coridon coridon * Lysandra coridon borussia (Dadd, 1908) – (Urals) * Lysandra coridon asturiensis Sagarra, 1922 – (Spain) ==EvolutionSibling species=== Upon using allozyme analyses when looking at the species L. hispana and L. slovacus showed a difference in evolutionary history with L. coridon. The analysis showed that L. hispana has a large genetic distance between the two species and that there was allopatric speciation from L. coridon. L. slovacus seems to show that there was sympatry with L. coridon but the genetic analysis could not prove this hypothesis, so the researchers made the conclusion that this particular species was a local population that has an atavism of bivoltinism. ===Post-glacial expansion=== The expansion of the species travels from western Europe into eastern Europe from the ice-age refugium into the Balkans. The starting point for the expansion is in western Hungary traveling into the Balkans and then into Brandenburg and Poland. This expansion shows that are two routes due to the changes in gene allele frequencies and the degree of homogeneity of the species. The two routes are: 1.) Starting in the western tip of Hungary traveling into north-eastern Hungry along the Hungarian Mountains into eastern Slovakia 2.) Starts in western Hungary and travels along the eastern Alps into western Slovakia and Czech Republic The expansion caused there to be two unique genetic populations that were separated by mountain ranges. And the expansion also caused the movement of species that were only found in warmer areas to move into new habitats that were previously cooler in temperature and did not have the biotic components to support these new species. ==EcologyDescription=== Lysandra coridon has a wingspan of .Simon Coombes Captain's European Butterfly Guide These small butterflies present a sexual dimorphism. This species' physical appearance can be described as males having pale silvery-blue upperside of the wings with a submarginal line of grey spots on the hindwings and a thin brown and white chequered fringe. Females have dark brown upperside of wings, with marginal orange spots and also with chequered fringes. Chalkhill Blue at Butterfly Conservation The underside of the wings show a light ochre colouration, several dark spots surrounded by white, a submarginal line of black marks, a series of marginal orange spots on the hindwings and a blue dusting near the body. As with many blue butterflies, separation from similar species in the field is on the underside markings. Aberrations are common.Matt Rowlings Euro Butterflies ==Description in Seitz== L. coridon Poda (81 c, d). male above light blue green with a silvery glitter, the black margin of the forewing broad, the hindwing with dark dots at the margin. The underside light violet- grey on the forewing, brownish on the hindwing, variegated with white and bearing yellowish red submarginal spots; both wings very densely ornamented with ocelli. Female above russet grey-brown, beneath earth-brown and like the male with very numerous ocelli. The area of distribution is essentially smaller than in most Blues, being apparently entirely restricted to Central and South Europe. The species occurs from England, Pommerania, and St. Petersburg southwards to Spain, Italy and Brussa, and from the Pyrenees to Orenburg. Although the species is very uniformly developed, quite a number of forms have been provided with names, being partly based on very minute differences. We deal first with the variation of the upperside. — hispana H.-Schiff. (= arragonensis Gerh.) [now full species], from Spain, is paler with the distal margin more strongly spotted. — apennina Z. (81 d) [now full species] is on the whole paler, the dark marginal border of the forewing being lighter in consequence of an intermixture of the ground-colour; from Italy. — The Greek form graeca Ruhl-Heyne is quite similar. — rezniceki Bartel, from Northern Italy, is a transition to the previous; according to the description the upperside of the males is still paler. — albicans H.-Schiff. (81 d) [now full species] is the lightest form, which is almost white above; it flies on limestone in Spain, sometimes as the only form, sometimes in the company of hispana (Ribbe). — caucasica Led. (= ossmar Gerh.) [now full species] (81 e) extends on to the Asiatic continent, flying in Armenia and at the Black Sea. The upperside of the male is brighter blue. — In specimens from the Taurus Mts. even a slight violet sheen is present, especially in the outer area of the wings; this is corydonius H.-Schiff. (= olympica Led.) (81 d).[now full species Lysandra corydonius (Lederer, 1870)] — The blue colour of the male may occasionally appear also in the female, being sometimes restricted to the base — ab. semibrunnea Mill. (= semi-syngrapha Tutt) — sometimes occupying the whole upperside: ab. syngrapha Kef. (= mariscolore Gerh.)(81 d). On the other hand the blue upperside of the male may dulled by a grey suffusion: ab. suffusa Tutt. Other accidental forms are males with red spots at the margin above: ab. suavis Schultz, and females with such spots: ab. aurantia Tutt. In ab. inaequalis Tutt the glossy blue colour forms irregular streaks on a dark ground. In ab. marginata Tutt the black margin is broadened. In ab. fowleri South the margin is white instead of black, while in ab. punctata Tutt the margins are spotted. ab. calydonius Lowe has the ground colour darkened and the black borders enlarged. — Equally variable as the upperside is the under surface. The ground-colour beneath may be very dark (especially in certain females) or remarkably pale; the latter is the case in ab. pallida Tutt. The ocelli may be distorted into rays: ab. striata Tutt. Some of the ocelli may be united: ab. tiphys Esp. They may be increased in number: ab. luxurians Courv., or they may be reduced (ab. privata, unipuncta, impuncta) or all be absent: ab. cinnus Hbn. (= sohni Ruhl) (81 d). Moreover, all these variations may be more or less slightly developed or vestigial (ab. semiaurantia, caeruleomarginataetc.), or various aberrational characters may be combined in one individual, as for instance in ab. parisiensis Gerh., which is an ab. syngrapha with the ocelli as in ab. tiphys, etc. — Egg greenish white, with minute pale reticulation, the meshes being hexagonal. Larva bright blue-green, beneath paler, the dorsal line appearing dark owing to the dorsal vessel, accompanied by chains of yellow spots, a similar but duller row of spots above the abdominal legs. Until June on Hippocrepis, Coronilla, Astragalus, Vicia, etc. Visited by Formica flava, which is attracted by the dorsal gland. Pupa rather slender, smooth, dirty yellowish brown, with dark dorsal line and on the wing-cases pale smears, free on the ground, often under stones. The butterflies occur from June till August, being rare in some places, exceedingly abundant in others; they are everywhere found in particular localities. They have a rapid flight, which is also more sustained than in most other Blues, and go early to sleep, settling for the night with closed wings on stalks of grass or on the top of flowers while it is yet full day- light. This offers the best opportunity for collecting aberrations, since the ocelli of the underside are so clearly visible that onecan pick out without difficulty and put into the cyanide bottle what one requires.

There are a few exceptions to where it is located in Central Europe, it is not found in the countries of Ireland, Scotland, Scandinavia, the Netherlands, the Iberian Peninsula (except in the northern provinces of Iberia), the Mediterranean islands (found in Corsica and Sardinia), and most of southern Italy. Habitat This particular species of butterfly has a preference for dry calcareous grasslands, at an elevation of above sea level. This species also has a preference towards grasslands that have short grass with many flowering plants. L. coridon is a sedentary organism which means that they do not travel very far within their habitat range. These individuals have the tendency to stay within their habitat patch rather than do long migrations to find new habitats. ===Biology=== Note that information on this species applies to Great Britain and some details may not be consistent with the species in other parts of its range. Mating This species only produces one generation per year making them a univoltine, which means that this species only breeds once per year and will only produce one set of offspring. L. coridon is monophagous, which means that they only feeds on one specific species of plant. The larvae or caterpillars of this species feed on the leaves of horseshoe vetch (Hippocrepis comosa) upon which the larvae feed. Egg When they are ready they pupate on the ground within the leaf litter of the host plants. The caterpillars are attend by several different ants of the genera Myrmica, Lasius, Formica, Plagiolepis, Tetramorium, Aphaenogaster and Tapinoma.Paolo Mazzei, Daniel Morel, Raniero Panfili Moths and Butterflies of Europe and North Africa This butterfly is usually seen on the wing from June to October. In the research into the effects of trophic interaction and fragmentation it was found that there are no known parasitoids that are specialized to this species, but there are other parasitoids that are related to other species that are part of the family Lycaenidae which will sometimes predate this species. It could be a viable option that the parasitoids that did predate upon this species became extinct due to the fragmentation of their habitat in the past. ==Factors that affect genetic diversityHabitat fragmentation=== This would be physical features of the environment that separate populations of the same species. One type of would be mountain ranges which separate west and east population of L. coridon, and this separation causes there to be changes in the allele frequency of both population and there can be mixing of these populations only when there is an area that is connected. Another type would be the loss of habitat which can lead to large habitat areas being fragmented, this loss can occur due to human interaction with the ecosystem in way that isolates populations of the species. The loss of habitat changes the number of individuals that the area can support or blocks the population off from a larger population. The limiting number of individuals in the population or the isolation can cause a decrease in the heterogeneity of population and leads to a decrease in fitness. Habitat fragmentation causes conservation efforts to be difficult because it has to be decided what areas get protect or have the best possible chance of helping increase a population without damaging the overall fitness of the population, so great care is taken when selecting what areas will be protected. ==Status and conservationStatus=== According to IUCN Red List for Threatened Species, this particular species is of Least Concern, and this is due to this species not having a significant decline in population in the last ten years, which would be a decline by 25% in the number of adults. ===Conservation=== Since this species is of Least Concern there are few conservation efforts being put forth. But in certain areas that have been having large decline or had large decline implemented conservation efforts. This species is considered by researchers to be an indicator species of calcareous grassland habitat quality and could also be a good model organism to help develop conservation programs for more At Risk species. Conservation in the United Kingdom, Germany, and Poland All three countries have done research into the conservation of the calcareous grassland. Protecting this species would also lead to helping protect higher trophic level individuals that are located in this ecosystem. =United Kingdom= The chalkhill blue experienced a significant decline in population number in the 1950s. There was a rise in population between 1981 and 2000. In this time period there was a significant increase in numbers and this led to the stabilization of the population in the 1990s. The UK Biodiversity Action Plan had monitoring plans in place to see these changes and the data that was collected during that time period showed that the increase in population number came from the use of controlling grazing levels, conservation designation, and agri-environment schemes entry and management. These practices improved the quality of the habitats that were located in the United Kingdom. =Germany and Poland= Both Germany and Poland came up with action plans such as that if conservation efforts where to take place that the ideal area for protection would be large habitats that were interconnected with other Grassland habitats that were fragmented, and had a high abundance of the juvenile host plant located within it or had the ability to support a large number of plants. ==Bibliography== * D.J.

Gunny is similar in texture and construction. Hessian, a dense woven fabric, has historically been produced as a coarse fabric, but more recently it is being used in a refined state known simply as jute as an eco-friendly material for bags, rugs and other products. The name \\"hessian\\" is attributed to the historic use of the fabric as part of the uniform of soldiers from the former Landgraviate of Hesse and its successors, including the current German state of Hesse, who were called \\"Hessians\\". The origin of the word burlap is unknown, though its earliest known appearance is in the late 17th century, and its etymology is speculated to derive from the Middle English borel (\\"coarse cloth\\"), the Old French burel and/or the Dutch boeren (\\"coarse\\"), in the latter case perhaps interfused with boer (\\"peasant\\"). The second element is the English word lap, \\"piece of cloth\\". ==History== Hessian was first exported from India in the early 19th century. It was traditionally used as backing for linoleum, rugs, and carpet. In Jamaica and certain parts of the Caribbean (where it is only known as Crocus),Allsopp, R., ed. (1996). \\"crocus-bag/sack\\". Dictionary of Caribbean English Usage. Oxford: Oxford University Press. . pp. 178–179. many labourers who used to work on the plantations were not often given pleasant materials with which to make clothes. Some had access to cotton which was spun, woven, cut and sewn into serviceable clothing (often called homespun) whilst others had to make do with clothing fashioned from roughly hewn sacking. labourers used their resourcefulness to recycle discarded sacking and fashion them into garments that although fairly uncomfortable by all accounts provided protection from the heat and dust. A traditional costume of Jamaican Maroons uses fabric very similar to this material as a way of drawing an affinity and pay homage to the resourcefulness and creativity of their labourers who gained freedom. For the rest of the population, it was used to make bags for carrying loads of coffee and other items, edible or not. ==Uses== Hessian is often used to make gunny sacks, and to ship goods like coffee beans and rooibos tea. It is breathable and so resists condensation and associated spoilage of contents. It is also durable enough to withstand rough handling in transit; these properties have also led to its use for temporary protection as wet covering to prevent rapid moisture loss in the setting of cement and concrete in the construction industry. Hessian is also commonly used to make effective sandbags; hessian sacks filled with sand are often used for flood mitigation in temporary embankments against floodwaters or field fortifications. ===Shipping=== The transportation of agricultural products often involves bags made from hessian jute fabric. Hessian jute bags (commonly known as gunnysacks) are used to ship wool, tobacco, and cotton, as well as foodstuffs such as coffee, flour, vegetables, and grains. Hessian jute's ability to allow the contents of bags to breathe makes it excellent for preventing or minimizing rotting due to trapped moisture. In some cases, hessian can even be specially treated to avoid specific kinds of rot and decay. Hessian is also often used for the transportation of unprocessed dry tobacco. This material is used for much the same reasons as it would be used for coffee. Hessian sacks in the tobacco industry hold up to 200 kg (440lb) of tobacco, and due to hessian's toughness, a hessian sack can have a useful life of up to three years. ===Landscaping and agriculture=== Hessian is used to wrap the exposed roots of trees and shrubs when transplanting and also for erosion control on steep slopes. One major advantage of hessian jute fabric is that, because it is made entirely from natural vegetable fibers, it is completely biodegradable.Sauer, L. J., The Once and Future Forest: A Guide To Forest Restoration Strategies (Washington, D.C.: Island Press, 1998), p. 302. This property also makes it extremely useful in landscaping and agricultural uses that require incorporating fabric support into outdoor projects. Landscape designs that include tree transplantation often rely on hessian jute to ensure that young trees arrive at the planting venue intact and unharmed. This is achieved by wrapping hessian jute fabric around the roots and soil of a tree shortly after digging it from its original location. The breathability of the fabric allows sufficient aeration of the soil, and the hessian's moisture- resistant properties prevent excess water from accumulating and allowing the growth of mold, mildew, or other types of rot. Once planted, young trees may require the protection of hessian jute to ward off mice and other rodents that might otherwise eat their bark and compromise their structure. To keep rodents at bay, landscapers often wrap swathes of hessian jute around the trunks of young trees of all varieties. In addition to protecting from animals, hessian jute also has the capacity to protect trees from excessive sun and wind. By building windbreaks from hessian jute, landscapers can exert some control over the environment in which young trees grow, thus maximizing their chances of growing to maturity so that they can withstand more intense weather conditions. For planting grass, on areas that have steep slopes or high levels of soil erosion, a layer of hessian jute tacked on over grass seeds can prevent seeds from being moved by rain, runoff, or wind. Landscapers can use this fabric for many uses due to its strength, durability, moisture resistance, and protective properties. ===Apparel=== Due to its coarse texture, it is not commonly used in modern apparel. However, this roughness gave it a use in a religious context for mortification of the flesh, where individuals may wear an abrasive shirt called a cilice or \\"hair shirt\\" and in the wearing of \\"sackcloth\\" on Ash Wednesday. During the Great Depression in the US, when cloth became relatively scarce in the largely agrarian parts of the country, many farming families used burlap cloth to sew their own clothes. However, prolonged exposure to the material can cause rashes on sensitive skin. Owing to its durability, open weave, naturally non-shiny refraction and fuzzy texture, hessian is often used in the fabrication of ghillie suits for 3D camouflage are. It was also a popular material for camouflage scrim on combat helmets during World War II. Until the advent of the plastic \\"leafy\\" multi-color net system following the Vietnam War, burlap scrim was also woven onto shrimp and fish netting to create large-scale military camouflage netting. ===In art=== Hessian has been used by artists as an alternative to cotton or linen as a stretched painting or working surface. In horror fiction, it is commonly used as a mask and as a mask for victims of beheading. ===Emergency flood response=== Hessian bags are often deployed as sandbags as a temporary response to flooding. Because of their material, they can either be reused or can be composted after use. Agencies like the State Emergency Service in Australia and Technisches Hilfswerk in Germany often deploy sandbags, and these are found in the majority of their emergency response vehicles. Plastic bags have been used as a substitute, but SES units have found hessian bags to be more versatile as they can be used in a variety of rescue applications: as an edge protector for rope rescue operations, for use as padding on slings used in animal rescue or used to dampen and beat out bush-fires. ===In beekeeping=== Hessian fabric is often used as smoker fuel in beekeeping because of its generous smoke generation and ease of ignition. ==See also== *Sackcloth ==References== Category:Woven fabrics Category:Packaging materials pl:Juta (tkanina) ","title":"Hessian fabric"},{"id":"2212173","text":"In software testing, a test harness or automated test framework is a collection of software and test data configured to test a program unit by running it under varying conditions and monitoring its behavior and outputs.

A test harness should allow specific tests to run (this helps in optimizing), orchestrate a runtime environment, and provide a capability to analyse results. The typical objectives of a test harness are to: * Automate the testing process. * Execute test suites of test cases. * Generate associated test reports. These individual objectives may be fulfilled by unit test framework tools, stubs or drivers.ISTQB Exam Certification - \\"What is Test harness/ Unit test framework tools in software testing?\\", accessed 19 October 2015 A test harness may provide some of the following benefits: * Increased productivity due to automation of the testing process. * Increased probability that regression testing will occur. * Increased quality of software components and application. * Repeatability of subsequent test runs. * Offline testing (e.g. at times that the office is not staffed, like overnight). * Access to conditions and/or use cases that are otherwise difficult to simulate (load, for example). == Alternative definition == An alternative definition of a test harness is software constructed to facilitate integration testing. Where test stubs are typically components of the application under development and are replaced by working components as the application is developed (top-down integration testing), test harnesses are external to the application being tested and simulate services or functionality not available in a test environment. For example, when attempting to build an application that needs to interface with an application on a mainframe computer, but no mainframe is available during development, a test harness may be built to use as a substitute. A test harness may be part of a project deliverable. It is kept separate from the application source code and may be reused on multiple projects. A test harness simulates application functionality; it has no knowledge of test suites, test cases or test reports. Those things are provided by a testing framework and associated automated testing tools. A part of its job is to set up suitable test fixtures. The test harness will generally be specific to a development environment such as Java. However, interoperability test harnesses have been developed for use in more complex systems.Ricardo Jardim-Gonçalves, Jörg Müller, Kai Mertins, Martin Zelm, editors, Enterprise Interoperability II: New Challenges and Approaches, Springer, 2007, p. 674, accessed 19 October 2015 ==ReferencesFurther reading== * Pekka Abrahamsson, Michele Marchesi, Frank Maurer, Agile Processes in Software Engineering and Extreme Programming, Springer, 1 January 2009 Category:Software testing ","title":"Test harness"},{"id":"2212174","text":"John Godfrey Owen \\"Paddy\\" Roberts (18 January 1910General Register Office deaths index, Newton Abbot district, Jul–Sep 1975, Volume 21 Page 1447 – 24 August 1975) was a British songwriter and singer who lived in Devon, England having previously been a lawyer and a pilot (serving with the RAF in World War II). He then joined BOAC and flew Lockheed Constellations for that airline in the late 1940s/1950s. Roberts, who was born in Durban, South Africa, enjoyed success with a number of songs in the 1950s and 1960s and wrote songs for several films. He released several LPs and EPs of his own material, often featuring what were, for the time, slightly risqué lyrics. One of his most popular and amusing compositions that he recorded himself was entitled \\"The Ballad of Bethnal Green\\", which was also recorded by Beatrice Lillie. Roberts was five times the winner of an Ivor Novello Award, four for songwriting and one for services to the British Music Industry. He co-wrote the 1955 UK chart- topper, \\"Softly, Softly\\", as sung by Ruby Murray, and \\"Lay Down Your Arms\\" by Anne Shelton, which reached No. 1 in the UK Singles Chart in 1956. Roberts died in August 1975 in Dartmouth, Devon, England. ==DiscographySongs=== *\\"L'Anglais Avec Son Sang-froid\\" *\\"Follow Me\\" *\\"Love Isn't What it Used To Be\\" *\\"The Book\\" (David Whitfield) *\\"Lay Down Your Arms\\" (Anne Shelton) (1956) *\\"Meet Me on the Corner\\" (Max Bygraves) *\\"Pickin' a Chicken\\" (Eve Boswell) *\\"Evermore\\" (Ruby Murray) *\\"Softly, Softly\\" (Ruby Murray) (1955) *\\"Johnny Is the Boy for Me\\" *\\"It's a Boy\\" (Lita Roza) *\\"That Dear Old Gentleman\\" *\\"Send For Me\\" *\\"The Three Galleons\\" *\\"Merry Christmas You Suckers\\" (released in the US as \\"And A Happy New Year\\") *\\"The Belle of Barking Creek\\" *\\"The Big Deejay\\" *\\"The Lavender Cowboy\\" *\\"The Ballad of Bethnal Green\\" – Ivor Novello Awards winner (1959) *\\"Tattooed Lady\\" *\\"What's All This Fuss About Love\\" *\\"I Remember Tilly\\" *\\"Our Little Village\\" *\\"Auntie Bridget\\" *\\"I Love Mary\\" *\\"Country Girl\\" ===Soundtrack songs=== *\\"Magic Carpet\\" (from No Time for Tears) *\\"You Are My First Love\\" (from It's Great to Be Young) *\\"I'm in Love for the Very First Time\\" (from An Alligator Named Daisy) – Ivor Novello Award winner (1955) *\\"The Heart of a Man\\" (from The Heart of a Man) (Frankie Vaughan) *\\"Play Rough\\" (from Violent Playground) *Several songs (from The Good Companions) (1957) *\\"Give Me a Man\\" (from To Dorothy a Son) ===Albums=== *Strictly for Grown Ups (1959) – No. 8 UK Decca LF 1322 *Paddy Roberts Tries Again (1960) – No. 16 UK Decca LK 4358/SKL 4104 *Paddy Roberts at the Blue Angel (1961) Decca LK 4410 *Songs for Gay Dogs (1963) Decca LK 4560 *...But Not in Front of the Children (1966) Decca LK 4774 *Funny World (1967) Decca LK4964/SKL 4964 *Doctor Dolittle – With Marty Wilde and others (1967) Marble Arch MAL 738 *The Best of Paddy Roberts (1968) – Re-recordings MFP 1276 *The World of Paddy Roberts (1969) – Compilation Decca PA 37/SPA 37 ===EPs and singles=== Singles: featuring recordings not issued on albums *\\"Love Is A Wonderful Thing\\" / \\"Send For Me\\" Decca F11446 *\\"Merry Christmas You Suckers\\" / \\"Got An Idea\\" Decca F11552 EPs *Strictly for Grown Ups Decca DFE 6584 *Paddy Roberts Strikes Again (with The Dennis Wilson Octet) Decca DFE 6641 *Paddy Decca DFE 6701 Notes: * A Featuring recordings not issued on albums. ===Discography notes=== Many of Roberts' recordings were made available in the United States. \\"Merry Christmas You Suckers\\" was issued with an alternative title of \\"And A Happy New Year\\". Although most the albums were only issued in mono, it appears that the studio albums at least were recorded in stereo. The tracks from Strictly For Grown Ups that are included on The World of Paddy Roberts\\" are in stereo, leading to the assumption that the whole album was recorded that way (but never issued that way). Songs for Gay Dogs was issued in stereo for the first time in 2006 when released on CD which indicated that ...But Not in front of the Children was also recorded that way. The musical director on most recordings was Dennis Wilson. The exceptions being Songs For Gay Dogs (Peter Knight), Funny World (Ronnie Aldrich), Live at the Blue Angel (Barry Morgan) and Doctor Dolittle (Cyril Stapleton). The director for \\"Love Is A Wonderful Thing\\" / \\"Send For Me\\" was Johnny Pearson. There is no director listed for his MFP album. All Decca Material with the exception of ...But Not in front of the Children and Funny World was produced by Hugh Mendl. ===CD releases=== *Strictly For Grown Ups/Paddy Roberts Tries Again *Must Close Saturday Records MCSR 3022 *Songs For Gay Dogs/Funny World *Must Close Saturday Records MCSR 3034' Strictly For Grown Ups has also been released without Paddy Roberts Tries Again, but with various other Roberts compositions sung by others on MCSR 3046. ==See also== *List of artists under the Decca Records label ==References * Paddy Roberts discography at Discogs * Paddy Roberts biography and discography at Sterlingtimes * Ivor Novello Awards winners list at Bucksmusicgroup Category:1910 births Category:1975 deaths Category:South African songwriters Category:South African male singers Category:Ivor Novello Award winners Category:20th-century South African singers Category:White South African people ","title":"Paddy Roberts (songwriter)"},{"id":"2212178","text":"Leonardo Manco (born December 16, 1971) is an Argentine comic book artist. ==Career== Manco is best known for his dark and gritty style on such titles as Hellstorm (1994), Blaze of Glory (2000, #1-4), Apache Skies (2002, #1-4), Deathlok Vol. 3 (1999–2000) and Hellblazer (2004).

Set in an abandoned London warehouse, the partly imagined story of a group of club 'names' set in the location of what was the city's most fashionable nightclub, the now-legendary Taboo (1985–87) of the title, which was the creation of Leigh Bowery. Boy George is featured as one of the club's regulars, but in reality, George rarely attended. The show also focuses on George's life prior to and after achieving fame. ==Productions== The show premiered in London's West End at the newly opened Venue Theatre on January 29, 2002. Comedian/talk show host Rosie O'Donnell was so enamoured with it that she decided to finance a Broadway production. After 16 previews, it opened on November 13, 2003, at the Plymouth Theatre where, hampered by mostly scathing reviews, it closed after 100 performances. The cast, directed by Christopher Renshaw, included Boy George (credited under his real name, George O'Dowd), Euan Morton, Luke Evans, Dianne Pilkington, Raúl Esparza, Sarah Uriarte Berry, Jeffrey Carlson, and Brooke Elliott. O'Donnell reportedly lost her entire $10 million investment in the project. O'Donnell said in a 2007 interview about Leigh Bowery that she will take Taboo back to Broadway in the future. ==Plot== The show is based partly on the New Romantic scene of the 1980s. At its core is the life and career of colourful pop star Boy George (who rose to global prominence in the early 1980s with his band Culture Club) and his contemporaries, including performance artist and club promoter Leigh Bowery, pop singer Marilyn, Blitz nightclub host Steve Strange (later of the electro- pop group Visage), and Philip Sallon, punk groupie and Mud Club promoter. Although George was intimate with the central figures, artistic license around relationships and time frames was taken for continuity; for example, Bowery never attended the Blitz nightclub, as he was living in Australia at the time. ===2002 West End production=== Act 1 The show begins with Philip Salon introducing us to all the New Romantics in London's Soho district (\\"Freak/Ode To Attention Seekers\\"). Next we enter the James family home where Billy lives with his mom, Josie, and dad, Derek who is unemployed thanks to the Thatcher era. Billy's dad starts ranting about Billy been a waste of space and starts to mock him because he wants to be a photographer. Billy finally snaps and decides it's time to leave home and move to London and discover himself. He packs his bag and says goodbye to his long suffering mom and leaves (\\"Safe In the City\\"). Billy is in London. Whilst walking around the streets he runs into a cross-dressing drug dealer named Petal, but Phillip drags Billy away from him. Philip tells Billy he knows of a place where he can stay, a squat with a few other people living there. On arriving at the squat Billy is met by the fiery Kim, a punk looking girl who wants to be a fashion designer. She says he can't live there as it's full, but George, her roommate, decides Billy can stay with them. George is wearing heavy makeup and what can only be described as a white toga; Billy is fascinated by him. George explains to Billy that his father is a builder so he was never happy with how George turned out, but his mother is a different story. Billy goes to the kitchen with Kim whilst George reflects on his mother's unconditional love towards him (\\"Stranger In This World\\"). When Billy reenters the room George kisses Billy taking him by surprise and Billy runs off. At the local night club we meet Steve Strange who is acting as bouncer. Kim, Billy, Philip, and George arrive at the club for a big night out. Billy is fascinated by the club's patrons and begins to take pictures of everyone. Steve Strange premieres his new hit record \\"Fade To Grey\\", but the rest of the revelers are sick of hearing the song so they pull the plug halfway through his performance. Petal turns up dealing drugs but the bouncer kicks him out after a disturbance. The audience is then introduced to another popular face on the New Romantic scene, Marilyn, a man who dresses like Marilyn Monroe (\\"Genocide Peroxide\\"). We then meet Jane who works for the magazine ID, she asks George for a quote about the New Romantic scene and he gives one. During the night we go into the men's bathroom at the club to find Leigh Bowery, an outrageous fashion designer and performance artist who traveled from his home land, Australia, to be a part of the New Romantic scene. He explains to the audience that he can't get enough of boys with pretty faces. Billy enters the bathroom and is amazed by Leigh's outlandish look (\\"I'll Have You All\\"). Leigh is instantly attracted to the good looking photographer and gives him his number. Time has swiftly moved on and Kim and Billy are closer than ever. Billy is taking pictures of Kim modeling her latest creations. The two are falling for each other (\\"Love Is a Question Mark\\"). Just when they are about to take their actions further, George comes home and makes a scene by flirting with Billy and insisting he should be with him. George and Kim start to argue with each other. Billy is sick of it and runs off. Out on the street late at night, cross-dressing drug dealer Petal is selling drugs (\\"Shelter\\"). Billy walks the streets after running out on Kim and George bumps into Petal. He expresses his disgust at Petal's dealing and almost winds up getting attacked by Petal but luckily Billy manages to get away. Billy's mom is on the phone with Kim and the two talk about their love for Billy. Josie just wants to know that her son is ok. Kim reassures her that he's fine. On her own Kim starts to question whether Billy will still like her even if she removes all her makeup and opens up to him, a prospect terrifying to her (\\"Pretty Lies\\"). When Billy sees Kim without the make up he is shocked out how beautiful she looks. Kim apologizes for her and George arguing and explains it's just how they are and that they love each really. Kim explains to Billy that she is a virgin, and before you know it the two are in the bedroom and couldn't be happier. George, annoyed that Billy wants to be with Kim instead of him, joins Marilyn and heads down to Selfridges, a department store, to do some shopping. George tells Marilyn that he's met a drummer who wants him to sing in his band, Marilyn is excited for him, if not a little jealous. After a quick run in with the sales girl who is disgusted at the appearance of both men the two discuss their fantasies of being famous (Guttersnipe). Josie is at home missing Billy and wondering where her life went so wrong, she doesn't love her abusive husband anymore, the only night out she gets is down the local pub, and her life is just going in no direction (Talk Amongst Yourselves). Josie then calls Billy, but he's out and Phillip answers the phone instead. He invites Josie down to London to come and see Billy at Philips club and Josie wholeheartedly decides to go and visit her son. Its time for George to record his demo with his new group Culture Club and the session goes well, apart from the producer stopping one song after realizing that George was singing about another man. So he records a different song to keep the producer happy (Do You Really Want To Hurt Me). Culture Club start to rise to fame and their single hits number 1. Billy sees George at the club and tries to talk to him but after George felt Billy picked Kim over him George isn't so forthcoming. Eventually George lets Billy take his picture and Billy flirts outrageously, but it appears he is just using George. George runs into Jane who used to work for ID magazine now works for the Sun, Jane never used to give him any attention in ID magazine but now he's a star she's begging him for an interview. Jane storms out and as she does Billy bumps into her and tells her he's got some pictures of George and asks if the paper would buy them. Jane isn't interested but, she hands Billy her card if he ever has any juicy stories about George and leaves. Billy tries to talk to George again and asks if he could put a word in for him at his record company to be a photographer. George annoyed that Billy has barely asked him how he is, leaves annoyed. Billy not knowing what to do calls Leigh Bowery who told him to call if he was ever at a loose end. Leigh tells him to come round and that he will make Billy's dreams a reality. Leigh is entering his latest creation in to a talent contest called the Miss Mud Day Queen Ball and wants Billy to model for him. Leigh tells Billy that he can get him in front of the camera instead of behind it, he just has to do everything Leigh tells him to. When Billy gets to Leigh's house, Leigh and his slaves begin to give Billy a makeover to turn him in to a star of the New Romantic scene (Touched By The Hand Of Cool). Leigh tells Billy he will make him the talk of the town and proceeds to call everyone telling them that Billy is now one of his models and will be in the show. Rumors also start to fly that Billy is sleeping with Leigh, which get back to Kim leaving her heartbroken (Church Of The Poisoned Mind). It's the day of the Miss Mud Day Queen Ball and Leigh's collection wins the contest, modeling it is Billy now nicknamed Spartacus. Leigh also announces he is opening a club called Taboo. In walks Kim and Billy's mother, shocked at what they see and Leigh makes Kim believe that the two have been sleeping with each other. Kim is outraged and his mother is disappointed in him and the two leave Billy alone (Stranger In This World Reprise). Act 2 Taboo is now open and everyone who is anyone is there (Everything Taboo). Kim and Josie, who has decided to leave Billy's dad and stay with Kim in London, go to the club to see what all the fuss is about. Whilst at the club Josie and Kim decide to team up and create a fashion line of their own and rent a flat from Philip who is with them. Billy is now hanging out with Boy George and Kim sees them together and presumes that they are sleeping together. Billy tries to apologise to Kim about the Leigh Bowery incident but Kim doesn't want to hear it, she claims that he is just using people who can help his career. Billy tells Leigh he doesn't want to work as his model anymore as he's unhappy and wants Kim back and Leigh calls him ungrateful. Josie tells Billy she is ashamed of him and annoyed at what he's done to Kim. George now deeply affected by fame has begun to take drugs specifically with Petal and Marilyn at the club. George gives Billy drugs and Billy asks George if he can work at Virgin Records and be the official Boy George photographer. George agrees and tells Billy to go to Virgin and tell them that he's working for George now and Billy is thrilled. Josie and Kim are at home and their business is starting to take off. Josie is like a new woman full of ambition, shes found a true friend in Kim and in Philip. Then there's a knock at the door and it's Josie's husband, Derek. He wants her to come home but Josie stands up to him. He takes an instant dislike to Philip and Kim and verbally abuses them causing Josie to kick him out. Josie is shocked she has just stood up to him after all these years (Independent Woman). Back in George's Apartment he and Marilyn are having a drug binge and George's habit has gotten completely out of control. Billy enters annoyed at George after going to Virgin Records expecting a job but realizing George had not set it up. He tells George enough is enough and that he's killing himself with the drugs (I See Through You). Billy storms out with Marilyn leaving George alone. Walking home from the shop Philip sees Josie's husband at the bus stop. Philip tells Derek that Josie did the right thing ending it with him. Derek beats Philip up in the street and spits on him, leaving Philip bruised and bloodied (Petrified). Leigh's live in helper Sue, opens a giant curtain to reveal that Leigh has installed himself behind a sheet of glass as a work of art at an art gallery. He explains to the audience that he is art (Ich Bin Kunst). After his performance art Sue tells Leigh that he needs to go to the hospital for a check up, but Leigh won't go, he's obviously scared about his HIV positive status. Billy has been away to New York to photograph Marilyn's first concert to launch his debut single. When he arrives in London he goes to see his Mom, Kim, and Philip. Kim still refuses to talk to Billy. Billy tells her that he can't stop thinking of her and apologizes for sleeping with George. Kim starts to come around but unfortunately her efforts are wasted as George turns up at the house and has a go at Billy for leaving him and going to New York with Marilyn. George collapses in a heap on the floor. Josie and Kim are shocked at Billy for knowing that George was abusing drugs and not trying to help him. Billy meets up with Jane and gives her pictures of George using drugs and the full story about his addiction. He takes no money, he does it thinking that it will push George to get help. The story breaks and the media is outrage at George. George is arrested for possession of drugs and the seriousness of his addiction hits him. George, Steve Strange, Marilyn and Billy all ponder how they have his rock bottom. George reflects how quick his life is falling apart, Marilyn thinks about his failed career, Steve realizes he's a has been, and Billy is riddled with guilt over what he has done to George (Out Of Fashion). At the hospital Leigh lays dying of AIDS, his trusted friend Sue is the only with him when he dies (I'l Adore) Back on the street of London Petal is still dealing drugs, annoyed Billy tries to stop him selling to a young boy and ends up in fight with Petal. The dealer pulls a knife on Billy but just in the nick of time George turns up to rescue him. The two talk about everything what has happened and the mistakes they have made. Billy apologizes for informing the media about Georges addiction, but George tells him that Billy revealing the story saved his life (Pie In The Sky). Billy tells George how he's going to India to take some time to study with the Hare Krishners and that George should join with him if he'd like. So George, Billy, Philip, Kim, and Josie all go travel to India. After a few weeks the group decides to go home after finding the answers they were looking for, but Billy decides he's going to stay for a while and take some time to think (Bow Down Mister). ==Characters, Original London production and UK tour== * Billy – the protagonist, Billy is an aspiring photographer.

He played college football for the University of Miami, won the Heisman Trophy in 1992, and was a member of the Miami Hurricanes' national championship teams of 1989 and 1991. A seventh-round pick in the 1993 NFL Draft, he was a member of several NFL teams, but never became a regular starter as a pro. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 2010. ==Early years== Torretta was born in Pinole, California. He graduated from Pinole Valley High School, where he was a standout high school football quarterback for the Pinole Spartans. ==College career== Torretta accepted an athletic scholarship to attend the University of Miami, where he played for the Miami Hurricanes football team from 1989 to 1992. ===1989 and 1990 seasons=== As a quarterback for the Hurricanes, Torretta spent his first two seasons mostly on the bench behind then starting quarterback Craig Erickson, with his only significant playing time coming with three starts in 1989 after Erickson injured his throwing hand. During that span, however, the then-unknown Torretta lit up San Diego State for 485 yards, setting a school record for most passing yards in a game that was only broken on September 29, 2012 by Stephen Morris. ===1991 season=== In his first year as a starter, Torretta garnered further attention by stealing the show in a nationally televised 1991 game versus the Houston Cougars and their Heisman-frontrunning quarterback, David Klingler. As Miami's defense cut down Houston's run-and- shoot offense, Torretta put on the performance that many expected out of Klingler en route to a 40–10 victory; Klingler's lone touchdown pass in the game came with three seconds left in the fourth quarter against Miami's third- string defense, long after the game was decided. Torretta went on to lead Miami to a fourth-quarter comeback win on the road versus #1 Florida State and ultimately to an undefeated season and a co-national championship. ===1992 season=== Torretta passed for more than 3,000 yards his senior year in 1992 on his way to winning the Heisman Trophy and the Davey O'Brien Award that season. He also won the Walter Camp Award, the Maxwell Award, the Johnny Unitas Trophy and the Chic Harley Award. One of the key games of the season came against West Virginia when he threw for 363 yards and two touchdowns in the 35–23 victory. His career as quarterback at Miami was hugely successful, with Torretta leading the team to 26 wins and only one loss. That one loss came in the 1993 Sugar Bowl, in which Torretta's Hurricanes were dominated by the Alabama Crimson Tide's defense. Torretta was flummoxed by Alabama's 11-man fronts, and threw three interceptions after only throwing four all season. Alabama won the game, 34–13, and the national championship. ===Statistics=== {  - ! Year ! Comp. ! Att. ! Comp % ! Passing ! TD ! INT -  1991  205  371  55.3  3,095  20  8 -  1992  228  402  56.7  3,060  19  7 } ==NFL career1993–1994=== Despite his collegiate-level success, Torretta was not a top NFL draft pick, and his NFL career was fairly unremarkable. He was not selected until the Minnesota Vikings took him in the seventh round in the 1993 NFL draft and then did not play him at all that year. In 1994, Torretta was on the Vikings' roster, and then was picked up by the Detroit Lions. As was the case in 1993, he failed to play at all in 1994, serving the entire season in a backup role with the Lions. ===1995–1997=== In 1995, Torretta moved to NFL Europe and was also on the roster for the San Francisco 49ers and Detroit Lions but was again relegated to backup roles. He was cut by the 49ers in 1996 and subsequently picked up by the Seattle Seahawks. His only chance to play in an NFL game came in the 1996 season finale when he came off the bench for the Seahawks against the Oakland Raiders. He immediately threw a 32-yard touchdown pass to Joey Galloway that put Seattle ahead, leading the team to victory. In 1997, Torretta was on the roster for Seattle and later the Indianapolis Colts but again did not play. After the 1997 season, he retired from the NFL. ==Post-NFL career== Torretta followed his NFL career with a position at Wachovia Securities as a Senior Financial Advisor. He is Chairman/CEO of Touchdown Radio, broadcasting an NCAA game of the week on national radio. He is also an NCAA football expert on Sirius/XM channel 91—College Sports Nation. Torretta is Vice President for GAMCO Asset Management, working with Institutional clients nationwide and working out of the firm's Palm Beach office. ==ReferencesCategory:1970 births Category:Living people Category:All-American college football players Category:American football quarterbacks Category:American people of Italian descent Category:College football announcers Category:College Football Hall of Fame inductees Category:Detroit Lions players Category:Heisman Trophy winners Category:Indianapolis Colts players Category:Miami Hurricanes football players Category:Minnesota Vikings players Category:People from Pinole, California Category:Players of American football from California Category:Rhein Fire players Category:Seattle Seahawks players Category:San Francisco 49ers players ","title":"Gino Torretta"},{"id":"2212189","text":"John D.

The Snake River in Wyoming The land was originally part of Teton National Forest and was transferred to the National Park Service from the United States Forest Service to assure an unbroken connection between Grand Teton and Yellowstone National Parks. The parkway road itself extends from the northern end of Grand Teton National Park, through the parkway lands, and then on to West Thumb Geyser Basin in Yellowstone National Park, a distance of 27 miles (43 km). The 24,000-acre park is managed by Grand Teton National Park. The parkway is a transitional zone in terms of geology with ancient lava beds being found in the north and the granitic rocks of the Teton Range in the south. The Snake River flows through the parkway as it heads south to Jackson Lake and is considered a prime trout fly fishing area. In Grand Teton and Yellowstone, grizzly bears, black bears, moose, elk, bighorn sheep and mule deer can be found there. The Yellowstone fires of 1988 affected the northern sections of the parkway consuming ). As of 2005, the forest had begun to be rejuvenated and wildlife habitat had actually increased due to better mix of meadow and forest lands. A major relocation project for the Flagg Ranch concession operation (consisting of a lodge, gas station, camp store, cabins and a campground) from along the Snake River to a point higher up and less visible from the road was completed in 2002. Rafting is a popular activity during the summer and guided snowmobile tours use the parkway as a starting point for trips into Yellowstone during the winter. ==See also== Entrance sign * Rockefeller family ==External links== * * Category:Roads in Wyoming Category:United States federal parkways Category:National Park Service areas in Wyoming Category:Transportation in Teton County, Wyoming Category:Bridger–Teton National Forest Category:Caribou-Targhee National Forest Category:Federal lands in Wyoming Category:Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem Category:Rockefeller family Category:Protected areas of Teton County, Wyoming Category:Protected areas established in 1972 Category:1972 establishments in Wyoming ","title":"John D.

He was involved in the founding of the long-running comic 2000 AD in 1977, and was its second editor (1977–1978). He also edited Starlord (1978) and Tornado (1979). ==Biography== Gosnell was working as a sub-editor in IPC's competition department when Pat Mills asked if he would be interested in working on Action where he wrote Dredger and The Suicide Club.Thrill Power Overload page 9 It was during this period that he read an article in the Evening Standard on the forthcoming sci- fi films in the late seventies and concluded that a science-fiction comic would complement the other genres the company was publishing. He suggested it to managing editor Jack Le Grand who turned it down, but mentioned it to Mills who suggested Gosnell write his ideas down in a memo,dated 18 December 1975 which Mills then passed on to John Sanders, head of the Youth Group in IPC.Thrill Power Overload page 9-10 Sanders recalls Gosnell from those years: > \\"Gosnell wrote lots of memos and Le Grand stuffed lots of them. I liked > talking to Gosnell. He was a better ideas man than he was an editor, and > there is always a place for someone like him. Gosnell was enormously noisy, > enormously enthusiastic. He was a great guy to have around because he was > always bubbling. Good ideas men often create dissent. You have to give them > space to do that.\\"Thrill Power Overload page 10 Sanders liked the ideas and passed it over to Mills to develop into a dummy issue to show to the IPC Board. After it was approved Mills brought Gosnell onto the staff in an official capacity as he recalls \\"I felt I owed Kelvin something for suggesting the idea in the first place, for which he hadn't been paid. I asked for him to be appointed editor designate. His input was valuable on strips like M.A.C.H. 1 and Dan Dare, because of his technical and science fiction knowledge.\\"Thrill Power Overload page 17 Kevin O'Neill, who was the art assistant in the early days, recalls the discussion between Mills and Gosnell \\"They had these ranting conversations, lots of swearing and cursing... Pat and Kelvin had a poisonous, venomous hatred of cosy editorial chats seen in the like of Valiant, that sort of kindly 'Uncle Editor' stuff. They wanted to do the opposite of that, an irreverent sort of editorial figure.\\"Thrill Power Overload page 28 Gosnell suggested either \\"an imperious intelligent alien or a computer\\" and it was the former that met with the most approval. They then bought a latex Neanderthal mask, added a pony tail, a brooch (for the Rosette of Sirius) and Gosnell put it on with a grey jumpsuit with silver stripes to complete the outfit. Tharg's alien slang also largely came from Gosnell based on \\"invented swearwords from his schooldays.\\" Mills resigned after the first 16 issues, partly because of the interference from senior management, and handed the reins to Gosnell. Nick Landau moved over from Action to become Gosnell's chief sub-editor.Thrill Power Overload page 36 Gosnell relied more on Landau when he had to oversee the launch of Starlord,\\"A brief history of Starlord\\" from \\"Watch the stars!\\" website and the eventual merger of the title into 2000 AD, which saw Landau swap places with Battle sub-editor Steve MacManus.Thrill Power Overload page 51 Gosnell eventually resigned from his editorship over friction with managing editor Bob Bartholomew, during the time of the launch of Tornado (1979), with MacManus being promoted to editor.Thrill Power Overload page 57 Gosnell would continue to work on Tornado as both editor and freelance writer during its short run. On the writing front Gosnell is best known for his three adaptations of Harry Harrison's The Stainless Steel Rat, illustrated by Carlos Ezquerra and serialized in 1979, 1980 and 1984 in 2000 AD. He also co-wrote the 1977 series of Dan Dare for that weekly comic. Gosnell also worked for the Dutch comic strip weekly Eppo for a number of years, writing Storm, with art by Don Lawrence, and Rud Hart, art by Belgian artist Gilbert DeClerq. A two-page Wonder Woman text story in London Editions Magazines' Super-Heroes Annual for 1983 is also credited to him. ==Bibliography== Comics work includes: *Dan Dare (in 2000 AD #1–23, 1977) *Judge Dredd: ** \\"Whitey\\" (with co-writers Peter Harris and Pat Mills, art by Mike McMahon, in 2000 AD #2, 1977) ** \\"The Aggro Dome\\" (with co-writer Alan Grant, art by Mike McMahon, in 2000 AD #183, 1980) ** \\"Mega-way Madness\\" (with co-writer Alan Grant, art by Ron Smith, in 2000 AD #189, 1980) *Tharg's Future Shocks: ** \\"Play Pool!\\" (with Kevin O'Neill, in 2000 AD #36, 1977) ** \\"Trial and Error\\" (with Mike Dorey, in 2000 AD #204, 1981) ** \\"The Sound of Silence\\" (with Mike White, in 2000 AD #207, 1981) ** \\"The Collector\\" (with Ian Kennedy, in 2000 AD #210, 1981) ** \\"Long Live the Queen\\" (with Eric Bradbury, in 2000 AD #212, 1981) ** \\"Bloomin' Cold\\" (with Garry Leach, in 2000 AD #215, 1981) ** \\"'Ang About\\" (with Eric Bradbury, in 2000 AD #221, 1981) ** \\"Diversion\\" (with Colin Wilson, in 2000 AD #222, 1981) ** \\"The Machine\\" (with Jesus Redondo, in 2000 AD #224, 1981) ** \\"Seeing Is Believing\\" (with Colin Wilson, in 2000 AD #225, 1981) ** \\"Giant Leap\\" (with Jesus Redondo, in 2000 AD #230, 1981) ** \\"Space to Let\\" (with Anthony Jozwiak, in 2000 AD #236, 1981) ** \\"Love Thy Neighbour\\" (with Jesus Redondo, in 2000 AD #242, 1981) ** \\"Horn of Plenty!\\" (with John Higgins, in 2000 AD #248, 1982) *Flesh: \\"Book II\\" (in 2000 AD #86–99, 1978–79) *Project Overkill (with Ian Gibson and Jesus Redondo, in 2000 AD #119–126, 1979)Project Overkill at 2000 AD online *Blackhawk (with co- writer Alan Grant and art by Massimo Belardinelli, in 2000 AD #127, 1979)2000ad.org *The Stainless Steel Rat (with Carlos Ezquerra, tpb, 208 pages, July 2010, ):The Stainless Steel Rat at 2000 AD online **The Stainless Steel Rat (in 2000 AD #140–151, 1979–1980) **The Stainless Steel Rat Saves the World (in 2000 AD #166–177, 1980) **The Stainless Steel Rat for President (in 2000 AD #393–404, 1984–1985) *Ro-Jaws' Robo-Tale: \\"Damian, Child of Tomorrow\\" (with co-writer Prigmore and art by Mike White, in 2000 AD #147, 1980)Ro-Jaws at 2000 AD online *Storm (with Don Lawrence, Eppo #27–52, 1980–1981, collected in Storm Volume 4, March 2005, ): ** \\"The Legend of Yggdrasil/De Legende van Yggdrasi\\" ** \\"City of the Damned/Stad der Verdoemden\\" *Joe Black (with John Higgins):Joe Black at 2000 AD online ** \\"Joe Black's Tall Tale!\\" (in 2000 AD #241, 1981) ** \\"The Hume Factor\\" (in 2000 AD #252, 1982) ** \\"Joe Black's Big Bunco\\" (in 2000 AD #256, 1982) *The Terminal Man (with Oliver Frey, in CRASH, 12 4-page episodes, 1984). ==NotesReferences== *Thrill Power Overload (by David Bishop, Rebellion Developments, 260 pages, February 2007, ) * * *Kelvin Gosnell at 2000ad.org Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:British comics writers Category:Comic book editors ","title":"Kelvin Gosnell"},{"id":"2212195","text":"Beta Draconis (β Draconis, abbreviated Beta Dra, β Dra) is a binary star and the third-brightest star in the northern circumpolar constellation of Draco. With an apparent visual magnitude of 2.79, it is bright enough to be easily seen with the naked eye. Based upon parallax measurements from the Hipparcos astrometry satellite, it lies at a distance of about from the Sun. The two components are designated Beta Draconis A (officially named Rastaban , the traditional name of the system) and B. The star was confirmed as a variable star with a range of about 1/100th of a magnitude by Gabriel Cristian Neagu using data from the TESS and Hipparcos missions.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_Draconis#cite_note-9 The variability was reported to the AAVSO (American Association of Variable Star Observers), in the Variable Star Index.https://www.aavso.org/vsx/index.php ==Nomenclature== β Draconis (Latinised to Beta Draconis) is the system's Bayer designation. The designations of the two components as Beta Draconis A and B derive from the convention used by the Washington Multiplicity Catalog (WMC) for multiple star systems, and adopted by the International Astronomical Union (IAU). It bore the traditional name Rastaban, which has also been used for Gamma Draconis.Rastaban , Stars, Jim Kaler. Accessed on line September 17, 2008. This name, less commonly written Rastaben, derives from the Arabic phrase ra's ath-thu'ban \\"head of the serpent/dragon\\". It was also known as Asuia and Alwaid , the latter from the Arabic al-ʽawāʼidh \\"the old mother camels\\". In 2016, the IAU organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalogue and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN approved the name Rastaban for the component Beta Draconis A on 21 August 2016 and it is now so included in the List of IAU-approved Star Names. Beta Draconis is part of the asterism of the Mother Camels (Arabic al'awa'id), along with Gamma Draconis (Eltanin), Mu Draconis (Erakis), Nu Draconis (Kuma) and Xi Draconis (Grumium), which was later known as the Quinque Dromedarii.

Compared to the Sun, Beta Draconis A is an enormous star with six times the mass and roughly 40 times the radius. At this size, it is emitting about 950 times the luminosity of the Sun from its outer envelope at an effective temperature of 5,160 K, giving it the yellow hue of a G-type star. The spectrum matches a stellar classification of G2 II, with the luminosity class of II indicating it is a bright giant. It is about 67 million years old. ==References *Dibon-Smith, Richard (1992).

The ocelli of the underside may either be so enlarged that some become confluent (confluens Aign., striata Tutt), or they may become obsolete: ab. krodeli Gillm. (= cinnides Stgr., adonis Hbn. pt.) (81 c). The specimens in which only the usually present basal ocelli of the forewing are absent are ab. sapphirus Meig. — Egg semiglobular, with the top some-what impressed, pale green, reticulated with white. Larva bright leaf-green, with dark dorsal stripe accompanied by small orange yellow spots, which form two subdorsal lines; similar yellow stripes on the sides; head black. Until April and again in the summer on Hippocrepis and Coronilla. Pupa green or brown, with a dark stripe on the Idaek, on or close to the ground. The butterflies are on the wing in May and June and again in August, in the South a third time in September and October. They love open places, fallow ground, young plantations and sunny slopes; they rest in day-time with open wings and sleep on Umbels, Thistles, and Scabious, also on stalks of grass, keeping the wings tightly closed. When disturbed they fall with a jump into the grass. They are common at their flight-places in most districts and occur in mountains up to 7000 ft.

A. von Rottemburg described the Adonis blue in 1775 as Papilio bellargus, noting it was very rare locally but came to his garden in June. ==Habitat== The preferred habitat of the Adonis blue is calcareous grasslands with hot and dry conditions. This is because the larva feeds on horseshoe vetch (Hippocrepis comosa) which is largely restricted to these habitats. This plant flourishes on sheep-grazed pastures and disappears after a few years when cattle graze. Sometimes human-created landforms provide refuges for the plant and the butterfly; an example of this is on Martin Down in Dorset, where horseshoe vetch only occurs on ancient earthworks with thin calcareous soils. ==Species decline (Great Britain)== The Adonis blue is at the most northerly edge of its range in Britain and has always been restricted to the warmer dry calcareous grasslands of southern England. It has been declining over the last fifty years because its habitat has been disappearing through changing agricultural practices; over the whole of Britain there has been a decline of over 90% in numbers since 1950. It has been lost from Cambridgeshire, Essex, Suffolk, and the Chilterns; its strongholds are Dorset, Wiltshire, Sussex and the Isle of Wight. There are efforts from conservation organisations and local Biodiversity Action Plans to encourage the populations of chalk-grassland butterflies through managed grazing programs. The recent hot and dry weather associated with climate change seems to be beneficial for this species by making more habitats suitable. In 2006 it had returned to a site in the Cotswolds in Gloucestershire, where it had vanished 40 years previously. ==Other== *Winter is passed as a small caterpillar *Habitat: Flowery hillsides on chalk and limestone *Food plant: Horseshoe vetch *Flight: May–September, in two broods ==See also== *List of butterflies of Great Britain ==References * Adonis blue at Butterfly- Conservation.org Category:Lysandra (butterfly) Category:Butterflies described in 1775 Category:Butterflies of Europe Category:Butterflies of Asia ","title":"Adonis blue"},{"id":"2212201","text":"Sir Victor Alexander Brooke, 3rd Baronet (5 January 1843 – 27 November 1891), was an Anglo-Irish naturalist and baronet.

Antoine Joseph Wiertz (22 February 1806 – 18 June 1865) was a Belgian romantic painter and sculptor. ==Early life== Born in Dinant from a relatively poor family, he entered the Antwerp art academy in 1820. Thanks to his protector Pierre-Joseph de Paul de Maibe, a member of the Second Chamber of the States-General, king William I of the Netherlands awarded an annual stipend to Wiertz from 1821 onwards. Between November 1829 and May 1832, he stayed in Paris, where he studied the old masters at the Louvre. In 1828, Wiertz came out second in the competition for the prestigious Prix de Rome which he attained on his second attempt in 1832; it enabled him to go to the French Academy at Rome, where he resided from May 1834 until February 1837. Upon his return, he established himself in Liège with his mother. During his stay in Rome, Wiertz worked on his first great work, Les Grecs et les Troyens se disputant le corps de Patrocle (\\"Greeks and Trojans fighting for the body of Patroclus\\", finished in 1836), on a subject borrowed from book XVII of Homer's Iliad. It was exhibited in Antwerp in 1837, where it met with some success. Wiertz submitted the work for the Paris Salon of 1838, but it arrived too late and was refused. ==Mature works== At the Paris Salon of 1839, Wiertz showed not only his Patrocles, but also three other works: Madame Laetitia Bonaparte sur son lit de mort (\\"Madame Laetitia Bonaparte on her deathbed\\"), La Fable des trois souhaits—Insatiabilité humaine (\\"The fable of the three wishes—Human insatiability\\") and Le Christ au tombeau (\\"Christ entombed\\"). Badly hung and lit, his entry elicited indifference on the part of the public, and provoked sarcasm among the critics. This second humiliation led to a profound rancour against art critics and against Paris, as expressed in his virulent pamphlet Bruxelles capitale, Paris province. In 1844, Wiertz painted a second version of his Patrocles on an even bigger scale than the first (the 1836 version measures 3.85m by 7.03m; the 1844 version 5.20m by 8.52). The Rome version is now in the Museum of Walloon Art in Liège, the 1844 in the Wiertz Museum in Brussels. After the Paris disaster, Wiertz veered more and more to the excessive. A fine example is the monumental La Chute des Anges rebelles (\\"The Fall of the rebellious Angels\\", 1841), on an arched canvas of 11.53m by 7.93m. The death of his mother in 1844 was a terrible blow to the artist. He left Liège in 1845 to settle in Brussels for good. During this period he painted a confrontation of Beauty and Death, Deux jeunes filles—La Belle Rosine (1847), which remains perhaps his most famous work. Oil on canvas, 1847 Dissatisfied with the shiny effect of oil painting, he developed a new technique combining the smoothness of oil painting with the speed of execution and the dullness of painting in fresco. This technique of mat painting entailed the use of a mixture of colours, turpentine and petrol on holland. La Lutte homérique (\\"The Homeric struggle\\", 1853) was the first big-scale painting executed in this technique. However, the components used in this technique are responsible for the slow decay of the works produced with it. Many of his works from the 1850s have a social or philosophical message, often translated in delirious imagery, like Faim, Folie et Crime (\\"Hunger, Madness and Crime\\", 1853), La Liseuse de Romans (\\"The Reader of Novels\\", 1853), Le Suicide (\\"The Suicide\\", 1854), L'Inhumation précipitée (\\"The premature burial\\", 1854), Le Dernier Canon (\\"The last gun\\", 1855). Wiertz was also a fine portrait painter, who made self-portraits at various ages. As a sculptor, he produced his most important project towards the end of his life: a series of plasters representing Les Quatre Âges de l'Humanité (\\"The Four Ages of Humanity\\", 1860–1862), reproduced in marble for the Wiertz museum by Auguste Franck. Influenced mainly by Rubens and the late Michelangelo, Wiertz' monumental painting often moves between classical academism and lurid romanticism, between the grandiose and the ridiculous. Although his work was often derided as art pompier, his pictorial language nevertheless preannounced symbolism and a certain kind of surrealism, two currents that would be very strong in Belgian painting. ==Later life== After difficult negotiations with the Belgian government, Wiertz was able to realize his dream to turn his last studio into a museum for his works. The Belgian State bought a piece of land and funded the construction of a huge hall to accommodate the painter's monumental works. In exchange, Wiertz donated all his works to the Belgian State, with the express proviso that they should remain in his studio both during and after his lifetime. Wiertz died in his studio. His remains were embalmed in accordance with Ancient Egyptian burial rites and buried in a vault in the municipal cemetery of Ixelles. A copy of one of Antoine Wiertz's works, the statue of The Triumph of Light was once prominently located high on San Francisco's Mount Olympus between the Haight-Ashbury and Corona Heights. It had been presented to the city of San Francisco by Adolph Sutro in 1887. Over the years due to lack of care and maintenance the statue fell into disrepair. By the late 1930s, even the history and origins of the statue were no longer common knowledge in San Francisco, and by the mid-1950s, the statue disappeared. All that remains today is the pedestal and base of the monument.Sutro's Triumph of Light Statue == Honours == * Knight of the Order of Leopold.Almanach royal officiel de Belgique/1841 == Gallery == File:Wiertz burial.jpgL'Inhumation précipitée, 1854, depicts a cholera victim awakening after being placed in a coffin.

The Antoine Wiertz Museum is now one of the Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium. It is located in the Leopold district of Brussels, near the Luxembourg railway station, today overshadowed by the European Parliament complex. The Rue Wiertz runs from the museum through the Parliament complex, in an unintended echo of Wiertz' call for Brussels to become the capital of Europe. Contemporary opinions of the museum and the works therein are mixed: * \\"[The museum] is devoted to the works of one of the city's most distinctive, if disagreeable, nineteenth-century artists.\\" * \\"If you're into the shocking or nasty, it [the museum] may appeal.\\" * \\"In recent years the Wiertz Museum has attracted an average of just ten visitors a day ... The Belgian state is legally stuck with all 220 of his [Wiertz'] works—dreadful though most of them are—and an obligation to display them forever. ... [Wiertz was] perhaps the worst painter to have a government- funded museum all to himself, at least in the free world ...\\" ==FootnotesReferences== *Berko, Patrick & Viviane (1981). \\"Dictionary of Belgian painters born between 1750 & 1875\\", Knokke 1981, pp. 792–793. *Berko, Patrick & Viviane (2011). \\"19th Century European Virtuoso Painters\\", Knokke 2011, p. 520, illustrations p. 430\\\\. *Colleye, Hubert (1957).

Established in 1888, it is the oldest and largest zoological park in Texas and is managed by the non-profit Dallas Zoological Society. It is home to over 2,000 animals representing 406 species. It is an accredited member of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA), and is a member of the World Association of Zoos and Aquariums (WAZA). Since 2009, when the Dallas City Council voted unanimously to turn the zoo over to private management under the DZS, attendance and community support for the zoo has surged. In 2015, the zoo achieved an all-time annual attendance record of 1 million+ visitors. The Dallas Zoological Society is supported by over 25,510 membership households and growing. The DZS manages all fundraising, membership, special events, food services, retail operation, volunteer programs, marketing, and public relations for the zoo under management contract with the City of Dallas. ==History== The zoo was established in 1888. The zoo's first purchase was two deer and two mountain lions for $60 from a private seller in Colorado City, Colorado. The animals were placed in pens and put on display in City Park. In the 1890s, the Dallas City Council approved funding for the zoo and more animals were purchased and added to the zoo's collection. The zoo called City Park home until 1910, when it was relocated to Fair Park. In 1912, the zoo moved to in Marsalis Park which the city had purchased in 1909, from which it has expanded to its current size. Under the leadership of Zoo Commissioner William H. Atwell, the zoo acquired many more animals as well as exhibits. In the 1920s, a special Zoo Commission was created by the city and the collection was further developed with the acquisition of numerous specimens from game hunter and trapper Frank Buck. In the Depression Era of the 1930s, the facilities at the zoo underwent extensive renovation funded by the Works Progress Administration. Search on keywords \\"dallas zoo\\"Giants of the SavannaDallas Zoo's African lion The Dallas Zoological Society was established in 1955 to support the zoo. By the 1960s, the zoo was a popular and profitable attraction. In 1966, the zoo displayed over five hundred species of animals. However, by the 1980s, attitudes began to change from the profit driven display of animals toward science and the humane treatment of animals strongly advocated by the AZA. More emphasis was put on saving endangered species and breeding animals in captivity. The Dallas Zoo cooperated with this program and was accredited in 1985. Around the same time, Zoo Director Warren J. Iliff proposed an addition to be known as the Wilds of Africa. Herbert W. Reimer, a New York architect, designed the Wilds of Africa with a \\"zoogeographic grouping\\" of African animals. In addition to a nature trail, he further envisioned a slow moving monorail that visitors could ride and observe as if on safari. Two bond measures, amounting to $30.4 million, brought the expansion from the drawing board in 1983 to its opening in June 1990. On June 14, 1996, rail and bus service arrived at the zoo. Dallas Zoo station opened on the first phase of the . The connection to DART made getting to the zoo significantly more convenient. In 1997, the Kimberly-Clark Chimpanzee Forest exhibit opened to the public. On May 8, 1999, the , $4.5 million ExxonMobil Endangered Tiger Habitat opened. On September 3, 2008, the zoo announced it had received the largest gift in its 120-year history, a $5 million donation from Harold Simmons. This donation, as well as other factors, allowed the zoo to fast track the construction of the Giants of the Savanna habitat. On August 12, 2009, the Dallas City Council voted unanimously to turn the zoo over to private management. On October 1, 2009, the zoo's management responsibilities, animals, and employees were officially turned over to the Dallas Zoological Society. On May 28, 2010, the Giants of the Savanna habitat opened to national acclaim. On April 1, 2015, the Dinosaur exhibit opened hosting over 20 animatronic dinosaurs. == Exhibits == The zoo is divided into two major regions: ZooNorth and Wilds of Africa. ZooNorth is the original and oldest section of the zoo. The Wilds of Africa region was constructed seventy-eight years after ZooNorth and is accessed from ZooNorth via a tunnel beneath Clarendon Drive. It includes Giants of the Savanna, which was opened in 2010. Visitors can download the Dallas Zoo iPhone app to assist them in navigating the zoo. The zoo app is free and provides information about hours, admission, parking, directions, animals, membership, educational programs, and special events, as well as maps. The zoo is the first in the United States to offer visitors such an app in both English and Spanish. ===ZooNorth=== ZooNorth is the original and oldest section of the zoo. It features a wide range of exhibits such as the Otter Outpost, Galápagos tortoises, and Bug U!. The Hill, one of the original parts of the zoo, was closed as many of the animals there were moved to the new Giants of the Savanna exhibit. One of the more recent additions to ZooNorth is the Wildlife Amphitheater. The Wildlife Amphitheater is home to SOAR! A Festival of Flight. Primate Place features monkeys, with species from Africa and South America. ZooNorth is also home to the Pierre A. Fontaine Bird & Reptile Building where visitors are encouraged to learn about endangered reptiles, amphibians, and what can be done to save them. ;Endangered Tiger Habitat The ExxonMobil Endangered Tiger Habitat is a , $4.5 million habitat that opened on May 8, 1999 and resembles a forest in the process of regrowth after logging. A glass viewing area and pathways allow the visitor to observe Sumatran tigers and Malayan tigers. The tigers' lush exhibits feature sun and shade, shallow pools with deep channels, running streams with hot rocks, perching rocks, and climbing/clawing trees. The observation area of the exhibit consists of two buildings; House of Tiger and House of Man, designed in the Thai pole house style. The complex acts as a bridge spanning the Valley of the Tiger placing the visitors in the center of the tiger's landscape. Tiger using tree as scratching post ;Children's Zoo The Lacerte Family Children's Zoo in ZooNorth is home to the Nature Exchange, the JC Penney Discovery House, the UnderZone, a petting zoo, and pony rides. It also features an artificial creek that children are encouraged to splash around in. ;BUG U! An exhibit that teaches children about the zoo's extensive collection of invertebrates (i.e. a termite colony, honey bee colony, Texas leafcutter ants, black widows, and brown recluse spiders). ===Wilds of Africa=== The other half of the zoo is the Wilds of Africa. Opened in 1990, it was the first exhibit to feature all of the major habitats of Africa. Visitors can visit the rain forests, mountains, woodlands, rivers, deserts, and bush of Africa. The Nature Trail takes visitors through the rain forest past two large, naturalistic gorilla habitats. Nile crocodiles, wattled cranes, and a few other animals are seen before the Forest Aviary. In the middle of the forest is the Kopje, home to rock hyraxes, klipspringers, and meerkats. The rain forest/watering hole is also home to hippopotamus and okapi, which the zoo, in the case of the latter, is famous for in both its breeding and research. About 20 percent of okapi in zoos in the U.S. and Japan can trace their lineage back to it. Tunnel to Wilds of Africa and Giants of the SavannaShana and Zola in the bachelor habitatJuba and B'wenzi in the bachelor habitatChimpanzee Forest ;Penguin Cove Penguin Cove is home to about a dozen African penguins. The penguins can be seen above and under the water as they walk and swim around their exhibit. ;Chimpanzee Forest The Kimberly-Clark Chimpanzee Forest exhibit opened in 1997. Visitors can observe the chimpanzees from the open air viewing station or from the floor-to-ceiling observation windows. Chimpanzee Forest features a waterfall, stream, climbing structures, trees and rocks that are heated in the winter and cooled in the summer. Another feature is an artificial termite mound where the chimpanzees can fish with long sticks for special treats, such as peanut butter and honey. In addition to their food from the zoo commissary, there are more than 40 edible plants in their area for them to forage on. ;Gorilla Research Center Originally opened in 1990, the Gorilla Research Center is a habitat featuring a lush naturalistic landscape. The habitat was designed in a way that encourages the gorillas to roam freely in an environment that replicates, as closely as possible, their native equatorial forest habitat. The exhibit includes two areas, separated by a wall, which provide enough room for two gorilla troops. The exhibit closed in 2004 and reopened in 2006 after undergoing a $2.2 million renovation to raise the exhibit walls from 12 feet to 15 feet and add a visitor's center. The visitor's center is known as the Gorilla Research Station. It features high vantage points and floor-to-ceiling windows where visitors can interact with the gorillas and have their questions answered by on site gorilla guides. The habitat is currently home to two gorilla troops; a bachelor troop and a family troop. The bachelors are named Juba, B'wenzi, Shana, and Zola. Juba and B'wenzi came to the Dallas Zoo in 2011 and Shana and Zola, half-brothers, arrived in 2013. The family troop members are Subira, the silverback, Madge, and her daughter, Shanta, and Megan. The goal was for former silverback Patrick and one of the females to breed but in September 2013 the plan was abandoned due to Patrick's lack of interest in reproducing.Anti-social gorilla shown the door. 3 News NZ. September 25, 2013. ;Crocodile Isle Crocodile Isle allows visitors to view Nile crocodiles from behind glass. Visitors can watch crocodiles swim, lounge in the sun, and even devour their food at public feedings. ;Forest Aviary The Forest Aviary contains colorful and exotic birds native only to Africa in a habitat featuring a wooded landscape, rock cliffs, and a tranquil stream. ;Wilds of Africa Adventure Safari The Wilds of Africa Adventure Safari is a 20-minute, one-mile, narrated monorail ride, which travels around the watering hole (hippopotamus) rain forest (okapi), mountain (Nubian ibex), woodlands (Grévy's zebra), river (waterbuck, greate white pelicans, Goliath herons, blue cranes), arid desert (scimitar-horned oryx, addra gazelle), semi-arid desert (addax, gemsbok, ostrich) and bush (gerenuk, black crowned cranes, greater kudu, Thomson's gazelle, marabou storks) exhibits. The monorail features aerial views of the Simmons Hippo Outpost, Chimpanzee Forest, Nile crocodile, and Penguin Cove exhibits, which are also accessible via the Nature Trail. The monorail originally opened in 1990 but after two decades of use and over a million passengers, the attraction began to show its age with aging infrastructure and several electrical outages that left passengers stranded on the tour. The final incident in August 2014 prompted zoo officials to shut down the attraction for evaluation. Following the evaluation the DZS decided a $3 million renovation was in order. On March 25, 2016, the Monorail Safari reopened as the Wilds of Africa Adventure Safari featuring a new sound system, an upgraded station, air-conditioning, upgraded mechanical and electrical components and new graphics on the individual cars. Additionally, a diesel powered tug is now on standby to nudge the trains back to the station in the event of a power failure. ;Giants of the Savanna Phase II of the Wilds of Africa, Giants of the Savanna, opened on May 28, 2010. This is an expansion to the current Wilds of Africa, and features four female African elephants, a large herd of reticulated giraffes, African lions, South African cheetahs, impala, Grant's zebras, ostriches, guineafowl, warthogs, red river hogs and the newest attraction African Wild Dogs. Visitors have the opportunity to feed lettuce leaves and rye crackers to the herd of giraffe at the Giraffe Feeding Station. Five of the eleven acres are dedicated to the eight African elephants; Jenny, Gypsy, Kamba, Congo, Tendaji, Mlilo, Zola, Ajabu. The elephants' facilities are state of the art with padded floors and a community room with seven feet of dirt that allows the pachyderms to indulge their natural inclination for digging. The exhibit is the first in North America to mix elephants with giraffes, zebras, ostriches, impala, and guineafowl. Also in the exhibit is a pride of four lions and a family of three cheetahs. In between the lion and cheetah exhibits, there is a \\"Predator Encounter\\" area where the keepers give educational talks. Climate controlled rocks draw the lions to a floor-to-ceiling bay window at the Serengeti Grill, where they sit or lay within mere inches of diners. On March 11, 2016, five new African elephants arrived from Swaziland in order to escape a drought. Two years later, Nolwazi and her daughter Amahle were transferred to Fresno Chaffee Zoo in Fresno, California. Elephants in the Giants of the Savanna habitat Giraffes, zebras, antelopes and elephants in Giants of the Savanna ==Awards== On October 6, 2011, the zoo received special recognition from the Association of Zoos and Aquariums for the Giants of the Savanna Habitat. The $32.5 million habitat is the first in North America, as well as one of the first on the planet, to combine a variety of large species in a single exhibit in order to re-create the landscape of the African savanna. ==Conservation== The zoo is highly proactive in species preservation and conservation efforts and participates in over 40 Species Survival Plans (SSP) with the Association of Zoos and Aquariums. The following is a list of the Species Survival Plans (SSP) that the zoo is involved with *Addax *Addra gazelle *African elephant *African penguin *African wild dog *Allen's swamp monkey *Andean condor *Arabian oryx *Aruba Island rattlesnake *Bali starling *Black rhinoceros *Eastern bongo *Cheetah *Chestnut-mandibled toucan *Chimpanzee *Chinese alligator *Cottontop tamarin *Fishing cat *Geoffroy's spider monkey *Golden lion tamarin *Great hornbill *Grévy's zebra *Kori bustard *Lake Victoria cichlids *Louisiana pine snake *Malayan tiger *Mandrill *Mona monkey *Ocelot *Okapi *Oriental small-clawed otter *Pink pigeon *Puerto Rican crested toad *Radiated tortoise *Rhinoceros hornbill *Ring-tailed lemur *Ruffed lemur *Scimitar oryx *Spectacled langur *Sumatran tiger *Thick-billed parrot *Wattled crane *Western lowland gorilla *White-cheeked gibbon The zoo supports many conservation projects including Okapi Conservation - Epulu Research Station, Zaire, International Rhino Foundation, Chimp Haven, Bushmeat Crisis Task Force, Gray's Monitor Lizard In The Philippines, Taxon Advisory Groups (Tag), Bowling For Rhinos, and the Thailand Hornbill Project - Adopt A Hornbill Nest. In addition to conservation, sustainability efforts by the zoo include growing bamboo and cabbage to function as part of the landscape aesthetic throughout the zoo. The overgrowth is harvested and used as food for the zoo's herbivores. ;Cell Phone Recycling The zoo collects and recycles cell phones through a program called ECO-CELL. The objective of both the zoo and ECO-CELL is to reduce coltan mining. Coltan is a raw material used in the manufacturing process of cell phones and it is mined almost exclusively in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The mining results in a loss of habitat for gorillas, elephants, okapi and many others. For every cell phone recycled through ECO-CELL, the zoo receives a donation to its conservation fund. ECO- CELL has partnerships with over 110 zoos and is a member of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA). ==Events== Safari Nights is the zoo's concert series that takes place on eight consecutive Saturday nights during the summer season. Running For Rhinos is a 1k or 5k run to raise money to help protect rhinos in the wild. The event features door prizes, massages, awards, and foods. Halloween Nights at the Dallas Zoo is a four night event held every October just days before Halloween. Zoo To Do is the zoo's annual fundraising gala. Patrons of this exclusive event have the opportunity to view the animals, enjoy food from some of Dallas’ top chefs, bid on auction items, and dance. Dollar Day at the zoo is held one day in July and one day in November. The zoo shows its appreciation to the community for its support with $1 admission all day. Families can look for dollar deals on food, drinks and gifts throughout the zoo. ==Future== In Spring 2017, hippos returned to the zoo for the first time since the death of their last hippo 15 years back with the opening of Simmons Hippo Outpost. In February 2016 ground was broken on the $13.5 million, 3.5 acre immersive habitat that houses three Nile hippos; one male and two females. The habitat features an overlook deck and an underwater viewing area as well as be visible from the Wilds of Africa Monorail Safari. The Dallas Zoo Conservation Education & Science Center is a proposed facility that will be located adjacent to ZooNorth. The facility will be a teaching laboratory for conservation of the world ecology systems and will be LEED certified silver level category. It will include research, teaching and interpretive facilities, and will become the new entrance to the zoo. This project is currently in the design phase and on hold pending funding. ==Transportation== The nearest DART station is Dallas Zoo on the . The zoo is also served by bus routes 19, 515 and 522. Every Monday and Tuesday, from March through December, the zoo offers $2 off admission to visitors who present their same-day DART pass at the Dallas Zoo ticket booth. == Incidents == On March 18, 2004, a gorilla named Jabari scaled a retaining wall and injured four visitors. He was fatally shot by a police SWAT team after being pursued by zoo employees through the Wilds of Africa exhibit. This incident prompted several zoos to create or enhance emergency response teams to deal with escaped animals. The Jake L. Hamon Gorilla Research Center was redesigned with new landscape, taller walls, and expanded viewing areas for visitors, including an air conditioned visitor center with floor-to-ceiling windows, videos, and on-site “gorilla guides” to answer questions and point out interesting facts. The exhibit is home to two gorilla troops. On November 17, 2013, one of the male lions, either Dinari or Kamaia, killed Johari, one of the three lionesses. Witnesses to the tragedy say that it appeared that both of the male lions were simply roughhousing with Johari. Apparently one of the males seized Johari by the neck, cutting off her oxygen supply. Witnesses said they didn't know Johari had been killed until she went visibly limp. By then, zoo keepers were on the scene throwing meat into the habitat in an attempt to distract the two brothers. Dallas Zoo officials later confirmed that Johari sustained no other wounds and was killed quickly by the bite she suffered to the neck. A reason for the attack was not immediately determined. On January 7, 2014, The Dallas Zoo announced that Kamau, a six month old cheetah cub, died from a bout of pneumonia. He and his brother, Winspear, were both sick with the illness, and Kamau suddenly worsened and went into cardiac arrest. He could not be revived. The two cubs were originally born at the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute in Front Royal, Virginia. On July 28, 2015, a giraffe calf named Kipenzi died when she broke her neck after accidentally running into the edge of her herd's enclosure. Kipenzi was born into fame after her birth was broadcast and streamed live on Animal Planet. On October 10, 2018, a hippo named Adhama suddenly died, according to the zoo. They said that the hippo became ill, and later found him unresponsive. An examination revealed that Adhama had severe enteritis, which is the acute inflammation of the intestines. Earlier in the year, Boipelo, the mate to the deceased hippo, gave birth to their calf, but it died of natural causes moments after birth. In 2019, Adhama became the late father to Boipelo's second calf, Adanna. She was named after her father. On June 17, 2019, Witten, a one year old giraffe, suddenly died during a medical exam. While under anesthetics, he stopped breathing, and the zoo staff could not revive him. The zoo said he was due to be transported to Canada in September, and they were doing his examinations. He was named after current Dallas Cowboys tight end Jason Witten. On July 4, 2019, Ola, an 8 year old African painted dog recently obtained by the Dallas Zoo, was found dead in her back enclosure. She died after her pack mates, Mzingo and Jata, attacked her and delivered wounds that were fatal. Ola was transported from the Columbus Zoo a few weeks prior to her death, and seemed to get along well with her packmates. The Dallas Zoo said on Twitter the dogs were only exhibiting natural behavior, and they did nothing wrong. On November 4, 2019, the Dallas Zoo announced that Hope, a twenty-three year old western lowland gorilla, had passed away without warning. The zoo reported that the gorilla family was suffering from a bout of gastrointestinal issues, and while the cause of death was not immediately confirmed, a necropsy found Hope's colon severely inflamed. Hope became famous when she gave birth to Saambili, the first gorilla baby the Dallas Zoo had in twenty years. According to the zoo, Saambili and her family were \\"understandably shaken\\" and were taken off the habitat for a period of time to recover. On March 27, 2020, the Dallas Zoo revealed on social media that silverback gorilla Subira had died of heart failure. He had a cough that was being monitored; zoologists believed he had \\"nothing more of a common cold\\". A necropsy revealed that Subira had a cardiovascular disease. The zoo had worked closely in research on how to prevent heart disease in male gorillas, which is the number one cause of death in them. It was also said that Subira was healthy and examinations confirmed nothing was wrong. The zoo has said he did not catch coronavirus, a disease causing a worldwide pandemic. Subira was the second gorilla death at the zoo in four months following the death of Hope in November 2019. Before his death he fathered two children, Saambili and Mbani. He was the only full- grown silverback in the group, which contains three female gorillas and one baby male: Megan, Shanta, Saambili, and Mbani. ==ReferencesCategory:Parks in Dallas Category:Zoos in Texas Category:Buildings and structures in Dallas Category:Culture of Dallas Category:Landmarks in Dallas Category:Economy of Dallas Category:Tourist attractions in Dallas Category:Zoos established in 1888 ","title":"Dallas Zoo"},{"id":"2212223","text":"is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Hiroyuki Nishimori. The story revolves around the adventures of 15-year-old schoolgirl Megumi Amatsuka, a popular and beautiful tomboy that always get into fights with a secret: she used to be a boy. Originally serialized in Weekly Shōnen Sunday, it has been collected into 20 tankōbon volumes. It was adapted as a 50-episode anime television series produced by TMS Entertainment, which was broadcast on TV Tokyo between June 2002 and March 2003. In 2001, the manga won the 46th Shogakukan Manga Award for shōnen. ==Story== At the age of nine, Megumi is an aggressive boy prone to always fighting. One day he saves a strange man from a gang of other children. In return, Megumi receives a magical book. After accidentally bleeding on the book, a genie named Pierrot appears and offers to grant him a wish. Megumi wishes to become a strong man's man. Pierrot, a trickster, inadvertently turns Megumi into a woman. Megumi, furious, throws the book into the riverbank. Believing the only way to reverse the spell is to retrieve the book, Megumi begins a 6-year-long search but is told that she can find the book if she attends Furinkan High School. ==Characters== ; : :While Megumi is physically a very attractive female, she still retains her masculine mannerisms and fighting abilities, which she uses very often, attracting the 'Megu-chan Protection Club', a group of misfit admirers. Nobody else knows she used to be a boy but was transformed into a girl; initially only Megumi's best friend, Miki, knew her secret, however the protection club quickly finds out. Out of all the men in Furinkan High, the only one who seems to make any headway is Genzō Soga for his unparalleled willingness to do anything to prove himself to Megumi. A tomboy at heart, if she unintentionally displays any sort of affection for anyone, she is very quick to deny everything. At the end of the manga, it is revealed that she was and always had been a girl. She wished to be a boy because when they were younger, despite being stronger than Genzō, he injured himself to protect her, saying that it was a man's duty to protect a woman, and she wanted to protect Miki from any harm. She confesses her love to Genzo at the end of the series, and kisses him. ; : :Miki is Megumi's childhood friend and would do anything to help her. She is the only one that remembers the former Megumi and knows of the transformation. She does everything she can to turn Megumi into a better more feminine girl and even goes so far as to threaten to stop being Megumi's friend if she cuts her hair. Miki is extremely loyal to Megumi and has been at her side since pre-school, she even accepted an arranged marriage just so she could go to the same high school as Megumi. ; : :A spoiled brat and Megumi's rival. She shows up later in the series. She suffers a form of superiority complex. She hates Megumi because she realizes that everyone around her thinks Megumi is more beautiful than she is. Now she follows Megumi where ever she goes in hope of dis-proving Megumi's beauty. ; : :His real name is unknown. Megu-papa is perverted like Yasuda, frequently seen entering Megumi's room through secret entrances he creates without Megumi's permission. ; : :Megumi's mother. Her work requires her to travel around the world, so she's rarely home. ===Megu-chan Protection Club=== ; : :A very stubborn punk who has become Megumi's biggest admirer. The strongest in terms of physical power, Genzō is feared by many at school and various gangs in the city. The manga begins with Megumi, upset that this punk has mistreated his most recent girlfriend, beating Genzō up, the first person to do it since at least grade-school. Soon after that incident, Genzō quickly falls head over heels in love for Megumi. On his 16th birthday, Genzō proposed to Megumi but he was rejected. In the manga, it is revealed that Genzō received his scar protecting Megu from falling glass while she was rescuing Miki from kidnappers. Genzō often refers to Megumi as Megu-chan as a sign affection. At the end of the manga, Megumi reciprocates his feelings, and the two kiss. ; : :An \\"average\\" boy trying to escape his reputation for being weird and a pervert at his previous school. While appearing physically inferior to Genzō, he has fought to defend himself and Megumi on several occasions. Near the end of the series, he seemed to have accepted the role as Yoshimi's 'Prince'. ; : :The perverted and yet good-hearted nerd who nosebleeds when he gets overly excited. Yasuda is the weakest when it comes to physical prowess, but his intelligence continues to surprise everyone and aids the group solving many problems. He has a little brother that looks like a mini version of him and the same personality. Yasuda looks like a cute girl when his glasses are removed. ; : :A samurai in-training and arguably the most decent man in the group.

It moved from a group established to challenge the leadership of the party from the left to the vanguard of Tony Blair's drive to modernise the party's organisation and policies. The LCC was established in 1978 to co-ordinate the efforts of the Labour left. As such it was extremely broad including, for instance, members of the Campaign for Labour Party Democracy, Labour Briefing, and the fiercely anti-Trotskyist National Organisation of Labour Students (NOLS). In 1981, the LCC supported the campaign of Tony Benn against Denis Healey for the deputy leadership of the party, but many were deeply unhappy with Benn's campaign and approach and the LCC began to evolve into a body aiming to rescue the party from the mess it found itself in as the SDP split and Benn's campaign imprinted an image of extremism in the minds of the voters. The anti- Trotskyism of NOLS was central to this period as they were able to successfully outmanoeuvre the far-left groups, having developed their skills in the bitter struggle of the Clause Four Group with Militant in the student movement. In 1983, the LCC organised a conference, After the Landslide, to examine the lessons from the party's catastrophic defeat of that year: the tone the conference set, that organisational and political modernisation and change were essential, was to become the dominant theme in the party's internal life in the following decade. Robin Cook became the LCC's principal voice in parliament and Peter Hain was a prominent voice outside Westminster. Cherie Booth was also an active member, serving on the LCC executive. Under Neil Kinnock's leadership the LCC became fully engaged in the struggle against Militant and the LCC was broadly supportive of the leadership, though it backed John Prescott's unsuccessful 1988 challenge to deputy leader Roy Hattersley. The defeat of Militant left the group without a real cause and membership began to decline, although it sponsored the launch of a new discussion journal, Renewal, in 1993 and firmly repositioned itself as a group of modernisers rather than on the soft left. In 1998, with New Labour now in power, the LCC voted to wind itself up. ==External links== * The full text of Tony Blair's letter to Michael Foot written in July 1982 Category:Labour Party (UK) factions Category:New Labour ","title":"Labour Co-ordinating Committee"},{"id":"2212245","text":"Agoura High School is a public high school in Agoura Hills, California, United States.

It was built and originally run by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), the Hollywood studio. The main architect of the cinema was Thomas W. Lamb of New York City, and D. W. Ditchburn (Senior partner of the architectural firm Ditchburn Mistry and Bhedwar) of Mumbai was the associate architect. It was one of the main sites targeted in the \\" 2008 Mumbai Attacks \\" ==History== Metro Cinema c.2005 Metro is located in the Dhobitalao area of Mumbai. The Art Deco cinema opened on 5 June 1938, and initially exhibited movies made by MGM. The interior, floors, walls, ceilings as well as the furniture, was in shades of red and pink. The marble foyer and staircases led up to murals executed by students of the J. J. School of Art, under the director Charles Gerard. Among the famous invitees was Gregory Peck. And if the films were classy, so was the audience at Metro. The ushers wore suits and the soda fountain provided excellent bar snacks and service. In 1955 Metro was the venue for the first Filmfare Awards night. In 1970, the cinema was taken over by the Gupta family and with Indianisation came the era of screening Hindi films and flashy, glittering, star-studded premieres. Raj Kapoor's Bobby set the trend and when RK released Satyam Shivam Sundaram in typical monsoon fury, the guests were delighted when the young Kapoor brothers — Randhir, Rishi and Rajeev — opened their car doors, held umbrellas over their heads and led them inside. It soon became Bollywood's most famous red-carpet theatre. The star presence at Metro became so huge that most often riot police had to be called in at film premieres. ==Transformation into multiplex== Metro, c. 2012 Despite such achievements, Metro could not stand up to the multiplex invasion, it was becoming difficult to fill up the 1,491 seats. The promoters decided to transform the old cinema into a multiplex, while also restoring its original art-deco interiors. The cinema was acquired by Adlabs Cinemas and in the start of 2005, the cinema closed down. After a massive retrofitting job in August 2006, the cinema re-opened. Keeping with its famous red-carpet reputation, the cinema re-opened in its new avatar with the much anticipated Karan Johar Movie \\"Kabhi Alvida Na Kehna\\". The cinema now has six screens, which are among the largest multiplex screens in Mumbai.The math doesn't add up for Mumbai's Art Deco cinemas. Livemint (19 May 2009). Retrieved on 2013-08-17. It has been renovated keeping its old heritage look. Today the cinema has restored it spacious and beautiful look, artistic murals, glittering chandeliers, rich drapery, and Italian marble flooring. Cing tables and hi-tech restrooms with LCDs showing trailers and movie trivia. ==Other Activities== On the ground floor upon entering the cinema building, there is 'Cafe Unwind' where the public can hang out even without the movie tickets. ==References *At Metro Cinema junction, no more darting through traffic Category:Cinemas in Mumbai Category:Art Deco architecture in India Category:Thomas W.

She was born in Hebron, Connecticut on December 18, 1814 but later settled in Litchfield, Ohio. There she worked as a lecturer for the Western Anti-Slavery Society and Ohio Women's Rights Association. At the end of the American Civil War she moved to Washington, D.C., to help work with the unemployed freedmen. Much of her work was done through the Freedmen's Bureau, where she worked as an assistant to the assistant commissioner and as an agent. Griffing was also active in several women's rights organizations. She died in Washington, D.C. on February 18, 1872. == Early life == Josephine White was born in Hebron, Connecticut on December 18, 1814 into a prominent New England family. Her father, Joseph White Jr., was a representative in Connecticut's state legislature, while her mother was the sister of portrait painter Samuel Lovett Waldo. Despite the relative fame of her family, little is known of her childhood in Connecticut. In 1835, at the age of twenty, Josephine married Charles Griffing, and in 1842 they moved to Litchfield, Ohio where they had five daughters. Three of them - Emma, Helen, and Josephine Cora - survived to adulthood. == Abolitionist work == While living in Litchfield, the Griffings became involved with some of the radical organizations that were thriving in Ohio's Western Reserve. By 1849, both Charles and Josephine were active members of the Western Anti-Slavery Society, and by 1851 they were traveling agents, preaching \\"no union with slaveholders.\\" Griffing also began going on lecture tours on abolitionism throughout the West, becoming one of the most prolific anti-slavery speakers in the region. She also wrote articles for The Anti-Slavery Bugle, a newspaper published out of Salem, Ohio. The Griffings opened up their home as a stop on the Underground Railroad. During the Civil War, Griffing acted as the western agent for the Women's Loyal National League, a feminist organization that worked to outlaw slavery in every state. == Aiding the freedpeople == During the Civil War, Griffing was struck by the plight of the recently freed slaves, especially those who were fleeing to Washington, D.C. Determined to help the freedpeople establish themselves, Griffing and her three daughters moved to Washington, D.C. in 1864, while her husband remained in Ohio. Why her husband remained behind is uncertain. Griffing became an agent for the National Freedmen's Relief Association of the District of Columbia, where she opened up two industrial schools for freedwomen in order to teach them marketable skills such as sewing. These schools were also designed to inculcate freedwomen with the values of the Northern white middle class. In Griffing's words, \\"the Industrial School furnishes an opportunity for instruction in social science, and domestic relations, as well as the higher forms of Industry, and a marked change is observable in personal tidiness, good manners, and in the control and government of young children - whom some of the mothers are obliged to bring with them to the Rooms.\\" While in Washington, Griffing also used her political influence to lobby Congressmen for more direct aid for the formerly enslaved people of Washington. Through her lobbying of Radical Republican members of Congress, such as Benjamin Wade and Charles Sumner, Griffing became instrumental in establishing the Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen, and Abandoned Lands, more commonly known as the Freedmen's Bureau. In June 1865, as reward for her work in helping to create the Freedmen's Bureau, Commissioner Oliver Otis Howard appointed Griffing the assistant to the assistant commissioner for Washington, D.C. Despite Griffing's prominence in the Freedmen's Bureau, she and the male leaders of the organization often conflicted over how best to aid the freedpeople of Washington. Griffing argued that the freedpeople required direct aid, such as food, clothes, and fuel, and that the Bureau's main goals should be to provide material aid for those living in Washington. This aid, according to Griffing, was necessary for the freedpeople to become financially stable, and once that occurred they could obtain jobs and support themselves. However, men involved in freedpeople's aid organizations disagreed with Griffing's claims. They often supported the ideals of free labor; these men encouraged self-reliance and the signing of labor contracts so that freedpeople could survive financially without assistance as quickly as possible. Griffing openly spoke out about the lack of direct aid, claiming that 20,000 freedpeople in Washington, D.C. were suffering for lack of rations and supplies and that the Bureau men would not help them. The agents of the Bureau denied her statement, despite the evidence supporting her argument. By November 1865, Commissioner Howard revoked Griffing's appointment due to these conflicts, stating that \\"this Bureau has not received any funds from Mrs. Griffing and does not assume responsibility of the collections she is making.\\" Even with this setback, Griffing continued to help better the lives of the freedpeople. She worked with her government contacts to help freedpeople find jobs in the north, and sometimes travelled with them to make sure they arrived safely. The Freedmen's Bureau worked with Griffing on this project, providing barracks in Rhode Island, offices in New York City, and fund for rent and other necessary expenses. By 1867, Griffing was working for the Freedmen's Bureau once more, this time as an agent for the Capitol Hill and Navy Yard districts. Throughout her tenure, Griffing fought for increased aid for the freedpeople, as well as continuing her efforts at finding employment for African Americans in the north. She also kept contact with her associates in the federal government and in private aid organizations in order to obtain as much aid as possible for the destitute of Washington, D.C. Griffing worked as an agent for the Freedmen's Bureau until it ran out of funding and was forced to stop providing aid in late 1869. She continued working to aid freedpeople through the National Freedmen's Aid Association of the District of Columbia until her death in 1872. == Work for women’s rights == In addition to her work for the freedpeople of Washington, D.C., Griffing was also a women's rights activist. In the 1850s, Griffing became involved with women's rights organizations, making contact with women like Susan B. Anthony who would inspire her to fight for the rights of women as well as African Americans. Throughout the 1850s, Griffing joined various feminist organizations, such as the Ohio Women's Rights Association, which she became the president of in 1853. Shortly after President Abraham Lincoln gave the Emancipation Proclamation in 1863, Griffing joined the Women's Loyal National League as a lecturing agent, where she helped collect thousands of signatures for a women's antislavery petition that was eventually presented to the United States Congress by Charles Sumner. Griffing was also active in the temperance movement that was popular amongst many feminist activists during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. While in Washington, D.C., Griffing maintained her dedication to women's rights and the cause of suffrage. In 1866 she helped found the American Equal Rights Association, whose purpose was to promote equality and suffrage for all people no matter their race or sex; she also served as its first vice-president. Griffing became the president of District of Columbia woman suffrage association in 1867, where she helped monitor guide suffrage activities in Washington, D.C. In 1869, along with Susan B. Anthony, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and other prominent reformers, Griffing joined the National Woman Suffrage Association and acted as its corresponding secretary. Josephine Griffing died in 1872, with her cause of death listed as \\"consumption.\\" She was 57 at the time, and was survived by her husband and her three daughters. ==See also== * List of suffragists and suffragettes == References == Category:1814 births Category:1872 deaths Category:People from Hebron, Connecticut Category:Underground Railroad people Category:American abolitionists Category:American temperance activists Category:19th-century deaths from tuberculosis Category:People from Medina County, Ohio ","title":"Josephine Sophia White Griffing"},{"id":"2212264","text":"Austrfararvísur (English:\\"East Journey Verses\\") is a skaldic poem composed by the Icelandic skald Sigvat Tordarson.Sigvat Tordarson (Store norske leksikon) Sigvat was a bard in the court of King Olaf II of Norway.

Formerly a member of Vietnam's Communist party, she was expelled from the party in 1989, and has been denied the right to travel abroad, and was temporarily imprisoned for her writings and outspoken criticism of corruption in the Vietnamese government. == Early life == Born in 1947 in Thái Bình a province in northern Vietnam, Dương came of age just as the Vietnam War was turning violent. At the age of twenty, when she was a student at Vietnamese Ministry of Culture’s Arts College, Dương Thu Hương volunteered to serve in a women’s youth brigade on the front lines of \\"The War Against the Americans\\". Dương spent the next seven years of the war in the jungles and tunnels of Bình Trị Thiên, the most heavily bombarded region of the war. Her mission was to \\"sing louder than the bombs\\" and to give theatrical performances for the North Vietnamese troops, but also to tend to the wounded, bury the dead, and accompany the soldiers along. She was one of three survivors out of the forty volunteers in that group. She was also at the front during China’s attacks on Vietnam in 1979 during the short-lived Sino-Vietnamese War. However, in the period after Vietnam’s reunification in 1975, Dương became increasingly outspoken and critical about the repressive atmosphere created by the Communist government. Upon seeing the conditions in the South – compared with the North – she began speaking out against the communist government. == Writings == Her first novels, Journey in Childhood (Hành trình ngày thơ ấu, 1985), Beyond Illusions (Bên kia bờ ảo vọng, 1987),Beyond Illusions Paperback – January 3, 2003 Paradise of the Blind (Những thiên đường mù, 1988)Paradise of the Blind: A novel Paperback – July 1, 1994 and The Lost Life (Quãng đời đánh mất, 1989) were published in her native Vietnam and soon became bestsellers in Vietnam before they were banned. The third one was also the first Vietnamese novel ever published in the United States in English.VIETNAMESE Her next three books — Novel Without a Name (Tiểu thuyết vô đề, 1991),Novel without a Name Paperback – June 1, 1996 Memories of a Pure Spring (2000), Paperback – January 1, 2001 and No Man's Land (Chốn vắng, 2002)No Man's Land Hardcover – April 13, 2005 — have not been published in the United States. She was made a Chevalier of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by the French government (1994).Duong Thu Huong at PEN She earlier wrote a number of short stories and screenplays. One story, \\"Reflections of Spring,\\" was translated by Linh Dinh and included in the anthology, Night, Again: Contemporary Fiction from Vietnam (Seven Stories Press 2006). The latest novel No Man's Land (Terre des oublis in French, which won the Grand prix des lectrices de Elle (2007)), perhaps her most successful, was in the final list of the prize Femina 2006 and received the Grand prix des lectrices de Elle in 2007. == Political fallout == Dương has been labeled as a \\"dissident writer\\" and been expelled by Vietnam’s Communist party and was imprisoned for a short time in 1991 for remarks criticizing the goals and interests of the party and its members. This is not unusual in contemporary Vietnam; Linh Dinh, in his introduction to the collection Night, Again, details the government’s extreme response to certain subjects in writing – for example, in 1956, the poet Tran Dan was arrested for capitalizing \\"He\\" in a brief passage of a poem cataloging social despair, since such a designation was reserved for Ho Chi Minh. In 1991, Le Minh Khue was still criticized for having a North Vietnamese female soldier daydream about the smile of a handsome South Vietnamese prisoner of war. Though she was one of Vietnam’s most popular writers, most of her fiction is published outside of Vietnam due to both the censorship and the government’s monopoly of the publishing industry. Recently, she has retired and earns a pension of approximately twenty U.S. dollars per month and must earn her living working as a translator and trying to publish her novels and short stories abroad. She believes in struggling to gain democracy; while unable to run for political office or organize a competing party, she now uses writing in order to articulate that message. In her story \\"The Story of an Actress,\\" Dương combines her passionate beliefs about human freedom with her existentialist literary sensibilities. Bê and Thom live next door to one another and become best friends; while Bê is intelligent and fun-loving, Thom develops into the town beauty. Thom ends up marrying the most famous theater director in Vietnam, a man 40 years her senior, in an attempt to become an actress; Bê visits her and watches her life disintegrate as she works toward her degree and her own life dream. On the surface, it seems to be a relatively simple story about two girls growing up and choosing different paths in life. But her language and details betray, as with Ho Xuan Huong, a deeper level to a simple story. She is critiquing a contemporary society where beauty is prized over intellect and money over kindness, and calling attention to how the optimism of youth, when it fades, can be so devastating that it drives people to despair. According to Dương, most writers must learn how to voice their individual concerns within a group mentality. In other words, their writing must reflect the individual and the masses at large in a way that's approved by the party; Dương finds that most writers in contemporary Vietnam get caught up in the group thinking mentality. Dương has felt the effects of censorship perhaps more cruelly than many of her fellow writers. Her work is not contained in any Vietnamese anthologies or collections. Though she has achieved success and renown abroad for her novels through translation, the audience she is writing for in Vietnam, that would most understand the minutiae of her stories, does not often have the opportunity to read her work, except when it is smuggled into Vietnam. Nevertheless, Dương is hopeful for the future of writing in her country. She is counting on the fact that at some point, the people will open their eyes to see what's going on in her homeland. Dương moved to Paris in 2006. In January 2009, her latest novel, Đỉnh Cao Chói Lọi, was published; it was also translated into French as Au zénith. ==Awards and honors== *2001: Prince Claus Award *2005: Oxfam Novib/PEN Award * 2007: Grand prix des lectrices de Elle ==List of works translated into English== * Beyond Illusions (1987) *Paradise of the Blind (1988) * Novel Without A Name (1995) * Memories of a Pure Spring (1996) * No Man's Land (2002) * The Zenith (2009) == References  External links == *Review of No Man's Land in January magazine *Duong Thu Huong /Banned Books *A discourse shaped by the Vietnam War Dương Thu Hương in France By Alan Riding(International Herald Tribune Published: FRIDAY, JULY 15, 2005) *Dương Thu Hương entry on Wikivietlit *Beyond Illusions, translated from Bên kia bờ ảo vọng *Novel without a Name, translated from Tiểu thuyết vô đề * Review of Memories of a Pure Spring Category:1947 births Category:Living people Category:Vietnamese novelists Category:Vietnamese women writers Category:Vietnamese dissidents Category:People from Thái Bình Province Category:North Vietnamese military personnel of the Vietnam War Category:Chevaliers of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres Category:Communist Party of Vietnam politicians Category:Vietnamese women in politics Category:French people of Vietnamese descent Category:Women in war in Vietnam Category:Women in warfare post-1945 Category:Women novelists Category:Communist women writers Category:People's Liberation Army in fiction ","title":"Dương Thu Hương"},{"id":"2212281","text":"Apache Skies is a four-issue comic book limited series, published in 2002 by Marvel Comics as a part of that company's MAX imprint.

He founded the Australian logistics company Linfox in 1956, and is now non- executive chairman. Linfox is Australia's largest privately held logistics company, with more than 5,000 trucks across ten countries throughout the Asia- Pacific region. == Early life == Lindsay Fox was brought up in Prahran, a suburb of Melbourne. He was educated at Melbourne High School, but was asked to leave during Year 10, at age 16, due to his lack of academic interest. He started working as a truck driver and was able to use this as a springboard to found Linfox. He has since visited Melbourne High School on numerous formal occasions. ===Football career=== For many of his earlier years, Lindsay Fox played Australian rules football with moderate success, and he continues his involvement with the sport. Recruited from the St Kilda Football Club's thirds side (which he captained), Fox was sent to Golden Point Football Club in the Ballarat Football League before he returned to make his Victorian Football League debut in 1960. Fox did not think much of his footballing abilities, but as a ruckman he went on to play 20 games (for 3 goals) between 1959 and 1961. Following his stint in the VFL, he went to the VFA, playing firstly for Moorabbin, where he won a premiership, and then for Brighton-Caulfield, where he moved after Moorabbin's expulsion from the Association. He later returned in an administrative role, becoming the president of the Saints in 1979. == Business interests == Fox started Linfox in 1956 with one truck. He also took ownership of Melbourne's Luna Park in late 2005. In 2006, he made an unsuccessful bid for the development of the neighboring 'Triangle Site' on St Kilda's foreshore. The property was subsequently destroyed by fire. He has been involved with a number of high-profile disputes with the Government relating to his property development activities. In the late 1990s he attempted to claim the public beach area in front of his holiday home as a private helipad for his helicopter and to build a high security compound for himself and his family. This development was rejected by the Victorian Planning Minister. However he has also been able to use his government contacts to gain favorable treatment by being granted permission to land his helicopter near his Portsea home on crown land.ABC News Online Fox has been in dispute with the local council of his mansion by attempting to have the heritage listing that applies to all homes in the street removed from his property. His son's Toorak home was destroyed by fire. ==Personal life== Fox has been married for fifty years, with six children. In 2004 on the ABC TV George Negus Tonight program, Fox's work ethic and business savviness was profiled. When asked by George Negus how he describes himself politically, Fox replied: \\"I guess, Labor think I'm Liberal, Liberal think I'm Labor, the Catholics think I'm Protestant, the Protestants think I'm Catholic. The local rabbi delivers me matse. So I guess, bottom line, I'm an Australian\\". Fox went on to say: \\"I, traditionally, probably, was brought up in a working-class family where the old man would turn in his grave if he'd thought I'd have voted Liberal. But I must admit, from probably 25 up to the last election, I would have voted Liberal and supported Liberal quite strongly. But I was completely disillusioned by the lack of statesmanship with our Prime Minister with the Ansett debacle. He had an opportunity to be a statesman. Instead he took on a political role and as a result of that, the demise of Ansett came about\\". Following the suicide of his son Michael in 1991, Fox advised the Federal and Victorian governments on youth suicide and is on the board of the National Advisory Council on Suicide Prevention.\\"Youth Suicide Prevention Bulletin\\". Australian Institute of Family Studies. October 2000. In 1992 he was named \\"Victorian Father of the Year\\". In an interview with George Negus in August 2004, Fox spoke of the loss of his son: \\"Well, life is about being up and being down and being able to get up again.

It is located north of the City of Ensenada and southeast of the border crossing from San Diego to Tijuana. It includes communities such as Ejido El Porvenir, Francisco Zarco, San Antonio de las Minas and Colonia Articulo 115, and combined had 5,859 inhabitants according to the 2010 census. ==History== The community was founded in 1834 by Dominican missionary Félix Caballero as Misión de Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe del Norte, making it the last mission established in the Californias. Caballero had to abandon the mission in 1840, under attacks from the indigenous peoples. From 1905–1910, a mixture of Spiritual Christian faiths, mostly Pryguny from Transcaucasia, South Russia, settled in 4 farming colonies near Ensenada, Baja California Norte Territory, Mexico. Guadalupe was the main colony of about 20+ square miles purchased in 1905. Most owned or rented land communally. Not all were ethnic Russians, and were of various folk-Protestant (non-Orthodox) faiths. A few Russian Orthodox immigrants, had no priest or church, lived in Ensenada and were confused with the Spiritual Christians. To make land and loan payments, paid in wheat, the settlers rented as much as 50 square miles from about 10 nearby ranches, north to the border. Most moved to California by World War II to join more prosperous relatives and work in the factories. Some intermarried with Spiritual Christian Dukh-i-zhizniki in California. Most of who remained, intermarried, assimilated and live in Ensenada and Tijuana. When the valley economy shifted to wine-making, the Baja government funded a museum, to preserve the history of the former settlers from Old Russia and enhance wine tourism. Soon two private museums opened, one with a cafe across the street from the state museum, to provide Russian-Mexican dishes for tourists and groups. Roads are improved with asphalt paving to accommodate wine-tour buses. ==Wineries== Vineyard in the valley Since the 1990s the association of winemakers of Baja California holds the Grape Harvest Fiestas in the Valley of Guadalupe and the town of Ensenada every year in August. The celebration includes wine tasting sessions, concerts and soirées, and samplings of regional cuisine and Mexican wines. Wine tasting is available year-round, and several of the wineries have built up-market restaurant/tasting establishments aimed specifically at tourists from the United States. A winery tour is usually included on cruise ships that stop at Ensenada. There are over 100 wineries in the Valle de Guadalupe. Some notable wineries in the area include: * L.A. Cetto * Monte Xanic * Adobe Guadalupe * Las Nubes * Barón Balché * Bodega Santo Thomás * El Cielo * Alximia Vinícola * Trevista * Vena Cava ==Culinary scene== Diego Hernández heads up Corazón de Tierra, rated by William Reed Business Media (the \\"San Pellegrino survey\\") as one of Latin America's 50 best restaurants, while chef Javier Plascencia is present with his Finca de Altozano, and Drew Deckman with Deckman's en el Mogor. The area is a center of Baja Med cuisine. ==Hotels== Hotels of note include chef Javier Plascencia's Finca la Divina, Bruma, a 200-acre eco-resort including a working winery, 2 villas, and a 8-room hotel, and Encuentro Guadalupe (originally from Grupo Habita, now under other management), whose 20 eco-friendly rooms blend in with the landscape. ==References== * 2010 census tables: INEGI ;Specific ==External links== * History of the Valley of Guadalupe and other wine-producing villages. * Pryguny in Baja California, Mexico, by Andrei Conovaloff, Updated: 30 July 2016.

The story was first published in the Danish Anders And & Co. #1999-48; the first American publication was in Uncle Scrooge #334, in October 2004. The Quest for Kalevala is based on the Finnish national epic Kalevala, assembled and partly written by Elias Lönnrot in the 19th century. Rosa's inspiration for the story was a Finnish children's book called Koirien Kalevala (\\"The Canine Kalevala\\") by the Finnish cartoonist Mauri Kunnas, who was himself inspired by the original Kalevala. Part of the story takes place in Helsinki, Finland, depicted in an accurate, realistic way as the city looked in the 1950s, though some buildings pictured weren't built until the 1960s. ==Plot== While going through his trunk full of old mementos and souvenirs, Scrooge discovers a page that he remembers having originally torn from one of Lönnrot's notebooks when they met in Scotland in the late 19th century. His three grandnephews consult their Junior Woodchucks Guidebook and find out that the notes on the page are part of Lönnrot's notes for the Kalevala, revealing the location of the remains of the Sampo. Upon hearing of this mythical machine that can produce grain, salt, and, most particularly, gold out of thin air, Scrooge sets out to find it. The Ducks travel to Helsinki, where the director of the Finnish Literature Society explains Lönnrot's notes to them and the location marked within. The Ducks travel to an island indicated in the notes, where they find Väinämöinen's legendary sword. Touching this sword awakens the spirit of Väinämöinen, which uses the body of whoever touched the sword as its locus of connection to the mortal world. He tells them what happened to the Sampo during the Kalevala times. Väinämöinen's magic brings Gyro Gearloose to the island and, imbued with Seppo Ilmarinen's spirit, he reassembles the Sampo. However, the Sampo doesn't work because it's missing a part that was stolen by Louhi, now residing in the afterlife of Tuonela, the underworld. Scrooge and Donald go to Tuonela to retrieve the missing part. However, after they have left, Louhi becomes aware of the return of her ancient enemy and summons Magica De Spell to help her get the Sampo back. Sailing back to continental Finland, Väinämöinen and the Ducks are able to fix the Sampo. Soon, the machine start producing gold from thin air. However, Magica De Spell and Louhi attack their ship. In the ensuing battle, Louhi manages to steal Väinämöinen's famous kantele, which holds such great power that she loses interest in the Sampo. As the start of her new reign, Louhi summons the sea monster Iku-Turso and orders it to wreak havoc on Helsinki. Donald goes after Iku-Turso to stop it, with the monster and Louhi being confounded by the modern city. In the process, Donald gets the kantele back and is able to lure Iku-Turso back into the sea. With Louhi defeated and his kantele returned, Väinämöinen makes the ship levitate. The Ducks are thrown off the ship, except for Scrooge who clings to Sampo. Väinämöinen invites Scrooge to come to the lands of Kalevala with him as he sees a kindred spirit in Scrooge. Scrooge, however, can't bear to lose his family and friends, so he instead abandons the Sampo. Väinämöinen throws Scrooge off the ship and congratulates him on having made the right choice. ==Notes== *All Kalevala characters speak with the poetic verse Lönnrot used in the original Kalevala. *In the scene where Iku-Turso climbs on top of the Helsinki Cathedral, the Finnish bum's quote \\"That's the second biggest frog I ever saw\\" is a reference to the spy parody show Get Smart. It's also often thought to be a reference to an earlier Don Rosa story with Captain Kentucky, in which the hero of the story has to battle a gigantic frog, but Rosa has denied this.http://nafsk.se/pipermail/dcml/1999-December/005905.html *The notes the old Finnish man plays on his kantele make up the introduction to Finlandia by Jean Sibelius. When Louhi steals Väinämöinen's kantele and flees off to wreak havoc, she plays the opening notes of Ride of the Valkyries by Richard Wagner. *In Finnish hardcover edition, Rosa included an epilogue, where Tuoni (Death) brings Scrooge's hat back from Tuonela. Scrooge asks Tuoni whether it's possible to take his fortune with him when he dies, but after Tuoni asks a price of 50 Finnish markkas (about 8.40 Euro, 10 USD) for the secret, Scrooge asks Donald to kick him out of his office (which Donald does with sufficient strength to separate Tuoni's skull-lijw head from his body). In the version printed in The Don Rosa Library, Tuoni instead asks for a price of 5 USD (about 4.38 Euro, 26.05 Finnish markkas). *Rosa's famous \\"D.U.C.K.\\" (Dedicated to Unca Carl from Keno) can be found in the title panel in the hilt of Väinämöinen's sword, on the mane of one of the horses. *The ermine shown in the first panel, when the Ducks arrive in Korsholm, wears brown fur. This is wrong, because ermines have white fur during the winter. ==ReferencesArticle about The Quest for Kalevala Category:1999 in comics Category:Donald Duck comics by Don Rosa Category:Comics set in Finland Category:Mythology in comics Category:Kalevala Category:Disney comics stories sv:Jakten efter Kalevala ","title":"The Quest for Kalevala"},{"id":"2212304","text":"The Daily World is a Gannett-owned daily newspaper in Opelousas, Louisiana, United States.

When this aim was not forthcoming (and became increasingly undesirable due to the trouble in Congo and the return of most Belgians) CADBA reinvented itself as the MAC, becoming more of an extremist white armed group. A minor movement, it worked with Jeune Europe domestically, as well as the British Union Movement and the Organisation armée secrète in France and was a founder member of the National Party of Europe. == Bibliography == * G.

In 1960 it became the independent Togolese Republic, and the present day nation of Togo. == Transfer from Germany to France and a Mandate territory == French Togoland in pale purple (British Togoland in pale green) French troops landed at Little Popo on August 6, 1914, meeting little resistance. The French proceeded inland, taking the town of Togo on August 8. On August 26, 1914, the German protectorate of Togoland was invaded by French and British forces and fell after five days of brief resistance. The colony surrendered \\"without conditions\\" with British and French troops landing in Kamina on August 27, 1914. The Germans had offered to surrender to the British on terms, to which the British responded a surrender must be unconditional, promising to respect private property, with little interference in trade or private interests and firms. Period news reports suggest the Germans had used expanding bullets during the campaign and had armed native people not under their control, both violations of the Hague Conventions. Togoland was divided into French and British administrative zones in 1916, and following the war, Togoland formally became a League of Nations mandate divided for administrative purposes between France and the United Kingdom. German nationalists in the Weimar Republic were reported to have objected to the seizure of the colony by the French via an interpellation in 1920, expressing their view that it violated Article 22 of the Treaty of Versailles. They also exclaimed via a news release that \\"the German Government naturally leaves nothing undone to prevent an interpretation of the treaty which would justify France's alleged intention.\\" The value of the colony to France was found in the existing railways, permitting a new link to the railway in Dahomey at Atakpamé and the ports of Lome, Segura and Little Popo. After World War II, the mandate became a UN trust territory, still administered by French commissioners. By statute in 1955, French Togoland became an autonomous republic within the French union, although it retained its UN trusteeship status. A legislative assembly elected by universal adult suffrage had considerable power over internal affairs, with an elected executive body headed by a prime minister responsible to the legislature. These changes were embodied in a constitution approved in a 1956 referendum. On September 10, 1956, Nicolas Grunitzky became prime minister of the Autonomous Republic of Togo. However, due to irregularities in the plebiscite, an unsupervised general election was held in 1958 and won by Sylvanus Olympio. On April 27, 1960, in a smooth transition, Togo severed its constitutional ties with France, shed its UN trusteeship status, and became fully independent under a provisional constitution with Olympio as president. ==Governors See also == * List of colonial heads of French Togoland * History of Togo * * * French colonial Empire ==References Further reading == * Category:French West Africa Category:History of Togo Category:History of West Africa French Togoland Togoland, French Togoland Togoland Togoland, French Togoland, French Category:States and territories established in 1916 Category:States and territories disestablished in 1960 Category:1916 establishments in French Togoland Category:1960 disestablishments in Togo Category:1916 establishments in French West Africa Category:1960 disestablishments in the French colonial empire Category:Former polities of the Cold War ","title":"French Togoland"},{"id":"2212332","text":"Jerry O'Neil (born March 28, 1956) is an American retired NASCAR driver from Auburn, New York.

Potage fait d'un coulis de crustacés. Une bisque de homard, d'écrevisses. (Soup made from a crustacean coulis, e.g. lobster or crawfish bisque.) It can be made from lobster, langoustine, crab, shrimp, or crayfish. Alongside chowder, bisque is one of the most popular seafood soups. == Etymology == It is thought the name is derived from Biscay, as in Bay of Biscay, but the crustaceans are certainly bis cuites \\"twice cooked\\" (by analogy to a biscuit) for they are first sautéed lightly in their shells, then simmered in wine and aromatic ingredients, before being strained, followed by the addition of cream. == Method == Bisque is a method of extracting flavor from imperfect crustaceans not good enough to send to market. In an authentic bisque, the shells are ground to a fine paste and added to thicken the soup. Julia Child even remarked, \\"Do not wash anything off until the soup is done because you will be using the same utensils repeatedly and you don't want any marvelous tidbits of flavor losing themselves down the drain.\\" Bisques are thickened with rice, which can either be strained out, leaving behind the starch, or pureed during the final stages. Seafood bisque is traditionally served in a low two-handled cup on a saucer or in a mug. Bisque is also commonly used to refer to cream-based soups that do not contain seafood, in which the sometimes pre-cooked ingredients are pureed or processed in a food processor or a food mill. Common varieties include squash, tomato, mushroom, and red pepper. ==See also== * List of crab dishes * List of cream soups * List of French soups and stews * List of seafood dishes * List of soups == References == Category:French soups Category:Occitan cuisine Category:Seafood dishes Category:Crab dishes Category:Lobster dishes Category:Cream soups Category:National dishes ","title":"Bisque (food)"},{"id":"2212334","text":"Bisque bust of 1883, representing the young John the Baptist Vienna porcelain figure of Joseph II of Austria, c. 1790 Biscuit porcelain, bisque porcelain or bisque is unglazed, white porcelain treated as a final product,“Kaiser Develops A Growing Niche.” Tableware International. 23, No.7, pg.55-56. 1993. with a matte appearance and texture to the touch. It has been widely used in European pottery, mainly for sculptural and decorative objects that are not tableware and so do not need a glaze for protection. The term \\"biscuit\\" refers to any type of fired but unglazed pottery in the course of manufacture, but only in porcelain is it a term for a final product. Unglazed earthenware as a final product is often called terracotta, and in stoneware equivalent unglazed wares (such as jasperware) are often called \\"dry-bodied\\". Many types of pottery, including most porcelain wares, have a glaze applied, either before a single firing, or at the biscuit stage, with a further firing. Small figurines and other decorative pieces have often been made in biscuit, as well as larger portrait busts and other sculptures; the appearance of biscuit is very similar to that of carved and smoothed marble, the traditional prestige material for sculpture in the West. It is hardly used in Chinese porcelain or that of other East Asian countries, but in Europe became very popular for figures in the second half of the 18th century, as Neoclassicism dominated contemporary styles. It was first used at Vincennes porcelain in 1751 by Jean-Jacques Bachelier.Battie, 108; Honey, W.B., Old English Porcelain: A Handbook for Collectors, p. 10, note 1, 1977, 3rd edn. revised by Franklin A. Barrett, Faber and Faber, (Honey says Sevres in 1751, but Vincennes was not moved until 1756) Biscuit figures have to be free from the common small imperfections that a glaze and painted decoration could cover up, and were therefore usually more expensive than glazed ones. They are also more difficult to keep clean. A popular use for biscuit porcelain was the manufacture of bisque dolls in the 19th century, where the porcelain was typically tinted or painted in flesh tones. In the doll world, \\"bisque\\" is usually the term used, rather than \\"biscuit\\".The Getty Art & Architecture Thesaurus has \\"biscuit\\"] but also \\"bisque doll\\". Parian ware is a 19th-century type of biscuit. ==Colour== Although the great majority of biscuit figures (other than dolls) are entirely in white, there are a number of ways of using colour in the technique. Jasperware, developed by Wedgwood in the 1770s and soon very popular all over Europe, is usually classed as stoneware rather than porcelain, but the style of using two contrasting colours of biscuit was sometimes used in porcelain. The Real Fábrica del Buen Retiro in Madrid made a porcelain room in the Casita del Principe, El Escorial decorated with 234 plaques in the style, with a \\"Wedgwood blue\\" ground and the design in white biscuit porcelain in low relief. These were applied as sprigs, meaning that they made separately as thin pieces, and stuck to the main blue body before firing. The plaques are framed like paintings; they were made between 1790 and 1795.\\"Sala de Porcelana de la Casita del Príncipe de El Escorial\\", in Spanish, with pages of images here The figure by the same factory illustrated here uses elements modelled in a coloured paste, and is all biscuit. Biscuit porcelain could also be painted with unfired paint rather than the enamels normal overglaze decoration uses, the lack of a shiny surface giving a strikingly different effect in the best examples. This rare technique is called \\"coloured biscuit\\", and is found from the 19th century onwards. As with 18th-century pieces painted over the glaze, the paint may peel if not well looked after.Battie, 157 illustration; Example in the V&A; A piece could be made with some areas left as biscuit while others are glazed and enamelled in the usual way. A Chelsea-Derby figure of George II of the United Kingdom (1773–74) leaning on a classical plinth and standing on a high base has only the figure in biscuit.British Museum page This part- glazing also occurs in other types of pottery, and for example is very common in the earthenware Chinese Tang dynasty tomb figures.

The film was directed by Claude Chabrol and stars Christophe Malavoy, Mathilda May and Virginie Thévenet. Divorced illustrator Robert spies on a young woman named Juliette whom he envies for her seemingly happy life. When they finally meet and Juliette leaves her fiancé Patrick for Robert, the situation quickly escalates. ==Plot== Parisian illustrator Robert becomes obsessed with a young woman, Juliette. Night after night, Robert sneaks around the house to catch a glimpse of Juliette, until one day he finally gathers the courage to introduce himself. Juliette realizes that she is not happy with her fiancé, Patrick, and leaves him to be with Robert. Robert in turn is not happy with Juliette's obtrusive advances. One night, Patrick attacks Robert in a deserted area; Robert defends himself and knocks Patrick unconscious, leaving him on the shores of a nearby river. The next day, Robert is interrogated by the police. Patrick is missing, and suddenly Robert is the prime suspect. Nobody knows that Patrick has allied with Robert's bitter ex-wife, Véronique, to take revenge on Robert; he is hiding from the police in order to make them think Robert killed him. Robert's professional and private life falls apart after becoming a police suspect. The situation escalates when Juliette commits suicide, and Patrick launches a vendetta against Robert. In a final confrontation between the men, Véronique is accidentally killed, and although Patrick is defeated, Robert is again left as a suspect in an apparent crime scene. ==Cast== * Christophe Malavoy as Robert * Mathilda May as Juliette * Jacques Penot as Patrick * Jean-Pierre Kalfon as Police commissioner * Virginie Thévenet as Véronique * Patrice Kerbrat as Marcello * Jean-Claude Lecas as Jacques * Agnès Denèfle as Suzie * Victor Garrivier as Doctor * Jacques Brunet as Father * Charles Millot as Director * Yvette Petit as Neighbor * Dominique Zardi as Neighbor * Henri Attal as Cop * Albert Dray as Cop * Nadine Hoffmann as Josette * Gérard Croce as Cop * Isabelle Charraix as Mme Tessier * Laurent Picaudon as Boy * Christian Bouvier as Maître d'hôtel * Gilles Dreu as M.

As of October 2009 SBAC merged with the Defence Manufacturers Association and the Association of Police and Public Security Suppliers to form the ADS Group. The SBAC organises the Farnborough Airshow. ==Representation== With its regional partners, SBAC represents over 2,600 companies, assisting them in developing new business globally, facilitating innovation and competitiveness and providing regulatory services in technical standards and accreditation. Inside the organisation is the British Aviation Group and the UK Space Agency. ==HistoryFormation=== On 29 March 1915 a number of British aircraft manufacturers and industrialists met to arrange a standards body and production pooling system known as the Society of British Aircraft Constructors. Notable among the aircraft participants were Herbert Austin, Frederick Handley Page, H.V. Roe of Avro, and E.B. Parker of Short Brothers. The group agreed to share their designs among a variety of 3rd party factories in order to be able to quickly produce new designs on demand. These factories joined ones being run by the government directly. In total over 40 companies joined the group when it officially formed on 23 March 1916. ===Aircraft inspection=== In the post-war era the group expanded to include almost every aircraft company and those related to it—engine manufacturers, metal alloy companies, etc. Since this period they have often been referred to by acronym, SBAC. They were also instrumental in approaching Lloyd's of London to start the inspection and insurance of aircraft, which led to increased commercial aviation. ===Trade and Air shows=== In 1932 the group hosted a one- day air show and trade fair at the Hendon airfield in London on 19 June, the day after the annual RAF Hendon display. Similar one-day events were held for the next three years, but 1935 was the last Hendon RAF display. The SBAC show moved to de Havilland's Hatfield airfield in 1936 and 1937; the latter was both the first two-day SBAC show and the last before World War II. Immediately after the War it was held at Radlett, the home of Handley Page on 12–13 September, and early September became the regular date. In 1947 the show was again at Radlett with three flying days. In 1948 the meeting was moved to the Royal Aircraft Establishment at Farnborough and was six days long with three flying days, setting the pattern for the future. The Farnborough shows were held annually as trade fairs for British manufacturers and with two public days, the Saturday and Sunday, throughout the 1950s. Crowds were large: on the last day, the Sunday of the 1954 show some 160,000 people attended. In 1962 the British-only rule was slightly relaxed by allowing the participation of foreign aircraft with British engines. 1962 was also the last of the annual shows, the next being held in 1964 and thenceforth biennially; in 1968 European manufacturers were invited. In 1974 the show accepted international participation and from 1978 it became known as the Farnborough International. Since 1964 the Farnborough has alternated with the Paris Air Show. ===Name change=== The name changed from \\"Society of British Aircraft Constructors\\" to \\"Society of British Aerospace Companies\\" in 1964. ==Affiliated organisations== SBAC Scotland was formed in 2005. ==SBAC aircraft designations== After WWII the SBAC introduced a designation system for British aircraft consisting of a two letter manufacturer code followed by a sequence number, with designations allocated as follows:- ===Blackburn Aircraft=== * Blackburn Y.A.1 The Blackburn B-48 Firecrest to Air Ministry Specification S.28/43. * Blackburn Y.A.2 Design study only. * Blackburn Y.A.3 Design study only. * Blackburn Y.A.4 B-55 project for a Rolls-Royce Dart powered 24-seat commercial aircraft. * Blackburn Y.A.5 Blackburn B-54 anti-submarine two-seater to Specification GR.17/45 with Napier Double Nomad. * Blackburn Y.A.6 B-62 project for a Blackburn Firecrest with Armstrong Siddeley Python engine. * Blackburn Y.A.7 Two-seater Y.A.5 with Rolls-Royce Griffon 56. * Blackburn Y.A.8 Three-seater Y.A.5 with RR Griffon 56. * Blackburn Y.A.9 The 1947 B-75 feeder-liner with two Blackburn Cirrus Majors or Blackburn Cirrus Bombardiers. * Blackburn Y.B.1 Blackburn B-54 -

It is named for J. R. Simon who first published the effect in the late 1960s. Simon's original explanation for the effect was that there is an innate tendency to respond toward the source of stimulation. According to the simple models of information processing that existed at the time, there are three stages of processing: stimulus identification, response selection, and response execution or the motor stage. The Simon Effect is generally thought to involve interference which occurs in the response-selection stage. This is similar to, yet distinct from, the interference that produces the better-known Stroop effect. == Original experiment == In Simon's original study, two lights (the stimulus) were placed on a rotating circular panel. This device would be rotated at varying degrees (away from the horizontal plane). Simon wished to see if an alteration of the spatial relationship, relative to the response keys, affected performance. Age was also a probable factor in reaction time. As predicted the reaction time of the groups increased based on the relative position of the light stimulus (age was not a factor). The reaction time increased by as much as 30%. (Simon & Wolf, 1963). However, what is usually seen as the first genuine demonstration of the effect that became known as the Simon effect is by Simon & Rudell (1967). Here, they had participants respond to the words \\"left\\" and \\"right\\" that were randomly presented to the left or right ear. Although the auditory location was completely irrelevant to the task, participants showed marked increases in reaction latency if the location of the stimulus was not the same as the required response (if, for example, they were to react left to a word that was presented in the right ear). == Method == A typical demonstration of the Simon effect involves placing a participant in front of a computer monitor and a panel with two buttons on it, which he or she may press. The participant is told that they should press the button on the right when they see something red appear on the screen, and the button on the left when they see something green. Participants are usually told to ignore the location of the stimulus and base their response on the task-relevant color. Participants typically react faster to red lights that appear on the right hand side of the screen by pressing the button on the right of their panel (congruent trials). Reaction times are typically slower when the red stimulus appears on the left hand side of the screen and the participant must push the button on the right of their panel (incongruent trials). The same, but vice versa, is true for the green stimuli. This happens despite the fact that the position of the stimulus on the screen relative to the physical position of the buttons on the panel is irrelevant to the task and not correlated with which response is correct. The task, after all, requires the subject to note only the colour of the object (i.e., red or green) by pushing the corresponding button, and not its position on the screen. == Explanation == According to Simon himself (1969), the location of the stimulus, although irrelevant to the task, directly influences response-selection due to an automatic tendency to 'react towards the source of the stimulation'. Although other accounts have been suggested (cf. Hommel, 1993), explanations for the Simon effect generally refer back to the interference that occurs in the response-selection stage of decision making. Neurologically there could be involvement of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, as well as the Anterior cingulate cortex, which is thought to be responsible for conflict monitoring. The Simon Effect shows that location information cannot be ignored and will affect decision making, even if the participant knows that the information is irrelevant. Logical argument for response selection: The challenge in the Simon effect is said to occur during the response selection stage of judgment. This is due to two factors which eliminate the stimulus identification stage and the execution state. In the stimulus identification stage the participant only needs to be cognitively aware that a stimulus is present. An error would not occur at this stage unless he or she were visually impaired or had some sort of stimulus deficit. As well, an error or delay cannot occur during the execution state because an action has already been decided upon in the previous stage (the response selection stage) and no further decision making takes place (i.e. you cannot make a change to your response without going back to the second stage). == Practical implications == A knowledge of the Simon effect is useful in the design of human-machine interfaces. Aircraft cockpits, for example, require a person to react quickly to a situation. If a pilot is flying a plane and there is a problem with the left engine, an aircraft with a good human-machine interface design (which most have) would position the indicator light for the left engine to the left of the indicator light for the right engine. This interface would display information in a way that matches the types of responses that people should make. If it were the other way around, the pilot might be more likely to respond incorrectly and adjust the wrong engine. == References == * Simon, J. R., and Wolf, J. D. (1963).

It is also the name of the local castle, Nürburg Castle, which was built in the High Middle Ages. The name is derived from Latin niger, meaning \\"black\\", and High German burg, meaning \\"castle\\". The castle is made of basalt which usually has black color. The well-known racing track Nürburgring is nearby. == Location == The Nürburg rises above the village of the same name on the second-highest hill in the Eifel (). The castle and hill are regarded as a characteristic feature of the Eifel. Even though it is one of the most significant castles in the Eifel, it nevertheless still needs to be researched in full. There are almost no written sources relating to the history of the castle's construction in the Middle Ages. The hill is referred to in documentary evidence in 954 by the name mone nore, which means black hill. In descriptions of boundaries which served to clarify which property belonged to whom, it was used as a significant reference marker. The name Nürburg is thought to derive from mons nore, as the color of the volcanic basalt used to build the castle exhibits an unusually dark color. The Nürburg is considered to be the \\"highest castle in Rhineland-Palatinate\\", and on a clear day, the spires of Cologne Cathedral may be seen. == History  Prehistory and Middle Ages === The history of when the Nürburg was established has not been definitively clarified. There is no evidence to suggest that it was built instead of a Roman fort, the commonly held view in the local area. Discoveries of Roman coins do not constitute sufficient evidence. Owing to a similarity between names, one legend even traces the Nürburg back to a fort established by Emperor Nero. Among other things, archaeological barrows attest to the fact that the area surrounding the castle was populated in early historical times. However, there are no indications that the castle hill was once home to a refuge or prehistoric walled fortification, as is occasionally thought. While local historians held the view that the castle had been erected by Theoderich I, Count of Are, (who died in 1132) as a refuge for the ruling court of Adenau, nowadays his son Ulrich von Are, the self-proclaimed Count of Nürburg, is considered to be the person responsible for commissioning the building of the castle, even though there is no source material to back this theory. Castle Are is situated above Altenahr, and was built by a group of counts, probably the Ahrgau counts. The group was associated with the Carolingian nobility and named itself after it. The Nürburg is situated south of Castle Are, where the Counts of Are belonged to a family circle whose members can be traced back to the 9th century. In the 10th century, they are alleged to have held rights in what would subsequently become the village of Nürburg. The counts were able to build up an independent power base within the High Eifel and at the upper Ahr and this power base was centered between Adenau, Nürburg, and Altenahr. The counts were divided up between several ancestral lines: the Are-Hochstaden line held the property in the village of Nürburg. Around 1220/30, a different ancestral line built Neuenahr Castle. With the death of Count Lothar in around 1246, the Counts of Are-Hochstaden died out. Their estate was inherited by the Archbishop of Cologne (Konrad von Are-Hochstaden). Count Ulrich von Nürburg first appears in documents linking him to the Nürburg in 1169. He is considered to be the person responsible for commissioning the building of the castle. There is a document originating from 1166 in which Are and Nürburg Castles are mentioned within the context of rights which the Archbishop of Cologne granted to Count Ulrich and his family. At that time, the castle was an open house of the Archbishop of Cologne: the opening right affording him access to the castle and the option to use it if he needed to. In those days, the counts of Are-Nürburg were supporters of the Staufian imperial family. === Modern Age === Historians suspected that the officials who were pledged the use of the castle from the 14–16th century were more concerned with exploiting the castle than with preserving it. This was reflected in the large amount of damage that Augustin von Braunsberg noted when he financed its repair in 1534. According to his report, Augustin had the gate to the valley re-erected and had a stable built in the courtyard. A storm had also torn off the roof of the main tower and damaged the vaults within. In order to prevent its total collapse, the tower was reconstructed in 1535. Augustin also financed the construction of a brewery, cowshed, meat house, and bakery within the walls. In 1587, the castle was plundered by Dutch soldiers. There are also reports from the early 17th century outlining the damage to, and decline of the castle. An occupation in 1605 by southern European soldiers caused significant damage. The soldiers removed the lead bracing in the main tower leaving it in a perilous state of near collapse. In 1607, funds were raised by the local archiepiscopal commission, and restoration work carried out in 1612, where 77 windows were installed to make the castle more livable. However, that same year, a severe storm tore the chimneys and roofs off some of the buildings leaving the castle in a nearly ruined state. In 1633, during Thirty Years' War, the castle was occupied by Swedish troops as a defensible position, and by 1656, the castle fell into a state of near uninhabitability. Despite the crumbling walls, the castle was still seen an important military site due to its high position and relative ease of defense. In 1752, the main tower of Castle Nürburg was used as a prison until the dungeons fell into a state of total ruin. From this point, the castle was abandoned and left to decay, as farmers in the area continued to remove stones from the site for use as local building material. The Burgstube hotel at the base of the castle evidences some of this pirating of the stone in its foundation that dates to the 17th century. The Franciscan friars from Adenau issued a decree from Adenau to take as much stone as they needed in order to repair their convent. Drawings from the late 18th century show the castle as a complete ruin. In 1792, the French occupied the left side of the Rhine, and in 1801, the French army destroyed the remaining portions of the outer wall, leaving only the inner wall, and the main tower standing to attest to what was the Nürburg. Restoration work started in 1846–78 where the main tower was renewed. A stone staircase was built into the tower, with the uppermost vault being reconstructed in order to provide views over the entire High Eifel. In 1871, the inner wall and main gate were completely reconstructed into the form seen today, complete with non-original fairytale style conical tops on the wall towers. In 1953–71, the castle was transferred to the administration of the Rhineland-Palatinate. As money poured into Nürburg for repair and expansion projects to the Nürburgring, extensive work was again carried out on the castle. The walls of the wards were rebuilt, and the shoring up of the towers completed in order to make the castle safe for tourists. == Climate == Nürburg has a semi-continental climate with both oceanic and continental tendencies. It does however land in the former category (Köppen Cfb). With regards to the racetrack, due to the Nordschleife's varied terrain and elevation, weather may be completely different on either end of the track. The elevation shift also makes thermal differences a strong possibility. The modern Grand Prix circuit also has sizeable elevation changes between the start-finish straight and the lowest point on the opposite end of the track, but the geographical distance and actual elevation gain between the two are lower. Annual sunshine is in the 1500s, which is low by European standards, but sunnier than the nearest large city of Cologne. Contrasting that, Nürburg has cooler weather year-round due to the higher elevation of the Eifel Mountains than the Rhine Valley. == Gallery == Nürburg 11010026.jpgNürburg Castle entry Nurburgring lap.jpgThe nearby Nürburgring race track == References  External links == * * Category:Ahrweiler (district) Category:Counties of the Holy Roman Empire ","title":"Nürburg"},{"id":"2212420","text":"Menez or Ménez is a surname, and may refer to; Menez means mount or mountain in Breton. * Maria Inês Ribeiro da Fonseca a.k.a.

However he rejected the participation of the MSI in elections, preferring to take the battle to the streets. He left the MSI in 1958. After participating to the foundation of the Centri Studi Ordine Nuovo with members of the MSI, he created the small Gruppi di Azione Rivoluzionari (GAR) at the end of the 1950s. Involved in various political actions, such as protesting against Eisenhower's visit to Italy or fighting against Italian Communist Party members, he already maintained close international links, notably with the Austrian Konrad Windisch, leader of the neo-Nazi Kameradschaftsring Nationaler Jugendverbände (KNJ). He then formed, in 1960, the National Vanguard (\\"Avanguardia Nazionale\\") as a street-fighting group. Around this time, he also became a member of the secret P2 Masonic Lodge. From 1962 to 1964 he was employed by the tasked with infiltrating in and breaking up left-wing demonstrations.

The movement had limited success at the national parliamentary election 1992 in Italy. ==Activity in South America== Stefano Delle Chiaie was described by the CIA as being the most wanted rightist terrorist in 1983, was suspected of a lot of irregular activity, but was always acquitted on appeal. In the course of his activities Delle Chiaie was also known by a number of aliases, including Er Caccola, Alfa, Topigigio and Alfredo Di Stéfano, after the celebrated footballer of the same name. Delle Chiaie has since spent most of his time working in Latin America. Stefano Delle Chiaie took part in Yves Guérin-Sérac's \\"Aginter Press\\" founded in António de Oliveira Salazar's Portugal in 1965. As cited in The Fourth Reich: Klaus Barbie and the Neo-Fascist Connection, by Magnus Linklater, Isabel Hilton, and Neal Ascherson, Delle Chiaie was one of the orchestrators of the \\"Cocaine Coup\\" in Bolivia, along with the German war criminal Klaus Barbie, that brought General Luis García Meza to power in the early 1980s.

His international activities started early. He first took part in Yves Guérin-Sérac's \\"Aginter Press\\", founded in Salazar's Portugal in 1965. After assisting Borghese during his 1970 attempted coup in Italy, he escaped to Franquist Spain -- as would Vincenzo Vinciguerra -- and met with future members of the GAL paramilitary group. He was then present at the June 20, 1973 Ezeiza massacre in Argentina,Sorin, Sergio. \\"Las Relaciones Secretas Entre Pinochet, Franco y la P2: Conspiración Para Matar\\". Nizkor Project, February 4, 1999. and then met with US-born DINA agent Michael Townley in 1975 to prepare Chilean Christian Democrat Bernardo Leighton's failed assassination. In 1976, he participated in the Montejurra Incidents against left-wing Carlists in Spain, before leaving for Latin America. In South America, he took part in the 'Cocaine Coup' of Luis García Meza Tejada, when a notoriously corrupt military regime forced its way to power in Bolivia in 1980, with assistance from the Argentine SIDE which had been called on for 70 foreign agents. He later worked for the new government in training its soldiers. Stefano Delle Chiaie later declared in a 1983 interview to a Spanish reporter: > I was decided to give my hand to the creation of an international > revolutionary movement... Therefore, when the opportunity of a national > revolution appeared in Bolivia, we were there to shoulder our comrades. We > were neither repressors nor narco-terrorists, but political > militants.Hearing of Stefano Delle Chiaie on 22 July 1997 before the Italian > Parliamentary Commission on Terrorism. Headed by Senator Giovanni > Pellegrino. Judge Baltazar Garzón's investigations demonstrated that he had worked both for Pinochet's political police, the DINA, for the Argentine Anticommunist Alliance (Triple A) and for Hugo Banzer's dictatorship in Bolivia. Delle Chiaie had met in Madrid with Pinochet during Franco's funeral in 1975, beginning his involvement with the Chilean regime and his part in Operation Condor. According to lawyer Alun Jones, representative of the Spanish justice during Spain's request to Great Britain for the extradition of Augusto Pinochet, Pinochet met with Delle Chiaie in Madrid to plan an attack against Carlos Altamirano, the leader of the Chilean Socialist Party. The plan failed, either because of Altamirano's awareness and personal caution, or because some intelligence agency -- it is not known from which country -- may have made him aware of the threats on his personal life. According to Le Monde diplomatique, Delle Chiaie met with Abdullah Çatlı in Latin America and during a visit of the Turkish \\"Grey Wolves\\" member in Miami in September 1982. Abdullah Çatlı \\"is reckoned to have been one of the main perpetrators of underground operations carried out by the Turkish branch of the Gladio organisation and had played a key role in the bloody events of the period 1976-80 which paved the way for the military coup d'état of September 1980.Nezan, Kendal. \\"Turkey’s Pivotal Role in the International Drug Trade\\". Le Monde diplomatique, July 1998. During a 1997 hearing before the Commission on terrorism headed by senator Giovanni Pellegrino, Stefano Delle Chiaie went on speaking about a \\"black fascist International\\" and his hopes of creating the conditions of an \\"international revolution.\\" He talked about the World Anticommunist League, but said that after attending a meeting in Paraguay, he left it. He claimed that the latter was a front for the CIA. He only admitted having taken part in the New European Order (NOE) organization, and denied having worked with the International Anticommunist Alliance around 1974. According to CIA documents, in Madrid, Stefano Delle Chiaie also met with Michael Townley, a DINA agent, and Virgilio Paz Romero, a Cuban based in Miami, with connections in Chile, to prepare, with the help of Franco's secret police, the murder of Bernardo Leighton, a Chilean Christian Democrat. On 6 October 1975 Leighton and his wife were severely injured by gunshots while in exile in Rome.Kornbluh, Peter. \\"Chile and the United States: Declassified Documents Relating to the Military Coup, September 11, 1973\\".

Delle Chiaie, along with fellow neo-fascist Vincenzo Vinciguerra, also testified in Rome in December 1995 before judge María Servini de Cubría that Enrique Arancibia Clavel (a former Chilean secret police agent prosecuted for crimes against humanity in 2004 Gotkine, Elliot. \\"Vital Rights Ruling in Argentina\\".

In Canada, the title paramedic generally refers to those who work on land ambulances or air ambulances providing paramedic services. Paramedics are increasingly being utilized in hospitals, emergency rooms, clinics and community health care services by providing care under the direction of physicians, physician assistants and nurse practitioners or in collaboration with registered nurses, registered/licensed practical nurses and registered respiratory therapists. ==Types of paramedics and emergency medical responders== In Canada the scope of practice of paramedics and emergency medical responders is described by the National Occupational Competency Profile (NOCP) document which was developed by the Paramedic Association of Canada with financial support from the Government of Canada. The NOCP outlines three paramedic provider levels and one emergency medical responder level, with a total of four providers level: Emergency Medical Responder (EMR), Primary Care Paramedic (PCP), Advanced Care Paramedic (ACP), and Critical Care Paramedic (CCP) === National occupational competency profile (NOCP) === There is a considerable degree to inter-provincial variations on paramedic and emergency medical responder practice across Canada. To address this there is a national consensus of paramedic and emergency medical responder practice (by way of the National Occupational Competency Profile) identifies the knowledge, skills, and abilities as being most synonymous with a given level of paramedic or emergency medical responder practice. Each province retains ultimate authority in legislating the actual administration and delivery of paramedicine and its services within its own respective jurisdictions. Specific paramedic regulatory frameworks and practice is established uniquely in each of the provinces legislature and statute and varies across Canada. Titles of paramedics may vary between provinces. For example, in Ontario, primary care paramedics post the graduation of an approved primary care paramedic education program and upon successful completion of the provincial examination process are awarded the title of Advanced Emergency Medical Care Assistant (AEMCA). The National Occupational Competency Profile (NOCP) outlines four different competencies. The Competencies in the NOCP are described using a hierarchy of terms: competency area, general competency, specific competency and sub-competency. The framework includes the following eight master categories of paramedics and emergency medical responders: professional responsibilities, communication, health and safety, assessment and diagnostics, therapeutics, integration, transportation and health promotion and public safety. https://www.paramedic.ca/uploaded/web/documents/2011-10-31-Approved-NOCP- English-Master.pdf === Emergency medical responder (EMR) === This is a level of practice recognized under the National Occupational Competency Profile and the Paramedic Association of Canada. Inherently by their title, EMRs are not paramedics, however, provide support to the paramedic system. EMRs staff rural ambulance stations, patient transfer services, community medical event coverage, industrial ambulances or mobile treatment centres. For many small communities, without this level of certification, the operation of a much- needed rural and remote community ambulance services might not be as feasible. EMRs working as first responders in fire departments, police departments and institutions across Canada contribute an important role in the chain of survival. It is a level of practice focused primarily on life saving methods and is generally consistent with fewer acts beyond advanced first-aid. The EMR's scope of practices include oxygen administration, oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal airway adjuncts, the use and interpretation of a pulse oximeter, use and interpretation of a glucometer, blood pressure assessment by auscultation and palpation, chest auscultation, oropharyngeal airway suctioning, administration of the following oral, sublingual or inhaled medications: anti-anginal, anti-hypoglycemic agent, analgesia, platelet inhibitors (including nitroglycerin, glucose, nitrous oxide, acetylsalicylic acid, salbutamol, intravenous lines without medications or blood products). EMRs may administer naloxone and epinephrine by generally an auto-injector. === Primary care paramedic (PCP) === Primary care paramedics (PCPs) are the entry level of paramedic practice across Canada. The scope of practice includes performing semi-automated external defibrillation, manual defibrillation, oxygen administration, ETCO2 monitoring, supraglottic airways, vascular access, cardiac monitoring such as Lead 2 interpretation and 12 Lead acquisition and interpretation, and administration of Symptom Relief Medications for a variety of emergency medical conditions (these include epinephrine, salbutamol, aspirin, nitroglycerine, naloxone, dextrose, glucagon, gravol, ketorolac, ibuprofen, acetaminophen, benadryl). PCPs may also receive additional authorization in order to perform certain skills that are normally in the scope of practice of ACPs. === Advanced care paramedic (ACP) === The Advanced Care Paramedic is a level of practitioner that is in high demand by many services across Canada. The ACP typically carries approximately 20 different medications, although the number and type of medications may vary substantially from region to region. ACPs perform advanced airway management including intubation, surgical airways, intravenous therapy, place external jugular IV lines, perform needle thoracostomy, perform and interpret 12-lead ECGs, perform synchronized and chemical cardioversion, transcutaneous pacing, perform obstetrical assessments, and provide pharmacological pain relief for various conditions. Several sites in Canada have adopted pre-hospital fibrinolytics and rapid sequence induction, and prehospital medical research has permitted a great number of variations in the scope of practice for ACPs. Current bypass protocols include providing both PCPs and ACPs with discretionary direct 24-hour access to PCI labs, bypassing the emergency department, and representing a fundamental change in both the way that patients with S-T segment elevation myocardial infarctions (STEMI) are treated, but also profoundly affecting survival rates. as well as bypassing a closer hospitals to get an identified stroke patient to a stroke centre. == Paramedicine training overview == Paramedic education, or the study of paramedicine in Canada, involves post-secondary education provided by a college (Canada) or university or similar academic institution. Uniquely some programs may be offered collaboratively and shared between both academic institutions. The education provided is in the theories of paramedicine and its practice and in related subjects areas such as but not limited to anatomy, physiology, psychology, cardiology, pharmacology, pathology, communications, ethics, research, emergency medicine theory and practical skills. Theoretical and practical training is in combination of both in hospital and pre-hospital emergency medicine clinical experiences. The didactic and clinical components of the programs may vary from province to province across Canada. === Primary care paramedic training in the western provinces === Primary care paramedicine education may be a one year primary care paramedicine certificate to two year primary care paramedicine diploma program in the province of British Columbia, https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/health/about-bc-s-health-care-system/heath- care-partners/colleges-board-and-commissions/emergency-medical-assistants- licensing-board/emalbrecognizedtrainingprograms.pdf Saskatchewan https://www.collegeofparamedics.sk.ca/licensing/initial-licence/ and Manitoba https://www.gov.mb.ca/health/ems/licensing/2/2.4.a.html. Alberta provides a one year primary care paramedicine certificate and a four year baccalaureate paramedicine degree. https://abparamedics.com/approved- programs/#1502816037130-5c7d6d9a-9427 === Primary care paramedicine training in Ontario === Ontario provides a two year primary care paramedicine diploma program http://www.health.gov.on.ca/en/pro/programs/emergency_health/edu/schools.aspx and will be transitioning to a three year primary care paramedicine Ontario College Advanced Diploma in the fall of 2021. Ontario also provides a four year paramedicine baccalaureate degree. === Primary care paramedicine training in Quebec === Paramedicine training in the province of Quebec has been standardized and now requires all new paramedics to hold a three-year Diploma of College Studies in Emergency Prehospital Care, or Soins préhospitaliers d'urgence (SPU) in French, from a recognized CEGEP (college) program https://www.urgences-sante.qc.ca/carrieres/devenir-technicien-ambulancier- paramedic/ou-obtenir-la-formation/. Upon completion of this diploma and successful completion of the provincial examination, one is certified at the level of primary care paramedic (PCP). === Primary care paramedicine training in the maritime provinces === Nova Scotia https://www.hollandcollege.com/programs/primary-care-paramedicine.html, New Brunswick https://oultoncollege.com/primary-care-paramedic/, Newfoundland and Labrador https://www.cna.nl.ca/program/primary-care-paramedicine have a two year primary care paramedicine diploma program. Prince Edward Island provides a two year primary care paramedicine diploma program or four year baccalaureate paramedicine degree. https://www.paramedicassociationpei.com/paramedic-education === Advanced care paramedicine training in Canada === Training as an advanced care paramedic (ACP) requires that the student be first registered as a primary care paramedic. The length of time required to complete the ACP graduate program also varies between provinces, and it is generally inversely related to the length of time required to have completed the prerequisite PCP training. Shorter primary care paramedicine programs (around one to two years) would require an additional minimum of two years of advanced care paramedicine graduate study. Graduates of longer primary care paramedicine programs (two to four years) would require an additional minimum of one year of graduate advanced care paramedicine study. In Quebec since 2015, a formal 2-year advanced care paramedic (ACP) training program was developed at Université de Montréal for experienced PCPs from Urgences-santé. https://admission.umontreal.ca/soins-prehospitaliers/ === University paramedicine training === There are three university Bachelor of Science in Paramedicine degree programs currently available in Canada. These programs are increasingly becoming the standard of paramedic education as the profession progresses. This would be comparable to when nursing moved from the college based program to the collaborative or university based program in Canada. https://www.casn.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/History.pdf These programs are often offered through partnerships between Canadian universities and colleges to enhance theory and practical training with higher education. These programs also allow bridging for registered paramedics to complete the degree program in a shorter, accelerated format. These programs currently are available in Ontario https://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/admissions/programs/paramedicine-joint- centennial, Alberta https://www.mhc.ab.ca/ProgramsandCourses/Academic- Programs/Programs-of-Study/Paramedic and Prince Edward Island https://www.upei.ca/programs/paramedicine. === Paramedic education accreditation === The accreditation of paramedic educational programs in Canada also varies from province to province. Primarily the regulatory body for paramedicine of their respective provinces reserves the right to approve of paramedic programs. Nationally, Accreditation Canada offers the most comprehensive and best known system of national accreditation for paramedics. https://accreditation.ca/health-education-accreditation/programs/ Previously, the Canadian Medical Association accredited paramedic training programs. This accreditation model was phased out by the Canadian Medical Association. The CMA only continues to accredit physician and physician assistant education programs. https://www.cma.ca/committee-accreditation-cacms The accreditation model of Accreditation Canada is an independent body, and draws from The national occupational competency profile (NOCP) as the benchmark document that details the knowledge, skills and abilities outcomes that must be possessed by paramedics or EMRs of each respective level of paramedic or EMR practice. https://www.paramedic.ca/site/nocp ==Specialized paramedics== Training for specialization as a paramedic is most often provided by employers who select paramedics that have gone through an internal competition. There are very few specialization education programs open to the public currently. Most specializations require the applicant to already be an experienced advanced care paramedic. === Critical care paramedic (CCP) === A Critical Care Paramedic ambulance in Toronto Critical care paramedics' expertise focus on critical and ICU level care, stabilizing and transporting patients from smaller hospitals with less available resources to tertiary care, and regional medical programs in to other hospitals that can provide a higher level of care. CCPs generally work with another CCP, ACP, registered nurse or under the direction of a physician, physician assistant or nurse practitioner. Sometimes ad hoc teams, with multiple practitioners (RTs, emergency physicians, physician assistants, surgeons, etc.) are assembled for certain patients. CCPs are able to provide all of the care that PCPs and ACPs provide. In addition to this they are trained for other skills such as medication infusion pumps, mechanical ventilation and arterial line monitoring. CCPs often work in fixed and rotary wing aircraft when the weather permits and staff are available, but systems such as the Toronto EMS Critical Care Transport Program work in land ambulances. ORNGE Transport operates both land and aircraft in Ontario. In British Columbia, CCP's work primarily in aircraft with a dedicated Critical Care Transport crew in several cities for long-distance/high acuity transfers and as regular CCP street crews who may do major trauma calls or, performs medevacs, when necessary. Across the prairies, STARS Shock Trauma Air Rescue Society uses rotary wing aircraft to reach many in isolated communities and traumatic situations for faster response time than by ground ambulance. In Saskatchewan they also use fixed wing air ambulances. The service, called LIFEGUARD, can respond a greater distance and to more northern communities than STARS. Sask air ambulance service was the first non-military air ambulance service in the world. These air ambulances are crewed by Flight Nurses and CCPs. === Tactical paramedic === Tactical paramedics are specialized paramedics who undergo additional training to allow them to perform their usual task in a high risk and dangerous scenario. Some are trained to handle weapons, rappel from buildings and other skills needed to work alongside tactical police units. These paramedics are required to wear protective gear but are usually unarmed in civilian environments. === Occupational paramedic === Occupational paramedic responsibilities may include providing pre-employment screening, medical surveillance services and clinical testing for companies and research institutions. Occupational paramedics may work in a variety of environments including in a clinical setting or in the field including mining sites, oil rigs or other high risk areas. Occupational paramedics may work under the direction of occupational physicians, physician assistants and nurse practitioners. Occupational paramedics may also work collaboratively with registered nurses and registered/licensed practical nurses in the field or may work alone with clinical supports available from electronic means. === Community paramedic === One of the more recent roles for paramedics in Canada is the community paramedic. These specialized paramedics work in clinics, hospitals, and in patient's homes. They provide immediate or scheduled primary, urgent and specialized healthcare to vulnerable patient populations by collaborating with other healthcare providers, conducting assessments, treating, and doing/ordering tests. Diagnostics provided by community paramedics include: specimen collection (blood, urine, swabs), electrocardiogram interpretation, vital signs, and facilitate transports for diagnostic imaging. Treatments provided by community paramedics include: fluid rehydration, blood transfusions, urinary catheterization, wound closure & care (tissue adhesive, sutures, dressings), oxygen and nebulizer therapy, medication administration, and coordination of community services. In Saskatchewan, paramedics may become endorsed as community paramedics by the Saskatchewan College of Paramedics upon the completion of an accredited community paramedicine program. https://www.collegeofparamedics.sk.ca/licensing/initial-licence/licence- endorsements/ === Incident response paramedic === Incident response paramedics receive intensive training, including toxicology, hazmat chemistry, National Fire Protection Association hazmat awareness and operations certifications, as well as three weeks of CBRNE training, antidote, medical countermeasures, MCI, and protective equipment training. For day-to-day operations, incident response paramedics respond to hazmat- and toxicology-related incidents. These paramedics may carry a unique range of medications than and more protective equipment, allowing them to better treat poisonings/overdoses and work closely with firefighters and hazmat technicians. == Regulation of the paramedicine profession == Paramedics across Canada have various formats for regulation. Paramedics in all provinces are regulated by provincial legislation and regulations directly by government, or rather by a designated regulatory college where each paramedic regardless of level has an independent license to practice and is solely responsible for their paramedic practice. These organizations are responsible to the government for the examination and licensing of paramedics, the establishment of standards of practice, the investigation of public complaints against members, and the disciplining of members. They are also required to advise the government on all issues and legislation related to the practice of their members. Many Canadian paramedics are currently advocating to empower government to work towards becoming a self-regulated health profession. Paramedics are forming their own professional regulatory college in much of the same manner as physicians, nurses, respiratory therapists and other health professions. === New Bunswick paramedic regulation === In the province of New Brunswick, paramedics are regulated by the Paramedic Association of New Brunswick. http://www.panb.ca/about-us/ === Nova Scotia paramedic regulation === In the province of Nova Scotia, paramedics are regulated by the College of Paramedics of Nova Scotia. https://www.cpns.ca/ === Saskatchewan paramedic regulation === In the province of Saskatchewan, paramedics are regulated by the Saskatchewan college of paramedics. https://www.collegeofparamedics.sk.ca/ === Manitoba paramedic regulation === In the province of Manitoba, paramedics are currently transitioning to the regulator the College of Paramedics of Manitoba. https://www.collegeparamb.ca/ === Alberta paramedic regulation === In the province of Alberta, paramedics and emergency medical responders are regulated by the Alberta College of Paramedics. https://abparamedics.com/ === Ontario paramedic regulation === In Ontario, paramedics are regulated through two mechanisms in which the Ambulance Act https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/90a19 indirectly regulates paramedicine. The Ministry of Health (Ontario), Emergency Health Services Branch, credentials successful graduates of paramedic programs which have completed the provincial paramedic examination as maintained and administered by the ministry. The ministry can also revocate paramedic credentials from currently practising paramedics. The ministry additionally maintains the provincial standards and medical directives expected of all paramedics in Ontario. The second mechanism of regulation is by a designated base hospital which grants paramedics the legal authority to practice. Paramedics are permitted to perform controlled medical acts https://www.cpso.on.ca/Physicians/Policies- Guidance/Policies/Delegation-of-Controlled-Acts by the process of 'delegation'. This means that one physician, known as the medical director, has become familiar with the individual paramedic and then has delegated authority to that paramedic which allows them to perform specific regulated medical act under defined situations. The scope of practice for the paramedic is defined in paramedic protocols established by the Ministry of Health (Ontario) (also referred to as medical directives). These directives specify which skill and the conditions required for the paramedic to act. Each directive is signed by the medical director. Medical directors are generally emergency medicine specialized physicians who work in a hospital associated with the paramedic service. The relationship between this hospital ('Base Hospital') is formalized through legal agreements. Other physicians in the base hospital who are allowed to give direct orders to paramedics that exceed their protocols (often via telephone) are referred to as delegating physicians. These physicians are usually emergency medicine specialized physicians. In Ontario, paramedics are actively advocating for some form of self-regulation to remove the multiple layers and complexities of regulation and paramedic practice. https://www.ontarioparamedic.ca/self-regulation/ === British Columbia paramedic regulation === In British Columbia, The Emergency Health Services Act directly regulates paramedicine. This act requires emergency medical assistants (paramedics) working in British Columbia to be licensed by the Emergency Medical Assistants Licensing Board. https://www.bclaws.ca/civix/document/id/complete/statreg/96182_01 === Prince Edward Island paramedic regulation === In Prince Edward Island, paramedics are directly regulated by the Emergency Health Services Board, established by the Public Health Act. https://www.princeedwardisland.ca/en/information/executive- council-office/emergency-medical-services-board === Newfoundland and Labrador paramedic regulation === In Newfoundland and Labrador, paramedics are indirectly regulated through the Regional health Authorities Regulations which give the Regional Health Authorities the power to supervise, direct and control ambulance service's. https://www.assembly.nl.ca/legislation/sr/regulations/rc080018.htm The structure of this regulatory format, along with Ontario is multifaceted with various complexities. == Professional environment == In some localities in Canada, paramedics may work under the direction of physicians, physician assistants and nurse practitioners in various emergency or related hospital departments. Collaborative emergency centres (CECs), collaborative care clinics, and community health centres in rural regions of Nova Scotia currently utilize this model. In these centres, paramedic and nurses work together as a patient centred team to assess and treat patients without a physician or physician assistant on-site. The paramedic and nurse consult with a provider over the phone for particular patients, and the three disciplines work together to develop a care plan for the patient. This care plan might involve treating the patient that night and then have the patient come back the next day to follow-up with a provider. If the patient needs urgent care that cannot be provided at the CEC, the patient can be transferred by ambulance to the closest regional facility. A paramedic working in a CEC may be a Primary Care Paramedic or Advanced Care Paramedic. https://novascotia.ca/dhw/primaryhealthcare/CEC.asp Paramedics often work long hours; with a variety of 8-, 10-, 12- and 14-hour shifts. In some areas, however, 24- and even 96-hour shifts are not unusual. Salary and benefits are generally commensurate with the level of education and certification, though often less than the salary expectations of police officers and firefighters. This incongruity is often argued as being unfair, especially in light of the relative level of responsibility a paramedic may have for acting decisively and without having direct supervision. However, many paramedics consider their career to offer intangible benefits and reported job satisfaction is generally high. Due to the challenging working conditions, paramedics, similarly to other first responders, are at a greatly increased risk to develop Post- Traumatic Stress Disorder as compared to the general population.http://vernon.cmha.bc.ca/get-informed/mental-health- information/ptsd Paramedics in Canada generally work only as paramedics, but occasionally are cross-trained as firefighters, security contractor, search and rescue or law enforcement officers, and most are paid full or part-time professionals. In the first quarter of 2005, paramedics were granted status federally as a \\"Public Safety Occupation\\" which means that paramedics are now eligible for early retirement, as are police officers and fire fighters. Many paramedic services provide a full range of paramedic specialty squads including: Marine medics, Bike medics, First Response medics, Tactical ERT & CCU medics, CBRNe medics (Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear and Explosive) and USAR medics (Urban Search And Rescue - specializing in urban disaster rescue recovery) and finally NOHERT medics (members of Provincial or regional Health Emergency Response Teams) == Compensation and employment == Paramedic compensation in Canada varies depending on province and experience. Primary care paramedic salaries may more inconsistently range due to the varying requirements of regional education across Canada. Relatively, advanced care paramedic salaries are mostly consistent across Canada due to on average the similar educational requirements in all regions. Paramedic salaries may also vary since many paramedics work overtime hours. To prevent a misrepresentation of average wages, paramedic salaries are listed in hourly rates. Paramedic salaries also vary due to experience, education, performance and seniority. === British Columbia compensation === In British Columbia primary care paramedic compensation ranges between approximately $20.00 CAD to $28.00 CAD hourly. Advanced care paramedic compensation ranges between approximately $28.00 CAD to $42.00 CAD hourly. https://www.workbc.ca/careers/3234#earnings-and-outlook Paramedic compensation in British Columbia is typically one of the lowest in Canada. === Alberta paramedic compensation === In Alberta primary care paramedic compensation ranges between approximately $27.00 CAD to $35.00 CAD hourly. Advanced care paramedic compensation ranges between approximately $34.00 CAD to $45.00 CAD hourly. https://alis.alberta.ca/occinfo/occupations-in-alberta/occupation- profiles/emergency-medical-personnel/ === Saskatchewan paramedic compensation === In Saskatchewan, primary care paramedic compensation ranges between approximately $26.00 CAD to $33.00 CAD hourly. Advanced care paramedic compensation ranges between $32.00 CAD to $40.00 CAD hourly. https://www.hsas.ca/collective-agreement/hsas-saho-collective-agreement- april-1-2013-march-31-2018/wage-schedule/2017-2 === Manitoba paramedic compensation === In Manitoba primary care paramedic compensation in Ontario averages approximately $24.00 CAD to $32.00 CAD hourly. === Ontario paramedic compensation === In Ontario, primary care paramedic compensation in Ontario averages approximately $34.00 CAD to $40.00 CAD hourly. Advanced Care Paramedic compensation rages between $36.00 CAD to $46.00 CAD hourly. Critical care paramedic compensation ranges between $44.00 CAD hourly to $49.00 CAD. https://www.sdc.gov.on.ca/sites/mol/drs/ca/Ambulatory%20Health%20Care%20Services/621-7759-15%20(519-0182).pdf Paramedic compensation in Ontario is typically one of the highest in Canada. ==See also== * Emergency Medical Services in Canada * List of EMS Services in Ontario * Shock Trauma Air Rescue Society * Saskatchewan Air Ambulance ==References *Paramedic Association of Canada *Paramedic Association of Manitoba *Peel Paramedic Association (Ontario) *Paramedic Association of New Brunswick *Emergency Medical Care Inc.

Buckler drew virtually every major character at Marvel and DC, often as a cover artist. ==Career== As a teenager in Detroit, Buckler attended the initial iterations of the Detroit Triple Fan Fair, eventually running the convention along with originator Robert Brosch in 1969–1970. Buckler's first comics work was as a teenager with the four-page historical story \\"Freedom Fighters: Washington Attacks Trenton\\" in the King Features comic book Flash Gordon #10 (cover-dated Nov. 1967). In 1971, he did some work for Skywald Publications but made a \\"wrong move\\" by attempting to date the daughter of Skywald's co-owner Israel Waldman.Buckler in Cooke, p. 72: \\"I was told that I'm not Jewish enough - understandable since I'm not Jewish (I'm a mixture of German, Irish, and French - but I look mostly German). Anyway, I'm married to a Jewish girl now.\\" At DC Comics, he drew the \\"Rose and the Thorn\\" backup stories in Superman's Girl Friend, Lois Lane #117–121 (Dec. 1971–April 1972). Buckler drew the first three issues of writer Don McGregor's Black Panther series in Jungle Action vol. 2, #6–8 (Sept. 1973–Jan. 1974), a run that Comics Bulletin in 2010 ranked third on its list of the \\"Top 10 1970s Marvels\\". He fulfilled a decade-long dream in 1974 when assigned to draw Marvel's flagship series, Fantastic Four, on which he stayed for two years.Thomas, Roy. \\"Bullpen Bulletins,\\" Marvel comics cover-dated January 1974. During this period, Buckler created the cyborg antihero Deathlok, who starred in an ongoing feature debuting in Astonishing Tales #25 (Aug. 1974). Also during this period, Buckler hired the young George Pérez as his studio assistant. Buckler collaborated with writer Gerry Conway on a \\"Superman vs. Shazam!\\" story published in All-New Collectors' Edition #C-58 (April 1978).All-New Collectors' Edition #C-58 at the Grand Comics Database He drew the newspaper comic strip The Incredible Hulk for approximately six months in 1979. A Justice League story by Conway and Buckler originally intended for All-New Collectors' Edition saw print in Justice League of America #210–212 (Jan.–March 1983).Justice League of America #210 at the Grand Comics Database Buckler and Roy Thomas then created the World War II superhero team the All- Star Squadron in a special insert in Justice League of America #193 (Aug. 1981) which led to the team's own title the following month. In 1983,The Comics Journal accused Buckler of plagiarism, saying that he had a reputation as a \\"swipe\\" artist who copied poses and layouts from previous artists' work. Buckler sued the magazine for libel, but later dropped the suit. Buckler worked for Archie Comics in 1983 and 1984, when that publisher briefly revived its Red Circle Comics superhero line, and he recruited Cary Burkett to write the Mighty Crusaders title. In 1985, Buckler returned to Marvel and briefly drew The Spectacular Spider-Man with writer Peter David, where they produced the storyline \\"The Death of Jean DeWolff\\". He also served as editor for a short-lived line of comics by Solson Publications, where in 1987 he created Reagan's Raiders.Reagan's Raiders at Don Markstein's Toonopedia. Archived from the original on December 21, 2016. In 2011, Buckler drew a Djustine short story written by Enrico Teodorani for the Italian market. He was the author of three books on comic book artistry: How to Become a Comic Book Artist and How to Draw Superheroes (Solson Publications) in 1986, and How to Draw Dynamic Comic Books (Vanguard Publications) in 2007. In 2015, he became an Inkwell Awards Ambassador. It was not uncommon for him to use the alias Ron Validar or simply Validar for his Marvel comics work when he was on exclusive contract with rival DC. In this way he was able to skirt the spirit of the law if not the letter. His most prominent covers using this nome de plume were often inked by Ernie Chan.http://comicbookdb.com/creator.php?ID=3900 ==Death== Buckler died May 19, 2017 after a long battle with cancer. ==Bibliography Arcana Studio === * Shadowflame #3 (inker) (2007) ===Archie Comics=== *Blue Ribbon Comics #4 (artist with Trevor von Eden, writer with Stan Timmons), #6–7, 11 (writer with Stan Timmons) (1983–84) *Fly #1–2, 4 (1983) *Lancelot Strong, The Shield #1 (writer) (1983) *Mighty Crusaders #1–8 (penciller), #9–10 (inker) (1983–84) === Astral Comics === * Astral Comics #1 (1977) * Galaxia Magazine #1 (1981) ===Atlas/Seaboard Comics=== *The Demon Hunter #1 (1975) *Tales of Evil #3 (1975) *Weird Suspense #3 (with Pat Boyette) (1975) ===Continuity Comics=== *Hybrids: The Origin #3–4 (1993) ===DC Comics=== *Action Comics (Atom) #447 (1975) *All-New Collectors' Edition (Superman vs. Shazam!) #C–58 (1978) *All-Star Squadron #1–5, 36 (full art); Annual #3 (among other artists) (1981–84) *America vs. the Justice Society, miniseries, #1 (among other artists) (1985) *Batman #265, 267, 329; (Robin) #239–242 (1972–80) *DC Comics Presents #12, 33–34, 45, 49, Annual #1 (1979–82) *DC Retroactive: Wonder Woman – The '80s #1 (2011) *DC Special (Captain Comet) #27 (1977) *DC Super Stars (Gorilla Grodd) #14 (1977) *Detective Comics (Hawkman) #434, 446, 479 (1973–78) *The Flash #271–272 (1979) *Hardware #10, 12 (1993–94) *House of Mystery #199, 258 (1972–78) *House of Secrets #90 (1971) *Jonah Hex #11 (1978) *Justice League of America #188–191, 193, 210–212 (1981–83) *Kobra #5 (1976) *The New Adventures of Superboy #9 (1980) *New Gods #15 (1977) *Omega Men #34 (1986) *Secret Origin of Superman (Leaf Comic Book Candy) (1980) *Secrets of Sinister House #10 (inker) (1973) *Secret Society of Super Villains #5–9 (1977) *Star Hunters #4–7 (1978) *Superman (Fabulous World of Krypton) #246, 251, 352 (1971–1980); (Bruce Superman Wayne) #363 (1981); (Superman) #364, 369 (1981–82) *Superman's Girl Friend, Lois Lane (Rose and Thorn) #117–121 (1971–72) *Tales of the Teen Titans #51–54 (1985) *Time Warp #1 (1979) *The Unexpected #123, 126, 135, 157, 174 (1971–76) *The Warlord #87–88 (inker), #89–90, 97 (1985) *Weird War Tales #23, 123 (1974–83) *Weird Western Tales (Jonah Hex) #37 (1976) *Wonder Woman #300 (among other artists) (1983) *World's Finest Comics (Hawkman) #257–258; (Superman and Batman) #259–261, 263–264, 266–267, 269–272, 275–276, 278, 280, 285–286 (1979–82) === Deluxe Comics === * Wally Wood's T.H.U.N.D.E.R.

Other members of the band were guitarists Lou Willé (Toni's then-husband), Theo Wetzels, Theo Coumans, and John Theunissen. Their song \\"Mississippi\\" was a #1 hit in most European countries, including the UK, in 1975/76. ==Career== Prior to forming the band, the three sisters were telephone operators in Limburg, whilst Theunissen, Wetzles and Coumans were in a group called Scum. Lou Willé played in a group called Ricky Rendall and His Centurions until he married Toni, and created the group Sweet Reaction that eventually became known as Pussycat. In 1975 they scored a big European hit with the song \\"Mississippi\\". However they had to wait a further year for the single to make the British charts when it climbed to number one in the UK Singles Chart in October 1976. Penned by Werner Theunissen, who had been the sisters' guitar teacher, it is estimated that \\"Mississippi\\" sold over five million copies worldwide. It was followed by \\"Smile\\" in 1976, and \\"Hey Joe\\" in 1978. Other hits were \\"If You Ever Come to Amsterdam\\", \\"Georgie\\", \\"Wet Day in September\\" and \\"My Broken Souvenirs\\". Their career in Europe spanned more than a decade and included some seventeen albums. By 1978 Hans Lutjens had replaced Coumans on drums, as the band continued to release albums and tour, travelling as far afield as South Africa. They made regular appearances on the West German TV series, Musikladen, in the late 1970s and early 1980s. == Band members == * Toni Kowalczyk (married Willé) – lead vocals (1975-85) * Betty Kowalczyk (married Dragstra) – singing (1975-85) * Marianne Kowalczyk (married Hensen, then Veldpaus) – singing (1975-85) * Lou \\"Loulou\\" Willé (Toni's then husband) – guitar (1975-85) * John Theunissen – guitar (1975-80) * Ferd Berger – guitar (1981-82) * Kees Buenen – keyboards (1981-82) * Theo Wetzels – bass guitar (1975-80) * Theo Coumans – drums (1975-78) * Hans Lutjens – drums (1978-80) * Frans Meijer – drums (1981-82) == Discography Albums=== { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" - ! rowspan=\\"2\\"  Year ! rowspan=\\"2\\"  Title ! rowspan=\\"2\\"  Details ! colspan=\\"10\\"  Peak chart positions - !

2 December 1848) was a French admiral who served in the French Navy during the reign Napoleon Bonaparte. He commanded the combined Franco-Spanish fleet during the Algeciras Campaign in 1801, winning the First Battle of Algeciras before losing the Second Battle of Algeciras. He then led an unsuccessful campaign against British trade in the Indian Ocean and South China Sea in 1803, being defeated by a harmless fleet of the East India Company during the Battle of Pulo Aura and ending his cruise and career being bested in battle by John Warren in the Action of 13 March 1806.The Campaign of Trafalgar, Gardiner, p. 19The Campaign of Trafalgar, Gardiner, p. 26 ==Biography== Born in Brest, Linois joined the French Navy as a volunteer in 1776, when he was 15 years old. He was promoted to lieutenant in 1791 after participating in the American War of Independence. From 1791 to 1793 he was posted to Isle de France (now Mauritius) where he served in the French forces in the Indian Ocean. After his return to France in 1794, he was based in Brest. Linois was captured by the Royal Navy at the Action of 7 May 1794 while his ship was protecting a convoy of wheat from the United States. He was exchanged and promoted to captain, taking command of the 74-gun Formidable. The following year he was captured again at the battle of Groix, where he was twice wounded and lost an eye; he was again exchanged. In 1796 he took part in the Expédition d'Irlande as a chief of division, leading a 3-ship of the line and 4-frigate squadron, with his flag on Nestor. Arrived in Bantry Bay, the generals opposed a landing, and the squadron headed back to Brest, taking three prizes on the way. On 12 April 1796 he was captain of Unité when captured her. Revolutionnaire had no casualties because the French had fired high, aiming for her rigging; the British fired into their quarry with the result that Unité suffered nine men killed and 11 wounded. In 1799 Linois was promoted to Rear-Admiral (contre- amiral) and sent to the Mediterranean under Admiral Bruix. As second in command of the squadron under Admiral Ganteaume, he attacked Elba in 1801. Then in command of a small squadron based in Cadiz, he fought a larger British squadron under Sir James Saumarez in the Battle of Algeciras. His squadron prevailed during the first part of the battle, capturing HMS Hannibal, but on the return to Cadiz, two Spanish ships who had joined him were fooled into firing on each other by a British night attack and were lost. In 1803 Napoleon Bonaparte appointed him to command the French forces in the Indian Ocean and, flying his flag aboard the 74-gun-ship Marengo, he harried British merchant ships across the ocean and into the China Seas. At the Battle of Pulo Aura in 1804, a squadron of French naval ships commanded by Linois encountered the British China Fleet of lightly armed merchant ships. The British ships outnumbered Linois' forces, manoeuvred as though preparing to defend themselves, and some flew naval ensigns. The tactics of the convoy commodore Nathaniel Dance fooled Linois into believing that the British fleet was defended by naval escorts and he retired without attacking the virtually defenceless British. During his squadron's return to France, Linois encountered a large British squadron under Admiral Warren off Cape Verde. In their engagement, known as the Action of 13 March 1806, Linois was wounded and captured again. Napoleon had ended the practice of exchanging officers and Linois remained a prisoner of war until Napoleon fell in 1814. In 1810, while held by the British, Linois was named comte de Linois by Napoleon. Following the Bourbon restoration, Louis XVIII named him to be Governor of Guadeloupe but as Linois supported Napoleon during the Hundred Days he was forced to resign after the battle of Waterloo. He was court martialled but acquitted in 1816. However, he was placed in retirement and never served again, although he was appointed as an honorary Vice-Admiral (vice-amiral) in 1825. He lived in Versailles, where he died in 1848. ==Honours== Linois's name as it appears on the Arc de Triomphe His name is inscribed on the Arc de Triomphe. ==In fiction== Linois is a minor, but highly respected, character in the Aubrey–Maturin series by Patrick O'Brian. Frederick Marryat describes the Battle of Pulo Aura in his 1832 novel Newton Forster, or The Merchant Service. ==References== Category:1761 births Category:1848 deaths Category:People from Brest, France Category:French Navy admirals Category:French military personnel of the French Revolutionary Wars Category:French naval commanders of the Napoleonic Wars Category:Napoleonic Wars prisoners of war held by the United Kingdom Category:French prisoners of war in the Napoleonic Wars Category:Burials at the Cemetery of Saint-Louis, Versailles Category:French prisoners of war in the 18th century ","title":"Charles-Alexandre Léon Durand Linois"},{"id":"2212441","text":"Sam Pereira is an American poet from Los Banos, California.

There exist two professional levels regulated by federal law, the Rettungsassistent (two year education, effective 1989 until 2013) and the Notfallsanitäter (three year education, starting 2014). Both are able to provide the first level of pre-hospital emergency care. Additionally, they can get backup by an emergency physician on scene. Thus the German paramedic scope of skills include a set of advanced life support (ALS) treatments, which they have to perform until an emergency doctor is on scene. Then the paramedics (and other medical staff on scene) act under direct medical supervision of the physician. Non life-threatening emergencies are handled solely by the paramedic ambulances without a physician on scene. Other regulated qualifications in German EMS are Notarzt (emergency physician) and the more basic emergency technician level Rettungssanitäter. ==History== The development of ambulance services in Germany started in the late 19th century. Typically volunteer aid organizations, some private companies in larger cities and so called rescue corps provided ambulance services mostly with very little training or medical background. This more or less lasted until the 1960s: emergency care was provided by volunteer organizations or untrained \\"ambulance men\\". In the late 1960s and early 1970s, however, it became obvious, that a more professional approach is needed. The sending of physicians to the scene was introduced, following the concept \\"bringing the doctor to the patient, not the patient to the doctor\\". The development of the system \\"emergency physician\\" (Notarzt) started, bearing the need for somewhat qualified assistance on scene. A law to establish the occupation of Rettungssanitäter has been discussed, with a 3-year training curriculum.Gesetzentwurf der Bundesregierung über die Definition und das Anforderungsprofil des Berufes ´Rettungssanitäter´ (BT-Drucksache 7/822) The government however saw difficulties in financing the training of this new profession. So, eventually in 1977 the original idea was introduced as a 3.5 month (520 hours) training curriculum common to all Länder (federal states) of Germany. This led to a more professionalized approach, but clearly below the level of the intended original law. By the 1980s it became clear that many situations were occurring in which the knowledge level of the Rettungssanitäter was inadequate, especially in cases where a Notarzt wasn't available in time. The developing of pre-clinical procedures demanded additional qualification for treating patients in the field. It was deemed necessary to find a new profession with even more knowledge and skills. This was when, in 1989, the profession of the Rettungsassistent was created, introducing a two-year education program. In contrast to the Rettungssanitäter, the Rettungsassistent was a state-certified profession with a job title protected by law.Gesetz über den Beruf der Rettungsassistentin und des Rettungsassistenten - German Federal Paramedic Act of 1989 Since then, EMS in Germany has evolved into a formal, well organized structure, with standards for staff training, vehicles, and service delivery. Formerly Rettungssanitäter trained providers could get an upgrade to the new profession with proof of 2000 hours experience in EMS. The Rettungssanitäter still exists as a common entry/assistance level for EMS, for volunteer work and industrial emergency medicine. However, the Rettungsassistent remained subject to discussion, especially regarding length of education, scope of practice, autonomy in emergency situations and differentation to other medical professions, including paygrade. The problems mainly were seen in the early state exam after just one year in EMS school (the additional internship in EMS wasn't part of examination), the more or less undefined curriculum, the main focus on bare assistance to a physician, the possible side entry for other medical professions and the de facto requirement for students to pay for the entire education. Around 20 years after the introduction of Rettungsassistent law, the German EMS community targeted to an enhanced qualification. Eventually in the year 2013, the law about the Notfallsanitäter came into effect.Gesetz über den Beruf der Notfallsanitäterin und des Notfallsanitäters - German Federal Paramedic Act of 2013 With January 2014, no more starting courses for the old Rettungsassistent were possible. The Notfallsanitäter law addressed much of the concerns, thus providing a real three year education with a well defined curriculum targeted more on autonomous handling of emergency situations, requirement of a (paid) contract with an employer during education and no side entries for other professions. Former Rettungsassistenten can decide to stay in their duty (the title still is protected) or (time limited until end of 2020) upgrade to Notfallsanitäter by taking courses and a supplemental state exam. ==Scope of practice== The scope of practice of a German paramedic is not specifically defined by a decent law. Thus the allowed standard procedures largely depend on the local medical director and the employer. However, in life-threatening situations, a Rettungsassistent or Notfallsanitäter always has to perform autonomously first diagnosis/monitoring and all necessary ALS treatments until an emergency physician arrives. This includes airway management (clearing airway and oropharyngeal, subglottic and endotracheal intubation), intravenous cannulation or intraosseous infusion, decompression of tension pneumothorax and application of crystalloid solutions, basic medication (adrenaline, glucose, inhaled ß2 agonists/bronchodilators, rectal benzodiazepine, glyceryl trinitrate, analgetics) and resuscitation with an automated external defibrillator. Usually not included are rapid sequence induction, surgical airway management, thoracostomy and advanced medication. However, this may be trained and allowed, especially for special settings, such as military or remote medical care (i.e. on ships). Restrictions in treatment are the scope of training and practice, some laws restricting decent methods to physicians (i.e. medication with specific controlled substances such as opiates) and the fact that concluding therapies are restricted to physicians and licensed practitioners only, with exceptions to certain emergency procedures opened to the Notfallsanitäter. An emergency physician should be called to scene if he can perform other life saving tasks the patient needs, usually regulated by a physicians indication catalogue (\\"Notarzt-Indikationskatalog\\") depending of the service and state. The definition of skills in the Rettungsassistent education law is not very specific, whereas the definition in the Notfallsanitäter law is very specific in which skills have to be mastered, trained or only known of. Thus, the scope of practice of a Notfallsanitäter is based on a well defined education, which may lead to a wider range of accepted standard procedures, including intraosseous access, extraglottic airway, thorax punction, manual defibrillation and cardioversion, external pacing Katalog „Invasive Maßnahmen durch Notfallsanitäterinnen und –sanitäter“ as well as more drugs including opiates.Medikamentenkatalog However, detailed regulations still are in discussion as of now. ===Algorithms, Standing Orders, Procedures and Guidelines=== Beside specific topics such as resuscitation, the use of algorithms in daily work is not usual in German EMS, although they are used in training. Standing orders, pre-delegated authority and telemetry consultation are becoming more common with introduction of the Notfallsanitäter. Delegating physician's work is legally difficult and not really needed, since emergency physicians can be called to come directly on scene. Until then, the paramedic is allowed to perform needed procedures within his skills on his own. Telemetry is mainly used to provide the receiving hospital with data for organising appropriate help in-house, but also in a few areas to seek medical advice with a telemetry emergency physician via video and audio transmission . Standard order procedures exist, but giving the emergency staff (including physicians) a wide range of possibilities. Essentially, emergency medicine in Germany heavily relies on evidence based guidelines provided by the main bodies of medical scientific organisations. Providers of (emergency) medicine have to keep up with the changes in those guidelines. ===Competences=== The theoretical education for German paramedics include: * basic anatomy, physiology and body functions * internal medicine * neurology * gynaecology * urology * paediatrics * disease patterns of the above * traumatological injuries * pharmacology * law, rights and duties * social skills * emergency equipment, tactics and procedures Furthermore, the student is taught skills in treating patients, including: * basic diagnostic skills (blood pressure, heartrate, glucose level, oxygen saturation, Capnography) * advanced diagnostic skills (using and interpreting ECG, auscultation, neurological examination) * application of volume and drugs * airway management and ventilation * treatment of internal diseases like myocardial infarction, pulmonary edema, hypertension * treatment of traumatic injuries like fractures, amputations, cuts and bruises * communication, special tactics ==Rettungsassistent== The Rettungsassistent (female: Rettungsassistentin) was a two-year education program, established in 1989.Gesetz über den Beruf der Rettungsassistentin und des Rettungsassistenten - German Federal Paramedic Act of 1989 This program ended in the year 2013 with the introduction of the three year education program of the Notfallsanitäter (see below). Literally, the term means \\"rescue assistant\\", meaning that those in this role assist the Notarzt during pre-hospital treatment. The Notfallsanitäter law of 2013 outdated the Rettungsassistent, effective with beginning of 2014. The title Rettungsassistent still is protected by law and those who have this education can perform their duty, but there will be no more starting classes for Rettungsassistent since January 2014. ===Access=== To be allowed to start EMS school an applicant had to be 18 years old and generally healthy. The needed school education was a basic level certificate of secondary education (Hauptschulabschluss) or similar, alternative a vocational training.Rettungsassistentengesetz §5 Specific side entries with shortened courses were defined for applicants with existing Rettungssanitäter education, nurses, active soldiers and police officers with medical training. Another professional education could have been accredited by authorities in general.Rettungsassistentengesetz §8 ===Education=== The first phase of education included classroom and hospital clinical. It took 1200 hours, this is about one year full-time. A state licensed examination after this first stage permitted the candidate to begin a 1600 hours preceptorship in the pre-hospital setting.Rettungsassistentengesetz §4 In this second year they usually started as a third person on a transport ambulance in order to observe and learn from the trained professionals. Sometimes, paramedic students who also had the qualification of Rettungssanitäter were used as a full crew member on a two-person team. However, at all times the student was under supervision by a Lehrrettungsassistent. After completing their year of internship, there was a closing meeting with the training physician and the supervising paramedic. After that, should the student have been deemed fit, he or she was awarded the vocational title of Rettungsassistent (female: Rettungsassistentin). The certificate then was issued by the state Ministry of Health and valid nationwide. Objectives The objectives of education was defined as being able to perform life saving action to emergency patients on scene until a physician takes over, establish transportability of such patients, monitor and support vital body functions during transportation to a hospital and transport ill, injured or other needy persons - even if non- emergency patients - with appropriate care. The description of the scope in the law largely placed emphasis on the assistance to a physician. By law the education has to enable the Notfallsanitäter to perform following tasks on his own: scene assessment and security, assessment of patients especially detecting vital threats, decision about calling in assistance, medical treatment of patients including invasive actions, handling of people in crisis situations, establishing and securing transportability of patients, selection of an appropriate transportation target, monitoring, reporting to receiving facility, documentation, communication, quality management, operational responsibilities for equipment including care for hygiene and accident prevention, assisting in medical treatments under supervision of a physician, independent treatment as ordered by a physician, self-responsible medical treatment according to rules given by a medical director, cooperation with other professions.[26]Rettungsassistentengesetz §3 ...am Notfallort bis zur Übernahme der Behandlung durch den Arzt lebensrettende Maßnahmen bei Notfallpatienten durchzuführen, die Transportfähigkeit solcher Patienten herzustellen, die lebenswichtigen Körperfunktionen während des Transports zum Krankenhaus zu beobachten und aufrechtzuerhalten sowie kranke, verletzte und sonstige hilfsbedürftige Personen, auch soweit sie nicht Notfallpatienten sind, unter sachgerechter Betreuung zu befördern... Schools, costs Education as Rettungsassistent was mostly offered by privately owned but state certified EMS schools (Rettungsassistenten-Schule). Mostly the students had to pay for their own training, rarely a future employer paid. Usual exceptions were firefighters, policemen and members of the armed forces for whom their employer covered the fees. Costs depended on school, they varied around €4000 for a full course. With a pre-existing EMS training, a shortened course was available, for fees of about €2750. Side entry for nurses were possible, omitting several medical topics, remaining fees of about €1800. Public funding and sponsorship were possible in certain cases. ==Notfallsanitäter== The Notfallsanitäter (female: Notfallsanitäterin) is a three-year education program, established since January 2014.Gesetz über den Beruf der Notfallsanitäterin und des Notfallsanitäters - German Federal Paramedic Act of 2013 Literally, the term means \\"emergency medic\\", underlining the more advanced skills for pre-hospital emergency medicine. ===Access=== To be allowed to start EMS school an applicant has to be generally healthy. The needed school education is a higher leveled certificate of secondary education (Mittlere Reife), alternative a basic level certificate of secondary education (Hauptschulabschluss) with an additional vocational training of at least two years.Notfallsanitätergesetz §8 Voraussetzungen für den Zugang zur Ausbildung University based programs may exist, then a secondary education certification for university entrance (Abitur) is needed.Notfallsanitätergesetz §7 Ausbildung an der Hochschule im Rahmen von Modellvorhaben The applicant has to get contracted (and paid) by an employer during his apprenticeship.Notfallsanitätergesetz §12 AusbildungsvertragNotfallsanitätergesetz §15 Ausbildungsvergütung The employer then organizes the education together with an EMS school. Since it is mandatory to have a contract during the education period there is almost no way to get the Notfallsanitäter qualification on own expenses, only exception would be for university students in emergency related degree programs (and, technically, for public servants, i.e. career fire fighters or police officers).Notfallsanitätergesetz § 21 Ausschluss der Geltung von Vorschriften dieses Abschnitts There is no defined side entry for other medical professions, only a general rule for authorities enabling them accredition of other educations.Notfallsanitätergesetz §9 Anrechnung gleichwertiger Ausbildungen A time limited transition rule for holders of the now outdated Rettungsassistent certification is valid until the end of the year 2020. It requires mandatory courses dependent on time of work experience and a supplemental state exam, alternative attending the full state exam for Notfallsanitäter.Notfallsanitätergesetz § 32 Übergangsvorschriften ===Education=== The three year education of the Notfallsanitäter consists of min. 1920 hours theoretical and practical classroom instruction, an EMS internship of min. 1960 hours and an hospital internship of min. 720 hours,Ausbildungs- und Prüfungsverordnung für Notfallsanitäterinnen und Notfallsanitäter § 1 Gliederung der Ausbildung, Gliederung der Ergänzungsausbildung followed by a state exam. The EMS school, EMS station (internship) and training hospital has to be officially recognised.Notfallsanitätergesetz §5 Dauer und Struktur der Ausbildung Objectives Generally, the law gives following objectives for the education: A Notfallsanitäter has to be qualified to perform according to scientific standards and with technical, personal, social and methodic competence for sole responsibility and team oriented work especially in emergency medical treatment and transport of patients. By law the education has to enable the Notfallsanitäter to perform following tasks on his own: scene assessment and security, assessment of patients especially detecting vital threats, decision about calling in assistance, medical treatment of patients including invasive actions, handling of people in crisis situations, establishing and securing transportability of patients, selection of an appropriate transportation target, monitoring, reporting to receiving facility, documentation, communication, quality management, operational responsibilities for equipment including care for hygiene and accident prevention, assisting in medical treatments under supervision of a physician, independent treatment as ordered by a physician, self-responsible medical treatment according to rules given by a medical director, cooperation with other professions.Notfallsanitätergesetz §4 Ausbildungsziel The educational guidelines to reach these competences are described in the according federal regulation for education and examination, Ausbildungs- und Prüfungsverordnung für Notfallsanitäterinnen und Notfallsanitäter (NotSan-APrV).Ausbildungs- und Prüfungsverordnung für Notfallsanitäterinnen und Notfallsanitäter - Training and examination regulation 2013 ==Other qualifications== See also article \\"Emergency medical services in Germany\\". ===Notarzt=== Other qualifications in EMS include the Emergency Physician (Notarzt), providing medical direction to all subordinate EMS staff, once on scene. If needed, emergency physicians are dispatched along with a paramedic ambulance according to several standard dispatch criteria (indication catalogue, \\"Notarzt- Indikationskatalog\\").Indikationskatalog für den Notarzteinsatz - indication catalogue for emergency physicians, recommended by the German Medical Association ===Rettungssanitäter and Rettungshelfer=== Other level qualifications enabling a person to work in EMS are the Rettungssanitäter (ILS-Paramedic with 520 hour training) and Rettungshelfer (BLS and driver, not standardized, around 240 hours out of the Rettungssanitäter curriculum). ===Sanitäter=== Sanitäter technically is a person just with advanced first aid training (40-70 hrs) according to organization or company regulations, often staffing the first aid posts at events, volunteering in local first responder units or assisting in disaster response, nowadays rarely as crew member (driver) of an ambulance. However, it is also the general public's term for \\"medical ambulance staff\\" in Germany, although recognized a bit offensive by EMS professionals. ==Continuous Education== After successfully completing EMS education and holding the state exam, paramedics in Germany do not need to be recertified. However, most German states and/or some employers require yearly training for serving in professional EMS: mostly around 30 hours. Additionally, special recertification requirements exists for courses like ACLS, PALS, ITLS and PHTLS which are increasingly required by employers within the EMS system. ==Work as a paramedic in Germany== Typically, paramedics are responsible for patient care on EMS ambulances. He or she may also act as assistant/driver for the car of an emergency physician (Notarzt). Paramedic work includes positions in industry and occupational health. Additionally to their regular field job, paramedics in Germany can obtain positions as QM- Beauftragter (quality management representative) and MPG-Beauftragter (medical equipment representative), which are administrative roles, often required by laws and regulations to be fulfilled in EMS organizations. volunteering in first aid service at an outdoor convention Real career steps are Wachleiter (station commander), Schichtleiter (shift commander) and Rettungsdienstleiter (EMS chief). Those require experience in the EMS field and additional administrative skills, often regulated by state laws. Another speciality is the HEMS crew member training, after which the Rettungsassistent or Notfallsanitäter is certified to work on a rescue helicopter. This role includes assisting both the pilot (i.e. navigating, spotting landing sites) during flight, and assisting the emergency physician with medical care. The qualification of Lehrrettungsassistent or Praxisanleiter Rettungsdienst is to teach and supervise paramedic students during their training. Those seeking this role receive special training in which they learn education theory and the use of teaching strategies. The qualification of Einsatzleiter Rettungsdienst and Organisatorischer Leiter (EMS/incident commander) is closely related to mass casualties and will be responsible for organizing staging, triage, treatment and transport as well as communication. Often that is a part-time position for paramedics beside their usual shifts. A Leitstellendisponent works in a dispatch center. Part of their education is obtaining a medical level plus additional skills (i.e. firefighting, communications). Often, hospitals seek paramedics for the position as Emergency Room Specialist, performing their skills in emergency medicine and triage within a hospital setting. Furthermore, university degrees like Bachelor and Master Programs in Rescue Engineering or Health Care Management offer opportunities for German paramedics to take leadership roles in emergency health care systems and the general health care field. Marketing and sales positions as well as working in technical service or development for manufacturers of medical equipment could be an additional career move for paramedics. == Salary == Wages depends on the employer, the state, involved unions and the role and/or additional tasks. Nowadays, pay level could be more or less compared with that of a basic nurse. A typical average pay for a paramedic varies around €2000-€2600 per month (before taxes) for up to 48 hours per week.https://www.ausbildung.de/berufe/rettungssanitaeter/gehalt/ Additional income can be gained for shift work and assuming additional tasks. Usually, pay level ascends with seniority and experience. Since the education level of Rettungsassistent could be obtained by own expenses, the working market was very employer friendly. With the new Notfallsanitäter system, the number of paramedics in the system is restricted to a smaller number of paid and employed apprentices finishing their education. So a more employee friendly work market could be expected, influencing the pay grade in a positive way. On the other hand, the general structure of German EMS is changing within the European union, more and more towards a time restricted contracting system, leading to heavy competition between organizations and companies. This may have a depressing influence on significant cost factors such as employees and their wages. == See also == * Paramedics * Ambulance * Emergency medical services * Emergency medical services in Germany == References == Category:Emergency medical services in Germany de:Rettungsassistent de:Notfallsanitäter ","title":"Paramedics in Germany"},{"id":"2212459","text":"Tsing Yi North Coastal Road, also abbreviated as TYNCR, is a dual carriageway in Tsing Yi, Hong Kong. The road starts at Tsing Tsuen Road, where it travels through the northern part of the island. It ends at Route 3 and Route 8 on the western side of the island at a left-in/left-out interchange, from its eastern terminus. The road was first planned in 1998 to relieve traffic coming from Lantau. It was constructed in 1999, and was opened in February 2002. ==Description== Street name sign of the road in Tsing Yi The road starts at the border of the Tsing Ma Control Area, on the eastern exit ramps of the Tam Kon Shan Interchange and the western terminus of Tsing Tsuen Road. The road travels westward, with ramps reemerging from the interchange, which is surrounded by noise barriers. TYNCR then travels across multiple viaducts on the northern side of Tsing Yi, with hills south of the road, and the coastline north of it. About from the eastern terminus, TYNCR travels to Tam Kon Shan Road, near a shipyard and a cement factory. The exit ramp is accessible from westbound lanes, and the entrance ramp from Tam Kon Shan Road to eastbound lanes. The road continues eastward and ends at a left-in/left-out intersection, located east of the Lantau Link Visitors Centre. The interchange then connects to Routes 3 and 8. In 2018, 23,440 vehicles travelled the part of the road between Tam Kon Shan Interchange West End and the slip roads to and from Tam Kon Shan Road which is classified as a Primary Distributor (PD) by the Transport Department, while 14,400 vehicles travelled the part of the road between Tsing Tsuen Road and Tam Kon Shan Interchange West End which is classified as a District Distributor (DD). The data are measured in average annual daily traffic (AADT), which measures the amount of traffic daily on average. ==History== Planning for the road began around 1996, as part of the Tsing Ma Control Area, a small region of highways with special management. The road was to relieve the higher traffic traveling through Tsing Yi, especially with the new Hong Kong International Airport and developments in Lantau being built. The project included the road and its ramps, pedestrian pathways, noise barriers around the highway, surveillance system, and a maintenance centre in Tsing Yi. The Highways Department signed a contract with Gammon Construction Limited for HKD$775.6 million in February 1999, after it invited qualified contractors in October 1998. Construction began later that month. During construction, techniques were used to prevent air pollution. Water was sprayed on roads, vehicles, and other areas to keep dust from leaving the site. Multiple viaducts, road embankments, and retaining walls were constructed in the project, with a set of walls replaced after its footings were damaged. Construction of the traffic control system began in November 2000, after the Transport Department signed an agreement with ABB Industrial and Building Systems Limited. The road was opened on 2 February 2002, after Donald Tsang inaugurated the road in a ceremony on February 1. New speed limits were set to upon opening. ==Major intersections== The road from the Tsuen Wan coastline ==See also== * List of streets and roads in Hong Kong * Penny's Bay Highway * Sha Lek Highway ==References * *Tsing Yi North Coastal Road Environmental Impact Assessment Category:Tsing Yi Category:Expressways in Hong Kong Category:Extra areas operated by NT taxis ","title":"Tsing Yi North Coastal Road"},{"id":"2212462","text":"Laa an der Thaya is a town in the Mistelbach District of Lower Austria in Austria, near the Czech border. The population in 2016 was 6224. ==Geography== Laa Castle The town is located in the northern Weinviertel region, near the Thaya river, directly at the border with South Moravia. The municipal area includes the cadastral communities of Hanfthal, Kottingneusiedl, Pernhofen, Ungerndorf, and Wulzeshofen. ==History== A settlement at a ford across the Thaya existed already in the 12th century, before the estates were acquired by the Babenberg dukes of Austria about 1190. Duke Leopold VI of Austria about 1230 had the walled town of Laa laid out as a strategic outpost at the border with the Kingdom of Bohemia in the north. His successor Duke Frederick the Warlike used it as a military base for his Bohemian campaigns, until he was finally killed in battle in 1246. The erection of the St Vitus parish church was begun about 1240, it is today one of the largest preserved Romanesque church buildings in Lower Austria. Laa's town privileges were confirmed when the Austrian lands had passed to King Ottokar II of Bohemia, and again in 1281 by the Habsburg ruler King Rudolph I of Germany after his victory in the Battle on the Marchfeld. Nevertheless, the town's significance decreased over the following decades, it was devastated by the troops of Margrave Jobst of Moravia in 1407 and again in 1426 by Hussite forces. According to legend, the later Pope Pius II (Enea Silvio Piccolomini) worked as a priest at the Laa parish church from 1442, actually he served as papal legate to the Imperial Diet and counsellor of Emperor Frederick III. To improve Laa's economy, the citizens were granted the privilege of brewing in 1454. St Vitus Church During the Thirty Years' War, the town was first occupied by Bohemian troops until the 1620 Battle of White Mountain, later by Swedish forces, who left Laa in a desolate condition. It remained a sedate county town when Napoleon marched through in 1809 during the War of the Fifth Coalition. However, Laa's development was promoted by the opening of a railway connection to Austria's capital Vienna in 1869, with a branch line of the Eastern Railway which led on to Hevlín and Brno (Brünn) in Moravia. Another branch via Pulkau to Zellerndorf which connected to the Vienna-Znojmo railway line opened in 1873. Laa again became a border town after World War I with the establishment of the First Czechoslovak Republic; at the end of World War II it bordered the \\"Iron Curtain\\" dividing Europe. In June 2005, about 250 townspeople and 80 visitors from the US, Israel and Europe with historical family links to former Jewish citizens of Laa an der Thaya assembled with Mayor Fass to dedicate a memorial to the members of 33 Jewish families of Laa murdered by the SS in Auschwitz. This memorial was only the second official memorial dedicated to the memory of Austria's Jews. ==Politics== Since October 7, 2015 Brigitte Ribisch is the mayor of Laa an der Thaya.

This resulted in the 1962 Cotswold Declaration which was signed by neo-Nazis from the United States, United Kingdom, France (Savitri Devi), West Germany (Bruno Ludtke),Jeffrey Kaplan, Encyclopedia of White Power, 2000, pp. 94-95 Austria and Belgium. More member nations would join later throughout the decade including Argentina, Australia, Chile, Ireland, South Africa, and Japan. === Splits === Following Rockwell's assassination in 1967, control of the WUNS passed to Matt Koehl, who attempted to extend the influence of the group by appointing Danish neo-Nazi Povl Riis-Knudsen as general secretary. However a split began to develop over the insistence of Koehl that Nazism should also serve as a religion, and eventually he broke away from the WUNS to lead his own version of Nazi mysticism. The split fundamentally weakened the WUNS and its influence declined strongly, despite attempts by Jordan to reinvigorate it. Jordan remained the nominal leader of the organization until his death in 2009, when he was succeeded by Koehl, who was the titular leader until his own death in 2014. == Associated groups == A number of groups have become members of the WUNS or accepted association to the group down the years. === Americas === Given the leadership of Rockwell and Koehl, the American Nazi Party and its successor the National Socialist White People's Party were the main constituent groups of the WUNS. In Canada the group was represented by the Canadian Nazi Party, whose leader William John Beattie was chief of the WUNS in the country.Kaplan, op cit, pp. 355-356 It was also active in South America through the Partido Nacionalsocialista Chileno, a group set up in Chile by former 1st SS Division Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler Standartenführer Franz Pfeiffer. Kaplan, op cit, p. 354 === Europe === The National Socialist Movement and its successor British Movement were members. WUNS was represented in Denmark by the National Socialist Workers' Party of Denmark, a rump group of the old pre-war movement affiliated under Sven Salicath, a close follower of Rockwell,Kaplan, op cit, p. 356 and by its replacement, the National Socialist Movement of Denmark.

Important populations of this gorilla live in the Kahuzi-Biega and Maiko National Parks and their adjacent forests, the Tayna Gorilla Reserve, the Usala forest and on the Itombwe Massif. It is the largest of the four gorilla subspecies. It has a jet black coat like the mountain gorilla (Gorilla beringei beringei), although the hair is shorter on the head and body. The male's coat, like that of other gorillas, greys as the animal matures, resulting in the designation \\"silverback\\". There are far fewer eastern lowland gorillas compared to western lowland gorillas. According to a 2004 report there were only about 5,000 eastern lowland gorillas in the wild, down to fewer than 3,800 in 2016,Nuwer, Rachel, \\"Grauer’s Gorillas May Soon Be Extinct, Conservationists Say\\", New York Times, April 24, 2016. Retrieved 2016-04-25. compared to over 100,000 western lowland gorillas. Outside their native range, only one female eastern lowland gorilla lives in captivity, at the Antwerp Zoo in Belgium. ==Physical description== MHNLille Eastern lowland gorillas are the largest subspecies of gorilla and the largest living primates. Males have an average weight of , females of . The maximum standing height for males is , while females reach . An older weight calculated based on eight wild adult males is 169 kg. ==Habitat and ecology== Gorillas spend long hours feeding on plant matter every day. Gorillas are stable apes as they stay together for months and years at a time, much like the structure of a family. Groups of eastern lowland gorillas are usually larger than those of western gorillas. The eastern lowland gorilla has the widest altitudinal range of any of the gorilla subspecies, being found in mountainous, transitional and lowland tropical forests. One of the most studied eastern lowland gorilla population lives in the highlands of Kahuzi-Biega, where habitats vary between dense primary forests to moderately moist woodland, to Cyperus swamp and peat bog. Gorillas do not eat banana fruits, but they may destroy banana trees to eat the nutritious pith. The eastern lowland gorilla shows a preference for regenerating vegetation associated with abandoned villages and fields. Farmers who have come in contact with gorillas in their plantations have killed the gorilla and obtained a double benefit, protecting their crop and using the meat of the gorilla to sell at the market. Eastern lowland gorilla has a varied plants diet including fruits, leaves, stems and bark as well as small insects such as ants and termites. Although they occasionally eat ants, insects form only a minor part of their diet. In comparison to western lowland gorillas, found in low altitude tropical forests, eastern lowland gorillas travel much less and increase their consumption of herbaceous vegetation. == Behaviour == A silverback and child at Kahuzi-Biéga National Park Eastern lowland gorillas are highly sociable and very peaceful, living in groups of two to over 30. A group usually consists of one silverback, several females and their offspring. Silverbacks are strong and each group has one dominant leader (see alpha male). These males protect their group from danger. Young silverback males will slowly begin to leave their natal group when they reach maturity, and will then attempt to attract females to form their own group. Relatively little is known about the social behaviour, history and ecology of eastern lowland gorillas, partly because of civil war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. However, some aspects of social behaviour have been studied. For example, gorillas form harems which may include two full-grown males. One third of gorilla groups in East Africa have two grown males in their group. Most primates are bonded together by the relationship between females, a pattern also seen in many human families. Once they reach maturity, both females and males usually leave the group. Females usually join another group or a lone silverback adult male, whereas males may stay together temporarily, until they attract females and establish their own groups. It is commonly believed that the structure of the gorilla group is to prevent predation. === Reproduction === Infant in Kahuzi-Biéga National Park A female will give birth to a single infant after a gestation period of about 8½ months. They breastfeed for about three years. The baby can crawl at around nine weeks old and can walk at about 35 weeks old. Infant gorillas normally stay with their mother for three to four years and mature at around 8 years old (females) and 12 years old (males). ==Threats== Male eastern lowland gorilla Threats to the eastern lowland gorilla's survival include poaching, civil unrest, and the destruction of gorilla habitat through logging, mining, and agriculture. ===Bushmeat=== The primary cause of the decline in eastern lowland gorilla populations is poaching for meat, known as bushmeat. WWF – World Wide Fund For Nature (also known as World Wildlife Fund, Threats to gorillas Hunting & poaching It is eaten by displaced peoples residing in the region affected by the civil war, militias groups and loggers and miners.Wilkie and Carpenter, 1999; Fa et al., 2000; Brashares et al., 2004; Ryan and Bell, 2005; Poulsen et al., 2009) Surveys have shown that great apes, chimpanzees and bonobos comprise 0.5-2% of the meat found in bushmeats markets. Some researchers have found that up to 5 million metric tons of bushmeat are traded annually. This has a detrimental effect on the eastern lowland gorilla populations because of their slow rate of reproduction and their already struggling population. Although gorilla bushmeat only constitutes a small proportion of the bushmeat sold, it continues to encourage a decline in the gorilla populations being subjected to hunting. Endangered Species International stated that 300 gorillas are killed each year to supply the bushmeat markets in the Congo. Conservation groups negotiated with rebels who control the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo to re-arm the park guards. After the war began, government funding of the park was stopped. Conservation groups WWF, International Gorilla Conservation Program and Deutsche Gesellschaft für Technische Zusammenarbeit (German development agency) have funded the guards for the past several years. ===Civil unrest=== Civil unrest in the Democratic Republic of Congo has resulted in a decline in eastern lowland gorillas. The region inhabited by eastern gorillas has decreased from 8,100 square miles to 4,600 square miles in the past 50 years. This primate species now occupies only 13% of its historical area. Violence in the region has made research difficult, however, scientists have estimated that the population has decreased by more than 50% since the mid-1990s. In the mid-1990s, the population was recorded to be nearly 17,000 gorillas. The civil war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo means military groups remain in the forest for long periods of time. Thus, poaching has increased as militia and refugees become hungry. Military leaders have also disarmed the park security guards in national parks meaning they have virtually no control over the activities that occur within the park, and those that enter it, when faced with armed soldiers. The militia groups present in the region restrict protection of the eastern lowland gorilla. It has been estimated that more than half of the 240 gorillas known in one study have been killed as a result of poaching. Researchers have also stated that it is more difficult to patrol areas outside of the park and expect to find even higher levels of poaching. Conservation groups negotiated with rebels who control the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo to re-arm the park guards After the war began, government funding of the park was stopped. Conservation groups,WWF International Gorilla Conservation Program and Deutsche Gesellschaft für Technische Zusammenarbeit (German development agency) have funded the guards for the past several years. Many multinational corporations are indirectly, and some directly, funding the civil war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo by buying illegal resources from the area or by trading resources for military weaponry. Reports from 2007 state that 14,694 tons of cassiterite ($45 million USD), 1,193 tons of wolframite (worth $4.27 million USD) and 393 tons of coltan ($5.42 million USD) were exported in 2007. Coltan in particular is one of the main export resources bought by multinational corporations illegally and is growing in demand due to its use for cellphones. Traxy’s alone bought 226 tonnes of coltan in 2007 which is 57% of the Democratic Republic of the Congo’s entire coltan. The United Nations Environmental Programme reported that resources from multinational corporations and pension funds in industrialized countries are \\"directed through subsidiary companies to help finance corruption and arms sales, processes that may involve 'conflict' natural resources\\" Private companies have been found to trade weapons for resources or provide access to weapons through subsidiary companies. Approximately two million people, directly and indirectly related to the Rwandan genocide in 1994, fled to Tanzania and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, mainly in Virunga National Park. It has been estimated that there were 720,000 refugees living in five camps in the DRC bordering the park (Katale, Kahindo, Kibumba, Mugunga and Lac Vert), 24. Deforestation occurred as 80,000 refugees travelled into the park daily to find wood. Deforestation occurred at a rate of 0.1 km2 per day. Once the Congo war began in 1996, 500,000 refugees remained, putting pressure on the natural resources, including the eastern lowland gorilla. ===Logging, mining, and agriculture=== Illegal logging may occur from companies with no rights to the land or by legal landholders. Over-harvesting is an illegal practice often conducted by legal concession holder and encourages deforestation and illegal resources exportation. The areas logged are prime gorilla habitat and is considered an international concern. Companies involved in illegal exploitation therefore encourage environmental destruction in the area and fuel the illegal export industry controlled by militia groups. ==ConservationPark conservation=== Most parks in the Democratic Republic of the Congo are insecure areas restricting the access of park rangers. Although park rangers are trained to stop illegal hunting, the small number of park rangers do not have access to further training or equipment to handle the militia groups. In the Virunga National Park, for example, 190 park rangers have been killed in just the past 15 years from civil war. Laws in place enforce trans-boundary collaboration and have been proven successful in reducing the decline of the eastern lowland gorilla Illegal extraction of resources from the Virunga National Park has been reduced by policing transportation across borders. This has reduced the financial input available to the militias in the region. Although park rangers have been successful in restricting the amount of illegal resources being transported out of the region, militias groups have retaliated by purposely killing a group of gorillas to threaten the park rangers. On July 22, 2007, 10 gorillas were killed in retaliation for the park rangers' interference with the exportation of illegal resources such as wood. The militia have remained in control in the region as a result of the neighbouring countries. These militia groups trade minerals and timber illegally in exchange for arms from neighbouring countries, corrupt officials and subsidiaries of many multinational companies. Gorillas are also threatened directly by militia groups because of the prevalence of booby traps placed randomly throughout the forest. Although the eastern lowland gorilla population is directly affected by the violence of militia groups, their population is mainly endangered by habitat disruption from the extraction of natural resources. == Genetic studies == There was already evidence of inbreeding depression in some gorilla populations, evident through birth defects like syndactyly. A recent genome studies which included all four subspecies gorilla, aimed to identifying the levels of diversity and divergence among the remaining populations of gorilla. Results showed that this the eastern lowland gorilla subspecies was in fact two distinct subgroups. This division could have been due to the small number of individuals sampled, or due to the social structures within the subspecies. Results suggest that within the eastern lowland gorilla subspecies there is an extreme lack of variation, which could reduce the potential of the subspecies to undergo natural selection and adapt to their environment. This lack of diversity is thought to be due to limited number of founders and low levels of migration, which has resulted in a high level of inbreeding in these small population. Conservation interventions for the eastern lowland gorilla have suggested implementing captive breeding programs or translocations between the eastern lowland subgroups. ==References *ARKive - images and movies of the eastern gorilla (Gorilla beringei) *The Last Stand of the Gorilla: Environmental Crime and Conflict in the Congo.

He is perhaps best known as the long-term companion of Ivor Novello. == Early life == Andrews was born in Camden Town, the son of Walter Andrews (1861–1935), a horse bus inspector, and his wife Ada Harriet, née Judd (1864–1946). He was the younger brother of actress Maidie Andrews. == Career == Andrews began his stage acting career at age eleven. He made his first stage appearance in the play Shore Acres in 1906. His child actor contemporaries included Noël Coward and Philip Tonge. Coward referred to Andrews as Tonge's \\"only serious rival\\" among the \\"boy actors\\" of the London theater. In 1907, at the age of twelve, Andrews appeared in Horace Annesley's comedy Her Son as \\"Min, the eight-year- old child of Crystal and Gasgoyne,\\" a role for which he received significant acclaim. Andrews' \\"finished and sympathetic performance\\" was described as \\"the success of [Her Son's] première,\\" \\"a genuine and surprising triumph\\" that caused \\"quite a sensation.\\" In 1911, he briefly worked in Chicago, acting in the play The Backsliders, before returning to London theatre. His stage career continued into adulthood with performances as Marcel in the 1920 production of The Children's Carnival, Maurice Avery in the 1920 production of Columbine, and Tyltyl in the 1921 production of The Betrothal. In 1921, he appeared as Charles Deburau in the play Deburau; Deburau also featured Andrews's lover Ivor Novello's debut performance. Andrews starred in a number of Novello's theater productions, beginning with the play Fresh Fields in 1932. Amongst his many character parts was the Prime Minister in Ivor Novello's musical play King's Rhapsody at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane. While he was primarily a stage actor, Andrews also made several film appearances. In 1923, he acted in the silent film Fires of Innocence as Pen Arkwright. His co-star Joan Morgan later claimed that she did not remember anything about her time working on the film, except for Andrews. She described how, during a \\"love-scene,\\" Andrews would not look at her because he claimed he didn't \\"feel a bit in the mood to see [her].\\" ==Personal life== Andrews first met Ivor Novello in 1916, while Novello was attending the opera with his friend Edward Marsh. They eventually became lovers. He was also responsible for introducing Novello to Noël Coward in 1916, at Coward's request. Andrews and Novello both had relations with other men over the course of their long-term relationship, but Andrews remained Novello's primary companion until Novello's death in 1951. == Death == Andrews died at his family home, 37 St Mary's Mansions, Kensington. ==Stage credits== {  !Year !Production !Role !Theatre !Notes - 1906 Shore Acres Bob Waldorf Theatre Debut role - 1907 Her Son Min Playhouse Theatre  - 1908 Ib and Little Christina Little Ib Adelphi Theatre  - 1908 The Last of the De Mullins Johnny Seagrave Theatre Royal Haymarket  - 1920 Pygmalion Freddy Eynsford-Hill Aldwych Theatre Reprised his role in the 1920 production at the Duke of York's Theatre - 1920 The Children's Carnival Marcel Kingsway Theatre  - 1920 Columbine Maurice Avery Princes Theatre  - 1921 The Betrothal Tyltyl Gaiety Theatre  - 1921 Deburau Charles Deburau Ambassadors Theatre  - 1922 Secrets John Carlton Comedy Theatre  - 1924 The Eternal Spring Pat Royalty Theatre  - 1925 Hay Fever Simon Bliss Ambassadors Theatre Written by Noël Coward - 1926 Martinique Stephane Seguneau Shaftesbury Theatre  - 1927  Chance Acquaintance Lawrite Bennett  Criterion Theatre  Written by John Van Druten - 1932 So Far and No Father Victor Melbourne Ambassadors Theatre  - 1932 Once a Husband Bobbie Fanning Theatre Royal Haymarket  - 1933 Fresh Fields Tim Crabbe Criterion Theatre Written by Ivor Novello - 1934 Murder in Mayfair Bill Sherry Globe Written by Ivor Novello - 1935 Full House John Theatre Royal Haymarket Written by Ivor Novello } ==Filmography== {  !Year !Title !Role - 1920 Colonel Newcombe, the Perfect Gentleman Col.Newcombe - 1920 The Sword of Damocles Jack Moray - 1920 A Gamble in Lives Harry Riggs - 1923 Fires of Innocence Pen Arkwright - 1923 Rogues of the Turf Arthur Somerton - 1924 The Warrens of Virginia Arthur Warren - 1929 The Burgomaster of Stilemonde Lt.

At the 2006 census, Iron Knob and the surrounding area had a population of 199. The town obtained its name from its proximity to large deposits of iron ore, most notably Iron Monarch which outcropped prominently from the relatively flat, surrounding landscape. == Iron ore mining == The name Iron Knob first appeared on pastoral lease maps of 1854, and the first mineral claim in the area was pegged by the Broken Hill Proprietary Company in 1897. Mining commenced in 1900 and iron ore was transported by bullock wagon to Port Augusta then by rail to Whyalla and ship to Port Pirie where it was used as a flux in the lead smelter there. In 1901 the BHP Whyalla Tramway from Iron Knob to Hummock Hill (later renamed Whyalla) was completed, followed by wharves in 1903. These allowed the direct loading of ships which could transport the ore across Spencer Gulf to Port Pirie. Iron Knob's iron ore proved to be of such high quality (upwards of 60% purity) that it led to the development of the Australian steel industry. It supplied iron to Newcastle for and steel works established at Newcastle and Port Kembla in the 1910s and 1920s and Whyalla in the 1930s. The iron ore was transported by the BHP Whyalla Tramway to WhyallaIron Knob Tramway Singleton, C.C. Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin, February, 1942 pp15-17 where it was either smelted or dispatched by sea. 21% of the steel required for the construction of the Sydney Harbour Bridge was quarried at Iron Knob and smelted at Port Kembla, New South Wales. The remaining 79% was imported from England. In the 1920s, iron ore from Iron Knob was exported to the Netherlands and the United States of America. In the 1930s, customers included Germany and the United Kingdom. Prior to World War II, iron ore from Iron Knob was also exported to Japan. In the financial year 1935-36, 291,961 tonnes of ore from Iron Knob was shipped there via the seaport of Whyalla. This became a controversial matter in the late 1930s due in part to Australia's known reserves at the time being limited to Iron Knob and Yampi Sound in Western Australia. Japan was also considered an 'aggressor' nation following acts of war against China in 1937. Waterfront workers and seamen protested against the export of iron ore to Japan, leading to strikes and arrests. In 1937, output from the Middleback Range, mostly from Iron Monarch was estimated at 2 mtpa. In 1939, it was referred to in England as the highest grade deposit of iron ore known in the world. In 1943, the iron Knob deposit was still delivering an average ore grade of 64 percent metallic content. In 1949, 99% of Australian demand for iron ore was met by supply from Iron Knob and associated mines in South Australia, having risen from 95% in 1943. Additional deposits of iron ore were developed by the Broken Hill Proprietary Company further south along the Middleback Range. These include Iron Baron, Iron Prince and Iron Queen (discovered in 1920) and Iron Knight, Iron Duchess and Iron Duke (discovered in 1934). === Mine closure and re-opening === Quarrying for iron at Iron Knob and Iron Monarch ended in 1998. When the quarrying stopped, the town population reduced to 200 and Iron Knob was under threat of becoming a ghost town. However, due to rising prices of housing elsewhere, the town has attracted new residents seeking low cost residences. A home could be purchased for approximately A$35,000–70,000 and vacant land could be purchased for less than A$15,000. In 2010, Onesteel (later Arrium) announced that it would return to Iron Knob to reopen the Iron Monarch mine. The Iron Monarch mine was prepared for reopening by Arrium in 2013. As of 2015, both Iron Monarch and Iron Duke continue to produce iron ore for export and for smelting at the Whyalla Steelworks. == Transport == In the early days of mining at Iron Knob, ironstone was carted by oxen to Hummock Hill (renamed Whyalla in 1914). Approximately 300 tonnes (331 U.S. tons) was delivered in a good week. Construction of a private railway greatly increased transportation rates and by 1939, 9,000 tonnes (9921 U.S. tons) of ore was delivered daily to Whyalla by rail. Later trains carried 2000-tonne (2205 U.S. tons) loads. Ships operated by the BHP Shipping were similarly named Iron This and Iron That, some of which were built by the company at the Whyalla Steelworks. Highway 1 regularly closes due to controlled explosion. == See also == * Iron Baron * Heaviest trains == References  External links == * The Iron Knob Progress Association Website Category:Mining towns in South Australia Category:Eyre Peninsula Category:Iron ore mines in Australia Category:Mining in South Australia Category:Far North (South Australia) Category:Places in the unincorporated areas of South Australia ","title":"Iron Knob"},{"id":"2212499","text":"The Museum of Romani Culture in Brno, Czech Republic The Museum of Romani Culture (Muzeum romské kultury in Czech) is an institution dedicated to the history and culture of the Romani people (Gypsies).

During its early years, its location moved from one place to another and the institution struggled with financial problems. In December 2000, it moved to its present building on Bratislavská Street in Brno, which is the centre of the local Romani community. The museum is now financed from the state budget. On December 1, 2005, the first permanent exhibition was opened. ==Exhibitions== The permanent exhibition covers 6 rooms with an area of 326 m². It is dedicated to the life, culture, and important events of the Romanis during their migration from India until the present day, with emphasis on the situation in Czech lands during the period 1945–1989. Temporary exhibitions, mostly art and photography, are created from time to time. In addition to the exhibitions, the museum is also a place of Romani research in Central Europe.

Ding Zilin said in a telephone interview on October 9, 2006 that she was born in Shanghai on December 20, 1936.) is a retired professor of philosophy and the leader of the political pressure group Tiananmen Mothers. ==Biography== Ding, born in Shanghai on December 20, 1936, was professor of philosophy at Renmin University of China in Beijing.Perry Link, \\"60 years of Asian heroes – Ding Zilin\\", Time Magazine, 2006 Her husband, Jiang Peikun (), was head of the Aesthetics Institute at the university. Ding's seventeen-year-old son, Jiang Jielian, was one of the first to be killedList of the confirmed deaths , Ding Zilin, 89-64.org, accessed May 17, 2007 when the People's Liberation Army crushed the Tiananmen Square protests. He left the family home in defiance of the curfew. Accounts vary of what happened next. Eyewitnesses had told her that her son was shot and was left to bleed to death on the night of June 3, 1989.Staff reporter, \\"Ma Lik didn't experience the massacre\\", Page A3, South China Morning Post, May 16, 2007, retrieved May 23, 2013 Ding says he was shot through the heart by riot police on the way to Tiananmen Square. He was rushed to the Beijing Children's Hospital, where he was pronounced \\"Dead on arrival\\". Following her son's death, Ding said she attempted suicide six times. In August 1989, she met another bereaved mother, and found a commonality within the self-help group, which continued growing.Rebecca MacKinnon, \\"Ding Zilin: an advocate for the dead\\", CNN, June 1999 She formed a network of some 150 other families who had lost sons and daughters during the 1989 Tiananmen massacre, and this group became known as \\"Tiananmen Mothers\\". Ever since that day, she has been asking the government to apologize for the deaths. She and some others have faced imprisonment, house-arrest, phone-tapping and constant surveillance. In 1991, after an interview she gave to ABC News, the government prevented her and her husband from carrying out their work or research, and were barred from publishing domestically. Party membership was revoked. In addition, she was detained for more than 40 days. She was forced into early retirement. Since her release, she was under close supervision by the authorities. Harassment continued when on September 9, 1994, she was arrested in front of the University and held by police for two hours, for having had published an article in the foreign media \\"hurtful to the people\\".Democracy movement activists database , Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements of China, Retrieved May 17, 2007 Again in 1995, she and her husband were arrested in Wuxi on August 18 and incarcerated until September 30, allegedly on \\"economic matters\\", and were denied visitors. In 1996 Ding's husband was forced to retire early. Since February 28, 2000, she has been under 24-hour surveillance by the authorities. In 2004, she and other Tiananmen Mothers were put under house arrest shortly before the 15th anniversary of the massacre to prevent them from holding any public memorial or protest.\\"Fifteenth Anniversary of the Tiananmen Square Massacre\\", World Press, 2004 She was allegedly told by a senior official that a review of the June 4, 1989 crackdown was \\"out of the question.\\" In 2006, Time magazine selected her as one of the 60 Asian heroes. She has been collecting the names of those who were shot dead by the People's Liberation Army in Beijing around June 4, 1989. At the end of June 2006, Ding was able to confirm 186 deaths through her own efforts despite repeated harassment by the authorities. However, upon close inspection of the cause of deaths, not all individuals on Ding's list died directly at the hands of the army. For example, at least one of the individuals on the list had committed suicide after the uprising had been squashed. She and her husband have been under house arrest as of May 24, 2004. On February 8, 2007, she won the Vasyl Stus \\"Freedom-to-Write\\" Award for her book Looking for the June 4 victims. She was ordered to leave Beijing for a forced vacation during the 2008 Summer Olympics. Following the announcement that Liu Xiaobo had won the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize, and his dedication of his prize to those who died in 1989, dissident groups reported on October 18 she and her husband may have been taken into custody by police, and have not been seen or heard from for four days; their phones have been cut off.Agence France-Presse in Beijing (October 18, 2010). \\"Activists condemn anti-Liu crackdown\\", South China Morning Post == Activism == Since her son's death in the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, Ding Zilin has been fighting for justice for the victims. Her activism has drawn international attention and association with recognizable human rights groups such as Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and HRIC (Human Rights in China). New York based human rights watchdog HRIC has been labelled by the Chinese government as a hostile organization.Tong Yi. \\"China’s Latest Theft\\". The New York Times, February 16, 2000. Because of Ding Zilin's efforts Amnesty International has a political campaign to put pressure on the Chinese government to acknowledge and apologize for the deaths of so many citizens. Amnesty applauded the Chinese government in June 2007 for allowing Ding Zilin, her husband and two other dead citizens’ kin to light candles west of Tiananmen Square.\\"Ding’s Story\\" . Amnesty International Canada. Despite the minimal recognition from the government Amnesty urges Chinese authorities to allow open debate and more public memorials in order to help improve Chinas human rights record and the image of Beijing on the international stage. Ding Zilin and human rights groups demand the Chinese government to stop labelling the student protest with political jargon such as “counter-revolutionary rebellion”.Robert Saiget. ‘Tiananmen mothers’ demand open dialogue . The China Post, June 3, 2010. === Organization === Tiananmen Mothers is an activist group of people who lost family members on June fourth. Spearheaded by Ding Zilin they have collected over one hundred names of individuals who openly state that they lost a loved one on that day. Over the past twenty years in public letters published by multiple sources including HRIC, The China Post, The New York Times, Time Magazine and Amnesty International, the Tiananmen Mothers continue to publish a list of demands: * The right to mourn peacefully and in public * The right to accept humanitarian aid from organizations and individuals inside and outside China * No more persecution of June Fourth victims, including those injured in the massacre and the families of the dead * The release of all people still suffering in prison for their role in the 1989 protests * A full, public accounting for the June Fourth Massacre, ending the impunity for the perpetrators of this crimeHuman Rights in China. === Civil Disobedience === Despite her multiple arrests and constant surveillance, civil disobedience is Ding Zilin's daily choice, she never stops using her voice to speak out in non-violent ways against the violations of human rights committed by the Chinese government. On April 5, 2004 Time magazine said that Ding Zilin is “the symbolic leader for many people in China who want the government to account for its actions that night. She is a small woman with a strong voice. Her bereavement makes her powerful”.Susan Jakes. \\"Mother Courage\\". Time Magazine, April 5, 2004 Author of Beijing Coma, Ma Jian also discusses her civil disobedience in a June 4, 2008 New York Times article. He describes how she will once again defy authorities and lay a memorial off Chang'an Avenue.Ma Jian. \\"China’s Grief, Unearthed\\". The New York Times, June 4, 2008. Translated by Flora Drew He suggests “behind the bravado, the party is as fearful as a deer in the headlights,” of displays of support that show that despite government efforts to erase history many refuse to forget. === Statements === In June 2009 in a Newsweek interview with Ding Zilin she condemned the actions and legacy of many historical figures. She questioned why Deng Xiaoping was not brought to justice like the notorious former Cambodian Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot.Melinda Liu. \\"Not an Isolated Incident: Twenty years after her teenage son’s death in Tiananmen Square, Ding Zilin waits for an apology she says will never come\\" . Newsweek, June 2, 2009. Ding Zilin uses her son's story to spread the message of human rights in China and feels it should be a central political issue. She was disappointed when US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said that close Sino-American Relations should not be overshadowed by human rights. She does, however, acknowledge that in 1995 Hillary Clinton helped to get her released from one of her many incarcerations. Ding Zilin condemned former President Bill Clinton for attending a ceremonial red carpet appearance in Tiananmen Square: “With the blood of the students still wet, the wounds still there, unhealed, how could Clinton step onto the red carpet to review Chinese troops?”. Human Rights Watch claims that on May 26, 1994, President Clinton said China had not made significant progress on many of the issues outlined in his 1993 Executive Order, however, a tough human rights policy was hampering the ability of the US to pursue other interests\\"President Clinton's Visit To China In Context\\", Human Rights Watch, Retrieved May 23, 2013 Human rights groups like HRIC, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch describe in their philosophies to be critical of governments gaining international power with bad human rights records. Ding Zilin has dedicated the remainder of her life after her son's death to being a human rights activist. She has most recently spoken out in support of Nobel Peace Prize winner Liu Xiaobo.

While equally recommended for males and females, in modern times, karnavedha has become an uncommon practice amongst males. Karnavedha is considered a vedic rite of passage with symbolic spiritual significance. Some believe that it is intended to open the inner ears for receiving sacred sounds. Hearing of sacred sounds with concentration is considered meritorious in that it cleanses the mind and nurtures the spirit.

He began working as a marble and wood carver, and then gained entrance to the McMicken School of Design in Cincinnati. He studied at the Royal Academy in Munich, Germany (1877–81). The effect of the German study was that he retained much of the Neo-Classical flavor in his art while most other sculptors of his generation were drawn towards Beaux-Arts realism. ==Career== He returned to America in 1881. By virtue of being a native Ohioan, he was commissioned to sculpt two statues of the recently assassinated President Garfield; one for Cincinnati (Garfield's home city), and the other, in another pose, for the National Statuary Hall Collection at the United States Capitol. He moved to Rome, Italy, where he worked on the commissions, and made a study of ancient sculpture. He modeled three major male nudes during his years in Rome, including The Scraper (1883) and Caestus (1883-85). He returned to New York City in 1885, and opened a studio.1911 Encyclopædia Britannica. In 1887, he created a statue of Ohioan William Allen, also for Statuary Hall. In later years, he was to place statues of Oliver P. Morton of Indiana (1900), John J. Ingalls of Kansas (1905), Zachariah Chandler of Michigan (1913), George W. Glick of Kansas (1914), Ephraim McDowell of Kentucky (1929), and Henry Clay of Kentucky (1929) in the collection. His work was also part of the sculpture event in the art competition at the 1932 Summer Olympics. Monuments by Niehaus can be found in many American cities. Several of the works authored by him are equestrian statues. As was the case with other sculptors of his day he also fashioned a fair amount of architectural sculpture. In 1900 Niehaus married noted horticulturalist Regina Armstrong and moved to New Rochelle, New York.

Flessas (born June 2, 1959 in Miami, Florida), is the birth name of American actor Michael Flessas, who is of Greek ancestry. Flessas' most notable film role was Angry Man in the Cannes Film Festival 2000 Palme d'Or winning film Dancer in the Dark directed by Danish film director Lars von Trier. Originally, the director himself considered playing the role but, instead, the role was given to Flessas. Dancer in the Dark starred Icelandic singer/actress Björk who won the Best Actress award at Cannes for her role. French film icon, César Award winner, and Academy Award nominee Catherine Deneuve, and other noteworthy artists such as Academy Award and Tony Award winner Joel Grey, Peter Stormare, David Morse, and Stellan Skarsgård also performed in the multiple prize winning film. One of Björk's songs for the film received an Academy Award nomination for Best Song. In Iranian actress/director Susan Taslimi's film Hus i helvete (The film's English title: All Hell Let Loose), starring Melinda Kinnaman, which won the Best Feature Film prize at the Brooklyn International Film Festival in 2003, Flessas played the vicious pornographer \\"Videomannen\\" in a nightmarish flashback scene in the film. Flessas also portrayed massive and deadly Russian hitman \\"Jurij Rostoff\\" in Beck - Okänd avsändare, a made for television movie directed by Swedish actor and director Harald Hamrell. Beck - Okänd avsändare was among the popular Swedish Beck detective films and made-for-television movies starring Swedish actor Peter Haber. As \\"Jurij Rostoff\\" Flessas weighed in at 150 kilos in the role as a result of weight training and diet; however, in his younger and less heavy years, Flessas danced in the corps de ballet of the Columbia City Ballet then under the direction of Ann Brodie in Columbia, South Carolina. Although he won two scholarships in Music, Flessas changed majors and majored in Religious Studies and minored in Philosophy at the University of South Carolina. Flessas did not complete his undergraduate degree at the University of South Carolina yet he continued his studies on an informal basis with travels around the world in order to meet and speak with adherents of various religious forms and philosophical points of view. Flessas began his professional acting career after hearing a barber mention that a :Fox Broadcasting Company series in Boston was about to begin production. Although the series, Against the Law starring Academy award nominee Michael O'Keefe lasted for one season, Flessas was in six episodes of the show as an uncredited extra. Flessas was able to do six episodes by constantly changing his facial appearance for each episode of the series. Flessas also was an uncredited extra in films such as HouseSitter, starring Emmy Award winner Steve Martin and Academy Award winner Goldie Hawn, :Wind, starring Academy Award winner Cliff Robertson, Matthew Modine, and Jennifer Grey, and the NBC made for television movie MacShayne: Final Roll of the Dice starring Grammy Award winner Kenny Rogers. Flessas also gained notoriety in the mid-1990s for his creation of a now defunct website entitled \\"Resources for the Homeless\\" which was one of the first websites in the United States of America solely devoted to helping the homeless through individual initiative by offering the homeless relevant data on resources via one website. At the time, many poor people were being removed from Milwaukee, Wisconsin welfare rolls while many Milwaukee city officials were engaged in plans to fund and build a new multimillion-dollar stadium. Flessas perceived the situation (building a new stadium while removing the poor from welfare) as an injustice to the poor. Given that libraries in Milwaukee, Wisconsin were just connecting to the World Wide Web, Flessas gathered and placed information regarding all the services available to the homeless in Milwaukee on the web so service providers to the homeless and the homeless themselves (who often sought shelter in local libraries) had equal and rapid access to information about resources available in Milwaukee via the Milwaukee County library system computer network \\"OMNINET\\". \\"Resources for the Homeless\\" was considered an unusual information delivery solution at the time given the new nature of the method of delivery and the biased misperception that the homeless did not and would not use computers to learn about resources available. The \\"Resources for the Homeless\\" project in Milwaukee received no direct funding for it was Flessas' express purpose to show what one person with computing skills could do to help the homeless with the use of the web. The project began in Milwaukee on a freenet and, later, a similar site was created with the help of a local web designer in Columbia, South Carolina. Flessas' exploits with the site were reported on television in Milwaukee, WIS television in Columbia, and in an article in Silicon Valley's San Jose Mercury News newspaper. In a newspaper article in Columbia South Carolina's The State newspaper, Flessas promoted the use of e-mail in the 1990s to broadcast a demand (then akin to what is now guerrilla communication and subvertising) that thousands of potential visitors to South Carolina boycott the state's multimillion-dollar tourism industry to force state government officials to remove the Confederate flag from South Carolina's State House dome. (Flessas, curiously enough, through his mother's side of the family, is a descendant of Elisha Jefferson \\"Elijah\\" Sutherland who fought with the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War.) Social and political activism is not unknown in the Flessas Family for Flessas himself (through his father's side of the family) is also a direct descendant of Papaflessas through Papaflessas' father Demetrios Flessas. Micheal Christian Flessas, as he is now called, is now living in the city Katrineholm in Sweden. ==See also== *List of people from Miami ==External links== * Category:1959 births Category:People from Miami Category:American male film actors Category:University of South Carolina alumni Category:American people of Greek descent Category:Living people Category:Male actors of Greek descent ","title":"Michael Flessas"},{"id":"2212520","text":"The United National South West Party (, ) was a political party in South West Africa, the local counterpart of the United Party (South Africa) but founded eight years earlier and merged into the latter in 1971. It was formed through a merger of National Party of South West Africa and the South West Party, in order to counter the influence of the German League in South West Africa. The first congress of UNSWP was held in Windhoek on 1–2 April 1927. The UNSWP favoured incorporation of South West Africa into South Africa, and won elections to the Legislative Assembly elections in 1929, 1934, 1940 and 1945.Elections in Namibia African Elections Database With the coming of the National Party of South West Africa in the late 1930s, some Afrikaners switched loyalties to the new party. Meanwhile, after 1939 the policy of the UNSWP tended to follow Gen. Smuts instead of Gen. Hertzog, in part because of the fear of a new German interest in the territory. It continued to control the Legislative Assembly until 1950, at which point it held fifteen of the eighteen seats. But the National Party had won control in South Africa in 1948, and in 1950 elections in Namibia the National Party won sixteen seats while the UNSWP retained only two (which it lost in 1966). However, they continued running for the six local seats in the House of Assembly of South Africa in five South African general elections, in 1953, 1958, 1961, 1966, and 1970. Despite good organization and the support of over 40% of South-West Africans in the first three of those elections, the party never succeeded in sending a single representative to the House of Assembly. The main publication of UNSWP was the newspaper Die Suidwes Afrikaner. == Origin == The United Party started under very different circumstances in South-West Africa from those from which it sprang in Union of South Africa. Under the terms of the South-West Africa Constitution Act of 1925, the South African Parliament granted a Legislative Assembly to the mandate area, conditioning the informal politics of the region's white settlers along more conventional partisan lines. The Germans organized into the German League in South West Africa(German: Deutscher Bund in Südwestafrika, DBSW), while Afrikaners were divided between the local National Party (South Africa) (NPSWA) and the South West Party (SWP, a local counterpart of the South African Party in the Union). The SWP formed a coalition with the NPSWA in the 1926 legislative election but lost to the DBSW. The SWP and NSWA thus were compelled to merge into the UNSWP on January 31, 1927. Campaigning on economic progress and annexation to South Africa, the coalition won the 1929 election. == Rise of the NP == World War II robbed the DBSW of its influence and thus undermined the UNSWP's raison d'être. The local National Party was re-founded there, but struggled until its Union election triumph in 1948. Prime Minister Daniel Malan passed legislation making the growing region the Union of South Africa's fifth province, and that year the NP won six local seats in the House of Assembly, both local Senate seats, and 15 out of 18 constituencies in the Legislative Assembly. The UNSWP eventually lost the other three Legislative Assembly seats, but the party remained vibrant locally under the leadership of J.P. de M. Niehaus, who was nominated as Senator for Natal by the national United Party as a reward for his work. On November 16, 1971, the UNSWP was merged into the United Party of South Africa (UP) as a provincial party. Senator Niehaus was elected chairman of the South West Africa United Party. He lost his Natal seat when the Senate was reorganized after the April 1974 South African general election. == 1950 election == Malan wanted to build upon his parliamentary majority after the NP's narrow victory in the 1948 South African general election, and therefore was keen on following in the footsteps of his predecessor Jan Smuts, who had already advocated for South West African representation in Parliament. Thus, in 1949 South West Africa was assigned six seats in the House of Assembly and four in the Senate (two Senators elected, two appointed). The South West African seats averaged half the population compared to those in the Union proper. With this legislation, Malan made South West Africa in effect the fifth province in the Union, defying the 1946 United Nations agreement with Smuts that forbade such annexation. The six Assembly seats were Windhoek (constituency), Namib (constituency), Karas (constituency), Etosha (constituency), Midelland (constituency), and Omaruru (constituency). The Legislative Assembly, which had included some appointed members, was transformed into one where all 18 representatives were elected. The UP, though in principle supportive of representation for South West Africa, opposed the high number of seats relative to the local white population but did not wish to alienate local voters by opposing it strongly, and hoped its leaders' role in occupying the former German colony in 1915 would work in its favor. The 1950 South West African legislative election was thus held. The incumbent UP local government had always resisted efforts to place South West Africa under UN trusteeship, but nevertheless agreed to submit annual reports to the UN. After the NP harshly criticized the first report, the UP decided to stop filing them. In 1949, the UN approached the World Court for an advisory opinion on the Union's treatment of the area. The majority verdict of the court in July 1950 stated that while the Union was not obliged to submit the area to full UN administration, it was still to be overseen along the lines of the old League of Nations mandate. The international controversy over South West Africa gave the NP ample motivation to oppose the UNSWP, but the latter nonetheless had so far prevailed with the support of the South African opposition. The NP slogan held that they would not throw the territory \\"to the wolves.\\" In contrast to South Africa in 1948 and 1953, most voters supported the NP (12,434 or 55.4%) over the UNSWP (10,003 or 44.6%), padding the federal upper house majority for the NP nationally and winning a comfortable 13 seats in the Union People's Council. In all six seats, except for Etosha where the NP won by 846, the UNSWPNP only narrowly won winning by 67 votes in Karas, 229 in Middelland, 441 in Namib, 584 in Omaruru, and 234 in Windhoek. == Later elections == From 1953 onward, South West African and South African elections coincided. In 1953, the NP won locally 13,305 votes (56.6%) to the UNSWP's 10,021 (42.6%), winning Assembly seats by 1,205 votes in Etosha, 238 votes in Karas, 272 in Middelland, 554 in Namib, 826 in Omaruru, and 189 in Windhoek. In 1958, the NP won locally 16,390 votes (58.2%) to the UNSWP's 11,568 (41.1%), by a margin of 1,334 votes in Etosha, 449 votes in Karas, 604 in Middelland, 689 in Namib, 1,204 in Omaruru, and 506 in Windhoek. The UNSWP gradually declined and in 1970, the last election in which it participated, only contested four of the six Assembly seats and 28.8% of the vote. == See also == Andries de Wet == Bibliography == * Böeseken, Dr. A.J., Krüger, Dr. D.W., and Kieser, Dr. A. 1953.

Infrared absorption spectrum of type IaB diamond. (1) region of nitrogen impurities absorption (here mostly due to the B-centers), (2) platelets peak, (3) self-absorption of diamond lattice, (4) hydrogen peaks at 3107 and 3237 cm−1 Imperfections in the crystal lattice of diamond are common. Such crystallographic defects in diamond may be the result of lattice irregularities or extrinsic substitutional or interstitial impurities, introduced during or after the diamond growth. The defects affect the material properties of diamond and determine to which type a diamond is assigned; the most dramatic effects are on the diamond color and electrical conductivity, as explained by the electronic band structure. The defects can be detected by different types of spectroscopy, including electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), luminescence induced by light (photoluminescence, PL) or electron beam (cathodoluminescence, CL), and absorption of light in the infrared (IR), visible and UV parts of the spectrum. The absorption spectrum is used not only to identify the defects, but also to estimate their concentration; it can also distinguish natural from synthetic or enhanced diamonds. ==Labeling of diamond centers== There is a tradition in diamond spectroscopy to label a defect-induced spectrum by a numbered acronym (e.g. GR1). This tradition has been followed in general with some notable deviations, such as A, B and C centers. Many acronyms are confusing though: *Some symbols are too similar (e.g., 3H and H3). *Accidentally, the same labels were given to different centers detected by EPR and optical techniques (e.g., N3 EPR center and N3 optical center have no relation). *Whereas some acronyms are logical, such as N3 (N for natural, i.e. observed in natural diamond) or H3 (H for heated, i.e. observed after irradiation and heating), many are not. In particular, there is no clear distinction between the meaning of labels GR (general radiation), R (radiation) and TR (type-II radiation). ==Defect symmetry== The symmetry of defects in crystals is described by the point groups. They differ from the space groups describing the symmetry of crystals by absence of translations, and thus are much fewer in number. In diamond, only defects of the following symmetries have been observed thus far: tetrahedral (Td), tetragonal (D2d), trigonal (D3d, C3v), rhombic (C2v), monoclinic (C2h, C1h, C2) and triclinic (C1 or CS). The defect symmetry allows predicting many optical properties. For example, one-phonon (infrared) absorption in pure diamond lattice is forbidden because the lattice has an inversion center. However, introducing any defect (even \\"very symmetrical\\", such as N-N substitutional pair) breaks the crystal symmetry resulting in defect-induced infrared absorption, which is the most common tool to measure the defect concentrations in diamond. In synthetic diamond grown by the high-pressure high-temperature synthesis or chemical vapor deposition, defects with symmetry lower than tetrahedral align to the direction of the growth. Such alignment has also been observed in gallium arsenide and thus is not unique to diamond. ==Extrinsic defects== Various elemental analyses of diamond reveal a wide range of impurities. They mostly originate, however, from inclusions of foreign materials in diamond, which could be nanometer-small and invisible in an optical microscope. Also, virtually any element can be hammered into diamond by ion implantation. More essential are elements that can be introduced into the diamond lattice as isolated atoms (or small atomic clusters) during the diamond growth. By 2008, those elements are nitrogen, boron, hydrogen, silicon, phosphorus, nickel, cobalt and perhaps sulfur. Manganese and tungsten have been unambiguously detected in diamond, but they might originate from foreign inclusions. Detection of isolated iron in diamond has later been re-interpreted in terms of micro-particles of ruby produced during the diamond synthesis. Oxygen is believed to be a major impurity in diamond, but it has not been spectroscopically identified in diamond yet. Two electron paramagnetic resonance centers (OK1 and N3) have been assigned to nitrogen–oxygen complexes. However, the assignment is indirect and the corresponding concentrations are rather low (few parts per million). ===Nitrogen=== The most common impurity in diamond is nitrogen, which can comprise up to 1% of a diamond by mass. Previously, all lattice defects in diamond were thought to be the result of structural anomalies; later research revealed nitrogen to be present in most diamonds and in many different configurations. Most nitrogen enters the diamond lattice as a single atom (i.e. nitrogen-containing molecules dissociate before incorporation), however, molecular nitrogen incorporates into diamond as well. Absorption of light and other material properties of diamond are highly dependent upon nitrogen content and aggregation state. Although all aggregate configurations cause absorption in the infrared, diamonds containing aggregated nitrogen are usually colorless, i.e. have little absorption in the visible spectrum. The four main nitrogen forms are as follows: Schematic of the C center C-nitrogen center The C center corresponds to electrically neutral single substitutional nitrogen atoms in the diamond lattice. These are easily seen in electron paramagnetic resonance spectra (in which they are confusingly called P1 centers). C centers impart a deep yellow to brown color; these diamonds are classed as type Ib and are commonly known as \\"canary diamonds\\", which are rare in gem form. Most synthetic diamonds produced by high-pressure high-temperature (HPHT) technique contain a high level of nitrogen in the C form; nitrogen impurity originates from the atmosphere or from the graphite source. One nitrogen atom per 100,000 carbon atoms will produce yellow color.Nassau, Kurt (1980) \\"Gems made by man\\" Gemological Institute of America, Santa Monica, California, , p. 191 Because the nitrogen atoms have five available electrons (one more than the carbon atoms they replace), they act as \\"deep donors\\"; that is, each substituting nitrogen has an extra electron to donate and forms a donor energy level within the band gap. Light with energy above ~2.2 eV can excite the donor electrons into the conduction band, resulting in the yellow color. The C center produces a characteristic infrared absorption spectrum with a sharp peak at 1344 cm−1 and a broader feature at 1130 cm−1. Absorption at those peaks is routinely used to measure the concentration of single nitrogen.I. Kiflawi et al. \\"Infrared-absorption by the single nitrogen and a defect centers in diamond\\" Philos. Mag. B 69 (1994) 1141 Another proposed way, using the UV absorption at ~260 nm, has later been discarded as unreliable. Acceptor defects in diamond ionize the fifth nitrogen electron in the C center converting it into C+ center. The latter has a characteristic IR absorption spectrum with a sharp peak at 1332 cm−1 and broader and weaker peaks at 1115, 1046 and 950 cm−1. Schematic of the A center A-nitrogen center The A center is probably the most common defect in natural diamonds. It consists of a neutral nearest- neighbor pair of nitrogen atoms substituting for the carbon atoms. The A center produces UV absorption threshold at ~4 eV (310 nm, i.e. invisible to eye) and thus causes no coloration. Diamond containing nitrogen predominantly in the A form as classed as type IaA. The A center is diamagnetic, but if ionized by UV light or deep acceptors, it produces an electron paramagnetic resonance spectrum W24, whose analysis unambiguously proves the N=N structure. The A center shows an IR absorption spectrum with no sharp features, which is distinctly different from that of the C or B centers. Its strongest peak at 1282 cm−1 is routinely used to estimate the nitrogen concentration in the A form. Schematic of the B center B-nitrogen center There is a general consensus that B center (sometimes called B1) consists of a carbon vacancy surrounded by four nitrogen atoms substituting for carbon atoms. This model is consistent with other experimental results, but there is no direct spectroscopic data corroborating it. Diamonds where most nitrogen forms B centers are rare and are classed as type IaB; most gem diamonds contain a mixture of A and B centers, together with N3 centers. Similar to the A centers, B centers do not induce color, and no UV or visible absorption can be attributed to the B centers. Early assignment of the N9 absorption system to the B center have been disproven later. The B center has a characteristic IR absorption spectrum (see the infrared absorption picture above) with a sharp peak at 1332 cm−1 and a broader feature at 1280 cm−1. The latter is routinely used to estimate the nitrogen concentration in the B form. Note that many optical peaks in diamond accidentally have similar spectral positions, which causes much confusion among gemologists. Spectroscopists use the whole spectrum rather than one peak for defect identification and consider the history of the growth and processing of individual diamond. Schematic of the N3 center N3 nitrogen center The N3 center consists of three nitrogen atoms surrounding a vacancy. Its concentration is always just a fraction of the A and B centers.Anderson, B.; Payne, J.; Mitchell, R.K. (ed.) (1998) \\"The spectroscope and gemology\\", p. 215, Robert Hale Limited, Clerkwood House, London. The N3 center is paramagnetic, so its structure is well justified from the analysis of the EPR spectrum P2. This defect produces a characteristic absorption and luminescence line at 415 nm and thus does not induce color on its own. However, the N3 center is always accompanied by the N2 center, having an absorption line at 478 nm (and no luminescence). As a result, diamonds rich in N3/N2 centers are yellow in color. ===Boron=== Diamonds containing boron as a substitutional impurity are termed type IIb. Only one percent of natural diamonds are of this type, and most are blue to grey.O'Donoghue, M. (2002) \\"Synthetic, imitation & treated gemstones\\", Elsevier Butterworth-Heinemann, Great Britain. , p. 52 Boron is an acceptor in diamond: boron atoms have one less available electron than the carbon atoms; therefore, each boron atom substituting for a carbon atom creates an electron hole in the band gap that can accept an electron from the valence band. This allows red light absorption, and due to the small energy (0.37 eV) needed for the electron to leave the valence band, holes can be thermally released from the boron atoms to the valence band even at room temperatures. These holes can move in an electric field and render the diamond electrically conductive (i.e., a p-type semiconductor). Very few boron atoms are required for this to happen—a typical ratio is one boron atom per 1,000,000 carbon atoms. Boron- doped diamonds transmit light down to ~250 nm and absorb some red and infrared light (hence the blue color); they may phosphoresce blue after exposure to shortwave ultraviolet light. Apart from optical absorption, boron acceptors have been detected by electron paramagnetic resonance. ===Phosphorus=== Phosphorus could be intentionally introduced into diamond grown by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) at concentrations up to ~0.01%. Phosphorus substitutes carbon in the diamond lattice. Similar to nitrogen, phosphorus has one more electron than carbon and thus acts as a donor; however, the ionization energy of phosphorus (0.6 eV) is much smaller than that of nitrogen (1.7 eV) and is small enough for room-temperature thermal ionization. This important property of phosphorus in diamond favors electronic applications, such as UV light- emitting diodes (LEDs, at 235 nm). ===Hydrogen=== Hydrogen is one of the most technological important impurities in semiconductors, including diamond. Hydrogen-related defects are very different in natural diamond and in synthetic diamond films. Those films are produced by various chemical vapor deposition (CVD) techniques in an atmosphere rich in hydrogen (typical hydrogen/carbon ratio >100), under strong bombardment of growing diamond by the plasma ions. As a result, CVD diamond is always rich in hydrogen and lattice vacancies. In polycrystalline films, much of the hydrogen may be located at the boundaries between diamond 'grains', or in non-diamond carbon inclusions. Within the diamond lattice itself, hydrogen-vacancy and hydrogen- nitrogen-vacancy complexes have been identified in negative charge states by electron paramagnetic resonance. In addition, numerous hydrogen-related IR absorption peaks are documented. It is experimentally demonstrated that hydrogen passivates electrically active boron and phosphorus impurities. As a result of such passivation, shallow donor centers are presumably produced. In natural diamonds, several hydrogen-related IR absorption peaks are commonly observed; the strongest ones are located at 1405, 3107 and 3237 cm−1 (see IR absorption figure above). The microscopic structure of the corresponding defects is yet unknown and it is not even certain whether or not those defects originate in diamond or in foreign inclusions. Gray color in some diamonds from the Argyle mine in Australia is often associated with those hydrogen defects, but again, this assignment is yet unproven. ===Nickel, cobalt and chromium=== When diamonds are grown by the high-pressure high-temperature technique, nickel, cobalt, chromium or some other metals are usually added into the growth medium to facilitate catalytically the conversion of graphite into diamond. As a result, metallic inclusions are formed. Besides, isolated nickel and cobalt atoms incorporate into diamond lattice, as demonstrated through characteristic hyperfine structure in electron paramagnetic resonance, optical absorption and photoluminescence spectra, and the concentration of isolated nickel can reach 0.01%. This fact is by all means unusual considering the large difference in size between carbon and transition metal atoms and the superior rigidity of the diamond lattice. Numerous Ni-related defects have been detected by electron paramagnetic resonance, optical absorption and photoluminescence, both in synthetic and natural diamonds. Three major structures can be distinguished: substitutional Ni, nickel-vacancy and nickel- vacancy complex decorated by one or more substitutional nitrogen atoms. The \\"nickel-vacancy\\" structure, also called \\"semi-divacancy\\" is specific for most large impurities in diamond and silicon (e.g., tin in silicon). Its production mechanism is generally accepted as follows: large nickel atom incorporates substitutionally, then expels a nearby carbon (creating a neighboring vacancy), and shifts in-between the two sites. Although the physical and chemical properties of cobalt and nickel are rather similar, the concentrations of isolated cobalt in diamond are much smaller than those of nickel (parts per billion range). Several defects related to isolated cobalt have been detected by electron paramagnetic resonance and photoluminescence, but their structure is yet unknown. A chromium-related optical center has been detected in diamond after ion implantation and subsequent annealing. ===Silicon, germanium, tin and lead === The semi-divacancy (impurity-vacancy) model for a large impurity in diamond (Ni, Co, Si, S, etc.), where a large pink impurity atom substitutes for two carbon atoms. Details on bonding with the diamond lattice are uncertain. Silicon is a common impurity in diamond films grown by chemical vapor deposition and it originates either from silicon substrate or from silica windows or walls of the CVD reactor. It was also observed in natural diamonds in dispersed form. Isolated silicon defects have been detected in diamond lattice through the sharp optical absorption peak at 738 nm and electron paramagnetic resonance. Similar to other large impurities, the major form of silicon in diamond has been identified with a Si-vacancy complex (semi-divacancy site). This center is a deep donor having an ionization energy of 2 eV, and thus again is unsuitable for electronic applications. Si-vacancies constitute minor fraction of total silicon. It is believed (though no proof exists) that much silicon substitutes for carbon thus becoming invisible to most spectroscopic techniques because silicon and carbon atoms have the same configuration of the outer electronic shells. Germanium, tin and lead are normally absent in diamond, but they can be introduced during the growth or by subsequent ion implantation. Those impurities can be detected optically via the germanium-vacancy, tin-vacancy and lead-vacancy centers, respectively, which have similar properties to those of the Si-vacancy center. Similar to N-V centers, Si-V, Ge-V, Sn-V and Pb-V complexes all have potential applications in quantum computing. ===Sulfur=== Around the year 2000, there was a wave of attempts to dope synthetic CVD diamond films by sulfur aiming at n-type conductivity with low activation energy. Successful reports have been published, but then dismissed as the conductivity was rendered p-type instead of n-type and associated not with sulfur, but with residual boron, which is a highly efficient p-type dopant in diamond. So far (2009), there is only one reliable evidence (through hyperfine interaction structure in electron paramagnetic resonance) for isolated sulfur defects in diamond. The corresponding center called W31 has been observed in natural type-Ib diamonds in small concentrations (parts per million). It was assigned to a sulfur-vacancy complex – again, as in case of nickel and silicon, a semi-divacancy site. ==Intrinsic defects== The easiest way to produce intrinsic defects in diamond is by displacing carbon atoms through irradiation with high-energy particles, such as alpha (helium), beta (electrons) or gamma particles, protons, neutrons, ions, etc. The irradiation can occur in the laboratory or in nature (see Diamond enhancement – Irradiation); it produces primary defects named Frenkel defects (carbon atoms knocked off their normal lattice sites to interstitial sites) and remaining lattice vacancies. An important difference between the vacancies and interstitials in diamond is that whereas interstitials are mobile during the irradiation, even at liquid nitrogen temperatures, however vacancies start migrating only at temperatures ~700 °C. Vacancies and interstitials can also be produced in diamond by plastic deformation, though in much smaller concentrations. ===Isolated carbon interstitial=== Model of the carbon split- interstitial in diamond Isolated interstitial has never been observed in diamond and is considered unstable. Its interaction with a regular carbon lattice atom produces a \\"split-interstitial\\", a defect where two carbon atoms share a lattice site and are covalently bonded with the carbon neighbors. This defect has been thoroughly characterized by electron paramagnetic resonance (R2 center) and optical absorption, and unlike most other defects in diamond, it does not produce photoluminescence. ===Interstitial complexes=== One of the configurations of the carbon di-interstitials in diamond The isolated split- interstitial moves through the diamond crystal during irradiation. When it meets other interstitials it aggregates into larger complexes of two and three split-interstitials, identified by electron paramagnetic resonance (R1 and O3 centers), optical absorption and photoluminescence. ===Vacancy-interstitial complexes=== Most high-energy particles, beside displacing carbon atom from the lattice site, also pass it enough surplus energy for a rapid migration through the lattice. However, when relatively gentle gamma irradiation is used, this extra energy is minimal. Thus the interstitials remain near the original vacancies and form vacancy-interstitials pairs identified through optical absorption. Vacancy-di-interstitial pairs have been also produced, though by electron irradiation and through a different mechanism: Individual interstitials migrate during the irradiation and aggregate to form di- interstitials; this process occurs preferentially near the lattice vacancies. ===Isolated vacancy=== Pure diamonds, before and after irradiation and annealing. Clockwise from left bottom: 1) Initial (2×2 mm) 2–4) Irradiated by different doses of 2-MeV electrons 5–6) Irradiated by different doses and annealed at 800 °C. Isolated vacancy is the most studied defect in diamond, both experimentally and theoretically. Its most important practical property is optical absorption, like in the color centers, which gives diamond green, or sometimes even green–blue color (in pure diamond). The characteristic feature of this absorption is a series of sharp lines called GR1-8, where GR1 line at 741 nm is the most prominent and important. The vacancy behaves as a deep electron donor/acceptor, whose electronic properties depend on the charge state. The energy level for the +/0 states is at 0.6 eV and for the 0/- states is at 2.5 eV above the valence band. ===Multivacancy complexes=== Upon annealing of pure diamond at ~700 °C, vacancies migrate and form divacancies, characterized by optical absorption and electron paramagnetic resonance. Similar to single interstitials, divacancies do not produce photoluminescence. Divacancies, in turn, anneal out at ~900 °C creating multivacancy chains detected by EPR and presumably hexavacancy rings. The latter should be invisible to most spectroscopies, and indeed, they have not been detected thus far. Annealing of vacancies changes diamond color from green to yellow-brown. Similar mechanism (vacancy aggregation) is also believed to cause brown color of plastically deformed natural diamonds. ===Dislocations=== Dislocations are the most common structural defect in natural diamond. The two major types of dislocations are the glide set, in which bonds break between layers of atoms with different indices (those not lying directly above each other) and the shuffle set, in which the breaks occur between atoms of the same index. The dislocations produce dangling bonds which introduce energy levels into the band gap, enabling the absorption of light.Kolodzie, A.T. and Bleloch, A.L. Investigation of band gap energy states at dislocations in natural diamond. Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge; Cambridge, England. Broadband blue photoluminescence has been reliably identified with dislocations by direct observation in an electron microscope, however, it was noted that not all dislocations are luminescent, and there is no correlation between the dislocation type and the parameters of the emission. ===Platelets=== Electron micrograph of platelets in diamond viewed normal to the cubic axis. Image width 1.5 µm Most natural diamonds contain extended planar defects in the <100> lattice planes, which are called platelets. Their size ranges from nanometers to many micrometers, and large ones are easily observed in an optical microscope via their luminescence. For a long time, platelets were tentatively associated with large nitrogen complexes — nitrogen sinks produced as a result of nitrogen aggregation at high temperatures of the diamond synthesis. However, the direct measurement of nitrogen in the platelets by EELS (an analytical technique of electron microscopy) revealed very little nitrogen. The currently accepted model of platelets is a large regular array of carbon interstitials. Platelets produce sharp absorption peaks at 1359–1375 and 330 cm−1 in IR absorption spectra; remarkably, the position of the first peak depends on the platelet size. As with dislocations, a broad photoluminescence centered at ~1000 nm was associated with platelets by direct observation in an electron microscope. By studying this luminescence, it was deduced that platelets have a \\"bandgap\\" of ~1.7 eV. ===Voidites=== Electron micrograph showing several octahedral voidites Voidites are octahedral nanometer-sized clusters present in many natural diamonds, as revealed by electron microscopy. Laboratory experiments demonstrated that annealing of type-IaB diamond at high temperatures and pressures (>2600 °C) results in break-up of the platelets and formation of dislocation loops and voidites, i.e. that voidites are a result of thermal degradation of platelets. Contrary to platelets, voidites do contain much nitrogen, in the molecular form. ==Interaction between intrinsic and extrinsic defects== Extrinsic and intrinsic defects can interact producing new defect complexes. Such interaction usually occurs if a diamond containing extrinsic defects (impurities) is either plastically deformed or is irradiated and annealed. Schematic of the H3 and H2 centers Most important is the interaction of vacancies and interstitials with nitrogen. Carbon interstitials react with substitutional nitrogen producing a bond-centered nitrogen interstitial showing strong IR absorption at 1450 cm−1. Vacancies are efficiently trapped by the A, B and C nitrogen centers. The trapping rate is the highest for the C centers, 8 times lower for the A centers and 30 times lower for the B centers. The C center (single nitrogen) by trapping a vacancy forms the famous nitrogen-vacancy center, which can be neutral or negatively charged; the negatively charged state has potential applications in quantum computing. A and B centers upon trapping a vacancy create corresponding 2N-V (H3 and H2 centers, where H2 is simply a negatively charged H3 center) and the neutral 4N-2V (H4 center). The H2, H3 and H4 centers are important because they are present in many natural diamonds and their optical absorption can be strong enough to alter the diamond color (H3 or H4 – yellow, H2 – green). Boron interacts with carbon interstitials forming a neutral boron–interstitial complex with a sharp optical absorption at 0.552 eV (2250 nm). No evidence is known so far (2009) for complexes of boron and vacancy. In contrast, silicon does react with vacancies, creating the described above optical absorption at 738 nm. The assumed mechanism is trapping of migrating vacancy by substitutional silicon resulting in the Si-V (semi-divacancy) configuration. A similar mechanism is expected for nickel, for which both substitutional and semi-divacancy configurations are reliably identified (see subsection \\"nickel and cobalt\\" above). In an unpublished study, diamonds rich in substitutional nickel were electron irradiated and annealed, with following careful optical measurements performed after each annealing step, but no evidence for creation or enhancement of Ni-vacancy centers was obtained. ==See also== *Chemical vapor deposition of diamond *Crystallographic defect *Diamond color *Diamond enhancement *Gemstone irradiation *Material properties of diamond *Nitrogen- vacancy center *Synthetic diamond ==References== Category:Diamond Category:Crystallographic defects ","title":"Crystallographic defects in diamond"},{"id":"2212566","text":"Pia () is a commune in the Pyrénées-Orientales department in southern France. == Geography == Pia is located in the canton of La Côte Salanquaise and in the arrondissement of Perpignan.

(香港消防處總部大樓) Dennis Sabre vehicle. ==History== Flag of Fire Services Department before 1997. Note the use of the British Crown Badge of Fire Services Department before 1997. The history of the Hong Kong Fire Service began in the Government Gazette dated 9 May 1868. Charles May became the first Superintendent of the Fire Brigade. At the time, the Fire Department was part of the Hong Kong Police Force in 1846. It had a total strength of 62 with a supplement of 100 Chinese volunteers. The fire department expanded to 140 members during the 1920s. During the Japanese Occupation during the World War II, the Service disbanded. The two fire engines were exported to Tokyo to become part of the Imperial Palace Fire Unit. It was only returned after the War. Unlike Canada, UK and some countries, Hong Kong's ambulance service is tied directly with the Fire Department. At that time all emergency ambulance service was provided by the Fire Service while non-emergency was handled by the Medical Corps. In 1950 the Auxiliary Fire Service Unit was created to establish the Hong Kong Auxiliary Fire Brigade to provide additional manpower to regular fire brigade members under the Essential Services (Auxiliary Fire Service) Corps Regulations. In 1953, this policy was changed and all Medical Corps vehicles and crew were transferred to the Fire Service. Thus, leading to the creation to the present Ambulance Command. Over the past 50 years it has grown to accommodate 30 ambulance depots, 240 ambulances, 35 motorcycles and 2,350 uniformed staff. ==Overview== The department has 9,351 (8,675 uniformed and 676 civilian) members. It is organised into seven commands － three operational commands, a Licensing and Certification Command, a Fire Safety Command, an Ambulance Command and a Headquarters Command. They are supported by an Administration Division. Commanding the department is the Director of Fire Services. ==Organisational structureFire and special services=== Fire-fighting, rescue and other emergency services are undertaken by the three operational commands － Hong Kong (including marine and off-shore islands), Kowloon and the New Territories. There are 81 fire stations across Hong Kong's 3 operational commands. In 2004, they responded to 35,092 fire calls and 20,059 special service calls. Careless handling or disposal of cigarette ends, matches and candles remained the major causes of fires, followed by incidents involving the preparation of food and electrical faults. Fires claimed nine lives and 451 injuries in 2004. Of the injured, 46 were Fire Services personnel. Special service calls cover a wide range of incidents, including traffic and industrial accidents, gas leakages, landslides, flooding, house collapses, attempts by people to jump from a height and malfunctioning lifts. In 2004, 717 people died and 1,995 others were injured in such incidents. One of the dead and 16 of the injured were Fire Services personnel. The department has 835 operational appliances and vehicles fitted with up-to-date fire- fighting and rescue equipment. The first-line appliances, basically comprising major pumps, hydraulic platforms, light rescue units and turntable ladders/snorkels, are supported where necessary by other special appliances/equipment. A fleet of eight fireboats, including two command boats, one diving support vessel and two diving support speedboats provide fire protection and rescue services within Hong Kong ===Ambulance services=== A Fire Services ambulance. The Ambulance Command operates from 38 depots with 2,350 uniformed staff. The services fleet consists of 268 ambulances, four village ambulances, four mobile casualty treatment centres and 35 paramedic motorcycles. All motorcycles and ambulances are equipped with paramedic facilities to provide paramedic care. In 2004, the Command responded to 574,901 calls, conveying a total of 521,127 patients or casualties to hospitals/clinics, or an average of 1 575 calls a day. There were 106 cases of ambulance personnel sustaining injury whilst on active duty in 2004. Front- line firemen are also trained as first-responders to provide basic life support to casualties and patients before the arrival of an ambulance crew. So far, first-responders are available in 81 fire stations. ===Communications=== The Fire Services Communication Centre (FSCC) is equipped with a computerised mobilising system for the efficient and effective mobilising of fire-fighting and ambulance resources for fires and emergencies. It is linked to all fire stations, ambulance depots and fireboat stations for dispatch of resources. The FSCC, manned round the clock, also caters for receipt of complaints and enquiries of fire hazards and dangerous goods. During major incidents, it acts as a co-ordinator for government departments and public utilities. The FSCC has five Mobile Command Units which serve as on-scene command and control centres in major incidents. The Third Generation Mobilising System came into operation in phases starting in the first quarter of 2005. The system's objective is to further enhance the capability and efficiency in mobilisation and communications to meet anticipated growth of emergency calls over the next decade. ===Licensing and certification=== The Licensing and Certification Command enforces fire safety regulations and policies, and processes the registration of fire service installation contractors. The Policy Division deals mainly with the formulation of guidelines on fire protection matters, prosecutions, research and approval of portable fire-fighting equipment and gas cylinders. The Dangerous Goods Division is responsible for the licensing of dangerous goods stores and vehicles, and timber stores. The Fire Service Installations Division and Ventilation Division are responsible for inspecting fire service installations and ventilating systems in buildings respectively. The two regional offices － the Hong Kong and Kowloon West and the New Territories and Kowloon East － are responsible for advising other government authorities on the fire safety measures for the purposes of licensing/registering various types of premises. Officers of the Command are seconded to the Home Affairs Department to inspect hotels, guesthouses, private clubs and bedspace apartments, and formulate fire safety requirements on these premises; whereas some are seconded to the Social Welfare Department to advise on fire protection measures in residential care homes for the elderly. ===Fire safety=== The Fire Safety Command assists and advises the public on fire protection measures with the aim of enhancing their fire safety awareness. The Community Relations Division is responsible for promoting fire safety and co-ordinating with other government departments and District Fire Safety Committees in stepping up fire prevention publicity. To promote fire safety awareness at district levels, the Division works closely with local fire stations in organising fire safety talks, seminars, exhibitions, fire drills and training of Fire Safety Ambassadors, who are volunteers from various sectors of the community to raise awareness of fire safety. The Commercial Buildings and Premises Division enforces the Fire Safety (Commercial Premises) Ordinance for upgrading fire safety measures in prescribed commercial premises (i.e. supermarkets, department stores, shopping arcades, banks, jewelry or goldsmith premises and off-course betting centres) and specified commercial buildings (i.e. commercial buildings constructed or the plans of building works of which first submitted to the Building Authority for approval on or before 1 March 1987). A Building Safety Loan Scheme has also been established to provide financial assistance to owners of such premises and buildings to upgrade the fire safety measures where necessary. Pending implementation of the Fire Safety (Buildings) Ordinance, the Building Improvement and Support Division continues to inspect old private composite and domestic buildings with a view to enhancing fire safety and advising owners and occupiers concerned on the improved standards to be required. The Fire Service Installation Task Force inspects fire service installations in buildings, handles complaints regarding building fire service installations and monitors the performance of registered fire service installation contractors. The Railway Development Strategy Division scrutinises fire safety strategies and processes building plans of new railway infrastructure projects. It also carries out acceptance tests of fire service installations on completion of those projects. The Theme Park Projects Division formulates fire safety requirements for buildings and other supporting infrastructures in the Hong Kong Disneyland theme park in Penny's Bay. It also carries out acceptance tests on fire service installations upon completion of these works. ===Administration and logistic support=== The Headquarters Command offers policy, planning, management and logistic support to the operational commands. It also oversees the operation of Fire Services Communication Centre, Airport Fire Contingent, Fire Services Training School, recruitment and examination, workshops and transport, stores and supplies, diving service, physical training, information and publicity matters, staff welfare and statistics. The Administration Division, staffed by civilians, deals with departmental establishment, personnel, finance, appointments, general matters, staff relations, audit and translation service. ===Airport fire contingent=== The primary role of the contingent is to provide rescue and fire fighting coverage for Hong Kong International Airport. The contingent, which comprises two fire stations (one next to DHL Asia Hub and one on Airport Road at Cathay Pacific City) and two sea rescue berths (east and west ends of Chep Lap Kok) at strategic locations on the airport platform, is equipped with 14 fire appliances, two command boats and eight speedboats. ===Diving services=== The Diving Unit has a fleet of five diving tenders, one diving support vessel and two diving support speedboats deployed at seven strategic locations throughout Hong Kong, and a three-compartment compression chamber at Stonecutter's Island for treating patients suffering from decompression illness and requiring hyperbaric oxygen treatment. It comprises about 150 active divers responsible for maritime search and rescue within Hong Kong waters down to the maximum depth of 42 metres using compressed air diving equipment and underwater breaking-in tools. ===Training=== Fire Services Training School (FSTS) provides initial training for recruit fire and ambulance personnel. It also provides refresher and advanced training courses for all fire personnel. Fire Services Ambulance Command Training School (FSACTS) provides initial and paramedic training to recruits and ambulance personnel. It also provides Advanced Ambulance Aid Training at first-responder level to serving fire personnel. The duration of various courses ranges from one day to 26 weeks. The fire and ambulance recruits who have successfully completed the initial training courses will be posted to fire stations and ambulance depots respectively to continue their on-the-job training in order to gain field experience. Apart from providing training for staff of other government departments, private organisations and overseas fire officers, FSTS also runs Youth Pre-employment Training Programmes and Smart Teen Challenge Camps for youngsters jointly with the Labour Department and the Education and Manpower Bureau respectively. FSACTS also provides initial and refresher training on cardio-pulmonary resuscitation to members of the public. In addition to overseas training on latest fire services technology and management skills, officers and instructors also attend various advanced courses conducted by overseas fire professionals in Hong Kong. ===Workshops=== The Workshops Division is responsible for all engineering matters relating to fire appliances, fire-fighting and rescue equipment. These include design, development, procurement, inspection and maintenance, fitting out, modification, testing and commissioning. ===Response times=== There are altogether 81 fire stations, 37 ambulance depots and six fireboat stations. They are strategically located to provide an emergency response for all areas. The graded response times for building fire calls are six minutes for built-up areas and nine to 23 minutes for areas of dispersed risks and isolated developments. For emergency ambulance services, the target response time is 12 minutes. The performance target is to achieve these response times in 92.5% of all calls. In 2004, 94.06% of building fire calls and 91.08% of emergency ambulance calls were responded to within the respective target response times. ===Public liaison group=== The group which comprises 30 members of the public from all walks of life monitors and improves the delivery of the department's public services. It helps foster better understanding between the public and the department. ==Equipment== The Fire Services Department of Hong Kong is a force of 8,000-plus firefighters serving one of the most densely populated urban areas in the world. They served under the British before 1997 and are equipped much like their counterparts in the United Kingdom. While most cities' high-rise buildings are concentrated in their commercial areas in the central business districts, they are ubiquitous in Hong Kong. Most residential buildings in this very crowded Asian metropolis are more than twenty storeys tall, with some reaching forty or fifty storeys and the tallest over seventy. Thanks to strict fire code and the use of non-flammable materials, severe structural fires are rare. The Fire Services Department is nonetheless equipped with a significant quantity of hydraulic platforms and possesses some of the tallest ladder platforms in the world. Common fire engines in Hong Kong include: *Hydraulic Platforms: Carry out firefighting and rescue at elevated levels - similar of snorkel, aerial tower or cherry pickers used in North America *Major Pumpers: Basically Type B Water Tenders that provide water supply - called pumpers in North America *Turntable Ladder: Similar to Hydraulic Platforms but they use telescopic ladders instead of hydraulic platforms and are better suited for high level rescue - called aerial in North America *Light Rescue Units: First-strike fire appliances, equipped with varieties of rescue equipments *Major Rescue Units: Also serve as light rescue units but are capable of special missions when teamed up with the rescue tenders *Mobile Command Units: Field command centre *Rescue Tenders: Perform rescue missions in major disasters *Hazmat Tenders: Hazardous materials handling *Hazmat Pods: Equipped with radioactivity detectors, protective aprons and decontaminating tools, Hazmat Pods are used in nuclear/biohazardous incidents. *Lighting Tenders: Provide lighting *Hose Layer: Carry hoses for water relay *Light Pumping Appliances: Perform pumping or rescue operations when area is inaccessible to major appliances *Reserve Heavy Pumps: Conduct water relay and pumping in remote areas or major fires *Snorkels: Perform rescue operations at 26–30 m. *Aerial Ladder Platforms (ALP): Carry a telescopic ladder and capable of reaching 47–53 m The following appliances are mainly deployed to the airport and stations close to fuel depots: *First Intervention Vehicle: Carries foam and water and capable of discharging 6000 litres per minute *Foam Tenders: Carry out oil fuel fire fighting with foam and foam concentrate transportation *Bulk Foam Tender: Supply foam concentrate, pre-mixed foam solution for First Intervention Vehicle for prolonged fuel oil fire fighting *Jackless Snorkel: Equipped with a piercing nozzle that can pierce through the fuselage of airplanes and discharge foam in cabin.

The changes impacted both uniforms (lapels, buttons, helmets, caps), vehicles, flags and other signage. ===Crest=== The new crest removed all colonial elements. Laurel wreath was retained. St Edward's Crown was replaced with Bauhinia. The motto changed from the uni-lingual Fire Services - Hong Kong to the bilingual Fire Services Hong Kong (消防). The badge theme changed from a crowned lion holding a pearl to a pair of fire axes and a burning torch ===Flag=== As the crest was also used on the flag, it too was changed in 1997. The old red flag was replaced by a purple flag with the new crest. This flag is only flown at Headquarters, whereas the Flag of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region flies at all fire stations.

Originally called the New York State Militia it can trace its lineage back to the American Revolution and the War of 1812. , the New York Guard, a recognized command under the New York State's Military law, has line-item funding in the state budget.The State Guard Sentinel; Volume 1, No. 3 New York Guard, Spring 2008 Now with a unified command structure, formerly the organization contained an Army Division and an Air Division. The missions of the New York Guard include augmentation, assistance, and support of the New York Army National Guard and New York Air National Guard respectively and aide to civil authorities in New York State. New York also has a New York Naval Militia which, with the State Guard and the Army and Air National Guards, is under the command of the Governor of New York, the Adjutant General of New York, and the Division of Military and Naval Affairs (DMNA). The New York Guard is one of the largest and best organized State Guards in the United States. It is historically derived from Revolutionary and Civil War era state military units that were reorganized several times in American history in response to various international and domestic crises. Organized under the Military Law, State of New York, the New York Guard cannot be federalized and cannot be deployed outside New York State without the consent of the governor. Members of the New York Guard are entitled to many of the benefits accorded members of other components of the 'Organized Militia of the State of New York,' the legal collective term describing the New York Army and Air National Guards, New York Naval Militia and New York Guard. These include 'military leave' for employees of state or local governments and many private employers. ==History== The 265th New York State Militia was a small unit of the New York line and could trace its lineage to the War of 1812. The new regiment was given the designation, 14th regiment, which is one of the oldest military organizations in the United States because of its direct lineage through various separate companies, to the militia companies of the Dutch burghers of New Amsterdam.A History of the 14th Regiment N.Y.S.M. Infantry ===Civil War era=== For more detail, see List of New York Civil War Regiments The New York Seventh in Washington, DC, 1861 Many units of the New York State Militia saw service in the American Civil War, after being activated into federal service by President Abraham Lincoln. The activation of state militia by President Abraham Lincoln led to some conflict with State authorities in command of the units: > With the advent of the Civil War in April 1861, the 14th regiment saw its > first war service in guarding the Brooklyn Navy Yard. By mid-April of that > year, the \\"Brooklyn Chasseurs\\" were ready to leave New York for Washington > D.C. Colonel Alfred Wood advised the Honorable Governor Morgan that the > regiment was prepared to march and had accepted a three-year federal > enlistment. However, the governor would not issue orders for the regiment to > leave New York. While encamped at Fort Greene Park in Brooklyn, Colonel Wood > and Congressman Moses O'Dell went to see President Lincoln to secure orders > for the regiment to march to Washington. President Lincoln lost no time in > issuing those orders to the 14th Brooklyn. When Governor Morgan learned that > the regiment was preparing to march, he telegraphed Colonel Wood and > inquired \\"by what authority\\" did he move his regiment, Colonel Wood coolly > replied, \\"By the authority of the President of the United States.\\"A History > of the 14th Regiment N.Y.S.M. Infantry Following the Civil War, efforts were made to link the varied military units in New York under overall headquarters. As a result of this, the 3rd Brigade, New York State Militia, came into being on August 5, 1886. ===New York Guard created, 1917=== On August 3, 1917, the Adjutant General of New York, in order to comply with the provisions of the State Constitution requiring that troops be available to the Governor for the protection of life and property of the citizens of New York, organized a state military force known as the New York Guard. The new force replaced the New York National Guard, drafted in the service of the United States on August 5, 1917. The force consisted of the First and Second Provisional Regiments, guarding aqueducts and other infrastructure in the southern portion (First Provisional Regiment) and the remaining parts of the state. On January 1, 1919, the Guard numbered 22,000 in active service. After the Armistice, federalized New York National Guard Units were returned to State control. General Pershing and Private Ruth in Washington, 1924 On May 21, 1924, Babe Ruth joined the New York National Guard and was Assigned to the 104th Field Artillery in Jamaica Queens Armory. George Herman Ruth, popularly known as \\"The Babe\\", \\"The Bambino\\", and \\"The Sultan of Swat\\", was a member of the 104th Field Artillery in Jamaica Queens. On May 21, 1924* he signed the dotted line for three years and joined the ranks of civilian soldiers. Babe Ruth was sworn in by Colonel James Austin at the Isle of Safety in Times Square in front of a military tent used for enlistment drives. Once the enlistment papers were filled he symbolically placed them into the open jaws of a horse drawn French 75-millimeter gun. He was then immediately placed under the command of First Sergeant Adrian Jacques who was in charge of the regiment present. He served while he played in the stadium he was destined to rebuild. A May 29 Washington Post article reported that he appeared before General John Joseph Pershing at State, War and Navy building in Washington** once he was fitted and squared away. 104th Field Artillery Armory The 104th Field Artillery underwent several changes over the years while in active duty. The unit served briefly under Federal control on November 5, 1916 for Mexican border control, then returned to state status on November 15, 1916. In addition, the unit was activated for Federal service during World War I and II. It wasn't until 1917 that the unit received its destination as the 104th Field Artillery and saw extensive service in France. After World War I, the unit was demobilized but shortly reactivated into the New York National Guard until 1959 when it reorganized as the 104th Field Artillery Regiment. Consolidated 1 September 1992 with the 104th Field Artillery and consolidated unit designated as the 258th Field Artillery, to consist of the 1st Battalion, an element of the 42d Infantry Division.New York Times, May 21, 1924, pg. 10The Washington Post, May 29, 1924 ===New York Guard, 1940=== With the advent of World War II, New York National Guard units were federalized and the New York Guard was created for service to the State.NY Guard Members Remember New York Guard State Volunteer Force, May 6, 2011 In 1942, former Heavyweight champion boxer Lt Jack Dempsey joined New York Guard. ===New York Guard, 2001 to present=== In the wake of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, the New York Guard provided security, disaster relief, legal, communications and other services to New York City and the surrounding areas in cooperation with the National Guard. During this period, Major General John F. Bahrenburg was Commander of the New York Guard (his tenure as Commander was from 1999 to 2002).https://dmna.ny.gov/historic/articles/NYG_History_Units_Commanders_Stenzel.pdf The New York Guard experienced a resurgence after the September 11, 2001 attacks. New York Guard units were activated after the attacks, performing a variety of missions, including, logistical support to forces stationed at \\"Ground Zero\\". Medical units of the Guard worked in conjunction with other DMNA forces providing care at several location including Camp Smith, in Westchester county. New York Guard Staff Sgt. Joseph Dee fires an M9 pistol during the 35th Annual \\"TAG (The Adjutant General) Match.thumbMembers of the New York Guard load supplies onto a flatbed as a part of the State Active Duty mission in the Fall of 2017 Hurricane Maria deployment. Principal occupational specialties of the New York Guard include, communications, engineering, medical and legal services, provided in support of all components of New York State military forces, i.e., the Army and Air National Guards, Naval Militia and the New York Guard, as well as to civil authorities. Trained and state- certified New York Guard soldiers augment and assist National Guard units in the following missions: weapons of mass destruction [WMD] decontamination – the joint New York Army National Guard / New York Air National Guard / New York Guard decontamination, or CERF, team was activated by the governor for state duty for 11 days during the 2004 Republican National Convention in New York City, Military Emergency Radio Network – the Guard is assigned to operate the MERN at various locations to ensure the free flow of information during an emergency, and search and rescue (SAR) a secondary mission to the state. New York Guard SAR teams have been mobilized, for example, in the summer of 2006 to search for a missing camper in the Adirondack Mountains preserve. Selected units and personnel of the New York Guard were called to State Active Duty with pay in response to Hurricane Irene in 2011. 2012 saw the largest deployment of the New York Guard since the September 11, 2001 attacks. Every brigade was at least partially activated for service during 'Superstorm' Sandy. New York Guard members served as equals alongside the Army National Guard, Air National Guard, and New York Naval Militia, at one point making up approximately one third of all troops in the field during a two-month deployment. New York State Guard personnel provide training to the New York Army and Air national guards including first aid and firearms training at Camp Smith training center. The 244th Medical Clinic works with the NY Army National Guard Medical Command (MEDCOM), augmenting National Guard personnel for in-state MEDCOM missions. These have included screening of National Guard personnel in Soldier Readiness Programs and 'reintegration' programs for both soldiers and their families upon troops' return from overseas deployment. In addition to its SAR work as a secondary mission under the New York State Defense Emergency Act and Article 2-B of State and Local, Natural and Man-Made disasters Act, engineer units of the NY Guard 10th and 65th Brigades have built facilities for the National Guard. Civil affairs units provide legal services to about-to-deploy troops such as wills and counseling on legal protections under federal and state law. The New York Guard augments the capabilities of the National Guard, serving only within New York State. Guard personnel are drawn from almost every profession – from plumbers to professors, clerks and CEOs, persons with long prior military service and those without, and every part of the state. The headquarters unit of the New York Guard is located at Camp Smith, Cortlandt Manor, New York. Camp Smith is a New York State military reservation. It is adjacent to Peekskill, New York, and about 35 miles north of New York City.

The programme was part of the Port and Airport Development Strategy, commonly known as the Rose Garden Project. The cost for the whole project was estimated at over HK$200 billion, and the Chinese Government was concerned about its impact on the financial reserve of the future Hong Kong SAR Government. Several changes were made to the plan, including the shortening of the Tsing Ma Bridge and the construction of the Airport Railway as a double-track railway. The project ended up costing HK$160.2 billion. The Programme formally commenced after the signing of a memorandum of understanding between British Prime Minister John Major and Chinese Premier Li Peng in Beijing on 3 September 1991, and lasted eight years in total. It was the most expensive airport project in the world, according to the Guinness World Records. It was the biggest infrastructure programme in Hong Kong's history. ==History== Plans to replace the old Kai Tak Airport were drafted after the Second World War. However, for financial and political reasons, the plan was abandoned in 1951 and the Hong Kong Government decided to expand the original airport instead. With the growth of the economy of Hong Kong during the 1970s, the project reemerged for discussion. The government earmarked Chek Lap Kok, just off the north coast of Lantau Island near Tung Chung, as the designated site for the new airport. However, the plan was shelved in 1983 for economic reasons, as well as the question of Hong Kong's sovereignty and the impending signing of the Sino-British Joint Declaration. The plan was announced on 11October 1989 by the then Governor David Wilson, and it was perceived to be part of the government's effort to reinstate confidence in Hong Kong after the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989. The public was initially surprised by the huge budget and there were concerns that it would drain much of the public revenue. The programme was completed with the opening of the new Hong Kong International Airport at Chek Lap Kok in July 1998. ==The Ten Core Projects== The programme included: ===Hong Kong International Airport=== The Hong Kong International Airport is the centrepiece of this massive project; it provided the foundation for the other nine core projects of the Airport Core Programme. Chek Lap Kok was selected as an optimal site due to its development potential. Construction finally started in 1992 and was planned to finish in mid-1997. Chris Patten, the last Governor of Hong Kong, expressed his hope of leaving Hong Kong via the new airport after the transfer of sovereignty of Hong Kong. Sadly, this did not materialise. The airport finally came into operation on 6 July 1998, at a cost of around US$20 billion.http://www.airport- technology.com/projects/cheklapkok_new/ ===Airport Railway=== The Airport Railway was built to connect Kowloon Peninsula and Hong Kong Island to the Airport and the planned new towns of Northern Lantau. The railway is operated by the MTR Corporation and has two routes: the Airport Express and the Tung Chung Line which provides a commuter service linking the new town of Tung Chung to the city. These two lines share the same double-tracks for most of their routes, however, the railway was initially planned to have four tracks along its length. The commuter service offered by the Tung Chung Line also provided relief to the overcrowded Tsuen Wan Line of the MTR. ===Lantau Link=== Comprising Kap Shui Mun Bridge and Tsing Ma Bridge, the Lantau Link connects Lantau with Tsing Yi, via Ma Wan. It carries both road and railway traffic between the islands. ===Western Harbour Crossing=== This is the third cross-harbour tunnel for Victoria Harbour. Built under a build-operate- transfer agreement with the Western Harbour Tunnel Company, the tunnel was intended to relieve congestion at the Cross Harbour Tunnel and is part of expressway Route 3. ===North Lantau Expressway=== With the highest posted speed limit in Hong Kong, this six-lane motorway links Tung Chung in the west to the Lantau Link in the east, via the north coast of Lantau. ===Route 3 – Kwai Chung and Tsing Yi Sections=== Route 3 is one of the 10 strategic expressway routes of Hong Kong, linking Sai Ying Pun on Hong Kong Island and Yuen Long in the New Territories. The Kwai Chung and Tsing Yi sections were built to link the Lantau Link and West Kowloon Expressway. The Kwai Chung section is 3 km in length. The route connects with the West Kowloon Highway near Lai Chi Kok, then bypasses the Kwai Tsing Container Terminals, finally connecting with the Cheung Tsing Bridge of the Tsing Yi section. It is an 8-lane elevated motorway. This section is now known as Tsing Kwai Highway. The Tsing Yi section comprises the 500 m long Cheung Tsing Bridge, which crosses over Rambler Channel, and the 1.6 km Cheung Tsing Tunnel, which cuts through the high ground on Tsing Yi Island. This section is now known as the Cheung Tsing Highway. ===West Kowloon Highway=== This is a six-lane motorway 4.2 km in length with the northern 2 km elevated for the Airport Railway running underneath. It links the Kowloon portal of the Western Harbour Crossing in the south to the Tsing Kwai Highway in the north and is built entirely on newly reclaimed land. ===Land Reclamation in West Kowloon=== Reclamation work was needed along the west coast of Kowloon Peninsula to provide land for the expressway, Route 3, as well as supporting infrastructure. The Airport Railway also runs through the reclaimed land of West Kowloon. The reclamation work has increased the area of Kowloon Peninsula by 30%. ===Central Reclamation Phase I=== This phase required the reclamation of an area of 20 hectares along the waterfront of Central to provide land for the Airport Railway's Hong Kong Station. Two ferry piers serving outlying islands as well as a government dockyard had to be relocated to facilitate the work. ===Phase I of North Lantau New Town=== The first phase of the new town in Northern Lantau is centred on Tung Chung and was planned to provide housing to 18,000 people. The new town was meant to be a supporting community for the new Hong Kong International Airport, as well as to act as a \\"gateway\\" to Hong Kong for visitors. At present, phases I, II and IIIA of the new town have been completed, all around Tung Chung. When all 4 phases are completed, the new town will be home to 320,000 people, covering an area of 830 hectares between Tung Chung and the neighbouring area of Tai Ho. ==Exhibition Centre== The Airport Core Programme Exhibition Centre introducing the programme is located in Ting Kau near Sham Tseng in Hong Kong. ==References== * CONEXPO-CON/AGG '99 (1999).

Pitchers who use the sinker tend to rely on it heavily and do not need to change pitch speeds as much as other pitchers do because the sinking action induces weak bat contact. Other pitchers normally change pitch speeds to achieve this effect. The sinker is much more often used by right-handed than left-handed pitchers. ==History== Scott Feldman Before the 1950s, pitchers did not know what caused their pitches to sink or \\"hop.\\" They regarded either ability as a \\"gift from heaven.\\" Bill James cites Curt Simmons as the first pitcher to be able to throw both sinkers and rising fastballs, apparently indicating that it was not known how to make a pitch sink and how to make one hop. ==Current Major League pitchers== Zach Britton, Marcus Stroman, Charlie Morton, Dallas Keuchel, Jake Arrieta, Jim Johnson, Rick Porcello, Kendall Graveman, Sonny Gray, Jeurys Familia, Tanner Roark, Jordan Hicks, Sam Dyson, Scott Alexander, Dustin May, Matt Albers, Mike Soroka, and Mike Leake are current major league players who rely heavily on the sinker. ==Throwing mechanics== One method of throwing the sinker is to simply grip the baseball along the two seams and throw it similar to a fastball. Some pitchers use a downward motion on their wrist when throwing it. The pitcher's palm turns to the right at release for a right handed pitcher. This causes a sharper sink, but also has a greater risk of a wild pitch. This wrist movement is also called pronation. Many sinker ball pitchers today turn the inside of the ball over just before releasing the ball, combined with slightly increasing the pressure on the ball with the index finger (\\"press inside\\") which creates a tilted sidespin motion that causes horizontal movement. ==Effects on the batter== The sinker drops 6 to 9 inches more than a typical four seam fastball which causes batters to hit ground balls more often than other fastballs, mostly due to the tilted sidespin on the ball. Horizontal movement also occurs when sinkers are thrown. Sinkerball pitchers can often get called strikes and swinging strikes on the pitch. ==Notable sinkerballers== Jason Marquis *Bill Swift *Greg Maddux *Matt Albers *Brad Bergesen *Burke Badenhop *Zack Britton *Kevin Brown *Trevor Cahill *Aaron Cook *Kevin Correia *Jeurys Familia *Scott Feldman *Jon Garland *Roy Halladay *Roberto Hernández *Orel Hershiser *Chris Heston *Luke Hochevar *Tim Hudson *Tommy John *Jim Johnson *Randy Jones *Jeff Karstens *Kyle Kendrick *Dallas Keuchel *Mike Leake *Kameron Loe *Mickey Lolich *Derek Lowe *Seth Maness *Jason Marquis *Justin Masterson *Jackie Mitchell *Sergio Mitre *Charlie Morton *Carl Pavano *Brandon League *Mike Pelfrey *Carlos Silva *Mel Stottlemyre *Mike Timlin *Blake Treinen *Chien-Ming Wang *Brandon Webb *Randy Wells *Jake Westbrook *Jerome Williams *Carlos Zambrano *Juan Flores *Scott Erickson *Ronald Belisario *Steve Cishek ==See also== *Two-seam fastball ==References== Category:Baseball pitches ","title":"Sinker (baseball)"},{"id":"2212621","text":"Three types of small lead sinkers A fishing sinker or knoch is a weight used in conjunction with a fishing lure or hook to increase its rate of sink, anchoring ability, and/or casting distance. Fishing sinkers may be as small as 1 gram for applications in shallow water, and even smaller for fly fishing applications, or as large as several pounds or considerably more for deep sea fishing. They are formed into nearly innumerable shapes for diverse fishing applications. Environmental concerns surround the usage of lead and other materials in fishing sinkers. ==Types== A large variety of sinkers exist which are used depending on the fish being pursued, the environment, the current and personal preference. ===Pyramid sinkers=== Pyramid sinkers are shaped like a pyramid and are used when it is desirable to anchor on the bottom of water bodies. They are attached to the terminal end of fishing line by loops of brass. ===Barrel or egg sinkers=== Barrel or egg sinkers are rounded and often bead-like with a narrow hole through which fishing line is threaded. These sinkers are desirable on rock or debris covered substrates. ===Split-shot sinkers=== Split-shot sinkers are small and round with a split cutting halfway through the sinker. The split can be placed on a piece of fishing line and then crimped closed. This feature makes adding and removing the weights easy and quick. ===Bullet sinkers=== Bullet sinkers are bullet-shaped and used widely on largemouth bass fishing for rigging plastic worms \\"Texas-style\\". ===Dipsey=== Dipsey sinkers are ovate or egg-shaped and are attached to the fishing line with a loop of brass wire embedded in the sinker. ===Bank sinker=== Bank sinkers are long and ovate and have a small hole at the top for the fishing line to thread through. ===Claw sinker=== A claw sinker consists of a sinker weight which is typically of round shape, and a number of metal wire spikes grouped around the sinker weight acting as barbs. Claw sinkers are used in surf fishing on sandy bottoms with strong currents, mainly to prevent the sinker from getting carried off with the current. Upon casting a claw sinker, the line is briefly tugged so that the claws will dig themselves into the sand, allowing the rig to stay in place. === Deep Drop Weight === A Deep Drop Weight is used to reach the bottom in deeper offshore fishing applications. These fishing weights are typically cylindrical in with a brass eyelet at the top for attaching to a rig. Weights for this style of sinker range from one pound to as much as fourteen pounds. Target species include Tilefish, Grouper, and Swordfish, among others. ==Materials== A pyramid sinker made of lead, nowadays widely regarded as too toxic a material An ideal material for a fishing sinker is environmentally acceptable, cheap and dense. Density is desirable as weights must be as small as possible, in order to minimize visual cues which could drive fish away from a fishing operation. In ancient times as well as sometimes today, fishing sinkers consisted of materials found ordinarily in the natural environment, such as stones, rocks, or bone. Later, lead became the material of choice for sinkers due to its low cost, ease of production and casting, chemical inertness (resistance to corrosion), and density. However, lead is known to cause lead poisoning and enter the environment as a result of the inevitable occasional loss of fishing sinkers during routine fishing. Thus, most lead-based fishing sinkers have been outlawed in the United Kingdom (under 1 oz weight), Canada, and some states in the United States. Lead based fishing sinkers are banned in all of US and Canadian National Parks. These bans have motivated the use of various other materials in sinkers. Steel, brass, and bismuth sinkers have been marketed, but anglers have not widely adopted them due to their lower density and higher cost compared to lead. Sandsinkers have also been developed, using sand as weight. However, sand has a comparably low density to that of lead and makes a poor replacement. Tungsten is now in use, especially among largemouth bass anglers. Although several times costlier than lead, tungsten is just under twice as dense as lead and thus found desirable. The environmental effects of tungsten, however, are essentially unknown. More recently, terminal tackle manufacturers are experimenting with high density composite resins. These materials present a non-toxic alternative to lead sinkers at a lower monetary cost than alternative metallic sinkers. ==References== Efforts to ban lead in fishing tackle Retrieved 8 April 2011.

There are two types of application programming interface (API) in the Linux kernel that are not to be confused: the \\"kernel-user space\\" API and the \\"kernel internal\\" API. == Linux API == The Linux API is composed out of the System Call Interface of the Linux kernel, the GNU C Library (by GNU), libcgroup, libdrm, libalsa and libevdev (by freedesktop.org). Linux API vs. POSIX API The Linux API is the kernel-user space API, which allows programs in user space to access system resources and services of the Linux kernel. It is composed out of the System Call Interface of the Linux kernel and the subroutines in the GNU C Library (glibc). The focus of the development of the Linux API has been to provide the usable features of the specifications defined in POSIX in a way which is reasonably compatible, robust and performant, and to provide additional useful features not defined in POSIX, just as the kernel- user space APIs of other systems implementing the POSIX API also provide additional features not defined in POSIX. The Linux API, by choice, has been kept stable over the decades through a policy of not introducing breaking changes; this stability guarantees the portability of source code. At the same time, Linux kernel developers have historically been conservative and meticulous about introducing new system calls. Much available free and open-source software is written for the POSIX API. Since so much more development flows into the Linux kernel as compared to the other POSIX-compliant combinations of kernel and C standard library, the Linux kernel and its API have been augmented with additional features. As far as these additional features provide a technical advantage, programming for the Linux API is preferred over the POSIX-API. Well-known current examples are udev, systemd and Weston. People such as Lennart Poettering openly advocate to prefer the Linux API over the POSIX API, where this offers advantages. At FOSDEM 2016, Michael Kerrisk explained some of the perceived issues with the Linux kernel's user-space API, describing that it contains multiple design errors by being non-extensible, unmaintainable, overly complex, of limited purpose, in violation of standards, and inconsistent. Most of those mistakes cannot be fixed because doing so would break the ABI that the kernel presents to the user space. === System Call Interface of the Linux kernel=== System Call Interface is the denomination for the entirety of all implemented and available system calls in a kernel. Various subsystems, such as e.g. the DRM define their own system calls and the entirety is called System Call Interface. Various issues with the organization of the Linux kernel system calls are being publicly discussed. Issues have been pointed out by Andy Lutomirski, Michael Kerrisk and others. === The C standard library === The GNU C Library is a wrapper around the Linux kernel System Call Interface. The GNU C Library is a wrapper around the system calls of the Linux kernel; the combination of the Linux kernel System Call Interface and glibc is what builds the Linux API. * GNU C Library (glibc) * Embedded GLIBC * uClibc * klibc * Newlib * musl * dietlibc * libbionic and libhybris  Additions to POSIX  As in other Unix-like systems, additional capabilities of the Linux kernel exist that are not part of POSIX: * cgroups subsystem, the system calls it introduces and libcgroup * The system calls of the Direct Rendering Manager, especially the driver-private ioctls for the command submission are not part of the POSIX specifications. * Advanced Linux Sound Architecture could set system calls, which are not part of the POSIX specifications * The system calls \`futex\` (fast userspace mutex), \`epoll\`, \`splice\`, \`dnotify\`, \`fanotify\`, and \`inotify\` have been exclusive to the Linux kernel so far. * The system call \`getrandom\` was introduced in version 3.17 of the Linux kernel mainline * \`memfd\` was proposed by the kdbus developers ** \`memfd_create\` was merged into the Linux kernel mainline in kernel version 3.17 * \`readahead\` initiates a file \\"read-ahead\\" into page cache DRM has been paramount for the development and implementations of well-defined and performant free and open- source graphics device drivers without which no rendering acceleration would be available at all, or even worse, only the 2D drivers would be available in the X.Org Server. DRM was developed for Linux, and since has been ported to other operating systems as well. === Further libraries === * libdrm (for Direct Rendering Manager) * libnl (The libnl suite is a collection of libraries providing APIs to netlink protocol based Linux kernel interfaces.) * libevdev (for evdev) * libasound (Advanced Linux Sound Architecture) * … == Linux ABI == ABI The term Linux ABI refers to a kernel–user space ABI. The Application binary interface refers to the compiled binaries, in machine code. Any such ABI is therefore bound to the instruction set. Defining a useful ABI and keeping it stable is less the responsibility of the Linux kernel developers or of the developers of the GNU C Library, and more the task for Linux distributions and Independent software vendor (ISVs) who wish to sell and provide support for their proprietary software as binaries only for such a single Linux ABI, as opposed to supporting multiple Linux ABIs. An ABI has to be defined for every instruction set, such as x86, x86-64, MIPS, ARMv7-A (32-Bit), ARMv8-A (64-Bit), etc. with the endianness, if both are supported. It should be able to compile the software with different compilers against the definitions specified in the ABI and achieve full binary compatibility. Compilers that are free and open-source software are e.g. GNU Compiler Collection, LLVM/Clang. End-users are in fact not all interested in the Linux API (or the Windows API), but in the ABIs. == In-kernel APIs == There are a lot of kernel-internal APIs for all the subsystems to interface with one another. These are being kept fairly stable, but there is no guarantee for stability. In case new research or insights make a change seem favorable, an API is changed, all necessary rewrite and testing have to be done by the author. The Linux kernel is a monolithic kernel, hence device drivers are kernel components. To ease the burden of companies maintaining their (proprietary) device drivers out-of-tree, stable APIs for the device drivers have been repeatedly requested. The Linux kernel developers have repeatedly denied guaranteeing stable in-kernel APIs for device drivers. Guaranteeing such would have faltered the development of the Linux kernel in the past and would still in the future and, due to the nature of free and open-source software, are not necessary. Ergo, by choice, the Linux kernel has no stable in-kernel API. == In-kernel ABIs == Since there are no stable in-kernel APIs, there cannot be stable in-kernel ABIs. == Abstraction APIs == OpenGL is indeed an abstraction API to make use of diverse GPUs of multiple vendors without the need to program for each one specifically. Vulkan was to make the \\"graphics driver\\", i.e. the implementation of the graphics API, do less. For several use cases the Linux API is considered too low-level and higher abstraction APIs are used. Such of course still need to work on top of the low-level Linux APIs. Examples: * implementation of the OpenGL and Vulkan specifications in proprietary Linux graphics drivers and the free and open-source implementation in Mesa * implementation of the OpenAL specification * Simple DirectMedia Layer: abstraction API for input/sound/etc. available for many operating systems * Simple and Fast Multimedia Library: like above == See also == * The Linux Programming Interface by Michael Kerrisk * Semaphore (programming) * system call is a function to facilitate programs to request services from the kernel ** ** netlink socket family used for IPC between kernel and user space processes, designed as the successor of ; Netlink was added by Alan Cox during Linux kernel 1.3 development as a character driver interface to provide multiple kernel and user-space bidirectional communications links. Then, Alexey Kuznetsov extended it during Linux kernel 2.1 development to provide a flexible and extensible messaging interface to the new advanced routing infrastructure.

A new leader was thought to be needed to facilitate the release of the Western hostages held by Hezbollah and more importantly to shift Hezbollah's focus to resistance activity against Israel. Al-Moussawi also promised to \\"intensify [Hezbollah] military, political and popular action in order to undermine the peace-talks.\\"Middle East International, 8 November 1991 He did not support entering mainstream politics.

Israel said the attack had been planned as an assassination attempt in retaliation for the kidnapping and death of missing Israeli servicemen in 1986 and the abduction of US Marine and UN peace-keeping officer William R. Higgins in 1988. In retaliation, the Islamic Jihad Organization attacked the Israeli Embassy in Buenos Aires. After the attack, the Islamic Jihad Organization declared that it was carried out as revenge for the martyr infant Hussein, al Musawi's five-year-old son, who had been killed with his father. Later it was revealed by Dieter Bednarz and Ronen Bergman that the original plan of Israel had been just to abduct al Musawi to realize the release of Israeli prisoners. However, Ehud Barak, then Israeli chief of staff, convinced then Israeli Prime Minister Shamir to order his assassination. Al Musawi was succeeded as Secretary General of Hezbollah by Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah. == References == Category:1952 births Category:1992 deaths Category:Hezbollah founders Category:Secretaries-general of Hezbollah Category:Lebanese Islamists Category:Assassinated Lebanese people Category:Lebanese Shia clerics Category:Lebanese Shia Muslims Category:People murdered in Lebanon Category:Al-Moussawi family Category:Aerial operations and battles involving Israel Category:Assassinations in Lebanon Category:Twelvers Category:Islamic Dawa Party politicians ","title":"Abbas al-Musawi"},{"id":"2212648","text":"Atlantic Express may refer to: * Atlantic Express (airline), a trading name for Atlantic Air Transport, a British airline. * Atlantic Express (bus company), a public and school bus operating company in the United States * Atlantic Express, previous name for Eos Airlines, a United States airline * Atlantic Express, a named train operated by the Canadian Pacific Railway * Atlantic Express and Pacific Express, a named train operated by the Erie Railroad * Atlantic Coast Express, a former express passenger train between Waterloo station, London and seaside resorts in the south west * Atlantic Express (Gambia airline) a Gambian airline 2004-2005 == See also == * Atlantic City Express (disambiguation) ==References== ","title":"Atlantic Express"},{"id":"2212652","text":"Canora was a commuter rail station formerly operated by Exo in the west end of the Côte-des-Neiges neighbourhood of Montreal, Quebec, Canada, just east of Mount Royal. It was served by the Deux-Montagnes line and Mascouche line until 2020. The platforms are located northwest of the west portal of the Mount Royal Tunnel. Canora will reopen in 2022 as a station on the Réseau express métropolitain. ==History== The station is located at 7300, Canora Road, immediately northwest of Jean Talon Street. The station takes its name from Canora Road, which in turn takes its name from the first operator of this line, the CAnadian NOrthern RAilway, which built the line and operated it for a short time before it was merged into Canadian National Railway. From the opening of the Deux-Montagnes Line in 1918 until the modernization of the line, which took place between 1993 and 1995, the station was called Portal Heights because of its location at the northwest end of the Mount Royal Tunnel. The station is valued by the residents of not only the town of Mont- Royal, but also by those of the Côte-des-Neiges borough, for its fast connection with the downtown Central station involves a 7-minute journey via the tunnel. Under the Réseau express métropolitain (REM) proposal, which would convert the Deux-Montagnes line to rapid-transit operation, a connecting station would be built on the Saint-Jérôme line adjacent to Canora across Rue- Jean-Talon. Starting in May 2018, due to its 4-year-long process of being converted to light rapid transit, only one of the station's two platforms was being used for travel in both directions; the same was true for its neighbouring station Mont-Royal (outbound). The station was fully closed on May 11, 2020, in order to be converted into a REM station.

Historically, Danish films have been noted for their realism, religious and moral themes, sexual frankness and technical innovation. The Danish filmmaker Carl Theodor Dreyer (1889–1968) is considered one of the greatest directors in the history of cinema. Other Danish filmmakers of note include Benjamin Christensen, who outside his native country directed several horror classics including Häxan (1922) and Seven Footprints to Satan (1929); Erik Balling, the creator of the popular Olsen- banden films; Gabriel Axel, an Oscar-winner for Babette's Feast in 1987; and Bille August, the Oscar-, Palme d'Or- and Golden Globe-winner for Pelle the Conqueror in 1988. In the modern era, notable filmmakers in Denmark include Lars von Trier, who co-created the Dogme 95 film movement, and multiple award- winners Susanne Bier and Nicolas Winding Refn. == History  Beginnings === Screenshot from the 1897 film Kørsel med Grønlandske Hunde Danish cinema pioneer Peter Elfelt, a photographer, was the first Dane to make a film. Between the years of 1896 and 1912, he produced around 200 documentary films on life in Denmark. His first film was Kørsel med Grønlandske Hunde (Traveling with Greenlandic Dogs). Furthermore, he produced the first Danish feature film: Henrettelsen (Capital Execution, 1903). The first film show in Denmark took place in the Panorama cinema on the Town Hall square in Copenhagen, in June 1896. However, the selection of films had been made and produced abroad. === The Golden Age === Europe's first female film star was Danish actor Asta Nielsen In 1906, cinema owner Ole Olsen founded the first Danish film-making company, Nordisk Films Kompagni. It gained most of its income from the export market of short films. Not until 1909 were other film-producing companies established. In 1910 the number had reached ten. This period is now known as the Golden Age of Danish Cinema. In the spring of 1910, Nordisk Films Kompagni changed its policy of producing only short films and began making feature films. This was largely inspired by the Århus Fotorama company's Den hvide Slavehandel (The White Slave Trade, 1910), which was the first multi-reel Danish film lasting more than 30 minutes. With the increasing length of films, there was a growing artistic awareness, which is evident in Afgrunden (The Abyss, 1910). This film launched the career of Asta Nielsen, who soon became Europe's first great female film star. The film was an erotic melodrama, which soon became the preferred genre in early Danish cinema. In 1911, with director August Blom as the new head of production, Nordisk Film was the first of the major European companies to devote itself entirely to full-length feature films. These films were sold abroad profitably because the technical and photographic quality impressed audiences. Yet, when exporting the films, the erotic elements needed to be toned down in order not to offend the working class audiences. In 1913, Nordisk released the first full-length feature movie, Atlantis directed by Blom. After 1913, Danish cinema began to lose its leading foothold in the film industry, with foreign companies having intensified competition in the production of feature-length films. Danish cinema had also begun to suffer from a lack of imagination and a willingness to take creative risks on the part of Danish producers. Independent producer Benjamin Christensen had great success with the spy film Det hemmelighedsfulde X (The Mysterious X or Sealed Orders, 1914) and the crime drama Hævnens Nat (Blind Justice or The Night of Revenge, 1916), both of which are major works in the history of the Danish cinema; he would later direct several films in Sweden and Hollywood. === 1920s through 1940s === Danish movie star Ib Schønberg During World War I, the USA became the leading nation in film production and Danish exports decreased. In the years following the war, Dreyer made an appearance as director at Nordisk Film with the drama Præsidenten (The President, 1919), followed by the ambitious Blade af Satans Bog (Leaves from Satan's Book, 1921), inspired by the American director D. W. Griffith's Intolerance (1916) in both technique and theme. However, Dreyer, as well as Benjamin Christensen, were not permanently connected to the influential Danish film industries and remained loners. As a whole, Danish film in the 1920s was on the decline in spite of the filmmakers' better technical skills. Of most interest at this time were perhaps the so-called Dickens movies directed by the very able A. W. Sandberg. At one point Denmark again enjoyed some international reputation, by the many farces of the vagabond duo Fyrtaarnet og Bivognen (often known by their French names Doublepatte and Patachon), who were Scandinavian predecessors of Laurel and Hardy. They were introduced by Palladium, the rival of Nordisk Film. Despite these resurgences, at the end of the decade the Danish film industry was on its heels. In 1929, Nordisk Film Kompagni was established as a sound film company. The Pastor of Vejlby (1931) reinforced the Nordisk's dominance in the Danish market. The 1930s were dominated by many successes with light comedies. The so-called \\"folkekomedie\\" (folk comedy) genre was born, with Barken Margrethe (1934) an important early example. The Depression and the economic conditions of the film companies prevented more serious film business, and the victory of the sound movie automatically set greater limits on the international possibilities of Danish film. Many popular stars like Marguerite Viby, Ib Schønberg and Peter Malberg had breakthroughs but in spite of many economic successes no further development of the media was seen. Between 1940 and 1945, the German occupation of Denmark during World War II pushed the film industry toward more serious subject matter. The darker tone during these years paralleled the rise of film noir in Hollywood. Bodil Ipsen made her directorial mark with 1942's Afsporet, the first Danish film noir, and continued with the psychological thriller Melody of Murder (1944). The standard of the comedy was also lifted, especially by the witty, elegant movies of Johan Jacobsen, a Danish pupil of Ernst Lubitsch. After the war ended, there was a movement toward realism and social criticism, particularly noted in films directed by Ole Palsbo. Soon, however, Denmark's film industry returned to making the light sentimental comedies and uncomplicated regionalist movies that were popular with Danish filmgoers. === 1950s to 1970s === A large stream of family comedies (\\"Lystspil\\") and class-conscious folk comedies (\\"folkekomedier\\") were produced from the 1950s to late 1970s/early 1980s. Here a lot of Danish stars were born, such as Dirch Passer, Ove Sprogøe and director Erik Balling. Important films of this period include De røde heste (1950), Far til fire (1953), Kispus (1956, first Danish film in colourIMDb-trivia), Støv på hjernen (1961), Sommer i Tyrol (1964), Passer passer piger (1965), the Olsen-banden-series (1968-1981) and Erik Balling's classic TV-sitcom Huset på Christianshavn (1970-1977). In the sixties, Danish cinema became gradually more erotic, with films such as ' (Erik Balling, 1965), Sytten (Annelise Meinecke, 1965), Jeg - en kvinde (Mac Ahlberg, 1965) and Uden en trævl (Annelise Meinecke, 1968), several of which made a huge international impression. As a natural progression, in 1969 Denmark became the first country to completely legalize pornography. In the 1970s, a large percentage of all Danish films were sexually oriented, and many mainstream- features with mainstream-actors included sequences with either softcore- or hardcore-pornography, most notably Mazurka på sengekanten (John Hilbard, 1970) and I Jomfruens tegn (Finn Karlsson, 1973) along with their many respective sequels, forming the eight Bedside-films and six Zodiac-films. In 1972, the Danish Film Institute (DFI) was founded to provide state subsidies for hand- picked films. It allocated public funding for feature films based on their artistic merit rather than commercial appeal—with an emphasis on those films which expressed Danish culture and identity. The DFI reinvigorated the financial viability of the sagging Danish film industry, but later was criticized for becoming too conservative and nationalistic in defining which films represented Danish identity. In one example, Lars von Trier's 1984 debut feature The Element of Crime struggled to receive funds because it was radically different from the typical Danish film—and, yet, received international acclaim upon release. In response, the Ministry of Culture in 1989 vastly broadened the DFI's definition of \\"Danish film\\" to include any work which contributed to Danish film culture. This allowed state funding of films with greater global appeal and helped foster the international success of a new wave of Danish filmmakers. With La' os være (Ernst Johansen & Lasse Nielsen, 1975), independent producer Steen Herdel launched a wave of successful teenage-dramas, including Måske ku' vi (Morten Arnfred, 1976), Du er ikke alene (\\"You Are Not Alone\\") (Ernst Johansen & Lasse Nielsen, 1978), Mig og Charly (Morten Arnfred & Henning Kristiansen, 1978) and Vil du se min smukke navle? (Søren Kragh-Jacobsen, 1978), all produced by Steen Herdel. A notable TV-series, Matador, ran from 1978 to 1982,IMDb-information and has remained a national favourite. It was directed by Erik Balling. === The 1980s === Since the start of the 1980s, the Danish film industry has been completely dependent on state funding through Det Danske Filminstitut. A project usually does not get made unless the script, director and cast etc. has been approved by the appointed representatives of the Danish Film Institute. This means that Danish filmmaking is essentially controlled by the state. In 1983, Lars von Trier graduated from Den Danske Filmskole (National Film School of Denmark) and received international attention with films such as Forbrydelsens element (1984) and Epidemic (1987). His strange, innovative ideas were fiercely resisted by Det Danske Filminstitut and drew very small local audiences, but were embraced by the Cannes Film Festival, where his films were included in the official selections and took home awards. Released in 1987 was the gay teenage drama Venner for altid (\\"Friends Forever\\"), directed by Stefan Henszelman (1960-1991). It won the 1988 Audience Award as Best Feature at the San Francisco International Lesbian & Gay Film Festival. The Danish film industry got a major boost in the late 1980s when the movie Babettes Gæstebud (Babette's Feast), directed by Gabriel Axel, won an Academy Award for Best Foreign Film in 1987, and next year the Best Foreign Film award went to Pelle Erobreren (Pelle the Conqueror), directed by Bille August. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, more talented directors started graduating from the National Film School of Denmark, such as Thomas Vinterberg, Per Fly and Ole Christian Madsen. Also in the late 1980s, Danish cinematographer Mikael Salomon ended a long career in Danish cinema to become one of Hollywood's most celebrated DPs, later establishing himself as a successful, Emmy Award-winning television director. === The 1990s === Danish director Lars von Trier Danish film in the 1990s was dominated by Lars von Trier. His films Europa, Breaking the Waves, The Idiots, and Dancer in the Dark received great international attention and were nominated for numerous awards. The Dogme 95 Collective caught the attention of the international film world with its strict \\"vows of chastity\\" or rules for filmmakers that force filmmakers to concentrate on purity of story and the actors' performances rather than special effects and other cinematic devices. The first Dogme 95 film, The Celebration (Festen), directed by Thomas Vinterberg, received many awards on the international film festival circuit and was named by both the Los Angeles Film Critics Association and the New York Film Critics Circle as the best foreign-language film of the year. The members of the Dogme 95 Collective were von Trier, Vinterberg, Kristian Levring, and Søren Kragh-Jacobsen. Although the Dogme 95 movement originated in Denmark, filmmakers around the world soon experimented with the rigid guidelines and sought certification for their films as Dogme. Furthermore, Lars von Trier's own Dogme-film Idioterne (1998) started a separate wave of arthouse mainstream films with unsimulated sex. Lars von Trier also made history by having his company Zentropa be the world's first mainstream film company to produce hardcore pornographic films. Three of these films, Constance (1998), Pink Prison (1999) and the adult/mainstream crossover- feature All About Anna (2005), were made primarily for a female audience, and were extremely successful in Europe, with the two first being directly responsible for the March 2006 legalizing of pornography in Norway.Norwegian Media Authority none-censorship decision === The 21st century === More Danish films have been successful internationally.

Anders Thomas Jensen first received acclaim as Oscar-winning writer- director of three short films, Ernst & lyset (1996), Wolfgang (1997) and Valgaften (1998), then as screenwriter of such feature films as Mifune's Last Song (1999), Open Hearts (2002), Wilbur Wants to Kill Himself (2002), Stealing Rembrandt (2003) and Brothers (2004); and finally as a director of dark and profound feature comedies like The Green Butchers (2003) and Adam's Apples (2005).

Olesen and Christian E. Christiansen for executive producer by Patriots Day was shot in Paris, France only in the film. The 21st century's first decade proved difficult for a number of Denmark's most established directors, including Lars von Trier, although things started well with his Nicole Kidman-starring Dogville (2003), a provocative stylistic experiment filmed on a black sound stage with little beyond white floor markings to indicate the sets. Its sequel Manderlay (2005), exploring the issue of slavery, continued this stylistic device but was largely ignored by audiences. Thomas Vinterberg, who had gained worldwide recognition with The Celebration (1998), made two very expensive English- language flops, It's All About Love (2003) and Dear Wendy (2005), then tried to retrace his roots with a smaller Danish-language production, En mand kommer hjem (2007), which also flopped painfully, selling only 28.472 tickets. Around the same time, Bille August, Lone Scherfig, and Lars von Trier also made Danish-language films that flopped both financially and with the critics, leading the Danish financial times Børsen to observe on September 19, 2007 that \\"1990'ernes filmfest er forbi\\" (the film party of the 1990s has ended).Børsen: Filmfesten er forbi A change of leadership at the Danish Film Institute in late 2007 was seen by many as an opportunity for reflection and renewal, while others pointed to the generally healthy local box office numbers and denied any crisis. Daily paper Jyllands-posten concluded the situation to be a \\"krise i en opgangstid\\" (crisis in a time of growth).Jyllands-Posten: Krise i en opgangstid In 2008, Danish films sold over 4 million tickets at the Danish boxoffice, the biggest number since 1981, but the relief was brief, as Danish films in the first five months of 2009 turned out to have the lowest ticket-sales since 2005.Politiken, May 27 2009: Danske film flopper i biografen Film critic Henrik Queitsch agreed that there was some reason for concern, noting in the Danish Film Institute's monthly program that \\"the different, the surprising, the odd and the daring\\" was hardly what characterised Danish films of 2008.Henrik Queitsch at DFI.dk: \\"Det anderledes, det overraskende, det skæve og det chancetagende er ikke just det, der præger årets produktion.\\" Danish cinema nonetheless remains highly respected internationally, and Danish films (today almost exclusively consisting of social realist dramas, social realist comedies, children's films and documentaries) receive many awards at major international film festivals. == Danish Film Institute == Danish filmmaking remains influenced by the state through the Danish Film Institute (DFI), which was founded in 1972. DFI is Denmark's national agency for film and cinema culture, operating under the Ministry of Culture. DFI supports the development, production and distribution of films and run the national archives. Support programmes also extend to international co-productions film education and international promotion at film festivals. The DFI includes a library, a stills and posters archive and a film archive. The DFI Film House is open to the public and houses the national Cinematheque. The DFI supports the production of 20-25 feature films and 25-30 documentary and short films every year. There are three kinds of support: the film commissioner scheme, the market scheme and the talent development scheme at New Danish Screen. The DFI encourages international partnerships and allows for 5-9 minor co-productions in feature film and 4-6 minor co-productions in documentary film per year. A cornerstone of Danish film policy is to fund children and youth films to which 25 percent of all subsidies are allocated. DFI has received criticism for lack of innovation (notably, Dogme 95 happened in spite of funding from the Film Institute) and is sometimes accused of nepotism and cronyism, for example when film commissioner Mikael Olsen from 1998 to 1999 greenlighted 28 million kroner of subsidy money to his childhood- friend Peter Aalbæk Jensen, then went on to work for him in a high-ranking position.Berlingske Tidende: Filmfolk: Konsulenterne skal have magten The Danish Film Institute however has also achieved a high level of professionalism even if more or less reserved for a few selected genres and production companies (mainly Nordisk Film, Zentropa and Nimbus Film).Information: Der mangler innovation i filmbranchen In February 2008, Nordisk Film bought half of Zentropa, which frequently coproduces with Nimbus Film, but such tax-funded, state-sanctioned monopolies are rarely frowned upon in Denmark.TV2 Finans: Nordisk Film køber Zentropa == Nominations and awards  Danish films nominated for César Award for Best Foreign Film === *1997 - Breaking the Waves (Lars von Trier) (won) *1999 - The Celebration (Thomas Vinterberg) *2001 - Dancer in the Dark (Lars von Trier) === Danish films nominated for César Award for Best European Union Film === *2004 - Dogville (Lars von Trier) === Danish films nominated for Academy Award for Best Foreign Language film === *1956 - Qivitoq (Erik Balling) *1959 - Paw (Astrid Henning- Jensen) *1961 - Harry and the Butler (Bent Christensen) *1987 - Babette's Feast (Gabriel Axel) (won) *1988 - Pelle the Conqueror (Bille August) (won) *1989 - Waltzing Regitze (Kaspar Rostrup) *1996 - All Things Fair (Bo Widerberg) (Swedish/Danish coproduction) *2007 - After the Wedding (Susanne Bier) *2011 - In a Better World (Susanne Bier) (won) *2013 - A Royal Affair (Nikolaj Arcel) *2014 - The Hunt (Thomas Vinterberg) *2016 - A War (Tobias Lindholm) *2017 - Land of Mine (Martin Zandvliet) === Danish films nominated for Best European film === *1988 - Pelle the Conqueror (Bille August) *1996 - Breaking the Waves (Lars von Trier) (won) *1998 - The Celebration (Thomas Vinterberg) *1999 - Mifune's Last Song (Søren Kragh-Jacobsen) *2000 - Dancer in the Dark (Lars von Trier) (won) *2001 - Italian for Beginners (Lone Scherfig) *2002 - Lilja 4-ever (Lukas Moodysson) (Swedish/Danish/Estonian coproduction) *2003 - Dogville (Lars von Trier) *2004 - A Hole in My Heart (Lukas Moodysson) (Swedish/Danish coproduction) *2005 - Brothers (Susanne Bier) *2011 - In a Better World (Susanne Bier) *2011 - Melancholia (Lars von Trier) (won) *2012 - The Hunt (Thomas Vinterberg) *2014 - Nymphomaniac (Lars von Trier) === Danish directors nominated for Best European Director === *2003 - Lars von Trier, Dogville (won) *2005 - Susanne Bier, Brothers *2006 - Susanne Bier, After the Wedding *2009 - Lars von Trier, Antichrist *2011 - Susanne Bier, In a Better World (won) *2011 - Lars von Trier, Melancholia *2012 - Thomas Vinterberg, The Hunt === Sundance Film Festival award === On 30 January 2010 in Los Angeles, Mads Brügger's \\"The Red Chapel,\\" (Danish: Det Røde Kapel) won the grand jury prize for the best world documentary at the Sundance Film Festival.

Piccolo's and Sayers's sharply differing temperaments and racial backgrounds made them unlikely to become as close friends as they did, including becoming the first interracial roommates in the history of the National Football League, and the film chronicles the evolution of their friendship, ending with Piccolo's death in 1970. The production was such a success on ABC that it was later shown in theaters by Columbia Pictures,Thomas, Bob (then-parent and future corporate sibling of the movie's production company, Screen Gems). \\"TV 'Brian's Song' on movie screens\\", The Dallas Morning News, April 29, 1972, page 2. with a major premiere in Chicago; however, it was soon withdrawn for lack of business. Critics have called the movie one of the finest telefilms ever made.Harry Bowman. \\"Broadcast Beat [TV column]: 'Brian's Song' superior film\\", The Dallas Morning News, November 27, 1971, page 7A. A 2005 readers poll taken by Entertainment Weekly ranked Brian's Song seventh in its list of the top \\"guy- cry\\" films ever made. The movie is based on Sayers's account of his friendship with Piccolo and coping with Piccolo's illness in Sayers's 1970 autobiography, I Am Third. The film was written by veteran screenwriter William Blinn, whose script one Dallas television critic called \\"highly restrained, steering clear of any overt sentimentality [yet conveying] the genuine affection the two men felt so deeply for each other.\\" Although based on a true story, the film does include some fictional scenes. For example, the head coach, George Halas (played by Jack Warden), tells Sayers that he wants to bench Piccolo when he suspects that there may be a problem affecting his performance. He later learns of Brian's cancer. In reality, Jim Dooley was the head coach at that time, as Halas had retired from the position following the 1967 season. ==Plot== The movie begins as Chicago Bears rookie running back Gale Sayers (Williams) arrives at team practice as an errant punt is sent to Sayers. Fellow rookie running back Brian Piccolo (Caan) goes to retrieve the ball, and Sayers flips it to him. Before Sayers meets with coach George Halas (Jack Warden) in his office, Piccolo tells him – as a prank – that Halas has a hearing problem, and Sayers acts strangely at the meeting. Sayers pranks him back by placing mashed potatoes on his seat while Piccolo is singing his alma mater's fight song. During practice, Piccolo struggles while Sayers shines. Sayers and Piccolo are placed as roommates, a rarity during the racial strife at the time. When they are placed together Brian is scared he didn't make the team, and Gale makes a great point saying \\"if you didn't make the team, we wouldn't be placed together as roommates.\\" Their friendship flourishes, in football and in life, quickly extending to their wives, Joy Piccolo and Linda Sayers. Sayers quickly becomes a standout player, but he injures his knee in a game against the San Francisco 49ers. To aid in Sayers's recovery, Piccolo brings a weight machine to his house. In Sayers' place, Piccolo rushes for 160 yards in a 17–16 win over the Los Angeles Rams and is given the game ball. Piccolo challenges Sayers to a race across the park, where Sayers stumbles but wins. Piccolo wins the starting fullback position, meaning both he and Sayers will now be on the field together, and both excel in their roles. Piccolo starts to lose weight and his performance declines, so he is sent to a hospital for a diagnosis. Soon after, Halas tells Sayers that Piccolo has cancer and will have part of a lung removed. In an emotional speech to his teammates, Sayers states that they will win the game for Piccolo and give him the game ball. When the players later visit the hospital, Piccolo teases them about losing the game, laughing that the line in the old movie wasn’t \\"let’s blow one for the Gipper.\\" After a game against the St. Louis Cardinals, Sayers visits Joy, who reveals that Piccolo has to have another surgery for his tumor. After he is awarded the \\"George S. Halas Most Courageous Player Award\\", Sayers dedicates his award to Piccolo, telling the crowd that they had selected the wrong person for the prize and saying, \\"I love Brian Piccolo, and I'd like all of you to love him, too. And tonight, when you hit your knees, please ask God to love him.\\" In a call, Sayers mentions that he gave Piccolo a pint of blood while he was in critical condition. Piccolo dies with his wife by his side. The movie ends with a flashback of Piccolo and Sayers running through the park, while Halas narrates that Piccolo died at age 26 and is remembered not for how he died but for how he lived. ==Cast== *James Caan as Brian Piccolo *Billy Dee Williams as Gale Sayers *Jack Warden as Coach George Halas *Shelley Fabares as Joy Piccolo *Judy Pace as Linda Sayers *Bernie Casey as J.C.

K-Swiss. Retrieved on January 12, 2010. ==History== K-Swiss was founded in 1966 in Los Angeles, California by two Swiss brothers, Art and Ernie Brunner. They became interested in tennis after immigrating to the United States. They imported the patent leather tennis shoes from the Swiss Kuenzli shoe manufacturer, re- naming their company K-Swiss (K is for Künzli). In the 1990s, Steven Nichols boosted K-Swiss's marketing budget, and hired a number of key individuals from large companies, such as Procter and Gamble, and began a marketing blitz around the K-Swiss brand. Award-winning Creative Director Mindy Gale led her NY based agency team in developing and producing K-Swiss advertising and publicity campaigns from 1997 through 2008. The \\"I Wear My K-Swiss\\" multi- media campaign ran for five consecutive years, targeting young urban consumers in print and on TV. A re-branding campaign appealing to a wider modern female target, featuring Anna Kournikova rolled out in 2007. Advertising campaigns encouraged users to personalize the trademark stripes under the slogan \\"Put Your Spin on It.\\" The brand includes their color changing K-Swiss Tongue Twister in 2003, the Stripe Shifter, and more recently their Band Em footwear styles. K-Swiss purchased the majority stake of Australian brand Royal Elastics in 2001. In 2003, they acquired 100% ownership of the company; in 2008, it was sold to a Taiwanese businessman, Eric Ma, who then went bankrupt in 2014, and refused to pay the rest contracted money, but transferred the brand's ownership to his mother. In July 2011, a video was released wherein Kenny Powers purchased 51% of K-Swiss stock. In January 2013, Kenny Powers was lubing the deals because the company — which posted $195 million in losses between 2009 and 2012 — was sold to Korean firm E-Land World Limited for $170 million. The following May, E-Land named a new executive team to oversee the newly formed K-Swiss Inc., including Truman Kim as chairman and Larry Remington as president and CEO. On June 1, 2015, K-Swiss acquired Supra Footwear.http://footwearnews.com/2015/business/mergers-acquisitions/k-swiss- purchases-supra-kr3w-32967/ ==Marketing== In September 2014, the company updated its brand identity. Keeping the K-Swiss name it unveiled a new marque. The new identity was created by a recently appointed internal creative team and plays up the company’s heritage as an American tennis brand. All aspects of the new brand’s design, including its 1966 typeface and tennis court colour palette, hark back to this identity. The company has been sponsoring events that appeal to their market as well as events which are likely to shape buying attitudes and help generate a positive reaction. One example is the sponsorship of Ireland's first sneaker convention run by Dub City Sneakz in Dún Laoghaire which K-Swiss sponsored. In 2016, K-Swiss president Barney Waters made it the brand's mission to \\"make sneakers for entrepreneurs.\\" The brand furthered this marketing angle by launching a collaboration with entrepreneur Gary Vaynerchuk in 2017. The company has since launched campaigns with other entrepreneurs, including Karen Civil, Ben Baller, and Natalie Ellis. In 2019, K-Swiss debuted a shoe collaboration with TV series Breaking Bad. ==References*Kuenzli Schuhe (Swiss) History Category:American companies established in 1966 Category:Clothing companies established in 1966 Category:Manufacturing companies based in Greater Los Angeles Category:Companies based in Westlake Village, California Category:Sporting goods manufacturers of the United States Category:Athletic shoe brands Category:Shoe brands Category:Shoe companies of the United States Category:Sportswear brands Category:Companies formerly listed on NASDAQ Category:1966 establishments in California Category:1990 initial public offerings Category:2013 mergers and acquisitions Category:American subsidiaries of foreign companies Category:E-Land Group ","title":"K-Swiss"},{"id":"2212677","text":"Jodel D140C Mousquetaire Jodel D150 Société Avions Jodel is a French aircraft company started in 1946 by Édouard Joly and his son-in-law Jean Délémontez. ==History== Jodel designed a range of light aeroplanes shortly after the Second World War. The popular myth is that the two industrialists, with no formal aerodynamics training, set about designing a single-seat aircraft with some spare plywood and a small engine, a Poinsard 25hp 2-cyl. The result was the 1948 D9 Bébé (Baby) model. In fact, the two had much experience of building and designing aircraft, Delemontez being a trained aeronautical engineer, and Joly having built an aircraft before the war. The French government bought many of the aircraft, with more than 500 D9s being built during the next twenty years. Subsequently, the government expressed interest in a larger aircraft as a trainer and the two-seat D11 model followed in 1950. Jodel aircraft are all-wood, usually made from Sitka spruce and plywood made out of okoume (also known as gaboon), a kind of West African hardwood. Most of the designs are recognisable by their distinctive wings, which have ‘cranked’ dihedral only on the outer third. The wings also incorporate washout, retaining aileron effectiveness at or just prior to the stall. From above or below, the wings are also distinctive as this cranked section of the wing tapers sharply towards the wingtip. The design is popular in France and in Southern Europe, UK, but the type is little known in the USA. In Australia, the design has been brought up to date somewhat by Frank Rogers who produced new drawings to standards suited to Australian amateur builders. ==Production under license== Apart from prototypes, Jodels were made by a variety of French aviation manufacturers, but all construction ceased during the 1960s. Since that time, the Jodel company only sells licences to build its models and detailed plans to amateur builders of homebuilt aircraft. The Jodel designs were later licensed to the following companies which produced derivative designs that retained the Jodel wing: * Avions Robin, France *Aero Difusión, Spain *Falconar Avia, Canada ==Aircraft== The first model was built in 1948.

It has mostly smooth bark, juvenile leaves that are whitish and waxy on the lower surface, glossy green, lance-shaped adult leaves, glaucous, ribbed flower buds arranged singly or in groups of three or seven in leaf axils, white flowers and woody fruit. There are four subspecies, each with a different distribution, occurring in New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania.flower buds of subsp. bicostatafruit of subsp. bicostata ==Description== Eucalyptus globulus is a tree that typically grows to a height of but may sometimes only be a stunted shrub, or alternatively under ideal conditions can grow as tall as , and forms a lignotuber. The bark is usually smooth, white to cream-coloured but there are sometimes slabs of persistent, unshed bark at the base. Young plants, often several metres tall, and coppice regrowth have stems that are more or less square in cross-section with a prominent wing on each corner. Juvenile leaves are mostly arranged in opposite pairs, sessile, glaucous elliptic to egg- shaped, up to long and wide. Adult leaves are arranged alternately, the same glossy to dark green on both sides, lance-shaped or curved, long and wide on a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged singly or in groups of three or seven in leaf axils, sometimes sessile or on a short thick peduncle. The individual buds are also usually sessile, sometimes on a pedicel up to long. Mature buds are top-shaped to conical, glaucous or green, with a flattened hemispherical, warty operculum with a central knob. Flowering time varies with subspecies and distribution but the flowers are always white. The fruit is a woody conical or hemispherical capsule with the valves close to rim level. ==Taxonomy and naming== Eucalyptus globulus was first formally described in 1800 by the French botanist Jacques Labillardière in his book, Relation du Voyage à la Recherche de la Pérouse. Labillardière collected specimens at Recherche Bay during the d'Entrecasteaux expedition in 1792. The d'Entrecasteaux expedition made immediate use of the species when they discovered it, the timber being used to improve their oared boats. The Tasmanian blue gum was proclaimed as the floral emblem of Tasmania on 27 November 1962. The species name is from the Latin globulus, a little ball or small sphere, referring to the shape of the fruit. In 1974, James Barrie Kirkpatrick described four subspecies and the names have been accepted by the Australian Plant Census. Each subspecies has a characteristic arrangement of its flower buds: * Eucalyptus globulus subsp. bicostata (Maiden, Blakely & Simmonds) J.B.Kirkp. (formerly Eucalyptus bicostata), commonly known as southern blue gum, eurabbie, blue gum or Victorian blue gum has sessile flower buds arranged in groups of three; * Eucalyptus globulus Labill. subsp. globulus, commonly known as Tasmanian blue gum, southern blue gum or blue gum has flower buds arranged singly in leaf axils; * Eucalyptus globulus subsp. maidenii (F.Muell.) J.B.Kirkp. (formerly Eucalyptus maidenii), commonly known as Maiden's gum has flower buds arranged in groups of seven; * Eucalyptus globulus subsp. pseudoglobulus (Naudin) J.B.Kirkp. (formerly Eucalyptus globulus var. pseudoglobulus), commonly known as Victorian eurabbie has pedicellate flower buds arranged in groups of three. ==Distribution and habitat== Blue gum grows in forests in New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania, including some of the Bass Strait Islands. Subspecies bicostata occurs in montane and tableland areas between the Carrai Plateau in northern New South Wales and the Pyrenees in Victoria. Subspecies globulus is mainly found in lowland parts of Tasmania, but is also found on some Bass Strait islands including King Island, and in the extreme south-west of Victoria. Subspecies maidenii occurs on near-coastal ranges of south-eastern New South Wales and eastern Victoria. Subspecies pseudoglobulus is mostly distributed in eastern Gippsland but there are isolated populations further inland and in the Nadgee Nature Reserve in south-eastern New South Wales. There are naturalised non- native occurrences in Spain and Portugal, and other parts of southern Europe incl. Cyprus, southern Africa, New Zealand, western United States (California), Hawaii, Macaronesia, and Chile. ==Unusual specimens== They typically grow from tall. The tallest currently known specimen in Tasmania is tall.Giant Trees Consultative Committee There are historical claims of even taller trees, the tallest being .Lewin, D. W. 1906: The Eucalypti Hardwood Timbers of Tasmania ==Plantations== Large blue gum eucalyptus in Pleasanton, California, in height and in circumference. Blue gum is one of the most extensively planted eucalypts. Its rapid growth and adaptability to a range of conditions is responsible for its popularity. It is especially well-suited to countries with a Mediterranean-type climate, but also grows well in high altitudes in the tropics.Hillis, W.E., Brown, A.G., Eucalypts for Wood Production, Academic Press, 1984, p20, It comprises 65% of all plantation hardwood in Australia with approximately planted. In about 1860 Francis Cook planted the tree on Monserrate Palace, his property at Sintra in Portugal and within twenty years it had attained the height of 100 m and a circumference of 5 m. By 1878 the tree ″had spread from one end of Portugal to the other″. In 1878 the tree was also planted, partly on Cook's recommendation, in Galway, Ireland to reclaim ″useless bog land″. E. globulus begun to be planted as plantations in Los Lagos and Los Ríos regions of Chile in the 1990s. However at these latitudes around the 40th parallel south the tree is at the southern border of the climatic conditions where it can grow, hence good growth in this part of southern Chile requires good site selection such as sunny north-facing slopes. Some of these plantations grow on red clay soil. ==UsesTimber=== Blue gum timber is yellow-brown, fairly heavy, with an interlocked grain, and is difficult to season.Cribb, A.B. & J.W., Useful Wild Plants in Australia, Collins 1982, p25 It has poor lumber qualities due to growth stress problems, but can be used in construction, fence posts and poles.Index of Species Information, Eucalyptus globulus ===Pulpwood= Essential oil === The leaves are steam distilled to extract eucalyptus oil.

Naturalists, ecologists, and the United States National Park Service consider it an invasive species due to its ability to quickly spread via seeds and displace native plant communities, while local authorities, especially many fire departments across California consider it to be a major fire hazard,California Invasive Plant Council (Cal-IPC) Invasive Plant Inventory 2006 http://www.cal-ipc.org/ip/inventory/pdf/Inventory2006.pdf although the United States Department of Agriculture does not list it among its \\"Invasive and Noxious plants\\" list in California. Due to these factors, programs across the state of California have been established to remove eucalyptus growth, and restore native biomes in certain park areas, such as on Angel Island in San Francisco Bay, and in the hills of Oakland, California. ==See also== * List of superlative trees ==References * Botanical characteristics of Eucalyptus globulus * Australian National Botanic Gardens * Chronology of the discovery of Eucalyptus globulus Iglesias Trabado, Gustavo (2007).

It was founded in 1875. In the fall of 2017, Park had an enrollment of 11,457 students. ==History== The school which was originally called Park College was founded in 1875 by John A. McAfee on land donated by George S. Park with its initial structure being the stone hotel Park owned on the bluff above the Missouri River. The original concept called for students to receive free tuition and board in exchange for working up to half day in the college's farm, electrical shop or printing plant. According to the terms of the arrangement if the “Parkville Experiment” did not work out within five years, the college grounds were to revert to Park. Centennial History of Missouri: (the Center State) One Hundred Years in the Union, 1820-1921 By Walter Barlow Stevens –1921 – S.J. Clarke Publishing – Page 41 (available on print.google.com) There were 17 students in the first school year and in the first graduation class there were five women. McAfee led until his death in 1890. His son Lowell M. McAfee became the second president of Park until stepping down in 1913. The first international student at Park University arrived in 1880 from Japan. The defining landmark of the campus is Mackay Hall, named after Carroll County, Illinois banker Duncan Mackay who donated $25,000 in materials for the structure shortly before his death.Decatur Daily Dispatch - Among Our Neighbors - 1890-09-11 The building was constructed using limestone mined on the campus grounds and built with the labor of students. Construction began in 1883 and was finished by 1893. Today the building is the main focal point of the campus and dominates the hillside, overlooking the town of Parkville. It is on the National Register of Historic Places. For many decades the school was affiliated with the Presbyterian Church but it no longer has that affiliation. The college has had a relationship with the military since 1889. However, the relationship was greatly expanded in the late 1960s with the establishment of a Military Degree Completion Program and later in 1972 with the Military Resident Center System. Park's total enrollment has grown from its small base since 1996 when it first began offering online courses. In 2000, it was renamed Park University. ==Locations== The flagship campus of Park University is located in the city of Parkville, Missouri. The Park University Graduate School is located in downtown Kansas City, Missouri. There are 41 campuses in 22 U.S. states including four campuses in the Kansas City area (Downtown Kansas City, Independence, Lenexa and Parkville) and a campus center in Austin, Texas. Most of the satellite campuses are on or near United States military bases and share quarters with other businesses/organizations.

The film expands the original story to include sex and broad adult humor, as well as original songs. The film was directed by Bud Townsend, produced by William Osco, and written by Bucky Searles, based on a concept by Jason Williams. The plot revolves around Alice (Kristine De Bell), a librarian who falls asleep reading the book Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, and dreams of the White Rabbit (Larry Gelman), whom she follows into Wonderland, where she begins to experiment with her unexplored sexuality. Through a series of sexual encounters, Alice loses her sexual inhibitions and allows herself to become sexually liberated. The film is a softcore erotic comedy with orchestrated musical numbers which move the plot forward, and contribute to the film's humor. After premiering in a longer version, three minutes were edited from the film, and it was rated R by the MPAA, and released theatrically by General National, a company formed by producers Jason Williams and William Osco, due to other distributors being unwilling to distribute a sex film. The film grossed over $90million at the box office. Osco later re-edited the film as hardcore, incorporating explicit sex that was not part of its original production. In 2004, Osco staged an Off-Broadway stage adaptation of the musical. ==Plot== After rejecting the advances of her boyfriend, William (Ron Nelson), mousy librarian Alice falls asleep reading Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. The White Rabbit appears to her in a dream and she follows him into Wonderland. Finding herself in a room and too large to fit through the small door, Alice drinks a potion which causes her to shrink while her dress remains the same size, leaving her naked. While chasing the White Rabbit, she falls into a river and begins to drown, but is saved by a group of local inhabitants. After making friends with them, Alice is given a new (albeit very revealing) dress before setting off after the White Rabbit again. While walking through the woods, she begins to experiment with her sexuality by stripping naked and masturbating. The White Rabbit happens upon her and takes her to meet the Mad Hatter. After being initially uncomfortable when the Mad Hatter exposes his penis to her, Alice ultimately performs fellatio on him. She is then called to assist Humpty Dumpty, who has fallen off a wall, causing him to lose the ability to achieve an erection. The situation is rectified when Alice performs fellatio on Dumpty as well. She is then taken to meet siblings Tweedledee and Tweedledum, whom she watches having passionate but incestuous intercourse. Following this encounter, Alice, the White Rabbit, and the Mad Hatter continue on toward the King's Ball. On the way, they come across a couple having sex in an open field; Alice chastises them, but she is ignored. At the royal court, the King of Hearts converses with Alice, speaking with her about self-empowerment and ignoring the judgements of others; he ultimately seduces her. The Queen of Hearts suddenly appears, catching Alice and the King in bed together. A hurried trial is held and Alice is \\"convicted\\" of being a virgin. As punishment, the Queen orders Alice to have sex with her. A number of sexual escapades ensue among various characters as Alice prepares to carry out her sentence, including a brief lesbian encounter between Alice and the Queen's maids. Alice and the Queen engage in lesbian sex, but, as a result of the cunnilingus she receives from Alice, the Queen experiences an orgasm so strong, it briefly incapacitates her. The Mad Hatter and the White Rabbit assist Alice in escaping the Queen, who pursues her to no avail. Waking from her dream and thereby returning to the real world, Alice meets William again. Having experienced a sexual awakening while in Wonderland, Alice accepts William's advances and they have sex in the library. In a closing sequence, Alice travels through Wonderland naked before she and William set off toward their new home, where they live \\"happily ever after\\". ==Cast== * Kristine De Bell as Alice * Larry Gelman as the White Rabbit * Alan Novak as the Mad Hatter * Terry Hall as Nurse * Jason Williams as the White Knight * Ron Nelson as William * Bucky Searles as Humpty Dumpty / the Queen of Hearts' Brother * Gila Havana as the Black Knight's Girl * J.P.

Williams pitched the film to producer William Osco, who liked the idea, hired comedian Bucky Searles to write the screenplay and songs, and raised $100,000 for the budget. Production took place in New York City. Williams ran an ad in the Village Voice seeking auditions for an \\"X-rated musical\\", instructing that applicants \\"must be able to sing and dance\\". Williams was too busy with other aspects of the film's production to direct, so Bud Townsend was hired to direct instead. Townsend, whom Williams had met auditioning for his horror film Terror at Red Wolf Inn, was a prolific director of television commercials. Though Townsend had never directed a sex film before, he was hired to helm Alice in Wonderland, along with his wife, Patty, who served as the script supervisor. The dancing was choreographed by Buddy Schwab, a successful choreographer with Broadway credits. The film was initially going to be shot on 16mm film, but Townsend talked the producers into filming on 35mm film. Juliet Graham auditioned for the role of Alice, but was offered the role of the Queen of Hearts instead, which she accepted. Through a modeling agency, Kristine De Bell was cast as Alice. The 20-year-old fashion model had a background in musical theater, and could sing and dance. Many of the actors were regulars of New York's porn scene, while others were prominent character actors such as Larry Gelman, a friend of the screenwriter, who agreed to play the White Rabbit if he didn't have to appear nude, and if his wife and children could be flown out to New York on the production's budget. The auditions for singing and dancing performers primarily emphasized the actors' dancing abilities, as the producers planned to re-record most of the singing with professional singers. Filming took place in ten continuous days in either June or July 1975. During filming, most of the actors stayed in the house used in the film. A scratch track of the film's musical numbers was used for the actors to lip synch to during filming. The initial plan was to produce the film as hardcore, but once filming commenced Williams said, \\"The vision for the film rapidly started expanding. We had these big sets, elaborate design, and we had this big opportunity. So we had this relatively short shooting schedule and we didn't have much time to go in and do a lot of close-up stuff that you need for hardcore,\\" so the sex scenes were filmed in wide shots. De Bell performed in an unsimulated lesbian sex scene with Juliet Graham. Cast and crew described Osco as being an intimidating figure, with Juliet Graham saying that Osco threatened not to pay her if she didn't spend an evening in his hotel room, and she did, but didn't have sex with him, telling Osco she was the girlfriend of porn actor Jamie Gillis. Osco convinced De Bell to allow him to film her performing oral sex on Osco, saying it was necessary for the film. The film's budget was entirely spent on filming, and the production company Kaleidoscope Films provided $250,000 to $300,000 for the film's post- production. Musician and composer Peter Matz re-recorded the film's songs in full orchestral arrangements, and post-production was completed by the end of 1975. ==Release== The film's premiere was held on Times Square in 1976, at an event attended by Andy Warhol. It was well-received, but the producers could not interest a distributor because of an unwillingness to release a sex film, so Williams and Osco decided to form a new company to distribute it, calling it General National, explaining, \\"At that time, there was a company called 'National General' [...] so if we just call ourselves 'General National' everybody will think it's the same damn big company, and we'll get treated in the same way.\\" For the general release, three minutes were removed, and the MPAA gave it a R rating. Concurrent with the film's release, De Bell appeared on the cover of Playboy. Osco sold the foreign distribution rights to multiple distributors within the same territories, telling each distributor they had exclusive distribution rights. The film grossed over $90million globally. According to De Bell the film grossed over $100million, and although she told an interviewer she had 1% ownership of the film she did not see any of the profits. In October 1976, lawyers for the Taconic Park Commission threatened a lawsuit against Osco after finding out he had filmed on historical sites without permission. A month later, the film was reviewed by film critic Roger Ebert, who wrote, \\"Maybe because I went with low expectations, I found the movie a pleasant surprise. And its most pleasant surprise is its star, Kristine De Bell, who projects such a freshness and naivete that she charms us even in scenes where some rather alarming things are going on. I think she has a future in the movies, and not just Xmovies, either; there's an openness to her expression, a directness to her acting, that's genuinely appealing.\\" Williams and Osco planned to make an adult film based on The Wonderful Wizard of Oz as a follow-up, but it was not produced. Subsequently, Williams, Osco and De Bell made the film The Great American Girl Robbery. Williams and Osco also planned to produce an American Graffiti-style film, and Pee Wee Pigskin, a Bad News Bears-inspired football film with children. After Alice in Wonderland was released as softcore, Osco re-edited the film as hardcore, inserting explicit penetration shots that were not part of the original filming, including the footage of De Bell performing oral sex on Osco, which was edited into the Mad Hatter sequence. Subsequently, multiple people in the production, as well as Kaleidoscope Films, sued Osco, who had not paid some of them and had stolen money from others. Kaleidoscope ended up owning the rights to the film as a result of the lawsuit. Osco had prints of the film stolen so he could redistribute it without the owners' permission. The film's R-rated and hardcore versions were distributed on VHS, and in 2007, Subversive Cinema released a DVD containing the softcore and hardcore versions of the film. ==Adaptations== In January 2004, Osco produced and directed an off-Broadway musical adaptation of Alice in Wonderland at the Kirk Theatre, New York. The stage production, entitled Alice in Wonderland: An Adult Musical Comedy, features an original score by TayWah and advertising that it is \\"for mature audiences only\\" and \\"contains full nudity\\". The show is set in a trailer park in Weehawken, New Jersey and follows Alice's sexual awakening as she \\"escapes her boyfriend's advances and mother's drunken rants\\" into a new erotic world. Ken Russell planned a remake of the 1976 film, and co-wrote a screenplay for it with Osco, but Russell died before it could be produced. As of December 2011, Russell's widow and Osco were still moving forward with the remake's production, as a tribute to Russell. ==ReferencesCategory:1976 films Category:American films Category:English-language films Category:1970s musical fantasy films Category:1970s musical comedy films Category:1970s pornographic films Category:American independent films Category:American sex comedy films Category:American musical comedy films Category:American musical fantasy films Category:Films based on Alice in Wonderland Category:Films based on multiple works Category:Films directed by Bud Townsend Category:Films set in New York (state) Category:Films shot in New York (state) Category:Erotic fantasy films Category:Erotic musical films Category:1970s sex comedy films Category:1976 comedy films ","title":"Alice in Wonderland (1976 film)"},{"id":"2212696","text":"Social comparison theory, initially proposed by social psychologist Leon Festinger in 1954, centers on the belief that there is a drive within individuals to gain accurate self-evaluations. The theory explains how individuals evaluate their own opinions and abilities by comparing themselves to others in order to reduce uncertainty in these domains, and learn how to define the self. Following the initial theory, research began to focus on social comparison as a way of self-enhancement, introducing the concepts of downward and upward comparisons and expanding the motivations of social comparisons.Schachter, S. (1959). The psychology of affiliation: Experimental studies of the sources of gregariousness (Vol. 1). Stanford University Press. == Initial framework == In the theory, Festinger provided nine main hypotheses. First, he stated that humans have a basic drive to evaluate their opinions and abilities and that people evaluate themselves through objective, nonsocial means (Hypothesis I). Second, Festinger stated that if objective, nonsocial means were not available, that people evaluate their opinions and abilities by comparison to other people (Hypothesis II). Next, he hypothesized that the tendency to compare oneself to another person decreases as the difference between their opinions and abilities becomes more divergent. In other words, if someone is much different from you, you are less likely to compare yourself to that person (Hypothesis III). He next hypothesized that there is a unidirectional drive upward in the case of abilities, which is largely absent in opinions. This drive refers to the value that is placed on doing better and better.Suls, J., Miller, R. (1977). \\"Social Comparison Processes: Theoretical and Empirical Perspectives\\". Hemisphere Publishing Corp., Washington D.C. (Hypothesis IV). Next, Festinger hypothesizes that there are non-social restraints that make it difficult or even impossible to change one's ability and these restraints are largely absent for opinions. In other words, people can change their opinions when they want to but no matter how motivated individuals may be to improve their ability, there may be other elements that make this impossible (Hypothesis V). Festinger goes on to hypothesize that the cessation of comparison with others is accompanied by hostility or derogation to the extent that continued comparison with those persons implies unpleasant consequences (Hypothesis VI). Next, any factors which increase the importance of some particular group as a comparison group from some particular opinion or ability will increase the pressure toward uniformity concerning that ability or opinion within that group. If discrepancies arise between the evaluator and comparison group there is a tendency to reduce the divergence by either attempting to persuade others, or changing their personal views to attain uniformity. However, the importance, relevance and attraction to a comparison group that affects the original motivation for comparison, mediates the pressures towards uniformity (Hypothesis VII). His next hypothesis states that if persons who are very divergent from one's own opinion or ability are perceived as different from oneself on attributes consistent with the divergence, the tendency to narrow the range of comparability becomes stronger (Hypothesis VIII). Lastly, Festinger hypothesized that when there is a range of opinion or ability in a group, the relative strength of the three manifestations of pressures toward uniformity will be different for those who are close to the mode of the group than for those who are distant from the mode. Those close to the mode will have stronger tendencies to change the positions of others, weaker tendencies to narrow the range of comparison, and even weaker tendencies to change their own opinions (Hypothesis IX). == Theoretical advances == Since its inception, the initial framework has undergone several advances. Key among these are developments in understanding the motivations that underlie social comparisons, and the particular types of social comparisons that are made. Motives that are relevant to social comparison include self-enhancement, maintenance of a positive self-evaluation, components of attributions and validation, and the avoidance of closure. While there have been changes in Festinger's original concept, many fundamental aspects remain, including the prevalence of the tendency towards social comparison and the general process that is social comparison. === Self-evaluation === According to Thorton and Arrowood, self-evaluation is one of the functions of social comparison. This is one process that underlies how an individual engages in social comparison. Each individual's specific goals will influence how they engage in social comparison. For self-evaluation, people tend to choose a comparison target that is similar to themselves. Specifically, they are most interested in choosing a target who shares some distinctive characteristic with themselves. Research suggests that most people believe that choosing a similar target helps ensure the accuracy of the self-evaluation. However, individuals do not always act as unbiased self-evaluators, and accurate self-evaluations may not be the primary goal of social comparison. === Self-enhancement === Individuals may also seek self-enhancement, or to improve their self-esteem. They may interpret, distort, or ignore the information gained by social comparison to see themselves more positively and further their self-enhancement goals. They will also choose to make upward (comparing themselves to someone better off) or downward (comparing themselves to someone worse off) comparisons, depending on which strategy will further their self-enhancement goals. They may also avoid making comparisons period, or avoid making certain types of comparisons. Specifically, when an individual believes that their ability in a specific area is low, they will avoid making upward social comparisons in that area. Unlike for self-evaluation goals, people engaging in social comparison with the goal of self-enhancement may not seek out a target that is similar to themselves. In fact, if a target's similarity is seen as a threat, due to the target outperforming the individual on some dimension, the individual may downplay the similarity of the target to themselves. This notion ties closely to the phenomena in psychology introduced also by Leon Festinger himself as it relates to the diminishing of cognitive dissonance. One does not want to perceive oneself in a way which would downplay one's original belief upon which one's self-esteem is based and therefore in order to reduce the cognitive dissonance, one is willing to change the cognitive representation of the other person whom one compares oneself to, such that one's own belief about oneself remains intact. This effectively leads to the comparison of apples to oranges or psychological denial. Later advances in theory led to self-enhancement being one of the four self-evaluation motives:, along with self-assessment, self-verification, and self-improvement. ===Upward and downward social comparisons=== Wills introduced the concept of downward comparison in 1981. Downward social comparison is a defensive tendency that is used as a means of self-evaluation. When a person looks to another individual or group that they consider to be worse off than themselves in order to feel better about their self or personal situation, they are making a downward social comparison. Research has suggested that social comparisons with others who are better off or superior, or upward comparisons, can lower self-regard, whereas downward comparisons can elevate self-regard. Downward comparison theory emphasizes the positive effects of comparisons in increasing one's subjective well-being. For example, it has been found that breast cancer patients made the majority of comparisons with patients less fortunate than themselves. Although social comparison research has suggested that upward comparisons can lower self-regard, Collins indicates that this is not always the case. Individuals make upward comparisons, whether consciously or subconsciously, when they compare themselves with an individual or comparison group that they perceive as superior or better than themselves in order to improve their views of self or to create a more positive perception of their personal reality. Upward social comparisons are made to self-evaluate and self-improve in the hopes that self-enhancement will also occur. In an upward social comparison, people want to believe themselves to be part of the elite or superior, and make comparisons highlighting the similarities between themselves and the comparison group, unlike a downward social comparison, where similarities between individuals or groups are disassociated. It has also been suggested that upward comparisons may provide an inspiration to improve, and in one study it was found that while breast cancer patients made more downward comparisons, they showed a preference for information about more fortunate others. Another study indicated that people who were dieting often used upward social comparisons by posting pictures of thinner people on their refrigerators. These pictures served as not only a reminder of an individuals current weight, but also as an inspiration of a goal to be reached. In simple terms, downward social comparisons are more likely to make us feel better about ourselves, while upward social comparisons are more likely to motivate us to achieve more or reach higher. ===Moderators of social comparison=== Aspinwall and Taylor looked at mood, self-esteem, and threat as moderators that drive individuals to choose to make upward or downward social comparisons. Downward comparisons in cases where individuals had experienced a threat to their self-esteem produced more favorable self-evaluations. High self-esteem and social comparison Aspinwall and Taylor found that upward social comparisons were good in circumstances where the individuals making the comparisons had high self-esteem, because these types of comparisons provided them with more motivation and hope than downward social comparisons. However, if these individuals had experienced a recent threat or setback to their self- esteem, they reported that upward comparisons resulted in a more negative affect than downward comparisons. Low self-esteem and social comparison However, people with low self-esteem or people who are experiencing some sort of threat in their life (such as doing poorly in school, or suffering from an illness) tend to favor downward comparisons over upward comparisons. People with low self-esteem and negative affect improve their mood by making downward comparisons. Their mood does not improve as much as it would if they had high self-esteem. Even for people with low self- esteem, these downward social comparisons do improve their negative mood and allow them to feel hope and motivation for their future. Affect/mood and its effect on social comparison Individuals who have a negative mood improve their mood by making upward social comparisons, regardless of their level of self-esteem. In addition, both individuals with high self-esteem and low self-esteem who are in a positive mood elevate their mood further by making upward comparisons. However, for those who have recently experienced a threat to their self-esteem or a setback in their life, making upward social comparisons instead of downward social comparisons results in a more negative affect. Self-esteem and existence of a threat or setback in an individual's life are two moderators of their response to upward or downward comparisons. === Competitiveness === Because individuals are driven upwards in the case of abilities, social comparisons can drive competition among peers.Chen, P. & Garcia, S. M. (manuscript) \\"Yin and Yang Theory of Competition: Social Comparison and Evaluation Apprehension Reciprocally Drive Competitive Motivation\\". link. In this regard, the psychological significance of a comparison depends on the social status of an individual, and the context in which their abilities are being evaluated.  Social status  Competitiveness resulting from social comparisons may be greater in relation to higher social status because individuals with more status have more to lose. In one study, students in a classroom were presented with a bonus point program where, based on chance, the grades for some students would increase and the grades for others would remain the same. Despite the fact that students could not lose by this program, higher-status individuals were more likely to object to the program, and more likely to report a perceived distributive injustice. It was suggested that this was a cognitive manifestation of an aversion to downward mobility, which has more psychological significance when an individual has more status.  Proximity to a standard  When individuals are evaluated where meaningful standards exist, such as in an academic classroom where students are ranked, then competitiveness increases as proximity to a standard of performance increases. When the only meaningful standard is the top, then high-ranking individuals are most competitive with their peers, and individuals at low and intermediate ranks are equally competitive. However, when both high and low rankings hold significance, then individuals at high and low ranks are equally competitive, and are both more competitive than individuals at intermediate ranks. === Models of social comparison === Several models have been introduced to social comparison, including the self-evaluation maintenance model (SEM), proxy model, the triadic model and the three-selves model.Blanton, H. (2001). Evaluating the self in the context of another: The three-selves model of social comparison assimilation and contrast. In Cognitive social psychology: The Princeton symposium on the legacy and future of social cognition (pp. 75-87). Mahwah, NJ: Erlbaum.  Self-evaluation maintenance model  The SEM model proposes that we make comparisons to maintain or enhance our self- evaluations, focusing on the antagonistic processes of comparison and reflection. Abraham Tesser has conducted research on self-evaluation dynamics that has taken several forms. A self-evaluation maintenance (SEM) model of social behavior focuses on the consequences of another person's outstanding performance on one's own self-evaluation. It sketches out some conditions under which the other's good performance bolsters self-evaluation, i.e., \\"basking in reflected glory\\", and conditions under which it threatens self- evaluation through a comparison process.Tesser, A., Social Psychology Network; http://tesser.socialpsychology.org/  Proxy model  The proxy model anticipates the success of something that is unfamiliar. The model proposes that if a person is successful or familiar with a task, then he or she would also be successful at a new similar task. The proxy is evaluated based on ability and is concerned with the question \\"Can I do X?\\" A proxy's comparison is based previous attributes. The opinion of the comparer and whether the proxy exerted maximum effort on a preliminary task are variables influencing his or her opinion.  Triadic model  The Triadic Model builds on the attribution elements of social comparison, proposing that opinions of social comparison are best considered in terms of 3 different evaluative questions: preference assessment (i.e., \\"Do I like X?\\"), belief assessment (i.e., \\"Is X correct?\\"), and preference prediction (i.e., \\"Will I like X?\\"). In the Triadic Model the most meaningful comparisons are with a person who has already experienced a proxy and exhibits consistency in related attributes or past preferences.  Three-selves model  The three-selves model proposes that social comparison theory is a combination of two different theories. One theory is developed around motivation and the factors that influence the type of social comparison information people seek from their environment and the second is about self-evaluation and the factors that influence the effects of social comparisons on the judgments of self. While there has been much research in the area of comparison motives, there has been little in the area of comparative evaluation. Explaining that the self is conceived as interrelated conceptions accessible depending upon current judgment context and taking a cue from Social Cognitive Theory, this model examines the Assimilation effect and distinguishes three classes of working Self-concept ideas: individual selves, possible selves and collective selves. == Media influence == The media has been found to play a large role in social comparisons. Researchers examining the social effects of the media have used social comparison theory have found that in most cases women tend to engage in upward social comparisons with a target other, which results in more negative feelings about the self. The majority of women have a daily opportunity to make upward comparison by measuring themselves against some form of societal ideal. Social comparisons have become a relevant mechanism for learning about the appearance-related social expectations among peers and for evaluating the self in terms of those standards\\" (Jones, 2001, P. 647). Although men do make upward comparisons, research finds that more women make upward comparisons and are comparing themselves with unrealistically high standards presented in the media. As women are shown more mainstream media images of powerful, successful and thin women, they perceive the \\"ideal\\" to be the norm for societal views of attractive. In recent years, social media platforms such as Facebook and Instagram have made this more widespread, since social media makes it easier to compare yourself to the \\"ideal\\". Some women have reported making upward comparisons in a positive manner for the purposes of self-motivation, but the majority of upward comparisons are made when the individual is feeling lesser and therefore evoke a negative connotation. Self-perceived similarities with role models on social media can also affect self-esteem for both men and women. Having more self-perceived similarities with a role model can help increase self-esteem, while having less can decrease self-esteem.Social comparison with peers on social media can also lead to feelings of self-pity or satisfaction. The desire for social comparison can cause FoMO and compulsive checking of social media sites. == Criticisms == Many criticisms arose regarding Festinger's similarity hypothesis. Deutsch and KraussDeutsch, M., & Krauss, R. M. (1965). Theories in social psychology (Vol. 2). New York: Basic Books. argued that people actually seek out dissimilar others in their comparisons maintaining that this is important for providing valuable self- knowledge, as demonstrated in research.Mettee, D. R., & Smith, G. (1977). Social comparison and interpersonal attraction: The case for dissimilarity. Social comparison processes: Theoretical and empirical perspectives, 69, 101. Ambiguity also circulated about the important dimensions for similarity. Goethals and Darley clarified the role of similarity suggesting that people prefer to compare those who are similar on related attributes such as opinions, characteristics or abilities to increase confidence for value judgments, however those dissimilar in related attributes are preferred when validating one's beliefs. ==See also== * Frog pond effect ==ReferencesFurther reading== * Miller, K.

Beltway 8, a state highway, runs mostly along the frontage roads of the tollway, only using the main lanes where they are free between Interstate 45 (I-45, North Freeway) and Interstate 69/US Highway 59 (I-69/US 59, Eastex Freeway). The main lanes elsewhere are the Sam Houston Tollway, a toll road owned and operated by the Harris County Toll Road Authority (HCTRA). East of Houston, the tollway crosses the Houston Ship Channel on the Sam Houston Ship Channel Bridge, a toll bridge; this forms a gap in Beltway 8 between I-10 (Baytown-East Freeway) and State Highway 225 (SH 225, La Porte Freeway). Beltway 8 is the intermediate beltway in the Houston area. The inner beltway—I-610—lies mostly within Houston (except for an approximate stretch that runs through the City of Bellaire), and the outer beltway—SH 99 (Grand Parkway)—is currently open to traffic, with other various segments under construction, or planning. Like other toll roads in the Houston area, the speed limit is . ==Previous designation== 50px A previous route, called Loop 8, was designated on September 25, 1939, in Beaumont from US 59 (US 96 after the 1939 general redescription) at Gladys Street via Gulf Street, North Street, and Fourth Street to US 90 as a renumbering of SH 8 Loop. This was cancelled on January 18, 1944. The designation was created along the entire loop on May 7, 1969, but as Loop 8. On July 31, 1969, the designation was changed to Beltway 8. On July 24, 1978, the section from I-10 to SH 225 on the east side of Houston was cancelled. ==Route descriptionFree sections=== The longest free section of main lanes is on the north side of Houston, stretching from Ella Boulevard east to Mesa Drive. This is maintained by the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) east of roughly the Hardy Toll Road interchange. This particular free section has remained untolled since its 1969 opening because of accessibility to George Bush Intercontinental Airport. It includes the interchanges with I-69/US 59 (Eastex Freeway), John F. Kennedy Boulevard, the Hardy Toll Road, and I-45 (North Freeway). Three shorter free sections also exist: *North of Wallisville Road to Jacinto Port Boulevard, including the I-10 (Baytown-East Freeway) interchange. *SH 3 (Galveston Road) to Beamer Road, including the I-45 (Gulf Freeway) interchange. *West Airport Boulevard to Beechnut Street, including the I-69/US 59 (Southwest Freeway) interchange. These all exist in order to allow federal funding to have been used to build the freeway-to-freeway interchanges at the Baytown-East, Gulf and Southwest Freeways. The frontage roads are generally continuous, and allow for slower free travel along the tolled segments. Only one break exists in the frontage roads; there are also several locations where one must turn to stay on them: *Jacinto Port Boulevard to SH 225—the frontage roads do not cross the Houston Ship Channel (and thus that piece of Beltway 8 was removed in 1978). *Deerwood Drive to Boheme Drive—both directions are on the east side of the tollway for the crossing of Buffalo Bayou. *West Little York Road to US 290 (Northwest Freeway)—both directions shift to the west side, intersecting US 290 at Senate Avenue, northwest of the tollway. The west side shift was eliminated in late 2013 where the frontage road right of way was extended to US 290 as part of the US 290 widening project—the former lanes which shifted to the west side was re-routed to the new frontage roads with a signalized crossing. *At the Katy Freeway, some of the frontage road lanes bypass the intersection, allowing vehicles on the frontage road to travel through the interchange without stopping at traffic lights. The bypass was incorporated into the Katy Freeway reconstruction project to relieve congestion and elevated since a majority of the intersection is below grade level which had a past history of flooding during heavy rains. Note: Bypass feeder lanes are in dark purple; non-bypass feeder lanes are in dark blue and are beneath the bypass lanes. *A section of the frontage road at Mykawa Road shared the right- of-way with the tollway from 1997 to 2016 (which merged into a single lane); with the widening of the tolled lanes between SH 288 and I-45, TxDOT constructed two flyover ramps (completed July 2016) which goes over a railroad right of way with two lanes per direction (this was originally planned back in 1997 until the widening project from the Southwest Freeway to I-10 east revived it). Back in 1997 when the southern portion of the tollway opened up motorists were forced to make a turn onto Mykawa Road and head south to Knapp Road in Pearland where it had an at-grade railroad crossing (the City of Pearland removed the access to the railroad crossing where a section of McHard Road during the mid-2000s a few miles south incorporated a flyover bridge over the existing railroad right-of-way). ===Lane configuration=== The lane count is for mainlanes only, unless otherwise noted. Starting at the north end of the Sam Houston Ship Channel Bridge, and moving in a clockwise direction, mainlane counts are as follows: * Two lanes each way between I-10 (East Freeway) and SH 3 (Galveston Road) (includes the Sam Houston Ship Channel Bridge); * Three lanes each way between SH 3 (Galveston Road) and Beamer Road; * Four lanes each way between Beamer Road and SH 288 (South Freeway) * Four lanes each way between SH 288 (South Freeway) and I-69/US 59 (Southwest Freeway); * Four lanes each way between I-69/US 59 (Southwest Freeway) and US 290 (portions between I-69/US 59 and Westpark Tollway); * Four lanes each way between US 290 and West Road; * Five lanes counterclockwise and four lanes clockwise between West Road and Gessner Road; * Four lanes each way between Gessner Road and I-45; * Three lanes each way between I-45 and JFK Boulevard (construction started in 2012 to add additional lanes to this section); * Four lanes each way between JFK Boulevard and I-69/US 59 (Eastex Freeway); and * Three lanes each way between I-69/US 59 (Eastex Freeway) and I-10 (East Freeway). ==TollsEnforcement=== Chinatown Sign indicating proximity to the Beltway 8 Toll Bridge A number of cameras are located at toll booths to record license plate information to a database and send a ticket via mail. Recently, this system has been upgraded to alert local authorities if a vehicle has been flagged for any reason, including AMBER Alerts. When a flagged vehicle is detected, it notifies the closest law enforcement officer to investigate. At this time, Precinct 5 Constables and Harris County Sheriff's Office are being notified, but Houston Police Department has shown interest and wishes to be included to be notified. The total number of cameras that are planned for the system is 35. ==History== Houston, known for its fast population growth, began planning for a second beltway in the 1950s (the first was the I-610 loop, created between the 1950s and the 1970s). The tollway's construction was done in a piecemeal fashion from the opening of the West Belt Drive and Roark Road, two surface streets, in the mid-1970s to the completion of the South Belt in the mid-1990s. The Jesse H. Jones Memorial Bridge, the tollway's crossing of the Houston Ship Channel, was constructed by the then- Texas Turnpike Authority (TTA) and was opened in 1982. The TTA, however, turned down the opportunity to improve the entire beltway as well, leaving Harris County to upgrade the road to freeway standards. However, Harris County could not afford to build and maintain a freeway from its general fund. In September 1983, county voters approved a referendum by a 7–3 margin to release up to $900 million in bonds to create two toll roads, the Hardy Toll Road (basically a reliever for I-45 between downtown Houston and Montgomery County) and the Sam Houston Tollway, which would be the main lanes of the Beltway. Shortly after the referendum, the Harris County Commissioners Court created the HCTRA to administer the construction and operation of the new road system. Then-County Judge Jon Lindsay is generally credited with shepherding the referendum from its infancy to its passage, along with the implementation of the plan for the roadway. During the public information campaign leading up to the referendum, the county government published brochures stating that the toll roads would become free once their construction costs had been recouped, but the tolls were not removed after the tollways were paid off. In 1989, The Bangles performed at the opening of the segment of Beltway 8 between I-10 (Katy Freeway) and US 290. On July 7, 1990, a ceremony, called Road Party II, took place for the opening of the section of Beltway 8 between I-45 (North Freeway) and US 290, the final segment. Organizers had planned for a crowd of 100,000. KLOL, a radio station, sponsored the event. Jerry Lightfoot & The Essential Band did the opening 80-minute set. The band Huey Lewis and the News performed at the ceremony. The US 290-to-I-45 segment opened on July 8, 1990. The project was on schedule and $133 million (equivalent to $ in ) under budget. Despite recent speculation about the possibility of the Sam Houston Tollway being sold by HCTRA to a private firm, the Harris County Commissioners Court unanimously voted to keep the tollway in the hands of HCTRA. On September 3, 2007, the toll increased by $0.25 system wide with some exceptions. On February 26, 2011, construction of the main lanes between I-69/US 59 (Eastex Freeway) and US 90 (Crosby Freeway) was completed, thus completing the entire beltway system. This section was originally set to be completed between 2007 and 2009, but funding issues delayed its completion. The project cost $400 million (equivalent to $ in ) and was completed ahead of schedule and under budget. The new section has three lanes in each direction, and an EZ Tag, TxTag or TollTag will be required to access it. Almost 60 years had passed between the planning of Beltway 8 and the opening of the final section. On August 28, 2017, Hurricane Harvey caused flooding to the West Belt and caused damage near I-10. ==Exit listSee also== * * ==References * *Harris County Toll Road Authority Category:Transportation in Harris County, Texas Category:Freeways in Houston 008 008 Category:Beltways in the United States ","title":"Texas State Highway Beltway 8"},{"id":"2212711","text":"Quincy Railroad may refer to: *Quincy Railroad (California) *Quincy Railway or Granite Railway, a railway in Massachusetts ==See also== *Quincy Railroad Bridge, a bridge over the Mississippi River ","title":"Quincy Railroad"},{"id":"2212712","text":"Jack Brooks may refer to: *Jack Brooks (cricketer) (born 1984), English cricketer *Jack Brooks (footballer) (1904–1973), English footballer *Jack Brooks (lyricist) (1912–1971), British-American lyricist *Jack Brooks (American politician) (1922–2012), American Representative present at the John F.

The photos were posted on a popular Korean website and widely distributed; the woman was later identified, and her personal information was published online. The woman was publicly shamed, and quit her university. Newspaper editorials then addressed the issues concerning Internet vigilantism and privacy concerns. == Incident == In early June 2005, the woman, who appears to be in her 20s, took her lap dog on Seoul Subway Line 2. Her dog defecated on the floor of the subway car and, when other riders requested that she clean up after it, she declined to do so. Another subway rider offered the woman a tissue, which she used to clean the dog but not its waste. Other passengers suggested she clean up the mess, she ignored the second group of requests and departed the subway at the next stop. Another female commuter, using a camera phone, took several photographs of the woman and dog and posted them on a popular Korean website. == Reaction == Soon after the unaltered photos were published, Internet vigilante groups closely examined the picture and within days she had been identified and her personal data released on the Internet. The photo quickly became one of the most popular image searches on popular Korean web portals and a source of parody and derisive satire. The woman quit her university in shame and published a photo of her dog with a public apology. == Criticism == The reaction by Korean Internet users to the incident prompted several Korean newspapers to run editorials voicing concern over Internet vigilantism, suggesting that the effect of worldwide crowds do not result in wise, uniform judgments and appropriate punishments via social stigma. Concerns regarding the implications for personal privacy were raised. Some said that posting the woman's picture was acceptable, but that posting her personal information was inappropriate. Others said that her face should have been obscured in the widely circulated picture, in order to protect her identity. According to Daniel J.

Note: In World War I, the name used in the UK for Government-owned explosives factories was National Explosives Factory; and the Cordite factory at Gretna was known as HM Factory, Gretna. These Second World War factories were built for the Ministry of Supply with the Ministry of Works, in all cases except ROF Irvine, acting as agent. Explosive ROF's specialised in producing either high- explosives, such as TNT (trinitrotoluene) or RDX; or propellants, such as cordite, but there were minor exceptions to this demarcation. The products from these Explosive ROFs were shipped to Filling Factories for filling into munitions. Pyrotechnics, such as fuzes and screening smokes, tended to be made at the Filling Factories and filled directly into munitions. ==Comparable WW II factories not part of the ROF organisationICI and Ministry of Supply Agency Factories=== A number of UK World War II explosives factories were built and owned by ICI. These privately owned explosives factories were not considered part of the ROF Organisation and they were not called ROFs. ICI also managed numerous munitions factories constructed with Ministry of Supply funding; these were known as Agency Factories. ICI Nobel's Ardeer site and its World War II agency factories produced, for example, 35% of the combined ROF and Agency Factories output of Cordite and 15% of the combined output of TNT.Reader, Volume II, Chapter 15: War Production. ===Royal Naval Factories=== In both World War I and World War II the Royal Navy had its own government- owned factories producing propellants and explosives, for naval guns. These were the Royal Navy Cordite Factory, Holton Heath (RNCF), Dorset (World War I & World War II), and the Royal Navy Propellant Factory, Caerwent (RNPF), Monmouthshire (World War II only), respectively.

Camillo Rondani ==BiographyEarly years=== When Camillo Róndani was born in Parma the city was part of the French Empire Napoleon having crowned himself King of Italy. The Róndani family were wealthy landowners and of \\"rich and of ancient origins\\" with ecclesiastical connections preliminary and Camillo's early education was in a seminary. He then passed into the public school system where, encouraged by Macedonio Melloni his physics and chemistry teacher in the preparatory course for the University of Parma, he did not attend the law lessons his family had insisted on. He attended mineralogy classes given by a Franciscan priest, Father Bagatta and was taught natural history, a complementary course to botany for Medicine and Pharmacy. The Reader of Botany to the Athenaeum Parmesan was Professori Giorgio Jan, assistant at the Imperial Museum in Vienna and holder of the chair of zoology in Parma University. From Jan Róndani received many gifts to his collection: Coleoptera and a herbarium. Through Jan Róndani gained access to the house of the Conte Stefano Sanvitale, where an entomological club had access to the insect collection of Pietro Rossi. ===Law, politics and commerce=== Róndani qualified as a lawyer in 1831. A plan to study zoology at the University of Paris, a condition of his proposed appointment as Professor of Natural Science in Parma came to nothing as Italy was thrown into political turmoil, the University urging its students to die for the unity of Italy, a resurgent demand of Giuseppe Garibaldi. Following the Ducal restoration after three years of provisional government not only was the chair of Zoology a distant dream, but the legal faculty had been removed to Piacenza in order to diminish the number of politically active students. Camillo and his brother Emilio, who had been imprisoned by the temporary government, turned to colonial commerce. Róndani studied the insects of the exotic products describing two of the beetles he found Cis jalapa from chillies and Brucus dolici from Santa Domingo coffee. ===Marriage and Farming=== In 1833 Róndani married his first love, Petronilla, for whom he later named a new species of Ceria now Sphiximorpha petronillae. The couple ran a family farm on the pleasant hillsides of Guardasone. This was transformed with dams and scientific soil management systems, and he used it to study agronomy and, with Petronilla, poetry and the arts. It was at this time that his studies of Diptera began, possibly because of their agricultural significance. A few years later Petronilla died and Róndani threw himself into entomology, working especially on the biology of parasitic insects (Diptera and Hymenoptera). ===Years of entomology=== Although little of his entomological work was published by Róndani himself, it raised him to preeminence. In 1840, he became a member of the Academy of France, published his first paper, and corresponded with Félix Édouard Guérin-Méneville on insects of Sicilian amber. Further publications rapidly followed on species new to Italy, new to science, plans of classifications, taxonomic arguments, and initial work on his masterwork, the Prodomo, a treatise on Diptera. Many were (confusingly) printed locally at the printing office in Parma, but then, following amendments in the entomological journals Nuovi Annali di Scienze Naturali di Bologna, Magazin de Zoologie de M. J. Guérin Ménéville, and the Annales de la Société Entomologique de France. In the nationalistic wars of 1848 the Róndani's were recalled to Parma. Camillo was briefly elected to represent Traversetolo. Following the catastrophic defeat of the Piedmontese at the Battle of Novara, Róndani retired back to Guardasone, and for some years, as Italians became increasingly involved in colonial ambition, worked on exotic Diptera. In these years he began to collaborate with the Irish entomologist Alexander Henry Haliday with whom he was to co-found the Italian Entomological Society. ===Last years=== In 1855, when Luisa Maria of Borbone, sister of Maria Christina of Bourbon-Two Sicilies reopened the university of Parma, which had virtually closed its doors in 1849, Róndani became Professor of Agronomy. From this date the Prodromo began in earnest, as Róndani alternated teaching with research much of it in applied entomology. He also remarried this time to his cousin Elisa Gelati. Ten years Parma became part of the United Provinces of Central Italy, joining Tuscany, Modena and Piacenza). This led to changes in the university. The chair of agronomy was abolished and Róndani became emerito University professor of the University and insignito of the cross of the Saints Maurizio and Lazzaro. He became a natural history teacher in the R.? Grammar school and also Director of the Agrarian Institute where he taught agronomy. Róndani remained in both posts for the next ten years though the Institute passed to the Provincial Administration in 1865. Róndani also became a popular writer for several newspapers and had various assignments from government and from the Camera d'Agricoltura e Commercio [Agriculture and Commerce Chamber] and the Giunta Superiore di Statistica [Advanced Committee of Statistics] for which he was awarded a medal. He maintained his interest in politics to the last, being an influential member of the Consigli della Provincia e del Comune, unhesitatingly supporting liberal and progressive ideals. Come uomo fu moderatissimo nei desideri, semplice nel modo di vivere, costante negli affetti, irremovibile nei principii.. moderate, simple, constant, and principled Camillo Róndani died on September 17, 1879. Róndani's collection is in La Specola Museum, Florence, Italy.

United Nations  Kofi Annan  Secretary- General } ==Priorities== Traditionally, the host country of the G8 summit sets the agenda for negotiations, which take place primarily amongst multi- national civil servants in the weeks before the summit itself, leading to a joint declaration which all countries can agree to sign. ==Issues== The summit was intended as a venue for resolving differences among its members. As a practical matter, the summit was also conceived as an opportunity for its members to give each other mutual encouragement in the face of difficult economic decisions. ==Citizens' responses and authorities' counter-responses Protests === The protests against the 2004 meeting of the G8 Summit in Sea Island, Georgia, took place over the course of several days in the cities of Brunswick and Savannah, Georgia. Local police coordinated with the Georgia Army and Air National Guard, Georgia State Troopers, and agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, and the Secret Service, as well as officers from the Georgia Department of Natural Resources and others who arrived to control crowds and prevent terrorist attacks. Military vehicles (HUMVEEs) and Georgia State Patrol vehicles roamed the city streets and in Savannah and Brunswick near the bridge to the Island daily. The National Guard soldiers also patrolled on foot, searching for weapons and explosives and watching for known \\"domestic terrorist\\" groups and the so-called black bloc protesters. The protests began in Savannah on June 8 with an anti-G8 march. However, about one third of those who marched were undercover agents from the FBI. Much of the planned \\"black bloc\\" protests in Savannah were thwarted when the leader of one \\"domestic terrorist\\" group was arrested in Savannah for possession of marijuana. Also, National Guard soldiers found several stockpiles of materials that the protest groups intended to use in a \\"sleeping dragon\\" maneuvers as well as bats with nails driven through them and piles of rocks and bricks. Then several protesters wearing all black clothing were confronted by National Guard soldiers in riot gear and then arrested by police after they congregated in front of the Starbucks and The Gap stores and began shouting antiglobalization slogans. At least three explosives were found by National Guard soldiers, though none of them turned out to be very big. One \\"dummy bomb\\" was found in a trashcan near a hotel where some members of the media were staying. It consisted of a shoe box with an alarm clock, newspapers and dead leaves. On the last day of the Summit, three protesters showed up on River Street, dressed as the Statue of Liberty, but they walked through the street quickly shouting anti-Bush slogans and then left. In Brunswick, the protests began with an antiwar march on June 8, and a vigil was held on the night of June 9, which attracted about 300 people and the Fair World Fair. The following day, a group of around 100 protesters began congregating near the gates of a chemical plant, until they were directed by security to leave by. The last and most eventful action, the March for a Free Palestine, took place in Brunswick. Several activists made a replica of part of the wall being built between Israel and Palestine, and burnt it to the ground. A breakaway group decided to cross the bridge and head to Sea Island where the G8 meetings were wrapping up. However, the bridge is about 1.5 miles long, and the temperature was in the low 90s with the humidity being above 70 percent. Thus, after crossing the bridge, many of the protesters were overheated, and all were in need of water. They were given bottles of cold water by the National Guard troops who were waiting for them at the end of the bridge. Then the protesters voluntarily loaded onto air- conditioned buses and were taken back to the Brunswick side of the bridge. A few protesters wanted to continue their march, but they were blocked from entering Sea Island by a security fence and the same National Guard troops who were handing out water. So they sat down in front of the gate for about 20 minutes until the police ordered them to leave. A few were arrested, but most voluntarily loaded onto the buses and went back to Brunswick. The protests were considerably smaller than past G8 Summits, owing in large part to the overwhelming military and police presence. The extent of the military and police presence was somewhat controversial as it led some to believe that martial law had been declared. However, then-Georgia governor Sonny Perdue was unapologetic about his decision to mobilize the security forces. === Security === The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) designated the summit a National Special Security Event (NSSE), because of the protests and so many heads of state of government attending. However, DHS started to handle another NSSE at the same time: the state funeral of former president Ronald Reagan. ==State funeral of Ronald Reagan== The G-8 Summit began three days after former U.S. president Ronald Reagan died. President George W. Bush was at the summit at the same time that Reagan's casket was brought to the Capitol to lie in state, which was on the second day of the summit (June 9). Taking his place at the ceremony at the Capitol was Vice-President Richard Cheney. Some of the world leaders who attended the summit decided to extend their stay in the U.S. to attend the funeral in Washington. One of them was German Chancellor Gerhard Schröder. Joining him in doing so were British Prime Minister Tony Blair and Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. Schröder said about extending his stay: \\"It is appropriate that the German chancellor says, 'Thank you,' and that is what I'm doing.\\" Those that did not extend their stay, like Canadian Prime Minister Paul Martin, French President Jacques Chirac, and Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern, also president of the European Union, paid tribute at the summit. The funeral took place the day after the summit ended. Martin cited the ongoing election campaign as the reason for not extending his stay in the U.S. Ahern's tribute had special significance, as he paid tribute to Reagan's Irish roots, recalling his visit to Ireland in 1984. For Afghan Interim President Hamid Karzai, the summit was part of his week-long visit to the U.S. He scrapped a visit to the West Coast to visit the Afghan community and went to Washington instead, beginning his visit there by attending the funeral. ==Business opportunity== For some, the G8 summit became a profit- generating event; as for example, the official G8 Summit magazines which have been published under the auspices of the host nations for distribution to all attendees since 1998. Prestige Media: \\"official\\" G8 Summit magazine The summit planning committee contracted with a Georgia-based wireless communication provider for 450 handsets and service to be used during the run up to the international event. In order to ensure reliable coverage in the coastal area around Sea Island, the company increased coverage and system capacity in advance of the summit. The handsets were deployed to coordinate operations, logistics, transportation, and other critical aspects of the preparations for the summit. \\"G8 Summit Relies on Southern LINC for Communications,\\" Business Wire.

His career was erratic, partly because of his difficult personality, and the majority of his large projects were left incomplete, or subsequently destroyed. Much of what survives is in the form of drawings, many using \\"a schematic, pale colouring as a timid and humble accessory to the dominating figure-drawing\\", that were planned for large fresco commissions that never materialized.Novotny, 51-54, 52 quoted ==Biography== He was born in Sanct Jürgen near Schleswig to a miller. He had a youthful passion for painting, but was apprenticed to a cooper (barrel-maker) for five years. After quitting his master in 1776, he went to Copenhagen, where he studied at the academy and supported himself for seven years by drawing portraits in red chalk, producing during the time a large historical picture, the \\"Death of Æschylus\\", and another painting, \\"Æolus and Ulysses\\". In 1783 he went to Italy where he was much impressed by the work of Giulio Romano. His means did not permit him to go beyond Milan and Mantua, where he remained a month and then went to Lübeck, where he lived five years painting portraits. He was then introduced by the poet Overbeck to a wealthy patron, by whose aid he went to Berlin, where his \\"Fall of the Angels\\", a colossal picture containing over 200 figures, gained him a professorship in the academy of fine arts. Two years' labour in Berlin and a travelling pension enabled him in 1792 to go to Rome, and study the works of Michelangelo and Raphael. At the end of this time he made a strongly worded attack on the Prussian academy and was dismissed; he was based in Rome for the brief remainder of his life, where he developed his final style.Novotny, 51 He gradually produced some fine subject and historical paintings, e.g. \\"Plato's Symposium\\" and the \\"Battle of Rossbach\\" which made him famous. He was appointed professor at Berlin, and in 1795 a great exhibition of his works was held in Rome in the studio of Pompeo Batoni; he died in Rome in 1798. He mostly designed in pencil or chalk and watercolour and painted paintings in fresco; he rarely painted in oil.

Hamilton, published in 1993. It is the first book in the Greg Mandel trilogy. The novel introduces the major characters in the series, most notably Greg and Julia Evans. The novel combines elements of classic detective novels with science fiction. ==Plot summary== The focus of the novel is the growth of the company Event Horizon, founded by Julia's grandfather Philip Evans. Beset by industrial saboteurs, the company seeks help in the form of ex–Mindstar Brigade soldier turned private detective Greg Mandel. The company is leading the way in rebuilding a twenty-first-century England after the People's Socialist Party (PSP), a tyrannical communist government, had first crushed the country and then collapsed, leaving it in shambles. Initially hired to solve a mystery involving missing stocks from a zero-g satellite production facility, he is then re-hired to find the source of attacks on a stored personality of Philip Evans after the industrialist's death. ==The Event Horizon trilogy== Greg Mandel is the lead character in Mindstar Rising, plus two subsequent novels and a novella by Peter F. Hamilton. All the stories feature Mandel, Julia Evans and the company Event Horizon. The stories are set in a near-future England, centred on Hamilton's own home county of Rutland. Mandel is a former officer of the \\"English Army\\", who fought in the \\"Mindstar Brigade\\", a tactical psychic unit. He was given the psychic powers of intuition and detecting emotions, skills he uses for his new profession of psychic detective. The stories are set in a Britain recovering from the damages suffered during ten years of \\"Marxist-Maoist\\" dictatorship under the People's Socialist Party and also the ravages of global warming and collapsing financial markets. After three highly successful novels featuring Mandel had launched his career, Hamilton only briefly returned to him for the novella The Suspect Genome. The Suspect Genome was published in Interzone in 2000 and was winner of the British Science Fiction Association Award for best short in 2001. Apart from this, Hamilton otherwise moved on to writing quite different books. The author said in 1996, that \\"Greg was a very good start for me and people have enjoyed it and I think: \\"leave it at that\\". ==Release details== * Hamilton, Peter F. Mindstar Rising.

Several species are named after him based on his specimens. == Biography == Dr. phil. h.c. Otmar Reiser (1861-1936) Reiser was born in Vienna, son of a well known lawyer, Otmar Reiser sr. whose namesake father was a well-known mayor of Maribor. He studied at the local gymnasium, at Novo Mesto (matriculating in 1882) and then joined as a reserve lieutenant in the 47th Infantry Regiment. He then went to the College of Agriculture in Vienna (graduating in 1887). He was involved in founding the National Museum of Bosnia and Herzegovina in Sarajevo and then joined its department of Natural History and worked there until retirement in 1919. He worked at the ornithological observatory at Ljubljana and studied Balkan birds. He also studied the birds of Sarajevo and contributed specimens to the Maribor Museum. He received a honorary doctorate from the University of Graz in 1932. His collections of eggs and bird skins were donated to the museum in Sarajevo. Reiser exhibited his collections at the 1891 International Ornithological Congress in Budapest, at the Millenium Exhibition, Budapest and at the international hunting exhibition in Vienna (1910). He took part in expeditions to Montenegro, Bulgaria, Greece, Brazil, and Serbia. He also collected plants and was in charge of the herbarium after the death of the botanist Franz Fiala. In 1903 he took part in an expedition of the Austrian Academy of Sciences to north-east Brazil, during which he was the first to observe the Spix's macaw in the wild since its original discovery 84 years earlier. == Works == *Bericht über die Besichtigungen des Spix-Aras bei Paranaguá in Piauí während der Expedition der K.u.K Akademie der Wissenschaften im Jahre 1903 *Die VogelSammlung des bosnischhercegowin Landesmuseums in Sarajevo, Budapest (1891) *Bericht über die botanische Ergebnisse meiner naturwissenschaftlichen Sammelreisen in Serbien in den Jahren 1899 u. 1900 (1905) *Materialen zu einer Ornis Balcanica Annalen des Naturhistorischen Museums in Wien (1939) *Die Vögel von Marburg an der Drau.

While the N-process conserves total phonon momentum, the U-process changes phonon momentum. Figure 2.: k-vectors exceeding the first Brillouin zone (red) do not carry more information than their counterparts (black) in the first Brillouin zone. In crystalline materials, Umklapp scattering (also U-process or Umklapp process) is a scattering process that results in a wave vector (usually written k) which falls outside the first Brillouin zone. If a material is periodic, it has a Brillouin zone, and any point outside the first Brillouin zone can also be expressed as a point inside the zone. So, the wave vector is then mathematically transformed to a point inside the first Brillouin zone. This transformation allows for scattering processes which would otherwise violate the conservation of momentum: two wave vectors pointing to the right can combine to create a wave vector that points to the left. This non- conservation is why crystal momentum is not a true momentum. Examples include electron-lattice potential scattering or an anharmonic phonon-phonon (or electron-phonon) scattering process, reflecting an electronic state or creating a phonon with a momentum k-vector outside the first Brillouin zone. Umklapp scattering is one process limiting the thermal conductivity in crystalline materials, the others being phonon scattering on crystal defects and at the surface of the sample. Figure 1 schematically shows the possible scattering processes of two incoming phonons with wave-vectors (k-vectors) k1 and k2 (red) creating one outgoing phonon with a wave vector k3 (blue). As long as the sum of k1 and k2 stay inside the first Brillouin zone (grey squares), k3 is the sum of the former two, thus conserving phonon momentum. This process is called normal scattering (N-process). With increasing phonon momentum and thus larger wave vectors k1 and k2, their sum might point outside the first Brillouin zone (k'3). As shown in Figure 2, k-vectors outside the first Brillouin zone are physically equivalent to vectors inside it and can be mathematically transformed into each other by the addition of a reciprocal lattice vector G. These processes are called Umklapp scattering and change the total phonon momentum. Umklapp scattering is the dominant process for electrical resistivity at low temperatures for low defect crystalsNiel W. Ashcroft and N. David Mermin, (1976) \\"Solid State Physics\\", Holt Rinehart and Winston, New York. See pages 523-526 for a discussion of resistivity at high temperatures, and pages 526-528 for the contribution of Umklapp to resistivity at low temperatures. (as opposed to phonon-electron scattering, which dominates at high temperatures, and high-defect lattices which lead to scattering at any temperature.) Umklapp scattering is the dominant process for thermal resistivity at high temperatures for low defect crystals. The thermal conductivity for an insulating crystal where the U-processes are dominant has 1/T dependence. The name derives from the German word umklappen (to turn over). Rudolf Peierls, in his autobiography Bird of Passage states he was the originator of this phrase and coined it during his 1929 crystal lattice studies under the tutelage of Wolfgang Pauli. Peierls wrote, \\"…I used the German term Umklapp (flip-over) and this rather ugly word has remained in use….\\" ==See also== * Sampling theorem ==References== Category:Scattering ","title":"Umklapp scattering"},{"id":"2212820","text":"The term United States domestic market (USDM) is an unofficial term used chiefly by automotive enthusiasts to describe the United States' economic market for American-brand automobiles and parts.

He was also a well- known tea and coffee merchant and a general business entrepreneur. A fervent Christian,Ehland, Christopher. Thinking northern: textures of identity in the north of England (Rodopi, 2007) p144. he campaigned throughout his life for the temperance movement in Britain, for the reduction of taxes on publishing, and was a social reformer who recognised the importance of education in improving the life of the working class, and whose many publications, both magazines and books, brought learning and culture to the masses. ==Life and workEarly years=== John Cassell was born on 23 January 1817 in Manchester, then in Lancashire; the son of Mark Cassell, landlord of a public house called \\"The Ring O' Bells\\" at 8 The Old Churchyard, Hunt's Bank, Manchester. The family enjoyed a reasonable standard of living for the first 10 years until his father was disabled by a fall, dying 3 years later. The burden of providing for the family fell on his mother who made a living through upholstery work, though this left her with little time for her son. John received little education as a result and, from an early age, was required to work as a factory hand, manufacturing \\"tape\\" and velveteen. Cassell detested the work, which was both confining and monotonous, and felt oppressed by the appalling social conditions around him. Seeking better prospects, he impressed a local carpenter with his woodworking skills and was offered an apprenticeship.Cassell & Co., 1922, pp. 4-5 ===Temperance movement=== Scene in a London Gin Palace (engraving from the \\"Working Man's friend and family instructor\\", 25 Oct 1851) In 1833, Cassell came under the influence of the temperance movement, and \\"signed the pledge\\" at a local meeting held by a Mr. Thomas Swindlehurst; he also witnessed the well-known temperance campaigner Joseph Livesey speak at the Oak Street Chapel in Manchester. At the time, alcoholism was a pressing social issue; tea and coffee were prohibitively expensive for the working classes, milk was seen as a luxury, and beer, by contrast, was relatively cheap and readily available. Cassell strongly identified with the ideals of the movement and, having first honoured his indentures of apprenticeship, decided to become a travelling temperance lecturer. Making good his lack of formal education, he had also sought self-improvement by teaching himself general knowledge, English literature and some French language.DNB.Cassell & Co., 1922, pp. 5-7 In 1836, having spent several months lecturing on teetotalism in the Manchester area, Cassell set off by foot for London, stopping on the way to speak about temperance to any audience that he could find, and supporting himself by doing carpentry odd-jobs. In October 1836, after 16 days of walking, he finally arrived in London with the princely sum of 3 pence in his pocket, unable even to afford lodgings for the night. That same evening, he spoke at a temperance meeting at the New Jerusalem Schoolroom near Westminster Bridge Road, and for the next 6 months was involved in temperance campaigning in the capital.Cassell & Co., 1922, pp. 7-9 In April 1837, Cassell was enrolled as a recognised agent of the \\"National Temperance Society\\", and toured around England and Wales, lecturing and taking total abstinence \\"pledges\\". In 1841, whilst on a temperance tour of the eastern counties, he met a Lincolnshire woman, Mary Abbott, whom he married the same year. Mary inherited a sum of money from her father which enabled the couple to settle in St. John's Wood, London, and gave John the capital he needed to invest in a business. Their home became a meeting place for writers, artists and reformers - people such as George Cruikshank, William and Mary Howitt, and Ellen Wood.Cassell & Co., 1922, pp. 9-12. ===Publisher=== Tea, coffee and temperance tracts In 1843,Brake & Demoor, 2009. Cassell set himself up as a tea and coffee merchant in Coleman Street, City of London. The business was an immediate success, moving eventually to larger premises in 80 Fenchurch Street. His teas and coffees were extensively advertised in the press, and slogans such as \\"Buy Cassell's shilling coffee\\" made them quite a household word. He bought a second-hand printing press to produce advertising leaflets for his wares and this led him to writing and publishing his own temperance tracts.Cassell & Co., 1922, p13. Temperance periodicals and the \\"Working Man's Friend\\" Cassell went into partnership with his brother-in-law, and this allowed him to concentrate on editing and writing periodicals, the first of which, The Teetotal Times, appeared in 1846, becoming, in 1849, The Teetotal Times and Essayist a monthly, which continued for a few years afterwards. In July 1848, he started publication of Standard of Freedom, a weekly newspaper aimed at the popular market, whose principles were free-trade and freedom of religion. It only lasted until 1851, becoming incorporated into the Weekly News and Chronicle.Cassell & Co., 1922, pp. 13-15. In 1850, he started the Working Man's Friend, a weekly magazine aiming to educate its readers without patronising them or playing to the lowest common denominator, and sympathetic to the life of working-class people. Its readers sent in hundreds of letters and articles for publication, and the magazine drew praise from figures such as Richard Cobden, politician and social reformer, and the Earl of Carlisle. In 1851, in order to expand the business, Cassell purchased William Cathrell's printing plant in The Strand, London, bringing the printing of the Working Man's Friend in-house.Cassell & Co., 1922, pp. 15-16. Business expansion Bell Savage Inn In 1851, The Illustrated Exhibitor, a monthly periodical about The Great Exhibition, started publication, to great success, achieving sales of 100,000 by December. The expansion of the company meant a move to bigger premises at \\"La Belle Sauvage Yard\\" - previously the site of a centuries-old inn - on the north side of Ludgate Hill, in 1852.Cassell & Co., 1922, pp. 17-18. Around this time the Cassell's Library series started to appear; 26 volumes were eventually published including books on history, biography and science. In April 1852, the weekly Popular Educator started publication, achieving both popular success and critical acclaim - \\"a school, a library and a university\\" was how one commentator described it. The magazine inspired readers to continue their education in local classes, with Cassell offering practical and financial help where needed. It became something an institution, helping to improve the education, prospects and employment opportunities of the nation; even Lloyd George, future Prime Minister of Britain, credited the Popular Educator with bolstering his meagre childhood education and helping him to better himself. This was followed in 1852 with the Popular Biblical Educator, which hoped to do for religion what its predecessor had done for general knowledge.Cassell & Co., 1922, pp. 25-29. In 1853, the Illustrated Family Paper started publication, aiming to provide literary recreation for a family audience. It included not just educational articles but serialisations of novels as well. One of these, The Warp and the Weft, a tale about Lancashire mill workers by John Frederick Smith, appeared during the Lancashire Cotton Famine, and inspired readers of the paper to contribute a large sum to a relief fund for cotton workers. In 1867, after Cassell's death, the magazine was reduced in size and changed its name to Cassell's Magazine.Cassell & Co., 1922, pp. 29-30 & 114. Partnership with Petter & Galpin By the end of 1854, an unexpected call to repay credit advanced by his paper supplier forced Cassell to sell the copyright and stock for the Illustrated Family Paper, Popular Educator and other completed publications. This was only meant to be a temporary measure until the business found its feet again. Hence he found himself in semi-partnership with the printing firm \\"Petter & Galpin\\". During this interim period The Illustrated Family Bible a periodical in penny parts appeared and achieved popularity abroad as well as at home. In 1865 came the Illustrated History of England,Illustrated History of England (archive.org). in weekly and monthly parts, totalling 8 volumes and with around 2000 illustrations; more than a quarter of a million copies were sold of the first edition.Cassell & Co., 1922, pp. 31-34. Other periodicals included The Illustrated Magazine of Art (1853–54, later revived as The Magazine of Art to greater success some years after Cassell's death), The Freeholder (monthly magazine of the \\"free land\\" movement), and the religious magazines The Pathwayand The Quiver (first edition 7 September 1861). Cassell also conceived the idea of daily paper but this did not come to fruition until three years after his death; The Echo', as it was called, lasted only a few years from 1868-1875, when it was sold off, continuing, under various management, until 1905.Cassell & Co., 1922, pp. 120-124 & 147-153. Cassell visited the United States in 1853 to attend the World Temperance Convention in New York, and again in 1854 and 1859 on publishing business. He met the author Harriet Beecher Stowe and arranged for the publication of an illustrated edition of Uncle Tom's Cabin in Britain - to great success. Cassell strongly supported the cause of the slavery abolitionists.Cassell & Co., 1922, 45-46. In 1859, on his return from America, he went into full partnership with Petter & Galpin, the company becoming Cassell, Petter & Galpin. The company was particularly successful in its production of illustrated editions of classic literature such as Robinson Crusoe, Gulliver's travels, The Vicar of Wakefield and others. The great French artist Gustave Doré provided illustrations for Dante's Inferno (1861),Dante's inferno. Don Quixote,Don Quixote. and a special edition of the Holy Bible.Masterpieces from the works of Gustave Doré. The company's premises at La Belle Sauvage yard also gained the distinction of a visit from the French Emperor Napoleon III himself, as it was publishing the English edition of his book, The History of Julius Caesar.Napoleon III. History of Julius Caesar: Volume 1, Volume 2.Cassell & Co., 1922, 54-7. Cassell played an important part in lobbying government to reduce the burden of taxation on paper and periodical publications - the \\"tax on knowledge\\" as it was called - and his endeavours in the 1850s helped to repeal Newspaper Advertisement Duty, Newspaper Stamp Duty and Paper Duty (the latter in 1861).Cassell & Co., 1922, p43. ===Cazeline Oil=== On his return from America to London he started selling Cazeline Oil, for lighting, an early form of gasoline. ===Final years=== In his final years Cassell, seeing the business opportunities being opened up by the development of artificial light, set up an oil distillation works at Hanwell. Despite his efforts the venture came to nothing and, though no serious financial loss was sustained, the project was a great drain on his time and energy.Cassell & Co., 1922, pp. 56-57. Cassell died, aged only 48, of an internal tumour, on 2 April 1865 at his home at 25 Avenue Road, Regent's Park, London - the same day as his friend Richard Cobden - and was buried at Kensal Green Cemetery. He was survived by his widow Mary, who died in Brighton on 6 July 1885. He also left a daughter, Sophia (d. 1912). The company, Cassell, Petter & Galpin, which at the time of his death, employed 500 people, continued to prosper under the management of the remaining partners, Petter and Galpin.Cassell & Co., 1922, pp. 57-9. ==See also== *Cassell's Magazine *Cassell's National Library ==ReferencesBibliography== *The working man's friend, and family instructor (London: John Cassell): : Volumes 1.1 - 3.39 (5 Jan 1850 - 28 Sep 1850.) : Volumes 4.40 - 5.65 (5 Oct 1850 - 29 Mar 1851) : Volumes 6.46 - 7.91 (5 Apr 1851 - 27 Sep 1851) : Volumes 1.1 - 2.52 (4 Oct 1851 - 25 Sep 1852).

United Methodists, Presbyterians, Mennonites, African Methodist Episcopalians, and other Protestant church denominations are represented both on the Palmer faculty and in its student body. It was founded in 1925 as Eastern Baptist Theological Seminary. Its parent institution is Eastern University. Palmer Theological Seminary is located on the Eastern University campus at 1300 Eagle Road, St. Davids, PA. ==History== Twelve members of the Northern Baptist Convention founded Palmer Theological Seminary in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on March 19, 1925, intending to preserve their historic evangelical tradition as well as educate future ministers.http://www.palmerseminary.edu/about/history Originally located on Rittenhouse Square, it moved in 1940 to Wynnewood, Pennsylvania, just across the street from the city boundary. In 2012, the seminary moved from the Wynnewood campus to an interim location at the American Baptist Missions Center in nearby King of Prussia, Pennsylvania. In June 2016, the seminary moved to the main campus of Eastern University in St. Davids, Pennsylvania. The seminary originally established a collegiate division to prepare some students for the academic rigor of seminary-level courses. This evolved in 1952 into Eastern Baptist College, since 2002 Eastern University in St. Davids, Pennsylvania near Valley Forge and further west on the Philadelphia Main Line from Philadelphia. In 2004, Eastern Baptist Theological Seminary re-merged with Eastern University, now as a subsidiary. The following year, the seminary changed its name to Palmer Theological Seminary in honor of its longest serving president (1936–48), Gordon Palmer.http://www.abcopad.org/News/American-Baptist-Home-Mission-Societies- Foundation-Offer-Palmer-Grants-To-Churches-Organizations.aspx In 2010, the University also established the Smith School of Christian Ministries to oversee certain programs.http://www.palmerseminary.edu/about/history In 2012, the seminary sold this location and moved temporarily to the American Baptist Churches offices located nearby at 588 N. Gulph Road, King of Prussia, Pennsylvania, between 2015 and 2016, the seminary moved to the main campus of Eastern University. Over the years, the seminary has combined evangelical theology with the affirmation of women in ministry and commitment to social justice and ethnic diversity. From the beginning, the Seminary welcomed female students. The Seminary continues to affirm its founding motto, \\"The Whole Gospel for the Whole World.\\"http://www.palmerseminary.edu/offices-and- centers/registrar/catalog-information/history-and-relationships ==Academic programs== Masters Programs - The Master of Divinity (MDiv) degree is the standard post-graduate degree required by many Christian church denominations prior to pastoral ordination. The Master of Theological Studies (MTS) degree prepares students for further academic training (primarily the Ph.D.) and for non-pastoral vocations in areas such as public policy advocacy, Christian publishing, and social work. At Palmer, students may choose to pursue an MTS in General Studies or in one of the following areas of concentration: Biblical Studies, Contemporary Theology, Christian Faith and Public Policy, Christian Mission, Christian Heritage (History), and Christian Counseling. Doctor of Ministry - In 2009 the Seminary launched a Doctor of Ministry degree program focusing on leadership and church renewal. Eastern School of Christian Ministry - Palmer offers several diploma and certificate programs designed primarily to provide quality theological education for those who do not have an undergraduate college degree. ==Scholarships== In 2007, the Seminary began offering three scholarships covering half the cost of tuition at Palmer. As many as 10 openings are available each year for each of the three. The Brauch Scholarship is named for former Seminary president Manfred Brauch and his spouse, Marjean. The Sider Scholarship is named for professor Ron Sider, and the Wallis Scholarship honors Jim Wallis, the founder of the Washington, D.C.-based Sojourners community. ==Original campus and community== The former main building on the Palmer campus, located at 6 E Lancaster Ave in Wynnewood, Pennsylvania was once a resort hotel. The first floor of the building was renovated to accommodate staff offices and classrooms. The three upper floors serve as apartments or dorms for students and for some members of the Seminary's faculty and staff. Palmer's Laws Memorial Chapel building was constructed in the early 1950s with money donated by the late Marguerite Treat Doane. In addition to a sanctuary, the chapel features classrooms and faculty offices. In 2008, the countries represented by students living on campus included Canada, South Korea, India, South Africa, Australia, and China. ==Musical discoveries at the seminary== In July 2005, an 80-page Beethoven manuscript of a piano four hands version of the Grosse Fugue was discovered in the library archives by one of the librarians.\\"Beethoven manuscript, lost 115 years, is found\\", International Herald Tribune, October 13, 2005\\"Palmer Seminary discovers important Beethoven music manuscript\\", article at Eastern University web site The manuscript was authenticated by Jeffrey Kallberg at the University of Pennsylvania and by Stephen Roe, head of Sotheby's Manuscript Department. Lost from view for well over 100 years, it is thought by some to be one of the most important musicological finds in recent years. The event paralleled the earlier find on July 31, 1990, of a Mozart manuscript, which had been donated to the seminary in 1951 by Marguerite Treat Doane (daughter of noted hymnist William Howard Doane). It was rediscovered along with some lesser manuscripts of the same period. The Beethoven manuscript was auctioned by Sotheby's in London on December 1, 2005 for US$1.72 million to an anonymous bidder later revealed to be Bruce Kovner. ==Notable faculty and alumni== * Ron Sider, professor and founder of Evangelicals for Social Action * Craig Keener, professor and author of the bestselling IVP Bible Background Commentary (New Testament) * Samuel Escobar, retired professor and world-renowned missiologist * Barry Black, alumnus and United States Senate Chaplain * Charles E.

The organization promotes music that involves the creative use of computers and electronics mixed with acoustics. Today, NWEAMO has showcased artists in prime venues across the world. In a healthy cultural milieu NWEAMO celebrates both classical and popular music. The idea behind this seemingly controversial connection is that without any connection, both genres suffer. When classical music does not connect with popular culture, it becomes a music of experts, unable to reflect and contribute meaningfully in the broad marketplace of developing ideas and cultural experimentation. Popular music on the other hand, becomes naïve and superficial, untethered to its historical roots and broad cultural underpinnings, without connection and communication with classical music. NWEAMO attempts to generate a synthesis that reveals new possibilities for both. ==Festivals== Originally NWEAMO concerts featured a variety of electro-acoustic styles and genres, ranging from Intelligent dance music to the abstract avant garde. Eventually the word \\"Electronic\\" was replaced with \\"Evolving\\" in the acronym to reflect the inclusion of visual art, installation art, dance, sound art and acoustic music to the festival, and to allow future growth. In 2002 the festival added San Diego, California to its locations. In 2005 the festival expanded further, with an additional night added in Mexico City. New York City and Venice, Italy were added 2006. The 2007 festival included a summer component in Europe (Berlin, May 18–19; and Venice, May 25–26) in addition to the main autumn festival: San Diego (Oct 5 & 6, 2007); Boulder, Colorado (Oct. 13, 2007); Morelia, Mexico (Oct. 19, 2007) & New York City (Oct. 26 & 27, 2007).

Ten years later he was minister of Pitsligo in Aberdeenshire, a charge which he left in 1638 for that of Newbattle in Midlothian. In July of that year he went with other commissioners to Aberdeen in the vain attempt to induce the university and the presbytery of that city to subscribe the National Covenant, and in the following November sat in the general assembly at Glasgow which abolished episcopacy in Scotland. In 1638 Cant was minister of Pitsligo in Aberdeenshire. In 1640 he was chaplain to the Scottish army and then settled as minister in Aberdeen. Though a staunch Covenanter, he was a zealous Royalist, preaching before Charles I in Edinburgh, and stoutly advocating the restoration of the monarchy in the time of the Commonwealth. Cant's frequent and bitter verbal attacks on various members of his congregation led in 1661 to complaints laid before the magistrates, in consequence of which he resigned his charge.

It states that at equilibrium, each elementary process is in equilibrium with its reverse process. ==History== The principle of detailed balance was explicitly introduced for collisions by Ludwig Boltzmann. In 1872, he proved his H-theorem using this principle.Boltzmann, L. (1964), Lectures on gas theory, Berkeley, CA, USA: U. of California Press. The arguments in favor of this property are founded upon microscopic reversibility.Tolman, R. C. (1938). The Principles of Statistical Mechanics. Oxford University Press, London, UK. Five years before Boltzmann, James Clerk Maxwell used the principle of detailed balance for gas kinetics with the reference to the principle of sufficient reason.Maxwell, J.C. (1867), On the dynamical theory of gases, Philosl Trans R Soc London, 157 , pp. 49–88 He compared the idea of detailed balance with other types of balancing (like cyclic balance) and found that \\"Now it is impossible to assign a reason\\" why detailed balance should be rejected (pg. 64). Albert Einstein in 1916 used the principle of detailed balance in a background for his quantum theory of emission and absorption of radiation.Einstein, A. (1916). Strahlungs-Emission und -Absorption nach der Quantentheorie [=Emission and absorption of radiation in quantum theory], Verhandlungen der Deutschen Physikalischen Gesellschaft 18 (13/14). Braunschweig: Vieweg, 318–323. See also: A. Einstein (1917). Zur Quantentheorie der Strahlung [=On the quantum theory of radiation], Physikalische Zeitschrift 18 (1917), 121–128. English translation: D. ter Haar (1967): The Old Quantum Theory. Pergamon Press, pp. 167–183. In 1901, Rudolf Wegscheider introduced the principle of detailed balance for chemical kinetics.Wegscheider, R. (1901) Über simultane Gleichgewichte und die Beziehungen zwischen Thermodynamik und Reactionskinetik homogener Systeme, Monatshefte für Chemie / Chemical Monthly 32(8), 849–906. In particular, he demonstrated that the irreversible cycles A1 -> A2 -> \\\\cdots -> A_\\\\mathit{n} -> A1 are impossible and found explicitly the relations between kinetic constants that follow from the principle of detailed balance. In 1931, Lars Onsager used these relations in his works,Onsager, L. (1931), Reciprocal relations in irreversible processes. I, Phys. Rev. 37, 405–426; II 38, 2265–2279 for which he was awarded the 1968 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. The principle of detailed balance has been used in Markov chain Monte Carlo methods since their invention in 1953. In particular, in the Metropolis–Hastings algorithm and in its important particular case, Gibbs sampling, it is used as a simple and reliable condition to provide the desirable equilibrium state. Now, the principle of detailed balance is a standard part of the university courses in statistical mechanics, physical chemistry, chemical and physical kinetics.van Kampen, N.G. \\"Stochastic Processes in Physics and Chemistry\\", Elsevier Science (1992).Yablonskii, G.S., Bykov, V.I., Gorban, A.N., Elokhin, V.I. (1991), Kinetic Models of Catalytic Reactions, Amsterdam, The Netherlands: Elsevier. Vol. 10 of the Course of Theoretical Physics(3rd Ed). ==Microscopic background== The microscopic \\"reversing of time\\" turns at the kinetic level into the \\"reversing of arrows\\": the elementary processes transform into their reverse processes. For example, the reaction :\\\\sum_i \\\\alpha_i \\\\ce A_i \\\\ce{->} \\\\sum_j \\\\beta_j \\\\ce B_j transforms into \\\\sum_j \\\\beta_j \\\\ce B_j \\\\ce{->} \\\\sum_i \\\\alpha_i \\\\ce A_i and conversely. (Here, \\\\ce A_i, \\\\ce B_j are symbols of components or states, \\\\alpha_i, \\\\beta_j \\\\geq 0 are coefficients). The equilibrium ensemble should be invariant with respect to this transformation because of microreversibility and the uniqueness of thermodynamic equilibrium. This leads us immediately to the concept of detailed balance: each process is equilibrated by its reverse process. This reasoning is based on three assumptions: # \\\\ce A_i does not change under time reversal; # Equilibrium is invariant under time reversal; # The macroscopic elementary processes are microscopically distinguishable. That is, they represent disjoint sets of microscopic events. Any of these assumptions may be violated.Gorban, A.N. (2014),Detailed balance in micro- and macrokinetics and micro-distinguishability of macro-processes, Results in Physics 4, 142–147 For example, Boltzmann's collision can be represented as +A_\\\\mathit{w} -> {A_\\\\mathit{v'}}+A_\\\\mathit{w'},}} where \\\\ce A_v is a particle with velocity v. Under time reversal \\\\ce A_v transforms into \\\\ce A_{-v}. Therefore, the collision is transformed into the reverse collision by the PT transformation, where P is the space inversion and T is the time reversal. Detailed balance for Boltzmann's equation requires PT-invariance of collisions' dynamics, not just T-invariance. Indeed, after the time reversal the collision +A_\\\\mathit{w} -> {A_\\\\mathit{v'}}+A_\\\\mathit{w'},}} transforms into +A_\\\\mathit{-w'} -> {A_\\\\mathit{-v}}+A_\\\\mathit{-w}.}} For the detailed balance we need transformation into +A_\\\\mathit{w'} -> {A_\\\\mathit{v}}+A_\\\\mathit{w}.}} For this purpose, we need to apply additionally the space reversal P. Therefore, for the detailed balance in Boltzmann's equation not T-invariance but PT-invariance is needed. Equilibrium may be not T- or PT-invariant even if the laws of motion are invariant. This non- invariance may be caused by the spontaneous symmetry breaking. There exist nonreciprocal media (for example, some bi-isotropic materials) without T and PT invariance. If different macroscopic processes are sampled from the same elementary microscopic events then macroscopic detailed balance may be violated even when microscopic detailed balance holds.Joshi, B. (2013), Deterministic detailed balance in chemical reaction networks is sufficient but not necessary for stochastic detailed balance, arXiv:1312.4196 [math.PR]. Now, after almost 150 years of development, the scope of validity and the violations of detailed balance in kinetics seem to be clear. ==Reversible Markov chains== A Markov process is called a reversible Markov process or reversible Markov chain if it satisfies the detailed balance equations. These equations require that the transition probability matrix, P, for the Markov process possess a stationary distribution (i.e. equilibrium probability distribution) π such that :\\\\pi_{i} P_{ij} = \\\\pi_{j} P_{ji}\\\\,, where Pij is the Markov transition probability from state i to state j, i.e. , and πi and πj are the equilibrium probabilities of being in states i and j, respectively. When for all i, this is equivalent to the joint probability matrix, being symmetric in i and j; or symmetric in and t. The definition carries over straightforwardly to continuous variables, where π becomes a probability density, and a transition kernel probability density from state s′ to state s: :\\\\pi(s') P(s',s) = \\\\pi(s) P(s,s')\\\\,. The detailed balance condition is stronger than that required merely for a stationary distribution; that is, there are Markov processes with stationary distributions that do not have detailed balance. Detailed balance implies that, around any closed cycle of states, there is no net flow of probability. For example, it implies that, for all a, b and c, :P(a,b) P(b,c) P(c,a) = P(a,c) P(c,b) P(b,a)\\\\,. This can be proved by substitution from the definition. In the case of a positive transition matrix, the \\"no net flow\\" condition implies detailed balance. Indeed, a necessary and sufficient condition for the reversibility condition is Kolmogorov's criterion, which demands that for the reversible chains the product of transition rates over any closed loop of states must be the same in both directions. Transition matrices that are symmetric or always have detailed balance. In these cases, a uniform distribution over the states is an equilibrium distribution. For continuous systems with detailed balance, it may be possible to continuously transform the coordinates until the equilibrium distribution is uniform, with a transition kernel which then is symmetric. In the case of discrete states, it may be possible to achieve something similar by breaking the Markov states into appropriately-sized degenerate sub-states. ==Detailed balance and entropy increase== For many systems of physical and chemical kinetics, detailed balance provides sufficient conditions for the strict increase of entropy in isolated systems. For example, the famous Boltzmann H-theorem states that, according to the Boltzmann equation, the principle of detailed balance implies positivity of entropy production. The Boltzmann formula (1872) for entropy production in rarefied gas kinetics with detailed balance served as a prototype of many similar formulas for dissipation in mass action kineticsVolpert, A.I., Khudyaev, S.I.

Nevertheless, the principle of detailed balance is not necessary for entropy growth. For example, in the linear irreversible cycle A1 -> A2 -> A3 -> A1, entropy production is positive but the principle of detailed balance does not hold. Thus, the principle of detailed balance is a sufficient but not necessary condition for entropy increase in Boltzmann kinetics. These relations between the principle of detailed balance and the second law of thermodynamics were clarified in 1887 when Hendrik Lorentz objected to the Boltzmann H-theorem for polyatomic gases.Lorentz H.-A. (1887) Über das Gleichgewicht der lebendigen Kraft unter Gasmolekülen. Sitzungsberichte der Kaiserlichen Akademie der Wissenschaften in Wien. 95 (2), 115–152. Lorentz stated that the principle of detailed balance is not applicable to collisions of polyatomic molecules. Boltzmann immediately invented a new, more general condition sufficient for entropy growth.Boltzmann L. (1887) Neuer Beweis zweier Sätze über das Wärmegleichgewicht unter mehratomigen Gasmolekülen. Sitzungsberichte der Kaiserlichen Akademie der Wissenschaften in Wien. 95 (2), 153–164. Boltzmann's condition holds for all Markov processes, irrespective of time-reversibility. Later, entropy increase was proved for all Markov processes by a direct method.Shannon, C.E. (1948) A Mathematical Theory of Communication, Bell System Technical Journal, Vol. 27, pp. 379–423, 623–656. Hugh Everett Theory of the Universal Wavefunction, Thesis, Princeton University, (1956, 1973), Appendix I, pp 121 ff. In his thesis, Everett used the term \\"detailed balance\\" unconventionally, instead of balance equation These theorems may be considered as simplifications of the Boltzmann result. Later, this condition was referred to as the \\"cyclic balance\\" condition (because it holds for irreversible cycles) or the \\"semi-detailed balance\\" or the \\"complex balance\\". In 1981, Carlo Cercignani and Maria Lampis proved that the Lorentz arguments were wrong and the principle of detailed balance is valid for polyatomic molecules.Cercignani, C. and Lampis, M. (1981). On the H-theorem for polyatomic gases, Journal of Statistical Physics, V. 26 (4), 795–801. Nevertheless, the extended semi-detailed balance conditions invented by Boltzmann in this discussion remain the remarkable generalization of the detailed balance. ==Wegscheider's conditions for the generalized mass action law== In chemical kinetics, the elementary reactions are represented by the stoichiometric equations :\\\\sum_i \\\\alpha_{ri} \\\\ce A_i \\\\ce{->} \\\\sum_j \\\\beta_{rj} \\\\ce A_j \\\\;\\\\; (r=1, \\\\ldots, m) \\\\, , where \\\\ce A_i are the components and \\\\alpha_{ri}, \\\\beta_{rj}\\\\geq 0 are the stoichiometric coefficients. Here, the reverse reactions with positive constants are included in the list separately. We need this separation of direct and reverse reactions to apply later the general formalism to the systems with some irreversible reactions. The system of stoichiometric equations of elementary reactions is the reaction mechanism. The stoichiometric matrix is \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\Gamma}=(\\\\gamma_{ri}), \\\\gamma_{ri}=\\\\beta_{ri}-\\\\alpha_{ri} (gain minus loss). This matrix need not be square. The stoichiometric vector \\\\gamma_r is the rth row of \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\Gamma} with coordinates \\\\gamma_{ri}=\\\\beta_{ri}-\\\\alpha_{ri}. According to the generalized mass action law, the reaction rate for an elementary reaction is :w_r=k_r \\\\prod_{i=1}^n a_i^{\\\\alpha_{ri}} \\\\, , where a_i\\\\geq 0 is the activity (the \\"effective concentration\\") of A_i. The reaction mechanism includes reactions with the reaction rate constants k_r>0. For each r the following notations are used: k_r^+=k_r; w_r^+=w_r; k_r^- is the reaction rate constant for the reverse reaction if it is in the reaction mechanism and 0 if it is not; w_r^- is the reaction rate for the reverse reaction if it is in the reaction mechanism and 0 if it is not. For a reversible reaction, K_r=k_r^+/k_r^- is the equilibrium constant. The principle of detailed balance for the generalized mass action law is: For given values k_r there exists a positive equilibrium a_i^{\\\\rm eq}>0 that satisfies detailed balance, that is, w_r^+=w_r^-. This means that the system of linear detailed balance equations : \\\\sum_i \\\\gamma_{ri} x_i = \\\\ln k_r^+-\\\\ln k_r^-=\\\\ln K_r is solvable (x_i=\\\\ln a_i^{\\\\rm eq}). The following classical result gives the necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a positive equilibrium a_i^{\\\\rm eq}>0 with detailed balance (see, for example, the textbook). Two conditions are sufficient and necessary for solvability of the system of detailed balance equations: # If k_r^+>0 then k_r^->0 and, conversely, if k_r^->0 then k_r^+>0 (reversibility); # For any solution \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\lambda}=(\\\\lambda_r) of the system :\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\lambda \\\\Gamma} =0 \\\\;\\\\; \\\\left(\\\\mbox{i.e.}\\\\;\\\\; \\\\sum_r \\\\lambda_r \\\\gamma_{ri}=0\\\\;\\\\; \\\\mbox{for all} \\\\;\\\\; i\\\\right) the Wegscheider's identityGorban, A.N, Yablonsky, G.S. (2011) Extended detailed balance for systems with irreversible reactions, Chemical Engineering Science 66, 5388–5399. holds: :\\\\prod_{r=1}^m (k_r^+)^{\\\\lambda_r}=\\\\prod_{r=1}^m (k_r^-)^{\\\\lambda_r} \\\\, . Remark. It is sufficient to use in the Wegscheider conditions a basis of solutions of the system \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\lambda \\\\Gamma} =0 . In particular, for any cycle in the monomolecular (linear) reactions the product of the reaction rate constants in the clockwise direction is equal to the product of the reaction rate constants in the counterclockwise direction. The same condition is valid for the reversible Markov processes (it is equivalent to the \\"no net flow\\" condition). A simple nonlinear example gives us a linear cycle supplemented by one nonlinear step: # A1 <=> A2 # A2 <=> A3 # A3 <=> A1 # {A1}+A2 <=> 2A3 There are two nontrivial independent Wegscheider's identities for this system: :k_1^+k_2^+k_3^+=k_1^-k_2^-k_3^- and k_3^+k_4^+/k_2^+=k_3^-k_4^-/k_2^- They correspond to the following linear relations between the stoichiometric vectors: :\\\\gamma_1+\\\\gamma_2+\\\\gamma_3=0 and \\\\gamma_3+\\\\gamma_4-\\\\gamma_2=0. The computational aspect of the Wegscheider conditions was studied by D. Colquhoun with co-authors.Colquhoun, D., Dowsland, K.A., Beato, M., and Plested, A.J.R. (2004) How to Impose Microscopic Reversibility in Complex Reaction Mechanisms, Biophysical Journal 86, June 2004, 3510–3518 The Wegscheider conditions demonstrate that whereas the principle of detailed balance states a local property of equilibrium, it implies the relations between the kinetic constants that are valid for all states far from equilibrium. This is possible because a kinetic law is known and relations between the rates of the elementary processes at equilibrium can be transformed into relations between kinetic constants which are used globally. For the Wegscheider conditions this kinetic law is the law of mass action (or the generalized law of mass action). ==Dissipation in systems with detailed balance== To describe dynamics of the systems that obey the generalized mass action law, one has to represent the activities as functions of the concentrations cj and temperature. For this purpose, use the representation of the activity through the chemical potential: :a_i = \\\\exp\\\\left (\\\\frac{\\\\mu_i - \\\\mu^{\\\\ominus}_i}{RT}\\\\right ) where μi is the chemical potential of the species under the conditions of interest, is the chemical potential of that species in the chosen standard state, R is the gas constant and T is the thermodynamic temperature. The chemical potential can be represented as a function of c and T, where c is the vector of concentrations with components cj. For the ideal systems, \\\\mu_i=RT\\\\ln c_i+\\\\mu^{\\\\ominus}_i and a_j=c_j: the activity is the concentration and the generalized mass action law is the usual law of mass action. Consider a system in isothermal (T=const) isochoric (the volume V=const) condition. For these conditions, the Helmholtz free energy measures the “useful” work obtainable from a system. It is a functions of the temperature T, the volume V and the amounts of chemical components Nj (usually measured in moles), N is the vector with components Nj. For the ideal systems, :F=RT \\\\sum_i N_i \\\\left(\\\\ln\\\\left(\\\\frac{N_i}{V}\\\\right)-1+\\\\frac{\\\\mu^{\\\\ominus}_i(T)}{RT}\\\\right) . The chemical potential is a partial derivative: \\\\mu_i=\\\\partial F(T,V,N)/\\\\partial N_j. The chemical kinetic equations are :\\\\frac{d N_i}{d t}=V \\\\sum_r \\\\gamma_{ri}(w^+_r-w^-_r) . If the principle of detailed balance is valid then for any value of T there exists a positive point of detailed balance ceq: :w^+_r(c^{\\\\rm eq},T)=w^-_r(c^{\\\\rm eq},T)=w^{\\\\rm eq}_r Elementary algebra gives :w^+_r=w^{\\\\rm eq}_r \\\\exp \\\\left(\\\\sum_i \\\\frac{\\\\alpha_{ri}(\\\\mu_i-\\\\mu^{\\\\rm eq}_i)}{RT}\\\\right); \\\\;\\\\; w^-_r=w^{\\\\rm eq}_r \\\\exp \\\\left(\\\\sum_i \\\\frac{\\\\beta_{ri}(\\\\mu_i-\\\\mu^{\\\\rm eq}_i)}{RT}\\\\right); where \\\\mu^{\\\\rm eq}_i=\\\\mu_i(c^{\\\\rm eq},T) For the dissipation we obtain from these formulas: :\\\\frac{d F}{d t}=\\\\sum_i \\\\frac{\\\\partial F(T,V,N)}{\\\\partial N_i} \\\\frac{d N_i}{d t}=\\\\sum_i \\\\mu_i \\\\frac{d N_i}{d t} = -VRT \\\\sum_r (\\\\ln w_r^+-\\\\ln w_r^-) (w_r^+-w_r^-) \\\\leq 0 The inequality holds because ln is a monotone function and, hence, the expressions \\\\ln w_r^+-\\\\ln w_r^- and w_r^+-w_r^- have always the same sign. Similar inequalities are valid for other classical conditions for the closed systems and the corresponding characteristic functions: for isothermal isobaric conditions the Gibbs free energy decreases, for the isochoric systems with the constant internal energy (isolated systems) the entropy increases as well as for isobaric systems with the constant enthalpy. == Onsager reciprocal relations and detailed balance == Let the principle of detailed balance be valid. Then, for small deviations from equilibrium, the kinetic response of the system can be approximated as linearly related to its deviation from chemical equilibrium, giving the reaction rates for the generalized mass action law as: :w^+_r=w^{\\\\rm eq}_r \\\\left(1+\\\\sum_i \\\\frac{\\\\alpha_{ri}(\\\\mu_i-\\\\mu^{\\\\rm eq}_i)}{RT}\\\\right); \\\\;\\\\; w^-_r=w^{\\\\rm eq}_r \\\\left(1+ \\\\sum_i \\\\frac{\\\\beta_{ri}(\\\\mu_i-\\\\mu^{\\\\rm eq}_i)}{RT}\\\\right); Therefore, again in the linear response regime near equilibrium, the kinetic equations are (\\\\gamma_{ri}=\\\\beta_{ri}-\\\\alpha_{ri}): :\\\\frac{d N_i}{d t}=-V \\\\sum_j \\\\left[\\\\sum_r w^{\\\\rm eq}_r \\\\gamma_{ri}\\\\gamma_{rj}\\\\right] \\\\frac{\\\\mu_j-\\\\mu^{\\\\rm eq}_j}{RT}. This is exactly the Onsager form: following the original work of Onsager, we should introduce the thermodynamic forces X_j and the matrix of coefficients L_{ij} in the form :X_j = \\\\frac{\\\\mu_j-\\\\mu^{\\\\rm eq}_j}{T}; \\\\;\\\\; \\\\frac{d N_i}{d t}=\\\\sum_j L_{ij}X_j The coefficient matrix L_{ij} is symmetric: :L_{ij}=-\\\\frac{V}{R}\\\\sum_r w^{\\\\rm eq}_r \\\\gamma_{ri}\\\\gamma_{rj} These symmetry relations, L_{ij}=L_{ji}, are exactly the Onsager reciprocal relations. The coefficient matrix L is non- positive. It is negative on the linear span of the stoichiometric vectors \\\\gamma_{r}. So, the Onsager relations follow from the principle of detailed balance in the linear approximation near equilibrium. ==Semi-detailed balance== To formulate the principle of semi-detailed balance, it is convenient to count the direct and inverse elementary reactions separately. In this case, the kinetic equations have the form: :\\\\frac{d N_i}{d t}=V\\\\sum_r \\\\gamma_{ri} w_r=V\\\\sum_r (\\\\beta_{ri}-\\\\alpha_{ri})w_r Let us use the notations \\\\alpha_r=\\\\alpha_{ri}, \\\\beta_r=\\\\beta_{ri} for the input and the output vectors of the stoichiometric coefficients of the rth elementary reaction. Let Y be the set of all these vectors \\\\alpha_r, \\\\beta_r. For each u \\\\in Y, let us define two sets of numbers: :R_{ u}^+=\\\\\\\\{r\\\\alpha_r= u \\\\\\\\}; \\\\;\\\\;\\\\; R_{ u}^-=\\\\\\\\{r\\\\beta_r= u \\\\\\\\} r \\\\in R_{ u}^+ if and only if u is the vector of the input stoichiometric coefficients \\\\alpha_r for the rth elementary reaction;r \\\\in R_{ u}^- if and only if u is the vector of the output stoichiometric coefficients \\\\beta_r for the rth elementary reaction. The principle of semi-detailed balance means that in equilibrium the semi- detailed balance condition holds: for every u \\\\in Y :\\\\sum_{r\\\\in R_{ u}^-}w_r=\\\\sum_{r\\\\in R_{ u}^+}w_r The semi-detailed balance condition is sufficient for the stationarity: it implies that :\\\\frac{d N}{dt}=V \\\\sum_r \\\\gamma_r w_r=0. For the Markov kinetics the semi-detailed balance condition is just the elementary balance equation and holds for any steady state. For the nonlinear mass action law it is, in general, sufficient but not necessary condition for stationarity. The semi-detailed balance condition is weaker than the detailed balance one: if the principle of detailed balance holds then the condition of semi-detailed balance also holds. For systems that obey the generalized mass action law the semi-detailed balance condition is sufficient for the dissipation inequality d F/ dt \\\\geq 0 (for the Helmholtz free energy under isothermal isochoric conditions and for the dissipation inequalities under other classical conditions for the corresponding thermodynamic potentials). Boltzmann introduced the semi-detailed balance condition for collisions in 1887 and proved that it guaranties the positivity of the entropy production. For chemical kinetics, this condition (as the complex balance condition) was introduced by Horn and Jackson in 1972.Horn, F., Jackson, R. (1972) General mass action kinetics. Arch. Ration. Mech. Anal. 47, 87–116. The microscopic backgrounds for the semi-detailed balance were found in the Markov microkinetics of the intermediate compounds that are present in small amounts and whose concentrations are in quasiequilibrium with the main components.Stueckelberg, E.C.G. (1952) Theoreme H et unitarite de S. Helv. Phys. Acta 25, 577–-580 Under these microscopic assumptions, the semi-detailed balance condition is just the balance equation for the Markov microkinetics according to the Michaelis–Menten–Stueckelberg theorem.Gorban, A.N., Shahzad, M. (2011) The Michaelis–Menten–Stueckelberg Theorem. Entropy 13, no. 5, 966–1019. == Dissipation in systems with semi-detailed balance == Let us represent the generalized mass action law in the equivalent form: the rate of the elementary process :\\\\sum_i \\\\alpha_{ri} \\\\ce A_i \\\\ce{->} \\\\sum_i \\\\beta_{ri} \\\\ce A_i is :w_r=\\\\varphi_r \\\\exp\\\\left(\\\\sum_i\\\\frac{\\\\alpha_{ri} \\\\mu_i}{RT}\\\\right) where \\\\mu_i=\\\\partial F(T,V,N)/ \\\\partial N_i is the chemical potential and F(T,V,N) is the Helmholtz free energy. The exponential term is called the Boltzmann factor and the multiplier \\\\varphi_r \\\\geq 0 is the kinetic factor. Let us count the direct and reverse reaction in the kinetic equation separately: :\\\\frac{d N_i}{d t}=V\\\\sum_r \\\\gamma_{ri} w_r An auxiliary function \\\\theta(\\\\lambda) of one variable \\\\lambda\\\\in [0,1] is convenient for the representation of dissipation for the mass action law :\\\\theta(\\\\lambda)=\\\\sum_{r}\\\\varphi_{r}\\\\exp\\\\left(\\\\sum_i\\\\frac{(\\\\lambda \\\\alpha_{ri}+(1-\\\\lambda)\\\\beta_{ri}))\\\\mu_i}{RT}\\\\right) This function \\\\theta(\\\\lambda) may be considered as the sum of the reaction rates for deformed input stoichiometric coefficients \\\\tilde{\\\\alpha}_{\\\\rho}(\\\\lambda)=\\\\lambda \\\\alpha_{\\\\rho}+(1-\\\\lambda)\\\\beta_{\\\\rho}. For \\\\lambda=1 it is just the sum of the reaction rates. The function \\\\theta(\\\\lambda) is convex because \\\\theta(\\\\lambda) \\\\geq 0. Direct calculation gives that according to the kinetic equations : \\\\frac{d F}{d t}=-VRT \\\\left.\\\\frac{d \\\\theta(\\\\lambda)}{d \\\\lambda}\\\\right_{\\\\lambda=1} This is the general dissipation formula for the generalized mass action law. Convexity of \\\\theta(\\\\lambda) gives the sufficient and necessary conditions for the proper dissipation inequality: :\\\\frac{d F}{d t}<0 \\\\mbox{ if and only if } \\\\theta(\\\\lambda)< \\\\theta(1) \\\\mbox{ for some }\\\\lambda <1; \\\\;\\\\;\\\\; \\\\frac{d F}{d t}\\\\leq0 \\\\mbox{ if and only if } \\\\theta(\\\\lambda)\\\\leq \\\\theta(1) \\\\mbox{ for some }\\\\lambda <1 The semi-detailed balance condition can be transformed into identity \\\\theta(0)\\\\equiv \\\\theta(1). Therefore, for the systems with semi- detailed balance {d F}/{d t}\\\\leq 0. == Cone theorem and local equivalence of detailed and complex balance == For any reaction mechanism and a given positive equilibrium a cone of possible velocities for the systems with detailed balance is defined for any non-equilibrium state N \\\\mathbf{Q}_{\\\\rm DB}(N)={\\\\rm cone}\\\\\\\\{\\\\gamma_r {\\\\rm sgn}(w_r^+(N)-w_r^-(N)) \\\\  \\\\ r=1, \\\\ldots , m\\\\\\\\}, where cone stands for the conical hull and the piecewise-constant functions {\\\\rm sgn}(w_r^+(N)-w_r^-(N)) do not depend on (positive) values of equilibrium reaction rates w_r^{\\\\rm eq} and are defined by thermodynamic quantities under assumption of detailed balance. The cone theorem states that for the given reaction mechanism and given positive equilibrium, the velocity (dN/dt) at a state N for a system with complex balance belongs to the cone \\\\mathbf{Q}_{\\\\rm DB}(N). That is, there exists a system with detailed balance, the same reaction mechanism, the same positive equilibrium, that gives the same velocity at state N. According to cone theorem, for a given state N, the set of velocities of the semidetailed balance systems coincides with the set of velocities of the detailed balance systems if their reaction mechanisms and equilibria coincide. This means local equivalence of detailed and complex balance. == Detailed balance for systems with irreversible reactions == Detailed balance states that in equilibrium each elementary process is equilibrated by its reverse process and requires reversibility of all elementary processes. For many real physico-chemical complex systems (e.g. homogeneous combustion, heterogeneous catalytic oxidation, most enzyme reactions etc.), detailed mechanisms include both reversible and irreversible reactions. If one represents irreversible reactions as limits of reversible steps, then it becomes obvious that not all reaction mechanisms with irreversible reactions can be obtained as limits of systems or reversible reactions with detailed balance. For example, the irreversible cycle A1 -> A2 -> A3 -> A1 cannot be obtained as such a limit but the reaction mechanism A1 -> A2 -> A3 <\\\\- A1 can.Chu, Ch. (1971), Gas absorption accompanied by a system of first-order reactions, Chem. Eng. Sci. 26(3), 305–312. Gorban–Yablonsky theorem. A system of reactions with some irreversible reactions is a limit of systems with detailed balance when some constants tend to zero if and only if (i) the reversible part of this system satisfies the principle of detailed balance and (ii) the convex hull of the stoichiometric vectors of the irreversible reactions has empty intersection with the linear span of the stoichiometric vectors of the reversible reactions. Physically, the last condition means that the irreversible reactions cannot be included in oriented cyclic pathways. ==See also== * T-symmetry * Microscopic reversibility * Master equation * Balance equation * Gibbs sampling * Metropolis–Hastings algorithm * Atomic spectral line (deduction of the Einstein coefficients) * Random walks on graphs ==References== Category:Non-equilibrium thermodynamics Category:Statistical mechanics Category:Markov models Category:Chemical kinetics ","title":"Detailed balance"},{"id":"2212873","text":"Robert Louis Moore (August 13, 1942 - June 18, 2016) was an American Jungian analyst and consultant in private practice in Chicago, Illinois. He was the Distinguished Service Professor of Psychology, Psychoanalysis and Spirituality at the Chicago Theological Seminary; a training analyst at the C.G. Jung Institute of Chicago; and director of research for the Institute for the Science of Psychoanalysis. Author and editor of numerous books in psychology and spirituality, he lectured internationally on his formulation of a Neo- Jungian paradigm for psychotherapy and psychoanalysis. He was working on Structural Psychoanalysis and Integrative Psychotherapy: A Neo-Jungian Paradigm at the time of his death. He murdered his wife, Margaret Shanahan, and then took his own life in a 2016 murder-suicide. ==Life and career== Robert Louis Moore was born on August 13, 1942. His parents were Golden Franklin Moore Sr. and Margaret DePriest Moore. Moore has characterized his roots as \\"Cajun Catholic, Russian Jewish, and Scotch-Irish Protestant\\". He was married to Margaret Shanahan and lived in Chicago. His education was extensive: 1964: B.A., Hendrix College (Religion/Behavioral Science); 1967: M.Th., Southern Methodist University (Psychology and Theology); 1968: M.Th., Duke University (Counseling Psychology and Religion); 1970: M.A., University of Chicago (Psychology and Religion); 1975: Ph.D., University of Chicago (Psychology and Religion); 1983: Diplomate, Adler Institute (Adlerian Psychoanalysis)); 1987: Diplomate, C. G. Jung Institute (Jungian Psychoanalysis). Moore was deeply impressed with three University of Chicago professors, Mircea Eliade, Victor Turner, and Paul Tillich. His employment history shows that he found a home at the Chicago Theological Seminary: 1973-1977: Western Illinois University, Assistant Professor of Philosophy and Religious Studies; 1977-1979: Chicago Theological Seminary, Assistant Professor of Psychology and Religion; 1979-1982: Associate Professor of Psychology and Religion; 1982-2005: Professor of Psychology, Psychoanalysis, and Spirituality; 2005–2016: Distinguished Service Professor of Psychology, Psychoanalysis, and Spirituality. He was also employed from 1973 to 2016 in the private practice of psychotherapy; and from 1983 to 2016 in the private practice of psychoanalysis and as a consultant in organizational development and leadership and personal coaching. ==Contributions in perspectiveIntroduction=== As a psychoanalytic scientist, Moore worked on decoding and mapping the deep structures of the human self. His work on ritual process and the masculine psyche is today in the forefront of theory in masculine psychology, spirituality, and initiation. The men's movement in the United States received a certain amount of notoriety for the practice of drumming. This practice is understood in terms of ritual processes. Many of our human ancestors worked out ritual processes, some of which did involve drumming and dancing and singing. From his cross-cultural study of ritual processes, Moore became convinced of the value of ritual process in actuating human potential. More specifically, he became convinced that ritual processes at their best can provide liminal experiences for certain participants that are instrumental in enabling those participants to actuate the potential of archetypal sources of energy (that is, sources of energy at the archetypal level of the human psyche). Moore's views regarding ritual processes can be found in the transcribed lectures and essays published in The Archetype of Initiation: Sacred Space, Ritual Process, and Personal Transformation (2001), discussed below. In addition to writing and editing numerous books, Moore frequently gave short courses at the C. G. Jung Institute of Chicago, many of which are available from the institute on audiotapes. ===Five key books=== Moore is probably most widely known as the senior author, with Douglas Gillette, of a series of five books on the in-depth structure of the male psyche, drawing on the account of the archetypal level of the human psyche developed by C. G. Jung. # King, Warrior, Magician, Lover: Rediscovering the Archetypes of the Mature Masculine is an introductory overview of four key sources of energy at the archetypal level of the human psyche. # The King Within: Accessing the King in the Male Psyche centers on the most important and most difficult source of energy for men to access. # The Warrior Within: Accessing the Knight in the Male Psyche centers on the source of energy that boys and men usually learn how to access relatively early in life, but it takes time and effort to learn how to access the optimally mature form of this source of energy in the human psyche. # The Magician Within: Accessing the Shaman in the Male Psyche centers on another form of energy that boys and men usually learn how to access at a relatively early age, but, once again, it takes time and effort to learn how to access the optimally mature form of this source of energy in the human psyche. # The Lover Within: Accessing the Lover in the Male Psyche centers on a very tricky source of energy in the human psyche. According to Moore and Gillette, for each optimal orientation for each of these four key sources of energy, there are two corresponding \\"shadow\\" forms of the source of the energy—two ways for each of them to be misdirected for only one healthy or optimal way for each of them to be oriented. Just as the authors have given four key sources of energy in the human psyche very colorful names that seem to personify each source, so too the authors give each of the bipolar \\"shadow\\" forms very colorful names that seem to personify them. Even though Moore stresses the positive potential of the archetypes of maturity, as he styles the healthy forms of the archetypes (as distinct from the \\"shadow\\" forms), he also stresses that archetypes are not friendly. By this he means that they can be dangerous because they can take over a person. So they are best approached with caution. Moore has also noted that various forms of masculine behavior are immature, and so he thinks it is important for men today to develop guidelines for directing their own personal development and decision making. ===Three recent books=== The 21st century has seen the publication of three new books by Moore that carry forward certain dimensions of his thought: * 2001: The Archetype of Initiation contains selected lectures and essays by Moore on sacred space, ritual process, and personal transformation. By the term \\"archetype\\" here Moore means the structure of personal initiation. By the term \\"initiation\\" here he means the processes whereby one leaves behind certain aspects of one's earlier life and moves toward a new constellation of one's life. * 2002: The Magician and the Analyst is a short treatise on the archetype of the Magus in occult spirituality and Jungian analysis. One usually moves from one constellation of one's life to a new constellation with the assistance of someone else, or of several others. The person(s) who plays this pivotal enabling role for someone else is drawing on energies at the archetypal level of the human psyche that Moore refers to as Magician energies or Magus energies. * 2003: Facing the Dragon: Confronting Personal and Spiritual Grandiosity is a collection of essays about various aspects of grandiosity. The point is to distinguish between grandiosity and true human greatness. ==PublicationsBooks by Moore=== * John Wesley and Authority: A Psychological Perspective (Scholars Press, 1979). * The Archetype of Initiation: Sacred Space, Ritual Process, and Personal Transformation (Xlibris, 2001). * The Magician and the Analyst: The Archetype of the Magus in Occult Spirituality and Jungian Analysis (Xlibris, 2002). * Facing the Dragon: Confronting Personal and Spiritual Grandiosity (Chiron Publications, 2003). ===Book with J.

He was also useful in a diplomatic capacity to both Wolsey and Henry VIII of England. ==Life== He was Dean of Windsor from 1519 to 1523, then Bishop of Bath and Wells until his death. When the question of King Henry VIII's annulment of his marriage to his first wife, Catherine of Aragon, was raised Clerk was appointed as one of the Queen's counsellors. Wolsey persuaded him to agree on her behalf that she should withdraw from the proceedings at Rome. Afterwards he joined in pronouncing the annulment, and is believed to have assisted Thomas Cranmer in work on the Act of Supremacy. His last embassy was in 1540, to the Duke of Cleves, to explain Henry's annulment of his marriage to Anne of Cleves. On his return he was taken ill at Dunkirk, possibly having been poisoned, but he managed to reach England, though only to die a short time later. He lies buried at St. Botolph's, Aldgate, not at Dunkirk, as sometimes stated.Catholic Encyclopedia ==References * Category:15th-century births Category:1541 deaths Category:Alumni of the University of Cambridge Category:Bishops of Bath and Wells Category:Deans of Windsor Category:16th-century English bishops Category:Masters of the Rolls Category:People from Cambridge Category:English Roman Catholic bishops Category:16th-century Roman Catholic bishops ","title":"John Clerk (bishop)"},{"id":"2212890","text":"Rodney Wilfred Heath (15 June 1884 – 26 October 1936) was an Australian tennis player. ==Personal== Heath was the second son of F.

In the 1927 Wimbledon Championships, Wood became the youngest competitor in the Men's Singles at 15 years 231 days old and the Men's Doubles at 15 years 234 days old. He was the third youngest winner of the Wimbledon Championships, which he won in 1931 at the age of 19 (beating Fred Perry in the semi finals and then Frank Shields withdrew from the final due to an ankle injury). Shields did so on request of the U.S. Davis Cup Committee, \\"Frank wanted to play me and it was an insult to Wimbledon and the public that he didn't,\\" recalled Wood. Wood is the only uncontested winner of a Wimbledon final. He also reached the finals of the Mixed Doubles of the French Championships in 1932, the Davis Cup in 1934, and the U.S. National Championships Men's Singles in 1935 (losing to Wilmer Allison).

He was Vice-President of the Philosophical Society of Edinburgh, the pre-eminent learned society of the Scottish Enlightenment. He was the father of George Clerk Maxwell and John Clerk of Eldin, and the great-great-grandfather of the famous physicist James Clerk Maxwell. ==Early life== John Clerk was son of Sir John Clerk, 1st Baronet by his first wife Elizabeth, daughter of Henry Henderson of Elvington. Burk, p. 257 He had a legal education first at University of Glasgow and then at Leiden University. During 1697 and 1698 he went on a Grand Tour and in 1700 was admitted to the Scottish Bar.Colvin, p. 257 ==Parliament== He was a member of the Parliament of Scotland for Whithorn from 1702 to 1707, and a Commissioner for the Union of Parliaments for the Whig Party: he sat in the first Parliament of Great Britain in 1707. He was appointed a Baron of the Exchequer for Scotland on the constitution of the Exchequer Court, 13 May 1708, a position he held for nearly half a century. With Baron Scrope, in 1726, he drew up an Historical View of the Forms and Powers of the Court of Exchequer in Scotland, which was printed at the expense of the Barons of Exchequer for private circulation. A leading supporter of the Act of Union 1707 with the Kingdom of England, Clerk wrote in his memoirs of English novelist, journalist and secret agent Daniel Defoe that it was not known at the time that Defoe had been sent by Godolphin : \\"... to give a faithful account to him from time to time how everything past here. He was therefor a spy among us, but not known to be such, otherways the Mob of Edin. had pull him to pieces\\".In a side-note at this point Clerk recommends Defoe's History of the Union of Great Britain : \\"This History of the Union deserves to be read. It was published in folio. There is not one fact in it which I can challenge\\" ==Antiquarian leanings== Of his other treatises, Clerk wrote papers in the Philosophical Transactions: one an Account of the Stylus of the Ancients and their different sorts of Paper, printed in 1731, and the others On the effects of Thunder on Trees and Of a large Deer's Horns found in the heart of an Oak, printed in 1739. He was the author of a tract entitled Dissertatio de quibusdam Monumentis Romanis &c;, written in 1730 but not published until 1750. For upwards of twenty years he also carried on a learned correspondence with Roger Gale, the English antiquary, which forms a portion of the Reliquiae Britannica of 1782. ==Patron of the arts== Sir John Clerk was one of the friends and patrons of the poet Allan Ramsay who, during his latter years, spent much of his time at Penicuik House. His son, Sir James Clerk, erected at the family seat an obelisk to Ramsay's memory. Sir John was a patron to various other artists and architects, and even dabbled in architecture himself. ==Musical talent== Clerk had a musical bent also, and while in Rome may have been tutored by the Baroque composer Arcangelo Corelli,Allsop, p. 58 but his own work has often been overlooked, primarily since the only record of his composition seems to be his own papers. One of his humorous songs was O merry may the maid be that marries the miller. ==Family== Sir John succeeded his father in his title and estates in 1722. He unsuccessfully courted Susanna, daughter of Sir Archibald Kennedy of Culzean, Baronet (ancestor of the Marquess of Ailsa) and that correspondence is in the National Archives. She became the third wife of Alexander, 9th Earl of Eglinton. He married, firstly, on 23 February 1701, Lady Margaret, eldest daughter of Alexander Stewart, 3rd Earl of Galloway who died in childbirth on 26 December that year. Her son, John, survived, but died unmarried in 1722. Sir John married again, to Janet, daughter of Sir John Inglis of Cramond, by whom he had seven sons and six daughters.

The mausoleum of Torsten Stålhandske and his wife in the Cathedral of Turku in Finland. The son of Torsten Svensson (Stålhandske), a noble military officer of Swedish ancestry from West Gothland, and Carin Lydiksdotter Jägerhorn, of Finnish nobility from southern Finland, Torsten Stålhandske married Kristina Horn in 1643. Albeit a short man, he was exceptionally strong; when a captured enemy officer, particularly a Pole or an Austrian was led into the Swedish camp, he would shake their hands so hard that blood would appear under their fingernails in what he called \\"an honest Swedish handshake\\". Hence, his nickname. Stålhandske started his military career as a squire to Patrick Ruthwen, with whom he had a task of recruiting military in Scotland. He followed Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden to Prussia, as an Ensign in his Personal guard in 1626. In the same year he was promoted to the rank of Major in the Regiment of Arvid Horn. In 1627 he joined the cavalry led by Åke Henriksson Tott. In 1629 he was promoted to Lieutenant-colonel in the Nylands och Tavastehus Cavalry regiment, leading Finnish horsemen, also known as Hakkapeliitat, for the first time into the Thirty Years' War. At the Battle of Breitenfeld (1631) they rode with the right wing personally led by King Gustavus Adolphus. In 1632 he was promoted to the rank of Colonel. At the siege of Nuremberg he assaulted the \\"invincible warriors\\" of Austrian Colonel Cronberg and, thanks to his mighty and successful charges, largely determined the outcome of the Battle of Lützen, where Gustavus Adolphus was killed, the battle was nonetheless won. In June 1634, Stålhandske was wounded at the Battle of Hamelin. In 1635, a Major-general, he joined the main army led by Banér. At the Battle of Wittstock he personally captured 35 flags and, at a critical juncture of the battle, forced the enemy to flee. Similarly, he distinguished himself at the Battle of Chemnitz as well as in Silesia, where he defended his positions during the whole year of 1640 against Count Mansfeld. Finally, in April 1642, he joined his forces with Torstenson's Army and took part in the Second Battle of Breitenfeld (also known as the First Battle of Leipzig), where he was seriously wounded. In May he was appointed general in Chief of the Cavalry. In 1643 Stålhandske followed Torstenson in Bohemia. In 1644 he crushed a hostile army corps in the Jutland, but then fell ill and died in Haderslev on 21 April 1644. Torsten Stålhandske's mausoleum can be seen in the Cathedral of Turku (Finland).

Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools. ==History== In 2016 the nine board members all voted to create a magnet school program in which different socioeconomic groups would be integrated. ==Governance== The Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education, or school board, consists of 9 members—3 at-large and 6 from districts. Before 1995, the board had been elected entirely on an at-large basis, but this was changed after it was discovered nearly all of the board members lived in the eastern part of the county. Members serve staggered four- year terms; the at-large members are elected in the year before presidential elections and the district members are elected in the year after presidential elections. Although school board elections are nonpartisan, the district members are elected from the same districts as the county commissioners.Board of Education .

(2007, 3 June). 13 high schools on best-of list. The Charlotte Observer. During the 2006–2007 school year CMS students received $43.5 million in academic merit-based financial aid from universities and other organizations, and $12.1 million in athletic scholarships. == Criticisms Judge Howard Manning=== In May 2005, Wake County Superior Court Judge Howard Manning Jr. issued a ruling in which he accused CMS of \\"academic genocide\\" against at-risk, low-income students in low-scoring high schools.Helms, Ann. (2005, 24 May). Judge accuses CMS of 'academic genocide'. The Charlotte Observer. Since the debut of its new student assignment plan in 2002, and the end of its court-ordered busing program, CMS has seen an increase in concentrations of poverty, with schools that have student-poverty rates of at least 75 percent at twice the number they were before.Smolowitz, Peter and Helms, Ann. (2007, 22 July). Now, his next chapter. The Charlotte Observer. In the same year, Judge Manning also threatened to close 4 of the lowest performing high schools, Garinger, Waddell, West Charlotte and West Mecklenburg. Many teachers and parents felt he had gone too far, and, in the end, this never occurred as the 4 high schools presented turnaround plans and their principals were deemed capable of carrying them out. The high schools are now included in a special Achievement Zone.Helms, Ann. (2006, 19 August). Threat to close schools lifted. The Charlotte Observer. ===2005 and 2007 bond packages=== 56% of voters rejected a $427 million bond package in 2005 to improve facilities and build new schools for the first time in a decade. Dissenters cited spats between members of the school board and other well- publicized events that year hurting their confidence in the district's ability to spend money effectively.Smolowitz, Peter and Helms, Ann. (2006, 29 July). Board works on avoiding squabbles. The Charlotte Observer. A$516 million bond package was backed by 68% of voters in November 2007.Smolowitz, Peter and Helms, Ann. (2007, 7 November). Only 2 of 195 precincts oppose bonds for CMS. The Charlotte Observer. ===Decentralization=== Calls for decentralization mounted in 2005 as dissatisfaction with CMS grew, with some wanting CMS broken up into smaller school systems.Helms, Ann and Smolowitz, Peter. (2005, 21 August). Poll finds support for shake-up. The Charlotte Observer. One notable incarnation of this movement was called DUMP (Don't Underestimate Mecklenburg Parents) CMS. This effort abated when the Board of Education requested and newly hired Superintendent Peter Gorman outlined a plan for decentralization, with the stated goal of putting resources and administration closer to parents and other members of the public. Regional offices known as \\"learning communities\\", each with an area superintendent, were implemented in the 2007–2008 school year.Decentralization .

Angang Station is a regular stop on the Donghae Nambu Line. The town center lies on the Hyeongsan River, near where it meets the small Chilpyeongcheon stream. Gampo-eup (No.8) also contains a piece of Gyeongju National Park: the Daebon section which covers the shoreline near the watery grave of King Munmu. 7,900 people live in Gampo-eup, served by three elementary schoos and a joint middle-high school. Important local products include persimmons as well as anchovies, seaweed, and squid. Oedong-eup (No.10) is linked by road and rail to the neighboring metropolis of Ulsan.

Despite having little interest in football, he worked on Roy of the Rovers, including drawing the character's final appearance in 1995. This led to David Bishop's commissioning him to work on Shimura in the Judge Dredd Megazine, where he first collaborated with Robbie Morrison. The pair then created Nikolai Dante, a swashbuckling adventure story set amid dynastic intrigue in a future Russia, which debuted in 2000 AD in 1997. Fraser was the main artist on the strip, occasionally rotating with other artists, until 2002; the primary artist since then has been John M. Burns, although Fraser returned to the character in 2006 for the storyline \\"Sword of the Tsar\\". Also for 2000 AD, Fraser has drawn a number of Judge Dredd stories. Returning to the Judge Dredd Megazine in 2003, he collaborated with writer Rob Williams on Family, a black and white series about a crime family with superhuman powers, which has recently been published as a collected edition. In 2005 he drew a four-part adaptation of Richard Matheson's Hell House, scripted by Ian Edginton and published by IDW Publishing. Fraser produced art on The Adventures of Nikolai Dante for 2000 AD, and the self-penned Lilly MacKenzie and the Mines of Charybdis which was published online, a page per week (every Friday) as part of the online comics collective Act-i-vate.Simon Frazer: Moving to the Web , Newsarama, February 12, 2007 In 2015, he started drawing covers for the horror comic, Tales of the Night Watchman, published by So What? Press. In 2018, he drew the sequential art for \\"The Ghost Train\\", about the elevated train involved in the infamous Malbone Street Wreck returning to terrorize the city on the centenary of the accident, which kicked off Tales of the Night Watchman's run as a newspaper strip in Brooklyn, New York's Park Slope Reader. The story debuted in the paper's Spring 2018 edition, number 64. The strips were colored by Gary Caldwell, Simon Fraser's frequent collaborator. They began working on \\"The Ghost Train\\" as soon as they wrapped up their collaboration on Mark Millar's Kingsman (franchise) comic book sequel, \\"The Red Circle\\", for Image Comics. ==Accolades== In 2018, Fraser received a Ringo Award nomination for best cover artist for his work on Tales of the Night Watchman, Kingsman, and The Consultant. ==Bibliography== Nikolai Dante on the cover of 2000 AD, drawn by Simon Fraser.

A finger joint, also known as a comb joint, is a woodworking joint made by cutting a set of complementary, interlocking profiles in two pieces of wood, which are then glued. The cross-section of the joint resembles the interlocking of fingers between two hands, hence the name \\"finger joint\\". The sides of each profile increases the surface area for gluing, resulting in a strong bond, stronger than a butt joint but not very visually appealing. Finger joints are regularly confused with box joints, which are used for corners of boxes or box-like constructions. ==Creation== Finger joints are generally created by using identical profiles for both pieces. They are made complementary by rotation or translation of the tool with respect to the workpiece. Typically a finger router bit is used, but spindle moulders can also be used. Manual cutting of finger joints is time-consuming and error prone hence rarely done except in craft pieces. ==Applications== A tapered or scarfed finger joint is the most common joint used to form long pieces of lumber from solid boards; the result is finger-jointed lumber. The finger joint can also be valuable when creating baseboards, moulding or trim, and can be used in such things as floor boards, and door construction. == See also == * Dovetail joint * Miter joint * Box joint * Lap joint ==References== https://www.nrcan.gc.ca/forests Category:Joinery de:Holzverbindung#Zinkung_und_Gratung ","title":"Finger joint"},{"id":"2213000","text":"The 1927–28 season was the 55th season of competitive football in Scotland and the 38th season of the Scottish Football League. == Scottish League Division One == Champions: Rangers Relegated: Boness United, Dunfermline Athletic == Scottish League Division Two == Promoted: Ayr United, Third Lanark == Scottish Cup == Rangers were winners of the Scottish Cup after a 4–0 win over the previous year's winners, Celtic. == Other Honours  National === {  style=\\"text-align: center;\\" - !width=160Competition !width=135Winner !width=80Score !width=135Runner-up - align=leftScottish Qualifying Cup Beith 3 – 1 Forres Mechanics } === County === {  style=\\"text-align: center;\\" - !width=160Competition !width=135Winner !width=80Score !width=135Runner-up - align=leftAberdeenshire Cup Aberdeen 8 – 3aggregate over two legs Fraserburgh - align=leftAyrshire Cup Kilmarnock   - align=leftDumbartonshire Cup Clydebank 4 – 2 * Dumbarton - align=leftEast of Scotland Shield Hibernian 2 – 1 * Hearts - align=leftFife Cup Cowdenbeath 2 – 1 Dunfermline Athletic - align=leftGlasgow Cup Celtic 2 – 1 Rangers - align=leftLanarkshire Cup Motherwell 4 – 1 Airdrie - align=leftPerthshire Cup St Johnstone 3 – 0 Vale of Atholl - align=leftSouthern Counties Cup Nithsdale Wanderers 8 – 0 Newton Stewart - align=leftStirlingshire Cup East Stirling 1 – 0 Bo'ness } . * replay === Highland League = Junior Cup == Maryhill Hibs were winners of the Junior Cup after a 6–2 win over Burnbank Athletic in the final. == Scotland national team == {  !Date !Venue !Opponents ! !Competition !Scotland scorer(s) -bgcolor=#ffffdd 29 October 1927 Racecourse Ground, Wrexham (A)  align=center2–2 BHC Hugh Gallacher, John Hutton (pen.) -bgcolor=#ffdddd 25 February 1928 Firhill, Glasgow (H)  align=center0–1 BHC  -bgcolor=#ddffdd 31 March 1928 Wembley, London (A)  align=center5–1 BHC Alex Jackson (3), Alex James (2) } Key: == Notes and references  External links == * Scottish Football Historical Archive Category:Seasons in Scottish football ","title":"1927–28 in Scottish football"},{"id":"2213009","text":"John Habberton John Habberton (February 24, 1842 – February 24, 1921) was an American author and journalist. ==Biography== He was born at Brooklyn, New York, and educated in the public schools of Illinois, where he went to live with an uncle after his father died when he was six years old. He served in the army during the Civil War. After the war, he got a job with Harper & Brothers, where he stayed until 1872. After an unsuccessful attempt to become a publisher himself, in 1873 he became literary editor of the Christian Union (later called the Outlook), where he remained until 1877. From 1876 to 1893, he was literary critic on the staff of the New York Herald. ==Helen's Babies== Habberton's first major work of fiction was Helen's Babies, based on his sons' adventures (published in 1876 by Loring Publisher, Boston, in 1877 by David Byce and Son, Glasgow and in 1878 by William Mullan, London. It was revived in the early 20th century by George Routledge and Sons, London). The work was initially rejected, but finally published anonymously. Later the author's identity was revealed. The novel is subtitled With some account of their ways: innocent, droll, fascinating, roguish, mischievous, and naughty... By their latest victim, Uncle Harry.XIX Century Fiction, Part I: A–K, Jarndyce, Bloomsbury, 2019. The book was one of the Ruby Books series for boys and girls. Habberton is acknowledged as the author of the book in an advertisement within the 1903 edition of Andersen's Fairy Tales published by Routledge. Habberton is acknowledged, also, in an inexpensive cardboard-back edition of Helen's Babies published by (and copyrighted by) Whitman Publishing Company of Racine, Wisconsin in 1934. That edition is copiously illustrated by Pauline Adams. Helen's Babies was intended as just a piece of humour and aimed at an adult audience, but it almost instantly became a major juvenile literature success, highly estimated by youngsters, as well as authorities like Rudyard Kipling. Its popularity dwindled somewhat after World War II (although George Orwell mentions it favorably in his 1946 essay on early American literature, Riding Down from Bangor). It regained some interest in the 1980s. It was translated into numerous foreign languages and was adapted into a 1924 film of the same name, directed by William A. Seiter. ==Other work== Habberton is also known for his stories about early California life, many of which were collected in his 1880 book Romance of California Life: Illustrated by Pacific Slope Stories, Thrilling, Pathetic and Humorous (New York: Baker, Pratt & Co., 1880). He was also known under the pseudonym \\"Smelfungus.\\"Cushing, William, Initials and Pseudonyms: A Dictionary of Literary Disguises. ==Personal life== In 1868, he married Alice Lawrence Hastings, who later suggested recording his sons' adventures. ==Partial bibliography== *All He Knew *Helen's Babies (1876) *The Annals of a Baby, by One of Its Slaves (1877) *He and I, by the author of \\"Annals of a Baby\\" (1877) *The Barton Experiment, by the author of \\"Helen's Babies\\" (1877) *The Jericho Road; A Story of Western Life (1877) *Romance of California Life: Illustrated by Pacific Slope Stories, Thrilling, Pathetic and Humorous (1880) *The Worst Boy in Town (1880) *Helen's Babies and Mrs. Mayburns Twins (1881) *Canoeing in Kanuckia *Other People's Children (1877) *Country Luck (1887) *The Scripture Club of Valley Rest *The Barton Experiment *Trif and Trixie: a story of a dreadfully delightful little girl and her adoring and tormented parents, relations, and friends - copyright 1897- Published by Henry Altemus *Caleb Wright; A Story of the West (1901) ==References* Category:1842 births Category:1921 deaths Category:19th-century American novelists Category:American male novelists Category:Pseudonymous writers Category:19th-century American male writers ","title":"John Habberton"},{"id":"2213011","text":"Runner's World is a globally circulated monthly magazine for runners of all skills sets, published by Hearst in Easton, Pennsylvania, in the United States. ==Beginnings== Runner's World was originally launched in 1966 by Bob Anderson as Distance Running News, and Anderson published the magazine by himself for several years from his home in Manhattan, Kansas. Runner and writer Hal Higdon had been writing for the magazine since the beginning (2nd edition). In 1969, Anderson changed the name of the magazine to Runner's World. He brought on Joe Henderson as chief editor and moved the editorial offices, now named World Publications, to Mountain View, California. Runner's World thrived during the 1970s \\"running boom\\", even in the face of competition from the New York-based magazine, The Runner. ==Purchased by Rodale Press== In the early 1980s, Bob Anderson sold a good portion of his publications, including Runner's World. Some of Anderson's books went out of print while others were distributed by Macmillan Publishing. Robert Rodale of Rodale Inc., purchased Runner's World in 1985 and the editorial offices moved to Rodale's base in Emmaus, Pennsylvania. Joe Henderson did not move to Emmaus, and stepped down as editor, though he remained associated with the magazine until 2003. Random House bought the running log, which was published under the Runner's World name for decades after the sale. In 1986 Rodale bought The Runner,Advertising magazines for runners to merge at Rodale, The New York Times, 15 Jan 1987 and merged the two magazines, keeping the Runner's World name and some writers, including Amby Burfoot who became the editor (a post he held until 2003). Runner's World remained strong through the so-called \\"second running boom\\" in the late 1990s. In 2004, the magazine had a full redesign. Since then, the magazine has won several awards including being ranked #1 on Adweek's Hot List, #6 on Advertising Age's \\"A-List\\"; been recognized for having the \\"Creative Team of the Year\\", and most notably has been nominated three times for National Magazine Awards. Also, since the redesign, the magazine's circulation has increased from 525,000 to 650,000 at a time when most consumer magazines' circulations have declined, and advertising pages and revenue remain at an all time high. The publisher of Runner's World's United States' edition is Molly O'Keefe and its editor is David Willey. In February 2007, Rodale acquired Running Times magazine with the objective of getting the magazine back on its original mission to serve the front of the pack. Hearst acquired Rodale in 2018. Runner's World offices were moved from Emmaus, Pennsylvania to Easton, Pennsylvania. ==International circulation== Since the early 1990s, Runner's World has expanded outside the United States, currently with 18 international editions. The first was a United Kingdom edition wholly owned by NatMag Rodale, a joint venture between Rodale Inc. and The Hearst Corporation in the UK. Editions in Argentina, Australia/New Zealand, Belgium, Brazil, China, Colombia, France, Germany, Italy, Mexico, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, and Turkey are published either as joint ventures or through licensing arrangements with publishers in those countries. Editors in each country have access to editorial content from the U.S. edition, but also publish their own original content with local flavor. ==See also== *Bob Anderson *John Bingham *Browning Ross ==References * Category:Lifestyle magazines published in the United States Category:Sports magazines published in the United States Category:Magazines published in Pennsylvania Category:Monthly magazines published in the United States Category:Magazines established in 1966 Category:Rodale, Inc.

In 1896 Whitman entered his first U.S. National Championships at the Newport Casino and lost in the quarterfinals to Bill Larned. The following year, 1897, he again lost in the quarterfinals, this time against Harold Nisbet. Whitman is best known for this hat-trick of singles titles at the U.S. National Championships. Between 1898 and 1900, he stayed undefeated there. In 1901 he did not compete and in the 1902 Championships he lost in the All-Comers final to Englishman Reginald Doherty. According to the Doherty brothers Malcolm Whitman and Bill Larned were at the time the best American singles players. He played on the inaugural American Davis Cup squad in 1900 and beat Englishman Arthur Gore in Boston, MA to help his US team win the trophy. In the 1902 Davis Cup final against Great Britain in Brooklyn, NY he again contributed to his team's win by defeating Joshua Pim and Reginald Doherty in the singles. Whitman retired from tennis in 1902 at the age of 25. He was a member of the Executive Committee of the U.S. National Lawn Tennis Association (USNLTA) and held management positions in several companies.

Retrieved 18 September 2020 ==CareerEarly career=== Melandri was born in Ravenna. He was introduced to racing by a former rider Loris Reggiani at the age of six. He came through the ranks from minibikes, motocross and then the Italian and European 125cc championship. In 1997, Melandri won the Italian 125cc championship, also finishing 4th in European 125cc championship. In addition to his European success, he made his debut in 125cc world championship at Brno, Czech Republic as a wild card rider. ===125cc World Championship=== After impressing in Italian and European championship in 1997, Melandri finally got his chance to compete in 1998 125cc world championship as a regular. He rode Honda 125cc bike under Benetton Honda Team. He went on to impress many as he earned his first podium in the fourth race of the season, where he finished second in his home Grand Prix at Mugello, Italy. His brilliant debut season continued when he won his first grand prix at Assen TT, Netherlands. He won this race at the age of 15 years and 324 days which made him the youngest ever Grand Prix winner, at the time. Overall, he won two Grand Prix in his debut season and therefore he finished the season at 3rd position in overall standings behind champion Kazuto Sakata and runner-up Tomomi Manako. He remained on the same bike and team in 1999, where he bid to win the 125cc world championship. He went on to win 5 Grand Prix but failed to win the championship, finishing second behind Emilio Alzamora with just a single point difference. Failure in securing his first world championship did not stop his rise to 250cc world championship in 2000. ===250cc World Championship=== Melandri was signed by Aprilia in 2000 to replace another Italian Valentino Rossi who left the team and 250cc class for 500cc class. He was highly expected to take over Rossi's shoes and to win the 250cc world championship. However, his debut season did not start as well as the expectation. He struggled to adapt to bigger bike and higher competition. He failed to win any Grand Prix in 2000, managing only 4 podiums, all came late in the season. Despite these problems, he still finishes the season at 5th position overall. In 2001, his performances were improving. He managed to win his first 250cc Grand Prix at Sachsenring, Germany. However, it was his only win in 2001. Despite managing to appear on the podium on 9 occasions, he never really challenged for the championship. He finished the season in 3rd position behind champion Daijiro Kato and runner-up Tetsuya Harada. 2002 proved to be Melandri's chance to shine. With 2001 champion and runner-up, Kato and Harada moved to MotoGP class, he became the strongest contender for the championship. He dominated the season by collecting 9 wins and 3 additional podiums. After challenging for world championship for years, he finally won the 250cc world title. He became the youngest 250cc world champion at the age of 20 years and 74 days until Dani Pedrosa broke his record in 2004. ===MotoGP World Championship=== After securing the 250cc world title in 2002, Melandri moved up to MotoGP class to spearhead Yamaha factory team alongside Carlos Checa in 2003 replacing the departing Max Biaggi. The Yamaha was less competitive than Honda and Ducati, and although Melandri at times showed good speed, he struggled to turn this into good results. He finished the season in fifteenth position without collecting any wins or podiums. He joined Yamaha's satellite team, Tech 3 in 2004 alongside Norick Abe in order to make way for the incoming Valentino Rossi. This season, he again struggled to get top results. Although he managed to collect two consecutive podiums, a series of crashes and retirements kept him out of the top 10 in overall standings. He finished the season in twelfth position. Released from his Yamaha contract after the 2004 season, Melandri was the surprise choice of boss Fausto Gresini to join Sete Gibernau in the Movistar Honda team for the 2005 MotoGP campaign. Melandri was successful with Movistar Honda in 2005, with a consistent run of podium finishes early in the season, ultimately taking his first two wins in the final two races of 2005 to clinch second place in the championship. In doing so, he was the first Honda rider to win back-to-back races for nearly two years, winning the final two rounds of the MotoGP Championship at Istanbul and in Valencia. Although he never really challenged his best friend Valentino Rossi for the title, he finished the season strongly as runner-up, with a total of two wins and five other podiums. Melandri rode for Gresini's Fortuna Honda team alongside Toni Elías in the 2006 season. With Rossi struggling to find consistency, he was a major challenger, along with Ducati's Loris Capirossi and Honda riders Nicky Hayden and Dani Pedrosa. He again won at Istanbul, despite starting from fourteenth on the grid. He managed further wins at Le Mans, France and Phillip Island, Australia. He finished the season in fourth position, just one point behind Capirossi. 2007 Australian Grand Prix In 2007, Melandri and Elias remained in the Honda Gresini team, now sponsored by Hannspree. Honda's 800cc machine was not competitive. Melandri finished on the podium at Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca and Le Mans – at this point he and works rider Dani Pedrosa were the only Honda riders with multiple podiums. He ultimately finished fifth overall, second only to Pedrosa among the Honda riders. Immediately after Melandri's 3rd-place finish in the 2007 USA's MotoGP round, Ducati announced that he would join its factory team alongside Casey Stoner for 2008 and 2009. But 2008 proved disastrous, with a run of uncompetitive runs often leaving him behind the semi-works Alice Team bikes of Toni Elías and Sylvain Guintoli. At Assen he qualified last and ran there throughout. A rumoured mid-season move to Kawasaki did not occur, however Melandri announced that he would be joining Kawasaki Racing Team for the 2009 MotoGP season to ride alongside his new teammate John Hopkins on 19 August. He then ended the season in a lacklustre 17th position. 2009 British Grand Prix. Kawasaki pulled its factory involvement for 2009, leading to fears that Melandri would not have a ride, however a rescue package was agreed to allow Melandri to run the bike for a one-bike semi-works Hayate Racing team, despite his concerns over the bike's poor rear traction. In 2009 Melandri achieved his first podium since 2007 with his 2nd-place finish at the wet French motorcycle Grand Prix. His only other top six finishes were in the first three races, as the team tailed off bike development and Melandri finished tenth overall. At Brno he battled Mika Kallio for sixth before a penultimate-lap collision between the two. For 2010, Melandri returned to Gresini Honda, with a factory-spec RC212V bike from the start. Full factory support had sometimes been promised, but not provided, during his first Gresini spell. The team made set-up errors in its initial testing. ===Superbike World Championship=== Melandri moved to the Superbike World Championship from 2011 with the Yamaha World Superbike Team, replacing Cal Crutchlow, who moved to the Tech 3 team in MotoGP. On 2 October 2011, Melandri signed a contract to ride with the BMW World Superbike team for the 2012 season, after Yamaha elected not to continue with a factory team after the 2011 season. Melandri achieved BMW's best result, at the time, in the Superbike World Championship, with a second place in the season-opening race at Phillip Island, having started 13th on the grid. Mixed results followed at Imola, Assen and Monza, but Melandri achieved BMW's first Superbike World Championship victory at the European round at Donington Park, leading home teammate Leon Haslam in a 1–2 finish. Melandri and Haslam collided in the meeting's second race, denying a weekend sweep for BMW. From that point, Melandri won races at Miller Motorsports Park, Motorland Aragón and a double at Brno, to move within 21 points of the championship lead held by Max Biaggi. On 16 July 2020, it was announced that Melandri would replace Leon Camier at the Barni Ducati Racing Team for the remainder of the season 2020. Camier was not recovered from a shoulder injury during winter testing at Motorland Aragon after fracturing his shoulder and wrist. In September 2020, another retirement announcement was made midway through the season, due to Melandri's disappointing results and the hope of the Barni team finding better WSBK success with their younger rider Samuele Cavalieri, promoted from their entry in the Italian national CIV Superstock race class. ===Return to MotoGP=== In November 2014, it was announced that Melandri would return to Gresini, Aprilia's factory team for the 2015 season. However, after failing to score a point in the first eight races of the season, Melandri left the team and was replaced by Michael Laverty and then by Stefan Bradl. ===Car racing=== In addition to his motorcycle racing career, Melandri has also competed in car racing. He raced in two rounds of the 2008-09 Speedcar Series season, scoring two points from the four races. ==Career statisticsGrand Prix motorcycle racing=== By season { !Season !Class !Motorcycle !Team !Race !Win !Podium !Pole !FLap !Pts !Plcd !WCh - align=\\"right\\" !  125cc  Honda RS125R   1  0  0  0  0  0  NC  – - align=\\"right\\" !  125cc  Honda RS125R  Benetton Matteoni  14  2  8  3  1  202 !ffdf9f;\\" 3rd  – - align=\\"right\\" !  125cc  Honda RS125R  Benetton Playlife  14  5  9  3  4  226 !dfdfdf;\\" 2nd  – - align=\\"right\\" !  250cc  Aprilia RSV250  Blu Aprilia Team  16  0  4  1  0  159  5th  – - align=\\"right\\" !  250cc  Aprilia RSV250  MS Aprilia Racing  15  1  9  0  4  194 !ffdf9f;\\" 3rd  – - align=\\"right\\" !  250cc  Aprilia RSV250  MS Aprilia Racing  16  9  12  2  4  298 !ffffbf;\\" 1st  1 - align=\\"right\\" !

Established in 1873, the club became members of the Football League in 1893 and remained members of the Second Division until 1912, making Gainsborough one of the smallest towns in England to have had a Football League team. They are currently members of and play at the Northolme. ==History== The club was established in 1873 as Trinity Recreationists by Reverend George Langton Hodgkinson, the vicar at the Holy Trinity Church.Club History Gainsborough Trinity FC In 1889 the club were founder members of the Midland League, which they won in 1890–91. The club finished as runners-up the following season and again in 1895–96, after which they applied for election to the Football League. In the vote they finished third, ahead of existing members Port Vale and Crewe Alexandra, and were elected into the Second Division.Dave Twydell (2001) Denied F.C.: The Football League Election Struggles, p12, The club's first season in Division Two of the League saw them finish seventh, but a gradual decline in form saw them finish in the bottom half of the table every season until 1904. In 1901–02 Trinity finished bottom of the division, but were re-elected.Twydell, p13 In 1904–05 the club finished sixth in Division Two, their best performance during their Football League membership. In 1911–12 Gainsborough finished bottom of the Second Division for a second time, and failed to be re-elected, receiving just nine votes to the 27 received by newly elected Lincoln City.Twydell, p14 The club returned to the Midland League, finishing third in 1912–13 and second in 1913–14, after which they unsuccessfully applied for readmission to the Football League. When the Football League created a new Third Division North in 1921, Trinity applied for membership, but were again unsuccessful.Twydell, p15 The club won the Midland League title in 1927–28, and the following season defeated Football League opposition in the FA Cup for the first time since losing their League status, beating Crewe 3–1 in the first round, before losing to Chesterfield in the second round. In 1931–32 they beat Crewe again in the first round, before losing 5–2 at home to Watford. In 1937–38 Trinity beat Port Vale in the first round, before losing to fellow non-League club Yeovil & Petters United. Another Football League team was beaten the following season, when Trinity knocked out Gateshead in the first round, before losing to Doncaster Rovers. Following World War II Gainsborough had further success in the FA Cup, reaching the first round of the FA Cup in 1945–46, losing to Mansfield Town, and in 1946–47, when they were beaten by Darlington. In 1948–49 they reached the second round after defeating Witton Albion in the first round, before losing 4–3 at Walsall. They went on to win a third Midland League title that season. First round appearances in the FA Cup followed in 1950–51 (losing 3–0 to Plymouth) and 1951–52 (losing to Witton), before the 1952–53 season saw another second round appearance; after beating Netherfield in a first round replay, they lost 2–1 at Newport County. They reached the first round again the following season, before losing 4–1 at home to Chesterfield. The club failed to repeat the feat until 1959–60, when they lost to Doncaster Rovers in a replay. At the end of the 1959–60 season, the Midland League was disbanded. Gainsborough spent a single season playing in both the Central Alliance and Division Two of the Yorkshire League,The Central Alliance, 1947–1962 Non- League Matters before returning to a reformed Midland League in 1961. Trinity won their fourth Midland League title in 1966–67, also reaching the first round of the FA Cup (losing 1–0 at home to Colchester United), before becoming founder members of the new Northern Premier League in 1968. The club applied to join the Football League again in 1975 and 1976, but received only a single vote on each occasion. The 1983–84 season saw them reach the first round of the FA Cup for over a decade, as they lost 2–0 at home to Blackpool. When the Northern Premier League added a second division in 1987, Gainsborough were placed in the Premier Division. In 1997–98 FA Cup saw them drawn against local rivals Lincoln City, who after a 1-1 draw lost 3–2 in a 'home' replay that was played at Lincoln's Sincil Bank. Another first round appearance in 2003–04 ended with a 7–1 defeat at Brentford. At the end of the season a tenth-place finish saw the club become founder members of the Conference North. FA Cup first round appearances followed in 2006–07 (a 3–1 defeat by Barnet) and 2007–08 (a 6–0 loss at home to Hartlepool United). In 2011–12 the club finished fourth, qualifying for the promotion play-offs. However, after beating Halifax Town in the semi-finals, Trinity lost the final 1–0 to Nuneaton Town. In another FA Cup first round appearance in 2015–16, the club were beaten 1–0 by Shrewsbury Town. The club were relegated for the first time in their history at the end of the 2017–18 season, dropping into the Northern Premier League's Premier Division. ==Ground== The Northolme Trinity moved to the Northolme ground, then also a cricket venue, in 1884.Paul Smith & Shirley Smith (2005) The Ultimate Directory of English & Scottish Football League Grounds Second Edition 1888–2005, Yore Publications, p92, During their time in the Football League the club also played home matches at the Bowling Green Ground in the north-west of the town and Sincil Bank in Lincoln when the Northolme was being used for cricket. The record attendance of 9,760 was set for a Midland League match against local rivals Scunthorpe United in 1948. ==Rivals and local games== Gainsborough Trinity's location on the bank of the River Trent pits them against a host of clubs from Lincolnshire and Nottinghamshire. The most noted local derbys for Gainsborough are against Boston United and Worksop Town, as both clubs have spent numerous seasons in both the Northern Premier League and Conference North divisions with Trinity. Games with Boston or Worksop are traditionally played on Boxing Day and New Year's Day. Professional clubs in traditional Lincolnshire such as Lincoln City, Scunthorpe United and Grimsby Town have rarely played Trinity outside of pre-season tournaments such as the Lincolnshire Senior Cup. The last competitive match between Trinity and a professional Lincolnshire club was when they played Lincoln City in the first round of the FA Cup in the 1996–97 season, with Trinity eventually losing 3–2 in the replay following a 1–1 draw at Sincil Bank. ==Club officials== *Chairman: Richard Kane *Club secretary: Matt Boles *Manager: Curtis Woodhouse *Assistant Manager: Martin Foster *Youth Football Development Manager: Peter Wallace *Physio: Jonathan Whitehorne *Community Head of Operations & Business Development : Damon Parkinson *Head of Community: Daniel Howarth ==Current squad== Players Gainsborough Trinity F.C. ==Managerial history== { class= style=text-align:center !

The work can be dated from 375 to 380 AD. The provenance is usually regarded as Syria, probably Antioch. The author is unknown, even if since James Ussher it was considered to be the same author of the letters of Pseudo-Ignatius, perhaps the 4th-century Eunomian bishop Julian of Cilicia. ==Content== The Apostolic Constitutions contains eight treatises on Early Christian discipline, worship, and doctrine, intended to serve as a manual of guidance for the clergy, and to some extent for the laity. It purports to be the work of the Twelve Apostles, whose instructions, whether given by them as individuals or as a body. The structure of the Apostolic Constitutions can be summarized: * Books 1 to 6 are a free re-wording of the Didascalia Apostolorum * Book 7 is partially based on the Didache. Chapters 33-45 of book 7 contain prayers similar to Jewish prayers used in synagogues. * Book 8 is composed as follows: ** chapters 1-2 contain an extract of a lost treatise on the charismata ** chapters 3-46 are based on the Apostolic Tradition, greatly expanded, along with other material ** chapter 47 is known as the Canons of the Apostles and it had a wider circulation than the rest of the book. The best manuscriptVatican gr 1506 has Arian leanings, which are not found in other manuscripts because this material would have been censured as heretical. The Apostolic Constitutions is an important source for the history of the liturgy in the Antiochene rite. It contains an outline of an anaphora in book two, a full anaphora in book seven (which is an expansion of the one found in the Didache), and the complete Liturgy of the eighth book of the Apostolic Constitutions, which is the oldest known form that can be described as a complete divine liturgy. ==Influence== In antiquity, the Apostolic Constitutions were mistakenly supposed to be gathered and handed down by Clement of Rome, the authority of whose name gave weight to more than one such piece of early Christian literature (see also Clementine literature). The Church seems never to have regarded this work as of undoubted Apostolic authority. The Apostolic Constitutions were rejected as canonical by the Decretum Gelasianum. The Quinisext Council in 692 rejected most part of the work on account of the interpolations of heretics. Only that portion of it to which has been given the name Canons of the Apostles was received in the Eastern Christianity. Even if not regarded as of certain Apostolic origin, however, in antiquity the Apostolic Constitutions were held generally in high esteem and served as the basis for much ecclesiastical legislation. The Apostolic Constitutions were accepted as canonical by John of Damascus and, in a modified form, included in the 81 book canon of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church. Even if the text of the Apostolic Constitutions was extant in many libraries during the Middle Age, it was almost unknown. In 1546 a Latin version of a text was found in Crete and published. The first complete edition of the Greek text was printed in 1563 by Turrianus. William Whiston in the 18th century devoted the third volume of his Primitive Christianity Revived to prove that \\"they are the most sacred of the canonical books of the New Testament; \\"for \\"these sacred Christian laws or constitutions were delivered at Jerusalem, and in Mount Sion, by our Saviour to the eleven apostles there assembled after His resurrection.\\" Today the Apostolic Constitutions are of the highest value as a historical document, as they reveal the moral and religious conditions, as well as the liturgical observances of 3rd and 4th centuries. They are part of the Ante-Nicene Fathers collection. ==Canons of the Apostles== The forty-seventh and last chapter of the eighth book of the Apostolic Constitutions contains the eighty-five Canons of the Apostles, which present themselves as being from an apostolic Council at Antioch. These canons were later approved by the Eastern Council in Trullo in 692 but rejected by Pope Constantine. In the Western Church only fifty of these canons circulated, translated to Latin by Dionysius Exiguus on about 500 AD, and included in the Western collections and afterwards in the Corpus Juris Canonici. Canon n. 85 is a list of canonical books: a 46-book Old Testament canon which essentially corresponds to that of the Septuagint, 26 books of what is now the New Testament (excludes Revelation), two Epistles of Clement, and the Apostolic Constitutions themselves, also here attributed to Clement, at least as compiler. ==Epitome of the eighth book == It is also known as the Epitome, and usually named Epitome of the eighth Book of the Apostolic Constitutions (or sometime titled The Constitutions of the Holy Apostles concerning ordination through Hippolytus or simply The Constitutions through Hippolytus) containing a re-wording of chapters 1-2, 4-5, 16-28, 30-34, 45-46 of the eighth book. The text was first published by Paul de Lagarde in 1856 and later by Franz Xaver von Funk in 1905. This epitome could be a later extract even if in parts it looks nearer to the Greek original of the Apostolic Tradition, from which the 8th book is derived, than the Apostolic Constitutions themselves. ==See also== * Apostolic Church-Ordinance * Alexandrine Sinodos * Jus antiquum * Verona Palimpsest ==Notes * Apostolic Constitutions: online English text from the Ante-Nicene Fathers * Jewish Encyclopedia: Didascalia * This contains a more detailed exegesis of the writings and their possible authorship. * Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge: Apostolic Constitutions and Canons Category:Ancient Church Orders Category:4th-century books Category:4th-century Christian texts Category:Christian terminology Category:Canon law codifications Category:Works of unknown authorship ","title":"Apostolic Constitutions"},{"id":"2213062","text":"The Riemvasmaak United Party was a political party in Namibia.

The band is currently composed of Matthew Tuck (lead vocals, rhythm guitar), Michael Paget (lead guitar, backing vocals), Jason Bowld (drums) and Jamie Mathias (bass guitar). Former members include Michael Thomas, Jason James and Nick Crandle; the latter were on bass. They were formed under the name Jeff Killed John and started their music career by covering songs by Metallica and Nirvana. Jeff Killed John recorded six songs which were not released; two of these tracks were reworked later in their career as Bullet for My Valentine. A change of style from that of Jeff Killed John led the band to change their name. In 2002, the band secured a five-album deal with Sony BMG. The band has stated that their music is influenced by classic metal acts such as Metallica, Iron Maiden and Slayer. The band is part of the Cardiff music scene. Bullet for My Valentine's debut album The Poison was released on 3 October 2005 in the United Kingdom and on 14 February 2006 in the United States to coincide with Valentine's Day, in a nod to the band's name. The album entered the U.S. Billboard 200 at number 128. It was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America. The band made appearances at the Download Festival and Kerrang! XXV, and undertook a U.S. tour with Rob Zombie. Bullet for My Valentine's second studio album, Scream Aim Fire, was released on 29 January 2008 and debuted at number four on the Billboard 200. The band's third album, Fever, was released on 26 April 2010 and debuted at number three on the Billboard 200. On 8 February 2013, the band released their fourth studio album, Temper Temper, which peaked at number 13 on the Billboard 200. On 14 August 2015, the band released their fifth studio album, Venom, which peaked at number 8 on the Billboard 200. On 29 June 2018, the band released their sixth studio album, Gravity. The band has sold over one million albums in the United States and over 3,000,000 albums worldwide and are the most-successful act in the Kerrang! Awards category of \\"Best British Band\\" with three wins. ==HistoryJeff Killed John and record deal (1998–2005)=== Jeff Killed John was the forerunner band to Bullet for My Valentine and was formed in 1998 by Matthew Tuck, Michael \\"Padge\\" Paget, Nick Crandle, and Michael \\"Moose\\" Thomas while studying music at Bridgend College. They started playing Nirvana and Metallica cover songs. In 1999, the band released their first ever EP, Better Off Alone. They released another two-track EP in 2002, You/Play with Me, which was produced by Greg Haver. The EP was financed through the Pynci scheme for new Welsh musicians and the release garnered radio airplay on BBC Radio 1's broadcast at Newport's T.J.'s. Jeff Killed John's music followed the nu metal trend set by bands such as Korn and Limp Bizkit. Shortly after, the band released another two-track EP titled Eye Spy. In 2003, their second EP was released titled Don't Walk Away. This was a promotional CD and was shipped to different record companies, as well as being given out locally in Bridgend. Bassist Crandle left the band on the eve of entering the recording sessions for the band's self-titled EP and was replaced by Jason James. The band then changed their name to Bullet for My Valentine and reworked their musical strategy; they decided to play heavy metal songs with \\"harmony guitars and big angelic choruses,\\" according to frontman Tuck. In late 2003, they released their final EP before record labels actually began to notice their potential. This happened due to the sudden change in their strategy and sound, which the band claims came \\"directly out of their heads.\\" Their self-titled EP consisted of five songs; most of the songs became precursors of tracks from The Poison. Roadrunner Records showed interest in Bullet for My Valentine and offered the band a deal. The offer was ultimately turned down, and the band signed a five- album record deal with Sony BMG and a UK licensing deal with Visible Noise. According to Tuck, they chose Sony because, \\"We thought that a lot more doors would be open to us.\\" A self-titled EP was released on 15 November 2004 in the UK. Produced by Colin Richardson, it featured five tracks and marked the band's first official release. A second EP, Hand of Blood, was released on 22 August 2005 through Trustkill Records and was only available in the U.S.; the release contained one extra track than the self-titled EP, \\"4 Words (To Choke Upon).\\" Daniel Lukes of Decibel Magazine reviewed the EP by stating, \\"The worst part is that the music itself isn’t all that bad, for the genre.\\" He went on to comment that the band should be \\"embarrassed\\" about the release. Zero Magazine's Josh Joyce complimented the band on \\"how technical they can get without confusing the kids.\\" ===The Poison (2005–07)=== Michael Paget (left) and Matthew Tuck (right) at 2006's Roskilde Festival held in Denmark Bullet for My Valentine's debut album, The Poison, was released on 3 October 2005 in the UK and on Valentine's Day 2006 in the US. It entered the Billboard 200 at number 128, and attained number 11 on the Independent Albums chart. On 30 January 2009, the album was certified gold by the RIAA after 500,000 copies were sold in the US. Four singles were released from The Poison: \\"4 Words (To Choke Upon)\\", \\"Suffocating Under Words of Sorrow (What Can I Do)\\", \\"All These Things I Hate (Revolve Around Me)\\", and \\"Tears Don't Fall\\". Bullet for My Valentine promoted the album by touring across the world. In 2005, with increased popularity, they played on the larger Download Festival Snickers stage; in 2006, the band were moved to near the top of the main stage bill. Other tours included opening for Metallica and Guns N' Roses in the summer of 2006, the Vans Warped Tour and Earthday Birthday. The band's headline performance at Kerrang XXV, a one-off gig at Brixton Academy in London on 28 January 2006, was filmed for their first DVD, The Poison: Live at Brixton. During June 2007, Tuck suffered from laryngitis, which led to an emergency tonsillectomy in July. Bullet for My Valentine were forced to cancel several shows, including supporting Metallica for three dates on their Sick of the Studio '07 tour on 29 June in Bilbao, 5 July in Vienna, and 8 July at the recently completed Wembley Stadium in London. Unable to speak, Tuck wrote that as soon as doctors cleared him he would be in the studio working on the band's next album. ===Scream Aim Fire (2007–08)=== The band's second studio album, Scream Aim Fire, was recorded at Sonic Ranch Studios and was produced by Colin Richardson. Tuck commented at the time, \\"It's a lot more up tempo, a lot more aggressive.\\" The album was released in the U.S. on 29 January 2008. It sold 53,000 copies in its first week and peaked at number four on the Billboard 200. Three songs were released as singles: \\"Scream Aim Fire,\\" \\"Hearts Burst into Fire\\" and \\"Waking the Demon.\\" In support of the new album, the band toured North America and Australia in the spring of 2008 for the Taste of Chaos tour alongside Atreyu, Blessthefall and Avenged Sevenfold. Bullet for My Valentine cut short the Canada portion of the tour and flew back home to support the daughter of James who was in hospital. The band performed in North America again in the summer of 2008 as part of the No Fear Tour with Bleeding Through, Cancer Bats and Black Tide. In late 2008, the band toured Europe, supported by Lacuna Coil, Bleeding Through, and Black Tide. In December 2008, Scream Aim Fire was re-released with four bonus tracks that were recorded during the album's studio sessions, but with re-recorded vocal-lines. ===Fever (2009–11)=== Bullet for My Valentine performing live at Norway Rock Festival 2010 Matt Tuck spoke to Daniel Marez of Metal Hammer in March 2009 about the band's progress on writing and recording their third album. Tuck stated that there were four or five songs that were finished and that \\"usually we write and record 14 tracks that I then have to write vocal lines for, but this time I’m trying to write the vocals as I write the music.\\" Bullet for My Valentine confirmed in August 2009 that they were aiming for an early 2010 release for the new album, while Tuck stated that the upcoming record is \\"a lot more mature-sounding, it's a lot more classic. It'll stand the test of time [more] than both the previous things we've done.\\" In a January 2010 interview with Rock Sound, Tuck stated explained details for the album: it would be titled Fever, and the 11-track record would have a sound closer to The Poison rather than Scream Aim Fire and contain no ballads.

On 12 March the band released the music videos for \\"The Last Fight\\" and \\"Your Betrayal.\\" The band revealed the track listing on their website on 15 March, as well as other various sources that include an email to all of their subscribers on the mailing list. On 26 April the band played a secret show in London to celebrate the release of Fever. This was their only UK headline show until the end of the year. ===Temper Temper (2012–13)=== On 28 January 2011, Michael Paget stated that the group had already drawn proportions for the next studio album and will sound a lot like Fever. He followed-along with stating that the band plans to have the songs for it written within 2011 and will begin recording the album by the end of the year. A couple tracks left from the Fever sessions might be re-done, re-arranged and re-recorded for the new record. The band played at Uproar Festival 2011, after which they began writing material for a fourth studio album. Bullet for My Valentine at Ursynalia 2013 Warsaw Student Festival, Poland. On 7 October, RCA Music Group announced it was disbanding Jive Records along with Arista Records and J Records. With the shutdown, the band (and all other artists previously signed to these three labels) will release their future material (including their next studio album) on the RCA Records brand. Also in October, frontman Matt Tuck announced that he will be working on a new side project which he has described as \\"metal as fuck\\", influenced by bands such as Pantera and Slipknot. On 1 May 2012 it was revealed that the project will be called AxeWound, and will feature Liam Cormier, Mike Kingswood, Joe Copcutt and Jason Bowld. In May 2012 it was announced that Bullet for My Valentine would be playing at the South African music festival Oppikoppi, as well as a once-off gig in Cape Town alongside Seether and Enter Shikari. They were slated to play in the country for the Coke Zero Fest of 2009, but pulled out at the last minute to record Fever. It was confirmed on 6 August that the final recording session of the band's fourth studio record was complete, and that the album would be out sometime in late 2012. Later that month on the 17th, the second line-up for the Australian music festival Soundwave was announced, containing Bullet for My Valentine. Bullet for My Valentine released the track \\"Temper Temper\\" on 25 November in the UK and 30 October worldwide across all digital providers. The song was debuted live by the band on Monday 22 October at BBC Radio 1's Rock Week where they performed at Maida Vale studios. It was announced the day prior to the performance that the band's fourth studio album would also be named Temper Temper. The release date was confirmed to be 12 February 2013. The band began touring in support of Temper Temper on 10 February 2013, and finished the tour on 3 November 2013. The tenth show of the tour, held at Birmingham's O2 Academy, was filmed by music video website Moshcam.com. ===Venom (2013–15)=== In an interview, Matt Tuck said that Bullet for My Valentine were going to start work on a new album before the Rule Britannia Tour, which took place between 1 and 6 December 2013 in which the band played arenas in Britain supported by Young Guns and Asking Alexandria. In the interview Matt also said that they were strongly considering working with Terry Date, who has worked with bands such as Pantera and Deftones. He also said the band would bring back the thrash metal elements from Scream Aim Fire. In November 2013, Bullet for My Valentine revealed though their Facebook page they were working on a new song. A short snippet of the song, titled \\"Raising Hell,\\" was released on Matt Tuck's Vine profile on the 15th. The song was first played three days later via BBC Radio 1's Rock Show. It was made available for streaming and a music video for the song was released a week later. In 2014, Matt announced on Twitter that the band were entering the studio to record a fifth album. On 28 August the band appeared on paranormal television show Most Haunted for an investigation at the Newton House in Llandeilo, Carmarthenshire. In an interview with Kerrang! on 21 January 2015, Matt revealed that Bullet for My Valentine will be hitting the studio next month with producer Colin Richardson who produced both The Poison and Scream Aim Fire, rather than Terry Date, who was the suggested producer initially. Tuck also said that their fifth album will be their heaviest album yet. On 9 February 2015, Bullet for My Valentine announced the departure of bassist Jason James, adding that they would announce a replacement when they felt \\"the time was right.\\" They went on to say that until the announcement, they'd be busy and focused on recording their new record. It was announced on the band's Facebook page in 2015 that a new song, \\"No Way Out,\\" would debut on BBC Radio 1 on 17 May 2015. The band also revealed their fifth studio album to be titled Venom and their new bassist was going to be Jamie Mathias, formerly of metal band Revoker. Venom was set for release on 14 August 2015, the same day an expansive UK tour was announced.

Jason Bowld, former drummer of Pitchshifter and Tuck's bandmate from AxeWound, became Thomas' replacement. In April, they signed a new worldwide deal with Spinefarm Records. Matt Tuck later tweeted \\"Here we go again. #BFMV6\\" which implied the band had started working on their sixth effort. Later in the year the band released a new single titled \\"Don't Need You\\". A music video was released with the video as well. At the end of 2017, Michael Thomas was replaced by Jason Bowld full-time. On 1 April 2018, Bullet for My Valentine debuted a new song, \\"Over It\\", on BBC Radio 1. The song is the first single off their sixth studio album, Gravity, which was confirmed for release on 29 June 2018. On 26 April, the song \\"Piece of Me\\" was released. On 18 May, the band released another new song, \\"Letting You Go\\", and released a music video for the song on 3 June. On 15 October, the band released a music video for the track \\"Not Dead Yet\\". ==Musical style and influences== Bullet for My Valentine has been described as metalcore, heavy metal, thrash metal, hard rock, emo, screamo, alternative metal, and post- hardcore. According to Decibel, Bullet for My Valentine's music consists of \\"'heavy metal' leads\\" and \\"'post-hardcore' vocals\\". According to AllMusic, Bullet for My Valentine blend \\"muscular riffs and emo harmonies\\" and also \\"take cues from '80s metal bands and punk-infused metal to make melodic, metallic, dark rock songs.\\" The band describe two of their albums, The Poison and Fever, as having a \\"super dark\\" tone. Bullet for My Valentine member Matt Tuck said, \\"…we're a hard rock band with metal influences, and I’ve said that from day one.\\" Kirk Miller of Decibel praised the band for the effort in synchronised song structures. When asked of their views on their looks, members of the band have stated that they would not change their sound or image for a commercial approach; Tuck also said, \\"Without sounding harsh, we're more interested in what our music sounds like than what our fucking hair looks like.\\" Matt Tuck told Exclaim!: \\"A lot of people already think we're more of an emo band just because of the name of the band. People need to give the music a fair listen musically before they decide to judge it. I say we're a melodic metal band, really. That's how I'd describe us.\\" Tuck said he prefers people call Bullet for My Valentine a heavy metal band instead of categorizing the band under specific subgenres. In an interview with Robert Gray from Ultimate-Guitar.com on 15 April 2010, Tuck said that when making the album Scream Aim Fire, Bullet for My Valentine were bothered by critics and journalists who criticized the band and said the band aren't \\"real metal\\". Tuck said that the band tried to please people like critics and journalists with Scream Aim Fire. Tuck said: \\"Scream Aim Fire was an album we wrote to try to prove people wrong, and wasn't an album we made for ourselves. Fever is an album that was a hundred percent us; we didn't listen to anyone's opinions, what critics' opinions were, or what people thought we should do, or how we should sound.\\" Tuck also said about Scream Aim Fire: \\"Some of it was written a hundred percent for us, but we tried a little bit too hard to be metal when we should've just carried on doing what we did really - like we did on all of The Poison material.\\" When Tuck was asked if he defines Bullet for My Valentine as a heavy metal band or a hard rock band, Tuck said: Bullet for My Valentine's influences include Judas Priest, Def Leppard, Mötley Crüe, Pantera, Iron Maiden, Metallica, Testament, Stuck Mojo, Megadeth, Slayer, Machine Head, Sepultura, Nirvana, Guns N' Roses, Queen, Led Zeppelin, and Dire Straits. According to Michael Thomas, these are the bands that inspire Bullet for My Valentine's \\"catchy vocals, aggressive riffs and melodies,\\" Matt Tuck has stated in an interview, his songwriting is highly influenced by Bruce Springsteen, Bob Seger and Bob Dylan. He goes on to say that \\"these bands just are proper old school songwriters.\\" ==Members== Bullet For My Valentine With Full Force 2018 06.jpgSinger and Rhythm Guitarist Matthew Tuck Bullet For My Valentine With Full Force 2018 20.jpgLead Guitarist Michael Paget Bullet For My Valentine With Full Force 2018 04.jpgBassist Jamie Mathias Bullet For My Valentine With Full Force 2018 25.jpgDrummer Jason Bowld Current * Matthew \\"Matt\\" Tuck – lead vocals, rhythm guitar (1998–present); bass (2003–2015) * Michael \\"Padge\\" Paget – lead guitar, backing vocals (1998–present) * Jamie Mathias – bass, backing vocals (2015–present) * Jason Bowld – drums, percussion (2017–present; touring member 2016–2017) Former * Nick Crandle – bass (1998–2003) * Jason \\"Jay\\" James – bass, backing vocals (2003–2015) * Michael \\"Moose\\" Thomas – drums, percussion (1998–2016) Timeline == Discography == ;Studio albums * The Poison (2005) * Scream Aim Fire (2008) * Fever (2010) * Temper Temper (2013) * Venom (2015) * Gravity (2018) ==Awards and achievements== * Welsh Music Award ** Best Newcomer (2004) * Metal Hammer Golden Gods Awards ** Best British Band (2006, 2010) * Kerrang!

Steenbock graduated from Wisconsin in 1916, where he was a member of Phi Sigma Kappa fraternity. ==Vitamin D== Steenbock was born in Charlestown, Wisconsin and grew up on a model farm outside New Holstein, Wisconsin. His graduate advisor at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, was Edwin B. Hart. His first publication reported the results of the single-grain experiment on which he assisted with Hart and Stephen Moulton Babcock. During his graduate career, Steenbock also served as an assistant in the lab of Elmer McCollum. When McCollum and another assistant Marguerite Davis published their discovery of what came to be called vitamin A, Steenbock thought he deserved more credit than he received. Steenbock carried on the vitamin A work in Madison, after McCollum accepted an offer from Johns Hopkins University. In 1923, Steenbock demonstrated that irradiation by ultraviolet light increased the vitamin D content of foods and other organic materials. After irradiating rodent food, Steenbock discovered that the rodents were cured of rickets. It is now known that vitamin D deficiency is a cause of rickets. Using $300 of his own money, Steenbock patented his invention. Steenbock's irradiation technique was used for food stuffs, but most memorably for milk. By the expiration of the patent in 1945, rickets had all but been eliminated. ==WARF== After receiving his patent, the Quaker Oats company offered $1 million (approximately $10 million today) for Steenbock's vitamin D technology. Steenbock thought twice about the offer. Instead of quickly selling his rights to a commercial company, Steenbock believed the money should be returned to the university. After soliciting interest from nine other University of Wisconsin–Madison alumni, Steenbock was influential in starting the first university technology transfer office, the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation (WARF). WARF's initial operating budget was $900, one hundred dollars from each of the nine alumni. On February 19, 1927, WARF completed its first licensing agreement with the Quaker Oats company. The license permitted Quaker Oats to fortify its breakfast cereals with vitamin D. WARF went on to license the technology to pharmaceutical companies for a medical application, which was known as Viosterol. The University of Wisconsin-Madison's Steenbock Memorial Library is named in his honor. ==See also== * Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation * Vitamin D * Rickets ==References *Biography in the Journal of Nutrition * Category:American biochemists Category:University of Wisconsin–Madison faculty Category:University of Wisconsin-Madison alumni Category:1886 births Category:1967 deaths Category:People from Charlestown, Wisconsin Category:People from New Holstein, Wisconsin ","title":"Harry Steenbock"},{"id":"2213071","text":"Franz F.

Planer had trained as a portrait painter, but realizing that photography was becoming very popular, and would replace the requirement for talented artists changed his career path. He changed direction into films, and thus began his career as a director of photography for films in Germany and later throughout Europe in the early 1900s until 1933, In 1937, he left the failing Austrian film industry, to begin work in Hollywood.

It now has six lines in operation (as of 31 January 2020) with a total combined route length of and 122 stations. The Light Rail Transit which opened in 1999 acts as a feeder service to the MRT network. ==Construction of backbone networkConceptualisation=== The idea of constructing a rapid transit line in the country was initiated in 1967, when a four-year State and City Planning study conducted by the Singapore government and the United Nations Development Programme. It was part of an urban renewal and development project which aimed to formulate a long-term comprehensive concept plan for guiding the country's future physical development. It was concluded that physical land constraints faced by the island nation, was not able to accommodate more roads to meet the rise in transportation demands. It was noted that the city state needed a rail transit system by 1992. ===Bus vs. rail debate=== It took 10 years since 1972 to design the MRT system, which continued all the way until the government gave permission to build the MRT. In 1972, a team of consultants and professional officers seconded from the government embarked on a major transport study known as the Singapore Mass Transit Study. In phase one of the study, the team examined existing and future transport demands, analysed various options and made recommendations for government investment in public transportation. The team recommended the rail mass transit as the best option for meeting the anticipated travel demands of Singapore. Phase two of the study, which commenced in 1975, examined the technical, economic and financial feasibility of the mass transit system. This study argued that a bus-rail system was a \\"superior alternative\\" to an all-bus system, with only a remote chance of a disastrous result. Despite the study's recommendation for the development of a MRT system, the high costs involved and the possible impact on patterns of land use and economic activities prevented the government from making an immediate decision. The issue was complicated by a review of the phase two study by a team from the World Bank. The World Bank team had issues with the Singapore team's costing and assessment of the relative benefits of the bus-rail plan compared to an all-bus system. Phase three of the study was conducted between 1979 and 1980, and provided a preliminary engineering design for the recommended transit system. In 1980, a Provisional Mass Rapid Transit Authority was appointed to undertake preparatory work for the construction of a possible MRT system. Despite the findings of the mass transit studies, the government was still hesitant to commit to the MRT system. A team of foreign consultants (also known as the Harvard team) led by team leader Kenneth Hansen was engaged to review the previous mass transit and other transportation studies. In their report, the Hansen team argued that the earlier studies were based on incorrect assumptions and thus failed to consider other approaches to solve Singapore's transport problems. Rather than a MRT system, the Hansen team recommended a high performance all-bus system coupled with feeder routes and motorcar restraint. Even if Singapore were to develop a MRT system, the team suggested that only one line be built as they believed that this would be sufficient to relieve traffic congestion and allow the bus system to function. When the late president Mr Ong Teng Cheong became the then-Minister for Communications (now the Ministry of Transport), he had to convince the cabinet in a debate in early 1980, that the S$ 5 billion needed for the system would be beneficial for the long-term development of Singapore. He argued that: > \\"This is going to be the most expensive single project to be undertaken in > Singapore. The last thing that we want to do is to squander away our hard- > earned reserves and leave behind enormous debt for our children and our > grandchildren. Now since we are sure that this is not going to be the case, > we'll proceed with the MRT, and the MRT will usher in a new phase in > Singapore's development and bring about a better life for all of us.\\" Therefore, a provisional Mass Rapid Transit Authority was established in July 1980, after the debate. However, Mr Ong faced strong opposition from other members of the cabinet, by Finance Minister Goh Keng Swee and Tony Tan, due especially to the heavy investments involved. A team of specialists from Harvard University, recommended that an all-bus system would be sufficient into the 1990s, and would cost 50% less than a rail-based system. Later on, two independent American transport and urban planning specialist teams were then appointed by the government to conduct their own independent reviews as part of the Comprehensive Traffic Study in 1981. This debate was also brought to national television in September 1980, which was rare at that time. The study came to a conclusion that an all-bus system would be inadequate as it would have to compete for road space which would have been increasingly overcrowded by then. The problem would be solved by building a rail system. Mr Ong hence declared in triumph on 28 May 1982, that: > \\"The Government has now taken a firm decision to build the MRT. The MRT is > much more than a transport investment, and must be viewed in its wider > economic perspective. The boost it'll provide to long term investors' > confidence, the multiplier effect and how MRT will lead to the enhancement > of the intrinsic value of Singapore's real estate are spin-offs that cannot > be ignored.\\" ===Construction begins=== The permission to begin the construction of Singapore's then-largest public works project was given in May 1982. A ground- breaking ceremony commenced the construction on 22 October 1983 at Shan Road. The majority of the work was expected to be completed in 1992. This included 67 km of track to be constructed, with 42 stations, of which 26 would be elevated, 1 at grade and 15 underground. The network was constructed in stages, with the North South Line given priority as the line passed through the Orchard Road corridor as well as the rest of the Central Area, the latter of which faced a high demand for public transport. Also, it was near the more densely populated housing estates such as Toa Payoh and Ang Mo Kio. The MRT Corporation, now Land Transport Authority, was established on 14 October 1983, taking over the roles and responsibilities of the former provisional Mass Rapid Transit Authority. On 6 August 1987, it set up SMRT Corporation. Construction began in various areas: *October 1983: Yio Chu Kang – Outram Park (Phase I) *January 1984: Outram Park – Clementi (Phase IA) *July 1984: Clementi – Lakeside (Phase II) *January 1985: Marina Bay – Tanah Merah (Phase II) *June 1985: Tanah Merah – Pasir Ris, Jurong East – Choa Chu Kang & Yio Chu Kang – Yishun (Phase II) *January 1988: Lakeside – Boon Lay (Phase II) Toa Payoh MRT station was the first to do structural works, followed by the tunnels between Outram Park and Tiong Bahru in 1985. The completion of the viaduct for Phase 1 was done on 15 December 1986 at Commonwealth MRT station. The first C151 train was delivered to MRT Corporation on 8 July 1986, by Yeo Ning Hong at Bishan Depot. One third of the MRT was completed on 15 January 1985, and the Minister for Communications and Information Yeo Ning Hong visited Orchard MRT and Dhoby Ghaut MRT station sites.One third of the MRT was completed The pouring of concrete was completed by the end of 1985 at Dhoby Ghaut MRT station. ===Initial opening=== On 7 November 1987, the first 6 kilometres of the North South Line from Yio Chu Kang to Toa Payoh went into operation. The novelty resulted in thousands flocking to the 5 station segment of the line just to experience and try out the system. At the launching of Toa Payoh, the late Mr Ong was quoted as saying that > this is like a 20-year affair from conception to delivery. Now the baby is > born, to say that I am happy and pleased is an understatement. Nine more stations from Novena to Outram Park were officially opened 12 December 1987 by then Deputy Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong. These trains ran as a through service from one end to the other even though Tanjong Pagar and Outram Park were on the East West line. On 12 March 1988, six more stations from Tiong Bahru to Clementi on the East West line were opened; trains now ran directly from Yio Chu Kang through the city to Clementi. On the same day, the system was officially launched by the late Mr Lee Kuan Yew, then Prime Minister of Singapore. ===Nearing completion=== The opening of the MRT network from 1987 to 1990 The rest of the system opened rapidly in stages. On 6 July 1990, with the last station opened, the entire system was opened by President Wee Kim Wee. {  !Date !Stations !Note - 5 November 1988 Jurong East, Chinese Garden, Lakeside (from Clementi) - 20 December 1988 Khatib, Yishun (from Yio Chu Kang) - rowspan=\\"2\\"4 November 1989 Marina Bay (from Raffles Place) rowspan=\\"2\\"Through train services between the \\"North\\" and \\"West\\" of the network ended with the opening of the \\"East\\". - Bugis, Lavender, Kallang, Aljunied, Paya Lebar, Eunos, Kembangan, Bedok, Tanah Merah (from City Hall) - 16 December 1989 Simei, Tampines, Pasir Ris (from Tanah Merah) - 10 March 1990 Bukit Batok, Bukit Gombak, Choa Chu Kang (from Jurong East) - 6 July 1990 Boon Lay (from Lakeside) } ==Subsequent expansionsWoodlands Extension of the North South Line=== Woodlands is a station built part of the Woodlands Extension together with Woodlands Regional Bus Interchange, located under the station. Less than a year after the completion of the MRT project, the government announced in February 1991, intentions to extend the system to Woodlands. Construction commenced in 1993, and the 16 km, 6 station elevated line was opened on 10 February 1996 at a total cost of S$ 1.2 billion. With this extension, the North South Line included the three stations on the former Choa Chu Kang Branch Line (Jurong East, Bukit Batok, Bukit Gombak and Choa Chu Kang), forming a continuous line from Jurong East to Marina Bay. The government came up with the proposal to build the Woodlands MRT line in 1990 when it announced its Woodlands MRT line construction plan, prioritizing the most than Changi Airport Line and the North East line. The proposal called for the extension of the existing North- South and East-West lines to connect Choa Chu Kang in the west to Yishun in the north. Many changes were subsequently made to the original plan. The changes were mainly to accommodate the 1991 Concept Plan by the Urban Redevelopment Authority, which aimed to make Woodlands a regional centre for northern Singapore. One of the changes was the number of MRT stations along the line. Due to the expected increase in the number of commuters in the Woodlands area, the government had to increase the number of MRT stations from four to the eventual six in order to serve a bigger and growing estate. The stations were also designed in a more user-friendly fashion. Most of the changes were incorporated by 1992. Woodlands New Town was only half completed, and Sembawang New Town was still in the planning stage at that time. In the original plan, the Woodlands MRT line had only four stations: Admiralty, Woodlands, Marsiling and Yew Tee. They would service commuters in Choa Chu Kang North, Woodlands West, Woodlands Central and Woodlands East. Two more stations were added to the plan later to include Sembawang and Kadut Industrial Estate. Construction work was supposed to take place in two phases, with four stations opening first and the remaining two (Sembawang and Kadut) later. However, the government and the Mass Rapid Transit Corporation (MRTC; now known as SMRT Corporation) subsequently made the decision to open the Sembawang Station with those in the first phase. It was also decided that Kadut Station would be built at a later stage (depending on the development of housing plans in the area), as there was no immediate need for an MRT station there. Instead, a new station, Kranji, was added to the plan. The entire line was to be built above ground and would measure a total of 16 km. The eventual stations built were Yew Tee, Kranji, Marsiling, Woodlands, Admiralty and Sembawang to serve the estates of Choa Chu Kang North, Kadut Industrial Estate, Woodlands West, Woodlands Central, Woodlands East and Sembawang. In 1991, the government awarded a contract, worth S$1.5 million, to Soil and Foundation Pte Ltd to conduct soil tests on the stretch of land between Chua Chu Kang and Yishun, through Woodlands, for the MRT line. The government then commissioned MRTC to begin work on the construction of the line in the latter part of 1991. The civil engineering construction contract, worth S$65.3 million, was awarded to a joint venture between Balfour Beatty of the United Kingdom and Gammon of Hong Kong, called the Balfour Beatty-Gammon venture. Meanwhile, the electrical and mechanical services contract, worth S$31.24 million, was awarded to General Electric Company of Singapore. The contract for providing signalling and automatic train control systems was given to Westinghouse Signal Limited for S$33.32 million. A contract for the communications systems, worth $17 million, was awarded to a joint venture comprising JS Telecom, Thomson Surveillance Video and Halberthal, all French companies, and led by Singapore Electronic & Engineering Limited (SEEL). In total, MRTC pre-qualified 30 firms and joint ventures for six civil engineering contracts and one track-work contract. Construction work began at both ends of the line, on the Choa Chu Kang and Yishun stations, simultaneously. One of the more difficult tasks during the course of the construction was a rock excavation work costing S$1.5 million along Woodlands Avenue 3, in which explosives were used to make way for the train viaduct. Another difficult project was the levelling of land covered in thick vegetation in Kadut, Woodlands and Sembawang. The laying of a 22-metre long concrete beam weighing 165 tonnes in October 1994 marked the completion of the structural link between the existing MRT network and the Woodlands extension line. The entire Woodlands extension line consists of around 1,163 beams. The tracks were then laid, followed by the installation of the electrical and mechanical systems and equipment. A real-time information system, costing S$400,000, was first introduced on the Woodlands MRT line. It provides passengers with train arrival times and informs them if trains are late or disrupted. The information is displayed on electronic boards installed at the entrance of each station. In 1995, test runs were carried out on the completed Woodlands MRT line to ensure smooth operations. Open houses were held a week before the official opening for users to familiarise themselves with the new stations. The new Woodlands MRT line was officially opened by then Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong on 10 February 1996. The first train took off at 1 pm during the opening ceremony. An estimated 12,000 people travelled on the Woodlands MRT line during the first hour of its opening. The construction of the extension was not without political fallout. For a long time, the politicians representing residences in the North-East area of the island had been calling for the construction of a planned North East line. The announcement of the Woodlands Extension led to protests especially from opposition members of parliament, in particular from Chiam See Tong and Low Thia Khiang, representatives of Potong Pasir and Hougang constituencies respectively, with both areas potentially benefiting from such a line. The opposition members accused the government of favouring the Woodlands Extension over the North East line due to opposition representation in the north-east area, arguing that there were far more residents in the north-east compared to the north, and questioned the rationale of building the Woodlands extension when the north was relatively undeveloped. ===Dover station=== Dover MRT station, the first MRT station to be built along an existing rail line. Dover, built on the East West line between Clementi and Buona Vista, was officially opened on 18 October 2001 by then Minister for Transport, Mr Yeo Cheow Tong. The first station to be built over an operating rail line with no disruptions to train services (although trains drove by the site at a reduced speed during the construction phase), it was also the first elevated station with two side platforms on either side of the tracks, as opposed to having an island platform as in all other elevated stations. Adjacent to the Singapore Polytechnic on one side, and undeveloped land on the other, the building of the station was met with reservations by some members of the public over its low catchment area. There were criticisms over the spending of \\"taxpayers' money\\" chiefly for use only by students of one educational institution. The government proceeded with the construction anyway, citing the catchment area extends to public housing flats on either end of the polytechnic, and that the undeveloped land opposite is slated for extensive development, largely residential in nature. This station has indeed brought much convenience to the students at the polytechnic. ===Changi Airport Extension=== Faregates at Changi Airport MRT station. For a long time following its opening in 1981, Singapore Changi Airport relied on taxis and buses as the primary means of public transportation to the rest of the country. They served the airport well, but concerns over competition from other regional airports, some of which feature quick rail-based services to their city centres, such as the one from Kuala Lumpur International Airport, accelerated the government's plan to build a rail link to the airport. Provision had long been made for a new line branching off from the existing East West line at the Tanah Merah, with some conceptual plans showing a tentative route alignment to the airport along Airport Boulevard, continuing beyond the airport to Changi Point, before turning southwest back toward the city along the east coast of the island. The plans were finally announced by then Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on 15 November 1996. However, the route alignment showed a deviation from previous plans. The final plan involved building only the first two stations, namely Expo, an elevated station directly adjacent to the Singapore Expo, and Changi Airport, an underground station built between Terminal Two and the since constructed Terminal Three. The alignment of the station at the airport was switched perpendicularly to an East-west direction, such that stairs and escalators lead to two of the terminals directly from either end of the station. Construction began on December 1998. A C751B train at the platform of Expo MRT station in 2005. Expo opened on 10 January 2001, sporting a \\"space age\\" architecture designed by world-renowned architect Sir Norman Foster. The roof is clad in titanium and its design enabled the platform to be free of any columns, freeing up space in a station which will be used by thousands of visitors to the massive 100,000 square metre Singapore Expo next door. Changi Airport was opened on 8 February 2002, giving the airport its first rail link after less than 21 years of operations. Initially through services were operated from the airport to Boon Lay at the other end of the East West line, however due to ridership falling below expectations the service was reverted to shuttle mode in 2003. ===North East line=== The entrance to Chinatown MRT station at street level: the completion of the North East line allowed the prominent ethnic neighbourhood of Chinatown to be connected by rail to the rest of Singapore's towns for the first time. The North East line, the first line operated by SBS Transit and among the first fully automated heavy rail lines in the world, opened on 20 June 2003, except for Woodleigh and Buangkok stations. System problems delayed the line six months from the scheduled opening date of December 2002. The construction period of the North East line was fraught with many delays and some budget problems. It marked the pinnacle of a long and chequered history of over two decades since the conception of the line had taken place along with that of the original system which was eventually completed in 1990. Up to May 2005, the line was running at a deficit. Although line operator, SBS Transit, managed a yearly overall profit as profits from its public bus service exceed the losses from its operation of the North East line. Running from HarbourFront where Singapore's former World Trade Centre building lies to Punggol to the northeast of the island, this line allowed for previously isolated or distanced areas to be linked up with the rest of Singapore by rail. Buangkok opened on 15 January 2006 and Woodleigh opened on 20 June 2011. ===New lines over the revolution: Circle and Downtown=== On 28 May 2009, 5.6 km of the Circle Line opened from Bartley to Marymount. On 17 April 2010, another 11.1 km of the Circle Line from Bartley to Dhoby Ghaut commenced operation. On 8 October 2011, the remaining 16.6 km from Marymount to HarbourFront commenced operation, marking the full completion of the line which took 10 years to complete, primarily delayed due to the Nicoll Highway collapse. On 14 January 2012, the 2.4 km of the Circle Line extension from Promenade to Marina Bay commenced operation. The Downtown Line is the fifth Mass Rapid Transit line in Singapore and opened in three stages, on 22 December 2013, 27 December 2015 and 21 October 2017 respectively. When fully completed, the line will be about long with 36 stations and serve about half a million commuters daily,\\"12 MRT stations for Bukit Timah by 2015\\" , Luxuryasiahome, 16 July 2008 making it the longest underground and driverless MRT line in Singapore. Travelling from one end to the other will take about 65 minutes. On 15 August 2014, the Downtown Line 3 Extension was announced, in conjunction with the announcement of the Thomson- East Coast MRT Line.\\"Thomson-East Coast Line, connecting North and East, ready by 2024\\" , Saifulbahri Ismail, Channel NewsAsia, 15 August 2014 Two additional stations, Xilin MRT station and Sungei Bedok MRT station will be added to the Downtown Line, with Sungei Bedok as an interchange station with the Thomson- East Coast Line. It will add an additional 2.2 km to the line with the extension. Due in 2024, Stage 3 will join the current East West and future Thomson-East Coast lines that runs through Marine Parade. ===Thomson–East Coast line=== On 31 January 2020, 2.8 km of the Thomson–East Coast Line opened from Woodlands North to Woodlands South. ===Existing line extensions=== On 28 February 2009, the 3.8 kilometre Boon Lay Extension to the East West line comprising 2 stations Pioneer and Joo Koon commenced passenger service. Construction had begun in December 2004 after the development of Pioneer New Town had been completed. Similarly, construction began for the Marina South Pier in December 2009 and completed in September 2014, it began operations on 23 November 2014. The 7.5 kilometre Tuas West Extension (TWE) – Gul Circle, Tuas Crescent, Tuas West Road and Tuas Link – opened for passenger service on 18 June 2017. ===2020 COVID-19 pandemic=== All train services are affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, due to the drop of ridership, coupled with full home- based learning for students and closure of workplaces and several services. These include frequency reduction, early closure and staggered closures. ==History of the system map1987 to 1996=== A recreated old MRT system Map used from 1987–1996 The MRT was a very recent addition for Singapore and as such, the authorities wanted to keep the MRT map as easy to use for Singaporeans as possible. Hence, each direction of travel was colour-coded in a different colour as though it were a line on its own. In that way, confusion in decision-making when taking a certain line in a certain direction would be reduced for passengers. However, this reduced the number of colours available for new lines and was not in line with international practice. Previously, each direction of travel on the MRT was denoted on system maps as a different colour. * Northbound services were denoted in yellow * Southbound services in red * Eastbound services in green * Westbound services in blue * Northbound Choa Chu Kang Branch Line services in beige * Southbound Choa Chu Kang Branch Line services in brown Each station was also assigned a unique alphanumeric code, with the alphabet indicating which part of the island the station lies at (North, East, West, Central, Marina Bay region or Choa Chu Kang Branch Line) and the numbers (in ascending order from the centre of the island) indicating which part of that region the station is located at. {  - !Code !Overview !Examples !Currently - A Bukit Panjang LRT A1 – A14 BP1 – BP14 - B Branch Line from Bukit Batok to Choa Chu Kang, superseded in 1996 by the North South Line's extension through Woodlands to Choa Chu Kang B1 – B3 NS2 – NS4 - C The two stations at the city's center, City Hall and Raffles Place, including Chinatown, Clarke Quay, Bras Basah, Esplanade and Promenade C1 – C7 EW13/NS25, EW14/NS26, NE4, NE5, CC2 - CC4 - E East West line (Eastern stretch) from Bugis to Pasir Ris, Expo and Changi Airport E1 – E14 EW1 – EW12, CG1 – CG2 - H HarbourFront MRT station (original) H1 NE1/CC29 - M Marina Bay and Marina South Pier M1 – M2 NS27 – NS28 - N North South Line from Dhoby Ghaut to Bukit Batok N1 – N23 NS24/NE6/CC1 – NS2 - P North East line from Little India to Punggol P1 – P11 NE7 – NE17 - T Original Tampines Line T1 – T15  - W Western stretch of East West line from Tanjong Pagar to Tuas Link excluding Dover W1 – W18 EW15 – EW33 - X Circle Line (from Nicoll Highway to Bayfront) X1 - X24 CC5 - CE1 } These were superseded in 2001 by two-digit codes as the latter might be exhausted with new MRT and LRT lines added to the network, thus only having 15 letters in total. However, \\"E\\", \\"N\\" and \\"W\\" were still found on viaduct pillars of the MRT and some traffic signals on the Westinghouse FS2000 signalling system (before upgrading to Thales SelTrac CBTC GoA 3 signalling system), but the \\"A\\" is still being used for the Changi Airport branch line. The codes for viaduct pillars are: {  - colspan=\\"3\\" align=\\"center\\"Viaduct Pillars - !Code !Overview !Examples - A Changi Airport Line from Tanah Merah to Expo tunnel portal A0001 – A0052 - B Branch Line from Jurong East to Choa Chu Kang (1990–1996) B001 – B226 - E East West line from Kallang tunnel portal to Pasir Ris E001 – E602 - N North South Line from Bishan to Jurong East N001 – N346 (1990–1996) N001 – N1154 (1996–present) - W East West line from Redhill tunnel portal to Tuas Link W001 – W609 (1990–2009) W001 – W732 (2009–2017) W001 – W908 (2017–present) } {  - colspan=\\"3\\" align=\\"center\\"Railway signals - !Code !Summary !Examples - B Bishan Depot  - C Changi Depot  - E East West line from Raffles Place to Pasir Ris E1 – E73 - N North South Line from Raffles Place to Admiralty N3 – N116 - rowspan=\\"2\\"NW North South Line from Jurong East to Admiralty including the Branch Line NW1 – NW55 - Jurong East Modification Project NW83 – NW85 - S North South Line from Raffles Place to Marina South Pier S7 – S30 - SE Changi Airport Line SE02 – SE18 - U Ulu Pandan Depot  - rowspan=\\"2\\"W East West line from Raffles Place to Joo Koon W5 – W75 - Jurong East Modification Project W80 – W82 } ===1996 to 30 July 2001=== The colour and alphanumeric codes for each direction of travel remained unchanged, except that with the opening of the Woodlands Extension (connecting Yishun station to Choa Chu Kang station), the Jurong East – Choa Chu Kang Branch Line ceased to exist. As such, the formerly Northbound Choa Chu Kang Branch Line services in khaki travelled southbound to Marina Bay & as such were denoted as red while the formerly Southbound Choa Chu Kang Branch Line services in brown originated from Marina Bay, hence having travelled northbound it was denoted as yellow. The alphanumeric codes for these stations were also replaced. After Sembawang it is N14-N18, N20-N23, with the exception of N13 and N19, reserved for future stations Canberra and Sungei Kadut. The B1-B3 was renumbered to N21-N23. The Bukit Panjang LRT opened in 1999 and was given the colours purple and orange to represent its direction of travel. Due to the alignment of the route, which was a loop track around Bukit Panjang New Town, the map was different. The stations were given the alphanumeric code A1 to A14, with numbering starting from Choa Chu Kang interchange and going anti-clockwise direction on the loop. The directional arrow on the shared service track (between stations A1 to A6) was split, half purple coloured and half orange coloured. From Bukit Panjang station, the orange arrows travelled in an anti- clockwise direction [(service B) via Petir] while the purple arrows travelled in a clockwise direction (service A) towards Senja. These were standardised into grey colour since 2001 because of additional LRT lines such as Sengkang and Punggol LRT. ===31 July 2001 to 30 January 2020=== Land Transport's Master Plan 2013, including lines that are under construction / under planning. Land Transport's Master Plan 2040, including lines that are under construction / under planning. As there were plans to expand the network, the MRT System Map could no longer afford to have each direction of travel represented by a different colour. The map was revamped to have one colour as there would be more MRT lines in the future, which was announced by the Minister of Communications and Information Technology, Mr Yeo Cheow Tong. The pilot trials for new signages were done at Dover and at the North East line. Colours were used to represent each line rather than each direction of travel, cutting the usage of colours by half and preserving other colours for future lines. * Red for North South Line * Green for East West line * Purple for North East line * Orange for Circle Line * Blue for Downtown Line * ' for Thomson-East Coast Line * Grey for all LRT Lines *' for Jurong Region Line *' for Cross Island Line The direction of travel was instead represented by numbers contained within a coloured circle located at the ends of each line, known as the destination number. {  - !

However under this revamped system map, the letter in each symbol denotes the line instead and the number increases in ascending order from East to West (East West line), North to South (North South Line), South West to North East (North East line), in an anti-clockwise direction (Circle Line), in a clockwise direction from the North-west to the South-east (Downtown Line), and from the Thomson stretch in the North to the East Coast stretch in the East (Thomson-East Coast). Interchange stations will then have at least two or three codes. Special codes were also used to denote the town centre. \\"STC\\" is Sengkang Town Centre and \\"PTC\\" is Punggol Town Centre. {  - !

The new map will feature the Circle MRT line as a focal point on the map, as well as prominent landmarks and waterbodies added to the surrounding areas. In addition, QR codes are included with links to a fare calculator and maps in all four languages. The new map has since been made available to all MRT and LRT stations on 31 January 2020. ==History of station and train announcementsSMRT Trains Ltd=== The public announcement system in all SMRT operated lines was introduced in 1994, beginning with the announcement of station names when a train arrives at the station. The door closing announcement was later added in 1997 and the next station announcement in 1999. Over time, however, some sections of the announcements were modified, and finally, the entire announcement system was changed in January 2008 in preparation for the installation of STARIS on all trains later that year. The new announcement system features a new voice, and a new chime before each announcement. The original announcements were made by the late Juanita Melson and contained information on how to purchase single journey tickets as well as how to obtain the deposit back, for the benefit of the tourists. This was eventually removed when the announcement system was upgraded with the current announcer, Chan Hui Yuh. Only the late Juanita Melson announcements are now being operated on the Bukit Panjang LRT when used on the BPLRT trains. All announcements on the NSEWL were changed again in October 2012 but was met by strong criticism by the public after Chinese announcements were included. This was eventually removed on all trains by December 2012. ===SBS Transit Ltd=== The North East line and the Downtown line, which are both operated by SBS Transit Ltd, features different announcements from SMRT operated lines. It features different chimes and a different announcer, as well as next station messages in Chinese, and in some cases, Malay and Tamil. ==History of the ticketing system1987 to 2002=== When the MRT opened in 1987, fares ranged from S$0.50 to S$1.10 in S$0.10 increments for all adult tickets, regardless of whether they were single-trip or stored-value tickets.Mass Rapid Transit Corporation, Singapore 1988, pg. 8–9 Several discounted fares were available: senior citizens and permanent residents above the age of 60 could travel on a flat fare of S$0.50 during off-peak hours; children below the height of 1.2 metres and full-time students in primary, secondary, pre- university and vocational training (VITB) institutions paid a flat fare of S$0.30 at all times.Singapore MRT Limited 1987, pg. 20–22 Magnetic strip plastic tickets were used, in various forms. Stored-value tickets were called farecards and came in three types: the blue farecard was issued to adults, the magenta farecard to senior citizens, and the red farecard to children. Single- trip forms of these tickets were retained at the faregates on exiting the paid area of a destination station. Monthly discounted tickets were available in four values: beige, pink, and purple tickets for primary and tertiary students, and full-time national servicemen came with a value of S$13, S$30 and S$36, respectively;Singapore MRT Limited 1987, pg. 23 the peach ticket was for secondary, pre-university and VITB students, costing S$17 each. These discounted tickets were valid for a month from the date of purchase, allowed up to four trips a day, and were non-transferable. Their farecards cannot be used from 1 December 2002 and support has been terminated since June 2003 with the removal of metal holes and convert validators to printing tickets (by cash). It is currently no longer workable. ===2002 to 2009=== The EZ-Link card is a contactless smart card, initially based on Sony's FeliCa smartcard technology. The cards are mainly used for the payment of transportation fares, but may also be used for payment at selected retail outlets. Established in 2002, the technology was promoted as the means for speedier and more convenient transactionsSharp 2005, pg. 113–115 and as well as being an efficient method of reducing fare evasion, although there have been some cases of overcharging users. As a benchmark, fares range from S$0.70 to S$3.20 for adults, S$0.70 to S$1.35 for senior citizens, and S$0.40 to S$0.50 for student EZ-Link cards. Patrons using an EZ-Link card receive a discount for their journey, including a discount if they use a connecting bus after their MRT ride. The General Ticketing Machines (GTMs) at each station which replaced the older ticketing machines, allow commuters to purchase additional credit to add to their EZ-Link cards or to purchase tickets for single trips. Fares for these single trip tickets are higher than those for EZ-Link cards. In addition, a S$1.00 refundable ticket deposit is charged for each Standard Ticket. This refund can be collected from any General Ticketing Machine so as long as the card is returned to the machine within 30 days of purchase. The card can also be deposited into a charity collection box, with the S$1 deposit going to charity. The rationale behind such a refundable deposit feature was that the smartcard technology contained within each Standard Ticket makes each one costly enough to necessitate the recycling of Standard Tickets. Since November 2007, external readers were installed on GTMs at stations operated by SMRT Corporation to address problems of card jamming in insert slots. The slots, however, remain in use for the purpose of refunding Standard Ticket deposits. Concession fares are available for children, students, senior citizens and national servicemen. Students are given free personalised cards, complete with their photos, names and national identification numbers. Regardless of its type, each card is assigned a unique card ID that can be used to recover the card if lost. Transport operators have organised lotteries that are based on these card IDs. The Singapore Tourist Pass offers unlimited travel for tourists on Singapore's public transport system. For S$8 a day, tourists can take any number of rides on buses and trains operated by SBS Transit, SMRT Buses and SMRT Trains. The old EZ-Link card can be used up to September 2009 where the old EZ-Link card usage became limited support. It remains on some MRT stations. ===2009 to date=== : Main articles: CEPAS On 26 August 2008, Land Transport Authority announced a two-month trial of the new generation Contactless ePurse Application (CEPAS) card that was developed in- house. It is intended to standardise the technology of cashless payment, allowing for use on public transport, Electronic Road Pricing (ERP), everyday shopping and meals. The card has replaced this generation of EZ-Link cards in 2009 and aims to encourage competition by allowing up to four CEPAS card issuers. Mass replacement of the old Sony FeliCa cards to the new CEPAS cards went on at TransitLink Ticket offices and Singapore Post outlets till 7 October 2009. On 29 February 2009, two new stations were added at the end of the line, the stations were Pioneer and Joo Koon. Joo Koon became the main terminal for the East West Line instead of Boon Lay MRT Station. ==History of Passenger Information Systems== The plasma displays which is easier for elderly and wheelchair passengers. The displays announced a train's terminating station when it arrives (or otherwise, a \\"Do Not Board\\" warning), although the disadvantage was that it could not tell the duration of a train's arrival time (e.g. the train will arrive at Jurong East Station in 2 mins). The second generation of such displays installed at stations along the Woodlands Extension featured a slightly updated version where the time till the next train arrival would be displayed from 3 minutes prior to the train's arrival. ==List of IncidentsClementi rail accident=Nicoll Highway collapse=== The Nicoll Highway collapse was a construction accident that occurred at approximately 3.30 pm on 20 April 2004 in Singapore when a tunnel being constructed for use by Mass Rapid Transit trains collapsed. The tunnel was part of the construction of the underground Circle line, near the Nicoll Highway. The supporting structure for the deep excavation work failed, resulting in a 30-metre (100 ft) deep cave-in that spread across six lanes of Nicoll Highway. The collapse killed four people and injured three. The accident has delayed the construction end date for the MRT station. ===2016 staff fatalities=2017 Joo Koon rail accident=References Category:Mass Rapid Transit (Singapore) Mass Rapid Transit Category:History of Singapore ","title":"History of the MRT (Singapore)"},{"id":"2213079","text":"\\"He's Simple, He's Dumb, He's the Pilot\\" is a song by American indie rock band Grandaddy, released as the second single from their second studio album The Sophtware Slump (2000). ==Writing and composition== Regarding the song's conception and its position as The Sophtware Slump's opening track, Jason Lytle noted: \\"It was definitely a struggle to get all the three parts to actually sound like they were intended to live together.

It is classified as a dialect of Occitan and a sub-dialect of Vivaro-Alpine, with some strong influence from the neighbouring Intemelian Ligurian dialect spoken from Ventimiglia to San Remo.Dalbéra (1984) ==Classification== Mentonasc is considered to be a transitional language; it is an intermediate language between Occitan and Ligurian, which is why the classification of Mentonasc is often debated. However, it is traditionally assigned to the Occitan language by french scholars and to Ligurian dialects by Italian scholars. The Mentonasc dialect bears strong similarities with the common alpine dialects, such as, Royasque or Pignasque. It differs quite significantly especially in the ear from Ligurian coastal dialects (Northern Italian), like those of Ventimiglia (Intemelio dialect) or Monaco. ==History== When the area of Menton was part of the Republic of Genoa and later of the Kingdom of Sardinia, Mentonasc was used in all of the coastal area between Monaco and Ventimiglia, and in the hinterland.

In the 19th century Mentonasc was used in the territories of the Free Cities of Menton & Roquebrune, an independent statelet created in connection with the Italian Risorgimento. When France annexed the Free Cities in 1861, Mentonasc began its decline, substituted by the French language. ==Geographic distribution== The Mentonasc dialect is currently spoken by about 10% of the population in Menton, Roquebrune, and the surrounding villages (Castellar, Castillon, Gorbio, Sainte-Agnès, Moulinet and Sospel). Now the language is being taught within the French educational system, as a variety of Niçard (i.e. Provençal and Occitan), so this may change. ===Official status=== No countries currently have Mentonasc as an official language. ==Vocabulary== Below is a chart of some nouns and verbs found in French, translated into Mentonasc. {  !French !Mentonasc - accôtement bor dou camen, riba (n.f.) - accouchement part (n.m.) - accoucher partouri (v.) - accoucheuse baila, couchusa, coumà (n.f.) - accouder acoudâ, pountelâ (v.) - accoudoir bras (n.m.) - accouplement acoubiament (n.m.) - accoupler acoubiâ (v.) - accourir veni vitou (v.) - accoutrer gimbrâ, arnesca (v.) - accoutumer acousturiâ, abituâ (v.) - accrediter acreditâ (v.) - accroc set (n.m.), sgarahura(n.f.)

Frishberg (born March 23, 1933) is an American jazz pianist, vocalist, composer, and lyricist born in Saint Paul, Minnesota. His songs have been performed by Blossom Dearie, Rosemary Clooney, Shirley Horn, Anita O'Day, Michael Feinstein, Irene Kral, Diana Krall, Stacey Kent, John Pizzarelli and Mel Tormé. Frishberg wrote the music and lyrics for \\"I'm Just a Bill\\", the song about the forlorn legislative writ in the ABC Schoolhouse Rock! series, which was later transformed into the popular revue Schoolhouse Rock Live. For Schoolhouse Rock! he also wrote and performed \\"Walkin' on Wall Street\\", a song that describes how the stock market works, and \\"$7.50 Once a Week\\", a song about saving money and balancing a budget. == Biography == Frishberg resisted learning classical piano as a boy, developing an interest in blues and boogie- woogie by listening to recordings by Pete Johnson and Jay McShann. As a teenager he played in the house band at the Flame in St. Paul where Art Tatum, Billie Holiday, and Johnny Hodges appeared. After graduating from the University of Minnesota as a journalism major in 1955, Frishberg spent two years in the Air Force. In 1957, Frishberg moved to New York City, where he played solo piano at the Duplex in Greenwich Village. He first became known for his work with Carmen McRae, Ben Webster, Gene Krupa, Bud Freeman, Eddie Condon, Al Cohn, and Zoot Sims.

The origins of the thoughts were brought about by Ambroise-Auguste Liébeault in 1866, in Nancy, France. Through his publications and therapy sessions he was able to gain the attention/support from Hippolyte Bernheim: another Nancy Doctor that further evolved Liébeault's thoughts and practices to form what is known as the Nancy School. It is referred to as the Nancy School to distinguish it from the antagonistic \\"Paris School\\" that was centred on the hysteria-centred hypnotic research of Jean-Martin Charcot at the Salpêtrière Hospital in Paris. ==Origins== ;Ambroise-Auguste Liébeault (1823-1904)Fancher, Raymond E., and Alexandra Rutherford. \\"Chapter 10: Social Influence and Social Psychology.\\" Pioneers of Psychology: A History. New York: W.W. Norton, 2012. 415-29. Print. Liébeault was born to a peasant family in Farrières France.Carlos S. Alvarado (2009) \\"Ambroise August Liébeault and Psychic Phenomena\\", American Journal of Clinical Hypnosis, 52:2, 111-121 While expected to become a priest, he rather started his medical studies at Strasbourg, where he obtained his medical degree in 1850. At Strasbourg, he stumbled upon an old book about animal magnetism and became fascinated with it. He moved to Nancy, France in 1860 and opened up his own clinic. Having finally established a successful practice, his thoughts turned back to that book on animal magnetism and he decided to start experimenting with hypnotic therapies. He did this by offering his patients a strange bargain: they could either continue their standard methods of treatment and continue their usual fee or they could be treated hypnotically, through suggestion, for free. Naturally, at first, many patients stuck by their standard methods because hypnosis at that time was still controversial. As more and more patients started receiving the hypnotic treatment and spreading news of its success, Liébeault became known as \\"Good Father Liébeault.\\" In 1866 he published his first book titled Du sommeil et des états analogues, considérés surtout du point de vue de l'action du moral sur le physique (Sleep and its analogous states considered from the perspective of the action of the mind upon the body)Carrer, L., Ambroise-Auguste Liébeault: The Hypnological Legacy of a Secular Saint, Virtualbookwork.com, (College Station), 2002 that focused on the similarities between induced sleep (or trance) and natural sleep, the features of the hypnotic state, how the induction of sleep relates to the nervous system, and the phenomena of hallucinations. Within this theory, he labeled the key difference between sleep and the hypnotic state to be \\"produced by suggestion and concentration on the idea of sleep and that the patient was \\"en rapport\\" with the hypnotist.\\"Lynn, S. J., & Rhue, J. W. (1991). Theories of hypnosis: Current models and perspectives. New York: Guilford Press. This book was largely ignored by the medical profession due to the fact that it was obscurely written and sold very few copies. However, Liébeault's theory on the hypnotic state that he devised in this book attracted the attention of a prominent Nancy doctor, and soon to be student of Liébeault himself, Hippolyte Bernheim. ;Hippolyte Bernheim (1840-1919) Bernheim, born in Alsace, received his medical degree from Strasbourg for internal medicine, specializing in heart diseases and typhoid fever.https://www.jstor.org/stable/20338759 From hearing of the reputation Liébeault was establishing with his work in hypnosis and from reading his first publication, Bernheim skeptically visited the \\"hypnotic clinic\\" to see for himself if all of the stories he had been hearing were true. His amazement of what was happening led him to regularly visit the clinic to learn Liébeault's methods, and eventually abandoned his practice with internal medicine to become a full-time hypnotherapist. Bernheim at first humbly became a student of Liébeault, and eventually came to study the hypnotic state on par with him as a colleague. Bernheim was able to bring Liébeault's ideas about suggestibility to the attention of the medical world. His focus was on the patients rather than the hypnotist because he believed that the patients held the important factors to be hypnotized. He believed that every human being has the trait of suggestibility but each just varied to the degree of which. This idea became a staple in the train of thought of the Nancy doctors. He wrote these thoughts and others, like how \\"suggestible patients could be successfully treated by straightforward persuasion techniques as well as by hypnosis,\\" in his book De la Suggestion et de ses Applications à la Thérapeutique (Suggestive Therapeutics). Although Bernheim was the leading proponent of suggestion accounting for hypnotic phenomena, he never took full credit for it all. He argued that \\"while suggestion was proposed by Abbé Faria, and was applied by James Braid, it was perfected by Liébeault.\\" ==Hypnotism== Liébeault and his followers did not agree with the views of Charcot and the Salpêtrière hospital's school of thought. In fact they were opposed to the ideas of the hysteria-centered school of thought that was the hallmark of Jean-Martin Charcot's Paris school. Instead they believed that: *Hypnosis is a physiological condition, which can be induced in healthy individuals.https://www.gutenberg.org/catalog/world/readfile?fk_files=1540701&pageno;=5 The Nancy school believed the state of mind of hypnosis was a \\"nonpathological psychological state of mind\\". This view was in direct opposition to the hysteria-centered view of hypnosis by the Paris school, which stated that hypnosis was a mental disorder. *Everyone has a tendency to respond to suggestion, but while under hypnosis this condition is artificially increased. They believed that suggestion was a trait that could be measured and varied within the subject. *Suggestion explains all. It is a form of automatism. They believed that the deeply hypnotized subject responds automatically to suggestion before his intellectual centers have had time to bring their inhibitory action into play. Liebeault, Bernheim, and the school in Nancy believed that hypnosis was due to the physiological property in the brain of suggestibility.Ernest R. Hypnotic Phenomena: The Struggle for Scientific Acceptance: Modern experiments are bringing hypnotic phenomena out of the fringe area of pseudoscience into the domain of normal psychological science Bernheim discovered that if he gave a subject a suggestion to return to him at ten o'clock in 13 days while under hypnosis, the subject would show up at the exact time Bernheim had suggested. The subject showed no recollection of receiving a suggestion, and stated that the \\"idea presented itself to his mind only at the moment at which he was required to execute it.\\"Bernheim, H. (1883–1884). De la suggestion dans l'état hypnotique et dans l'état de veille. Revue Médicale de l'Est In Bernheim's Latent Memories and Long-Term Suggestions, he proposed that post-hypnotic suggestions were a result of his subjects periodically falling into a hypnotic state and remembering the suggestions they received from him while previously under hypnosis.Bernheim, H. (1886). Souvenirs latents et suggestions à longue échéance. Revue Médicale de l'Est, 17, 97–111 Below is a description of one of his experiments on post- hypnotic suggestion. \\"To one, I tell her during her sleep:—\\"Next Thursday (in five days) you will take the glass that is on the night table and put it in the suitcase that is at the foot of your bed.\\" Three days later, having put her back to sleep, I say to her: \\"Do you remember what I ordered you to do?\\" She answers: \\"Yes, I must put the glass in my suitcase Thursday morning, at eight o'clock.\\"—\\"Have you thought about it since I told you?\\"—\\"No\\"—\\"Think hard.\\"—\\"I thought about it the following morning at eleven o'clock.\\"—\\"Were you awake or asleep?\\"—\\"I was in a drowsy state.\\" (Bernheim, 1886a, pp. 109–110)\\" Bernheim theorized that memories of suggestions subjects received under hypnosis were not unconscious, instead they were latent, or dorminant until it is revived when the subject drifts into a hypnotic state. On the other hand Charcot was the director of the Paris's large Salpetriere Hospital. He claimed that \\"hypnotizability and hysteria were aspects of the same underlying abnormal neurological condition.\\"Fancher, Raymond E. The Nancy-Salpetriere Controversy. 4th ed. W.W Norton & Company, Inc., 1996. 416. Print. Therefore, he doubted the view of the Nancy school: that hypnotic susceptibility was a normal characteristic. Instead, \\"Charcot speculated that the root cause of hysteria lay in a hereditary, progressive, and generalized degeneracy of the nervous system that interferes with the ability to integrate and interconnect memories and ideas in the normal way.\\" While studying hysteria in Charcot's famous patient Lucie, Charcot and Pierre Janet theorized that all post- hypnotic suggestions were performed by a \\"dissociated consciousness\\". They came to this conclusion because when Lucie would have symptoms of hysteria, she would recall childhood fears. Janet then used this research as evidence that tramautic events of the past led to the onset of symptoms of hysteria which resulted in a dissociated consciousness that was expressed in hypnotic neurosis. Charcot believed that hypnotic neurosis could be described as to follow three stages: catalepsy, lethargy, and somnambulism. These ideas were implemented into Charcot's grand theory of hypnotism.LeBlanc, A. (2004), Thirteen days: Joseph Delboeuf versus Pierre Janet on the nature of hypnotic suggestion. J. Hist. Behav. Sci., 40: 123–147. doi: 10.1002/jhbs.20000 The theory of grand hypnotism was presented by Charcot to the French scientific establishment and was accepted as a legitimate study. Bernheim countered Charcot, by stating that provoked sleep was simply a consequence of suggestion. This was the exact opposite of the belief held by Charcot that suggestion was due to provoked sleep from the disorder of hypnotic neurosis. Bernheim believed that the \\"..automatic execution of suggested acts could happen while awake and without somnambulism.\\" He stated that \\"Sleep, which suspends the power of will and reasoning, merely facilitated the brain's acceptance of the suggested idea.\\" This idea led Bernheim to accuse Charcot of \\"creating a cultural hysteria\\" at the Salpêtrière hospital that was in fact due to the suggestion and charisma of Charcot's showmanship. Bernheim pointed out that Charcot's subjects were aware of what was expected of them while under hypnosis, Charcot and his colleagues even discussed what they expected of the patient in front of them. This included Charcot's convulsions which he implemented as a hallmark symptom of hypnotic neurosis. Charcot's hysteria- stricken subjects gained much popularity in the hospital at Paris, and around the entire country. In the end, around 1891 the Salpetriere protagonists admitted openly that they have been wrong. \\"Charcot too, admitted his errors on hypnotism and privately predicted that his theories of hysteria would not long survive him\\". Besides his mistakes, \\"Charcot was among the first to explore interactions between emotional and physical factors, and he raised the important subjects of hysteria and hypnosis out of scientific obscurity\\". ==Influences== One of the first influential researchers of hypnotism was Indo- Portuguese monk, Abbé Faria. He was a pioneer of the scientific study of hypnotism who believed hypnosis worked purely through the power of suggestion. The Scottish surgeon James Braid, focused on the susceptibility of the subjects and not on what the hypnotist was doing. By doing this Braid was able to make a revolutionary observation and conclusion by having his subjects stare at and concentrate on a shiny object.Conis, Elena. \\"MEDICINE; ESOTERICA MEDICA; Under its Spell; from Sideshows to Scientific Studies, Hypnosis Still Intrigues.\\" Los Angeles Times: 0. Oct 02 2006. ProQuest. Web. 24 Nov. 2013 He noticed that \\"the staring paralyzed the eye muscles, he concluded, and the fixed attention weakened the mind, resulting in an unusual state of the nervous system, halfway between sleep and wakefulness.\\" From this conclusion Braid announced this discovery as being neurohypnology, or nervous sleep. Braid also proposed that hypnosis would and could have a number of clinical uses, including being useful for surgical anaesthesia; all of which helped pave the way for the establishment of scientific hypnotism, and, because Braid approached hypnotism as a scientist and natural philosopher, he was able to move hypnotism beyond controversy and mystery, and give it a respectable face.See: Yeates, L.B., James Braid: Surgeon, Gentleman Scientist, and Hypnotist, Ph.D. Dissertation, School of History and Philosophy of Science, Faculty of Arts & Social Sciences, University of New South Wales, January 2013. Bernheim was a great asset to Liébeault's studies and research on hypnotism. Unlike Liébeault, Bernheim was proficient at writing effectively and communicating all of their elaborate ideas. In the book Pioneers of Psychology, Raymond E. Fancher and Alexandra Rutherford state that \\"Bernheim was effective at elaborating these ideas in several books and articles that came to be identified as the main statements of the Nancy school.\\"Raymond E. Fancher - Alexandra Rutherford Pioneers of Psychology, W.W. Norton, 2016. ==Impact== The research and theories produced by the Nancy School has had a great impact on our society today. Multiple research studies have been tested to show that these techniques are safe and effective in certain situations. D. Barrett stated that it is also \\"becoming clear that the skills one needs to respond to hypnosis are similar to those necessary to experience trance-like states in daily life.\\"http://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/200101/the- power-hypnosis According to K. Cherry, \\"the technique has also been clinically proven to provide medical and therapeutic benefits, most notably in the reduction of pain and anxiety. It has even been suggested that hypnosis can reduce the symptoms of dementia.\\"http://psychology.about.com/od/statesofconsciousness/a/hypnosis.htm While reading through articles and research, hypnosis can affect people differently depending on their state of mind. Experiments today have given us enough information to show that hypnosis and the power of suggestion can help with certain problems in daily life; whether it be trying to quit smoking or to relieve the pain of consistent headaches. There were many influential people in the history of psychology that have been themselves influenced by the Nancy School and the concept that it believed in. With this influence many of these psychology figures have been able to accomplish great things for psychology.

The film was directed and co-written by Rajiv Menon, and features an ensemble cast of Mammootty, Ajith Kumar, Tabu, Aishwarya Rai and Abbas. Veteran actors Srividya, Raghuvaran and Manivannan play supporting roles. The film's soundtrack was scored by A. R. Rahman and the cinematographer was Ravi K. Chandran. After several delays, Kandukondain Kandukondain opened to Indian audiences on 5 May 2000. The film was dubbed and released in Telugu as Priyuraalu Pilichindi and the producers released subtitled versions worldwide. The film won a National Film Award and two Filmfare Awards South, and was featured in international film festivals. == Plot == Indian Peace Keeping Force soldier Major Bala is fighting in war-torn Sri Lanka and loses his right leg in an explosion caused by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. Elsewhere, Manohar, a film director, is greeted in a shooting spot by his parents, who want him to marry Swetha, so that he will inherit her family's company. Sisters Sowmya and Meenakshi are part of a close-knit family living in a Chettiar mansion in Karaikudi, Tamil Nadu, with their mother Padma, maternal grandfather Chandrasekhar, maidservant Chinnatha and younger sister Kamala. Sowmya is a school principal while Meenakshi is passionate about classic Tamil poetry, music and dance. Sivagnanam, a friend of Bala, lives with his mother. His mother is having breathing issues, which is fixed a soon as he says the word marriage. After his mother wants to see a marriage, Sivagnanam shows two cats, Raj and Viji, getting married much to her dismay. Bala, who now runs a flower business, has become a depressed and alcohol-dependent man since losing his leg but he quits drinking after an argument with Meenakshi, with whom he falls in love and supports her family when in need. Meenakshi, who, considers Bala as a friend, falls in love with Srikanth, a charming businessman who shares Meenakshi's interests. Manohar visits Meenakshi's house for a film shoot. Sowmya and Manohar fall in love with each other. On his deathbed, Chandrasekhar tries to say something about his will but no-one understands him. After his death, their lawyer breaks open the box and find he has bequeathed all of his property to his younger son Swaminathan, remembering his elder daughter Padma had eloped and married without his knowledge. Vidya and Sowmya silently submit themselves to Swaminathan and is wife, Lalitha's demands, but Meenakshi is unable to accept the change in lifestyle. Sowmya and her family move to Chennai when they can no longer stand Lalitha's arrogant behaviour upon inheriting the mansion. Upon arriving in Chennai, the family struggles and they work as cooks at a local restaurant. While eating a vazhaipoo vada (banana flower vada), Bala and Sivagnanam recognises its taste and immediately goes to the kitchen. He is surprised to see such a rich family working tirelessly in the restaurant. After attending several interviews, Sowmya gets a job as a telephone operator at a software company. She is later promoted to a junior programmer due to her qualifications while Meenakshi becomes a playback singer with Bala's help. Sowmya is passionate about her job and as a result, she helps her colleagues when they need help. Srikanth's finance company goes bankrupt and he has to pay back his investors. Meanwhile, Lalitha is sad after Swaminathan dies and offers the Chettinad house to Sowmya and her family, who refuse to take the house back. A minister offers to bail out Srikanth and his company if Srikanth marries his daughter. Srikanth agrees but Meenakshi is shocked and overwhelmed at his hypocrisy. After recording her first song, Meenakshi falls into an open manhole and is rescued by Bala. Realising Bala's love for her, Meenakshi falls in love with him. Manohar's first film project is in disarray and he is thrown out. He plans to make his own action film with Nandhini Varma, a well-known Telugu film actor, as the heroine. Nandhini is superficially attracted to Manohar; rumours of an affair between them spread and his lack of attention to Sowmya hurts her deeply. Bala introduces Meenakshi to Vinod, an army officer, as he does not want Meenakshi to dedicate her life to caring for him because of his missing leg. Meenakshi tells Vinod and his family that she is not interested in him and declares her love to Bala. Manohar's film is a commercial success but when he visits Sowmya's house in Chennai, he finds she is moving to California for her company's project. Manohar and Sowmya tearfully argue and he tries to persuade Sowmya to marry him, and she accepts his offer. Manohar marries Sowmya and Bala marries Meenakshi. == Cast == As per the opening and closing credits: * Mammootty as Major Bala * Ajith Kumar as Manohar * Tabu as C.

R. Rahman as himself (uncredited) == Production  Development === After the success of his first film Minsara Kanavu (1997), director Rajiv Menon was signed by producer Kalaipuli S. Thanu to direct a film in the final quarter of 1998. In November 1998, Menon announced he had begun pre-production work on a project titled Theekkul Viralai Vaithal, a title taken from a line by Subramania Bharati. The initial idea of the film came from a conversation between Menon and director Mani Ratnam about the contrast between Menon's life and that of his brother. While Menon entered the film industry, his brother focused on an academic career and later became an officer in the Indian Railway Accounts Service. Ratnam later suggested Menon should make a film on the subject. Menon wrote a screenplay based on the Jane Austen novel Sense and Sensibility and the project was renamed Kandukondain Kandukondain. The title was inspired by the phrase \\"kanden kanden Seethaiyai kanden\\" from Kambar's epic Kamba Ramayanam. Menon said the film's story of two sisters was reminiscent of those of him and his brother during difficult parts of their lives. The film was initially launched as a project in Tamil, Telugu, Hindi and Malayalam, though it was only released in Tamil with a subsequent dubbed version in Telugu titled Priyuraalu Pilichindi. Menon first wrote the story in English then dictated the dialogue in Malayalam; this was then translated into Tamil by Sujatha. In November 1999, when most of the production was complete, Menon—whose previous film performed poorly in rural areas—wanted to show a rough copy of Kandukondain Kandukondain to a village audience to ensure they could relate to the subject. After showing parts of the film to audiences in Udumalpettai and Pollachi, the team later held a group discussion before thanking the volunteers with gifts while receiving positive feedback. === Casting === Tabu was the first actor to be cast in the film; she was cast in the role of the elder sister Sowmya and Revathi was signed to dub for her character. The casting of the younger sister Meenakshi took longer to finalise; Menon initially approached Manju Warrier, who liked the script but was hesitant to commit to appear in the film due to her impending wedding with Dileep. He next discussed the role with Soundarya, whose team wanted to read the script before committing to the project. However, Soundarya's brother was not interested in letting her play a second heroine. Because Menon was still finalising the climax, he opted to explore other options. Aishwarya Rai was then signed onto the project, making her third appearance in Tamil films after roles in Mani Ratnam's Iruvar (1997) and Shankar's Jeans (1998). Despite being replete with Hindi film offers, Rai said she was a large fan of Menon's work and could strongly identify with the character, and accepted the offer. Menon and writer Sujatha presented two points of view in the female leads; while Sowmya accepts her destiny, Meenakshi wants to make her own life choices. While finalising the character arc of Sowmya, Menon drew inspiration from a person with whom he was familiar. Initially Menon cast Prabhu Deva, the lead actor of his previous film, in a leading role. Deva had played a key role in introducing Menon to producer Thanu but soon left the project. For the role of a former army general, Menon attempted to cast Parthiban but the actor's difficult relationship with Thanu meant they could not collaborate. Arjun Sarja was also approached but he was working in a different film genre during the period. Eventually, Menon cast Mammootty in the role. Abbas was cast in a role of a young businessman while Vikram dubbed for his character. Menon approached Prashanth to appear in the film but the actor demanded to be paired opposite Rai rather than Tabu. Menon did not want to switch the female lead actors and decided not to cast Prashanth. In January 1999, Rajiv Menon met and narrated the script of Kandukondain Kandukondain to Ajith Kumar, who had been recovering from back surgery; Kumar agreed to portray the struggling film director character. While writing the character, Menon was inspired by his experiences as a junior technician looking to make a breakthrough in the film industry. Between signing for Kandukondain Kandukondain and its release in May 2000, Ajith Kumar had significantly expanded his box-office appeal through the commercial success of his other films. Srividya was signed to play the mother of Tabu and Rai while Shamili played their sister. Nizhalgal Ravi and debutant Anita Ratnam were also cast in the film with Malayalam actor Unnikrishnan Namboothiri making his debut as the bedridden grandfather. Prominent actors Raghuvaran and Manivannan were selected for supporting roles in the film while Hindi actors Dino Morea and Pooja Batra appeared in small character roles, with Batra playing an actor. Cameraman Arvind Krishna appeared in a small role as Ajith Kumar's friend. Rajiv Menon and Dhanu retained several of the technical team from his previous venture, adding Sujatha as a writer. Menon said he often thought of dialogue in Malayalam—his native language—before telling writer Sujatha to translate it into Tamil. A cinematographer himself, Menon chose to avoid that task in the project and appointed Ravi K. Chandran as the cinematographer. According to Menon, directing and filming at the same time was \\"strenuous\\", though he said he photographed almost 30% of Kandukondain Kandukondain because Chandran was briefly unavailable. Music of the film's music was composed by A. R. Rahman while lyrics were written by Vairamuthu; the pair argued during the production. Suresh Urs edited the film while Vikram Dharma directed stunts, Nagu directed arts and Rekha Prakash, Brindha and Raju Sundaram choreographed the songs. Costumes were designed by Nalini Sriram. === Filming === The title song was filmed at Eilean Donan Castle, Scotland. Scenes with Mammootty's soldier character were filmed in Munnar from February to April 1999, just before the outbreak of the Kargil War. The team were able to borrow a former military helicopter for the sequences. A large portion of the film's first half was filmed in the Kanadugathan area of Karaikudi. The team persuaded industrialist M. A. M. Ramaswamy to lend them his palatial Chettiar mansion for filming; they secured permission to use the property because the producer Thanu was an acquaintance of Ramaswamy. Menon submitted a one-page synopsis of the film to Ramaswamy, who gave his permission under the condition that a death scene was filmed elsewhere. Menon hired the Rao Bahadur house for the extra scenes. According to Menon, during filming in the Chettiar mansion, the unit bonded with Rai and Tabu, becoming good friends; Ajith Kumar learnt from Mammootty and the whole unit ate dinner together. Most of the project's first half was filmed within a week. In May 1999, the crew along with Rai and Abbas went to Scotland to film the title song in Dornie with Eilean Donan Castle as a backdrop. Menon used the location to show Rai's character Meenakshi is living in a fantasy world so he filmed the song with a blue and green theme. In comparison, the team wanted to contrast the colours for Tabu's song by using red and brown as the main colours. The production team subsequently planned a four-day trip to Egypt to film the song \\"Enna Solla Pogirai\\" with the Giza pyramids as a backdrop; however, the trip turned into a week-long schedule. The first part of the song was shot in Karaikudi with a train in the background. Rajiv Menon and actors Ajith Kumar, Tabu, Raju Sundaram and Ravi K. Chandran travelled daily for three hours from Cairo to film in the heat; one filming day was cancelled after Tabu fainted. Professional Kathakali artists were used for the song \\"Konjum Mainakale\\", and the video for \\"Yengay Yenedhu Kavidhai\\" was filmed against the backdrop of Chennai's monsoonal rains. Meanwhile, the song \\"Kannamoochi Yenada\\" was filmed with the leading cast at Kushaldas Gardens in Chennai. Some scenes featuring Rai were filmed at Menon's flat in Chennai. Kandukondain Kandukondain was delayed for six months due to the success of Rai's films Taal and Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam, which prompted the revival of other projects she had signed up to in that period. Menon's insistence composer A. R. Rahman reworked some of the music to provide a better fusion of classical and contemporary music also delayed progress. Filming ended six months behind the schedule devised by Menon but according to him, everything happened as planned. === Post-production === During post-production, Mammootty initially resisted the dubbing for his character before accepting the producer's demands. The film's producer Kalaipuli S. Thanu had not paid Rajiv Menon for his work in the film. Thanu's name was subsequently removed from the theatrical release posters in Mumbai and was not included in the crew credits when Menon released a book adaptation of the film. == Soundtrack == The songs in Kandukondain Kandukondain were composed by A. R. Rahman and the rights to the soundtrack album were bought by Saregama for a then-record sum of 2.2 crore. The soundtrack includes eight songs, one of which is based on a poem written by Subramania Bharati, \\"Kannamoochi\\" is set in the Carnatic raga Nattakurinji. Rajiv Menon, who is a fan of this raga, presented Rahman with the song \\"Kavalaiyai Theerpathu Naattiya Kalaiye\\" from Sivakavi (1943) and asked him to compose at least one piece based on the raga. \\"Kandukondain Kandukondain\\" is based on the Nalinakanthi raga, \\"Smayiyai\\" is based on jazz music, and \\"Enna Solla Pogirai\\" is a folksy and romantic song. Menon personally asked Shankar Mahadevan to sing the song \\"Enna Solla Pogirai\\". == Release and reception == A function was held to mark the release of the soundtrack to Kandukondain Kandukondain with Kamal Haasan in attendance. The film was initially scheduled for release in the 1999 Diwali season but delays led to the producers announcing it would be released on 1 January 2000, becoming the first film of the new millennium. Further delays due to the success of other films Padayappa and Vaali ensured the film missed that date. The release of Mani Ratnam's Alaipayuthey led to the further postponement of the release of Kandukondain Kandukondain to May 2000. Kandukondain Kandukondain opened to positive reviews from film critics. The Indian Express stated; \\"A progressive film encouraging female independence, yet staying a warm family tale in essence, Kandukondain Kandukondain is the kind of film every intelligent movie-goer ought not to miss. Almost every supporting character pitches in an impressive performance, thus making Kandukondain Kandukondain a wonderful watch\\". In the review for Rediff, Shobha Warrier stated although the film has \\"too many songs, too little emotion\\", it has \\"a powerful story with intense and well-developed characters. One of the most poignant scenes in the film is Mammootty's outburst against the system, which forgets war heroes who lay down their lives for a cause.\\" The film completed 150 days at the box office in Tamil Nadu. It was also successful in Kerala. It was initially unsuccessful in Kerala because Mammootty was not promoted as one of the lead artists. Menon chose to take the film to North Indian audiences but avoided dubbing it to avoid its script being lost in translation, and submitted a final version with English subtitles. The film was later released by Shyam Shroff of Shringar Films in a limited number cinemas in Mumbai and New Delhi, earning positive reviews from critics and performing well at the box office. Shroff said, \\"although the film didn't make pots of money ... it created tremendous brand equity\\". Shobhaa De said the films \\"word of mouth was spectacular\\" and the \\"reports were consistently good\\". Outlook gave the film a favourable review and wrote, \\"This winner of a new-age entertainer is actually a tribute to the 'complete'-ness of the ancient Indian film structure.\\" Kandukondain Kandukondain was showcased at the Regus London Film Festival in November 2011 and critics from the UK newspaper The Guardian rated it as one of the top-12 films of the event's 270. Critic Peter Bradshaw said it \\"is an entertaining reinvention of the novel\\" and that \\"the richly complicated plot allows it to be exuberantly transposed to modern-day India\\", ranking it alongside Ang Lee's Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and Cameron Crowe's Almost Famous. Menon continued to show the film across the world, including having screenings at the Washington Film Festival in April 2001, Locarno Film Festival in August 2002 and the Tiburon International Film Festival in March 2004. US-based Kino Films bought the home video rights to the film. == Accolades == ;2001 National Film Awards * Won — National Award for Male Playback Singer – Shankar Mahadevan for \\"Enna Solla Pogirai\\" ;2001 Filmfare Awards South * Won — Filmfare Award for Best Tamil Film — Kandukondain Kandukondain – Kalaipuli S. Thanu * Won — Filmfare Award for Best Tamil Director — Rajiv Menon == Legacy == The script of Kandukondain Kandukondain was translated into English and published as a book by Westland Publishers in October 2000. Sanjay Leela Bhansali discussed the possibility of making a Hindi version of the film with Menon. Irrfan Khan held discussions to reprise the role of Major Bala. The project did not go ahead. Kandukondain Kandukondain became an important film in the careers of Kumar and Rai, showcasing both actors' versatility and ensured their successful careers in cinema. In an interview, Ajith Kumar stated how he understood his true self after acting in the film. The film's songs inspired several film titles; Enge Enadhu Kavithai (2002), Kannamoochi Yenada (2007) and Konjum Mainakkale (2012). Another film titled Enna Solla Pogirai starring Shakthi Vasu and Poorna was developed during 2011 before being abandoned. A poster of Kandukondain Kandukondain is shown in 12B (2001). The character Anjali in the Telugu film Chi La Sow (2018) was inspired by Tabu's character in Kandukondain Kandukondain. The film inspired a Zee Tamil television serial with the same name. == References  External links == * * Category:2000 drama films Category:2000 films Category:2000 romantic drama films Category:2000s romantic musical films Category:2000s Tamil-language films Category:Films about educators Category:Films about film directors and producers Category:Films about filmmaking Category:Films about siblings Category:Films about singers Category:Films based on Sense and Sensibility Category:Films scored by A.

The name Roksan itself is derived from the name of Roxana, daughter of the Persian King Darius. This closely reflects the Persian heritage and roots of both Hashemi and Moghaddam. Not surprisingly many of Roksan's product names have references to names of cities, places and famous people of Persia (now Iran).Stemmelin, Pierre (25 January 2013) \\"Roksan Xerxes 20 Plus : l'autre platine vinyle de référence... depuis 1985\\" . On Mag Moghaddam, having then just obtained his PhD at Imperial College, became dissatisfied with the state of the audio arts when he heard his little TV set more musically satisfying than his already high-end Linn/Naim tri-amped audio system, and began experimentation. He deduced that where the existing turntable design failed was that the cartridge must be held still wherever the groove goes, and thus the mean line traced by the groove relative to the body of the cartridge needed to be constant. His ideas led him away from using the sprung sub-chassis as part of the speed-controlling system. Moghaddam built a prototype using a fire door. Hashemi, a friend who had heard the new prototype turntable and wanted one, teamed up to start the company. The Darius loudspeaker design, based on the re-examination of the relationship between and magnitudes of movements of the tweeter and the woofer, was already in prototype. The concept stunned the trade when it was demonstrated at the 1985 hi-fi show where the Xerxes was launched. In 1990, Roksan employed John Cornock,John Cornock an Industrial Design graduate from Manchester Polytechnic, to assist in the development of new product lines. He contributed to the aesthetics of the first Radius record player, DP1 CD transport, ROK amplification, Attessa range and the flagship Touraj Moghaddam Signature (TMS) turntable, named after the company's chief designer and founder. In 2002, the TMS2 replaced the TMS turntable. John later rejoined the company to create the aesthetic design for the K3 range of electronics, the all-new Blak range and limited run Oxygene record player. In 1996, the company was acquired by Verity plc, a hi-fi group that owned the Mission, Wharfedale and Quad brands. But when Verity demerged around two years later to concentrate on flat-panel speaker technology, Hashemi and Moghaddam reacquired their company.

This belt-drive turntable without a sprung sub-chassis challenged conventional suspension designs for build and sound quality.Geoff Husband, Xerxes X Turntable, Artemiz Arm, TNT, November 2002Steward, Malcolm (May 1989). \\"Roksan Xerxes / Artemiz\\". Hi-Fi Review c/o malcolmsteward.co.uk It succeeded in finding favour with British \\"flat-earthers\\". The design attacked the \\"high-ground\\" by eschewing the spring isolation, which was then regarded as a major strength. Instead, it addressed the issues of Groove drag and lateral rigidity, the ultimate objective of which was to stabilise the relationship between cartridge stylus and the spinning record groove. Springs were not considered sufficiently rigid in the lateral plane, and permitted too much rotation of the suspended parts relative to the motor.Art Dudley, Listening #49 : Page 1 of 2, Stereophile, Vol.30 No.1, January 2007 While most other designs relied on inertia (through platter mass) to attenuate the problem, Roksan retained a light platter, but addressed drag by mounting the motor on its own bearing and restricted its long-range movement by a small spring, so that the revolving armature could still drive the system. Xerxes was named #53 \\"Hot Product by Stereophile in 2002.John Atkinson, 40 years of Stereophile: The Hot 100 Products, Stereophile, Page 4 of 7, Vol.25 No. 11, November 2002 Radius 5 & the Radius 7 are the entry-level turntables, the latter having a high precision and stability speed control built in, designed by Simon Taylor who joined the company in 2013. ===Loudspeakers=== Roksan was the first company ever to mechanically isolate the speaker tweeter from the bass unit using springs, in their Darius loudspeaker. This design concept has since been followed by other high end speaker manufacturers. ===Electronics=== Roksan now has over 30 different products which include analogue and digital sources, electronics amplification and loudspeakers for audio as well as home cinema. In 2009, following a philosophy of building high quality components at an affordable price, Roksan launched the K2 stereo integrated amplifier. At a time when British manufacturers had done away with the phono stage for budget products, the K2 was notable in actually having a 47k ohm input for moving-magnet cartridges. The K3 replaced the K2 in 2012, having an uprated power supply and Bluetooth aptX as standard. 2015 saw the introduction of the blak, a new amplifier with a new 'dual monoblock' design, with XLR inputs, bluetooth and a high performance phono input. ==Milestones== *1985, introduction of the Xerxes turntable. *1986, launched the Darius loudspeaker *1987, introduced the Artemiz tonearm *1987, their first moving coil phono cartridge, the Shiraz, was launched. *1988, Roksan's first lifestyle product, the Hot Cake loudspeakers introduced. *1989, introduced their first phono amplifier, Artaxerxes, fitted inside the Xerxes, into which plugged directly the tonearm cable. *1989, launched the budget Radius record player, Tabriz arm and Corus moving magnet cartridge. *1990, first range of electronics, the ROK S1 stereo amplifier and M1 mono amplifier with matching pre amplifiers and power supplies. *1991, Roksan's first CD player, the ROK DP1 introduced *1991, launched top of the range TMS record player. *1992, Roksan replaced the ROK DP1 with the Attessa CD playing system consisting of CD transport, DAC and power supply. *1993, production of the new Ojan 3 and 3X loudspeakers started. *1994, Rokone loudspeaker was released in a variety of real wood veneers. *1994, Attessa and the ROK series of products were fully upgraded to DP3 and ROK 1.5 versions. *1995, the 3 plinth 10th anniversary Xerxes.X, implementing design ideas from the TMS, replaced the original Xerxes turntable. *1998, the four piece Caspian Audio System (Integrated amplifier, CD player, and FM Tuner) was launched. *1999, a digital surround sound processor (DSP), a five- channel AV amplifier and DVD player were added to the Caspian system. *2000, Introduction of the new Kandy line, lifestyle starter Audio System. *2001, the Caspian phono amplifiers were released. *2002, TMS2 replaced the original TMS. *2003, release of the Radius 5 turntable and Nima tonearm, and the Roksan set- up LP for record players. *2003, Kandy MKIII system, (Kandy integrated amplifier, stereo amplifier, Three channel amplifier, CD player and AM/FM Tuner) released. *2004, Caspian M-series (Pre amplifier, mono amplifier, integrated amplifier, stereo power amplifier, phono amplifier, CD player, FM tuner and dedicated Xerxes speed control). *2004, released ALTITUDE, its first ever recording of a collection of some very special music from some very talented musicians. *2005, 20th anniversary Xerxes.20 replaced the Xerxes.X, incorporated the new improved TMS2 bearing ball and the new Rmat-5 sub-plinth for record players; reference R-series7 mono block, preamplifier *2005, Kandy LIII integrated amplifier, power amplifier and CD player *2007, Platinum preamplifier and power amplifier *2007, Kandy K2 integrated amplifier, power amplifier and CD player *2008, TMS3 record player *2008, Xerxes 20+ record player *2009, Kandy K2 TR5 standmount ribbon speakers *2009, Radius 5 Mk- II/Nima record player *2010, Caspian M2 integrated amplifier and CD player *2011, Caspian M2 power amplifier *2012, Oxygene digital integrated amplifier and CD player AptX bluetooth connectivity *2013, Kandy K2 BT integrated amplifier with AptX bluetooth connectivity *2014, Kandy K3 integrated amplifier with AptX bluetooth connectivity, DAC and CD player *2014, Kandy TR5-S2 standmount ribbon speakers *2015, Capian VSC series record player speed controls and reference phono stage *2016, blak integrated amplifier with AptX bluetooth connectivity, and included DAC *2016, blak CD player *2016, Radius 7 record player with integrated speed control.\\"Roksan returns with redesigned Radius 7 turntable\\".

This type of motor is usually used for rear-wheel drive cars, except for some Audi and SAAB models equipped with longitudinal engines in front wheel drive. In front-wheel drive cars a transverse engine is usually used. Trucks often have longitudinal engines with rear-wheel drive. For motorcycles, the use of a particular type depends on the drive: in case of a chain or belt drive a transverse engine is usually used, and with shaft drives a longitudinal engine. Longitudinal engines in motorcycles do have one disadvantage: the \\"tipping point\\" of the crankshaft tilts along the entire motorcycle to a greater or lesser degree when accelerating. This is partly resolved by having other components, such as the generator and the gearbox, rotate in the opposite direction to the crankshaft. Most larger, \\"premium\\" vehicles use this engine orientation, both front and rear wheel driven, because powerful engines such as the inline-6 and 90° big-bore V8 are usually too long to fit in a FF transverse engine bay, while most mainstream modern vehicles use front wheel drive along with a transverse engine arrangement. Cars with longitudinal engines usually have a smaller minimum turning circle than those with transverse engines. This is because there is more space to the sides of the engine, allowing deeper wheel arches so the front wheels are able to turn through a greater angle. Honda and Toyota were also offered cars with longitudinal engines, namely Honda Vigor, Acura/Honda Legend/RL and Toyota Tercel. ==Common types of longitudinally placed engines== This is a list of typical examples of types of engines which can be placed in motor vehicles: * in-line or straight engine — where two, three, four, five, six, and even eight cylinders are placed in a single plane. * V engine — where two, four, six, eight, ten, twelve, or even sixteen cylinders are placed in two separate planes, looking like a \\"V\\" when viewed from the end of the crankshaft. * flat or boxer engine — where two, four, six or more cylinders are arranged in two diametrically horizontally opposed planes. * W engine — where two (narrow angle) vee engines are siamesed together (within 180°), where at eight, twelve or sixteen cylinders are arranged in four separate planes. ==References== Category:Engine technology Category:Automotive technologies ","title":"Longitudinal engine"},{"id":"2213140","text":"The Animation Guild, IATSE Local 839 is a professional guild and union of animation artists, writers and technicians. It was formed in 1952. In 2002, the organization changed its name from Motion Picture Screen Cartoonists. The full name of the organization is The Animation Guild and Affiliated Optical Electronic and Graphic Arts, Local 839 of the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees and Moving Picture Technicians, Artists and Allied Crafts of the United States, its Territories and Canada, American Federation of Labor-Congress of Industrial Organizations/Canadian Labour Congress. == Governance == The Animation Guild is governed by its membership, which meets every two months. To supervise the Guild's affairs, every three years the membership elects a sixteen-person Executive Board by secret mail ballot. The Executive Board meets every month. As of December 2016, the key executives on the Board are: *President: Jeanette Moreno King *Vice President: Jack Thomas *Business Representative: Steve Kaplan The Business Representative is the only paid, full-time elected official of the Guild, which also has a paid staff. All other Board members work at studios under the Guild's jurisdiction. == Collective bargaining agreements == The Animation Guild negotiates and enforces collective bargaining agreements, or CBAs, with companies employing persons under its jurisdiction. These CBAs: *define terms and conditions of employment; *set minimum wages, hours and working conditions; *provide for a grievance procedure, whereby the Guild intervenes on behalf of its members in disputes with their employers; *specify the payment of contributions to the Motion Picture Industry Pension and Health Plans (MPIPHP), to provide health insurance and a defined-benefit pension. The MPIPHP is entirely employer- funded, by hourly contributions and by residuals and supplemental market payments. All of the terms and conditions of Animation Guild CBAs are minimums; that is, any employee working under a CBA has the unrestricted right to negotiate better terms and conditions than those set forth in the CBA. Such better terms and conditions include but are not limited to: *\\"overscale\\" wages; *sick pay; *additional vacation time; *provisions to allow employees to work at home or off-premises. The text of the Guild's current CBAs and sideletters can be found on their website. === Animation Guild 401(k) Plan === Although not part of the CBA, the Guild sponsors a multi-employer, employee- funded 401(k) to which virtually all of its employers are signed. The 401(k) was administered by Mass Mutual in the past, but is currently managed by The Vanguard Group. == Jurisdiction == The Animation Guild's jurisdiction is determined by its parent body, the IATSE, and as defined in its CBA. === Work jurisdiction === The Guild covers all artistic, creative and technical job categories in the animation process, with the following exceptions: *Animation camerapersons are under the jurisdiction of IATSE Local 600. *Track readers and soundpersons are under the jurisdiction of IATSE Local 695. *Animation editors are under the jurisdiction of the Motion Picture Editors Guild, IATSE Local 700. *Animation voice actors are covered by the Screen Actors Guild- American Federation of Television and Radio Artists. *Generally speaking, animation directors of theatrical features are not covered, as they are considered management due to their ability to hire and fire employees, but animation directors in other media such as television are covered. *Although animation producers, production managers and non-creative support personnel are not covered under the Guild CBA, employers will sometimes sign a so-called \\"non-affiliate\\" agreement that allows them to cover them for purposes of health insurance and pension. *Although most animation writers are under the Animation Guild's jurisdiction, some are covered by the Writers Guild of America, west. *So-called \\"freelancers\\" are covered under the CBA if they are working as employees of a signator employer. Bona fide independent contractors are not covered, since they are not employees of the company for which they perform work. Although the Guild's traditional jurisdiction was limited to those working on animated films, in recent years the Guild has expanded to the point where a significant percentage of its members are employed in motion picture computer graphics. Today, both 2D and 3D artists work under the Guild's jurisdiction, both in animation and live action. === Geographical jurisdiction === All of the Animation Guild's current collective bargaining agreements are with employers in southern California. The IATSE and other IA locals have jurisdiction over animation in other areas of the United States and Canada. == Employers  Animation studios signed with TAG === As of December 2019, the following animation studios were signed to collective bargaining agreements with the Animation Guild: * 6 Point 2 * Adelaide Productions, Inc. * Alien Animation, LLC * Amazon Studios * Animated Ark, LLC (Unified Pictures) * Animated Productions, Inc. * Bento Box Animation * Box Office Animation, Inc. * Bureau of Magic, LLC * Cartoon Network Studios * Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc. * Cranetown Media, LLC * Crest Animation Studios * Disney Television Animation ** ABC Studios ** Katy Mac Session Productions Inc ** Obelisk Productions, Inc. ** Patricks Road Productions II, Inc. ** Rutherford Bench Productions, Inc. * DreamWorks Animation, LLC ** DreamWorks Animation Television, Inc. * Eye Animation Productions Inc. * Fox Animation Los Angeles ** CRD Productions, Inc. ** Muddy Water Entertainment, Inc. * Fox Television Animation ** 4th Floor Productions, Inc. * Hasbro Studios ** My Little Pony G5 Productions LLC ** My Little Pony Productions LLC ** Woodridge Productions LLC * HB Wink Productions ** Extinct Productions, LLC * Leon Animation LLC * Marvel Animation, Inc. ** Marvel Animation Studio LLC * Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Animation Inc. * Nickelodeon Animation Studios * Original Force 3D Animation * Pearl Studio, LLC. * Picrow, Inc. * Pour Animer, LLC * Powerhaus Animation, LLC * Puny, LLC * Rick and Morty LLC * Robin Red Breast * Robin Sue Productions * Rough Draft Studios * SBI Media, LLC (Starburns Industries) * Skydance Animation, LLC * Snapshot Enterprises, LLC * Sony Pictures Animation * Splash Happy Animation, LLC * Streetlight Productions * STX Animation * Toei Animation Co., Ltd. * Tom T Animation/Gang of Seven Animation * Turner 1050 Productions * Universal City Studios LLC ** Universal Animation Studios, LLC * Viltrumite Pants, LLC * Walt Disney Animation Studios ** The Secret Lab * Warner Animation Group * Warner Bros. Animation ** Warner Specialty Productions Inc. * Wild Canary Animation * Zamodo, LLC (OddBot) === Payroll companies === The Guild also signs collective bargaining agreements with payroll companies. Payroll companies perform the payroll and other administrative functions (often including human resources) for small companies and unincorporated animation projects, and serve as the employer of record for purposes of making Guild health insurance, 401(k) plan and pension payments, and processing grievances. Payroll companies signed to the CBA include: *Cast & Crew Production Plr Inc. *EPSG Management Services (Entertainment Partners) *Payday Inc. *Quantum Payroll Services, Inc. == Membership requirements == Membership in the Animation Guild can be acquired in either of two ways: === Membership by employment === Animation artists, writers and technicians who are hired by employers signed to Guild CBAs will be required to join the Guild after thirty days' employment. The one-time initiation fee consists of two weeks' minimum scale wages for the job category in which the applicant has been hired. Dues are charged quarterly and are also based upon the scale rate for the job category as of the beginning of the quarter. As of August 2008 the highest dues rate is $101.00. === Membership by organizing === Animation artists, writers and technicians who are employed by companies that do not have TAG agreements, may become members if and when the company is organized. Potential members may assist the Guild in its organizing efforts by signing a confidential representation card. After the employer is organized and signed to a collective bargaining agreement, employees often are brought into membership without initiation fees. ==External links== *The Animation Guild official Web site *The Animation Guild blog *Drawing The Line: The Untold Story of the Animation Unions from Bosko to Bart Simpson, by: TAG President Emeritus Tom Sito Category:International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees Category:Trade unions in California Category:Entertainment industry unions Category:American animation Category:Trade unions established in 1952 ","title":"The Animation Guild, IATSE Local 839"},{"id":"2213141","text":"David Plouffe (; born May 27, 1967)Barnes, James A. \\"Obama's Inner Circle\\" , National Journal, March 31, 2008.Goldman, Julianna. \\"Obama's Aide Plouffe\\", Bloomberg, June 16, 2008. is an American lobbyist and political strategist best known as the campaign manager for Barack Obama's successful 2008 presidential campaign. A long-time Democratic Party campaign consultant, he was a partner at the party-aligned campaign consulting firm AKPD Message and Media, which he joined in 2000. Plouffe was an outside senior advisor to Obama since the president's first day in office and was then appointed as a Senior Advisor to the President (inside the White House) in 2011 following the resignation of David Axelrod, who went on to start Obama's reelection campaign. In September 2014, he became the Senior Vice President of Policy and Strategy for Uber.\\"A LEADER FOR THE UBER CAMPAIGN\\", uber.com; accessed September 20, 2017. In May 2015, he left that role to become a full-time strategic adviser for the company. In January 2017, he joined the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative to lead the policy and advocacy efforts of the initiative. In 2019, POLITICO reported he joined the Board of Directors of liberal nonprofit ACRONYM, where he would advise an anti-Trump digital campaign. ==Early life== Plouffe was born and raised in Wilmington, Delaware, in a working class Roman Catholic family (he is now an Episcopalian),Politico: \\"Full transcript: POLITICO's Glenn Thrush interviews David Plouffe\\" by Politico Staff February 29, 2016\\"So I was perusing Wikipedia before I came in, because I realized I've read your book, I've talked with you 10,000 times, and I never looked at your Wikipedia page. And the first thing I realized about you that I didn't know is Wikipedia says you're Jewish. You are not apparently Jewish, right? DAVID PLOUFFE: No. I may be honorary Jewish, but no, I was raised Catholic, went to Catholic school, and now am a practicing Episcopalian.\\" the son of Frances (née Vincent), a stay-at-home mother, and James Everett \\"Jim\\" Plouffe, a factory worker who later worked in marketing. Plouffe attended St. Mark's High School. He left the University of Delaware prior to graduating in 1989 to pursue a full-time career in politics, and completed his full undergraduate degree in May 2010. ==Career== Plouffe began his political career by working for Senator Tom Harkin's 1990 re-election campaign.Julianna Goldman, Obama's Aide Plouffe Plots Victory From Background, yahoo.com; accessed July 4, 2008. He later worked as a state field director for Harkin's unsuccessful 1992 Presidential campaign. In the same year he successfully managed Congressman John Olver's first re-election bid in Massachusetts. In 1994 Plouffe managed Delaware Attorney General Charles M. Oberly's unsuccessful campaign against Senator William V. Roth. ==2008 Barack Obama presidential campaign== Plouffe was the campaign manager for Obama's successful 2008 presidential campaign. He is credited with the campaign's successful overall strategy in the race (primarily against then-Senator Hillary Clinton) for the Democratic Party presidential nomination, to focus on the first caucus in Iowa and on maximizing the number of pledged delegates, as opposed to focusing on states with primaries and the overall popular vote. He is also credited by The New Republic for Obama's success in the Iowa caucus and for crafting an overall strategy to prolong the primary past Super Tuesday. The Chicago Tribune writes, \\"Plouffe was the mastermind behind a winning strategy that looked well past Super Tuesday's contests on Feb. 5 and placed value on large and small states\\". Plouffe also maintained discipline over communications, including controlling leaks and releasing information about the campaign on its terms. Averse to publicity himself, Plouffe's control over the internal workings of the campaign avoided the publicly aired squabbles that tend to trouble campaigns. In June 2008, when then-Senator Obama clinched the Democratic Party nomination, he thanked Plouffe for being the one \\"who never gets any credit, but has built the best political campaign, I think, in the history of the United States\\". In May 2008, David Axelrod praised Plouffe, stating he had \\"done the most magnificent job of managing a campaign that I've seen in my life of watching presidential politics. To start something like this from scratch and build what we have built was a truly remarkable thing\\". After winning the election on November 4, Obama credited Plouffe in his acceptance speech, calling him \\"the unsung hero of this campaign, who built the...best political campaign, I think, in the history of the United States of America\\". ==2009-2011== Plouffe went to work as an outside senior adviser to the Obama administration, in January 2009. His book The Audacity to Win: The Inside Story and Lessons of Barack Obama's Historic Victory, discussing management strategies and tactics that he used in the 2008 campaign, was published on November 3, 2009, and became a New York Times bestseller. He later issued a video challenge for Obama supporters to buy a copy of his book on December 8, 2009 to \\"Beat Sarah Palin\\" and her bestselling book for one day.Penguin Books (2009). The Audacity to Win; retrieved October 29, 2009. Plouffe signed with the Washington Speakers Bureau to give paid speeches and plans to engage in non-government consulting work. In May 2009, Plouffe delivered the convocation address at Cornell University.Obama's Campaign Manager Set to Speak at Convocation, The Cornell Daily Sun, September 27, 2009. ==2011-2013: Senior Advisor to the President== In January 2011, Plouffe joined the White House as Assistant to the President and Senior Advisor. Plouffe replaced David Axelrod as Senior Advisor when Axelrod returned to Chicago to help run President Obama's 2012 re-election campaign. In his role as senior advisor, Plouffe led the crafting of White House strategy and communicating the president's message. He attended the president on his domestic and overseas visits, including the May 2011 state visit to the UK. After a successful reelection and inauguration of President Obama, Plouffe departed the White House in January 2013. During a national news event, on his final day in the White House, Plouffe was singled out by the president saying, “What people don’t always realize, because he doesn’t like to show it, is the reason he does this stuff is because he cares deeply about people. And he cares about justice, and he cares about making sure that everybody gets a shot in life. And, those values have motivated him to do incredible things, and were it not for him, we would not have been as effective a White House and I probably wouldn’t be here.” ==Career after the White House== After leaving the White House in early 2013, Plouffe became a contributor for Bloomberg TV and ABC News. In April 2013, Plouffe was inducted into the American Association of Political Consultants Hall of Fame. Plouffe met with Hillary Clinton in mid-2013 to help out in her campaign for president, having claimed that Clinton approached him first. In September 2015, Plouffe reportedly played a key role in convincing Vice President Joe Biden not to challenge Clinton, telling Biden \\"not to end his career in embarrassment with a third place finish in Iowa, according to multiple accounts of the meeting\\". In the summer of 2014, rumors circulated that Plouffe might return to the White House as Chief of Staff. On August 5, 2014, Plouffe denied he planned to return at a Politico Playbook lunch, and White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said he did not expect Chief of Staff Denis McDonough to depart. On August 19, 2014, Plouffe was appointed as Senior Vice President of Policy and Strategy at Uber. In January 2017, Plouffe was hired by Mark Zuckerberg to lead policy and advocacy at the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative. He'll lead a bipartisan policy board alongside Ken Mehlman where they'll announce policy members and work to find opportunities to work with the government. In September 2019, Plouffe was invited to join the board of directors of ACRONYM, a liberal nonprofit group focused on digital messaging, by the CEO Tara McGowan. He'll advise program work at ACRONYM as well as bolster the organization’s fundraising efforts. Plouffe hosts a podcast, Campaign HQ with David Plouffe, which is a partnership with Cadence13. ==Controversy== Plouffe has drawn criticism for his paid speaking engagements abroad while on hiatus from advising Obama. In early 2009, Plouffe spoke in Baku, Azerbaijan, for $50,000. The event's sponsor had ties to Azerbaijan's authoritarian government. Following complaints from human rights groups, Plouffe donated his speaking fees to the National Democratic Institute. In December 2010, Plouffe received $100,000 for two speeches in Nigeria from an affiliate of the South African telecommunications company MTN Group. At the time, MTN had been doing business with the government of Iran since 2005. MTN later came under increased scrutiny by the United States due to allegations that the Iranian government used the MTN network to track and monitor dissidents. MTN has been listed on the \\"Iran Business Registry\\" of watchdog group United Against Nuclear Iran since 2009. White House spokesman Eric Schultz stated that Plouffe had only spoken to the group about digital communications and cellular technology, and had declined to meet with the company's leadership. Schultz also said the criticism of Plouffe's speeches before he joined the White House was \\"misplaced\\". In 2013, in response to accusations from Congressman Darrell Issa (R-CA) that the Obama administration knew about the IRS targeting of not-for- profit conservative groups for extra scrutiny, Plouffe tweeted: \\"Strong words from Mr Grand Theft Auto and suspected arsonist/insurance swindler. And loose ethically today\\", referring to two incidents in Issa's past. In 1972, while a teenager, Issa was accused of stealing a Maserati sports car; the charges were later dropped. In 1982, a Cleveland warehouse belonging to Issa burned to the ground. The fire was ruled suspicious and Issa collected an insurance payout, but he was not charged with any crime.Blake, Aaron.

In February 2017, Plouffe was fined $90,000 by the Chicago Board of Ethics for the violation of ethics rules when he failed to register as a lobbyist after contacting Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel to help Uber with regulations for picking up travelers at Chicago airports. The board also fined Uber $2,000 for hiring a lobbyist who violated the city's lobbying laws. ==Works== *Plouffe, David.
